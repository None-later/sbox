<p>Romney&#8217;s Private Equity Magic Trick&#8211;equity manager&#8217;s gain, taxpayers&#8217; losses (Reich Video)</p>
<p>Mitt Romney claims that his business experience at Bain Capital is a superb qualification for the presidency.  He implies that this experience will carry over to his economic policies, with the suggestion that he will become a &#8220;job creator-in-chief&#8221; like all those one-percenters purportedly are in the private sector.<br />In reality, private equity experience is a recipe for disaster in the White House.  Think about what private equity firms do.  They take an ongoing business&#8211;usually one that is making decent profits and paying its workers decently&#8211;and they make it into one that can pay outsized &#8220;rent&#8221; profits to the private equity firm.  Usually, though not always, this means cutting costs and adding debt. </p>
<p>The debt is an elixir for private equity firms.  Because interest is deductible, it actually increases profits by lowering the company&#8217;s federal income taxes; yet because it isn&#8217;t required to be used by the firm to actually improve the products or services offered, it is often used instead to pay dividends to the private equity firms, paying off whatever actual investment the private equity firm made in the company. </p>
<p>Cutting costs is the way for private equity firms to extract even more gravy from their target company.  Cost cutting is most often directed at</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<ul>
<li>firing workers and making fewer workers do the same work that more workers used to do (that&#8217;s called a &#8220;productivity&#8221; gain, garnered, of course, by the private equity firm and not by the everyday workers), and/or </li>
<li>outsourcing jobs to other countries so that labor can be paid less than a going wage in this country (that&#8217;s often coupled with step one, since workers are no longer needed in this country&#8211;sometimes the US workers are even required to train their cheaper foreign counterparts before they are let go, and of course those &#8220;effiencicy&#8221; gains are garnered by the private equity firm and not by the remaining workers), and/or </li>
<li>cutting wages and benefits for the remaining workers (and shipping those extra &#8220;savings&#8221; out as dividends to the equity firm investors), and/or </li>
<li>innovating better administrative systems (this can be a good deal&#8211;for example, putting money  that the company didn&#8217;t have until the new &#8220;investors&#8221; came in into digital record systems or improved communications systems, but it can also be a bad deal, if the firm uses its new technology to game the federal system on taxes, or Medicare reimbursements, or federal contracting or similar items)
<ul>
<li>Consider the fact that Bain and other private equity firms purchased a for-profit hospital.  One of the &#8220;improvements was to redesign the coding system for patient services to increase the reimbursements from Medicare and thus hike up the hospital system&#8217;s profits, which are garnered by the private equity firm.  Julie Creswell and Reed Adelson, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/15/business/hca-giant-hospital-chain-creates-a-windfall-for-private-equity.html">A Giant Hospital Chain is Blazing a Profit Trail</a>, New York Times (Aug. 15, 2012), at A1 (noting that Medicare reimbursements for the highest classifications surged to $949,000 in 2010 from $48,000 in 2006 at one hospital, in a story about Bain Capital and other equity firms&#8217;  profit improvements at HCA, where nurses and doctors express concerns about profit-making that is driving decisions that shortchange patients through understaffing and/or shortchange the government, as in the new coding system that caused the Medicare reimbursements to skyrocket); see also Steve Denning,<a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/stevedenning/2012/08/15/private-equity-wont-fix-health-care-either/">HCA: The unsustainable private equity bubble in US health care</a>, Forbes (Aug. 15, 2012). </li>
<li>As one commenter on the NY Times article noted, &#8220;To be more profitable as a healthcare facility requires &#8230; having more sick people to treat, or hav[ing] higher charges.  Both are inhumane.&#8221;  Munz, New York, NY.  And as one former HCA employee commented, &#8220;patient safety and medication safety came in a distant 2nd to conformity and [the] draconian measures to make care more efficient.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These kinds of activities go hand in hand with the increasing consolidation into mega-business enterprises (regrettably aided by the tax code&#8217;s &#8220;tax-free reorganization&#8221; provisions, that were also made much more flexible during the Bush years in order to facilitate such consolidations).  Big businesses reap the productivity gains of their workers for the few managers and significant shareholders at the top, and either buy  or compete with local and family-owned small enterprises to put those smaller and shallower-pocketed (and less well-connected) business out of the way, thus separating more and more businesses from the communities in which they are located.  All in all, not good for America, and not the kind of skills one wants in the presidency, where we need someone who can see the relationship between the stability of small businesses, viable communities, and stable workers.</p>
<p>For a clear and understandable demonstration of the way private equity firms make their money and who wins (and who loses) from those methods, see Robert Reich&#8217;s video chat on the subject:</p>

<p>ID theft as basis of systemic IRS tax refund fraud problems</p>
<p>Early in 2012, the IRS and Justice Department announced a major crackdown on identity theft and enforcement efforts against tax refund fraud.  See IIRS, <a href="http://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,id=253147,00.html?portlet=108">Identity Theft Crackdown Swweps Across the Nation: More than 200 Actions Taken in Past Week in 23 States</a>, IR-2012-13 (Jan 13, 2012).   However, the IRS, which hasn&#8217;t been a perennial favorite funding target of GOPers in Congress and has had to operate with too few staff and resources to do its job well, has continued to fail to keep up with the criminals who commit tax fraud.  A recent report by the Inspector General for Tax Administration suggests a range of problems. TIGTA, <a href="http://www.treasury.gov/tigta/auditreports/2012reports/201242080fr.pdf">There are Billions of Dollars in Undetected Tax REfund Fraud Resulting from Identity Theft</a> (July 19, 2012) (Ref. No. 2012-42-080). See also Richard Rubin, <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-08-02/irs-may-lose-21-billion-in-identity-fraud-study-says.html">IRS may lose $21 billion in identity fraud, study says</a>, Bloomberg.com (Aug. 2, 2012).</p>
<p>The TIGTA report suggests that identity thieves may end up claiming as much as $21 billion in fraudulent tax refunds over the next five years. Examples include $3.3 million in refunds sent to a single address in MIchigan listed on more than 2000 different tax returns and more than 300 direct deposits totaling almost half a million sent in to a single bank account.  There was one bank account that received 590 deposits totally more than 909 thousand dollars. </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>The agency responded that it has changed its screening filters to address the issues raised and taken several steps to address tax-related identity fraud, which has been concentrated in Florida. The TIGTA report had a series of recommendations, including better use of third party information and limits on tax refunds being sent to the same bank account.</p>
<p>Bloomberg.com also reports a harsh assessment of the IRS&#8217;s effort to provide Tax Identification Numbers (TINs) to non-US residents.  See Richard Rubin, IRS <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-08-08/irs-allowed-fraud-in-rush-to-issue-id-numbers-audit-says.html">Allowed Fraud in Rust to Issue ID Numbers, Audit Says </a>(Aug. 8, 2012).  (For a similar audit report issued by the Deputy Inspector General for Audit on July 7, 2011, see<a href="http://www.treasury.gov/tigta/auditreports/2011reports/201141061fr.html">here</a>.) The rush to serve resulted in allowing fraud to go undetected, with examples of almost 16,000 TINs going to a single address in Phoenix and $52.5 million in refunds for nonresident TINs going to just four addresses in Atlanta. In 2011, the IRS processed almost 3 million tax returns from nonresidents and sent almost $7 billion in tax refunds in response.  But their rush to provide numbers and process returns meant they made mistakes, apparently with some supervisors actually discouraging employees from taking the time to root out fraud, according to the IRS inspector general.  The IRS has announced that it is reinforcing its procedures to ensure the integrity of the program, including a requirement that original identification documents be submitted with applications for TINs.</p>

<p> The fallacy of privatization: anti-government screeds and the Romney agenda</p>
<p> As a prominent tax professor points out, Mitt Romney accumulated most of his additional wealth in a business that generally doesn&#8217;t do anything to increase national wealth.<br />
<blockquote>Mitt Romney accumulated his wealth as managing director of Bain Capital, a leveraged buyout fund (LBO).  LBOs are driven by tax savings.  Tax savings are transfers from other people to LOBs without any increase in GDP or national wealth.  An LOB replaces the stock of established companies with debt.  Johnson argues that because interest is deductible, the replacement can increase the value of the surviving stock by two to six times without any improvement in operating income.  The increase in debt harms the private economy because the companies become very fragile and the leverage encourages the owner to bet the company.  Calvin Johnson, <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2125210">The Tax Explanation for the Romney Leveraged Buyouts</a>, Tax Notes (July 30, 2012), at 579</p></blockquote>
<p>Romney&#8217;s activities at Bain Capital are just one example of how the private economy can generate wealth for a few people at the top without doing anything to help the overall economy, GDP, or national wealth&#8211;or ordinary workers.  With that in mind, we should then be rightly skeptical about the typical claims from the right that the private economy can always do a better job of any given task than government (the public economy).  Yet if you asked that as a question of Romney, you&#8217;d get a canned &#8220;yes.&#8221;</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>For Romney, efficiency and competition are gods that only the private marketplace can worship and therefore all government functions would be better handled by private rather than public forces.  That seems to be the gist of his statement in a recent interview, highlighted by Mark Thoma&#8217;s post on <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2012/08/outsourcing-government-what-is-mitt-romney-talking-about.html">Outsourcing Government: What is Mitt Romney Talking About</a>, at Economist&#8217;s View, that builds on Brad Delong&#8217;s post.  Here&#8217;s the most relevant language from Romney on the idea that private is always better than public:<br />
<blockquote>MITT ROMNEY: Well, clearly you don’t like to hear [about] anyone losing a job. At the same time, government is the least productive—the federal government is the least productive of our economic sectors. The most productive is the private sector. The next most productive is the not-for-profit sector, then comes state and local governments, and finally the federal government. And so moving responsibilities from the federal government to the states or to the private sector will increase productivity.</p></blockquote>
<p>But that&#8217;s simply wrong.  It is empirically wrong.  It is theoretically wrong.  And it is wrong-headed policy for America.</p>
<p>Mark Thoma also pointed out Paul Krugman&#8217;s earlier post, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/11/opinion/11krugman.html?_r=1">Outsourcer in Chief</a>, New York Times (Dec. 11, 2006), providing a range of examples where privatization of public functions results in terribly incompetent performance.<br />
<blockquote>[O]utsourcing of the government’s responsibilities — not to panels of supposed wise men, but to private companies with the right connections — has been one of the hallmarks of [George W. Bush&#8217;s] administration. And privatization through outsourcing is one reason the administration has failed on so many fronts.</p></blockquote>
<p>Krugman lists, among others, the Coast Guard&#8217;s overrun for its privatized modernization program; the generalized outsourcing of Iraqi reconstruction to private contractors &#8220;with hardly any oversight,&#8221; with the unsurprising poor results;  and Bush&#8217;s buddy at FEMA&#8217;s outsourcing of disaster evacuations to Landstar Express, which &#8220;didn&#8217;t even know where to get buses&#8221; when Katrina hit.  As Krugman notes, outsourcing is an &#8220;antigovernment ideology&#8221; of today&#8217;s neocons, and it is one that leads to poor results in many cases.<br />
<blockquote>Conservatives look at the virtues of market competition and leap to the conclusion that private ownership, in itself, is some kind of magic elixir. But there’s no reason to assume that a private company hired to perform a public service will do better than people employed directly by the government.  In fact, the private company will almost surely do a worse job if its political connections insulate it from accountability.  Id. (formatting changed)</p></blockquote>
<p>Now, mix privatization = poor performance because of crony capitalism/lack of oversight with the tendency these days of businesses to exploit workers in order to harness all productivity gains they do achieve for the big bosses at the top.</p>
<p>(If you need information on the latter, look at the way workers&#8217; wages have stagnated or plummeted while managers have skyrocketed.  Or just Google Caterpillar to see how it is negotiating with its unions for cuts for ordinary workers&#8217; wages and benefits, when it is nonetheless already making an enormous profit.)</p>
<p>What you get from this naive, jaundiced view of private versus public is a formula for a disastrous economy.  Obama&#8217;s stimulus was somewhat less than it should have been, but it saved the U.S. economy from the worst we might well have expected from Bush&#8217;s disastrous reaganomics policies.  Bush&#8217;s preemptive war costs combined with deregulation and tax cuts for the rich and for corporations resulted in huge deficits and ultimately caused the financial crisis,  necessitating unprecedented borrowing that left an economy spiralling in free fall when Obama took office.</p>
<p>What Romney promises, then, is a return to the winner-take-all, failed economic ideas of the neocon right. </p>

<p><a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2012/08/romney-is-still-hiding.html">Romney is still hiding his tax history (Part IV)</a></p>
<p>As I noted in several prior posts about the reasons that multiple years of the Romneys&#8217; tax returns are essential to evaluating <a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2012/07/whats-romney-got-to-hide-part-ii.html">Romney</a> as a presidential candidate, the fact that Romney has adamantly refused to release returns other than the 2010 actual return (and the 2011 estimated return) is a cause for concern.  Since the established norm is that presidential candidates release 8-12 years of returns, Romney&#8217;s insistence on not disclosing other returns appears arrogant and disrespectful of voters and suggests that there may be one or more items in those returns that he doesn&#8217;t want voters to know about.  The prior posts included some information about items that could be better assessed with more returns and related information to review, including among others: passive activity losses, questions of whether certain items are hobbies or can legitimately be classed as business expenses, foreign bank accounts, tax shelters, offshore companies, income from <a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2012/07/whats-romney-got-to-hide-part-iii.html">Bain Capital</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_rate">effective tax rate</a>.  Much speculation has centered on the fact that Romney has accounts in various tax haven jurisdictions (Cayman Islands, Bermuda, Singapore) as well as bank accounts in jurisdictions that have been noted for banking secrecy and the accompanying tax evasion possibilities. </p>
<p>Since the US began cracking down on <a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2012/07/whats-romney-got-to-hide-part-ii.html">Swiss bank account</a> holders who had avoided their reporting responsibilities, this latter issue has gained considerable visibility.  It turns out that many Americans had multi-million dollar accounts abroad that weren&#8217;t reported and on which they weren&#8217;t paying taxes.  With the breakthroughs facilitated by whistleblowers that threatened an avalanche of information about other bankers, other accounts and other accountholders, many of those lawbreakers came forward to participate in voluntary disclosure programs through which most could pay a penalty and a settled amount for taxes and avoid criminal prosecution.  So US taxpayers (and voters) want to know&#8211;did the Romneys participate in that disclosure program.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Ed Kleinbard (former chief of staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation and currently at University of Southern California) and Peter Canellos (former chair of the New York State Bar Association Tax Section and current private practitioner) have raised another important issue that would be revealed more clearly with additional tax returns&#8211;Romney&#8217;s participation in abusive tax shelter activity.  See Kleinbard &#038; Canellos, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/08/08/opinion/canellos-kleinbard-romney-taxes">Romney&#8217;s Role in Tax Shelter Raises Questions</a>, CNN op-ed (Aug. 8, 2012).   The authors note that Romney&#8217;s limited release of tax returns doesn&#8217;t &#8220;dispel the legitimate concerns that arises from hints buried in his scant disclosure to wealth.&#8221;  But they note that a &#8220;relevant line of inquiry&#8221; is &#8220;what exists in the public record regarding his attitude toward tax compliance and tax avoidance.&#8221;  So they decide to see what that might be.</p>
<p>They find something troubling&#8211;his acceptance of abusive tax shelter activity by large multinational corporations when he headed Marriott International&#8217;s audit committee and approved the company&#8217;s involvement in a Son of Boss deal, a transaction undertaken purely for tax purposes to create artificial losses that would then be used to offset real gains from business activities and thereby substantially reduce the company&#8217;s tax bills.<br />
<blockquote>A key troubling public manifestation of Romney&#8217;s apparent insensitivity to tax obligations is his <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-02-22/romney-as-auditing-chairman-saw-marriott-son-of-boss-tax-shelter-defy-irs.html">role in Marriott International&#8217;s abusive tax shelter activity</a>.<br />*** From 1993 to 1998, Romney was the head of the audit committee of the Marriott board.<br />During that period, Marriott engaged in a series of complex and high-profile maneuvers, including &#8220;Son of Boss,&#8221; a notoriously abusive prepackaged tax shelter that investment banks and accounting firms marketed to corporations such as Marriott. In this respect, Marriott was in the vanguard of a then-emerging corporate tax shelter bubble that substantially undermined the entire corporate tax system.<br />*** [T]he government initiated legal challenges that resulted in complete disallowance of the losses claimed by Marriott and other corporations. *** [T]he government brought successful criminal prosecutions against a number of individuals involved in Son of Boss. ***<br /><strong>In his key role as chairman of the Marriott board&#8217;s audit committee, Romney approved the firm&#8217;s reporting of fictional tax losses exceeding $70 million generated by its Son of Boss transaction. His endorsement of this stratagem provides insight into Romney&#8217;s professional ethics and attitude toward tax compliance obligations</strong>. (emphasis added)</p></blockquote>
<p>So Romney as &#8220;businessman&#8221; (his claimed primary qualification for serving as President) was happy to sign off on tax scam transactions intended to benefit his corporation at the cost of ordinary taxpayers who are called upon to make up the difference in higher rates of borrowing by the federal government or higher taxes.  Can Romney hide behind the excuse of&#8211;Oops, I was just an unsophisticated board member who relied on tax advisers and couldn&#8217;t be expected to understand such complex transactions and tax issues?  No way.  As Kleinbard and Canellos note in their op-ed:<br />
<blockquote>In his key position as head of the board&#8217;s audit committee, Romney was required under the securities laws and his fiduciary duties to review the transaction. In fact, it has been publicly reported that<strong>Romney was the Marriott Board member most acquainted with the transaction and to whom the other board members turned for advice.</strong> This makes sense because <strong>aggressive tax-driven financial engineering was a large part of what Romney (and Bain) did for a living</strong>. For these reasons, it is fair to hold him accountable for Marriott&#8217;s spurious tax reporting. <br />*** [Romney] had an insider&#8217;s perspective on the motivation and lack of substance in the transaction, as well as the financial sophistication to understand the tax avoidance involved. <strong>Romney failed in his duties to Marriott and its shareholders and acted to undermine the fairness of the tax system</strong>. (emphasis added).</p></blockquote>
<p>These issues are critically important to Romney&#8217;s purported qualifications to serve as president.  A man who is willing to bend/break the rules in order to make more money for himself and his elite buddies doesn&#8217;t belong in the White House.</p>

<p>Corporations Don&#8217;t Need More Tax Breaks</p>
<p>If you listen to the corporate lobbyists, and the right-wingers who plead their cases for them in Congress and in the media, you&#8217;d think that corporations are so heavily taxed that it is threatening their ability to continue to conduct business and be competitive in world markets. But is that really the case? This blog has often pointed out two obvious shortcomings in the corporate whine: first, the corporate statutory rate of 35% is honored in the breach&#8211;most corporations pay actual tax rates so significantly lower than 35% that the statutory rate is an illusion; and second, as far as global competitiveness is concerned, the corporate tax rate is the only significant tax that US corporations pay, whereas most other countries have both corporate income taxes and VAT taxes, often paid at each transactional stage of production.</p>
<p>A site called &#8220;NerdWallet&#8221; provides considerable information based on analysis of the financial statements of companies, providing greater transparency for investors and, lucky for us, for those of us interested in tax facts.   See, e.g., the NerdWallet study, <a href="http://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/markets/2012/corporate-taxes-only-9-percent/">Top Companies Paid 9% Tax Rate </a>(July 24, 2012).<br />
<blockquote>Because tax provision includes both domestic and foreign, current and deferred taxes, NerdWallet researched further to find how much was actually paid by these American companies to the U.S. federal government in the most recent tax year.  By dividing the current portion of federal taxes by pre-tax income, NerdWallet was able to calculate the percentage of these companies’ earnings that was paid to the U.S. government. <strong>For the ten American companies with highest earnings in the most recent fiscal year, this number averaged 9%. NerdWallet Study (emphasis added).</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>A press release about the study notes just how much corporate taxation has shrunk as a source of revenue in the US, as corporations pay lower rates than ordinary Americans.<br />
<blockquote>A new <a href="http://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/markets/2012/corporate-taxes-only-9-percent/">NerdWallet study</a> found the 10 most profitable U.S. companies paid an average of just 9% in federal taxes last year. These low rates are particularly shocking given that the official tax rate is 35%. The study also revealed that more than half of the 500 largest U.S. companies <a href="http://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/markets/2012/individual-vs-corporate-taxes/">paid a lower tax rate</a> than the average American.  NerdWallet press release (July 30 2012).</p></blockquote>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>NerdWallet also has a very useful tool for seeing what each major corporation of the top 500 actually pays in taxes, available <a href="http://www.nerdwallet.com/markets/corporate-taxes/general-electric-co">here</a>. You can scroll through a list of corporations to select a particular one of interest, and the tool will show the actual rate of taxes paid to the U.S. government, the compensation paid to the CEO, and the average compensation for the company&#8217;s employees, as well as the multiple of the CEO compensation to the average employee compensation. For example, the tool provides the following information for several of the largest of the 500 corporations.<br />
<blockquote>1. Exxon Mobil Pre-tax Earnings: $73.3 Billion Actual Taxes Paid: $1.5 Billion (2%)<br />2. Chevron Pre-tax Earnings: $46.6 Billion Actual Taxes Paid: $1.9 Billion (4%)<br />3. Apple Pre-tax Earnings: $34.2 Billion Actual Taxes Paid $3.9 Billion (11%)<br />4. Microsoft Pre-tax Earnings: $28.1 Billion Actual Taxes Paid: $3.1 Billion (11%)<br />5. JPMorgan Chase &#038; Co Pre-tax Earnings: $26.7 Billion Actual Taxes Paid $3.7 Billion (14%)</p></blockquote>

<p>Does the Tea Party support Tax Dodgers?</p>
<p>Andrew Leonard&#8217;s July 27 article in Salon, <a href="http://www.salon.com/2012/07/27/tea_party_shields_tax_dodgers/">Tea Party Shields Tax Dodgers</a>, looks at the way Jim DeMint and Rand Paul are carrying water for the big banks&#8211;suggesting that Treasury shouldn&#8217;t be implementing the &#8220;FATCA&#8221; legislation passed as part of the HIRE act because it might cost the big banks some paperwork they&#8217;d rather not do.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the issue with FATCA. It requires banks to report on substantial accounts held abroad&#8211;more than $50,000 for individuals or more than $250,000 for entities.</p>
<p>The Treasury believes it can generate almost $9 billion in additional tax revenues through the implementation of FATCA over the next ten years. But Paul, DeMint and other right-wingers have complained about the cost to banks to carry out the law.</p>
<p> As Leonard puts it,</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<blockquote><p>FATCA isn’t about making life hard for expatriates. It is targeted at big players who are moving huge amounts of cash overseas for the specific purpose of avoiding their U.S. tax obligations. And Rand Paul and Jim DeMint are defending these upstanding members of the 1 percent by carrying water for banks who want to avoid the paperwork costs involved in ferreting out the tax dodgers. </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Is that how the Tea Party wants this country to be run — in the best interests of the richest Americans and the banks?</p></blockquote>

<p>Tax evaders (and those who aide them), not regulatory complexities, cause tax evasion</p>
<p>The July 24 New York Times Magazine carries an article by Adam D entitled <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/29/magazine/my-big-fat-belizean-singaporean-bank-account.html">My Big Fat Belizean, Singaporean Bank Account</a>.</p>
<p>The author shows how easy it was for him to establish a secret offshore bank account that would allow him to evade US (and other nation&#8217;s) taxes with ease. It only cost around a thousand dollars, and the firms that do this for a living can set you up with a fake corporation in one tax haven and a real bank account in another, both of them sworn to secrecy about your identity as a US citizen and complicit in aiding wealthy taxpayers in avoiding required reporting to the IRS.<br />And that means a lot of moolah gets stashed abroad, and a lot of taxes remain unpaid.<br />
<blockquote>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_Justice_Network">Tax Justice Network</a>, a global research firm that advocates against such havens, suggests that the amount hidden offshore is between $21 trillion and $32 trillion. If properly taxed, that could yield more than $200 billion in revenue around the world. Furthermore, because a 2010 McKinsey &#038; Company report estimated the world’s financial assets at about $200 trillion, somewhere around 10 percent or more of the world’s wealth is effectively invisible. And it’s also almost certainly in the hands of the people and institutions that most actively influence major investment decisions. Id.</p></blockquote>
<p>So far, so good. But where the author goes wrong is in his ruminations about the reasons such shenanigans go on. He thinks it is because regulations and tax laws are so complex.<br />
<blockquote>One often-overlooked lesson of the financial crisis is that shenanigans don’t happen in the absence of regulation; they happen when regulations are exceedingly complex and involve confusing, overlapping regulatory authorities.</p></blockquote>
<p>Pshaw. This is, quite simply, garbage regulatory mythology. Shenanigans happen in brute force capitalism&#8211;the kind we&#8217;ve had in place for the last few decades&#8211;until there is one dominant beast who controls everything. Regulations ain&#8217;t the cause. </p>

<p>Every simple rule becomes an opportunity for &#8220;inventive&#8221; tax lawyers and those with wealth desirous of hiding it or evading taxes on it to come up with &#8220;creative&#8221; solutions that skip around, over, or under the law. When tax administrators find out what is going on, they can sometimes take immediate steps. Often it requires legislation and regulation, and in the time it takes to create the lock on the door that the evaders broke through, lots of taxes have been evaded. And as soon as the lock goes on, the inventive tax lawyers and wealthy tax evaders get busy at their manipulative game again. So there is a spiral of complexity to deal with the problem caused by sophisticated taxpayers seeking sophisticated help to avoid or evade taxes.</p>
<p>This &#8220;regulations and complexity are the cause of offshoring and tax cheating&#8221; nonsense sounds about like the 2001 arguments made by many on the corporatist right for reducing tax rates. First, the proponents of lower taxes noted that there was a considerable amount of cheating via tax shelters by the wealthy and big corporations. Then, the illogical next step was taken: if only the wealthy just had to pay a little less in taxes, they&#8217;d be good citizens and quit using tax shelters, the Republican head of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress_Joint_Economic_Committee">Joint Economic Committee</a> opined. HA. If you lower the rate today, the greedy ones just demand a lower rate than that the next day. We&#8217;ve seen that play out as the corporate lobbyists got a twenty-year-long wish list fulfilled in the 2003 Bush tax cuts, then came back for more the next year and the next (and are still demanding even more today).</p>

                                <p>Update:  (hat tip Robert Waldmann)   <a href="http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=112&#038;session=2&#038;vote=00184" target="_blank">Senate.gov voting record on middle class tax cut bill</a></p>
<p>Excerpted from Linda Beale&#8217;s piece (7/25) on the numbers for the action taken by the Senate: </p>
<p>&#8230;After threatening to filibuster the Obama tax cut proposal, Mitch CcConnell pulled back.  See Lori Montgomery, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/mcconnell-pulls-back-from-filibuster-on-senate-tax-cut-vote/2012/07/25/gJQAxGpL9W_story.html?wpisrc=nl_pmpolitics">McConnell pulls back from filibuster on Senate tax-cut vote</a>, Washington Post, July 25, 2012. The Republicans want to pass a deficit-expanding tax cut for the wealthiest Americans who have garnered the most from this lopsided economy in which companies lay off workers to diminish service but achieve ever greater (short-term?) profit margins for those at the top. </p>
<p>(Aside:  That&#8217;s not the only way that megacorporations are trying to syphon off all the productivity gains for the few at the top.  See the story about a bank analyst&#8217;s conclusion that Wells Fargo was making more money for shareholders by providing lousier service to its customers.  Nathaniel Popper, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/25/business/bank-analyst-sees-no-payoff-in-customer-focus.html">Bank Analyst Sees No Payoff in Customer Friendly Focus</a>, New York Times (July 24, 2012).)<br />If the Bush tax cuts were to be extended without modification (as the GOP proposal would have it), the average reduction in taxes for Americans in the three lower quintiles (who make less than 75 thousand a year) would be considerably less than $1000.  See Citizens for Tax Justice, <a href="http://www.ctj.org/bushtaxcuts2012/us.pdf">U.S. Taxpayers and the Bush Tax Cuts: Obama&#8217;s Approach vs. Congressional GOP&#8217;s Approach</a> (July  2012).  So the typical American who earns between 40 and 50 thousand dollars a year will get less than a thousand dollars from an extension of the Bush tax cuts. </p>
<p>Compare the result for the wealthiest Americans under the GOP proposal. </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Another year of the Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest taxpayers in the richest 1% would give them an average tax cut of about $71,000.  See Citizens for Tax Justice, <a href="http://www.ctj.org/bushtaxcuts2012/us.pdf">U.S. Taxpayers and the Bush Tax Cuts: Obama&#8217;s Approach vs. Congressional GOP&#8217;s Approach</a> (July  2012).   That means that the Republican plan gives a 7000% larger tax cut to the wealthy than to those ordinary folk making 40-50 thousand. </p>
<p>Note that the wealthy still get a tax cut of about $20,000, even under Obama&#8217;s plan to cut the additional breaks at $250,000.  That&#8217;s because of the way the graduated income tax brackets work.  Everybody&#8211;rich or poor&#8211;is taxed at the 10% rate on the first $17,400 of income in 2012.  Everybody, rich or poor, is taxed at the 15% rate on any income they earn above $17,400 up to $70,700.   The rate increases to 25% for income in excess of $70,700 up to $142,700 (already in the upper middle class quintile) and to 28% for income above that up to $217,m450, with the rate going to 33% on the excess up to 388,350 (obviously now we&#8217;re talking about only the marginal income earned by the wealthy) and then 35% on the excess above that, to whatever millions or billions it may reach.  Accordingly, the very wealthiest millionaries would get the same tax break ordinary folk do on the income they receive in the lower rate brackets up to $250,000.  And as a result, only 1.9%&#8211;the very few richest Americans in the ultra-elite&#8211;would have less of a tax cut than otherwise under the Obama proposal.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s Romney Got to Hide? (Part III)</p>
<p>In the last two posts, I explored a number of fairly simple questions that might be raised about Romney&#8217;s activities that would be clarified by seeing multiple returns (hobby versus investment/business losses; business versus passive activity losses; amounts of preferentially taxed income; income reported from Bain Capital and/or from foreign accounts) and some of the &#8220;squirrelier&#8221; possibilities that tax experts have raised (potential that Romney participated in the IRS voluntary disclosure &#8220;amnesty&#8221; program for reports on offshore accounts after the initiation of unraveling of Swiss banking secrecy as a result of the UBS scandal, in order to avoid weightier penalties, including potential criminal charges; contributions to IRAs that were undervalued, possibly by claiming zero value for partnership interests; use of aggressive tax sheltering transactions to &#8216;create&#8217; capital losses to offset substantial capital gains, resulting in the net capital loss carryforward on the 2010 tax return).</p>
<p>Ed Kleinbard, a former partner at Cleary Gottlieb who served as chief of staff for the JCT and is now a law professor at Southern California, has joined with Peter Canellos, a prominent tax practitioner and former chair of the prestigious New York State Bar Association Tax Section, to address these issues regarding the importance of seeing multiple past years of Romney&#8217;s tax returns.  See Kleinbard &#038; Canellos,<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/07/18/opinion/kleinbard-canellos-romney-tax/index.html?hpt=hp_c1">Why won&#8217;t Romney release more tax returns?, </a>CNN (July 18, 2012).  Hat tip Calvin Johnson.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>So what do Kleinbard and Canellos add to this debate?  Perhaps most importantly, they note the importance of transparency in the vetting of presidential candidates :  as they say, &#8220;[t]he U.S. presidency is a position of immense magnitude and requires a thorough vetting.&#8221; (emphasis added)  Accordingly, they point out the advantage to the American public of the disclosure practice initiated by Romney&#8217;s father George Romney four decades ago and .<br />
<blockquote>Since George Romney inaugurated the practice more than 40 years ago by releasing 12 years of tax returns in his bid for the Republican Party nomination, presidential nominees have been transparent with voters about their personal finances. For this reason, we have not suffered a significant tax scandal involving a nominee or sitting president since President Richard Nixon&#8217;s abuse of the tax code.<br />***<br />Disclosure goes to the heart of the truthfulness with which a nominee engages the American people, and it assures us that he in fact has comported himself before the election with the high moral character we associate with a future president.<br />***<br />What the American people deserve is a complete and honest presentation by Romney of how his wealth was accumulated, where it is now invested, what purpose is served by all the various offshore vehicles in which he has an interest and what his financial relationship with Bain Capital has been since his retirement from the company. These are all factors that go to the heart of his character and values.</p></blockquote>
<p>Like the rest of us who have discussed this issue, Kleinbard and Canellos note that it is Romney&#8217;s abject refusal to follow his father&#8217;s example and disclose a decade&#8217;s worth of returns that &#8220;undermines the assumption&#8221; that would otherwise apply &#8220;that there cannot be any tax skeletons in his closet.&#8221;  Our only tool is to &#8220;reconstruct his financial record&#8221; from what he has released.  And that leads us to &#8220;red flags that raise serious tax compliance questions with respect to his possible tax minimization strategies in earlier years.&#8221;  Disclosure, they note, could &#8220;replace speculation with truth-telling.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kleinbard and Canellos go on to discuss some key issues (some already addressed in prior posts)
<ul>
<li><strong>the Swiss bank account:</strong> Why would a presidential nominee be betting against the US dollar by speculating in Swiss Francs?  The account was closed in 2010, but was its income reported on earlier returns and were the FBAR reports timely filed as required? Did the Romneys participate in the 2009 partial tax amnesty for unreported offshore accounts? </li>
<li><strong>the $100 million IRA</strong>: How could an account restricted to annual contributions of $30,000 grow to $100 million? Does it represent &#8220;unprecedented prescience in &#8230; Romney&#8217;s investment choices&#8221; or does it mean that &#8220;Romney stuffed far more into his retirement plans each year than the maximum allowed by law by claiming that the stock of the Bain company deals that the reitrement plan acquired had only a nominal value&#8221; (relying on a safe harbor rule about taxation of service partner&#8217;s receipt of such interests that is, however, inapplicable to contributions of those interests to a retirement plan)? </li>
<li><strong>the Romney family trusts</strong>:  &#8220;Did Romney report and pay gift tax &#8230; or did he claim similarly unreasonable valuations, which likewise would have exposed him to serious penalties if all the facts were known? </li>
<li><strong>the complexity of Romney&#8217;s assets</strong>:  even multiple years of returns won&#8217;t answer all these questions given the &#8220;complexity&#8221; and &#8220;arcane&#8221; and &#8220;opaque&#8221; nature of Romney&#8217;s financial affairs, so disclosure about specific issues, such as the $100 million IRA, will be needed </li>
<li><strong>the low Romney tax rate</strong>:  a tax rate of 13.9% on $22 million is exceedingly low&#8211;lower than the rate paid by ordinary American wage-earners making 40-50 thousand a year.  How can we trust Romney to enact wise policy&#8211;which the vast majority of tax experts concur is to remove the super-preferential rate on the compensation income of private equity fund managers?  &#8220;Romney has not explained how, as president, he can bring objectivity to bear on this tax loophole that is estimated as costing all of us billions of dollars every year.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>Will Romney respond to these continuing calls for full disclosure about how his wealth has been built, where it is invested, and just what purpose the various offshore entities serve?  If he does not, we can only think the worst. <br />crossposted with <a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2012/07/whats-romney-got-to-hide-part-iii.html">ataxingmatter</a></p>

<p>What&#8217;s Romney Got to Hide? It&#8217;s past time for financial and tax transparency</p>
<p>As everybody who has followed anything about this election cycle knows, Mitt Romney&#8211;likely the wealthiest man to run for president, the only bankster/private equity fund founder (sole shareholder, CEO and manager) to run for president, and probably the only person with multiple multi-million dollar accounts stashed away in tax havens like Bermuda, Cayman Islands and Swiss banks to run for president&#8211;still thinks the kinds of information that one can glean from full disclosure of tax returns isn&#8217;t relevant to his attempt to gain the presidency.  He has reiterated his refusal to release more than the 2010 and (estimated, at this point) 2011 returns.</p>
<p>Yet there are many questions voters can legitimately ask about Romney&#8217;s finances and tax returns, questions that cannot be answered with certainty without seeing multiple years of returns.  Let&#8217;s consider the most obvious ones.</p>
<p>1. Offshoring of assets:   It is clear from the paucity of return information we do have that the Romneys hold a considerable portion of their assets offshore.  It is not unreasonable to wonder why someone who desires to be President of the US would find it necessary or even reasonable to put so much of his (or their) assets offshore, taking them out of the US.  Clearly, offshore assets are harder to trace, harder to account for, and possibly easier to hide from tax administrators but one would certainly hope that wouldn&#8217;t be the reason behind a very wealthy candidate&#8217;s use of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offshore_bank">offshore accounts</a>.  Just as clearly, the fact of offshore multimillion dollar accounts does not establish tax avoidance, since Romney could be appropriately reporting and paying taxes on all of his foreign holdings.  Yet the fact that it is not illegal per se to hold assets offshore begs the question that does count&#8211; why is he holding so much in offshore accounts?  What&#8217;s the benefit to him?  If he is as patriotic as he claims, why doesn&#8217;t he show that by putting his assets in the US, in essence &#8220;putting his money where his mouth is&#8221;?  If he can&#8217;t clearly explain to voters what the reasonable benefit to him is of having assets stashed offshore, then voters may draw the conclusion that he has something to hide.</p>
<p>2. Hobby horses?:  Like many of the ultra wealthy, the Romneys have enough money to engage in whatever pastimes and pleasures they like&#8211;they can own an expensive horse, arrange for it to be pastured and cared for near one of their many multimillion-dollar residences, and even ship it overseas (costing tens of thousands of dollars) for participation in sporting events.  The question this raises for ordinary Americans is how do the Romneys treat this activity on their tax returns, and is that treatment justifiable under the rules? </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>There are rules for activities that are &#8220;not engaged in for profit&#8221; under section 183 (generally called the hobby loss provision), that allow participants to deduct hobby expenses only to the extent of income from the hobby activity.  Activities engaged in for profit include active conduct of businesses and investment activities.  Everything else falls under this hobby provision, which amounts to a truly generous provision for mostly wealthy households who can afford to buy expensive toys that allow them to sometimes earn related income&#8211;Ie, this provision covers consumption that one engages in for personal enjoyment rather than for the potential profits.  There is a test requiring profits in 3 out of 5 years  (4 out of 7 for activities involving horses) to escape the hobby provision.  So voters can rightly wonder whether the Romney&#8217;s treat their costs for their horseshow competitions as a business.  (This is the same question tax experts had about <a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2012/05/hobby-losses-section-183-benefits-the-wealthy.html">Todd Palin</a>&#8216;s claim that his snowmobile racing was a business even though there appeared to be a good deal of circumstancial evidence that it was instead merely a pleasurable sports activity/hobby.)   To know whether not treating such activities as hobbies under section 183 is correct, one needs to see at least 5 consecutive years of tax returns:  there simply is insufficient information without that. </p>
<p>3.  Passive activities?  The same type of activities that raise questions about the categorization as hobby or business/investment also potentially raise questions about the passive activity rules. Section 469 limits the ability of taxpayers to use &#8220;passive activity losses&#8221; against other income, such as that from businesses actively conducted by the taxpayer (including salaries from the business of being an employee).  Generally, losses from passive investments are &#8220;schedularized&#8221;, meaning that they are generally allowed only against passive income (there are exceptions).  It would be useful, again, to see multiple years of returns in order to reach a comfortable conclusion about the way the Romneys&#8217; various activities fall within these rules (or not).  </p>
<p>4. Retirement accounts?  One question making waves is how a retirement account for which strict contribution limitations apply could possibly have a value of more than $100 million today if only about $30,000 of assets was put in just a decade ago.  See, e.g., Felix Salmon, Opinion: Did Romney put Bain Capital shares in his IRA? Reuters, July 16, 2012 (noting comments by Bill Cohan, Nicholas Shaxson).  We all know that our retirement accounts (generally created with cash contributions from our salaries) have tended to lose money, not gain&#8211;and certainly most Americans&#8217; retirement accounts haven&#8217;t gained at those astronomical levels.  So voters could reasonably ask what assets were added to that account that could have increased in worth so significantly in such a short period of time.  Without the release and more disclosure of such information, voters might reasonably be suspicious that assets were knowingly undervalued upon being added, with the knowledge that their actual fair market value would show significant amounts attributable to earnings within the account. </p>
<p>The Salmon article cited above mentions a theory that the retirement accounts were &#8220;pumped with risky A shares in Bain, that &#8220;often had aggressively low valuations when they were first issued&#8221; and could &#8220;create issues at an IRS audit.&#8221;   Salmon proposes instead that Romney loaded his IRAs  with his own shares in Bain, of which he remained sole owner and CEO until 2002.  Salmon seems to be suggesting it was not just at the beginning, when he could likely reasonably claim a zero value, but annually thereafter:  he notes that &#8220;Romney would have had every incentive to keep the official valuation of Bain Capital low for many years, since the lower Bain Capital was wroth, the more of it he could put into his retirement accounts every year.  Again, the IRS might well be interested in the valuation techniques Romney used for  the purposes of his retirement account contributions.  And then &#8230; when Romney left Bain, he would have switched from minimizing Bain Capital&#8217;s official value to maximizing it.&#8221;  Id. </p>
<p>Another theory mentioned in the article is the tendency of investors in partnerships to undervalue interests when first putting them into an IRA, under the argument [labelled as &#8220;dubious&#8221; by Salmon, since all securities represent future income] that partnership interests merely represent future income, not current value.  Salmon notes that an &#8220;aggressive tax lawyer&#8221; might make such an approach &#8220;possible.&#8221;<br />It is likely that the retirement accounts were funded early on with Romney&#8217;s shares in Bain, before it was obvious for tax purposes that it would be a hugely profitable enterprise.  Thus, it would seem that Romney would benefit measurably from transparency here, since there is otherwise reasonable cause for continuing speculation about potential intentional undervaluations of contributed assets.</p>
<p>There are many other questions voters could reasonable explore about the way such an ultra wealthy presidential candidate shares the burden of taxation with ordinary voters, such as how much of Romney&#8217;s income is consistently earned in carried interest, dividends, and capital gains, all of which enjoy an extraordinarily favorable preferential tax rate under the Bush tax cuts, or how much of Romney&#8217;s income is outright excluded under generous tax expenditure provisions governing certain financial products purchased primarily (or exclusively) by the rich, such as muni bonds.  A voter might also like to see how the 1999 through 2002 tax returns show income from <a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2012/07/tax-policy-center-on-cutting-tax-preferences-to-lower-tax-rates-aka-romneys-plan.html">Bain Capital</a>, during the period that Romney remained CEO and signed off on important SEC and tax documents but now claims he was retroactively retired and therefore completely out of the loop on the very deals and decisions he was signing off on.  (Would you want to invest in that business if you knew that about it at the time?) </p>
<p>Romney says he won&#8217;t release any more tax returns.  His adviser says no matter how many he released, it wouldn&#8217;t be enough.  See David Muir, <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/07/romney-adviser-no-matter-how-many-tax-returns-romney-releases-it-wont-be-enough/">Romney Adviser: No Matter How Many Tax Returns</a>, ABC News.com (July 16, 2012).  That excuse for nonrelease is clearly just that&#8211;an excuse.  Nobody demands a lifetime of returns.  Romney&#8217;s father set a good precedent with 12 years, which would be especially reasonable here since it would show Romney&#8217;s returns for those disputed turn of the century years.  <br />Romney seems to be saying just &#8220;trust me&#8221; that everything is above board and everything filed correctly and that voters have no reason to be interested in any of the details of how he holds his assets or how he manages them or what he claims about his various activities on his tax returns. </p>
<p>But that&#8217;s a little like his assertion that voters don&#8217;t have any reason to have questions about his &#8220;retroactive retirement&#8221; from Bain Capital, for which he signed federally required SEC and tax forms as sole shareholder and CEO for years after he now claims he had quit paying any attention to company decisions.  Clearly, voters should have an interest in assessing for themselves the extent of Romney&#8217;s offshoring, the way he has filed on his expensive hobbies, and whether those filings&#8211;even if they are entirely accurate, as hopefully they are&#8211; give him tax advantages that ordinary people have no access to.  </p>
<p>It is telling that even staunch right-winger George Will &#8220;slammed&#8221; Romney on this issue, saying &#8220;Romney &#8216;must have calculated that there are higher costs in releasing them.'&#8221; George Stephanopoulos, <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/07/george-will-matthew-dowd-blast-romney-for-not-releasing-tax-returns/">George Will, Matthew Dowd Blast Romney for not Releasing Tax Returns</a>, ABC News.com (July 15, 2012).<br />After all, <strong>in 2008 McCain apparently requested&#8211;and received&#8211;two decades&#8217; worth of Romney tax returns as part of the Veep vetting process</strong>.  George Stephanopoulos, <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/07/george-will-matthew-dowd-blast-romney-for-not-releasing-tax-returns/">George Will, Matthew Dowd Blast Romney for not Releasing Tax Returns</a>, ABC News.com, July 15, 2012 (noting that Romney reportedly provided 23 years of tax returns to the McCain campaign in 2008). </p>
<p>The fact that McCain commented today that his choice of Sarah Palin over Romney had nothing to do with anything on the returns but rather with Palin&#8217;s superior candidacy is irrelevant, since we cannot know whether the campaign could or did make a thorough analysis of those returns or how they weighed any issues they saw (or didn&#8217;t see).  See  <a href="http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2012/07/17/mccain-palin-was-better-vp-choice-than-romney-in-2008/">McCain: Palin was better VP choice than Romney in 2008</a>, CNN, July 17, 2012.   <strong>What any voter can reasonably say is this:  If it was reasonable for McCain to view more than a couple of years of tax returns to reach an assessment of potential issues that might affect the electibility of the man (presumably issues relating to character, honesty, business and investment skills, philosophy, and patriotism), then it is also reasonable for American voters to do the same.</strong><br /><strong><br /></strong><br /><a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2012/07/whats-romney-got-to-hide-its-past-time-for-financial-and-tax-transparency.html">http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2012/07/whats-romney-got-to-hide-its-past-time-for-financial-and-tax-transparency.html</a></p>
