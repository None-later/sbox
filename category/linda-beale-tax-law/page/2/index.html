<p>S&#038;P faces civil charges for mortgage bond ratings</p>
<p>The Justice Department&#8217;s efforts to reach a settlement with Standard &#038; Poor&#8217;s Rating Services about the ratings provided to mortgage bonds leading up to the financial crisis have failed, and it appears that civil charges will be filed by the Justice Department and state prosecutors.  See<a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/02/04/u-s-and-states-prepare-to-sue-s-p-over-mortgage-ratings/?emc=na%20"> S&#038;P says it expects U.S. civil suit over mortgage bond ratings</a>, New York Times (Feb. 4, 2013).</p>
<p>The suit is expected to be brought in California and focus on about 30 collateralized debt obligation deals (commonly known as &#8220;CDOs&#8221;) executed in 2007 at the height of the mortgage bubble.  The Justice Department has apparently seen &#8220;troves&#8221; of damaging emails among S&#038;P employees.<br />S&#038;P claims the suit is meritless, using hindsight to pinpoint a cause that wasn&#8217;t understood at the time.  McGraw-Hill, S&#038;P&#8217;s parent company, lost 14% of its value after the announcement.</p>

<p>Red state tax &#8220;reform&#8221; and &#8220;economic growth&#8221;</p>
<p>As most tax practitioners and academics know, Professor Paul Caron maintains a &#8220;tax prof blog&#8221; that provides timely links to most things tax in major papers, blogs, journals, conferences and the like, as well as announcements and releases from the<a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2013/01/state-tax-reform-and-economic-growth.html#">IRS</a>, Treasury and Congress related to tax.  Paul does not usually provide much analysis or opinion, but rather an excerpt or two and a title.</p>
<p>So a recent blog post was titled  &#8220;<a href="http://taxprof.typepad.com/taxprof_blog/2013/01/states-turn-.html">WSJ: States Embrace Tax Reform to Drive Economic Growth</a>&#8220;.</p>
<p>This is not an atypical way of titling items on tax prof blog.  The observant reader will notice a slight bias in the title.  The Wall Street Journal article is actually titled &#8220;<a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323968304578245720280333676.html?mod=djemEditorialPage_h">The State Tax Reformers: more governors look to repeal their income taxes</a>&#8221; (Jan 29 2013 updated).  The article summarizes states that are lowering or eliminating their income tax (sometimes including their corporate <a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2013/01/state-tax-reform-and-economic-growth.html#">income taxes</a>) and sometimes replacing it with a broad sales tax&#8211;for example, in the Republican strongholds of Nebraska and Louisiana.  The Journal article then goes on to opine (and it is indeed opinion) that &#8220;this swap makes sense&#8221; because &#8220;income taxes generally do more economic harm because they are a direct penalty on saving, investment and labor that create new wealth&#8221; whereas &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sales_tax">sales taxes</a> &#8230; hit consumption, which is the result of that wealth creation.&#8221;  This is the typical &#8220;free market&#8221; pitch favoring capital income (and the rich) over labor income (and everybody else). </p>
<p>Of course, the Journal then proceeds to quote <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Laffer">Art Laffer</a> for the right-wing corporatist ALEC in an article claiming that a majority of new jobs are created in states without an <a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2013/01/state-tax-reform-and-economic-growth.html#">income tax</a> because of their lack of an income tax.<br />[Aside:  Laffer is (in)famous as the &#8216;free market&#8217; economist who described his view of the maximum tax rate by drawing a bell curve on a napkin.  The Laffer Curve is more ideology than theory, as I explain in an earlier post:  <a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2008/02/cfps-laffer-cur.html">CFP&#8217;s Laffer Curve Video</a>, ataxingmatter (Feb. 2008). ]</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, Caron&#8217;s title suggests that the &#8220;real&#8221; policy reason for the shift is a &#8220;real&#8221; desire to create jobs. </p>
<p>I have significant doubts.  Most of the anti-income tax proponents are pro-Big Business and pro-wealth.  A shift from an income tax to a consumption/sales tax is a move from a somewhat (often minimally) progressive tax system to an explicitly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regressive_tax">regressive tax</a> system.  Such a move favors those with capital assets and mainly capital income.  Claims (like that made by the Civitas Institute cited in the Journal article) that shifting from income tax to sales tax will result in &#8220;average annual personal income growth&#8221; mean almost nothing since averaging income growth across a population doesn&#8217;t really tell you whether almost all of it goes to the wealthy or not&#8211;if that growth goes to those already in the wealthy distribution, then inequality increases and in fact most everybody else is worse off, in spite of the &#8220;average&#8221; growth.</p>
<p>The Journal acknowledges the regressive nature of a sales tax swap, but suggests that exemptions of necessities (e.g., food, medicine, utilities) and rebates for low-income families will suffice.  I also find that doubtful&#8211;the very low absolute benefit to the poor of the exemptions and/or rebates, while important, is substantially less than the very real high absolute benefit to the wealthy of the switch to a consumption rather than income tax.  Accordingly, the so-called &#8220;reform&#8221; will inevitably increase an already devastingly problematic inequality that has resulted in lower quality of life for most Americans on many different areas from literacy to access to <a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2013/01/state-tax-reform-and-economic-growth.html#">health care</a> to teenage pregnancy to death rates and all the many other factors in which Americans enjoy a lower level of quality of life than most other OECD nations. </p>
<p>Not, in other words, a good idea.  As noted in Nick Carnes (who teaches at Duke University), <a href="http://www.newsobserver.com/2013/01/24/2630904/a-tax-reform-plan-that-rewards.html">A Tax-Reform Plan that Rewards the Wealthy and Stalls the State</a>, NewsObserver.com (Jan 24, 2013, modified Jan. 25, 2013), these proposals are being pushed by right-wing propaganda tanks, including a &#8220;<i>wealthy conservative foundation [that] has paid [Arthur] Laffer to write another report and to fly to our state to  promote it.</i>&#8221;  Id. </p>
<p>The goups behind these proposals have their one-size-fits-all state-level strategy down to a science, but they don’t have a handle on the actual science of state tax reform. It’s easy to see why their ideas are appealing. Who wouldn’t like to grow our economy and lower taxes without cutting vital services like schools and public safety?</p>
<p>However, independent economists in every state where the Laffer plan has been introduced – including North Carolina – have found serious problems with the evidence its proponents have used to back it up. No matter how low the tax rate is, businesses and wealthy people won’t relocate to a state where the schools are bad, the streets are unsafe and the infrastructure is crumbling – things that all tend to happen when taxes are cut to the levels that the Laffer plan outlines.  Id.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Carnes article goes on to note that &#8220;Kansas, which earlier passed the Laffer bill, is now projecting $800 million annual budget deficits and has extended an emergency sales tax that should have expired years ago&#8221; while state agencies are facing a 10% across the board cut, with education expected to lose a billion dollars in state funding over the next five years.  Yet no businesses have flocked to Kansas because of the legislation.  Id.</p></blockquote>
<p>And guess what.  It is the wealthy who would benefit if North Carolina were to carry through with enacting its own form of the &#8220;Laffer bill&#8221;.  Carnes notes that families earning $24,000 a year would pay $500 MORE in taxes under the Laffer plan, whereas wealthy families with incomes of more than $900,000 a year would pay $42,000 LESS in taxes.  Id. Shifting the tax burden from the wealthy who can easily bear it to the low-income who cannot, while at the same time cutting government support for essential public services that build a shared community is a disaster in the making.</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal isn&#8217;t flummoxed by such facts (which it doesn&#8217;t even acknowledge).  The Journal article suggests that the idea (set forth in some Big Oil/Fracking states) of replacing income taxes with revenues from oil and gas extraction would be good (and maybe better than regressive sales taxes) because &#8220;it would make everyone a stakeholder&#8221; in increased drilling and fracking, thus &#8220;help[ing] to build a politicial constituency for more mining and drilling.&#8221;  Note the presupposition that supporting &#8220;more mining and more drilling&#8221; is inherently a public good! (One assumes that the Journal staff think this because Big Oil/Big Gas is Big Business, and the Journal is ALWAYS in favor of whatever Big Business wants.) </p>
<p>That idea strikes me as truly worrisome&#8211;we have a climate-change problem, and trying to &#8220;buy&#8221; votes to support environmental degradation at whatever cost through the swap of income taxes for some (probably minimal) increased royalties (probably also accompanied by less in the way of services, especially for the poor or for public goods like public education) is not a good idea.  Yes, probably those very people who are the poorest and most harmed by environmental degradation would tend to be able to be bought off by that swap&#8211;they would not realize that the wealthy are again getting the mountain of the share of the benefit, and they are bearing most of the burden in terms of the long-term costs of the environmental degradation as well as the long-term costs of lower public revenues spent on programs especially important to them because of their lack of a cushion of wealth (schools, public parks, fire/police, health care, etc.).</p>
<p>Interestingly, the Journal article notes that Alaska got rid of its income tax in the 1980s and suggests that&#8217;s been a good deal.  Of course, Alaska also gets more back from the Federal government than it gives in Federal taxes&#8211;ie, Alaskans have replaced their income tax revenues with federal handouts.</p>
<p>The Journal calls these plans for revamping state laws to provide substantial benefits to wealthy individuals and corporations a &#8220;rare bright spot in the current high-tax era.&#8221;  That is garbage from both sides.  We do not live in a &#8220;high-tax era.&#8221;  IN fact, we live in a low-tax era and we are already paying for that with the significant drop in state support for higher education, state support for parks and other public amenities (police and fire protection, protections for workers, fair and easy access to voting, etc.), and state support for K-12 education as well as the failure of the federal government to fund the kinds of infrastructure and education and basic research projects that could make the difference between a continuing great economy and the continuing muddle we are in after the Bush recession. </p>
<p>All of those costs are borne more substantially by those in the lower-income brackets.  With the proposed &#8220;reforms&#8221;, the wealthy will be sailing through with even more wealth, able to shut out even more effectively any association with the &#8220;lower class&#8221; elements and giving even less to support schools, colleges, unemployment benefits, etc.  Meanwhile, the poor and near-poor will get much, much less (when they didn&#8217;t owe much in taxes anyway).  Not a bright spot at all.  More like class warfare.</p>
<p>The real reason behind these shifts is to benefit the major members of the Republican base&#8211;i.e., Big Business and the wealthy.  It has little to do with jobs&#8230;  That&#8217;s just a handy obfuscating claim to make about policy moves that substantially shift the benefits of the economic system to the rich and the burdens of the economic system to everyone else.  This is just another element of the class warfare that has been waged for the last few decades to allocate gains to the wealthy.</p>

<p>Dell restructuring&#8211;all for a tax advantage?</p>
<p>David Cay Johnston writes for Tax Analysts, in <a href="http://taxanalysts.com/www/features.nsf/Articles/D8A55EFE6CF17A3885257B01006D4565?OpenDocument"> Dell&#8217;s Multiple Restructurings Aid It in Tax Avoidance</a> (2013), about a global reorganization disclosed by Dell in its January 2007 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Form_8-K">Form 8-K</a> filed with the SEC:  &#8220;just before the end of 2006, [Dell] issued more than 475 million shares worth $12 billion to invest in a subsidiary.&#8221;  In the Form 8-k, Dell notes that &#8220;Dell has modified the corporate structure of certain of its subsidiaries to achieve more integrated global operations and to provide various financial, operational and tax efficiencies&#8221;  (as quoted in the Johnston article).<br />
<blockquote>What Dell did was remake itself in a way that lets it escape taxes on profits earned in the United States by running them through a Netherlands entity and newly formed subsidiaries in Singapore and the Cayman Islands.</p>
<p>Dell later quietly dropped the Singapore and Cayman Islands entities in what appears to be a pattern of remaking its corporate structure every few years. This nuanced timing pattern may have great significance as a tool for tax avoidance because <a href="http://www.irs.gov/">IRS</a> corporate audit practices were established on the assumption that companies tend to have stable structures. The IRS rarely audits newly formed entities.</p>
<p>The documents suggest that Dell created companies with no apparent purpose except to funnel profits into jurisdictions where they would be untaxed. In some cases, subsidiary names existed for a day or so and then were changed to the names of existing entities. The company shuffled its subsidiaries like a deck of cards &#8212; a deck stacked against shareholders and the IRS.</p>
<p>Sometimes the deals used companies with identical addresses, suggesting circular flows in which what would be taxable profits in the United States were run through offshore entities with no discernible purpose except escaping tax.  Id.</p></blockquote>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Describing the work of a couple who sleuthed through Dell&#8217;s state filings and court papers to examine its tax compliance, Johnston reports:<br />
<blockquote>Before one restructuring, Dell Inc. sold products to domestic customers through Dell Catalog Sales Corp., which shared the same address in Texas.<br />The couple distilled from annual corporate ownership and sales tax filings with state governments, as well as stipulations in various civil lawsuits, that Dell then replaced this simple organizational structure with a hierarchy of tax haven holding companies.</p>
<p>In all, Dell inserted four new companies between the parent and operating entities, which use the same Texas street address.</p>
<p>The result was that a Texas company reported to a Netherlands company that reported to a Singapore company that reported to a Caymans company that reported to what appears to be another Netherlands company that then reported back to the Texas headquarters.</p>
<p>This makes business sense? I cannot fathom how &#8212; except to escape taxes.</p></blockquote>
<p>And because Dell publicly discloses its untaxed offshore profits and the expected tax rate upon repatriation of those profits, those numbers support the suggestion that the elaborate creation (and killing) of subsidiaries has one primary purpose&#8211;the reduction of taxes owed to the US.</p>
<blockquote><p>Citizens for Tax Justice, in a report last year (<em>Doc 2012-21457</em> , <em>2012 TNT 202-22</em>), noted that Dell is one of the few multinationals that discloses how much untaxed profits it holds offshore and the expected tax rate if it brought the money back to the United States.</p>
<p>Dell said it had $15.9 billion of untaxed profits offshore on which it would owe a tax of $5.2 billion, or 33 percent. Since that is almost equal to the 35 percent corporate tax rate, it suggests Dell paid virtually no tax anywhere in the world on those profits, because Congress gives a dollar-for-dollar tax credit on corporate income taxes imposed by other countries.</p></blockquote>
<p>So what, Johnston asks, is the public benefit of allowing this kind of corporate shell game?  He suggests that for shareholders, the question is whether they are being told enough to evaluate the risks and rewards of holding Dell securities.  And he concludes probably not.  For the IRS, it is whether regular audit techniques will miss what they should catch. And again, he wonders if the IRS policy of letting companies know what will be audited, sticking to those points, and completing audits in fixed time periods isn&#8217;t just a giveway to those who are manipulating their tax rates.  Dell&#8217;s tax counsel, he notes, would undoubtedly advise that they have reviewed each reorganization step and that they are perfectly legal.  </p>
<p>But Johnston wants an audit, and one that looks at the whay sophisticated companies are adept at working around audit policies.  Dell&#8217;s reorganizations, he says, are apparently timed at two-year intervals, injecting considerable complexity into the work of any IRS auditor trying to track their impact. And &#8220;the business purpose for this management structure is elusive&#8221;, he notes, on one set of slides showing a shuffle of entities that ultimately lands a company still located in Texas under a foreign sandwich of companies and ultimately avoiding US tax on the operating company income. He surmises that Dell owes a billion or more in US corporate income taxes that have escaped capture because of this endless restructuring.</p>

<p>The Netherlands&#8217; role as corporate tax haven a &#8220;stain on the nation&#8217;s reputation&#8221;</p>
<p>As Europe, the US, and other countries continue to face sluggish economies in the midst of extraordinarily high corporate profits, substantial accumulation of new wealth in the hands of even fewer people, and inordinate influence of corporatist approaches on democratic governance, a public backlash is growing and legislatures are beginning to notice.</p>
<p>Here in the US, President Obama&#8217;s second inauguration speech acknowledged the necessity of cooperative approaches to the dire problems we face today.  Those problems&#8211; poverty, limited opportunity due to lowerclass status, lack of educational access, climate change and infrastructure needs&#8211;all relate to the increasing inequality among our people, the ability of the wealthy to buy secure and safe lifestyles for themselves while the majority are left to struggle with potential loss of jobs, homes and health.  People are starting to notice the inordinate power of huge multinational corporations and their owners due to the influence of wealth and the way the wealthy have been able to capture almost all of the gains of the last few decades for themselves.  Perhaps we are on the cusp of a new populism that will reclaim the American economy and the American system for ordinary people.</p>
<p>In the Netherlands, the backlash against unfair tax policies may be happening even more clearly than here.  The Netherlands has become an infamous tax haven for corporate giants (renowned for using the &#8220;Dutch sandwich&#8221; structure to avoid taxation).  Yahoo&#8217;s arrangement, described by Jesse Drucker in a Bloomberg story today, illustrates the problem perfectly.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Inside Reindert Dooves’ home, a 17th century, three-story converted warehouse along the Zaan canal in suburban Amsterdam, a 21st-century Internet giant is avoiding taxes.  The bookkeeper’s home office doubles as the headquarters for a Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) offshore unit. Through this sun-filled, white walled room, Yahoo has taken advantage of the law to quietly funnel hundreds of millions of dollars in global profits to island subsidiaries, cutting its worldwide tax bill.<br />The Yahoo arrangement illustrates that the Netherlands, in the heart of a continent better known for social welfare than corporate welfare, has emerged as one of the most important tax havens for multinational companies.</p>
<p>Jesse Drucker, <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-01-23/yahoo-dell-swell-netherlands-13-trillion-tax-haven.html">Yahoo, Dell Swell Netherlands $13 Trillion Tax Haven</a>, Bloomberg.com (Jan. 23, 2013).  Many of the Dutch companies created by MNEs like Yahoo, Google, Merck, and Dell are sham companies that &#8220;only exist on paper&#8221;.  $10.2 trillion dollars went through 14,300 of those sham companies in 2010. Id.  Merck has 54 subsidiaries in the Netherlands and routed more than 7 billion euros in royalties between 2002 and 2010 through an Amsterdam subsidiary that has no employees.  Id.</p>
<p>The Labour Party and People&#8217;s Party for Freedom and Democracy took power in November and are &#8220;fed up with these so-called PO Box companies&#8221;, according to a parliamentarian from Labour.  Id.  Another parliamentarian (from the Dutch Socialist Party) noted that while governments are cutting their budgets, multinationals are avoiding taxes, and the Netherlands is functioning as a connecter to the tax havens.</p>
<p>The anti-tax avoidance concern is growing across advanced nations. As the article notes, the European Commission, has also noted the problems with tax avoidance and evasion and has advised its member states to adopt anti-abuse rules.  Similarly, the OECD is discussing a proposal to make it harder for companies to use shams like the Dutch sandwich structure to shuffle profits into tax haven islands and avoid taxes in OECD countries.  And the UK has scheduled a second parliamentary hearing this month on the issue.  Id.</p>
<p>Tax treaties are supposed to protect companies from double taxation on the same income by two different jursidictions, but tax lawyers have developed sophisticated structures that allow companies to enjoy double non-taxation.  The article describes Dell&#8217;s use of a Netherlands subsidiary (with no Netherlands employees) to claim credit for about three-fourth&#8217;s of Dell&#8217;s worldwide income and achieve substantial tax savings&#8211;about $4 billion since 2004.  Id.  The US Is challenging Dell&#8217;s claim that it is appropriately using the Netherlands and Singapore arrangement to avoid US taxes.</p>
<p>And of course these same MNE giants are the ones that are accumulating billions overseas on which they are seeking special legislation to allow them to repatriate cash to the US at low (or negative) taxes. See earlier Angry Bear and ataxingmatter posts on this issue.</p>
<p>Hopefully, even the Republicans in Congress will realize that this corporate game of tax avoidance using international subsidiaries that have no employees is a sham and will take action to eliminate loopholes that permit hugely profitable companies to pay minimal corporate taxes.</p>

<p>Much of MNEs&#8217; &#8220;offshore&#8221; (and hence untaxed) cash hoards held onshore</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal, in its editorial pages a great friend to big business and low taxes for same, had a decent front-page article  on the corporate hoard of cash designated as &#8220;permanently invested offshore&#8221;.  In fact, much of that cash is sitting in U.S.-dollar-denominated assets in the good ole USA.  Nonetheless companies are permitted under the tax rules to claim that those profits are earned overseas and kept there.  See  Kate Limbaugh, <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323301104578255663224471212.html">Firms keep stockpiles of cash in U.S</a>., Wall St. J. (Jan 22, 2013).</p>
<p>Some companies, including Internet giant <a href="http://online.wsj.com/public/quotes/main.html?type=djn&#038;symbol=GOOG">Google</a> Inc., <a href="http://online.wsj.com/public/quotes/main.html?type=djn&#038;symbol=GOOG?mod=inlineTicker">GOOG +5.74%</a>software maker <a href="http://online.wsj.com/public/quotes/main.html?type=djn&#038;symbol=MSFT">Microsoft</a> Corp. <a href="http://online.wsj.com/public/quotes/main.html?type=djn&#038;symbol=MSFT?mod=inlineTicker">MSFT +1.36%</a>and data-storage specialist <a href="http://online.wsj.com/public/quotes/main.html?type=djn&#038;symbol=EMC">EMC</a> Corp.,<a href="http://online.wsj.com/public/quotes/main.html?type=djn&#038;symbol=EMC?mod=inlineTicker">EMC +1.03%</a>keep more than three-quarters of the cash owned by their foreign subsidiaries at U.S. banks, held in U.S. dollars or parked in U.S. government and corporate securities, according to people familiar with the companies&#8217; cash positions.</p>
<p>In the eyes of the law, the Internal Revenue Service and company executives, however, this money is overseas. As long as it doesn&#8217;t flow back to the U.S. parent company, the U.S. doesn&#8217;t tax it. And as long as it sits in U.S. bank accounts or in U.S. Treasurys, it is safer than if it were plowed into potentially risky foreign investments.</p>
<p>***<br /><a name="more"></a><br />Of course, the designation can be changed in an instant if the company is prepared to accept the tax bite.  United Technologies Corp., for instance, used $4 billion of such &#8220;permanently&#8221; reinvested funds held by foreign subsidiaries to help pay for last year&#8217;s acquisition of Goodrich Corp. Id.<br />That last quoted paragraph is a giveaway.  Thse foreign subsidiaires are controlled by the US MNE and have no real say in the ultimate use of the cash.  When the MNE wants it for something, it can get it in an instant.  As my colleague Calvin Johnson at University of Texas has noted, this &#8220;reinvorces the idea that a foreign sub is just a ledger entry, with no significance&#8221;  (email statement quoted with permission).</p>
<p>Meantime, these US-based MNEs are busy lobbying Congress to give them even more tax breaks.   They want a so-called territorial system or the ability to bring home their hoarded cash at low (or effectively negative) tax rates.   MNEs are married to the idea of pushing for paying nothing for the many ways the US economy has boosted their profits through tax expenditures and nothing for the many other ways in which the US system has increased their profits&#8211;both at home and abroad.</p>
<p>Remember that their owners already get an extraordinarily preferential rate of tax on dividends paid out to them (treated as net capital gains, recently made permanent in one of the sillier giveaways of the &#8220;deal&#8221; between Dems and Republicans on whether or not to let the Bush tax cuts expire as the Republicans originally wrote the bill) and on capital gains when they sell the shares.  The very low effective corporate tax rate&#8211;not infrequently a negative rate because of the way the rules and time value of money works&#8211;means that wealthy shareholders are still getting very much a free ride to accumulated wealth through the US tax system.  It&#8217;s time that stopped.</p>
<p>The Journal article&#8217;s suggestion&#8211;that the Congress needs to &#8220;set[] the [corporate income tax] rate low enough that companies opt to pay the tax rather than continue to pile up an estimated $300 billion a year beyond Uncle Sam&#8217;s reach.&#8221;  Id.  That suggestion must be tongue in cheek&#8211;no matter how much the rate is lowered on the wealthy corporations making incredibly high profits, they still insist that they don&#8217;t want to pay any tax.  They will not be happy unless the rate is zero or negative.  That is the reason that Oracle &#8220;derives about half of its revenue from the US but keeps more than three-quarters of its cash and short-term investments&#8211;or $26 billion-in the hands of its foreign subsidiaries&#8221; and has established a bunch of new foreign subsidiaries in tax havens for holding these profits.  Id.</p>
<p>From my perspective, Congress should not lower the rate.  It should instead stop many of the loopholes that permit companies to claim to &#8220;sell&#8221; essential IT property to offshore affiliates in order to then claim profits offshore.  And it ought to deal with similar gambits to lower US taxes, such as disallowing completely any interest deductions for debt to the extent that the company holds &#8220;offshore&#8221; funds of its controlled foreign subsidiaires in US-dollar-denominated assets in the United States &#8211;i.e., no interest deduction for debt of the US MNE consolidated group that is matched by a US-dollar denominated, US asset held by a controlled foreign subsidiary.</p>
<p>Professor Johnson recommends a &#8220;global consolidated return&#8221; for multinationals, with international negotiations to determine each country&#8217;s taxing jurisdiction on that whole. <br />These and similar ideas should be considered by a Congress truly intent on reasonable reform, economic justice, and distributional justice. </p>

<p> Do Good Wall Street Days Translate to Good Days for Most Americans?</p>
<p> As usual, there was one of those all-knowing snippets in the news last Friday about what the direction in the stock market meant for the economy.  Observing high corporate profits and buoyed by the idea that the GOP might not play its &#8220;just say no&#8221; game on the debt ceiling issue (at least for three months), Wall Street profits rose.  See <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/19/business/daily-stock-market-activity.html">Wall Street at 5-year high</a>, New York Times Business Insider, Jan 18, 2013.</p>
<p>Should we so easily consider Wall Street&#8217;s well-being as a general sign of the well-being of the economy?  Sometimes it seems that it marches to its own tune, while ordinary Americans continue to struggle.  Foreclosures, job losses, offshoring, state actions to make union membership harder even when most Americans say union membership should be easier, huge inequalities in incomes and wealth and the social problems that go with those inequalities&#8211;there are all kinds of things going on that still don&#8217;t bode well for ordinary Americans whose income is mostly made up of wages and not preferentially taxed capital gains and who don&#8217;t own much of the financial assets of this country.  Democratic egalitarianism isn&#8217;t satisfied by such a system that consistently rewards one class of income over another based on what amounts to class distinctions&#8211;the kind of income that requires hard work is less rewarded than the kind of income that comes with a silver spoon at birth.</p>
<p>In other words, corporate giants making high profits doesn&#8217;t provide much reassurance to ordinary guys about the stability of their own personal economies.  High profits seem to translate to higher payouts to corporate managers/shareholders, but ordinary workers don&#8217;t get more than a trickle of a share of those productivity gains. </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Trickle down hasn&#8217;t trickled much down the last few decades, if it ever did. Inequality is growing worse, and with that comes even more influence so that the politically powerful are the same as the economically powerful, yielding a return on lobbying that the Founders couldn&#8217;t have imagined. </p>
<p>The unequal society that is today&#8217;s United States has many problems that are at least partially caused by the high level of inequality&#8211;from teenage pregnancy to illiteracy rates to lifespan of the underclass to low birth weights to college graduate rates and many other indicators of a less than optimal quality of life.  And those problems are exacerbated by the continuing blind faith of so many Washington politicians in the &#8220;<a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2013/01/philip-pilkington-the-degenerating-discourse-of-mainstream-economics.html">degenerating discourse of mainstream economics</a>&#8221; (the link is to a recent post on Yves Smith&#8217;s Naked Capitalism by Philip Pilkington).  We continue to look to Wall Street, and ignore the blight of wealth and income inequality that besets Main Street, because economists have fabricated a convenient theory of equilibrium that is most successful at hiding what is really going on from us while protecting the &#8220;free market&#8221; impulses of brute force capitalism.</p>
<p>Perhaps one of the positive results of the buoying of Wall Street is the general consumer attitude, which does result in more spending (still perhaps beyond one&#8217;s means for much of the underclass)?  That spending increases business demand, and could even result ultimately in more job creation, especially if accompanied by more federal spending rather than the counter-stimulus current focus on spending cuts and &#8220;balanced&#8221; budgets (in at least one sense an oxymoron for a federal government that can print its own money).  But those jobs will require a better educated public than the US is likely to have. Again, partly due to the mainstream economic discourse, we are effectively debilitating public education through cuts in funding, exploitation of teachers, and privatization for the profit-making gains of education profiteers, rendering what was our greatest strength our greatest weakness.\</p>
<p>But what really happens to most of the wealth created by those increases in corporate profits (and those demands for ever higher returns that the wealthy have come to view as their norm, accompanied by those terribly preferential tax rates that mean the wealthy get to keep more of their unearned wealth while ordinary workers cannot)?  One suspects that much of that &#8216;extra&#8217; wealth heads out of the country&#8211;to offshore tax havens, invested in yet another vacation home abroad, put into emerging markets, following the promise of higher returns without much regard for the impact on the US economy.</p>
<p>As long as we are facing the kind of inordinate reward to the uberwealthy and underreward to ordinary Americans, I find it hard to get excited about a five-year high on Wall Street.  It&#8217;s main effect is to drive home the need for Congress to develop better tax policy to at least use tax as a means to help, on the periphery, cut back on inequality.  Eliminate the preferential taxation of capital gains and dividends and estates.  Don&#8217;t listen so much to the deficit scolds who want to decimate earned benefit programs like Medicare and Social Security.  Invest more in physical infrastructure, particularly mass transit and environmentally sounder energy policies.  Don&#8217;t listen so much to the militarists (who are often in company with said deficit scolds) who want to continue allowing the military budget to engorge itself.</p>

<p>McConnell Tossing the Gauntlet on Debt, Taxes and the GOP&#8217;s dream of dismantling Social Security and Medicare</p>
<p>Pretty much as I predicted, Obama&#8217;s failure to go over the fiscal cliff&#8211;instead &#8220;negotiating&#8221; and settling for a half-assed deal that hardly got rid of any of the stupidities of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bush_tax_cuts">Bush tax cuts</a>&#8211;convinced the Republicans that they can play their brinkmanship game on the debt ceiling debate yet again and perhaps finally get the Democrats to undo their own most significant programs of the last 100 years&#8211;Social Security and Medicare.</p>
<p>What we ought to be doing is cutting the military/defense and corporate welfare budgets.  And then increasing taxes&#8211;with (1) new layers of tax brackets and tax rates corresponding to our new levels of income inequality, so that multimillionaires are taxed at a higher rate than mere millionaires and billionaires are taxed higher than multimillionaires and (2), at the least, legislation to eliminate the farce of the so-called &#8220;carried interest: privileged compensation taxation for LBO managers, who get mostly preferential capital gains for their &#8220;services&#8221; in buying companies and loading them with debt that makes the managers but not the workers wealthy.</p>
<p>But the Democrats somehow still thought they would get some kind of credit, even from the staunchest of the right-wingers, for being &#8220;bipartisan&#8221; and working out a &#8220;deal&#8221; to avoid the &#8220;fiscal cliff.&#8221;  So they made the ridiculous Bush tax cuts permanent, except for those in the upper-upper crust making three times as much as anybody in the middle class.  And they made the estate tax cut even larger than it was&#8211;with a $5.2 million exemption (double for a couple) and only a 40% rate.  Inequality will continue to grow at accelerated rates.  And they extended the litany of truly egregiously stupid corporate tax breaks, like the bonus depreciation/expensing provisions that ultimately permit corporate multinational giants a NEGATIVE effective tax rate (read Cary Brown on the way noneconomic frontloading of expensing amounts to nontaxation under time value of money principles).</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>The GOP however is currently running deranged.  The party that purports to care about fiscal conservatism only wants to fund more military and make sure that vulnerable elderly don&#8217;t get as much in their Social Security checks and have to pay even more for their health care.  McConnell&#8211;the MINORITY leader in the Senate&#8211;has pronounced his party&#8217;s views on the matter:  &#8220;The tax issue is finished.&#8221;  Brian Knowlton, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/07/us/politics/mitch-mcconnell-says-no-to-more-tax-increases.html?src=recg&#038;pagewanted=print">McConnell Takes Taxes Off the Table in New Talks</a>, New York Times (Jan 6, 2013).</p>
<p>Folks, the stuff about the debt ceiling and the need to cut benefits under Social Security and Medicare is baloney.  The US government isn&#8217;t a family&#8211;it&#8217;s a sovereign regime .  We should learn from the Euro nations that are embroiled in a self-defeating austering regime that leaving citizens suffering while trying to toady to big business is a recipe for disaster.</p>
<p>President Obama had damn well better take Social Security and Medicare off the table as well as any corporate tax reductions.  Get rid of corporate loopholes and let corporate tax revenues INCREASE.  It is the only way left to try to re-balance an economy that is skewed in favor of the uber-rich and the multinational corporations and against ordinary Americans.  Oh, it would also help to move to single-payer single-provider health care and get profit-making out of what should be an important human right.<br />And are we &#8220;spending way too much&#8221; anyway, as McConnell declares?  Surely not, since we are only spending on things that the Congress has voted to spend on.  If McConnell wants to spend less, let him propose a spending cut and put it to the vote.  If it fails, then he should vote the taxes or borrowing needing to pay for the spending Congress has legislated.</p>
<p>So, just as my advice in the &#8220;fiscal cliff&#8221; debate was to go over the cliff, let the Bush tax cuts expire, and then put in place some decent cuts for the REAL middle class (those making less than $100,000 a year), my advice here is to go over the &#8220;sequester cliff&#8221; and let the across-the-board cuts, with the first real cuts to the military in decades, take place.  We should damp down our military zeal and start to put our money where it will build good schools, good colleges, good public transportation, and ultimately good jobs.<br />As for the debt ceiling, the best thing would be for the Senate to eliminate the filibuster rule (or at least make the right-wingers do a physical filibuster) and eliminate the debt ceiling.  It is an artifact of a different age, and is meaningless.  Think about this.</p>
<p>1) we have spending bills that require us to spend X dollars<br />2) we have tax bills that only raise X-Y dollars.<br />3) we have a governmental obligation to pay the X dollars that we spend to those who provide the goods and services amounting to X dollars.<br />4) Therefore we have a governmental obligation to borrow the Y dollars that we don&#8217;t raise with taxes.<br />cross popsted with <a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2013/01/mcconnell-tossing-the-gauntlet-on-debt-taxes-and-the-gops-dream-of-dismantling-social-security-and-m.html">ataxingmatter</a></p>

<p> Lew almost official as nominee for Treasury Secretary</p>
<p>Media headlines continue to tout Obama&#8217;s white male choices for rounding out his &#8216;new&#8217; cabinet.  Latest to the list is that he has offered his Jacob Lew, his current White House Chief of Staff, the post of Treasury Secretary.  See, e.g., <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/obama-to-name-lew-treasury-secretary/2013/01/09/d6b91204-5a6b-11e2-88d0-c4cf65c3ad15_story.html">Obama to tap Jack Lew for top Treasury post,</a> Washington Post.com (Jan. 9, 2013).<br />Jack Lew has been a slew of things&#8211;hedge fund manager at Citigroup (bailed out big bank), university administrator (administrative stuff, not academic stuff) at NYU, Clinton and Obama administration OMB administrator, State Department official, and of course White House Chief of Staff.  That means he is well embedded in the Wall-Street-respecting culture of Geithner, Summers, Paulson and the rest of the DC crowd that pays too much credence to what bankers say and not enough to what ordinary Americans think.  So that is one strike against him.</p>
<p>On the other side, as the news story in the Post notes, the GOP generally views him as a tough negotiator who stands his ground on issues that Democrats have tended to consider important.  That is one big strike in his favor, especially since it is not something that his current boss is especially known for (or good at, as evidenced by the way he caved on not letting the Bush tax cuts just die of their own accord so that less stupid provisions could be put in place, especially on the corporate  and estate tax side).</p>
<p>But what about the fact that Treasury is where most tax policy thinking goes on, and thinking about the ins and outs of statutory provisions and exceptions, and thinking about &#8220;administrative&#8221; lawmaking through regulations.  Under the Bush administration, the Treasury Department put through a series of regulations that greatly facilitated concentration of corporate giants into even larger corporate giants, and did so in ways that appear to have allowed, for the first time ever, a taxpayer who engaged in a reorg transaction and received boot and stock to recognize a LOSS in the reorg transaction by allocating consideration. </p>
<p>In other words, the internal goings on at Treasury are just another place that corporate lobbyists (including continuing contact between former Treasury and IRS officials with the bar as they move back and forth) can influence the law in favor of lower taxes for business.  Shouldn&#8217;t we care how much Lew knows about tax law and what his views on that are?  I think we should.</p>

<p>Lew is a Harvard graduate  with a JD from Georgetown (so yes, we continue to see the elite nominating their comrades in elitedom to offices in this country).  He was a congressional aide and then policy adviser to Speaker Tip O&#8217;Neill in the late &#8217;70s, when he worked on Social Security, Medicare, budget, tax and similar issues.  So at least he&#8217;s got some depth of experience on those issues.  He practiced law for several years, but not as a tax lawyer&#8211;he worked on electricity generation. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Lew">Wikipedia </a>says he has also dealt with Middle East issues and various other things in other short-term posts he has held.  So a peripatetic acquirer of bits of experience and knowledge across a range of things, but not an economist and not a tax lawyer.</p>
<p>Does that make him qualified to head Treasury and to advise on what has become one of the most important areas of the law, in which we subsidize whole industries, give huge tax breaks to huge multinational corporations without even understanding how much of a break we are giving them (the bonus depreciation/accelerated depreciation/expensing regime and the active financing exception), and continue to consider that some of the richest people in the country are just &#8220;middle class&#8221;?  I have my doubts.</p>
<p>Remember that in both of the big &#8220;economic&#8221; commissions of the last couple of years (Alice Rivlin&#8217;s, Erskine Bowles&#8217;) there were no actual tax lawyers&#8211;not even tax academics&#8211;involved.  Maybe that&#8217;s one reason the ideas miss out so much on what is reasonable.  Maybe it&#8217;s time that a range of tax academics were listened to about what shape the tax code needs to take, and why.</p>

<p>Social Security/Medicare vs Corporate Welfare</p>
<p>The denouement of the fiscal cliff debate behind us (and not, I regret, with the best results&#8211;more on that later) we now face the next stage, in which we can expect the right-side extremists to threaten to hold the government hostage unless spending is cut (meaning, to the right-side, spending for people-oriented projects like the safety net but not extending generally to spending on the military or the corporate welfare with which the tax code was reinforced through the fiscal cliff deal that extended or made permanent many of the notorious giveaways from the Bush years) and debt is limited.</p>
<p>All of this will be pushed by those in the &#8220;tea party&#8221; and Koch-funded right-wing as so-called &#8220;fiscal conservatism.&#8221;</p>
<p>It isn&#8217;t.  The agenda on the right is about as far from fiscal conservatism as anything can be.  The right is quite happy to take a &#8220;no tax increases forever&#8221; position, at that same time as gleefully opting for more and more expansive defense and defense-related spending.  Similarly, the fiscal cliff deal with its reinforcement of corporate welfare in the extension or making permanent of the Bush year corporate tax giveaways demonstrates that there is hardly a corporate tax expenditure that this gang doesn&#8217;t like.  Take two examples:  the R&#038;D credit and the &#8220;active financing&#8221; exception to Subpart F. 
<ul>
<li>The R&#038;D credit allows companies to understate their corporate income by giving a dollar-for-dollar credit for R&#038;D expenditures.  The purported objective is to encourage more R&#038;D.  But this credit was examined closely ages ago and came up short&#8211;it really is just a subsidy to corporations (like Big Pharm) that do considerable research.  And those companies happen to be companies that HAVE to do considerable research to stay competitive.  The subsidy just comes along for the ride; it doesn&#8217;t drive the research.  This is evidenced by the fact that several times the temporary subsidy was extended after the year of the research had closed&#8211;there is no way that a retroactive subsidy can incentivize additional research in a past year! </li>
<li>The &#8220;active financing&#8221; exception lets banks forego immediate Subpart F taxation on their international interest and dividend income, because, they say, that&#8217;s their &#8220;active&#8221; business.  But then of course they are encouraged to locate as much passive income in those active financing subsidiaries as possible, to be able to exempt as much as possible from Subpart F immediate taxation.  It is just one of the many crutches we give multinational banks, yet they continue to be a genuine risk for the US economy and a genuine risk for again requiring US bailouts.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other corporate welfare examples include everything from the continuing subsidy (after more than a 100 years of profits) to Big Oil and other natural resource extraction, to Big Pharm and Big IT from inadequate rules against the so-called sales of critical IT property to offshore affiliates, to companies that set up captive insurance companies, and to companies that use the vastly frontloaded &#8220;expensing&#8221; of equipment purchases through the accelerated depreciation system and the more recently added separate expensing provisions.  (On the latter:  The benefit of frontloading is considerable deferral of taxes, which means higher profits to the companies and lower revenues to the government.  It might arguably make sense as a temporary stimulus from time to time, but it has been a permanent part of our system now for more than a decade and is not justifiable in that framework.)</p>

<p>So corporate welfare should be what is cut, not Social Security or Medicare benefits, when we start looking at areas where cash is senselessly flowing in ways that don&#8217;t further the quality of life of typical Americans.  See Carl Gibson, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/carl-gibson/cut-corporate-welfare-not_b_2421340.html?view=print&#038;comm_ref=false">Cut Corporate Welfare, Not the Safety Net</a>, HuffPost Politics (Jan. 7, 2013). </p>
<p>As Gibson notes,</p>
<blockquote><p>In Congress&#8217; latest &#8220;fiscal cliff&#8221; deal that supposedly had to be passed in order to avoid economic calamity, we spent <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/12/31/unemployment-insurance-extended_n_2389634.html">$30 billion</a> on extending unemployment benefits for a year, and <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2013/01/eight-corporate-subsidies-in-the-fiscal-cliff-bill-from-goldman-sachs-to-disney-to-nascar.html">$205 billion</a> in corporate tax breaks, subsidies and excessive tax loopholes. Most of these Christmas gifts for corporate America are benefiting major, multi-billion dollar corporations that <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2011/11/03/360185/30-corporations-no-taxes/">haven&#8217;t paid a dime of U.S. income taxes in years</a>, like GE and Boeing. In other words, taxpayers spent six times more on giving free money to companies making record profits than we did to making sure the people who were laid off by these corporations can still feed their families. $205 billion in corporate goodies was okay with Speaker Boehner, but <a href="http://articles.philly.com/2013-01-04/news/36132767_1_votes-on-sandy-aid-christie-sandy-victims">$60 billion</a> in Hurricane Sandy relief apparently wasn&#8217;t.</p></blockquote>
<p>And the New York Times today hit on another of the absurd subsidies that crept into our Code in a well-intentioned provision to help small farmers but has resulted in most real estate investors seldom paying taxes on their gains and many corporations using the device to avoid millions in taxes annually.  That&#8217;s the &#8220;section 1031&#8221; like-kind exchange.  There&#8217;s really no normative policy justification for allowing this kind of exchange to avoid taxation of the realized gain whereas other exchanges (non-like-kind) do not.  There is even less justification for the avoidance of taxation for the kinds of intermediary exchanges that have evolved over time, allowing actual sales to occur, so long as the seller ensures that the money is put into an escrow account until it is used to buy &#8220;replacement&#8221; property.  While it is hard to see any real justification for any of the like-kind exchange provisions, and certainly not for the intermediated sales + replacement regimes, it is especially problematic when the intermediated regimes become subject to abuse&#8211;where intermediaries allow the exchanging taxpayer full access to the cash, e.g., as collateral for loans, etc. during the period when no use is permitted.  The New York Times covered that issue today.  See David Kocieniewski, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/07/business/economy/companies-exploit-tax-break-for-asset-exchanges-trial-evidence-shows.html">Major Companies Push the Limits of a Tax Br</a>eak, New York Times (Jan. 6, 2013).</p>
<blockquote><p>The federal government now allows more than $1.1 trillion a year in this and other tax expenditures. Each of those incentives — which include hundreds of exemptions, exclusions, deferrals and preferential rates — either adds to the budget deficit or shifts the cost of government to other taxpayers.<br />Some are narrowly targeted and offer aid to specific industries like Nascar owners, asparagus farmers, oil companies, yacht makers or solar panel producers. Others, like accelerated depreciation or the tax code’s preference for debt financing over equity, provide tax benefits for wide swaths of businesses.<br />“Tax expenditures are very similar to an entitlement program, so they’re easy to start,” said George K. Yin, former chief of staff of the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation, and now <a href="http://www.law.virginia.edu/lawweb/faculty.nsf/fhpbi/1223683">a professor</a> at the University of Virginia School of Law. “But once a tax break gets started, people think they’re entitled to it, so they are very difficult to end.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Professor Yin has it exactly right&#8211;those tax breaks are very &#8220;easy to start&#8221; and very lucrative for corporations.  Once they get them, they will say (as the real estate people do here) that jobs depend on keeping them going.  That is usually not true, or much less of an impact than claimed.  But Congress caves easily on those items, and we go on with a giveaway code for Big Business.</p>

<p> Welfare Spending: Medicare vs Corporate/Business Subsidies (or does the GOP really support WalMart&#8217;s behavior in Bangladesh?)</p>
<p> As most readers know, the federal government is currently in what passes for negotiations between the President&#8217;s Democratic Party Senate and House members and the GOP members that control the House. <br />The Tea Party and its right-wing rhetoric has of course had a radicalizing impact on the GOP positions, with members not only beholden to Grover Norquist and his anti-tax pledge (all strongly supported by various right-wing propaganda tanks like the Tax Foundation, Heritage, American Enterprise, and other organizations) but also to the anti-social welfare corporatists like David and Charles Koch, the Wal-Mart heirs, and other oligarchic families that constitute the top 1% of US income and wealth.  As a result of these two strong influences, the GOP now stands for

<li>tax-cuts-no-matter-what (and for tax cuts that benefit the wealthy most of all, as reflected in the rigid position in favor of the &#8220;carried interest&#8221; scam used by private equity profits partners and the extraordinarily preferential rate for capital gains and dividends included in the &#8220;net capital gain&#8221; definition under section 1(h)(11)); and </li>
<li>so-called &#8220;entitlement reforms&#8221;, by which GOPers generally mean reduction in benefits and/or privatization of social welfare programs including Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.  (All of this is argued in terms of caring about &#8220;saving&#8221; the programs for the future, but the truth lies in the ways that the right proposes changes to the programs&#8211;not changes in costs related to profits taken out by Big Pharma and similar interests, but changes in benefits to ordinary Americans (such as raising the working age for eligibility even though those who work at the hardest labor need benefits earlier, not later, or lowering the cost-of-living-allowance adjustment to benefits for Medicare, even though seniors generally have a HIGHER cost of living because of their increased medical needs, including prescription drugs for diabetes, high blood pressure, and similar diseases particularly prevalent in the elderly population.)</li>
</ul>
<p>The sum of those positions stands for a corporatist philosophy of benefitting the oligarchy and their business enterprises at the expense of everyday Americans who work for a living.</p>

<p>This is even more obvious when one looks at the same groups&#8217; position on government subsidies for business.  The New York Times recently ran an article on this issue, noting that governments typically pay out a lot of money to support profits of companies and receive very little benefit in terms of tax revenues received and jobs created!  Louise Story, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/02/us/how-local-taxpayers-bankroll-corporations.html">As companies seek tax deals, governments pay high price</a>, New York Times (Dec. 1, 2012).</p>
<p>Over at MauledAgain, one of my fellow tax professors Jim Maule has, like me, long criticized the hypocrisy of supporting tax breaks for private enterprise and opposing earned benefits programs for ordinary citizens and has repeatedly pointed out that the economics of the tax breaks for business don&#8217;t work out for anybody but the owners and managers of the businesses.  They certainly don&#8217;t work for taxpayers of the jurisdiction providing them.  As Jim notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>These tax breaks are nothing more than welfare payments to private enterprise. Opponents of social welfare spending defend these outlays with as much passion as they bring to their attempts to end government assistance for individuals in need of help.James Maule, <a href="http://www.mauledagain.blogspot.com/#9119804729524207183">The Hidden Government Spending Game</a>, MauledAgain (Dec. 5, 2012).</p></blockquote>
<p>Jim rebuts one of the sham arguments for corporate subsidies&#8211;that they are just &#8220;keeping what belongs to them.&#8221;  Those special subsidies to one private enterprise sector cause ripple effects throughout the economy&#8211;higher taxes to the other taxpayers to make up for the lost revenues, or cuts in important programs that can no longer be sustained without the revenues.  Prices and wages may change as well.  Id.<br />What I want to focus on is the hypocrisy of claiming an interest in ending &#8220;entitlements&#8221; but applying that philosophy only to programs that are intended to help ordinary citizens and not to those intended to beef up the profits of corporations or their managers and owners.  This is especially hypocritical for today&#8217;s right-wing, since they almost universally claim to ascribe to the view that competition is good and that businesses should fail when they cannot successfully compete. </p>
<p>Look at two cases involving WalMart, a multinational enterprise that fights unionization of its employees (and supports right-to-work laws that weaken worker rights) in every way imaginable.</p>
<p>1) In Champlain Illinois (personal experience), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walmart">WalMart</a> had a huge spralling complex on one side of the road.  It had gotten various tax support for the complex.  It decided to move across the road and down the block into another jurisdiction.  It got new tax subsidies there.  It abandonned the old building and left whatever environmental pollution there.  Who gained?  Mostly WalMart managers and owners.  Not the town and counties.  Not the employees.  Not even the consumers who shopped there, who had to deal with the blight of the abandonned building and the multiplication of vast expanses of ugly parking lots.</p>
<p>2) WalMart in Bangladesh.   WalMart delivers cheap goods because it outsources its clothing and other manufacturing needs to impoverished countries where workers can be paid almost nothing and get almost no protections.  In Bangladesh last month, a clothing factory burned, killing hundreds of workers.  It was a WalMart supplier. See  Natasha Leonard, <a href="http://www.salon.com/2012/11/26/wal_marts_connection_to_firetrap_bangladesh_factory_is_unclear/">WalMart&#8217;s Connection to Bangladesh Clothing Factory</a>, Salon.com (Nov. 26, 2012), where a critic noted that:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Wal-Mart is supporting, is incentivizing, an industry strategy in Bangladesh: extreme low wages, non-existent regulation, brutal suppression of any attempt by workers to act collectively to improve wages and conditions.&#8221; Id.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>This was a modern-day repeat of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle_Shirtwaist_Factory_fire">Triangle Shirt Factory</a> incident in the early nineteen hundreds in New York City:  workers unable to escape burned to death in factory rooms without fire exits and yet dangerously littered with lint and other debris that made their workplace a fire hazard.</p>
<p>WalMart, in fact, has led the fight against workers&#8217; rights and spending on safety at that factory and others.  See Natasha Leonard,  <a href="http://www.salon.com/2012/12/06/wal_mart_wouldnt_pay_for_bangladeshi_factory_safety_improvements/">WalMart wouldn&#8217;t pay for Bangladeshi factory safety improvements</a>, Salon.com (Dec. 6, 2012). </p></blockquote>
<p>These things are all tied together: hostility to workers rights to bargain collectively for some fair share of the productivity gains that their labor brings about, hostility to workers rights to a safe working place; hostitlity to workers rights to decent health care; hostility to ordinary people&#8217;s rights to a sustainable lifestyle; and hostility to any effort to make the oligarchic uber-rich pay a fair share of the costs of the infrastructure to sustain an economy and a people.</p>
<p>Tax policy, spending policy, policy towards workers, policy towards the wealthy uber-rich&#8211;these are all closely intertwined and must be considered of a piece.  Tax policy needs to establish reasonable levels of contributions based on a progressive income tax that takes into account the marginal utility of the dollar.  Spending policy needs to set priorities based on something other than the lobbying by special corporate and oligarch interests for tax-and-spending provisions that privilege themselves.    Policy towards labor rights and workplace safety need to recognize that the worker is disemplowered within the workplace and needs some legal support to provide a reasonable share of productivity gains&#8211;minimum wage laws, unionization laws, workers safety laws need to protect workers rights against the all-powerful employer.</p>
<p>If the right succeeds in continuing to pass right-to-work laws (Michigan&#8217;s lame duck GOP is trying to do that right now), if the oligarchs succeed in capturing all the profits from workers&#8217; labor&#8211;there will be social unrest on the scale of the Great Depression.  Everybody will suffer from that kind of austerity and class warfare policy.  Broad based economic growth that comes from workers sharing in the profits of their industry and those at the top not getting an unreasonable share of the productivity gains is better for all. </p>
