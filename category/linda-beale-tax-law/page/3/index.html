<p>There are no &#8220;per se&#8221; tax or spending caps: lame duck negotiations no place for Medicare/Medicaid cuts</p>
<p>When George W. Bush got reelected with a minority of the popular vote and contested state counts, the GOP claimed a mandate to keep going with the fiscally irresponsible program of high military spending combined with tax cuts particularly advantageous for their wealthy and corporate-owning supporters.<br />When Barack Obama got reelected with a clear majority of the popular vote and a resounding majority in the electoral college, the GOP says Obama has no mandate because the GOP managed to retain the House though Democrats in the House got more votes than Republicans in the House.<br />Anybody notice the partisan inconsistency there?</p>
<p>What we do know is that a majority of Americans&#8211;even lots of those Republicans who voted for Romney&#8211;want this Congress to preserve <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicaid">Medicaid</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicare_%28United_States%29">Medicare</a>.  There is a huge effort by some&#8211;like the Peterson Institute, the Simpson-Bowles comedy tour, and right-wing propaganda tanks&#8211;to cast Medicare as impossible to sustain because of the current trend in health care costs.  The argument goes this way:
<ul>
<li>health care costs in the US are rising </li>
<li>the population that is eligible for Medicare in the using is rising as baby boomers age </li>
<li>Medicare costs will therefore inevitably increase </li>
<li>even though Medicare costs are rising less rapidly than non-Medicare health care costs (because of the ability of the government to mandate certain cost controls), those increases will eventually require significantly higher government outlays </li>
<li>the US has unprecedented levels of debt and annual budget deficits </li>
<li>the US spends too much compared to its tax revenues (the tax take is several percentage points less of the GDP than the spending percentage) </li>
<li>therefore the US can&#8217;t afford to pay those increasing amounts for Medicare health care costs </li>
<li>therefore we should cut back on eligibilty for, and benefits from, Medicare.</li>
</ul>
<p>But this argument has several fatal flaws that include the following:</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<ul>
<li>debt is extraordinarily cheap right now
<ul>
<li>if you can borrow at very low rates, it is better to borrow now than later </li>
<li>if you can borrow at very low rates and there are important projects on which to spend the money, the borrowed money acts as a stimulant to the economy </li>
<li>if the economy is stimulated by the borrowed money, the GDP growth will likely support continued low interest rates and faster revenue growth that will repay the debt faster</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>deficit spending by the government is vital when there isn&#8217;t private spending
<ul>
<li>and if the economy grows, private spending will grow and deficit spending can pull back</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>spending priorities have to be determined: 
<ul>
<li>there is no per se rule that higher spending is necessarily bad (though the right-wing in this country presupposes that there is and based almost all policy prescriptions on that presupposition, because the right-wing ideologically wants to divert public spending to its private pocketbooks) </li>
<li>there is no arbitrary and fixed percentage of GDP that is the &#8220;right&#8221; amount to be spent by the government on government programs </li>
<li>we spend too little now on public infrastructure ( public transporation, national roadways, electrical grids, and sewage systems are badly deteriorated), basic research (we have cut back on funding for NIH and NSF, major drivers of advancements in scientific and medical knowledge), and major priorities like combatting global warming/ supporting renewable energy </li>
<li>we spend too much now on the military (the military-industrial complex constitutes about 60% of the federal government) </li>
<li>we should support continued spending on Medicaid and Medicare, because those programs fill a vital need and serve the population well&#8211;we should not reduce benefits but rather increase them, at least for those who rely on Medicare/Medicaid as their primary or only health care plan</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>     We&#8217;ve already built in various cuts to the spending for Medicare and Medicaid (possibly too much) and the question of what the costs will be ten years down the road depend in part on what else we do along those lines and how those things work out. See Editorial, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/29/opinion/health-care-entitlements.html">Health Care Entitlements</a>, New York Times (Nov. 29, 2012); Yves Smith, <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2012/11/fed-budgetary-experts-demolish-cbo-health-cost-model-the-lynchpin-of-budget-hysteria.html">Naked Capitalism</a>.</li>
<li>     tax policy should be based on fairness in the way we raise revenues and spending priroities in the amount of revenues we raise</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>An equation that says &#8220;X (health care costs) is increasing and Y (Medicare coverage of health care costs) is increasing (because the number of people needing the program that pays for health care costs is increasing) and Z (taxes for coverage of health care costs) is increasing&#8221; and then concludes &#8220;therefore we must reduce Y&#8221; is using false logic: 
<ul>
<li> to maintain a relative constant, there are more options than &#8220;reduce Y&#8221; since the country could:
<ul>
<li>reduce X (move to single payer, as every other advanced nation has done, and halve the cost of health care) </li>
<li>increase Z (increase the tax support for Medicare, because it is a high priority that a majority of the citizens of our democracy support)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>What we have to do is get away from the kind of thinking that seems to permeate so much of the discussion in Congress and in the media&#8211;that there are pre-set limits to how much we should borrow, how much we should spend, or how much we should raise in tax revenues. </p>
<p>The deficit hawks want us to think that the countnry will be just another Greece if we don&#8217;t rein in spending and debt and keep taxes low.  Traditionally our spending has ranged around 21% of GDP, but there is nothing magical about that number&#8211;it could rise to 24% or 26% without harm.  And we are not Greece, because we remain a powerful economy, one that can print our own money and one that commands interest from the global economy, so our debt (mostly caused by the Bush tax cuts combined with the Bush wars, and the Reaganomics deregulatory mania) is not an unbearable yoke around our necks.  We should be discussing the real needs of the country for infrastructure and provision of public goods and then figuring out how to pay for them with a combination of taxes and debt.</p>

<p> Karl Rove on the so-called &#8220;fiscal cliff&#8221;</p>
<p> In a video interview available from Dow Jones/Wall Street Journal, &#8220;<a href="http://live.wsj.com/video/karl-rove-doubt-a%20fiscal-cliff-deal-will-get-done/0450996E-14C8-4D74-8565-656AB30EED8B.html">Karl Rove Doubts a Fiscal Cliff Deal Will Get Done</a>&#8221; (Nov. 20, 2012),  Karl Rove&#8217;s pre-Thanksgiving news to the world is exactly what one would expect from one of the most successful GOP strategists.  He urges Repubicans to do everything possible to find &#8220;reasonable compromises without sacrificing principles&#8221;, which means entitlement reform coupled with offsetting revenues without increasing tax rates.</p>
<p>I. This is nothing new.  </p>
<p><strong>Rove doesn&#8217;t want the GOP to accept any rate increases and he does want the GOP to play the obstructionist role to the hilt unless they get their longed-for undermining of the New Deal Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid programs</strong>. </p>
<p>The flawed argument is the same as Romney&#8217;s arrogant economic message in the presidential campaign&#8211;that increased revenues will come from economic growth gained from running the country&#8217;s economy to support Big Business.  And the GOP insists that it will only happen if they can get the purported bad-guy Democrats to accede to the Republican policy demands of continued preferential taxation of the wealthy and corporate America, increased spending for the military, continued regulatory inattention to the financialization of the economy, combined with spending cuts to safety net programs.  </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Rove&#8217;s position essentially insists on the government folloowing the GOP&#8217;s long-debunked market fundamentalism that assumes that the &#8220;dynamics&#8221; of spending cuts to the GOP-hated so-called &#8220;entitlements&#8221; (and not to the GOP-loved military budget) will immediately cause the economy to bloom and result in all the revenues needed (by the &#8220;appropriately&#8221; shrunken federal government), while the elite continue to rip-off the economy with &#8220;rent&#8221; profits.  And even if the &#8220;compromise&#8221; was to allow some increase in tax payments through cutting back deductions that primarily benefit the elite, one can imagine that those cutbacks will be relatively minor and short-lived. </p>
<p><strong>II. The strategy is nonetheless revealing.</strong><br /><strong><br /></strong> What is most interesting here is not Rove&#8217;s continued reliance on the same old failed Reaganomics arguments from the past re adhering to GOP &#8220;principles&#8221;.  It is his post-election strategy for how to achieve it.<strong> </strong>He is &#8220;dubious&#8221; that a deal can get done in the few days left in this congressional session. <strong> His solution&#8211;Congress should agree to carry on the &#8220;status quo ante&#8221; for a few months andthen arrive at a solution. </strong><br />Rove knows what progressives know (and what I&#8217;ve insisted on in this blog): the Democrats have the rare upper-hand at this point in the legislative cycle. </p>
<p>The Republicans agreed to the passage of a law (the so-called &#8220;sequester&#8221;) that cuts otherwise slated increases to the military and also cuts a variety of domestic non-military expenditures.  The Republicans also joined with Democrats to pass a two-year extension of the Bush tax cuts two years ago, when they thought that they would control the White House and  the Senate after the 2012 elections and be able, finally, to deliver on their original intent to make the &#8220;temporary&#8221; Bush tax cuts permanent, thus guaranteeing a crop of preferential tax provisions for the very wealthy and multinational corporations while carrying out their long-term objective of privatizing and reducing safety net programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. <br />Republicans have less ammunition to carry out their obstructionist and New Deal-defeating agenda&#8211;the laws that cut the military budget, protect the safety net programs, and increase tax rates are already enacted. <br />Unless the GOP can convince the public and the Dems in Congress that there really is a fiscal &#8220;cliff&#8221; that spells suicide for the US economy, they are caught short in their legislative strategy.  They relied on a wipe-out victory in the 2012 elections.  Permanent reductions in taxes for the rich, deregulation, privatization/decimation of the New Deal safety net programs, and ever-increasing support for the military are much less easily put into law without one-party control.</p>
<p>The Democrats should not be willing to negotiate against interest just to kick the ball down the road to a period when they will have fewer strategic advantages on their side!  Democrats&#8211;with Obama in the lead&#8211;should insist on enactment of a bill making permanent tax cuts for the lower-middle and lower-income classes&#8211;ie, a group that almost no one thinks should have to pay more in a time of continuing slow growth out of the Bush recession years. </p>
<p>If the Republicans refuse to pass such a law, the Dems should not kow-tow to the GOP&#8217;s so-called &#8220;compromise&#8221; position of re-extending the full Bush tax cuts and caving to earned benefit program cuts.  Instead, the Dems should let the Bush tax cuts expire as slated and do nothing about the sequester and by all means do nothing to reduce benefits to Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid.  In January, President Obama and the progressives in the House and Senate should mount an aggressive campaign to pass a well-considered slate of tax cuts for the lower and lower-middle income distribution and a few well-targeted stimulus measures in support of public infrastructure and lower-income unemployment relief. </p>
<p>Only after those measures are in place should there be any discussion of an &#8220;overhaul&#8221; of the tax code&#8211;and that overhaul should be handled in the context of raising sufficient revenues to pay for things we as a people know we should provide&#8211;decent retirement and health care for elderly Americans, decent educational support for young Americans, decent opportunities for a sustainable life for poor Americans, and the revitalization of the middle class who have been the losers of the last decades of class warfare.  The super-rich elite don&#8217;t deserve much attention at all in this debate&#8211;they have been the winners and their winning has not in any way built a sustainable, job-creating economy. </p>

<p> Jack Cummings, General Utilities Repeal, and Treasury&#8217;s Rollover</p>
<p> Jack Cummings (aka Jasper L. Cummings, Jr.) writes in the November 12, 2012 Tax Notes at 797-808 about &#8220;<em>The Demise of the Liquidation-Incorporation Doctrine</em>.&#8221;  This is a must-read not only for corporate-tax policy wonks, but also for those who want to understand at least one of the reasons for the decrease in corporate taxes over the last few decades.</p>
<p>In the major rewrite to the tax code achieved in 1986, Congress legislatively undid the result of General Utilities, a case that allowed appreciated assets to leave corporate solution without taxation.  That is, Congress enacted provisions, particularly section 311(b), that purports to eliminate the ability of corporations to make distributions of appreciated property to shareholders without paying the tax toll on the appreciation while in corporate solution, except for certain situations covered by section 332 (i.e., complete liquidation into a corporate parent) and section 368 (i.e., bootless corporate reorganizations) that explicitly provide for non-recognition of gain in target corporate assets.  The policy grounds for nonrecognition in those provisions is that a domestic corporate parent or acquirer receives the corporate assets in kind, allowing a deferral of the recognition until the assets&#8217; later sale or distribution out of corporate ownership.<br />
<blockquote></p></blockquote>
<p>But the best-laid plans of mice and men oft go astray.  And General Utilities repeal has gone astray at least in part with the avid assistance of Treasury and IRS, which Jack Cummings ably explains in his article.<br />
<blockquote><em>Since 2000 we have witnessed another response to General Utilities repeal, this time with the aid of Treasury and the IRS: the conversion of the C reorganization (and sometimes the A reorganization) into a tool to avoidGeneral Utilities repeal as well as dividend taxation, through the upstream reorganization plus reincorporation.</em><em>Today a corporate tax director who wants to move Business A out of Subsidiary X, leaving it with Business B, can do so by (1) making sure that X is a &#8220;checkable entity&#8221;; (2) checking the box to liquidate X into a disregarded entity; (3) having X transfer Business A to Parent; and (4) checking the box to reincoporate X.  After those easy steps, which can be entirely invisible to the outside world, X may be more bnubile, more easily spun, or sold with less tax cost, because any gain in Business A need not be recognized.<br /></em><i>Several conscious acts by Treasury and the IRS have led to this new escape hatch from General Utilities repeal: the 1996 reg. section 301.7701-1,-2, and -3 check-the-box rules; the 2000 repeal of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bausch_%26_Lomb">Bausch &#038; Lomb</a> doctrine; the 2007 adoption of the &#8216;no recharacterization&#8217; regulation [Reg. section 1.368-2(k)], which is the subject of this article; and IRS ruling practice that confirms all the beneficial results of those changes. Id. at 797.</i></p></blockquote>
<p>Cummings assesses a likely logical path that the Treasury and IRS may have followed to become comfortable with the reg&#8217;s statement that these transactions would not be subject to recharacterization, and then concludes:</p>
<blockquote><p>[T]<em>he principal practical consequence of the rule, when combined with chief counsel&#8217;s lenient attitude toward complete liquidations, is to permit a subsidiary to make a distribution to its parent without recognizing gain under section 311 or 361(c), and without the parent receiving a section 301 or 356 distribution.  &#8230;  Those consequences may provide clarity, but they provide a very taxpayer-friendly clarity that writes out of the tax law the step transaction doctrine in cases of incomplete liquidation, even though the doctrine remains stated in reg. section 1.331-1(c) and section 346.</em>  Id. at 801.<br /><em>But the step transaction is one of those regulations that states a doctrine established by the Supreme Court in multiple reorganization decisions.  The step transaction doctrine surely can reveal Controlled to be the reorganization successor of Subsidary, and Congress has not provided otherwise.</em><em>Reg. section 1.368-2(k) has</em> [therefore] <em>left the law in a confused state, or perhaps in a near perfect state for spinoff planners who want electivity by form. </em> Id. at 802.</p></blockquote>
<p>Cummings discusses a number of &#8220;basic principles&#8221; &#8212; including Congressional intent that section 332 control the nonrecognition and basis results of liquidations; Congressional support for a &#8220;substantially all&#8221; criterion for reorgs; Congresional treatment of related corporation reorganizations as &#8220;special&#8221;; Congress&#8217;s declining to provide that C reorgs cannot be recharacterized; and the reiteration of the liquidation-reincorporation rule in regulations &#8212; and concludes that they &#8220;<em>counsel strongly against writing a no-recharacterization rule</em>.&#8221; Id. at 806.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Whatever benefrits of certainty Treasury thought it would achieve by eliminating the cross-chain reorganization possibility have been swamped by the uncertainties it left or created &#8230;, the closing agreements the IRS still has to seek, and the gutting of section 311 it has facilitated (not to mention further encouraging the notion that any consolidated group that pays tax on an excess loss account must have a stupid tax director). </em> Id at 806.</p></blockquote>
<p>Cummings concludes that the various &#8220;simplifications&#8221; discussed in the article are troubling:</p>
<blockquote><p>[These simplifications] <em>have led to the unexpected consequence that well-advised subsidiary corporations need never recognize section 311 gain. Perhaps that is good tax policy.  . . .  But usually when that type of tax policy is made it involves the action of Congress, not Treasury, particularly when Congress has indicated a contrary intention by repealing General Utilities</em>.  Id. at 808.</p></blockquote>
<p>Tax practitioners and academics alike have thought that the open, communicative relationship among Treasury and IRS officials and the tax bar, demonstrable at any ABA tax section meeting, is generally good.  It permits the bar to share with government officials real situations that may have escaped attention in a regulatory or legislative development, thus making officials aware of any potentially harmful impact of those proposed regulatory or legislative changes.  At the same time, it allows the bar to comprehend the underlying rationales for proposals, thus providing a sound foundation for policy discussions.</p>
<p>But there are also real problems for tax administration if that relationship grows too cozy at the same time that there exists a continuing revolving door between service at the Treasury or IRS and significant positions as officers in the ABA or state bar associations and as commenters and panelists on regulatory or legislative proposals.  Many of those officials remain in office, while many of their former teammates have resumed their careers and are frequent commenters on regulatory developments. </p>
<p>The taxpayer-friendly developments in the liquidation and reorganization areas under the Bush administration are a predictable result of that sometimes-too-cozy relationship and the corporatism inherent in much corporate tax lobbying.  Regulatory developments &#8212; in particular the regulations regarding recharacterization and gain and loss recognition in the reorg context and the many tax-saving opportunities opened by the check-the-box regs and the decision to recognize &#8220;upstream&#8221; reorganizations (like A reorg mergers of a subsidiary into a parent) &#8211;represent an overture to corporate taxpayers that is not merited by the current economic realities, the longstanding application of the step transaction doctrine in these contexts, nor even the actual language of the tax code. </p>

<p>Is it a fiscal cliff or merely a bump in the road?</p>
<p>Sixty percent of American voters in exit polls indicated that they supported higher taxes for the wealthy, see <a href="http://democrats.senate.gov/2012/11/08/on-taxes-the-voters-have-spoken/">here</a>.  Even some arch conservatives are acknowledging that some tax increases won&#8217;t do terrible harm.  Id. (noting that the Wall Street Journal&#8217;s Stephen Moore acknowledged that Obama &#8220;can claim that he&#8217;s got a voter mandate to do that [raise taxes on the rich].&#8221; Even Conservative Weekly Standard Editor Bill Kristol counseled Republican leadership to get real.</p>
<p>You know what? It won&#8217;t kill the country if Republicans raise taxes a littlbe bit on millionaires.  It really won&#8217;t, I don&#8217;t think.  &#8230;  Really? The Republican party is gonna fall on its sword to defend a bunch of millionaires, half of whom voted Democratic, and half of whom live in Hollywood and are hostile to Republicans?  Nicole Flatow, <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2012/11/11/1176641/weekly-standard-editor-bill-kristol-raising-millionaires-taxes-wont-kill-the-country/?utm_source=PolicyMic+Newsletter&#038;utm_campaign=1172c11df5-New_Newsletter2_29_2012&#038;utm_medium=email&#038;mobile=nc">Weekly Standard Editor Bill Kristol: Raising Millionaires&#8217; Taxes &#8216;Won&#8217;t Kill the Country&#8217;</a>, ThinkProgress (Nov. 11, 2012).</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the House and Senate Republican leadership (Rep. Boehner and Sen. McConnell) are insisting that they will not allow tax rates to rise.   McConnell told Breitbart.com the following:<br />
<blockquote><strong>One issue I’ve never been conflicted about is taxes. I wasn’t sent to Washington to raise anybody’s taxes to pay for more wasteful spending and this election doesn’t change my principles.</strong> This election was a disappointment, without doubt, but let’s be clear about something: <strong>the House is still run by Republicans, and Republicans still maintain a robust minority in the Senate. </strong>I know some people out there think Tuesday’s results mean Republicans in Washington are now going to roll over and agree to Democrat demands that we hike tax rates before the end of the year.<strong> I’m here to tell them there is no truth to that notion whatsoever</strong>.  Annie-Rose Strasser, <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2012/11/09/1169451/mcconnell-no-taxes/">Senate Minority Leader: We Won&#8217;t Raise Taxes At All</a>, ThinkProgress (Nov. 9, 2012).</p></blockquote>
<p>President Obama Friday invited Congress to sign off on a tax cut for the middle class right away&#8211; noting that just extending the Bush tax cuts for those who make less than $250,000 would give a tax cut to 98 percent of Americans and 97 percent of small businesses. </p>

<p>“While there may be disagreements in Congress over whether to raise taxes on people making *over* $250,000 a year, nobody — not Republicans, not Democrats — want taxes to go up for folks making under $250,000 a year,” Obama said. “So let’s not wait.”  Adele M.

<p>Robert Reich, now at the University of California at Berkeley, writes that the game of chicken is on.<br />So who blinks first? Democrats who don’t mind going over the cliff because they’ll get a better final deal – and the deal will be retroactive to January 1<sup>st</sup> so it’s not really a cliff at all but more like a little hill? Or Republicans who want to extend the Bush tax cuts beyond January 1<sup>st</sup>, until we get sufficiently close to the debt ceiling that they can once again threaten the full faith and credit of America?</p>
<p>As I said before, I had naively assumed the election would put an end to these games, but obviously not. Yet Obama and the Democrats are holding most of the cards now. Let’s hope they use them.  Robert Reich, <a href="http://www.salon.com/2012/11/09/get_ready_for_an_economic_game_of_chicken/?source=newsletter">Get ready for an economic game of chicken</a>, Salon.com (Nov. 9, 2012).</p>

<p><a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2012/11/yesterday-i-urged-the-democrats-to-develop-some-backbone-in-response-to-the-continuing-right-wing-extortion-demands-for-milit.html">If the Dems got a backbone</a></p>
<p>Yesterday I urged the Democrats to develop some backbone in response to the continuing right-wing extortion demands for military spending increases, tax cuts and entitlement program changes.<br />How should that backbone be used?  Not an easy question to answer and likely my answer will upset many economists and tax professionals.  So I propose that we consider going over the fiscal cliff.  What do readers think, and why?</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the argument I think can be made.  Given that the &#8220;fiscal cliff&#8221; deal doesn&#8217;t require cuts to social welfare programs, it might be advisable to let the fiscal cliff occur.  Let the spending cuts go through and let the Bush tax cuts expire.  The result will be that we will have taken a much needed first stab at cutting back on the exorbitant military spending that provides rentier profits to the military-industrial complex.  And we will have moved the game back to &#8220;start&#8221; regarding the appropriate kinds of tax cuts to enact.  <br />But there are spending cuts that may not make sense (cuts to public employee pensions) and definitely some tax cuts (and programmatic stimulus) is needed to deal with the continuing slow economic growth.  What if the President and Democrats in Congress provided a clear and transparent plan for dealing with those issues by announcing&#8211;at the same time that they refuse to go along with the GOP extortion demands, that they will press for passage of a reinvigorated tax code and modified spending reduction plan.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>In January, Congress can start with a clean slate and quickly enact [ah, I know, this is the weak point&#8211;can the highly partisan Congress change its ways?] a much more judicious (and limited) set of tax cuts targeted to those with incomes under $100,000 and to industrial policies that make sense for today rather than 100 years ago (such as continuing subsidies for alternative energy while finally ending the various subsidies for the extractive industries like gas and oil and coal).  That should be accompanied by additional reforms to the tax code to simplify it and eliminate unreasonable preferences that favor the rich.  Elimination of the preferential rate for capital gains should be the first priority (and carried interest should be treated as what it is&#8211;delayed payment of compensation).   Reform of the corporate and international tax provisions to eliminate the ability of multinationals dependent primarily on intellectual property to avoid taxation on their profits by transfers to offshore affiliates and similar problems in the tax code related to the globalization of business should be the second one.</p>
<p>Those tax policies would be enacted in tandem with appropriate spending policies:  it is what we want to spend our taxes on, after all, that should decide what our taxation policies are.  We know we need to raise money to repay debt, to build and maintain our long-neglected public infrastructure (highways, bridges, government buildings, high-speed passenger rail, etc.) and to fund needed research and education (NIH, NSF, Pell grants, etc.).   In particular, we need to address the infrastructure and other changes that are necessary to address climate change&#8211;both defending ourselves from its effects to the extent possible (surge protection for New York, for example) and regulating ourselves to reduce the amount of change.  We know we can and must reduce the demands of the military industrial complex through spending cuts. </p>
<p>What might Congress accomplish, if it would approach the budget of the United States from the perspective of considering what we should be doing to make this a better nation, a more prepared and educated people, and a more sustainable economy? </p>

                                <h5>The GOP&#8217;s extortion demands: cut Social Security or we&#8217;ll shoot the country in the foot</h5>
<p>The GOP created the fiscal cliff beginning with the &#8220;temporary&#8221; tax cuts passed in 2001, 2003 and 2004 under the Bush administration, all as purportedly temporary provisions with sunset dates.  They hoped that the passage of the tax cuts would, as generally happens when people have more of something they like, lead people to demand making all of the cuts permanent.  The result would be a huge tax decrease for the wealthiest taxpayers, and a rather insignificant tax decrease for most Americans.</p>
<p>In many ways, their strategy worked.  Most Americans forget that they didn&#8217;t think they really had to have a cut in income taxes back in 2001, and they don&#8217;t want to pay more taxes than they are paying now, even a little bit more.   And the Great Recession means that for many Americans who are suffering deep financial injury still because of the housing and jobs crisis, every tax dollar saved is a step back to normalcy.<br />But the tax cuts pushed by the GOP joined together with the tremendous costs of the preemptive wars pushed by the GOP to create a veritable snowballing deficit. </p>
<p>Under Bush, we went from surplus in year one, to huge deficits the rest of the time (with much of the impact of the deficit hidden by the purportedly temporary nature of the provisions and the annual passage of an AMT patch that didn&#8217;t have to be included in the calculation of the deficit until the particular patch was passed).  Those two huge drivers of the deficit were treated by the GOP at the time as inconsequential, as GOP stars claimed that &#8220;deficits don&#8217;t matter.&#8221;  See <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/opinion/index.ssf/2012/07/dick_cheney_to_congressional_r.html">Dick Cheney to Congressional Republicans: don&#8217;t stop spending</a>, The Oregonian (July 18, 2012) (noting Cheney&#8217;s current advice to keep spending on the military and retelling the story of Cheney&#8217;s telling then Treasury secretary O&#8217;Neill that &#8220;Reagan proved that deficits don&#8217;t matter&#8221;).</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Part of the right&#8217;s goal, of course, was to use the increases in deficits that their tax cuts caused as a rationale for &#8220;starving the beast&#8221;&#8211;forcing the Democrats to accept cuts (they of course called them &#8220;reforms&#8221;) to the parts of governnment that the right doesn&#8217;t like.  That meant reduction to the benefits from, and privatization of, Social Security and Medicare and reduction of government employee pensions and maybe, in a far right dream world, the elimination of any federal role in basic research funding, disaster emergency responses, and education.  Meanwhile, the right would continue to push for increased spending on the parts of government it likes (military spending, for example&#8211;see Cheney&#8217;s July 2012 admonition to the GOP to keep spending on the military, above) and continued favorable tax subsidies for the wealthy and big corporations (carried interest, domestic manufacturing deduction, etc.) even if that continued to add to the deficit and the debt. </p>
<p>The GOP&#8217;s tune changed when the flagrant underregulation of the financialized economy (deregulation, of course, having been begun with Reagan and continued for decades now) resulted in the financial crisis that became the Great Recession and then a Democrat was elected president.  GOP lawmakers suddenly thought deficits were bad (when they were created by Democratic presidents to respond to crisis).  And debt&#8211;which had been spiralling upwards under the Bush regime with increases in debt ceiling hardly noticed&#8211;suddenly was a monster that must be contained.  And all of this could be used by those on the radicalized right every time the debt ceiling had to be increased to extort from those not on the right the right&#8217;s desired changes in social justice programs. </p>
<p>In other words, the radicalized GOP set the conditions in motion that allowed them to hold us hostage now, through their control of the House of Representatives, in an extortion campaign.  In that campaign,  they demand that they get the changes to Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid that they want (the so-called &#8220;reforms&#8221; to so-called &#8220;entitlement&#8221; programs that amount to the beginning of the unraveling of the New Deal that the right so detests) in exchange for their going along with increases to the debt ceiling that are necessary because of the irresponsible tax and spending policies that they pursued while in office or the measures that were necessary to shore up the financial system when it threatened collapse due to the deregulatory push that has gone on for forty years funded by and supported by the right (and some  Dems in the middle as well). </p>
<p>So guess what.  We shouldn&#8217;t be surprised at all to hear today that U.S. House Speaker John Boehner says the GOP rightwingers will maybe agree to some &#8220;revenue&#8221; increases so long as they get their extortion payments&#8211;concessions from liberals that will ultimately lead to the reduction and/or privatization of Social Security and Medicare and other government programs.  And of course this is double-speak anyway, since Boehner and his compatriots on the GOP right still ascribe to the frequently disproven  market fundamentalism that believes that deregulation and &#8220;simplification&#8221; (meaning tax cuts) leads to economic growth that automatically results in revenue increases even without tax changes intended to raise more tax monies. </p>
<p>As Tiron and Rubin note in the Bloomberg piece reporting on Boehner&#8217;s statements, his speech &#8220;sounded conciliatory and didn&#8217;t alter the Republican position on tax policy&#8221; but &#8220;marked the start of political positioning and negotiations over what to do about the so-called fiscal cliff of $607 billion in combined tax increases and spending cuts.&#8221;   He isn&#8217;t agreeing to tax increases: he just wants to be able to use the kind of  manipulative tweaking of the data to get the desired result called &#8220;dynamic scoring&#8221; that the GOP right has been pushing for decades as a way to &#8220;prove&#8221; that their deficit-creating tax cuts really aren&#8217;t costing anything!  See Roxana Tiron and Richard Rubin, <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-07/boehner-would-accept-new-revenue-under-right-conditions-.html">Boehner Would Accept New Revenue under &#8216;Right Conditions&#8217;</a>, Bloomberg.com (Nov. 7, 2012)</p>
<p>Boehner called for concessions, stating &#8220;The president must be willing to reduce spending and shore up entitlement programs that are the primary drivers of our debt.&#8221;  Id.</p>
<p><a href="http://reid.senate.gov/">Harry Reid</a> (Senate majority leader) said &#8220;We&#8217;re happy to deal with entitlements, but we&#8217;re not messing with Social Security.&#8221;  It&#8217;s hard to know for sure what that means&#8211;maybe they are willing to reduce Medicaid and Medicare benefits? Too bad he didn&#8217;t say that we need to expand Obamacare to make it Medicare for all, so that we can get control of health care costs while providing much needed support particularly to the elderly at the end of life.  But at least he did say something that should translate to &#8220;we are not going to change Social Security.&#8221;</p>
<p>So the game is on.  The GOP intends to continue pushing its same old medicine of tax cuts for the rich and entitlement cuts for the rest of us.  I hope the Democrats have gained a little bit of backbone from the election so that they will push for wiser spending on public infrastructure and wiser tax policies in areas from estate and capital gains taxes to corporate subsidies. </p>

<p> Tax Relief for Victims of Sandy</p>
<p> The IRS released several bulletins this week providing relief for victims of Hurricane Sandy.<br /><a href="http://www.irs.gov/uac/Newsroom/IRS-Provides-Tax-Relief-to-Victims-of-Hurricane-Sandy;-Return-Filing-and-Tax-Payment-Deadline-Extended-to-Feb.-1,-2013">IR-2012-83</a> extends the return filing and tax payment deadline to Feb. 1, 2013 for hurricane  victims in Connecticut (Fairfield, Middlesex, New Haven, and New London Counties; the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation and the Mohegan Tribal Nationa within New London County), New Jersey (Atlantic, Bergen, Cape May, Essex, Hudson, MIddlesex, Monmouth, Ocean, Somerset, and Union) and New York (Bronx, Kings, Nassau, New York, Queens, Richmond, Rockland, Suffolk and Westchester).  The New Jersey relief starts with the Oct. 26 onset of the storm, while the Connecticut and New York relief start Oct. 27.  The release notes that the relief may be extended to taxpayers in other locations &#8220;based on additional damage assessments by FEMA. </p>
<p>The tax relief postpones various tax filing and payment deadlines that occurred starting in late October. As a result, affected individuals and businesses will have until Feb. 1, 2013 to file these returns and pay any taxes due. This includes the fourth quarter individual estimated tax payment, normally due Jan. 15, 2013. It also includes payroll and excise tax returns and accompanying payments for the third and fourth quarters, normally due on Oct. 31, 2012 and Jan. 31, 2013 respectively. It also applies to tax-exempt organizations required to file Form 990 series returns with an original or extended deadline falling during this period. </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Penalties and interest that would otherwise apply will not apply, and taxpayers don&#8217;t have to apply for this basic filing extension.  Failure-to-deposit penalties for deposites due when Sandy struck or later are waived if the deposits are made by Nov. 26, 2012. Details on this are available at <a href="http://links.govdelivery.com/track?type=click&#038;enid=ZWFzPTEmbWFpbGluZ2lkPTIwMTIxMTA3LjExODcxODUxJm1lc3NhZ2VpZD1NREItUFJELUJVTC0yMDEyMTEwNy4xMTg3MTg1MSZkYXRhYmFzZWlkPTEwMDEmc2VyaWFsPTE3MjQzNzE0JmVtYWlsaWQ9bGJlYWxlQHdheW5lLmVkdSZ1c2VyaWQ9bGJlYWxlQHdheW5lLmVkdSZmbD0mZXh0cmE9TXVsdGl2YXJpYXRlSWQ9JiYm&#038;&#038;&#038;114&#038;&#038;&#038;http://www.irs.gov/uac/Tax-Relief-in-Disaster-Situations">disaster relief</a>.   </p>
<p>The IRS also noted that it will work with taxpayers who don&#8217;t live in the designated areas &#8220;but whose books, records or tax professional are located in the areas affected by Hurricane Sandy.&#8221;  Those taxpayers do need to contact the IRS to claim the relief.  The number to call is 866-562-5227.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.irs.gov/uac/Hurricane-Sandy-Qualified-Treatment-of-Payments">IR-2012-84</a> alerts employers and others that qualified disaster relief payments made by an employer or other person in respect of damage from Hurricane Sandy (which has been designated a &#8220;qualified disaster&#8221;) can be excludible from taxable income and that &#8220;employer-sp9onsored private foundations may provide disaster relief to employee-victims in areas affected by the hurricane without affecting their tax-exempt status.<br />Qualified disaster relief payments include amounts to cover necessary personal, family, living or funeral expenses that were not covered by insurance. They also include expenses to repair or rehabilitate personal residences or repair or replace the contents to the extent that they were not covered by insurance.<br /><a href="http://www.irs.gov/uac/Newsroom/Treasury-and-IRS-Expand-Availability-of-Housing-for-Hurricane-Sandy-Victims">IR-2012-86</a>  expands availability of housing for victims of Hurricane Sandy by temporarily waiving the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-Income_Housing_Tax_Credit">low-income housing tax credit</a> rules that prohibit owners of low-income housing from providing housing to Sandy victims who do not qualify as low-income.</p>
<p>Other assistance through FEMA may be available:<br />Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the disaster. FEMA has also approved Transitional Sheltering Assistance (TSA) in New York and New Jersey for eligible disaster survivors who have a continuing need for shelter because they are unable to return to their homes for an extended period of time. Individuals and business owners who sustained losses can apply for assistance from FEMA by calling 1-800-621-FEMA (3362) via mobile device at m.fema.gov, or online at <a href="http://links.govdelivery.com/track?type=click&#038;enid=ZWFzPTEmbWFpbGluZ2lkPTIwMTIxMTA3LjExODcyNjIxJm1lc3NhZ2VpZD1NREItUFJELUJVTC0yMDEyMTEwNy4xMTg3MjYyMSZkYXRhYmFzZWlkPTEwMDEmc2VyaWFsPTE3MjQzNzYwJmVtYWlsaWQ9bGJlYWxlQHdheW5lLmVkdSZ1c2VyaWQ9bGJlYWxlQHdheW5lLmVkdSZmbD0mZXh0cmE9TXVsdGl2YXJpYXRlSWQ9JiYm&#038;&#038;&#038;124&#038;&#038;&#038;http://apps.irs.gov/app/scripts/exit.jsp?dest=http://www.disasterassistance.gov/">http://apps.irs.gov/app/scripts/exit.jsp?dest=http://www.disasterassistance.gov/</a></p>

<p> GOP didn&#8217;t like the study on impact of tax cuts on economic growth</p>
<p> The Congressional Research Service has long been respected as a non-partisan research organization that does in-depth studies as requested by Congress.  But when those non-partisan studies produce results that don&#8217;t jive with the right-wing mythology about tax cuts as the cure-all for slow economic growth, the right goes on the attack.</p>
<p>On September 14, 2012, the Congressional Research Service released a report by Tom Hungerford on the impact of tax cuts on economic growth.  Tom Hungerford,<a href="http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/PDF/0915taxesandeconomy.pdf">Taxes and the Economy: An economic analysis of top tax rates since 1945</a> (CRS, Sept. 14, 2012). </p>
<p>Advocates of lower tax rates argue that reduced rates would increase economic growth, increase saving and investment, and boost productivity (increase the economic pie). Proponents of higher tax rates argue that higher tax revenues are necessary for debt reduction, that tax rates on the rich are too low (i.e., they violate the Buffett rule), and that higher tax rates on the rich would moderate increasing income inequality (change how the economic pie is distributed). This report attempts to clarify whether or not there is an association between the tax rates of the highest income taxpayers and economic growth.</p>
<p>This was an update of a report by Jane Gravelle and Donald J. Marples, <em>Tax Rates and Economic<em> Growth, CRS (</em></em>CRS Report R42111) and so was not an attempt to rewrite that report but to look only at the top tax rates.  </p>
<p>The Hungerford study didn&#8217;t find a correlation between lowering top tax rates and economic growth, but it did find one between lowering top tax rates and increasing inequality. </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>The share of income accruing to the top 0.1% of U.S. families increased from 4.2% in 1945 to 12.3% by 2007 before falling to 9.2% due to the 2007-2009 recession. The evidence does not suggest necessarily a relationship between tax policy withregard to the top tax rates and the size of the economic pie, but there may be a relationship to how the economic pie is sliced. Id.</p>
<p>That is in fact what one would expect, and increased inequality has its own harmful effects on the economy.<br />On September 17,  the Heritage Foundation squawked about the Hungerford study.  See <a href="http://blog.heritage.org/2012/09/17/congressional-research-service-wrongly-implies-lower-tax-rates-dont-strengthen-economy/">Congressional Research Service Wrongly Implies Lower Tax Rates Don&#8217;t Strengthen Economy</a>, Heritage Foundation (Sept. 17, 2012).  Heritage acknowledges that the Hungerford report looks at a &#8220;slew of time periods&#8221; but it claims that the &#8220;simplistic correlations prove nothing.&#8221;  Id.  It suggests that since no two timeframes can be exactly the same, the correlations are meaningless.  If only the study had been tweaked the way the Heritage Foundation would have tweaked it, it would have supported Heritage&#8217;s position that lower tax rates on the top produce economic growth, it suggests.</p>
<p>But this is itself a simplistic analysis. The complaint that the paper didn&#8217;t take all the variables into account is a red herring.  The study offered a simple correlation study&#8211;looking just at the tax rates and economic growth, does a pattern emerge upholding the GOP view that tax cuts stimulate growth or not.  The answer is &#8220;not&#8221;.  Now, there are lots of other variables that could be considered&#8211;global warming, military involvement, and decaying infrastructure are all likely relevant to how we should spend our resources and likely also have a significant impact on the economy.  But self-serving assumptions about the &#8220;dynamic&#8221; effect of tax cuts are not.  For the broader view on tax rate analyses, Hungerford refers the reader to the 2011 Gravelle paper.  The problem with economic analyses in the market fundamentalist approach is that the answer can be manipulated by tweaking the selected data points, the time lag between policy and a change point, the way the discount rate is chosen, or whatever.   The Heritage position confuses savings and investment, missing the point that when interest rates are already down, savings can&#8217;t have much impact in reducing interest rates to make investment more attractive. </p>
<p>The  outcome of the right&#8217;s attack on a CRS study that came to a result it didn&#8217;t like is worrisome.  Instead of noting the limited goal of the paper (to see if there were correlations over time of tax rates and economic growth), the CRS yielded to pressure and pulled the study. See Jonathan Weisman, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/02/business/questions-raised-on-withdrawal-of-congressional-research-services-report-on-tax-rates.html?emc=tnt&#038;tntemail1=y">Nonpartisan Report Withdrawn after GOP Protest</a>, New York Times (Nov. 1, 2012). The withdrawal was counter to the recommendation of the service&#8217;s economic leaders. That says that CRS is vulnerable to pressure from those who want a study to show a particular outcome.  And that is not good.</p>

<p> Romney&#8217;s CRUT Tax Shelter\</p>
<p> The Bloomberg press has looked further at Romney&#8217;s use of trusts and other arrangements to avoid taxes, using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_information_legislation">Freedom of Information Act</a> requests to obtain more information than was released by Romney in his meager tax return release. Romney established a charitable trust in 1996 of a type that Congress cracked down on in 1997 (regrettably, a crackdown that grandfathered existing arrangements, which is the way so many rich people get to keep using abusive shelters). See Jesse Drucker, <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-29/romney-avoids-taxes-via-loophole-cutting-mormon-donations.html">Romney Avoids Taxeds via Loophole Cutting Mormon Donations</a>, Bloomberg.com (Oct. 29, 2012).</p>
<p>So what did Romney do.  He used a &#8220;charitable remainder unitrust&#8221; (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charitable_trust">CRUT</a>) in a way that alllowed him to use the tax-exempt status of the Mormon Church (his primary charitable beneficiary) to defer taxes for more than 15 years.  The trust benefits Romney considerably, by letting him benefit from the tax-free treatment that the charitable beneficiary has when they sell assets for a profit.and leaves the church less than current law requires for a trust.   And it favors Romney over the church, because he gets a guaranteed payout from the trust (which converted most of its assets to cash in 2007) and the church only gets what&#8217;s left at the end, if anything.  Current trends suggest there won&#8217;t be anything left for the charity at the end. </p>
<p>“The main benefit from a charitable remainder trust is the renting from your favorite charity of its exemption from taxation,” [Jonathan] Blattmachr [, a trusts and estates lawyer] said. Despite the name, giving a gift or getting a charitable deduction “is just a throwaway,” he said. “I used to structure them so the value dedicated to charity was as close to zero as possible without being zero.”</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>When individuals fund a charitable remainder unitrust, or “CRUT,” they defer capital gains taxes on any profit from the sale of the assets, and receive a small upfront charitable deduction and a stream of yearly cash payments. Like an individual retirement account, the trust allows money to grow tax deferred, while like an annuity it also pays Romney a steady income. After the funder’s death, the trust’s remaining assets go to a designated charity.</p>
<p>Romney’s CRUT, which is only a small part of the $250 million that Romney’s campaign cites as his net worth, has been paying him 8 percent of its assets each year. As the Romneys have received these payments, the money that will potentially be left for charity has declined from at least $750,000 in 2001 to $421,203 at the end of 2011. Id.</p>
<p>Under the 1997 change to the law, Congress required that the present value projected to be left for charity must equal at least 10% of the initial contribution. Romney&#8217;s CRUT doesn&#8217;t satisfy this requirement but was grandfathered in.  The principal of the CRUT has dwindled to about half what it was.  In the meantime, the Romney&#8217;s have enjoyed considerable tax savings due to the way the CRUT works.</p>
<p>This information is revealing for two reasons.  First, it demonstrates yet again that the Romney&#8217;s are eager to use whatever mechanisms they can to reduce taxes, even though their millions are due in no small part to the way taxpayers make business possible (from courts to roads to police to the military to &#8220;rule of law&#8221; to relatively low funding costs for borrowing in the United States, etc.).   One suspects that the reason Romney has stonewalled the public on his tax returns is that there is lots more of this nature shown therein, including possibly his participation in voluntary disclosure regarding offshore accounts (that otherwise might have resulted in criminal tax evasion charges).</p>
<p>Second, it shows that Congress recognized that CRUTs didn&#8217;t make sense.  So we have to ask why Congress didn&#8217;t eliminate CRUTs altogether, rather than continuing to allow the gambit, and why, if it were going to continue to allow the gambit, it didn&#8217;t terminate the favorable treatment of any existing CRUT that didn&#8217;t satisfy the minimal funding requirement the new law included (10% of the original contribution has to go to charity before the donor can enjoy the immense benefit of the capital gains deferral thereby).   Congress should allow the estate tax to lapse back to the pre-Bush levels, and it should then buttress the estate tax by legislating the end to the many different devices used by estate lawyers to get around the tax while still providing most of the benefits of the assets to the estate planners&#8211;CRUTs and similar estate-planning trusts are prime targets for action by Congress.</p>

<p>Growing inequality calls for both &#8220;predistribution&#8221; and (rightly directed) redistribution</p>
<p>In putting forward my theme of <em>democratic egalitarianism</em>, I have often noted that there is no such thing as an economically egalitarian society&#8211;there will always be differentials among people, those differences often relate to social class and the education, privileged upbringing, and networking connections that ensure success for some and deny success to others as well as to innate abilities, so that those differences inevitably translate into some being better off economically than others.   </p>
<p>Because of those differences, the &#8220;powers that be&#8221;&#8211;i.e., existing concentrations of financial assets, prestige and associated political power among the privileged class at the very top of the income and wealth distribution&#8211; result in<em> redistribution </em><em>upwards</em> from poor and middle class to the upper crust.  And most in that privileged upper-crust think they&#8217;ve acquired it all on the basis of their own merit and that the reason others don&#8217;t have it is because they are irresponsible, don&#8217;t work hard enough, don&#8217;t have a good business sense or are just incompetent. </p>
<p>(That is of course the tale told by the like of Mitt Romney at his private fundraiser in Flordia, where he revealed his utter disdain for half of the US population and his self-indulging belief that he got where he is entirely on his own merit .  He can&#8217;t even see, much less acknowledge, either his silver-spoon upbringing of class, wealth and connections or the various government-subsidized upwards redistribution from which he has benefited through capital gains preferences, carried interest treatment, disregard of the harm caused by his leveraged-buyout business model, and government subsidies through high-value government contracts and low-cost government loans.) </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Therefore, I have argued,  democratic institutions (government, programs, policies) must target achieving a sustainable economy that provides a decent livelihood for all.  They must also prevent inordinate inequality, because huge inequality among the citizenry foils all attempts to achieve either a sustainable economy or sustainable democratic institutions. </p>
<p>That means that government policies must focus on creating paths for <em>redistribution</em><em>downwards</em> from the upper crust to the middle and lower classes, undoing the corporatist top-down approach that has supported <em>class warfare</em> and allowed the wealthy to capture most of the productivity gains since Reagan&#8217;s presidency.  Two government systems can work, on the margins, to achieve some level of downwards redistribution&#8211;benefits and taxes.  Benefits do so by providing a safety net under those most vulnerable who have never achieved a sustainable economic livelihood&#8211;the unemployed and unemployable, the sick, the elderly, the children who have poor schools, poor families, and inadequate shelter, nutrition and opportunity.  Taxes do so by taking more from those who have grabbed an inordinate portion of the resource pie and using those revenues to fund benefits as well as infrastructure (human and physical) that supports the efforts by ordinary Americans to achieve sustainable livelihoods.</p>
<p>We have been moving backwards on both of these systems.  The radical right has spent the last 30-40 years pushing an agenda that ultimately wants to (i) dismantle or radically reduce benefits programs (voucherizing medicare, privatizing social security, cutting back on unemployment, allowing states to reduce medicaid and children&#8217;s health coverage, etc.) and (ii) eliminate taxes on corporations and the primary source of income of high-wealth individuals through a gradual reduction in progressive rate structure, elimination of the estate tax, elimination of capital gains taxes (and treatment of wealthy people&#8217;s wages as though they were capital gains, through provisions like stock options and carried interest).  Paul Ryan&#8217;s positions on Medicare and Social Security should be a clarion-call to get out the vote&#8211;against the Romney-Ryan ticket&#8211; of every person who does not earn more than $300,000 a year.   The Norquist-Koch Brothers-Karl Rove-Ryan-Romney agenda on taxes should similarly cause ordinary Americans who earn less than $300,000 a year to take to the streets and to refuse to vote for any member of the GOP.</p>
<p> Recall that the beginning of the current trend towards too little tax revenues and especially too little taxation of the ultra rich was radical reduction of rates with purported base-broadening (such as elimination of the capital gains preference, creation and then ramping up of the alternative minimum tax).  As could be expected, lower rates lived on (and were lowered even more by Bush) but much of the base broadening was short-lived:  lobbying by the privileged at the top led to a quick return to a capital gains preference and the undoing of the AMT as an inequality leveler.  The Bush tax cuts rewarded corporate owners and managers and the wealthy class with extraordinary tax relief, while imposing long-term deficits on the country, behind a cheerful facade of &#8220;tax simplification&#8221; that was irrelevant for the 70% of the population that uses the standard deduction.</p>
<p>There is a third leg to the reduction-of-inequality stool.  Tax reform that restores a truly progressive income tax is one leg.  Benefit reform that builds on the achievements of the New Deal rather than destroying them is another.  The third leg is what some call &#8220;predistribution&#8221;&#8211;paying attention to the means by which the uppercrust has seized all of the productivity gains and reduced the ability of everyone else to have a decent, sustainable livelihood. </p>
<p>British Labour leader Ed Miliband has called for predistribution as a new agenda in Britain.  See <em>Predistribution: A Big New Idea</em>, Noted, The Nation (Oct. 8, 2012), at 5. <br />The term [predistribution] was coined by US political scientist Jacob Hacker, who in 2011 noted that discussions of government responses to inequality often begin and end with redistribution [downwards]&#8211;taxing the rich to provide benefits for the rest.  But that&#8217;s only half the equation, Hacker said, uring progressives to pay more attention to &#8216;the way in which the market distributes its rewards in the first place.&#8217; That includes regulations that protect consumers and empower workers: &#8216;The regulation of markets to limit extremes and give the middle class more voice is hardly easy. &#8230; But it is both more popular and more effective than after-the-fact mopping up.&#8217;</p>
<p>Milibrand agrees.  Noting the high human cost of austerity, he said, &#8216;We need to care about predistribution as well as redistribution.&#8217; After trying &#8216;to make work pay better by spending more on trasfer payments,&#8217; he argued, government must &#8216;also make work pay better by making work itself pay.&#8217;</p>
<p>These concepts&#8211;predistribution (making up for malfunctioning markets to make work itself pay) and redistribution downwards (actual reallocation from market results through taxation and benefit policies)&#8211;are closely interrelated.  Successful redistribution downwards augments the ability of workers to afford necessities and small luxuries, and that economic activity empowers workers in the markets and gives workers an opportunity for a voice in the markets and workplaces compared to a position where employers and owners have almost dictatorial control and can garner all the workers&#8217; productivity gains for themselves.  Focus on predistribution, however, reminds us that worker rights are essential to a sustainable, broad-based economy</p>
<p>What kinds of rights are we talking about?  Surely a critical right is the workers&#8217; right to collective bargaining (supported by a &#8220;yes&#8221; vote on Proposal 2 in Michigan that would put that right in the state constitution where it could not be removed by the radical right legislative block).  Surely the right of the state to build infrastructure (that will create worker jobs) rather than allowing a wealthy tycoon to corner the market on international bridge crossings in Detroit and hog the revenues for himself rather than allow them to be earned by the people (Proposal 6, vote &#8220;no&#8221; so that Matty doesn&#8217;t have veto power allowing him to co-opt public infrastructure for his private profits).</p>
<p>Predistribution pays attention to how much ordinary workers are paid compared to how much the managers at the top get out of a company.  We should be &#8220;pushing local employers to narrow the pay ratio between the top and the bottom ranks of their workforce.&#8221;  Id.  For too long, we have acted like it is just fine for the &#8220;market&#8221; to demand that the wealthy be allowed to exploit communities and workers for their own benefit.  We need to say no.</p>
<p>Predistribution pays attention to regulations that protect workers&#8211;from worker safety to time off to family leave. It disregards the multinational corporations&#8217; pleas for laws to suit them and instead asks why we should be subsidizing their ability to move active business assets to foreign countries and leave US workers unemployed.  It acnkowledges that we have for too long allowed corporate owners and managers to snow us with their claims that &#8220;globalization&#8221; and &#8220;free trade&#8221; worked for our benefit, when in fact these are excuses for offshoring jobs so that the owners and managers can enjoy even higher &#8220;rent&#8221; profits.  As Milbrand says, &#8220;It&#8217;s just not true that all the top CEOs will leave the country unless we pay them whatever they demand.&#8221;  Id.</p>
