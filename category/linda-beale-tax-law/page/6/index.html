<p>Tax Foundation Misses the Ball (again) in its analysis of Supreme Court Health Care Ruling</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.taxfoundation.org/">Tax Foundation</a> pretends to be non-partisan.  Of course we all know that is pretense.  Look at the way it has pushed its concept of the so-called &#8220;tax freedom day&#8221;, which misleads everyday Americans into thinking that they are working for months and months to pay taxes, based on the use of &#8220;average&#8221; tax burdens across every American from Bill Gates to Joe Unemployed and a good deal of uncertainty about just who pays what taxes (like the corporate taxes).</p>
<p>They&#8217;ve done it again in their analysis of the health care decision.  See Richard Morrison and Joseph Henchman, Tax Foundation, <a href="http://www.heraldnews.com/newsnow/x1660542461/GUEST-OPINION-The-tax-flaw-in-health-care-ruling">Guest Opinion, The Tax Flaw in Health Care Ruling</a>, The Hearld News (July 3, 2012).</p>
<p>1.  The Tax Foundation builds its conclusion into its description of the givens.<br />They start out with their conclusion&#8211;a definition of taxes as items whose intent is &#8220;raising revenue for government spending&#8221; and of a &#8220;penalty&#8221; as &#8220;imposed for the purpose of punishing an individual for an unlawful act.&#8221;  Based on that conclusory definition, they conclude unsurprisingly that the ACA&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individual_mandate">individual mandate</a> is not a tax, because it is a penalty.  That kind of argument has the cart leading the horse.<br />Taxes do increase revenues, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that they cannot also be used to modify behavior, which is what penalties do.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>The obvious type of taxes that act as penalties are excise taxes. There is considerable discussion about &#8220;sin taxes&#8221;&#8211;taxes on cigarettes, alcohol, and other commodities or behaviors that are disliked.  If the person engages in the &#8216;bad&#8217; behavior, the person pays the tax penalty and at least the government gets some revenue from the misbehavior.  If the person is discouraged from engaging in the bad behavior because of the tax penalty, the penalty has done its job and there is more of the desired good behavior.  Tax penalties also exist in our current income tax laws&#8211;the &#8220;singles penalty&#8221;, as mentioned in a prior post, causes a single person to pay more tax than that person would if married, thus penalizing the person for failure to marry.  (Conversely, in situations where there is a <a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2012/07/paul-morenos-short-history-of-the-taxing-power.html">marriage penalty</a>, the tax causes a married person to pay more tax than that person would if single, thus penalizing the person for failure to divorce.)  And there are many credits and other items that can be seen as simply notational variations on a penalty.  For example, the greater tax that childless couples pay than couples of the same income with children pay can easily be viewed as a tax penalty for not having children.</p>
<p>2.  The Tax Foundation tries to raise fears of a bad impact for states<br />The Tax Foundation&#8217;s next argument is the old &#8220;slippery slope&#8221; problem (and depends on the success of their first, unsuccessful, argument).  Since it claims the tax versus penalty distinction is &#8220;vital&#8221;, and there are local and state government revenue sources that are not generally thought of as taxes, the Foundation also claims that the Supreme Court&#8217;s purported broadening of the concept of tax could mean those state and local items must also be treated as taxes for state law purposes, and this could mean that they will be subject to different procedural rules for taxes rather than the procedural rules under which they were passed.<br />This appears beyond silly.   What it does mean for states is that a state like Massachusetts, that had already passed a state health care law with a mandate similar to the ACA&#8217;s mandate, can rest assured that it is not an unconstitutional form of tax.</p>
<p>3.  The Tax Foundation misunderstands the relationship between the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commerce_Clause">Commerce Clause</a> and the Taxing Power<br />The Foundation didn&#8217;t want the mandate upheld, and the right-wing is fighting hard for a much narrower view of the Commerce Clause with the idea of preventing progressives from undertaking needed national policies.  The Court found the Commerce Clause didn&#8217;t extend to the mandate, a conclusion which seems extraordinarily weak to me and which I predict will be overturned by another Court within thirty years.<br />But the Commerce Clause doesn&#8217;t decide the case, because the taxing power is even broader than the Commerce Clause power.  And Roberts rightly recognized that.  This was not a &#8220;twisting [of] the traditional and historic meaning of a tax&#8221; but rather the expected and predictable analysis based on the traditional and historic understanding of the taxing power.</p>
<p>4. The Tax Foundation raises the &#8220;direct&#8221; tax issue<br />Tax academics have devoted a lot of discussion to consider what would be a direct tax that had to be apportioned among the states.  Calvin Johnson, Professor at the University of Texas,  wrote an interesting book looking into the history of the Constitutional Convention as motivated in large part by a desire to get around the weak taxing power of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articles_of_Confederation">Articles of Confederation</a>, which required requisitions from the states to allow a strong taxing power in the federal government.  the passage of the income tax amendment&#8211;contravening any need for apportionment&#8211;pretty much left the direct/apportioned taxes as an archaic category.</p>
<p>The article cclaims that the mandate can&#8217;t fall within the income tax since it is a flat tax.  But of course everyone knows that the Tax Foundation and every other right-wing organization thinks that a flat tax on income is constitutional. </p>
<p>The Tax Foundation is quite simply wrong in suggesting that this is a &#8220;new&#8221; definition of tax.<br />(By the way, the Tax Foundation also attributes the entire opinion (and the purported &#8220;new definition&#8221;) to Chief Justice Roberts.  He was the author of the opinion for the Court, but the opinion represents the views of a majority of the Supreme Court Justices.  It is not just Roberts&#8217; opinion. )</p>

<p>Paul Moreno&#8217;s &#8220;short history&#8221; of the taxing power</p>
<p>At the May meeting of the American Bar Association Tax Section, Jaspar (Jack) Cummings  (a well-renowned tax practitioner who has written extensively on the Supreme Court&#8217;s tax jurisprudence) and I gave a joint keynote speech for the Tax Section&#8217;s Diversity Committee.  Our address covered various aspects of Supreme Court jurisprudence past, present, and expected future.  While we disagreed on many interpretative details, there was one thing that we were both quite clear on:  the insurance mandate in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient_Protection_and_Affordable_Care_Act">Affordable Care Act</a> should (and, we predicted, would) be upheld as a constitutional exercise of the taxing power. </p>
<p>Today&#8217;s Wall Street Journal ran an op-ed by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Moreno">Paul Moreno</a>, titled &#8220;A Short History of Congress&#8217;s Power to Tax&#8221; (July 7, 2012).  The problem with the history is that it mentions a few items from the Constitutional Convention history, and then selectively wanders through a few Supreme Court cases.  It ultimately asserts that Robert&#8217;s opinion for the majority on the health insurance in the Supreme Court&#8217;s decision on the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act in NFIB v. Sibelius was &#8220;dangerous to constitutional government&#8221; because it supported an &#8220;unlimited taxing power.&#8221;</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Maybe historians (Moreno is a historian at <a href="http://www.hillsdale.edu/">Hillsdale College</a>) should leave tax analysis to tax experts.  Let me say this here for the record:  the Supreme Court would have looked utterly foolish if it had failed to uphold the mandate as an exercise of the taxing power.   As noted by another commentator, failure to recognize the mandate&#8217;s legitimacy under the taxing power would suggest that it was unconstitutional to tax to insure those under age 65, while Medicare is constitutional for taxing those at 65 or over.  Further, it would make an impossible distinction between the insurance mandate&#8217;s penalty provision and what could be called the Internal Revenue Code&#8217;s marriage mandate penalty provision&#8221;.  That is, the income tax sometimes taxes singles more than married couples, resulting in what is called a &#8220;singles penalty&#8221;&#8211;higher taxation on earnings to a single person than would result for that person in a married couple.    (There is also sometimes a<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage_penalty">marriage penalty</a>.  All this depends on how the progressivity of the Code rate structure interacts with the fact that we don&#8217;t treat every &#8220;tub on its own bottom&#8221;.)</p>

<p>One in 189 of those with $200,000 or more in AGI paid no federal taxes in 2009</p>
<p>[edited 5/30 to correct &#8220;one in four&#8221; goof]</p>
<p>The IRS recently released another &#8220;statistics of income&#8221; report. This one has news that should make most ordinary Americans think twice about the GOP agenda of reducing taxes for the rich while cutting back on all kinds of programs that serve ordinary Americans&#8211;the fact that a <strong>large percentage of the upper crust&#8211;one out of every 189 Americans with $200,000 or more in income &#8211;pay no federal income taxes whatsoever</strong>. See Rubin, <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-05-29/irs-finds-one-in-189-high-earners-paid-no-2009-u-s-tax.html">IRS Finds One in 189 High Earners Paid No U.S. Taxes in 2009</a>, Bloomberg.com (May 29, 2012).</p>
<p>How does someone with $200,000 or more in income pay no taxes, when ordinary folk with jobs who make $50,000 to $75,000 pay 15% to 25% of their income in taxes? 
<ul>
<li>As I&#8217;ve often discussed here (see items under charitable contribution deduction), rich folk can easily afford to give away more to charity and they get a tax bonus that is much more than that available to poorer folk when they do so. They get an especially big break if what they give away is appreciated stock that they bought a while ago&#8211;and rich folks own most of these financial assets, so they are the ones that get almost exclusive enjoyment of this lucrative loophole: they get to deduct the full value of the stock they donate, without having ever paid taxes on the appreciation. That&#8217;s one of the boondoggles in the Code that Congress can and should get rid of, no matter what else it does about taxes. </li>
<li>Another way rich folk pay less in taxes is by ensuring that the income they earn is of a type that isn&#8217;t subject to tax. Big CEOs generally have rich pension plans and other forms of deferred tax compensation that facilitate lowering their tax bills. Rich folk are the buyers of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipal_bond">municipal bonds</a>, which again enjoy a specific tax break in section 103 of the Code that excludes the interest income from the owners&#8217; tax returns. This is supposed to help municipalities, since the tax break gives the wealthy an incentive to buy the bonds even though they pay lower rates, since all the interest is tax free. But it is a costly break that provides an advantage only for the rich. Wouldn&#8217;t it be better to eliminate it and tax wealthy people on all of their interest income at ordinary income rates? Maybe the tax money could also fund programs for important municipal projects&#8211;like intracity rail transportation in Detroit, a much needed idea whose time has come&#8230;.. </li>
<li>A third way that rich people avoid taxes is by having so many deductions&#8211;high-end medical &#8220;equipment&#8221; (like swimming pools for arthritic patients), lots of interest on mortgages on high-end homes, and other deductions of special value to those who would otherwise pay tax at a higher rate.</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />As the Rubin article notes, the IRS announced that for 2009 there were 10,080 households with &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjusted_gross_income">adjusted gross income</a>&#8221; of $200,000 or more who paid no US or foreign income taxes. Adjusted gross income is not <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income">economic income</a>&#8211;AGI does not reflect items that are excluded from the calculation of income for tax purposes and is reduced by certain &#8220;above the line&#8221; deductions that are especially beneficial to the wealthy. &#8220;Using an expanded concept of income that includes some nontaxable items and looking only at U.S. income taxes, there were 35,061 households, or 0.88 percent, that paid nothing.&#8221; Id.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_Minimum_Tax">Alternative Minimum Tax</a> was initially enacted to deal with the general unfairness of having extraordinarily well-to-do people be able to avoid tax entirely. As it was modified over time, it came to function as a way to ensure that those who accumulate lots of different deductions nonetheless pay tax, by treating some of those deductions as unqualified preferences for AMT purposes. But the AMT has lost a lot of its punch as Congress has eviscerated its provisions, such as the limitation on foreign tax credits. This is one of the reasons that many progressives have supported two things&#8211;elimination of the preferential rate for capital gains (a type of income especially enjoyed by the ultra rich) and adoption of a new type of minimum tax on some high level of gross income (the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffett_Rule">Buffett Rule</a>). This new information about the number of rich people who end up paying nothing in federal income taxes should result in more people telling Congress that it&#8217;s time to pass these two proposals.</p>

<p>Another US District Court finds no rational basis for DOMA treatment of same sex couples</p>
<p>In a case that will add weight to the likelihood that the Supreme Court will finally take a case to decide the constitutionality of the so-called &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_of_Marriage_Act">defense of marriage act&#8221; (DOMA), </a>the U.S. district court for Northern California District concluded on May 24th that sections of DOMA and the internal revenue code that incorporate it (here section7702B(f), which excludes participants in same sex relationships from long-term care insurance coverage) violate the equal protection rights of same-sex couples and registered domestic partners and are therefore constitutionally invalid to the extent they exclude such state employees from enrollment in California&#8217;s insurance program. Dragovich v. United States, No. 4P10-cv-01565-CW (N.C. Cal 2012).</p>
<p>Because the Obama administration announced in 2011 that it had concluded that DOMA was unconstitutional and therefore it would no longer defend DOMA in court, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartisan_Legal_Advisory_Group">Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group of the United States House of Representatives (BLAG)</a> argued in defense of the statute. </p>
<p>The judge concluded that BLAG failed to establish a rational relation of Section 3 of DOMA to a legitimate government interest and granted summary judgement regarding the plaintiffs&#8217; claim for access to <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=38.575,-121.505&#038;spn=1.0,1.0&#038;q=38.575,-121.505%20(CalPERS)&#038;t=h">CalPERS</a> long-term care insurance program.</p>
<p>Other cases are also wending their way up the appeals ladder.  (below the fold)</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>In California, a Ninth Circuit staff attorney employee proceeding for same-sex couple benefit coverage was decided in her favor by Chief Judge Kozcinski but the federal <a href="http://opm.gov/">Office of Personnel Management</a> ordered the insurer not to cover her. She took her case to court, winning in the US district court for Northern California in a decision by Judge Jeffrey White. The defendants appealed to the Ninth Circuit . See, e.g., <a href="http://lambdalegal.org/in-court/legal-docs/golinski_us_20120222_order">Golinski v. Office of Personnel Management </a>(N.D. Cal.)(order available on Lambda Legal); <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/22/karen-golinski-health-care-gay-rights_n_1295220.html">Karen Golinski Wins Health Care Benefits as Court Declares Defense of Marriage Act Unconstitutional</a>, HuffingtonPost (Feb. 2012); <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2012/05/22/12-15388_Amicus_brief.pdf">the amicus brief by Eagle Forum</a> opposing an initial en banc hearing (Ninth Circuit, Apr. 30, 2012). </p>
<p>In Boston, the First Circuit in April heard an appeal from two cases in which DOMA was also ruled unconstitutional by district court Judge Tauro. See <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/05/us/court-hears-arguments-on-defense-of-marriage-act.html">Appeals Court Hears Arguments on Gay Marriage Law</a>, New York Times (April 4, 2012). In one case, the judge concluded that DOMA compels states to discriminate&#8211;by denying funding if they don&#8217;t&#8211; against same sex couples who are permitted to marry under state law but whose marriage is not recognized for federal law purposes because of DOMA. The other case focussed on the issue of federal discrimination in the provision of federal benefits like Social Security, in contravention of the equal protection clause. </p>
<p>The fate of DOMA is likely ultimately to rest on the Supreme Court Justices and possibly on whether the Court applies &#8220;rational basis&#8221; or &#8220;heightened scrutiny&#8221; as the standard for consideration. Gender discrimination has ordinarily been thought to require more than a mere &#8220;rational basis&#8221; justification. Even the lower rational basis standard, however, should not be satisfied by DOMA: it is an arbitrary law put in place with the sole purpose of ensuring that the benefits of federal laws could not apply to one particular group of Americans&#8211;those who have formed same-sex couples. A purpose of discriminating among individuals based solely on their sexual orientation does not appear to be any kind of rational basis for a law.</p>
<p>I have always thought DOMA represented a regressive moment of legislative history and that it should be seen as violating the equal protection guarantee. Marriage is something clearly defined by law and not something inherently defined by some external authority. Hence, for a state to discriminate against its own citizens in denying them the benefits that accompany the legally sanctioned union is problematic. The arguments of the religious right to the contrary are unfounded&#8211;the state can sanction marriage between any two individuals and the churches can dictate whatever additional limitations they choose as necessary to the church&#8217;s religious doctrine. The rights of same sex couples to marry does nothing to hurt the rights of opposite sex couples or their marriages. People can avoid a church if they don&#8217;t agree with its doctrine, but they can&#8217;t so easily (in many cases not at all) avoid their state or nation. I hope that the Supreme Court, when it eventually takes one or another of these cases, reaches the correct decision to eliminate this example of blatant invidious discrimination . </p>

<p>Calculating the Cost of Bailouts</p>
<p>A recent New York Times includes a piece on the Treasury&#8217;s study of the various bailouts or &#8220;rescues&#8221; of distressed financial and other institutions. Gretchen Morgenson, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/20/business/a-bailout-analysis-thats-incomplete-fair-game.html">Seeing Bailouts Through Rose-Colored Glasses</a>, New York Times (May 19, 2012).</p>
<p>The Treasury study, <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/USTreasuryDept/20120413-financial-crisisresponse">The Financial Crisis Response&#8211;in charts </a>(April 13, 2012), is positive about the way that government handled the bailouts. </p>
<blockquote><p>Collectively, these programs &#8211;carried out by both a Republican and a Democratic administration&#8211;were effective in preventing the collapse of the financial system, in restarting economic growth, and in restoring access to credit and capital. They were well-designed and carefully managed. Because of this, we were able to limit the broader economic and financial damage. Although this crisis was caused by a shock larger than that which caused the Great Depression, we were able to put out the financial fires at much lower cost and with much less overall economic damage than occurred during a broad mix of financial crises over the last few decades.</p></blockquote>
<p>Reading that, one might conclude that everybody now is sitting fairly pretty, and that it was all done in a very upfront, fair and damage-free way. That ignores the fact that the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bailout">bank bailouts</a> treated the banksters with kid gloves&#8211;letting managers continue to receive their customary overcompensation and allowing banks generally to continue their predatory practices even while the taxpayers were providing them extraordinarily low-cost financing with practically no strings attached. Meanwhile, ordinary Americans&#8211;especially those in the lower half of the income distribution&#8211;suffered enormously. Congress&#8211;at the behest of the banksters&#8211;refused to enact mortgage clawback provisions in bankruptcy, the one law that would have done wonders at saving families and neighborhoods from unprecedented deterioration and blight. </p>
<p>To be fair, the report does include a bevy of charts that attempt to show how the crisis played out for the banks, the economy in general, and ordinary Americans (unemployment, depressed home sales market, etc.). But then the Treasury goes on to claim the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>[T]he latest available estimates indicate the financial stability programs are likely to result in an overall positive financial return for taxpayers in terms of direct fiscal cost. These estimates are based on gains already realized and on a range of different measures of cost and return for the remaining investments outstanding. These estimates do not include the full impact of the crisis on our fiscal position. And they do not include the cost of the tax cuts and the emergency spending programs passed by Congress. </p></blockquote>
<p>Now, it is good to know that at least the &#8220;direct fiscal cost&#8221; of the bailouts is likely to be positive. But note the gaping hole between that amount and the overall true cost of the bailouts&#8211;the &#8220;impact of the crisis on our fiscal position&#8221; and &#8220;the cost of the tax cuts&#8221; and &#8220;the emergency spending programs.&#8221; Now, at least the emergency spending programs generated economic activity and made real differences for individual people a good number of whom one can assume weren&#8217;t in the top 1%. </p>
<p>The tax cuts are a big cost item and one that may well not have had the benefits assumed, except for those that went to the lower and lower-middle income working classes (such as the payroll tax relief). And the impact on our fiscal position is ongoing and still strongly felt, as we struggle to rebalance an economy that already consumed too much from outside and produced too little here at home. So how much comfort can we take from the idea that the direct fiscal cost may be significantly less than some had initially expected it to be?</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />Here&#8217;s where the Times story comes in. Morgenson notes that &#8220;As the battles over financial regulation rage in Washington, it’s crucial that American taxpayers understand the costs associated with rescuing behemoth institutions.&#8221; We cannot take wise action for or against reduction in size of banks or other issues unless we are dealing with full information about the crisis and its aftermath. That won&#8217;t be easy in the politicized environment in which the Obama administration understandably wants to showcase how its efforts have helped the economy and the GOP seens intent on a &#8220;my way or the highway&#8221; approach to governance that cares more about winning a race than about doing what&#8217;s good for the people.</p>
<p>Morgenson reports on an interview with Edward Kane, Boston College finance professor and economist, who thinks that the public needs to see a more thorough <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost%E2%80%93benefit_analysis">cost-benefit analysis</a> of the TARP and other expenditures. Kane calls the analysis &#8220;deficient&#8221; (one might even say misleading) for counting as gains the interest income the Fed made from holding Treasuries (this is like money passed from mom to dad to put in the allowance jar for the kids&#8211;in other words, Treasury interest is paid by the US fisc to the Fed, and the Fed&#8217;s profits are paid into the US fisc, so it&#8217;s all the same pot). But the bigger deal is a genuine evaluation of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost">opportunity cost</a> of the subsidy provided to bailout recipients.</p>
<blockquote><p>The programs provided enormous amounts of money at below-market terms for extended periods, he said. Had those guarantees been priced at their true market value — what a private investor would have charged to lend during those dire days — taxpayers should have received far higher returns. Morgenson, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/20/business/a-bailout-analysis-thats-incomplete-fair-game.html">Seeing Bailouts Through Rose-Colored Glasses</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Charles Calomaris, a Colombia Business School prof and NBER research associate who worked with Kane on the study, noted the cost-benefit concern.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We are not saying that the benefits weren’t there,” Mr. Calomiris said. “We’re not saying that it wasn’t worthwhile to create these programs. Maybe it was, maybe it wasn’t. But it requires a fuller analysis of what the benefits were.” Morgenson, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/20/business/a-bailout-analysis-thats-incomplete-fair-game.html">Seeing Bailouts Through Rose-Colored Glasses</a></p></blockquote>

                                <p>by Linda Beale<br />EITC: Mulligan (economic theory) vs. Seto (empirical evidence)</p>
<p><a href="http://taxprof.typepad.com/taxprof_blog/2012/05/mulligan-the-eitc.html">TaxProf </a>today noted the article in the New York Times about the EITC: Casey Mulligan, <a href="http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/23/do-tax-credits-encourage-work/">Do Tax Credits Encourage Work?</a> New York Times ( 2012). Mulligan, an econ prof at the University of Chicago (home, of course, to Milt Friedman&#8217;s &#8220;free&#8221; market theories) noted that the EITC &#8220;could&#8221; discourage work.<br />
<blockquote>The earned-income tax credit is often said to encourage work, but it <strong>may do just the opposite</strong>. &#8230;<br />The chart below shows the credit’s schedules for the 2011 tax year as a function of annual earned income for a given family situation (other family situations have the same basic shape). The schedule shown illustrates [a] mountain-plateau pattern &#8230; an increasing portion for the lowest incomes, a flat portion, a decreasing portion and then finally a flat portion of zero. </p>
<p><img alt="" height="305" src="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2012/05/23/business/23economist-mulligan2/23economist-mulligan2-blog480.jpg" width="525"></p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>&#8230; For the same reasons that the credit encourages more work among people who might otherwise earn close to zero during a year, it <strong>can</strong> also influence some people to work less — those with earnings at or slightly above the downward-sloping or “phase-out” portion of the schedule, where people lose about 20 cents of their credit for every additional dollar earned during a year. In other words, for households on the downward-sloping portion of the earned-income tax credit schedule, the credit acts as an extra 20% tax on the income they earn in that range. The work-encouraging potential of the credit occurs only on the upward-sloping portion. &#8230; [emphasis added]</p></blockquote>
<p>Now, Mulligan surely knows that this theory about whether the credit encourages or discourages work is just that&#8211;a theory. Much of the assumptions about when people will stop working and substitute leisure don&#8217;t seem to hold up in practice, partly because there are so many other factors at work besides the rather simplistic assumptions in freshwater economics (such as the joy of working, status of work, self-esteem of work, etc.). Nonetheless, Mulligan can&#8217;t help adding another line that makes the overall comment suggest that he thinks the EITC will on the whole discourage work.<br />[I]t is more common for families to be on the part of the earned-income tax credit where it acts as a tax, rather than a reward to additional work. <br /><a href="http://www.blogger.com/"></a><br />Of course, when economists talk, policy makers often listen. This is a good example of when they should say&#8211;huh? and get a second opinion. What we should care about as a tax policy matter&#8211;which, I remind you, is distinct from what we might care about purely as a question of economic &#8220;efficiency&#8221;&#8211;is whether the EITC will generally work to encourage those who otherwise have tended to be left out of the work force but should be in it and whether the potential negative effect at the drop-off would be likely to be genuinely detrimental to that group or rather impact groups for whom the difference may not matter so much.<br />Ted Seto, a fellow tax prof in sunny California, commented on the Tax Prof item to point out the important <strong>empirical</strong> evidence that the EITC is mostly working as we want it to. <br />For a useful summary of recent empirical work, see Nada Eissa &#038; Hilary W. Hoynes, <a href="http://www.nber.org/chapters/c0063.pdf">Behavioral Responses to Taxes: Lessons from the EITC and Labor Supply</a>, published in 2006 by NBER&#8230;<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;The overwhelming finding of the empirical literature is that EITC has been especially successful at encouraging the employment of single parents, especially mothers. There is little evidence, however, that the EITC has reduced the hours worked by those already in the labor force. The empirical literature on married women is somewhat smaller but again consistent in its findings. The studies show that the EITC leads to modest reductions in the employment and hours worked of married women.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The latter problem &#8212; the one area identified in which the EITC does seem to have a negative effect on paid work &#8212; is not an EITC problem at all. It&#8217;s the same secondary worker problem Ed McCaffery has written about, (Taxation and the Family: A Fresh Look at Behavioral Gender Bias in the Code, 41 UCLA LAW REVIEW 983 (1993)), and it affects secondary workers up and down the income range.<br /><a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2012/05/eitc-mulligan-economic-theory-vs-seto-empirical-evidence.html" title="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2012/05/eitc-mulligan-economic-theory-vs-seto-empirical-evidence.html">http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2012/05/eitc-mulligan-economic-theory-vs-seto-empirical-evidence.html</a></p>

<p>Nurses Support Financial Transactions Tax</p>
<p> Perhaps the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPMorgan_Chase">JPMorgan</a> Chase debacle has caught enough attention to alter the debate. JPMorgan of course claimed to be entering a type of hedge that would be permitted under the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodd%E2%80%93Frank_Wall_Street_Reform_and_Consumer_Protection_Act">Dodd Frank</a> reforms. ( Apparently there were hedges on overall portfolio positions, and then those hedges were themselves hedged writing credit default swaps.) The authors of the legislation beg to differ, noting that the statute was drafted to permit hedges of specific asset but not portfolio-wide heding practices that become almost indiscernible from speculative &#8220;bets&#8221; on the direction of markets. Perhaps there will be one good result of the $2 billion plus and growing loss that JPMorgan encountered on its complex trades&#8211;regulators may finally quit paying so much attention to the banks&#8217; &#8220;trust our judgement&#8221; lobbies and start making it less possible for banks that get federal support to bet with other people&#8217;s money in big ways that can cause systemic risk. This seems to be a no-brainer&#8211;we need to more tightly regulate the activities of commercial banks and prevent them from gambling with huge bets that can swing the marketplace and place the entire system in jeopardy. That means banks will need to accept more staid profit scenarios&#8211;and the compensation for managers and traders should be downsized as well. They made fortunes out of wrecking the economy. They should be content with reasonable compensation when they do good jobs, and salary cuts&#8211;or being fired&#8211;when they don&#8217;t.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Another action that might help to calm the too-reckless bankers and their desire for super-high profit margins would be to enact a financial transactions tax. It seems that lots of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_%28United_States%29">GOP</a> candidates and economists think sales taxes make sense for ordinary folk&#8211;from Herman Cain&#8217;s 9-9-9 plan (that would eventually convert to a flat national sales tax) to the GOP push to cut income tax rates in states in favor of sales taxes. But when it comes to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_transaction">financial transactions</a> tax, all of a sudden the same folks seem to change their minds, suggesting that such a tax on financial transactions would discourage investment in the capital markets and be bad for America. </p>
<p>There are some singificant factors in favor of a financial transaction tax that would reap a few pennies from each transaction. First, it would raise much needed money from a group that generally can afford the cost. Second, it could act to discourage flash trading, where computer-run programs arbitrage the markets in a way that only those with the sophisticated programs can take advantage, leaving ordinary folk out in the cold. Third, it could be one factor in returning everyone to more prudent approaches to investment&#8211;investing for the long term, rather than profiting from arbitraging tiny differences in multiple trades.<br />The National Nurses United organization has taken out a full page ad in the New York Times in favor of a financial transactions tax. Here&#8217;s part of the text:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I pay a sales tax every time I make a purchase. We all do&#8211;but not the financial services industry, the bankers who sunk [sic] our economy. A financial transaction tax would cost banks and investment firms just pennies on the dollar for transactions such as stock trades, like a sales tax. Those pennies would add up to create jobs and fund vital programs and services in this country&#8211;education, healthcare and rebuilting our deteriorating infrastructure. The big banks will never miss this money, while the revenue generated will provide a better life for millions of Americans. &#8220;</p></blockquote>
<p>Maybe the nurses are on to something. But don&#8217;t look for Congress to act on this anytime soon.</p>

<p>Ten tax tricks (non-rich need not apply)</p>
<p> Back on tax day in April, Bloomberg.com ran a good story on the tax tricks the rich can use to reduce, defer or avoid altogether federal income taxation. Jesse Drucker, How <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-04-17/how-to-pay-no-taxes-10-strategies-used-by-the-rich">to Pay No Taxes: Ten Strategies Used by the Rich</a>, Bloomberg.com (Apr. 17, 2012).</p>
<p>As Drucker notes, the very very wealthy at the top of the income distribution have made out extraordinarily well in the last decade as to amount of taxes paid.<br />
<blockquote>For the 400 U.S. taxpayers with the highest adjusted gross income, the effective federal income tax rate—what they actually pay—fell from almost 30 percent in 1995 to just over 18 percent in 2008, according to the Internal Revenue Service. And for the approximately 1.4 million people who make up the top 1 percent of taxpayers, the effective federal income tax rate dropped from 29 percent to 23 percent in 2008. It may seem too fantastic to be true, but the top 400 end up paying a lower rate than the next 1,399,600 or so.</p></blockquote>
<p>They don&#8217;t even necessarily have to cheat to do it. They just use the tried and true tax reduction methods built into the system for their benefit&#8211;like &#8220;monetizing&#8221; their wealth through borrowings that they don&#8217;t pay back in their lifetimes, but are paid out of the estate (which can sell stocks with the step up in basis resulting in no taxes).</p>
<blockquote><p>That’s because those figures fail to include the additional income that’s generated by many sophisticated tax-avoidance strategies. Several of those techniques involve some variation of complicated borrowings that never get repaid, netting the beneficiaries hundreds of millions in tax-free cash. </p></blockquote>
<p>The article lists ten common ways the rich avoid taxes. <br />(After the jump)</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />1. The no-sale sale (borrowing against stock, combined with puts and calls, so that the rich guy can either pay back the cash or hand over shares, years after the sale is actually conducted. (Drucker notes that Philip Anshultz used one of these deals and ended up with the tax court saying he owed $94 million in back taxes. But the deals are still going strong.)</p>
<p>2. the skyscraper shuffle (using tiered partnerships to borrow against partnership property, move the loan into a subsidiary and then distribute the subsidiary to liquidate a partner, letting him cash out of a real estate partnership and avoid taxation, retaining ownership of the entity with the cash and deferring taxes indefinitely)</p>
<p>3. the estate tax eliminator (leaving stock earnings to kids and avoiding the estate tax with a GRAT)</p>
<p>4. the estate freeze (using an intentionally defective grantor trust and debt to freeze the value of an estate&#8211;and avoid estate taxes on future appreciation&#8211;by moving assets out of the estate tax free for the benefit of beneficiaries and benefiting from valuation discounts due to the use of the trust)</p>
<p>5. The option option (receiving options rather than shares as compensation so that the tax bill won&#8217;t be due til the options are exercised)</p>
<p>6. the bountiful loss (purchasing identical underwater shares and using puts and calls to protect against any risk of further loss, and then selling the old shares to realize the loss&#8211;with just enough of a time window to avoid the wash sale rule&#8211;while retaining the same property in the form of the new shares)</p>
<p>7. the friendly partner (selling real estate by forming a partnership with the buyer, taking out a loan collateralized by the property, and ultimately distributing the cash to the seller who retains an interest in the partnership)</p>
<p>8. the big payback (buying various life insurance products that completely escape t income tax and, if owned by the appropriate type of trust, also the estate tax)</p>
<p>9. IRS Monte Carlo (converting traditional IRAs to Roth IRAs, especially in sets so that you can take advantage of the 21-month &#8220;change your mind&#8221; period selectively as it benefits you)</p>
<p>10. the venti (having a chunk of your big CEO compensation paid through a deferred compensation plan where earnings grow tax-deferred for years or decades).<br />What&#8217;s the moral of this tale? That Congress could easily stop every one of these tax avoidance schemes if it wanted to. And it should want to, so that the ultra-rich don&#8217;t continue to have access to schemes that allow them to avoid taxation that are simply not available to ordinary people.<br /><a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2012/05/ten-tax-tricks-non-rich-need-not-try.html" title="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2012/05/ten-tax-tricks-non-rich-need-not-try.html">http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2012/05/ten-tax-tricks-non-rich-need-not-try.html</a></p>

<p><a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2012/05/us-inequality-is-getting-worse.html">US inequality is getting worse</a></p>
<p>The Congressional REsearch Service released a report in March showing that US inequality is getting worse. Linda Levine, <a href="http://assets.opencrs.com/rpts/R42400_20120307.pdf">US income distribution and mobility: trends and international comparisons</a>, Congressional Research Service (Mar. 7, 2012).</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an excerpt from the summary provided in the report itself.</p>
<blockquote><p>Approaching three years into the recovery from the 2007-2009 recession, the unemployment rate remains over 8%. The persistent difficulty of many of the workers who lost jobs to find reemployment has meant reduced incomes for them and their families. A historically slow rebound in the labor market appears to be partly responsible for some groups’ focus on the distribution of the benefits of economic growth and for some policymakers’ interest in redistributing income through the tax code, for example. Varying perceptions about a trade-off between economic growth and income equality appear to underlie longstanding congressional deliberations about such policy issues as the progressivity of income tax rates, the tax treatment of capital gains, and the adjustment of the federal minimum wage. If income were equally divided across households, each quintile (fifth) would account for 20% of total income. The Congressional Budget Office and others have documented that the bottom fifth has long accounted for much less than 20% of total income. The bottom quintile’s share of income has remained little changed for the past few decades at less than 4%, according to U.S. Census Bureau data. In contrast, the income shares of the top fifth and the top 5% of households appear to have trended upward. The top fifth’s share of total household income rose from 42.6% in 1968 to 50.2% in 2010; the top 5%’s share, from 16.3% to 21.3%. (Estimates derived from      <br />federal income tax data suggest that those at the very top of the income distribution have experienced greater gains.) The middle class, defined as the middle 60%, received a       <br />disproportionately smaller share of the total economic pie in 2010 (46.5%) than in 1968 (53.2%).</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />***<br />Based on the limited data that are comparable across nations, the U.S. income distribution appears to be among the most uneven of all major industrialized countries and the United States appears to be among the nations experiencing the greatest increases in measures of inequality. Three leading explanations are put forth for these cross-country differences: (1) other advanced economies devote a larger share of national output to transfers, which tends to equalize income across households; (2) the progressivity of tax rates varies by country and thus has different effects on the distribution of after-tax income; and (3) equality in the distribution of earnings,      <br />which account for most household income, varies substantially across countries.</p></blockquote>
<p>So Inequality is increasing and mobility in the US economy is diminishing, as the rich get richer and the middle class gets poorer and the poor stay poor. Because so many Americans have believed the hype about &#8220;free markets&#8221; pushed by the right and the Chicago School economic perspective, they don&#8217;t understand the failures of the &#8220;free market&#8221; theory &#8211;for example, that it cannot accurately predict much of anything about the economy,and that its policy dictates are likely to be total failures since they are based on assumptions that simply don&#8217;t hold for actual societies (like infinite lifetimes, 100% consumption of incomes, a unitary preference and other nonsense). </p>
<p>They echo the radical right&#8217;s rhetoric antagonistic to redistribution in favor of those who are disadvantaged by the growing inequality, and blithely miss the way tax policy and spending policy redistributes upwards in ways that contributes to the increase in inequality. Americans are also lulled into complacency about the harm of increasing inequality by the American myth that everybody that has the will to take the risks can be a self-made millionaire. Thus, they miss any opportunities to force Congress to bring the oligarchy under control through wiser tax policy and legislative initiatives focused on addressing genuine public needs through democratic egalitarianism.</p>

<p>The worm in Apple (and the US tax code)&#8211;offshoring of US Profits</p>
<p>Citizens for Tax Justice has focused on Apple&#8217;s ability to lower its US effective tax rate by offshoring its profits to tax havens.  See, e.g.,  Robert McIntyre, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/04/opinion/what-apple-pays-in-taxes-and-doesnt.html">What Apple Pays in Taxes and Doesn&#8217;t</a>, NY Times Letters to the Editor, CTJ, <a href="http://ctj.org/ctjreports/2012/05/how_to_end_apples_offshore_tax_shenanigans.php">How to end Apple&#8217;s offshore shenanigans</a>, May 4, 2012;   [hat tip Paul Caron at Tax Prof].  Here&#8217;s the key idea in both the letter and the report.<br />
<blockquote>Since Apple’s profits stem mainly from its U.S.-created technology, most, if not all, of these untaxed profits are almost certainly United States profits that Apple has artificially shifted offshore.<br />If we treat all of the untaxed portion of Apple’s offshore profits as really U.S. profits that were artificially shifted to offshore tax havens, then Apple’s U.S. tax rate is much lower than Apple reports. Under this approach, Apple’s 2008-10 effective federal tax rate comes to only 13.4%, and its effective federal tax rate over the last six years (2006-11) was only 12.1%. (Likewise, Apple’s revised effective state tax rate in 2008-10 was only 3.6%, instead of the 8.0% we reported in our state corporate tax study issued last December.)  CTJ report.</p></blockquote>
<p>How does CTJ know that Apple parks its profits offshore in tax havens where they are subject to minimal taxes?<br />
<blockquote>Apple says that if it told its foreign subsidiaries to pay Apple the whole $54 billion offshore amount as a dividend, then Apple would owe $17 billion in U.S. federal income taxes. That reflects a $19 billion tax at 35 percent, less a $2 billion foreign tax credit (the sum of all the foreign income taxes that Apple has ever paid). Which means, with a little more arithmetic, that about 90 percent of the $54 billion in accumulated offshore profits has never been taxed by any government.  Id.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is a genuine problem for the US in the age of digitized information.  Companies easily &#8220;sell&#8221; their most important intellectual property to offshore affiliates, for prices that are set by modeling and that fail to capture the obvious&#8211;that no price would actually be sufficient to purchase the company&#8217;s valuable intellectual property away from it, since the IP is in fact the basis for the company&#8217;s business.  So companies offshore their profits to post-office boxes in tax haven countries and claim that the US Is no longer the source of their profits, even though the IP was invented in the US, is still used in the US and still results in most of the sales actually in the US.</p>
<p>There are at least two possible solutions.  One would be to deny companies the ability to treat the IP they use to create their products as sold for tax purposes, and to permit only licensing for royalties to actual factories in countries that are not tax havens. Another would be to end the deferral on &#8220;active business&#8221; profits offshore.  It makes no sense because it incentivizes companies to offshore as much of their business as possible.</p>
