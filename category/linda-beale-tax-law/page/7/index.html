<p><strong>Summers says taxes must increase</strong><br />  <br />For once, I find myself agreeing with Larry Summers. At a conference in Washington sponsored by the Brookings Institute, he emphasized that tax cuts and spending cuts cannot appropriately resolve the US budgetary issues. <br />
<blockquote>“It is a near certainty that we are going to need a significant increase in revenues, and it seems to me that any discussion of tax policy needs to start there,” <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-05-03/rubin-says-tax-overhaul-presents-difficult-substance-politics.html">Summers Says U.S. Tax Overhaul Should Raise More Money</a>, Bloomberg.com (May 3, 2012).</p></blockquote>
<p>Without additional taxes, &#8220;close to inconceivable&#8221; cuts to earned benefits programs like Medicare and Social Security would be required, he noted. Id.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important that people start talking some sense about taxes since they are the lifeblood of a democracy and the primary way that a government can act to limit the concentration of wealth in the hands of the few that diminishes democracy by promoting oligarchy. </p>
<p>I suspect most of the insiders in the Republican Party know this and know that if common sense reigns, taxes will be raised on the upper crust and raised somewhat on most of the middle class, in order to ensure that the US can deal with its crumbling infrastructure, support its citizens, not just the wealthy ones, in developing their human capital, and provide a decent and sustainable standard of living for most of our people. That is why the Republican Party is engaged these days in brinksmanship legislative (and judicial) action. As the extreme right has gained representation through strong turnout of the more ideological base, </p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />Republican congressmen and women have played a one-note tune, using the filibuster in the Senate to stymie majority rule and repeatedly relying on counterfactual assumptions about the economy and meaningless soundbite promotions&#8211;such as the idea that tax cuts result in greater revenues (not so) or the notion that Social Security is bankrupt (not so) or the idea that lower income Americans should pay more in taxes rather than increasing the taxes paid by the extraordinarily wealthy upper-crust that has seen its taxes lowered during the three-plus decades of reaganomics&#8211;to convince Americans that a return to the laissez-faire, corporate titan economy that reigned at the turn of the nineteenth century would lead to prosperity. </p>
<p>One of the major problems facing this country today, and its economy, is the huge gap between the income of a few ultra rich and the rest of us, and the near-poverty level of income for many Americans. Countries with such inequalities generally have poor quality of life indicators on a lot of fronts, and the US is no exception. Teenage birth rates, illiteracy, health care, low-birth weight babies, unemployment&#8211;a litany of societal ills accompanies high inequality within a society, and the US suffers from almost all of them.</p>
<p>Why then is it that our policymakers do not recognize the central role of the tax system in either fostering inequality&#8211;as it has been for thirty years under reaganomics, as we reduced the role of the estate tax, provided an extraordinarily preferential rate for capital gains (the type of income mostly enjoyed by the very wealthy), and otherwise provided deductions and preferences that had the effect of redistributing upwards from the vast middle to the few at the top. Yet right wing economists like Martin Feldstein refuse to recognize the devastating impact of huge inequality on the economy.<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;Our problem in the income distribution area is poverty, and you should be concerned about combating poverty, not inequality.” Id (quoting Martin Feldstein).</p></blockquote>
<p>Perhaps Feldstein has bought the Kool-Aid of the American myth, that we are a society with great mobility, no class structure, where everyone can &#8220;rise by his own bootstraps&#8221; and become a millionaire. That mobile and classless society may have almost existed in the golden years after World War II, when veterans came back, went to college on the GI Bill, and raised families in small towns across the US that were dominated by locally owned stores and regional food supplies. But the US society has lost a considerable amount of that mobility. Yes, there are some at the bottom who win the lottery (literally or figuratively) and move up, and there are some at the top who don&#8217;t stay at the top. But generally in this country, the father&#8217;s wealth determines the wealth of the son, who inherits it at no tax cost and generally increases it because that wealth is mostly represented by capital assets whose income is preferentially taxed at very low rates.</p>
<p>Ultimately, this nation would be best served by merely allowing the ill-considered Bush tax cuts to expire as they are slated to do under current law. Then hopefully a more reflective group of legislators can get together and discuss how best to modify our tax system to deal with the issues that face us in this century&#8211;global companies that move their intellectual property offshore in order to avoid taxes and who no longer have any sense of loyalty to country; too big to fail institutions in banking, insurance, and global multinational corporations; and excessive subsidies for companies that are making billions in profits and paying almost no taxes, such as the oil and gas industry, the agribusiness industry, and multinationals like GE. </p>
<p>I think a big part of the answer requires rethinking in a direction quite different from the one that the right is pushing: to considerably narrow the tax-free provisions for mergers, acquisitions and spin-offs; to modify the transfer pricing formula to reject treatment of intellectual property developed in this country as &#8220;sold&#8221; to a controlled subsidiary; to recognize the need to protect domestic industry from globalization that leaves us too dependent on imports; and to re-invigorate anti-trust and consumer protection laws so that industries can no longer sell products and leave customers without recourse to information or repair because of unintelligible call services in the Philippines and &#8220;company policies&#8221; that refuse to reimburse a customer for damage done to a printer by a cartridge sold by the printer manufacturer.</p>

<p>Tax Foundation&#8211;up to its usual nonsense</p>
<p>The Tax Foundation claims to be a nonpartisan institute interested merely in researching and informing people about taxes. That&#8217;s far from the truth, however. Its work is aimed at one purpose&#8211;convincing Americans that they pay too much in taxes and that government is too big. <br />One of its most useful distortions is its self-proclaimed &#8220;tax freedom day.&#8221; It adds up all the state and local and federal income, excise, social security, property, and other taxes on individuals and businesses,including corporations, and then considers how many days of work, at a consistent amount per day, are required to raise that amount of taxes. See <a href="http://www.taxfoundation.org/files/sr198.pdf">Tax Freedom Day 2012</a>, Tax Foundation.</p>
<p>But of course the entire enterprise of tax freedom day is baloney. Nothing in that formula actually relates to what an individual earns or what an individual pays in taxes. But because the date is announced as the day that Americans quit working to pay government and start working for themselves, many media outlets and readers interpret the &#8220;tax freedom day&#8221; as meaning that they themselves must work that long to pay off their share of taxes. There is no such thing as an average American, and it isn&#8217;t clear at all that many of the excise, corporate and other businesses taxes are borne by ordinary Americans. Moreover, thinking about this on an individual level means averaging in the super-rich like Warren Buffet with ordinary Joes like &#8220;Joe the Plumber&#8221; and poor folk like those barely scraping by on teacher or janitor salaries results in sheer nonsense. There is no such thing as an &#8220;average&#8221; amount of taxes paid or a day in the year when each and every American can say&#8211;this is the last day I have to work to pay taxes. </p>
<p>The Tax Foundation often goes through some rigmarole to insist that it doesn&#8217;t ever imply that the &#8220;tax freedom day&#8221; is anything other than a cute figure of speech that captures a meaningless statistic. But look at what it says in its announcement of the 2012 date:</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />
<blockquote>Tax Freedom Day® 2012 arrives on April 17 this year, four days later than last year, due to higher federal income and corporate tax collections. That means Americans will work 107 days into the year, from January 1 to April 17, to earn enough money to pay this year’s combined 29.2% federal, state, and local tax bill.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now, a typical person reading those two sentences would conclude that this is a straightforward statement that that particular American will work 107 days to pay off his own personal taxes. Nothing could be further from the truth. Some would have to work only a few days to pay off their share of taxes, while others don&#8217;t work at all&#8211;those living on capital gains from inherited wealth&#8211;and still others may work considerably longer. The statistic is meaningless and by confusing ordinary Americans into thinking that it can be applied to their own particular situation it becomes detrimental to understanding of the US tax system or government costs.<br />Further down, the Tax Foundation makes this statement.<br />
<blockquote>Tax Freedom Day is a vivid, calendar-based illustration of the cost of government, giving Americans an easy way to gauge the overall tax take.</p></blockquote>
<p>And there one sees the anti-government bias of the Tax Foundation. By using a formula that pretends to show Americans how hard they must each work to fund government, and providing no counterbalance (such as showing how many people are benefitted by various government programs, or how much harder each American would have to work without the various subsidies for home ownership, financial institution soundness, health research, and old age health care and retirement benefits), the Tax Foundation succeeds in convincing many Americans that government is indeed a wasteful exercise that demands too much of their own sweat. </p>
<p>Just about as bad is the more recent <a href="http://www.taxfoundation.org/files/ff299.pdf">Fiscal Fact: Americans paying more in taxes than for food, clothing and shelter</a>, Tax Foundation (May 3, 2012). This look at government tax collections (using the same data used for the tax freedom day calculation, so including all taxes paid by individuals or businesses, whether income, property, excise or other and whether paid to local, state or federal government) and compares that to government figures for expenditures on essentials.</p>
<p>This is again misleading, as the Tax Foundation itself acknowledges, since it counts taxes that are used for social programs that pay for those same essentials. Redistribution programs that use the collective wealth to support those who cannot support themselves (vulnerable elderly and children, unemployed, mentally incapacitated, prisoners) serve a vital government function. Similarly, it again deals with national statistics that ordinary people are likely to interpret as applying to their own situations, even though the statistics cannot be applied in that way. Consider the wealthy billionaire with a private island and seven multimillion dollar homes in the US&#8211;taxes collected on those properties will be much more than what ordinary folk pay on their single residence. Likewise, taxes collected from billionaire CEOs will be much more than those collected from ordinary workers, even though the CEOs may also have considerable investment income that is taxed at ridiculously low preferential rates. So no conclusions can be drawn from aggregate numbers of housing, food and clothing expenditures to individual taxpayers, just as no meaningful analysis can be drawn from aggregate federal, state, and local expenditures to benefits received (or costs borne) by individual taxpayers.</p>
<p>So why does the Tax Foundation produce such deceptively simple statistical studies that are cast in terms that are bound to mislead ordinary Americans about the role of taxes and government and even the amount of taxes they pay? It seems likely that the primary purpose is to mislead ordinary Americans about the role of taxes and the amount of taxes they pay. The Tax Foundation gets my maximum &#8220;boo&#8221; for its shameless exploitation of statistics to mislead Americans about both their own tax burdens and the role of government in our lives.</p>

<p>Leonard says GOP Is intent on sabotage<br />  <br />Andrew Leonard of Salon writes often about tax and economic issues. In Friday&#8217;s column, he addressed the increasingly obstructionist tactics employed by far-right representative Paul Ryan and a coterie of other GOP representatives who are willing to sacrifice core systems in order to keep the military machine humming (and putting money into pockets of GOP arms merchant constituents) while ensuring that anything that provides aide to the less well off is labeled as a disrespected &#8220;entitlement&#8221; that can be chopped and destroyed at will. See Andrew Leonard, <a href="http://www.salon.com/2012/05/04/sabotage_the_new_gop_plan/singleton/">Sabotage: the new GOP plan</a>, Salon.com (May 4, 2012).</p>
<p>Ryan introduced a bill on Wednesday that would achieve the Holy Grail of GOP political goals&#8211;continuing the ridiculous Reaganomics militarization by ending the sequester that would cut $600 billion from the military entitlement budget, and at the same time cutting drastically almost every single program that protects ordinary Americans. See <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/224767-ryan-introduces-legislation-to-replace-12-trillion-sequester">Ryan offers bill to end sequester in bid to eliminate defense cuts,</a> The Hill (May 4, 2012).</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />As a commenter on the Hill piece noted, the US military budget is overblown and needs to be cut. <br />The U.S. Spends More On Defense than Next Top 14 Countries Combined Wiki List of countries by military expenditures SIPRI Yearbook 2011 &#8211; world&#8217;s top military spenders in 2010 (in billions).   </p>

<p>Unbelievably, one of the things that Ryan would prefer to cut, rather than see some of the military&#8217;s perks diminish, is Title II of the Dodd Frank Act. I guess the radical right in the GOP has a short-term memory: it thinks there is no need for the government to have liquidation authority over the too-big-to-fail banks. Instead, it apparently would prefer more outright bailouts of the well-to-do bankers who speculate with our economy for their own private gains. Oh, and the GOP-led House financial services committee wants to defund the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau&#8211;to again allow the banks and insurance companies to undertake the rapacious exploitation of ordinary Americans through exorbitant and unconscionable fees. Other GOP &#8220;reforms&#8221; include medical liability, with the GOP protecting medical establishments from facing the piper when they make mistakes that they could have avoided through appropriate care.</p>
<p>Pretty clear just how much the Supreme Court&#8217;s terrible decision in Citizens United with its warped view of free speech in relation to elections is distorting our government&#8217;s ability to function for the good of ordinary citizens.</p>

<p>Reform that &#8220;high&#8221; statutory corporate tax rate? Not necessary</p>
<p>I got an interesting item pushed to me from an online-MBA website blog where today&#8217;s item was on &#8220;<a href="http://www.onlinemba.com/blog/10-big-businesses-that-barely-pay-taxes/">10 Big Businesses That Barely Pay Taxes</a>&#8220;. It looks at companies like GE, duPont, Verizon, ExxonMobil, FedEx, Boeing, Google and others that aggressively maximize the offshoring of profits and the onshoring of deductions (like the &#8220;domestic manufacturing&#8221; reduction in the tax rate, the research deduction, etc.) in order to tap out on taxes at zero or awfully close thereto. </p>
<p>The companies tend to dislike such coverage of their very low tax rates of only slightly more than 0% when they are quite loudly (and hypocritically) protesting how uncompetitive the 35% statutory rate makes them. The site notes that most of the companies have claimed that they pay a higher rate than the one noted here&#8211;usually by counting their financial statement deferred taxes as though they were already paid. Deferred taxes, however, are just an accounting way of noting the possibility of future taxes&#8211;they may never be paid (for example, if offshore profits are not repatriated, or if corporations are successful in lobbying for another very-low-tax repatriation holiday), and years of deferral can convert what appear to be substantial taxes into de minimis amounts, since that money is meanwhile invested and earning more money. </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Here are some excerpts (not in the same order as in the blogpost itself):</p>
<blockquote><p>1.<strong>Boeing</strong> may own and operate factories and research facilities all over the U.S., but the mega-corporation isn’t paying much back to the government for the privilege of doing business in this country. In fact, the company hasn’t paid anything at all for three years running. Over those three years, Boeing made $9 billion in profits but didn’t pay anything in federal income taxes, actually getting back more than $178 million in tax benefits. &#8230;<br />2. &#8230; A study found that in 2008 <strong>FedEx</strong> paid no federal taxes, which the company claims is an anomaly caused by depreciation deductions. &#8230;<br />3. &#8230;<strong> Verizon </strong>hasn’t paid a cent in taxes for the past three years. &#8230;[i]t actually makes money from the government in the form of tax subsidies and is the third largest collector of these benefits in the U.S., &#8230; . Like GE, Verizon has denied these tax evasion allegations, stating that they pay billions in taxes every year, but like GE, Verizon is counting deferred taxes in these calculations. &#8230;<br />4.<strong>GE </strong>has raked in more than $81 billion during the past decade, but little of that profit has been returned to the government in the form of taxes. While the corporate tax rate has held steady at 35%, GE has paid an average of just 2.3% of its income in taxes since 2002. And that’s just an average, some years the company didn’t pay taxes at all, getting off scot-free in 2002, 2008, 2009, and 2010 &#8230;</p></blockquote>

<p> Common Cause Claims ALEC Violated Tax Exempt Lobbying Restrictions</p>
<p> The Common Cause organization filed a complaint with the IRS under 26 USC 7623, the tax whistleblower act,  alleging that the American Legislative Exchange Council violated the lobbying restrictions applicable to tax exempt organizations through underreporting and operating in furtherance of private corporate interests.   The complaint argues that &#8220;ALEC&#8217;s primary purpose is to provide a vehicle for its corporate members to lobby state legislators and to deduct the costs of such efforts as charitable contributions. ALEC drafts “model” legislation provided by its corporate and legislative members, and lobbies for the adoption of that legislation. These goals are fundamentally inconsistent with ALEC&#8217;s claimed tax-exempt status as a charitable organization.&#8221;</p>
<p>The following paragraphs are from the introduction to the complaint.<br />
<blockquote>This matter concerns the massive underreporting of lobbying by the American Legislative Exchange Council (“ALEC”). While ostensibly a nonprofit organization under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, ALEC&#8217;s primary purpose is to provide a vehicle for its corporate members to lobby state legislators and to deduct the costs of such efforts as charitable contributions. ALEC drafts “model” legislation provided by its corporate and legislative members, and lobbies for the adoption of that legislation. These goals are fundamentally inconsistent with ALEC&#8217;s claimed tax-exempt status as a charitable organization under <a href="http://taxandaccounting.bna.com/btac/display/link_res.adp?fedfid=25904513&#038;fname=usc_26_501_c_3_&#038;vname=dtrnot">26 U.S.C. §501(c)(3)</a>, because (i) “no substantial part” of a charity&#8217;s activity can be “attempting to influence legislation,” and (ii) ALEC&#8217;s activities do not qualify under any of the enumerated purposes of Section 501(c)(3).</p></blockquote>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />
<blockquote>This scheme causes harm to taxpayers in two distinct ways. First, ALEC&#8217;s activities constitute an abuse of its 501(c)(3) tax exemption, which is reserved for organizations “operated exclusively ” for a limited number of purposes, such as “religious, charitable, scientific … or educational purposes ….” <a href="http://taxandaccounting.bna.com/btac/display/link_res.adp?fedfid=25904513&#038;fname=usc_26_501_c_3_&#038;vname=dtrnot">26 U.S.C. §501(c)(3)</a>. Second, ALEC&#8217;s corporate members improperly deduct from their taxable income the dues and other contributions made to ALEC; such expenditures are non-deductible lobbying expenses under Section 162(e). In fact, because ALEC solicits very few contributions from individuals, its false claims of tax-exempt status appear driven by the desire of ALEC corporate members to deduct lobbying expenses as charitable contributions.<br />ALEC&#8217;s primary, if not sole objective is to “influence legislation.” Its bylaws state that its purpose is to “formulate legislative action programs,” “disseminate model legislation and promote the introduction of companion bills in Congress and state legislatures,” and “[e]establish a clearinghouse for bills at the state level, and provide for a bill exchange program.” <a href="http://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=5048766" name="a0d1q0j3r2_ref"></a><a href="http://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=5048766" name="a0d1q0j3r2_reffirst_footref"></a><a href="http://taxandaccounting.bna.com/btac/T11100/doc_display.adp?fedfid=25904513&#038;vname=dtrnot&#038;jd=a0d1p9w8r8&#038;split=0#a0d1q0j3r2"><sup>1</sup></a> As recently as April 11, 2012, ALEC boasted that “for years, ALEC has partnered with legislators to research and develop better, more effective … legislation. <a href="http://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=5048766" name="a0d1q0j3r5_ref"></a><a href="http://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=5048766" name="a0d1q0j3r5_reffirst_footref"></a><a href="http://taxandaccounting.bna.com/btac/T11100/doc_display.adp?fedfid=25904513&#038;vname=dtrnot&#038;jd=a0d1p9w8r8&#038;split=0#a0d1q0j3r5"><sup>2</sup></a>Notwithstanding these claims, however, ALEC has reported ”for years“ to the IRS that it has not spent a single penny on lobbying or attempting to influence legislation. These tax returns are patently false.  (Complaint available <a href="http://taxandaccounting.bna.com/btac/T11100/split_display.adp?fedfid=25904513&#038;vname=dtrnot&#038;jd=a0d1p9w8r8&#038;split=0">here</a>, on BNA&#8217;s tax service)</p></blockquote>
<p>The complaint goes on to specify how ALEC develops legislation and works to get that model language enacted.  The following is an excerpt from this portion.</p>
<blockquote><p>ALEC boasts about how frequently its bills are introduced in state legislatures to show its influence over the legislative process, publishing “scorecards” to demonstrate the high numbers of ALEC bills enacted. [Exhibit 9] In its 1995 scorecard, then-ALEC Executive Director Samuel A. Brunelli explicitly stated that corporations join ALEC to drive a legislative agenda in a cost effective way: “’This was a landmark legislative year in ALEC&#8217;s history,’ said ALEC Executive Director Samuel A. Brunelli. ’With our success rate at more than 20 percent, I would say that ALEC is a good investment. Nowhere else can you get a return that high.’” [Exhibit 11] Similarly, in a brochure that ALEC distributed to recruit more corporations for its private sector membership, it claimed that “during each legislative cycle, ALEC legislators introduce more than 1,000 pieces of legislation based on these models, approximately 17 percent of which are enacted. ” [Exhibit 12] It is telling that ALEC expresses its success in corporate terms, as a good “return” on a corporation&#8217;s “investment” in tax-exempt lobbying.<br />Beyond quantifying its influence by measuring how often its lobbying efforts succeed, ALEC trumpets how its Task Forces and other programs provide corporations with direct access to state legislators. In a near textbook definition of lobbying, the recruitment brochure states “ALEC provides the private sector with an unparalleled opportunity to have its voice heard, and its perspective appreciated, by the legislative members.” !d. The brochure further explains that “[t]his partnership identifies issues and then responds with common-sense, result- oriented policies. The two groups work in unison to solve the challenges facing the nation, with results that will define the American political landscape in the 21st century.” Jd. In other words, ALEC provides a network to influence the legislative process and deliver “results” to its private 13 corporate membership &#8211; namely, legislation favorable to corporate members&#8217; interests. These statements by ALEC belie any claim that it is engaged in “education” rather than lobbying . The ALEC Task Forces provide a venue for corporations to lobby legislators while deducting the expenses as charitable donations.</p></blockquote>
<p>The complaint goes on to outline the way ALEC presses for legislation, including issue alerts and one-on-one contacts with key legislators, bill tracking documents, model press releases and talking points to assist legislators in getting its model legislation passed,  hearing testimony by staffers in support of the ALEC legislation, and even  luxury conferences three times annually to which legislators are encouraged to bring families for subsidized work/vacations.</p>
<blockquote><p>Legislator members on ALEC Task Forces are also eligible for “ALEC scholarships,” which reimburse a legislator&#8217;s accommodation, transportation and other expenses to attend the ALEC national conferences. Scholarships are also available for legislators to attend other events, including “ALEC Academies,” which are described as a “two-day intensive program on a specific issue;’ attended by invited members of both the public and private sector. Contributions to the ALEC scholarship fund are made by corporations who are solicited directly by legislators at the individual state level. See Exhibit 18 (a breakdown of payments to the ALEC in Ohio scholarship fund). According to the tax filings of PhRMA, the pharmaceutical lobbying group and ALEC private sector member, it provided $356,075 to the ALEC scholarship fund in 2010. <a href="http://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=5048766" name="a0d1q0j3v8_ref"></a><a href="http://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=5048766" name="a0d1q0j3v8_reffirst_footref"></a><a href="http://taxandaccounting.bna.com/btac/T11100/doc_display.adp?fedfid=25904513&#038;vname=dtrnot&#038;jd=a0d1p9w8r8&#038;split=0#a0d1q0j3v8"><sup>13</sup></a>Many of these expenses are likely deducted from corporate taxable income. The ALEC conferences are nothing more than a forum for tax-subsidized lobbying. ALEC provides logistical support in the form of travel, accommodations, entertainment, and family services, in order to facilitate lobbying by ALEC&#8217;s corporate members targeting ALEC&#8217;s legislative members.</p></blockquote>
<p>The complaint considers whether ALEC even qualifies as a 501(c)(3) organization.  Suggesting that the only possible qualifying purpose that might be claimed is educational, the complaint concludes that ALEC clearly fails to satisfy any concept of an educational non-profit.</p>
<blockquote><p>[E]ven if a tortured interpretation of the regulations led to the conclusion that ALEC is not engaged in lobbying, ALEC would fail to satisfy the most basic requirement for 501(c)(3) status &#8211; operations that are exclusively for charitable purposes . ALEC&#8217;s operations are neither charitable nor educational, much less exclusively so. They are pecuniary and political, and devoted to fostering the enactment of bills that will financially benefit and further the ideological goals of ALEC&#8217;s corporate membership.</p></blockquote>

<p>Buffett Rule rejected by Senate</p>
<p>The Senate rejected the effort to make tax policy commensurate with the slogans about American values that we parrot freely&#8211;opportunity, paying fair shares, etc. Given the now rigid &#8220;phantom&#8221; filibuster rule requiring a supermajority to pass anything in the Senate, the Republicans &#8211;especially if joined by a few of the right-leaning Democrats&#8211;can defeat just about any attempt at reasonable taxation.</p>
<p>So Senate 2230 got only a majority of the SEnate (51 votes) in support of the effort to move the Buffett Rule&#8211;calling for a phased in increase to 30% minimum tax on taxpayers with income in excess of a million a year. </p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />Minority Whip Jon Kyl (radical rightist Republican from Arizona) said Congress should instead be focussing on the economy. BNA Daily Tax RealTime (Apr. 16, 2012 at 7:35pm). Shows how completely out of tune with reality the Republican right is. Focusing on the divide between rich and poor is the best way to focus on the economy these days. We are so busy redistributing upwards through tax and fiscal policies that we are rapidly driving the middle class into extinction and depriving those who are disadvantaged by income and other demographics (like location in inner cities) of a fair opportunity to live a decent life. Watch Angela Grovers Blackwell on Bill Moyers PBS program (4/15/12) for more on what equity really means and how our policies are ignoring the real equity issues surrounding us.</p>

<p>More on Private Equity, Carried Interest, Wealth, and Romney</p>
<p>Those who&#8217;ve read much of this blog are aware of the various arguments against the notion that private equity firms are &#8220;do-gooders&#8221; that we should encourage and even subsidize (through the carried interest provision). On the whole, I believe they are part of a harmful trend towards consolidation of enterprises that weakens links to communities, makes caring for workers seem like too great a cost, and encourages over-leveraging and instability that ultimately is devastating to the economy. Add to that the egregiously inappropriate tax treatment of &#8220;carried interest&#8221; paid to managers, and you have a wealth-building machine for a small, elite group that does not pay its fair share of the tax burden and whose activities are likely a net social detriment.</p>
<p>Specifically, private equity firms historically have looked for good, stable businesses with decent cash flows, low leverage and decent but not high profits that they can take over, leverage highly (to pay for the acquisition and to provide quick funds to fuel their own ultra-high profit demands), with the cash flow from the ongoing business paying off the debt. The result in these leveraged buyout cases may be that a stable busienss with a profit of 5-6% that spent what was needed on maintenance and new investment, expanding gradually and paying its workers a decent wage and its owners a small but decent profit becomes an overleveraged company that is less stable and has to use more of its cash flow to pay off the debt. </p>
<p>One result of excessive debt is that expenditures for maintenance and investment in new equipment are deferred. and business stalls for the time it takes to pay off the debt. Sometimes that stall is merely a bad time for the business (and often its workers). Liquidity problems can result in proclaimed &#8220;efficiency&#8221; decisions to fire or lay off hundreds of workers and to reshape benefits like pensions and health care. That&#8217;s if the company stays in operation. Sometimes the debt service and resultant deferral of investments and change of focus of the business will be fatal. Costly leverage results in bankruptcy or in the business being broken up and sold in pieces, either way with many workers losing jobs (and benefits) and many communities suffering dire consequences. Whatever happens, the equity fund managers gets high fees and &#8220;carried interest&#8221; profits taxed at inappropriately low tax rates. Romney, for instance, continued to get a &#8220;carried interest&#8221; cut from Bain Capital&#8217;s activities in compensation for past work done, long after he retired from doing any work at the firm in 1999. See <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/romney-using-ethics-exception-to-limit-disclosure-of-bain-holdings/2012/04/05/gIQARcVmxS_story.html?wpisrc=nl_pmpolitics">Romney using ethics exception to limit disclosure of Bain holdings</a>, Washington Post (April 5, 2012).</p>
<p>And of course, private equity firms do not necessarily invest only in domestic companies. They may hold considerable assets offshore&#8211;possibly in some of those very companies that represent low-wage, low-benefits, and low-worker-rights havens for US multinationals that end US jobs here in order to hire more cheaply abroad&#8230;.. Romney, for instance, has holdings in &#8220;a high-tech sensor control firm that has moved U.S. manufacturing jobs to China.&#8221; Id. (noting that these holdings were revealed through SEC filings).</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>One wonders if those realities of equity funds is a reason that Romney has used an ethics exception to limit his disclosure of Bain holdings. See <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/romney-using-ethics-exception-to-limit-disclosure-of-bain-holdings/2012/04/05/gIQARcVmxS_story.html?wpisrc=nl_pmpolitics">Romney using ethics exception to limit disclosure of Bain holdings</a>, Washington Post (April 5, 2012). <br />
<blockquote>By offering a limited description of his assets, Romney has made it difficult to know precisely where his money is invested, whether it is offshore or in controversial companies, or whether those holdings could affect his policies or present any conflicts of interest.<br />In 48 accounts from <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/mitt-romney-bain-capital-and-the-gospel-of-creative-destruction/2012/01/09/gIQAfRKEsP_story.html">Bain Capital</a>, the private equity firm he founded in Boston, Romney declined on his financial disclosure forms to identify the underlying assets, including his holdings in a company that moved U.S. jobs to China and a California firm once owned by Bain that filed for bankruptcy years ago and laid off more than 1,000 workers.<br />***[M]ost of the underlying assets — the specific investments of Bain funds— are not known because Romney is covered by a confidentiality agreement with the company.<br />Several of Romney’s assets — including a large family trust valued at roughly $100 million, nine overseas holdings and 12 partnership interests— were not named initially on his disclosure forms, emerging months later when he agreed to release his tax returns.<br />***<br />Several outside experts across the political spectrum, however, say Romney’s disclosure is the most opaque they have encountered, with some suggesting the filing effectively defeats the spirit of disclosure requirements.<br />***<br />[Romney&#8217;s failure to disclose these assets, and the inapplicability of conflict-of-interest &#8220;must sell&#8221; requirements to a President, mean that we may never know and that Romney may continue to hold positions that would be inappropriate for a sitting president.] Although still subject to the disclosure requirements, a president cannot be compelled by OGE to sell undisclosed assets, according to an OGE official. Romney’s would be the first presidency to face this circumstance. Id.</p></blockquote>
<p>As the article notes, one reason Romney doesn&#8217;t disclose Bain&#8217;s underlying assets is that Bain (a fund he created) requires its participants to enter into confidentiality agreements. Handy for a politician with considerable wealth that the institution he created &#8220;requires&#8221; him to keep its investments secret. But not so handy for the people whom a president is supposed to serve. As Democratic Party lawyer Joe Sandler noted, “Romney’s approach frustrates the very purpose of the ethics and disclosure laws.” Id. The disclosure is intended to &#8220;allow the public to identify potential conflicts of interest and the personal economic priorities of candidates and elected officials.&#8221; Id. (quoting Fred Wertheimer, an advocate who worked on getting the law passed after Watergate). The right answer to a refusal to disclose is that the candidate should divest or else not run for office. Id. (noting that various Washington lawyers provide this advice to candidates who cannot disclose underlying assets).</p>
<p>As the campaign progresses with continuing claims by GOP advocates that Romney&#8217;s &#8220;entrepreneurial&#8221; activity at Bain demonstrates that he has the business sense we purportedly need in a president, more scrutiny will fall on his current holdings as well as Bain&#8217;s past and present activities and just how well such an organization does (or does not) support the country&#8217;s economy.</p>

<p>Senate Dems unveil their tax cut proposal</p>
<p> Senate Democrats, led by majority leader Harry Reid, unveiled a $26 billion tax-cut bill on March 26, 2012. See, e.g., Richard Rubin, Senate Democrats Said to Prepare $26 Billion Tax Cut Measure, San Francisco Chronicle (Mar. 26, 2012).</p>
<p>The proposal revives the lapsed 100% expensing provision for capital investments, extending it through the end of 2012 and would provide a tax credit for businesses that expand their payrolls this year.</p>
<p>The expensing provision is foolish, but it looks like Senate Democrats are more interested in playing the bipartisanship game than they are in good legislation. Why is it foolish? For several reasons.</p>
<p>1) there is already a (temporary) bonus depreciation deduction of 50%.</p>
<p>2) an expensing provision that applies retroactively to already-purchased capital equipment cannot, by definition, have incentivised the purchase of that equipment.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />3) providing this kind of additional break to large corporations is a corporate subsidy that has little to do with creating jobs and nothing to do with good tax policy. It has little to do with creating jobs because corporations will simply accelerate purchases to garner the benefit but may not increase production correspondingly. It has nothing to do with good tax policy because accelerated depreciation already allows deductions faster than economic lossm amounting to yet another pure tax subsidy for businesses.</p>
<p>4) Companies that need to purchase equipment in order to compete will make the appropriate decision to purchase based on company revenues and expenses, without needing a subsidy from the tax code. For businesses where some investment in capital equipment is expected eventually, it is likely that the provision will subsidize an acceleration of an investment that would have been done anyway, amounting to a mis-allocation of resources to garner the extra tax break, while temporarily available.</p>
<p>The subsidy for payroll expansion is at least more directly connected to a desired social goal of creating more jobs to reduce the unemployment problem and something that both small and large businesses can benefit from. The proposal calls for a 10% tax credit for the first $5 million of payroll expansion in 2012, capped at half a million. Payroll expansion can be either new hires or wage increases.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the GOP-led House is planning about double that amount as an outright giveaway to business. Cantor sponsored a 20% tax cut for all businesses with fewer than 500 workers. Those businesses are not necessarily &#8220;small&#8221; and the provision is not linked to payroll expansion, as Schumer noted. Id.</p>

<p>Is Congress drinking Grover Norquist koolaid? (or will it fund IRS appropriately)</p>
<p> IRS Commissioner Doug Shulman testified before the House Appropriations Financial Services and General Government Subcommittee on President Obama’s proposed 2013 budget for the IRS. Shulman wants Congress to provide adequate funding to the IRS to support its enforcement function. The IRS has 5000 fewer employees this filing season than in 2011, and Shulman is worried about the impact of that decline in enforcement capability on compliance and collections. See Rubin, <a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2012/03/The%20House%20Appropriations%20Financial%20Services%20and%20General%20Government%20Subcommittee%20will%20hold%20a%20hearing%20on%20President%20Obama%E2%80%99s%20proposed%202013%20budget%20for%20the%20IRS%20%20at%2010%20a.m.%20in%20Room%202359,%20Rayburn%20House%20Office%20Building.%20IRS%20Commissioner%20Douglas%20Shulman%20will%20testify.">IRS Eliminated 5,000 Jobs in past year amid budget cuts</a>, Bloomberg (Mar.21, 2012).</p>
<p>Now, those &#8220;starve-the-beast&#8221; types that drink the Grover Norquist koolaid are generally just eager to kill all government, and particularly government programs that help ordinary people, are concerned with the general public good, or help ensure the vitality of important government programs. </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<ul>
<li>So it seems that the right has no trouble talking about a need to return the US&#8217;s dismal health care system back to what it was before the little bit of progress accomplished in the Obama health reform legislation&#8211;they talk about eliminating government interference, but what they mean is letting health care profit centers, doctors, and insurers continue to rip off the American public that can least afford it with rentier profits. </li>
<li>And the right has no trouble with unfunding the EPA or enacting foolish laws restricting the agency&#8217;s ability to protect ordinary Americans&#8217; health, livelihood, and simple quality of life through much needed environmental regulations that protect, air, water, land, and natural resources for the future. Two examples&#8211;the right&#8217;s push to &#8220;drill, baby, drill&#8221; with the claim that a trickle more of US oil will dent world prices (nope); and the right&#8217;s push for the Keystone Pipeline no matter what the cost in aquifers or natural environments, even though the benefits are likely to be miniscule (VERY few jobs; no real impact on world energy prices). </li>
<li>The right wants to privatize Medicare&#8211;that means that it would take a program that has proven it can deliver health care more affordably to all its participants than privately financed &#8220;competitive&#8221; health care, and make it into its poorly functioning cousin. One suspects that the goal here is to bury a government program that is working as intended, so that it will be even harder to move to the obvious solution for health care that the rest of the developed world recognized decades ago&#8211;Medicare for all, or a &#8220;single payer&#8221; system that has clout, provides portability and fairness.</li>
</ul>
<p>And a component of the &#8220;starve-the-best; no-tax-increases-ever&#8221; koolaid package seems to be a desire to let the rich (the natural constituents of the right) get richer by continuing to be let off the hook on paying their fair share of taxes, while the overwhelming majority of Americans slip back into a much less hospitable context of just barely getting by. Taxes, of course, are one of the ways that is done, because it is so easy to hide the real purpose under a facade of caring about deficits (cut &#8220;entitlement&#8221; programs to save money) or growth (expand subdidies for the rich, to &#8220;grow&#8221; the economy).</p>
<p>So the IRS suffered from budget cuts that reduced its enforcement personnel. The result, of course, means fewer trained government officers to audit taxpayers and to investigate scandals like the wealthy millionaires and billionaires hiding their wealth overseas to avoid paying their fair share of taxes. And the danger is that criminal and civil tax evasion will be missed, because there are so few audits (only 1% audited annually) or that even compliant taxpayers will start to take their chances with the audit lottery once they realized that the IRS is part of the beast that the right is starving to death.</p>
<p>So Shulman is worried, he says, that budget cuts will erode voluntary compliance. He wants $12.8 billion for the IRS for the new fiscal year, an 8% increase. Rubin, <a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2012/03/The%20House%20Appropriations%20Financial%20Services%20and%20General%20Government%20Subcommittee%20will%20hold%20a%20hearing%20on%20President%20Obama%E2%80%99s%20proposed%202013%20budget%20for%20the%20IRS%20%20at%2010%20a.m.%20in%20Room%202359,%20Rayburn%20House%20Office%20Building.%20IRS%20Commissioner%20Douglas%20Shulman%20will%20testify.">IRS Eliminated 5,000 Jobs in past year amid budget cuts</a>, Bloomberg (Mar.21, 2012).</p>
<p>He should get it. Every dollar spent on enforcement brings in multiples of revenues, so the cost-benefit analysis clearly favors adequately funding the IRS enforcement budget so that it can do its job. That helps in two ways&#8211;it produces revenues that reduce the deficit, and it reminds people that our voluntary compliance system is backed up by enforcement of the laws&#8211;they can&#8217;t just cheat and play the audit lottery with high hopes of getting by.</p>
<p>And cutting the IRS does &#8220;long-term damage&#8221;. Jose Serrano, Id.</p>
<p>So will Congress keep swallowing the Norquist Koolaid, or will it buckle down and make decisions that support the wellbeing of our nation and of our people? We will see.</p>

<p> Still haven&#8217;t filed your FBAR? Don&#8217;t wait till you get hit with forfeiture like this Alaska Plastic Surgeon  </p>
<p>It looks like the leads from the various voluntary disclosures are beginning to pay off, as the U.S. is beginning to develop high stakes cases related to Americans who have tried to maintain secret caches of cash offshore&#8211;to hide from the taxman and from their ex-spouses! The forfeiture complaint in the case, filed Feb. 9, 2012 in California&#8217;s Central District, is available <a href="http://www.assetprotectionbook.com/casedocs/brandner/001_Complaint_09feb12.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p>The government seized $4.656 million belonging to Michael and Sheila Brandner (he&#8217;s the plastic surgeon) from an account at Bank of America in the name of Evergreen Capital LLC, an entity set up by Brandner and under his (hidden) control. The government&#8217;s tale is a sordid one&#8211;In the middle of Brandner&#8217;s divorce proceedings in May 2008, he drove to Panama where he deposited checks worth about $3.5 million in a non-US bank, with the purpose of concelaing the assets from his soon-to-be ex-wife. A person who became a &#8220;cooperating witness&#8221; helped him open the account and told him about the FBAR requirement, but Brandner didn&#8217;t file the required report. A few months later, Brandner transferred an additional $1.4 million, mostly from his pension fund, to that account (also to conceal it from his wife. The pension fund was awarded to his wife in the divorce proceedings, and when Brandner learned that the Panama account might be susceptible to discovery, Brandner moved the money through wire deposits in 2011 into the Bank of America account of Evergreen Capital, allegedly to conceal it from the IRS and from his ex-wife.</p>

<p>As the Atkinson story notes, this mess was doubly stupid. It was stupid of the surgeon to try to cheat his wife of assets and it was really stupid to do it in a way that could well ultimately subject him to criminal charges. See Jay Atkinson, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/jayadkisson/2012/03/17/brandner-alaska-plastic-surgeon-faces-forfeiture-of-4-656-million-for-undisclosed-offshore-account-used-to-attempt-to-cheat-ex-wife/">Brandner: Alaska Plastic Surgeon Faces Forfeiture Of $4.656 Million For Undisclosed Offshore Account Used To Attempt To Cheat Ex-Wife</a>, Forbes (Mar. 17, 2012). Anybody else that is still waiting out there with millions in an undeclared offshore account, watch out. The time to file and pay up has arrived.</p>
