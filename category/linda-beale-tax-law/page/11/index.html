<p>IRS proposes new innocent spouse procedures
<p>In a press release <a href="http://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,id=252036,00.html">IR 2012-3</a> (Jan. 5, 2012), the IRS has issued <a href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-12-08.pdf">Notice 2012-8</a> announcing a new revenue procedure updating Rev. Proc. 2003-61.  The IRS describes the effect of the procedure as follows.</p>
<blockquote><p>This proposed update to Rev. Proc. 2003-61 addresses the criteria used in making innocent spouse relief determinations for section 6015(f) equitable relief cases and revises the factors for granting equitable relief. The factors have been revised to ensure that requests for innocent spouse relief are granted under section 6015(f) when the facts and circumstances warrant and that, when appropriate, requests are granted in the initial stage of the administrative process. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> The IRS indicates that it will now take into account the other spouse&#8217;s abuse and financial control in making determinations for innocent spouse relief.</p>
<blockquote><p>  <a name="more"></a>
<p>Review of the innocent spouse program demonstrated that when a requesting spouse has been abused by the nonrequesting spouse, the requesting spouse may not have been able to challenge the treatment of any items on the joint return, question the payment of the taxes reported as due on the joint return, or challenge the nonrequesting spouse’s assurance regarding the payment of the taxes. Review of the program also highlighted that lack of financial control may have a similar impact on the requesting spouse’s ability to satisfy joint tax liabilities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For example, the proposed Rev. Proc. indicates that a nonrequesting spouse&#8217;s abuse of the requesting spouse may outweigh the fact that the requesting spouse had knowledge of likely noncompliance and that the requesting spouse&#8217;s subsequent compliance is a factor that may weigh in favor of relief.</p>
<blockquote><p>The proposed revenue procedure also provides for certain streamlined case determinations; new guidance on the potential impact of economic hardship; and the weight to be accorded to certain factual circumstances in determining equitable relief.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> These appear to be noteworthy and appropriate changes.  It is a problem when legal procedures fail to recognize the way that physical and psychological abuse can limit options for individuals.  This is particularly true in the case of abused spouses, who may not be allowed to question financial statements or tax returns before being forced to sign them by the abusing spouse.</p>

<p>CRS reports on repatriation tax holiday impact
<p>Shortly before the Christmas holiday, CRS released a report by Donald Marples and Jane Gravelle on the possibility of a second repatriation tax holiday for multinational corporations.  <a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/files/marples-and-gravelle.-tax-cuts-on-repatriation-earnings-as-economic-stimulus.-an-economic-analysis.-122011.c.rtf">Download Marples and Gravelle. tax cuts on repatriation earnings as economic stimulus. an economic analysis. 122011.c</a></p>
<p>The holiday has been pushed by various commentators who support reducing corporate taxation based on the argument that lower tax, and repatriated earnings, will result in greater investment in domestic business expansion and more US jobs. </p>
<p>Our experience with the 2004 repatriation holiday was not impressive.  Much of the repatriated funds were diverted to share buybacks and not used to increase investments or increase jobs.  IN fact, many companies that repatriated the most money engaged in heavy firings of workers.  Hewlett Packard was notable, with large layoffs accompanying significant repatriated cash.</p>
<p> <a name="more"></a>
<p>To repeat that experiment at a time when US companies have even more cash socked away in the US and abroad would merely reward those companies that decided to bet on (and lobby heavily for) a second repatriation holiday that would amount to a huge cut in their taxes&#8211;like having the best of a territorial tax system at the same time that they get all the benefits (foreign tax credits, active financing exception, etc.) of the current worldwide tax regime.</p>
<p>The CRS report doesn&#8217;t suggest that another repatriation holiday would be a sure-fire economic growth engine.  In fact, it notes that it can be counterexpansionary if money is used to address cash-flow problems or to pay out to shareholders.</p>
<blockquote><p>Viewed in the current debate on how to most efficiently stimulate the economy, economic theory suggests that the simulative effect of a temporary tax cut for repatriations may be offset, or more than offset, by exchange rate adjustments that would reduce net exports.</p>
<p>In addition, how businesses use repatriated earnings will impact the stimulative or contractionary effect of a tax cut for repatriations. For example, repatriated earnings will have a larger stimulative effect, or smaller contractionary effect, the greater the degree to which they are used to increase current investment. A smaller stimulative effect or a larger contractionary effect will result, in contrast, if more of the repatriated earnings are used to shore up “cash-flow” issues or pay dividends.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A repatriation tax holiday is not a good idea.  it wasn&#8217;t a good idea in 2004.  It is not a good idea now.  There is no reason to give multinational corporations a tax break to bring money back to this country.  They&#8217;re cash rich as it is and can make investments if they want to. </p>

<p>Romney&#8217;s Tax Plan&#8211;good for the wealthy, not so good for everybody else
<p>The Tax Policy Center has done an analysis of Romney&#8217;s plan for US taxation.  See<a href="http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxtopics/romney-plan.cfm">The Romney Plan</a>.  It doesn&#8217;t look bad at all for the wealthy.  In adding at least $600 billion to the U.S. deficit by 2015, Romney would</p>
<ul>
<li>reduce the statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 25% immediately (apparently with no need for offsets).  Since most corporations that actually pay any federal corporate income tax&#8211;which is very few of them, even when they are quite profitable economically&#8211;already pay effective tax rates as low as 0% and typically less than 25%, this can be expected to reduce those payments even more.  Lightening the burden on corporations will tend to result in higher payouts to those already overcompensated managers and higher payouts to shareholders, who tend to come from the very top of the income distribution.  Net result&#8211;more money for the wealthy, less money to finance the U.S. government, and more demands for limitations to the already thin safety net. </li>
<p> <a name="more"></a>
<li>eliminate the US system of taxation of worldwide income in favor of a &#8220;territorial&#8221; tax system.  this will be especially beneficial for multinational corporations and their owners and managers, and will tend to speed up the offshoring of US manufacturing and service jobs.  A boon for the wealthiest, but a real job eliminator for the rest of us. </li>
<li>reduce the maximum individual rate from 35% to 25% immediately (apparently with no need for offsets).  This will benefit the wealthiest of the wealthy, who already enjoy a very compressed income bracket progression. </li>
<li>Eliminate the estate tax.  This will benefit the wealthiest of the wealthy, who are the only ones who pay the estate tax now. </li>
<li>Retain the 15% rate for capital gains.  This will benefit the wealthy, since the top of the income distribution owns most of the financial assets. </li>
<li>Eliminate the capital gains tax for those with income of $200,000 or below.  This is one item that will benefit a few ordinary Americans, though even here it will provide minimal tax savings for them and more savings for those in the $100-200,000 income range, who are among the most well off, though not the upper-upper crust.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note there&#8217;s only one thing of the major changes in Romney&#8217;s list that can be said to be directed at all at the majority of taxpayers in the below $100,000 group (though it also favors those in the 100-200 thousand income).  Not surprisingly, Romney&#8217;s plan would increase taxes on the poorest among us, those with $20,000 or less in annual income, by 60%. </p>
<p>How can that be justified?  Romney says his plan is going to make the world better for inventors, job creators and entrepreneurs. </p>
<blockquote><p>“My administration will make America the best place in the world for entrepreneurs, inventors and job creators,” Romney said at a campaign event in Davenport, Iowa, on Dec. 27. “I’ll lower and simplify taxes, especially for middle-income Americans.” Bloomberg Newsweek (link below).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, the wealthiest taxpayers making $1 million or more will see a 15% cut in taxes paid.  That assumes, of course, that those ultra-wealthy who are mostly benefited by his version of tax &#8220;reform&#8221; fit that bill (inventors, job creators, entrepreneurs).  But most of their ownership is not an investment in a company, it is acquired in secondary market trades.  And most of them aren&#8217;t job creators and entreprenuers, they are just wealthy traders in the secondary market.  If we really want to help job creators and entrepreneurs, we&#8217;d be funding public education from K-12 through university and we&#8217;d be reinforcing and adding to our safety net programs instead of constantly threatening to reduce or eliminate them.

<p>Corporatism and taxes
<p>Corporatism is the term used to describe a economic and governmental approach that favors large entities over people, including adopting rules and regulations to suit the regulated entities, tilting legislation to protect corporate entities that might otherwise be considered to be causing harm to the public good, and allowing access to public fora and public representatives in ways that ensures that corporate voices are heard, whether or not those opposing them are heard.</p>
<p>Corporatism in tax policy has resulted in highly favorable readings of the reorganization provisions&#8211;for example, current IRS regulatory approaches proclaim that even losses can be recognized in corporate reorgs, going against well-settled understandings of the operation of the corporate reorganization provisions, and the Code and regulations permit a vastly expanded range of flexible transactions, especially of spins under section 355 and of A reorgs (a mere 40% equity consideration now &#8216;counts&#8217; as sufficient to provide tax-free reorganization status). </p>
<p> <a name="more"></a>
<p>Corporatism has been around in one form or another for a long time, but it was immensely aided by the activism of organizations like the US Chamber of Commerce and the National association of Manufacturers and the ideological &#8216;think-tanks&#8217; supported by them and by corporate and wealthy backers. </p>
<p>For a revealing slice of the history of corporatism, every reader should be familiar with Lewis Powell&#8217;s 1971 memo on the means by which business could take over government.  It is given a thorough airing (and there&#8217;s a link to the memo itself) by William Black on the blog New Economic Perspectives, <a href="http://neweconomicperspectives.blogspot.com/2011/04/my-class-right-or-wrong-powell.html">My Class Right or Wrong: the Power memorandum&#8217;s 40th Anniversary</a> (April 25, 2011).</p>

<p>   Ian Ayres on the Brandeis Tax</p>
<p>  I&#8217;ve often argued here that vast inequality is harmful to democracy, and that the kind of unequal society that we have today, reflected the Gilded Age of yore, is especially worrisome.  Much of what is happening in this country that threatens freedom and economic suffering for many is related to the vastly unequal incomes and wealth of the top 1% compared to the rest of us.  Oligarchy finds it easy to flourish in such a society, and democracy struggles to keep its head above water.  The corporatist agenda that favors big business (and its owners) facilitates the capture of the state for the benefit of the rich&#8211;lobbyists swarm legislators, and campaign funding by corporations floods the airwaves with repetitive (and hence believed even if untrue) messages favoring corporatist allies. </p>
<p>The main defenses that a society has against such developments are twofold:  1) a strong sense of community that incentivizes the uberrich to give a good bit of their wealth away to help the community and 2) a strong tax system&#8211;especially estate taxes and other taxes that fall primarily or exclusively on the uberrich as a way of skimming off the excess rents they have acquired because of their status and unrelated to genuine merit or hard work.  {As Elizabeth Warren said, nobody can claim to have earned all they earn without the help of the state, and the wealthy in particular depend on the state to protect their property and even their status.)  Hence I talk here of democratic egalitarianism and my view that equilibrium is not a realistic state so redistribution is always occuring.  Most redistribution will be &#8216;upwards&#8217; for the benefit of those at the top, unless democratic institutions push for a rebalancing redistribution &#8216;downwards&#8217; to assist those in the middle and lower income groups.</p>
<p>Ian Ayres has a series of postings on a proposed &#8220;Brandeis&#8221; tax intended to impose limitations on the inequality gap.    <br /><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/19/opinion/dont-tax-the-rich-tax-inequality-itself.html">Don&#8217;t tax the rich, tax inequality itself</a>, New York Times, Op-Ed, Dec. 18, 2011.<br />
<blockquote>In 1980, the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans made 9.1 percent of our nation’s pre-tax income; by 2006 that share had risen to 18.8 percent — slightly higher than when Brandeis joined the Supreme Court in 1916.</p></blockquote>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />
<blockquote>Congress might have countered this increased concentration but, instead, tax changes have exacerbated the trend: in after-tax dollars, our wealthiest 1 percent over this same period went from receiving 7.7 percent to 16.3 percent of our nation’s income.<br />What we call the Brandeis Ratio — the ratio of the average income of the nation’s richest 1 percent to the median household income — has skyrocketed since Ronald Reagan took office. In 1980 the average 1-percenter made 12.5 times the median income, but in 2006 (the latest year for which data is available) the average income of our richest 1 percent was a whopping 36 times greater than that of the median household.<br />Brandeis understood that at some point the concentration of economic power could undermine the democratic requisite of dispersed political power. This concern looms large in today’s America, where billionaires are allowed to spend unlimited amounts of money on their own campaigns or expressly advocating the election of others.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>The vast shift in national income toward our richest 1 percent is especially vivid if their income is expressed in terms of the median household income. Indeed, an important goal of our op-ed was to suggest a new unit of measure, “medians” to help us think about what it means to be rich. In 1980, if you earned 3.8 medians, you were in the top 1 percent, but by 2006 even the poorest in the 1 percent club earned 6.9 medians. <br />What we call the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/19/opinion/dont-tax-the-rich-tax-inequality-itself.html?ref=opinion">“Brandeis Ratio,”</a> the <em>average</em> income of the richest 1 percent (which includes the billions earned by the lucky few) has grown even more disproportionate. As shown in the chart below, in 1980, one-percenters on average made 12.5 medians, but in 2006 (the latest year in which data is available) the average income of our richest 1 percent was a whopping 36 medians.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>A central idea behind our Brandeis tax proposal was to have a tax that is triggered by increases in inequality. Our Brandeis tax does not target excessive income per se; it only caps inequality. Billionaires could double their current income without the tax kicking in — as long as the median income also doubles. The sky is the limit for the rich as long as the “rising tide lifts all boats.” Indeed, the tax gives job creators an extra reason to make sure that corporate wealth does in fact trickle down.<br />***<br />As emphasized by <strong>Lawrence Lessig</strong> in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Republic-Lost-Money-Corrupts-Congress/dp/0446576433"><em>Republic, Lost</em></a><em> </em>(presaged somewhat in Ayres’ book with <strong>Bruce Ackerman</strong>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Voting-Dollars-Paradigm-Campaign-Finance/dp/0300092628"><em>Voting With Dollars</em></a>), the bulk of campaign finance dollars comes disproportionately from not just the 1% club, but the richest one-half of one-percenters.  Focusing on the average income of one-percenters is a good proxy for the rising political power of plutocrats.</p></blockquote>

<div></div>
<div><i>[edited to rephrase and correct typos 12/26/11 5 pm]</i></div>
<div></div>
<div>Joseph Rago and Paul Gigot interviewed Mitt Romney on his &#8216;vision&#8217; for America&#8211;&#8220;On Taxes, &#8216;Modeling&#8217;, and the Vision Thing&#8221;, Wall St. J. Dec. 23-24, 2011, at A13.  In it, Romney reveals the way patrician wealth has affected his values, casting President Obama as a &#8220;European social democrat&#8221; and suggesting that contrasts with his own belief in a &#8220;merit-based opportunity society&#8211;where people earn their rewards based upon their education, their work, their willingness to take risks and their dreams.&#8221;  </div>
<div>Now everybody likes the idea of people being able to advance based on merit, rather than on crony capitalism, improper influence or whatever.   The problem with suggesting that America is a &#8216;merit-based opportunity society&#8217; is that it isn&#8217;t much of one anymore: America in this second Gilded Age is primarily a wealth-and-status-based opportunity society. </div>
<ul type="disc">
<li><i>Education</i>:  Even Romney admitted      (obviously unintentionally) that wealth makes a real difference, since he      noted that rewards depend in part on education.  People with wealth      receive the finest educations from pre-K through post-graduate, getting      preferences at the best children&#8217;s academies in Manhattan and at the      highest ranked universities like Harvard and Yale.  People without      wealth lose out from the very beginning, with inferior schools that are no      longer fully supported by the public, as charter and for-profit schools      take over offering inferior educations that no patrician family      would ever accept.  The poor and middle class take on enormous loans      and work loads to finance even their public university educations,      since state support has slipped down to a mere 20-30% of      the cost of that education.  That makes study and grades and success      much more difficult for them. </li>
<li><a name="more"></a> </li>
<li><i>Working hard (with      Contacts/Influence/lobbyists)</i>:  The wealthy are introduced early to the most      important people of influence in society, like the Vanderbilts and the      Astors of old, the private equity fund managers and the Wall Street      bankers that can smooth their way through all the trials and tribulations      of their &#8216;work&#8217; careers&#8211;i.e., becoming owners of major league baseball      team when you have no relevant experience (George W. Bush, with the aid of      his papa and his papa&#8217;s influential and rich partners) or setting up a      venture capital fund (like Romney&#8217;s Bain Capital). These connections      ultimately permit the wealthy to mingle in a monied society that      offers the right contact for every venture to succeed&#8211;including lobbyists      to help a wealthy entrepreneur get his business going and ability to      &#8216;invest&#8217; in politicians who are willing to risk alienating the middle      class to support preferential taxation of the rich.  </li>
<ul type="circle">
<li>By the way, lots       of the not-rich work quite hard, often at thankless       jobs that provide no cushion to deal with life&#8217;s difficult blows or       at a job that, at minimum wage, still leaves their family below the       poverty line.  Without the contacts and influence that smooth       the way of the rich, there chances of moving up are much more       limited.  If they persevere, have an entrepreneurial idea,       <u>and</u> catch a break, they may be able to move beyond where they       are, but they have to do a lot more than just &#8216;work hard.&#8217;   </li>
</ul>
<li><i>Taking Risks (and Getting Subsidies      and Preferential Tax Provisions)</i>:  The poor take a risk every      time they get up in the morning&#8211;will their health hold out so they can      keep working? will they be able to make it to their job in that car that      needs a new starter? can they manage to arrange for someone to take care      of their kids while they work or will they have to be &#8220;latch-key      kids&#8221; yet another day?  But they don&#8217;t usually have the kind of      capital nest-egg to take a risk with in the way that Romney means it&#8211;the      excitement of opening a new business demands from the poor and      near-poor Herculean efforts to pull together family, friends,      and workers to support their business ideas.  Those with      money, on the other hand, have a head start on all of this.  Bill      Gates&#8217; parents offered him an educated life of relative ease; he could      &#8216;play&#8217; in the garage on that dream of his rather than running heavy machinery      or working behind a counter at a McDonalds.  And those with contacts      and money are able (and willing) to hire the best lobbyists to ensure that      they get all the tax-advantaged benefits and subsidies that they can      finnangle (or buy) from local, state and federal legislators for      their activities.  That includes favorable tax provisions that      allow them to keep a significant percentage of their wealth (and to fight      for even more favorable provisions), such as the <u>carried interest      provision </u>that gave Romney a preferential rate on almost all of his      compensation income, the <u>preferential capital gains rate </u>that gives      all the wealthy a low tax rate on their income from trading stocks and      bonds with each other, and the various ways that the tax code subsidizes the      kinds of personal deductions that provide the most benefit to those with      money&#8211;from the charitable contribution deduction (including the ability      to give away stock and claim a deduction for its value rather than for      your actual basis) and the mortgage interest deduction      (for interest on home loans up to a million plus $100,000)      to all of those provisions that allow the wealthy to      retire well&#8211;pension plans, exclusion of life insurance benefits,      etc.  Then there are the many subsidies they get various governments      to provide for their businesses, presumably by using those long-term      family/status connections to wine, dine and influence.  They include      low-cost loans such as those enjoyed by Romney&#8217;s Bain Capital for various      businesses that Bain Capital was &#8216;turning around&#8217;.       (Handily, they can make low-taxed profits for themselves even      when their turnarounds fail, with all those subsidies, so that the      taxpayer sometimes ends up paying  for their losses along with      the fired workers.)  See the links provided in the posting      yesterday on Romney&#8217;s reluctance to release his tax returns, which      discuss some of the subsidies and other benefits to Romney&#8217;s      business. </li>
</ul>
<div>That&#8217;s not a merit-based opportunity society:  it&#8217;s an influence-based society, where the poor and even most of the middle class are working against long odds to make headway. </div>
<div>And there&#8217;s not much evidence that Romney recognizes this fundamental difference in existence of the well-off and the not-so-well-off here in America.  Take the Gigot story&#8217;s discussion of tax policy and what kinds of &#8220;reforms&#8221; Romney supports.  The Journal apparently thinks Romney is too timid on &#8216;risk-taking&#8217; because he didn&#8217;t espouse the kind of tax agenda that the Journal supports&#8211;moving to a consumption tax&#8211;like the national sales tax&#8211; that shifts most of the tax burden to ordinary folks (since they will pay tax on most or all of their  income since they spend most of it on food, shelter, clothing and other necessities) and leaves a zero percent tax rate on the capital gains, dividends, and other income from capital that makes up most of the income of the wealthy and little of the income of everybody else.  Why, the Journal notes, Romney&#8217;s plan merely calls for extending the Bush tax cuts, cutting the statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 25%, and eliminating capital gains and dividends taxes only for those who make $200,000 or less.  Romney won&#8217;t even say he supports a consumption tax til he&#8217;s studied it more, though he likes the purported &#8220;simplicity&#8221; of a flat tax.    Romney also says he likes &#8220;removing the distortion in our tax code for certain classes of investment&#8221;.  This means that Romney does not understand the real economics of the consumption tax and the so-called &#8216;flat tax&#8217;, both of which result in taxation of 100% of the income of the poor and near poor and most of the middle class while leaving the rich with a minimal tax burden.  Any system for alleviating that burden (such as a low-level exemption at the bottom of the income scale) would thrust a truly burdensome recordkeeping requirement on those least able to cope with it.  Especially for versions that merely zero out the tax rate on income from capital, distortions would be magnified: the categorization of income into different types is one of the primary distortions in our system, and any plan to eliminate taxes on one type of income while retaining them on another increases distortions rather than removing them!</div>
<div>What about Romney&#8217;s saying he won&#8217;t propose cuts in individual tax rates for those making more than $200,000?  The Journal seems to think that is rather cowardly, since such a proposal accepts President Obama&#8217;s linedrawing on where rate cuts might be reasonable.  Now, aside from the failure to consider dropping the entire bunch of Bush tax cuts and letting all the rates go back to the level that they were when Bush took office (which might well be the best tax reform the Congress could do at this point), Romney should be commended for at least recognizing that the wealthy have gotten a fistful of tax gifts from the Bush individual tax cuts (and, indirectly, from the various corporate tax provisions that have allowed companies to pay less and less into the federal fisc) and for not wanting to proffer even more. </div>
<div>But here&#8217;s the rub.  Romney doesn&#8217;t recognize the damage from the wealthier among us continuing to get even wealthier while the vast majority suffers stagnation and decline:  as the concentration of income increases at the top and inequality becomes the defining characteristic of this society, opportunity for all is threatened as is democracy itself.  Tax policies that could serve as a deterrent to that wealth buildup at the top&#8211;e.g., a stiffer, progressive estate tax, a financial transactions tax to discourage trading and capture a tiny amount in connection with those secondary market trades amongst the wealthy, and bracket expansions that would create a more progressive set of tax rates for the highest income that would distinguish between those who have $400,000 a year and those who have $2 million a year&#8211;aren&#8217;t even on Romney&#8217;s radar screen.  He&#8217;s content with the current system&#8217;s distribution, one that is highly favorable to the wealthy.  As a recent FED Finance and Economics Discussion Series article made clear, inequality has made permanent inroads and tax policies haven&#8217;t done much to dampen them.  See Jason DeBacker et al, <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2011/201160/201160abs.html">Rising Inequality, Transitory or Permanent? New Evidence from a U.S. Panel of Household Income 1987-2006</a>.</div>
<div>Romeny&#8217;s made it clear that he isn&#8217;t about to challenge the status quo of an easy tax life for the wealthy.  Here&#8217;s what he said to the Journal on the question of making sure that the wealthy never see any kind of a tax increase.</div>
<div>&#8220;My intent is to simplify our tax code and create growth, and so I will also look to see whether the top one-half of 1% or one-thousandth of 1% or top 1% are still paying roughly the same share of the total tax burden that they have today.  I&#8217;m not looking to lower the share paid for by the top.&#8221;  Wall St. J., Dec. 24-25, 2011, at A13 (quoting Romney).</div>
<div>So after a decade of cutting taxes on the wealthy and passing more and more provisions that benefit the wealthy in particular either directly or indirectly, Romney declares today&#8217;s status quo as the perfect state for things to be in&#8211;the current low taxes on the wealthy, in perpetuity, are his goal.  And while we may applaud him for not intending to lower taxeds further on the wealthy, it is hard to see how continuing current tax policy towards the wealthy makes sense for the fisc or for democracy.   Carried interest&#8211;won&#8217;t be taxed under Romney as the ordinary compensation that it is.  Mortgage interest deduction on million-dollar loans&#8211;won&#8217;t be pulled back to a more reasonable amount such as the interest on a loan that is 80% of the value of the median-priced US home.  Charitable contribution deduction for value rather than basis in stocks contributed&#8211;won&#8217;t get rid of that one.  Establishment of new brackets to recognize the drastic expansion of incomes at the top so that those with progressively more income are paying progressively more in taxes&#8211;won&#8217;t happen under Romney.  Why?  Because he is going to make sure that the top 1%, the top 1/2%, the top 1/1000% don&#8217;t pay less, but also don&#8217;t pay a bit more in taxes than they are paying now, this perfect state where the GOP wants to cut people off Medicaid to save money, turn Medicare into a &#8216;premium support&#8217; system that will shift more and more of the burden of health care in one&#8217;s old age to the vulnerable elderly with a pension they can&#8217;t count on and a Social Security system that the GOP is trying to ensure that they can&#8217;t count on.</div>
<div>Most tax &#8220;simplification&#8221; promoted by lobbyists won&#8217;t create growth&#8211;it is much more likely to result in tax loopholes that the wealthy can drive a truck through.  Refusing ever to increase taxes, even on the ultra-rich who can clearly afford to pay more (without really noticing the difference in spending power) won&#8217;t create growth&#8211;it most likely will result in a stagnant economy where the burdened middle class gradually falls into the ranks of the New Poor. </div>

<p> So we thought we had finally created a national system of health insurance that would permit near-universal coverage for essential health benefits to every American. </p>
<p>But the Obama administration says it is not going to write rules regulating exactly what benefits must be covered.  Again bowing his head to the GOP personal responsibility/states&#8217; rights mantras, the president is willing to let states &#8220;experiment&#8221; like they do with Medicaid.  Question whether this amounts to allowing right-wing states to shift benefits to private profits and away from care for Americans?<br />This goes back to the recommendation from a panel at The National Academic of Sciences, which said that the federal government should take cost into consideration in deciding what&#8217;s essential to be provided by health insurance plans under the reform act and that new benefits should be &#8216;offset&#8217; by cost cutting elsewhere. Robert Pear, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/07/us/politics/panel-says-us-should-weigh-cost-in-health-coverage.html">Panel Says U.S. Should Weigh Cost in Deciding &#8216;Essential Health Benefits'&#8221;</a>, New York Times, Oct. 7, 2011, A14.<br />  <br />But a primary problem with cost-benefit analysis as typically understood is that it favors the status quo because any new benefit for which money must be expended will cost compared to the current system, and the benefit is much harder to turn into a quantitative number that will prove that the cost is worth it.  It is very hard to do truly &#8216;dynamic&#8217; cost-benefit analysis&#8211;the assumptions used tend to be a one-size-fits-all and it is hard to calculate the way that the immediate benefit builds even more substantial long-term benefits and then result in much lower costs down the road,</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>so that current costs that will have substantial long-term benefits that may not add up to significant numbers until years or decades have passed will tend to be viewed as negatives, whereas maintaining a terribly ineffective and unjust status quo will be seen as positive.  Even more killing for any cost-benefit analysis of medical reform where part of the reason for the problem is the exorbitant pricing that creates large profits for doctors and for-profit hospitals is that If &#8216;costs&#8217; take into account the fact that decent health care modeling should reduce the highest end medical provider incomes (like the excessive profits made by private nursing homes and hospitals and surgeons who do not work on salary, etc.), then of course the cost-benefit analysis will favor the status quo where those that have money get good care and those that don&#8217;t die.</p>
<p>One of the ways that the failure to adopt at least a public option or ideally a single (national) payer option for health care reform shows is that the panel suggested that the minimum coverage required should conform to what small employers provide&#8211;typically much less generous coverage than that provided by large employers.  As the October New York Times article on this noted, &#8220;This reading of the law was unexpected, but the panel said it was justified because small businesses &#8216;will be among the main customers for policies in the state-based exchanges.'&#8221;  Id.  Not surprisingly, the article also concludes that &#8220;the recommendation is likely to please employers and insurance companies and could cause concern among some advocates for consumers and patients with particular illnesses who want more expansive benefits.&#8221;  Id.  Again&#8211;just more evidence that the right option for health reform is an extension of Medicare for all, not this piece-meal attempt to appease health insurers and health providers by attempting to guarantee that they can still reap huge profits out of what should be a universally provided public good.</p>

<p>There are two letters to the editor in the Times today that are worth noting&#8211;as usual, the &#8216;real&#8217; analysis is hidden in the interior pages, positioned next to a huge ad (for an investment adviser, no less).<br />Chris Cannon from San Francisco notes that treating Madoff as the iconic symbol of the financial disruption caused by the credit bubble is problematic. <br />
<blockquote>&#8220;Everyone agrees that Mr. Madoff broke the rules.  But the damage done by those acting as allowed by our ineffective rules cost the public much more.  &#8216;Our troubled financial times&#8217; are the product of a bubble economy fueled by cheap money, an abject failure by rating agencies, regulatory agencies that have been hamstrung by regulations written by financial lobbyists, and a laserlike focus by some bank leaders on yearly bonuses.&#8221;  Letters, New York Times, Dec. 18, 2011, at BU 7.</p></blockquote>
<p>Steven Conn, Yellow Springs Ohio, notes that Greg Mankiw (economic adviser to Republicans, and specifically to Mitt Romney) misses the boat on understanding the way that economics is burdened with ideology. <br />
<blockquote>&#8220;He seems not to understand that economists aren&#8217;t really objective and dispassionate scientists.  Economics is merely a set of tools with which we build the kind of society we want to live in.  Defining what that means is, of course, an ideological proposition, and thus all economic &#8216;theory&#8217; is freighted with ideological baggage.&#8221;  Letters, New York Times, Dec. 18, 2011, at BU 7.</p></blockquote>
<p>These two ideas are related.</p>

<p> One of the reasons that someone like Madoff could get away with a long-term, enormous economic scam is that the reigning economic ideology from 1980 to 2010 has been the neoliberal belief in unfettered markets, taking power with &#8216;reaganomics&#8217; and the acceptance of &#8216;greed is good&#8217; corporatism that took hold in 1980, in which those that are sleazy, fraudulent or just intent on having things work out a certain way can take enormous means to achieve their petty ends&#8211;like hiring just-out-of-Congress people to panhandle for them in the halls of Congress and to hobnob with regulators, drafting the rules that govern the industry.  It is the enormous expansion of this corporatist perspective that permits money to buy the rules that caused the financial crisis and that continues to pervade the policy solutions that can get through a Congress that is behoven to lobbyists and Big Money in various industries. <br />As long as we leave tax policy fundamentally to the corporatist moneybags and ideological economists, we can expect regulations to fall short of what they ought to do to protect ordinary Americans; corporations to make money out of failing to do what they ought to do to protect their workers, their customers, and their communities; tax laws that fail to exact a reasonable share of the fiscal burden from the very wealthy (such as the current trend towards decimation of the estate tax, often the only way that some extraordinarily wealthy families pay much of anything, because most of their income is in the favored form of capital gains and income on capital); and the passage of stupid laws that take away our most precious Constitutional rights&#8211;like the legislation under consideration that will permit the MILITARY TO DETAIN US CITIZENS WITHOUT DUE PROCESS. <br />And the result of these tax and economic policies will be a continuation of the trend towards a two-class society of the very rich and the rest of us that has been aided and abetted by reaganomics.  See Allegretto, <a href="http://blogs.berkeley.edu/2011/12/05/the-few-the-proud-the-very-rich/">the few, the proud, and the very rich</a>, Berkeley Blog, Dec. 2011.<br />
<blockquote>The share of wealth held by the top fifth is about 87.2 percent while the bottom four-fifths share the remaining 12.8 percent of wealth—so the <em>Occupiers </em>are correct in their assessment. And, the riches of those in the top 1 percent are about 225 times greater than that held by the typical family—it was 125 times in 1962—so, Grandma was correct too.<br />***<br />In 2007 (the most recent SCF) the cumulative wealth of the Forbes 400 was $1.54 trillion or roughly the same amount of wealth held by the entire bottom fifty percent of American families&#8230;.Upon closer inspection, the Forbes list reveals that six Waltons—all children (one daughter-in-law) of Sam or James “Bud” Walton the founders of Wal-Mart—were on the list. The combined worth of the Walton six was $69.7 billion in 2007—which equated to the total wealth of the entire bottom thirty percent!  Id.</p></blockquote>

<p>  House passes spending bill    </p>
<p>While the Senate was wrangling over what of the noxious provisions in HR 3630 they would have to keep in order to get expanded unemployment compensation and a payroll tax cut, the House passed a spending bill 296-121 (with 147 Republicans and 149 Democrats in favor) to carry the government through September 2012.  Steinhauer &#038; Pear, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/17/us/politics/boehner-ties-oil-pipeline-to-payroll-tax-bill.html">Senate Leaders Agree to a Two Month Extension of the Payroll Tax Cut</a>, New York Times (Dec. 16, 2011).</p>
<p>The GOP strategy is to obstruct and demand&#8211;one right-wing idea after another is inserted into every bill, just so the Dems will think they have won something when they give the Republicans ten things instead of 100!<br />
<blockquote>As wrangling over the tax has continued, Republican leaders have sought to build support for the measure by adding conservative policy provisions, which have replaced earmarks as the legislative sweetener for Republican lawmakers in a Congress where fundamental differences about the role of government in American life deeply divide the parties.<br />That conflict, which mirrors the broader political dynamic across the country, is unlikely to ebb in the second session, as Republicans labor to make life more difficult for President Obama and Democrats struggle to hold the White House and the Senate.  Id.</p></blockquote>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>The spending bill isn&#8217;t much better.  See Sonmez, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/2chambers/post/government-funding-bill-that-will-avert-shutdown-passed-by-house/2011/12/16/gIQAq2ggyO_blog.html">Government Funding Bill That Will Avert Shutdown Passed by House</a>, Washington Post Blog, Dec. 16, 2011; Steinhauer &#038; Pear, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/17/us/politics/boehner-ties-oil-pipeline-to-payroll-tax-bill.html">Senate Leaders Agree to a Two Month Extension of the Payroll Tax Cut</a>, New York Times (Dec. 16, 2011). Defense gets $518 billion and military gets a 1.6% pay raise.  (Remember that this same house in HR 3630, the unemployment extension bill, wanted to freeze all federal workers&#8217; pay for another year, and require greater retirement contributions, among other stingy things for ordinary people.) </p>
<p>In line with the GOP&#8217;s anti-regulations ploy, the House bill makes it harder for the government to regulate marketing for food targeted at kids&#8211;now there has to be a cost-benefit analysis.  Regretably, cost-benefit analysis is one of those &#8220;economics&#8221;-based policy ideas that essentially favors the retention of the status quo: any regulation will cost businesses something (restrained marketing to kids costs junk food businesses a whole sector of potential targets, er, customers), and the business world portrays the benefit of healthy food or less exploited kids as miniscule compared to the wonders of their profits and what that can do for society (the wealthy will get wealthier, no doubt).</p>
<p>The House doesn&#8217;t care much for ordinary people.  Low-income heating assistance spending will be cut compared to last year and the National Institutes for Health will be barely increased.  The GOP is placing its moral oprobrium of gays in the limelight by prohibiting health money from being used in needle exchange programs, which have been shown to be effective in curbing the spread of AIDS.  Obama&#8217;s education initiative is cut 20%&#8211;in spite of the fact that education is key to economic growth and the development of human capital.</p>

<p>Payroll Tax Cut -Keystone vote up Saturday at 9 in Senate</p>
<p>Apparently, Senate leaders on Friday ironed out the difficulty between the GOP and the Democratic party.  The GOP got most everything it wanted, and the Dems got just barely more than nothing.  That&#8217;s the way &#8220;negotiating&#8221; seems to go in the Congress these days.  The right demands and demands and demands and gets most of it by obfuscating and obstructing. </p>
<p>This time the Dems were worried about not getting a spending bill.  So while the House passed a spending bill to carry the Federal Government through September 2012, the Senate caved on all the things they&#8217;d said they wouldn&#8217;t cave on&#8211;like the ridiculous provision for expedited approval of the Keystone Pipeline.  All to get just a 2-month extension of the payroll tax cut and expanded unemployment benefits&#8211;which the GOP knew it could not afford not to pass, no matter what.  And Obama has already flipped on his earlier looks-like-he&#8217;s-finally-figured-out-how-to-stand-tall position that he would veto any bill that carried the expedited Keystone approval provision.  See Steinhaur &#038; Pear, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/17/us/politics/boehner-ties-oil-pipeline-to-payroll-tax-bill.html">Senate Agrees to a Two-Month Extension of the Tax Cut</a>, New York Times (Dec. 16, 2011). <br /><a name="more"></a>The GOP continues to call the Keystone pipeline project a &#8220;job creator&#8221;, even though it will create no more than 50 permanent jobs, at a considerable environmental cost.  Schumer calls the Keystone provision a &#8220;Pyrrhic victory&#8221; for the GOP, because he says Obama will not approve it if pushed.  That&#8217;s not so clear to me.  Schumer also spins the cave-in as a victory for Dems! saying that the GOP won&#8217;t have the leverage of the need to pass a spending bill when this issue comes back.  See  Rubin et al, <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-12-16/u-s-senate-leaders-agree-on-two-month-payroll-tax-cut-extension.html">U.S. Senate Leaders Agree on Two-Month Payroll Cut </a>, Bloomberg.com (Dec. 16, 2011). <br />Again, past experience suggests this may be too rosy an assessment.  There were commentators who thought that surely the Congress would not pass further tax cuts after the 2001 tax cuts resulted in large deficits but instead we got the 2003 bill and the 2004 tax giveaway for corporations bill and many others, with the deficits mounting with each one.  One would have thought that the sunset of the various Bush tax cuts in 2010 would have been a perfect time for the Dems to develop a spine, but they didn&#8217;t.  And the Dems weren&#8217;t even able to pass a bill ending the carried interest subsidy for hedge fund managers, in spite of the Great Recession and the need to reign in financial institutions.<br />The Senate bill will apparently at least not include some of the bad stuff  that was in HR 3630 as passed by the House&#8211;it is &#8220;scaled back&#8221; so it looks like medicare premiums won&#8217;t rise for seniors, and  the GOP won&#8217;t win its attempt to end medicare&#8217;s coverage of outpatient rehabilitative therapy for stroke victims and medicare payments to doctors will not be affected.   Nor will it include the &#8220;extensions&#8221; of expiring tax provisions like the R&#038;D credit or the active financing exception for the financial  industries&#8217; deferral of its offshoreprofits.  Id.<br />The Senate bill will apparently be paid for by raising the guarantee fees for Freddie and Fannie, something that was included in HR 3630.  Id.  Vote is to take place at 9 am Saturday.<br />crossposted at <a href="http://www.blogger.com/Payroll%20Tax%20Cut%20-Keystone%20vote%20up%20Saturday%20at%209%20in%20Senate" target="_blank">ataxingmatter</a></p>
