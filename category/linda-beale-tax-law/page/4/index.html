<p>Romney&#8217;s Tax (Mis)Calculations: if your two and two don&#8217;t add to four, pretend the Laffer curve gives you more</p>
<p>Anybody watching last night&#8217;s presidential debate surely became aware at some point that Romney&#8217;s so-called &#8220;plan&#8221; for economic growth is an empty shell based on <a href="http://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=5048766"></a>the idea that he&#8217;s made money for himself so he knows how to run a country. </p>
<p>Romney&#8217;s plan is pure <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_fundamentalism">market fundamentalism</a>&#8211;a mistaken view that the &#8220;market&#8221; will take care of all problems and vigorously grow to elevate everyone&#8217;s livelihood just so long as government regulators stay out of the business of regulating and allow business owners and managers (particularly huge multinational corporate owners and managers) to do whatever they want, including fire workers, outsource business assets, and engage in complex schemes to turn tax laws into tax avoidance bonanzas.  Oh, and the government should provide all kinds of subsidies to aid those businesses at minimal or no (tax) cost&#8211;from interstate roadways to easy rights to exploit national lands owned by the public; from localo fire protection to federally funded international security; from state-based contract protection to federal courts that provide handy forum choices to the wealthy and big corporations; from state and local property tax exemptions and waivers to federal intellectual property rights that provide monopoly power and stifle innovation (exactly the opposite of the Founders&#8217; dream).</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>And when Romney claims that he can &#8220;simplify&#8221; the tax system and lower everyone&#8217;s rates without increasing the deficit, reducing the taxes paid by the upper crust, or increasing the taxes paid by the middle class, while at the same time increasing the military budget and striking more threatening poses a la the Bush neo-cons on Iran?  That&#8217;s gibberish, as many respected studies have shown.</p>
<p>So to his rescue comes one of those propaganda tanks in the guise of an intellectual &#8220;institute&#8221;&#8211;the Institute for Policy Innovation (IPI).  The Institute puts out a &#8220;Tax Bytes&#8221; newsletter/blogpost supporting right-wing, market fundamentalist, Friedman-lite tax policies.  Not surprisingly, the Institute is sanguine about making a Reagan-style across-the-board rate reduction program work even in an economy that is still in transition back from the brink that the Bush market fundamentalist tax and fiscal policies put us in.  That is,  in spite of the fact that Romney-Ryan stand for things like making the Bush tax cuts permanent, eliminating the estate tax, maintaining the preferential rate structure for capital gains and carried interest, and even extending that very low rate preference to all other capital income (like interest) for those earning less than $200,000 (who don&#8217;t have much capital income to worry about though, since the vast majority of it goes to the people in the very top 5% who make millions, not thousands)&#8211;the Institute says &#8220;increased private sector growth&#8221; will make the plan work.  See &#8220;<a href="http://us2.campaign-archive1.com/?u=236713c0eb5508a7a8a8c680e&#038;id=8964e6a996&#038;e=1e32789ab4">Of Course It Can Work</a>&#8220;, IPI, TaxBytes 9.25 (October 17, 2012).  That&#8217;s just the Laffer Curve idea at its worst&#8211;the wacky concept that when you cut taxes, there will be more tax revenues because of all the wonderful things that a self-regulated market does for economies.<br />    <br />So IPI thinks you can cut government revenues even more than Bush did (when the Bush tax cuts of 2001-2003-2004 (and the rest) amounted to about one-third of the cause of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late-2000s_recession">Great Recession</a>).  It buys into the fairy tale that has been used by the far right to justify obstructionist, non-realistic policy positions and that has created the fiscal debacle we are still climbing out of.  That fairy tale is the market fundamentalist &#8220;pie in the sky&#8221; concept that broad economic growth can be magically generated just by letting the rich continue to get richer even if the middle class is falling into poverty and infrastructure is crumbling. </p>

<p> <a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2012/10/if-europe-adds-a-financial-transactions-tax-will-we-follow.html">If Europe Adds a Financial Transactions Tax, Will We Follow?</a></p>
<p>Has the time come for the US to impose a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_transaction_tax">financial transactions tax</a>?  It would have several positive features.  First, it would raise revenues, which are sorely needed for everything from climate change action to infrastructure improvements to aid for needy families.  Second, it would raise revenues from those who are most responsible for the financialization of the economy&#8211;investment bankers, fund managers, and high speed traders interested in bigger and bigger profits no matter the result for ordinary folks.  Third, it would act in some small way to discourage excessive trading that contributes to the volatility of the stock market. </p>
<p>Of course, such a tax (frequently called a &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobin_tax">Tobin Tax</a>&#8221; after the Nobel economist who recommended it) would be best if applied by all sophisticated nations.  It appears that the European Union is getting closer to making a financial transactions tax a reality in at least some of the participating countries.  See James Kanter, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/10/business/global/trading-tax-gets-backing-from-italy-and-spain.html">Tax on Financial Trades Gains Support in Europe</a>, New York Times (Oct. 10, 2012).  Britain will remain exempt so the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_London">City of London</a> (Europe&#8217;s parallel to Wall Street) would continue on its merry way (or even increase the financialization of the UK economy as trades moved from participating countries to London).  Wall Street has lobbied heavily against any tax on its activities, and would fight bitterly if the US were to impose such a tax while London remained exempt.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>So my guess is that even if the EU finance ministers approve the measure for some participating European nations, it will take some time before it spreads to Britain and the United States.  Like climate change, we seem determined to put off addressing real problems until they are upon us with such force that we cannot possibly continue as before.  Thus, our financialized economy rocks along pretending that derivatives are safer and banks are fine and life can go on as before, and Congress debates climate change as a &#8220;she said, he said&#8221; matter rather than looking at the breadth and depth of scientific evidence supporting man-made effects that are reshaping the globe while we watch.</p>

<p>Romney&#8217;s &#8220;revenue neutral&#8221; 20% rate cut may not be achievable, Hassett admits<br /><a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2012/09/romneys-revenue-neutral-20-rate-cut-not-achievable-hassett-admits.html"></a><br />&#8230;For months, many tax experts have been saying that even what is known about Romney&#8217;s plan&#8211;skimpy as it is on any real information&#8211;shows that it is unworkable.  One of Romney&#8217;s sometimes advisers finally sort of acknowledged that.  Kevin Hassett (an <i>American Enterprise Institute</i> propaganda tank &#8220;expert&#8221; who coughs out Friedmania economic assumptions as though they were clearly settled laws of nature) admits that unless there is a &#8220;broadening of the tax base&#8221; Romney couldn&#8217;t reduce rates by 20% across the board in a revenue-neutral way.</p>
<p>Now, &#8220;broadening of the tax base&#8221; in connection with reduced rates was possible back inn 1986 when we had maximum rates much higher than today.  But most broadening that should be done won&#8217;t be done, because there is no political will for it in Washington either because Romney won&#8217;t favor it or because the Tea Party crazies won&#8217;t.  (We won&#8217;t be eliminating the capital gains preference under a Romney administration, for example, or eliminating the tax subsidies that we give to Big Oil and other extractive industries that make oilmen billionaires&#8211;like letting them get the &#8220;domestic manufacturing deduction&#8221;, which they currently are able to use to reduce their US taxes even more.)  Hassett admitted that &#8220;if you think the base broadeners don&#8217;t add up, if you think that he can&#8217;t get [top rates down] to 28%, well then the right thing that would happen, as you know if you&#8217;re going to have revenue neutral reform, is that they would have a different change in rates.&#8221;  BNA Daily Tax RealTime (Sept 24, 2012 at 7:19 pm)&#8230;.</p>

<p>NY AG defends tax-exempt organization probe</p>
<p>After complaints from some academics about the rationale for a New York investigation of tax exempt organizations and a letter from Congressional Republicans Dave Camp (MI) and Orrin Hatch (Utah)suggesting that the New York Attorney General should not be seeking copies of federal returns from taxpayers but rather through the IRS, AG Schneiderman responded in defense of his rights to investigate based on federalism and the New York AG&#8217;s interest in state law enforcement.  See Bernie Becker, <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/on-the-money/domestic-taxes/251329-new-york-ag-defends-efforts-on-tax-exempt-groups">New York AG defends efforts on tax-exempt groups</a>, The Hill: On the Money blog (Sept. 24, 2012).</p>
<p>Schneiderman is investigating a group of tax-exempt organizations called &#8220;501(c)(4)s&#8221; after the Code section that permits them for federal income tax purposes.  Those groups are not required to reveal their donors, and are supposed to conduct social services.  Many of these groups these days are functioning as purportedly independent advertisers for political candidates and parties, funded by big donors who want to remain anonymous.</p>

<p> Romney&#8217;s Tax Views Lead to Blooper Comments Denigrating America&#8217;s Elderly and Poor</p>
<p> Most of us who follow tax issues in the news and in political campaigns are aware that GOP candidate <a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2012/08/romneys-tax-returns-what-we-do-know.html">Mitt Romney</a> has been very secretive about various items.</p>
<p>First and foremost, he has been secretive about his own extraordinary wealth:  he has refused to follow his father&#8217;s example in releasing more than a decade of tax returns and he has maintained numerous accounts offshore, including in jurisdictions that are known for banking secrecy.  This secrecy is problematic for many voters, because without those returns it is difficult to evaluate his aggressiveness in using shelters or taking controversial positions on returns to save himself tax dollars &#8211;a topic that is surely relevant to his qualification to hold the highest executive office in the land.</p>
<p>Second, he has been secretive about his plans for achieving across-the-board tax cuts of enormous benefit to the uber-rich and multinational corporations while claiming to maintain revenue neutrality.  Respected non-partisan tax analysts have concluded that his plans simply don&#8217;t add up&#8211;the &#8220;arithmetic&#8221;, as Democratic speeches noted, is against him.  When he refuses to specify just what programs he would cut while cutting taxes and increasing military expenditures, many voters are naturally suspicious that the cuts will all be taken out of the safety net&#8211;voucherization of Medicare, privatization of education funding, and even more of the deregulation that cost us so much in the 2007-8 financial crisis&#8211;while continuing the over-spending on military and various lucrative loopholes for the wealthy like the &#8220;carried interest&#8221; provision for private equity managers.</p>
<p>Third, he has been secretive about his lack of commitment to the disadvantaged in our society.  His failure to describe how he will create jobs (other than through his claim that managing vulture capital &#8220;leveraged buy-out&#8221; funds is good preparation for the presidency) suggests that he has no ideas other than the long disproven ones being pushed by the Chamber of Commerce and other business lobbying organizations&#8211;less regulation, more privatization, more reductions to earned benefits like Medicare and Social Security, and more tax provisions that favor the rich that the GOP labels&#8211;without empirical support&#8211; as the &#8220;job creators&#8221;.  But he has nonetheless tried to foster an image of caring about American people who weren&#8217;t born to the life of wealth and luxury that he&#8217;s enjoyed.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>That third point of secrecy was shattered by the revelation of a taped video of Romney comments to major donors (delivered at a May 17 fundraiser at an investment banker&#8217;s home in Boca Raton, Florida), in which Romney showed utter disdain for the large segment of the US population who ultimately do not pay any federal income taxes.  Romney called those who pay no federal income tax &#8220;dependent on government&#8221; and indicated that they see themselves as &#8220;victims&#8221;.  He concluded he&#8217;d &#8220;never convince them they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives.&#8221;</p>

<p>Romney&#8217;s 47% comment fairly drips with disdain and scorn for ordinary Americans, casting them, as the Mother Jones article cited above notes, as &#8220;a mass of shiftless moochers who don&#8217;t contribute much, if anything, to society.&#8221; David Corn, <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/09/secret-video-romney-private-fundraiser">Secret Video: Romney Tells Millionaire Donors What He REALLY Thinks of Obama Voters</a>, Mother Jones (Sept. 17, 2012).</p>
<p>It is of a par with comments by a woman that I met at a reception in Boston over the weekend, who spewed scorn as she claimed that anybody that is on welfare or getting unemployment is just a lazy bum that wants the rest of us to hand them a living on a silver platter.  Romney&#8217;s and the woman&#8217;s comments both show absolute insularity from the real world of povery and near-poverty in America in the aftermath of Bush&#8217;s Great Recession, when able-bodied men despair of their situation in being unable to find a job, any job, and young folks grow hopeless as they fill in application after application.  Without government programs to fill in the gaps for these groups, their lives would be truly desperate.  Their non-taxpayer situation has nothing to do with lack of personal responsibility and everything to do with a society in which the economy for too long has favored the uberrich at the cost of ordinary Americans.</p>
<p>Remember that the federal income tax is specifically designed to protect taxpayers in the lower income distributions from paying federal income tax through the use of the standard deduction and personal exemptions.   That&#8217;s because Congress has always assumed that there should be a minimum below which the federal income tax does not reach.  And Congress has enacted a number of other exclusions and credits designed to ensure that the federal income tax doesn&#8217;t fall too heavily on the more vulnerable amongst us.  <br />
<blockquote>About half of those [46% of households] did&#8217;t pay [federal income taxes] because of standard deductions and personal exemptions designed to exclude subsistence levels of income from taxation.  The rest received tax breaks, including the earned income tax credit, the child tax credit and tax benefits for older Americans such as the exclusion of Social Security benefits from income.&#8221;  Richard Rubin,<a href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-09-18/romney-s-47-percent-with-no-taxes-include-elderly-poor-workers">Romney&#8217;s 47% With Not Taxes Combines Elderly with Poor Workers</a>, Bloomberg Businessweek (Sept. 18, 2012). </p></blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, most taxpayers who pay no federal income tax do pay other taxes:  state and local income, property and sales taxes eat up a substantial amount of income, as do federal payroll taxes, which often amount to the most significant tax bite for these lower-income taxpayers.  And as the Rubin article also notes, people who don&#8217;t pay income tax one year&#8211;because of returning for education, job losses, extraordinary medical expenses and other causes&#8211;come back on the tax rolls in later years when they finish studies or find work.</p>
<p>Regrettably, Romney&#8217;s remarks at the fundraiser mainly reveal an eager player in the class warfare game that the right has engaged in for the last few decades&#8211;it reflects a firm support for tax policies that redistribute upwards to the elite, at whatever cost to ordinary Americans who are disdained and even despised as irresponsible and lazy.  With CEOs making 200-400 times what their average workers make and the productivity gains contributed most especially by the workers being siphoned off for increasingly higher pay for the executives, ordinary Americans already are hurting.  Tax policies that continue the rip-off by continuing preferential rates for capital gains, providing even more preferential marginal rates for the uberrich, and eliminating worldwide taxation on multinationals will do even greater harm to ordinary Americans and the sustainability of our economy.</p>

<p>Whistleblower gets millions: good for compliance improvement (and makes us ask again&#8211;did Romney get amnesty?)</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Birkenfeld">Bradley Birkenfeld</a>, the UBS whistleblower who helped jumpstart the IRS&#8217;s enforcement of foreign bank account reporting and helped catch criminal tax evaders, ended up serving a relatively short prison term (for failure to be entirely forthcoming, in the case of one of UBS&#8217;s private banking customers) but also go a significant $104 million whistleblower award.  See David Kocieniewski, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/12/business/whistle-blower-awarded-104-million-by-irs.html">Whistle-Blower awarded $104 Million by I.R.S</a>., New York Times (Sept. 11, 2012); <a href="http://www.democracynow.org/2012/9/12/whistleblower_brad_birkenfeld_rewarded_record_104m">Whistleblower Brad Birkenfeld Rewarded Record $104M for Exposing How UBS Helped Rich Evade Taxes</a>, DemocracyNow.org (video available); <a href="http://www.democracynow.org/2012/7/31/exhaustive_study_finds_global_elite_hiding">Exhaustive Study Finds Global Elite Hiding Up to $32 Trillion in Offshore Accounts</a>, DemocracyNow.org (July 12, 2012) (video or transcript available); <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/schumpeter/2012/09/whistleblowing">Birkenfeld&#8217;s bonanza</a>, The Economist (Sept. 11, 2012).</p>
<p>As Birkenfeld&#8217;s attorney put it:<br />
<blockquote>“Today is a great day for all the honest Americans out there who work their job and pay their taxes. Today is a great day for tax fairness. Today is a terrible day for big-time tax cheats.”  <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/schumpeter/2012/09/whistleblowing">Birkenfeld&#8217;s bonanza</a>, The Economist (Sept. 11, 2012).</p></blockquote>
<p>The very public and very large whistleblower award should do two things:</p>
<p>1) encourage other insiders who are aware of egregious company or individual tax-evading behavior to blow the whistle and</p>
<p>2) discourage other insiders and companies from egregious company or individual tax evading behavior.<br />There have always been anonymous brown-envelope tips to the IRS from those who know what is going on but don&#8217;t want to participate in it and don&#8217;t want their competitors to gain a competitive advantage because they do.  But whistleblowers generally have access to inside information that can break the dam on enforcement.  That certainly was the case with Birkenfeld, whose information&#8211; about smuggling diamonds for UBS&#8217;s private banking clients and other means taken to help such clients avoid reporting their assets to the US government&#8211;was instrumental in increasing awareness about tax crimes and increasing the fear of God (or rather, the fear of the &#8220;revenuer&#8221;) in sophisticated, wealthy taxpayers who had been able to hide some of their assets and wealth relatively easily before.</p>
<p><em>By the way&#8211;we still do not know whether GOP presidential candidate <a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2012/07/whats-romney-got-to-hide-part-ii.html">Mitt Romney</a> participated in the amnesty program that was introduced in the wake of the UBS exposure of banking secrecy&#8217;s connection to tax evasion by wealthy Americans.  As most Americans know by now, Romney refuses to release his tax returns for the relevant years when he might have participated in the amnesty program to avoid criminal prosecution. </em><br /><em></em><br /><a name="more"></a><em><br /></em><br /><em> Until he does release his returns back to 2003 o4 so, there will continue to be questions regarding his taxes, as the wealthiest nominee ever with offshore holdings galore and his sole business experience being a hedge fund with numerous offshore entities and blocker corporations.  Specifically, Americans will wonder how his self-proclaimed patriotism and love of nation plays out in his ordinary decisions.  His hedge fund, Bain Capital, has also made the news as a participant in a claimed conspiracy of hedge funds to deflate the prices they pay for companies they acquire.  See Lichtblau &#038; Lattman, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/12/business/documents-depict-equity-firms-like-bain-as-colluding.html?pagewanted=all">Equity Firms Like Bain Are Depicted as Colluding</a>, New York Times (Sept. 11, 2012).   </em><br /><em><br /></em><em>Both tax evasion and price-rigging are criminal activities, so it behooves Romney to release his returns and ancillary information so Americans can assess how he practices what he preaches in terms of love of country and rule of law.  Did he report his foreign assets as required all along?  Did he invest abroad (so that any purported &#8220;job creation&#8221; activity didn&#8217;t benefit us)?  Was he still influential in Bain during the period that it began, or carried on, price-fixing agreements with other powerful hedge funds?  Americans deserve to know.</em><br /><em><br /></em>Will this lead to better compliance in the future?  One suspects that there will always be those who enjoy the game of avoiding taxes so much that they will be willing to pay to play the tax evasion games even on the harder-to-manipulate playing field created by the crackdown on banking secrecy and offshoring of funds.  But hopefully they will be fewer, and less successful! </p>

<p>Corporate taxes used to constitute a significant portion of federal revenues, almost a third in 1950.  Payroll taxes from workers were considerably less&#8211;around 10% in 1950.  Andrew Leonard, <a href="http://www.salon.com/2012/08/28/who_really_pays_taxes/">Who Really Pays Taxes?</a> Salon.com (Aug. 28, 2012).<br />The times have changed.  Corporate taxes have declined steeply in the 21st century as a percent of GDP, while <a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2012/07/tax-policy-center-on-cutting-tax-preferences-to-lower-tax-rates-aka-romneys-plan.html">payroll taxes</a> paid by workers have become a significant part of tax revenues&#8211;more than a third in 2007.</p>
<p>That is one cause of the inordinate inequality of income and wealth that this country now endures&#8211;an inequality that has dire consequences for the economy and for the well-being or the vast majority of ordinary Americans.</p>

<p> RS goofing on foreign trust letters, says AICPA</p>
<p> The American Institute of CPAs (AICPA) is asking the IRS Commissioner to resolve what it suggests is a &#8220;widespread problem&#8221; for taxpayers.  <a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/files/aicpa-letter-to-irs-on-erroneous-form-3520-letters-to-taxapyers.082812.pdf">Download AICPA Letter to IRS on Erroneous Form 3520 Letters to Taxapyers.082812</a>.   For 2010 and earlier years, the IRS apparently has made a wide range of systemic mistakes in processing the form required to be filed annually by owners of a foreign trust&#8211;<a href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f3520.pdf">Forms 3520</a>, the Annual Return to Report Transactions with Foreign Trusts and REceipt of Certain Foreign Gifts.<br />  The AICPA reports errors including:
<ul>
<li>instructions to fill out Part II about ownership of a foreign trust, when the taxpayer is not the owner of a foreign grantor trust; </li>
<li>instructions to provide additional information required when a taxpayer answers a question &#8220;yes&#8221; when the question on the form was answered &#8220;no&#8221;; </li>
<li>instructions to provide identifying information required to be submitted when the information was already submitted; and </li>
<li>insturctions to provide an explanatory statementwhen such statement was already submitted.</li>
</ul>
<p>This looks like one of those kinds of things that happen when staffing at a government agency is reduced beyond what is reasonable for the kinds of tasks that have to be carried out. </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Query&#8211;isn&#8217;t it likely that the right&#8217;s  (and now officially the GOP&#8217;s) drive to reduce staffing at all levels of government agencies (except, of course, for the right&#8217;s pet project, expansion of the military) likely to increase the headaches for ordinary citizens because those government agencies simply won&#8217;t be able to get their jobs done well with the reduced staffing and morale problems that will cause?</p>

<p> Dow Jones video admits there&#8217;s not much other than anecdotal tales that even millionaires readily move from one state to another to avoid taxes</p>
<p> OK.  Admittedly long title.  But you get the point.  The anti-tax gurus are forever saying that states (and countries) can&#8217;t increase taxes from our historically very low point because those that would pay them are the rich and the rich have the means of moving away. </p>
<p>But do they?  There are lots of things that come into whether one is willing to move or not&#8211;from weather to family to friends to business to custom to, yes maybe, taxes.   So if a gazillioinaire moves to another state and then is asked&#8211;did you do it to save on taxes?, he might say yes (he knows his views may influence policy inordinately) but it might not even have been a factor or it might have been a minor factor or it might even in unusual circumstances have been the primary factor.</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s good to see a Dow Jones/Wall Street Journal video that admits that is the case.  Not unsurprisingly (since it is, after all, a Wall Street Journal video) the title is &#8220;<a href="http://live.wsj.com/video/millionaires-fleeing-taxes/1218E40B-562E-4378-A0C7-D8107F4D24E1.html#!1218E40B-562E-4378-A0C7-D8107F4D24E1">millionaires fleeing taxes</a>&#8221; (Aug. 27, 2012), and the blurb underneath states (as though it were fact) &#8220;when states raise taxes, millionaires move out&#8221;.  <strong>But that isn&#8217;t really what the video interview says</strong>.</p>
<p>The video admits that there are no good studies that show that millionaires actually move from one state to another because of tax increases.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Yeah, elderly wealthy move to Florida, but that isn&#8217;t necessarily to avoid taxes and in fact may well not be related to taxes at all.  Yeah, there are anecdotal stories that people move because of taxes, but there&#8217;s no real proof.  The video acknowledges that there are many other reasons for choosing where to have one&#8217;s primary residence, and that manipulation of residence can create problems.  As the video says, &#8220;You can show residency in a state by living there a certain amount of time. &#8230;. You have to be very very careful, though.  States are being very aggressive about collecting from everybody and determining who actually lives there.&#8221;</p>

                                <div>Peter J. Henning, a colleague of Linda Beale, poses the question in the NYT:</div>
<p><a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2012/08/13/is-that-it-for-financial-crisis-cases/?nl=business&#038;emc=edit_dlbkpm_20120813%22%3EIs%20That%20It%20for%20Financial%20Crisis%20Cases?">Is That It for Financial Crisis Cases?</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Last week turned out to be a good one for <a href="http://dealbook.on.nytimes.com/public/overview?symbol=GS&#038;inline=nyt-org">Goldman Sachs</a>. The Justice Department closed a criminal investigation of the firm and its chief executive, <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/b/lloyd_c_blankfein/index.html?inline=nyt-per">Lloyd C. Blankfein</a>, and the firm disclosed that the <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/s/securities_and_exchange_commission/index.html?inline=nyt-org">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> had decided not to pursue a civil fraud case related to a subprime mortgage deal.<br />When the story of the financial crisis is finally written, this may turn out to be the denouement of the government’s investigations of Wall Street for potential wrongdoing that contributed to the financial crisis in 2008.<br />…<br />Investment banks like Goldman load their disclosure documents with plenty of generic disclaimers that can support a defense that no one sought to mislead buyers. It may not be so much a matter of weak laws as the requirement to show beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant had the intent to commit a crime, a significant barrier to successfully prosecuting any fraud case.<br />And proving a perjury case is even more difficult because it must be shown that the defendant intentionally lied, not just that the testimony was incomplete or inaccurate. Whether Goldman’s position was “massive” or not looks to be a matter of degree, making it almost impossible to prove perjury.</p></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>The S.E.C.’s decision was a bit more surprising because the enforcement division told Goldman in February that it planned to recommend civil charges against the firm related to its sale of a $1.3 billion mortgage-backed security. Goldman had already settled allegations in 2010 about how it structured a <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/c/collateralized-debt-obligations/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier">collateralized debt obligation</a> known as Abacus, so even if the S.E.C. had pursued another case, it was unlikely to contain any major new revelations about systemic misconduct.</p></blockquote>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<blockquote><p>…<br />It does not look as if any other criminal cases against other banks are likely to emerge from the financial crisis now that four years have gone by. The Justice Department has already passed on cases against executives from firms like <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/countrywide_financial_corporation/index.html?inline=nyt-org">Countrywide Financial</a>and the <a href="http://dealbook.on.nytimes.com/public/overview?symbol=AIG&#038;inline=nyt-org">American International Group</a>, and nothing else seems to be drawing the attention of prosecutors at this point.<br />…<br />New laws would not make it any more likely that senior executives could be pursued unless they included liability as a “responsible corporate officer” for the conduct of underlings without having to prove an executive’s knowledge or recklessness.<br />Wall Street would be sure to put up quite a fight if expansive criminal prohibitions were introduced that made it easier to prosecute senior managers for the violations of lower-level employees. The pushback in Congress against the Dodd-Frank Act’s regulation of the financial sector shows that there may not be much appetite for additional government involvement in the financial sector.</p></blockquote>
