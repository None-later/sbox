<p>American Enterprise Institute&#8217;s Arthur Brooks on budgets and taxes</p>
<p>  Arthur Brooks of the American Heritage Institute had an op-ed in Friday&#8217;s Wall Street Journal, &#8220;<a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204880404577229220571408412.html">Obama&#8217;s Budget Flunks the Marshmallow Test</a>&#8221; (Feb. 24, 2012), at A13, in which he claimed that &#8220;unfunded entitlements to the middle class, runaway deficits to be repaid in the undefined future, and immense tax increases on the entrepreneurial class&#8221; meant that the Obama budget proposal would damage national prosperity and even worse, harm &#8220;our national character&#8221;.</p>
<p>He spends a lot of the op-ed talking about experiments that showed that youngsters who were able to defer gratification tended to be more successful in life (higher SAT scores, finishing college, more money, etc.) He suggests that the &#8220;national character&#8221; problem is that we have too many people who think the government should &#8220;shove marshmallows in our collective mouths&#8221; and &#8220;protect[] us from the consequences of our actions.&#8221; The implication, of course, is that anyone receiving Social Security and Medicare is harmed by those &#8220;entitlements&#8221; and being moved &#8220;away from the national entrepreneurial ethos, teaching dependency and changing our relationship to the state.&#8221;</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />This is the typical right-wing argument that the safety net is really harmful to people and we&#8217;d all be better off returning to the turn of the 18th century when people had to pull themselves up by their own bootstraps and government policy was intended oh so clearly to benefit the wealthy class. By &#8220;unfunded entitlements&#8221; one assumes that he means to refer to Social Security, Medicare, unemployment benefits and other measures that we have decided as a society make sense. Social Security, of course, is not &#8220;unfunded&#8221;&#8211;we committed to funding it, and therefore borrowed the funds paid into it by workers. We are morally obligated to tax ourselves to pay the pensions we have promised. Brooks (like the GOP and its other &#8220;think tank&#8221; friends) apparently wants citizens to overlook the moral obligations to those who worked hard all of their lives and paid into Social Security and Medicare and blame the recipients for being unable to defer gratification. <br />Meanwhile, we are supposed to overlook the subsidies &#8211;from the mortgage interest deduction to the charitable contribution deduction for phantom gain we&#8217;ve never paid tax on to the preferential rates for unearned income&#8211;and pity the upper crust that bears the &#8220;immense tax increases on the entrepreneurial class.&#8221; </p>
<p>But this is wrong twice. First, the Obama proposals are not &#8220;immense tax increases&#8221;. They are in fact mostly just allowing the law as written to come into place, rather than continuing extensions of the &#8220;temporary&#8221; tax cuts installed in the Bush era . As a result of letting the 2001-2003 Bush cuts finally lapse for this high-income group as currently slated to do, we would have a very modest and reasonable restoration of some of the tax rates that existed for the upper crust, a group that has profited enormously from tax policies of the last decades that have favored their type of income over the type of income that the vast majority of working Americans receives.</p>
<p> Second, these upper crust elites are not an &#8220;entrepreneurial class&#8221;. A few of them are, and so are some of the poor. When a private equity fund attacks a stable, profitable but not exciting company, leverages it highly, rakes off the borrowed funds as rentier profits, then splits up the company, firing workers, sending it into bankruptcy to break up the union, and walks away, that is not being entrepreneurial. It is being exploitative in ways that destroy communities and companies that provided steady employment. When the upper crust buys and sells shares on the market, they are not being entrepreneurial&#8211;they are just engaging in trades of shares. When the wealthy live on the income from their wealth and buy expensive baubles and paintings and names on opera houses, they are not being entrepreneurial, they are just consuming the income from their wealth. Even on those rare occasions when the wealthy invest some of their excess income (and the top 1% has lots of that) directly in a business, they are as likely to (more likely to?) do that in Singapore as in the United States. </p>
<p>And all the while Brooks complains about letting the sunset on the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy tax place as scheduled (just returning us to more or less the reasonable tax rates on the upper class that existed before Bush), he bitches about the deficit. This is the typical right-wing rant. Only cutting earned benefits is viewed as a reasonable way to attack the deficit&#8211;and the right tends to cast the recipients of earned benefits as undeserving, as lacking in moral fiber, as Brooks does here. Letting taxes on the upper crust return to something like (but still less than) the taxes in 2001 before the Bush tax cuts is treated as horrible&#8211;even though there&#8217;s no foundation for claiming that it damages prosperity, much less interferes with real entrepreneurial activity.</p>
<p>The deficit is, ultimately, a real problem. We should think about how to address it long-term and begin to take action to do so. For starters, we should consider how to rejuvenate the US domestic manufacturing sector so that we import less from China and India and export more to them. We should create more government incentives for, and provide more startup funding to, intracity and intercity rail systems, to bring the US into the twenty-first century in public transportation. We should take more steps towards a solvent health-care system, instead of continuing to add on the rentier profits of the insurance companies to the rentier profits of the for-profit hospitals and the exorbitant pay of the MDs. Moving towards a single-payer system should be the first item on the agenda of every person who seriously raises concerns about the deficit. We should cut our military spending starkly in a measured, long-term fashion&#8211;not just reduce the annual increases to the budget. We should increase taxes on multinational corporations that have been raking in profits but paying almost no taxes for the last decade. And we should tax the wealthy on their unearned income (and their earned income) at least at the same rates that we tax the rest of us&#8211;i.e., we should eliminate the preferential rate for unearned income and the absurd &#8220;carried interest&#8221; provision that allows private equity managers to pay taxes at half the rate that ordinary workers pay on their compensation.</p>
<p>When Brooks supports removing the instant gratification giveaways (like accelerated depreciation and expensing in the corporate tax code and preferential rates for unearned income and the charitable deduction for value rather than investment in individual tax provisions) that are overly generous to Big Business and the wealthy, then he can come back and we can talk about what further should be done to set the country on a surer national footing.</p>

<p>Obama proposes to exempt some IRS spending on enforcement from budget cap</p>
<p>  The 2011 debt ceiling compromise, known as the Budget Control Act, establishes automatic cuts in spending for various categories if no further deal is reached to overturn them. <br />In many ways, it might be ideal to allow the Budget Control Act to come into play. It would force significant reductions in the overall amount allocated to Defense, an area that has fed incessantly on revenues since Reagan&#8217;s priority on militarization, coupled with Bush II&#8217;s preemptive wars of choice in Afghanistan and Iraq. We need to cut military spending significantly, and it will not hurt the country&#8217;s defense to do so. (It may, however, crimp the high-flying styles of some military contractors. About time, I&#8217;d say.) </p>
<p>Further, the Budget Control Act explicitly protects Social Security and Medicare, so those programs won&#8217;t be curtailed in the process. A good thing, again, since it is important for the nation to see that the fearmongering about Social Security as &#8220;insolvent&#8221; is just that. <br />But there&#8217;s at least one category of spending that an across-the-board cut makes little sense for&#8211;the spending necessary to collect tax from deadbeat/scofflaw or criminal taxpayers. The IRS enforcement budget essentially is an investment in better tax compliance, and returns more dollars to the federal fisc than it takes out. </p>
<p>Obama has recognized that, and seeks to exempt $277 million of the IRS enforcement spending from the Budget Control Act&#8217;s cuts. See the discussion <a href="http://www.ombwatch.org/node/11986/">here</a> at OMB Watch (Vol. 13, No. 4, Feb. 22, 2012).<br />
<blockquote>One of the main objectives of President Obama’s fiscal year (FY) 2013 budget request for the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is to reduce the &#8220;tax gap,&#8221; the difference between what taxpayers owe each year and what they actually pay. The <a href="http://community.ombwatch.org/site/R?i=AlaqEcDW7F6qTAOk_XJm_w">president’s IRS budget request</a> seeks funding increases for both taxpayer services and enforcement programs. Recognizing that a dollar spent on collecting revenue more than pays for itself, the Obama administration has proposed to exclude some IRS enforcement spending from the budget caps imposed by 2011&#8217;s debt ceiling deal (known as the <a href="http://community.ombwatch.org/site/R?i=haw2QOAnqOZ491FSd5aYWA">Budget Control Act</a>). <br />***<br />Among the enforcement programs the White House is recommending be increased to raise revenues <a href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/newsroom/budget-in-brief-fy2013.pdf">are</a>:
<ul>
<li>An additional $111 million to fight <a href="http://www.ombwatch.org/node/10324">offshore tax evasion</a>, which the IRS estimates will bring in $6.40 for every dollar invested by FY 2015 </li>
<li>An increase of $39 million to improve international businesses’ compliance with the tax code &#8230;. The IRS estimates a return on investment of $8.80 per dollar invested </li>
<li>An additional $129 million to implement recent legislative tax changes, including new reporting requirements and certain provisions of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which the IRS estimates will bring in $3.50 for every dollar invested </li>
<li>An increase of $88 million to implement the “Revenue Protection Strategy,” which allows the IRS to adjust a taxpayer&#8217;s refund if examiners catch errors. The IRS estimates this initiative will return $1.90 per dollar invested as soon as new hires reach their full potential in FY 2015 </li>
<li>An additional $35 million to <a href="http://www.ombwatch.org/node/10677">continue certifying tax preparers</a>, which the IRS estimates will bring in $2.30 for every dollar invested by FY 2015 </li>
</ul>
<p>The IRS estimates that combined, these funding increases will bring in an additional $673 billion in FY 2013 alone, and, by FY 2015, an estimated $1.5 trillion in additional annual revenue.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sounds reasonable. The Bush effort to cut back on IRS funding was a naked gambit for a weakened watchdog that would allow more corporate tax evasion. Enforcement has paid off considerably over the past two years, as the IRS&#8217;s effort to unveil offshore bank accounts of US taxpayers has led to significant numbers of taxpayers brining those assets back onto the tax rolls. Congress should recognize the reasonableness of this request, unless it is so besotted with campaign fever that it is willing to sacrifice sound legislation to ideological obstructionism.</p>

<p><a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2012/02/gop-candidates-increase-debt-across-the-board.html">GOP candidates&#8217; policies would raise federal debt by whopping trillions</a> </p>
<p>The GOP likes to pretend to take the high road, proclaiming itself to be against increasing the federal debt, running big deficits, or otherwise not running our government like a person runs their household. Pundits on the right tend to look at Greece and warn&#8211;watch out, America, you&#8217;re gonna be there next.</p>
<p>Of course, there&#8217;s a big difference in a family on a limited budget and the federal government. The government can print money to pay its bills; when people do that, it&#8217;s called counterfeiting. The amount of quantitative easing is limited, though where the limits are difficult to establish with any certainty&#8211;at some point. And there&#8217;s a big difference between the US and Greece. Unlike Greece, we have a sovereign money supply (Greece is tied to the European Union, unless it decides to break away and suffer the consequences). And unlike Greece, though our debt is high, it is still only about 70% of GDP. And lucky for us, the foreign nations who buy our debt need somewhere to put all those dollars that they&#8217;ve acquired through their cheap exports to us.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s another big difference between the US and Greece. We have a long history of a stable and workable tax system&#8211;in spite of the frequent tinkering that Congress has done over the years. We have at times had politicians in office who recognize their responsibilities to the system and enact new tax laws, in spite of the intense lobbying by Big Business and wealthy interests to try to derail all tax increases. We can and should increase taxes now, especially on those most able to pay.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />So is that what the GOP candidates are proposing, after all their whining about how Democrats are fiscally irresponsible and blaming Obama for increasing our debt load? Nope, not at all. Except for Ron Paul, who wants to harshly cut every government activity, the rest of the GOP candidates have enormous tax cuts and middling spending cuts (mostly to programs that benefit ordinary Americans) and would add to the deficit by trillions of dollars, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. See <a href="http://crfb.org/document/primary-numbers-gop-candidates-and-national-debt">Primary Numbers: The GOP Canddiates and the National Debt </a>(Feb. 24, 2012). Gingrich would have the biggest increase&#8211;about $7 trillion in new debt over a two-term presidency. Santorum would increase the debt by about $4.5 trillion, and Romney would increase it by about $2.6 trillion (unless he really comes up with some offsets as promised). All three of them are likely depending on the laughable Laffer Curve idea to help them achieve their promises&#8211;the assumption that their tax cuts for the wealthy would result in more growth and therefore more tax revenues.</p>

<p><a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2012/02/romneys-association-with-corporate-tax-shelter-schemes.html">Romney&#8217;s association with corporate tax shelter schemes</a>  </p>
<p>Bloomberg&#8217;s Jesse Drucker has been doing some research into presidential candidate Mitt Romney and come up with some interesting information&#8211;at least for those of us who find corporate involvement in aggressive tax shelter phantom loss generating schemes a worrisome problem. See Drucker, <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-02-22/romney-as-auditing-chairman-saw-marriott-son-of-boss-tax-shelter-defy-irs.html">Romney as Audit Chair Saw Marriott Son of Boss Shelter Defy IRS</a>, Bloomberg.com (Feb. 22, 2012).</p>
<p>Mitt Romney has been on the board of Marriott INternational Inc. on and off since 1993, and has served as chair of the audit committee for 6 years. During that period, the company has used aggressive tax avoidance deals, including (i) the &#8220;Son of BOSS&#8221; tax shelter structure for generating artificial losses that could be used to offset gains from other sources, thus reducing taxable income and tax liabilities and (ii) shifting profits to a Luxembourg shell company. Marriott&#8217;s effective tax rate has been as low as 6.8%, even though the federal statutory rate for corporations is 35%.<br />These factoids demonstrate two things.</p>
<p><strong>First</strong>,<strong> as the Bloomberg.com article points out, Romney claims that his business experience is the primary reason that Americans should want to see him in the White House. Contrary to his claim, it seems to me that the more we hear about his business experience the less I think he is suited to the White House. </strong></p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>At Bain Capital, as at most private equity firms, Romney was willing to reap millions from taking a stable, operating company and turning it into a bankrupt by leveraging it up, firing employees, and otherwise destroying the stable business. Yeah, sometimes the &#8220;creative destruction&#8221; worked and the company exited making profits. But often it didn&#8217;t, and the company wasn&#8217;t a loser until Bain Capital got hold of it. Further, Romney doesn&#8217;t appear to have developed much of a sense of corporate social responsibility through his &#8220;earning&#8221; of multi-millions taxed at low rate through Bain Capital. So he didn&#8217;t see anything amiss in the very aggressive tax planning engaged in by Marriott when he served as a Marriott director with oversight responsibility&#8211;of which he certainly knew, as head of the audit committee. Even John McCain was aghast at Marriott&#8217;s wanton use of tax shelters, when he complained about the federal tax credits Marriott claimed in an accidental loophole in the law on synthetic fuels. As the piece notes, McCain called Marriott&#8217;s use of this loophole to claim the credits an &#8220;expensive hoax&#8221; or &#8220;scam.&#8221; </p>
<p>Do we want as president a man who thinks it is okay for taxpayers to gin up artificial losses to reduce their tax liability or use provisions of the Code in ways that clearly go against their underlying purpose to get an unintended subsidy from the Federal government? I don&#8217;t think so. Such a person would likely be quite willing to see further cuts to the corporate taxes and taxes on the wealthy, no matter what that does to the federal fisc. And Romney has certainly demonstrated his willingness to cut taxes even in the face of deficit claims that are being used to demand privatization of Social Security and cuts to Medicare. (See his plan for a 25% corporate rate, a zero percent estate tax, a lower top rate on earned income for the wealthy, and other items.) </p>
<p>I want a president who considers that every taxpayer has an obligation to the integrity of the system, and who would not look kindly on businesses that engage in aggressive tax minimization transactions that don&#8217;t hold up to the laugh test.</p>
<p><strong>Second, major corporations aren&#8217;t paying enough&#8211;much less too much &#8211;in taxes these days. </strong>We have a statutory rate of 35%, but most very profitable corporations end up paying very little in taxes, through a combination of excessive loopholes built into the Code by their accommodating buddies in Congress (quid pro quo for campaign contributions or, after Citizens United, &#8220;independent&#8221; super-PAC donations?) and outright tax sheltering through aggressive customized transactions intended to generate tax benefits. </p>
<p>Why in the world would anybody in his/her right mind propose cutting the corporate tax rate in this context of minimal tax payments by corporations? Makes no sense at all. Get rid of the loopholes. Bear down with enforcement clout on the phony tax-loss shelters. But don&#8217;t cut the corporate tax rate. There&#8217;s absolutely no substance to the constant whine we hear from corporate lobbyists that the corporate tax code is &#8220;too complex&#8221; (my JD students in corporate tax are quite capable of understanding it, so I am sure Corporate Tax Counsel are, too); or that the corporate tax code is &#8220;anticompetitive&#8221; (Marriott is making a fine rate of return); or that the corporate tax code is &#8220;preventing investments&#8221; (corporations have lots of cash floating around&#8211;if they want to make expansion investments, they can do so already).</p>
<p>Tax policy should be based on reasonable considerations of efficiency and simplicity, not exorbitant and unfounded claims of how the tax code is wrecking business. But even more importantly, tax policy should be based on fairness considerations. And Romney hasn&#8217;t shown much understanding of what fairness is, or how to make the tax code fairer rather than even more of a government program for redistribution upwards.</p>

<p>A story in the Boston Globe by Britt Peterson on Feb. 19, 2012 explored &#8220;<a href="http://articles.boston.com/2012-02-19/ideas/31074206_1_politicians-money-wealth">Why it matters that our politicians are rich</a>&#8221; (available here on Boston.com). A key point&#8211;the four remaining GOP presidential candidates all are millionaires, with most making more than a million a year and worth multiple millions, while the median net worth of members of Congress is &#8220;$913,000, compared with $100,000 for the rest of us.&#8221; Id. That should worry us because, as the article reports, studies have shown that rich people become  more focused on their own well-being, less empathetic with the suffering of others, more likely to view their own wealth as due to merit (and others&#8217; lack thereof to reflect lack of merit), and ultimately to make them &#8220;more callous, self-absorbed, and self-justifying than the people they represent.&#8221; Id.<br />
<blockquote>In 2009, Michael Kraus, Paul Piff, and Dacher Keltner, all then of Berkeley (Kraus is now at University of California, San Francisco), published research that divided up sample groups by family income as well as self-reported socioeconomic status. People of higher socioeconomic status were more likely to explain success or failure as a result of individual merit or fault; lower-class people, on the other hand, felt less control in their own lives and were more likely to blame events on circumstance. In other words, higher-status people were more likely to feel that they’d earned their high place in society, and that poorer people hadn’t. <br />***</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />More recently, similar research—involving not just surveys, but heart-rate measurements —has found that higher-status people tend to be less compassionate toward others in a bad situation than people of lower-class backgrounds.<br />***<br />The result of these differences, say researchers who work on money and social class, is that people who are confident in their status have a completely different worldview from those who lack that confidence: more self-involved, self-justifying, and even, as the dehumanization study suggests, crueler. And the higher up the spectrum you get, the stronger the effect . . ..<br />***<br />Power itself can trigger similar changes. . . . Gaining a sense of power, then, even if it happens through random selection in a lab, alters you on a very basic level, making you “less attentive to others, more free to act, and more free to act in a way that doesn’t take account of other people,” said Adam Galinsky, a psychologist at Northwestern’s Kellogg School of Management who has been studying the effects of power for a decade. Id.</p></blockquote>
<p>That sense of personal merit (and lack of responsibility in others) can lead to disastrous policy choices. The &#8220;ownership society/personal responsibility&#8221; mantra of the Bush presidency justified heaping tax breaks on large corporations and their owners/investors at the top of the income distribution while preaching deunionization, privatization, and safety net withdrawal. It permitted a method of bailing out &#8220;too big to fail&#8221; banks from the financial crisis they caused by profiting immensely from risky speculation (made possible by deregulation) in ways that didn&#8217;t require a clawback of the rentier profits received by the &#8220;ownership class,&#8221; resulting in privatization of gains/socialization of losses. In essence, the &#8220;ownership society/personal responsibility&#8221; mantra provides justification for class warfare on the middle class and poor who happen not to be as well-off as the rich.</p>
<p>Similarly, Congress&#8217; inability to empathize with ordinary Americans has led to significant numbers of Congresspeople (particularly members of the GOP) who support privatization of Social Security, reduction of benefits under Medicaid and Medicare and unemployment insurance at the same time that they continue to argue for zero taxation on the unearned income of the rich. And each of the GOP presidential candidates reflects that overarching goal of reducing taxes on the ownership class. See, e.g., Gingrich&#8217;s &#8220;optional 15% flat tax&#8221; (zero tax on unearned income); Cain&#8217;s 999 transitioning to a national retail sales tax proposal (a flat consumption tax that would be heavily regressive and leave rentier profits of the wealthiest essentially untaxed); Santorum&#8217;s tax proposals (even less protective of the poor than Gingrich&#8217;s), Romney&#8217;s tax proposals (including zero taxation of estates, extraordinarily low taxation of corporations, etc.). Rather than supporting a repeal of the &#8220;carried interest&#8221; loophole that allows private equity fund managers like Romney pay ridiculously low tax rates on their very high compensation income, these candidates and politicians support continuing the tax policies of redistribution upwards that have led to the decline of the middle class as the &#8220;ownership class&#8221; gathers for itself all the productivity gains of the economic system.<br />crossposted with <a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/">ataxingmatter</a></p>

The article notes a fatal flaw in the disclosure requirements&#8211;no one has to reveal the actual insurance premium.</p>
<blockquote><p>But insurers and employers do <em>not</em> have to tell consumers how much a policy costs—in other words, no premium information has to be given. Yep, that’s right—the key piece of information needed to make a good decision is missing. When insurers design a policy, they consider the interplay of coinsurance, copays, deductibles, coverage, and, of course, the premium, which lets them know what price point will make a consumer say “yes.” Price is the bottom line for consumers, but it’s poison for sellers, who fear a shopper might choose a policy with a lower price, other things being equal. So much for that price competition that was to solve all the ills of U.S. health care.<br />***<br />Jost told me “premium disclosure is not required by statute.” Chalk that up to clever bill drafting. The administration was trying to add it to the proposed regulations circulated months ago, but Jost said “plans and employers pushed back. It was one place to give.” HHS official Steve Larsen did his media walk-back. “People have premium information. They will have that. The goal of this provision was to focus on coverage, benefits and how they interact,” he said.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>The relation between high college tuition and low state funding of higher ed: the right&#8217;s austerity agenda</strong><br />  <br />As certainly everyone should be aware by now (after almost 20 Republican candidate debates and months of negative campaign ads), the GOP candidates all think that we need to prescribe an austerity budget for state and federal governments. &#8220;Too much spending&#8221; they yell. &#8220;Too high taxes&#8221;, they scream. &#8220;It makes our big corporations uncompetitive&#8221;, they whine. &#8220;We need to break the backs of unions so public workers are as poor as workers in private industry, but still give tax cuts to the wealthy&#8221;, they assert, &#8220;so jobs can trickle down to the poor&#8221;. See, e.g., Arthur B. Laffer (yes, he of the laughingstock napkin-drawn Laffer &#8220;curve&#8221; projecting his view that cutting revenues from taxes increases revenues), &#8220;<a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203711104577201391354733460.html">The States are leading a pro-growth rebellion</a>,&#8221; Wall St. Journal, Feb. 11-12, 2012, at A11 (lauding the move to <strong>free-rider states</strong>, where stingy workers can get the benefits from the results of collective bargaining agreements without paying for the costs of supporting the union that got those benefits from them, thus starving and &#8220;busting&#8221; the union; gloating over the fact that California didn&#8217;t adequately fund its state workers&#8217; retirement plans and that the anti-tax movement will keep it from doing so now).<br />That&#8217;s a prescription for disaster. <br /><a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/"></a><br />What our representatives in Congress need to do is look around them&#8211;preferably after driving at least 100 miles outside of the insulated Beltway and seeing some of the real country and its people. </p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />We need federal programs that ensure a minimum standard of living for our people. We need a universal, &#8220;single payer&#8221; system of health care that kicks the insurers out of the profit-from-my-life-threatening-condition rentier existence and resigns them to offering supplemental insurance for those that want cushier than the universal coverage. We need federal enforcement of anti-trust, so that multinationals lose their aura of quasi sovereign status and can&#8217;t get &#8220;too big to fail&#8221;. (if anything is a short catchy phrase for what anti-trust should aid at, too big to fail seems to capture it.) We need to reinvigorate unions, so that ordinary Americans have a chance to grab a slice of the American pie. <br />Instead, states are putting on the austerity brakes. By keeping state taxes too low&#8211;cutting business taxes, cutting taxes on investment income and otherwise generally failing to adopt a steeply progressive tax system that could ensure they have adequate funding for important programs, states are sacrificing their futures. For example, states are forcing students to pay way too much for state universities (while they coddle private universities that should be making it on their own). Tuition has gone up by about the same amount that state support has gone down. States are firing state workers, or making them absorb a pay cut of 10-20% (in the name of making them pay more into their retirement plans while the states pay less, or making them pick up all of the incremental costs of health care coverage). The trickle down effect of those cuts is a slashing of small business in localities throughout the states. States are taking away public bargaining rights&#8211;moving us back to a neofeudalism where workers like peasants have to take whatever scraps the big boss throws their way, from cutting wages in half to tossing out the pension plan that the boss never fulfilled his promises towards. They are using a divide and conquer strategy&#8211;tell private workers [whose unions were long ago weakened by Taft-Hartley&#8217;s provisions and by concerted employer action to impede union formation and lobby for provisions that make it harder to unionize (such as the fight against the &#8216;card check&#8217; rule)] that it isn&#8217;t fair for public workers to still be able to have unions and have good wages and benefits. Bring &#8217;em all down to the dog eat dog world where the 1% will lord it over and the 99% can grovel.<br />There&#8217;s a good letter to the editor in the New York Times Friday 2/10/12, at A22, on the Cost of Public Colleges: easing the burden, by Mark Steinberg, history professor at the University of ILlinois in Champaign-Urbana (my stomping ground before my move to Detroit). He hits it right on.<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;Punishing&#8221; schools that have partly filled the gap [left by the erosion of state support] with higher tuition may make education cheaper but will surely damage that education. College teachers across the country have seen many of these &#8216;more cost-effective ways to deliver education&#8217;: bigger classes taught by overworked and lower-paid adjuncts, more online courses, freezing the pay of faculty and staff, and other measures that control costs at the expense of quality and access.</p></blockquote>
<p>Steinberg proposes two solutions to ensure that more money is spend on the &#8220;primary mission&#8211;serving the public good with new knowledge and educating citizens regardless of income&#8221;. The solution is to help states restore higher education funding, and to end the &#8220;jack and the beanstalk&#8221; growth of administrative positions.<br />Hear, Hear. Michigan, for one, needs to move to a progressive income tax and use the increased revenues to re-fund its state universities, which have moved from about 60% state funding to about 30% state funding in the last few decades.<br />If we don&#8217;t, we will see the proliferation of preferential treatment of the elite 1%, and the mashing down of most of the ordinary folk to low services. See Peter Funt, <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204652904577192661303150588.html">How Government Coddles the 1%,</a> Wall St. Journal, Feb. 11-12, 2012, at A22 (noting that purchased privileges like California&#8217;s creation of &#8220;high roller lanes&#8221; for the wealthy who pay a fee and speedy airport screening for the rich are &#8220;dangerous precedents&#8221; for a country that has long considered the community of sharers of the public good to be undifferentiated by class. What&#8217;s next, he asks&#8211;public libraries where goold card holders get first crack at new titles; public parks, where the elite get the cleanest, greenest spaces; public beaches, where premium members get the best spots; public memorials, where the elite get the red carpet? As we move in that direction, we not only define an upper class but we place everyone else in a lower caste. <br /><a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2012/02/the-relation-between-high-college-tuition-low-state-funding-of-higher-ed-and-the-gop-agenda.html" title="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2012/02/the-relation-between-high-college-tuition-low-state-funding-of-higher-ed-and-the-gop-agenda.html">http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2012/02/the-relation-between-high-college-tuition-low-state-funding-of-higher-ed-and-the-gop-agenda.html</a></p>

<p>News Sources report Santorum has released tax returns. I&#8217;m on my way to San Diego for the ABA Tax Section meeting, so haven&#8217;t had a chance to peruse. But a tax rate of around 25-27% for 2007-2010 on income ranging from $659,000 in 2007 to more than a million in 2009 shows Santorum paid a considerably higher share of his income in taxes than did Romney (at not quite 14%).</p>

<p>  I got the same piece of mail that my colleague and fellow blogger Jim Maule got&#8211;a disturbingly misleading rant trying to make a case for zero taxation of unearned income. I started to write a post about it, since this is the kind of material that gets my ire up. It is written with what appears to be an intent to confuse or mislead. It applies vague language when that suits the writer, and fails to explain even the simplest transactions acceptably.</p>
<p>Maule beat me to it. He has an excellent post on Issue 9.04 of Tax Bytes, put out by the Institute for Policy Innovation (a think tank on the right): <a href="http://mauledagain.blogspot.com/#615913563584145046">When Double Taxation Doesn&#8217;t Exist</a>, Mauled Again (Feb. 8, 2012).</p>
<p>The problem with the IPI starts with the title of the piece&#8211;&#8220;when investment earns you additional&#8211;not lower&#8211;taxes&#8221;. Right there they are conflating two things&#8211;the original amount earned that was put into the investment, creating a &#8220;tax basis&#8221; that will not be subject to tax on any disposition of the investment; and the return on the investment when it is sold (or when dividends are paid on it), creating additional &#8220;gross income&#8221; that will be subject to tax, though at the preferentially low, low rate currently applicable for capital gains.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />As Maule points out, the piece seems to be written to try to make the unknowing reader think that all the proceeds of a disposition of an investment will be taxable, not just the NEW income represented by the gain &#8211;the increase in value of the investment over the original basis.</p>
<p>The fact that a think tank could publish this kind of tax rhetoric, with so many misleading or erroneous statements, is just one more reason that I have urged my colleagues here at Wayne Law to require all our students to take at least the basic federal income tax course. No student will come out of that course making the mistakes the IPI made in its piece on the taxation of gains from investments. And every lawyer ought to have that foundation, so that they don&#8217;t make such foolish statements as those in the IPI piece.</p>

<p>U.S. Chamber and corporations fighting for low preferential capital gains rates</p>
<p>  A coalition of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and large multinational corporations such as Altria Group Inc. and Excel Energy Inc. is trying to pressure Congress to retain the extraordinarily low current tax rates on unearned income that will expire at the end of 2012 without action. </p>
<p>The alliance sponsored a report by Robert Carroll and Gerald Prante of Ernst &#038; Young that develops the idea of an &#8220;integrated tax rate on dividends&#8221; that includes the taxes paid by the dividend-paying corporation, the federal income taxes paid by the recipient, and the state taxes paid by the recipient. See Carroll &#038; Prante, <a href="http://www.theasi.org/assets/EY_ASI_Dividend_and_Capital_Gains_International_Comparison_Report_2012-02-03.pdf">Corporate Dividend and Capital Gains Taxation: A Comparison of the United States to other developed nations </a>(Feb. 9, 2012), Higher <a href="http://www.theasi.org/in-the-news/new-study.html">Capital Gains and Dividend Taxes Would Put U.S. Further Behind International Competitors</a>, Alliance press release (Feb. 9, 2012); Richard Rubin, <a href="http://www.theasi.org/in-the-news/corporate-coalition-says-obama-investement-taxes-near-world-high.html">Corporate Coalition Says Obama investment taxes Near World High</a>, Bloomberg.com (Feb. 9, 2012)(republished on the Alliance website). The report claims that the U.S. has an &#8220;integrated&#8221; rate of 50.8%. The report claims that such a rate &#8220;discourages capital investment, particularly in the corporate sector, reducing capital formation and, ultimately, living standards.&#8221; Richard Rubin, Corporate Coalition Says Obama Investment Taxes Near World High, Bloomberg.com (Feb. 9, 2012).</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />Robert Carroll is a former Bush administration official who regularly presents on behalf of corporatism&#8217;s Holy Grail of lower corporate taxes, lower dividend rates, and/or change to a territorial tax system for U.S. corporations. See, e.g., <a href="http://www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/CTP_Territorial_Article_02Jan2012/%24FILE/CTP_Territorial_Article_02Jan2012.pdf">Charting a Course for Tax Reform&#8211;Moving the U.S. Towards a Territorial Tax System</a> (Jan. 2012); <a href="http://vatinfo.org/2011/07/carroll-robert-ernst-young-llcs-center-for-tax-policy-considerations-for-a-value-added-tax-in-the-united-states-testimony-before-the-ways-and-means-committee-july-26-2011/">Considerations for a Value-Added Tax </a>(July 26, 2011) (arguing that a VAT-type consumption tax could permit lowering corporate tax rates). Carroll&#8217;s VAT article makes the same argument as here&#8211;that taxes hurt investment and therefore jobs.<br />
<blockquote>Greater reliance on value-added taxes, or other consumption-type taxes, to fund government can help improve economic performance because consumption taxes do not tax the return to saving and investment. By not taxing the return to saving and investment, these taxes reduce the cost of capital and lead to greater investment. Greater investment means more capital formation, and, ultimately, higher labor productivity and living standards than otherwise. Id.</p></blockquote>
<p>But these arguments ignore the distributional impact of shifting taxes from corporations and wealthy stock traders to everyday Americans who make 30,000 or 50,000 or 75,000. The drive by the GOP and big corporations to save the wealthy from paying much in taxes shows no concern at all for the fact that the tax burden would be shifted to low-income Americans. <br />Not surprisingly, the tax rate analysis in this &#8220;for hire&#8221; E&#038;Y report is highly misleading. Let&#8217;s note the reasons, yet again.
<ul>
<li>The report assumes that shareholders bear the full brunt of the corporate income tax. Yet there is no conclusive evidence about the incidence of corporate tax. Many shareholders such as pension funds are tax exempt and pay no tax on the corporate dividends. </li>
<li>The report assumes that corporate income is taxed at the federal statutory rate of 35%, whereas in reality the vast majority of corporations pay zero federal income tax and those that pay tax pay an average around 24% effective tax rate (with many lower). Aggressive tax planning, cross-border tax credits, and various deductions (including greatly accelerated depreciation and expensing compared to actual economic wear and tear) allow corporations to reduce their tax liabilities much below the nominal statutory rate. While a chart on page 4 (showing a $100 income amount suffering the 35% corporate rate, an average state corporate rate, a 15% shareholder federal tax and a 4% assumed average shareholder state tax) indicates this is the &#8220;top&#8221; rate, most of the report discusses this &#8220;integrated&#8221; rate as though it were the actual rate paid. </li>
<li>The report disregards the fact that capital gains are also earned outside of corporations (as Dan Shaviro noted in the Bloomberg piece). It suggests that the corporate level tax will impact &#8220;each worker&#8221;:</li>
</ul>
<p>With less capital available for each worker to work with, labor productivity is lowered, which reduces the wages of workers, and ultimately, Americans’ standard of living. Report at 5.<br />Yet much of the work done in this country is not done for major corporations. There are partnerships and S corporations and sole proprietorships all operating businesses and providing capital gains in appropriate contexts. (And of course most of the capital gains that are being taxed aren&#8217;t earned from money that was invested in corporations but rather from corporate stock bought in the secondary market. All this talk about capital for workers is irrelevant to those secondary market trades. See this point below.)
<ul>
<li>The conclusions disregard the fact that investors can defer taxation of capital gains indefinitely by choosing when to sell, and that many gains are never taxed at all over multiple generations, since heirs receive corporate stock (and other assets) with a step-up in basis. (Text accompanying footnote 5 merely mentions that the effective rate &#8220;might&#8221; be lowered by this fact; the footnote notes that &#8220;common practice&#8221; for determining the impact would give an integrated tax rate of 43.1%.) </li>
<li>Chuck Marr, at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, also indicated that &#8220;the report also ignores the total tax burden around the world. In 2009, U.S. tax revenue of 24.1 percent of gross domestic product was 9.7 percentage points below the unweighted average of countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.&#8221; As a result, &#8220;the United States is actually a very low-tax country compared to all these other countries.&#8221; Richard Rubin, Corporate Coalition Says Obama Investment Taxes Near World High, Bloomberg.com (Feb. 9, 2012). </li>
<li>The report purportedly compares top integrated tax rates among the developed countries. But does it really include all the relevant taxes for other countries? It is not clear that the VAT, for example, has been included in countries where a VAT is a significant addition to regular income taxes: the report mentions only corporate income tax rates and dividend tax rates in discussing other countries&#8217; &#8220;integrated&#8221; rates. </li>
<li>The report ignores the fact that there is at best a very slim correlation between the transfer of funds to a business entity for use in running the business and capital gains taxation. Most corporate stock is purchased in the secondary markets, not at IPOs. Most of the gains that are taxed are therefore just accretions in value as corporate stock changes hands from one investor to another. There is no benefit of capital formation for the corporation from the trade&#8211;the money goes into the pockets of the one who sells, possibly to be reinvested offshore in an emerging market economy or to purchase the stock of another U.S. MNE. </li>
<li>The report assumes that half of any increase in dividend taxes is absorbed into share value but the other half &#8220;influences investment decisions&#8221;. n.12. This is one of those &#8220;anything goes&#8221; assumptions that is so annoying about supposedly empirical work that tries to &#8220;predict&#8221; how behavior will be affected by taxes. </li>
<li>The report discusses a &#8220;marginal effective tax rate&#8221; and suggests that corporate capital will be reduced by that rate, resulting in less expansion and less job creation. But that rate as shown here includes the statutory tax rate on the corporation&#8217;s profits and the shareholders&#8217; tax rate on its unearned income from holding corporate stock. Even if one thought that using the statutory rate to discuss corporate tax burdens was reasonable (which I do not), this mingled rate is not the relevant rate that the corporation would consider in determining whether it was profitable and could expand and add on workers or jobs. The corporation may retain its profits and use them to expand or provide working capital, and not pay dividends to shareholders. Many corporations have in fact foregone dividends and instead invested in share buybacks, which give a perceived benefit from reducing the total number of outstanding shares. Interestingly, while the report uses this mingled rate to argue that taxes are bad because it will keep corporations from investing and hiring (pp5-6), it also argues that taxes on unearned income of shareholders from corporations will mean corporations will retain those earnings and &#8220;overinvest&#8221; in the corporation (p7). Talk about trying to have your pie and eat it too. </li>
<li>The argument that fungible investor capital will necessarily flee the country if capital gains rates are allowed to go back to at least the level they were under Clinton, as GOP representative Peter Roskam from Illinois suggests, id., simply misundersands what drives investment decisions and the way our tax system works. </li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Many other factors drive investors to purchase stock, whether in IPOs or in the secondary market, including the stability of a country&#8217;s markets, the vigorousness of economic growth, the price-earnings ratios of corporate stocks, the economic outlook for particular industrial sectors, etc. </li>
<li>Americans are taxed on their worldwide income, so they don&#8217;t avoid the US tax on capital gains unless they expatriate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Taxes are just one factor, and in fact corporate stocks traded quite well when capital gains taxes and dividends taxes were much higher than they are now. Many experts think that removing the preferential rate for capital gains would be the most reasonable way to level the playing field for workers and managers/owners, while raising billions to offset the federal deficit. </li>
<li>The distributional effects of very low capital gains tax rates are detrimental. Most of those who benefit from the preferential capital gains are the wealthy who own most of the financial assets, with about 2/3 of the benefit going to millionaires, according to the Tax Policy Center. Id.</li>
</ul>
<p>Taxes on earned income&#8211;salary and wages&#8211;are graduated, rising to a maximum of 35% for top income earners. Taxes on unearned income, such as dividends from qualifying corporations or gains from sales of corporate shares, are only 15%. This significant disparity in rates (35% compared to 15%) means that the wealthy who own most of the financial assets and have most of the capital gain income enjoy an extraordinarily preferential tax rate. The result is that wealthy individuals like Mitt Romney can end up paying a significantly lower tax rate than construction workers, firefighters and schoolteachers. That&#8217;s unreasonable: the nation would be better served by eliminating the capital gains preference and using those funds to rebuild public infrastructure.</p>
