<div>The headline on the Washington Post’s opening Web page was irresistible: “<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/">Romney aides: No Mideast turmoil if he were president</a>.”  The headline of the actual article, by Philip Rucker, though, is headlined “<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/decision2012/romney-team-sharpens-attack-on-obamas-foreign-policy/2012/09/13/9b3f2744-fdd3-11e1-b153-218509a954e1_story.html?hpid=z1">Romney team sharpens attack on Obama’s foreign policy</a>.” 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Both headings <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/election-2012/wp/2012/09/14/romney-pulls-punches-in-abc-news-interview/?hpid=z2">are accurate</a>. Romney’s foreign policy team—drawn, apparently, entirely from the farthest-right faction of George W. Bush’s foreign policy advisors—issued a series of written statements yesterday.  And among them, if I understand correctly, is one in which they suggest that the Obama administration should have established a puppet government in Libya after Gadhafi fell last year. Oh, and probably one in Egypt, too.  And in Yemen, and in ….
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Y’all know: Like the puppet government that these very same folks, then Bush administration officials, tried to establish in Iraq back in 2003.  The effort that worked out so well.  Remember?
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>It’s time now for Obama and the news media to make it far better known than it is now <i>who</i> Romney’s foreign policy team members <i>are</i>—and to remind people of what happened when last they directed this country’s foreign policy. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>As for the fact that Romney has delusions of autocratic grandeur, or at least of mystical powers over Middle Easterners to cause them to happily acquiesce to our efforts to control them, Romney himself is taking care of that just fine, thank you. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>And at least he’s finally making clear where all that extra money for defense spending will go.  If not where that money will come from.  
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Romney&#8217;s sons all are too old to be subject to any new military draft necessitated by his and his policy team&#8217;s  desires, and his grandchildren all are very young.  So the Romney family is save.  Many other families, though, probably not so much.</div>
