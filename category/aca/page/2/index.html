                                <p>No not the striking down of the mandate part, heck probably a thousand fingers were poised over an equal number of &#8216;Send&#8217; keys when the ruling came down. Me? I took a shower and started thinking about the practical implications of ACA as it will operate under current law as modified today.</p>
<p>Starting with the MLR. Which you did hear about here first in this AB post from July 2009<a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2009/07/hr3200-sec-116-golden-bullet-or-smoking.html"> HR3200 Sec 116: Golden Bullet or Smoking Gun</a> . MLR stands for Medical Loss Ratio which in the final version of ACA was set at 85% for the Group market and 80% for the Individual market for health insurance policies issued by private insurers. Now &#8216;Medical Loss&#8217; is itself an interesting term of art, it represents the actual amount of insurance premiums collected &#8216;lost&#8217; via being expended on actual care paid for under your policy. That is for insurance companies the actual end service being delivered from purchase of their product is from their perspective a dead loss to be reduced. Hence a business model built around denying claims.</p>
<p>MLR minimums start to flip that model on its head. Under the rule if the ratio of premium collected to provider payments issued exceeds 15% or 20% respectively in Group or Individual market the difference has to be rebated to the policy holder. And indeed such rebate checks actually went out this year, this provision having already kicked in. Well after this morning&#8217;s ruling that rule will continue to operate until specifically repealed. And it is important, though maybe not as much as I was able to convince Donny Shaw of when he put this post up on Open Congress on Nov 14, 2009 <strong><a href="http://www.opencongress.org/articles/view/1357-The-Most-Important-Health-Care-Reform-Provision-You-ve-Never-Heard-Of">The Most Important Health Care Reform Provision You&#8217;ve Never Heard Of</a>.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>For example Richard Escow of HuffPo and elsewhere is of the opinion (expressed semi-privately to me and some others), that while important MLR can be gamed. </strong><strong>And in fact I discuss that somewhat in my original 2009 post, feel free to rip on this in comments. Me? I still</strong><strong> think MLR is transformational.</strong><br /><strong></strong><br /><a name="more"></a><strong><br /></strong><br />So what things are NOT included as &#8216;medical losses&#8217;? In short: administration, management, and direct profits from operations. (For example gains from retained and reinvested profits would not I think count against the company). Currently a lot of health insurance administration is focused on making sure that people likely to submit claims don&#8217;t get signed up and/or denying claims to those who for whatever reason obtain coverage. Well various separate &#8216;must cover&#8217; &#8216;no pre-existing condition exclusion&#8217; rules take care of much of the first part, under ACA the companies have little room to just turn customers away. And MLR installs limits on the second part. While companies have an incentive to trim their medical &#8216;losses&#8217; as close to the minimum as possible, every dollar spent doing so puts a squeeze on the same 15% or 20% of premiums they need to pay management salaries and return profits to shareholders. While every dollar squeezed out of the claims process by increasing efficiency and throughput of claims (i.e. actually paying providers on a timely basis with a minimum of paperwork requirements) leaves that much left over for management and shareholders. Gosh all of a sudden we have a business model based on efficient DELIVERY of services rather than DENIAL of them.</p>
<p>Paging Rusty Rustbelt! And Mike Halasy! Because I would love to see how this argument plays to people from the provider community. Particularly folk who have been on both sides of the overall issue. And of course I welcome comment from everyone else. I have been largely absent from the Health Care Debate since actually passage of ACA, the ball went into the lawyers&#8217; court and I am if anything less a lawyer than I am an economist. But after this morning we are right back in the policy analysis game. To which I say &#8220;Put me in coach!&#8221;</p>

<div>Thought y’all would enjoy <a href="http://www.volokh.com/2012/06/19/foolishly-reading-the-tea-leaves-of-justice-ginsburgs-speech-at-the-acs/">this post</a>, on one of THE BIG DEAL law-profs’ blogs.  It’s bloggers are right- to center-right libertarians, all (or at least most) of them former law clerks to one of the conservative Supreme Court justices.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Ah. And <a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_AP_POLL_HEALTH_CARE?SITE=AP&#038;SECTION=HOME&#038;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT">this </a>is even <i>more</i>interesting.  Woo-hoo!
</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8211;<br />UPDATE: <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2012/06/20/155434549/survey-former-supreme-court-clerks-think-court-will-strike-healthcare-mandate?ft=1&#038;f=1001">Welll</a>.  Hmmm.  As I said earlier today in a comment in response to JackD’s comment about my post, I was surprised to read the original law-prof blogger’s interpretation of Ginsburg’s weekend comments, because on Monday I had concluded the opposite after reading a quote from Ginsburg’s speech. 
<div>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The quote was:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>As one may expect, many of the most controversial cases remain pending. So it is likely that the sharp disagreement rate will go up next week and the week after.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>As I noted in my comment to Jack, “Sharp disagreement,” in Supreme Court coverage, usually means 5-4 decisions, although sometimes it means “fractured,” as in, there were a zillion separate concurring and dissenting opinions, and no one can actually figure out what the hell the actual result was. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>As I also said, the ACA case, of course, isn’t the only high-profile case the Court will decide in the next 10 days or so.  But I still read that comment as suggesting a 5-4 result in the ACA case.  The CW is that if the ACA is stricken down, it will be 5-4, but that if it’s upheld it will be 6-3.  But Kerr could be right.  Ginsburg might have just been sending out a red herring.  Who knows?  Or: Oh, what the hell.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Ooooh.  This is more nerve-wracking than betting on your Kentucky Derby favorite, who’s no one else’s favorite; your odds are even <i>worse</i>. And there’s no “place” or “show” here.  Unless ….
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>As I also said in responding to comments to my post—JackD’s and run’s—the impact of the poll I linked to in the last sentence of my post is, I think, that it suggests that, contrary to the CW of the last two years, the healthcare-insurance issue could be a big positive, rather than a negative, for the Dems in November, if the Court does strike down the entire ACA or the mandate part of it.  (And even if it doesn’t, since by the election most people finally will actually know what’s in the law, what’s not in the law, and what the purpose of the mandate is and how it relates to the preexisting-conditions provision.)  The Repubs want the status quo.  The Dems and a substantial majority of the public don’t.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8211;<br />*In response to a comment by Gary, in the Comments to this post, asking what “CW” is, I wrote:</p>
<p>
<div>
</div>
<div>Conventional wisdom.  I&#8217;m sorry.  I did exactly what I hate when other people do that.  Especially mainstream-media bloggers like Matthew Yglesias, who regularly drops names of people I&#8217;ve never heard of, and the like, on his blog on Slate.  I guess now I qualify to blog on Slate.    <br /> <br />Again, sorry.

<p>A non-profit group estimates if the Affordable Care Act provisions had been effect in 2010, U.S consumers would have received $2 billion in rebates. <br />
<blockquote><a href="http://www.upi.com/topic/Sara_Collins/">Sara Collins</a>, vice president of the Commonwealth Fund, a foundation supporting independent research on health policy, said the medical-loss ratio rules that went into effect in 2011 were designed to control private insurance administrative costs for consumers and government.<br />The rules require a minimum percentage of premium dollars to be spent on medical care and healthcare quality improvement &#8212; not administrative costs and corporate profits. Insurers must meet a minimum medical loss ratio of 80 percent in the individual and small-group markets, and 85 percent in the large group market &#8212; and issue rebates if they do not, Collins said.</p></blockquote>

<p>Judge Brett Kavanaugh’s Strange Political Prediction—And Other Recent ACA-Litigation Events</p>
<p>Well, as you all probably know by now, there have been two major developments in the courts within the last two weeks on the litigation challenging the constitutionality of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the ACA, a.k.a., “Obamacare). On November 8, a three-judge panel of the federal appeals court for Washington, D.C. issued its ruling in a case challenging the constitutionality of the so-called individual mandate requiring everyone who can afford healthcare insurance to purchase it, upon penalty of payment of a regulatory fee. That, of course, is the issue that has gotten almost all of the news media attention, thanks to loud Tea Party/Republican-pol/rightwing-talk-show-personalities cries that the mandate unconstitutionally violates individual liberty and therefore is beyond Congress’s authority under the Constitution’s Commerce Clause.</p>
<p> <a name="more"></a>
<p>The Commerce Clause gives Congress the power to regulate interstate commerce and, under Supreme Court precedent, pretty much anything that affects interstate commerce. It is the “enumerated power” under which the ACA was enacted. As opposed to, say, the taxing “enumerated” power.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/search/label/Beverly%20Mann%20%28Supreme%20court%29">In several earlier AB posts</a>, including one about the oral argument in late September in the appeal that was decided by last week’s ruling, I said that the right-wing’s conflation of the limits of Congress’s authority under the Commerce Clause and the separate issue of the Constitution’s various limitations on government power to infringe upon individual liberty, including in the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause limiting the federal government’s powers to infringe upon individuals’ rights, is a sophism, as a matter of law and as a matter of logic. I also said that the Due Process argument is fatuous; the federal government clearly has the authority under the <em>taxing</em> power to compel the purchase of medical insurance or retirement savings, and does so for Medicare and Social Security, and a mandate under the Commerce power infringes no more on individual liberty than a mandate under the taxing power.</p>
<p>I made these points originally in <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/06/paul-clements-weird-tail-can-morph-dog.html">an AB post in late June</a>, a few days before Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Jeffrey Sutton, a highly-regarded conservative Reagan appointee prominent Federalist Society member who early in his career served for a year as a law clerk to Justice Scalia, eloquently deconstructed that conflation in his 2-1 majority opinion upholding the constitutionality of individual mandate. I reiterated the points in an AB post <em>about</em> the Sutton opinion (<a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/07/judge-sutton-channels-me-states-and.html">which I sillily titled “Judge Sutton Channels … Me??”</a>). And I summarized them in <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/10/plot-sickens-heart-of-aca-litigation.html">a post in early October</a> in which I discussed the oral argument in the appeal that was decided on November 8.</p>
<p>The Sixth Circuit opinion was the first appellate ruling on an ACA case. The dissenter in that opinion is not an appellate judge but instead a trial-level judge sitting on that appellate panel “by designation ” of that court’s chief judge via a statute that allows this, and whose dissenting opinion was breathtakingly lightweight.</p>
<p> <!-- more -->
<p>In August, an Eleventh Circuit panel consisting of a Clinton appointee to the Court of Appeals who had been appointed as a trial-level judge by Reagan, another Clinton appointee, and a George H. W. Bush appointee, issued a 2-1 opinion ruling the individual-mandate provision unconstitutional but upholding the remainder of the ACA, saying that the remainder was “severable” from the individual-mandate provision—that is, that the remainder of the Act could stand on its own and that therefore the loss of the mandate provision did not dissolve the remainder of the statute. The opinion was written by the Reagan appointee, Joel Dubina and joined by Clinton appointee Frank Hull. Neither judge is considered a star legal analyst, and the opinion didn’t disappoint. It was a rote adoption of the the-individual-mandate-unconstitutionally-infringes-on-liberty-because-it-penalizes-inaction-and-therefore-Congress-exceded-its-Commerce-Clause-authority. The opinion doesn’t explain how a supposed unconstitutional infringement of liberty amounts to a <em>per se</em> exceeding of Congress’s <em>Commerce</em> power, the opinion doesn’t explain. Alchemy? The dissent by Judge Stanley Marcus is scathing. (More about this case below.)</p>
<p>The panel in the Washington, D.C. case, the one decided on November 8, like the panel in the Sixth Circuit case, was comprised of two conservative Republican appointees and a Democratic appointee. Both Republican appointees, Lawrence Silberman and Brett Kavanaugh, the latter a former law clerk for Judge Kennedy, are high-profile stalwart conservatives and both are intellectual leaders of the “movement” right, albeit from slightly different conservative-legal-movement eras. Silberman is a Reagan appointee, Kavanaugh a George W. Bush appointee. In any event, they are not just rightwing but also considered intelligent, if not necessarily by me.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/10/plot-sickens-heart-of-aca-litigation.html">my post last month about the oral argument</a> in that case, I wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Sutton’s analysis exposes the constitutional challenges to the individual mandate for what they are: a series of ideological clichés masquerading as legal argument.  As I wrote in AB shortly after the Sutton opinion was released, his analysis is so fine, so precise, that ultimately the Supreme Court’s opinion will echo it.  So I was not among those who were surprised that the administration is pushing for a Supreme Court ruling on the constitutionality or the statute before the 2012 election.  But all the judges thus far who have voted to invalidate the individual-mandate provision as unconstitutional are, in my opinion, intellectual lightweights, and so I’d wondered whether the Sutton analysis itself could be persuasively deconstructed by a judge or justice who is not.
<p>The answer appears to be no.  Last week, a panel of yet federal appellate court, this one the one for Washington, D.C., heard arguments in yet another case challenging the constitutionality of the mandate as beyond Congress’s Commerce-regulation authority because it infringes upon the liberty of individuals to remain self-insured, it requires the purchase of a “product” from a private party, and, well, um, the scope of the statute is really sweeping.  I mean, what’s next, asked one of the two stalwart rightwing-intellectual-heavyweight members of the panel?  Congress mandating the purchase of GM cars by the wealthy in order to prevent the collapse of that company during the next economic downturn, upon pain of payment of a penalty for failure to do so?  (I hope so. Then, when David Koch has a heart attack in his Maserati and the ambulance attendants verify through the Secretary of State’s offices in his various home states that there is no GM car registered in his name, the attendants dump his gasping-for-breath body in the road, where he’s run over by a Cadillac SUV</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I followed those paragraphs with this one:</p>
<blockquote><p>A sigh of relief was in order—although I had to wait until I stopped smiling like a Cheshire cat.  That judge, Brett Kavanaugh (a former law clerk to Justice Kennedy, circa 1993), reportedly commented earlier to the plaintiffs’ lawyer that maybe the courts shouldn’t interfere with what could be the beginning of the mass privatization of the social safety net.  More likely, I think, it will prompt, finally, a single-payer healthcare-insurance system—Medicare for all—in order to cut out the spiraling costs of a private, multi-carrier, for-profit system whose premiums reflect, in part the investment losses of those private companies.  But don’t tell Judge Kavanaugh until after that appeal is over.</p></blockquote>
<p>Um, oops. Actually, it was Silberman, not Kavanaugh, who suggested that if the individual mandate in the ACA is constitutional, then a mandate requiring the purchase of a GM car might be, too. It <em>was</em>, however, Kavanaugh who predicted, mouth watering, that if the ACA’s mandate is upheld, it might usher in a mass privatization of the social safety net.
<p>When the panel decided the case, it was Silberman who wrote the opinion—for himself and the Democratic appointee, liberal Clinton appointee Harry Edwards, upholding the individual mandate and echoing the basics of Judge Sutton’s opinion: that the Commerce Clause gives Congress the authority to regulate that which affects an interstate market, as the healthcare market clearly is; that the decision to not purchase healthcare insurance is not inactivity but instead clearly market activity because (unlike the proverbial decisions whether to purchase broccoli, or a GM vehicle) virtually everyone will need healthcare at some point, and will receive it whether or not the person is insured or can afford to pay the medical bills out-of-pocket; that the infringement-of-individual-liberty objection is not a Commerce Clause issue but instead a Due Process issue; and that the individual-mandate provision does not unconstitutionally infringe upon individual liberty.</p>
<p>Silberman’s opinion adopts Sutton’s reasoning in all respects. Most interesting, I think—partly, I guess, because by now I feel like I have a proprietary interest in it—is his conclusion that:</p>
<blockquote><p>Appellants’ view that an individual cannot be subject to Commerce Clause regulation absent voluntary, affirmative acts that enter him or her into, or affect, the interstate market expresses a concern for individual liberty that seems more redolent of Due Process Clause arguments. But it has no foundation in the Commerce Clause.</p></blockquote>
<p>Kavanaugh dissented. But not on &#8220;liberty&#8221; grounds. And not even on Commerce Clause grounds. Instead, he said a court ruling now is premature, for two reasons., one (he said) compelled by statute, the other (he said) in deference to &#8220;the bedrock principle of judicial restraint that courts avoid prematurely or unnecessarily deciding constitutional questions.&#8221;
<p>&#8220;Unnecessarily&#8221; being the interesting part of this. </p>
<p>The statutory reason is his interpretation of a federal court-jurisdiction statute called the Anti-Injunction Act and of the legal nature of the mandate provision. The Anti-Injunction Act removes the “jurisdiction,” i.e., legal authority, of the courts to even consider the challenge to the individual-mandate provision and its penalty for failure to purchase insurance until after the effective date of that provision in 2014 and the penalty is assessed against someone who then sues for reimbursement, contesting the provision’s constitutionality. The issue depends on whether the penalty is a <em>tax</em>, since the Anti-Injunction Act applies only to taxes. In August, a panel of the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled, 2-1, that the mandate is a tax and that the Act therefore removed the courts’ jurisdiction to consider the constitutionality of the mandate provision until 2015, when the first penalties would be assessed by the I.R.S. Kavanaugh bought the argument; Silberman and Edwards didn’t. </p>
<p>The “unnecessarily” reason has subparts, but the main ones are that Congress may repeal the ACA, or parts of it, before the individual-mandate provision becomes effective, and, more to the point (or at least more to <em>my</em> point), that Congress may instead simply change the wording of the mandate provision slightly so that the penalty is clearly a tax. Which, he says, clearly would be constitutional.</p>
<p>He doesn’t say that it would be clearly within Congress’s taxing power. He says, flatly, that it would be clearly constitutional. He says, in other words, that the infringement on liberty does not itself violate the Constitution—whether the mandate is an exercise of Congress’s power to regulate interstate commerce or instead an exercise of Congress’s power to tax.</p>
<p>That Kavanaugh has an ideological ulterior motive which advertised at oral argument and reiterates with more elaboration in his dissenting opinion— his expectation that if the ACA’s mandate is upheld, it could herald an era of mass privatization of the social safety net, happily marrying tea party types and rightwing interests in having government create a market serving private business interests—does not matter. Nor does it matter that Kavanaugh is delusional—unless, of course, it really is likely that there is, say, a private-food-assistance lobby similar in number to the insurance-industry lobby that, like the insurance-industry lobby did in fighting single-payer healthcare insurance proposals (and even the so-called public option in a version of Obamacare) , will emerge like locusts to have Congress enact a law mandating that everyone who can afford to do so must purchase food stamps each year, redeemable when and if necessary. Or that the AARP will agitate for privatization of Social Security, maybe in order to prevent the government from funding massive otherwise-unfunded wars and massive tax cuts for the wealthy largely by tapping the ostensible Social Security trust fund.</p>
<p>No, what matters is that Kavanaugh said what he said, irrespective of his motive. Kavanaugh got it right. The individual-mandate provision does not violate the Constitution’s limitations on government infringement of individual liberty. And Sutton and Silberman, neither of whom appears to share Kavanaugh’s peculiar delusion and ulterior motive, but also neither of whom voted for Obama or any member of Congress who voted for his “care,” have enunciated so finely why this is so and why, also, the mandate provision is within Congress’s Commerce Clause authority, that a 5-4 Supreme Court ruling to the contrary would be a transparent act of ideology. It’s not, of course, that the majority doesn’t do this, regularly; they do. It’s that this time they would be eating not only Obama and Care, but also Kavanaugh, Sutton and Silberman.</p>
<p>The fat lady hasn’t sung yet on the constitutionality of the individual mandate, but I think it’s over nonetheless. When the Court decides that issue—and despite the out-of-right-field potential inherent in certain sort-of-breathtaking parts of the Court’s order last Monday agreeing to hear the Eleventh Circuit case—I think the Court <em>will</em> decide that issue, eventually, if not in that case.</p>
<p>For the specifics of that order, and a comprehensive discussion of the five parts to it and the possible implications of one of them, see Simon Lazarus and Dahlia Lithwick’s article in Slate, “The Medicaid Ambush: The Supreme Court&#8217;s unexpected and astounding reasons for wanting to hear a challenge to Obamacare,” <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2011/11/the_unexpected_and_astounding_arguments_the_supreme_court_will_hear_on_obamacare_.html">here</a>. </p>
</p>
<p><a name="_GoBack"></a>If the Court rules the ACA unconstitutional because the majority thinks the ACA’s expansion-of-Medicaid provision violates the states’, um, constitutional right to the current federal statutory entitlement (Medicaid in its current form) in order to protect the popularity of the states’ legislators who would vote to forego Medicaid in order to avoid the requirements of Obamacare (see the Slate article), then of course the Court will never have to decide the constitutionality of the individual mandate. I don’t think it will buy the states’ hubristic claim; I think the Court simply wants to hear all challenges from all governments that are suing. This is a court with at least a few members who apparently think that any time a state or local government asks it to hear a case, it should hear the case. But it also is a court whose majority, in deciding cases, regularly privileges the states’ interests over the interests of the federal government and of individuals. Their ideology largely rejects the Fourteenth Amendment and the original Constitution’s Supremacy Clause. So, who knows?</p>
<p>As for what caused Silberman’s change of heart about whether the individual mandate unconstitutionally infringes upon the liberty of individuals to remain uninsured, I have two theories. One is that Kavanaugh read my AB post attributing to him Silberman’s oral argument comment equating the mandate with a theoretical mandate to purchase a GM car, and after explaining to Silberman the difference between the two and insisting that Silberman publicly clarify the distinction or make clear that he, not Kavanaugh, drew the analogy, lest a gasping-for-air David Koch be dumped by an ambulance attendant onto the street and run over by a Cadillac Escalade and that Kavanaugh be blamed, he persuaded Silberman to change his mind about the whole analogy. The other is that Silberman himself gave more thought to whether it would be such a bad thing after all for the government to mandate a GM car in every driveway. After all, that new Chevy Cruze is awfully cute and gets pretty good gas mileage.</p>

<p><strong>Paul Clement’s weird tail-can-morph-the-dog ACA-litigation argument</strong> </p>
<p>Earlier this month I wrote a post called “Markets and the ACA: Why the Supreme Court Will Uphold the ACA&#8221; that discussed an article-length post by Santa Clara constitutional law prof. Brad Joondeph published on a blog he runs dedicated entirely to the ACA litigation.  I wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>[Santa Clara law prof. and ACA-litigation blogger Brad Joondelph is] right, but only if, as he says earlier, the market for health insurance is defined so narrowly that health insurance is viewed as a commodity, a product, independent of the product’s purpose and effect. And then, the constitutional issue would not, I think, be whether Congress has the authority under the Commerce Clause, aided by the Necessary and Proper Clause, to regulate the health insurance market, but instead whether this violates some other constitutional limitation. You know: the slippery-slope-to-government-compelled-consumption-of-broccoli argument.</p></blockquote>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>I wrote that post and sent it to Dan a day or two before the oral argument in the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in what most commentators think is likely to be the ACA case that the Supreme Court will use to decide the constitutionality of the ACA.  Dan posted it a day after the argument.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs in that case are 26 states, two or three individuals, and an organization of small businesses.  Former Bush solicitor general and current top-notch private-practice appellate and Supreme Court litigator Paul Clement is representing the 26 states.  Another lawyer is representing the private plaintiffs.  </p>
<p>The oral argument featured a colloquy between Clement and Judge Stanley Marcus, the swing vote on the panel hearing that appeal, that caused me to write a follow-up to my “Markets and the ACA” post called “Ah! It’s not about regulating markets, after all!  It’s about regulating the individual!”  I said in that post that in light of what occurred at that oral argument, which was based on the several reports I’d read—I hadn’t read the transcript of the three-hour argument—it looks like I was on to something when I wrote in the earlier post that the constitutional issue might not be whether Congress has the authority under the Commerce Clause, aided by the Necessary and Proper Clause, to regulate the health insurance market, but instead whether this violates some other constitutional limitation.</p>
<p>Last week, I emailed Prof. Joondeph, told him about my posts, and asked what he thought of my analysis and my prediction that the case might be decided not on the issue of whether Congress has the authority under the Commerce Clause (coupled with the Necessary and Proper Clause) to regulate the health insurance market but instead whether the individual-mandate provision violates some other constitutional limitation.  His response, which provided more information about what really transpired between Marcus and Clement, surprised me.  With his permission to publish it, here’s his response:</p>
<blockquote><p>Very nice to hear from you. And I&#8217;m glad you found at least some of my analysis mildly helpful.</p>
<p>I generally agree with your legal analysis: there seems to be virtually no way any court invalidates the ACA on substantive due process grounds. The notion that forcing someone to purchase a product against their will violates the &#8220;liberty&#8221; protected by the Due Process Clause has not had any real support since 1937, when the Court decided <i>West Coast Hotel</i>and ended the <i>Lochner</i>era. So that claim is going nowhere.</p>
<p>This is why the states have actually abandoned the claim (though they raised it in their initial complaint). So there literally is no chance for this claim. It is no longer a part of the case.</p>
<p>What Clement and Marcus discussed at argument was whether it was at all anomalous that the underlying objection to the mandate sounded in &#8220;liberty,&#8221; but that the legal challenge was framed along the dimensions of &#8220;powers.&#8221; Marcus thought it a bit strange. Clement argued it was not, as the federal structure of government is ultimately intended to protect individual liberty (as the Supreme Court has stated on several occasions).</p>
<p>Perhaps even more specifically, I think Marcus was wondering whether it made any sense to impose a &#8220;Congress can only regulate voluntary action&#8221; limitation on the commerce power, if that limitation stemmed principally from individual liberty concerns, rather than from a coherent conception of the scope of interstate commerce.</p>
<p>Not sure this directly responds to your questions. But those are my thoughts &#8212; coherent or otherwise. 🙂</p>
<p>All the best,<br />Brad</p></blockquote>
<p>Whoa.  Okay.  My response:</p>
<blockquote><p>One of my pet peeves as a political liberal is this claim by the conservative justices that federalism necessarily translates into a protection of individual liberty.  The Court is incessantly invoking federalist principals to keep the federal courts from intervening when states-especially state courts, but state legislatures too-infringe upon individual constitutional rights and upon individual liberty. Destroying individual liberty in order to save it, I guess.</p>
<p>During oral argument in February in the Supreme Court in Bond v. United States, the wacky case in which a biochemist tried to poison her former friend and current paramour of the biochemist&#8217;s husband, Kennedy said, &#8220;The whole point of separation of powers, the whole point of federalism, is that it inheres to the individual and his or her right to liberty; and if that is infringed by a criminal conviction or in any other way that causes specific injury, why can&#8217;t it be raised?&#8221;  What nonsense that the whole point of federalism is that it inheres to the individual and his or her right to liberty.  In <i>Bond</i>, it works that way.  In other cases, not so much.</p>
<p>Anyway &#8230; thanks for responding.</p>
<p>Best,<br />Beverly</p></blockquote>
<p><i>Lochner v. New York</i> is a 1905 Supreme Court case that invalidated a New York state labor law that limited the number of hours a baker could work per week to 60.  The Court said the statute violated the ‘liberty’ guarantee in the Fourteenth Amendment’s due process clause because it removed what the Court said was the constitutional right to contract freely.  </p>
<p>Back then, “substantive” due process—the right to make certain decisions without government interference—was limited to economic decisions.  In the 1960s, the Court expanded the concept to include the right to make certain deeply personal, non-economic decisions (such as the right to use contraceptives, to have an abortion under certain circumstances, to have homosexual sex) without government interference. Some modern legal conservatives, including four current Supreme Court justices, share the <i>Lochner</i>-era view that substantive due process protects only economic ‘liberty,’ and does so almost without limit.</p>
<p><i>Lochner</i> operated as a bar to most labor laws, until it was overturned in 1937 in a case called <i>West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish</i>, in which the Court upheld a Washington state minimum-wage statute and said the Constitution does not include an absolute right to contract freely.  The opinion held that states are entitled to restrict liberty of contract in order to protect the health and safety of the community or of vulnerable groups.</p>
<p>Clement, who was not involved in the case in the lower court, chose to drop the economic-substantive-due-process argument on appeal—if only ostensibly—presumably because he views the <i>West Coast Hotel</i> and the three quarters of a century of Supreme Court jurisprudence based on that opinion as having settled the matter.  No justice but Clarence Thomas would vote to overrule those precedents, even in order to void ‘Obamacare&#8217;.  </p>
<p>But Clement is attempting a really weird, and really dangerous, sleight of hand, and apparently Marcus saw through it.  If the individual mandate violates a constitutionally protected liberty interest, then the mandate is unconstitutional on that basis, irrespective of whether Congress had the authority to enact it as necessary and proper under the Commerce power.  And if the mandate doesn’t violate a constitutionally protected liberty interest, then substantive due process—individual liberty—can’t remove Congress’s authority to enact the mandate as necessary and proper under the Commerce power.  Conflating the two separate arguments doesn’t make it greater, constitutionally speaking, than the sum of its two separate parts.  </p>
<p>But if it does, we’re in for an interesting ride.  All that would be necessary to have the Court strike down any statute as beyond Congress’s authority under whatever the respective “enumerated” power under which the statute was enacted—the defense power; the taxing power; the spending power; whatever—would be to identify the relevant enumerated power and transform an unsuccessful substantive-due-process claim and an otherwise unsuccessful enumerated-powers claim into a successful enumerated-powers claim.  So long, Selective Service Act.  For example.  </p>
<p>Or maybe not. The Court’s 5-4 majority <i>could</i> limit the ruling to that one case.  That, of course, has it’s own precedent, called <i>Bush v.Gore</i>.</p>
<p>&#8212;-</p>
<p>The day after my email exchange with Prof. Joondeph, the Court issued its opinion in <i>Bond</i>.  Kennedy wrote the opinion for a unanimous court.  Ginsburg wrote a separate concurrence, which Breyer joined.  </p>
<p>&#8212;-</p>
<p><i>My thanks to Prof. Joondeph.</i></p>

<p>AMA backs the mandate…   </p>
<p>The AMA has its annual House of Delegates meeting last week, and boy, are they concerned. Recent evidence has suggested that they have lost 12,000 members since 2009. Much of this has been due to the AMA’s support of the PPACA. Today, the HOD voted to maintain the support of the individual mandate, (Chicago Tribune story <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/chibrknews-ama-debates-health-insurance-mandate-reports-membership-loss-20110619" target="_blank">here</a>).</p>
<p>The problem with this concern is that it isn’t new. The AMA has been losing members for many years. They have also been losing money.  <br /><a name="more"></a>At one point in there history, the AMA was powerful, perhaps one of the most powerful organizations in the country. Politicians feared them. People respected them. But then, with the rampant specialization that really began in the early 1960’s, physicians started to jump ship. Many began to only belong to the rapidly rising specialty organizations, believing that they could tend to their interests as a specialty physician better.<br />Add to this, that the AMA chose to have battles with…..well, everyone. They fought against group practices, labeling them “communist”. They challenged the creation of HMO’s and vigorously opposed Medicare. They fought against the Doctor of Osteopathy (D.O.) profession. They challenged the creation of the Nurse Practitioner and Physician Assistant professions, and have continually challenged Podiatrists, Chiropracters, Optometrists, Psychologists, and virtually everyone NOT an M.D. <br />The end result was an organization that became a caricature. A cartoon. Like the boy that cried wolf, the AMA lost respect and wasted precious political capital in far too many small skirmishes that could have been negotiated instead of battled. During this time they lost a lot of members. Determining the peak of membership is difficult as the AMA does not make that public, but it seems that membership during the aughts has decreased by about 2-3% annually, with this latest decreased of 5% being the most substantial. This means that once you discount the medical students, residents, and fellows, you have at best about 19-20% of physicians represented. Once you discount retirees the number is closer to 15-16% of practicing physicians. <br />This is too bad, but this is a situation that they themselves created.</p>

<p><strong>Ah! It’s not about regulating markets, after all!  It’s about regulating the individual!</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>ATLANTA — In perhaps the weightiest of the dozens of challenges to the Obama health care law, a panel of appellate judges grappled Wednesday with the essential quandary of the case: if the federal government can require Americans to buy medical insurance, what constitutional limit would prevent it from mandating all manner of purchases and activities?<br />—<a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/09/us/politics/09arguments.html?_r=1&#038;scp=1&#038;sq=June+8%2C+2011+Kevin+Sack&#038;st=nyt">Kevin Sack, New York Times, Jun. 8</a></p></blockquote>
<p>In my last post, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/06/markets-and-aca-why-supreme-court-will.html">Markets and the ACA: Why the Supreme Court Will Uphold the ACA</a>, I wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>[Santa Clara law prof. and ACA-litigation blogger Brad Joondeph is] right (see my earlier post), but only if, as he says earlier, the market for health insurance is defined so narrowly that health insurance is viewed as a commodity, a product, independent of the product’s purpose and effect. And then, the constitutional issue would not, I think, be whether Congress has the authority under the Commerce Clause, aided by the Necessary and Proper Clause, to regulate the health insurance market, but instead whether this violates some other constitutional limitation. You know: the slippery-slope-to-government-compelled-consumption-of-broccoli argument.</p></blockquote>
<p>Turns out I was onto something.  <br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Dan posted the post on Thursday, a day after the oral argument in the 11th Circuit court of Appeals in what is broadly viewed as the key ACA lawsuit because the plaintiffs include 26 states and because the trial-court judge, Pensacola-based Roger Vinson, struck down the entire ACA because he ruled that  the Act’s individual-mandate requirement is unconstitutional and said the entire statute is too dependent on the individual-mandate provision to “sever” that provision from the rest of the statute.  But I’d written my post on Tuesday, in anticipation of the oral argument, and posted it on my blog that day.</p>
<p>But from reports I’ve read about the oral argument on Wednesday, it looks to me like that appellate panel will decide the case not on the basis of the limits of the Commerce Clause but instead on a more general civil liberties ground.  They may cloak it as a Commerce Clause issue—and certainly that is what Paul Clement, the attorney representing the 26 states wants the court to do—but, really, given the questioning and comments from the swing judge on that appellate panel, and therefore the basis on which that panel will decide the case, this would be an improper conflation of Commerce Clause issues and what is known as “substantive due process” issues.  And I think, ultimately, it is the substantive due process question on which the Supreme Court will decide the case.  This is so even though conservative legal types detest the very concept of substantive due process.</p>
<p>Substantive due process is a doctrine of constitutional law that holds that there are limits, inherent within the Constitution, to the extent to which the government can interfere with basic personal choices, irrespective of how much procedural due process that individual is accorded.  It’s a concept completely independent of procedural due process—the right to due process of law before the courts can strip you of life, liberty or property.  </p>
<p>Procedural due process is all about the limits of what courts can do.  Substantive due process, by contrast, is almost always about the limits of what a legislature can do.  The doctrine holds that there are some personal choices that are inviolate under the Constitution.  It is the much-ridiculed-by-right-wingers legal principal on which <i>Roe v. Wade</i> was based.  Roe v. Wade, for its part, was based on a 1965 Supreme Court case called <i>Giswold v. Connecticut</i>, which created the substantive-due-process right of individuals to make deeply personal decisions for themselves and struck down as an unconstitutional violation of that privacy right a state statute that prohibited the use of contraceptives.  And it is the principal on which in an eloquent 2003 opinion, <i>Lawrence v. Texas</i>, by Justice Kennedy, the Court struck down Texas’s anti-sodomy criminal statute.  </p>
<p>Rehnquist, Scalia and Thomas dissented in <i>Lawrence</i> on the ground that, in their view, there is no such substantive-due-process right—no privacy right concerning intimate personal decisions—in the Constitution.  Scalia and Thomas might change their minds, though, but only about the intimate decision not to buy health insurance, especially because that right is just too similar to the intimate right not to eat broccoli. </p>
<p>The 11th Circuit panel members are Joel Dubina, a conservative Reagan appointee to the district (trial-court level) court and a G.H.W. Bush appointee to the appellate court, whose daughter is a freshman Alabama congresswoman who campaigned on a promise to try to repeal the ACA; Frank (female, despite her name) Hull, a moderate Clinton appointee; and Stanley Marcus, a moderate-to-conservative G.H.W. Bush appointee to the district court and Clinton appointee to the appellate court. </p>
<p>According to one report I read, Marcus early in the hearing said he viewed the central issue in the case—the constitutionality of the individual-mandate provision—as less a Commerce Clause issue than a civil liberties issue: Does the mandate violate the civil liberties of individuals by requiring them to obtain healthcare insurance?  That’s a different question, and a broader one, I think, then whether Congress has the authority under the Commerce Clause, aided by the Necessary and Proper Clause, to mandate the purchase of healthcare insurance by those who can afford to buy it.  Congress may have that authority under the Commerce Clause, but the legislation still might be unconstitutional if it violates another provision of the Constitution, here presumably the substantive due process right to be compelled to buy something.  Presumably, because no one, least of all Clement, used the term “substantive due process right”.  But he sure the words “compel,” “liberty” and “individual.”  Early and quite often:<br />
<blockquote>“The Commerce Clause only gives Congress the power to regulate, not to compel.” …</p>
<p>“It boils down to the question of whether the federal government can compel people into commerce to better regulate the individual.” …</p>
<p>“In 220 years, Congress never saw fit to use this power, to compel a person to engage in commerce.” …</p>
<p>“The whole reason we do this is to protect individual liberty.” …</p></blockquote>
<p>When Hull said she believed the decision not to buy insurance involved some “economic activity” that impacts the healthcare market (and that therefore, under the Supreme Court’s interpretation of Commerce Clause powers, Congress has the authority under the Commerce Clause, coupled with the Necessary and Proper Clause, to regulate), Clement reportedly responded that, despite this, Congress has no constitutional authority to force people to act to buy coverage.</p>
<p>Clement attempts to thread a needle.  </p>
<p>In 2005, in <i>Gonzales v. Raich</i>, the Court held that under the Commerce Clause, aided by the Necessary and Proper Clause, Congress has the power to prohibit an individual from growing marihuana, not for sale, much less for sale in interstate commerce but instead for his personal use, because this effects the interstate market for marijuana.  Only O’Connor and Thomas dissented.  The challengers to the constitutionality of the ACA’s individual-mandate provision have focused on the “compel” part; sure, the Congress can <i>prohibit activity</i> something under the Commerce Clause, but it can’t <i>compel activity</i> under the Commerce Clause.  But once you acknowledge that the failure to obtain health insurance impacts the interstate market for healthcare by directly impacting who pays the uninsureds’ emergency medical costs, you’ve pretty much conceded—logically, at least—that the Commerce Clause, assisted by the Necessary and Proper Clause, allows Congress to regulate this, irrespective of whether it does this by compelling the purchase of insurance or instead in some other way.  </p>
<p>This is true whether the acknowledger is the lawyer for the challengers to the constitutionality of the law or instead the judges hearing the case. </p>
<p>All three of the judges on that panel acknowledged the obvious: that the failure to obtain health insurance impacts the interstate market for healthcare by directly impacting who pays the uninsureds’ emergency medical costs.  And Clement didn’t deny it.  So much for, “It boils down to the question of whether the federal government can compel people into commerce to better regulate the individual.”  It boils down to that only if the federal government isn’t compelling people into commerce also to better regulate the healthcare-coverage market.  Most laws, federal as well as state and local ones—including the federal one at issue in <i>Raich</i>—regulate the individual.  Whether they better regulate the individual or not.</p>
<p>Clement understands this, of course, but also recognizes the need for a straw to grasp at other than the Commerce Clause one.  Thus the civil liberties straw, which the judges themselves offered the statute’s challengers even before Clement (who argued after the federal government’s lawyer, acting solicitor general Neal Katyal, did) began his argument: <br />
<blockquote>Marcus: “If they could compel this, what purchase could they not compel?” …</p>
<p>Dubina: “I can&#8217;t find any case like this. If we uphold this, are there any limits [on the power of the federal government]? …</p>
<p>Marcus: &#8220;I can&#8217;t find any case [in which the courts upheld the constitutionality of] telling a private person they are compelled to purchase a product in the open market&#8230;. Is there anything that suggests Congress can do this?&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, no, not precisely.  But there <i>are</i> Supreme Court cases that upheld what, for civil liberties purposes, amounts to the same thing.  They’re the cases that upheld the constitutionality of the Social Security Act and the Medicare Act by allowing the government to compel contributions to these separate funds, which are not part of the general tax revenue fund (OK, in theory, anyway), for the sole purpose of insuring a retirement income and health insurance for those over age 65.  True, the specific “enumerated” Constitutional authority Congress used to enact those laws was the taxing power, not the commerce-regulation power.  But that matters only if the commerce-regulation power isn’t broad enough to reach this.  If it is—and under Supreme Court precedent, it is, if the failure to have health insurance significantly impacts the healthcare market, which it does—then this distinction is without a difference.  You know.  A <i>meaningful</i> (or as lawyers say, a <i>material</i>) difference. </p>
<p>In questioning Katyal, the judges were asking for a so-called “limiting principle,” a logical line beyond which federal regulatory authority cannot go.  But if the issue is individual liberty, is it really logical to have that line depend on whether the compelled payment is for a product in the open market rather than for a similar product issued by the government?  Isn’t the civil liberties issue really what the goal and effect are?  That’s certainly the issue in most civil-liberties challenge to the constitutionality of a statute.  Why isn’t it, here?</p>
<p>Blowing away the smokescreen erected by the focus on the individual-mandate provision’s use of private insurance—and isn’t it just a smokescreen, really?—why does this infringe on liberty more than the Social Security and Medicare taxes do? </p>
<p>The bottom line, in my opinion, is that the Commerce Clause gives Congress the power to regulate, <i>including</i> the power to compel, without infringing on civil liberties, if what Congress is compelling is what it could compel through its taxing power, without infringing on civil liberties.  Congress couldn’t (to use the conservatives’ preferred example) compel Americans, via the tax code, to eat broccoli.  Or to buy it.  That pretty clearly would violate substantive due process rights, a.k.a. individual liberty rights, even if under the taxing power Congress otherwise would have that authority.  But Congress could, for example, extend Medicare to all Americans and amend the Medicare tax law to pay for it, without violating the Constitution’s individual-liberty guarantees.  </p>
<p>That’s the limiting principle.  At least it should be.</p>

<p>In his May 8 article about Wednesday’s oral argument in the 11th Circuit in the ACA case in which Paul Clement is representing 26 states in challenging the constitutionality of the statute, New York Times reporter Kevin Sack wrote that those states are paying Clement $250,000 to handle the appeal in that court and eventually in the Supreme Court.  </p>
<p>That’s a stunning amount, even though the amount each state will pay is relatively small.  These are two appeals in a single case that involves, entirely, arguments of law.  There is no trial transcript, nor trial-court orders on motions, nor volumes of business records—the things that usually raise appellate legal fees to astronomical heights.  And the legal arguments are the standard ones being discussed ad nauseam in legal circles.  Clement’s hourly fee on this will turn out to be something close to $1,000, I’d bet. </p>
<p>Maybe lines like, “It boils down to the question of whether the federal government can compel people into commerce to better regulate the individual,” as he told the panel on Wednesday, makes this guy worth his price.  But if so, it’s only because the judges will assume that since he’s Paul Clement rather than, say, another lawyer, that line makes sense.</p>

<p><strong>New wrinkles in the ACA litigation – Part II</strong> </p>
<p>Okay, well, now y’all know from reading <a target="_blank" href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/05/more-on-activityinactivity-canard-in.html">Part I</a> that under the Constitution’s Article III requirement that plaintiffs in lawsuits have some “particularized” (and ya know what that means, from reading Part I) injury or be in imminent danger of suffering one, and that the imminent danger can, theoretically, be hardship due to the anticipated violation of the plaintiffs’ rights. So you’ll be able to sail right through the federal-court-jurisdiction questions in the Civil Procedure section of the multi-state part of the bar exam.  </p>
<p>You’ll also be able to understand what happened last Friday in the ACA case scheduled for oral argument on Wednesday in the Sixth Circuit federal appellate court.  <br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>The case is <i>Thomas More Law Center, et al. v. Obama</i>.  Thomas More Law Center is a rightwing organization whose purpose is to challenge the constitutionality of laws or government policies or government actions against a particular individual that the far right finds offensive. Almost always, the underlying cause is a culture-wars issue, although sometimes the immediate issue being litigated is a more general procedural or constitutional-rights issue.  </p>
<p>For example, a few weeks ago, a friend asked me whether I would be willing to advise a Thomas More lawyer on a procedural issue concerning access to federal court for a couple who are my friend’s friends and who are entwined in a legal morass stemming from their protests at an abortion clinic, for which they were prosecuted.  My friend knows I know <i>loads</i> about the procedural issue, known as the <i>Rooker-Feldman</i>doctrine, an absurd Supreme Court-created bar to access to federal court in order to challenge the constitutionality of state-court actions.  I was happy to oblige, partly because this couple’s due process rights, <i>were</i>, in my opinion, violated, and partly because that doctrine <i>itself</i> violates the Fourteenth Amendment.  On March 7, in an opinion called <i>Skinner v. Switzer</i>, the Supreme Court finally killed the doctrine, or tried to; because <i>Skinner</i> does not expressly say, “We overrule <i>Dist. of Columbia Ct. of App. v. Feldman</i>,” the 1983 opinion that created the doctrine on the basis of the Court’s interpretation of a statute that was amended in 1986 to remove the part of that statute that the Court was interpreting, some of the lower federal courts are ignoring <i>Skinner</i>.  Just as I’d predicted on Mar. 7 when I read the opinion.  </p>
<p>But I digress.  </p>
<p>The <i>et al.</i> are four individuals who are members of the Thomas More organization. (It’s apparently an organization that has a membership, like the NAACP, the ACLU and the NRA, rather than just a law firm.)  The organization’s standing to sue is derivative of its members’ standing—the ones that do have standing, that is, and only the members who actually will be forced by the ACA to buy health insurance or pay the penalty even arguably have standing.  Turns out that the only one of the individual plaintiffs who, at least from the plaintiffs’ earlier filings, claimed that injury and provided specifics about it—that she did not have health insurance and that the $700 per month she said she would have to pay under the ACA would cause her significant financial hardship—actually bought health insurance through her employer last October, after the lower-court decision, for less than $400.  The plaintiffs revealed this in their response to the court’s briefing request, which they filed last Wednesday. </p>
<p>Two of the other four individuals are not even claiming a lack of health insurance and therefore any injury from the mandate.  The other one—his name is Steven Hyder—has claimed that the mandate “negatively impacts me now because I will have to reorganize my affairs and essentially change the way I live to meet the government’s demands,” but he provided no specifics. </p>
<p>Voila!  On Friday, the government filed a motion asking the court to dismiss the appeal because, the government said, no plaintiff has standing to litigate this because no plaintiff has shown that he or she would suffer an injury from the mandate.  Hyder&#8217;s claim, the government says, is a mere conclusory statement; without facts supporting the conclusion, it’s not enough to establish standing.  And the others clearly haven’t established standing. And, because the trial-level judge, who is based in the Eastern District of Michigan, ruled that the ACA is constitutional, the government wants the appellate court not to “vacate” (hold null and void) that judge’s ruling, an action that normally the appellate court would do in such a circumstance.  </p>
<p>The government’s request that the appellate court dismiss the appeal yet leave the trial judge’s ruling intact strikes me as pointless.  Yes, the plaintiff who voluntarily bought health insurance in October did have standing when the lawsuit was filed and when the trial judge issued his ruling last summer.  But trial-court rulings have no effect except in the case in which the ruling was issued.  They don’t even set the law in that court’s own judicial district.  That ruling, if it remains in effect although the appeal is dismissed, probably wouldn’t even effect the rights of these plaintiffs—most significantly, of course, the Thomas More Law Center—because they were denied the right to an appeal. </p>
<p>At the oral argument on Wednesday, or before that in a filed response to the government’s motion, the Thomas More lawyers will get specific about the basis for Hyder’s claim of financial hardship and about whether the other two individuals now have health insurance. If they all have health insurance, then, the mandate won’t cause them financial hardship or, irrespectively of finances, force them to do something they don’t want to do.  They don’t have standing.  </p>
<p>But, assuredly, some plaintiff in some other ACA case does.  Or will.</p>

                                <p>by <strong>Beverly Mann</strong></p>
<p>Last week, one of the law blogs I read regularly mentioned a post from May 11 on a law blog read regularly by a lot of law geeks (but not by me) about the oral argument in those cases a day earlier.  The blog is The Volokh Conspiracy.  Its bloggers are prominent rightwing or libertarian-right law profs, most of whom once were law clerks to a conservative Supreme Court justice.  This particular post was by Georgetown law prof. Randy Barnett, who is a veritable font of rightwing legal theory and suggestions for rightwing laws and legal arguments. </p>
<p>He also is, from what I can tell, the farthest right of that blog’s bloggers. Earlier this year, one of the big, big names on that blog, Orin Kerr, wrote that he was pretty darned certain that under the Supreme Court’s Commerce Clause and Necessary and Proper Clause rulings, the ACA was constitutional.  One of the other bloggers there—probably Barnett, but I don’t recall—disputed that. <br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Anyway, in his May 11 post, Barnett recounted an exchange between acting Solicitor General Neal Katyal, who was arguing the appeal on behalf of the government, and panel judge Diana Gribbon Motz, a Clinton appointee.   To refresh your memory from two weeks ago, all three of the panel members are Dem appointees, the other two of them appointed by Obama. Also to refresh your memory, the main challenge to the constitutionality of the ACA is that the Constitution’s Commerce Clause does not give Congress the authority to regulate inactivity.  To which the government has responded that the decision to not buy health insurance and to instead rely upon the largess of the government, hospitals and ultimately those who do pay health insurance premiums to get emergency medical treatment, is activity.  And that in any event, under the Supreme Court’s longtime Commerce Clause jurisprudence, that Clause coupled with the Necessary and Proper Clause gives Congress the power to regulate markets and that therefore there is no activity/inactivity distinction for Commerce Clause purposes.   </p>
<p>The Commerce Clause gives Congress the power, in the Constitution’s precise words, “To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes”.</p>
<p>In his post, Barnett pointed out something that was not in the other reports I’d read about the oral arguments: that in a lengthy exchange with Katyal, Motz indicated that she buys the activity/non-activity distinction, because she believes the definition of the word “regulate” means “regulate activity.”  She kept insisting that if the failure to buy health insurance is inactivity rather than activity, then, under her understanding of the definition of the word “regulate,” Congress couldn’t regulate it. </p>
<p>Katyal flubbed the response to this.  Partly.  He noted the Supreme Court’s most recent relevant Commerce Clause/Necessary and Proper Clause decision, Gonzales v. Raich, a 2005 opinion that held that the federal statute enacted under the Commerce Clause powers that criminalizes the growing and use of marijuana applies even to homegrown marijuana that is not sold even intrastate, much less in interstate commerce, and that is just for the personal use of the grower.  The rationale: that even those actions impact the interstate market for marijuana.  Since the Commerce Clause gives Congress the authority to regulate interstate markets, Congress can, under the Necessary and Proper Clause, regulate things that otherwise cannot be regulated under the Commerce power if those things impact the interstate market.  </p>
<p>Motz, though, missed the point. Growing marijuana is an activity, she pointed out, so how is Raich relevant to whether Congress can, under the Commerce Clause together with the Necessary and Proper Clause, regulate inactivity?  Well, um, maybe that what’s relevant isn’t the particular reason why the Commerce Clause alone isn’t enough and must be aided by the Necessary and Proper Clause, but instead that if something—whether activity only within a state’s boundary, or instead inactivity, or instead whatever—impacts a market that Congress has the power under the Commerce Clause to regulate, then Congress has the constitution authority to regulate it as necessary and proper under the Commerce Clause.</p>
<p>Katyal apparently was too dumbfounded to explain this.  According to a report I read, he was assigned to handle those oral arguments only a two or three days before the date of the arguments, and that might be one reason; the top person at the Solicitor General’s office normally personally only does that in the Supreme Court (and then, rarely).  </p>
<p>A day or two after those oral arguments, Obama’s nomination of  a man named Donald Verrilli to replace Elena Kagan as Solicitor General was voted out of committee. It’s scheduled for a full vote in the Senate on June 6. Here’s some of what the New York Times said about Verrilli’s background last January when Obama nominated him:<br />
<blockquote>Before joining the administration (in 2009), Mr. Verrilli spent two decades as a prominent litigator with the law firm of Jenner &#038; Block, where he was chairman of its Supreme Court practice group, while also teaching First Amendment law as an adjunct professor at Georgetown law school.</p>
<p>He participated in more than 100 Supreme Court cases and argued 12 of them. He has also argued about 35 times before federal appeals courts and state supreme courts.</p></blockquote>
<p>Verrilli won’t be arguing the Sixth Circuit ACA-case appeal there on June 1.  But presumably, he’ll be arguing the upcoming ACA appeals in the other federal appellate courts-including the two in the Eleventh Circuit, one of which is the most high-profile one nationally because the lower-court judge, Roger Vinson, pronounced the entire ACA unconstitutional, the other in which the lower-court judge ruled the entire statute constitutional. And he’ll eventually defend the statute’s constitutionality in the Supreme Court. Enough said.  I’m pretty sure of it.  </p>
<p>By which I mean that the case will be argued for the government as sharply and expertly as the cases will be argued for the other side by former Bush Solicitor General Paul Clement, who, now in private practice, was retained to represent the statute-challengers in the Roger Vinson case in the Eleventh Circuit. Unless, of course, Verrilli’s nomination is filibustered.</p>

<p><strong>The Difference Between Defending DOMA and Defending Neo-Nazis and the ACA</strong></p>
<p>A post via <a href="http://legaltimes.typepad.com/blt/2011/05/king-spalding-offers-new-details-on-marriage-mess.html" target="_blank">Blog of Legal Times</a> on Wednesday titled “King &#038; Spalding Offers New Details on Marriage Mess,” which summarizes a report that day in one of its sister ALM (American Law Media) publications, the Atlanta-based <a href="http://www.dailyreportonline.com/Editorial/News/singleEdit.asp?origin=NewsFile&#038;l=nf1138316" target="_blank"><em>Daily Report Online</em></a> by staffer Meredith Hobbs begins (subscription needed):</p>
<p>
<blockquote>The head of King &#038; Spalding&#8217;s Washington office is accepting blame for what he calls the &#8220;misunderstanding&#8221; that led the firm last month to accept, and then drop, the U.S. House of Representatives as a client in same-sex marriage litigation.</p></blockquote>
<p>(Rdan&#8230;slight corrections for readability and sourcing original material)<br /><a name="more"></a><br />King &#038; Spalding is a mega-law-firm based in Atlanta that in late 2008 won the derby to hire Paul Clement, Bush’s solicitor general since 2005 who had left the Justice Dept. in June 2008, to head its Supreme Court and appellate division.  The deal involved a reported $5 million signing bonus, well worth the price because petitions (known as “cert.” petitions) asking the Supreme Court to agree to hear the case, when filed on behalf of clients by former Justice Dept. solicitors general—the Office of Solicitor General is the division of the Justice Dept. that argues cases before the Supreme Court on behalf of the United States—are guaranteed to actually be read by the justices, and the Court is more likely to grant the petition to hear the case even than petitions filed by former law clerks to Supreme Court justices.  Which is saying quite a bit, because former law clerks to Supreme Court justices now hold a near-monopoly on getting private clients’ cert. petitions granted.  </p>
<p>Clement, in keeping with modern tradition for former solicitors general, is a two-fer.  He clerked for Scalia for a year after clerking the year before—his first year out of law school—for a lower federal appellate judge, a de facto prerequisite to a Supreme Court clerkship.  So he’s really, really valuable to clients who want their cert. petitions read by justices, and granted.  And to law firms that want to be known as a “presence” at the Court.</p>
<p>The referenced marriage mess is that last month, after the Obama administration announced that it (i.e., the Solicitor General’s office) would not be defending the constitutionality of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which defines marriage as between a man and a woman, against lawsuits challenging the statute’s constitutionality, a group of Republican House members hired Clement to represent them in defending the statute’s constitutionality, notwithstanding that they’re not parties to these lawsuits. But Clement signed the retainer contract without first getting authorization from the firm’s five-member committee that vets potential new clients and cases.  And the contract itself contained an unusual and weird clause, now infamously known in legal-pundit circles as the “gag” provision, barring employees of the firm—attorneys, staff members and, I guess, the mailroom folks and couriers—from speaking ill of the statute.  </p>
<p>When mass mutiny, by firm employees and corporate firm clients, including longtime client Coca-Cola (virtually all of the firm’s clients are corporations), threatened, upon the public announcement of the firm’s representation, escalating in intensity after the gag provision was disclosed, the firm announced that it would attempt to withdraw from the representation.  The firm said the prospective representation hadn’t been submitted through the firm’s normal channels and hadn’t been vetted, and that, had it been, the firm would have declined the case.  Clement, in turn, saying he had been led to believe that the firm supported the representation, resigned from the firm, saying that he could not ethically withdraw his representation.  He joined a small firm comprised mostly of former Bush administration War on Terrorism veterans.</p>
<p>He then issued a public statement, seconded by several legal pundits, including some, such as Slate’s Dahlia Lithwick, whom I admire and whose writings I usually agree with, argued that it sets a dangerous precedent for a law firm to succumb to public pressure to decline to represent (or, as here, to withdraw from representation of) an unpopular client or an unpopular cause.  </p>
<p>I’ve admired Clement himself, actually.  As solicitor general, he was not an automatic supporter of rightwing legal positions when the Supreme Court, as is its custom, would ask the Solicitor General’s office for its view on whether the Court should agree to hear a particular case, usually concerning interpretation of a federal statute, in a case in which the federal government is not a party.  The solicitor general is not the one who makes the final decision on this; the attorney general and sometimes the president himself is, if the issue is important ideologically or for, say, law enforcement purposes.  But in cases in which it seems likely that the decision was left up to Clement, he didn’t always favor the conservative position.  </p>
<p>In one important access-to-court case, for example, Winkelman v. Parma City School District, Clement filed a brief in support of a cert. petition filed by the parents of an autistic child who tried, without retaining counsel, to sue their local school district on their son’s behalf asking for injunctive relief to force the district to comply with a particular provision of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act that the parents said the district was ignoring.  The issue was whether the parents could “represent” their son in the lawsuit or whether instead they must hire a lawyer to that, rendering the right to sue dependent on the family’s ability to pay substantial legal fees.  The Court, probably persuaded partly by Clement’s brief, agreed to hear the case, and, then probably influenced by Clement’s friend of court brief after the Court agreed to hear the case, ruled for the parents and their son.  The opinion has implications for similar access to court by, say, elderly adults “represented” as “next friend” by one of their adult children, and asking for injunctive relief under various laws.</p>
<p>And in another case involving access to court by the non-wealthy, Clement, during his King &#038; Spalding years, argued—unsuccessfully—in favor of possible higher contingent compensation from losing governments under certain circumstances, under a federal statute that requires a losing government in a constitutional civil rights case to pay fair-value attorneys’ fees to the lawyer who represented the plaintiff.  Currently, he is among the lawyers representing a group of California state prisoners before the Supreme Court in a case in which the prisoners won on their claim for injunctive relief in the lower federal courts, claiming that California’s decades-long, extreme overcrowding in their prisons caused a lack of adequate health care so severe that it resulted in numerous deaths, in violation of the Eleventh Amendment’s prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment.  </p>
<p>And Clement’s not just a “name.”  Judging from journalists’ reports on his recent high-profile oral arguments at the Court, he strikes me as brilliant analytically, and he’s wonderfully quick-witted.  </p>
<p>So I was disappointed when a few weeks before the DOMA controversy broke, it was announced that he would be representing the challengers to the Affordable Care Act’s constitutionality on appeal in the case in which a federal trial-court judge in Florida pronounced the entire statute unconstitutional earlier this year.  It’s not that the Supreme Court justices will actually cast their vote based on any argument that has not already been made and thoroughly dissected.  But if anyone can make a Supreme Court majority vote to strike down this law as unconstitutional seem like anything but Bush v. Gore redux, it is Clement. </p>
<p>But my disappointment about his representation of the ACA challengers is just a personal one.  After all, in the ACA case, he’s playing a standard role as counsel, representing clients who claim that Congress exceeded its constitutional authority and that the result violates their individual rights.  </p>
<p>In fact, the classic examples used to skewer King &#038; Spalding’s action in the marriage mess all are of cases in which the lawyer is attempting to help an unpopular individual or group vindicate a constitutional right—the right of an accused mass murderer to a fair trial; the First Amendment right of neo-Nazis to march through Skokie, Illinois, then home to a substantial number of Holocaust survivors; recently, the claimed First Amendment right of the members of that absurd Kansas-based church to protest gay rights by parading at the funerals of soldiers killed in action in Iraq or Afghanistan, holding signs saying that the death was god’s retribution.  (E.g., “Thank God for dead soldiers.”) </p>
<p>But every time I read a new contribution to the body of literature on the marriage mess, I wonder momentarily whether Clement’s decision to represent the group of House members, and the law firm’s decision to remove itself from that representation, really are the equivalent of, say, the ACLU lawyers who represented the neo-Nazis in the Skokie-march case and the people who thought the ACLU should not have represented them.  </p>
<p>The neo-Nazis’ own cause, the message they wanted to spread, was abhorrent, but the cause the lawyers were championing was free speech.  Clement, in his public statement, said his own opinion about the propriety of the DOMA as statutory policy is irrelevant (and sort of hinted that he personally doesn’t favor that legislation).  And he’s right, of course; all that’s at issue is whether the statute is constitutional.  </p>
<p>But I think he’s wrong that there’s no distinction between a lawyer’s representation of a party whose rights are at issue and a non-government lawyer’s representation of a group of members of Congress in order to defend the constitutionality of a law whose intended effect is to constrain the rights of others.  What’s different is, first, that legal representation of members of Congress who are claiming that a statute is constitutional is more like a legislative or lobbying act than legal representation of a client.  That’s true even when the purpose of the statute at issue isn’t to limit others’ rights.  And, second, when, as here, the sole purpose of the statute is to limit others’ rights, it’s really not equivalent to representation of a party who’s own rights are at issue and whose case might, if that party is successful in the litigation, expand the rights of others.</p>
<p>I don’t suggest that there is something wrong with Clement’s decision to accept the case.  What I do suggest is that the decision was more freighted with substance than the quick analogies suggest, and that King &#038; Spalding was not wrong to view it that way.</p>
