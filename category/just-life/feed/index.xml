				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> Just watch this.  It is 1 minute long.<br />Update: added a couple links* </p>
<p>Could it be anymore surreal?</p>
<p>This was from an episode which aired May 12th, 1992!  I asked <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2008/09/can-we-please-broaden-our-thinking-in.html" target="_blank">September 2008</a>:   HOW MANY TIMES DO WE HAVE TO DO THIS?  HOW MANY FREAKIN’ TIMES DO WE HAVE TO LEARN THE LESSON?</p>
<p> Obviously, the lesson has not been relearned since at least sometime before 1992.  If it had been <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2009/05/there-is-difference-between-then-and.html" target="_blank">relearned,</a> we would not be here still proposing solutions that sound just like, almost word for word <a href="http://www.taxhistory.org/www/website.nsf/Web/THM1901?OpenDocument" target="_blank">like the 1920&#8217;s.</a>  (start reading at 1920) I mean, it&#8217;s not like <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2008/04/longest-recession-ever.html" target="_blank">people haven&#8217;</a>t been<a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2007/12/its-big-one-honey-i-know-it.html" target="_blank"> sounding the horn</a> on what <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/01/i-got-your-real-state-of-union-right.html" target="_blank">the results </a>would be from the<a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/06/monetary-policy-im-not-only-not-feeling.html" target="_blank"> proposed solutions</a> in 1992.   Nope, it&#8217;s the <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/07/wages-driven-down-now-relative-to.html" target="_blank">same proposals</a> as in 1992, which will produce more of the same.</p>
<p>*In case you are having a problem, here is the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlEcbVdCJWg&#038;list=HL1364253320&#038;feature=mh_lolz" target="_blank">full show.</a> The clip part starts at 1:34.<br />*This is <a href="http://www.tubechop.com/watch/1052427" target="_blank">the link for</a> the clip I made that is posted above.</p>

<li>Excess Rents Datapoint of the Day: Since the NYT doesn&#8217;t pay Paul Krugman for <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/">his blog posts</a>, why should reading those count as part of the &#8220;20 free articles&#8221; non-subscribers are allowed?</p>
</li>
<li>I want <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20110512/en_nm/us_pinkfloyd">the Grapelli track</a>, but not enough to pay for a six-CD set.
</li>
<li><a href="http://www.loc.gov/jukebox/">This</a>—built by government employees—is the greatest accomplishment in music since Alan Lomax.
</li>
<li>And, for fun, via <a href="http://tomdup.wordpress.com/">my buddy Tom</a>, <a href="http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/idahostatesman/obituary.aspx?n=ellen-mcgarr&#038;pid=150429149">the best obituary you&#8217;ll read today</a>.
</li>
<li>Bleg of the Day: Anyone have a good source or sources on the structures, organizations, and operations of the old &#8220;Tea Companies&#8221;?  Have been thinking about bubbles, and Tea Companies seems to be the Goldman Sachs of the pre-20th century: always in the middle of the problems, but treated reverentially in the histories.
<p>And, in the Posts I Plan to Write Soon category: </p>

Maybe it&#8217;s not &#8220;Is Economics a Science,&#8221; but rather &#8220;Is Economics a Discipline.&#8221;  More to come on this.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I don&#8217;t remember seeing any of this type of story last year. But this year, Socialism stories abound from the Midwest.</p>
<p>My ex-roommate* sends this link to <a href="http://www.nbc.com/news-sports/msnbc-video/town-rallies-to-send-players-family-to-final-four/">a story about Butler Bulldogs&#8217;s Senior Matt Howard&#8217;s family being able to attend the NCAA Finals tonight in Houston</a> (video link <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21134540/vp/42390985#42390985">here</a>).<br /><a name="more"></a><br />Luke Winn of Sports Illustrated <a href="http://tourney.si.com/2011/04/01/conversations-with-connersville-ind/">covered the macro territory</a>. The 12.7% unemployment rate, up from a few years ago and still 2nd-highest in the state of the 92 counties. The population of &#8220;about 13,000,&#8221; which puts the decline since I graduated high school at worse-than-Detroit levels—but that makes sense since most of the factory work over the previous forty years was Ford-related as the town once referred to as &#8220;Little Detroit&#8221; lost competitors to larger areas and consolidation.</p>
<p>Winn&#8217;s article, not to mention <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/dc-sports-bog/post/butlers-matt-howard-is-a-bike-riding-minimalist/2011/03/17/ABbTlGm_blog.html">several</a> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/26/sports/ncaabasketball/26howard.html">other</a> recent pieces about Howard&#8217;s childhood make it clear that it really does take a village. From the NYT piece:<br />
<blockquote>His mother, Linda, who credited her faith for helping her raise 10 children, said strangers would stop and ask, &#8220;Are you the lady with all the kids?&#8221; before dropping off bags of clothes. &#8220;Maybe everything didn&#8217;t fit,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But we didn&#8217;t complain.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Bryan Caplan&#8217;s noted in <a href="http://www/kauffman.org/KauffmanMultimedia.aspx?VideoId=876788042001&#038;type=R">his presentation at Kauffman</a> that he knows no one who is liquidity-constrained in their ability to raise children; rather, it&#8217;s time allocation that stops them. I suspect he needs to get out more.</p>
<p>And now the city with 12.7% unemployment and a dim future has once again reached into its collective pockets to make certain that Matt Howard&#8217;s family gets to see their son&#8217;s/brother&#8217;s final college game, which also happens to be for the NCAA Championship.</p>
<p>From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs.</p>
<p>As I said, I didn&#8217;t see stories like this last year. Last year, there was still another year for Howard and the Bulldogs. Now, there is no possible future NCAA Championship; this is the last time this can ever happen. An economist would tell you that people recognized the Scarcity Value and dug into their pockets accordingly.</p>
<p>So not only did it take a Village to help as best they could to raise the ten Howard children, it took a Village to enable the family to go to Houston to see now-senior Matt Howard and the rest of the Butler Bulldogs play—win or lose; I hope win—for the NCAA Championship.</p>
<p><em>Ex ante</em>, it&#8217;s a great decision. <em>Ex post</em>, it will still have been one.</p>
<p>Musical accompaniment: <a href="http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/Thank-You-Connersville-Indiana-lyrics-Tom-T-Hall/DD57A8FD8C91685348256E2A002D08BD">Tom T. Hall</a>, of course.</p>
<p>*For whom <a href="http://innovationandgrowth.wordpress.com/">Mike Mandel</a> took a picture of Tyler and Natasha Cowen at last week&#8217;s Kauffman Economic Bloggers Forum, since he and Tyler were once ranked (by Tyler) as the #1 and #2 chess players in the area. Sadly, neither went into the sport as a full-time professional.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I give up. It was perfectly obvious what was happening at Fukushima on Saturday afternoon, when I <a href="http://xnerg.blogspot.com/2011/03/basic-reminders-of-nuclear-power.html">posted bullet points at Skippy</a>: there was going to be a major cleanup cost and the live reactors were not salvageable, but nothing fatal to many was loose in the atmosphere yet.</p>
<p>Which is why I followed up here on Sunday with &#8220;<a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/03/tradeoffs-saltwater-edition.html">use saltwater as the best option</a>.&#8221; Once you accept that you&#8217;re doing damage control, do it efficiently and don&#8217;t worry about the sunk cost.</p>
<p>But evacuation and problems with all three plants that were offline at the time of the earthquake moves to stage seven,  which was summarized by Pink Floyd:<br />

</p>
<p>Though even that may be pessimistic; Al Jazzera English (via their Twitter feed) reports that <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/asia-pacific/2011/03/201131635745664299.html#">the heroes of this entire episode</a>—the unnamed workers who are trying to avert serious leakage into the environment—are back at work after having temporarily been evacuated to a bunker.</p>
