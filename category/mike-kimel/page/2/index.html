<p>Wrong v. Mark Steyn Wrong</p>
<p>Every so often I come across one or another columnist or tv personality making some</p>
<p>Steyn&#8217;s latest!  ( <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/337490/obamacare-s-other-shoe-mark-steyn">Mark Steyn</a> )<br />
<blockquote>If you had buttonholed me in the Senate men’s room circa 2003 and told me that a decade hence Joe Biden would be America’s vice president, John Kerry secretary of state, and Chuck Hagel secretary of defense, I’d have laughed and waited for the punch line</p></blockquote>
<p>I get it.  Steyn is telling us his powers of prognostication are very poor.  Its commendable, albeit odd, of him to warn his readers, but we should check to make sure it is more than false modesty on his part. Since  he discusses his forecasts circa 2003, let&#8217;s check that out. What was he writing circa 2003?  This <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/3589977/Movers-and-shakers-have-moved-on-to-the-next-disaster.html">article</a> is one of the first things that comes up in a Google search of Mark Steyn&#8217;s writings from 2003, and the first with any forecasts.  It begins:</p>
<blockquote><p>On to the next quagmire! Don&#8217;t get mired in the bog of yesterday&#8217;s conventional wisdom, when the movers and shakers have already moved on to new disasters. America may have won the war but it&#8217;s already losing the peace! Here&#8217;s your at-a-glance guide to what the experts who got everything wrong last week will be getting wrong next week</p></blockquote>
<p>Sounds promising, doesn&#8217;t it?   Here is his first point:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Iraq&#8217;s slide into violent anarchy&#8221; (Guardian, April 11). Say what you like about Saddam, but he ran a tight ship and you didn&#8217;t have to nail down your nest of tables: since the Brits took over, Basra&#8217;s property crime is heading in an alarmingly Cheltenhamesque direction. MBITRW (Meanwhile Back In The Real World): A year from now, Basra will have a lower crime rate than most London boroughs.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let&#8217;s see&#8230; a year and nine days after this article appeared, a series of car bombs went off in Basra.  74 people were killed, over 100 injured.  Just like the East End, Mark Steyn might say.  And since we&#8217;re talking about the British, here are a few entries from a <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-14546763">BBC</a> <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-14546763">timeline</a> looking at the rest of the country:</p>
<blockquote><p>2004 March &#8211; Suicide bombers attack Shia festival-goers in<br />Karbala and Baghdad, killing 140 people.</p>
<p>2004 April-May &#8211; Shia militias loyal to radical cleric Moqtada Sadr<br />take on coalition forces.</p>
<p>Hundreds are reported killed in fighting during the month-long US military siege of the Sunni Muslim city of Falluja.</p></blockquote>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>But back to Basra, and a story in the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/06/AR2007080601401.html">Washington</a> <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/06/AR2007080601401.html">Post some years later</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>But &#8220;it&#8217;s hard now to paint Basra as a success story,&#8221; said a senior U.S. official in Baghdad with long experience in the south. Instead, it has become a different model, one that U.S. officials with experience in the region are concerned will be<br />replicated throughout the Iraqi Shiite homeland from Baghdad to the Persian Gulf. A recent series of war games commissioned by the Pentagon also warned of civil war among Shiites after a reduction in U.S. forces.</p>
<p>For the past four years, the administration&#8217;s narrative of the Iraq war has centered on al-Qaeda, Iran and the sectarian violence they have promoted. But in the homogenous south &#8212; where there are virtually no U.S. troops or al-Qaeda fighters, few Sunnis, and by most accounts limited influence by Iran &#8212; Shiite militias fight one another as well as British troops. A British strategy launched last fall to reclaim Basra neighborhoods from violent actors &#8212; similar to the current U.S. strategy in Baghdad &#8212; brought no lasting success.</p>
<p>&#8220;The British have basically been defeated in the south,&#8221; a senior U.S. intelligence official said recently in Baghdad. They are abandoning their former headquarters at Basra Palace, where a recent official visitor from London described them as &#8220;surrounded like cowboys and Indians&#8221; by militia fighters. An airport base outside the city, where a regional U.S. Embassy office and Britain&#8217;s remaining 5,500 troops<br />are barricaded behind building-high sandbags, has been attacked with mortars or rockets nearly 600 times over the past four months.</p></blockquote>
<p>So I think we can safely say that either Steyn is woefully ignorant of British crime statistics, or we can safely say his first forecast in his article was spectacularly wrong.</p>
<p>Steyn moved on:</p>
<blockquote><p>2) &#8220;The head of the World Food Programme has warned thatIraq could spiral into a massive humanitarian disaster&#8221; (Australian, April 11). MBITRW: No such disaster will occur, any more than it did during the mythical &#8220;brutal Afghan winter&#8221; and its attendant humanitarian scaremongering. </p></blockquote>
<p>Steyn must have been disappointed that the <a href="http://www.who.int/disasters/repo/15107.pdf">World Health Organization was still &#8220;scaremongering&#8221; a year later</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Insufficient food intake endangers the  nutritional status of a large part of the population increasing morbidity and mortality due to communicable diseases. </p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.who.int/hac/crises/irq/background/Iraq_Health_in_Iraq_second_edition.pdf">A lot</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>As indicated before, the situation of food safety seems to be serious. In three quarters of districts, the local manufactured food stuff did not meet the standard specifications. In more than half of the districts there were imported food products which were considered unfit for human consumption. A survey conducted, by the<br />MOH, on food processing factories revealed that only 58% complied with food safety regulations.</p></blockquote>
<p>And perhaps you remember <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&#038;rct=j&#038;q=&#038;esrc=s&#038;source=web&#038;cd=1&#038;cad=rja&#038;ved=0CDIQFjAA&#038;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnn.com%2F2004%2FWORLD%2Fmeast%2F04%2F01%2Firaq.contractor%2F&#038;ei=RZz6UMDEG-We2wX96oD4BQ&#038;usg=AFQjCNGqH40IjcUws2SUXJuU-mnu-3mvrw&#038;sig2=5yEp_CcX4GIv8KRj0oR1XQ&#038;bvm=bv.41248874,d.aWM">this story</a>  from 2004:</p>
<blockquote><p>Blackwater Security Consulting &#8212; whose four employees were viciously killed and their corpses mutilated by a mob in Fallujah, Iraq &#8212; is one of a growing number of private security contractors that are hiring veterans for jobs previously assigned to<br />the military.</p>
<p>Those jobs include the protection of personnel working for private companies and non-government organizations in Iraq.</p>
<p>They provide very focused security for detailing out how a protectee&#8217;s day occurs &#8212; from the beginning of the morning until they tuck that person back into bed at night,&#8221; said CNN national security analyst Ken Robinson, &#8220;whether that be an NGO trying to conduct operations trying to provide food or water or support to the<br />population.</p>
<p>The four men killed Wednesday were providing security for a convoy delivering U.S. government food.</p></blockquote>
<p>Thus combining Steyn&#8217;s predictions 1 and 2 together in a medley of wrongness.</p>
<p>As a bonus, Steyn mentioned the food situation in Afghanistan. Clearly when he wrote this piece, he didn&#8217;t realize there are different kinds of predictions.  One type involves absolute statements:  &#8220;X will happen&#8221; or &#8220;Y will not happen.&#8221;  Examples<br />include:  &#8220;A year from now, Basra will have a lower crime rate than most London boroughs&#8221; or &#8220;No such disaster will occur.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then there are statements that call for action, that either flat out state or imply &#8220;If we don&#8217;t act, then Z.&#8221;  I&#8217;m guessing the World Food Program&#8217;s worries about the food situation in Afghanistan fall under the latter category.  Here&#8217;s a story from <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=23200#.UPfaySfEyVo">2007</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>WFP aims to supply over half a million metric tons of food<br />to 6.6 million people in Afghanistan yearly.</p></blockquote>
<p>Perhaps this is also just like London&#8217;s East End in Steyn&#8217;s version of reality.  And it seems that a decade later, the World Food Program is <a href="http://www.wfp.org/stories/preparing-winter-wfp-distributes-food-afghan-mountain-villages">still delivering food to Afghanistan.</a></p>
<p>So where are we at?  2 forecasts thus far, of which 2.5 of them wrong. (Yes, I do think he deserves to be dinged for the bit about Afghanistan.)</p>
<p>Steyn continued:</p>
<blockquote><p>3) &#8220;Iraqis Now Waiting for Americans to Leave&#8221; (AP, April 10). MBITRW: There will be terrible acts of suicide-bomber depravity in the months ahead, but no widespread resentment at or resistance of the Western military presence.</p></blockquote>
<p>A year later, though, the situation looked like <a href="http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/world/iraq/2004-04-28-poll-cover_x.htm">this</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>But while they acknowledge benefits from dumping Saddam a year ago, Iraqis no longer see the presence of the American-led military as a plus. Asked whether they view the U.S.-led coalition as &#8220;liberators&#8221; or &#8220;occupiers,&#8221; 71% of all respondents say &#8220;occupiers.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>No doubt to Steyn, the Iraqis meant &#8220;occupiers&#8221; in a positive way.<br />With ponies.  And unicorns.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s more:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the multiethnic Baghdad area, where a Gallup Poll last summer of 1,178 residents permits a valid comparison, only 13% of the people now say the invasion of Iraq was morally justifiable. In the 2003 poll, more than twice that number saw it as the right thing to do.</p>
<p>Americans regard their men and women in uniform as liberators who are trying to help Iraq. But the Iraqis now see them as a threat and focus their anger on them.</p>
<p>&#8220;When they pass by on the street, we are curious, so we go out to look and they immediately point their gun at you,&#8221; says Muia, the bicycle shop owner.</p>
<p>Except for the Kurds, such feelings are widely held. For example:</p>
<p>Two-thirds say soldiers in the U.S.-led coalition make no attempt to keep ordinary Iraqis from being killed or wounded during exchanges of gunfire.</p>
<p>58% say the soldiers conduct themselves badly or very badly.</p>
<p>60% say the troops show disrespect for Iraqi people in searches of their homes, and 42% say U.S. forces have shown disrespect toward mosques.</p>
<p>46% say the soldiers show a lack of respect for Iraqi women.</p>
<p>Only 11% of Iraqis say coalition forces are trying hard to restore basic services such as electricity and clean drinking water.</p></blockquote>
<p>Our talley on Steyn&#8217;s forecasts:  3 forecasts made, 3.5 big forecasting errors.</p>
<p>Steyn&#8217;s next forecast reads like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>4) &#8220;If Saddam is not found dead, or caught alive, it will be the worst of all possible closures for the war against Iraq. Bin Laden himself continues to elude capture&#8221; (Roland Flamini, UPI) MBITRW: Obviously, it would be preferable if the late Saddam&#8217;s future media appearances were confined to guest-hosting Good Morning, Hell! with Osama. But if he&#8217;s reduced to bin Laden&#8217;s current schedule &#8211; mailing in bi-monthly audio cassettes of Islamist boilerplate &#8211; what&#8217;s the difference? Even if he&#8217;d escaped to Syria, he&#8217;d be spending the rest of his days as a Bedouin goat-herd. Right now, Boy Assad is doing his best not to attract Rummy&#8217;s attention.</p></blockquote>
<p>Steyn gets this one right &#8211; Saddam didn&#8217;t play much of a role from that point forward.</p>
<p>So, four forecasts, 3.5 errors, 1 successful forecast.</p>
<p>Moving on to Steyn&#8217;s next forecast:</p>
<blockquote><p>5) &#8220;Iraq was a new country cobbled together from several former Ottoman provinces, its lines drawn by the Europeans&#8221; (Mark Mazower, Independent, April 7). It&#8217;s a phony state, you can never make a go of it. MBITRW: There&#8217;s nothing in the least bit &#8220;cobbled&#8221; about it. The three Ottoman vilayets of Mosul, Baghdad and Basra have been<br />bound together by geography and trade for millennia. As a coherent jurisdiction, it makes more sense than, say, Belgium. As long as you respect its inherently confederal nature, it&#8217;ll work fine: think St Kitts and Nevis writ large.</p></blockquote>
<p>As I understand it, the Iraqi constitution allows Iraqi Kurdistan to maintain its own military forces (the Peshmerga) and does not allow the military from the rest of Iraq to operate in Kurdish territory. So far, so &#8220;confederal&#8221; to quote Steyn.  But ten years on, there are still <a href="http://www.defence.pk/forums/arab-defence/220273-peshmerga-iraqi-army-clash-12-iraqi-soldiers-died.html">armed clashes between Kurdish and Iraqi forces with people getting killed</a>.  Sometimes they&#8217;re <a href="http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/politics/2012/11/iraqi-kurdish-army-clashes-end-but-tensions-remain-high.html">&#8220;misunderstandings&#8221;</a>, sometimes they&#8217;re territorial grabs, but one thing is certain:  the two forces remain <a href="http://www.rudaw.net/english/kurds/5011.html">eyeball to eyeball.</a></p>
<p>This is less St. Kitts and Nevis than Pakistan and India during a<br />particularly hot period.</p>
<p>Score &#8211; 5 forecasts, 4.5 errors, 1 success.</p>
<p>Steyn&#8217;s error roll rolls on:</p>
<blockquote><p>6) &#8220;Turkey is concerned that a Kurdish capture of Kirkuk could help bankroll moves to establish an independent Kurdistan&#8221; (AFP, April 9). MBITRW: Nothing to worry about. The Kurds are the only part of the indigenous population that were part of the liberation force from the start. They&#8217;re not going anywhere now. They&#8217;ll settle for<br />being Scotland or Quebec rather than Pakistan.</p></blockquote>
<p>Back to the whole &#8220;Kurdish forces clashing with the Iraqi military thing.&#8221; Unless things have picked up in Scotland or Quebec, Steyn gets this one wrong.  But I&#8217;ll give him half a point on a technicality &#8211; the Turks aren&#8217;t all that concerned that the Iraqi Kurds are formenting revolt in Turkish Kurdistan right now, largely because of the Iraqi Kurdish stand-off with the Iraqi military.  Actually, even that&#8217;s not true &#8211; here&#8217;s a story from <a href="http://www.almonitor.com/pulse/security/01/10/iraq-ejects-turkish-armed-forces.html">late 2011</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Already tense relations between Turkey and the Iraqi central government have now become critical following a decision made by Baghdad. Following the Turkish government’s request for parliamentary approval of cross-border operations by the Turkish military, Baghdad has decided to not to allow the Turkish army to enter Northern Iraq and to maintain its presence there.</p>
<p>In a meeting yesterday [Oct. 2], the Iraqi cabinet decided to annul all agreements that enabled the presence of foreign troops in Iraq. The decision will directly affect Turkey, which has been maintaining bases in Northern Iraq since the 1990s. Iraqi government spokesman Ali al-Dabbagh announced the move: “The government has decided to refuse the presence of foreign troops and bases on Iraqi soil. No foreign soldiers will be allowed to enter Iraqi territory. The government has advised the parliament to annul existing agreements and not to extend them.”</p></blockquote>
<p>And how&#8217;s that going now?  Well, <a href="http://www.al%20monitor.com/pulse/politics/2012/10/kurds-reject-malikis-demand-to-control-pesherga-militia.html">the Turks are still there</a> (and the Iraqis are still at it with the<br />Kurds):</p>
<blockquote><p>Maliki described the objections to the formation of the Tigris Operations Command as “unconstitutional, because the federal army has the right to have a presence in Basra or Zakho, and no one has the right to prevent it constitutionally. There are implicit<br />intentions and a lack of desire for the federal authority to have control or a presence.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said that the army “is more [entitled] than the Turkish troops to have a presence [in Iraq’s Kurdish region].”</p></blockquote>
<p>So giving half a point to Steyn and marking half a point against him is exceedingly generous,</p>
<p>That&#8217;s six forecasts, 5 errors, 1.5 successes.</p>
<p>Next:</p>
<blockquote><p>7) &#8220;Rather than reforming the Muslim world, the conquest of Iraq will inflame it&#8221; (Jeffrey Simpson, Toronto Globe and Mail, April 10). MBITRW: Effective immediately, Palestinian suicide bombers are no longer subsidised by Baghdad; in Jordan, the Saddamite boot is off the Hashemite windpipe; Syria is under notice to behave. Despite the best efforts of Western doom-mongers to rouse the Arab street, its attitude will remain: start the jihad without me.</p></blockquote>
<p>This one he got right.  The Arab Spring came way later.</p>
<p>Seven forecasts, 5 errors, 2.5 successes.</p>
<blockquote><p>8) &#8220;Looting is always unsavoury. Let&#8217;s hope the Americans don&#8217;t pilfer the oil&#8221; (Brenda Linane, Age of Melbourne, April 11). MBITRW: The pilfering of Iraq&#8217;s oil has just ended. Saddam parcelled his country&#8217;s wealth out to those companies willing to cosy up to him. The oil business will now be opened up to competitive tender. The only North American politician with a personal stake in any of this is not Bush, Cheney or any of their Texan oilpatch pals, but the Prime Minister of Canada, whose daughter is married to TotalFinaElf&#8217;s biggest shareholder. The liberation of Iraq is a victory for real markets over French cronyism.</p></blockquote>
<p>I am not sure anyone can know enough about the oil situation right now, except to say that the Kurds seem to be signing their own deals with oil companies which the Iraqi central government say is illegal. Depending on how one looks that, it could be &#8220;pilfering&#8221; or not.  I&#8217;ll give that one to Steyn rather than get into the weeds.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s eight forecasts, 5 errors, 3.5 successes.</p>
<p>Continuing.</p>
<blockquote><p>9) &#8220;Weapons of Mass Destruction. Remember them? Not a single one has yet been found&#8221; (Bill Neely, ITV, April 10). MBITRW: Actually, I almost wish this one were true. Anything that turns up now will be assumed to have been planted. If I were Washington, I&#8217;d consider burying anything I found. After all, an America that feels no need to bother faking justifications for invasion would be far more alarming to most Europeans. Instead, horrible things will turn up, but will never be &#8220;conclusive&#8221; enough for the French, who&#8217;ve got all the receipts anyway.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m not even sure what this means.  Best I can say, the &#8220;I almost wish this one were true&#8221; means Steyn feels WMDs were found.  I think we have to ding him for it.</p>
<p>With nine forecasts, he has 6 errors and 3.5 successes.</p>
<p>Saving the best for last, Steyn tells us:</p>
<blockquote><p>10) America is already losing the peace. MBITRW: In a year&#8217;s time, Iraq will be, at a bare minimum, the least badly governed state in the Arab world and, at best, pleasant, civilised and thriving. In short: not a bad three weeks&#8217; work.</p></blockquote>
<p>Despite the painted schoolhouses, I think even Steyn would admit this one was wrong putting him at 7 bad forecasts, 3.5 good forecasts.  Two bad forecasts for every good one.  Random guesses would have seriously outperformed the forecasts he made with such smug assurance on a topic on which, judging from Google,  Mr. Steyn felt qualified to expend a lot of ink.  And, don&#8217;t forget, we began with his admission that his ability to guess what is likely to happen in the US is completely off too.</p>
<p>Which raises the question &#8211; Steyn is a popular, very well paid columnist.  Is there anything on which he has pontificated in the past on which he&#8217;s been proven largely right?</p>

<p>The Problem with the Second Amendment<br />
<blockquote>A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security<br />of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall<br />not be infringed.</p></blockquote>
<p>I am no constitutional scholar, or even an attorney, but I did take American History in high school, and it seems to me that the reason so many people argue about the Second Amendment to the US Constitution is<br />because nobody, and I do mean nobody, quite likes what it means and how it was intended.</p>
<p>And let&#8217;s be blunt, we know precisely what the framers, the signers, and ratifiers of the Constitution thought this amendment meant.  See, two years after the Constitution took effect, there were rumblings in Western Pennsylvania, mostly about taxes on whiskey, security issues, and navigation along the Mississippi river.  Eventually it all came to a head in the so-called Whiskey Rebellion.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>President George Washington, with the support of the legislative and judicial branches of government, raised a militia to deal with the problem.  Before we get to what this militia looked like, bear in mind:  a sizable fraction of our legislators at the time had been involved in the drafting, signing, and/or ratification of the<br />Constitution.  A Justice of the Supreme Court, James Wilson, himself a signer of the Declaration of Independence and a member of the Committee of Detail which wrote the first draft of the Constitution,<br />signed off on the order raising the militia.   So rest assured, what came next is absolutely, precisely how the Framers of the Constitution collectively interpreted the Second Amendment that they had written.</p>
<p>To make a long story short, men from four states were conscripted into a militia (yes, there were volunteers, but not enough) and sent to put down the rebellion.  The next time anyone, on whatever side of the<br />debate, tells you they are firm supporters of the Second Amendment, ask them if they believe it was intended to allow the Federal government to round up citizens against their will, put them in uniforms, and make them march and fire upon other citizens in order to crush revolts and collect taxes.  If they do not, then politely remind them that is the Founding Fathers chose to interpret the Constitution they themselves hashed out, agreed upon, signed and ratified.  And then, for grins and giggles, ask them why they are so unpatriotic as<br />to insist on clinging to an un-American belief that the Founding  Fathers would certainly have deemed un-Constitutional</p>

<p>Some Thoughts on Statistical Analysis (A bit wonky)</p>
<p>Via <a href="http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2013/01/assorted-links-664.html">Tyler Cowen</a>, a pretty good post on <a href="http://seanjtaylor.com/post/39573264781/the-statistics-software-signal">statistical analysis</a>.  While I suggest reading the post, I&#8217;ve reproduced the first sentence of each point the author makes below (though have cut out the pieces in betweeen):<br />
<blockquote>1. When you don’t have to code your own estimators, you<br />probably won’t understand what you’re doing&#8230;<br />2. When it’s extremely low cost to perform inference, you are likely<br />to perform a lot of inferences&#8230;<br />3. When operating software doesn’t require a lot of training, users of<br />that software are likely to be poorly trained&#8230;<br />4. When you use proprietary software, you are sending the message that<br />you don’t care about whether people can replicate your analyses or<br />verify that the code was correct.</p></blockquote>
<p>I think for the most part, this is a brilliant post, and it is worth keeping the main points in mind as they are very, very good.  That said, I tend to disagree slightly with a few points.  One is the author&#8217;s love of R, stated repeatedly in the pieces of the post I didn&#8217;t quote.    I find R to be a pain in the #$$.  So does the author, but he feels that is a virtue as per item 2 above.  Frankly, the older I get, the more I use (wait for it!) Excel to do statistical analysis.  Excel doesn&#8217;t do much in the way of sophisticated work, and what it does is clunky.  I&#8217;m guessing it would violate the author&#8217;s point 4, being proprietary, but I&#8217;ve checked enough results on Excel<br />using matrix algebra that I&#8217;m satisfied its basic regression functionality works.  If you want to do anything more sophisticated than a plain old OLS regression, you need to code it yourself in VBA.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>But here&#8217;s what I love about using Excel&#8230;   Odds are, whatever data you&#8217;re using to do your analysis, you started off by sorting it in Excel in the first place. Its easy to sort and graph the data, and the eyeball and the nose are always the most important tools in statistics.  Another cool thing about Excel &#8211; it will spit out the<br />residuals.   And you can graph and organize those residuals twenty three ways from Sunday, which means you can build your own diagnostics appropriate for whatever task you&#8217;re doing.  Unless you absolutely positively have to run a system of equations fast, or you have a client who has glommed onto some absolutely useless statistical tool with a cool name (dig through an advanced econometrics book and you&#8217;ll spot &#8217;em aplenty) and you can&#8217;t shake them from their ignorance, there isn&#8217;t much point to using R or Stata or you name the program.  If your problem is not lack of time, but rather data sets that are too big for Excel to handle, find someone who is good in C++.</p>
<p>Another thing&#8230;  I suspect the author of that post and I have similar views on SAS. My own experience &#8211; I have seen or had associations with a number of organizations that consider themselves data savvy, and in<br />my opinion, from what I can tell,  if a company has X SAS licenses, it almost invariably means the organization has X junior analysts whose job it is to reach actionable conclusions using SAS who haven&#8217;t got<br />the vaguest clue how to interpret the results of the simplest statistical analysis.  This isn&#8217;t to say SAS is a bad tool, but merely that many organizations consider having a SAS license to be, in an of itself, a holy grail that allows them to dispense with any real expertise.</p>
<p>One final disagreement with the author &#8211; he seems to be falling into fallacy many economists do, which is assuming that what economists do is a science.  This to me indicates a failure to understand that a science is something scientists do, and what economists do is very different from what scientists do.   In biology, you won&#8217;t get very far if you try to peddle Lamarckian evolution, Lysenkoism or ID. Try being a proponent of the theory of phlogiston or the aether wind and see what that does for your career in physics.  But the equivalent<br />behavior in Economics won&#8217;t stop you, and may even prove beneficial to those wishing to get tenure at Harvard or Chicago, or be Dean of an Ivy League business school.  And then there are the think tanks&#8230;</p>

<p>Many types of tech &#8211; <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/12/paul-krugman-changes-his-mind-on.html" target="_blank">not just robots</a> &#8211; have been affecting and are going to affect the service sector.  When someone develops an inexpensive sign you can stick on top of television sets, racks of clothes, or appliances that will change itself whenever someone in the headquarters decides to change the price of the product, its going to eliminate entire departments of people (or move them to doing something else), plus reduce the workload at every retail store in the system.</p>
<p>(The normal cadence for us is to enter prices more than a week before they take effect.  We do have over-rides that allow the process to take place in 24 hours, but the amount of work needed to reduce errors<br />in that process is mind-boggling, not to mention wasteful given it results in hard printing of the wrong signs as well as the right signs.)</p>
<p>As of yet, I&#8217;m not sure automation reduced white collar work.  What it has done is created a race to efficiency.  Now companies scrape competitor data.  They analyze prices to try to determine which generate highest margins.  They analyze floor plans for the same purpose.  I cannot imagine that being done 10 years ago &#8211; both in my previous life as a consultant, and my current life working for a major retailer, we can barely get the data systems to provide the data for those types of analysis properly now.  Ten years ago it would have been impossible anywhere outside the military.  Ten years from now, data pulls that I need an analyst to spend a week and a half doing, and then another week and a half cleaning, will be spit out in minutes (I hope).  That analyst won&#8217;t be pulling data and organizing it &#8211; I&#8217;ll have her doing analysis instead.  Margins will be even tighter because all our competitors will be doing the same analysis, without which nobody survives.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Where the job losses will come from is not that my employer or its competitors will have fewer analysts, because, as I noted, more analysis will be needed just to stay competitive.  Instead, it will come from shuttering some of the companies in the field.  There will be fewer retailers &#8211; and they&#8217;ll all be bigger.</p>

<p> Posterity</p>
<p> I think you have to go back to Bob Dole in 1996 to find a Republican nominee for for President whose signature accomplishment wouldn&#8217;t be repudiated by most members of his own party in November 2012. The 2000 and 2004 nominee is best known for turning a surplus into a deficit (although most current Republicans approve of the way he did it, cutting tax rates, increasing military spending, and launching two wars) and was kept discretely away from the last Republican National Convention. The 2008 nominee is best known for the McCain-Feingold Act, and the 2012 nominee, of course, will forever be tied to Romneycare. As to Bob Dole in 1996, well, I couldn&#8217;t remember him having any signature issues so I googled him. Google took me <a href="http://www.ontheissues.org/Bob_Dole.htm">here</a> but I still didn&#8217;t find anything that really said &#8220;Bob Dole&#8221; to me.</p>
<p>Sure, he agreed or disagreed with all sorts of things, but he wasn&#8217;t the champion of any and there wasn&#8217;t anything he was really known for. The 1988 and 1992 nominee, George Herbert Walker Bush, these days is best remembered for ending the first war in Iraq without taking out Saddam Hussein or taking Baghdad and for &#8220;read my lips, no new taxes.&#8221; Breaking that promise got him excoriated by Republicans. Reagan seems to be the most recent Republican nominee for President of the US who has a signature issue that remains popular with Republicans today. </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>As the co-author of  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Presimetrics-Presidents-Measure-Issues-ebook/dp/B0041IXRWA/ref=tmm_kin_title_0?ie=UTF8&#038;m=AG56TWVU5XWC2&#038;qid=1337806400&#038;sr=1-1">Presimetrics</a>,  a book on Presidents, their policies, and the effect of those policies; I&#8217;ve talked to a lot of people of all stripes about Presidents, and Republicans today simply don&#8217;t seem to approve of most former Republican presidents, or at least their policies. Before Reagan was Ford, best remembered for pardoning Nixon and Whip Inflation Now. Nixon is best remembered for Watergate, going to China and meeting Mao, and price controls. Eisenhower for big government programs. Hoover, for being the hapless fellow who had recently become President when the Great Depression began.</p>
<p>At first I thought that says something about today&#8217;s Republican party. And perhaps it does. Perhaps it indicates the party&#8217;s values today are very different than they ever have been.</p>
<p>But it also may serve as a warning to Obama. I&#8217;ve pointed out before that except for one or two issues (Obamacare and Supreme Court justices he&#8217;s nominated), Obama&#8217;s first term has looked an awful lot like the third term of GW Bush would have looked. Tax rates remain low, the percentage of personal income going to taxes is down and the bail-out is basically an extension of Paulson&#8217;s bazooka. In four years, four long years, Obama hasn&#8217;t managed to figure out a single new approach to dealing with the economic mess that wasn&#8217;t pioneered by the guy who got us into the hole in the first place! The same is true of most other aspects of the Obama presidency. Policies on civil liberties are essentially the same as they were under GW. The &#8220;good war&#8221; in Afghanistan is still going on, and the war that was getting increasingly inconvenient (even the folks at the National Review had managed to figure out there was a problem by 2007 leading to the death of the &#8220;painted schoolhouse&#8221; anecdotes) was ended discretely, with everyone pretending that Iran wasn&#8217;t firmly in the driver&#8217;s seat. Foreigners, at least the non-Pakistani ones, seem to like Obama, but that&#8217;s more because there&#8217;s less bluster about &#8220;with us or against us&#8221; &#8211; actual policy remains very similar, complete with a down-to-the-bone inability to distinguish friend from foe.</p>
<p>Obama seems to have been re-elected not with enthusiasm among Democrats, but rather due to a sense that Romney was even worse. Part of that came from a feeling that Romney&#8217;s views on business weren&#8217;t really about business, they were just about profiting from loading companies up with debt, as if that approach to running the government hasn&#8217;t been championed by every President we&#8217;ve had since 1980 other than Bill Clinton. And truth to tell, a lot of the foreboding about Romney came not so much from Romney, who at some point stood for everything and anything, and thus stood for nothing at all, but rather from the particularly in-artful downticket comments (think Akin or Mourdock) on &#8220;legitimate rape&#8221; (???, !!!!!) and abortions. Most Democrats and many independents aren&#8217;t happy with Romneycare, er, Obamacare. They see it as a distant second or third best compared to the socialized medical systems of every industrialized country that produces better healthcare outcomes than we do, and at lower cost to boot. The one bit of actual enthusiasm for Obama might have come on the gay rights side, as a growing number of younger voters in much of the country don&#8217;t have the bias against openly gay people that remains strong among social conservatives, particularly the older generations. But even there, the camel&#8217;s nose entered the tent during the previous administration &#8211; most Republicans were smart enough not to piss off Dick Cheney by criticizing his daughter. </p>
<p>All of which is to say, Obama is potentially headed down the Republican presidency path in more ways than one. Despite his re-election, unless Democrats are infinitely more forgiving than Republicans, Obama might eventually become his party&#8217;s George Bush- the name nobody wants to mention, the face nobody wants to see at campaign stops, and the legacy nobody wants to remember. The longer he follows the same policies as his predecessor, the greater the likelihood he will be viewed the same way by his own party&#8217;s posterity. </p>
<p>A lot of Democrats seem to believe that now we&#8217;re going to see the &#8220;real Obama.&#8221; I hear Democrats say that Obama isn&#8217;t constrained by the need for re-election any more, and he has realized that rolling over and playing dead doesn&#8217;t make Republicans or Wall Street like him any better. Perhaps that&#8217;s true, perhaps the next four years will be different, but I wouldn&#8217;t bet on it. Its been my experience that in general, people don&#8217;t change that much. If he&#8217;s been behaving a certain way for four years, it is very likely we&#8217;ve seen the &#8220;real Obama.&#8221;</p>

<p>Obama, Romney &#038; Enthusiasm</p>
<p>We live in lesser times.  The election is coming up, and our choices for President are pretty dismal.  I mean really, Barack Obama or Mitt Romney?  This is what it comes down to?  And the third party candidates, when one scratches below the surface, are not any better. An honest person must admit ample reasons to oppose everyone on the ballot.</p>
<p>With that said, there is one phenomenon about this election I find very curious.  Until Barack Obama came around, the only Presidents since the end of WW2 to increase the national debt as a percentage of GDP have been Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan, and the two Bushes.  So why is it that so many people who oppose Obama, who look to Reagan as a shining light, are yelling about financial responsibility and deficits?  They weren&#8217;t supporting Democrats since 1976, that is for sure, and it wasn&#8217;t that long ago that Dick Cheney told us boldly that that deficits don&#8217;t matter.</p>
<p>I also don&#8217;t get the economic concerns that Republicans have about Obama.  With the exception of Obamacare, essentially the same thing as Romneycare and very much based on a Heritage Foundation plan, Obama&#8217;s economic plan has been to continue GW&#8217;s policies.  Tax rates have been kept constant, right where GW left them.  The bailout was kept the same.  What exactly did he change?</p>
<p>Which leads to the same question for Democrats too:  what exactly did Obama change?  From where I&#8217;m standing, on the economic front, all I can point to is that Obama has, if anything, done less to rein in financial abuses than his predecessor did.  </p>

<p>After the dot com implosion, there were prosecutions.  After the much bigger mess from<br />2007 to 2009, crickets.  Similarly, when the dot com implosions were played out, none of the perpetrators were given handouts.  After the 2007 meltdown, not only did Obama continue GW&#8217;s bailout giveaways, he expanded them and has encouraged the Fed to do the same.  If there&#8217;s one class of Americans who are doing particularly well, its the folks who were most complicit in creating the mess the rest of the country is in.</p>
<p>I can say about the same thing with respect to social policies, foreign affairs, etc.  All of which is to say, there are a lot of people out demonizing one of the candidates, a candidate who is following their party&#8217;s prescription as well as any of their own party&#8217;s standard bearers, simply because he belongs to the other party.  And there are a lot of people supporting that candidate, that candidate who in deeds stands against what they stand for, simply because he is, nominally a member of their party.  The reason we live in lesser times is because, collectively, we are lesser people.</p>
<p>The other day I held my nose, scratched off a mark next to the name of the marginally lesser of the two evils (I originally planned to have a blank vote for President, but the other evil worries me more than I expected), and mailed in my absentee ballot.  I won&#8217;t advise you on whom to vote, but I would, strongly suggest that you not kid yourself.  If, like me, you are holding your nose, don&#8217;t pretend you are doing it with a lot of enthusiasm.  The stakes surrounding this election are far smaller than the stakes surrounding how we, the people, behave when it comes to politics.</p>

<p>The Economic System of the Apostles</p>
<p>I am not a Christian, but if I was, I suspect the following verses from the Acts of the Apostles would have an impact on my life.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.blueletterbible.org/Bible.cfm?b=Act&#038;c=2&#038;v=1&#038;t=KJV">Acts of the Apostles, 2: 44-47</a><br />
<blockquote>And all that believed were together, and had all things<br />common; And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all<br />[men], as every man had need.  And they, continuing daily with one<br />accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat<br />their meat with gladness and singleness of heart, Praising God, and<br />having favour with all the people. And the Lord added to the church<br />daily such as should be saved.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.blueletterbible.org/Bible.cfm?b=Act&#038;c=4&#038;v=1&#038;t=KJV">Acts of the Apostles, 4: 32-35</a></p>
<blockquote><p>And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart<br />and of one soul: neither said any [of them] that ought of the things<br />which he possessed was his own; but they had all things common. And<br />with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the<br />Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them all. Neither was there any<br />among them that lacked: for as many as were possessors of lands or<br />houses sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold,<br />And laid [them] down at the apostles&#8217; feet: and distribution was made<br />unto every man according as he had need.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.blueletterbible.org/Bible.cfm?b=Act&#038;c=5">Acts of the Apostles, 5: 1-11</a></p>
<blockquote><p>But a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife,<br />sold a possession, And kept back [part] of the price, his wife also<br />being privy [to it], and brought a certain part, and laid [it] at the<br />apostles&#8217; feet. But Peter said, Ananias, why hath Satan filled thine<br />heart to lie to the Holy Ghost, and to keep back [part] of the price<br />of the land?  Whiles it remained, was it not thine own? and after it<br />was sold, was it not in thine own power? why hast thou conceived this<br />thing in thine heart? thou hast not lied unto men, but unto God.  And<br />Ananias hearing these words fell down, and gave up the ghost: and<br />great fear came on all them that heard these things.  And the young<br />men arose, wound him up, and carried [him] out, and buried [him].  And<br />it was about the space of three hours after, when his wife, not<br />knowing what was done, came in.  And Peter answered unto her, Tell me<br />whether ye sold the land for so much? And she said, Yea, for so much.<br />Then Peter said unto her, How is it that ye have agreed together to<br />tempt the Spirit of the Lord? behold, the feet of them which have<br />buried thy husband [are] at the door, and shall carry thee out.   Then<br />fell she down straightway at his feet, and yielded up the ghost: and<br />the young men came in, and found her dead, and, carrying [her] forth,<br />buried [her] by her husband.   And great fear came upon all the<br />church, and upon as many as heard these things.</p></blockquote>

<p>Mainstream and Semi-Mainstream Allegations Against Sitting Presidents</p>
<p>I think back to each of the Presidents who was in office since Reagan,<br />under whom I was old enough to start paying attention.  And I was<br />thinking of the allegations that were made against each by their<br />political enemies.  I&#8217;m going to ignore the real fringe stuff, stuff<br />you might hear only from, say, the Neo-Nazis on one side or those who<br />call themselves communists on the other.  Call this a list of things<br />regularly believed by tens of millions of people, regularly stated by<br />individuals commanding an audience of tens of millions of people, or<br />regularly stated by political press that commands respect by members<br />of one of the two political parties.</p>
<p>Its four AM and I am working from memory, so maybe I&#8217;m missing<br />something but here&#8217;s the basic worst allegations list:</p>
<blockquote><p>Allegations against Reagan:  October surprise, senile,<br />prone to making up stories, appointed corrupt officials, support for<br />dictators in Latin America, illegal wars in Central America, selling<br />arms to Iran</p></blockquote>
<p>

<p>We&#8217;re in the middle of a contentious election, and too close to things<br />right now for me to list allegations against Obama, so I&#8217;ll end my<br />short list right there.  Feel free to expand it in comments, but<br />please avoid fringe allegations.  And one more thing &#8211; I think its<br />worth asking:  what do you notice about this list?</p>

                                <p>by <strong>Kenneth Thomas</strong><br /><strong></strong>(reposted from Middle Class Economist)<br />     <br />Mike Kimel at <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/04/aei-economists-and-ugly-memory-hole.html">Angry Bear</a> has several nice posts on the &#8220;Laffer Curve&#8221; that underlies much of conservative economic orthodoxy in this country. As you may know, Art Laffer famously claimed that at tax rates of 0 and 100%, you would get zero tax revenue, and that in between, there is an inverted U shaped curve, where taxes collected first increase as the tax rate goes up, then decrease as tax rates go higher still, back down to zero tax collected when the tax rate is 100%.<br />     <br />The Kimel post linked above was prompted by an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, Alan Viard, telling the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/08/magazine/whats-the-easiest-way-to-cheat-on-your-taxes.html?_r=2&#038;ref=todayspaper&#038;pagewanted=all"><i>New York Times</i></a> that all economists know that when the top tax rate is 35%, cutting rates further will reduce tax revenue.<br />
<blockquote>“The Reagan tax cuts, on the whole, reduced revenue,” he explains. “The Bush tax cuts clearly reduced revenue. There is no dispute among economists about that.” </p></blockquote>
<p>Except, as Kimel points out, lots of conservative economists dispute this, including one who co-authored a paper with Viard! For his trouble, Kimel became the subject of a post at the <a href="http://blog.american.com/2012/04/angry-bear-bloggers-and-the-ugly-memory-hole/">AEI blog</a> by James Pethokoukis, which started by completely misidentifying him and going downhill from there. For Kimel&#8217;s enjoyable takedown of this post, see <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/04/american-enterprise-institute.html">here</a>.    <br />All this led me back to an earlier post of Kimel&#8217;s, where he makes <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/10/laffer-curve-and-kimel-curve.html">an empirical estimate of the Laffer Curve</a>, using U.S. data all the way back to 1929, the first year for which official U.S. data exists. I&#8217;ll spare you the technical details (see <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/10/laffer-curve-and-kimel-curve.html">Kimel&#8217;s post</a>), but here&#8217;s the bottom line: Laffer got it exactly backward, with tax revenue initially falling as tax rates increase, then rising after a further increase in rates. Here is Kimel&#8217;s estimate of the &#8220;true&#8221; Laffer curve:<br />    <br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KGAGYeBkCe8/TqDnjFOCbbI/AAAAAAAAAn0/fgeWBTmmXBg/s1600/Figure%2B2.jpg"><img alt="" border="0" height="404" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KGAGYeBkCe8/TqDnjFOCbbI/AAAAAAAAAn0/fgeWBTmmXBg/s640/Figure%2B2.jpg" width="640"></a>    </p>
<p>Not only that, as one of Kimel&#8217;s commenters, Robert Waldmann points out, we actually have experience with a country having a top marginal rate over 100%, Sweden in the 1970s. Contrary to Laffer, not only was tax revenue not equal to zero, in 1975, Sweden&#8217;s tax revenue was 41.3% of gross domestic product! (<a href="http://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx">OECD statistics</a>, click on &#8220;data by theme,&#8221; then &#8220;public sector, taxation, and market regulation,&#8221; then &#8220;taxation,&#8221; then &#8220;revenue statistics &#8211; OECD member countries,&#8221; then &#8220;comparative tables&#8221;) 21.2% was central government revenue, i.e. excluding subnational government and social security. Either way, a long way from zero.<br />    <br />Not to belabor the point, but Viard was right about tax revenue after President Bush&#8217;s tax cuts. Here is the OECD data for the federal government, excluding Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. First we see the effects of President Clinton&#8217;s tax increase, then President Bush&#8217;s tax cuts.<br />    <br />Year Tax/GDP    <br />1992 10.7%    <br />1993 11.0%    <br />1994 11.3%    <br />1995 11.7%    <br />1996 12.2%    <br />1997 12.7%    <br />1998 13.1%    <br />1999 13.2%    <br />2000 13.5%    <br />2001 12.5%    <br />2002 10.4%    <br />2003 9.8%    <br />2004 10.0%    <br />2005 11.2%    <br />2006 11.9%    <br />2007 11.9%    <br />2008 10.4%    <br />2009 8.4%    <br />2010 9.1%    <br />Source: OECD, directions as above for Sweden<br />   <br />Before you supply-siders get too excited about the increase in 2006 and 2007 to 11.9%, remember that the higher Clinton tax rates brought in more revenue for five straight years, 1996-2000.    <br />Though many journalists get it wrong, chessplayers like myself know that &#8220;refute&#8221; means to conclusively disprove. And the Laffer Curve stands refuted. </p>
