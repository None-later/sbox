                                <p>by <strong><a href="http://presimetrics.com/">Mike Kimel</a></strong></p>
<p>I was searching for some information and I stumbled on a post Scott Sumner wrote last year about <a href="http://www.themoneyillusion.com/?p=7914">Robert Skidelsky&#8217;s biography of John Maynard Keynes</a>. I haven&#8217;t read Skidelsky&#8217;s book, nor do I know Skidelsky, and its been awful long time since I read Keynes, but this seems an odd complaint:</p>
<blockquote><p>I’m afraid that his analysis is both misleading and inaccurate. The US gradually depreciated the dollar between April 1933 and February 1934. During that period unemployment was nearly 25% and T-bill yields were close to zero. Keynes argued that monetary stimulus would not be effective under those circumstances, and Skidelsky seems to accept his interpretation (which was published in the NYT during December 1933.)</p>
<p>[Note that Keynes certainly did believe in the &#8220;pushing on a string&#8221; theory&#8211;I frequently get commenters insisting that Keynes didn&#8217;t believe in liquidity traps.]</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Keynes and Skidelsky are wrong. <a name="more"></a> The US Wholesale Price Index rose by more than 20% between March 1933 and March 1934. In the Keynesian model that’s not supposed to happen. The broader “Cost of Living” rose about 10%. Industrial production rose more than 45%.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sumner goes on to impugn Skidelsky:</p>
<blockquote><p>The &#8220;disappointing&#8221; results that Skidelsky mentions come from cherry-picking a few misleading data points.</p></blockquote>
<p>All that seems very odd to me. If I were making an argument that conventional monetary policy doesn&#8217;t work in a liquidity trap, but that the traditional Keynesian prescription does, I&#8217;d start that argument with something very much like the sentences Sumner wrote right after stating &#8220;Unfortunately, Keynes and Skidelsky are wrong.&#8221;*</p>
<p>Using the graphing tool from <a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?id=CPIAUCNS#">FRED</a>, the Federal Reserve Economic Database maintained by the St. Louis Fed, we can show the one year percentage change in both PPI (producer price index) and CPI (consumer price index) from January 1932 to December 1935. 
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-kjiWj7_BMfg/TrgTPwr6pSI/AAAAAAAAApQ/YWfDI-_ssJc/s1600/Figure%2B1.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-kjiWj7_BMfg/TrgTPwr6pSI/AAAAAAAAApQ/YWfDI-_ssJc/s320/Figure%2B1.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what we see: after some massive deflation during the Great Depression, prices start to rise more or less when FDR took office. The annual percentage change in PPI peaked around 23% and change in February 1934, and the CPI peaked a few months later at about 5.6%. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.themoneyillusion.com/?p=308">Elsewhere</a>, Sumner attributes that to:</p>
<blockquote><p>We all know what happened next (well not exactly, but I’ll explain that in another post), so let’s jump ahead to 1933. FDR takes office in March, promising to boost wholesale prices back up to pre-Depression levels. He uses several tools, but the most effective was loosely based on Irving Fisher’s “compensated dollar plan.” Fisher’s plan was to raise the price of gold one percent each time the price level fell one percent. An obscure agricultural economist named George Warren was a big fan of Fisher’s idea, and sold it to FDR with all sorts of fancy charts.</p>
<p>And it worked.</p>
<p>Initially it worked better than any other macroeconomic policy in American history. But at first the policy’s success was mostly accidental, just a matter of talking the dollar down, not enacting Fisher’s specific plan. Nevertheless, prices immediately began rising sharply. Industrial production rose 57% between March and July, regaining over half the ground lost in the previous 3 1/2 years. Then in late July FDR decided to cartelize the economy and sharply raised wages (the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Industrial_Recovery_Act">NIRA</a>) and industrial output immediately began falling. By late October FDR was desperate for another dose of inflation, and asked Warren to come up with a plan. They decided to have the US government buy gold at a price that would be continually increased in order to reflate the price level.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sumner even helpfully tells us:</p>
<blockquote><p>It was a very confusing plan, as they never bought enough gold to equate the government buying price with the free market price in London. </p></blockquote>
<p>I agree that what Sumner describes is confusing. And yes, the times were desperate, and FDR was flailing around throwing all sorts of things against a wall to see what would work, but when I look at the graph above, and take into account the extremely rapid economic growth that took place during the New Deal era, I see a much simpler story.</p>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Aggregate demand was very slack when FDR took office.</p>
</li>
<li>FDR showed up in Washington with a plan to start spending a lot of money and thus boost aggregate demand.
</li>
<li>The immediate effect was to convince factories they&#8217;d be running down their inventories. That boosted producer prices. It had a much smaller effect on consumer prices because everyone knew the gubmint was going to buy a heck of a lot more producer goods than consumer goods. (The government did buy some consumer goods for the various programs, plus there was a spillover effect, but as the graph clearly shows, the action was on the producer side.)
</li>
<li>After a bit of time, the public realized FDR wasn&#8217;t planning just a one-off, but rather a sustained program of purchases of industrial items. That led them to start using some of their idle capacity, which meant not just selling the fixed amount that was in inventory. The rate of price increases thus dropped.
</li>
<li>GDP increased at the fastest rate in the United States peacetime history since data has been kept. There was a big hiccup, of course, in 1937 when the government cut back on spending for a while.</li>
</ol>
<p>By contrast, here&#8217;s Sumner explaining his theory:</p>
<blockquote><p>There is a great deal of evidence that I won&#8217;t get into here that suggests the suspension of the gold standard in March 1933, and gradual devaluation between April and February 1934, almost certainly explain most of the increase in goods prices, stock prices, and industrial production during that period. But why? Not because it boosted our trade balance, which actually worsened as the rapid recovery pulled in imports.</p>
<p>Both Gauti and I believe that only the rational expectations hypothesis can explain these events. He focuses on how the regime change led to higher inflation expectations, and thus reduced real interest rates. I prefer to think in terms of specific policy signals sent as rising gold prices changed the future expected gold price, and hence the future expected money supply. I don&#8217;t see any non-Ratex explanation that can account for the extraordinary rise in prices and output during March-July 1933. Nominal interest rates didn&#8217;t change much, and open market purchases in 1932 (under the constraint of the gold standard) had accomplished little or nothing.</p></blockquote>
<p>So&#8230;. his story requires the devaluation of the currency to worsen the trade balance, and rational expectations to cause a one time explosion in industrial prices and a rather smaller recovery in consumer prices. Rational expectations, however, that came an abrupt halt, at roughly the same amount of time one would predict companies might decide that demand will be sustained enough to start producing more rather than just selling off inventory sitting in warehouses. And his story doesn&#8217;t explain why growth was so much faster during the New Deal era than any other period of peacetime since the US began keeping data, nor why there was the big hiccup in 1937. </p>
<p>Sumner is essentially trying to tell a story about an unusual set of events, but his story seems to assume that most extraordinary events of the era (and what sets that era apart) kind of just happened to occur for no particular reason so he misses the big picture and ends up focusing on details. With all due respect to Sumner, I prefer to think the US economy is not Forrest Gump.</p>
<p>*I can imagine a &#8220;monetary&#8221; prescription that I think would help tremendously in a liquidity trap, but it doesn&#8217;t look at all like what was done in the 1930s, or what was done since 2007, or from what I can tell, what Sumner suggests. That can be a post for another time.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been writing about the relationship between tax rates and growth since I started blogging in 2006. A lot of those posts have focused on the quadratic relationship between tax rates and growth. That is, it turns out that if you take US data going back to when the BEA started keeping track, 1929, you can easily build a model of the following form:</p>
<p>% change in real GDP from t to t+1 = a + b*Top Marginal Tax Rate at time t<br />+ c* Top Marginal Tax Rate squared at time t </p>
<p>I have modestly referred to that as the Kimel curve. Now, it turns out that for most variations on that theme I&#8217;ve come up with, b is positive, c is negative, and both are significant at the 5% or 10% level. That allows you to find a top marginal tax rate that maximizes growth&#8230; which turns out to be somewhere between 60% and 70% depending on how the model is specified.</p>
<p>In this post I want to address a few criticisms by running two additional regressions with more or less the form. Parts of this may get a bit wonky but I&#8217;m going to keep it so that even if you&#8217;ve never done any statistical analysis, hopefully you&#8217;ll be able to follow the outcomes.</p>
<p>In the first regression, I&#8217;m going to account for a few additional facts:<br />1. By going with every single observation the BEA produces, I&#8217;ve been accused of &#8220;cherry picking.&#8221; So I&#8217;m going to throw in a dummy variable for Hoover. <br />2. I&#8217;ve been told the only reason growth was so quick during the New Deal was that there was a bounceback effect from the Great Depression&#8230; so I&#8217;m throwing in a dummy variable for FDR&#8217;s peacetime years (i.e., 33-41).<br />3. I&#8217;ve been told WW2 biases the results&#8230;. so there&#8217;s a third dummy for 1942-1944, the fast growing years in WW2. <br />4. I&#8217;ve also included two demographic variables: the percentage of Americans 35 to 44 and the percentage of Americans 45 &#8211; 54. The latter group tends to be the highest income group these days, but in an earlier era more focused on manual labor, those 35 to 44 might have been higher paid. <br />5. For grins, I threw in a dummy variable which is equal to 1 if the President is a Republican and 0 otherwise. </p>
<p>So&#8230; here&#8217;s what it looks like:
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-rOgMAImqGFw/Tqh1Mcp8S3I/AAAAAAAAAoU/xtQwc6aeAw8/s1600/figure%2B1%2B-%2Bkitchen%2Bsink.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-rOgMAImqGFw/Tqh1Mcp8S3I/AAAAAAAAAoU/xtQwc6aeAw8/s320/figure%2B1%2B-%2Bkitchen%2Bsink.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>So what does it all mean? Well, this set of variables explains about 43% of the observed variation in growth rates over the period for which we have data (see the adjusted R2). There&#8217;s obviously room to improve the model, variables I&#8217;m not accounting for, etc.</p>
<p>The percentage of Americans 35 to 44 has a positive coefficient and is almost significant at 10%. We&#8217;re almost at the point where we&#8217;d be comfortable saying as that percentage increases, growth increases. The percentage of Americans 45 &#8211; 54 has a negative coefficient, but isn&#8217;t close to being significant. </p>
<p>Not surprisingly, the Hoover dummy is associated with economic shrinkage, FDR&#8217;s peacetime period is associated with positive growth, and 1942 &#8211; 1944 is associated with even faster economic growth.</p>
<p>The Republican dummy is not significant &#8211; any difference in the growth rate observed between the two parties can be explained by other factors. Which other factors?</p>
<p>Well, the top marginal tax rate and the top marginal tax rate squared are both significant &#8211; the former is positive and the latter is negative, which means they trace out the desired upside-down-U shape. </p>
<p>Oh&#8230; and the top of the curve happens when tax rates are at 64%. That is, the fastest growth rates seem to occur when the top marginal tax rate is around 64%. Now, I&#8217;ve had post after post on this topic, and the top of the curve always seems to occur in more or less in the same place. It isn&#8217;t a coincidence folks. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ll post results of the second regression in my next post in the series. That regression will focus on the period since Reagan took office and thus will only include data from 1981 to the present. What does it say? Well, a hint: if you don&#8217;t like the results shown in this post, you won&#8217;t be happy about that one either. But remember, I&#8217;m just the messenger. The data is what the data is, and if it isn&#8217;t showing what you think it should, its up to you figure out what&#8217;s wrong with the analysis or with the data, to pontificate wisely and inaccurately, to ignore the evidence, or to change your mind. </p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>If anyone has a line on a good inequality series with annual data that goes back to 1929, please let me know. I&#8217;d like to drop it into the model. I&#8217;d also love a good proxy for regulation. Don&#8217;t be afraid to offer other suggestions for data to drop into the mix are welcome too. I&#8217;m like a DJ, I take requests, but it helps if you can point to whatever data you want me to use. </p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>As always, if you want my spreadsheets drop me a line at &#8220;mike&#8221; period &#8220;kimel&#8221; (note &#8211; one m only in my last name!!!!) at gmail.com.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>Thanks to Bill McBride for pointing toward the demographic data and m. jed for suggesting its use.</p>

<p><strong>Is Economics a Science &#8211; Three Comments</strong></p>
<p>In the last few days I came across three very different posts, each of which covers (to some extent) the question of whether economics is a science.  In order of how focused on the posts are on that particular question&#8230;.</p>
<p>Barry Ritholtz is on fire with this post on <a href="http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/2011/03/alan-greenspan-clueless-dolt/">Alan Greenspan</a>.</p>
<p>Mike the Mad Biologist on <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/mikethemadbiologist/2011/03/when_economists_misunderstand.php">when economists misunderstand biology</a>.  (My answer to whether economics is a science appears in comments to Mike&#8217;s post.)  </p>
<p>Brad DeLong provides an <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2011/03/is-economics-a-discipline.html">insider&#8217;s view of the problem</a>.</p>
<p>Update:  Discussion hits a chord with bloggers and readers.  Here are other links to the discussion.</p>

<p><strong>Japan:  The Post-WW2 Rise, the 1980s Peak, and the Decline &#8211; A Simple Theory</strong><br />Cross-posted at the <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=393&#038;preview=true">Presimetrics blog</a>.</p>
<p>A lot has been written about the disaster in Japan. I don&#8217;t have much I can add to that, except that like everyone else (or at least everyone civilized), I am so very sorry that it happened.  (What is with the folks talking about Pearl Harbor?  Seriously.  What is that about?)</p>
<p>Still, in reading about the tragedy, I had a thought about Japanese economic history and I&#8217;d like to expand on it in this post.  But I&#8217;d like to lead off by pointing out I am not an expert on Japan.  That means y&#8217;all can feel free to correct me where I&#8217;m wrong, but it also means I started off by going to <a href="http://countrystudies.us/">this website</a>, which has some cool country studies.  The website:</p>
<blockquote><p>contains the on-line versions of books previously published in hard copy by the Federal Research Division of the Library of Congress as part of the Country Studies/Area Handbook Series sponsored by the U.S. Department of the Army between 1986 and 1998. Each study offers a comprehensive description and analysis of the country or region&#8217;s historical setting, geography, society, economy, political system, and foreign policy.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let me start by quoting liberally from <a href="http://countrystudies.us/japan/123.htm">Japan country study</a>m specifically the section on bureaucrats.  <br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<blockquote><p>Although the United States occupation dismantled both the military and zaibatsu establishments, it did little, outside of abolishing the prewar Home Ministry, to challenge the power of the bureaucracy. There was considerable continuity&#8211;in institutions, operating style, and personnel&#8211; between the civil service before and after the occupation, partly because MacArthur&#8217;s staff ruled indirectly and depended largely on the cooperation of civil servants. A process of mutual co-optation occurred. </p></blockquote>
<p>Next quote:</p>
<blockquote><p>In trying to discover &#8220;who&#8217;s in charge here,&#8221; many analysts have pointed to the elite bureaucracy as the people who really govern Japan, although they composed only a tiny fraction of the country&#8217;s more than 1 million national government employees. Several hundred of the elite are employed at each national ministry or agency. Although entry into the elite through open examinations does not require a college degree, the majority of its members are alumni of Japan&#8217;s most prestigious universities. The University of Tokyo Law Faculty is the single most important source of elite bureaucrats. After graduation from college and, increasingly, some graduate-level study, applicants take a series of extremely difficult higher civil service examinations: in 1988, for example, 28,833 took the tests, but only 1,814, or 6.3 percent, were successful. Of those who were successful, only 721 were actually hired. Like the scholar-officials of imperial China, successful candidates were hardy survivors of a grueling education and testing process that necessarily began in early childhood and demanded total concentration. The typical young bureaucrat, who is in most cases male, is an intelligent, hardworking, and dedicated individual. Some bureaucrats lack imagination and, perhaps, compassion for people whose way of life is different from their own.</p>
<p>The public&#8217;s attitude toward the elite is ambivalent. The elite enjoy tremendous social prestige, but members are also resented. They live in a realm that is at least partly public yet far removed from the lives of ordinary people. Compared with politicians, they are generally viewed as honest. Involvement of top officials in scandals such as the Recruit affair, however, had, to some extent, tarnished their image.</p>
<p>Japan&#8217;s elite bureaucrats are insulated from direct political pressure because there are very few political appointments in the civil service. Cabinet ministers are usually career politicians, but they are moved in and out of their posts quite frequently (with an average tenure of under a year), and usually have little opportunity to develop a power base within a ministry or force their civil service subordinates to adopt reforms. Below the cabinet minister is the administrative vice minister. Administrative vice ministers and their subordinates are career civil servants whose appointments are determined in accordance with an internally established principle of seniority.</p>
<p>In a 1975 article, political scientist Chalmers Johnson quotes a retired vice minister of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) who said that the Diet was merely &#8220;an extension of the bureaucracy.&#8221; The official claimed that &#8220;the bureaucracy drafts all the laws&#8230;. All the legislature does is to use its powers of investigation, which for about half the year keeps most of the senior officials cooped up in the Diet.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>And now the change&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Administrative reform policies in the 1980s imposed ceilings on civil service staff and spending that probably contributed to a deterioration of morale and working conditions.</p>
<p>Still another factor limiting bureaucratic power was the emergence of an affluent society. In the early postwar period, the scarcity of capital made it possible for the Ministry of Finance and MITI to exert considerable influence over the economy through control of the banking system. To a decreasing extent, this scarcity remained until the 1980s because most major companies had high debt-equity ratios and depended on the banks for infusions of capital. Their huge profits and increasing reliance on securities markets in the late 1980s, however, meant that the Ministry of Finance had less influence. The wealth, technical sophistication, and new confidence of the companies also made it difficult for MITI to exercise administrative guidance. The ministry could not restrain aggressive and often politically controversial purchases by Japanese corporate investors in the United States, such as Mitsubishi Estate&#8217;s October 1989 purchase of Rockefeller Center in New York City, which, along with the Sony Corporation&#8217;s acquisition of Columbia Pictures several weeks earlier, heated up trade friction between the two countries.</p>
<p>The whole issue of trade friction and foreign pressure tended to politicize the bureaucracy and promote unprecedented divisiveness in the late 1980s and early 1990s. During the Structural Impediments Initiative talks held by Japan and the United States in early 1990, basic changes in Japan&#8217;s economy were discussed: reforms of the distribution and pricing systems, improvement of the infrastructure, and elimination of official procedures that limited foreign participation in the economy. Although foreign pressure of this sort is resented by many Japanese as an intrusion on national sovereignty, it also provides an opportunity for certain ministries to make gains at the expense of others. There is hardly a bureaucratic jurisdiction in the economic sphere that is not in some sense affected.</p>
<p>Repeatedly, internationally minded political and bureaucratic elites found their market-opening reforms, designed to placate United States demands, sabotaged by other interests, especially agriculture. Such reactions intensified United States pressure, which in turn created a sense of crisis and a siege mentality within Japan. The &#8220;internationalization&#8221; of Japan&#8217;s society in other ways also divided the bureaucratic elite. MITI, the Ministry of Labor, and the Ministry of Justice had divergent views on how to respond to the influx of unskilled, usually South Asian and Southeast Asian, laborers into the labor-starved Japanese economy. </p></blockquote>
<p>Now a bit from <a href="http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft7t1nb5d6;brand=ucpress">Japan&#8217;s Administrative Elite</a> by B C Koh(see pages 259, 260):</p>
<blockquote><p>A decline in elitism can be seen in a number of trends: (1) a strong showing of universities other than Todai and Kyodai in the higher civil-service examination, (2) a notable increase in the proportion of private-university graduates who enter the higher civil service, and (3) advancement of &#8220;noncareer&#8221; bureaucrats to elite administrative positions.</p>
<p>Although Todai and Kyodai have consistently maintained their positions as the first- and second-largest sources, respectively, of successful candidates in the higher civil-service examination throughout the postwar period, their combined share of the total has frequently fallen short of 50 percent. In the eighteen-year period from 1970 to 1987, for example, the two top universities&#8217; share fell below the 50-percent mark eleven times (see table 9 in chapter 4). This means that the majority of successful candidates in the higher civil-service examination came from other institutions of higher learning in those years. In the 1980s, private universities surpassed the 10-percent mark for the first time, reaching 12.6 percent by 1986 and 13 percent in 1987. In the ten-year period from 1976 to 1985 the number of private-university graduates who passed the higher civil-service examination increased 3.5 times.[6]</p>
<p>If we examine the situation at the hiring stage, we find the same trend: a steady increase in the proportion of private-university graduates. Since 1980, private-university graduates who passed the higher civil-service examination had a greater probability of being hired than graduates of national universities. In 1983 and 1984, six in ten of the former, as compared with four in ten of the latter, were hired. In the ten-year period from 1976 to 1985, the number of private-university graduates who entered the higher civil service quadrupled.[7]</p>
<p>A slight decline in the elitist character of Japan&#8217;s higher civil service is suggested by a steady increase in the number of &#8220;noncareer&#8221; civil servants who advance to elite administrative positions. As we saw in chapter 4 (table 8), graduates of the intermediate civil-service examination began to appear in grade-1 positions (assistant bureau chief, division chief, and senior-level section chief) in increasing numbers since 1974; in 1981, a graduate of the lower examination attained grade 1 for the first time, and a small but growing number of others followed in his footsteps in subsequent years. By 1986, the National Personnel Authority disclosed that two in ten civil servants at the rank of section chief or its equivalent and above in the national government had not gone beyond junior colleges, implying that they were &#8220;noncareer&#8221; bureaucrats.</p></blockquote>
<p>So&#8230;  a decade before the end of Japan&#8217;s economic miracle, the fabled bureaucracy that drove Japan Inc. started to erode &#8211; more of its members started coming from lower quality, private universities, it stopped being held in as high esteem by the public, it lost its ability to impose its will on the economy, and to boot (or perhaps I should say on a related note), it started to adopt new policies and philosophies being pushed by the Reagan administration.  How long do you think it takes for something like that to have a long-term, possibly irreversible effect on an economy that used to be the envy of the world?</p>
<p>As an aside&#8230; ever notice how countries that adopt policies favored by right wing or libertarian think-tanks tend to have a few very successful years (with much crowing by those think tanks) followed by disaster?  Be it Japan, Argentina, Russia, much of Eastern Europe, Ireland, Iceland, etc., it does seem that there&#8217;s a pattern.  Heck, that pattern even <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=374">applies to the US</a>. I think even some of the promoters of those policies are starting to see that pattern.  Its to the point where a lot of folks in those circles are trying to convince the public that Singapore, a country where the government&#8217;s role in the economy is larger and more intrusive than in most other countries, is an example of a libertarian paradise.</p>
