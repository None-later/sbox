<blockquote><p>In a new lawsuit against the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), big energy extractors are pushing for carte blanche in their interactions with foreign governments, making it harder to track whether their deals are padding the coffers of dictators, warlords, or crony capitalists. The <a href="http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=United_States_Chamber_of_Commerce">United States Chamber of Commerce</a>, <a href="http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=American_Petroleum_Institute">American Petroleum Institute</a>, the <a href="http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Independent_Petroleum_Association_of_America">Independent Petroleum Association of America</a>, and the National Foreign Trade Council <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/10/sec-lawsuit-idUSL1E8LAM2L20121010">filed</a> a lawsuit on October 10, 2012 against <a href="http://www.sec.gov/news/press/2012/2012-164.htm">a new SEC rule,</a> which requires U.S. oil, mining and gas companies to formally disclose payments made to foreign governments as part of their annual SEC reporting. </p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.chamberlitigation.com/api-and-chamber-commerce-et-al-v-us-securities-and-exchange-commission">Chamber of Commerce</a>  <i>National Chamber Litigation Center</i> quote says:</p>
<blockquote><p>On October 10, 2012, the Chamber and its association partners filed a <u><a href="http://www.chamberlitigation.com/sites/default/files/cases/files/2012/Complaint%20--%20API%20and%20Chamber%20of%20Commerce,%20et%20al.%20v.%20SEC%20(D.C.%20District%20Court).PDF">complaint with the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia</a></u> and a <u><a href="http://www.chamberlitigation.com/sites/default/files/cases/files/2012/Petition%20for%20Review%20--%20API%20and%20Chamber%20of%20Commerce,%20et%20al.%20v.%20SEC%20(D.C.%20Circuit).pdf">petition for review with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit</a></u>, charging that the rule violates the First Amendment, the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), and the Exchange Act of 1934. The lawsuits allege that the SEC failed to conduct an adequate cost-benefit analysis as required by law, that the SEC grossly misinterpreted its statutory mandate to make a “compilation” of information available to the public, and that the regulation is incompatible with the First Amendment.</p></blockquote>
