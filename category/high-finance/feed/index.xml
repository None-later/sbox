				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-08-25/most-junior-bankers-feel-disappointment-with-pay-aspire-to-buyout-jobs.html">Let the Waves of Pity Begin</a>:<br />
<br />
<blockquote>More than 80 percent said they don’t believe that their compensation is mainly predicated on performance. Instead, [Capstone managing partner Rik] Kopelan said, young investment bankers worry that it’s &#8220;based on the profitability of the firm, based on how powerful the group heads were, based on capricious things.&#8221; [emphases mine]</p></blockquote>
<p>Gosh, really?  That would <em>never</em> happen in the real world.</p>
<p>So why are they so saddened?<br />
<br />
<blockquote>One investment banker who participated in the survey described a breach of the &#8220;tacit understanding&#8221; that he or she would be well compensated.</p></blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t know about anyone else, but if you try to use the phrase &#8220;tacit understanding&#8221; to get something valuable from an Investment Banking client, you will quickly find that you no longer have a client.</p>
<p>But the pain&#8230;<br />
<br />
<blockquote>Considering “the sacrifice I make in my personal life (100-hour work weeks, canceled vacations, etc.), this business has to be more rewarding,” the person said, according to Capstone.</p></blockquote>
<p>You hear a lot about people working 100-hour weeks. Some of it is true. The part that is left out is that those weeks are also filled with a company car home (and often to), meals provided on the expense account, and a guaranteed base salary with a bonus that (for those 100-hour a week jobs) generally runs north of 100% of salary. And that&#8217;s ignoring signing bonuses.<br />
<br /><a name="more"></a><br />
<br />Note, by the way, that having a guaranteed salary does <em>not</em> make you an entrepreneur.  Or a farmer. Or a store owner.  Or a restauranteur of any type, from Tom&#8217;s Diner to The Quilted Giraffe. All of whom are also likely to be working 14+ x 7 without pulling <a href="http://www.mergersandinquisitions.com/investment-banking-salaries-mcdonalds/">what some glibly compare to McDonald&#8217;s wages</a>.</p>
<p>What it does do is gives you an opportunity to move up in an organization, to develop your career, to peak out at compensation of, say, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_A._Schwarzman#Career">almost 3/4 of $1,000,000,000 in a year</a>.</p>
<p>Not exactly on par with what a bodega owner or a farmer has a chance to make.</p>
<p>And, yes, comp may have dropped a bit since 2007. (I wonder why?) But starting comp is <a href="http://www.astburymarsden.com/documents/Banking%20and%20Financial%20Services%20Salary%20Survey%202010.pdf">still rather high</a> (PDF; keep in mind that the numbers shown are in Pounds, not Dollars; multiple by about 1.6).</p>
<p>The good news:<br />
<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;Fewer and fewer plan on making it a career, because they’re working these long hours and not getting paid as well as they were.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>
<p>
<br />Gosh, what will we do with fewer people in Securities and Investment jobs?<br />
</p>
<p>
<br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ACVWy0z9XTE/TlhOmhUrDTI/AAAAAAAAAgo/b_LbFgPzkoU/s1600/secandinv.png"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ACVWy0z9XTE/TlhOmhUrDTI/AAAAAAAAAgo/b_LbFgPzkoU/s320/secandinv.png" border="0" alt=""></a><br />
</p>
<p>
<br />Come to think of it, how popular is &#8220;<em>intermediation</em>&#8221; as a career choice since the End of the Reagan Era?<br />
</p>
<p>
<br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-DMpYvI4I-vU/TlhOmWzWLhI/AAAAAAAAAgg/i0ESxVOV730/s1600/usfire.png"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-DMpYvI4I-vU/TlhOmWzWLhI/AAAAAAAAAgg/i0ESxVOV730/s320/usfire.png" border="0" alt=""></a><br />
</p>
<p>
<br />The punchline:<br />
</p>
<blockquote><p>Last year, according to New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli, Wall Street paid out $20.8 billion in cash bonuses, instead of the $22.5 billion a year earlier.</p></blockquote>
<p>A mere $25-27,000 per person, sort of. But that&#8217;s cash alone—stock and stock options, for instance, are not included.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t worry, though.  I&#8217;m certain everyone who says &#8220;Do you want fries with that?&#8221; is also in line for $25,000 or so in bonus every year.  That&#8217;s why everyone knows the phrase, eh?</p>
