				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://rjwaldmann.blogspot.com/2013/01/short-takes-on-j-barro.html" target="_blank">Robert Waldmann</a> notes a decent article defined by a ridiculous title (of course lifted from his musings):</p>
<p>1) Reasonable and reasonably honest conservative list update: Josh Barro is very reasonable and quite honest. But is he still a conservative?  <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-01-14/will-obama-ruin-the-economy-to-ruin-the-republicans-.html">He sure doesn&#8217;t always sound like one.</a></p>
<p>2) About  #1) see an example of the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=kleiman+ness+monster&#038;rlz=1C1FDUM_enIT485IT485&#038;oq=kleiman+ness+monster&#038;aqs=chrome.0.57j5j0l2j62l2.3635&#038;sourceid=chrome&#038;ie=UTF-8">ness monster</a>:    <br />&#8220;But the conservative worldview is robust because of its imperviousness to evidence.&#8221; which clearly means ”But the conservative worldview is robust because it&#8217;s impervious to evidence.&#8221;</p>
<p>3) What&#8217;s with the Bloomberg Headline person ? The article explains how Conservative&#8217;s are insane and might destroy the economy to make their prediction that it will be destroyed if Obama is re-elected true.   <br />&#8220;Conservatives are sure that the Obama presidency will lead to an economic calamity, and they will prove it, if necessary.&#8221; but the headline suggests that Obama might ruin the economy.</p>
<p>Will Obama Ruin the Economy to Ruin the Republicans?</p>
<p>Did the person who wrote the headline actually read the article ?<br /> (lightly edited for readability)</p>
