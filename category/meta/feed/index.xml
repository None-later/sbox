<p>I&#8217;ll be blogging/tweeting the Kauffman Foundation&#8217;s Bloggers&#8217;s Forum tomorrow from 9:30-3:30 EDT (8:30-2:30 here in Kansas City; 6:30-12:30 in DeLong/Thomaville; in Hawaii, they&#8217;re still watching Dave Garroway).</p>
<p>You can tell it has reached maturity because tomorrow&#8217;s presenters include <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/">J. Bradford DeLong</a>, <a href="http://www.themoneyillusion.com/">Scott Sumner</a>, <a href="http://marginalrevolution.com/">Tyler Cowen</a>, and <a href="http://modeledbehavior.com/">Karl Smith</a>—and that&#8217;s just the first panel (&#8220;Recovery and Long-Term Growth&#8221;). </p>
<p><a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/">Mark Thoma</a>, <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/">Arnold Kling</a>, and the Former Dynamic Duo [<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein">Ezra Klein</a> and <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox.html">Matt Yglesias</a>] are all scheduled to follow.</p>
<p>As Brad noted, the event will be live-streamed at <a href="http://www.growthology.org/">Growthology</a> and (one assumes, as usual), the videos will be archived and available.</p>
<p>Neither your not-very-humble correspondent nor fellow AB (and now Roubini contributor) <a href="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/">Rebecca Wilder</a> will be presenting.</p>
<p>[links completed late; apologies to Ezra, Matt, and Rebecca for the delay.]</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I go away for a week and the world collapses. While most of you probably noticed that Russell Brand is available again, the other Major Separation was at Capital Gains and Games, which is now exclusively Stan Collender&#8217;s as &#8220;<a href="http://capitalgainsandgames.com/blog/stan-collender/2444/big-changes-coming-capital-gains-and-games-january">principal writer and managing editor</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is also rebranded &#8220;<a href="http://capitalgainsandgames.com/">Stan Collender&#8217;s Capital Gains and Games</a>.&#8221; (The URL remains unchanged.)</p>
<p>Stan has been driving the posting at CG&#038;G for a while now, and this seems, on balance, a good move for everyone, most especially the readers.</p>
<p>In related news, Andrew Samwick <a href="http://samwick.blogspot.com/">has gone back to being a solo artist</a>.* I suspect there are more details in the CG&#038;G posts over the past week, but I&#8217;m still catching up.</p>
<p>*If Samwick is the blogsphere equivalent of Sammy Hagar,** then <em>Vox Baby</em> was &#8220;I Can&#8217;t Drive 55,&#8221; while the new one will be&#8230;uh, someone help me out here. He&#8217;s already got a <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2012/01/the-value-of-our-financial-sector.html">Brad DeLong link</a>, which may be a better equivalent than the post-VH solo Hagar did.</p>
<p>**Comments game for Nils Lofgren-solo fans: Who are &#8220;the Supreme Court of&#8221; Economics Bloggers?</p>

<li><a href="http://underbelly-buce.blogspot.com/">Buce</a> has been on fire recently, so I&#8217;ll probably have to do a post about why <a href="http://underbelly-buce.blogspot.com/2011/05/can-taxpayers-thank-eliot-spitzer-for.html">this post</a> is so off-target, though his conclusion is correct (short version: he&#8217;s been misled).</p>
</li>
<li>If I&#8217;m reading this morning&#8217;s <a href="http://www.smartbrief.com/servlet/encodeServlet?issueid=B7FCF69E-7215-4E6D-AC62-53F6A3532773&#038;sid=4da1e808-6b9f-4d1d-bfb8-caea93b4c6d8">SIFMA Brief</a> correctly, Moody&#8217;s—whose rating skills Robert has discussed at length—(1) may downgrade US debt <a href="http://r.smartbrief.com/resp/cVvhCcmoBhBZAweeXXqh">if we spend too much </a>and (2) will downgrade US banks <a href="http://r.smartbrief.com/resp/cVvhCcmoBhBZAweltoih">unless we spend too much on them</a>.  Oh, and the banks object to regulation because it would <a href="http://r.smartbrief.com/resp/cVvhCcmoBhBZAweBelfW">&#8220;artificially&#8221; reduce asset values</a> (presumably, many of the same ones Moody&#8217;s wants protected).
</li>
<li>Relatedly, James Salt (probably h/t Felix) notes that &#8220;generous&#8221; UK banks are <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/jim-saft/2011/06/02/beware-generous-uk-banks/">playing reporting games</a>.  (The US version is to deny the rework and leave the asset marked at unsustainable levels.)
</li>
<li>That <a href="http://holykaw.alltop.com/school-superintendent-requests-school-be-turn">this is spot-on</a> would make me sadder if I thought we still lived in anything resembling a meritocracy, or even a developing economy.
</li>
<li>If we needed further evidence of that, the state with the best secondary eduction system in the country is pushing forward with <a href="http://schoolfinance101.wordpress.com/2011/06/03/the-offensively-defensive-ideology-of-charter-schooling/">privatize-the-gains</a>.
</li>
<li>I&#8217;m more and more convinced that China &#8220;is different,&#8221; but very much not certain the differences will make an ultimate difference.  Daniel Gross <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/blogs/daily-ticker/bear-china-shop-163217166.html">is inclined to think not</a>.  More on this as I finally finish my review of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Boombustology-Spotting-Financial-Bubbles-Before/dp/0470879467/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&#038;s=books&#038;qid=1305207274&#038;sr=1-1"><em>BoomBustOlogy</em></a>, which you should expect to see some time before the apocalypse.
</li>
<li>I assume everyone has already seen <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/group/scspi/cgi-bin/facts.php">this</a>.  Just in case, <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/group/scspi/cgi-bin/facts.php">check out the facts</a>, stylised or not.
</li>
<li>Oh, and Felix is wrong <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2011/05/31/the-stocks-housing-disconnect/">here</a>.  But that&#8217;s a post that will probably never be written by me.  Someone else want to send it in?</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Between deadlines and strange website blockages, I missed this yesterday.  Via <a href="http://www.interfluidity.com/v2/1095.html">Steve Randy Waldman</a> (whose &#8220;Interfludity&#8221; is blocked) and Mark Thoma (whose isn&#8217;t) comes <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2011/01/to-all-maxine-udall-girl-economist-readers.html">Really Bad News</a>:<br />
<blockquote><a href="http://www.maxineudall.com/2011/01/to-all-maxine-udall-girl-economist-readers.html">To all Maxine Udall Girl Economist Readers</a>: It is with great sadness that we bring you the news that Dr. Alison Snow Jones, aka Maxine Udall, Girl Economist, passed away suddenly on Monday, January 17, 2011. &#8220;<a href="http://www.maxineudall.com/2011/01/what-price-microfinance.html">What Price Microfinance</a>&#8221; was her last post.</p></blockquote>
<p>She was in her early- to mid-50s, <a href="http://publichealth.drexel.edu/Departments/Health_Management_Policy/Faculty_and_Staff/Alison_Snow_Jones_PhD/773/">estimating by her c.v.</a>.</p>
<p>Go <a href="http://www.maxineudall.com/">read what you missed</a>, and what we will all miss going forward.  <strong>UPDATE</strong>: For instance, <a href="http://www.maxineudall.com/2011/01/economics-art-or-science.html">this post</a>, which is both (1) the only valuable thing ever to be sourced to treating a David Brooks column as if it were rational and (2) a much more generous reflection on economics that the data currently appears to warrant (until you realise the math/model that will be required to reach the goal).</p>
