				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is just a little visual fun. Think about that saying “a billion here, a billion there, soon you&#8217;re talking about<a href="http://www.xinjo.com/interesting/a-little-visual-perspective-on-the-87-billion-being-spent-on-iraq?eref=rss_full"> real money</a>”.</p>
<p>Personally, I think visuals like this need to be circulated more frequently so that people have a better understanding when the government or business speaks dollar amounts. It might help them pause about whether they think something such as a war is really getting them a better life.  Or just how much of a relative tax break they are getting.</p>
<p>But for the war, we&#8217;re talking trillions so:<br />Here is some perspective on TRILLION:<br />Trillion = 1,000,000,000,000.The country has not existed for a trillion seconds.Western civilization has not been around a trillion seconds.One trillion seconds ago – 31,688 years – Neanderthals stalked the plains of Europe.</p>
<p>Here is another one I like: <a href="http://www.lcurve.org/">The L Curve</a></p>
<p>Last but not least is this one that is actually a presentation being made to our legislators concerning our military budget.<br /><a href="http://www.truemajorityaction.org/oreos/">The Oreo Cookie </a></p>
