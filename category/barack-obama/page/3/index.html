                                <p>Okay.  There’s no way to do justice to Washington Post centerist columnist Dana Milbank’s column today about Obama’s “presser” yesterday by just summarizing it or quoting a sentence or short paragraph from it.  And justice for that column, titled “<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/dana-milbank-president-congeniality-talks-tough/2013/01/14/6f5b50a0-5e9d-11e2-90a0-73c8343c6d61_print.html">President Congeniality talks tough</a>,” is what I want.  So here are the first six (blessedly short) paragraphs of it:
<div dir="ltr">“I’m a pretty friendly guy,” President Obama said near the end of his White House news conference Monday afternoon.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">The claim might have been a touch more plausible if he hadn’t spent the bulk of the previous hour demonstrating just how adversarial he could be. Indeed, there was no precipitating event that led him to schedule the last-minute session in the East Room — lending credibility to the theory that he summoned reporters so he could bait Republicans.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">“If congressional Republicans refuse to pay America’s bills on time, Social Security checks and veterans benefits will be delayed,” the friendly president said, explaining his refusal to negotiate over increasing the debt limit.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">Calling the opposition’s stance “absurd,” Obama advised Republicans that they “have two choices here: They can act responsibly and pay America’s bills, or they can act irresponsibly and put America through another economic crisis. But they will not collect a ransom in exchange for not crashing the American economy. . . . And they better choose quickly, because time is running short.”</p>
</div>
<div dir="ltr">And that was just the opening statement. The hectoring continued through the Q&#038;A. Exactly one month after the massacre at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn., Obama said of debt-reduction talks: “What I will not do is to have that negotiation with a gun at the head of the American people.”</p>
</div>
<div dir="ltr">The Republicans’ view, President Congeniality added, “was rejected by the American people when it was debated during the presidential campaign. . . . But if the House Republicans disagree with that and they want to shut down the government to see if they can get their way on it, that’s their prerogative.”</div>
<p>I agree completely.  The president should never summon White House reporters to the White House press room in order to hold a press conference.  Or at least not to bait Republicans.</p>
<p>And, I guess, not even to respond to Republican daily baiting of him by falsely telling the public that a quirk in the law, requiring Congress to authorize the Treasury to pay the government’s already-incurred bills and bond interest, and pay such things as salaries to military personnel, air traffic controllers, Agriculture Department food inspectors, and Homeland Security airport marshals&#8211;not to mention not-yet-but-about-to-be owed Social Security payments, Medicaid payments to nursing homes, and Medicare payments to physicians and hospitals&#8211;is instead a request by the president and the Democrats in Congress to increase spending appropriations.  </p>
<p>No, sir.  Much better to allow the Republicans to prey on the public’s misunderstanding of the phrase “raise the debt ceiling.”   </p>
<p>Pass the ransom note, Republicans. Just do it through the mainstream media, as you have been doing.  They’ll happily repeat your message, <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2013/01/will-republicans-debt-ceiling-is-about.html">complete with disinformation</a>, without adding their own: a brief explanation of what the debt ceiling actually is.  Apparently, congressional reporters, unlike the White House press corp, don’t mind being summoned as bait.  Nor do the Sunday talk-show folk.  </p>
<p>Worms, all. </p>
<p>Milbank does allow that:</p>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">Arguably, Obama’s no-more-Mr.-Nice-Guy approach is good politics. His first-term experience made clear that he gained nothing from Republicans when he took a passive approach. When it comes to getting things done in Washington, there’s no substitute for forceful presidential leadership. Teddy Roosevelt, whose oil-on-canvas likeness gazed at Obama from an East Room wall, probably would have approved.</div>
<p>Actually, not even just arguably, Milbank conflates statements of fact&#8211;in this instance, fact about what the debt ceiling is&#8211;with politics.  Certainly, correcting the opposition’s campaign of disinformation, and educating the public about a critical but technical statute that almost no one other than Washington pols, fiscal-policy wonks, and journalists who cover these people and subjects are familiar with, is damn good politics.  It is, in fact, absolutely necessary politics.  It’s dereliction-of-duty-for-failure-to-do-so politics.  </p>
<p>But statements of fact, and statements of policy based on the statements of fact, are not themselves mere politics.  They’re statements of fact and statements of policy based on those facts. </p>
<p>What’s most disturbing about this column is not that one high-profile political columnist confuses these things, but that he says that the entire White House press corp in attendance at the press conference yesterday does.  </p>
<p>So I suggest that they get out more.  Milbank, for example, might consider stepping out of Washington and into, maybe, Baltimore.  Not a long drive, really.  There, he could stop in at a coffee shop or mall and maybe ask people whether they had heard or read of Obama’s comments yesterday and, if so, whether they understood more now about the what debt ceiling statute is than they did a day before.</p>
<p>Then he can report his findings to the rest of the White House press corp.  And offer a different theory about the reason Obama summoned them to the press room yesterday.</p>
<p>Or he could <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2013/01/rep-greg-walden-r-or-explains-debt.html">just</a> <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2013/01/obama-we-are-not-deadbeat-nation-but.html">start</a> <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2013/01/see-harold-meyersons-washington-post.html">reading</a> <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2013/01/call-this-spade-spade-deadbeat-threat.html">Angry</a> <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2013/01/the-continued-necessity-of-explaining.html">Bear</a>.  </p>
<p>Seriously, I hope Paul Krugman and other “names” will expose Milbank’s argument for what it is. Obama has that tendency to cower whenever a media meme takes hold on fiscal-policy issues. Milbank and the White House press corp don’t read Angry Bear, but they might read Krugman’s blog. 
<div>  Nah; probably not.  It’s not like Krugman’s a centerist, or anything.  Still, it’s worth a shot, especially since what matters most is that Obama or someone close to him might.<br /> <i>This</i> Bear is <i>really</i> ANGRY today.</p>
<p>&#8212;-</p>
<p>&#8212;-</p>
<p>UPDATED:  Well, I woke up this morning to a few congratulatory emails, including from some Bears, telling me that Paul Krugman linked to my post yesterday <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/">in a blog post of his</a>.  Awesome!  (Thanks, Prof. Krugman.  And thanks to everyone for the congrats.)  </p>
<p>But I also want to republish here as an update an exchange between Bear JazzB. and me in the comments to the post:</p>
<div dir="ltr">JazzBumpa:   I always thought Milbank was more or less OK.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">But this is really stupid.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">Me:  Milbank was terrific back when he was the Post’s WH correspondent during the first G.W. Bush term, JazzB. But he rarely writes anything in his column that I think is really insightful or informative, and sometimes he writes a column that’s just baffling. Like yesterday’s.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">What really dismays me is that he and some of the other “name” pundits flat-out missed the purpose of Obama’s Monday press conference. Obama was explaining what the debt ceiling law actually is&#8211;and what it is not. An explanation that was (and is) necessity because it’s a law that sounds like it means something that it does not, and that means something that it does not sound like it means&#8211;a fact that the Repubs have abused nearly every time one of them says anything publicly about it.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">Dave Weigel <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/01/barack_obama_s_last_first_term_press_conference_the_president_spoke_of_republicans.html">wrote</a> a [Politics article]* on Slate on Monday after the press conference that started out sounding like he missed the point&#8211;and then, wham!  He hit the nail on the head, pointing out that back in Sept. Obama said he planned to speak much more, directly, to the public and explain policy issues.  Weigel said that the Repubs mocked that then, but learned on Monday what he meant.  </div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">And it does seem that the Repubs did learn a lot on Monday, because since then, several have publicly acknowledged that the debt ceiling game is over.  Yet Milbank and a few other pundits didn’t catch on.</div>
<p>And as long as I’m updating here, I’ll indulge myself and republish another exchange I had in the Comments to the post&#8211;this one with FastCommerce:</p>
<div dir="ltr">FastCommerce:  Worms. You an idiot.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">Me:  Oh, dear. FastCommerce, it looks like you took the BAIT.</div>
<p>So sorry, folks.  But I couldn’t resist.</p>
<p>&#8212;-<br />*In my original comment, I said Weigel wrote a blog post.  Actually, what he wrote was a full-length article, not a comment or short piece on his Slate blog.  (Those of us who are longtime Slate addicts know there’s a difference.)</div>

<div dir="ltr">The issue here is whether America pays its bills.  We are not a deadbeat nation.  … This is the United States of America. We can’t manage our affairs in terms of the way we pay our bills? … I don’t think anyone would consider my position unreasonable.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">&#8212; President Obama, <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2013/01/obama-press-conference-no-ransom-for-raising-debt-ceiling-86144.html?hp=t1_3">today</a></div>
<p>So President Obama <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2013/01/call-this-spade-spade-deadbeat-threat.html">does</a><a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2013/01/call-this-spade-spade-deadbeat-threat.html"> read Angry Bear</a>.  Cool!</p>
<p>Seriously, folks, I’m so happy that Obama’s beginning an intense campaign to educate the public about the quirky statute at issue in the debt-ceiling campaign.  About what “raising the debt ceiling” actually means, technically&#8211;that is, an authorization for the Treasury to pay already-incurred financial obligations&#8211;and about what the result would be if that authorization is not made.</p>
<p>Now I hope he quickly takes up Boehner’s challenge, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/15/us/politics/obama-to-press-house-gop-on-debt-limit.html?partner=rss&#038;emc=rss&#038;src=igw&#038;pagewanted=all&#038;_r=0">repeated today</a>, that “The American people do not support raising the debt ceiling without reducing government spending at the same time.”  As in: Oh?  The American people do think the United States should default on its already-incurred financial obligations?  Really?  Pray tell, Mr. Speaker, what is your evidence of that?</p>
<p>I hope Obama goes further, though, and publicly and specifically addresses the remainder of Boehner’s comments, which were:</p>
<div dir="ltr">The consequences of failing to increase the debt ceiling are real, but so too are the consequences of allowing our spending problem to go unresolved.  Without meaningful action, the debt will continue to act as an anchor on our economy, costing American jobs and endangering our children’s future. The House will do its job and pass responsible legislation that controls spending, meets our nation’s obligations and keeps the government running, and we will insist that the Democratic majority in Washington do the same.</div>
<p>Responding to Mr. Obama’s remarks, the House speaker, John A. Boehner of Ohio, said in a statement: </p>
<div dir="ltr">The American people do not support raising the debt ceiling without reducing government spending at the same time. The consequences of failing to increase the debt ceiling are real, but so too are the consequences of allowing our spending problem to go unresolved.  Without meaningful action, the debt will continue to act as an anchor on our economy, costing American jobs and endangering our children’s future. The House will do its job and pass responsible legislation that controls spending, meets our nation’s obligations and keeps the government running, and we will insist that the Democratic majority in Washington do the same.</div>
<p>My suggestion for a reply to that:</p>
<div dir="ltr">Ah.  I see.  That’s why a substantial majority of your caucus insists upon no tax rate increases, no loophole closings, and supports the adoption of the Ryan budget that would add trillions of dollars to the national debt and, by its drafter’s own concession, wouldn’t begin to decrease the debt until … when?  That’s why you folks supported a presidential candidate who wanted to lower tax rates across the board by 20%.  That’s why you and so many of your colleagues supported the Bush tax cuts in 2001 and again, more nearly two years after 9/11 and after the Iraq war began, in 2003?  And that’s why you refuse to identify the specific budget cuts you want, and instead keep asking me to do it for you?</div>
<p>Checkmate.  </p>
<p>We’re not yet a deadbeat nation.  But the Republicans are a deadbeat party.</p>

                                <p>Either that or he means that the public understands what the debt-ceiling statute actually is, and will never support Congress’s authorization of payment of already-incurred expenses earlier authorized by none other than Congress itself. </p>
<div dir="ltr">Obama and the congressional Dems should take the ball Walden has handed them and run with it.Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York, signed on to the trillion-dollar coin plan, telling <a href="http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/politics/2013/01/7052758/looking-next-debt-ceiling-fight-nadler-proposes-trillion-dollar-coi">Capital New York</a>: “It sounds silly but it’s absolutely legal. And it would normally not be proper to consider such a thing, except when you’re faced with blackmail to destroy the country’s economy, you have to consider things.”</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">But he might find resistance from Representative Greg Walden, Republican of Oregon, who said he would introduce legislation to close the loophole and end the debate once and for all.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">“My wife and I have owned and operated a small business since 1986. When it came time to pay the bills, we couldn’t just mint a coin to create more money out of thin air,” Mr. Walden said.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">&#8212; <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/10/business/a-trillion-dollar-coin-brings-a-jackpot-of-jests.html?ref=todayspaper">A Trillion-Dollar Coin Brings a Jackpot of Jests</a>, Annie Lowrey, New York Times, Jan. 9 H/T Dan Crawford, <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2013/01/the-moral-imperative-of-debt-ceiling.html">below</a></div>
<p>Presumably, Walden and his wife therefore paid the bills their small business had incurred via contracts he and his wife entered into on behalf of the business, such as utility bills for past months, bank loans, labor costs, rent, and inventory or raw-material purchases.  Unless, that is, they decided not to authorize payment of those bills and lost their business, necessitating Walden’s career change. </p>
<p>Walden ought to explain those basics to his party’s House leader, John Boehner, who as recently as two days ago reportedly said the public will never accept a debt ceiling increase without an accompanying spending cut.  </p>
<p>By which, I assume, he means that as long as the Republicans keep playing on the public’s lack of knowledge about what the quirky debt-ceiling statute actually concerns, and keep telling the public falsely that an increase in the debt ceiling is an increase in future spending appropriations rather than an authorization to allow the Treasury to pay already-incurred expenses, the public will never support Congress’s authorization to pay the federal government’s already-incurred expenses and prevent what would be the small-business-analogy causing the collapse of the business for failure to pay its already-accrued operating expenses.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure he&#8217;s wrong even about that, since polls indicate that a majority of the public does not want the types of spending reductions that the Republicans want.  Which, of course, is why the Repubs are refusing to actually specify to the public what, exactly, the do want cut, and by how much.  But this much is certain: the public will support congressional authorization to pay already-incurred financial obligations.  Just as Walden and his wife thought it best for them to pay their small business&#8217;s bills rather than default on them and lose the business.  Even if that meant taking out a small-business bank loan in order to do that.  </p>
<p>And here&#8217;s betting that, at times, it did.</p>

<div dir="ltr">This shift from wages to profits is called redistribution. It is the central fact of American economic life. And it is the primary reason that economic inequality in the United States has skyrocketed.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">Yet wages, which are descending, are taxed at a higher rate than income derived from corporate profits — capital gains and dividends. Far from mitigating the consequences of this shift, the U.S. tax code reinforces the redistribution from wages to profits. Broadly speaking, it rewards the winners of this epochal shift and penalizes the losers, who are the vast majority of Americans.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">The lower tax rates for capital gains and dividends, then, effectively reward offshoring more than work done within the United States, increase economic inequality and deprive the federal government of revenue it will need to support an aging population and meet its other obligations. None of this upsets Republicans, but it would be nice if Democrats realized that these tax breaks undermine everything they stand for.</div>

<p>Yesterday <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2013/01/the-continued-necessity-of-explaining.html">I wrote</a> that I expect the Dems to recapture control of the House in the 2014 election, despite the current extreme-gerrymandering.  I listed reasons why, and noted that while it’s been reported that in order to do that the Dems would have to win nationally, in the aggregate, in House races by between 7% and 8%, they did that in 2006 and 2008; at least that’s what I read recently.  </p>
<p>A main focus of that post was on the importance of ensuring that the public actually understands that “raising the debt ceiling” is not raising appropriations but, instead, simply authorizing payment by the Treasury of already-appropriated expenditures.  </p>
<p>But there are other tremendously important facts that the Dems badly need to tell or explain to the public.  One is something that I was shocked to read a day or two: that Defense Department appropriations have doubled in the last decade, from about $270 billion to (if I recall correctly) about $580 billion&#8211;during a decade of dramatic tax reductions.</p>
<p>Another is that the budget deals of the last two years, including the “fiscal cliff” one, coupled with a (however-slowly) recovering economy (fueled partly, at least in the rust-belt Midwest, by the auto-industry bailout), will have reduced the national debt by about $2.7 trillion dollars.  A fourth of that (if I correctly recall the article I read) is from the tax hikes in the fiscal cliff deal.  Y’know, the part of that deal that the Republicans fought so hard against and that most of their House delegation voted against.  The remainder comes from&#8211;yup&#8211;reductions in federal spending. </p>
<p>Obama of course will tout the reductions in federal spending, in his inaugural and State of the Union addresses.  He probably also will mention the added revenue from the fiscal-cliff-deal tax-rate increases on the very wealthy.  </p>
<p>But he also needs to point out&#8211;to say and then explain&#8211;what Meyerson does in his column today.  </p>
<p>Obama, it seems, thinks that explaining anything economics-related to the masses is like explaining rocket science to people like, say, me.  It’s not. He needs to do it.  He needs a speechwriter who, rather than concentrating on writing memorable, lofty lines&#8211;the standard job of presidential speechwriters&#8211;actually understands fiscal policy and can, and will, craft a speech that explains it in the way some of the best liberal pundits do.  </p>
<p>But if he doesn’t do that, others, I trust, <a href="http://www.tnr.com/blog/plank/111731/welcome-another-golden-era-liberal-senators">will</a>.  And soon.  They’ll do effectively enough to create a public groundswell that will win the House for the Dems next year.</p>

<div dir="ltr">In the wake of the fiscal deal raising taxes only on income over $450,000, Republicans are declaring that the debate over taxes is finished. The next fiscal deal will contain nothing in new revenues. Yesterday, Mitch McConnell <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/sen-mitch-mcconnell-tax-issue-finished-151934787--abc-news-politics.html">said</a>:</p>
</div>
<div dir="ltr">“The tax issue is finished. Over. Completed. That’s behind us. Now the question is what are we going to do about the biggest problem confronting our country and that’s our spending addiction. We didn’t have this problem because we weren’t taxing enough.”</p>
</div>
<div dir="ltr">As <a href="http://www.tnr.com/blog/plank/111664/mcconnell-taxes-behind-us-meet-the-press-obama-debt-ceiling-sequester-cuts">Jonathan Cohn notes this morning</a>, this talking point may have some potency: Hey, we just raised taxes on the rich, so the next bite at the apple should be focused on spending cuts, right? So it’s worth putting the GOP demand in clearer perspective. What Republicans are saying here is that they intend to use the debt ceiling as hostage to ensure that all of the deficit reduction in the coming “grand bargain” is paid for by spending cuts — such as cuts to entitlements and other social programs — with not a penny coming from new revenues via the closing of loopholes and deductions enjoyed by the rich.</div>

<p>A hallmark of the Romney campaign was its pathological tendency to make bald misrepresentations of fact and to reiterate and reiterate the misrepresentation even after almost everyone knew it was false.  Sometimes everyone knew the statement was false as soon as the statement was made; it contradicted what everyone already knew.  Other times&#8211;or at least one other time&#8211;everyone knew the statement was false after, say, the CEO of the auto company that Romney said was closing a major plant in Ohio and moving the jobs to China said in a highly-publicized statement what everyone in or near the locality of the plant already knew: that the story was false and that the plant had recently expanded and was about to increase its workforce there.  And still other times, everyone learned that the statement was false because the Obama PAC corrected the misrepresentation with TV commercials, or the news media pointed out often enough that the statement was false. </p>
<p>But those misstatements of fact didn’t concern technical matters of law or economic fact that almost no one actually knows.  Which is why the debt ceiling matter is so susceptible of misrepresentation that “raising the debt ceiling” means increasing budget appropriations, when actually it means making available enough money to pay bills already accrued from earlier budget appropriations.  This is a technical issue made in Tea Party heaven, albeit many decades before the Tea Party was born. </p>
<p>So, isn’t it paramount the president explain to the public what the debt ceiling issue actually is, rather than allowing the Republicans to keep misinforming the public that it’s an increase in budget allocations rather than a payment for budget allocations already made?  This quirk in the law&#8211;the requirement that Congress authorize payment of costs already budgeted, already promised (e.g., in bond interest, Medicare payments, Social Security payments, veterans benefits)&#8211;is something that almost no member of the general public knows.</p>
<p> Obama keeps saying, in a single sentence, that he won’t allow default on money already appropriated and owing.  That’s nice.  But does he really not understand that this goes right over most people’s heads, because the Repubs keep telling them the opposite, and because the debt ceiling law is a technicality that most people simply don’t know about, and because that technicality has no counterpart in, say, normal living experience?</p>
<p>This is beginning to seem to me like the 2009-2010 ACA debate, redux&#8211;with the rightwing misinforming the public, and Obama thinking that the public knows specifics that the public flatly does not know.</p>
<p>So here’s a suggestion: Obama’s shown a fondness for adopting the Republicans’ messaging by analogizing the federal government to a family’s finances, even though this analogy, when it involves economic stimulus and other fiscal-appropriations issues, actually amounts to a misrepresentation of fact.  But on the debt ceiling matter, the government-is-similar-to-families analogy is exactly apt.  If someone already runs up large credit card bills, he owes the money even if he decides to rip up his credit cards and stop running up personal debt.  If he doesn’t pay the credit card bills he’s accrued, he’s DEFAULTING on those debts, and his credit rating will plunge.  And if someone owes monthly mortgage payments, he can’t simply stop paying them, and expect to keep his home.  He’ll lose the home in a foreclosure proceeding.</p>
<p>See? Not hard to explain.  But if Obama can’t or won’t explain this, some other Democrat who can garner the public’s attention should.  My suggestion: Bill Clinton.  And if Clinton won’t, then maybe Joe Biden can.</p>
<p>And after this success, maybe they can begin to torpedo the Republicans’ “Greece” canard by actually providing the public with facts.  Such as that Greece has a much smaller, less comprehensive social safety-net system than the U.S., than Germany, than Holland, than Canada, than Australia, than ….  It also has a deeply embedded culture of low rates of taxes, tax payments and tax collections.  Unlike Germany, Holland, Canada, Australia ….  </p>
<p>Which might suggest that McConnell didn’t know what he’s talking about when he said we didn’t have this problem because we weren’t taxing enough.  Especially since we didn’t have this problem when, say, during the Clinton years, we were.</p>
<p>That spending addiction of ours, of course, goes by the some familiar names.  Those names include Medicare, Social Security, Medicaid (including nursing home payments for incapacitated elderly who’ve exhausted their savings), and unemployment insurance.  They also include the Defense Department, Veterans Affairs, Homeland Security, the Food and Drug Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, air traffic controllers, the National Transportation Safety Board, the Centers for Disease Control, medical research grants, supplemental aid to states for education, the Federal Emergency Management Administration, the Agriculture Department (food safety), and farm price supports.  Not to mention “tax expenditures” to, say, ExxonMobil.</p>
<p>All of which the president should mention in his two big speeches this month: the inaugural speech and the State of the Union address.  Maybe then the Republicans will suggest what parts of our spending addiction they want us to confront, and how&#8211;exactly&#8211;they think we should confront them.  </p>
<p>Since, unlike Greece, we didn’t have this problem because we weren’t taxing enough. </p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>I want to remove <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2013/01/harry-reid-throws-down-gauntlet-in.html?utm_source=feedburner&#038;utm_medium=feed&#038;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+blogspot%2FHzoh+%28Angry+Bear%29" target="_blank">the post I posted this afternoon called “Harry Reid Throws Down the Gauntlet In Front of … Obama.  Hurray.”</a>  I think Reid has done exactly that, and I think he’ll play a much larger role in the debt ceiling debate and other fiscal-policy debates going forward, as will the other Dem senators.  Obama will have to get Reid’s approval before he caves on anything major.  And I don’t think Reid will approve of any major cave.  So it doesn’t matter that much whether Obama wants to cave.  What matters is the extent to which Reid will let him cave.  </p>
<p>The main point of my post was to say that the pol/pundit/news-analysis crowd seems to have missed this.  But in my post, I also said I’m glad that the agreement was reached, and gave my reasons why I thought it was better than going over the cliff.  I said I was concerned about the effect of failing to extend unemployment insurance, and some other things.  And, although I didn’t say this in my post, I think Boehner would not have allowed an up-or-down vote on the $250,000 income-tax-hike floor, so some compromise probably would have come about then anyway.</p>
<p>But I’ve changed my mind&#8211;or, rather, I’m just not sure&#8211;that going over the cliff would not have gotten a better result on the Bush tax cuts.  So &#8230; apologies to my hero.  I agree with Paul Krugman, after all. <br /> Whew.  A return to normalcy.</p>
<p>That said, I don’t think this deal is the end on the issue of the permanence of the Bush tax hikes.  I think that during the upcoming debt ceiling controversy, the public will come to realize that important expenditures will have to be cut, or the deficit reduced less, because of the loss of revenue as a result of the failure to end those tax cuts except for those with incomes above $450,000, and the failure to lower the estate tax floor (a real travesty).  </p>
<p>But while Obama can’t seem to articulate this with any specificity or clarity, others&#8211;including Elizabeth Warren&#8211;in the new Senate will, I think.  The public is paying attention.  And Obama is no longer the only Democratic game in town.  A recognition of this is what’s been missing from most of the commentary and analysis.  But the next two years, and the 2014 campaign, will be playing out on a Dem-policy home field.  The Republicans lost the home-field advantage when they lost the election.  </p>
<p>To borrow a line from Ann Romney, it’s our turn now. <br /> Should I leave the earlier post, or remove it, readers?</p>
<p>&#8212;-</p>
<p>UPDATE:  Oh, no! I’ve changed my mind again!  I just read Matthew Yglesias’s take on all this, and he agrees with my first post.  (Okay, my first post agrees with his take; he posted first.)  And he’s completely convinced me that I was right the first time.</p>
<p>So, now the question is: Should I remove this post?  OMG.  This cliff thing is really stressing me out.</p>
<p>The <i>good</i> news, now that I&#8217;ve changed my mind again, is that Yglesias thinks Krugman agrees with my first post, not my second one. </p>
<p>&#8212;-</p>
<p>SECOND UPDATE:  Wow.  A consensus is developing.  I was right the first time!  </p>
<p>Seriously, E. J. Dionne posted <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/ej-dionne-jr-its-better-than-it-looks/2013/01/02/650ebe02-550b-11e2-bf3e-76c0a789346f_story.html?hpid=z2">the definitive column on this</a>.  He&#8217;s right.  This is a significant start to a progressive future.  That was my immediate reaction.  And it&#8217;s my final one.</p>

                                <p>
<div>Yesterday in Springfield, Ohio, the crowd listening to Barack Obama booed when the President brought up Mitt Romney and the Republican Congress. That prompted Obama to <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/11/02/remarks-president-springfield-oh" target="_blank">say</a>:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>“No, no, no — don’t boo, vote. Vote! Voting is the best revenge.”
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Romney promptly pretended to be very outraged by this. He <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2012/11/03/romney_vote_for_love_of_country_not_revenge.html" target="_blank">told his supporters</a>:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>“Yesterday, the President said something you may have heard by now. That I think surprised a lot of people. Speaking to an audience, he said, ‘voting is the best revenge.’ He told his supporters — voting for revenge. Vote for revenge? Let me tell you what I’d like to tell you. Vote for love of country.”
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Romney <a href="http://washingtonexaminer.com/romney-closes-big-love-of-country-vs.-revenge/article/2512532#.UJarSobDilE" target="_blank">picked up that refrain a second time</a>:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>“Did you see what President Obama said today? He asked his supporters to vote for revenge — for revenge&#8230;Instead, I ask the American people to vote for love of country.”
</p>

</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>For me, one of the most frustrating aspects of this campaign is the failure of Obama and of the news media, time and again, to pretend to accept at face value that when Romney misinterprets the meaning of a word, a phrase or a fact, it because Romney really thinks that that’s what the word, the phrase, the fact <i>means</i> or <i>indicates</i>.

<div>There are now only one-and-one-half days of campaigning left.  <i>Pleeease</i>, Mr. Obama: Ask people whether they really want a commander-in-chief and a budget-and-tax-policymaker who thinks that “voting is the best revenge” means “vote for <i>policies</i> of revenge.”

<div>English is not this guy’s second language.  And he attended a fancy college-prep school, Stanford University, Brigham Young University, Harvard Law School and Harvard’s graduate school of business.

<div>Here’s betting that he learned his English-language interpretation skills in law school and business school.

                                <p>
<div></div>
<div>The most revealing moment last night came as Ann Romney walked toward her husband onstage at the end.  That expression on her face.  I thought she looked like a woman in a binder.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>It is, I suppose, poetic justice for Romney that an obviously misspoken phrase of that sort is the catch phrase from last night.  But the phrase, while generating <a href="http://www.politico.com/politico44/sidecar/2012/10/nkingofdc-138734.html">hilarious witticisms</a>, is not the reason why Romney won’t recover.  Instead, it is the binders that Romney has placed <i>himself</i> in that surely became clear to many of his new-found fans of the last two weeks—the binders that underlie his entire campaign. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Most significantly, in my opinion, that his tax plan is, rather than the new math—as he’s been claiming—actually is <i>no</i> math. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>And that he takes contradictory positions at the same time—starkly, last night, for example, that he’s proud that because of him, virtually everyone in Massachusetts has healthcare insurance, yet Obamacare must be repealed because it’s keeping employers from hiring.  (There were others that surely became clear to a lot of people, but this one just bowled me over, because he said these two things within a few minutes of each other.)
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>And—yes; finally!—that he habitually plucks statistics out of their context and misrepresents their meaning, although the most clearly illustrative one was one that Obama wasn’t able to make fully clear last night because of time constraints on his reply to Romney’s allegation.  It will be easy for him to do so now, though.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>That statistic: Romney’s claim that Obama has reduced oil production from drilling on federal lands by 14% by denying drilling permits and leases.  Romney first claimed, falsely, that there has been a 14% reduction in oil production from drilling on federal lands <i>since Obama took office</i>.  After Obama repeatedly interjected that that was false and that the level of that oil production actually had <i>increased</i> during his administration, Romney finally qualified his claim; production had decreased by 14% <i>over the past year</i>.
</p>
</div>
<div><a name="more"></a></div>
<div>I loved it that Obama stepped forward—literally—and explained that the leases and permits that his administration had revoked were ones that the leaseholders and permit holders <i>had not been using</i>, and that <i>that was the reason</i> for the revocations; he wanted the leases and permits to be reissued to others, who would <i>use</i> them.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>That was a great moment, albeit one that probably won’t get much attention.  But even more important is that, as Andrea Mitchell explained during the NBC recap and analysis, the 14% reduction occurred (as Romney finally acknowledged) only in the last year—and that the <i>reason</i> for the drop was … a fire at, and consequent shutdown, of a major refinery in Texas!  And, even with that 14% drop in the last year, production from drilling on federal lands <i>has increased more than 10% since Obama took office. </i>
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>I think the Obama campaign should do an ad on this, saying that apparently Romney <i>thought it was Obama administration policy to have a fire at a major refinery</i>.  And that Romney’s so inept at math that he doesn’t know the difference between a 10% increase and a 14% decrease.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The public will get the point.  Romney is trying to game them. Not a particularly attractive trait in a presidential candidate.
</p>
</div>

<div>But one misuse of a statistic by Romney came earlier in the debate, and it downright <i>shouted</i> sophistry, thanks to Obama’s unmasking of it: Romney’s comparison of gas prices in January 2009 and gas prices now.  When Obama pointed out why gas prices were so low when he assumed office—and why they’ve doubled since then—I <i>knew</i> Obama would win the debate.  And when, later, during the discussion of the policy similarities between G.W. Bush’s policies and Romney’s proposed ones, Obama cleverly said Romney probably would send gas prices falling, by crashing the economy and thus lowering demand for oil, I thought then that Obama won the election last night.  </div>
<div></div>
<div>And in the light of today, I’m pretty sure of it.</div>

</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Shortly after the Denver debate two weeks ago, I <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/10/a-kiss-from-used-car-salesmanand-why.html">wrote here</a> that I thought it was critically important for Obama to not only illustrate, using Romney’s own words and his campaign’s own acknowledgment right after the debate, that Romney’s plan regarding healthcare insurance for people with preexisting medical conditions was the status quo, but also to tie that in directly with Romney’s “47 percent” speech at fundraisers. (And, yes, that probably was his standard speech at fundraisers, not something he said just at <i>that </i>one.)
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>I said in that post that Romney’s misrepresentation on such an important issue—literally, one of life and death in some instances—demonstrates his utter disregard for anyone who’s not wealthy. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>I mean, <i>really; w</i>hat, in heaven’s name, kind of person has such little regard for others that he’s willing to play a semantics game—y’know, it depends on what the meaning of “plan” is—in order to mislead people about something of <i>that</i> sort?
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>As I said in my earlier post, many of Romney’s misrepresentations at that debate succeeded either because he was using common words in a misleading way or because he was making representations of fact that the public lacks the expertise to recognize as false.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>And two things the public does know is that you can’t get medical treatment for most illnesses, nor can you get standard diagnostic tests for most illnesses, at a hospital emergency room.  And that you do receive medical bills—sometimes ones that, for people who have no multimillion-dollar annual income from Bain Capital ties, may be prohibitive—from treatment in an emergency room or in, say, an operating room after arriving at an emergency room.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>And a third thing the public knows is that some people who have no healthcare insurance do die prematurely because they failed to get a timely medical examination and resulting treatments because they had no access to them at all, or because they feared, say, the loss of their home because of the resulting bills.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>So it’s terrific that since the Denver debate, Romney, as Paul Krugman <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/15/opinion/krugman-death-by-ideology.html?hp">details today</a>, has said otherwise. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>It’s one thing to try to fool people about what you mean when you say, for example, that as president you won’t decrease the “share” of taxes paid by the wealthy.  As the last two weeks has shown, you can get away with that as long as you don’t explain that, by “share,” you mean the percentage of income of the taxpayer relative to the percentage of income of other taxpayers, not the amount or the proportion of tax <i>revenues</i> that one income bracket’s taxes will comprise.  Twenty percent of $40,000 is $8,000.  Twenty percent of $1 million is $200,000.  As in, a 20% across-the-board reduction in tax rates.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>But it’s quite another thing to try to fool people about something that doesn’t depend upon what the meaning of “is” is, or on what the meaning of “plan” is, or on what the meaning of “share” is—and that <i>they themselves actually <u>know</u> is false</i>.  Just plain, flat-out false. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>But here’s betting that most of the public <i>doesn’t</i> know that Romney actually <i>made</i> the statements he’s made about the uninsureds&#8217; access to healthcare.  They need to be informed of this.  They need to be informed of this.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>And although most people will get it without an illustration, Obama should offer this illustration, nonetheless: Could Ann Romney really have learned of her breast cancer by showing up at an emergency room and requesting a mammogram?  Could she then have had the surgery and other, ongoing treatments?  And if so, would she not then have received a bill that, for her family, would amount to pocket change but to most families would amount to financial catastrophe?
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>And then he should offer this illustration: When Ann Romney began having the symptoms that lead to her diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, could she have just shown up at the emergency room for a diagnosis?  And for the intensive, ongoing treatments for it that have put her illness into sufficient remission to enable her to speak day after day about her husband’s kindness and caring nature, and about his ability to “fix” things?
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The importance of Romney’s recent healthcare-access claims goes well beyond the obvious.  Pointing just to those instances, Obama can illustrate this fundamental truth: Not only does Romney have a deep-seated disdain for ordinary people, but he views them as simply tools to be manipulated.  At an absolute minimum, this guy is the quintessential coward. </p>
<p>Yes, a <i>coward</i>.  His <i>modus</i><i>operandi</i> is that of a con artist.  And he’s doing this even about the most fundamental matters, such as preexisting medical-condition coverage. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>And, as Steven Rattner details in a New York Times <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/15/opinion/the-radical-is-romney-not-ryan.html?ref=opinion">op-ed piece today</a>, about a veritable <i>slew</i>of other critical matters.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>So I end with the quote with which I began, and with the reference to the person quoted: Joseph N. Welch:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div><i>Have you no sense of decency, sir? At long last, have you left no sense of decency?
</p>
<p></i></div>
<div></div>
<div>Obama could do worse tomorrow night than to use that quote.
</p>
