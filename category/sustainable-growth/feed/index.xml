<p><strong>Health Care: Yes, No , Sorta, Kinda, Maybe</strong></p>
<p>Medicare rates for physicians have been, supposedly, regulated by the SGR* formula since 1998, but the formula is so wretched and lobbyists so strong the formula has been repeatedly postponed.</p>
<p>The Obama administration has been determined to do a one time catch up, which was scheduled to make an average cut of about 24% on December 1, 2010.</p>
<p>Congress has felt the heat from many different constituencies, but has been unable or unwilling to develop a new system.</p>
<p>The latest is the &#8221; “Physician Payment and Therapy Relief Act of 2010.”  Impressive title, but it is simply a one month reshuffling of some funds, a kick the can down the road   strategy that just delays the inevitable.</p>
<p>This is no way to make policy.</p>
