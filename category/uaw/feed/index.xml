				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Car sales “are growing so fast that Detroit can barely keep up,” according to an AP report published this evening bearing a Detroit dateline.  “Three years after the U.S. auto industry nearly collapsed, sales of cars and trucks are surging. Sales could exceed 14 million this year, above last year&#8217;s 12.8 million.”</div>
<div>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The report says that as a result, carmakers and their suppliers are adding shifts and hiring thousands of workers around the country.  Most of the added jobs in the upper Midwest are for the Big Three carmakers and their suppliers. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>That’s the good news.   But two of these carmakers, and many of the suppliers in the Midwest and elsewhere in the country, would have collapsed in 2009 but for the government bailout of those two carmakers.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>So the good news is really bad news, Romney told Fox News today, in sticking to his anti-bailout stance.  “The president ‘was paying off the people that supported him and that, by the way, are trying to get him re-elected,’ Romney said,” according to the AP report.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>What?  No longer a Detroit-would-have-been-better-off-without-the-bailout claim?  Just an Obama-was-paying-off-the-UAW-and-only-incidentally-saved-the-US-auto-industry-and-hundreds-of-thousands-of-jobs defense? 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>I dunno.  This doesn’t sound to me like a winning complaint for the general election.  Especially since the obvious question is: And whom will <i>you</i> be paying off as president, Mr. Romney?
</p>
</div>
