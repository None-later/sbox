<p>As the Chinese economy moves from agriculture to producing more goods and services, two things have happened.  Energy demand has gone up:

<p>It&#8217;s not much, but it&#8217;s a start, and we would be disingenuous to deny that.</p>

<p>Another major energy proposal in the McCain economic plan is ending subsidies for corn ethanol and eliminating the tariff that effectively bars to importation of sugar cane ethanol. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/13/business/13view.html?ex=1373601600&#038;en=d29d44dcc70127bf&#038;ei=5124&#038;partner=permalink&#038;exprod=permalink"> Greg Mankiw scored these on behalf of the economics profession</a> as points for McCain over Obama in the NYT over the weekend.  I agree that corn ethanol subsidies are best eliminated as soon as possible — though I note that Obama, while not going so far as McCain on subsidies, is pretty straight-talking about the limitations of corn ethanol especially considering that he represents the corn belt and not the desert.</p>
<p>On the McCain plans for promoting trade in cane ethanol — the Shorter Version of which is that he&#8217;s proposing to substitute dependence on foreign ethanol for dependence on foreign oil (*) — there are significant issues that go to the suitability of &#8220;free&#8221; markets for provision of biofuels.  Whether or not expanding trade in ethanol is a good thing depends on other institutional arrangements that are not automatic consequences of reducing tariffs and other moves to freer trade.  Since critical policy decisions are outside the reach of U.S. policymakers, economists should be concerned about making policy with the institutions we have, and not the institutions we&#8217;d like to assume we have.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s been a broad dawning that not all biofuels, and not all methods for producing all biofuels, equally satisfy all of the policy goals that they might purport to help satisfy.  Those include substituting domestic resources for imported resources, reducing fossil fuel use, and reducing the carbon intensity of liquid fuel use.  Land use issues are critical both for the global warming-related goals for biofuel use and for avoiding blowback from high food prices.  (Recent <a href="http://www.news.wisc.edu/15382">research out of UW-Madison</a> shows that redirecting marginal agricultural lands to cane ethanol in fact can be beneficial, but conversions from forests and other uses are not.)  The problem is that lowering tariffs on cane ethanol doesn&#8217;t guarantee, and indeed in the absence of other interventions would probably work strongly against, desirable land use patterns.</p>
<p>Brazil <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol_fuel_in_Brazil#Economic_and_production_indicators">produces a lot of ethanol</a> by the standards of the ethanol industry, but not a lot relative to U.S. petroleum-based fuel imports.  The former was 327,000 barrels/day in &#8217;07, whereas the latter is 13-14 million b/d (unadjusted for the energy densities of the fuels).   Growing enough cane to replace U.S. oil imports with ethanol would require on the order of half the arable land area of Brazil; major cane ethanol substitution would necessarily occur at scales where adverse land-use consequences can&#8217;t be assumed away.  Note that the current food-price spike, largely blamed on biofuel mandates, happened with only a couple percent of arable land devoted to biofuel crops.</p>
<p>Economists certainly can imagine market-based remedies for the problem, such as Pigovian taxes on certain land-use changes, to name one that Mankiw ought to support in principle.  But removing U.S. tariffs won&#8217;t make land-use regulation in countries suitable to cane growing appear by magic.</p>
<p>It wouldn&#8217;t hurt to add in liquid-fuel demand destruction on hitherto unprecedented scales for the U.S.  Along those lines, apart from his willingness to commit 15% of one year&#8217;s &#8220;clean coal&#8221; research funds to the cause of battery technology, McCain isn&#8217;t explicitly committed to more than the pending tightening of fuel economy regulations.  McCain&#8217;s long-standing hostility to rail and apparent indifference towards non-automobile transportation modes doesn&#8217;t make the job of reducing petroleum-based fuel consumption (and doing it in less painful ways to consumers than letting the price mechanism work its magic) any easier.</p>
<p>(*) Economists wouldn&#8217;t tend to be bothered by this, but it&#8217;s at odds with McCain&#8217;s energy independence rhetoric.</p>

                                <p>It&#8217;s no secret that I am no fan of NAFTA, which is to free trade what George W. Bush is to entrepreneurship.  So when Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton were talking about changes needing to be made, I yawned. (save the rustbelt, by contrast, looked up and said, &#8220;<em>Now</em> they understand?&#8221;)  Then changes they want may not be my changes—Chapter 11 must go!—but the idea that a 14-year-old trade agreement should be kept sacrosanct confuses <em>ceteris</em> with <em>paribus</em> in a manner to shame Brad DeLong.</p>
<p>But, of course, &#8220;free trade&#8221; is sacred, and the candidates were attacked for even suggesting the possibility.</p>
<p>So when The Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives pointed out that <a href="http://www.policyalternatives.ca//index.cfm?act=news&#038;do=article&#038;article_ID=1895&#038;type_ID=">changes are needed in NAFTA to avoid harming Canada</a>, I was inclined, again, to yawn.  Expect that NAFTA apparently directly contravenes Canadian law:<br />
<blockquote>The research also draws attention to the fact that even Alberta only has 8 years of established natural gas reserves remaining—in direct violation of its own legislation requiring a minimum 15 years of proven supply before any can be removed from the province. The report calls on the Alberta government to uphold its own policy.</p></blockquote>
<p>The CCPA made it clear that renegotiation may well be a question of national secutiry:<br />
<blockquote>“We looked at whether Canada could reduce exports for the sake of conservation or environmental policy, or whether we could prioritize our dwindling natural gas reserves for domestic value-added production, or even for household heating. We cannot. We cannot even guarantee eastern Canadians access to western crude,” says John Dillon, economic justice researcher at KAIROS and co-author of the report.</p></blockquote>
<p>And, therefore, renegotiating the inappropriate aspects of NAFTA is something in the interest of the Canadians as well:<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have put NAFTA back on the table with their musings about re-negotiating or ripping up the agreement,&#8221; says co-author Gordon Laxer, a political economist at the University of Alberta. &#8220;The Canadian government must realize it is the only country in the world that has jeopardized the energy needs of its people in this way, and move quickly to exit the proportionality provisions of NAFTA.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>That press release and <a href="http://www.policyalternatives.ca/documents/National_Office_Pubs/2008/Over_A_Barrel.pdf">the accompanying PDF</a> are four weeks old, a decade in blogsphere time.  While Greg Mankiw leverages George Will to <a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2008/06/wanted-more-skilled-workers.html">advocate indentured servitude</a> (sad h/t to <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/06/foreign-engineers-and-scientist.html">Spencer</a>), the need to revisit &#8220;free trade agreements&#8221; goes unremarked.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Greg Mankiw, clearly distracted by <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/05/economic-princi.html">his former collaborator&#8217;s wife having been denied a tenured position at Harvard</a>, quotes <a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2008/05/pelosi-problem.html">Fred Bergsten in the WSJ</a>, Instapundit-style:<br />
<blockquote>By effectively killing &#8220;fast track&#8221; procedures that guarantee a yes-or-no vote on trade agreements within 90 days, lawmakers in Washington, led by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, have destroyed the credibility of the U.S. as a reliable negotiating partner.</p></blockquote>
<p>Which leads to the obvious conclusion: Republicans &#8220;destroyed the credibility of the U.S. in 1998 when they did the same thing to President Clinton.</p>
<p>Strangely, <a href="http://www.economics.harvard.edu/faculty/mankiw/files/jan98.html">Greg Mankiw (Fortune, January 12, 1998)</a> &#8220;knew better.&#8221;<br />
<blockquote>Policy and politics diverged again in the fast-track debate. Clinton was asking Congress for something all recent Presidents have had&#8211;the authority to negotiate trade deals that Congress would consider without amendment. This power is crucial if the President is to continue the multilateral process that over the past half-century has moved the world toward freer trade and greater prosperity.</p>
<p>Although economists are united in support of free trade, opinion polls show the American public is more skeptical. The public&#8217;s view is partly based on the false analogy that trade is like war&#8211;some countries must lose for others to win&#8230;.</p>
<p>Because of the public&#8217;s ambivalence&#8211;and the opposition of interest groups that fear foreign competition&#8211;fast track went down to defeat. This may put an end to the multilateral approach to opening up world trade. But it need not mean an end to the free-trade movement.*</p></blockquote>
<p>Got it?  If it&#8217;s a Democratic Congress, then Pelosi is a &#8220;problem.&#8221;  If it&#8217;s a Republican Congress doing the same thing, it&#8217;s Through No Fault of Their Own.</p>
<p>And by not pointing out that he himself used to know better, Greg Mankiw destroys not Fred Bergsten&#8217;s credibility, but his own.</p>

<p>*Yes, I omitted Mankiw&#8217;s framing issue (tomatoes), but if he really wants to claim George W. &#8220;Steel Tariffs&#8221; Bush was different, the only possible response is &#8220;Bring it on.&#8221;</p>

                                <p>Back on April 20th I presented <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/04/enlightenment-you-and-me-and-china-make.html">my introduction</a> to a book by Will Hutton: The Writing on the Wall. </p>
<p>First, the book is 334 pages.  The list of references 39 pages.  There is a lot I could cover.  But this is the Angry Bear which I view as being about US(of A).  It is this part of Mr. Hutton&#8217;s writing that caught my attention.  As much as I am interested in China&#8217;s life influencing ours, I am more interested in understanding what happened to us.  </p>
<p>I presented his concept of values coming out of the Enlightenment as being the basis for what the USA (as a stand-in for referencing Western processes) had achieved and what China has to move more toward.  It is not that China must model us exactly, but that it&#8217;s current structure is limited.  It needs to be more democratic based on values from the Enlightenment.  Mr. Hutton presents the democratic Enlightenment concepts as four: <em>“accountability; representativenesss; respect for the rule of law; and the capacity, through free speech, for debate, exchange, and interaction.”    </em></p>
<p>As much as the book looks at China and how it does not meet these concepts sufficiently to allow it to grow such that it will meet the needs of it&#8217;s people, I want to focus on his view of us.  In this case, the USA specifically.  I believe he points to the USA because it was the leader in the world, as he presents the case, for manifesting the democratic Enlightenment concepts.  I believe, his view of the Enlightenment is in agreement with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment">Wiki&#8217;s presentation</a>:<br /><em>The Enlightenment is held to be the source of critical ideas, such as the centrality of freedom, democracy and reason as primary values of society. This view argues that the establishment of a contractual basis of rights would lead to the market mechanism and capitalism, the scientific method, religious tolerance, and the organization of states into self-governing republics through democratic means. In this view, the tendency of the philosophes in particular to apply rationality to every problem is considered the essential change.</em></p>
<p>The discussion of Enlightenment begins with free trade and that the USA is <em>“not a natural candidate to support an open world trading and financial system&#8230;”</em>  We benefit, but we are “<em>ambivalent</em>”. “<em>An open trading system tempts every country to pursue strategic trade policies that are much more mercantilist in their rationale&#8230;All genuflect to the rules-based openness of the trading system as regulated by the World Trade Organization.  But they believe in it more because it is the means to secure their strategic, mercantilist aims than because of any desire to create gains in which everyone would share.”  </em></p>
<p>Mr Hutton is pro free trade.  He makes a case that America&#8217;s growth was less do to protectionist positions taken early on and more the result of a growing population with access to free land.  Space and ambition were the key.  As the coasts were joined, we moved to substitute foreign trade for the loss of our frontier.  <em>“The aim was not to create an overseas empire but to export the American idea&#8230;” </em>unlike the European expansionism.  And as expected, he flatly states that free-trade is not the cause of the condition we find ourself in currently.  Though he thinks both sides, one portrayed by Lou Dobbs and the other by Friedman need to be “<em>cooled down</em>”.  They are both “<em>vastly exaggerated</em>”. </p>
<p>The source of our mis-thinking is found in how we view liberty.  “<em>Liberty, in the American narrative, is the sun under which everything flourishes.  Liberty permits individuals&#8217; hard work, courage, and application to produce wealth and happiness.  Government should not get in the way&#8230;Liberty and the American dream are linked&#8230;The great conservative counterrevolution &#8230;has been grounded in its brilliant capacity to exploit these cultural icons to support its own cause.”</em></p>
<p>But this is an error of our self perception. It is more correct to view liberty as a goal within <em>“&#8230;a highly sophisticated Enlightenment political infrastructure.”  </em>“<em>Look at the United States&#8230;and you will see an economy and society characterized by pluralism, diversity, and investment in individual capabilities.”</em></p>
<p>He bolsters this view by presenting Alexis de Tocqueville&#8217;s work about America.  <em>“Public engagement and never-ending argument leavened what otherwise might have been a culture of egoism&#8230;and transmuted it into a culture in which egalitarianism and individualism enriched each other.  Self-interest was not only a matter of bettering oneself; it was also a mattter of ensureing that there would be a vigorous public life and opportunity for others&#8230;The same impulse&#8211;wanting the best for oneself and for others— prompts much of American civic activism.”   </em>Our liberty <em>“always included conceptual egalitarianism, which provided the tension between the ambition and appetites of the propertied rich and their accountability to society.” “This is not the egalitarianism of income or opportunity; rather, it is the equality of self-esteem, self worth and possibility&#8230;there is no obstacle of title, birth, accent or social rank&#8230;”  </em></p>
<p>It make you feel proud, does it not?  Unfortunately he notes we are losing it through <em>“neglect and willful disparagement of their importance, in particular by American conservatives.”</em>  We are losing the <em>“fecund interaction”</em> of markets and the price mechanism with the Enlightenment infrastructure and resultant culture.  Mr Hutton states it was our genius.</p>
<p>This is where I will go next.  What has changed.  I believe it was my very first post via an invite from Cactus (he posted it for me) that I made the statement that we had changed.  We no longer were making money as we had.  We no longer were focused on what we use to. It was more than just tax rates that changed in the Reagan years.</p>

                                <p>From a <a href="http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB119144942897748150.html">poll by the WSJ/NBC </a>reported in October, 2007 comes:</p>
<p><em>While 60% of respondents said they want the next president and Congress to continue cutting taxes, 32% said it&#8217;s time for some tax increases on the wealthiest Americans to reduce the budget deficit and pay for health care.<br /></em><br />Can you imagine? They have started to figure out that their pocketbooks matter.</p>
<p><em>In a December 1999 Wall Street Journal-NBC poll, 37% of Republicans said trade deals had helped the U.S. and 31% said they had hurt, while 26% said they made no difference.<br />The new poll asked a broader but similar question. It posed two statements to voters. The first was, &#8220;Foreign trade has been good for the U.S. economy, because demand for U.S. products abroad has resulted in economic growth and jobs for Americans here at home and provided more choices for consumers.&#8221;<br />The second was, &#8220;Foreign trade has been bad for the U.S. economy, because imports from abroad have reduced demand for American-made goods, cost jobs here at home, and produced potentially unsafe products.&#8221;<br />Asked which statement came closer to their own view, 59% of Republicans named the second statement, while 32% pointed to the first.<br /></em><br />I don&#8217;t think these questions are the best framed.  They seem kind of load in that it states “foreign trade” instead of Free Trade, or NAFTA.  But, the qualifications I&#8217;m sure are what the people responded to.<br /><em></em><br />From <a href="http://www.timeinc.net/fortune/information/presscenter/fortune/press_releases/20080118_economysurvey.html">Fortune Magazine</a>, January, 2008:<br />This is a poll of the general public.</p>
<p><em>With much of the country worried about the state of the economy, many (67%) Americans say they now closely follow news about US trade policy with foreign countries. Americans see the current trade policy as a reason for the economic woes the US is currently facing.<br />Almost 7 in 10 (68%) Americans believe international trade benefits other countries more than it benefits the United States.<br />International trade is seen as having a largely negative impact on American workers (78% negative) and the Untied States as a whole (63%).<br />Eight in ten Americans (79%) feel the US Government has not done enough to help workers who have lost their jobs to increased foreign competition. A majority of Americans would support the following proposed policies aimed at helping workers who have lost their jobs to foreign competition and outsourcing:</em><br /><em>Policies with the greatest amount of support include: providing special training programs (90% support), providing tax incentives for companies to relocate to areas where workers have lost their jobs because of foreign imports (84%), allowing imports only from countries that ban child labor (82% support), and allowing imports from countries that meet certain clean air and water standards (78% support).<br />About two-thirds (64%) of Americans are willing to pay more to keep down foreign competition.</em></p>
<p>There is a disconnect in the above responses. 90% want training, but in another question about boosting the economy, 41% opposed extending unemployment benefits. Though 67% support public works projects. This shows me that the public has not made the connections between our current trade environment and the economy. But, how about that 64% would pay more to keep down foreign competition. Can you get a more patriotic response? I don&#8217;t think the Republican&#8217;s had this kind of patriotism in mind.</p>
<p>When it comes to China:<br /><em>Where a product is manufactured does not impact Americans&#8217; purchasing decisions except when that product is made in China.<br />Nearly three-in-five (57%) Americans are less likely to buy a product if it is made in China.<br />When products are manufactured in other areas, such as Eastern Europe (57%), Western Europe (55%), Canada (53%), India (52%), Africa (51%), Mexico (48%), Japan (47%), and South Korea (46%) nearly a majority say it doesn&#8217;t matter.<br /></em><br />I can &#8216;t imagine that people are specifically boycotting Chinese made goods. Walmart et al would be in trouble. I think this is more of a gut response.</p>
<p>Over all, the public is waking up and seems more sophisticated in their understanding than I believe the Beltway crowd is willing to accept.  But, I believe some work needs to be done so that they connect the dots of the US economy as a function of trade policy.  I would like to see a de-emphasis of the fear and a disconnecting of foreign trade equals free trade policy. I really don&#8217;t believe anyone is against trading, they just have a major problem with the current rules and the referees.</p>

I don&#8217;t know who that is, and I don&#8217;t agree with some of what&#8217;s in his article, but I do agree with this:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is also as ironic as it was predictable that Alan Greenspan &#8211; Ayn Rand “disciple” and free-market ideologue &#8211; championed monetary policies and a financial apparatus that will ensure the greatest government intrusion into our Nation’s financial and economic affairs since the New Deal. Articles berating contemporary Capitalism are becoming commonplace. I fear that the most important lesson from this experience may fail to resonate: that to promote sustainable free-market Capitalism for the real economy demands considerable general resolve to protect the soundness and stability of the underlying Credit system.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>This concept of Comparative Advantage hits a big wall if we accept the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/10/human-capital-is-where-its-at.html">World Bank&#8217;s study </a>on what generates wealth.</p>
<p>If comparative advantage is about what comes natural to a given nation, it has to include what the study referred to as natural capital. This is only 40% of the wealth generation for a poor nation but drops to 20% for a rich nation and is 5% overall world wide. Produced capital accounts for only 18% world wide.</p>
<p>77% of wealth creation is from “intangible capital”. Intangible capital is the results of societies efforts to improve it&#8217;s self as a society (making us better people). It is legal, it is education. It is civil rights, it is (or was here) free education to including college, it is management of our environment, it is (or was) the enlightenment, it is adaptation of knowledge for the betterment of living life. None of these things are the results of nature. They are the results of will and money. The money being spread for the benefit of all.</p>
<p>So, we look at China or India and see that they have taken steps to improve their society via education and legal. The comparative advantage however is still more in the natural capital. What is their “natural” capital? It is low relative wages as compared to the rich nations. Is there any naturally comparative advantage? I think not. It&#8217;s not like they are selling us natural resources. What they are selling are the results of moving the know how and productivity generating tools (using a hammer drill to drill a hole in concrete vs a star drill and hammer) to their countries. Their natural capital is in their labor.</p>
<p>This creates a dilemma for the free traders who think it is only a matter of stuff and things in exchange for currency. If 40% of poor nations wealth generation is natural capital, and produced capital is 18% of the wealth generation, then that leaves 42% of China&#8217;s wealth generation intangible. This is competing against us with numbers that most likely look closer to the world overall, 5% natural, 18% produced, 77% intangible. Being that our advantage is our society, and our society was created by creating a better distribution of wealth, then how are NAFTA, CAFTA etc. without emphasis on labor, rights, and environment promoting our comparative advantage?</p>
<p>This dilemma of promoting trade agreements on only the 2 tangible sectors of the 3 sectors that drive wealth creation ignoring that a rich country as moved vastly beyond the ratio of the 3 sectors to where investment in ones society is the dominating sector by far, is what is wrong with applying models that discuss comparative advantage as some kind of sliding scale based on only the tangibles. Wine vs wool was it?</p>
<p>We&#8217;re loosing the trade wars as a nation because we&#8217;re writing trading agreements to our partners advantage. That&#8217;s what comes of letting people who only think about business, do the trade agreements. They only think in terms of the natural capital and created capital. It is why the models are wrong when they say there will be or has to be “losers”. Bull crappy on that.</p>
