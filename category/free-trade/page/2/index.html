<p>Firedoglake presents a well written piece on US and Chinese trade policy:</p>
<p><a href="http://firedoglake.com/2009/11/22/china%E2%80%99s-industrial-policy-vs-us-random-behavior/">China’s Industrial Policy vs. US Random Behavior</a></p>
<blockquote><p>The <a href="http://www.uscc.gov/index.php">U.S. China Economic and Security Review Commission</a> has issued its <a href="http://www.uscc.gov/annual_report/2009/annual_report_full_09.pdf">annual report</a> {giant .pdf}. Robert Borosage of the <a href="http://ourfuture.org/">Campaign for America’s Future</a> hosted a conference call for the Co-Chair of the Commission, Carolyn Bartholomew, and Clyde Presotwitz of the <a href="http://www.econstrat.org/">Economic Strategy Institute</a>, who was U.S. Trade Representative under Reagan. The call offered these experts an opportunity to talk about China’s industrial policy.</p>
<p>Prestowitz said something that focused the entire issue for me. He pointed out that labor is not a significant factor in chip manufacture. Why then are so many chip manufacturing facilities located in China? He says it’s because the Chinese wanted these as part of their industrial policy, so they seized the land, built the infrastructure, provided low-cost loans, granted energy and water subsidies, trained a work force, and gave the manufacturers tax breaks. Now they offer more subtle incentives, funding for research and development, refunds of the value added tax and space in industrial parks. As Prestowitz said, the plants are there for financial reasons.</p>
<p>This is Chinese policy. They want to grow their economy by attracting foreign capital and foreign technology. They intend to maintain state control over crucial industries.</p>
<blockquote><p>China’s overall industrial policy … is characterized by three main parts: (1) the creation of an export-led and foreign investment-led manufacturing sector; (2) an emphasis on fostering the growth of industries such as high-technology products that add maximum value to the Chinese economy; and (3) the creation of jobs sufficient to reliably employ the Chinese workforce, thereby allowing the Chinese Communist Party to maintain control.</p></blockquote>
<p>Many Chinese subsidies violate the requirements of the World Trade Organization, and the US has sought sanctions, but the Commission says that the WTO rules are meant to deal with narrow issues, not the broad national practices of China. The WTO rules require consultations as well as litigation, and even after a victory, they are able to delay. By the time the US and Canada won a WTO ruling barring favoritism in manufacture of auto parts, many manufacturers had moved production to China, so those jobs were lost.</p>
<p>Don’t think that we will be able to compete with our high tech products. China uses industrial policy to achieve technology transfer. Here’s an example from the call. China had not mastered several crucial issues in the manufacture of jet propulsion blades.</p></blockquote>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Several thoughts come to mind:</p>
<p>1. Appeals to the notion that command economies fail is not re-assuring at best and grossly misleading at worst. Since 1992 Chinese leaders took a different turn from our old notions of &#8216;command&#8217; economies of cold-war stories. </p>
<p>2. China is wrenching a pre-industrial economy into the 21st century, at a speed that is breathtaking. The US is struggling with shedding 20th century notions of what we think we are&#8230;</p>
<p>3. There is no reason to think that &#8216;green shoots&#8217; industries are assured in the US as a jobs policy. Such industry building is already occurring in China (and Germany).</p>
<p>4. We insist China re-direct its drive to a domestic consumer orientation, and talk about how the government deliberately keeps the economy as an export platform, but if many times more money is made currently exporting due to high prices for exports than if sold domestically, would you change direction in a hurry? Who is getting the bargain overall? Many Chinese businesses are still learning new standards. </p>
<p>5. Chinese leaders are taking a big gamble. And Chinese society is taking a big hit overall, with great disruption in people&#8217;s lives. The US is also experiencing great change&#8230;slower perhaps, but we haven&#8217;t really accepted the fact nor figured out that we have change to no matter what.</p>
<p>6. Some of the unease on right and left is due to some sort of view of this change. Is it along the lines we are used to, and/or simply myopic?</p>

<p>Trade policy and actual trade are related but different matters. This post from last year caught my eye, partly due to the discussion on tires from China. While any blog post has to be simplified due to the nature of a short post and comment format, such discussion at times seems amazingly simplified beyond recognition of what trade entails&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://cafehayek.com/2009/03/free-trade-is-common.html" target="_blank">Cafe Hyek</a> Don Boudreau offers a thought on tariffs, but more broadly on what is free about trade. I assume he knows something of the rules of the WTO and trade restrictions imposed by these agreements.</p>
<p>So, how does one deal with claims of a theoretical &#8216;free&#8217; trade versus what?, &#8216;restricted&#8217;, &#8216;constricted&#8217;, &#8216;protectionist&#8217; trade? Do multi-national companies not have rules? Trade always has rules.</p>
<p>Is there a difference between &#8216;free&#8217; and &#8216;freer&#8217;? &#8216;Free&#8217; reminds me of lunch, and who picks up the tab. And even that simple example becomes rather convoluted. Is it even a useful term, or simply propaganda?</p>
<blockquote><p>Persons who, fancying themselves observant realists, insist that &#8220;free trade doesn&#8217;t exist&#8221; have their visions and brains distorted by political boundaries.</p>
<p>It is quite true that national governments almost universally erect barriers that hinder their citizens&#8217; freedom to trade with citizens ruled by other national governments. Some governments erect higher barriers than do other governments. But, indeed, it&#8217;s rare to find a national government that doesn&#8217;t indulge the greed of politically powerful interest groups, as well as the prejudice and economic ignorance of much of its population, with trade barriers.</p>
<p>And yet free trade is ubiquitous. Freedom to trade generally reigns within political borders. For example, the 50 U.S. states are united on one very large and very successful free-trade zone.</p>
<p>Karol, Thomas, and I live in Burke, Virginia. We are free to trade not only with cabbage growers in Culpeper, Virginia, but with cabbage growers in California. We trade freely with residents of any state, from the Atlantic to the Pacific, from the U.S. border with Canada to the U.S. border with Mexico. That is, whatever taxes and burdens Uncle Sam might impose (however wisely or foolishly) on economic activity within the U.S., those burdens are nation-wide. No special space-specific burdens are placed on my and my family&#8217;s ability to trade with other Americans; no extra tariff or restriction applies to our exchanges with an Alaskan or with a Floridian simply because we do not live in those states.</p>
<p>Practically speaking, therefore, there is free trade throughout the United States. My family and I routinely buy wine from California and Oregon, oranges and lemons from Florida, computer software from Washington state, maple syrup from Vermont, peaches from South Carolina, television newscasts from New York and Atlanta, lumber from Alabama, spicy sauces from Louisiana, crabs from Maryland. The list is long.</p></blockquote>
<p>On a random note, I am also reminded of Orrin Hatch&#8217;s amendment to the Baucus health bill that excludes any state beginning with the letter U from the excise tax on fancy plans. It seems government can be merely a part of a business plan. Do we ever approximate a &#8216;free&#8217; market, or are there more usefull approaches and language? (Before the terms are co-opted, that is)</p>
<p>Update:  I was reminded in comments that I should have included these links to aid discussion and definition from previous posts.  There were more than I remembered.<br />See these posts:<br />and directly this one on buy America and the question of how does one do that anymore with vertical specialization, which is not a sexy title??  <br /><a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/06/vertical-specialialization-in-world.html">Vertical specialization</a><br /><a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/08/trade-policy-debate-to-begin-for-mid.html">Trade policy for mid-terms 2010</a><br /><a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/08/world-trade-organization-ruling-imf-to.html">WTO rulings</a><br /><a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/02/do-not-confuse-american-companies-with.html">American jobs are not the same as American companies</a><br /><a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/03/why-is-buy-america-okay-for-banks-but.html">Tariffs not for labor, but good for banks and pharma</a></p>

<p>agrees with <a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/blogspot/Hzoh/~3/mqnM_Q3z9Vw/coming-soon-from-major-economists-near.html">Ken</a> (but observes that even Garth Brazelton falls for the &#8216;Pareto fallacy&#8217; [*]), and sees Brazelton&#8217;s (so far) <a href="http://econrevival.blogspot.com/2009/09/in-support-of-chinese-tires-tarrif.html?showComment=1252917211271#c8182452702772350673">one anonymous comment</a>, which takes issue with Brazelton&#8217;s hypothesis that the Obama administration is giving us a backdoor safety-enhancing Pigovian tax:<br />
<blockquote>This is probably incorrect. Tires like many other things need to meet standards. Tiers [sic] for America must meet American standards etc.</p></blockquote>
<p>Indeed they do, but there&#8217;s the econoworld of frictionless international trade in widgets and then there&#8217;s the sausage making of actual trade in manufactured goods.  Let&#8217;s set the Way-Back Machine just two years ago to the case of Foreign Tire Sales below the jump.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the lede of the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/26/business/worldbusiness/26tire.html">NYT account</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Federal officials have told a small New Jersey importer to recall 450,000 radial tires for pickup trucks, sport utility vehicles and vans after the company disclosed that its Chinese manufacturer had stopped including a safety feature that prevented the tires from separating.</p>
<p>[snip]</p>
<p>[NHTSA&#8217;s] top officials were “outraged” that Foreign Tire Sales’ executives waited more than two years to pass on their suspicions about problems with the tires. The company first suspected problems in October 2005. Almost a year later, in September 2006, the Chinese manufacturer, Hangzhou Zhongce Rubber, a former state-owned company based in eastern China, acknowledged that a gum strip that prevents the tread from separating was left out of the manufacturing process.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now Foreign Tire Sales did not intend to import substandard tires:<br />
<blockquote>The tires were supposed to exceed federal safety standards, partly by including a gum strip between the plies to prevent separation, and ultimately passed a road test in which they were driven 40,000 miles&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>Nevertheless, a few years into the relationship with its factory, problems started to appear:<br />
<blockquote>In October 2005, the company said it became concerned because of a sharp increase in customer complaints about the Hangzhou Zhongce radial tires. In investigating the complaints, Foreign Tire Sales’ officials became suspicious that Hangzhou Zhongce was manufacturing the tires without the gum strips or with inadequate gum strips, but the Chinese company denied it.</p>
<p>Tests of tire segments conducted by an outside firm were not conclusive but “seemed to indicate that there were no gum strips or insufficient gum strips in the inspected tires,” Foreign Tire Sales wrote in its June 11 report to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.</p></blockquote>
<p>Foreign Tire Sales&#8217;s ability to monitor its contract manufacturer and get to the bottom of the quality problems was surely compromised by the fact that it was a seven-person office that never actually touched the tires it brought into the country.</p>
<p>For the money shot:<br />
<blockquote>Hangzhou Zhongce admitted in September 2006 that it had “unilaterally decided to omit the gum strips” in the tires, the report says. The Chinese company was “generally unresponsive” when asked how many tires were involved and what they were going to do to resolve the problem, the report says.</p></blockquote>
<p>With little or no monitoring and financial returns to cutting corners, amazingly corners are cut.  Lo, incentives matter!  But that&#8217;s not all!!  Foreign Tire Sales, being asset-light, lacked the wherewithal to actually shoulder its obligations in the event of a large-scale recall.  An <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/leo-w-gerard/stop-the-toxic-trade-prof_b_103630.html">account at the Huffington Post</a> says that they were spared bankruptcy by virtue of most of the recalled tires having stayed on the road, sparing F.T.S. the expense of actually replacing them with tires more-or-less known to be up to standard.</p>
<p>The anonymous commenter makes a follow-up point:<br />
<blockquote>There used to be a term Jap Crap for Japanese stuff. Now Japan sets the standard for manufactured items. China will do the same eventually.</p></blockquote>
<p>This post was written on a Chinese-assembled laptop computer which, at age 3, is still working pretty well, so it&#8217;s not that Chinese stuff necessarily is crap.  Of course, Apple&#8217;s handle on the product quality lead of its supply chain may be better than that on its contract workplace conditions.  Certainly Korean products have improved radically since, say, Hyundai&#8217;s entry into the U.S. auto market.</p>
<p>Perhaps if we could just trade with the Aspirational China with its fast trains, gleaming 500-meter skyscrapers, massive renewable energy investments, and middle class, some of the conditions might actually hold to justify the U.S. economist hand-wringing.  Meanwhile promotion of trade should not be a suicide pact.</p>
<p>[*] I.e., because a policy may be Pareto-improving after the losers are compensated, it is worth implementing from a social welfare perspective even if we all know that the losers won&#8217;t be compensated.</p>

                                <p>Ken Houghton notes that the first thing anyone learns from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Travels-T-Shirt-Global-Economy-Economist/dp/0470287160/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&#038;s=books&#038;qid=1251736322&#038;sr=1-1">Pietra Rivoli&#8217;s <em>The Travels of a T-Shirt in the Global Economy: An Economist Examines the Markets, Power, and Politics of World Trade</em></a> is how pernicious the U.S. subsidy of its cotton industry is.*  Now the WTO has <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/01/business/global/01cotton.html?src=linkedin&#038;pagewanted=print">discovered the obvious</a>:<br />
<blockquote>American goods will face [$294.7] million in annual sanctions as a result of the United States’ failure to eliminate illegal subsidies to domestic cotton growers, the World Trade Organization ruled Monday.</p></blockquote>
<p>The NYT attempts to spin this as a loss for the complainants:<br />
<blockquote>The result was disappointing for Brazil, which has won a series of rulings against the United States over the last seven years. The Latin American country had sought to target American goods and drug patents for $2.5 billion worth of economic retaliation.</p></blockquote>
<p>But gets to the order-of-magnitude-other-way-part a few paragraphs later:<br />
<blockquote>Washington had argued that the award should not exceed $30 million. </p></blockquote>
<p>So no one is happy, but it&#8217;s a start:<br />
<blockquote>“The subsidies paid by the United States to its 25,000 cotton farmers exceed the entire gross national income of virtually every cotton-exporting country in West and Central Africa,” Mr. McGivern said. “Despite several rounds of litigation and ministerial-level negotiations, this issue remains unresolved.”</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>The cotton case was the first agricultural case started by a developing country in the group’s history.</p></blockquote>
<p>The issue of generic drugs and trade is dealt with in <a target="_blank" href="http://healthaffairs.org/blog/2009/08/28/trade-rules-limit-availability-of-generics/">this <em>Health Affairs</em> piece</a> (of which maybe more later).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, those interested in a certain absurd claim previous dealt with by Susan of Texas (see <a target="_blank" href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/08/innovation.html">here</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://agonyin8fits.blogspot.com/2009/08/mcardle-admits-her-anti-health-care.html">here</a>, for instance) and <a target="_blank" href="http://firemeganmcardle.blogspot.com/2009/08/about-wapo-chat.html">others</a>, check out <a target="_blank" href="http://www.healthaffairs.org/press/julaug0912.htm">this press release from <em>Health Affairs</em> from last week</a>.  Good thing those countries don&#8217;t have a system that supports pharmaceutical innovation and investment better than the U.S. one.</p>

<blockquote><p>America’s economy is now struggling to recover from the Great Recession. But even when the economy was said to be humming, it did not work for most Americans. Wages were stagnant or declining and the costs of basics – health care, housing, college – were soaring. Growth was built on unsustainable debt, as the country borrowed $2 billion a day from abroad and Americans spent more than they earned. Wall Street captured fully 40 percent of the country’s profits.</p>
<p>President Obama has stated that we can’t go back to the old economy, and shouldn’t want to. We must make more, sell more and consume less. The question is: What is our economic strategy in a global economy?</p>
<p>“The fight for American manufacturing is the fight for America’s future,” Obama has declared. That fight will require a fundamentally different economic strategy, one that will ensure a sustained prosperity that is widely shared, one that will leave the American dream within reach of those who work hard.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>So how do we actually start?</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>I&#8217;ve said before that the &#8220;Buy American&#8221; provisions in the stimulus bill were not exactly a major issue. (I believe the phrase was roughly, &#8220;could drive a broken Mexican truck through the holes, even if dead drunk.&#8221;)  Many economists (hi, <a target="_blank" href="http://econospeak.blogspot.com/2009/02/revoke-krugmans-nobel-prize.html">Barkley</a>) disagreed, even while some acknowledged that the income effect from &#8220;buying American&#8221; would be <a href="http://worthwhile.typepad.com/worthwhile_canadian_initi/2009/01/buy-domestic-policies-are-individually-irrational-too.html">mitigated by the substitution effect on the FX rate</a>, while others noted that reprisal threats <a target="_blank" href="http://worthwhile.typepad.com/worthwhile_canadian_initi/2009/02/only-idiots-start-wars-they-cant-win.html">just might not be credible</a>.</p>
<p>But time went by, and Barry O. &#8220;yielded,&#8221; adding an explicit provision that &#8220;buy American&#8221; would <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2009/02/the-senate-and-buy-america.html">follow current trade agreements</a>—which the more aware economists later noted was basically an indication that <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2009/02/ah-the-weaker-version-of-buy-america-is-not-quite-toothless-after-all.html">we will support &#8220;free trade&#8221; only if the other guy does</a>. (Sorry, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.csmonitor.com/2009/0102/p06s02-woap.html">China</a>.)</p>
<p>So now is the time for credit-taking.  And while <a href="http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/article/582767">the usual suspects</a> want to be credited, the reality of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.progressive-economics.ca/2009/02/05/who-saved-canadian-steel/">what they asked for and what they received</a> belies that claim.</p>
<p>Who came to the support of &#8220;free trade for free traders&#8221;?  Why, <a href="http://news.sympatico.msn.cbc.ca/World/ContentPosting?newsitemid=17821019&#038;feedname=CP-WORLD&#038;show=False&#038;number=0&#038;showbyline=True&#038;subtitle=&#038;detect=&#038;abc=abc&#038;date=True">the United Steelworkers Union, of course</a>:<br />
<blockquote>The news came only hours after the United Steelworkers pleaded Canada&#8217;s case to lawmakers from steel-producing states.</p>
<p>A written submission to the congressional steel committee from the Steelworkers&#8217; president, Canadian Leo Gerard, asked that legislators exempt Canada from the provision.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because we are an international union, and because Canadian and U.S. manufacturing is so integrated, we encourage you and other members of the steel caucus to approach your counterparts in Canada to discuss a co-ordinated approach,&#8221; Gerard&#8217;s submission read&#8230;.</p>
<p>The Steelworkers have said it&#8217;s Chinese steel, not Canadian, that&#8217;s the intended target of &#8220;Buy American.&#8221; American steel-makers have long accused China of employing unjust policies that give its steel manufacturers a competitive advantage.</p></blockquote>
<p>Anyone wonder <a target="_blank" href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/02/steel-made-in-america-or-made-in-china.html">why they might believe that</a>?</p>
<p>And, needless to say, <a target="_blank" href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/01/op-ed-misplaced-handwringing-on.html">EconomistMom&#8217;s organization</a> is right in the middle of the fooforaw:<br />
<blockquote>The steel company executives who showed up for Wednesday&#8217;s caucus hearing were skeptical of the &#8220;Buy American&#8221; warnings.</p>
<p>Dan DiMicco, chief executive of Nucor Corp., dismissed as &#8220;garbage&#8221; a recent study by the Peterson Institute for International Economics that &#8220;Buy American&#8221; could cost, not save, thousands of U.S. jobs.</p>
<p>&#8220;The American people are with us and with you on this issue,&#8221; he told the steel caucus members.</p></blockquote>
<p>And they&#8217;re right.  The American people support free trade—with countries that allow us free trade.</p>
<p>It seems that only some economists cannot tell the difference.</p>

                                <p>by divorced one like Bush<br />caution, a long read</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been reading: Making Government Work by Ernest F. “Fritz” Hollings.  Yes, that Hollings of Gramm and Rudman legislation fame.  It is kind of rambling read, but I now understand why our congress of the democratic party side has been acting like moderate republicans and not liberal or progressive.  I recommend it just as a bit of a fly on the wall experience, be it a southern conservative Democratic fly.  He does not like unions.  He does not like free trade as currently practiced.  </p>
<p>And, as much as he hates unions, he can not see that his fight against GATT and NAFTA in support of the textile industry as jobs moved south and over seas is and was the large version of his attracting jobs from the north east because of the cheap, non-union labor.  He understands the impetus of cheap labor found in Mexico and China for business as a problem of “free trade” for our country as currently practiced, but totally fails to see it in his anti-union position.  He can see the “fight” between nations for capital in flows due to labor cost advantages and how that is harmful to higher developed nations, but Hollings never indicates an understanding that he helped create the game of pitting one area of people against another by bidding down labor when he promoted the south as a union free area.  That is, he sold his state, and thus sold out the northeast and the north midwest auto/rust belt social progress by bidding a lower labor cost.  He fails to see his south played and still plays the roll of China to the unionized areas of America.</p>
<p>I mention this as an introduction to a person mentioned in the book who gave testimony in front of his senate committee hearings on GATT and NAFTA 11/15/94: Sir James Goldsmith.  I present him and this bit of history as a compliment to Stormy&#8217;s postings on trade and the related postings regarding ours and the worlds current economic condition.  Senator Hollings listened, but he did not hear.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Goldsmith">Sir Goldsmith</a> you can imagine, is no small potatoes.  Nor is his background of the character one would expect as to be not so much in favor of GATT and NAFTA.  Consider:<br />
<blockquote>Anglo-French billionare financier<br />The Goldschmidts (family name changed to Goldsmith), like their neighbors and relatives the Rothschilds, had been prosperous merchant bankers in Frankfurt since the 16th century.   <br />He was a greenmail corporate raider and asset stripper. (Including US timber companies.)<br />In 1990, Goldsmith also began a lower-profile, but also profitable, global &#8220;private equity style&#8221; investment operation. By 1994 executives working in his employ in Hong Kong had built a substantial position in the intermediation of global strategic raw-material flows.<br />Goldsmith&#8230; believed Britain had been victim of a socialist conspiracy and that communists had infiltrated the Labour party and the media.</p></blockquote>
<p>So, what are you thinking?  Money and more money, of the world market&#8230;total conservative.  Certainly eccentric, if not a little paranoid regarding the communist bogyman.  Except, he wrote a book in 1993: <a href="http://buzzflash.com/hartmann/05/10/har05010.html">The Trap</a>.<br />From the intro:<br />
<blockquote>We have convinced ourselves that there exists only one valid economic and social model: our own. By attempting to impose it universally, we have exported to almost every corner of the world our diseases: crime, drugs, alcoholism, family breakdown, civil disorder in urban slums, accelerated abuse of the environment and all the other problems that we experience daily.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>But, this is the money quote:<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;The economy is a tool to serve us. It is not a demi-god to be served by society.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>So, with no further ado, I present the Ross Perot of Europe in the epic battle of free trade, <a href="http://www.alanwattsentientsentinel.eu/english/transcripts/Alan_Watt_Blurb_Sir_James_Goldsmith_US_Senate_Speech_Oct192007.html">Sir James Goldsmith</a>: (the audio of the transcript is at the same site)<br />
<blockquote>I believe in free markets, I believe in free enterprise and I believe the purpose of the economy is not just to improve indices but to improve the state of the nation&#8211;yours, mine. So I&#8217;m not an anti-free-market man nor an anti-free-enterprise man; quite the contrary.<br />[regarding a prior witness] What you&#8217;ve heard today is the view from big business, of which I was part. <strong>And I believe the view from society in general is totally different.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Let&#8217;s pause right here and let that statement sink in.  Society has a different view of the effects of “free trade” as practiced.<br />
<blockquote>That&#8217;s nothing to do with productivity, Mr. Chairman; that&#8217;s moving to get the cheap labour forty times cheaper. And please don&#8217;t think this is unskilled jobs; these are skilled jobs; these are high-tech jobs going there. Of course there are also the unskilled jobs, but the skilled ones are going to highly skilled people and they are moving offshore; and if you think that&#8217;s productivity, then I think you would be wrong.</p>
<p>Well, surely the measure of competitiveness is the balance of trade. And as you, Senator, pointed out, if you have the second worst balance of trade in history, 150 billion dollars, that&#8217;s not being competitive in world markets.</p>
<p>In his [prior witness] testimony he talks about 500 billion dollars to be invested in China. And then what does he say? He says what America needs&#8211;and no doubt this is true about Europe as well&#8211;is an increased rate of savings. What for? To invest in China?&#8230;we can&#8217;t increase our rates of savings just to invest them elsewhere and where we bleed to death in terms of capital and we bleed to death in terms of jobs. </p>
<p>And this is the big point, Mr. Chairman. <strong>What we are witnessing is the divorce of the interests of the major corporations and the interests of society as a whole.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Ok, time out.  I just want to make a plug for my coined bit of nomenclature: United Corporations of Global.  It&#8217;s an entirely new nation that has no grounding to any boundaries of the continents and thus no patriotism to any nation.  Let&#8217;s all chant: UCG, UCG, UCG, UCG&#8230;</p>
<p>Sir James Goldsmith goes on in his opening to present some figures showing the decline to society&#8217;s non-GDP measures since free trade has come on the scene.  So we&#8217;ll skip to the closer quote:<br />
<blockquote>Now I&#8217;m not here as a bleeding heart liberal; I&#8217;m a hard-headed realist and it is my view that <strong>if we try and make profits and at the same time destroy our nations, no one will benefit from it&#8211;even those who make the profits</strong>. <em>(can you say &#8220;2008&#8221;?)</em> </p></blockquote>
<p>Returning to the beginning of this post regarding Senator Hollings lack of connection to his own approach to saving the south, I present this comment made during Sir Goldsmiths testimony:<br />
<blockquote>&#8230;These thinkers were telling us&#8211;in fact I was at [Renaissance] with President Clinton when Michael [Porter] from Harvard was there and he was still lecturing on the comparative advantage, David [Richardo], and I just looked and said, yeah, the comparative advantage, that&#8217;s why BMW&#8217;s come to South Carolina. We have never made an automobile in our history. <strong>I mean, come on, it&#8217;s the wage advantage; 30 dollars in Munich, 15 dollars in Spartanburg</strong>;</p></blockquote>
<p>And that, ladies and gentleman, is the display of the disconnect of our thinkers in Washington concerning all issues.  The disconnect is the segmentation of thought regarding the mechanisms of relationships when forming a position on an issue.  Senator Hollings just laid right out there his selfish thought process.  Now, I don&#8217;t mean this in a derogatory way.  Read his book, you will see he always held in desire what is best for the people.  Unfortunately, the set called “the people” changes with the focus of the argument.  The mechanics of the issue is never seen as being the same at a scale unrelated to the scale of the current set of “the people”.  His desire to help his south (small set of “the people”) made him unable to recognize in his approach to improving the economy of the south, the same mechanical principles he was arguing to prevent in the hearings regarding GATT and NAFTA.  That is the selfishness unrealized by him.  He is anti-union still today.  </p>
<p>Returning to Sir Goldsmith&#8217;s testimony, these are relative to today:<br />
<blockquote>The reason why this time there&#8217;s been a recovery in indices and GNP despite very substantial pressure, downward pressure, on interest rates and facilitating credit through the banking system is because salaries, earnings, have either gone down or risen very little relative to the period of recovery. And that is the whole philosophy, is we can keep inflation down by keeping wages down; <strong>and we have forgotten the purpose of the economy, which is to enrich, to create a stable society, and to include the population, the vast number of people in active life;</strong> and instead we believe that if we can reduce salaries we can keep inflation down. That&#8217;s the wrong way around; we just forgotten what the economy is about, what its purpose is.  <em>(Can you say last 8 years?  Really, though it has been the last 28 years regarding interest rate decline, wage decline, inflation moderation with rising GDP.)</em><br />The alternatives are not just closing the market, becoming protectionist; the alternatives are not saying we are now going into protection and we&#8217;re going to isolate ourselves from the world, each one of them. The alternative is to have regional trading blocs which have similar economies so we&#8217;re not trying to make our labour forces compete with people whose labour costs 2 percent of theirs and thereby destroying them&#8211;but&#8211;and reducing their salaries and eliminating their jobs&#8211;but having negotiated bilateral agreements between trading blocs so that each region, each nation, imports those products that it needs, not those products that destroy its jobs.</p>
<p>Senator, when I was young I was taught, as we all were, that if we managed to create extraordinary material prosperity we would solve our problems. And we were brought up in the belief that there was an inevitability of progress: progress of wealth, progress of stability, progress of civilization. Well during the last fifty years, since I&#8217;ve been more or less an adult, we&#8217;ve had the greatest period of economic prosperity, economic growth in history. We have succeeded beyond our wildest dreams&#8230;And what has happened? Have we solved our problems? Are our towns more stable? Are our families more stable? Is there less crime, less people in prisons? Less people in&#8211;are there more people in permanent and noble employment? What have we done? We have profoundly destabilized our communities. <strong>We have done everything that was wrong in social terms;</strong> we&#8217;ve deracinated, we&#8217;ve uprooted people from the countrysides, we&#8217;ve shoved them into towns, we haven&#8217;t given them jobs; we&#8217;ve created ghettoes and underclasses; we&#8217;ve increased crime and drug addiction and family break-down&#8211;all this in a period of maximum prosperity. Why? Because we were only interested in economic indices. <strong>We forgot that the purpose of the economy is not just to improve the index; it is to improve prosperity along with social stability and social contentment.</strong> And GATT is typical of the economic instrument, whose purpose is to increase corporate profits; whose purpose is to increase gross national activity; and whose result will be the destruction of the stability of our society, a continued break-down in family life, a continued increase in crime, impoverishment and all the other ills that we are now suffering.</p></blockquote>
<p>Read that last part again: <em>&#8230;whose purpose is to increase gross national activity; and whose result will be the destruction of the stability of our society, a continued break-down in family life, a continued increase in crime, impoverishment and all the other ills that we are now suffering.</em></p>
<p>I think Sir Goldsmith was thinking in linear terms as to the increasing negative effects of the form of free trade being set up.  I don&#8217;t think he imagined the deregulation that would give a false sense of reinforcement to the “free trade” weakening of the foundation.  That business was able to shore up the crumbling base via debt against the social decline, just means, as we are now experiencing, that the crumbling of the pyramid will be of a greater energy.  That is assuming we can not shore up the breaking of the foundation such that it is a controlled falling of the pyramid.  Though, if we are lucky (fingers crossed, salt over shoulder) we may just engineer a solid repair of the base before it all falls down.</p>
<p>Can we broaden the discussion now?<br />Thank you.</p>

<p>Not Veteran&#8217;s Day, which is a U.S. construction to make certain we don&#8217;t have to give another Federal holiday to Those Who Served.  And arguably not Remembrance Day, the version here in Canada, since (<a href="http://lefarkins.blogspot.com/2008/11/armistice-day.html">as Rob[ert] Farley notes</a>) there are &#8220;only&#8221; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surviving_veterans_of_World_War_I">ten known survivors remaining</a> of The War to End All Wars, which ended ninety (90) years ago today. (Ten is pretty good, if you think about it; the youngest two are 107.)</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s talk, in broad terms, about why it was not The War to End All Wars, why remembrance of mustard gas and Verdun and the Somme didn&#8217;t cause everyone to realize we never wanted to do it again, at any price.</p>
<p>As I said, we&#8217;re using wide brush strokes here, and this is an economics blog.  SO let&#8217;s talk about the Treaty of Versailles.</p>
<p>The U.S. was in the War to End All Wars for just over 18 months (6 April 1917 &#8211; 11 November 1918). For the time running up to the declaration of war, they sold equipment to both sides. Not necessarily equally, and maybe at a reduced pace to the German side after <a href="http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/snpwwi2.htm">7 May 1915</a>, but there was commerce going on. (Same story in World War II, as followers of <a href="http://reformed-theology.org/html/books/wall_street/chapter_06.htm">Henry Ford&#8217;s career</a> know all too well.)</p>
<p>France, by contrast, <a href="http://www.creators.com/opinion/molly-ivins/molly-ivins-february-18.html">lost 1,400,000 soldiers in that war</a>.  There is a generation taken from the country, and a country to rebuild without those on whose backs such building usually occurs.</p>
<p>Can anyone wonder that France wanted the Germans penalized to the extent that they would not be able to support an armed force again?  There would be no one to fight.*</p>
<p>And yet all one ever hears is the John Maynard Keyneses and Bernard Baruchs decrying the terms of the Treaty—how they were unfair <em>to Germany</em>.</p>
<p>And the subsequent talk has all been about how Keynes and Baruch and the others were correct, and it was a mean, evil thing to make poor Germany suffer after they destroyed the breeding-age male population (and then some) of another country.  From that perspective, it is difficult to imagine a different Treaty being agreed, since anything less penurious would make France worse off, and therefore not be even weakly Pareto-optimal.</p>
<p>Which is where we turn this into an economics post.</p>
<p>Because there is a way to improve the solution:  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compensating_variation">Compensating Variation</a>. Everyone&#8217;s lot is improved by some reallocations.  And while Hicks does the mathematics in 1939, it isn&#8217;t as if such a general pattern cannot be seen on the schoolyards of Flanders and Eton.</p>
<p>In this case, the United States was the clear winner of the War to End All Wars.  THe British did not suffer so much as the French.  And in both cases, prominent public officials (Baruch from the United States, Keynes from Britain) spoke out about the Treaty, forcing one to the suspicion*** that leaders in both countries suspected from the start that the terms were penurious, and would lead to resentment among the German people.</p>
<p>Which brings us to Compensating Variation. Why would not the U.S. and the U.K. (such as it were) not be offering aid to France, in exchange for terms in the Treaty of Versailles that would lessen the likelihood that <a href="http://www.vac-acc.gc.ca/remembers/sub.cfm?source=history/firstwar/vimy/vimy1a">Flanders Field</a> would again be invoked?</p>
<p>The next time someone tells you that all will be well when a Treaty is executed, because all we need is that some of the winners offer compensating variation to the losers, ask them why Armistice Day now must honor not only its own dead, but also the dead of the wars that followed The War to End All Wars.</p>
<p>*And, indeed, the demographics corroborate this. In 1940, the total population of France is 42 million people.  The population of Germany and Austria is 78 million. 1.86 to 1. More significantly, the Armed Forces of the respective countries stand at 4.6 and 17.9 million: 3.9 to 1.</p>
<p>The result is inevitable:  the French have more civilian casualties (470K) than the U.S. does military ones (405K).**</p>
<p>**Canada, by the way, loses 3.57% of its military force in World War II: more by percentage than France, the U.S., Australia, or the Netherlands.</p>
<p>***I said I&#8217;m talking broad strokes here, but the 1919 publication of <em><a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/15776">The Economic Consequences of the Peace</a></em> and the necessity of publishing <em><a href="http://www.questia.com/read/1468872?title=The%20Making%20of%20the%20Reparation%20and%20Economic%20Sections%20of%20the%20Treaty">The Making of the Reparation and Economic Sections of the Treaty</a></em> in 1920 makes it clear that the arguments over the harshness of the treaty were contemporaneous. (Baruch, in fairness, was one of the negotiators of the Treaty, and only later became discouraged as he saw both how the results were handled, and how Ford maligned and slimed him while profiteering.</p>

                                <p>The WSJ wants to pretend that Barack Obama is responsible for <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122445840565148489.html?mod=djemEditorialPage">Canada making a good decision</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Prime Minister Stephen Harper and President Nicolas Sarkozy of France signed an agreement Friday to begin negotiations for a free trade pact between Canada and the European Union. A Canada-EU study released last week outlines the joint economic benefits of such a partnership, with two-way trade estimated to increase 22.9% by 2014.</p></blockquote>
<p>I guess the WSJ is more impressed with Barry O&#8217;s G-D-like powers than I am.  Or maybe they <a href="http://www40.statcan.ca/l01/cst01/gblec02a.htm">just can&#8217;t read data</a>:</p>
<p>Exports to the United States:<br />2002  347,051.8<br />2003  328,983.3<br />2004  350,576.3<br />2005  368,414.7<br />2006  361,440.4<br />2007  356,094.2</p>
<p>Imports from the United States:<br />2002    255,232.5<br />2003  240,356.3<br />2004  250,038.3<br />2005  259,348.2<br />2006  265,023.0<br />2007  269,752.5</p>
<p>Imports steadily rising, exports falling for the last three years (and basically flat to 2004), with 2008 probably not being great and 2009-2010 already looking dicey.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a great move for Canada, but any delusion that it is Obama-, not data-driven should be confined to the WSJ editorial page.</p>
