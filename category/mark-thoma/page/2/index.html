<p></p>
<blockquote><p>What it says to me is all that matters is Obama&#8217;s reelection (see, for example, the pivot to deficit reduction) &#8212; when the timing&#8217;s right for that, things will happen &#8212; but don&#8217;t keep your fingers crossed otherwise. If you are unemployed and struggling, the president will try to help if it also helps him get reelected, but helping because it&#8217;s the right thing to do? Not likely.</p></blockquote>

<p>The late, not-quite-great Kenneth Koch—from whom Barry may well have taken a class—may be rolling over in his grave, having discovered that <a href="http://books.google.com/books/about/A_Change_of_Hearts.html?id=IRQxAAAAIAAJ">his 1960 play about Richard Nixon, &#8220;The Election,&#8221;</a> has become all the more relevant about the sitting Democratic President.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The idea that the unemployment problem is due to lack of effort on behalf of the unemployed rather than a lack of demand is convenient for the moralists, but inconsistent with the facts. The problem is lack of demand, not the means through which we smooth the negative consequences of recessions.</p>
<p>But what really irks me is the implicit moralizing, the idea that people deserve to be thrown into poverty. Someone who gets up every day and goes to a job day after day, often a job they don&#8217;t like very much, to support their families can suddenly become unemployed in a recession through no fault of their own. They did nothing wrong &#8212; it&#8217;s not their fault the economy went into a recession and they certainly couldn&#8217;t be expected to foresee a recession that experts such as Casey Mulligan missed entirely. <a name="more"></a> They had no reason to believe they had chosen the wrong place to go to work, but unemployment hit them anyway. And since one of the biggest causes of foreclosure is an event like unemployment, it&#8217;s entirely possible that this household would lose its home, be forced to declare bankruptcy, etc., and end up in severe poverty if there were no social services to rely upon.</p>
<p>What moral lesson is being taught here? <!-- more --&gt  Why does this household deserve to be punished for their bad decisions? It did nothing wrong. I understand that people should suffer the consequences of their own bad choices, but that's not what happens in recessions. People who have done nothing to deserve it are nevertheless hit by severe negative shocks. That's what social insurance is for, to smooth the path for such unfortunate households, to avoid sending people into poverty who have done nothing to deserve it (see "<a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2005/04/_the_need_for_s.html">The Need for Social Insurance</a>"). It is not an attempt to reward bad behavior and most programs do their best to avoid giving benefits to people who have made bad choices (for example, the system is far from perfect but in most states unemployment insurance can only be obtained if you lose your job through no fault of your, e.g. if you quit or get yourself fired it is not available). The extent to which we should distinguish between deserving and undeserving households for social insurance programs is debatable and depends upon the type of program, but the idea that all households are undeserving is, in my view, simply wrong. I would apply the social safety net widely myself -- I think the benefit of the doubt should go to compassion, not harshness and moralizing -- but in any case I'd dispute the idea that "safety-net generosity" is too high. If anything, we are not generous enough.</p>

<p>This is from Jialan Wang:</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://econerdfood.blogspot.com/2011/10/benfords-law-and-decreasing-reliability.html">Benford&#8217;s Law and the Decreasing Reliability of Accounting Data for US Firms, by Jialan Wang</a>: &#8230;[T]here are more numbers in the universe that begin with the digit 1 than 2, or 3, or 4, or 5, or 6, or 7, or 8, or 9. And more numbers that begin with 2 than 3, or 4, and so on. This relationship holds for the lengths of rivers, the populations of cities, molecular weights of chemicals, and any number of other categories. &#8230;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>This numerical regularity is known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benford%27s_law">Benford&#8217;s Law</a>, and specifically, it says that the probability of the first digit from a set of numbers is <em>d</em> is given by</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>In fact, Benford&#8217;s law has been used in legal cases to detect corporate fraud, because deviations from the law can indicate that a company&#8217;s books have been manipulated. Naturally, I was keen to see whether it applies to the large public firms that we commonly study in finance.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>downloaded quarterly accounting data for all firms in Compustat,&#8230; over 20,000 firms from SEC filings&#8230; (revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities, etc.).</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>And lo, it works! Here are the distribution of first digits vs. Benford&#8217;s law&#8217;s prediction for total assets&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-HT-hDx8Pkh0/TpJvSFIi6sI/AAAAAAAAAzw/Dmi8-wktQMQ/s1600/atq_dist.jpg"><img border="0" alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-HT-hDx8Pkh0/TpJvSFIi6sI/AAAAAAAAAzw/Dmi8-wktQMQ/s320/atq_dist.jpg" width="320" height="232"></a></p>
<blockquote><p>Next, I looked at how adherence to Benford&#8217;s law changed over time, using a measure of the sum of squared deviations of the empirical density from the Benford&#8217;s prediction&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Deviations from Benford&#8217;s law have increased substantially over time, such that today the empirical distribution of each digit is about 3 percentage points off from what Benford&#8217;s law would predict. The deviation increased sharply between 1982-1986 before leveling off, then zoomed up again from 1998 to 2002.  Notably, the deviation from Benford dropped off very slightly in 2003-2004 after the enactment of Sarbanes-Oxley accounting reform act in 2002, but this was very tiny and the deviation resumed its increase up to an all-time peak in 2009.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-tl4Xwb1yWgY/TpJvRYB2YKI/AAAAAAAAAzo/JzfregzopWA/s1600/benf_year.jpg"><img border="0" alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-tl4Xwb1yWgY/TpJvRYB2YKI/AAAAAAAAAzo/JzfregzopWA/s400/benf_year.jpg" width="400" height="290"></a></p>
<blockquote><p>So according to Benford&#8217;s law, accounting statements are getting less and less representative of what&#8217;s really going on inside of companies.The major reform that was passed after Enron and other major accounting standards barely made a dent.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Next, I looked at Benford&#8217;s law for three industries: finance, information technology, and manufacturing. &#8230; [<a href="http://econerdfood.blogspot.com/2011/10/benfords-law-and-decreasing-reliability.html">shows graphs</a>] &#8230; While these time series don&#8217;t prove anything decisively, deviations from Benford&#8217;s law are compellingly correlated with known financial crises, bubbles, and fraud waves. And overall, the picture looks grim. Accounting data seem to be less and less related to the natural data-generating process that governs everything from rivers to molecules to cities. Since these data form the basis of most of our research in finance, Benford&#8217;s law casts serious doubt on the reliability of our results. And it&#8217;s just one more reason for investors to beware&#8230;.</p></blockquote>

<p><center><strong>Ask the Experts: What&#8217;s Next for the Economy?</strong></center></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a big week for the American economy. President Obama announced his plans to reduce the deficit on Monday, and Wednesday afternoon the Federal Reserve announces its new plan to boost growth. Do these proposals make sense? And what do they really mean for your money?</p>
<p>MoneyWatch editors Jill Schlesinger and Jack Otter will discuss in this week&#8217;s live &#8220;Ask the Experts&#8221; webcast. They will be joined by economist and MoneyWatch blogger Mark Thoma. <br />• Where should you be investing now?<br />• Will any jobs be created this year?<br />• Where can you find a job now?<br />• Has the housing market finally hit bottom?<br />• What will it really take to restart the American economy?</p>

<blockquote>1. You have to make the Republicans pay in terms of eroded public support before they will agree to cooperate at all. <strong>The president in particular has not played a long-run strategy, the Republicans have, and the results reflect this.</strong><br />2. &#8220;Let’s agree that what matters isn&#8217;t how many jobs you &#8216;get caught trying&#8217; to create.&#8221; <em>Why should I agree to take as given the point being debated here?</em> When we need jobs as bad as we do right now, <strong>making it clear the other side is standing in the way of that goal</strong>, and fighting for the policies you&#8217;d like to enact has more value than it did in the past. </p>
<p>3. To me, this is about leaders and followers, and <em>the administration is not the one leading policy right now</em>.</p>
<p>4. The other side is not shy about going public, and that was also true when they controlled the White House. If this advice is correct, why didn&#8217;t it hurt Republicans when they were in power?</p>
<p>5. Yes, jobs at election time would be best. But if the other side is pushing policies that work against that goal so that it is unlikely to be attained&#8230;making that clear to the public would hurt. [slightly edited; emphases mine]</p></blockquote>
<p>As Yves said, can <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/post/obama-needs-to-create-jobs-not-fight-for-them/2011/05/19/AGvSUaqH_blog.html">Ezra Klein</a> should <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2011/06/ezra-klein-should-stick-to-being-wrong-about-health-care.html">stick to being (slightly less but still) wrong about health care</a>?</p>
<p>At this point, the list of Obama Administration Unforced Errors—Summers, Geithner, John Walsh, lack of nominations, etc.; see <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=Obama+Administration+Unforced+Error+site%3Adelong.typepad.com&#038;hl=en&#038;rls=com.microsoft%3A*&#038;num=10&#038;lr=&#038;ft=i&#038;cr=&#038;safe=images&#038;tbs=">here</a>—is so long I would be willing to swear they put a <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/buttonwood/2010/06/inflation_deflation_and_asset_allocation">one-armed man</a> on the tennis court.</p>
<p>UPDATE: Contrast the Obama Administration statements (and lack of same) with today&#8217;s Press Release from <a href="http://www.cgiamerica.org/">CGI America</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Today, President Bill Clinton opened CGI America, hosting a plenary session on job creation and announcing new programs that will help foster economic growth in the U.S.</p>
<p>Speaking to more than 700 leaders from businesses, nonprofits, and government at the opening session, President Clinton announced three “Commitments to Action” that will be implemented by CGI America participants. These commitments, presented by Kiva, Visa, Onshore Technology Services, and the AFL-CIO, will expand access to microfinance, train workers, and fund infrastructure development.</p>
<p>“When these commitments are fully funded and implemented, 140,000 people will receive access to job training, 1,000 information technology jobs will be created in rural America, and $3.5 million will be loaned to small businesses in the U.S.,” President Clinton said. “Initiatives like these prove that organizations and individuals around the country have the power to take action to spur economic growth.”  </p>
<p>CGI America is the first Clinton Global Initiative (CGI) meeting focused exclusively on the U.S. The purpose of the event is to develop new ideas for spurring economic growth and to highlight existing programs that can be replicated and scaled.</p></blockquote>
<p>Can&#8217;t anyone in the current Administration—<a href="http://press.clintonglobalinitiative.org/news_highlights_cgiamerica/secretary-geithner-cgi-america/">Tim Geithner is attending CGI America</a>—understand that Bully Pulpits are Meant to Be Used?  The last Democratic Administration did.</p>
<p>*I should be fair to Bernstein, but he perpetuates the horse droppings about &#8220;people want to see spending cuts and see them they will.&#8221; The unemployed innumerate vote, sometimes, and they&#8217;re not going to cheerfully vote for someone who keeps them unemployed by doing what they said they want. That&#8217;s not leadership, as David Frum (whose ex-boss knew even less about leadership than BarryO does) <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2011/06/david-frum-obama-is-his-own-worst-enemy.html">noted</a>.**</p>
<p>**Frum&#8217;s claim that Obama is not imaginative enough is clearly bollocks, and his toughness (as distinct from his determination) should be unquestionable too. But &#8220;not determined enough&#8221; has rung true since his Senate days, and the bad Gerald Ford imitation is wearing thin even with those who were originally nostalgic.</p>

<p>So this it is almost palliative that Barry Ritholtz <a href="http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/2011/06/fed-forecasts-puh-leeze/">writes the Quote of the Day, or perhaps the Decade</a>:<br />
<blockquote>The sooner we recognize that the field of economics is a branch of Sociology and not Mathematics, the better off we will all be.</p></blockquote>
<p>Anyone who has looked at the CF that Microeconomic doctrine has created over the past twenty years will not be surprised by Ritholtz&#8217;s conclusion. The question would almost be why he waited so long to say so explicitly.</p>
<p>Other signs that people are coming around to the positions taken at this blog:
<ol>
<li>The gracious, even-tempered Mark Thoma <a href="http://moneywatch.bnet.com/economic-news/blog/maximum-utility/the-feds-monetary-policy-meeting-policy-stays-on-hold/1455/">has been driven to pointing out that the math, let alone the social issues, don&#8217;t work</a>:<br />
<blockquote>I had hoped to see more acknowledgement that the current soft patch may turn out to be something more significant than a temporary aberration in the numbers, and some hint of willingness to ease further should those worries come true. But the Fed shows no such willingness, in fact as Neil Irwin <a href="https://twitter.com/#%21/Neil_Irwin/status/83580739416883200">notes</a>, the “employ its policy tools as necessary to support the economic recovery” language is gone, and the main question at this point is when the Fed might begin tightening policy by reversing QE1 and QE2 rather than when they might ease further.</p></blockquote>
<p></li>
<li>Brad DeLong <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2011/06/diane-lim-rogers-confuses-republican-economists-with-ex-repubican-economists.html">channels Bruce Webb or me in talking about Diane Lim Rogers</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Get out of the defensive crouch, Diane. If you and your peers won&#8217;t stand up and say that every single Republican presidential candidate is talking hogwash and that every economist who wants high federal office in the next Republican administration is acting like a craven coward, then you are giving them every incentive to do so.</p></blockquote>
<p></li>
<li>The NYT—Gretchen Morgenson, of all people—<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/19/business/19gret.html?_r=1">notices that Executive Pay is not aligned with optimal company management, let alone shareholders</a>:<br />
<blockquote>WHEN does big become excessive? If the question involves executive pay, the answer is “often.” &#8230;just how this paycheck stacks up against, say, a company’s earnings or stock market performance is rarely laid out.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>Mark Thoma is a truly stand-up guy. We need more like him screaming for the unemployed and underemployed. I&#8217;ll comment just a bit more after Mark&#8217;s commentary.</p>
<p>Mark Thoma on <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2011/02/the-slow-recovery-of-unemployment.html/">The Slow Recovery of Unemployment</a>:<br />
<blockquote>I don&#8217;t like to make economic forecasts. Though I do it on occasion, I generally leave that to <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/timduy/">Tim Duy</a> &#8212; he&#8217;s much more of a data grubber than I am so he&#8217;s better at it anyway. I do try to comment on what data says when it&#8217;s released, mostly at <a href="http://moneywatch.bnet.com/economic-news/blog/maximum-utility/">MoneyWatch</a>, but I don&#8217;t generally consider those to be formal forecasts of where the economy is headed.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a good reason why I try to avoid forecasts. In the past, whenever I&#8217;ve tried to predict the path the economy would take, I&#8217;ve found myself reading subsequent data releases in a way that supports the forecast. I think that once you make a forecast, it affects your objectivity, and I think that applies generally, not just to me.</p>
<p>Perhaps that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m feeling more and more alone in talking about the current state of the economy. Though the worries began long before this, in June of 2008 I did a MarketPlace segment where I predicted that the recovery of unemployment would lag output, and I said that policy should begin addressing the problem immediately due to the long lags between the time when policy begins is first considered and the time it actually has an impact on the economy. Ever since, I&#8217;ve found myself watching to see if that forecast was correct (which is another reason why I don&#8217;t like to make forecasts &#8212; you hope you are correct, but being correct in this case means people will struggle to find jobs, so it brings on an internal contradiction &#8212; how can you hope people will struggle?).</p>
<p>As I said above, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m alone in reading data in a way that supports previous forecasts, and others are much more bullish about the latest data releases than I have been. Part of my point has been that the data can be read another way. When people say, for example, that there&#8217;s nothing in the latest employment report to change the relatively optimistic forecasts they&#8217;ve made recently, I try to say that there&#8217;s nothing in the data to reject the alternative forecast either, i.e. that we are still headed for a very slow recovery of employment. Whatever your null hypothesis or prior beliefs were, the latest data did little to change that outlook.</p>
<p>My reason for noting that the data can be read another way goes beyond trying to show that I was right and others were wrong about how long it would take for employment to recover. I am very worried that we are, for all intents and purposes, about to abandon the millions who are still unemployed. Once we conclude that a robust recovery is underway, we will turn our attention to other things. All of the social services that we need to provide for the unemployed, simple and important things like making it possible for their kids to get dental care to name just one example, will be ignored. We devote little if any effort to job creation. We will simply turn our backs and move on.</p>
<p>I fully understand the desire to have a perfect landing, to get policy just right. But just right when the costs of unemployment are so much higher than the costs of inflation means that we should bias policy toward the unemployment problem. If we are going to make a mistake, it should be too much unemployment, and the inflation that comes with it, rather than too little. However, with the inflation hawks writing almost daily in the WSJ and elsewhere that we need to raise interest rates immediately to avoid inflation, and with all of the pressure to address the budget deficit, if anything the bias in policy seems to be in the other direction. Thus, while I acknowledge the fact that I am probably reading the data in a way that is favorable to previous statements, there was a good reason to worry back in 2008 that this would be a problem, and I believe there&#8217;s still good reason for worrying about it today. If I have read the data more pessimistically than others, the reason for it is simple &#8212; to push against the chance that we will forget about all the households that continue to struggle. If Ben Bernanke&#8217;s right, even with current policy we are looking at years until employment gets back to normal and we must do all that we can to help people find jobs or, failing that, provide the social services they need to get by until the employment picture improves.</p>
<p>Until I am sure that the economy is on firmer footing than it&#8217;s on now, and that employment prospects have improved substantially, I will continue to be the one who pushes back against optimistic reading of the data. And I will make no apologies for it beyond what I&#8217;ve said here.</p></blockquote>
<p>(More comments after the jump)<a name="more"></a><br />RW: Just today I was reading an Economist article from last week&#8217;s publication, <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/18010603">Et in Arcadia ego</a> (even in Arcadia I exist), about the homeless population that is building in the hardest hit parts of the economy (generally related to the manufacturing and housing decline). Tent cities, surging homeless rate, and poverty are becoming more of the &#8216;norm&#8217;; it&#8217;s really rather heart wrenching if you think about it.</p>
<p>And then I see a chart <a href="http://streetlightblog.blogspot.com/2011/02/inflation-expectations-and-asset-prices.html">like this</a> (h/t Ken Houghton at AB) on inflation expectations and asset prices. Yes, propping up asset prices &#8211; that&#8217;s what the Fed&#8217;s done here is inflate asset prices &#8211; will have the intended effect of dropping the saving rate and increasing current consumption; but to what end? Wall Street&#8217;s doing just fine, in fact. I&#8217;m a macroeconomic analyst and portfolio manager in the global fixed income space and have seen a nice shuffling around in the labor force. I wouldn&#8217;t say that jobs are plentiful, but popping up, nevertheless.</p>
<p>On forecasting, I find it very interesting that when Wall Street economists model their outlook for the unemployment rate &#8211; according to Bloomberg, the consensus expects the unemployment rate to drop to 8.5% in 2012 &#8211; they assume that the 2.8 million workers that are marginally attached to the labor force (of which discouraged workers is a subset) will not re-enter. Mathematically, that drops the unemployment rate: compared to a year ago, January 2010, the number of marginally attached workers has increased from 1.07% of the working-aged noninstitutional population to 1.17%, while the U3 unemployment rate dropped 9.7% to 9.0%. (the alternative measures of unemployment are listed in <a href="http://bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf">Table A-15 here.</a>)</p>
<p>I think that run75441 says it well (in the comment section of <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/02/household-survey-likely-paints-better.html">this post</a>):<br />
<blockquote>If NILF [not in the labor force] keeps going up, it does not matter what U3 does which is a joke. Parity for U3 is reached when Participation Rate equals the Participation Rate of 2001. The numeric is to nervous and today&#8217;s measurement of U3 has no meaning.</p></blockquote>
<p>Mark, thank you for your voice. It takes a lot of courage to push back against those that see just the tip of the economic iceberg, i.e. the parts of the economy that are trucking along just fine right now.</p>

                                <p>Update: Brad DeLong looks at the data and suggests that <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2010/12/james-kwak-on-the-obama-renaissance.html">the problem may be that the current President is as innumerate as the previous one</a>.</p>
<p>Mark Thoma <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2010/12/the-obama-renaissance.html">quotes James Kwak</a>:<br />
<blockquote>So no, I don’t think Obama is abandoning his principles for political advantage; I think these are his principles. And while I’m upset at him, I’m upset at him for being wrong on the policy level, not for abandoning anything or selling out&#8230;I always thought Obama was a moderate who looked like a progressive.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m with Kwak on that; it&#8217;s one of the reasons I supported the relatively-more-progressive Hillary through the primaries.*</p>
<p>Where I&#8217;m less sanguine is the base from which Mark let him start:<br />
<blockquote>Obama is certainly in a decent position politically, and I would bet on him to be reelected comfortably in 2012.</p></blockquote>
<p>In 1996, Bill Clinton had the advantage of Bob Dole—the 1996 equivalent of Newt Gingrich—being his opponent.  Dole had been a known quantity to voters for over a decade (&#8220;Do you want Grits and Fritz or a Ford Dole?&#8221;) who supported Clarence Thomas, talked about Hideo Nomo of the Brooklyn Dodgers, and fell off the front of a stage—and still <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1996">garnered more than 40% of the vote, losing the popular vote by only slightly more votes than Ross Perot won</a>.  And that was after the advantage of a virtually-uncontested primary, which Mr. Obama may not enjoy.**</p>
<p>Kwak later backtracks a bit:<br />
<blockquote>I think two years would be enough time for labor markets to recover if we could expect policy supporting employment along the way. But we are likely to get just the opposite, deficit cutting measures and other policies that work against employment and hence work against electoral success for the Democrats. <em>Toss in a compromise on Social Security that angers the Democratic base, a possibility that cannot be dismissed as Obama follows up on what appears to be a successful move to the center, and the future does not look as bright.</em> Obama may think he is playing the game well now, but the game is far from over.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is at least far more accurate than the declaration that Obama won when his opening g4 was followed by the Republican&#8217;s e5.  And Thoma follows up with his expectation of Obama&#8217;s next move being f3:<br />
<blockquote>That would put an end to any stimulus due to the tax compromise. <em>Stimulating the economy was never the intent of the GOP when they agreed to the tax compromise, it was all about the estate tax and tax cuts for the wealthy.</em> They will do what they can to decrease government spending over the next two years, starting in January, and if they are successful it will reverse any benefit the economy might have received from the compromise.</p></blockquote>
<p>Given that we all agree on the likely next two years, it would be nice to see an economic model from either Mark or James Kwak that justifies the expectation that Obama is in a position &#8220;to be reelected comfortably in 2012.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the very least, I want to offer to bet with Mr. Kwak, at even odds, with proceeds to go to the charity of the winner&#8217;s choice. Here&#8217;s <a href="http://www.shelterfromthestorm.ca/">my choice</a>.</p>
<p>*The other being that she would know from the start that she was hated, and be ready for bear at the outset. (As an aside: sorry, <a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/">Scott</a>, but hiring Mark Penn, while a mistake, is not a revelation of policy preferences. Or, if you want to argue it is, tell us what replacing Howard Dean and the 50-State Strategy with Tim Kaine and Suborning Democrats such as Sibelius and Napolitano into the Administration is.)</p>
<p>**I say this not only because I would like to see him challenged—his doing a Specter in 2011 is about the only hope for my grandchildren—but also because it makes sense to prepare the field for 2016 and beyond.  It would be dumber of the Democrats <em>not</em> to have someone challenge him in the primary, leaving only HRC and Joe Biden as probably 2016 candidates, than it would be to unite behind him in the hope that Republicans nominate someone who is unelectable a la Dole in 1996.</p>

<blockquote><p>there is supposed to be a &#8220;rest of the trick,&#8221; but it doesn&#8217;t come until later. The idea is that the labor that is freed up from the increased productivity will be used to produce new goods and services thereby increasing the quantity and variety of the nation&#8217;s output. In a dynamic, growing economy, even though there&#8217;s a delay before the new jobs appear (and hence a need to help workers through the transition), the new jobs are supposed to be even better than the old ones. But as workers look forward, the fear is that that won&#8217;t be the case. Workers who have lost jobs face an uncertain future where, if they can get new jobs at all, they are unlikely to pay as well or have the same level of benefits as the jobs they lost. New workers do not appear to have the same opportunities that their parents had, particularly workers without a college degree.<br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>If workers could be assured that rising productivity would translate into better jobs and higher pay, the outlook would be different. But the last several decades of stagnant wages have undermined that promise. The growth that has occurred was not widely shared &#8212; it did not trickle down as promised &#8212; and the frustrations and uncertainties households have are understandable. It&#8217;s a mistake to think that just because the economy starts growing again, all will be well. If the growth that occurs post-recession simply picks up where pre-recession growth left off, i.e. with income gains flowing mainly to the upper classes, and with even more income inequality than we have now, the frustrations and tensions will continue to build and our troubles will not have ended.</p></blockquote>
