				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>During the discussions about <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/08/interlude-self-indulgent-advt.html">the Fannie Mae project I still regret having turned down</a>, one of the topics was which security would be better for a portfolio (assuming their risk-adjusted prices provided the same value): a four-year-old MBS or a seven-year-old MBS?</p>
<p>I noted that the four-year-old MBS provided more potential upside but came gradually to agree that the seven-year-old security was preferable: an MBS that is that &#8220;seasoned&#8221; is effectively a generic amortizing bond.  There shouldn&#8217;t be any surprises—in either direction—so a portfolio manager would prefer it.</p>
<p>As usual, The Old Firm manges to prove that what <em>should</em> be correct for an MBS <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSWNA817520100819">isn&#8217;t necessarily so for a CMBS</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Standard &#038; Poor&#8217;s Ratings Services today lowered its ratings on<br />three classes of commercial mortgage pass-through certificates from Bear<br />Stearns Commercial Mortgage Securities Trust 2002-TOP6, a U.S. commercial<br />mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) transaction&#8230;.</p>
<p>The downgrade of class M to &#8216;D&#8217; follows a principal loss sustained by the<br />class, which was detailed in the August 2010 remittance report&#8230;.</p>
<p>The principal loss and corresponding credit support erosion resulted from the<br />liquidation of an asset&#8230;.The Nortel Networks asset is a 281,758-sq.-ft. office<br />property in Richardson, Texas. The asset had a total exposure of $28.6<br />million. The asset was transferred to the special servicer in September 2009<br />and became real estate owned (REO) in March 2010. The trust incurred a $12.0<br />million realized loss when the asset was liquidated during the August<br />reporting period&#8230;[T]he loss severity for this asset was 44.2%</p></blockquote>
<p>As <a href="http://www.calculatedriskblog.com/2010/08/jingle-mail-from-hyatt-hotels.html">corporations are increasingly using &#8220;jingle mail</a>,&#8221; the prospect for the future of CMBSes—even those that went through several good years. Or for the concept of an &#8220;ongoing concern,&#8221; or a strong recovery. (That latter concept seems to fade with <a href="http://macromarketmusings.blogspot.com/2010/08/its-happening-aggregate-demand.html">each</a> <a href="http://robertreich.org/post/953941192/forget-a-double-dip-were-still-in-one-long-big">passing</a> <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2010/08/initial-claims-for-unemployment-increase-to-500000.html">day</a>.)</p>
