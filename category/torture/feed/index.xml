				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Meet the New Boss; Same as the Old Boss.</p>
<p>Andrew Sullivan <a target="_blank" href="http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2009/05/they-wont-have-access-and-they-never-will.html">points out the obvious link</a> from yesterday&#8217;s appointment <a target="_blank" href="http://www.esquire.com/features/ESQ0806TERROR_102">to today&#8217;s &#8220;reversal</a>&#8220;:<br />
<blockquote>It was a point of pride that the Red Cross would never be allowed in the door, Jeff says. This is important because it defied the Geneva Conventions, which require that the Red Cross have access to military prisons. &#8220;Once, somebody brought it up with the colonel. &#8216;Will they ever be allowed in here?&#8217; And he said absolutely not. He had this directly from General McChrystal and the Pentagon that there&#8217;s no way that the Red Cross could get in — they won&#8217;t have access and they never will. This facility was completely closed off to anybody investigating, even Army investigators.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>People keep telling me that America is a better place since 20 January 2009.  As with the claims of economic recovery &#8220;right around the corner,&#8221; there is precious little evidence.</p>

<p>I also am a native of the City of Brotherly Love. The last <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/House-Cards-Hubris-Wretched-Excess/dp/0385528264/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&#038;s=books&#038;qid=1242138875&#038;sr=1-1">two</a> <a target="_blank" href="http://www.reuters.com/article/ousiv/idUSTRE51918R20090210">firms</a> at which I have worked have lost billions of dollars.</p>
<p>While I admit that—unlike your <a target="_blank" href="http://www.philly.com/inquirer/opinion/20090315_Security_vs__freedom__A_balance_kept.html">latest</a> <a target="_blank" href="http://www.philly.com/inquirer/opinion/20090510_Obama_needs_a_neutral_justice.html">columnist</a>—I am not responsible for that happening, I believe this qualifies me to write a monthly column for you. While I understand that you must keep the amount you pay for the column secret from the workers who took $25/week pay cuts in an effort to save the paper, I believe that we can quickly agree to an amount in the neighborhood of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.poynter.org/column.asp?id=45&#038;aid=162050">$1,750 you pay Rick Santorum</a>, whose Philadelphia ties are much more suspect than mine.</p>
<p>I will, of course, write columns for you specifying that the current financial system is in perfect order, functioning precisely as it should. This should give my column the same truthiness that Mr. Santorum and your latest columnist bring to your august institution, and &#8220;promote further discourse.&#8221;</p>
<p>You can reach me via this blog.  I look forward to receiving a contract.</p>
<p>Best,</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Who said:<br />
<blockquote>The United States participated actively and effectively in the negotiation of the [1984 UN Convention on Torture] . It marks a significant step in the development during this century of international measures against torture and other inhuman treatment or punishment. Ratification of the Convention by the United States will clearly express United States opposition to torture, an abhorrent practice unfortunately still prevalent in the world today.</p>
<p>The core provisions of the Convention establish a regime for international cooperation in the criminal prosecution of torturers relying on so-called &#8216;universal jurisdiction.&#8217; Each State Party is required either to prosecute torturers who are found in its territory or to extradite them to other countries for prosecution.</p></blockquote>
<p>Answer <a target="_blank" href="http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1079/is_n2137_v88/ai_6742034/">here</a>.  Is he rolling over in his grave?</p>
