                                <p><img alt="" height="300" src="http://raceagainstthemachine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/cover-201x300.jpg" width="201"><br />Eric Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAffee have a new Kindle instant book out, <a href="http://raceagainstthemachine.com/">Race Against the Machine</a>, that very nicely describes the issues related to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relationship_of_automation_to_unemployment">technological unemployment</a>. It’s well-written, content-packed, cogently argued, usefully hyperlinked, and well worth the $3.99 they’re asking.<br />But I think there’s one crucial topic they don’t address, highlighted by the following.<br />They deliver a quotation from Gregory Clark’s 2007 <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Farewell-Alms-Brief-Economic-History/dp/0691121354">Farewell to Alms</a></em>, speaking of the decline in employment of horses in England in the 19th and 20th centuries. The quotation concludes:<br />
<blockquote>There was always a wage at which all of those horses could have remained employed. But that wage was so low that it did not pay for their feed.</p></blockquote>
<p>The question that B&#038;M fail to ask or answer: <em>Why</em> couldn’t those horses continue working for a living wage?<br />Answer: because they couldn’t upgrade their skills (to drive trains and tractors, or whatever). They were biologically incapable of “improving” themselves in such a way that they and the new machines were “complements.” So the machines replaced them instead of complementing them.<br />Imagine that those horses had been free to mate and have offspring at will (as opposed to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-child_policy">PRC-style</a>, top-down population control imposed by breeders). They couldn’t work (nobody would hire them because their marginal productivity relative to machines was so low), so they couldn’t make any economic claim to a share of the (massively increasing) pie of production and prosperity.<br />They would have faced an unequivocally Malthusian situation: large numbers of horses would have starved.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />Now suppose that the population-control option was … not an option. And that <em>laissez faire</em> – letting them just live (and die) with their subsistence or sub-subsistence incomes — was also not an option. The only solution would be to subsidize their lives, transferring money from those who own and profit from the machines to those who <em>can’t</em> benefit economically from using those machines.<br />You know where I’m going. (I’ve taken you there before.) Human capacity has limits. By definition, 50% of people have an IQ below 100. The prescription we so often hear — that those folks should train to operate computer-driven lathes, and to perform in the sophisticated, information-driven organizational structures associated with that kind of equipment — is … less than realistic.<br />Rapidly accelerating machine capabilities <em>can</em> result an economy in which those people’s marginal productivity drops to near zero, or even negative — so no matter how hard they work or train, their contributions aren’t great enough for them to “deserve” a decent share of the pie. (Define “decent” as you will; for me in our wildly prosperous society it extends to a good chunk of leisure/recreation time with friends and family, taking family vacations now and then, such like that. Let’s hear it for “family values.”)<br />If you’re reading this, then like me you probably can’t even imagine what it would be like to have really low intelligence (or other below-average capacities) — how desperately hard it would be to make a go of things, to raise a family and give them a good life, in the country we live in today. Imagine just trying to get through high school.<br />Some people may get unsavory feelings from this thinking, so (to quote BHO), let me be perfectly clear: I’m not saying that less-capable people are horses. <em>Quite the contrary. </em>They’re <em>people</em>. So yes, I’ll say it: at least if they’re willing to work (or are unable to do so), they <em>deserve</em> a decent share of the pie. They shouldn’t be driven to the bottom while the machine owners wallow in luxury, just because the technological economy they happen to have been born into doesn’t value them any more.<br />In wonk-speak: income and purchasing power must be decoupled from human participation in production. Not completely, of course — requiring participation in the work force is necessary to solve the free-rider problem. But in an economy that’s bursting with surplus, we can be better off overall if individual incomes (at least at the low end) are not rigidly associated with individual capabilities.<br />Which brings me back, <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/equality-growth-lane-kenworthy-and-the-earned-income-tax-credit.html">yet again</a> (getting practical here), to a greatly expanded Earned Income Tax Credit — encouraging both work and hiring — with benefit levels indexed to some measure of unemployment. This would require, of course, that we implement a tax system that <a href="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2009/04/13/business/economy/shares.jpg">actually is</a> progressive, to pay for the increased EITC.<br />Imagine a post-scarcity future (or … present?) in which high productivity (think: Star-Trek-style replicators) means there’s plenty for all, with little work required. My utopian image is of something like an Athenian Agora — people of all types gathering in public spaces, meeting their friends, and exchanging their wares and their news — instead of constantly scrambling to make a buck and collapsing in their homes when they’re done.<br />In fact, it looks a whole lot like the zillions of public squares you find throughout Europe — surrounded by residences, and cafés and such where people mingle and spend time with their friends — the kind of environment that pretty much doesn’t exist in America.<br />And I haven’t even touched here on the idea that this redistribution may <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/the-party-of-prosperity-the-seven-reasons-that-democrats-policies-are-more-economically-efficient.html">be economically efficient</a>, even <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/why-prosperity-requires-a-welfare-state.html">necessary</a>, to maintain aggregate demand and support productive enterprises, keeping the log that is our economy, rolling.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>I think (after a lot of effort) that I’ve internalized Nick Rowe’s modeling of this question (follow links from <a href="http://worthwhile.typepad.com/worthwhile_canadian_initi/2012/01/robert-waldmann-and-others-on-dean-baker-and-hence-paul-krugman-and-the-burden-of-the-debt.html">here</a>) pretty well conceptually.  His answer is Yes.
<p>There have been thousands of posts and comments across the blogosphere since Nick took Krugman to task on the issue a couple of weeks ago, and Nick has been remarkably generous with his time in helping people understand his thinking. (A kudos also to Bob Murphy.) And it’s worth pointing out that Krugman hasn’t really responded to the core argument head-on. Feel free to follow the threads.</p>
<p>Here’s Nick’s model in brief, in my words:</p>
<p>Government borrowing/bond issuance today — considering only its costs, not the potential up/downsides of the associated spending — propagates incentives into the future, like waves are propagated when you throw a rock in a pool. Those incentives cause the old people in every period to consume more than the young people. In each future period, parents will eat some of their kids’ lunch.</p>
<p>Each <em>generation</em> consumes the same amount as they would have otherwise (because first you’re young, then you’re old, first you’re a child, then you’re a parent). But if government eventually has to tax to pay back the debt, the young people in that period are forced to consume less over their lifetimes, because they <em>don’t</em> get to eat their kids’ lunch.</p>
<p>(Nick acknowledges the point that Jamie Galbraith and others have been <a href="http://www.levyinstitute.org/publications/?docid=1379">making</a> for years: if the future GDP growth rate is higher than the interest rate, on average, the taxation never needs to happen, so the burden is never imposed.)</p>
<p>Here’s why I haven’t updated my priors much based on this thinking:</p>
<p>1. The wave model of propagated old/young bond-buying/spending patterns, extending to eternity, doesn’t seem plausible to me intuitively. It seems like the rock-in-the-pool ripples would probably flatten as they spread through time — maybe (?), as discussed in various posts and comment threads, because over the generations a certain percentage of parents bequeath their bonds to their children. That leaves us with “we’ll have to tax to pay for it eventually, so <em>somebody</em> will have to consume less,” which is pretty much where we started.</p>
<p>2. I wonder whether a real agent-based dynamic simulation modeling of Nick’s scenario, with continuous time and using differential equations, would give the same results. I’m not enough of a mathie to even guess, but I wouldn’t be surprised to see very different patterns and/or results.</p>
<p>3. The huge majority of government bonds are bought and traded not by people but by institutions (many of which — this seems significant — are licensed to create credit money and associated debt ex nihilo, and use government bonds as debt collateral in that process). Those institutions don’t have generations — birth/death, parents/children — and they don’t consume real goods (much). Again, my intuition tells me that these facts would bring complex dynamic interaction effects into play. While it might suffice to simplify by modeling things “as if” children were buying bonds from their parents, I don’t feel confident that that’s true.</p>
<p>4. The question Krugman was <em>really</em> asking, underlying his “is debt a future burden” locution, was: A. should we be taxing more or less? and B. should we be spending more or less? (<em>Hence</em>, should we be borrowing more or less?) Since I’d expect to see complex interaction effects from any of the four sources/uses choice combinations, isolating the question in this way seems like a questionable analytical technique. It’s kind of (not wanting to offend, can’t resist the word) petifogging. I’m not at all sure it provides useful information when divorced from the relevant context.</p>
<p>5. Semantics: assuming the model’s right, that we’re forcing a future generation of people to pay for their parents’ (our?) extra consumption — but not changing the amount that all future people will consume <i>in toto</i> — should we call that “a burden on future generations”? I’ll leave that to the philosophers.</p>
<p>I may (still) be displaying an inadequate understanding of the model in some points here, but I think there’s enough of merit above to discourage certainty — to question the ultimate utility of the model.</p>
<p>In short, if I was running a business of any size (yes: I have done so), with any decent amount of money on the line, I would 1. not give a huge amount of weight to the results of this model, and/or 2. be asking for a much more sophisticated analysis.</p>
<p>Which (#2) leaves us again where we were, wrestling with many/most of the big questions of growth macro.</p>
<p>So when Nick says “I thought we <em>all</em> had this debt burden stuff sorted out 30 years ago,” I agree. The answer was “maybe.” (Especially given the long-term historical <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/the-meme-that-refuses-to-die-government-debt-must-be-paid-back.html">reality</a> of the Galbraithian scenario described above.) And in my mind it still is — with a little more weight on the “burden” side.</p>

                                                                            <a href="./../index.html" class="post-category-41" title="Steve Roth"><div class="color-box"></div>Steve Roth</a>                                                                     </div>

                                <p>As (mis)conceived by most economists, money (which they confute here with currency) emerged as a solution to the time problem of barter economies: my spinach is ready now, but your apples won’t be ripe for months. How can we trade? Answer: you give me money for my spinach, and I give it back to you later for your apples.</p>
<p>That armchair-sourced fairy tale has been <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/55128105/Wray-L-Randall-The-Origins-of-Money-and-the-Development-of-the-Modern-Financial-System-1997">resoundingly</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Debt-First-5-000-Years/dp/1933633867">debunked</a> — that’s <em>not</em> how money (or even currency) emerged, and the Adam Smithian butcher/baker barter-exchange economy has never existed. Credit money — first embodied in tally marks on clay tablets — emerged and was in widespread use a couple of thousand years before coinage was invented (the latter largely to pay soldiers, whose itinerancy makes other methods problematic).<br />But the notion of barter economies lives on.</p>
<p>The whole system of national accounts (the NIPAs), in fact, was constructed by Simon Kuznets and company in the 30s as if we lived in a barter economy — with money being merely a time-shifting convenience, and with no accounting for financial assets at all. That accounting was only added a decade or so later, with publication of the Fed Flow of Funds accounts.</p>
<p>I’d like to suggest that this barter model for the real economy results in a great deal of confusion — including (especially?) among economists — largely because the NIPAs don’t usefully model the distinction between saving wheat (which can be consumed) and “saving” money (which can’t). By “useful” I mean “conceptually tractable, subject to consideration without logical error.”<br />I’m asserting that the barter model of the real economy results in lots of confusion and logical error. V<em>iz</em>: careful economic thinkers like <a href="http://worthwhile.typepad.com/worthwhile_canadian_initi/2012/01/why-saving-should-be-banned.html">Nick Rowe</a>, <a href="http://www.themoneyillusion.com/?p=12617">Scott Sumner</a>, and <a href="http://blog.andyharless.com/2009/11/investment-makes-saving-possible.html">Andy Harless</a> feeling the need/inclination to write lengthy think-pieces on that nature of “S.” Or the widespread misconception that “saving” (by whatever definition) “creates” “loanable funds.”</p>
<p>I’d even go so far as to say that those barter-model-induced logical errors pervade most thinking about economies and economics, both among economists and among the laity.<br />However: If you want to see a market that <em>does</em> operate as a barter economy, look no further than the market for financial assets. In this market, you trade your checking-account or money-market deposits for shares of Apple stock. Somebody else makes the opposite trade. The transaction is mutual and (effectively) instantaneous and simultaneous. It’s a barter.</p>
<p>In a very real and very counterintuitive sense, <em>there is no money exchange in the financial markets</em>. There are just barter swaps of financial assets.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />A proleptic response to inevitable objections, and a definition of terms:<br />1. By “financial asset” I mean something that has exchange value — somebody will give you something in exchange for it — but that cannot be consumed (directly or through use or time/natural decay/obsolescence), providing actual human value — “utility” — in the process. (Things that can be so consumed, and do provide human utility — and derive their perceived value from that utility — are real goods/assets.)</p>
<p>2. “Money,” then, would be that exchange value <em>as embodied</em> (or metaphorically “stored”) in financial assets. Money cannot, in fact, even exist except as it is so embodied. Financial assets are money’s <em>sines qua non </em>– the things without which it does not exist.<br />Those financial assets (and the money they embody) can be tallied — represented — on clay tablets or in electronic accounting systems, in mental accounting ledgers (“You owe me”), or in physically exchangeable representations of those ledger tallies, such as dollar bills or stock certificates.<br />By this definition, a dollar bill or a deposit in a checking account is a financial asset, just as much as a share of stock or a government bond is. Which means that all exchanges of financial assets are swaps. Trades. Barters.</p>
<p>Exchanges for real goods, however, are different. When you buy or sell a real good, money (embodied in a financial asset) moves from one account to another, and — this is key — doesn’t disappear. It keeps getting passed on, exchanged. Real goods move the other way, and do disappear. You’re trading something that only has exchange value for something that can — <em>will</em> – be consumed. Conceptually: Financial assets travel in circles. Real goods travel in one direction only: from birth to death, production to consumption.</p>
<p>A physical metaphor may help: think of the financial system (including physical currency transactions) as a giant wheel, pushing along a conveyor belt of real goods.<br />But economists try to think about/model these very different situations as identical — as if “money” were being exchanged for bonds (and implicitly, as if those bonds will eventually be “consumed”). Since (mental) models for barter economies must be structured very differently from models for monetary economies,* modeling both of these as the same is problematic, confusing, and productive of logical errors — and perhaps even just plain wrong.</p>
<p>The gist of this thinking is not new — much of it reflects ideas floated long ago by circuitists, chartalists, modern monetary theorists, and other such (g)ists. But I’m hoping the formulation as presented here may be useful to others, as it is to me, in 1. forming mental/conceptual models of how economies work, and 2. evaluating the models bruited by others — notably the inherent validity of their underlying and often unstated assumptions.</p>
<p>I would point out in particular that as with my discussion here, the accounting-based modeling approach of <a href="http://mmtwiki.org/wiki/Wynne_Godley_and_Stock-Flow_Consistent_(SFC)_Macro_Modeling_%E2%80%94_Monetary_Economics">Wynne Godley</a> (and his predecessors, successors, collaborators, and parallel travelers) begins not where Kuznets did — with the interchange of real goods and services — but with the nuts and bolts of financial accounting. This approach imposes logical constraints on economists’ reasoning, constraints that seem sadly lacking in much barter-economy thinking.<br />As Godley says in the conclusion to his seminal <a href="http://www.dspace.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/225167">paper</a>:<br />
<blockquote>In contrast to the standard textbook methodology, which starts by making very strong behavioural assumptions based on no empirical evidence at all (for example regarding the shape and role of an aggregate neo-classical production function), [this methodology suggests that] a different paradigm is indicated in which knowledge is gradually built up by empirical study, within the formidable constraints imposed by double entry accounting.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m not saying it’s impossible to think logically and coherently using the NIPA/Flow of Funds economic model, with the (confusing) barter and savings models embodied in the NIPAs. I’m saying it’s very difficult — especially since economists aren’t trained in financial accounting — and that as a result logical failures are widespread.</p>

                                <p>I’ve noticed that many others, like me, are puzzled by the <em>mechanics</em> of the Saving=Investment accounting identity. How do household savings get <em>instantly and perfectly intermediated</em>, in a period, into investment spending — the purchase/creation of long-term productive fixed assets?
<p>An Aha! for me: According to Krugman’s textbook, they don’t.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Screen-shot-2012-01-17-at-7.34.19-AM.png"><img title="Screen shot 2012-01-17 at 7.34.19 AM" src="http://www.asymptosis.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Screen-shot-2012-01-17-at-7.34.19-AM.png" alt="" width="570"></a></p>
<p>First a correction: “The saving<s>s</s>[sic]-investment identity is a fact of [the] accounting [methods developed in the 30s by Kuznets and company to model production of goods and services the national economy].”</p>
<p>But that aside.</p>
<p>If people spend less than producers expect in a given year, the producers create too much product, and it builds up their inventories. That’s easy to understand. (It’s easier if you think about the producers instead of the car-dealer intermediaries that Krugman talks about.)</p>
<p>In the NIPA model, that inventory is counted as “investment.” This makes sense as far as it goes — that inventory is stored real value, stuff that can be consumed/sold for consumption in future periods. As Mankiw explains it in his textbook:</p>
<p><img title="Screen shot 2012-01-17 at 8.01.45 AM" src="http://www.asymptosis.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Screen-shot-2012-01-17-at-8.01.45-AM.png" alt="" width="552" height="159"></p>
<p>But this explanation also pretty much obliterates the widespread and sloppy notion that increased saving (“<em>not</em> spending”) results in — causes — more productive “fixed investment.” The increased “investment” resulting from increased personal savings is used to expand <em>inventory. </em>The causations/incentives driving fixed investment are utterly other.</p>
<p>This also makes sense: when people are spending <em>less</em> (are “saving” more), does that spur producers to invest <em>more</em> in their businesses — buy/create more fixed assets?</p>
<p>Both recent and immemorial history suggest quite the opposite.</p>

<p>But I have to make an exception <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/15/the-great-gatsby-curve/">here</a> because he adds to <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/trends-in-intergenerational-mobility-declining-opportunity-since-1980.html">my</a> <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/more-on-american-inequality-and-lack-of-opportunity.html">trove</a> <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/meritocratic-opportunity-on-the-decline.html">of</a> <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/pubs-and-economic-opportunity-not.html">graphs</a> demonstrating how America today — after thirty years of Reaganomics policies that were supposed to be all about freedom, liberty, and economic opportunity for all (yeah, and I have a bridge for sale), is at the bottom of the heap when it comes to economic opportunity.</p>
<p>The shining city on the hill keeps getting smaller and richer, and the slopes leading up to it steeper, rougher, and slicker.</p>
<p>That opportunity is best displayed through intergenerational mobility — what my friend Steve calls “convection.” What are the odds that a child will be in a different economic stratum from his parents? It’s a darned good measure of “meritocracy.”</p>
<p>Here’s the key graphic:</p>

<blockquote><p>On the vertical axis is the intergenerational elasticity of income — how much a 1 percent rise in your father’s income affects your expected income; the higher this number, the lower is social mobility.</p>

                                <p>Ever since Bryan offered this <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2009/05/ill_bet_on_it_i.html">bet</a> on future unemployment rates in the U.S. and Europe, I’ve been wondering: how do incarceration rates affect those numbers?
<p>Europe has consistently higher unemployment than the U.S., but the U.S. has far and away the highest incarceration rate in the world — .75% of the population. (<a href="http://www.kcl.ac.uk/depsta/law/research/icps/downloads/wppl-8th_41.pdf">World Prison Population List</a> [PDF], compiled since 1992 by Roy Walmsley of the <a href="http://www.prisonstudies.org/">International Centre for Prison Studies</a>.)</p>
<p>Only Russia comes even close, at .63%. (Canada: .12%. Australia: .13%. China .18%. Germany .09%.) Our rate is four to eight times that of most other countries.</p>
<p>Prisoners aren’t part of the unemployment calculation. They’re not counted as part of the work force, and they’re not counted as unemployed. There are various arguments about whether that makes sense (feel free to comment), but if we include them in the calculations, what do unemployment rates look like? In particular, Bryan’s bet makes me curious: <strong>How does U.S. unemployment compare to the EU15?</strong>*</p>
<p>Here are the numbers for 2008. Calculations based on labor force and unemployment figures from Eurostat.</p>

<p>In 2008, <em>all of the difference</em> between EU15 and U.S. unemployment rates is accounted for by the prison population. The cynical view would say that we just imprison our unemployed, which doesn’t strike me as the most economically efficient arrangement. (Here putting aside any foolish notions of Christian charity or the like.)</p>
<p>I would have liked to do a fever graph comparing unemployment rate, incarceration rate, and combined rate over the years, but the data’s only available in fairly intractable country-by-country <a href="http://www.prisonstudies.org/info/worldbrief/">form</a>, and I didn’t have time or energy for all the cutting and pasting. (I wrote to Mr. Walmsley and he was nice enough to reply, but he was unable to provide the data in a more usable form.)</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Eyeballing the data, <em>I do not think incarceration accounts for the (significantly larger) differences in previous years. </em>(I would suggest that the additional difference is mostly the result of labor-market and other market rigidities imposed by unions and government regulation — not the result of redistribution. But that’s another post.)</p>
<p>Perhaps one of my gentle readers might have the time and inclination to compile those years? Or, write to Roy Walmsley and ask him to provide a simple table of the data that only he has: prison population by country and year. All the other data, at least for OECD countries, is easily available.</p>

                                <p>You hear from lots of people — including lots of economists — that they do. Because they’re monopolistic price-fixers, they distort economic decisions and make us all worse off.
<p>The theory makes sense, as far as it goes. But if it were really true you’d expect to see it in the data. This got me curious&#8230;</p>
<p>Compare percent union representation to GDP/capita by state:</p>
<p><img title="unions gdp by state" src="http://www.asymptosis.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/unions-gdp-by-state.png" alt="" width="500" height="371"></p>
<p>The correlation is actually pretty strongly positive — .56. <strong>More union representation, more prosperity.</strong> (Or the other way around…)</p>
<p>It’s also worth noticing: <strong>Lower-left, red states. Upper right, blue states.</strong> Go figger.</p>
<p><strong>Update: </strong>I really do have to point out the other delicious oddity here: Sarah Palin’s Socialist Utopia of Alaska is second only to the Evil Empire, New York, in union representation.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Imagine that over the next week (in a closed American economy — the rest of the world has never existed) everyone sold all their financial assets, paid off all their debts, and deposited the remaining money (and any currency they have) in their checking accounts. No money-market funds, even. Just banks with reserve accounts at the Fed, holding everybody’s money in “cash.”
<p>All those other financial asset prices would dive to zero. Late sellers would sell for nothing.</p>
<p>Would the remaining money in all the bank accounts equal U.S. government debt? That seems to be the implication of MMT thinking, because the remaining money only exists because it got spent into existence by the government deficit spending — crediting bank accounts with that fiat, <em>ex nihilo</em> money in the first place.</p>
<p>Net financial assets = gross financial assets = government debt</p>
<p>(If the government had always just deficit-spent instead of borrowing to cover its deficits, “government debt” would be replaced by “cumulative to-date government deficit spending.”)</p>
<p>I ask not just for clarity, but because (as always), I’m struggling with the relationship between fixed assets and financial assets, between saving and investment.</p>
<p>It’s said that the true wealth of the nation — the “national savings” — consists of its real assets: stuff that can be consumed in the future through use and time/natural decay. The NIPAs only count “fixed assets” — hardware (equipment), software, and structures, so let’s pretend that those constitute all real assets (which they don’t in actuality — not by a long shot). Net investment — purchases/creation minus consumption of fixed assets — increases the stock of fixed assets/”savings.”</p>
<p>In theory, financial assets are just financialized, monetized representatives, proxies, for the real, fixed assets that underly them. And indeed over the (very?) long term, the quantity of fixed assets and net financial assets rise together. Both are much larger today in the U.S. than they are in Thailand, or the U.S. in 1910. Financial-asset values wander all over — even over decades — based on “animal spirits,” but again in the long term…</p>
<p>If that’s so, then in our thought experiment:</p>
<p>Net financial assets = gross financial assets = <strong>government debt = fixed assets</strong></p>
<p>The quantity of fixed assets increases over time through net investment. But by MMT thinking, net financial assets can only increase through government deficit spending (or trade surpluses). What is the mechanism whereby government deficit spending is translated into more net financial assets that embody the increased stock of fixed assets?</p>
<p>I imagine a necessarily political mechanism something like the following:</p>
<p>1. People and businesses buy/create fixed assets, resulting in more economic activity — creating/consuming, buying/selling, spending/income.</p>
<p>2. Those increased quantities (both stocks and flows) create more demand for government services. Both individuals and businesses would be decidedly unhappy, I’m thinking, if today’s government were the same size it was, at least in absolute terms, in 1870. (Conservatives and libertarians may say otherwise, but <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/okay-conservatives-what-spending-shall-we-cut.html">they’re talking through their hats</a>.)</p>
<p>3. Legislators and executives who don’t provide those increased services don’t get re-elected.</p>
<p>4. Taxation lags behind spending — resulting in deficits — because A) people hate taxes and vote against politicians who raise them, and B) if deficit spending is not sufficient to match the increases in fixed assets, <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/this-time-is-different-federal-debt-didnt-dive-before-the-depression.html">depressions result</a>, and the “fiscally responsible” leaders get voted out.</p>
<p>5. The new money from government deficit spending is used to purchase financial assets, driving their prices up to (roughly) match the value of fixed assets.</p>
<p>This is thinking of government and the Fed as one consolidated entity. If you think of them as separate, you can imagine a different mechanism, in which the Fed and the congress/president are engaged in a constant <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/scott-sumner-the-2009-stimulus-was-sabotaged-by-the-fed.html">chicken game</a> over inflation, unemployment, and GDP growth, to determine how and when to increase the amount of money/net financial assets (ultimately through deficit spending) to match the stock of fixed assets.</p>
<p>These mechanics would also explain how buying/creating a bunch of drill presses will — through a long, tangled, and messy political process, and in the long but not the short run — result in more “loanable funds.”</p>
