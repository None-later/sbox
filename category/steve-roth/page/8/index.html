                                <p>John Sides at The Monkey Cage makes what seems to be <a href="http://themonkeycage.org/blog/2012/06/04/independents-are-mostly-partisans-chapter-gazillion/">an incredibly important point</a>, at least for politico types. In the latest Pew report (<a href="http://www.people-press.org/files/legacy-pdf/06-04-12%20Values%20Release.pdf">PDF</a>) that everyone’s nattering about, we see a big rise in “independent” voters over the last decade (to 38%).
<p>But:</p>
<blockquote><p>only 12% of respondents did not identify with or lean toward a party</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And if you look at the leaners, they’re just as partisan as the fully-declared party supporters:</p>
<p><img title="leaners" src="http://themonkeycage.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/pewleaners.png" alt="" width="361" height="684"></p>
<p>So pretty much everyone who’s paying attention has taken sides.</p>
<p>Do with that what you will.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>In a recent <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/the-american-conservative-extractive-elites-and-macro-corruption.html">post</a> I spoke with astonishment and admiration of an <a href="http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/chinas-rise-americas-fall">article/post</a> by Ron Unz in the May issue of <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_American_Conservative">The American Conservative</a></em> (he’s the publisher) that laid out a realistic, fact-based, cogent, and coherent portrait of our current economic situation. (I also pointed out that he 1. couched the post in an odd and unnecessarily tangential framing, vis-a-vis China, and 2. ignored what I consider to be the most obvious causes of that situation — thirty years of “conservative” economic ascendancy and the resulting empowerment/engorgement of the financial industry).*</p>
<p>I’ve been reading <em>TAC</em> regularly since then (yes: I’m <em>way</em> behind the curve on this), and I think it’s great. These guys fully understand that the dominant Republican/Conservative rhetoric is radical, specious, contrary to reality, and ignorant, blind to, or completely dismissive of the most basic facts on the ground — the stark, simple realities of economic history.</p>
<p><a href="http://unz.org/">Here’s</a> a guy who likes historical fact.</p>
<p>They understand that today’s so-called “conservatives” are anything but conservative. I could talk economics and politics with them over drinks without wanting to shoot myself in the head in the first twelve minutes. These are Edmund Burke/Dwight David Eisenhower conservatives. <em>We could work with these people</em>.</p>
<p>Yes, I think they still skew their causal interpretations in ways that ignore what seem to me to be patent realities, but they’re not the intentionally blind and/or shameless cherry-pickers, fact-distorters, and logic-contorters that comprise the whole Republican power structure — all the way from the base to Boehner (and decidedly including a large cohort of top-credentialed academic economists).</p>
<p>Speaking of Boehner, here’s a great example by <a href="http://www.theamericanconservative.com/author/scott-galupo/">Scott Galupo</a> – a <em>TAC</em> contributor, former staffer for Boehner, and former staff writer for the Sun Myung Moon-founded (and decidedly righty) <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Times">Washington Times</a>.</em><br /><em><br /></em><br /><a href="http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/scott-galupo/2011/11/01/ronald-reagan-practiced-keynesian-economics-successfully">Ronald Reagan Practiced Keynesian Economics Successfully – (usnews.com)</a>.</p>
<p>I’m not completely taken with this piece. He pretty much skirts the fact that Bush I and Clinton policies embodied exactly the responsible Keynesianism that he recommends (as do I) and that Reagan practiced (to some debatably greater or lesser degree) — pull back on stimulus, raise taxes as needed, and trim deficits in the good times, putting money in the bank for the bad times. And he definitely doesn’t mention how well those Bush I and (especially) Clinton policies seem to have worked out for economic growth. But still: he’s nowhere near the asylum that is modern mainstream “conservatism.”</p>
<p>So here’s a loud shoutout to <em>The American Conservative, </em>and to others of similar stripe (all of whom have been excommunicated or ignored by the Palin paleos and their nutjob nabobs). <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Frum">David Frum</a>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Bartlett">Bruce Bartlett.</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Buckley_(novelist)">Christopher Buckley</a>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reihan_Salam" title="Reihan Salam">Reihan Salam</a>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Manzi_(political_commentator)">Jim Manzi</a>. (My gentle readers can undoubtedly list more.) Give them your links, your &#8220;likes,&#8221; and your Google love. (Damn, I might even subscribe.) Talk to them. If we ever manage to emerge from the political and economic morass delivered unto us by the modern Republican party, these people and others like them are likely to be leading the way — in our direction.</p>
<p>* I was somewhat put out that Ron linked to my post in a <a href="http://www.ronunz.org/2012/05/07/when-half-a-million-americans-died-and-nobody-noticed/">followup</a> as if my comments were unequivocably approbative, ignoring what I think were important criticisms. But hey.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Following up on some work I did a while back (<a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/capital-in-the-american-economy-since-1930-kuznets-revisited.html">Kuznets Revisited: Investment in the American Economy Since 1929</a>), I got curious about what consumption has looked like in America over the last 80 years.</p>
<p>I’ll give you the results first, as a proportion of output, or GDP, followed by explanation and discussion. Click for larger.<br /><a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/US-consumption-to-output.png"><img alt="" height="328" src="http://www.asymptosis.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/US-consumption-to-output-480x328.png" title="US consumption to output" width="480"></a></p>
<p><strong>Thinking About Consumption</strong><br /><strong></strong>This all requires some explanation. First off, when I use the word “real” herein, it doesn’t mean “inflation-adjusted.” It means real-world, nonfinancial. In national-account-speak, all consumption and investment spending is about purchases of real goods and services — things that are produced and consumed. Financial “goods” or “assets” — which aren’t/can’t be consumed by humans — aren’t even part of the accounting. (We’re “inside” the NIPAs.)</p>
<p>Next: when you hear economists talk about “consumption,” they’re almost always talking about something somewhat different: consumption <em>spending. </em>Definition: purchases, within a period, of goods and services that are consumed within that same period. (If the period you’re looking at is long enough, everything is consumption. If it’s short enough, everything’s investment — breakfast is an investment in the afternoon’s work. I’ll just talk about one-year periods here to keep things simple.)</p>
<p>But in any period, we’re also consuming stuff that was produced in the past, and so is not included in measures of consumption spending. We’re depleting inventories (these fluctuate up and down over the years, sort of a buffer stock), but more importantly we’re consuming real, long-term productive assets by using them, and through the inevitable decay of time (and obsolescence — a tricky technical accounting issue that I won’t explore here). When you run a drill press you’re using it up. You’re <em>consuming</em> it. It’s even true of living in your house. Absent maintenance and remodels, it eventually becomes a worthless heap of rotting lumber; you’ve consumed its value by living in it.</p>
<p>This is accounted for in the national accounts as Consumption of Fixed Capital (CFC).* (Fixed capital is broken down into equipment, software, and structures, and structures are further broken down into residential and non-residential. Consumer durables — cars and refrigerators — aren’t included in fixed capital because it would require national accountants to model households as production centers).</p>
<p>But even with that big C-word at the beginning of its name, economists rarely include CFC as part of “consumption.” In the national accounts you’ll find it accounted for as part of investment — Gross Investment minus CFC is Net Investment, or the net amount added to our national horde of fixed assets. (When you hear macroeconomists talk about investment, it’s almost always shorthand for “gross investment.”)</p>
<p>So: Consumption of Fixed Capital is <em>not</em> spending<em>, </em>but it <em>is </em>(actual, if estimated) consumption<em>.</em><br />I was wondering how much of our real output we actually consume each year, so I added CFC to consumption spending to get what I’ll call Gross Consumption (with <em>Net</em> Investment being the remainder of national spending).**</p>
<p>Coming back to the graph, we see:</p>
<p>• A denominator-driven spike in these measures during the depression (GDP plummeted).</p>
<p>• A rapid decline in the pre-war and war years driven by 1. rising GDP and 2. a massive temporary increase in government consumption spending. (Factoid: In just seven years 1940-1947, government’s share of national consumption spending went from 13% to 39% and back to 16%.)</p>
<p>• A steady period of relatively low consumption from the late 40s until the mid 70s or early 80s (depending which measure you look at).</p>
<p>• Consuming an increasingly large portion of our national output since the late 70s/early 80s — with Gross Consumption just shy of 100% ’08-’10.</p>
<p>(The timing of the 70s/80s breakpoint is somewhat unclear because of the high and variable inflation of that period, which had a significant impact on estimates of capital consumption. Changed amortization and depreciation schedules, applied against the whole existing stock of fixed assets, results in significant moves.)</p>
<p>The depression and war years are pretty to easy to understand. What’s interesting here is the trend change since the 70s/80s. That change is not generally driven by more rapid capital consumption: that’s been pretty steady over the decades (though business capital consumption has accelerated as the capital proportions have shifted from longer-lived structures to more rapidly depreciating hardware and software):<br /><img alt="" height="328" src="http://www.asymptosis.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/image001-480x328.jpg" title="investment" width="480"></p>
<p>You can see that in the first graph as well; the two lines have moved pretty much in synch.</p>
<p>So the long-term trend change for the nation as a whole is simply toward more consumption spending and less investment spending. That may seem obvious to some, but it’s nice to know it for sure.</p>
<p>It’s the same 70s/80s inflection point and secular shift that we see in so many other measures, especially various measures of economic growth (pointed out repeatedly by so many, notably on Angry Bear by Mike Kimel, <em>moi</em>, Jazzbumpa, and others, and serving as the impelling premise of Tyler Cowen’s <em>The Great Stagnation</em>).</p>
<p>I can think of a dozen different explanations, interpretations, and rhetorical riffs off of this three-decade trend. While most have a perjorative and pessimistic import, not all do. Perhaps we’ve gotten better at supply-chain management, so we require an ever-smaller buffer stock of real stuff relative to consumption and output. Or maybe we don’t need as much productive stuff — as it’s measured in dollar terms in the national accounts — to produce the same dollar-denominated quantities for consumption.</p>
<p>These strike me as pretty charitable and speculative explanations, though. The most obvious interpretation is suggested by the title of this post: we’re consuming more and more of our seed corn (and tractors), leaving less for future consumption and production (and growth). That may be true, or it may be simplistically reductive.</p>
<p>For the moment I’ll leave that determination to my gentle readers, and simply leave you with a long-term view of what seems to be an important and not-widely-discussed measure — Gross Consumption — describing how our economy has been operating over the last eighty years.</p>
<p>* I really wish they said “fixed assets” instead of “fixed capital,” because economists are so profoundly confused about what “capital” means. (Many seem to think that fixed “capital” and financial “capital” are equally parts of some synonymous, homogenous, or vaguely contiguous undifferentiated blob.) Many everyday folks are equally confused about “assets,” but most economists seem to understand at least dimly that real (or at least fixed) assets and financial assets are decidedly different things that can’t be thought about, analyzed, or modeled in the same ways. The key in discussion is to <em>always</em> specify what type of assets or capital you’re talking about, especially differentiating between financial and real (with fixed being a subset of real that happens to be fairly easily measurable by totting up money transactions).</p>
<p>** Here ignoring the trade balance for the moment; we purchase 3 or 4% more than we produce these days — part consumption spending, part investment spending — because <em>in toto </em>we import more than we export. Don’t be confused by the GDP = Production = Expenditures = Consumption Spending + Investment Spending = Income identity; that’s only true in a closed economy.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>In the comments on my recent <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/home-work-gdp-and-family-values-its-nice-to-be-validated.html">Home Work, GDP, and Family Values</a>, which discusses a recent <a href="http://www.bea.gov/scb/pdf/2012/05%20May/0512_household.pdf">study</a> (PDF) on the subject, Saturos <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/home-work-gdp-and-family-values-its-nice-to-be-validated.html#comment-4878">points</a> to <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2012/06/two_improper_co.html">this Arnold Kling post</a> replying to a <a href="http://conversableeconomist.blogspot.com/2012/05/household-production-levels-and-trends.html">Timothy Taylor post</a> summarizing that study.</p>
<p>Saturos thinks Arnold’s post is “excellent.” I think otherwise.</p>
<p>Arnold says “the value of household production” is an “improper concept to measure.” His reasoning:<br />
<blockquote>Should you measure the value of the deck by multiplying the number of hours I spend on it times the wage rate of a professional carpenter? If the carpenter takes 40 hours and I take 4000 hours, then you want to tell me that my deck is 100 times more valuable?</p></blockquote>
<p>So it’s “improper to measure” this concept because Timothy suggests the wrong wage rate to be used in the measurement/estimate. (Be Very Clear Here: <em>all</em> of the national accounts values are estimates, some more firmly grounded than others.)</p>
<p>I agree that the value of home production shouldn’t be estimated based on what a professional would charge for the same work; that makes no sense. The median wage — what I suggested in my post — does, especially since we’re talking in terms of aggregate national amounts. This completely ameliorates the problem that Arnold’s objection is based upon (basically, normalizing for “utility” and market value) — perhaps not perfectly but very effectively, estimating based on dollar-denominated, market-determined values.</p>
<p>But Arnold seems to want to do much more than correct the estimate. He wants to make off-limits any estimates of productive work not involving monetary exchange. It’s “improper” to even <em>measure </em>the concepts. They’re not just hard to estimate; they’re <em>wrong</em> to estimate.</p>
<p>Discussions of proper methods and targets for national accounting go way back. You’ll find them in spades in Kuznets (basically the father of modern national accounting) as far back as <a href="http://www.nber.org/books/kuzn46-2">1946</a>. For an excellent overview of the history and issues, see Jorgensen and Landefeld’s 2004 <a href="http://www.nber.org/CRIW/CRIWs04/jorgenson.pdf">Blueprint for an Expanded and Integrated Set of Accounts for the United States</a> (PDF).</p>
<p>Three snippets from that fine work:</p>
<blockquote><p>Simon Kuznets, one of the primary architects of the U.S. accounts, recognized the limitations of focusing on market activities and excluding household production and a broad range of other non-market activities and assets that have productive value or yield satisfaction. The need to better understand the sources of economic growth in the post-war era led to the development—much of it by academic researchers—of various supplemental series, such as investments in human capital.</p></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>Kuznets (1946), favored development of a much broader set of welfare-orientated accounts that would focus on sustainability and address the externalities and social costs associated with economic development.</p></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>Work by Nordhaus and Tobin (1973), among others, on adjusting traditional economic accounts for changes in leisure time, disamenities of urbanization, exhaustion of natural resources, population growth, and other aspects of welfare produced indicators of economic well-being.</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s hard to avoid imputing normative objectives to Arnold’s objection. If you outlaw measurement of things that are not represented by money transactions, you essentially outlaw discussion of utility (or, the equivalent: pre-assume that one dollar always and everywhere equals one “util”). This avoids the need to perceive some obvious implications of Textbook Economic Concepts like declining marginal utility, which tells us that transferring money from the rich to the poor, <em>ceteris paribus</em>, creates utility out of thin air.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t even dream of saying that Arnold makes these kinds of assertions to please his masters at Mercatus. (No names, just initials: Koch.) But I have no qualms saying that if he didn’t make these kinds of assertions, he wouldn’t have ended up there. <em>See</em> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing_Consent:_The_Political_Economy_of_the_Mass_Media">Manufacturing Consent</a>.</p>

                                <p>Andrew Rosenthal <a href="http://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/29/give-me-your-tired-your-over-taxed/">points us</a> to one of the most eye-poppingly specious arguments I’ve ever seen against high-earner taxes, from <a href="http://taxfoundation.org/blog/eduardo-saverin-any-different-rich-new-york-snowbirds">Scott Hodge at the Tax Foundation</a> (my bold).</p>
<blockquote><p>…<strong>612,520 people renounced their New York State citizenship and moved to Florida between 2000 and 2010.</strong> They took with them nearly $20 billion in adjusted gross income, after adjusting for inflation. During the same period, <strong>208,784 Pennsylvania residents renounced their state citizenship and moved to Florida</strong>, taking $8 billion in income with them.  </p>
<p>Many of these New York and Pennsylvania residents no doubt moved to Florida for the warm weather, but <strong>many more may have moved their because the state does not have an individual income tax, an estate tax, nor an inheritance tax.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>“May have” is certainly a strong piece of evidence. It’s hard to argue with.</p>
<p>But let’s try.</p>
<p>Back when we were trying to pass a high-earner tax in Washington State a couple of years ago (with Bill Gates Senior as the lead spokesman and cheerleader; it failed dismally), I got curious to know whether millionaires do actually congregate in low-tax states.</p>
<p>It turns out they don’t:</p>
<p><img alt="" height="328" src="http://www.asymptosis.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Screen-shot-2012-05-30-at-10.05.05-AM-480x328.png" title="Screen shot 2012-05-30 at 10.05.05 AM" width="480"></p>
<p>The correlation is -0.00003. Notice in particular the giant gaping hole in the upper left corner, where the millionaires should all be congregating. (Florida’s over there by the 5% mark.)<br /><strong><br /></strong><br /><strong>Of the 12 states with the highest concentration of millionaires, 10 (83%) have above- or at-trend (in this case, median) income tax rates.</strong></p>
<p>This Hodge piece got me curious again, so I plotted the raw number of millionaires (since this doesn’t account for population, it’s just for grins):</p>
<p><img alt="" height="327" src="http://www.asymptosis.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Screen-shot-2012-05-30-at-10.07.18-AM-480x327.png" title="Screen shot 2012-05-30 at 10.07.18 AM" width="480"></p>
<p>The correlation here is somewhat negative (lower tax rates, more millionaires), but still effectively nil: -.035. Florida and Texas do stand out, but so do New York and California. Who you gonna believe?</p>
<p>Here it is with the X-axis scale changed, so it’s easier to see the bulk of the states:</p>
<p><img alt="" height="326" src="http://www.asymptosis.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Screen-shot-2012-05-30-at-10.08.25-AM-480x326.png" title="Screen shot 2012-05-30 at 10.08.25 AM" width="480"></p>
<p>(I just noticed a screwup here: one of the MAs should be MD for Maryland.)</p>
<p>So the evidence suggests that Hodge’s fond notion is nothing more than that: something he wants to believe, which is utterly contradicted by the facts on the ground.</p>
<p>Rosenthal quotes <a href="http://www.blogger.com/Michael%20Bloomberg">Michael Bloomberg</a>, who some might consider an authoritative source on this subject:<br />
<blockquote>I can only tell you, among my friends, I’ve never heard one person say I’m going to move out of the city because of the taxes. Not one. Not in all the years I’ve lived here. You know, they can complain, ‘Ugh, I got my tax bill, it’s heavy.’ But my friends all want to live here.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Scott Hodges of this world don’t seem to have read their Adam Smith, in particular the <a href="http://www.econlib.org/library/Smith/smWN13.html#IV.2.9">passage</a> containing the “invisible hand” coinage of which they are so fond:<br />
<blockquote>…<strong>every individual endeavours to employ his capital as near home as he can,</strong> and consequently as much as he can in the support of domestic industry… <strong>By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends only his own security;</strong> and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain, and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention.</p></blockquote>
<p>How many of them do you think actually know what Smith was talking about in that passage?</p>

                                <p>A while back I <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/home-work-25-of-gdp.html">put together a rough calc</a> estimating what our country’s “home-work” is worth as a share of GDP, based on the idea that such work <em>is</em> production, and that it has every bit as much value to our lives as work that we get paid for.</p>
<p>By that estimate (based on the BLS American Time Use Survey), adding the value of home work performed at the median wage would increase our measured GDP by 33%.</p>
<p>It turns out that that estimate was pretty good. <a href="http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/28/valuing-domestic-product/">Nancy Folbre</a> points to an article in this month’s <a href="http://www.bea.gov/scb/pdf/2012/05%20May/0512_household.pdf">Survey of Current Business</a> (PDF) that comes to quite similar conclusions:<br />
<blockquote>inclusion raises the level of G.D.P. 39 percent in 1965 and 25.7 percent in 2010.</p></blockquote>
<p>I also surmised that since Europeans work less hours than Americans (we work four more weeks every year than they do), they would have more time for unpaid work, so the contribution of such work to GDP would be higher in EU countries. Following the data trail back from the SCB piece led me to <a href="http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/social-issues-migration-health/cooking-caring-and-volunteering-unpaid-work-around-the-world_5kghrjm8s142-en">Cooking, Caring and Volunteering: Unpaid Work Around the World</a> by Veerle Miranda, based on the <a href="http://www.blogger.com/www.timeuse.org/mtus">Multinational Time Use Study</a>. We find therein:</p>

<p>With the exception of Norway (where total GDP is greatly reliant on oil revenues), the European countries do indeed range well up the scale from the U.S.</p>

                                <p>If you’ve ever been involved in a legal contention, like a business or personal dispute or a contested divorce, you know that the whole game pivots, ultimately, on the potential end game: what <em>would</em> happen if the thing went to court — even if (even because) everyone involved knows that it never will. The fact that it <em>could</em>, and the expected results if push <em>did </em>come to shove, determine the terrain of the playing field and the positions of the players, and all the ploys and counterploys played out on that field.
<p>Ryan Avent brings that principle to bear in one of the <a href="http://www.economist.com/comment/1432940#comment-1432940">nicest pieces</a> I’ve seen laying out the game theory of monetary policy over the next couple of years. For my purposes, starting with the end game (my bold):</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>At one extreme</strong>, we can imagine <strong>a situation in which America’s government has entirely lost market confidence</strong> and is unable to sell its debt. In that case, <strong>the central bank, as lender of last resort, would be unable to avoid stepping in to buy that debt, in the process transferring control over inflation to the fiscal authorities.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Voilá: MMT World, where Treasury is simply spending newly-created money into existence, at the behest of the legislative and executive branches, by depositing it in recipients’ bank accounts. Bond/debt issuance is immaterial, because the Fed has no choice but to buy all the new bonds for “cash.” (Yes, the Fed is actually “printing” the money, but effectively the Treasury is doing so.) There is no Fed “independence.”</p>
<p>This is the scenario that would result if the Republicans were foolish and feckless enough to take their chicken game to the limit and let the head-on collision actually occur, with a default on U.S. debt. It’s the expected (inevitable) result if they “take it to court” — at least if they leave it that way for any period. (Has anybody mentioned the irony of the Republicans’ claim to be creating “confidence”? And, do you think they’d like the MMT World that they’re unwittingly trying to create? They really should, given how much they dislike the “unelected” Fed making decisions…)</p>
<p>Now moving one step back from that end game, Ryan looks at three “fiscal cliff” scenarios as <a href="http://cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/FiscalRestraint_0.pdf">projected</a> (PDF) by the Congressional Budget Office (using a graphic <a href="http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2012/05/defense-spending-budget-deficit-austerity-congressional-budget-office.php">from Brian Beutler at Talking Points Memo</a>):</p>
<p><a href="http://www.economist.com/comment/1432940#comment-1432940"><img src="http://www.asymptosis.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/cliff.jpg" alt="" width="595" height="463"></a></p>
<p>Just to multiply this out for you, one-year growth under the three scenarios (Q4/12–Q4/13) would be circa 0%, 2%, and 4%.</p>
<p>These scenarios all assume that<em> the Fed <a href="http://worthwhile.typepad.com/worthwhile_canadian_initi/2011/06/the-macroeconomics-of-doing-nothing.html">does “nothing”</a> in response — </em>which I’ll define as keeping their balance sheet the same size, with no big (net) bond/asset purchases or sales, and making no announcements that that will change.</p>
<p>Which means we need to take another step away from the end game. Here looking at the righthand scenario:</p>
<blockquote><p>Except, of course, that the economy will almost certainly not grow at a 5.3% rate no matter what Congress does. Arguments to the contrary are subject to what econ bloggers have come to call the Sumner Critique… Growth that rapid would … [prompt] steps to tighten monetary policy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em></em>In Sumner’s words, the Fed — as the last player in every round of the game — would “<a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/scott-sumner-the-2009-stimulus-was-sabotaged-by-the-fed.html">sabotage</a>” any growth that rapid (especially, I would add, if it saw any traces of that terrifying bogeyman, “wage inflation”).</p>
<p><strong>All the players know that the Fed can do this</strong> by simply selling bonds (something they have no shortage of). Bond prices drop, yields and market rates rise, people borrow and spend less, confidence drops, stocks decline, people feel less wealthy, unemployment rises, inflation (and growth) are held in check. As they are at pains to remind us, the Fed has spent decades building this inflation- (and, collaterally, wage- and employment-)quashing credibility.</p>
<p><strong>Nor does anyone doubt that they <em>will </em> do it.</strong> They always do, have done since Volcker.</p>
<p>But what about the other push-comes-to-shove scenario — the “fiscal cliff” on the left?</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>The Fed could therefore proclaim to the world that will maintain aggregate demand growth</strong> (in the form of, say, nominal income growth) at all costs, and that it would by no means allow the fiscal cliff to knock the economy off its preferred path. It could explain in great detail what specific steps it would be willing to take to achieve this goal, so as to boost its credibility. And if demand expectations as reflected in equity or bond prices showed signs of weakening ahead of the cliff, the Fed could preemptively swing into the action to establish the credibility of its purpose.</p>
<p><strong>The Fed will almost certainly not do this.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>And everybody knows this.</em> After three decades of taking away the (wage- and employment-)growth punchbowl when the party starts getting (“too”) hot, and after four years of subordinating their employment mandate to their cherished inflation-control credibility, the Fed has a serious shortage of “growth credibility.”</p>
<p>Which means that the Fed has created a game that is asymmetrical. It has great power to quash growth through open-mouth operations; we <em>know</em> they’ll sell bonds if they promise and need to, and that doing so will dampen inflation (and growth).</p>
<p>But on the expansionist side, we can’t believe their promises. They would need to make actual bond purchases to spur growth. And even if they do both promise and live up to the promise, we (with the exception of [market] monetarists, few of whom are running large businesses or managing large amounts of money) don’t have great or certain expectations for the results.</p>
<p>“Show me QE3, and show me the results; I’ll believe it when I see it.”</p>
<p>But: Why won’t the Fed adopt policy that delivers strong GDP growth?</p>
<p>There’s the runaway inflation/loss-of-credibility explanation, of course. But the Fed isn’t run by adolescent freshman Republicans who think that 3 or 4 percent inflation is the slippery slope to ZimbabWeimar. They know that if they promise to let inflation rise then fall over a few years, <em>then do exactly that, </em>it would greatly <em>stengthen</em> their inflation-control reputation and credibility.</p>
<p>And there’s my theory: it would transfer hundreds of billions of dollars in real buying power per year from creditors to debtors, and the Fed is run by creditors. (<a href="http://www.interfluidity.com/v2/3212.html">Depression is a choice.</a>)</p>
<p>Ryan has a different theory:</p>
<blockquote><p>…moral hazard… if [the Fed] promises to protect the economy against reckless fiscal policy Congress will have no incentive to avoid reckless fiscal policy. … lay out a plan for medium-term fiscal consolidation but keep short-term cuts small and manageable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now you gotta ask whether manipulating the legislative and executive branches into being “responsible” by setting <em>their</em> expectations is any part of the Fed’s mandate. Talk about a nanny state.</p>
<p>But that aside: this is exactly what the Fed <em>is</em> doing, and has done for thirty years with its inflation-fighting moxie — (promising to) “protect the economy against [so-called] reckless fiscal policy” by reining in inflation (and wage and employment growth). It’s called The Great Moderation. (So by Ryan’s reasoning, the Fed has spent three decades encouraging “reckless fiscal policy.”)</p>
<p>Ryan thinks that the Fed’s afraid that it:</p>
<blockquote><p>…will need to roll out dramatic, unconventional actions—the fear being, of course, that such actions would leave it hopelessly politicised and powerless to fight inflation. … [They&#8217;re] fighting to maintain their vulnerable independence.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Translation: They’re fighting to avoid the MMT-World end game, where the Fed becomes an irrelevant mechanical actor.</p>
<blockquote><p>And one price of that fight may be the need to occasionally allow fiscal policy to matter—as unfortunate Americans may soon learn.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why “unfortunate”? Where did that come from?</p>
<p>Is the prospect unfortunate because runaway inflation will result? You can count our problematic inflation periods from the past century on two fingers. Now count the recessions.</p>
<p>Or is it because higher government debt will be a drag on growth? <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/11/reinhart-and-rogoff-are-confusing-me/">Vague and poorly reasoned concerns based on a few here-and-there sample points </a>nothwithstanding, we’d be well advised to look to our last bout of serious public debt increase: the one that ended in 1947, and was followed by the fastest decades of economic growth in living memory.</p>

                                <p>I hesitate to post this while Nick Rowe is on vacation, because he’s always so generous with his replies and explanations. Here’s hoping he gets back to this.
<p>But he does get me thinking. I’ve spent several days re-reading and pondering his <a href="http://worthwhile.typepad.com/worthwhile_canadian_initi/2012/05/identity-economics.html">Identity Economics</a> post and (his) related others, which post begins [my brackets]:</p>
<blockquote><p>Here are two macroeconomic identities:</p>
<p>1. Y=C+I+G+NX [the National Income Identity]</p>
<p>2. MV=PY [the Identity of Exchange]</p>
<p>Both are true by definition.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Without (for the moment) burdening you with all my thinking, here’s the question that I’m left with:</p>
<p>By convention and practice — “by definition” —  Y in these identities equals real GDP. Y <em>means</em> ”real GDP”.</p>
<p>Here’s why that doesn’t make sense to me:</p>
<p>Say that in Year 1, U.S. GDP (IOW, Y) is $14 trillion. That’s the total dollars spent on real-world, newly-produced goods and services. This quantity is necessarily counted in dollars, because that’s how the measurement is done (at least in the expenditure approach) — adding up all the dollar-denominated purchases/sales.</p>
<p>Assume: in Year 2, the economy produces that same quantity of real goods and services, and their aggregate human utility is unchanged. Real output is unchanged.</p>
<p>But in Year 2, the prices are 10% higher (for whatever reasons). Measured, counted GDP (a.k.a. “Y,” total dollar transactions) increases by 10%.</p>
<p>If Y is real GDP, then real GDP just went up by 10%. Even though real output didn’t.</p>
<p>This doesn’t make any sense to me. Shouldn’t Y mean nominal GDP?</p>
<p>Even: <em>mustn’t it</em>? Because it’s always counted in nominal dollars.</p>
<p>This would give us:</p>
<p>MV = Y</p>
<p>And:</p>
<p>Y/P = Real GDP</p>
<p>This seems much more tractable and conceptually coherent to me. The “real” definition keeps running me into (what seem like) conceptual/arithmetic contradictions.</p>
<p>I was going to stop here, hoping to keep this discussion focused, but as I’m about to post I find that Saturos has given me a very nice <a href="http://worthwhile.typepad.com/worthwhile_canadian_initi/2012/05/identity-economics.html?cid=6a00d83451688169e20168eba28f0b970c#comment-6a00d83451688169e20168eba28f0b970c">response</a> to my <a href="http://worthwhile.typepad.com/worthwhile_canadian_initi/2012/05/identity-economics.html?cid=6a00d83451688169e2016305a3023d970d#comment-6a00d83451688169e2016305a3023d970d">comment</a> over at Nick’s place. The confusion expressed here fully explains the more profound confusion in that earlier comment; I simply assumed therein, based on the fundamental construction of the National Income Identity (and the methods of national accounting), that Y means nominal GDP.</p>
<p>Saturos sez:</p>
<blockquote><p>Talk to any Keynesian and you’ll find that they’re far more inclined to interpret Y = C + I + G + NX as referring to real (CPI or GDP deflator adjusted) quantities. Of course P is here assumed to equal 1, because “prices don’t matter in the short run”. But I agree that it makes far more sense, and is far more consistent with the Keynesian approach, to talk about nominal spending flows. (Really, you should use lowercase for real variables, and uppercase for nominal – and the identity is true in either case, as it’s just a listing of the different categories that any spending or output must fall into.) Matt Yglesias (<a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2012/05/13/fun_with_accounting_identities.html">http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2012/05/13/fun_with_accounting_identities.html</a>) has a new post in which he takes Scott Sumner’s version: MV = C + I + G + NX. That might be the best approach of all – it shows you that all the changes in “income accounting” variables that get reported on the news must all be manifestations of fluctuations in the overall volume of spending, MV. If we’re talking about fiscal policy or “exogenous shocks” to NGDP, then this must be a fluctuation in V (base velocity).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My responses:</p>
<p>1. Are you telling me that <em>economists don’t even agree on what Y means?</em> Not sure if that’s what you’re saying. If so, doesn’t Nick’s “by definition” start this whole discussion (even: the whole discipline of national-accounting-based and monetary economics) on a bed of quicksand?</p>
<p>2. Is it really standard practice to “use lowercase for real variables, and uppercase for nominal”? Seems like a great convention. Do economists adhere to this convention consistently? They don’t seem to. (If Y equals real GDP, shouldn’t it always be lowercase?) Nick uses uppercase throughout in his post, except here in his #3:</p>
<p>If I re-wrote the first identity in nominal terms, as PY=PC+PI+PG+PNX, it might invite the same question. Or if I re-wrote the second identity in real terms, as Y=Vm (where m is the real money stock), I could hide that question.</p>
<p>I presume that m = M/P. So Y = VM/P. This says rather explicitly that Y is real GDP. (So it should be lowercase, no?) So, also: is Nick a Keynesian? Sometimes, sort of…</p>
<p>3. <a href="http://stevebroback.com/2012/dear-matthew-yglesias-yes-econ-is-hard/">Mediocre philosophical minds</a> obviously think alike. Matthew’s (and Scott’s) MV = C + I + G + NX is <em>exactly</em> where I went in my first stab at this post, which I’ve discarded or at least put aside for the moment.</p>
<p>4. I’ve been coming to the same conclusions about NGDP and velocity. Cf. the subtitle to <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/no-saving-does-not-increase-the-supply-of-loanable-funds.html">this</a> post.</p>
<p>I’m going to add one last thought here, to thoroughly muddle the waters: Somebody could presumably argue that price can’t increase by 10% unless the utility derived from produced goods — real output — also increases by 10%. That would resolve the apparent contradiction inherent in the Y = real GDP definition. (At least as that contradiction seems to arise in my example above re: the National Account Identity.) But I can’t really conceive a very convincing empirical and/or theoretical basis for that assertion.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Paul Krugman rightly <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/16/when-good-things-happen-to-bad-ideas/">attacked</a> the confidence fairy again yesterday — claiming that the unemployment of the 80s following Volcker’s tightening proves that Fed credibility doesn’t help — but I think he misfires this time. Here’s what I sed over there, with some tweaks:
<p>To be fair, Paul, isn’t the point here that in 1980 the Fed was decidedly <em>lacking</em> in inflation-fighting credibility? Volcker changed that — as you say, at great cost — and reluctance to lose the resulting credibility has been grounds for not sufficiently addressing the employment side of the Fed’s mandate ever since.</p>
<p>More to the point, though: I am utterly mystified why the Fed thinks that saying it will allow slightly higher inflation (3 or 4 percent), doing so, then presumably bringing it back down, would hurt its inflation-fighting credibility. Quite the contrary.</p>
<p>Unless: they actually believe that they couldn’t pull it off — that a wage-price spiral would ensue, destroying their credibility. Which is the same as saying “if we let things go a little now, allowing more inflation while spurring employment, we may have to allow a lot of unemployment in the future (a la Volcker) to control runaway inflation.”</p>
<p>Given our (their) inability to predict economic futures, and their at-least-perceived decades-long ability to control inflation without big Volcker-style employment hits, this seems like a ridiculous concern.</p>
<p>The more likely explanation in my view: each extra point of inflation would transfer <em>hundreds of billions of dollars</em> of buying power <em>every year</em> from creditors to debtors. Permanently. This isn’t just Econ 101; it’s simple arithmetic.</p>
<p>And the Fed is run by creditors.</p>
<p>This explanation is completely in keeping with the rightie mantra that (only personal financial) incentives matter.</p>
<p>This raises a question I have, especially for (Market) Monetarists:</p>
<p>Suppose two or three years from now inflation is at 4% and employment is strong. Could the Fed bring inflation down by saying they’re going to be less expansive — setting expectations for lower inflation? Or is expectations-setting asymmetrical?</p>
<p>Can the Fed set higher expectations for growth/inflation largely through Open Mouth Operations, while lowering expectations would require (more) actual monetary operations, Volcker-style?</p>
