                                <p>Ashwin Parameswaran <a href="http://www.macroresilience.com/2012/10/17/monetary-and-fiscal-economics-for-a-near-credit-economy/">nails it</a> once again. If you want to understand how the modern financial/monetary system actually works, run don’t walk to read this post.</p>
<p>His key insight:</p>
<blockquote><p>Just as the East India Company could access cash on the back of their government bond holdings in the 18th century, any pension fund, insurer or bank can do the same today.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let me translate that into my words:</p>
<p>If the CB unwinds QE by trading bonds for “money,” “sopping up” “cash” (those are all “so-called” quotes) from the private sector, the private bond-holders can just use those bonds as collateral to get (new) cash loans. Commercial and shadow banks will create (“counterfeit”) the new money under (explicit or implicit) license from the central bank, and deposit the money into the bondholders’ accounts.</p>
<p>Result: roughly the same amount of “cash” in the system.</p>
<p>In other words:</p>
<blockquote><p>…the private sector can monetize the deficit as effectively as the central bank can.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hence:</p>
<blockquote><p>…the reversal of QE, if and when it happens, will have no impact on economy-wide access to cash/purchasing power.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Update, 08:30 PST: </strong>This also serves to explain why QE may not have had as much effect as one might hope. The Fed gave bondholders cash in return for their bonds, so bondholders ended up with more cash but less collaterizable/monetizable/convertible-to-cash bonds. A wash?</p>
<p>Discuss. (But not until you’ve read Ashwin’s whole piece [at least once].)</p>

                                <p>As a many-times business owner, I <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/why-dont-shareholders-control-corporations.html">noted</a> a couple of years back that in the ecosystem of publicly traded companies, there is nobody who thinks, acts, has incentives like, or is really <em>anything like</em> a real business owner.</p>
<p>I’m pleased to find that Adam Smith agrees with me (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote><p>The trade of a joint stock company is always managed by a court of directors. This court, indeed, is frequently subject, in many respects, to the control of a general court of proprietors. But the greater part of those proprietors seldom pretend to understand anything of the business of the company, and when the spirit of faction happens not to prevail among them, give themselves no trouble about it, but receive contentedly such half-yearly or yearly dividend as the directors think proper to make to them. This total exemption from trouble and from risk, beyond a limited sum, encourages many people to become adventurers in joint stock companies, who would, upon no account, hazard their fortunes in any private copartnery. Such companies, therefore, commonly draw to themselves much greater stocks than any private copartnery can boast of. The trading stock of the South Sea Company, at one time, amounted to upwards of thirty-three millions eight hundred thousand pounds.*65 The divided capital of the Bank of England amounts, at present, to ten millions seven hundred and eighty thousand pounds.*66 The directors of such companies, however, being the managers rather of other people’s money than of their own, it cannot well be expected that they should watch over it with the same anxious vigilance with which the partners in a private copartnery frequently watch over their own. Like the stewards of a rich man, they are apt to consider attention to small matters as not for their master’s honour, and very easily give themselves a dispensation from having it. <strong>Negligence and profusion, therefore, must always prevail, more or less, in the management of the affairs of such a company.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This of course speaks to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent_principal_theory">principle-agent</a> conundrum that has been so widely studied and discussed, notably the pathological separation of ownership and control discussed in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Modern_Corporation_and_Private_Property_(book)#cite_note-24">Berle and Means</a>, <em>The Modern Corporation and Private Property</em>. (1932, revised edition 1967.)</p>
<p>But it’s nice to see Adam articulating it so nicely.</p>
<p>Modern corporatism is freakishly removed from, really bears no resemblance to, the fairy tale of “free-market” village butchers and bakers on which libertarians rest so much of their intellectual house of cards. (To quote my daughter’s high-school econ prof: “Econ schools should be teaching a lot more game theory and a lot less price theory.”)</p>
<p>It’s also worth noting that the Koch-brothers shop over at GMU and econlog, from whose “Library of Economics and Liberty” the above passage is copied, has never, in all those bloggers’ years of blogging, even mentioned this passage from their hero.</p>

                                <p>Richard Thaler asks exactly the right question. This from the latest <a href="http://www.igmchicago.org/igm-economic-experts-panel/poll-results?SurveyID=SV_6MzyqvYPzrjhYvb">IGM Forum</a> poll of big-name economists, on the effects of taxing income from “capital.”</p>
<p>I’ve been <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/i-was-wrong-there-is-a-substitute-for-investment-investment.html">over this</a> multiple times before, but it’s nice to see the thinking validated by a real economist. If you’ve got money, there is <em>no</em> (practicable) alternative to “investing” it. (Those are irony quotes: referring to “buying financial assets,” as opposed to “buying/creating real [fixed] assets,” which is the technical meaning of “investing” in national-account-speak.)</p>
<p>Or actually — there is one alternative to “investing” your money: spending it.</p>
<p>Are the neoclassicals really going to argue that if we tax returns on financial assets at a higher rate — so “investors” have <em>less</em> after-tax income — they’re going to spend <em>more</em>? I don’t think I have to cite sources to prove that they consistently argue exactly the opposite.</p>
<p>But just for grins, let’s say they will spend more. That would be great! They’d increase the volume of private money circulation (P*T, or M*V, your choice) — boosting demand for real goods and services, stimulating production, and goosing GDP.</p>
<p>And if we’re lucky, they’ll use it for investment spending instead of consumption spending. They get to write off those real investment expenditures against their taxes, after all. Not true with consumption expenditures, much less purchases of financial assets.</p>
<p>In which case — this seems kind of obvious when you think about it — taxing “investment” income will increase investment (while reducing the federal deficit). What’s not to like?</p>

<blockquote><p>I prefer not to think of all capital as the same.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In particular my pet peeve, the rampant confution of financial “capital” with real capital.</p>

                                <p>An acquaintance of mine who’s <em>very</em> statistically savvy (and quite conservative) posted the following link on Facebook today.</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2217286/Global-warming-stopped-16-years-ago-reveals-Met-Office-report-quietly-released--chart-prove-it.html"><img title="Screen shot 2012-10-15 at 12.04.13 PM" src="http://www.asymptosis.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Screen-shot-2012-10-15-at-12.04.13-PM.png" alt="" width="408" height="123"></a></p>

<p>I replied as follows (I’ve replaced a link here with a clickable image):</p>
<p>As a statistics guy, you know way better than most how important sample size is. There was a 30-year plateau in the HADCRUT data, mid-40s to mid-70s. But the longer-term trend is obvious and apparent:</p>
<p><a href="http://moyhu.blogspot.com/2012/03/interactive-js-climate-plotter.html"><img title="Screen shot 2012-10-15 at 12.08.37 PM" src="http://www.asymptosis.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Screen-shot-2012-10-15-at-12.08.37-PM-480x355.png" alt="" width="480" height="355"></a></p>
<p>(This is one just data set, but you can view and compare many others at this link. They’re remarkably similar. Try the rolling-average smoothing to get a less noisy picture.) For me the really big sample relates to arctic ice. We don’t really know when the summer arctic ice cap was last as small as it is now, but we do know that the last time it melted completely was approximately three million years ago. To me, if that’s just sort of happening due to random climate variation, over mere decades, it’s looking like a quite spectacular statistical anomaly.</p>
<p>I added: if he’s been saying this for years, he’s been basing those statements on even smaller sample sizes.</p>

                                <p>Comes to mind: the one about the two British ladies who meet at the Ascot races.</p>
<p>“My dear,” says the first. “What a lovely <em></em>hat. Where <em>did</em> you get it?”</p>
<p>“Oh darling,” says the second, looking somewhat pained, “don’t you know, we <em>have</em> our hats.”</p>
<p>It comes to mind as I ponder the rather grudging and tepid suggestions that you hear here and there these days — that <strong>excessive inequality might actually be a drag on economic growth and prosperity</strong>. There are some full-throated assertions of this belief out there, but in the mainstream economics community they are rare and in general quite decidedly <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21564556">mealy-mouthed</a>. (No names, just initials: <em>The Economist.</em>)</p>
<p>The general failure to question the “more inequality is good for growth” mantra has deep roots, even among progressive economists. <em>Viz</em>, <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/12/17/do-we-need-the-middle-class/">this</a> from Paul Krugman back in December, 2008, when the <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/robert-livingston-once-again-sheds-serious-light-on-our-current-situation-as-illuminated-by-the-great-depressioncondensed.html">highest inequality since The Great Depression</a> was was in the process of delivering the first (at least potential) depression since…The Great Depression (bold mine):</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>There’s no obvious reason why consumer demand can’t be sustained by the spending of the upper class</strong> — $200 dinners and luxury hotels create jobs, the same way that fast food dinners and Motel 6s do. In fact, the prosperity of New York City in the last decade — largely supported off of super-salaried Wall Street types — is a demonstration that <strong>you can have an economy sustained by the big spending of the few rather than the modest spending of large numbers of people</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This seems to completely ignore marginal propensity to consume (MPC) — that poorer people spend a larger percentage of their income than rich people, so a more equal income distribution would result in higher money velocity, hence higher GDP. (I have seen no indication that Krugman’s opinion on this subject has changed since then.)</p>
<p>But I’d like to suggest that the problem runs deeper. <strong>Almost all the thinking about MPC seems to obsess about income, and greatly downplay the role of wealth, or net worth.</strong> The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_propensity_to_consume">Wikipedia article on MPC</a>, for instance, includes only one passing mention of wealth.</p>
<p>This failure to consider wealth is important because <a href="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2011/03/29/business/economy/economix-29inequality/economix-29inequality-custom2.jpg">wealth</a> <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Screen-shot-2010-10-08-at-4.57.06-AM1.png">inequality</a> in this country (and worldwide) utterly <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/household-net-worth-by-quintile-62-09-be-prepared-to-scroll.html"><em>dwarfs</em></a> <a href="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2011/03/29/business/economy/economix-29inequality/economix-29inequality-custom1.jpg">income</a> <a href="http://motherjones.com/files/images/the-only-tax-graph-that-matters_0.preview.jpg">inequality</a>.</p>
<p>The Friedman/Modigliani rational-expectations lifecycle-hypothesis school does include wealth in their theories of marginal propensity to consume, but they assume that a great deal of people’s “wealth” actually consists of <em>expected</em> future income. This in turn assumes consumers’ excellent foresight decades into the future, and that people (at all income levels) are able or even likely to engage (accurately) in net-present-value calculations of their future incomes and expenditures.</p>
<p>There’s obviously a large literature on this subject that is ridiculously condensed above. But that aside: for thinking purposes I’d like to propose an admittedly simplified, opposite model that I have not seen discussed, in which <strong>current wealth (individual net worth) is the <em>only</em> determinant of (consumption) spending</strong> in a given period.</p>
<p>Imagine a world with eleven people in it, where we all <em>have</em> our wealth, and where net worth is broken out as follows.</p>
<p>Person 1: $1,000,000</p>
<p>Persons 2-11: $100,000 each</p>
<p>All spending comes from these stocks of wealth.</p>
<p>Now assume a very simple consumption function — a two-step “curve” — based on MPC (and marginal utility of consumption) thinking: propensity to consume for those holding more than $500,000 is 3% (because that satisfies their desires), while it’s 5% for those holding less than $500K.</p>
<p>Here’s how spending (Y, or GDP) plays out:</p>
<p>.05 x $100K x 10 = $50,000<br />+ .03 x $1 mil = $30,000<br /><strong>= $80,000</strong></p>
<p>Now change the initial wealth setting: Persons 2-11 have $50,000 each, and Person 1 has $1.5 million.</p>
<p>.05 x $50K x 10 = $25,000<br />+ .03 x $1.5 mil = $45,000<br /><strong>= $70,000</strong></p>
<p>By transferring half of the poorer people’s money to the richer person, we’ve cut GDP by $10,000, or 12.5%.</p>
<p>Then consider the <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/recessions-are-natures-way-of-keeping-the-little-guy-down.html">change in shares of wealth from 2007-2010</a>. Median net worth dropped by 40%, while the net worth of the top 10% went <em>up.</em></p>
<p>Even if you accept the notion that predicted income constitutes a large portion of people’s perceived “wealth,” the implications are the same. If more of the national income (the $80K or $70K in spending) goes to the poorer people, they will have more wealth in future periods, with the salutary effects on GDP and prosperity shown above. (If they expect that distribution to continue, it will even impact their estimates of their own wealth in <em>this</em> period, increasing their current propensity to spend/consume.)</p>
<p>And this doesn’t even consider declining marginal utility of consumption (or only includes it in a display of circular logic) — that somebody with a $25,000 consumption budget gets more utility from a given (percentage or absolute) budget increase than one with a $50,000 consumption budget. So a small percentage shift in shares of wealth from the rich to the poor, or vice versa, results in quite large shifts in shares of our aggregate utility.</p>
<p>A supporting argument from the personal-anecdote-as-the-singular-of-”data” school of rhetoric: all this holds true for me. I put away a very nice chunk some years back, and am playing the fairly typical “will I run out first or die first?” game. (It’s hard to say which is worse. How many people spend their last dollar on the day they die?) I’ve often joked with my financial advisor that I have one Key Economic Indicator: how much money do I have? That’s what I think about when deciding whether to spend. People nearing or in retirement start paying a lot more attention to wealth than income. (Related but tangential: not surprisingly, as the future gets closer and more predictable, as the kids get up on their own feet, for instance, “the <em>marginal propensity to consume</em> (MPC) out of wealth increases with the <em>age</em> of the consumer.” <a href="http://www.frbsf.org/publications/economics/papers/2007/wp07-01.pdf">PDF</a>.) And we have an increasing number of people in or near retirement these days.</p>
<p>If this thinking holds any water — that the distribution/concentration of (perceived) wealth has an important impact on aggregate marginal propensity to consume — there’s a very solid and rather straightforward theoretical basis for the otherwise largely limp-wristed assertions that we’re starting to hear more glimmers of these days in the mainstream media, and in the more influential sectors of the econoblogosphere.</p>
<p><em>Equity and economic efficiency are not in conflict. </em>Quite the contrary, in fact.</p>
<p>For those who prefer to look at pesky things like facts, the empirical data bears this out: at least in prosperous countries, <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/wealth-equality-and-prosperity.html">greater wealth equality correlates with greater long-term prosperity</a>.</p>

<p>I really like this <a href="http://www.igmchicago.org/igm-economic-experts-panel">IGM panel</a> (check out the roster — pretty damned impressive, or at least credentialed), but I wish they didn’t post such wishy-washy, softball questions. I post this one because it’s not.</p>
<p>The one I’d really like them to ask:</p>
<p>A modern, prosperous country taxing 40% of GDP is likely to grow significantly more slowly over the long term than one taxing 30% of GDP.</p>
<p>True or false?</p>

Mason’s <a href="http://jacobinmag.com/2012/09/in-defense-of-david-graebers-debt/">response</a> to what in my opinion is a quite befuddled Mike Beggs <a href="http://jacobinmag.com/2012/08/debt-the-first-500-pages/">review</a> in <em>Jacobin </em>of David Graeber’s <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=GYhajCQU8XIC&#038;printsec=frontcover&#038;dq=graeber+debt&#038;source=bl&#038;ots=A3CWfoHGFS&#038;sig=WY8Jc54swZhd9R6GqmKATbpG8IY&#038;hl=en&#038;sa=X&#038;ei=irtcUKSxCqiXiALdxoCQDA&#038;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&#038;q&#038;f=false"><em>Debt: The First Five Thousand Years</em></a> prompts me to tackle a subject that I’ve been worrying at for a long time: Money. </p>
<p>I’ve been worrying at it despite (or because of) endless reading spanning centuries of money thinkers, reading that has brought me to the conclusion that economists don’t have an even-vaguely coherent or agreed-upon definition of what money is. No: saying that it “serves three purposes” — store of value, means of exchange, and unit of account — does not a definition make. Not even close. In my opinion, that fumbling tripartite stab at something vaguely definition-like actually takes us farther from, and obfuscates, any useful definition.</p>
<p>It’s not uncommon to find leading economists of all stripes — even deep money thinkers like Randall Wray — using vague, quasi-technical terms like “moneyness” and “money-like.” They don’t seem to have a tight technical definition that they can rely upon others to understand and use synonymously. cf., Decades, centuries of inconclusive argument on the proper definition(s) of “the money supply,” and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_supply#Empirical_measures_in_the_United_States_Federal_Reserve_System">various definitions thereof</a>.</p>
<p>What is arguably the most important word in economics remains undefined or at best variously and inconsistently defined — and used.</p>
<p>We find this “money confusion” in the center of J. W.’s response, where he addresses the theoretical (and historical) tangles surrounding commodity, fiat, and credit money — a quagmire he illuminates nicely, but doesn’t manage to untangle. He continues (emphasis mine):<br />
<blockquote>“It is odd,” Mike says, “that Graeber claims that ‘you can no more touch a dollar or a deutschmark than you can touch an hour or a cubic centimeter’ – because there actually are things called dollars you can touch, carry around in your wallet, and spend.” And, “however far credit may stretch money, it still depends on a monetary base: people ultimately expect to get paid in some form or other.” And, most decisively, “What circulates [as money] need not be a physical thing, but it is a thing in the sense that it cannot be in two places at once: when a payment is made, a quantity is deleted from one account and added to another. That the thing that is accepted in payment may be a third party’s liability does not change this fundamental point.” These are all, quite simply, statements of Friedman’s quantity theory of money, refuted by generations of Post Keynesian economists but still carrying on its zombie existence in the textbooks.<br />Open your wallet again: Yes, you see things called dollars, but most likely you also see a piece of pallastic labeled Visa or Mastercard. This is money too — you can buy almost anything with t that you can buy with the bills. When you do so, new monetary liabilities are created on the spot, linking you to your bank and your bank to the vendor. Nothing is deleted from anywhere. You do, of course, have a credit limit, but that depends on what you’re buying an who you are buying it from, and it can rise or fall for all sorts of reasons without changes in anyone else’s. This is the fundamental difference between fiat and commodity money, on the one hand, and credit money on the other. There is a fixed quantity of the former but not of the latter. Now if the maximum volume of credit that could be created by banks was closely linked to their holdings of gold or state tokens, it wouldn’t make a difference; and thanks to various regulatory and other constraints, this was more or less true for much of the 19th and 20th centuries. But it is not true today. <strong>The idea of money as a “thing” that you “carry around” is fundamentally wrong as a description of today’s monetary system.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>This fundamental wrongness (if it is indeed wrong) is inscribed right at the top of the Wikipedia <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money">article</a> on money, and in almost every economist’s understanding of the concept (bold mine):<br />
<blockquote>Money is any <strong>object</strong> or record that is generally accepted as payment  for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goods_and_services" title="Goods and services">goods and services</a> and repayment of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debts" title="Debts">debts</a>…</p></blockquote>
<p>And the Money Supply <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_supply">entry</a> explicitly acknowledges the definitional problem:<br />
<blockquote>There are several ways to define “money,”</p></blockquote>
<p>I don’t think Graeber is completely right in his characterizations of money, Beggs completely doesn’t get it, and Mason doesn’t go go far enough. Despite common usage, that idea of money as a “thing” that you can carry around is not a useful technical economic definition for discussing <em>any</em> monetary system. It doesn’t allow us to think about money or money economies coherently.</p>
<p>Imagine if physicists didn’t have a solid definition of energy — if they meant slightly (or wildly) different things when they referred to it, sometimes hewing to some vernacular usage, sometimes silently assuming various technical definitions. Or if one was never sure which definition they were using in any given discussion. Or if two physicists arguing were frequently using different implicit definitions, and often weren’t even aware of it. Or if they shifted their own (implicit) definitions within the course of a discussion, often even within a single sentence?</p>
<p>Physics discussions would be in the same kind of eternally inconclusive mess that economics is in, and has been in for centuries.</p>
<p>I want to suggest a definition in which a dollar bill is <em>not money</em>. It’s a definition that I’m finding to be conceptually useful, tractable, and applicable to much of the good economic thought that has emerged over the centuries (emerging, amazingly, even in the absence of such a definition). Neither is a gold coin money, and neither is a balance in your checking account. Economists have been unable to disentangle themselves from that common, vernacular usage. What they (we) need is a term of art, a technical term that is clearly defined and uniformly deployed. As with many terms of art, such a definition is likely to bear little or at best only a glancing resemblance to everyday usage.</p>
<p>So if a dollar bill isn’t money, what is it? It’s a <em>financial asset</em>, as are gold coins, bank deposits, bonds, stocks, collateralized debt obligations, and so on and so forth, <em>all of which</em> embody or represent money. Ditto bank reserves. (This last is important because reserves are — for sensible reasons, within the definitional vacuum that economics inhabits — excluded from almost all definitions of the money supply. Nevertheless, they’re financial assets that embody money, in a complicated institutional way. They have very special properties, different from other financial assets.)</p>
<p>So what is money? Let’s take a look at the physics definition of energy, and see if it might be a useful guide. Here from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy">Wikipedia</a> (which at least has the virtue of not being widely disagreed with; otherwise it would be rewritten):<br />
<blockquote>In physics, energy … is an indirectly observed quantity that is often understood as the ability of a physical system to do work on other physical systems.</p></blockquote>
<p>That’s a pretty heady conceptual definition. Does something similar work with money? Try this:</p>
<div>In economics, money is a quantity that is often understood as value that can be exchanged for real-world goods and services.</p>
</div>
<p>Or a simpler version: money is <em>exchange value.</em><br /><em><br /></em>Like energy, under this definition money cannot exist except as manifested in some embodiment — for energy, a gallon of gas, fields/waves/particles propagating through the void, or a boulder at the top of a hill; for money, some financial asset. Absent such an embodiment, energy and money do not even, cannot even, exist. (Though exchange value obviously can.)</p>
<p>Money in this definition does not exist except as it is embodied in financial assets. But that doesn’t mean that financial assets — even dollar bills – <em>are</em> money.</p>
<p>If you’ve got a battery in your pocket, do you say you’re carrying “energy”? You could, but you don’t because you know that you’re carrying a battery that <em>embodies</em> or <em>contains</em> or <em>holds</em> energy. You understand the conceptual distinction between the battery and the energy.</p>
<p>But when you have a dollar bill in your pocket, you <em>do</em> say, “I have money in my pocket.” You don’t make the distinction — that the bill and the money are <em>conceptually different things</em>.</p>
<p>Ditto with bank deposits: they are legally enforceable claims. They’re not “money” (in this definition). And other financial assets: we commonly say “how much money” do you have? What we really mean is “what is the net value of your financial assets?”</p>
<p>Let’s go back to the key word in the physics definition of energy, and in my definition of money: “quantity.” What does <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantity">Wikipedia</a> tell us about that word?<br />
<blockquote><strong>Quantity is a property</strong> that can exist as a magnitude or multitude. Quantities can be compared in terms of “more”, “less” or “equal”, or by assigning a numerical value in terms of a unit of measurement. Quantity is among the basic classes of things along with quality, substance, change, and relation. Being a fundamental term, quantity is used to refer to any type of quantitative properties or attributes of things. Some quantities are such by their inner nature (as number), while others are functioning as states (properties, dimensions, attributes) of things such as heavy and light, long and short, broad and narrow, small and great, or much and little.</p></blockquote>
<p>So by this definition, money is a quantitative property. A property of what? I would say: financial assets. Those assets have other properties as well: exchangeability (in different markets), confidence, volatility, etc. All those properties are mutually interrelated in ways that I will not delve into here, and those other properties all affect the quantitative property — money — that is embodied in all financial assets.<br />It seems to me that economists’ failure to make that conceptual distinction between money and financial assets makes it impossible to discuss the economics of a money-based economy coherently, or understand such an economy properly. They end up talking about things like “the demand for money” and “the market for money” (instead of “the markets for different financial assets”) — which are at best vague and at worst meaningless phrases under this definition — when what they really mean, what they really need to discuss, is shifting preferences/demand for different types of financial assets that have different properties – <em>all</em> of which assets embody “money.” (Also: the forces driving changing substitution preferences among these different asset classes and properties of different asset classes — substitution being the <em>sine qua non</em> of demand curves.)</p>
<p><em>By this definition</em>:
<div><strong>Money is not a store of value.</strong> Financial assets are stores of value, with the value quantity designated in terms of money, which in turn is designated in terms of a particular unit of currency.</div>
<div><strong>Money is not a medium of exchange.</strong> Physical currency is a medium of exchange, as are the legal obligations that we refer to as bank balances. Within the financial industry there are many other units of exchange. Though it’s rare for them to be exchanged directly for real-world goods and services, they can be exchanged for things (bank balances) that can be so exchanged, so it’s quite reasonable to view them as embodying “money.”</div>
<div><strong>Money is not a unit of account.</strong> Currencies are units of account. (“Currencies” in the conceptual rather than physical or particular sense of that term — “the dollar,” not “dollar[ bill]s.”)</div>
<p>I’m proposing a very abstract, term-of-art definition here, one that is far removed from most understandings of “money.” But look at the physics definition of energy, above. Does it have the kind of simple, intuitive clarity that we feel when we say “I’m full of energy today” or “I have money in my pocket”? Not even close. The definition is actually quite hard to understand. Nevertheless, it seems to have served its purpose very well over the centuries.</p>
<p>I have a lot more I’d like to say on this subject — for instance on the egregiously sloppy and criminally vague usages of the term “capital” throughout economics writing — but I want to stop here and see if my gentle readers find any value in this thinking, whether they can contribute to my muddled and ever-groping understanding of how (money) economies work.

<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Everything he cites here is about U.S. tax and growth rates — a single sample point though a long-term one — all of which is subject to the big secular thing: growth was faster pre-Reagan, and Dems were in power pre-Reagan, so the numbers just represent that secular decline (the great innovation stagnation?), not the effect of policies. It’s amazing that Republicans never make this argument, which is pretty tough to counter. But that’s mainly because they don’t even know, much less acknowledge, that growth has declined since Reagan took office. This argument ignores the boom and surplus under Clinton, of course (of course that boom was attributable to New Gingrich), but <em>besides that</em> it’s a tough argument to disprove.</p>
<p>The far more convincing demonstration, in my opinion, is <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/u-s-versus-europe-whos-winning-now.html">this</a>: comparing the U.S. to Europe over forty years.</p>
<p>Roughly the same population.</p>
<p>Roughly the same level of prosperity.</p>
<p>One taxing 40% of GDP, the other taxing <30%.</p>
<p>Difference in growth rates: nonexistent.</p>

First, <strong>how pragmatic a man John Maynard Keynes was</strong>. And second, <strong>how utopian the ideals of Friedrich Hayek are</strong>. This is odd, as each man attached himself to a polar opposite political philosophy: Keynes’s ideas were adopted by idealistic lefties, while Hayek’s thoughts were lapped up by conservatism, a philosophy that by definition rejects dogma. <strong>It is as if we have gone through the looking glass.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Who could have said such a thing?!</p>

<p>More:</p>
<blockquote><p>Hayek was concerned with principles, not with the political reality of implementing them. It is noteworthy, too, that Hayek—unlike Keynes—spent most of his life as an academic. Hayek never campaigned for a political party or advised the government of the day. He had little time for men who did not share his view.</p>
<p><strong>This is the antithesis of the conservative tradition. </strong>From Disraeli to Oakeshott, conservatism has been defined for its distrust of ideology, and a preference for pragmatism, compromise and what has gone before.</p>
