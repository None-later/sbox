                                <p>I’ve long been troubled by a <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/12/17/do-we-need-the-middle-class/">Paul Krugman comment</a> from 2008:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>There’s no obvious reason why consumer demand can’t be sustained by the spending of the upper class</strong> — $200 dinners and luxury hotels create jobs, the same way that fast food dinners and Motel 6s do.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And I find in his <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2013/01/rough-transcript-stimulus-or-stymied-the-macroeconomics-of-recessions.html">concluding comment from his recent AEA session</a> that he remains completely uncertain on the issue:</p>
<blockquote><p>…we do not know how rising inequality interacts. There are more poor people who are liquidity constrained but they have less spending power, so we are not sure how it goes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m kind of astounded by this thinking, and even more by his apparent lack of curiosity about the issue. It strikes me as being absolutely central to any discussion of public policy. (<em>Viz</em>: all the talk about a strong middle class vs. trickle-down.)</p>
<p>I’ve poked at this question a couple of times:</p>
<p>In my model <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/modeling-the-wealth-income-and-saving-effects-of-redistribution-more-is-better.html">here</a> and <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/wealth-and-redistribution-revisited-does-enriching-the-rich-actually-make-us-all-richer.html">here</a> looking at how (re)distribution of wealth affects demand, hence production, and</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/the-luddite-fallacy-fallacy.html">discussions</a> of imaginary ultra-high-productivity worlds in which a single person could own an atomic fabrication machine that produces everything that everyone needs (and hence receives all the income from that production).</p>
<p>Paul has clearly been <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/26/capital-biased-technological-progress-an-example-wonkish/">shifting his thinking</a> to encompass the possibility of a post-Luddite-Fallacy world. I wonder if his thinking has also developed on the related issues of inequality and distribution, and their effect on demand.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Steve Randy Waldman as usual <a href="http://www.interfluidity.com/v2/3630.html#comment-28383">gets practical</a> about Treasury issuing platinum coins. JKH in comments there does typically likewise.</p>
<p>Suppose the Department of the Treasury says:</p>
<p>“We have a statutory obligation to pay all amounts that have been authorized by Congress — both expenditure and debt obligations. Since the borrowing limit has been reached and Congress won’t let us sell bonds to make the payments they’ve authorized, we are now issuing physical currency, in the form of platinum coins, to meet those obligations. We are required to do this by statute.”</p>
<p>Let’s say the coins are worth $1 million each.</p>
<p>Treasury would have to issue about $100 billion in coins per month, which is about what it currently issues in bonds. The coins would be effectively the same as zero-interest, perpetual bonds.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter conceptually whether Treasury deposits that currency at their bank (the Fed) then pay bills normally using checks and wire transfers, or issues the coins to payees. Payees will deposit them at their banks, banks will deposit them in their accounts at the Fed, and the result is the same. The Fed has a bunch of platinum coins in its vault, and the government has met its obligations.</p>
<p>Ditto if Treasury sells the coins to primary dealers/banks/sovereign-wealth funds:</p>
<p>1. A transfer of Fed reserves/deposits from dealers/bankers to Treasury. Treasury has money to  spend.</p>
<p>2. Dealers/bankers deposit their coins at the Fed.</p>
<p>3. The Fed issues reserves to dealers/bankers in return.</p>
<p><strong>But:</strong> Suppose the Fed starts feeling inflation looming. So it sells bonds and receives bank deposits (reserves) in return, to sop up excess money/reserves. This is called “sterilizing” the platinum money creation. (We’ll ignore for the moment the fact that the sold bonds may/will just get repoed in the private market in return for cash.)</p>
<p>But the Fed’s only got about $3 trillion in bonds to sell. What happens when it runs out? Can it still control inflation?</p>
<p>(At that point, monetary policy is effectively managed by congress’s taxing and spending decisions. Budget deficit = easing. Budget surplus = tightening. That is not a promising prospect.)</p>
<p>The Fed could start selling its platinum coins, draining reserves/”money” out of the system. (Assuming those coins aren’t used for exchange, but are held in vaults just like other “reserves”/stores of value.)</p>
<p>But why would dealers buy them?</p>
<p>The answer seems to be negative interest on reserves (IOR). If the Fed charged .25% (or whatever) to hold banks’ money for them (negative quarter point of interest), banks/dealers/sovereign-wealth funds would have an incentive to trade those reserves for platinum coins (at 0% interest) to hold in their vaults.</p>
<p>Would (negative) IOR be a sufficiently effective monetary instrument for the Fed to manage monetary policy? Other implications?</p>

                                <p>With all the well-deserved attention going to Kevin Drum’s excellent <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2013/01/lead-crime-link-gasoline">Mother Jones article on crime rates and lead in gasoline</a> (more <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2013/01/lead-and-crime-correction">here</a>), I thought it worth revisiting my post on the subject from a year and a half ago, which was itself prompted by Angry Bear’s own inimitable <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/05/get-lead-out-ii.html">Robert Waldmann</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/government-gets-the-lead-out-crime-plummets.html">Government Gets the Lead Out, Crime Plummets</a></p>
<p>In which I said:</p>
<blockquote><p>We’re seeing it in spades: the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetraethyllead#History">history of tetraethyl lead</a> (read it and weep) is a tragic textbook case of market/profit interests eviscerating the commons and making us all (including the rich) far worse off, in the name of “the invisible hand” making us all better off.</p>
<p>That ebil gubmint man with his heavy-handed regulations impinging on honest businesspeople (who are just trying to make a buck, for everyone’s benefit) sure did have a pernicious effect, huh?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I can only imagine how many <em>trillions</em> of dollars that lead-driven crime wave has cost our country, and how many tens of millions of lives that lead poisoning has destroyed.</p>
<p>But don’t worry: you can rely on profit-making companies to “allocate our resources most efficiently.” Trust me on this.</p>

<blockquote><p>“cutting unemployment insurance would increase employment, as it would end payments for people who fail to find work and would reduce the cushion provided after layoffs.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w18668">Here’s one</a> pretty well-done data point (several, actually) suggesting that he’s wrong:</p>
<blockquote><p>In theory, greater employment protection should dampen the effects of output movements on employment and therefore reduce the Okun coefficient. In Figure 10 (right panel), we test this idea by plotting the coefficient against the OECD’s overall EPL index (averaged over 1985-2008, the period for which it is available). The relationship has the wrong sign, and it is statistically insignificant.[9]</p>
<p>[9] For New Zealand, the EPL index is available over 1990-2008. We also find no relationship between the Okun coefficient and the various components of the EPL index.</p>

                                <p>David Atkins <a href="http://digbysblog.blogspot.com/2013/01/no-matter-what-obama-does-republicans.html">succinctly nails</a> the situation we face:<br />
<blockquote>No matter what Obama does, Republicans won’t care and won’t fold<br />…This is what makes the <strong>poker analogy</strong> so often used to criticize the President’s negotiating tactics <strong>such a weak metaphor</strong>. Obama is often said to be the worst poker player in history, consistently bluffing then folding. But the problem with that analogy is that <strong>Republican House members aren’t playing with their own chips: they’re playing with the country’s. The Republican electoral chips are stashed safely in gerrymandered hands</strong>, and any losses over fiscal cliffs or debt ceilings only hurt the President and the nation’s perception of government. <strong>There’s no downside for the GOP in bluffing every time in the hopes that the President will fold. Why not? When you’re playing with house money, it makes sense to go all in on every hand.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>When you’re playing chicken and your opponent has thrown their steering wheel out the window, the only alternative to losing is  to do likewise. Obama is justifiably reluctant to do so, because he actually cares about America and the rest of the world, and is unwilling to destroy them for electoral advantage.<br />For the gritty details of Republican gerrymandering and Democratic-voter disenfranchisement, see Sam Wang <a href="http://election.princeton.edu/2012/12/30/gerrymanders-part-1-busting-the-both-sides-do-it-myth/">here</a> and <a href="http://election.princeton.edu/2013/01/02/gerrymanders-part-2-how-many-voters-were-disenfranchised/">here</a>.</p>
<p>The Republicans have gerrymandered a structural advantage that lets them play poker using other people’s chips. So the only only real solutions are structural and long-term. <a href="http://digbysblog.blogspot.com/2013/01/a-nihilist-ideological-cult-that-cannot.html">Atkins again</a>:</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<blockquote><p>The advantage Democrats have in this situation is that majority public opinion and the majority of actual American voters are on their side. The only thing that allows Republicans to take their hostages in the first place is a series of arcane rules that give the minority undue influence. Among those rules are:
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Gerrymandered Congressional districts</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Dysfunctional filibuster rules</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Disproportionate Senate representation</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Corrupt lobbying laws</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Campaign finance laws that give outsized political influence to a few billionaires</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Archaic electoral college rules</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Discriminatory workday elections</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>And that’s just a start. <strong>If we want a future in which we do more than simply determine which hostages to save and which ones to shoot</strong>, the American People will need to figure out how to make these and other reforms to our broken political system that disempowers rational majorities in favor of extremist ideological minorities with nothing to lose. As the Republicans continue to suffer demographic decline, their base will only become <a href="http://digbysblog.blogspot.com/2012/02/this-is-what-terrifies-conservatives-by.html">more desperate and extreme</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>They’re cornered, with their backs against the seawall, and <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/03/note-to-pubs-demographic-tidal-wave-is.html">a demographic tidal wave is looming over them</a>. That makes them very, very dangerous.<br /><em>Cross-posted at <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/?p=6576">Asymptosis</a>.</em></p>

                                <p>The other day I looked at <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/guns-murders-and-the-rule-of-law-running-the-numbers.html">number of guns versus number of gun deaths by country</a>, in countries like ours that have pretty good rule of law. The correlation is pretty clear: more guns, more gun deaths.<br />But I was also wondering about correlation within the U.S., by state. I’m pleased to find that Sam Wang’s <a href="http://election.princeton.edu/2012/12/22/scientific-americans-gun-error/">got it</a>:<br /><a href="http://election.princeton.edu/2012/12/22/scientific-americans-gun-error/"><img alt="Scientific American’s gun error" height="393" src="http://www.asymptosis.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/gun_ownership_deaths_500px.jpg" width="500"></a><br />I’d say that great minds think alike, but really: Sam — a professor at Princeton — has got it <em>all</em> over me when it comes to drawing valid conclusions from statistical data.* For instance: like Nate Silver, he called <em>every state</em> correctly in the recent presidential election. But his stated confidence level was way above Nate’s — between a 99.2 and 100% chance that Obama would be re-elected. That’s putting your reputation where your predictions are.<br />Read Sam’s <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/guns-murders-and-the-rule-of-law-running-the-numbers.html">post</a> and the one preceding it. He makes all sorts of sense. He also gives us the sources, so I thought I’d show the data a couple of other ways. How about…red states vs blue states? Here you go:</p>

Here it is on a map:<br /><a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Screen-shot-2012-12-24-at-6.35.25-AM.png"><img alt="Screen shot 2012-12-24 at 6.35.25 AM" height="257" src="http://www.asymptosis.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Screen-shot-2012-12-24-at-6.35.25-AM.png" width="472"></a><br />Though I find that Richard Florida has <a href="http://www.theatlanticcities.com/neighborhoods/2012/07/geography-gun-violence/2655/">beat me to it</a> on this one:<br /><a href="http://www.theatlanticcities.com/neighborhoods/2012/07/geography-gun-violence/2655/"><img alt="" height="308" src="http://cdn.theatlanticcities.com/img/upload/2012/07/20/GunDeaths.jpg" width="400"></a><br />You can quibble all you want about correlation and causation, but the simple fact is: if you live in a red state <em>the odds of your children dying of gun violence is 75% higher</em> than if you live in a blue state.<br />That may help explain why, when Americans vote with their feet and choose where to live, only 38% vote for red states.<br />It may also help explain why people in red states want guns so much: it’s <em>dangerous</em> to live in a red state. They’ve got all those guns.<br />I’m still asking: would you rather “feel” safe, or would you rather be safe?<br />* “<strong>Prof. Sam Wang</strong>‘s academic specialties are biophysics and neuroscience.

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>When I was eighteen years old, I went down to the government office in Olympia, Washington with my friend Steve (no, not that Steve) and signed as the character witness on his application for a concealed carry permit for his handgun. I was probably stoned at the time; I often was back then. (FYI, I grew up with guns in my house — stored in the gun locker up in the attic, but we took them out and shot targets now and then, cleaned them, took care of them. I went hunting several times as a kid.)</p>
<p>Steve and I are still buds, and he still carries. He even stays at my place sometimes when he’s working up here in Seattle, but he leaves the heat in his car. I guess he doesn’t feel the need to scare off the dangerous girl gangs that are forever threatening to invade my houseboat and have their way with us. (Yeah: wildest dreams.)</p>
<p>You won’t be surprised to hear that Steve and I have been going at it on Facebook since the Newtown horror (cordially, if you can believe that). I point to the numbers — less guns, less murders — and he points to countries like Mexico, which have gun control laws but still have high levels of gun homicide. I point out: those countries don’t have strong rule of law; corruption and criminal intimidation is rampant in the police, the judiciary, and the legislatures.</p>
<p>Those countries’ problem is not that they don’t (try to) control guns. It’s that they <em>can’t</em> control guns.</p>
<p>Curious as always, this led me to wonder: in countries like ours that do have a strong, well-institutionalized rule of law — countries that can control guns if they choose to — do less guns mean less gun killings?</p>
<p>Short answer, Yes:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/firearms-3.png"><img alt="firearms 3" src="http://www.asymptosis.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/firearms-3.png" width="575" height="393"></a></p>
<p>CL is Chile. MK is Macedonia. FI is Finland. You know what US stands for.</p>
<p>The WJP index looked like a good measure among those I found on the web; you can choose others if you wish. I used .55 as the cutoff because it’s the line above which all European countries are included, and the resulting list seemed to consist of countries that (at least in aggregate) are fairly comparable to ours. Here’s the list:</p>
<p>Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Chile, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Japan, Jordan, Macedonia, Malaysia, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Singapore, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, United Kingdom, United States, Uruguay.</p>
<p>The firearms and homicide data is from the <a href="http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/data-and-analysis/statistics/data.html">United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime</a>, but it’s laid out in a conveniently sortable table with a linked Google spreadsheet at this <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2012/jul/22/gun-homicides-ownership-world-list">Guardian page</a>.</p>
<p>Steve also pointed me toward a blog that includes, among other things, a time-series analysis of gun violence and gun restrictions in the UK. I’ll simply say: if you live in the U.S. instead of the U.K., you are 43 times as likely to die of a gunshot.</p>
<p>So are your children.</p>

                                <p>In a recent post I built a model with one rich person and ten poorer people to ask: <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/modeling-the-wealth-income-and-saving-effects-of-redistribution-more-is-better.html">does redistribution from rich to poor make us all more wealthy</a>? The conclusion was Yes. Jump back there to see a quick rundown of the model’s assumptions.</p>
<p>Michael Sankowski at <a href="http://monetaryrealism.com/">Monetary Realism</a> put the model through its paces, and provide feedback by email. He pointed out one very interesting thing: total wealth accumulation in the model increases (faster) with redistribution <em>in both directions</em> — from rich to poor <em>and</em> poor to rich.</p>
<p>(Note that redistribution could take infinite forms — traditional welfare, education and health-care spending, tax preferences for rich people’s investment income, corporate subsidies, etc. This is <em>systemic</em> redistribution we’re talking about here. Like this model, the system just does it.)</p>
<p>Here’s what that looks like, with starting wealth of $2 million, divided 50/50 between the rich person and the ten poorer people. (click for larger):</p>
<p><a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/wealth-redistribution.png"><img alt="wealth redistribution" src="http://www.asymptosis.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/wealth-redistribution.png" width="600" height="410"></a></p>
<p>(Since income in this model is based on spending from wealth, the income curves look similar to these wealth curves.)</p>
<p>It sure looks like giving more money to rich people <em>does</em> make the pie bigger — just not as fast or as much as giving more money to poorer people.</p>
<p> <a name="more"></a>
<p>Since the model is based on the idea that poorer people spend more of their wealth each year, so giving them more money increases money velocity hence GDP and eventually wealth, this seems weird. But here’s the explanation: there’s a zero lower bound on poor people’s spending. It can only decrease so far, and so fast. Rich people’s spending can keep increasing with no constraints.</p>
<p>So as you transfer more wealth from poor to rich, the poorer people’s spending doesn’t decline as fast as the rich person’s spending increases — even though the poorer people spend a far larger proportion of their wealth than the rich (here, 80% vs. 30%). The zero-bound effect overwhelms the velocity effect.</p>
<p>Except. There’s a flaw in the model: as I’ve said, it assumes no behavioral responses — only that production (and the surplus from production) are driven by spending, with that whole process relegated to a black box. More spending yields more production and more surplus, with those received as income proportionally to each person’s spending. And spending is based on wealth.</p>
<p>But at the left side of the curve, where the rich person starts getting all the income, doing all the spending, and holding all the wealth, the poorer people <em>have no incentive to work</em>. (Their time is much better spent storming the castle with torches and pitchforks.)</p>
<p>If the poorer people have no incentive to work, there are no goods for the rich person to buy. Spending, income, and wealth would all go negative. So you would inevitably expect the left end of the income and wealth curves (like the peasants) to bend over and di(v)e eventually.</p>
<p>But for quite a ways along the left side of the graph, we’re not at that point. People have plenty of incentive, actually increasing incentive, until they actually are starving: <em>they need to keep their families from starving,</em> get health care for their kids, keep a house over their heads.<em> </em>So the bulk of the graph does yield lessons.</p>
<p>Here’s the most interesting one, to me: <em>the smallest wealth accumulation in this model occurs at the point that maintains the status-quo wealth distribution</em>. (Where there’s a 1.4% annual wealth transfer from poor to rich.) Everybody stays the same relative to each other, and the pie does get bigger (there’s a 5% surplus every year!). But it ends up being a smaller pie than with any other redistribution scheme.</p>
<p>Another lesson here: trickle-down actually works! <em>Compared to zero redistribution</em>, transferring 1.4-4% of poorer people’s wealth to the rich person results in everyone getting wealthier (again, compared to no redistribution), including the poorer people. Move to the left of that, though, and the poorer people get poorer while the the rich person gets richer.</p>
<p>And everyone, poor and rich alike, gets wealthier <em>faster</em><em> </em>if you redistribute in the other direction — from rich to poor. Compare:</p>
<table width="353" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<colgroup>
<col width="104">
<col width="107">
<col width="78">
<col width="64"></colgroup>

<td align="right">$1.8</td>
<td align="right">$1.7</td>
<td align="right">$3.5</td>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>Remember that this model assumes no inflation, so in the top line the rich person’s real wealth is unchanged.</p>
<p>Note that these redistribution percentages are just illustrative. They’re nothing like policy proposals. The turning points and break points all depend on what parameters you plug into the model. But the shape of the curve, and the concepts that emerge, remain unchanged.</p>
<p>Finally, note this: If we redistribute enough (rich to poor) to actually <em>reduce</em> rich people’s dollar wealth, the pie gets much bigger, much faster.</p>
<p>And if you add the notion of declining marginal utility of spending and consumption, the aggregate utility pie gets even bigger, even faster.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Two articles in <em>The New York Times</em> today got me thinking about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons">the tragedy of the commons</a>. This is not new thinking, but it’s not widespread enough, in my opinion. And, I hope this expresses it in a somewhat new way.</p>
<p>One of the articles talks about <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/10/opinion/teaming-up-to-make-new-antibiotics.html?_r=0">the ongoing failure of pharmaceutical companies to develop new antibiotics</a> to replace the increasingly ineffective drugs in our collective arsenal. The second describes a newly developed <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/10/health/a-breakthrough-against-leukemia-using-altered-t-cells.html">T-cell treatment for leukemia</a> that really has to be described as a miracle treatment (at least in some cases).</p>
<p>Both made me realize what’s wrong with the standard Tragedy of the Commons thought-experiment, at least as it is commonly deployed by less-thoughtful libertarians.</p>
<p>In its standard form: many sheep farmers share a common pasture. Each has every incentive to add more sheep, so inevitably, the commons is consumed and destroyed.</p>
<p>The standard (at least libertarian) solution is to privatize the commons — split it up among the farmers and give them each property rights on their share. They’ll each have incentive to use and maintain the land judiciously.</p>
<p>But like most (all?) economic thought experiments, this one rests on an assumption: that the amount of land — the quantity of commons — is fixed.</p>
<p>And that ignores a crucial reality of the larger economic world: we — individually and collectively — are constantly <em>creating</em> the commons<em>. </em>If there are no roads on which the farmers can get their wool to market, they have no incentive to produce that wool. (And no: they “didn’t build” those roads.) Some complement of common goods is necessary for the private incentives to emerge and be maximized.</p>
<p>This points to the other tragedy: none of those individual farmers has the incentive to build roads — to create the commons — unless they’re guaranteed to profit (at least semi-)exclusively from those roads. So the commons doesn’t get built.</p>
<p>I think everyone would agree that we’d all be better off (more well-being, more “prosperity”) if anyone could produce and sell the (nonexistent) new antibiotics, and offer the T-cell therapy — if those things were part of the “commons” the way Newton’s Laws, the germ theory of disease, and word-processing are. But: The antibiotics article explains in simple supply/demand/profit terms why the institutions called “drug companies” don’t have an incentive to create new, tightly targeted antibiotics (so the people who work for them don’t either). The T-cell article explains why their current business model doesn’t work when developing cures that can’t be produced in mass quantities in factories — so, no incentive.</p>
<p>So not only are these things not part of the commons, they aren’t even created (or not as prolifically as we would like). The market doesn’t provide the proper incentives.</p>
<p>Libertarians seem to be woefully blind to this tragedy.</p>
<p>My friend Steve is constantly <a href="http://stevebroback.com/2011/incentives-not-motives-or-why-i-sympathize-with-those-who-might-discriminate-against-me/">saying</a> “it’s about incentives, not motives.”* But this ignores the fact that we can <em>agree collectively</em> on virtuous motives and goals that make us all better off. (And we do so — really have no choice but to do so — and have for millenia.) We can collectively create, empower, and fund institutions in which people are <em>individually</em> incentivized to adopt those motives, and seek those goals. (And we do so, and we have for millenia.) Few people will spend decades of their lives creating new life-saving therapies absent institutions that pay them to do so. (Financial incentives matter!) And we’ve already seen that the private market doesn’t “naturally” or necessarily result in the creation of such institutions. If it did, we’d have new antibiotics coming online in spades. We don’t. There is, however, a wide variety of Gangnam Style t-shirts available.</p>
<p>The two NYT articles point to several ways (which I will leave to your delectation) in which we overcome this inherent, inevitable market failure and collectively fund things like new antibiotics and T-cell therapies. Some of the impetus comes from private charities. Some from government funding. Both are driven by “motives” — to develope life-saving cures — not individual financial incentives. (Though the institutions do provide financial incentives to individuals to adopt the goals that those motives imply.) Both often seek to harness and realign market incentives to implement their motives and achieve their goals.</p>
<p>Yes, in many cases government “picks [potential] winners.” Think: NIH funding grants. (And one hopes that entities such as the NIH do some “central planning” before throwing grants around.)</p>
<p>Returning to the thrust of this post: you might say that those new discoveries end up being offered by private entities, for a price — and individuals are free to choose among the available offerings. They’re not part of “the commons.” But that ignores another reality: the set of available choices is itself part of the commons. Absent the original government funding, many valuable choices would not be available. (Like, for instance, the option of shipping your goods to market via the interstate highway system.)</p>
<p>This reality is revealed if you read the literature on utility, choices, and preferences. While much of that literature concentrates on preferences among available choices and the ordinal utility ranking of those preferences,** those who have thought carefully on the subject (mainstream economists, by the way) have pointed out that different sets of choices <em>themselves</em> have different amounts of utility. We decide collectively what choices will be available, <em>even if our decision is not to decide</em> — to leave the decision to “the market.” But that’s all a subject for another post.</p>
<p>Steven Pinker and E. O. Wilson — two of the most profound and scientifically-based thinkers we’ve got on the subject of human nature and the human condition — bring this point home. Pinker has said on numerous occasions that three primary things set humans apart from other animals: tool use, language, and non-kin altruism. Those are the things that got us not only to the top of the food chain, but to a position of complete speci-al hegemony.</p>
<p>Wilson takes it further (see: <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=Sr44okuve8MC&#038;printsec=frontcover&#038;dq=social+conquest+of+earth&#038;hl=en&#038;sa=X&#038;ei=uTzGUOq6CKjGiwLQm4DoCA&#038;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAA"><em>The Social Conquest of Earth</em></a>). Group selection based on collective altruism, or “eusociality” — our singular ability to agree on future collective plans, and implement those plans even in opposition to apparent short-term individual incentives — is the very thing that’s gotten us where we are.</p>
<p>Together — by acting on motives instead of just individual (financial) incentives — over the millenia we’ve created a very, very big commons that we all “profit” from in multitudinous ways. If we’re smart, we can continue to build it, rather than watching it waste away through our short-sighted individual (in)actions.</p>
<p>* By this he generally seems to mean financial incentives (though he’s not consistent on this), which — when’s that is his meaning — completely ignores a huge panoply of incredibly powerful human incentives, many of them coalescing around various valences of “pride.”</p>
<p>** The bulk of this discussion, in my opinion, constitutes a centuries-long self-serving circle-jerk by economists (yes, the intellectually masturbatory and show-off motives are significant), with a primary but largely unconscious goal of defending, preserving, and increasing the wealth of incumbent wealth holders like themselves.</p>
