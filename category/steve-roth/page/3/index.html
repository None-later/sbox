<p>U Chicago, my daughter’s college, sends me interesting emails now and then, undoubtedly in hopes that I’ll give them money. The latest had this interesting link to an interview with one of their favored sons:</p>

                                <p>Following up on my <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/the-fed-credibility-argument.html">last post</a>, I actually think that there are two possible explanations for the “Fed Credibility” argument’s wide deployment, both hinted at in Simon’s <a href="http://mainlymacro.blogspot.com/2012/12/how-to-try-and-get-more-inflation.html?showComment=1354610368299#c770299358255238094">response to my comment</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think <strong>the credibility argument is really about the underlying motives of the policymakers</strong>, rather than their abilities. However <strong>I also think that argument is overdone – it takes a few generations to forget the lessons of the past, and policymakers are still obsessed with the 1970s</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In my words, two possibilites:</p>
<p><strong>1. It’s a smokescreen.</strong> Actual reason: Creditors <em>hate</em> (unexpected) inflation. One extra percentage point transfers <em>hundreds of billions of dollars</em> of buying power from creditors to debtors, annually. ‘Nuf to get a fellow’s attention. The Fed is run by creditors.</p>
<p><strong>2. (70s) They actually are worried</strong> — that the higher inflation target <em>won’t work</em> in goosing the economy or employment, so they’ll run into a stagflation situation where stomping on (spiraling?) inflation is…problematic. So they won’t be able to fulfill the second half of their promise without causing a job recession a la Volcker. Rock and a hard place.</p>

                                <p>For once a short post, inspired by <a href="http://mainlymacro.blogspot.com/2012/12/how-to-try-and-get-more-inflation.html">Simon Wren’s suggestion</a> that the Fed should allow (encourage) a temporary rise in wage inflation. (The merits of such a policy being obvious to many of us given the current virtues of some extra inflation, and past decades’ wage trends.)</p>
<p>I’ve never understood the credibility danger of the Fed announcing and executing a temporary increase in the inflation target.</p>
<p>If the Fed said “we’re going to let (wage) inflation float a bit higher until the economy’s moving strongly back up toward capacity, then we’ll bring it back down,” and then did exactly that, wouldn’t that greatly <em>enhance</em> its reputation for being able to control inflation?</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/01/business/online-retailers-rush-to-adjust-prices-in-real-time.html">Today’s New York Times article on rapid online repricing by holiday retailers</a> depicts a retail world starting to approach the “flash-trading” status of financial markets:</p>
<blockquote><p>Amazon dropped its price on the game, Dance Central 3, to $24.99 on Thanksgiving Day, matching Best Buy’s “doorbuster” special, and went to $15 once Walmart stores offered the game at that lower price. Amazon then brought the price up, down, down again, up and up again — in all, seven price changes in seven days.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And:</p>
<blockquote><p>The parrying could be seen with a Nintendo game, Mario Kart DS.</p>
<p>A week before Thanksgiving, the retailers’ prices varied, with Amazon selling it at $29.17, Walmart at $40.88, and Target at $33.99, according to Dynamite Data. Through Thanksgiving, as Target kept the price stable, Walmart changed prices six times, and Amazon five. On Thanksgiving itself, Walmart marked down the price to its advertised $29.96, which Amazon matched.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This made me think about a <a href="http://www.multiplier-effect.org/?p=4798">Greg Hannsgen post</a> from last May on the Levy Economics Institute’s Multiplier Effect blog, a post I’ve been meaning to write about. It looks at the pricing mechanism based on how fast prices change/adjust.</p>
<p>The especially interesting thing about this post: It uses a dynamic simulation model to display the effects of slower and faster price adjustments, and lets you run the model yourself, right on the page, by moving a slider to change the speed of price adjustment and watch the results. (You need to install a browser plug-in from Wolfram, which only worked for me in Firefox under Mac OS X 10.6.8; it failed in Chrome.)</p>
<p>The gist:</p>
<blockquote><p>You wonder what will happen when markets finally start working. How about, for example, a market that changes prices and wages quickly in response to fluctuations in demand? …</p>
<p>The pathway shown in the figure just below is followed by public production, capacity utilization, and the markup.</p>
<p>As you move the lever to the right, you are increasing a parameter that controls the speed at which the markup changes in response to high or low levels of customer demand.</p>

<blockquote><p>What happens as the speed parameter is increased is that the economy’s pathway gradually changes until there is a relatively sudden vertical jump in the middle and much higher markup levels at the end—which means a bigger total rise in capital’s share.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then:</p>
<blockquote><p>The next pathway is the one followed by a second group of three variables during the same simulation. This second group includes: money, the government deficit (surpluses are negative numbers in this figure), and the employment rate (total work hours divided by total hours supplied).</p>

<blockquote><p>when the lever is all the way to the right, the pathway begins with an outward spiral, leading to a new inward spiral, and finally an employment “crash” of sorts that occurs as the center of the second spiral is reached. This occurs after the markup has reached very high levels, as seen in the earlier diagram.</p>

<p>That’s a pretty amazing set of conclusions that I don’t think could ever have emerged from mainstream economic modeling techniques. You’ll notice that equilibrium, in particular, is a decidedly problematic concept here. It only seems to emerge when things have gone off the rails and hit the edge of the known world — not in those comfortable middle grounds so fondly envisioned by mainstream models.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a>
<p>I am making no claims of validity for this model’s assumptions, techniques, or conclusions (though I find the conclusions fascinating and plausible) — that’s beyond me. What I want to talk about is the validity of this <em>class</em> or <em>type</em> of dynamic simulation model compared to those commonly employed in “textbook” economic analysis.</p>
<p>In particular it makes me think about some recent posts and comments by Nick Rowe that are (bless him) teaching posts at least partially in response to my constantly demonstrated inability to properly grasp those standard approaches. (No: I’m not being ironic.)</p>
<p>Nick laid out the textbook understanding of the pricing mechanism based on marginal cost of production with wonderful clarity and broad insight <a href="http://worthwhile.typepad.com/worthwhile_canadian_initi/2012/11/four-mc-curves-and-two-ppfs.html">here</a>. I want to suggest that the explanation’s key feature is its use of “short-term” and “long-term.” It’s all about time.</p>
<p>But looking at the figures above — which model time fluidly and continuously (realistically?) as opposed to depicting it in two vaguely defined “chunks” — I want to ask whether Nick’s explanation, and the models employed in that explanation, are sufficient (or even proper) to grasp the processes playing out in the marketplace. Could they predict the effects that we see above? Is that type of depiction and prediction even within their inherent realm of capability?</p>
<p>Yes, Hannsgen’s model employs some textbook constructs, but it deploys them in a model that is structurally, qualitatively different from “comparative static” textbook models. Maybe the modeling technique is the message. Or at least, the proper modeling technique is a necessary condition for imparting an accurate and useful message.</p>
<p>Reading Nick’s posts and those of other smart econobloggers and -commenters, I am constantly astounded at his (their) apparent ability to intuitively comprehend and mentally manipulate multidimensional (and multiconceptual) interplays that leave me flummoxed. But I still wonder: is that ability sufficient for Nick to representatively model, in his head — to intuitively <em>understand</em> — the complex interplay of factors at work? His frequent comments about holding one factor constant, and the importance and difficulty of simultanaeity in our thinking, suggest that the answer might be no.</p>
<p>When you add a minimum wage to a free-economy model, is he able to simulate, in his head, all the possibly resultant pathways through the multidimensional space of prices, labor inputs, capital inputs, and output quantities (not to mention redistribution feedback effects, or utility-related factors), all over time — a space where <em>no</em> factors are held constant?</p>
<p>Yes, I’m questioning Nick’s quantitative ability given the models employed to do this kind of simulation in his head. (Suggesting: it’s not just me!, though there is certainly a matter of degree.) But as a result, and also, I’m questioning the <em>qualitative </em>ability of those models as employed to enable such understanding in our limited minds (notably, mine).</p>
<p>As I <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/jim-manzi-correlation-causation-understanding-and-predicting.html">said recently</a>, science is about really understanding how things work — telling a convincing causative story — not (just) predicting what will (might) happen. (At the extreme, you could say that prediction is only useful for scientists as a test of understanding.) The textbook models seem to provide some predictive power, but you gotta wonder how much of that is false positives. And given that question, you have to ask how well they really “explain” how economies work — how much true understanding they provide.</p>
<p>In other words — back to my apparently congenital inability to really internalize and understand the textbook models — it’s not my fault! (Yes: now I am being ironic.)</p>
<p>All this raises one big question for me: why aren’t mainstream economists <em>all over</em> these kinds of dynamic simulation models? Why do we only see them at the fringes, in work by “heterodox” outsiders like Hannsgen and Keen, and in the ever-about-to-emerge work promised by the guys at the Santa Fe Institute? Why aren’t big, and (within limits) out-of-the-box thinkers like Nick, Scott Sumner, Tyler Cowen, etc. — people who show every indication of really wanting to understand — <em>fascinated</em> by the possibilities of this type of modeling? In the weather and climate business, textbook economic modeling techniques would be laughed out of the room. Are not economies of a similar complex, dynamic, emergent type with weather and climate systems — arguably even more so, and more complex, because economies include the game-theory grist of conscious intentions and expectations (about other people’s intentions and expectations)?</p>
<p>I recently corresponded with a econ Phd candidate who really wanted to work with and build such models for his thesis. He reported that everything about the institutional and intellectual structure of academic economics militated against his doing so. “Just grab a data set, build a model and pull some regressions, call it good and head for the tenure track.”</p>
<p>You don’t have to read Kuhn or Marx to wonder whether this isn’t the result of 1. the irresistible intellectual gravitational pull of institutionally sanctioned models however obviously flawed (<a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/the-miasma-school-of-economics.html">miasma</a>, phlogiston, epicycles, equilibrium), and 2. the undeniable (inherent?) effectiveness of existing textbook economic models and modeling techniques in perpetuating and amplifying the established power structures and (increasingly) unequal distribution of income and wealth — wealth that actively seeks to perpetuate and expand itself via institutional structures like universities. (No names, just initials: Mercatus Center.)</p>
<p>I’m <em>not</em> imputing moral corruption here (except perhaps institutional). I both prefer and tend to believe that most of us try to do right, “as God gives us to see the right.” Rather, I tend toward the quite plausible institutional explanation laid out so nicely by Chomsky in <em>Manufacturing Consent. </em>In my words: institutions that are dependent on, are part and parcel of, those larger structures of power and wealth, only hire and promote people who already — perhaps by their very nature — see “right” right. (Or right “right.”)</p>
<p>And who knows? They might be right. Maybe my personal incentive is just to show (myself?) how smart I am relative to the mainstream institutions. But based on the Aha! moments of intuitive understanding that I experience when I see and explore models like Hannsgen’s, I tend to doubt whether that’s the only thing at play.</p>

<p>If employers are faced with higher wage rates, that gives them more incentive to invest in business capital that 1. makes workers more efficient and productive, and 2. reduces the number of workers they need.</p>
<p>Is this incentive effect figured into the analyses of minimum-wage effects that you’ve seen? I haven’t laid eyes on such a thing, but my knowledge of the literature is far from comprehensive.</p>

                                <p>I’ve pointed out before that in some areas (<a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/medicare-government-does-it-right.html">here, Medicare</a>), government programs are hugely more efficient and well-run than their private counterparts.</p>
<p>I don’t know if this qualifies as one of those, but it does make a very important point that I’ve also made before:</p>
<p>Government is not the problem.</p>
<p>Bad government is the problem.</p>
<p>Good government is the solution.</p>

<p>That high-water mark would represent the culmination of eight years of Republican laissez-faire administration (boy you can say that again), coupled with six years of Republican control of both houses of Congress.</p>

                                <p><strong>Update: </strong>More expansive discussion of this model with more graphics, <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/wealth-and-redistribution-revisited-does-enriching-the-rich-actually-make-us-all-richer.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>It has <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/why-prosperity-requires-a-welfare-state.html">long</a> seemed to me that redistribution is, for some reason, necessary for the emergence, continuance, and growth of large, prosperous, modern, high-productivity monetary economies. No such economy has ever emerged absent large quantities of ongoing redistribution. There are no exceptions; every such economy on earth engages in it on a large scale. <em>The Economist </em>recently devoted a whole <a href="http://www.economist.com/printedition/covers/2012-09-06/ap-e-eu-la-me-na-uk">special section</a> to the need for Asian countries — notably China — to develop such systems of social redistribution in order to make the move from “developing” to “advanced.”</p>
<p>That’s the big-picture empirics. What I’ve been missing, have been unable to find, and have been struggling to conceive, is a straightforward, intuitively convincing economic model (mathematical or at least arithmetic) to explain this fact theoretically.</p>
<p>Paul Krugman says that <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/24/a-meta-modeling-meditation/">thinking in terms of models will make you a better person</a>. I want to be a better person.</p>
<p>I think I may have finally created such a model. (I’m feeling better already.) It’s a <em>very</em> simple dynamic simulation model (set it up, plug in parameters, and watch it run over the years), and it’s purely monetary. It makes no attempt to model the real economy of production and trade in real goods. It makes no distinction between consumption and investment spending; there’s just spending. It doesn’t require a theory of value, or of capital, or of profits. It simply assumes that production and trade happen, and that they yield a surplus. You can imagine that surplus as consisting of new real assets, or being embodied in new financial assets that are representative of those real assets. It doesn’t really matter.</p>
<p>The model is based on one and only one behavioral assumption: declining marginal propensity to spend out of wealth. (Something I fiddled with previously, <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/gdp-prosperity-the-wealth-effect-and-marginal-propensity-to-consume.html">here</a>.) That in turn is based on the declining marginal utility of consumption (the millionth dollar spent yields less utility than the first). The assumption, which seems safe both empirically and theoretically:</p>
<p>Rich people spend a smaller portion of their wealth each year than poorer people.</p>
<p>In this model each person’s spending is replaced each year by income (with a surplus), but the spending is determined by the person’s wealth. It assumes that people expect the income to replace the spent wealth, but they’re not certain that it will, always. So they (especially those with low income/wealth) are facing a tradeoff between present spending and long-term economic security. Different wealth/income levels have different propensities to substitute one for the other.</p>
<p>This is basically looking at spending and income from the opposite direction of most such models. Here, spending drives aggregate income (all spending is income, when received), rather than spending being determined by income (which is how we tend to think about individuals).</p>
<p>The rest is just arithmetic.</p>
<p>Here’s the basic setup, with a population of 11 people. The spreadsheet is <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/income-spending-base.xls">here</a> (Google Doc version <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ani8neh17rLSdENMcUdQX1FKRHRCVnFyMURROWhreGc">here</a>); you can change of the numbers and see the results.</p>
<p>I’m assuming 0% inflation for simplicity.</p>
<p>One person has $1 million.</p>
<p>Ten people have $100K each: $1 million total.</p>
<p>The rich person spends 30% of their wealth annually ($300K to start).</p>
<p>The ten poorer people spend 80% of their wealth annually ($80K each, $800K total, to start).</p>
<p>Through work/production and gains from trade, each person gets 5% more income annually than they spend. I’ve black-boxed that whole surplus-creation process; it just happens. I’ve set it up so that income (including the surplus) is distributed to the population proportionally based on how much they spend. It’s a somewhat arbitrary choice (I had to make some choice), but since people’s incomes and expenditures do tend to correlate fairly closely, it doesn’t seem like a nutty one.</p>
<p>The additional money for this annual +5% would come from new bank lending and/or government deficit spending and/or Fed money printing and/or trade surpluses with other countries. Choose your monetary model/paradigm; in any case the surplus is monetized via trade and the financial system.</p>
<p>So no, Income ≠ Expenditure (or vice versa), unless you include purchases of new financial assets in “Expenditures.” Absent those purchases/receipts, Income is 5% greater than Expenditures. That’s what surplus from production/trade is all about, how it plays out in an economy that includes monetary savings.</p>
<p>Now add this: Some percentage of the rich person’s wealth is transferred to the poorer people every year (by the ebil gubmint man).</p>
<p>Does that wealth transfer make everyone wealthier, or poorer? Here’s the result with the numbers I set out above:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/total-wealth-income1.png"><img title="total wealth income" src="http://www.asymptosis.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/total-wealth-income1-480x328.png" alt="" width="480" height="328"></a></p>
<p>In this model, taking money from the rich and giving it to the poor make us more prosperous in aggregate, raises all boats, makes the pie bigger…you’ve heard all the metaphors.</p>
<p>Explanation below the fold.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a>
<p><img title="More..." src="http://www.asymptosis.com/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/wordpress/img/trans.gif" alt="">The arithmetic, and the theory, is simple:</p>
<p>1. Redistribution results in more spending (because of declining marginal propensity to spend from wealth)</p>
<p>2. More spending spurs more production</p>
<p>3. More production (and trade) produces more surplus</p>
<p>4. Surplus (monetized) is the source of monetary savings</p>
<p>5. Bonus: More savings (wealth) results in more spending. (Note the exponential curves.)</p>
<p>6. Repeat loop.</p>
<p>The result seems to be an apparently counterintuitive, but on consideration very obvious, conclusion:</p>
<p>Saving doesn’t cause saving. <em>Spending</em> causes saving.</p>
<p>The preceding is halfway tongue in cheek. It points out how problematic the word “saving” is in a monetary context. Saving some of this year’s corn crop is straightforward enough — eat less of it. Money makes it into a far more complicated concept, cause you can’t eat money.</p>
<p>I would say instead:</p>
<p>Spending causes <em>accumulation</em>, because it spurs production and trade, resulting in a surplus. That surplus is what allows for accumulation.</p>
<p>So we want more spending, and <em>less</em> so-called “saving.” Some people call it money hoarding, but that’s confusing too. The best synonym for monetary saving is “not spending.”</p>
<p>I’m with <a href="http://worthwhile.typepad.com/worthwhile_canadian_initi/2012/01/why-saving-should-be-banned.html">Nick</a>: we should stop using the word saving.</p>
<p>More monetary saving by individuals (the word works fine for individuals) — spending a smaller proportion of their wealth on real goods each year — results in less accumulation in aggregate.</p>
<p>Faithful readers will recognize that this purely monetary model sidesteps and obviates the need for the conceptual quagmire associated with S = I = Y – C — a construct which, in its effort to go in the opposite direction from mine and model a barter, real economy devoid of monetary savings, arguably makes it impossible or at least very difficult to think cogently about how monetary economies (i.e. all economies) work.</p>
<p>But how about sharesies? Is it fair? Here’s how it plays out:</p>

</table>
<p>At 1.5% redistribution in this model, the rich person’s income, spending, and wealth all stay the same over time (remember: no inflation here), while the poorer people’s income and wealth almost triple, and overall wealth and income more than doubles. Seem fair to you? Pareto devotees please comment.</p>
<p>I know exactly where everyone’s going with this: incentives and behavioral responses. And I have to admit that I did make one other behavioral assumption here: that there are no other behavioral responses.</p>
<p>Giving a bit less money to the rich person will give slightly less incentive to work. But at the same time it’s giving <em>ten poorer people far more incentive</em> to work. You do the math. (This all before we get into issues of substitution vs. income effects at different wealth and income levels, something I won’t even begin to address here.)</p>
<p>Whatever combination of behavioral effects one might posit, I would suggest that the burden of proof lies with the positor to demonstrate, empirically, that those effects are sufficient to overwhelm (or supplement?) the inexorable arithmetic of compounding that’s at play here.</p>
<p>Finally, note that this model doesn’t even touch on aggregate utility delivered under each regime. Since the spending of the poorer people is split among ten — each spending $80K/year to start — a larger proportion of that spending is on necessities like food, clothing, shelter, health care, and education. I think all economists will stipulate to the proposition that those purchases yield higher utility per dollar than a family’s purchase of a third car or a fourth TV. So the graph above greatly understates the higher aggregate utility provided by redistribution, and the table either understates the utility gains by the poorer people, or overstates the gains by the rich one. (It would be easy to add a somewhat arbitrary formula to represent that effect graphically, but I’ll leave it to your imagination.)</p>
<p>And: this utility effect would serve to multiply the incentive for poorer people discussed in the previous paragraph, giving the ten people even <em>more</em> incentive to work.</p>
<p>I’m rather taken with this spending + surplus = income dynamic approach to modeling. (But I would be, wouldn’t I?) I’d be delighted to see how others might analyze and display results using various parameters, and how they might adjust, improve, or dismantle the model. In particular: are there obvious, gaping flaws here?</p>

                                <p>I’ve been reading <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=8R3NrzE8veEC&#038;printsec=frontcover&#038;dq=johnson+ghost+map&#038;hl=en&#038;sa=X&#038;ei=UFmxUJfUMMjziQLitYHAAQ&#038;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&#038;q&#038;f=false">Steven Johnson’s <em>The Ghost Map</em></a>, about the London cholera epidemic of 1854, and one passage reminded me exactly of today’s economics discipline.</p>
<p>The sense of similarity was heightened because I also (instigated by <a href="http://worthwhile.typepad.com/worthwhile_canadian_initi/2012/07/can-you-please-read-a-first-year-textbook.html">Nick Rowe</a>) happened to be reading <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=xoztFMavGCcC&#038;pg=PA273&#038;lpg=PA273&#038;dq=%22rising+marginal+cost%22+mankiw&#038;source=bl&#038;ots=5S2vEuP1mj&#038;sig=DWA8HrJDg7l0QxxurXXH2ijj8s4&#038;hl=en&#038;sa=X&#038;ei=4QqwUNW-EIvYigKU6YHwDA&#038;ved=0CEAQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&#038;q=%22rising%20marginal%20cost%22%20mankiw&#038;f=false">Mankiw’s micro textbook section on the rising marginal cost of production</a> — a notion that 1. is ridiculous on its face, 2. is completely contrary to how profit-maximizing producers think, and 3. is based on just-plain incorrect math.* It’s just one of many central pillars of “textbook” economics that are still being taught with a straight face, even though they been resoundingly disproved <em>by the discipline’s own leading practitioners, </em>on the discipline’s own terms, and using its own language, constructs, and methods. These zombie ideas just won’t die. (Or to quote my friend Ole, “People never learn, and they never forget.”)</p>
<p>Economics today has a profound resemblance to medicine before the germ theory of disease.</p>
<p>Lots of people in 1854 were trying to figure out what caused cholera, and how it was transmitted. The dominant theory was “miasma” — basically bad air emanating from smelly, unsanitary conditions, especially in poor areas with lots of leaking, overflowing basement cesspools full of shit. These were contaminating the water supply, of course, so the real transmission mechanism was people drinking the effluent from previous victims.</p>
<p>The solution to the miasma problem? Empty the cesspools into the Thames — systematically poisoning the water supply. Yes, that’s what they did.</p>
<p>The miasma theory had incredible staying power, even though it was clearly and patently disproved by the thousands of Londoners whose vocation was slopping through the sewers, day and night (presumably in the thickest of possible miasmas), searching for anything valuable that they could sell. They didn’t get cholera or die at any greater rate — perhaps even less.</p>
<p>Johnson:</p>
<blockquote><p>Why was the miasma theory so persuasive? Why did so many brilliant minds cling to it, despite the mounting evidence that suggested it was false? … Whenever smart people cling to an outlandishly incorrect idea despite substantial evidence to the contrary, something interesting is at work. In the case of miasma, that something involves a convergence of multiple forces, all coming together to prop up a theory that should have died out decades before. Some of those forces were ideological in nature, matters of social prejudice and convention. Some revolved around conceptual limitations, failures of imagination and analysis. Some involve the basic wiring of the human brain itself. Each on its own might not have been strong enough to persuade an entire public-health system to empty raw sewage into the Thames. But together they created a kind of perfect storm of error.</p>
<p>Miasma certainly had the force of tradition on its side. … Just about every epidemic disease on record has been, at one point or another, attributed to poisoned miasma. …</p>
<p>But tradition alone can’t account for the predominance of the miasma theory. The Victorians who clung to it were in almost every other respect true revolutionaries, living in revolutionary times: Chadwick was inventing a whole new model for shaping public health; Farr transforming the use of statistics; Nightingale challenging countless received ideas about the role of women in professional life, as well as the practice of nursing. Dickens, Engels, Mayhew — these  were not people naturally inclined to accept the status quo. In fact, they were all, in their separate ways, spoiling for a fight. So it’s not sufficient to blame their adherence to the miasma theory purely on its long pedigree.</p>
<p>The perseverance of miasma theory into the nineteenth century was as much a matter of instinct as it was intellectual tradition. Again and again in the literature of miasma, the argument is inextricably linked to the author’s visceral disgust at the smells of the city. The sense of smell is often described as the most primitive of the senses, provoking powerful feelings of lust or repulsion…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think it’s worth pointing out here the <a href="http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/haidt08/haidt08_index.html">work of Jonathan Haidt et al</a> showing that conservatives have a big “purity” and “disgust” dimension to their moral roadmap, a dimension that is largely absent or far more muted among liberals. Which leads to…</p>
<blockquote><p>Raw social prejudice also played a role. Like the other great scientific embarrassment of the period – phrenology — the miasma theory was regularly invoked to justify all sorts of groundless class and ethnic biases. … The predisposing cause lay in the bodies of the sufferers themselves. That constitutional failing was invariably linked to moral or social failing: poverty, alcohol abuse, unsanitary living. One alleged expert argued in 1850: “The probability of an outburst or increase during [calm, mild] weather, I believed to be heightened on holidays, Saturdays, Sundays, and any other occasions where opportunities were afforded the lower classes for dissipation and debauchery.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So disease epidemics are clearly the result of the 40-hour work week. You can find the modern-day equivalent in John Cochrane and Casey Mulligan’s assertions that today’s unemployment has nothing to do with the high job-seeker-to-job-opening ratio (caused by lack of demand for producers’ goods, and their ensuing non-need for more workers), but rather results from workers being unwilling to work at low wages (and being coddled by government programs).</p>
<blockquote><p>Like much of the reasoning that lay behind the miasma theory, the idea of an inner constitution was not entirely wrong; immune systems do vary from person to person, and some people may indeed be resistant to epidemic diseases like cholera or smallpox or plague. The scaffolding that kept miasma propped up for so long was largely made up of comparable half-truths, correlations mistaken for causes. Methane and hydrogen sulfide <em>were </em>in fact poisons, after all; they just weren’t concentrated enough in the city air to cause real damage. People <em>were </em>more likely to die of cholera at lower elevations, but not for the reasons Farr imagined. And the poor <em>did </em>have higher rates of contagion than the well-to-do, but not because they were morally debauched.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Likewise, there are many valid and semi-valid ideas, theories, and constructs floating around in the world of textbook economics. But they are so intertwined with, caught up in the miasma, or phlogiston, or epicycle theories that today constitute mainstream economics (think: equilibrium, rational expectations, etc.) that it’s hard for even the clearest-eyed economist — much less the everyday person or Washington staffer, legislator, or policy wonk — to tell the shit from the shinola.</p>
<p>Without trying to take the metaphor too far, I’d like to suggest that today’s austerians are in favor of emptying the cesspools into the water supply — based on similarly loopy reasoning.</p>
<p>* The rising marginal cost theory is ridiculous on its face because it assumes that producers add one factor of production at a time — hire more workers, for instance, without renting more space for them to work. (This is exactly what Mankiw describes in his textbook; see “Thirsty Thelma’s.”) Voila! Each worker’s productivity declines. This is of course not what producers do, which is why only 11% of top-corporation execs say they face rising marginal costs of production. (I’m wondering if that 11% made the mistake of taking an intro econ class in college.) For a nice recap of that executive survey, and the faulty math of rising marginal costs, see <a href="http://www.paecon.net/PAEReview/issue53/KeenStandish53.pdf">here</a> (PDF).</p>

                                <p>With Republicans frantically clinging to discredited ideology and digging in their heels on raising top marginal tax rates, I thought it would be worth revisiting a post from a couple of years ago, showing some excellent long-term evidence that <strong>higher marginal tax rates are not associated with slower growth. Quite the contrary, in fact.</strong> Here you go:</p>
<p>Mike Kimel once again does yeoman’s duty to compare the two:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/01/tax-rates-v-real-gdp-growth-rates.html?utm_source=feedburner&#038;utm_medium=feed&#038;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+blogspot%2FHzoh+%28Angry+Bear%29">Tax Rates v. Real GDP Growth Rates, a Scatter Plot | Angry Bear</a>.</p>
<p>In this post commenter Kaleberg adds a very cool scatterplot.</p>
<p>Each dot is a year (t), compared to another year one to four years later (t+1, t+2, etc.).</p>
<p>Bottom axis is the top marginal tax rate in the starting year. Left axis is annual GDP growth over the ensuing one to four years.</p>
<p><img title="Marginal Rates and GDP Growth" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TT_5n4rT91I/AAAAAAAAAg8/UQj16asciMQ/s400/scatter.bmp" alt="" width="400" height="372"></p>
<p>Starting years from 1929 to 2008.</p>
<p>With everything trending up and to the right, <strong>it sure looks like higher marginal rates and faster growth go together</strong>. But it’s hard to eyeball these kinds of things, so I pulled correlations. For ending years t+1 through t+4:</p>
<p>0.27 0.28 0.28 0.27</p>
<p>I also dropped in Real GDP/Capita in place of Real GDP. Of course the growth rates are slightly lower — the population (the denominator) was growing. But the graph looks basically the same.</p>
<p>Here are the correlations with marginal tax rate — also lower, but darn close:</p>
<p>0.23 0.23 0.23 0.21</p>
<p>Very consistent.</p>
<p>Short story, there is a statistically significant positive  correlation between marginal tax rates in year X and both GDP and GDP-per-capita growth over ensuing years.</p>
<p>It’s pretty small, but consistent and consistently positive – <strong>a higher marginal tax rate in year X correlates with faster growth over the ensuing four years.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Especially interesting: </strong>this encompasses a <em>huge</em> range of marginal rates — from a low of 28% (’88 through ’90) to highs of 84-94% (1944 to 1963 — when we saw the fastest growth in U.S. history; ’64-’69, the top marginal rate was over 70%).</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that the lowest rate since 1928 was 24% — in 1929.</p>

                                                                            <a href="./../index.html" class="post-category-41" title="Steve Roth"><div class="color-box"></div>Steve Roth</a>                                                                     </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>This item raised my eyebrows when I saw it. Joshua Tucker at The Monkey Cage points out that <a href="http://themonkeycage.org/blog/2012/11/23/throwing-the-1-under-the-bus-for-the-0-1/">the Republicans are proposing we do exactly that</a>.</p>
<p>The idea (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/23/us/politics/congress-looks-at-ways-to-leave-top-tax-rate-as-is.html?pagewanted=1&#038;_r=0&#038;hp">NYT</a>, emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote><p>…<strong>tax the entire salary earned by those making more than a certain level — $400,000 or so — at the top rate of 35 percent</strong> rather than allowing them to pay lower rates before they reach the target, as is the standard formula.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This to avoid the <em>inevitably</em> apocalyptic increase of the top marginal tax rate by 4.6%, from 35% to 39.6%.</p>
<p>As Tucker points out, this proposal increases the taxes for <em>everybody making >$400K by the same amount</em> –<em> </em>whether their income is $500K or $50 million.</p>
<p>Holding up my thumb and squinting, I’m thinking the extra taxes for those folks would be $50-100K. This would be a massive percentage increase for $400K earners, but a drop in the bucket even for $4-million earners, much less the $40-million crowd.</p>
<p>Avoiding that 4.6% top marginal tax rate increase saves a $20-million earner almost a $1 million a year.</p>
<p>As Tucker also points out, this is a stupendous gift to those who have the means to really give back to elected officials — the donors who can make or break a campaign by signing a single check.</p>
<p>But I’m sure the Republicans haven’t considered that. They’re just trying to do What’s Best for America.</p>
