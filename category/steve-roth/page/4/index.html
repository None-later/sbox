<p>I started to explain it, but realized that the standard usage is wildly screwy and confusing for any normal human, and decided to explain it here instead.</p>
<p>The problem is that even in standard economists’ usage, “public” is used in two different ways:</p>
<p>1. “Public” debt: debt <em>owed</em> by the government. In this usage, “public” means “government.” It’s sort of metaphorical: the government r us. As in “the public [versus the private] sector.” “Public debt” is often called “gross public debt.” That includes money “owed” to Social Security, etc.</p>
<p>Note that these debts to trust funds don’t in any way represent the liabilities of those programs; they’re pretty much arbitrary numbers, accidents of the moment, bookkeeping artifacts of a political/ideological construct, that are best ignored if true understanding is the goal. “Gross public debt” a.k.a. “public debt” — the $14.3 trillion shown in this graphic — is not an even vaguely useful figure in understanding the fiscal position of the country or the federal government.</p>
<p>2. “Debt held by the public” (<em>not</em> the public as described in this graphic): in this usage, the public is exactly <em>not</em> the government. It refers to debt held by <em>non</em> government — <em>including</em> other governments, and private holders in other countries. This is often called “net public debt.”</p>
<p>Watch: two (contradictory) usages of the same word, in one equation!</p>
<p>Net public [government] debt = debt held by the public [non government]</p>
<p>You can see this if you <a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/tags/series/?t=debt%3Bpublic">search for “public debt” on Fred</a>. Or, read this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_public_debt">wikipedia graph caption</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Red lines indicate the debt held by the public (net public debt) and black lines indicate the total public debt outstanding (gross public debt), the difference being that the gross debt includes that held by the federal government itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s no wonder people are confused.</p>
<p>This graphic makes it even more confusing, because “the public” here is the <em>domestic private sector plus state and local governments</em>. And it <em>excludes</em> foreign-held debt, which <em>is</em> included in the normal definition of “debt held by the public.”</p>
<p>This is the fault of the New York Times, which uses the term in the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2011/07/28/us/charting-the-american-debt-crisis.html#panel/how-the-debt-accumulated">infographic</a> from which this graphic is prepared. Not only they start with the gross figure rather than the more useful net figure, but they use “the public” in a completely idiosyncratic way.</p>
<p>A further complication: in standard usage, “debt held by the public” includes Fed holdings, even though the Fed is part of the government. The interest it is paid (by the Treasury) on government bonds is paid right back to the Treasury. (The presumption is that those bonds will eventually be sold back to the private sector.) This is not usually such a big deal, but these days the Fed is holding 17% of the Debt Held By The Public.</p>
<p>I suggest the word “public” should be eradicated from all these usages, in favor of more descriptive and precise terms. “Public” does nothing but confuse if you don’t know <em>exactly</em> what it means. Instead, say things like:</p>
<p>Net federal debt.</p>
<p>Net federal debt minus Fed holdings.</p>
<p>Federal debt held by the domestic private sector.</p>
<p>Government debt [including state and local]</p>
<p>And etc. The bookkeeping at this high level is not actually very complicated, so hopefully careful usage will help people better understand and discuss fiscal issues.</p>

                                <p>I’d like to interject a very concrete example into the large swirl of quite theoretical, thought-experiment discussion about whether “demand for money” means “demand for the medium of exchange” or “demand for the medium of account.” <a href="http://www.themoneyillusion.com/?p=17368">Scott Sumner</a> and <a href="http://worthwhile.typepad.com/worthwhile_canadian_initi/2012/10/medium-of-account-vs-medium-of-exchange.html">Nick Rowe</a> are, as so often, at the center of this discussion. But before I do, I need to work through some conceptual and terminology issues.<br />Nick — who so often cuts so clearly to the crux of things — injects what he seems to feel (rightly so, I think) is a necessary update and clarification into his sally on the subject:<br />
<blockquote>…in my model, gold is the medium of account; and (say) an ounce of gold is the unit of account.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m not clear whether or not the update was in reply to M.R.’s comment, which addresses exactly the point I want to make:<br />
<blockquote>I’m still not convinced that the concept of a “medium of account” is well enough specified. “Unit of account” is fairly straightforward; we measure everything in units (inches, kilograms, minutes, etc.) What is the “medium of account” in the current U.S. monetary system, analogous to the role that gold plays in your simple model? If your answer is “dollars” then I think you may have a very serious specification problem. This is very subtle and difficult.</p></blockquote>
<p>Nick does reply directly to that comment, and his reply’s uncertain nature fully supports my thinking:<br />
<blockquote>OK, but the unit of account (in my model) isn’t “ounces”, it is ounces of gold, as opposed to ounces of silver or ounces of hair.<br />Medium of account in the US? Hmm. Fed liabilities?</p></blockquote>
<p>Here we see Nick Rowe — who thinks as deeply and curiously (but I think misguidedly) about monetary economics as anyone out there — wondering what the U.S. medium of account <em>is</em>. This, after hundreds of years of very hard thinking by very smart people about the nature of money. It’s enough to make you question economists’ understanding of economics. They don’t even understand <em>money</em>?<br />The more I think about it, the more I think that “medium of account” is an incoherent concept (and even worse, “demand for the medium of account,” which seems doubly incoherent) — a will o’ the wisp that lures otherwise coherent thinkers into dangerous and bottomless conceptual b(l)ogs.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Think about “medium” and “media” in a very common usage — relative to information and entertainment. In this context media are vehicles for transmission — books, newspapers, TV, web pages.<br />This meaning kind of works for “medium of exchange” — dollar bills and bank interchanges are vehicles for transmitting something — value. Just like power lines and cans of gasoline are media for transmitting energy.<br />There are many media of monetary exchange (especially if you include purely financial transactions) — physical pieces of currency, credits in bank (and money-market) accounts, credit-card lines of credit, treasury bonds, bank reserves, etc. Dollar bills and bank-account credits have traditionally been the dominant media of exchange for exchanges involving real-world goods and services, but even that is far less true these days, given the quantity of credit-card sales. “Medium of exchange” at least makes conceptual sense. But “<em>the</em> medium of exchange” doesn’t. There are many. To steal M.R.’s words, it has “a very serious specification problem.”<br />“Money as the medium of account” is really far worse. What is being transmitted, and what is the vehicle? What does this term — in particular the word “medium” here – <em>mean</em>? It’s obviously about counting and measurement. But what is being measured, counted? I would say: value — just like a thermometer measures temperature, or a ruler measures length. But in those contexts, the media of account are <em>temperature</em> and <em>length. </em>(The units of account are degrees and inches, or whatever.) I’d like to suggest that in economic thinking the medium of account is <em>always</em> value — not “money” (however you choose to define that word), and never dollars or ounces of gold, which are <em>units</em> of account. If this is safe, “demand for the medium of account” would mean “demand for value” — which strikes me as obvious, or tautological, or just not very useful, conceptually. And “demand for the <em>unit</em> of account” obviously makes no sense at all; is there demand for inches or degrees?<br />This is where M.R. gets it right, and Nick in his update glances toward more useful thinking: we should be talking, thinking, about <em>units</em> of account, and how value is ascribed to those units.<br />In the normal course of things, a (physical or electronic) dollar has the same designated, ascribed, agreed-upon value as “the dollar.” But as Miles Kimball points out in what he describes as “<em><a href="http://blog.supplysideliberal.com/post/35123798395/how-subordinating-paper-money-to-electronic-money-can">the most important thing I have ever said about monetary policy</a>,” </em>this need not necessarily be true. A physical dollar can, conceptually at least, have a different value than an electronic dollar. (Once again I would say that each of these is a financial asset, an embodiment of money or exchange value, with particular properties and characteristics which may be in greater or lesser demand — and supply — at different times.) Different kinds of dollars could have different values, <em>as designated in dollars!</em> We really need different words for these things. (See: concrete example, below.)<br />Let me put it another way: I think Nick, Scott, and most economists don’t fully understand that “a dollar” is, conceptually, a completely different <em>type</em> of thing from “the dollar.” (At least they talk as if they don’t.) One is a unit (and vehicle) of exchange, the other is a unit of account, or measurement. And as Miles points out, even “a dollar” is not sufficiently specified.<br />I promised a concrete example, and here it is, courtesy of <em>This American Life</em>‘s typically brilliant “<a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/423/the-invention-of-money">The Invention of Money</a>” episode: how Brazil ended years of rampant hyperinflation. I’m rather astounded that, searching through my blog reader, I find that nobody has looked at this real-world example, even though it’s <em>exactly the situation</em> that Scott and Nick are talking about. (I’m sure there are others like it. Readers?)<br />Here’s the short story, but I recommend the whole thing; it’s short and very entertaining.<br />The cruzeiro had been plummeting in value (relative to real goods) for years. This was true both of the units of exchange (“cruzeiros” of all types — physical, electronic, etc.) and the unit of account (“the cruzeiro”) — necessarily so, because <em>they were uniformly conceived as the same thing</em>.<br />The solution was to introduce a new unit of account — rather cravenly titled the <em>real</em> in an effort to get people to ascribe real market-basket value to it — and to require its use in designating the <em>value</em> of everything, regardless of what units were exchanged. (Conceptually, they could have just revalued “the cruzeiro,” but nobody would have fallen for it because nobody trusted either the cruzeiro <em>or</em> cruzeiros. They would have continued to ascribe low — and ever-lower — value to it.)<br />By legislative fiat, all wages, taxes, and prices were to be designated in the new “real” unit of account.<br />
<blockquote>People had to be tricked into thinking money had value, when all signs told them that was absolutely not true. So Basha says, they wrote a plan for a new currency, one that was stable, dependable, trustworthy. The only catch was this currency would not be real. It would not be printed. There would never be coins. It was fake. They called it a virtual currency.<br /><strong>Edmar Basha</strong><br />We called the unit of real value, URV. Yeah, it was a virtue that didn’t exist in fact.<br /><strong>Chana Joffe</strong><br />People would still have cruzeiros, the local currency in their pockets. But when they got paid, their wages would be listed in URVs. Taxes were in URVs and all prices were listed in URVs. And URVs were stable. And so, for example, when you went to the store and bought some milk.<br /><strong>Edmar Basha</strong><br />How much does it cost? Say well, know we have it cost X. Let’s say one URV. Well, how much is that because I cannot pay with URV. Well, I have this little table here and today’s value of URV in cruzeiros is seven cruzeiros per URV. So it cost one URV, seven cruzeiros.<br />You go next week, well, it’s still one URV. But then you say, how many cruzeiros? You look, well, 14.<br /><strong>Chana Joffe</strong><br />Every night the central bank would put out a memo with the official conversion rate. And a table would get printed in the newspaper. The store clerk could look at the table in the newspaper and see, Monday, one URV is equal to seven cruzeiros. Tuesday, 12 cruzeiros. Wednesday, 14. Milk or whatever it was you were buying would stay the same price. There was no need for the sticker man.</p></blockquote>
<p>Eventually they phased out cruzeiros and issued physical reals. It worked:<br />
<blockquote>Brazil went from being an irrelevant, economic basket-case to one of the most important economies out there. The eighth largest in the world.</p></blockquote>
<p>Notice “unit” in the name. (Not “medium.”) The stability of the unit of account was what mattered — what value people ascribed to it. That ascription was anchored to real value because wages and taxes were designated in that unit, which also made “reals” into units of electronic exchange. (For the former: labor theory of value, anyone? For the latter: got chartalism?)<br />You’ll notice I never used the word “medium” to describe what happened here. At best it was unecessary, and at worst it would have sown all sorts of confusion and incoherence. We don’t need no stinking mediums.<br />Update: ﻿I should add that &#8220;unit&#8221; here is also used in two senses: 1. Exchange units of which there are many, that can be shuffled around physically or electronically, and 2. a more abstract and necessarily singular measurement or accounting unit. The value of the former are designated in the latter.<br /><em>Cross-posted at <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/?p=6296">Asymptosis</a>.</em></p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Jim Manzi, curious as always (especially about how to evaluate government policies), <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/05/what-is-causality/257193/">tries to plumb the problem of causality</a>. Here’s where he begins:</p>
<blockquote><p>Consider two questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>&#8211; Does A cause B?</li>
<li>&#8211; If I take action A, will it cause outcome B?</li>
</ol>
<p>I don’t care about the first, or more precisely, I might care about it, but only as scaffolding that might ultimately help me to answer the second.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ll risk going Manichaean here in an effort at (simplistic) clarity: I think this encapsulates a key difference between scientists and engineers.</p>
<p>Scientists want to understand how something works — not just “does A cause B?” but “what is the mechanism whereby A causes B?” Successful prediction is valuable (mainly? only?) because it validates or invalidates that understanding. Their main goal is to build coherent theory and understanding. Prediction is a happy by-product and necessary corrective.</p>
<p>Engineers want to understand how something works so that they can predict things — and create things that capitalize on that predictive power. They’re perfectly happy if they can predict successfully without understanding why the prediction works. Coherent theory is generally necessary to achieve this — they need to understand how things work — but it’s not their ultimate goal. Theory is a necessary evil.</p>
<p>An assertion of causality requires both. You need to show that B follows A reliably, but to be confident of causation, you need to explain — really tell a story — about how that causality works.</p>
<p>Both of these approaches are necessary and proper, of course, and they’re complementary. But I’d suggest that theory — the goal of science and most scientists — is what really matters in the long run. It’s easy enough to predict that the sun will rise in the east every day. Successfully predicting that yields many happy benefits. But <em>understanding why</em> — heliocentrism, earth rotation, gravity, momentum, etc. — now that is really profound. That coherent theory provides engineers with their necessary evil, so they can create and capitalize on further successful predictions.</p>
<p>With his “I don’t care about the first,” Jim puts himself squarely in the “engineers” camp that I’ve (again simplistically) described. Don’t get me wrong: I’m quite certain that Jim Manzi is quite curious and hungry for understanding (even while he’s skeptical about our ability to understand how complex human systems work). But by putting himself in that camp, he is aligning himself with, and providing aid and comfort to, a group that actively distrusts and dislikes egghead elitist types with all their fancy theories about evolution and climate and yes, economics. He aligns himself with a group that doesn’t really care about understanding, that just wants to know “which button should I push?”</p>
<p>It’s a group that tends to come up with answers like “Just cut taxes.”</p>

<p>If Democrats can bring Indiana, Virginia, North Carolina, and Florida (or even two or three of them) firmly into the Democratic camp, the game is over for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>Those states are clearly where Democrats’ long-term, big-picture political efforts need to be focused in the next two to four years.</p>

                                <p>I’ve often commented on how childish, really <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/to-claim-objectivism-at-20-is-predictable-to-claim-objectivism-at-60-is-plain-idiocy.html">adolescent</a>, the views of libertarians are. But it’s rare that I see such a stunning example.</p>
<p>In a recent <em>NYT</em> “<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2012/10/30/do-we-really-need-fema/the-free-market-can-do-a-better-job-than-fema">Room for Debate</a>,” Russell Sobel of The Citadel gives us this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Fixing disaster relief is simple: greater use of decentralized markets, and focusing government on its proper role.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After all, “Economists from Adam Smith to Friedrich Hayek to Milton Friedman have stressed the inherent problems in central planning.”</p>
<p>So there you go. QED.</p>
<p>Here, Sobel explains, is the “simple” solution to solving any problems of disaster relief:</p>
<blockquote><p>By renting the [Chicago Board of Trade] trading floor and using the exchange, supplies and services would be better allocated to disaster victims than they are now by FEMA.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because:</p>
<blockquote><p>Such mechanisms simply work better</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s so simple! And obvious! Why didn’t anybody think of this before? Heck, <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/to-claim-objectivism-at-20-is-predictable-to-claim-objectivism-at-60-is-plain-idiocy.html">a thirteen-year-old could have come up with it</a>.</p>
<p>And all of this is before we ever ask the question: does our disaster relief system need fixing? It certainly did under W. And: what part of it needs fixing? If recent fiascos provide any answer, the missing piece was effective national leadership.</p>
<p>Given that effective leadership, America seems to have <em>far and away</em> the best disaster relief system in the world — private, state, local, and federal combined, all working together. Just look at our preparedness and response this week — awe-inspiring.</p>
<p>Conservatives: Am I wrong?</p>
<p>And: You want to <em>dismantle</em> it?</p>
<p>So much for American exceptionalism.</p>

                                <p>While he (uncharacteristically) doesn’t explain or deploy it terribly well, Paul Krugman <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/19/1933-and-all-that/">points to some very excellent research</a> on <strong>the relationship between private debt levels and the depth and duration of (especially financial-crisis-driven) recessions</strong>. The Schularick/Taylor Vox EU article is <a href="http://www.voxeu.org/article/fact-checking-financial-recessions">here</a>. The Jorda/Schularick/Taylor paper is <a href="http://www.jfki.fu-berlin.de/faculty/economics/team/persons/schularick/NBERw17621.pdf">here</a> (PDF).</p>
<p>I think the work is excellent in large part because JS&#038;T address one of my pet peeves: sample size and selection. Unlike Reinhardt and Rogoff, who make <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/debt-90-of-gdp-associated-with-1-percent-lower-median-growth.html">wild claims about government debt/GDP levels above 90%</a> based on a mere handful of sample points (examples that mostly aren’t representative of our current or recent situation), and unlike the kind of single-country and short/single-period analyses that you see all the time, and totally unlike shameless cherry pickers such as John Taylor (who dares to call 1981 — unequivocally a Fed- and interest-rate-driven recession — a financial crisis) <strong>JS&#038;T look at a long-term, representative, multi-country data set culled from:</strong><br /><strong><br /></strong>o Fourteen <em>advanced </em>economies that at least in that sense are representative of the economies that at least I am interested in understanding (i.e., ours). “The share of global GDP accounted for by these countries was around 50% in the year 2000.”<br />o Over 140 years<br />o Using a very clear definition of “financial recession” (below).<br />They end up with a sample of 208 recessions in advanced economies over that period, 35 of which were financial recessions.</p>
<p>And then they look at multiple lag times (something that is far too often absent from time-series studies): with conditions X in year zero, how do economies perform 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years later? (I rather took this issue to the limit in comparing US and EU growth rates, <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/u-s-versus-europe-whos-winning-now.html">here</a>.)<br />Results? I’ll cut to the comment that I just left on Krugman’s blog, with graphics added and some links and editing for your reading pleasure.</p>

<div>The Schudarick/Taylor Vox article is excellent, as is the Jorda/Schularick/Taylor paper underlying it.</div>
<div>But I don’t think you describe them well.</div>
<div>First, ST&#038;J don’t use “use pre-crisis credit growth … to identify financial-crisis slumps.” They use <a href="http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2008/wp08224.pdf">Laeven and Valencia’s</a> (PDF) definition of a “systemic banking crisis.” [Emphasis and bracketed additions are mine.]</div>
<blockquote><div>…a country’s <strong>corporate and financial sectors experience a large number of defaults and financial institutions and corporations face great difficulties repaying contracts on time</strong>. As a result, non-performing loans increase sharply and <strong>all or most of the aggregate banking system capital is exhausted</strong>. This situation may be accompanied by depressed asset prices (such as equity and real estate prices) on the heels of run-ups before the crisis, sharp increases in real interest rates, and a slowdown or reversal in capital flows. <strong>In some cases, the crisis is triggered by depositor runs on banks</strong> [yes we saw some &#8212; Northern Rock &#8212; but largely a cause rather than an effect],<strong> though in most cases it is a general realization that systemically important financial institutions are in distress</strong>. [No names, just initials: Lehman Brothers. AIG.]“</div>
</blockquote>
<div>Yes: they find “that such [financial] slumps are indeed characterized by slow recovery.”</div>
<div>But their focus and key finding relates to private debt levels prior to such crises, and how those debt levels relate the depth and duration of the ensuing recession. They conclude that:</div>
<div>1. Higher private debt levels (and runups) prior to recessions correlate with much deeper and longer recessions (slower recoveries), and</div>
<div>2. That effect is especially pronounced with financial recessions, (those associated with systemic banking crises).</div>
<div><a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Screen-shot-2012-10-20-at-10.09.41-AM.png"><img alt="" height="424" src="http://www.asymptosis.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Screen-shot-2012-10-20-at-10.09.41-AM.png" title="Screen shot 2012-10-20 at 10.09.41 AM" width="337"></a></div>
<div>A typical financial recession in an advanced country that begins with high private debt levels takes two years to hit -5% GDP growth, and continues for three more years without regaining its previous level.</div>
<div>We saw U.S. private debt skyrocket off the charts in the thirty years leading up to this financial crisis (except in the early 90s…), utterly dwarfing the runup in government debt:</div>
<div><img alt="" height="393" src="http://cdn.debtdeflation.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/121911_0526_Movementatt5.png" title="private versus govt debt" width="467"></div>
<div>Based on ST&#038;J’s work, that runup and magnitude in private debt, preceding (and <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/what-caused-the-great-recession-the-economist-sez-too-much-money.html">causing</a>) the financial crisis (combined with standard and straightforward Fisher/Minsky theory), is all the explanation anyone needs for the deep downturn and slow recovery.</div>
<p>A grateful nod to my fellow contributors on this subject: While I find <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/10/debt-and-growth.html">Jazzbumpa and Arthur’s arguments about private debt and growth</a> compelling, I do not find the single-country (U.S.) evidence that they provide conclusively convincing (for the reasons outlined above, and <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/09/repeat-after-me-low-taxes-on-rich.html">here</a> [also see comments there]). I am pleased to find that a far more comprehensive and more systematically analyzed data set seems to support their conclusions. JS&#038;T don’t do 20-year lags, so it’s hard to know from them what the long-term growth effects are of excessive private-debt runups. But they certainly display a mechanism whereby such runups could damage long-term growth: by savaging that growth in rare but devastating financial recessions.<br />And it’s worth remembering who that devastation is visited upon: the middle class and the poor. <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/recessions-are-natures-way-of-keeping-the-little-guy-down.html">The rich do just fine.</a><br />Recessions are nature’s (and neoclassicals’) way…of keeping the little guy down.<br /><em>Cross-posted at <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/?p=6219">Asymptosis</a>.</em></p>

                                <p>The excellent Justin Fox <a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/fox/2012/10/throwing-out-insiders-corporate-boards.html">makes the excellent point</a> that I have made many times: that nobody in the ecosystem of publicly traded companies — including shareholders – <em>is anything like</em> a business owner.</p>
<blockquote><p>And no, the shareholders don’t own the corporation — they own securities that give them a not very well-defined stake in its earnings, and the freedom to flee with no responsibility for the corporation’s liabilities if things go pear-shaped.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Justin’s post — and the discussion with Felix Salmon — is well worth reading. I also especially liked the paper by Lynn Stout that Justin links to: “<a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=331464">Bad and Not-So-Bad Arguments For Shareholder Primacy</a>.”</p>
<p>Restating Justin somewhat, the key difference affecting incentives, from my perspective: The difficulty of exit for real business owners, and the time required to achieve it, is huge. Having sold quite a few businesses myself, I can assure you that it requires months or years of hard work. There’s real risk to the business associated with the process (revealing company secrets to other players, freaking out employees, suppliers, and customers). And the expected results, when you start the process, are deucedly uncertain.</p>
<p>By contrast, shareholders can exit with a few mouse clicks.</p>
<p>Because they can’t just walk away with their “share” of the business, instantly and effortlessly converted into cash, business owners have every incentive to keep all the stakeholders in the business — suppliers, creditors, employees, managers, customers — happy and working together. In short, maintaining and building a “going [and growing] concern.” For shareholders, those incentives are diluted to the point of nonexistence.</p>
<p>The notion that the ecosystem of modern business bears any relationship to Adam Smith’s village of butchers and bakers is profoundly deluded.</p>

<p>And presumably at some point Amazon can turn the prices-versus-market-share dial away from gaining market share/maximizing revenue and toward price and profits. Say they manage a 1% across-the-board price increase <em>with no decrease</em> in their roughly $50 billion in 2011 sales. That would add about $500 million to their $643 million in 2011 after-tax profits — a 77% increase.</p>
<p>That’s a pretty nice jump, but can they do it more than once?</p>
<p>And: assuming Amazon’s stock price remains unchanged, their profits have to grow by <em>1900%</em> to match Apple’s current PE ratio (which is also about what we’ve seen as a historical average ratio for U.S. equities in general).</p>
<p>Sure, we’ve been seeing 55-65% annual revenue growth from Amazon (excepting 2009), but at a steady 50% revenue growth rate it’s going to take them something like seven years to match Apple’s PE at the current Amazon share price, based on revenue growth alone. How confident does anyone feel in predicting that future?</p>
<p>Will Amazon have a trillion dollars in revenues seven years from now? Apple’s 2011 revenues were $108 billion…</p>
<p>Shortly after Amazon IPOed in the 90s I did the same kind of back-of-the-envelope calc, and realized that if they had $10 billion in sales — a 10x increase at the time — the stock price might be reasonable. It took them almost a decade get there — just to get to what <em>would have</em> been “reasonable” ten years earlier. This has been going on<em> for a very long time.</em></p>
<p>Is this time different?</p>
<p>Full disclosure: I’m long Apple. And I do most of my shopping on Amazon. Many thanks to all those Amazon share purchasers who have subsidized my lavish lifestyle.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>In June of 2008, Ron Paul made a <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2011/06/28/news/economy/ron_paul_bankruptcy/index.htm">radical proposal</a>: the Fed should simply burn all the U.S. Treasuries it’s currently holding, reducing the government (U.S. Treasury) debt by $1.6 trillion, or about 10%. (Yes: bonds held by the Fed are counted as part of “Debt Held by the Public,” even though the government basically “owns” the Fed.)</p>
<p>Paul called this “bankruptcy,” but it’s actually pure MMT thinking, acknowledging that 1. the Fed and the Treasury are most reasonably viewed as a single consolidated entity (“the government”), and 2. that government debt is something of a side issue in the big monetary picture (bonds are a vehicle for interest-rate management by the Fed), compared to the matter of central importance: how much newly created money the government puts into the economy by deficit spending, or takes out with a surplus (destroying more money by taxing than it creates by spending).</p>
<p>This is pretty radical talk, for sure. (I wonder if Paul and Kucinich ever eat lunch together.) But now Gavyn Davies <a href="http://blogs.ft.com/gavyndavies/2012/10/14/will-central-banks-cancel-government-debt/#axzz29I7ZFIiD">tells us</a> in the <em>Financial Times </em>that such notions are at least floating about in some decidedly traditional circles (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote><p>Two separate journalists (<a title="Robert Peston blog" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-19918332">Robert Peston of the BBC </a>and <a title="Simon Jenkins column" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/oct/09/iconoclast-for-bank-of-england">Simon Jenkins of The Guardian</a>) said that <strong>Lord Turner’s “private view” is that some part of the Bank’s gilts holdings might be cancelled in order to boost the economy.</strong> Lord Turner <a title="Reuters report of Turner remarks" href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/2012/10/13/britain-fsa-turner-idUKL5E8LD2QA20121013?feedType=RSS&#038;feedName=rbssFinancialServicesAndRealEstateNews">distanced himself</a> in public from this suggestion on Saturday. However, the notion will now be widely discussed. It is easy to see how the idea could appeal to a finance minister facing the need to tighten fiscal policy during a recession in order to bring down the public debt ratio. [that&#8217;s &#8220;Adair Turner, the Chairman of the UK Financial Services Agency, and reportedly a candidate to become the next Governor of the Bank of England.&#8221;]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Davies doesn’t like the idea (inflation worries), and apparently Lord Turner has his qualms as well. But the fact that these ideas are getting any consideration at all in the world of central banking is pretty radical in itself. Heck, the fact that Davies is even writing about it (and explaining it rather well, IMHO, with some caveats) speaks volumes. He has been, after all, a partner, Managing Director, Chief Economist, and Chairman of the Global Investment Research Department at Goldman, Sachs. Not your typical internet econocrank.</p>
<p>For those who follow these discussions, Davies’ two footnotes might be the most significant:</p>
<blockquote><p>[1] Similar proposals have however been widely debated by economists in the past. This goes back at least as far as the works of Abba Lerner in the 1940s on <a title="Lerner on functional finance" href="http://cas.umkc.edu/economics/people/facultyPages/wray/courses/Econ%20601/readings/lerner%20functional%20finance.pdf">“functional finance”</a> and the <a title="Lerner on money" href="http://esepuba.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/lerner.pdf">role of fiat money</a>. More recently, the Modern Monetary Theorists have reawakened Lerner’s ideas. See <a title="MMT explained in the WSJ" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/modern-monetary-theory-is-an-unconventional-take-on-economic-strategy/2012/02/15/gIQAR8uPMR_story.html">this explanation of MMT</a>, and <a title="Krugman on MMT" href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/25/deficits-and-the-printing-press-somewhat-wonkish/">Paul Krugman’s rejection of the approach</a> as being likely to lead to hyperinflation in the long run.</p>
<p>[2] Samuel Brittan makes the case that part of the budget deficit should be money financed in<a title="Samuel Brittan's column" href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/2ad55ea0-12e2-11e2-aa9c-00144feabdc0.html#axzz29GQeK8oI"> this column.</a> Martin Wolf makes a similar case in <a title="Martin Wolf column" href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/045aab84-e61c-11e0-960c-00144feabdc0.html#axzz29GQeK8oI">this column</a>. Both argue that money financing of deficits is preferable to “everlasting austerity and slump”.</p>
