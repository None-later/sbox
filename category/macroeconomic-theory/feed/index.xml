<p>Why Much of the Population Thinks Economists are Charlatans</p>
<p>Noah Smith asks <a href="http://noahpinionblog.blogspot.com/2013/01/why-do-people-think-economists-are.html">why people think economists are charlatans</a>.  He concludes it has something to do with trade.</p>
<p>I submit the answer is much, much simpler, and I think it deals with the part of economics which has most visibility with the public: macroeconomics.  Read <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2007/01/in-my-opinion-thomas-sowell-is-hack.html">this</a> <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2007/01/in-my-opinion-thomas-sowell-is-hack.html">post from a few years ago</a> about an economist who is reasonably prominent outside academia.  But it wouldn&#8217;t be difficult to make a list of other economists, whether with a bit of prominence outside academia or inside it or both, for whom one could write essentially<br />the same post.  Heck, if we wrote down a list of chairs of the President&#8217;s Council of Economic Advisors, budget directors, and Treasury Secretaries, how many of them couldn&#8217;t be the subject of that sort of post?  And let&#8217;s be realistic, there is no cost to doing so. Consider the folks  <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2007/11/surplus-deficit-and-recession-wondering.html">who</a> <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2007/11/surplus-deficit-and-recession-wondering.html">retroactively predicted double digit growth rates in 2002</a>.  None of them suffered consequences, regardless of the damage they caused.<br />None.</p>
<p>What happens if you do the same thing in another field?  What happens if to a guy who peddles Lysenkoism in Biology?  Think they&#8217;ll make him Dean of a prominent Medical School?  A physicist who makes her life<br />work debunking the Michelson Morley experiment ain&#8217;t gonna go far either.  Obvious charlatans in biology or physics or chemistry get treated like charlatans by people who call themselves biologists, physicists and chemists, even those who work in different parts of the field.  People who call themselves economists (whether macroeconomists or otherwise) sit on panels and attend conferences with the obvious charlatans.  They shake hands with the obvious charlatans, they don&#8217;t spit on the floor and turn their back on the obvious charlatans, and most damning of all, they don&#8217;t refer to them as obvious charlatans. And meanwhile, the obvious charlatans do very well.  Fudging and shading the data can pay very well, especially if one is well spoken and looks presentable.</p>
<p>The problem is, a career where it is easy and lucrative to be a charlatan, where being an obvious charlatan has no consequences or costs but plenty of benefits will attract more and more obvious charlatans.  In fact, there are a couple old principles in economics, from back in the day when the field wasn&#8217;t as infested that can tell  you what happens next.  We&#8217;re long past the point where the public has figured it out.  The only thing that will save the profession is if economists figured it out too.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>No, not <a href="http://www.eschatonblog.com/">Dr. Black’s blog</a>.  The <em>real </em>eschaton: the end of everything.  Or, in this case, its economics equivalent: the point at which almost all human work is no longer necessary but human beings still exist.
<p>The scenario is a simple one.  There are x humans on Earth (x>>1).  Self-repairing, recycling machines can provide all the needs and wants of those x people and then some.*  There is only one job humans need to do: every day, one person needs to press one button once&#8211;during a specific time period—to start the self-rebuilding and repairing of the machines.</p>
<p>Applying basic micro and macro economic theories, and assuming a money-using society, we can come to several stylized facts:</p>
<ol>
<li>This is the true case where Chamley (1995, 1996) applies.  The only capital created is exactly that that replaces current capital.  With no new capital, the effective tax rate on capital should be 0%.**     </li>
<li>The requirement that someone presses the button has two aspects:</li>
<ol>
<li>It is not required to be skilled labor</li>
<li>It is, however, essential labor</li>
</ol>
<li>In standard economic theory, the laborer is paid hisser Marginal Product</li>
<ol>
<li>The pressing of the button provides all of the goods to everyone for that day; since there is no MPK in this scenario, the MPL should equal the net profits from that day.</li>
<li>Pressing the button requires the laborer to choose to do the job instead of something more pleasant; therefore, they must be compensated to provide at least as much Utility as not pushing the button would provide them</li>
<li>For a sufficiently large population x, there may well be people who will not press the button in their lifetimes.  For even relatively large x, there will be people who will press the button less frequently than they will need to buy goods.</li>
<ol>
<li>In either of those scenarios—unless we consider Malthusian constraints necessary in a time of abundant plenty—any equilibrium condition will require that each person and any of hisser dependents be supported s.t. AD does not decline.</li>
</ol>
</ol>
</ol>
<p>The natural scenario for button-pushing selection is by lottery, which would also minimize the substitution effect. Some constraints would be required: may not repeat for at least z days, cannot sell/buyout of doing the job (though some intraweek switching possible), backup available in case of illness,*** etc.</p>
<p>What is interesting is the tax rate <em>t</em> required.  It is fairly easy to show that for even moderate populations, <em>t </em>must approach 100% if the laborer is indeed receiving the day’s MPL.****  This is in part because, since no new capital is being created, tax revenues from capital must approach 0%.</p>
<p>The problem then becomes one of Game Theory.  We know what the Final State must be if all activity leading up to it is rational.  The next question is how we get there.  But that will have to be deferred to my next post.</p>
<p>Enjoy the Holiday.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>*Excess capacity needs to be assumed if you assume humans are still breeding; that is, an additional y babies (y<<x) will neither strain resources nor have more than a marginal effect on AD.</p>
<p>**It is caddish of me to note that Chamley’s brilliant realization that has been the underpinning of several decades of freshwater economic theory is, of course, completely reflected in the U.S. tax code, where investment is offset directly by depreciation.</p>
<p>***Anyone who designs a non-redundant system with a Single Point of Failure should be shot. The applicability of this to economic models, and most especially microeconomic models, is left as an exercise to the reader.</p>
<p>****It is also intuitive that a large consumption tax would not be a reasonable substitute for such an income tax; even a “luxury tax” presents significant timing issues for even a small population.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>One could add a few names, and people did in comments.  One could also add a couple more thoughts  to Jonathon&#8217;s criterion, two of which could be admitting to mistakes and fixing parts of the model one is using if missed called, and a caveat around whether an economist could explain his/her model well and clearly after the biggest financial event in the world and history occurred (maybe not paying public attention?).</div>
<p>Jonathon Portes (micro) at  <i>Not the Treasury View</i> asks:<br />
<blockquote><a href="http://notthetreasuryview.blogspot.co.uk/2012/07/which-macro-economists-are-worth.html">Which (macro)-economists are worth listening to?</a><br />This post relates to the ongoing blog debate on &#8220;the state of macroeconomics&#8221;, which I contributed to<a href="http://notthetreasuryview.blogspot.co.uk/2012/06/macroeconomics-what-is-it-good-for.html"> here</a>, and which has drawn in a whole host of economics bloggers who know far more about modern macroeconomic theory than I do.  However, here I want to address a related, more mundane question, but one which is perhaps more relevant to most non-economists&#8217; concerns.   That is,  when economists argue about the correct stance of policy, who should we (policymakers, commentators, and the general public) listen to?</p>
<p>This question was prompted by a recent exchange I had with Ed Vaizey and Simon Hughes on the BBC&#8217;s Daily Politics: I pointed out that not only was the government&#8217;s decision in 2010 to cut the deficit too quickly doing considerable economic damage, but that this was both predictable and predicted by economists such as <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/06/06/lost-decade-here-we-come/">Paul Krugman </a>and <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/fc8d1dd4-78b6-11df-a312-00144feabdc0.html#axzz21NXABN3e">Martin Wolf</a>. Their response was essentially &#8220;how were we to know which economists to listen to? Others were saying the opposite&#8221;.</p>
<p>This is a fair question.  My answer to it is that policymakers and the public should listen to economists who fulfill two critera: first, they have made empirically testable predictions (conditional or unconditional &#8211; see Krugman <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/28/types-of-prediction/">here</a>) that have proved, by and large, to be broadly consistent with the data; and second, they base those predictions on an analytic framework (not necessarily a formal model) that is persuasive.  In other words, getting it right alone is not enough; it should be possible to show your workings &#8211; to explain why you got it right. Otherwise, your predictions may be interesting, but they tell you little about how to formulate policy.  (bolding mine&#8230;Rdan)<a name="more"></a><br />My shortlist (apologies in advance to those I&#8217;ve omitted) of economists commenting on macroeconomic policy who I think qualify is something like the following:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/05/02/liquidity-preference-loanable-funds-and-niall-ferguson-wonkish/">Krugman</a>, <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/f74bb844-9369-11df-bb9a-00144feab49a.html#axzz222aqYe17">Delong</a> and Wren-Lewis on fiscal policy when interest rates are at the zero lower bound;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Adam <a href="http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/speeches/2010/speech449.pdf">Posen</a> on monetary policy when interest rates are at the zero lower bound;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-05-13/euro-has-no-future-without-a-political-union-commentary-by-paul-de-grauwe.html">Paul de Grauwe</a> on sovereign and eurozone debt;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/fc8d1dd4-78b6-11df-a312-00144feabdc0.html#axzz21NXABN3e">Martin Wolf</a> on private sector savings and public sector deficits (the financial balance approach);</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/richard-koo-recession-2010-4?op=1">Richard Koo</a> on the implications of a &#8220;balance sheet recession&#8221;</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/13/microfoundations-micro-payoffs-wonkish/">Paul Krugman</a> notes Angry Bear Robert Waldmann in the micro/macro conversation in the New York Times: <br />
<blockquote>There has been an ongoing discussion in the econoblogosphere about the usefulness or lack thereof of “microfoundations” in macroeconomics, which in practice means trying to write down models in which aggregate behavior is justified in terms of the actions of utility-maximizing individuals with rational expectations.<br /> &#8230; </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>But bear in mind what we’ve actually seen in academic economics: the development of an ethos in which only microfounded models are considered “real” theory, in which it’s basically impossible to publish a paper unless it’s intertemporal optimization all the way. That’s the kind of dominance a theory is only entitled to if it produces dramatically better predictions than the theory it has crowded out<br />&#8230; </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Wren-Lewis says he disagrees, but as <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/03/very-rude-comments.html">Robert Waldmann says</a>, his examples offer <a href="http://mainlymacro.blogspot.com/2012/03/what-have-microfoundations-ever-done.html">very thin gruel</a>. The failure of the commodity price shock to filter into wider inflation? Lots of people predicted this without any appeal to microfoundations, just the observation that wage contracts were no longer indexed and oil as a share of GDP was lower than in the 70s. </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>The basic picture is that we’ve seen a more or less complete takeover of macro by an approach that hasn’t remotely earned the right to that kind of dominance.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://noahpinionblog.blogspot.com/2012/03/thursday-roundup-3152012.html" target="_blank">Noah Smith</a> at <i>Noahpinion</i> has an impressive listing on Thursday&#8217;s Roundup of the many involved in the conversation:</p>
<blockquote><p>This week in econ: A bunch of people are talking about philosophy-of-macroeconomics, which I like&#8230;things like microfoundations, rational expectations, bounded rationality, learning, and untested hypotheses. This is just my kind of nerdery! Elsewhere, people are arguing about monetary policy even more than usual. It&#8217;s another day in the ER&#8230;er&#8230;econosphere.. </p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With apologies to <a href="http://capitalgainsandgames.com/search/node/BTW">Stan Collender’s Beautiful and Talented Wife</a> (not to mention mine):</p>
<blockquote><p>James had gathered a mix of friends, acquaintances, and random strangers at his Rent Party, but no one was talking to anyone else. So he decided to get people to talk to each other, using the easiest non-visible variable available:<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;Don, what’s your IQ?&#8221;<br />&#8220;171.&#8221;<br />&#8220;Sharon, what’s your IQ&#8221;<br />&#8220;169.&#8221;<br />&#8220;Maybe you should take with Don&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>James watched as Sharon and Don began a discussion of elementary particle theory, astrophysics, and <a href="http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/5cfe15e0-4cca-11e1-8741-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1ldSzrjJa" target="_blank">Ken Rogoff’s chess games</a>.</p>
<p>Encouraged, James continued his efforts.<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;Lynn, what’s your IQ?&#8221; &#8220;151&#8221;<br />&#8220;Jorge, what’s your IQ?&#8221;<br />&#8220;149.&#8221;<br />&#8220;You should talk with Lynn.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>And they were soon discussing the biophysics of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteriorhodopsin" target="_blank">bacteriorhodopsin</a> and <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/HilbertSpace.html" target="_blank">Hilbert Space</a>.</p>
<p>Thrilled this was working so well, James tried again.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Steve, what’s your IQ?&#8221; <br />&#8220;51.&#8221;<br />&#8220;Lucy, what’s your IQ?&#8221; &#8220;49.&#8221;<br />&#8220;You two should probably talk,&#8221; James said.</p></blockquote>
<p>Lucy turned to Steve, &#8220;So where do you teach <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/06/anti-keynesian-revisionism/">Real Business Cycle Theory</a>?&#8221; (h/t <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2012/02/old-versus-new-keynesian-models.html">Mark Thoma</a>)</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Derek Thompson at <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2011/10/what-does-a-us-worker-really-cost/247028/">The Atlantic</a> had some thoughts on labor cost and economics taken from Henry Blodgett&#8217;s observation on declining wages for most wage earners.  The second paragraph caught my eye as interesting for economists.  </p>
</p>
<blockquote><p>My <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2011/10/who-really-robbed-the-middle-class-maybe-it-was-health-care/246606/">response</a> was that Blodget was macro-right &#8212; income inequality is a serious and growing problem &#8212; but micro-wrong, because this graph is measuring wages rather than full compensation. Total compensation &#8212; that&#8217;s wages plus benefits and taxes &#8212; hasn&#8217;t changed very much as a share of the economy since 1960, according to data from the National Institute of Pensions Administrators. What&#8217;s changed is that benefits and taxes have gone up, and wages have gone down.</p>

<li>Net Exports goes negative in 1973 and never recovers.  One word: oil.  Even the USD depreciation after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaza_Accord">the Plaza Accord</a> (the one Martin Feldstein <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=c7b-lYM_-TcC&#038;pg=PA824&#038;lpg=PA824&#038;dq=Feldstein+1980s&#038;source=bl&#038;ots=N-wEPFzHkm&#038;sig=kNDeb8XPCEt8DmDfVhzH17GtVBw&#038;hl=en#v=onepage&#038;q&#038;f=false">likes to pretend was inevitably going to happen then</a>) can&#8217;t quite get it back to being positive. And once outsourcing industry to China hits full stride&#8230;</p>
</li>
<li>Private Investment peaks in 2006. Dating the start of the <s>current</s> recession from December of 2007 still strikes me as being six months late.
</li>
<li>Consumption goes up fairly steadily from 1981, encompassing 8% more of total GDP—around a 12% increase over less than thirty years.  Coincidentally, the Reagan Revolution moves taxes more heavily onto consumers at the same time.  (Note that only about half of the appreciation in consumption is reflected in the change in Net Exports.)
</li>
<li>Government spending declines starting around 1991, when the Real George (H.W.) Bush breaks his &#8220;no nude Texans&#8221; pledge.  The era of Big Government remains over until George &#8220;<a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2006/10/giorgios_tyrann.html">Dad&#8217;s Rolodex Got Me Another Job I Can Screw Up</a>&#8221; (W.) Bush desperately needed people to be employed:</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Brad DeLong <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2011/10/is-lm-watch-in-the-country-of-the-one-eyed-the-self-blinded-man-is-in-bad-shape-department.html">has a spat with Scott Sumner</a>:</p>
<blockquote><blockquote>The IS-LM model led economic historians to argue money was easy in 1929-30, because rates fell sharply. It led modern Keynesians to assume that money was easy in 2008, because rates fell sharply&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, I would say that not just &#8220;modern Keynesians&#8221; but a lot of people believed that monetary policy was expansionary in 2008.</p>
<p>They believed so not just because (safe) nominal (and real) interest rates were falling, but because the money supply was expanding. Indeed, since 2007 the Federal Reserve has tripled the monetary base</p></blockquote>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>But there remains a reason I suggest that cutting off Tim Geithner&#8217;s (and/or Ben Bernanke&#8217;s) private parts, stuffing them into his mouth, and perp-walking him publicly down Dewy Square* would be a good re-election move for the Obama Administration, and it comes back to basic economics. Specifically, Brad DeLong&#8217;s favorite monetary equation</p>
<p>
<blockquote>MV = PY</p></blockquote>
<p>Now, most of the time, we derive V—Velocity. We kinda sorta hafta. The velocity of money is not something that you really observe directly; to solve the equation for V(i), we have to know Y, P, and M.</p>
<p>But then we&#8217;re making assumptions about them. Two of them are probably reasonable:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>Y = GDP (or GNP if you add in XM, but let&#8217;s not). We shorthand this as &#8220;aggregate output.&#8221; Even if we weren&#8217;t pretending it&#8217;s constant in the short-term, we can fairly well define this and hold to the definition. GDP=GDP, as it were.</p>
<p>P = Price Level. This is slightly more difficult conceptually, because we aren&#8217;t going to include everything. But if we assume (short-term) that the &#8220;market basket&#8221; is constant (or at least fungible**), we can come up with a representative index level and just treat this as &#8220;inflation.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The third, however, is more problematic:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>M is the Base Money Supply, <em>which is circulating</em>.</p></blockquote>
<p>Recall that V = Velocity, or, the number of times in a year that a dollar is spent, a definition that led to Keynes&#8217;s observation that V isn&#8217;t so much a constant (pace Fisher) as dependent on interest rates—V(i). This doesn&#8217;t (or, more accurately, shouldn&#8217;t) change much in the short-term, even at the zero-bound.</p>
<p>But &#8220;velocity&#8221; assumes money is circulating, which why it is multiplied by the Monetary Base from the start. If the monetary base has all the mobility of an overBotoxed actor&#8217;s face, we&#8217;re going to have a problem. I would call the following graphic &#8220;Where&#8217;s the Real Increase in the Monetary Base?&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-uYr4lzQEQBg/TpDpoHlYIII/AAAAAAAAAmA/cUkphxKcFTI/s1600/BASE%2Band%2BEXCRESNS.PNG"><img border="0" alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-uYr4lzQEQBg/TpDpoHlYIII/AAAAAAAAAmA/cUkphxKcFTI/s320/BASE%2Band%2BEXCRESNS.PNG"></a></p>
<p>The above graphic is Ben Bernanke&#8217;s fault. And even Brad DeLong knows this. The proof below the fold.</p>
<p>Or, at least, he strongly suggests he does, <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2011/10/david-wessel-on-what-the-fed-might-do-and-i-think-ought-to-have-already-done.html">citing WSJ columnist David Wessel</a>:</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote><p>The Fed is not out of ammo, the economists at the Bank Credit Analyst insist&#8230;</p>
<p>The three:</p>
<blockquote><p>Target a higher inflation rate or pre-specified level for the consumer price index or nominal gross domestic product. Problem: &#8220;could undermine the Fed’s long-standing commitment to price stability.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stimulate bank lending by putting a tax on excess reserves, hoping that banks will the lend out the money if the have to pay borrowers to take the loans. Problem: &#8220;could lead to the collapse of money market funds and the disintermediation of the financial system.&#8221;</p>
<p>Buy corporate debt, equities, real estate or foreign currency. Problem: Could require an act of Congress. &#8220;Given that the U.S. economy remains stuck in a liquidity trap,&#8221; Berezin concludes, &#8220;fiscal policy would be the most straightforward way to stimulate….However, the likelihood that the U.S. will receive major fiscal stimulus anytime soon is close to zero.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m not sanguine about the latter. Even absent economic issues (which are minimal in the current environment), the political ones are problematic.*** That it makes more sense than telling people to put their money into a 401(k) that consists 90% of company stock is a low bar to jump. On the other hand, buying Yuan until it has to appreciate is worth exploring.</p>
<p>The first has been getting traction for years. And I admit I can&#8217;t decide who was stupider: the people who set a 2% target on no evidence (sorry, <a href="http://macroblog.typepad.com/macroblog/2010/02/do-we-need-to-rethink-macroeconomic-policy.html">David</a>, I held to this even after reading <a href="http://www.imf.org/External/Pubs/FT/staffp/2001/01a/pdf/khan.pdf">your</a> <a href="http://imf.org/external/Pubs/FT/staffp/1998/12-98/pdf/ghosh.pdf">cites</a>) or the people who decided a &#8220;2% target&#8221; meant &#8220;<=." It now has enough traction that it will get out of the avalanche about the time the snow melts. So that leaves the second one. Which brings us back to the Monetary Equation problem. Recall that the definition of Velocity is "the number of times in a year that a dollar is spent." I buy something at the Dollar Store, they use that dollar to buy more products and pay employees, the suppliers and employees buy more supplies and other products, respectively, etc.**** So Brad DeLong ("I see no risks in attempting any of these three--and great risks in continuing to dither") agrees with Peter Berezin of Bank Credit Analyst (and me) that we don't want banks holding Excess Reserves as a matter of monetary policy at the zero bound. Fundamental principle of economics: you want to tax things you wish to discourage. You want to subsidize things you wish to encourage. As the Rabbi once said, "All else is commentary." So what did the Federal Reserve do <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20081006a.htm">in the face of a desperate attempt from the Fed to stimulate the Base Money Supply</a>?</p>
<blockquote><p>The Financial Services Regulatory Relief Act of 2006 originally authorized the Federal Reserve to begin paying interest on balances held by or on behalf of depository institutions beginning October 1, 2011. The recently enacted Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 accelerated the effective date to October 1, 2008.</p>
<p>Employing the accelerated authority, the Board has approved a rule to amend its Regulation D (Reserve Requirements of Depository Institutions) to direct the Federal Reserve Banks to pay interest on required reserve balances (that is, balances held to satisfy depository institutions&#8217; reserve requirements) and on excess balances (balances held in excess of required reserve balances and clearing balances).</p></blockquote>
<p>this lead to something that will surprise no economist of any caliber, let alone a Professor at Princeton:</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-RMKFhaA4Ksw/TpEA1b5vxGI/AAAAAAAAAmQ/lxm-s5XYjIc/s1600/image003.jpg"><img border="0" alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-RMKFhaA4Ksw/TpEA1b5vxGI/AAAAAAAAAmQ/lxm-s5XYjIc/s320/image003.jpg"></a></p>
<p>By the time of the stimulus, roughly that amount had been taken out of circulation as the change in Excess Reserves. Even if every cent had been well-allocated, it was already out of circulation.</p>
<p>Ben Bernanke giveth, but Ben Bernanke taketh away even more, in spades.</p>
<p>What Monetary Stimulus?</p>
<p>*Again, I don&#8217;t encourage this action. But if you think I can&#8217;t create or find a suggestion for each of the Occupy locations, you haven&#8217;t read and seen enough Jacobean drama.</p>
<p>**Whether we replace my wife&#8217;s three-year old mobile with either a &#8220;free&#8221; Droid or a &#8220;free&#8221; iPhone 3GS probably doesn&#8217;t have a significant effect. Economists pretend that the &#8220;steak-chicken&#8221; model is similar.</p>
<p>***Short version: You think the tempest-in-a-teapot that is Solyndra is getting discussion? Try that times ten when three or four REITs and a few companies go under. (Amazingly, those who complain about the &#8220;low&#8221; return on Government securities also loudly complain when the Government invests in non-risk-free securities.)</p>
<p>****It is left as a side-note that increasing the Velocity of Money is yet another way to reduce tax rates, all else equal. It is also left as a side-note that people who talk about &#8220;double taxation&#8221; of (voluntarily disbursed) dividends are economic ignoramuses, and that there are many economists who talk in that manner in no way invalidates the first half of this sentence.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Talk is called &#8220;<a href="http://www.debtdeflation.com/blogs/2011/09/16/new-york-talk-roosevelt-hotel-friday-23rd/">Neat, Plausible, and Wrong: the Deluded Discipline of Economics</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>I have to quibble with the &#8220;plausible&#8221; portion: there is no possible way to rationalize contemporary Microeconomics with any reasonable conceit that the Macroeconomics produced are &#8220;first-best&#8221; or anything similar.*</p>
<p>I doubt I&#8217;ll be there at 5:00, but certainly by 6:00.  Hope to see some of you there.</p>
<p>Any questions for Professor Keen can be emailed to me or put in comments.</p>
<p>*This may be the root of my disagreement with Brad DeLong, who learned Macro and Micro when it was still possible—barely—to envision a GUT of Economics, even in a (weak form, as it were) Arrow-Debreu world.  In the past thirty years, the strange delusion that Arrow-Debreu actually <em>reflects</em> the world has come to dominant Micro—with the rather predictable adverse consequence that Macro has to be more-than-the-sum-of-the-parts—i.e., include a positive social aspect—to be the best of all posible current worlds. But a positive social aspect is not part of the NeoKeynesian** cant, so you end up, effectively, declaring (for instance) that Gary Becker is wrong and discrimination is a beneficial business practice.</p>
<p>**As I have noted before, in economics the phrase &#8220;neo&#8221; is added to the front of a word if you are putting forth a belief set that is diametrically opposed to what came before: neoClassical and neoKeynesian are the most obvious examples of this.</p>
