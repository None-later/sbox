                                <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amity_Shlaes">Amity Shlaes</a>, the <a href="http://chronicle.com/blognetwork/edgeofthewest/2009/04/23/how-denialism-works/">disinformation bunny</a>, is still going.  In the latest issue of <i>Imprimus</i>, a publication of <a href="http://www.hillsdale.edu//">Hillsdale College</a>, is a transcript adapted from a recent talk she gave there during a conference on the Income Tax, sponsored by Hillsdale&#8217;s own <a href="http://www.hillsdale.edu/seminars/oncampus/cca/default.asp">Center for Constructive Alternatives</a> and the <a href="http://mises.org/media/categories/160/Lecture-Series">Ludwig von Mises Lecture Series</a>.  Right away, you know this is going to be good.  The Title of her contribution is <a href="http://www.hillsdale.edu/news/imprimis.asp"><u>Calvin Coolidge and the Moral Case for Economy</u></a>.  Of course, by economy, she means austerity.</p>
<p>There is so much wrong here it&#8217;s both impressive and depressing.  Rather than give her the full<a href="http://www.ginandtacos.com/index.php?s=fjm"> FJM treatment</a>,  which would take more time and energy than she deserves, I&#8217;ll just hit  on a couple of the lowlights.  Here is her opening paragraph.</p>
<blockquote><p>With  the Federal debt spiraling out of control, many Americans sense an  urgent need to find a political leader who is able to say &#8220;no&#8221; to  spending.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here we go. Her first sentence is an exercise in made-up right-wing talking point mythology.  I&#8217;ve already exploded the &#8216;<i>Obama is a profligate spender</i>&#8221; myth, <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/09/a-quick-look-at-federal-spending.html">here</a>, <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/09/why-spendinggdp-is-terrible-horrible-no.html">here</a>, and <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/09/yes-right-wing-lies-when-they-say-obama.html">here</a>. Further, we have just lived through three years when federal spending was close to flat line, as Graph 1 shows.   </p>
<p>

<div> Graph 1 &#8211; Flat Federal Spending Under Obama  </div>
<p>There   is only one comparable period in post WW II history, 1953-56, during  Eisenhower&#8217;s first term, as shown in Graph 2.   Still, over Ike&#8217;s full  term, spending grew by about 30%.</p>
<p>
<div><a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fredgraph.png?g=gwU"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fredgraph.png?g=gwU" width="400"></a></div>
<div> Graph 2  Not So Flat Spending Growth Under Eisenhower (&#8217;53-&#8217;60)</div>
<p>To  suggest that federal dept is now  &#8220;spiraling out of control&#8221; due to excessive spending is not merely  disingenuous.  It is a sign that either Shlaes has no earthly idea what  she&#8217;s talking about, which in an alleged journalist, is unforgivable, or  it&#8217;s a bare-faced lie, which is unforgivable for anybody.  And if many  Americans are feeling the urgent need to curtail government spending, it&#8217;s because  they have been lied to so repeatedly and often that <a href="http://maddowblog.msnbc.com/_news/2013/02/22/17056939-a-well-kept-fiscal-secret?lite">they have no idea what the truth is</a>.  As <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/10/attack-of-the-trust-fund-zombie/?gwh=AB363FEF15056F07526B7216D6409BAD">Krugman recently put it</a>: &#8220;<i>And I have to say, it’s extremely telling that conservative Republicans  don’t seem able to make their case without resorting, right from the  beginning, to obviously dumb fallacies</i>.&#8221;  The truth is that if we have a debt problem, it is due to <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2013/01/another-look-at-spending-and-revenues.html">a shortfall in revenues</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Yet they fear that finding such a leader is impossible.</p></blockquote>
<p>Its  not clear who made Shlaes the spokesperson for this sorry,  disenfranchised segment of the population, nor that this is indeed what  they fear.  Perhaps we should introduce Shlaes and the rest of these  Real Americans to the <i>real</i> President B. Hoover Obama.</p>
<blockquote><p>Conservatives long for another Ronald Reagan.</p></blockquote>
<p>This  is probably correct, though as Shlaes goes on to demonstrate,  conservatives in this way &#8211; and, alas, right-wingers almost always &#8211; are rather badly  disconnected from reality.</p>
<blockquote><p>He  was of course a tax cutter, reducing the top marginal rate from 70 to  28 percent.  But his tax cuts &#8211; which vindicated supply side economics  by vastly increasing federal revenue &#8211; were bought partly through a  bargain with Democrats who were eager to spend that revenue.</p></blockquote>
<p>Wrong again.  The reality is that <a href="http://jazzbumpa.blogspot.com/2010/02/taxes-and-revenues.html">Revenue growth under Reagan was the worst</a> of any 20th century President, post Eisenhower, except for the  unfortunate Bush, Sr. under who&#8217;s recession plagued regime Reagan&#8217;s buzzards came home to  roost. And was it really the Democrats who spent that anemic revenue  stream, or did it go to Reagan&#8217;s Star Wars fantasy?</p>
<blockquote><p>Reagan was no budget cutter.  In fact, the federal budget grew over a third during his administration.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here, she finally gets something right, if by &#8220;federal budget&#8221; she means Total Outlays, and by &#8220;over a third&#8221; <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/Historicals">she means over 80%</a>  [as measured from 1980 to 1988.]</p>
<p>Things get really egregious further on in the section titled &#8220;<i>The Purpose of Tax Cuts.</i>&#8221;   She informs us that President Coolidge and Treasury Secretary Andrew  Mellon campaigned to lower top rates from the 50&#8217;s to the 20&#8217;s.</p>
<blockquote><p>Mellon  and Coolidge did not win all they sought.  The top rate of the final  law was in the forties.  But even this reduction yielded results &#8211; more  money flowing into the treasury &#8211; suggesting that &#8220;scientific taxation&#8221;  worked.  By 1926, Coolidge was able to sign legislation that brought the  top marginal rate down to 25%, and do so retroactively.</p></blockquote>
<p>I  was surprised to learn that Coolidge and Mellon had anticipated the  Laffer curve by 6 decades.  Let&#8217;s have a look at how more money flowed  into the treasury. In 1922 and &#8217;23, with a <a href="http://www.ntu.org/tax-basics/history-of-federal-individual-1.html">top marginal rate of 56%</a>, <a href="http://www.usgovernmentrevenue.com/revenue_chart_1915_1930USb_13s1li011mcn_10f30f40f50f60f_Federal_Revenue_By_Type#copypaste">tax revenues were $2.23 and 1.69 billion respectively</a>.  [Per FRED, 1923 was a recession year]  In 1924, with a top rate of 46%,  total revenues were $1.79 billion.  This is what Shleas calls &#8220;more  money flowing into the treasury.&#8221;  Here&#8217;s a bigger picture look.  In 1920, when <a href="http://elsa.berkeley.edu/~saez/course/Labortaxes/taxableincome/taxableincome_attach.pdf">the top marginal rate was 73%</a>,  receipts were slightly over $4 billion.  In 1925, when the top marginal  rate  was 25%, receipts were $1.7 billion, less than half of the 1920 value,  and by 1929 had only increased to 2.23 billion.  Graph 3 shows revenues  per year [Coolidge&#8217;s term highlighted in red,] and belies Shlaes&#8217;  assertion.</p>

<p>Graph  4 shows a scatter plot of this same data, with revenues as a function  of top marginal rate, Coolidge years are again highlighted in red.</p>

<div>Graph 4 Top Marginal Rate and Tax Revenues, 1915-1930</div>
<p>A  best fit straight line is included.  There&#8217;s lots of scatter, for a  variety of reasons, but the upward trend &#8211; the exact opposite of Shleas&#8217;  assertion, is obvious.</p>
<p>So here&#8217;s the reality.  A  decade of tax cutting and deregulation led  us into the Great Depression, the worst economic collapse of the 20th  century. [You might note that the following decades of high tax rates  and robust regulation were free of these horrible events.]  And what  happened most recently?  A decade of tax cuts and deregulation &#8211; the end  game of three decades of this supply-side approach &#8211; led to the  greatest economic collapse since the Great Depression.  Significantly,  the major deregulations of big finance, including the repeal of  Glass-Steagall came at the end of Clinton&#8217;s  term, less than a decade prior to the financial melt down.  Last Friday  on his radio show, Thom Hartmann pointed out that prior to the  regulations put in place in the 30&#8217;s, the U.S. had never gone for more  than 15 years without a major financial collapse.  So this result should  have been expected.</p>
<p>The  extraordinary thing isn&#8217;t that right wingers lie.  The simple reality  is that they can&#8217;t make their case without lying, because it has no  merit.  The extraordinary thing is that their lies are so easily rooted  out and refuted, in the era of free and easily accessible information,  but so few people will take the required few minutes to go ahead and do  it. Sadly, whenever the truth comes up against a cascade of lies, <a href="http://www.juliansanchez.com/2009/04/06/climate-change-and-argumentative-fallacies/">the liars have a significant tactical advantage</a>.  </p>
<p>Shlaes&#8217; presentation is just one more  manifestation of the right wing ploy of denying reality.   Sadly, it  works, because you really can fool a lot of the people a lot of the  time.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <div>A good friend and I got into an email debate.  He sent me the latest message regarding how wonderful it is that Florida is going to be drug testing welfare recipients.  I responded that I&#8217;ll consider the policy when we start testing all the CEO&#8217;s who get welfare for their sector of the economy, the lawyers, judges and all country club members.   </div>
<div></div>
<div>I also noted welfare is not the problem  He noted it&#8217;s not “the” problem, but it is “a” problem and he knows this from talking to people.  I know of welfare too.  I have served on two nonprofit boards, one for substance abuse and the other The Providence Center.  My family adopted a family when I was in junior high.  We had foster children.  I was a day counselor for 2 weeks in the summer of &#8217;73 for 7 to 12 year olds from 3 of the most horrible housing developments in the city of Providence.  We had the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchman_Institute">“Institute”</a> literally right around the corner from where I lived.  My daughter is doing a year with <a href="http://www.nw.org/network/index.asp">NeighborWorks America</a>.  </div>
<div></div>
<div>Welfare is not the problem.  But, my friend is a very smart person and an engineer, so I needed some numbers.  Using <a href="http://www.usgovernmentdebt.us/year_spending_2008USbn_13bs1n_40#usgs302">this site</a> I checked out what the ratio of spending on Family and Children and Housing is to our GDP. I used GDP and not the overall budget because hey, we all worked to earn that money and it might as well be used for something that is heart warming.  The following numbers are total national spending (Fed, State, Local).</div>
<div></div>
<p><a name="more"></a>
<div>The year 1962 is the first year that there is spending listed for both Family and Children and Housing.  Prior to that only Housing is listed as having spending. For 1962, the combined total ratio was 0.0027.  That is 0.27% of our GDP was spend on families, children and housing.  I started with 1970 and went forward using the endings of the presidential terms starting with 1980.</div>
<div>1970:   0.0035</div>
<div>1980:   0.0092</div>
<div>1988:   0.0093</div>
<div>1992:   0.0134</div>
<div>2000:   0.0092</div>
<div>2008:   0.0097</div>
<div>2010:   0.0141</div>
<div></div>
<div>First of all, these are miniscule percentages of our GDP.  Second, it sure looks to me like the best way to solve the “welfare problem” is to solve the economic problem.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Of course, this means nothing if we don&#8217;t have other government spending patterns to compare too.  I mean, how do we know if welfare is “out of control” if we can&#8217;t compare it to other spending?  The same data set has two other categories: General Government and Other Spending.  You can click on each to see the sub categories.  But, just so you know General Government consists of Executive and Legislative organ, Financial and General services.  Other does not include: Pensions, Education, Health, Defense, Protection, Transportation or interest.  Other is just that: Other.  Here is how the numbers look.</div>
<div></div>

<div>  </div>
<div>This is how the numbers flow as log function.</div>
<div><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-q_Ww0EO90A8/TziVdkLMeTI/AAAAAAAAASA/vycHbhD4Ud0/s1600/Welfare+graph+post+2-12-12.JPG" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="245" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-q_Ww0EO90A8/TziVdkLMeTI/AAAAAAAAASA/vycHbhD4Ud0/s320/Welfare+graph+post+2-12-12.JPG" width="320"></a></div>
<div></div>
<p>  
<div>Call me stupid, but it looks to me like what we spend on welfare is not much more than what the  government is spending on just doing the government thingy, unless of course people can&#8217;t get a job.  Interestingly enough, the share of GDP spent on welfare in 1992 and 2010 is the same.  In fact, at the peak of unemployment of the 2001 recession which was 2003, we spent just 0.0098 on welfare.    </div>
<div></div>
<div>Here is another comparison.  In 2009 we spent $167 billion on Family/Children and Housing.  That year, we also spent $161 billion in the Other category of “Economic Affairs”.  I don&#8217;t know what that is, but if it has anything to do with what we are experiencing I don&#8217;t think we got our money&#8217;s worth.  This item went from -7.0 in 1997 to 7.8 in 2002 to 17.5 in 2005 to 1.3 in 2007 back to 17.7 in 2008.  It landed at -79.7 in 2010.  Hummmmmmmmm.  I think Glen Beck would like this category.  You know, who&#8217;s been playing with the money in the cookie jar?  In fact, why did we not know that a cookie jar exists?  </div>
<div></div>
<div>It doesn&#8217;t make me feel good to think that we spend about as much on the top office operations of this country as we spend on helping people.  Think about it.  What percentage of the “welfare problem” do</div>
<div></div>
<div>you believe is a problem? You know those drug addled lazy moochers who are preventing all us moral and hardworking folks from living the good life of our congress persons.  Be careful now.  This is a trick question.  See, it won&#8217;t take much of a “problem” subtracted from what we spend to find ourselves spending less to take care of families and their children than we spend on the top office operations in this nation.  That&#8217;s just plain being cheap.  Down right, out and out cheap SOB&#8217;s even if we leave in all of the &#8220;problem&#8221;.     </div>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>In case you are not aware, Bill Moyers is back and he doing his best work to date concentrating on our the changing of the rules regarding the economy.  <a href="http://billmoyers.com/episode/full-show-how-big-banks-are-rewriting-the-rules-of-our-economy/">This episode</a> where he interviews John Reed, former Citi Bank CEO and current MIT chair is most telling as it relates to the issue of why we as a nation need to do what is required by law: investigate and prosecute as the investigations dictate.</p>
<p>First, let me just say, you need to watch the interview.  What is most telling for me is the denial that still exists in Mr. Reed.  Sure, he acknowledges that it all went wrong, but it is done in the temperance of “mistake”: <br />
<blockquote>
<blockquote>1. an error in action, calculation, opinion, or judgment caused by poor reasoning, carelessness, insufficient knowledge, etc. <br />2. a misunderstanding  or misconception.</p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Here, in the interview is what puts the delusion of self preservation in applying the word “mistake” to the decisions that lead to what we have today, and I&#8217;m not just talking recession:<br />
<blockquote>Setting up the question to Mr. Reed by showing a video clip, SENATOR BYRON DORGAN: (Speaking on Senate Floor) What does it mean if we have all this concentration and merger activity? Well, the bigger they are, the less likely this government can allow them to fail.<br />BILL MOYERS: Were you aware of the few senators who raised real concerns about removing Glass-Steagall, about what would happen?<br />JOHN REED: <i>No one that I’m aware of it saw it clearly. </i>You point out to some Senators and Congressmen who did, but somehow we described them peripheral. And I simply said, “They’re wrong.” Turned out they weren’t.<br />SENATOR BYRON DORGAN: (Speaking on Senate Floor) I think we will in ten years’ time look back and say, “We should not have done that, because we forgot the lessons of the past.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The issue of calling it a “mistake” becomes even clearer when you watch the interview of Senator Dorgan which follows Mr. Reed. This is why you need to watch it.  Mr Reed knows what happened.  He knows why it happened.  I am certain he knows where the culpability lays.  But, as they say in our neck of the woods: He wouldn&#8217;t say “shit” even if he had a mouthful.</p>
<p>What happened and what these people did was not a benign experience as the word “mistake” implies and as Mr. Reed is using it.  It was intentional and wanton action taken on behalf of money. (See below: Where their heads were at)</p>
<p><a name="more"></a>Explaining Glass Steagall&#8217;s importance beyond not letting commercial banking marry investment banking.</p>
<blockquote><p>JOHN REED: Well, that and even more importantly, or equally importantly, since the FDIC came into existence at approximately a similar time where the government was guaranteeing deposits so that people didn&#8217;t lose if a bank got into trouble.
<div>But not only did they want to keep the banks from the business for reasons of not risking the money. They didn&#8217;t want them to use the guarantee that the government provided for those deposits to leverage their position. <i>Because, you know, if you have a deposit base that&#8217;s guaranteed by the government, it sure puts you at a great advantage in terms of going into the market and playing around.</i></div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>Regarding the take down of Glass Steagall</div>
<p>
<blockquote>JOHN REED: When Sandy approached me on the merger [Travelers/Citi] I knew that it was right on the forefront of the legal thing. &#8230; <i>And what we basically were told was, &#8220;If you all want to do this within the two years we&#8217;ll get the law changed.&#8221;</i><br />BILL MOYERS: But you got the blessing in this two-year period of President Clinton, of the Fed, of&#8211;<br />JOHN REED: <i><u>We had that blessing prior to. </u></i><br />JOHN REED: Yes. In other words, I went with Sandy to call on Chairman Greenspan. We told him we were contemplating this merger. <i>But that it would required that the Fed would be prepared to grant us permission. And we were assured that they would.</i><br />We went and saw the Chairman of the House Banking Committee, the Chairman of the Senate Banking Committee. And we said we&#8217;re talking about this merger but it could not take place if we were not assured that it would be approved at the Congressional level. We talked to the Secretary of the Treasury, I don&#8217;t recall&#8211;<br />BILL MOYERS: Robert Rubin? He was the Secretary of the Treasury at the time.  <br />JOHN REED: Yeah, we would&#8217;ve spoken to him, I&#8217;m sure. And had Bob Rubin said, &#8220;No, the Treasury feels this is wrong,&#8221; we would&#8217;ve been careful. Because obviously, the Treasury recommends to the President on an issue of this sort.<i> And there was no argument. No one said, “We’ll have to think about it.” And so a consensus built up.</i> I don’t think it started in the Fed. I would guess it started in the industry, it certainly got into the Congress.  </p></blockquote>
<p>Regarding where their heads were at</p>
<blockquote><p>JOHN REED: Which happened, yeah. I mean if you had asked me under oath, what probability I would have given that you would have gotten the whole group of Wall Street participants to get it wrong so to speak, I would have said zero.<br />BILL MOYERS: What do you think they saw that Wall Street didn&#8217;t see?<br />JOHN REED: <i>They simply didn&#8217;t participate in the exuberance. </i><br />But I do think that, you know, this setting up the deck of cards so that we could produce what we currently are trying to withdraw from. <i>Turns out to have been something that the word disaster is maybe not strong enough. (“Criminal” is the word we all know he is resisting.)</i><br />JOHN REED: <i>We were carried away by the enthusiasm. And like everything else, you know, once you start you probably go a little further than you should have.</i><br />JOHN REED: Sandy Weil. I mean, his whole life was to accumulate money.<i> And he said, &#8220;John, we could be so rich.&#8221;</i> Being rich never crossed my mind as an objective value. I almost was embarrassed that somebody would say out loud. It might be happening but you wouldn&#8217;t want to say it.  <br />JOHN REED: Yeah, Sandy Weil. And I sort of say, &#8220;Sandy, you know, we didn&#8217;t do very well.&#8221; And he&#8217;s not comfortable with that conversation at all. I think he would still defend that it was a good merger, it just went off the tracks afterwards. I &#8212;</p></blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>Regarding the economics of it</div>
<div></div>
<p>
<blockquote>JOHN REED:No, no. It&#8217;s not something you&#8217;d like to end your career with. That is for sure. No, look. <i>We got carried away.</i>It wasn&#8217;t any small group, it was a consensus that reached the press, it reached the political world. It certainly had reached the intellectual world. I&#8217;m now, as you know, at MIT,<i>and I say to some of my academic friends that the intellectual underpinnings of this was created at MIT and places like that, I mean—</i><br />BILL MOYERS: With the technology of the computers?<br />JOHN REED: Well, no.<i> It&#8217;s all of this mathematics of finance and the presumption in much of this mathematics that you can capture risk by looking at historical volatility and so forth and so on. </i>  <br />BILL MOYERS: Are you saying, suggesting that &#8212; <i>the chairman of the board of MIT&#8217;s suggesting &#8211;that human intelligence no longer runs our financial system?</i><br />JOHN REED: Well, it&#8217;s a little wisdom balance that judgment wouldn&#8217;t hurt.

<div>The Criminality of it (at least as I see it): See: Regarding the take down of Glass Steagall above</div>
<p>
<blockquote>
<div>Showing an historical video clip, Mr. Reed speaking with Sandy Wiel</div>
<p>JOHN REED: Sandy called his friend the President last night and invited me to join in on the conversation and we had a good talk. So the President was in fact told last evening about what was going to happen.
<div></div>
<p>JOHN REED: <i>Well, they originated and sold into the marketplace things that should never have been originated.</i><br />BILL MOYERS: Derivatives, unregulated derivatives?<br />JOHN REED: <i>Well, it was the excess mortgages, the no-doc, low-doc mortgages.</i> And then the derivatives were a byproduct. Once you had those, then you could chop &#8217;em up and so forth. And of course they had changed their mindset. They were in the business to make money, period.</p></blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>The psyche that is protecting the conscience: Note his choice of words</div>
<p>
<blockquote>JOHN REED: You&#8217;re&#8211; I mean, <i>a consensus</i>developed. The fact that we took it [regulation, Glass Steagall] out was <i>a byproduct </i>of this<i> mistaken belief</i>in this modern financial system that was, quote, &#8220;more efficient,&#8221; was very lucrative for the United States and the U.S. economy in global terms.<br />And which was supposed to handle risk better. In fact, it handled risk worse. I mean, this is what the facts are because there was a much greater concentration of risk created. And so <i>we got it wrong</i>.  <br /><i>But the restraint of the government and it&#8217;s agencies disappeared in the enthusiasm. (Yeah, just a “byproduct”)</i><br />And so it was this combination of the participants getting <i>carried away,</i> the normal checks and balances that should exist against participants.  <br /><i>And the thing that is astounding, frankly, and there&#8217;s a lesson here that we probably haven&#8217;t yet learned, is that the system can get it so wrong.</i> It wasn&#8217;t&#8211;<br />BILL MOYERS: So wrong?<br />JOHN REED: <i>It wasn&#8217;t that there was one or two or institutions that, you know, got carried away and did stupid things. It was, we all did.</i> And then the whole system came down. You know, it became illiquid, the government stepped in. Had the government not stepped in, it really would have come to an end.  
<div> </div>
<p>BILL MOYERS: But they left in place the very people who had driven the ship into the iceberg.<br />JOHN REED: I&#8217;m <i>quite surprised </i>at that. It clearly has not been a clean sweep. In other words, those of <i>us who made mistakes,</i> and so forth and so on, are still floating around the system. And&#8211;<br />BILL MOYERS: Floating it? You&#8217;re running it.<br />JOHN REED: Well, I am not, but &#8212;<br />BILL MOYERS: You&#8217;re not running it, they&#8217;re running it.<br />JOHN REED: But there are many who are. I wasn&#8217;t involved, obviously. I had retired in the year 2000. We&#8217;re now talking 2008. So I was a <i>knowledgeable spectator,</i> but certainly not a participant. <i>I was quite surprised because, frankly, the worst thing that can happen to a businessman is to go bankrupt. (Shades of Greenspan confessions?)</i> That&#8217;s the sign of ultimate failure. You ran a business and it was unable to succeed under the terms and conditions of private capital. Namely, you went bankrupt.<br />It&#8217;s not a crime. But it certainly <i>is a mistake</i>. And these companies, even though they didn&#8217;t have to file for bankruptcy, de facto went bankrupt. And so the managements and the boards and the regulators should have, in my mind <i>stepped aside.</i>  <br />BILL MOYERS: Sounds to me like you&#8217;re calling the Glass-Steagall Act back from the grave.<br />JOHN REED: I think I am.  (At this point, he still could not say it “shit”.)</p></blockquote>
<p>There is more in the interview.  You need to see and hear it to understand.  I think Mr. Reed is struggling with his conscience and wanting to clear it versus what I believe he feels is a  real risk of getting tied up with the Justice Department.  It has to be working on him.  Though I interpret an air of feeling protected in Mr Reed do to his own wealth.  As much as he knows wrong and not a mistake was done, he has no experience of the anxiety as what those in the labor economy are experiencing.  He is still in denial to an extent which stops him from using his position to truly work to correct this wrong.  Or maybe he just is not of the character to participate on the just side of the fight.<br />Mr. Reed does get one thing correct:</p>
<blockquote><p>BILL MOYERS But when the financial community can buy the rules they want &#8212;<br />JOHN REED: Then you&#8217;ve got an unstable situation. That&#8217;s an intolerable situation. I mean, obviously.</p></blockquote>
<p>He knows.  He knows that regulation is a necessity.  As the head of MIT, he could be doing so much more.   <br />Come-on Mr. Reed, destiny is calling you.</p>

                                <div>We are taking a little side trip inthis series of defining rich based on the prior tax rate schedulesbut, this post  is keeping with the process of looking at history formarkers as to the definition of rich.  For any new readers, I believeas a society we knew and had definite boundaries as to what definedrich.  I believe we knew how to say the word “when” as the incomeand wealth was pouring into one&#8217;s glass These boundaries producedspecific public policy that resulted in a more equal and justsociety.</div>
<div></div>
<div>In our local city there is anothertextile mill going to the grave.  We have lost a couple of huge millsto fire in the last decade.  The local  paper did an article on thismill known as the French Worsted Mill.  It was built in two stages,1906 and then 1906.  It was part of the revival of the mill industryvia specific targeting of French industrialists, post water power forthe city.  A local person who was eventually governor of the state iscredited with bring $6,000,000 of foreign investment into the cityearly turn of the century.   At one point they had a Uniroyal rubberplant that made soles for shoes  The last pair of Keds (sneakers) went out thedoor in 1970.  <a href="http://www.newspaperarchive.com/SiteMap/FreePdfPreview.aspx?img=110759965%20">Nine hundred and fifty people out of work due to &#8220;FarEaster Producers&#8221;.</a>  (See the article: Pressure growsrapidly for Congress to to clamp tariffs on foreign goods, 5/19/1970)  This was a city as industrial asanything Detroit or Pittsburgh were.  This was a cultural center forthe region with 6 theaters and I don&#8217;t mean just movies.  We aretalking blue collar all the way.  We&#8217;re talking jobs that we considerthrow away jobs to the far east today.  We&#8217;re talking jobs that are notconsidered “good” jobs anymore.  </div>
<div></div>
<div>So, now that you have the picture, hereis what this mill and the jobs within it were able to do for theworkers.  I think this bit of history also adds to my position thatwe have continually pushed the cost of the American Dream up theincome line such that the middle class can not afford it&#8230;even with2 college educated people in one house.  This is the sub-context tothe discussion regarding the decline of the middle class or the lossof the middle class.  When people say the middle class does notexist, what is being stated is that the American Dream is no longerfinancially possible for this groups of citizens.  The Dream is notdead or gone, it is over priced relative to the income of the middleclass.  It is just as we are not drowning in debt, we are dehydratingfrom lack of income.</div>
<div></div>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<div>The article in the paper talked about aMr. Bacon.  He worked in the mill in 1956 along with 700 to 800 otherresidents.  The job was not as a machine tool maker (the mill as mosthad their own machine shop) or a special machine operator thatrequired special skill.  He was a laborer.  The tasks mentioned werestuffing waste wool into burlap sacks or “picking up the yarn” orfetching parts from the machine shop.  We&#8217;re talking menial labortasks.  Starter jobs.  </div>
<div></div>
<div>For this work Mr. Bacon was paid $1.80per hour.  The minimum wage was $1.00 per hour.  At some point he wasearning $80 per week for 40 hours work.  This is $4160 per year. With this income Mr. Bacon was able to put himself through collegeand became a teacher in the local school system.  It was not just anyold college he went to.  It was Providence College with a tuition of$500 per year.   Yes, a private college that cost only 1/8<sup>th</sup>of his annual income.  </div>
<div></div>
<div>Mr. Bacon&#8217;s story is the story that notonly are the Republican presidential candidates promoting as to whatwe need to &#8220;get back” to, but the democrats are saying we needto go forward to.  Mr. Bacon&#8217;s story with this mill is the proof thatthe 2 parties are not talking about a fantasy time in our history. It did exist.</div>
<div>Here&#8217;s the problem though with both of their directions.  I&#8217;m justgoing to list them.</div>
<ol>
<li>
<div>$40,000 is the annual tuition at Providence College today.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>$1.80 per hour is equivalent to the following: $14.40/hour standard of living, $17.80 real value, $18.20 unskilled labor and $22.00/hour production labor.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>Tuition of $500 is equivalent to the following: $4010.00 standard of living, $4960 real value, $5050 unskilled labor and $6120.00 production labor</div>
</li>
</ol>
<div></div>
<div>Are you seeing the problem here?  It&#8217;snot just the difference of tuition going up 80 times.  It&#8217;s that the wage equivalent today for what amounts to stacking shelves in Walmartis not being paid at Walmart.  Not only is this Walmart job notpaying such wages, this is what the current autoworker is earning. The autoworker was one of the best compensated citizens we had. Lookup the definition of  middle class in the dictionary, and you would have seen anautoworker!  </div>
<div></div>
<div>How bad is this?  <a href="http://www.wsws.org/articles/2011/sep2011/pers-s08.shtml">Considered</a>: </div>
<blockquote><div>Thelow-wage benchmark set by the UAW has already set off a competitivestruggle in the global auto industry, with Fiat-Chrysler boss SergioMarchionne telling Italian workers they must accept American-styleconcessions or he will move production to North America for cheaperlabor.</div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>I have read that the German automakersare here in the US for the same reason.  We are now the stop for outsourcing.  </div>
<div></div>
<div>Here is the other more important aspectof the story of the French Worsted Mill and it&#8217;s relationship to theAmerican Dream.  All those candidates, all those legislators, allthose governors proposing programs they say will encourage people toget off welfare and join the “productive” class, programs thatwill spur job creation, programs that will grow the economy such thatwe can cut taxes JUST LIKE THE GOOD OLD DAYS have no answer for thelack of pay of $14.00 per hour for the Walmart shelf stocker.  Theyhave no answer as to how they are going to return the ratio betweenthe hourly wage and the cost of college education to that of the1950&#8217;s such that an individual can accomplish what Mr. Bacon andothers from the same mill accomplished.   Not only do they have noanswer, they don&#8217;t even want to consider this aspect of theirsolution.  </div>
<div></div>
<div>Mr. Bacon&#8217;s story is also telling uswhy we think the public sector is so over paid.  If a Walmart shelfstocker should be earning $14.00 hour comparatively but are not, ifan autoworker earning $14.00 per hour is underpaid comparatively,then certainly the higher hourly wages of the public sector lookexcessive.  Everyone used to know that the public sector was alwayspaid less compared to the private sector.  They did not have morebenefits than the autoworker, but they do now.  The slowdeterioration of the autoworkers and all the other laborers pay andbenefits has hidden the reality of the finger pointing at the publicsector.  It&#8217;s not that they are paid so much, and thus look “rich”by comparison, it&#8217;s that the autoworker has lost so much over such along time that the loss is not recognized as a loss.  Instead, thepublic sector&#8217;s economic position is looked at as an unjust gain. Not only is this presented as an unjust gain, it is an injusticeperpetrated via taxation.  And the stage is now set for all thearguments such as those we hear coming from governors such as Walkerand Kasich.</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>This is where the Keds hit the road. We, and I have to say “We” because We voted in those who made thepolicy changes, have decided that a good job is not one which allowsthe experience of Mr. Bacon or the autoworker.  We upped it to be onethat required academic education.  No longer would trade education orapprenticeship education be of such value that it would define themiddle class.  Unfortunately, as I had <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2007/04/this-is-continuation-of-looking-at.html">suggested  in 2007</a>, evenacademic education is being defined down as to not resulting in a &#8220;goodjob&#8221;.  </div>

<blockquote><div>&#8220;The dream seems to now only be adefinite with a 2 person, college educated and working household. That combination is not far from being in the 10% group.  Thus, wehave raised the dream to something beyond which a large portion ofthe population will not reach considering only 28% have a 4 yeardegree even though 64% of high school students are entering college. It looks even worse with people suggesting that you need an IQ of 110to succeed in college.  I mean, can we push the dream any further outor be anymore aristocratic in our arguments? &#8220;</div>

<div><a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2007/04/this-is-continuation-of-looking-at.html">What has this push produced</a>:</div>
<blockquote><p>In 2003, the homeownership rate for upper-income families withchildren was 90.8 percent, while the rate for their low- tomoderate-income counterparts was significantly lower at 59.6 percent– yet in 1978 some 62.5 percent of low-to moderate-income workingfamilies with children owned their homes. Ultimately, had the 1978homeownership rates for working families with children prevailed in2003, an additional 2.3 million children would now be living inowner-occupied homes. </p></blockquote>
<p>How&#8217;s this little bit of history change your ideas about what toblame for the current housing/mortgage mess?  I suppose if you areall for a future that is less than what was accomplished in the pastthen blaming government for promoting housing and people for spendingbeyond there means is all right by you.</p>
<p>No one in the middle class of yore was rich by any means.  But,what they had was a life much freer of risk than today.  What theylived in was an environment that provided the means to manage therisk of life and living.  When we are told by those running for or inoffice that Americans need to be more&#8230;(fill in the blank) they aresuggesting such from within their own experience of having grown upin a socially constructed via government environment that was devoidof certain risks of living based on one&#8217;s income.  In other words,you would not be told that the requirement for food stamps would meanyou had to <a href="http://crooksandliars.com/susie-madrak/pas-gov-tom-corbett-bar-food-stamp-re">have less than $2000 in savings. </a></p>
<p> The removal of these risks allowed one to take what theypersonally had (natural ability and otherwise) and grow it into alife where economically more of life&#8217;s risks could be taken onindividually.   It was an environment which removed the concept ofluck from the social justice equation. </p>
<p>This environment was not all welfare.  It was an environment thatassured a person of common acuity could live a life free from therisk of weather, malnourishment, illness and aging.  It was anenvironment that produced an economy such that the vast majority ofthe 72% without a college education were living this minimal risklife. We had an environment which supported the economic life journeyof the autoworker, simultaneously supporting the economic life journey of Mr.Bacon&#8217;s experience, simultaneous supporting the economic life journey of anindividual such as President Obama.   </p>
<p>It was an economic environment which produced a directrelationship between income/wealth and risk absorption.  As incomeand wealth went up, so did the absorption of risk and vice versa. Today we 
<div>have a system that is completely theopposite such that we have arrived at place where the relationship iscompletely reversed.  We spare those who as a group can purchase agovernment which insulates them from any risk while pushing all therisks of living on to those who can not afford any risk and then tellthose people &#8220;oh well&#8221;.   The bank bailouts and theausterity plan is the realization of the reversal of the risk/income-wealth relationship.  </div>
<p>Our past economic environment also produced a direct relationshipbetween income-wealth and luck. Again, as income-wealth increased,your success was more dependent on luck and vice versa.  This too hasbeen reversed as we see with the Washington revolving door and evergreater capture of the nations wealth as one&#8217;s income-wealthincreases.  The environment produces an ever stronger assurance thatincome and wealth will increase as they both increase.  This isunlike the experience of the middle class including all the highly educatedpeople who find themselves under employed or unemployed do to theshear luck of having chosen wrong. Today the closer you are to zeroon the line of income-wealth, the luckier you need to be.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll leave you with this, the class warfare.  There is classwarfare.  It has always been with us, since the writing of theConstitution.  However, I believe the current theater is the mostdevious the vast majority of the US population has ever faced.  Thisis because of the two parties in this seemingly perpetual human quest,one has successfully cloaked themselves in the costume worn of athird party observer effectively immunizing themselves from the pain of the fight via camouflageof a messenger.  I even suspect some aregaining a wee bit of entertainment in their ability to manipulate theircounterparts into fighting among themselves.  I speak of the laborclass successfully being divided such that those who labor in theprivate sector of the economy accuses those who labor in the publicsector of the economy for their poor economic position and the publicsector laborer does not recognizing themselves in the private laborworld.  I tell you, the false messenger is recognized in that theirlabor is money.  It is not in their mind or body.  Warren Buffet maywant to be taxed more, but Warren Buffet is not working his money asthe Kock Brothers are working theirs&#8230;and Warren Buffet isbenefiting from the productivity of the Kock&#8217;s Brother&#8217;s money.</p>
<p>Next up is 1936&#8217;s tax table.

<p>The biggest growth difference appears to come from the U.S. period from the Second (1996) Clinton Tax Reform to the 2001 recession—a big if, I grant you, but one that the Gingrich/DeLay-led Republican Party predicted would produce mayhem, and the alternative-history is not difficult to imagine—I&#8217;m having trouble seeing where the losses are.  Especially if you consider that much of that time was spent <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/08/opinion/sunday/the-true-story-of-japans-economic-success.html">investing in increased infrastructure improvements and health care</a> that have the country well-positioned going forward.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>On this <s><a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2011/11/november-11-2010-was-the-last-armistice-day">Armistice</a></s> Veteran&#8217;s Day, let&#8217;s try to do a counterfactual and <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2011/11/wanted-a-sympathetic-account-of-geithnerism.html">Make Brad DeLong Happy</a>.*</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s assume that the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramm%E2%80%93Leach%E2%80%93Bliley_Act">Gramm-Leach-Bliley</a>—commonly referred to, incorrectly, as &#8220;the repeal of Glass_Steagall&#8221;—is A Good Thing. Well, I won&#8217;t go that far. An Inevitable Thing. [Many sentences about Larry Summers omitted here.] After all, anyone who was paying attention knew that Glass-Steagall had already been shivved several times by 1999, and that letting <s>Citi buy Travelers</s> banks buy insurance companies (and vice versa) was only a matter of time.</p>
<p>(If you tell me that&#8217;s a good thing, I&#8217;m going to point out that the risks of banks and the risks of insurance companies are the same, that combining them in no way makes the financial system safer or improves risk management, and that, therefore, you&#8217;re an idiot. But pointing something so fundamental out to a Summers or a Bob Rubin would be like telling your two-year-old not to pull the cat&#8217;s tail; the only question is who ends up getting stitches.)</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s assume that commercial banks, investment banks, and insurance companies are essentially fungible entities. What will we see?:</p>
<ol>
<li>Commercial banks will be able to outcompete investment banks, due to Gresham&#8217;s Law. They have more money, and can afford to make mistakes.</li>
<li>As a result of this, investment banks, with less capital and therefore less room for mistakes, will become more likely to fail as independent entities. (You would have to be stupid, or <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2008/09/hindsight-regulation/4122/">McMegan</a>, to assume the brunt of the damage would go the other way.) <br />Results: 
<ol>
<li>Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, which occurred two years earlier, will serve as a warning sign that will be ignored by the banks, which &#8220;know&#8221; that the acquisition was backwards</li>
<li>J.P. Morgan will be acquired by <s>Manny Hanny</s>Chase,</li>
<li>Goldman Sachs has to go public to acquire capital; Jon Corzine is forced out because he realizes (having seen Bear and Merrill and Morgan Stanley do it before) that it will fundamentally destroy the incentive structure and culture of the firm.</li>
<li>Investors working on the Greater Fool Theory will decide that Investment Banks might win the battle, and will bid up the BSCs and LEHs of the world, figuring that either (a) they will be acquired (JPM) or (b) they will grow on their own (GS, MS). This will be temporarily self-fulfilling, <a href="http://bigpicture.typepad.com/comments/2008/03/charts-of-the-d.html">until it isn&#8217;t</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p></li>
<li>Insurance companies will move more into banking services (as their subsidiaries have for years) in search of more cash to search for more yield and more long-term investments and short-term arbitrage. Since they do much of this now, the only additional risk will be if there is a flurry of mergers. Or a rogue insurance company. And that would never happen in <a href="http://www.gpoaccess.gov/fcic/fcic.pdf">insurance</a>, just as it would <a href="http://i.cnn.net/cnn/2002/LAW/02/02/enron.report/powers.report.pdf">never happen in energy</a>.</li>
<li>There will be very little demand from banks to buy insurance companies outright, since (a) there are very few Sandy Weill&#8217;s in the market and (b) even Citigroup used to be able to <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2001/12/19/ipo/citigroup/index.htm">admit mistakes</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>So what do we have, post-Gramm, Leach, Bliley? A marginal-at-best difference from 1997. The high likelihood that investment banks will lose the battle they&#8217;ve been fighting to less capable but better capitalized entities. A growing encroachment of insurance companies into the banking industry, while bankers go for the easy prey (IBs). The same consolidation and move toward <a href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/160347-america-a-bona-fide-plutonomy">plutocracy-pandering</a> that was the rule.</p>
<p>Short version: there isn&#8217;t a fundamental change in the management, financing, or control of anything that arises from Gramm-Leach-Bliley or its predecessor. There is, as Ben Bernanke noted, &#8220;<a href="http://www.dailyprincetonian.com/2010/09/27/26353/">a failure of economic engineering and economic management</a>,&#8221; but it&#8217;s marginal, and there&#8217;s a strong possibility that the system can recover.</p>
<p>But there are two later pieces of legislation that do cause a fundamental shift. </p>
<p>Next rock: 2000 and 2005; Summers and Biden pillage while Geithner fiddles.</p>
<p>*The more I think about this, the more I expect to fail, for reasons stated elsewhere. But it is <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org/">NaNoWriMo</a>, so this is at worst part of my 50,000 words.</p>

<p>And why do those Astronomy and Astrophysics people** have jobs?<br />
<blockquote>Earth to [Phil Plait of] Bad Astronomy: your short-list of fully-employed science majors is totally cherry-picked&#8230;.And all those astronomers who have plenty of jobs?

                                <p>Brad DeLong has two posts, <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2011/11/ezra-klein-shrinking-the-presidency-back-down-to-size-obama-2009-10-b.html">one from Ezra &#8220;I&#8217;m a liberal who is safe for the Washington Post&#8221; Klein</a> and <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2011/11/mike-konczal-grades-president-obamas-economic-performance-in-early-2010-c-.html">one from Mike &#8220;I actually looked at the data&#8221; Konczal</a>.</p>
<p>Brad deals with Ezra&#8217;s folly:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think a B+ is too high a grade&#8211;largely because one big task of 2009 was to set up the situation so that you could still make policy in 2010 and 2011 if it turned out that you needed to.</p></blockquote>
<p>And that&#8217;s without mentioning that the Administration violated the first law of Presidencies; the one George Effing W. Bush knew well: give your base something early, so they know you didn&#8217;t just come to them for their votes.  Bush gave his &#8220;faith-based initiatives.&#8221; Obama—who campaigned on card check, principal reduction, and his father being Jor-El—only went for big-ticket items.</p>
<p>Mike goes in detail over the ground I discussed <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/11/argument-against-first-derivative.html">here</a>: the idiocy that is the 2010 State of the Union Address, delivered 27 January 2010.  With contemporaneous detail. Go <a href="http://rortybomb.wordpress.com/2011/11/09/what-can-we-say-about-president-obamas-economic-performance-in-2010/">Read the Whole Thing</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not just bad economics, it&#8217;s bad politics.  Which brings me back to <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2011/11/matthew-yglesiass-theory-of-the-obama-administration-in-2010-excessive-reliance-on-the-second-derivative.html">Matt&#8217;s lazy first graphic</a>, which means I&#8217;m going to beat the dead horse again. Below the fold.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>I called it &#8220;lazy&#8221; because it is; it&#8217;s raw data, and you don&#8217;t just look at raw data in isolation, at least if you&#8217;re sane. You don&#8217;t do it if you&#8217;re an economist, and you don&#8217;t do it if you&#8217;re a politician.</p>
<p>As an economist, you don&#8217;t just look at unemployment; you look at unemployment in relation to other things—causes, effects.  GDP gaps, demographics, transitions from one sector to another, you name it.  It&#8217;s nice to see data, and flows, but they have to mean something.</p>
<p>Political analysts—if they&#8217;re any good—don&#8217;t look at data in isolation either, especially when they have Austan Goolsbee, Alan Kreuger, Christina Romer, and even Lawrence H. Summers working with them. Any one of those four—let alone all of them, often in the same room, if not always the same discussion—could tell David Axelrod that the U.S. needs to create between 110,000 and 150,000 jobs a month just to tread water on unemployment.  Maybe they ballpark it at 125,000.  So instead of Matt&#8217;s original graphic, David Axelrod would have seen something like this one:
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-A3V4EsiFkhQ/TrtVNWyXZ0I/AAAAAAAAApo/wi5sel31QDA/s1600/NewMatt.PNG"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-A3V4EsiFkhQ/TrtVNWyXZ0I/AAAAAAAAApo/wi5sel31QDA/s320/NewMatt.PNG" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>And if he&#8217;s still talking about how his boss will have nothing to worry about in two years, well, I&#8217;m certain that Goolsbee, Krueger, Romer, or Summers—all of whom were still at the White House during that time—would have set him straight.</p>
<p>And there would have been another policy, a change of course.  Or a really bad Unforced Error.</p>

It is posted at TED.  I am posting it here, as I can not believe this information has not received more attention now that the US is awakening from the decades long delusion of prosperity which did not and as shown in the lecture could not lead to greater justice (which implies equality) via the model of economics we have been using. </div>
<div></div>
<div>The model known by many aliases (Chicago School, Friedman, etc) has resulted in the thought that people are drowning in debt and that we have privatized the profits but socialized the losses. These are inaccurate metaphors. They are the results of the language of the delusion we have been living for 3 decades and thus by definition can not capture the truth of our condition. As the science presented in the lecture shows, if our all encompassing concern should be equality, then people are not drowning, they are <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/06/monetary-policy-im-not-only-not-feeling.html">dehydrating</a>. </div>
<div></div>
<div>The dehydration is the results of privatizing security in life and socializing the risks in life. We are not “drowning” in risk or losses. We of the 99% are lacking in the substance that reduces risk. One can certainly drown from too much water, but the natural risk in life is not having too much water, it is having too little. Thus is the realization of the delusional statement “drowning in debt” and “socialized the losses”. </div>
<p><a name="more"></a>
<div>The lack of reduction of life&#8217;s risks is the inequality, the social injustice&#8230;the diversion from the purpose expressed in the preamble to our Constitution. “We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.”</div>

<div>The following <a href="http://www.crimeandjustice.org.uk/wilkinsoninequality.html">concluding statement</a> from a different lecture by Professor Wilkinson summarizes the TED lecture. As you watch the lecture keep in mind the 4 goals I highlighted of the preamble and consider that they were put into a document that created an government 223 years ago this year (based on ratification). I have a greater respect for the intellect and their insight into the human experience of those who wrote and ratified our Constitution. </div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><p>“For thousands of years the best way of improving the quality of human life has been to raise material living standards. We are the first generation to have got to the end of that process. No longer does economic growth improve health, happiness, or wellbeing. If we are to improve the real quality of life further, we have to direct our attention to the social environment and the quality of social relations. But rather than continuing to tackle each problem separately, by spending more on medical care, more on police, social workers and drug rehabilitation units, we now know that it is possible to improve the psychosocial wellbeing and social functioning of whole societies. <strong>The quality of social relations is built on material foundations &#8211; on the scale of the material inequalities between us</strong>.” </p></blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>With information such as this research and that of the<a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2007/10/human-capital-is-where-its-at.html"> 2005 World Bank</a> paper on what produces wealth , considering our Constitution&#8217;s preamble, we should not be struggling looking for guidance as to what direction, what path, what solution we need for our self (our self as in We the People). </div>
