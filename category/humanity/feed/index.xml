				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>by: Daniel Becker<br />This is<a href="http://roundtree7.wordpress.com/2011/03/26/updated-secrets-of-us-history/"> very important</a>.  It is a list of all we have done in the world.   Go take a look.  It won&#8217;t take long.  I&#8217;ll wait for you to return.</p>
<p>That we do not teach about this in our schools is why we are who we are.  This list should be a banner which is run along the bottom of every news cast for as long as we are involved in such activity or when a new such action is proposed.  It should be a page in every Sunday newspaper edition for as long as we are involved or when a new such action is proposed.</p>
<p>Most of all, this list and the banner should start with the following words: &#8220;<strong>You have done all of the following&#8230;&#8221;  </strong>I say &#8220;you&#8221; because such actions need to remain personal.   It is always personal.  Yes, you and me personally have done all of this.  Don&#8217;t start thinking that the use of robotics removes you from the equation.  Don&#8217;t fall for that psych-ops.  You, me, we still are the one&#8217;s pulling the trigger.  We did this.  All of this.  </p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />We&#8217;re broke? We have to sacrifice? What do we have to sacrifice, our dignity? Our integraty? Do you like someone doing all this in your name? Your name is on it. Don&#8217;t make that mistake thinking it&#8217;s not. </p>
<p>Oh, it&#8217;s only about the money at this blog? Well, you&#8217;re the private sector, you, me and we. Is this how you would choose to spend your Nth dollar? Is this how you would choose to spend your vaction money, your retirement money, your holiday gift money? I mean, it&#8217;s all extra spending anyway. Gee, you have no extra? Well then, is this how you would choose to spend your grocery money, your heating money (just filled my tank, $3.59/gal), your insurance money, your TAX money? </p>
<p>Is the private sector spending it better than the government sector? How can you tell? See, private or government, it&#8217;s still US. You pulled the trigger. I pulled the trigger by inclusion. We pulled the trigger.</p>
<p>And the rest of the world knows it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Update:  rdan makes big mistake on static news.</p>
<p><a href="http://static-news.com/">Static News</a> by Wm Hallowell is a new site and is aimed at the age 13-30 year old group.  It is my impression this younger group is generally not a part of our regular readership, with a few notable exceptions.</p>
<p>Angry Bear is listed with some of the Big Guys on the leftie side of the bloglists.  The younger group is mostly who I deal with in other parts of my life, so I was glad to see this happening.  How we might respond to a younger group is unclear to me (well, way younger perhaps) but I find it intriguing.</p>
<p>When I hear even the young side of boomers worry about Soc. Sec. not &#8216;being there&#8217; for them, but then start to explain the math and such, they now simply laugh and run away (affectionately, but with no qualms).</p>
<p>I will be hoping to explore the links (and design if changes are made in consequence) at some point with our group of eleven and of course readers.  Maybe for now bedtime reading can be switched to laptops and spencer&#8217;s pictures?</p>
