<p>Cook County Clerk David Orr said Malone&#8217;s contractions were five minutes apart when she showed up around 8:30 a.m. at her precinct&#8217;s location named, yes, New Life Celebration Church.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Let&#8217;s ignore that three of his four wins (including two last night) have come in non-binding caucuses and take a quick look at The Size of the Santorum Surge.</p>
<p>Over at <a href="http://xnerg.blogspot.com/">Skippy</a>, Our Leader posted a link to a discussion of whether &#8220;Romney&#8217;s strengths&#8221; could beat Obama. I wisecracked, without looking at the data, that the total Republican votes in all three states were lower than the daily NYC subway ridership.</p>
<p>My bad.  That&#8217;s not even a ballpark comparison.  On its lowest day, the NYC subway <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Subway">averages more than 2,350,000 riders</a>. (That&#8217;s a lot of elitists, Newt.)  It averages more than three million (3,000,000) on Saturdays, more than four million (4,000,000) riders a day, and more than five million (5,000,000) every weekday.</p>
<p>By comparison, here are <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/07/map-caucus-primary-2012-results_n_1260890.html">the number of votes cast yesterday in Republican primaries/caucuses</a>:
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2pDstK_WsPk/TzKcWZ0gCGI/AAAAAAAAAug/q6Ce9gc-KCg/s1600/20120207%2BRepublican%2BVoters.PNG"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2pDstK_WsPk/TzKcWZ0gCGI/AAAAAAAAAug/q6Ce9gc-KCg/s320/20120207%2BRepublican%2BVoters.PNG" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Clearly, we need a smaller comparative to make the turnout appear more impressive. So let&#8217;s look at one of my favorite demographic measures, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_of_United_States_Metropolitan_Statistical_Areas">Metropolitan Statistical Areas</a> (MSAs).</p>
<p>Keeping in mind that the MSA includes the areas around the cities named, the total voters in the three Republican elections yesterday would occupy&#8230;the 144th largest MSA,* just behind Eugene-Springfield, Oregon (351,715).</p>
<p>The Santorum Surge: Smaller than Peoria (#135), bigger than Kalamazoo (#148).  </p>
<p>*I resist saying &#8220;Gross!&#8221; at this point.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In contrast to Mankiw&#8217;s attitude (see <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/10/mankiws-incentives.html">cactus&#8217;s post below</a>*), my favorite election story of the year comes from <a href="http://mochi-tsuki.livejournal.com/160690.html">Ms. Mochi_tsuki</a>:<br />
<blockquote>So they started explaining to me what an absentee ballot is and how to fill one out. I pointed out that I&#8217;d spent 11 years of my adult life overseas and was very familiar with the process. One of them pointed to the other and said, &#8220;He&#8217;s been overseas as well. He&#8217;s a retired Admiral.&#8221; WTF?</p>
<p>You may know this, but by law, there are never more than about 200 Admirals in service. Really rare creatures, those. This one? Retired last month. And he&#8217;s spending his weekends working on the GOTV effort in rural Virginia.</p></blockquote>
<p>But I guess retired Admirals don&#8217;t need the motivations that economics professors do.</p>
<p>*In fairness to Mankiw, he knows his numbers are b.s.  The <a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2008/10/blog-post.html">giveaway</a>: &#8220;In a sense, putting the various pieces of the tax system together, I would be facing a marginal tax rate of 93 percent. [italics mine]&#8221;  Not to mention the corporate tax free finesse, and the assumption that r=0.10, but lets sidebar those.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hearing that democratic turnout has been stronger in the past primaries prior to Super Tuesday, I used C &#038; L&#8217;s <a href="http://www.crooksandliars.com/2008/02/05/spokesuper-tuesday-open-thread/">chart data </a>to total up the voter count.  I exclude the states that did not have duel party primaries. The turnout was 14,865,735 democratic to 8,929,123 republican. The republican turnout was 60% of the democratic turnout.</p>
<p>I then went to<a href="http://mwhodges.home.att.net/election2004.htm"> this map</a> to see the “red states” from 2004 and calculated the voter turnout. Super Tuesday had 11 red states voting. Of those, 8 had more democratic voters than republican voters for Super Tuesday. For those 8 states (AR, CO, GA, MO, ND, OK, TN, UT) it was 3,407,658 democratic voters, 2,963,340 republican voters. The republican turnout was 87% of the democratic.</p>
<p>For the 3 remaining states of the 11 &#8220;red&#8221; (AK, AL, AZ)  it was 1,001,540 republican voter turnout to 902,755 democratic voter turnout. The democratic turnout was 90% of the republican.</p>
<p>Interesting no?  Cha, cha, cha changes&#8230;</p>
