<p>Unemployment Rates Across the Euro Area – Tough Times in Key Markets</p>
<p>Today Eurostat released its unemployment rate figures for the month of August. The Euro area unemployment rate held firm at 11.4% for the third consecutive month. Spain still has the highest unemployment rate in the euro area, 25.1%, and Greece is catching up quickly, 24.4% (in June, which is the latest data point).<br />The chart below illustrates the level of the unemployment rate and its month-month change for the euro area 12 countries.<br /><a href="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/10/urate_chart.jpg"><img alt="" height="402" src="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/10/urate_chart.jpg" width="604"></a></p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>The periphery are under performing the average, with Spain, Greece, Portugal, and Ireland leading the way. Internal devaluation, or driving up the unemployment rate to reduce relative prices with demand, is really taking its toll. Respectively, the unemployment rates in Spain, Greece, Portugal, and Ireland are 178.9 ppt, 234.2 ppt, 93.9 ppt, and 212.5 ppt above their pre-crisis minimums (loosely defined since January 2008) – a simple average of 179.9 ppt above the joint minimum for these four countries. The average euro area 17 unemployment rate is just 56.2 ppt above its 7.3% pre-crisis minimum. Hard days in the periphery, to be sure. Against this backdrop, weekend <a href="http://www.eurointelligence.com/eurointelligence-news/home/singleview-restricted/article/peer-steinbrueck-to-challenge-angela-merkel.html">protests in Paris, Madrid, Lisbon, and Rome</a> are not a surprise.<br />I further point out the troubling trend in the French labor market, as the new government presents its fresh austerity budget for 2013.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/10/fr-ea_urate.jpg"><img alt="" height="390" src="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/10/fr-ea_urate.jpg" width="605"></a></p>
<p>This budget is highly dependent on tax revenue and positive growth momentum, which is likely to disappoint amid such deterioration in domestic demand. See <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/comment/ambroseevans_pritchard/9577674/Another-domino-falls-as-Hollande-pushes-France-into-depression.html">Ambrose Evans-Pritchard </a>on the expected budget impact.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>by <a href="http://www.economonitor.com/blog/author/rwilder3">Rebecca Wilder</a></p>
<p>It’s the Exchange Rate, Stupid</p>
<p>Eurostat released trade figures today, where the trade balance (exports less imports) surged €3.7 bn in the month of June (<a href="http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_PUBLIC/6-17082012-AP/EN/6-17082012-AP-EN.PDF">link to the</a> .pdf release). The current figures imply a 2012 annualized trade balance of €66.9 bn, which is a meaningful boost to the -€7.4 bn deficit in 2011.</p>
<p>Eurostat breaks down the regional figures further into intra-Euro area (intra-EA) trade and extra-Euro area (extra-EA) trade.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/08/table_tb.jpg"><img alt="" height="100" src="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/08/table_tb.jpg" width="600"></a></p>
<p> Out of the EA 16, June intra-EA figures are available for just a few countries. Of those countries, the intra-EA trade balance improved in Portugal only, increasing by 0.26 ppt as a share of GDP on the month. From June 2011 to June 2012, where available, otherwise June 2011 to May 2012 (see Table above), the intra-EA rebalancing – i.e., roughly raising the balance of the net-importers and reducing the surplus of the net-exporters – has occurred to a certain degree. Net trade as a share of country GDP fell in Germany, and rose in Italy, Spain, Greece, and Portugal. France and Ireland worsened their positions, while the Netherlands increased its large trade surplus of 25.1% of GDP over the year.</p>
<p><img alt="" height="539" src="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/08/IEA_trade.jpg" width="604"><br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p> Except in Portugal and Greece, the intra-EA ‘rebalancing’ is either not necessarily required due to the relatively low imbalances, Spain or Germany, or moving in the wrong direction, France or the Netherlands.<br />June extra-EA figures are available for all countries. With the help of the real depreciation of the trade-weighted euro over the month, the extra-EA trade balance improved in June across all EA 16 countries except for Ireland, where it fell by 0.2 ppt of GDP. Over the year through June, all countries except the Netherlands saw an improvement in the trade balance as a share of GDP (see Table above).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/08/EEA_trade.jpg"><img alt="" height="468" src="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/08/EEA_trade.jpg" width="600"></a></p>
<p> Given the strong positive momentum in extra-EA net trade and the sluggish shift in intra-EA net trade, I conclude that it’s the depreciation of the real exchange – the 12.7% nominal depreciation of the euro against the dollar, for example, and/or falling relative price levels with extra-EA economies &#8211; that’s the primary driver of the improving trade balances in key periphery markets. With the strong exception of Portugal, where the intra-EA balance improved by 2.6 ppt of GDP over the year, the internal (infernal) devaluation of repressing wages through high unemployment has mixed results at best.</p>
<p>Rebecca Wilder</p>
<p>Note: I understand the imbalances lie in the financial accounts as well but this post is dedicated to trade only.<br />A point on the data: all numbers are seasonally adjusted.</p>

<p>by <a href="http://www.economonitor.com/blog/author/rwilder3">Rebecca Wilder</a></p>
<p>Today <a href="http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_PUBLIC/4-03082012-AP/EN/4-03082012-AP-EN.PDF">Eurostat released </a>its June estimate of real retail sales for the Euro area. On a month/month basis, real retail sales increased at a rate of 0.1%. However, on a trended basis, the 3-month/3-month average growth rate was down 0.7% in the three months ending in June. Given that the 3-month trended pace of contraction quickened compared to Q1, real consumption is likely to detract from Q2 GDP growth (spending components released on August 23).</p>
<p>On a Y/Y growth basis, there’s a 96% correlation between real retail sales and real private consumption by households and non-profit institutions. Using a simple linear regression, the annual growth rate of consumption should stabilize somewhat in Q2 compared to Q1.<br />\<br /><img alt="" height="362" src="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/08/EA_retail_sales_chart.jpg" width="489"></p>
<p>Across the region, real retail sales in Ireland, Estonia, and Germany are the only reported countries to see growth through Q2.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p><em>Note: the chart below illustrates the 3-Month/3-Month growth rate through June 2012 (Q2/Q1).</em><br /><a href="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/08/retail_sales_country.jpg"><img alt="" height="375" src="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/08/retail_sales_country.jpg" width="492"></a></p>
<p>On balance, Q2 domestic consumption spending in the Euro area is expected to be buoyed by Germany through June. The problem is, German retail sales growth have just a 38% correlation with real consumption growth, so the bump in retail sales won’t necessarily feed through to consumption at the aggregate level.<br />Euro area real consumption is still contracting. The question then becomes: will the pace of consumption contraction increase or decrease in coming quarters? We’ll have to watch leading indicators such as retail and consumer confidence, <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/db_indicators/surveys/documents/2012/bcs_2012_07_en.pdf">both of which deteriorated in July</a>.<br /><strong><em><br /></em></strong><br /><strong><em>Rebecca Wilder</em></strong></p>

<p>Euro Area Crisis Hits Confidence in the Core</p>
<p>France’s <a href="http://www.insee.fr/en/themes/info-rapide.asp?id=11&#038;date=20120724">INSEE business confidence</a>, Germany’s <a href="http://www.cesifo-group.de/portal/page/portal/ifoHome/a-winfo/d1index/10indexgsk">Ifo business climate</a>, and the<a href="http://www.nbb.be/DOC/DQ/E/DQ3/HISTO/PEC1207.PDF">National Bank of Belgium’s business survey </a>demonstrate ongoing infection as the Euro area debt crisis hits business expectations in the core. Through July, business confidence in Germany and France continued to slide while that in Belgium rebounded, albeit from a low base.</p>
<p>Of note, the service industries in both Germany and Belgium may offer a “ray of hope” (the Ifo Institute puts it.), as these large economic sectors are perhaps stabilizing in the surveys.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/07/bus_co.jpg"><img alt="" height="376" src="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/07/bus_co.jpg" width="503"></a></p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Furthermore, consumer confidence in the <a href="http://www.cbs.nl/en-GB/menu/themas/dossiers/conjunctuur/publicaties/conjunctuurbericht/inhoud/verwachting/2012-07-19-m10.htm">Netherlands</a> and <a href="http://www.istat.it/en/archive/67623">Italy</a> remain depressed. Notably, the July prints increased 8 and 1.1 points, respectively, over the month – is this the start of a trend, or rather a dead-cat bounce? If I were a betting girl, I’d go with the latter, given the weakness in labor markets and election cycles coming up (September in the Netherlands and TBA in Italy).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/07/cons_conf.jpg"><img alt="" height="376" src="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/07/cons_conf.jpg" width="503"></a></p>
<p>In Germany, the Ifo survey has deteriorated swiftly in recent months. This now brings this survey more in line with other business surveys, such as the German PMI, which had shown a more pronounced economic decline.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/07/ifo.jpg"><img alt="" height="376" src="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/07/ifo.jpg" width="503"></a></p>
<p>The Ifo Business Climate survey contains a wealth of information, but is generally dissected into assessment of the current business situation and expectations of the future business environment. The current environment survey, 111.6 in July, fell over the month but remains above the longer term average, 102. In contrast, expectations as regards the future business environment are falling swiftly. The Euro area crisis is impacting the business decision process.</p>
<p>Finally, as demonstrated in the Ifo Business Climate survey that highlighted its ‘significant deterioration’, the manufacturing base is leading the way down. In France and Germany, <a href="http://www.markiteconomics.com/Survey/Page.mvc/PressReleases">Markit Manufacturing PMIs </a>hit the low 40s, 43.6 and 43.3, respectively in July. This implies a quickening of the pace of contraction across the French and German manufacturing bases with not much hope of near-term relief, neither from domestic nor foreign demand. The <a href="http://www.cbs.nl/en-GB/menu/themas/dossiers/conjunctuur/publicaties/conjunctuurbericht/inhoud/verwachting/2012-07-25-m09.htm">Dutch Statistical Agency, CBS</a>, today reported further decline of Dutch manufacturing opinions in July, as manufacturers anticipate layoffs.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/07/pmi_manufacturing.jpg"><img alt="" height="442" src="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/07/pmi_manufacturing.jpg" width="503"></a></p>
<p>My only question becomes how much weakness is needed in the core (Germany) to get a(nother) significant response from the ECB?<br /><strong><em><br /></em></strong><br /><strong><em>Rebecca Wilder</em></strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>by <a href="http://www.economonitor.com/blog/author/rwilder3">Rebecca Wilder</a></p>
<p>Euro Area Imbalances Are a Symptom of the Broader Global Imbalances</p>
<p>Every year I travel to Germany to visit my in-laws, which is where I am now. Given the extra time on my hands, I’ve now mulled over a June 2012 NY Times opinion piece by <strong><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/27/opinion/germany-the-euro-winner-hardly.html?_r=2">Gunnar Beck</a>.</strong> Beck displays an interesting medley of data in support of his view that Germany cannot afford to backstop the European Monetary Union (the single currency union referred to as the Euro area, or EA). Germany itself has been the loser, not the winner, of the single currency union. His comments are loosely based on the research of the Ifo Institute’s <strong><a href="http://www.finfacts.ie/irishfinancenews/article_1020954.shtml">Hans-Werner Sinn</a>.</strong><br /><strong><br /></strong><br />Based on the ideas of Beck and Sinn, I start a short series on the benefits of membership in the EA, <em>ex-post</em> and<em> ex-ante</em>. The conclusion from this initial post: Some call the EA a microcosm of the world imbalances, i.e., Germany is to China as Spain is to the US. I disagree. I’d argue that the EA imbalances are a function of, rather than a mirror of, the broader global imbalances.</p>
<p>Let’s start by looking at the simple net trade statistics as rents derived by membership in the EA since 1999. I further Beck’s analysis on intra-EA trade (trade among the EA countries) for the original 1999 EA 11 economies. The 11 economies to meet the convergence criteria by 1999 were: Belgium, Germany, Spain, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Austria, Portugal and Finland.</p>
<p>By definition, the trade balance is the difference between total exports and total imports, both of which are affected by relative prices and membership in the EA.</p>
<p>The chart below illustrates the change in the annual intra-EA trade balance as a share of GDP during the period 1999 to 2011. Spanning the years 1999-2011, intra-EA gains from the fixed exchange rate regime within the EA have been lopsided toward Spain, Portugal, and the Netherlands.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p><em>(Note: for consistency, I use the EA 17 economies as the ‘trading partner’ for the period in the chart below. Furthermore, notice that the axis points in both charts are equal for ease of comparison.)</em><br /><a href="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/07/trade_ea_chart.jpg"><img alt="" height="433" src="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/07/trade_ea_chart.jpg" width="617"></a></p>
<p>Being a port economy, the Dutch trade ties to the EA are strong, and gains from EA trading partners have been robust, +11% of GDP spanning the years 1999-2011. Portugal and Spain have likewise benefited, however, their intra-EA net trade gains occurred exclusively since 2008. Of interest, Finland fares the worst, having seen a 5.1% (of GDP) decline in its net trade with EA partners. And Ireland, for all its praise (please see <a href="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/2012/07/03/is-ireland-the-poster-child-of-growth/">current account stats on Ireland here</a> ), saw its intra-EA net trade decline by 5% of GDP while in the EA – admittedly, there’s been a 4.2% of GDP gain in net trade with the EA since 2008.</p>
<p>Who are the winners of intra-EA trade spanning the entirety of the Euro Area? As demonstrated above, not many countries. The gains from trade came primarily from net exports from developed economies outside the EA (while I do not include a country breakdown, the large net importers are the developed economies – <a href="http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2012/01/weodata/index.aspx">see the IMF WEO database</a>).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/07/trade_world_chart.jpg"><img alt="" height="433" src="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/07/trade_world_chart.jpg" width="617"></a></p>
<p>The chart above illustrates the change in the annual total trade balance (extra- plus intra-) of the EA 11 as a share of GDP spanning the period 1999 to 2011. Here, the gains from trade are a bit less lopsided and the ‘usual suspects’ are evident. Germany was the third best performing economy by this measure, where net trade increased an average of 2.8% of GDP over the period. The Netherlands benefited the most of the EA 11; but the improvement was based exclusively on intra-EA trade. Portugal experienced gains from net trade from the rest of the world and the EA, where the total trade balance improved by 3.2% of GDP (again, exclusively in the post 2008 period).</p>
<p>Of note, France performed poorly on both counts: intra- and total net trade, -3.2% and -4.9% of GDP, respectively. In contrast, Germany performed relatively well. Being the largest economies in the EA, and given that the absolute value of the total trade balances (either deficit or surplus) exceed that of their respective intra-EA balances, I hypothesize that the global imbalances exacerbated, even caused, the EA imbalances.</p>
<p>Thus, EA imbalances are not a microcosm of the broader global imbalances, rather a symptom of global trade policy.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>by <a href="http://www.economonitor.com/blog/author/rwilder3">Rebecca Wilder</a></p>
<p>ECB Rates Policy is Clogged in Key Periphery Markets</p>
<p>How the Euro area (EA) will grow, <a href="http://www.ecb.int/press/pressconf/2012/html/is120404.en.html">according to Mario Draghi</a>:<br />
<blockquote><em>The outlook for economic activity should be supported by foreign demand, <strong>the very low short-term interest rates in the euro area</strong>, and all the measures taken to foster the proper functioning of the euro area economy.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>In this post, I address Draghi’s point that the ECB 1% refi rate will support economic activity through the lens of the mortgage market. Specifically, I find that the interest rate channel is clogged in the economies that are in most desperate need of lower rates: Spain, Portugal, and Italy.</p>
<p>Regarding ‘very low short-term interest rates’, what Draghi means is that the standard interest rate channel of monetary policy will stimulate domestic demand via increased spending by consumers and firms. If ECB policy is indeed passing through to retail credit (households and firms that borrow from banks to buy goods and services), then we should see evidence of this as falling interest rates to retail credit sectors, like those for consumer goods, home mortgage lending, loans for businesses, or even corporate credit rates to finance business investment.</p>
<p>In mortgage markets, the Euro area average borrowing rates are indeed falling. Banks started lowering mortgage borrowing rates, on average, in September 2011 in anticipation of ECB <a href="http://www.ecb.int/stats/monetary/rates/html/index.en.html">rate cuts that eventually occurred</a> (again) in November 2011. Specifically, average Euro area mortgage rates are down roughly .25% since the local peak in August 2011.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/04/rates_policy.jpg"><img alt="" height="395" src="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/04/rates_policy.jpg" width="545"></a></p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />But a closer look across mortgage markets shows a worrying trend for key periphery economies. The pass-through from ECB rate setting policy to mortgage borrowing costs is clogged in Spain, Portugal, and Italy, where mortgage rates have risen since the ECB cut the refi rate to 1%. Indeed, these are the economies that ‘need’ the stimulus to offset the fiscal consolidation.<br />Sure, mortgage rates are arguably low – but they’re not <em>lower</em>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/04/mortgage_rates_country.jpg"><img alt="" height="395" src="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/04/mortgage_rates_country.jpg" width="537"></a></p>
<p>In Spain and Portugal, 91% and 99% of their respective new stock of mortgages sit on variable rate loans, so the pass through to the real economy should be rather quick IF mortgage rates declined (see Table below). True, Spain and Portugal are unlikely to experience any boom in real estate lending over the near term. However, had the ECB policy lowered mortgage rates, then disposable income would rise via lower monthly mortgage payments, thereby stimulating other sectors of the economy, all else equal.</p>
<p>In Italy, just 47% of the mortgage market is variable, so the immediate stimulus would be more muted compared to Spain and Portugal via disposable income. However, Italy didn’t experience a credit boom, so lending to firms and households could and should be warranted. But amid the fiscal consolidation and stressed debt markets, fewer borrowers are credit worthy AND mortgage rates have risen near 1% since EA mortgage rates peak on average in August 2011.</p>
<p>Core mortgage rates are falling, and this could create a positive stimulus for Spain, Portugal, and Italy down the road. But for now, the transmission mechanism, dropping the ECB refi rate to 1%, is not easing housing and mortgage financial conditions in those economies hit hardest by fiscal austerity.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>by <a href="http://www.economonitor.com/blog/author/rwilder3">Rebecca Wilder</a>   </p>
<p>Euro Area GDP Report: Not Pretty</p>
<p>Today <a href="http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_PUBLIC/2-06032012-AP/EN/2-06032012-AP-EN.PDF">Eurostat released </a>the second estimate of Q4 2011 Gross Domestic Product. Real Euro area (EA) GDP declined 0.3% over the quarter (-1.3% on an annualized basis). In this release Eurostat provides a breakdown across region, spending categories, and industry, and is much more detailed than the preliminary flash estimate. It’s not pretty.<br />The expenditure side was very weak. Household and government consumption declined 0.4% and 0.2%, respectively, while gross capital formation tumbled 0.7%. Inventory depletion accounted for much of the reduction in investment and fixed investment deteriorated to a lesser degree. Exports fell 0.4%, while imports dropped a full 1.2%; therefore, net exports contributed +0.3% to overall GDP growth. The only positive contribution to GDP growth was imports – this type of technical growth is not sustainable.</p>
<p>As the chart below illustrates, exports has been a major driver of growth during this recovery. However, export demand is dropping off at the margin, and more weakness is expected. The level of new export orders (<a href="http://www.markiteconomics.com/MarkitFiles/Pages/ViewPressRelease.aspx?ID=9206">a component of the Markit PMI</a>) fell for eight consecutive months through February.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/03/GDP_components3.jpg"><img alt="" height="426" src="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/03/GDP_components3.jpg" width="610"></a></p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />So it it’s up to domestic demand to spur further recovery. I also have my doubts there, given that fiscal austerity pushed the unemployment rate to a historical high of 10.7% in January (rather vertically, I might add).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/03/unemployment_chart1.jpg"><img alt="" height="425" src="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/03/unemployment_chart1.jpg" width="635"></a></p>
<p>A second part of the EA GDP report was the disturbing minority of countries that posted positive growth: just three out of thirteen. French growth clearly added balance to the average, given its large weight in the index. However, there are plenty of things that can go wrong there with higher energy costs, the rising <a href="http://www.insee.fr/en/themes/info-rapide.asp?id=14">unemployment rate</a>, and minimal <a href="http://www.insee.fr/en/themes/info-rapide.asp?id=105">business confidence</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/03/Regional_growth1.jpg"><img alt="" height="433" src="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/03/Regional_growth1.jpg" width="610"></a></p>
<p>Going forward, it’s either up or down again for the EA. With the tight fiscal and now tightening monetary policy, the economy surely faces a lot of headwinds – down again would be my bet.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Barry Ritholtz, who generally knows better, <a href="http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/2012/03/isda-suckers-wanted/">blew a gasket at ISDA</a> for yesterday&#8217;s ruling that Greek bonds are not yet in default.  Specifically,<br />
<blockquote>
<blockquote>&#8220;The International Swaps and Derivatives Association said on Thursday that based on current evidence the Greek bailout would not prompt payments on the credit default swaps.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>></p>
<p>Here is a question for the crowd: Exactly how brain damaged, foolish and stupid must a trader be to ever buy one of these embarrassingly laughable instruments called derivatives?</p>
<p>The claim that Greece has not defaulted — despite refusing to make good on their obligations in full or on time — is utterly laughable.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let&#8217;s sidebar the reality—that there is no true &#8220;market&#8221; for CDS in general, let alone Sovereign Debt CDS; Donald R. van Deventer of Kamakura Corporation has been all over this, both <a href="http://www.kamakuraco.com/Blog.aspx">on his blog</a> and especially <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/dvandeventer">on Twitter</a>—and just note that ISDA made the correct decision.</p>
<p>Greece has not, to borrow Barry&#8217;s phrase, &#8220;refus[ed] to make good on their obligations in full or on time.&#8221; ISDA did not declare a Default Event yesterday because there has not yet been a Default Event.</p>
<p>Default Event is a very specific term. The sample in <a href="http://www.tavakolistructuredfinance.com/index.html">Janet Tavakoli</a>&#8216;s <em><a href="http://www.booksamillion.com/product/9780471412663?id=4214424925428">Credit Derivatives and Synthetic Structures</a></em> (a book to which I <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/02/in-other-news-larry-king-is-selling.html">have</a> <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2008/09/roubinis-not-wrong-but.html">referred</a> <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/01/third-time-someone-will-believe.html">before</a> and undoubtedly will again) runs pretty much three full pages (pp. 88-91).  But the general concept is straightforward: there is a minimum threshold (say, 10% of an issue), the principal or interest due of which the entity explicitly refuses to pay or fails to pay that then materially impacts the buyer of Credit Protection (CDS).</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />Greece has not yet refused to pay anything.*</p>
<p>There is a payment due on 20 March—19 days still in the future. The financial markets—heck, everyone who runs a diner in Queens—may well believe that no payment will be made on 20 March, but that hasn&#8217;t happened yet.  And the Greek government specifically has <em>not</em> said it won&#8217;t make the payment; it has said, &#8220;Hey, take these bonds instead.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is true that, <em>cet. par.</em>, the market value of the bonds being offered is about 25% the supposed economic value of the current ones. So anyone taking the deal would have to be assuming that the <em>market</em> value of the current bonds is somewhere around 25, just as the French and German banks have them marked.</p>
<p>The market may also agree that one of the reasons people may well accept the offer is that, otherwise, they expect that the Greeks <em>will</em> default on the current bonds.  </p>
<p>But they haven&#8217;t yet, and this is not <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0181689/">Minority Report</a> (though we can all agree Phil Dick would recognize, if not approve of, the current financial world).</p>
<p>So ISDA correctly ruled—the key phrase is &#8220;based on current evidence&#8221;—that there is not yet a Default Event.  If everyone says &#8220;we will tender our securities due 20 March for the exchange offered,&#8221; there will not be a default of those bonds.</p>
<p>You, I, and Bill Gross can all agree that the likelihood of this happening is about equal to the chance that Rick Perry will be elected U.S. President this year.  But there has not been a Default Event.</p>
<p>Wait two or three weeks.</p>
<p>The thing Barry most overlooks is that yesterday&#8217;s ISDA ruling is, if anything, <em>good</em> for CDS buyers.</p>
<p>What will be the economic difference of waiting to holders of the CDSes?  I don&#8217;t know for certain, but if you&#8217;re looking at the standard ISDA CDS contract, there&#8217;s a reasonable assumption that (1) the market price of the bond will not change for the better and (2) it is a certainty that the Accrued Interest on the bond will be greater when they declare a Default Event than it is now.</p>
<p>Keep in mind: in a standard CDS, declaration of default <em>terminates the contract</em>. Accruals end, market pricing is to be determined by calling a few dealers, and the only thing left is to go through the pockets and look for loose change.**</p>
<p>Yesterday&#8217;s ISDA ruling means the CDS buyers will be owed more Accrued Interest when (in two, or at most three, weeks) a Default Event is declared.</p>
<p>What about the principal repayment due?  Recall again that the payment due is generally the net of the current market price <em>subtracted from</em> the initial principal amount (assumed to be par—100—but in any event greater than the current market value).</p>
<p>I&#8217;m inclined to argue there is optimism in the current market that will not be there in two weeks: it&#8217;s not that liquid a market, there is a floor on the price of the economic equivalent of the new offer, and there is time value in the option to convert.***</p>
<p>If ISDA had declared default yesterday—that is, assumed that Greece wasn&#8217;t just &#8220;mostly dead&#8221;****—they would have taken the current market price [P<sub>0</sub>]. Even before the delays and roundelays, that was likely to be greater than the market price of those bonds in a week or two[P<sub>1</sub>, when default is declared.</p>
<p>That is, P<sub>0</sub> is greater than P<sub>1</sub>. And since the payment due is based on [100*****-P<sub>t</sub>], the principal amount due to CDS holders when default is declared will also be greater.</p>
<p>ISDA followed the letter of the contract: the Greeks have not yet defaulted on an obligation, nor have they stated that they intend to do so.  When they do—there are few, if any, in the market who would treat the clause as a possible &#8220;If&#8221;—a Default Event will be declared and the CDS contracts will be expected to pay as they are due. And that payment will, in all likelihood, be higher than the payment that would have been due if ISDA had ruled differently yesterday.</p>
<p>And if they don&#8217;t, then I&#8217;ll be agreeing with Barry that the whole thing was a scam from the start—though I would still argue that JPMorganChaseBear stealing more than $1,000,000,000 in customer funds from MF Global clients is a bigger one, which is something like saying that coprophagia is even worse in liquid form.</p>
<p>When the CDS contracts actually have to be paid, then the fun will begin. If potential for insolvency is your idea of fun. But that&#8217;s another story.</p>
<p>*They have seen S&#038;P downgrade their credit rating, but that&#8217;s a separate issue.</p>
<p>**Obligatory reference.  It will pay off.</p>
<p>***The Worst Case scenario is that you assume the new bonds are the only value in the transaction, and discount their value back over the cost of basically two-week money. The best case scenario is some combination of the price of the new bonds and expectations of either getting a better deal later and/or post-litigation gains.  The lattice may be ugly, but it yields an expected value higher than the Worst Case, and therefore higher than the market price of the bonds as the time to exercise approaches.</p>
<p>****See ** above.</p>
<p>*****Or the other initial contract price; in any case, a fixed value greater than P<sub>t</sub>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>by <a href="http://www.economonitor.com/blog/author/rwilder3">Rebecca Wilder</a>  </p>
<p><strong>Does Latvia Give Us Any Clues?</strong></p>
<p>Short answer: yes, as long as global trade growth is negligible.</p>
<p>Over the weekend I came across a December <a href="http://www.cepr.net/documents/publications/latvia-2011-12.pdf">CEPR paper about the Latvian economy</a>. Authors Mark Weisbrot and Rebecca Ray highlight the Latvian experience with internal devaluation, which may prove to be a case study for the current Eurozone model of internal devaluation by the program countries (Ireland, Portugal, and Greece). Weisbrot and Ray find the following (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote><p><em>The paper also finds that Latvia’s net exports contributed little or nothing to the economic recovery over the past year and a half. <strong>This means that “internal devaluation” cannot have succeeded in bringing about the recovery. Rather, it appears that the recovery resulted from the government not adopting the fiscal tightening for 2010 that was prescribed by the IMF, and also from an expansionary monetary policy caused by rising inflation. </strong>The data contradict the notion that Latvia’s experience provides an example of successful internal devaluation.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Note: Internal devaluation is Europe’s favored prescription for any country seeking liquidity assistance; it refers to the process by which an EZ country that cannot devalue its currency reduces relative costs (wages) and prices by raising the unemployment rate in order to shift export income in favor of the deflating economy.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Internal devaluation didn’t work for Latvia, as evidenced by export demand. I wondered, though, how has real export demand performed for the current program countries, Ireland, Portugal, and Greece? Have these countries followed Latvia’s path?</p>
<p>To date, as regards to export income, internal devaluation appears to be working in Ireland and Portugal but not in Greece. For comparison to Latvia, I illustrate the path of real exports and imports spanning 2005Q1 through 2011Q3, as demonstrated for Latvia on <a href="http://www.cepr.net/index.php/publications/reports/latvias-internal-devaluation-a-success-story">page 14 of the CEPR paper</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/02/ireland_nx.jpg"><img alt="" height="400" src="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/02/ireland_nx.jpg" width="600"></a><a href="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/02/portugal_nx.jpg"><img alt="" height="389" src="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/02/portugal_nx.jpg" width="600"></a><a href="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/02/greece_nx.jpg"><img alt="" height="390" src="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/02/greece_nx.jpg" width="600"></a></p>
<p>Similar to Latvia’s experience, real import demand deteriorated in the face of fiscal austerity, especially in the case of Ireland and Greece. In contrast to Latvia’s experience, though, real exports in Ireland and Portugal are roughly 6% and 8%, respectively, above levels in 2007Q1. The Greek experience looks more like that of Latvia, as real imports and exports plummeted below pre-crisis levels, having yet to recover.</p>
<p>As <a href="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/2012/02/21/2011/12/16/ea-infernal-devaluation-progressing/">I highlighted in a December post</a>, relative unit labor costs have been cut in the case of all program countries, so internal devaluation is evident. (Note: the chart in the post illustrates the 4-q average Y/Y growth in nominal unit labor costs compared to the EA overall – it’s not intended to be a thorough examination of real exchange rates.) But has that been the driving force behind the export growth?</p>

<p>The resurgence in global trade has been an influential factor in the case of Ireland and Portugal. The chart above illustrates the Dutch estimate of world trade. Notably, there was a resurgence of trade spanning mid 2009 to Q1 2011, which support European exports broadly. It’s difficult, in this respect, to attribute all of the export success to internal devaluation.</p>
<p>Going forward, Ireland and Portugal are very likely slaves to global demand for exports. Prospects there are not looking too bright, given the slowdown in Asia.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I do think that Latvia serves as a warning for EA program countries. Internal devaluation is impossible for those countries with high private sector leverage without a burst of external demand. Unfortunately, the burst of external demand seems to have passed.<br />(Insert here a discussion of the 3-sector financial balances model, and why Ireland depends exclusively on generous export income to facilitate economic growth).</p>
