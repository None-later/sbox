                                <p>No wonder Brad DeLong <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/04/chris-edley-on.html">has had no luck persuading Christopher Edley to get rid of the malfeasant John Yoo</a>.  As <a href="http://www.dailyhowler.com/dh051710.html">Bob Somersby observes</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Christopher Edley thinks he’s one of your “betters.” It’s hard to believe, but that’s the exceptionally low-IQ framework this self-proclaimed member of the elite enunciated in Sunday’s piece. According to Edley, rubes like us should want our “betters” in important posts, like the post in which Kagan will serve:<br />
<blockquote>EDLEY: The tension between elitism and populism is embedded in our national DNA because America rejected the model of a monarch ruling by divine right in favor of an iffy experiment in democratic self-governance. So now you are responsible for choosing your leader. Do you want someone like you or someone better than you?</p></blockquote>
<p>What an astonishing framework! But so it goes when people like Edley spends decades inside institutions like Harvard, convincing themselves that they and their peers are “better” than all the rest of us rubes. [formatting in original]</p></blockquote>
<p>Kagan, like Yoo, &#8220;has excelled in a meritocratic system, one that is selective yet far more open than in generations past.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bonus quote from Edley:<br />
<blockquote>The gatekeeper power of such institutions is why it was so important to desegregate them (using affirmative action, among other tools) and why virtually all leaders of great universities talk about diversity and access.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yep.  Elena Kagan is All About Diversity.</p>
<p>At least <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/04/scott-horton-on.html">Edley is consistent</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Dean Edley rolls embarrassingly off the tracks.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>So there are several comments to <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/02/working-refs.html">my previous post</a>. Ignoring the a good one from Dr. DeLong, several people are taking umbrage at my unsubtle suggestion that the effect on employment being suggested is, to be polite about it, rather creative.</p>
<p>kharris begins, &#8220;So let me see if I have this right.  If anybody tries to figure out what the impact of snow on economic data might be, they are big fat liars?  But those who know that the economy is in bad shape, without reference to actual events, is a stand-up kind of hack?&#8221;</p>
<p>Following is an expansion of my comment in that thread, with data:</p>
<p>To the second question, well, I may be a hack, but my stand-up days are in the past. But given the choice between believing that the recovery is in full swing and that long-term unemployment is getting worse and jobs are not and will not be created, well, I&#8217;ll take <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/108xx/doc10871/BudgetOutlook2010_Jan.cfm">the CBO projection</a> as the baseline:<br />
<blockquote>CBO expects the unemployment rate to average a little over 10 percent for the first half of 2010, and it will probably not dip below 9 percent until 2012.</p></blockquote>
<p>and note that if we&#8217;re calling that a recovery, our definitions have become Very Generous.  So bold claims of recovery need to be tempered by the prospect of worse headline unemployment (U-3) for the next five months (including February) and no significant recovery for the eighteen after all.</p>
<p>Sorry I&#8217;m not doing handstands that GDP might be slightly positive for a few quarters of sub-replacement level employment increases, but I didn&#8217;t cheer the &#8220;recovery&#8221; of 2002 either, so at least I&#8217;m a consistent hack.</p>
<p>To the first: Not at all; trying to figure out the effect is fair game and perfectly reasonable.  But the declarations so far are all running in one direction: we believe the economy is better than the data will be, so we need to wait if it looks bad.  (See <a href="http://www.calculatedriskblog.com/2010/02/auto-sales-blame-it-on-snow-and-toyota.html">Ms. Caldwell as quoted by CR</a> or <a href="http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/02/26/snowmageddon-still-has-time-to-kill-health-care-reform/">Catherine Rampell</a>, for example.)  Rampell:<br />
<blockquote>That report will probably be very, very ugly. I have seen some forecasters project job losses as high as 100,000.</p>
<p>The main culprit behind the expected jobs plunge is the blizzard, which closed businesses and kept people from going to work or even seeking work for days and sometimes weeks. These work stoppages probably occurred precisely when the government was collecting data for its February jobs report.</p></blockquote>
<p>So the current estimates are all that (1) demand was down and (2) employment was down.</p>
<p>And (3) deliveries were down: see <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2010/03/01/ism-manufacturing-index-shows-impact-of-snow/">the ISM data</a>.<br />
<blockquote> Put it all together, and you can tell a story of heavy snow snarling shipments to and from manufacturers, slowing down production growth.</p></blockquote>
<p>But at least in this case, we have a clear indicator: the increase in backlogged orders.</p>
<p>Finally, (4)<a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2010/03/01/after-the-tape-new-frugality-not-so-fast/">savings</a>.<br />
<blockquote>The reasons for the stall are twofold: For one, rebounding wealth since the recession’s depths has helped provide some support for consumer spending. Secondly, weak income growth has left other consumers with little choice but to spend proportionally more of their incomes, particularly in light of [5] still-tight credit conditions.</p></blockquote>
<p>So demand, supply, savings, credit, and employment are all down.  The first and second are aberrations of snow (and equilibrium), the second and third abide.</p>
<p>Which leaves employment, which is discussed in more detail than most sane people would want below the fold.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />Now, it is clear that people who are employed did not work in the week. But they are not likely to have reported themselves as &#8220;unemployed&#8221; or (except in a very literal sense) &#8220;out of work.&#8221;  True, they did not produce—but what they would have produced was not bought, and hence there is a backlog of orders.</p>
<p>But companies that now have backlogs of orders know that this was because they did not have their current workforce.  Accept an order to produce, say, 200 units (which takes a month to produce) and lose five to eight business days and you&#8217;ll be 50-80 units behind.</p>
<p><strong><em>But you&#8217;re not going to go out and hire a new person to fill the backlog.</em></strong></p>
<p>Yes, there was an effect on production and sales. But the idea that 100-200K jobs went unfulfilled solely because of weather conditions that were aberrant primarily in the mid-Continent is either (1) rather optimistic or (2) ignoring that the excess snow effect was mostly in the areas that are least underemployed. (See  <a href="http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/01/underemployment-state-by-state/">this nice map from Catherine Rampell</a>)</p>
<p>So in the best case scenario, the recovery was muted because things were not delivered or sold—though money (savings) was (were) spent.  And the only reason firms didn&#8217;t hire was the snowstorm that closed D.C. and delayed Philadelphia. (Though there was no snow in NYC and, as noted, nothing unusual about the fallings in the Midwest.)</p>
<p>The worst case scenario is that demand wasn&#8217;t filled solely because supply wasn&#8217;t available because existing workers could not produce.  Working on the &#8220;nine women pregnant for a month don&#8217;t produce a baby and you have a real problem eight months thereafter&#8221; rule, employers will (generally correctly) view their February backlog as a result of existing labor not working, not as a need to hire new workers. </p>
<p>If you&#8217;re balancing the effects of those two—standard <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slutsky_equation">Slutsky analysis</a>, as it were—there is a high likelihood that hiring will be dampened <em>going forward</em> by the snowstorm as firms underestimate actual demand.  It is less likely that actual hiring was significantly reduced by it.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s not the way the discussion is going. So a bad (negative) number has excuses, a poor number (positive, but less than replacement rate) has excuses and should be seen as &#8220;good,&#8221; and a good number (replacement rate or better) will mean &#8220;all ahead full.&#8221;</p>
<p>So I tried looking at ancillary data.  Looking at <a href="http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/electricity/epm/epm_sum.html">power usage</a>, for instance, indicates a major decline that would correspond to less activity(Table 1.6.b; Commercial usage YOY down 3.6%; Industrial usage YOY down 5.6% with declines in all areas; total usage down 4.3% YOY [Table 1.1])—but that&#8217;s only through November.</p>
<p>Maybe the past three months have been part of a miraculous recovery.  But it&#8217;s not in employment, its not in the available energy usage data, and it doesn&#8217;t follow from the ISM data, which indicates slow growth at best.</p>
<p>Those who want to claim the economy is recovered have been, as noted, &#8220;working the refs.&#8221; So a bad number (by Rampell&#8217;s apparent reasoning) will kill health care reform, but not mean that we need a second stimulus—even though <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2010/02/26/state-budgets-still-falling-like-its-2008/">the states are hemorrhaging money and, soon, jobs</a>. (Teachers, police and fire&#8211;you know, all the nonessential personnel.)</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a heads-we-win-tails-we-win-more situation being set up.</p>
<p>If we pretend that all of the argument are true: that the snowstorm was a once-in-a-lifetime event and that it really did produce a major skew though, we might want to look at what happened the last time a &#8220;once-in-a-lifetime event&#8221; occurred near the end of a recession.

For a week in September, everyone—and this time I mean <em>everyone</em>, not just the bottom third of the Bos-Wash corridor—stopped shopping for a week.  As predicted above, the employment effects abided for at least the next few months. (Recall, after all, that that recession <a href="http://www.nber.org/cycles/cyclesmain.html">officially</a> ended in November.)</p>
<p>Given the choice between (1) assuming that there will be a one-off decline in employment due to the snow and that everything will return to recovery next month or (2) that there will be a lingering, negative employment effect from the snowstorm and attendant business slowdowns, there appears to be only one way to bet, given the data and the history.</p>
<p>Yet the calls right now—absent evidence—are going the other way.</p>
<p>If we&#8217;re working from anecdotal evidence, then certainly there is a recovery. It&#8217;s the extant data that doesn&#8217;t support any recovery that is not also described as &#8220;jobless and uncertain.&#8221; That may change on Friday.  But it&#8217;s not the way to bet, no matter how much the refs are worked.</p>

                                <p>Brad DeLong&#8217;s famous rule (Originally: &#8220;If you think Paul Krugman must be wrong, <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2009/05/this-is-getting-damned-annoying-will-i-ever-be-allowed-to-disagree-with-paul-krugman-again-about-anything-niall-ferguson-e.html">you severely overestimated Niall Ferguson</a>&#8220;) needs a corollary.</p>
<p>If Olivier Blanchard says your macroeconomic policy doesn&#8217;t work, and that <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB20001424052748704337004575059542325748142.html">you should double your inflation target to make it reasonable</a>, it&#8217;s worth trying:<br />
<blockquote>The International Monetary Fund&#8217;s top economist, Olivier Blanchard, says central bankers should consider aiming for a higher inflation rate than they do currently to lessen the chances of repeating the recent severe recession.</p>
<p>&#8230;[T]he global economic downturn revealed flaws in macroeconomic policy, especially the reliance primarily on interest rates to manage economies. Although Japan had fallen into a decade-long funk despite low inflation and low interest rates, &#8220;most people convinced themselves that the Japanese didn&#8217;t know what they were doing,&#8221; Mr. Blanchard said in an interview.</p>
<p>In particular, [Mr. Blanchard&#8217;s new paper with two other IMF economists, Giovanni Dell&#8217;Ariccia and Paolo Mauro] suggests shooting for a higher-level inflation in &#8220;normal time in order to increase the room for monetary policy to react to such shocks.&#8221; Central banks may want to target 4% inflation, rather than the 2% target that most central banks now try to achieve, the IMF paper says.</p>
<p>At a 4% inflation rate, Mr. Blanchard says, short-term interest rates in placid economies likely would be around 6% to 7%, giving central bankers far more room to cut rates before they get near zero, after which it is nearly impossible to cut short-term rates further.</p></blockquote>
<p>None of the major Macro work ever done, from Barro forward, has ever found damage to economic growth from 4% inflation.</p>
<p>The paper is <a href="http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/spn/2010/spn1003.pdf">available here</a> (PDF).</p>

                                <p>Brad DeLong and John Cochrane agree on something.  I must dissent.</p>
<p><a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2010/01/why-are-we-still-in-a-recession-the-shape-of-the-crisis-and-too-big-to-fail.html">Delong and Cochrane agree that</a> <br />
<blockquote>&#8220;The underlying decline in wealth from the housing bust was &#8230; around $400 billion. &#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Indeed, relative to the size of the economy the losses during the crash of the dot-com bubble were four times as large.</p></blockquote>
<p>I object that the two sums being compared are not comparable at all.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>OK so this was a comment on DeLong so when you see &#8220;you&#8221; read &#8220;DeLong&#8221;</p>
<p>Why do you compare the losses during the crash of the dot-com bubble to the $400 billion rather than to the $25 trillion ?</p>
<p>The losses during the crash of the housing bubble are, you claim, $25 trillion.  </p>
<p>Someone who has forgotten 2000 (or 1999 or 2001 or &#8230; well I clearly am that someone) would compare the $400 billion to the decline in the value of shares of corporations with names which ended .com.  I don&#8217;t think that was $ 1.2 trillion.</p>
<p>For some reason, you and Cochrane count the whole loss around that time as the dot.com shock and only losses on subprime mortgages this time. The former value of the former shares of Lehman isn&#8217;t in the sum which equals $ 400 billion.</p>
<p>I think that it is possible to distinguish the shock due to burst bubbles from the total consequences in a meaningful way.  I&#8217;d say the reasonable comparison is the total decline in share values then to the total decline in the value of housing now.  The current bubble loss would be about $ 6 trillion for the USA not $ 400 billion.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t make sense to compare total losses then to losses born by banks now and conclude that the losses born by banks now are smaller than total losses then, but a lot of damange was done because all of the losses born by banks now were born by banks.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d say that in the US alone, and ignoring commercial real estate, about $ 6 trillion in &#8220;wealth&#8221; <a href="http://understandingthemarket.com/?p=16">was revealed to be a fantasy</a>. </p>
<p>That&#8217;s gotta to hurt.  It hurt even more because investment banks shared the rubes delusions this time, but the delusion was huge and the so was the delusione (disappointment)</p>

                                <p>The world would be a much better place if people <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/08/thanks-to-ben-bernanke-ben-bernanke.html">had listened to Tom last August</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Now some <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/20/business/20bernanke.html?hp">elite opinion</a> favors Ben Bernanke&#8217;s reappointment, but politicians are irritated over Fed stonewalling of bailout oversight and others (e.g. <a href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/beat_the_press_archive?month=08&#038;year=2009&#038;base_name=marketplace_radio_skips_the_bu">Dean Baker</a>) point out that Ben Bernanke who put the Fed throttles to the firewall to save the world is also the Ben Bernanke who carried over Greenspan policy until it was too late. [links in original]</p></blockquote>
<p>Not a strong enough source for you?  How about <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2010/01/the-internets-chief-bernanke-apologist-officer-speaks.html">the Internet&#8217;s Chief Bernanke Apologist</a>?  Brad DeLong <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2009/08/obama-to-reappoint-fed-chairman-ben-bernanke---wsjcom.html">last August</a>:<br />
<blockquote>I am surprised that he is being reappointed. I would have thought that the combination of people angry because he has given too much public money to the banks and people angry because he didn&#8217;t stop the recession would together make him damaged and that Obama would want to bring in a fresh face&#8211;never mind that Bernanke had no way to try to lessen the recession save by policy steps that inevitably involve giving money to the banks.</p></blockquote>
<p>Tom also dealt with that:<br />
<blockquote>To which the obvious response is, duh, who says it has to be one or the other? A reality-based critique of the bailouts allows them to be both effective at saving the world and unconscionable screw-jobs that kept an array of bad actors from paying for their greed and incompetence. (The latter clearly feeds a lot of the underlying sentiment of the tea partiers, even if it&#8217;s ultimately the greedy and incompetent who are marshalling it.) However, considering Team Obama&#8217;s political tone-deafness, it&#8217;ll be a pleasant but major surprise if they let Bernanke go back to Princeton for some R&#038;R.</p></blockquote>
<p>And DeLong himself (today) <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2010/01/25/economists-react-should-bernanke-stay-at-the-fed/"><s>moves the goalposts</s>notes where the problem is centered</a>:<br />
<blockquote>[Bernanke] is no longer the academic intellectual who advocates inflation targetting. He is, instead, the voice for the consensus of the Federal Open Market Committee–and a member of that committee who can, by his own internal arguments, move that consensus at the margin. So he is going to reflect that consensus&#8230;.[A] Fed chair who doesn&#8217;t reflect the consensus in public has less power to move the consensus in private. From my perspective, I don’t think that there’s anything wrong with Ben Bernanke’s (private, intellectual, academic) analysis of the current situation. What is wrong is that the FOMC consensus is wrong—and Bernanke’s public statements reflect that wrong consensus. So here I tend to blame Obama more than I blame Bernanke for the recent character of Bernanke’s public statements–for the fact that Fed policy and rhetoric right now is not more Gagnonesque, because Obama could have done things over the past year to move the FOMC consensus that he has not done. [emphases mine]</p></blockquote>
<p>This is a true statement—but it is no less true now than it was in August, and Ben Bernanke has been the ostensible leader of the FRB since then—and, indeed, since 2.5 years before then, as the crisis was unfolding.</p>
<p>In the past four years, Bernanke has &#8220;led&#8221; the Federal Reserve.  And even those who are not sympathetic to <a href="http://pragcap.com/steve-keen-the-economic-case-against-bernanke">Steve Keen&#8217;s interpretation of Bernanke&#8217;s flaws</a> (h/t Yves and Naked Capitalism, <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2010/01/steve-keen-the-economic-case-against-bernanke.html">who printed it themselves as well</a>) would have to agree that the sounds coming from the <a href="http://dallasfed.org/news/speeches/fisher/2010/fs100112.cfm">Fishers</a>* and <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/feds-hoenig-urges-quick-action-on-sharp-rate-hike-2010-01-07">Hoenigs</a>, not to mention <a href="http://www.antemedius.com/content/bernanke-wants-steal-social-security-and-medicare-pay-wall-street-excesses">Bernanke himself</a>, are more reminiscent of <a href="http://lefarkins.blogspot.com/2010/01/creeping-morgenthauism.html">Morgenthau</a> than <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/charles-gasparino/volcker-is-finally-gettin_b_435726.html">Volcker</a>.</p>
<p>Which should have been the death knell for his renomination.  To turn Brad DeLong&#8217;s statement on its side:  Ben Bernanke has been unable to lead and change the consensus of the Federal Reserve Board, even marginally, to be more in line with what Ben Bernanke, the skilled economist, knows would be a better policy.</p>
<p>Leaders lead.  Ben Bernanke hasn&#8217;t and doesn&#8217;t.*  For that alone, he should be replaced, and Janet Yellen nominated to replace him.</p>
<p>*This one was reprinted, without several of the cronyism acknowledgements, in the WSJ comics section today. I prefer the original.</p>
<p>**The similarity to the Canadian Liberal Party&#8217;s selection of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St%C3%A9phane_Dion#Liberal_Leadership_candidate_.28April.E2.80.93December_2006.29"><s>Celine</s> Stephane Dion</a> as their leader should not be overlooked.  That they had the good sense to replace him after one term is a sign of sanity the Obama Administration would have been wise to consider. (That they compounded the mistake by replacing him with a pro-torture American conservative is a mistake from which one would expect the Obama Administration could and presumably will learn.)</p>

<p>Shorter [1] <a href="http://www.econbrowser.com/archives/2010/01/why_bernanke_sh.html">Jim Hamilton</a> (via [2] <a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BradDelongsSemi-dailyJournal/~3/D-II2hpzcU4/a-disproof-of-the-rational-senator-hypothesis.html">Brad DeLong</a>):<br />
<blockquote>Ben Bernanke&#8217;s record leaves nine links&#8217; worth of things to be desired, but considering the zombie ex-Fed Chair alternatives (plus <s>Brett Fav-</s>Paul Volcker), he deserves to be confirmed for a second term.</p></blockquote>
<p>I am almost not kidding.  Here&#8217;s what Hamilton actually asks Bernanke&#8217;s critics:<br />
<blockquote>I wonder which of [sic] previous Fed Chairs critics think would be better for the job  than Bernanke. Surely you don&#8217;t think we&#8217;d have been better off bringing Alan  Greenspan back?  [touché] G. William Miller [deceased] fumbled badly with much simpler problems. Arthur Burns [also deceased] is a  case study in how not to conduct monetary policy.</p></blockquote>
<p>Would DeLong accept this sort of argument from a Berkeley undergrad seeking a decent grade? The question of far greater interest is why critics should have preferred Bernanke to prospective candidates who might have the combination of background and metabolic function to carry out the job — say, <a href="http://www.frbsf.org/federalreserve/people/officers/yellen.html">Janet Yellen</a> or <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/~blinder/bio.htm">Alan Blinder</a> — and might also do better than Bernanke in a <a href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/beat_the_press_archive?month=12&#038;year=2009&#038;base_name=if_bernanke_did_not_know_the_f">pop quiz on the Fed&#8217;s dual mission</a>.</p>
<p>Nor does Hamilton impress in reviewing the (admittedly odd) politics of Bernanke&#8217;s reappointment:<br />
<blockquote>I shake my head when I look at the list of senators who say they&#8217;ll vote &#8220;no.&#8221; How could there possibly be an alternative whom Barbara Boxer (D-CA) and Jim DeMint (R-SC) would both prefer to Bernanke?</p></blockquote>
<p>Obviously an alternative candidate need not be preferred by both Boxer and DeMint.  An SDJ commenter rightly notes that DeMint&#8217;s opposition is in the nature of a political stunt, that is rejecting the rightmost potential nominee for Fed Chair to try to help along the development of the Obama political suicide machine. (They may not <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/26/us/politics/26budget.html?hp">need the help</a>.) As little as they act like it, the Democrats hold a sizeable majority of Senate seats, and a reasonable choice of a Democratic monetary policy technocrat ought to have little trouble lining up at least 59 votes.  As for the sixtieth, I&#8217;d have liked to see the Republican Senate caucus hold ranks in preventing a Yellen nomination from receiving an up-or-down vote.</p>

                                <p>It&#8217;s bad enough to violate <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2009/03/i-think-paul-krugman-is-wrong.html">Brad DeLong&#8217;s first rule</a> (which, I hasten to rationalize, was posted when DeLong himself was disagreeing).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worse when the opposition to Krugman is coming from&#8230;the WSJ editorial page. (Or, as Barry Ritholtz correctly describes it, &#8220;<a href="http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/2010/01/wsj-jumps-the-shark/">the comics section</a>.&#8221; Just less funny, and more likely to make the two-drink minimum unnecessary.)</p>
<p>This seems to be a direct violation of <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2009/10/paul-krugmans-guide-to-reading-the-wall-street-journal-editorial-page.html">reality</a>.</p>
<p>But compare <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/25/opinion/25krugman.html?pagewanted=print">the Krugman &#8220;endorsement&#8221;</a>:<br />
<blockquote>But — and here comes my defense of a Bernanke reappointment — any good alternative for the position would face a bruising fight in the Senate. And choosing a bad alternative would have truly dire consequences for the economy.</p>
<p>Furthermore, policy decisions at the Fed are made by committee vote. And while Mr. Bernanke seems insufficiently concerned about unemployment and too concerned about inflation, many of his colleagues are worse. Replacing him with someone less established, with less ability to sway the internal discussion, could end up strengthening the hands of the inflation hawks and doing even more damage to job creation.</p></blockquote>
<p>with <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703415804575023343729336972.html">the WSJ</a>:<br />
<blockquote>No matter how it plays out, Ben Bernanke&#8217;s bruising confirmation battle has damaged the U.S. Federal Reserve&#8217;s clout and perceived independence.</p>
<p>Mr. Bernanke is more than the Fed&#8217;s chief decision maker. Fed officials see him as their brand, a smart, honest and stoic voice best able to defend decisions of the past two years to a skeptical Congress and public. Even if the Senate backs Mr. Bernanke this week, he won&#8217;t speak with the same authority, and the Fed will have a harder time casting itself as above partisan politics.</p>
<p>Fortunately for the Fed, the hard call about when to raise interest rates doesn&#8217;t need to be made now. Fortunately for Mr. Bernanke, his support inside the Obama administration, and even more so inside the Fed, is solid. But the longer the battle drags on, the more it could interfere with the Fed&#8217;s ability to communicate convincingly. And no matter what, the Fed will have less sway as Congress debates whether to rein in its powers.</p></blockquote>
<p>Oh, wait.  That&#8217;s a news article.  The <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704562504575021704013095196.html">editorial page</a> throws a few random facts:<br />
<blockquote>Mr. Bernanke continues to deny any Fed monetary culpability for creating the mania. Shortly after the New Year, even with his nomination pending, Mr. Bernanke issued an apologia that was striking for its willingness to play to the Congressional theory of the meltdown by blaming bankers and lax regulators. [note: lax regulators includes the Fed itself.]</p></blockquote>
<p>with semi-credible analysis:<br />
<blockquote>Others argue that any alternative to Mr. Bernanke could be worse, and that is certainly a risk. Mr. Geithner and White House economic adviser Larry Summers couldn&#8217;t be confirmed, even in a Democratic Senate. In the short term if Mr. Bernanke is defeated, Vice Chairman Donald Kohn might run the Open Market Committee, and he shares Mr. Bernanke&#8217;s contempt for Fed critics. President Obama could also select San Francisco Fed President Janet Yellen, but she thinks the Fed should be even easier. [Oh, the evil of Ms. Yellen, who immediately replaces Laura D&#8217;Andrea Tyson as my pick to run the Fed.]</p></blockquote>
<p>with sheer insanity:<br />
<blockquote>We agree that the Fed needed to ease money precipitously when the financial markets suffered their heart attack in late 2008, and we praised Mr. Bernanke for that at the time and since. But the issue for the next four years is whether the Fed can extricate itself from its historic interventions before it creates a new round of boom and bust. We already see signs that it has waited too long to move.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, because—along with more obvious indicators—Durable Goods orders have been <a href="http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/2010/01/more-fun-with-numbers/">down two months in a row</a>. Anyone betting January will be up?  I fear they have used &#8220;real&#8221; tea leaves <a href="http://www.mahalo.com/how-to-brew-marijuana-tea">to make their tea</a>.</p>
<p>So the WSJ came to the right conclusion for all the wrong reasons, while Krugman comes to the wrong conclusion for the right reasons.  </p>
<p>How did we get here? in the next post.</p>

<p>This will be a long post.  Even with all the pictures above the fold.</p>
<p>It started with a finger exercise during my daughter’s swim team practice:</p>
<p>Just in case you thought I was picking on The Big C in <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/12/much-to-my-amazement.html">my previous post</a>, let us look at the other major financial institutions (Too Big to Fail, or TBTF, Banks) over the same time period.</p>
<p>The Remaining Investment Banks:</p>

<p>While Goldman Sachs—as with most of the other so-called Winners—shows a significant upturn and major gains since the beginning of 2009, Morgan Stanley’s appreciation has been rather less apparent.  However, both have returned only to approximately the price they held during the interregnum (after Bear Stearns fell but while Lehman Brothers ignored the warning and decided not to right the ship).</p>
<p>The Mortgage Lending Leaders:</p>

<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/SyufHQfVEkI/AAAAAAAAAWc/owd0PWtCXb0/s1600-h/JPMsince2006.JPG"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/SyufHQfVEkI/AAAAAAAAAWc/owd0PWtCXb0/s400/JPMsince2006.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a> </p>
<p>Both firms show an increase in stock performance beginning in Q1 of 2009.  Wells Fargo had a precipitous dive after LEH filed bankruptcy, but recovered in a similar amount of time.  JPMorganChase, having acquired Bear for either a song or too much money, remains below the level it reached during the interregnum, but solidly in the middle of its range since 2006. </p>
<p>The Consumers-as-Profit-Center (“Retail”) Banks:</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/SyufW23DoMI/AAAAAAAAAWk/qeWpaN62KBQ/s1600-h/COFsince2006.JPG"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/SyufW23DoMI/AAAAAAAAAWk/qeWpaN62KBQ/s400/COFsince2006.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/Syufg2H-ySI/AAAAAAAAAWs/QnoG293TUkk/s1600-h/BACsince2006.JPG"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/Syufg2H-ySI/AAAAAAAAAWs/QnoG293TUkk/s400/BACsince2006.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>As is apparent, Capital One’s stock decline was not precipitated by the proximate solvency crisis itself, but rather by the decline in earnings and profits, and deflation in wages, that was in full swing by early 2006.  While Bank of America does not have that preamble, it sees a similar decline in its stock price from the middle of 2007.  By the time the recession is officially declared, the trend has started. And while Bear’s fire sale to JPM causes a decline in bank stocks, it is not until LEH that BAC mirrors its competitors above.  More like MS than GS, BAC’s recovery to less than one-half of its pre-recession trading price suggests that the market is less confident than management that the firm’s major issues are behind it.</p>
<p>But one thing abides.  The market isn&#8217;t happy.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />Even as we might divide this squad into Winners (GS, JPM, WFC), Losers (C, MS), and Also-Rans (COF, BAC), six of those seven (exception: JPM) appear to be viewed by the market as no stronger than they were during the interregnum, the time when everyone was waiting to see if the other shoe would drop.</p>
<p>There are certainly other reasons the stock price might be down: insider selling at the firms is at record or near-record levels, and sooner or later people will figure out that <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/article/most-recent-insider-selling-buying-ratio-821">when insiders are selling at 82:1 levels is not the best time to buy</a>.  Their loans are down (post on that coming soon) while, as Linda <a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2009/12/is-goldman-really-a-bank-would-some-tax-increases-make-sense-right-away.html">notes at ataxingmatter</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>A recent study suggests that big banks in the TBTF category now enjoy a significant cost-of-funds spread compared to other banks.  That is, they can borrow money more cheaply, leading to greater ability to make profits, than can other banks, because of the implicit guarantee that the federal government will step in and save them because they are TBTF and pose a systemic risk.  That advantage may amount to as much as 48% of the TBTF banks&#8217; profits this year (or as &#8216;little&#8217; as 9%, on very conservative assumptions).   The government, by the way, gets nothing for this implicit guarantee&#8211;unlike a commercial guarantor, it is not being paid a regular premium for the service.</p></blockquote>
<p>So maybe investors believe that this advantage will go away.  (Or, as noted above, maybe investors have figured out that the Big Banks aren&#8217;t taking advantage of this opporunity, expecting that it will never go away.)</p>
<p>The one certainty is that, with all of their advantages (the refusal of the Administration <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/the-house-kills-mortgage-cram-down-amendment-2009-12">to support cramdowns for non-investment properties</a>, leading to perverted accounting that makes banks solvent and mortgageholders underwater at the same time on the same property; the continuing payment of interest on Reserves in a deflationary environment, which has created a perverse incentive for the TBTF Banks not to lend; charging their smaller competitors for the TBTF Banks&#8217;s failures <a href="http://www.journalstar.com/business/article_e6dcf326-dd17-5d43-8851-7e7bb90a0a59.html">by raising their FDIC contribution</a> and collecting <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/11/12/AR2009111210512_pf.html">three years of it upfront</a> after <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2009/03/11/now_needy_fdic_collected_little_in_premiums?mode=PF">not having saved for a rainy day</a>; having Administration economic policy run by Larry Summers, whose last foray into the financial markets was <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601109&#038;sid=aHQ2Xh55jI.Q&#038;pos=10">too embarassing even for him to explain</a> (h/t <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2009/12/18/those-harvard-swaps-even-more-of-a-fiasco-than-we-thought/">Felix</a>); Ben Bernanke having decided <a href="http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/archives/2009/12/with-inflation-low-and-unemployment-high-bernanke.php">that doing only half his job should be enough</a> (h/t <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2009/12/links-for-2009-12-18.html">Brad DeLong</a>); and the general delusion that the banks <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2009/12/we-are-live-at-the-week-i-did-not-run-for-office-to-be-helping-out-a-bunch-of-fat-cat-bankers.html">are necessary to <em>and helping with</em> a recovery</a>.  And that&#8217;s off the top of my head.</p>
<p>As The Epicurean Dealmaker observed last week vin <a href="http://epicureandealmaker.blogspot.com/2009/12/for-every-action.html">a post eeryone should read</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Chancellor [of the Exchequer Alistair] Darling could not have <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/6284fdba-e4c3-11de-96a2-00144feab49a.html">been clearer</a>:<br />
<blockquote>“I’m giving them a choice. They can use their profits to build up their capital base, but if they insist on paying substantial rewards, I’m determined to claw money back for the taxpayer,” he said.</p></blockquote>
<p>[H]e plans to do this by making banks choose between their employees and their shareholders&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>Economists have made this point repeatedly: the first priority of people who run a business should be their responsibility to their shareholders. (See Steve Randy Waldman&#8217;s post <a href="http://www.interfluidity.com/v2/364.html">yesterday for a clear explanation</a>.  And then see <a href="http://www.interfluidity.com/v2/384.html">the post he pulled from comments after that</a>, which saves me the trouble of hoisting from another person&#8217;s comments again for the real ramifications of TARP and the bailout.  Why do Megan McArdle and the Administration hate the troops?)</p>
<p>Paying large bonuses while the banks themselves remain near insolvency is bad for the shareholders.  Goldman Effing Sachs <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/deals/2009/12/10/goldmans-new-pay-plan-what-it-really-means/">realizes that</a>, even if they didn&#8217;t quite go far enough.</p>
<p>Why do I believe the state of the TBTF Banks ranges from near insolvency (C, MS) to on the edge of insolvency?  The market tells me so.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s why he gets the big bucks, folks.</p>
<p>Brad DeLong <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2009/12/ten-things-on-which-matt-taibbi-really-does-not-know-what-he-is-talking-about.html">attempts to attack Matt Taibbi&#8217;s facts</a>. Tao Jonesing replies in comments (DeLong starts; Jonesing in <strong>bold</strong>) :<br />
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>The financial reform bill that just passed the House is not nearly as strong a bill as the Treasury wanted. The reason is not that Obama and Geithner did not push for a stronger bill, but rather that the members of congress balked at a stronger bill. <strong>What financial did Obama and Geithner &#8220;push for,&#8221; exactly? And don&#8217;t point us to speeches. What did they push for, i.e., actually apply the pressure of the bully pulpit? Unless there&#8217;s some way to establish that they brought pressure to bear, I think this fact is an opinion.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>Citigroup did not receive a $306 billion bailout as the first major act of Obama&#8217;s presidency. First, where does the $306 billion number come from? The number I associate with Citigroup is $45 billion of TARP money. Certainly Citigroup would be bust and gone if not for government aid extended to it during George W. Bush&#8217;s presidency&#8211;aid that Obama endorsed&#8211;but it now looks as though Citigroup will pay everything back: that the government will profit from the aid it extended to Citigroup.<strong>Clearly, Taibbi is including the backstop in his number, which you realize in 8.</strong>*
</li>
<li>James P. Rubin is not James S. Rubin.
</li>
<li>The James Rubin whom Mike Froman brought in to staff the economic policy search was not Bob Rubin&#8217;s son. <strong>3-4. Taibbi admits this error.</strong>**
</li>
<li>The Obama economic policy inner circle&#8211;Tim Geithner, Gene Sperling, Larry Summers, Christie Romer, Peter Orszag&#8211;is not &#8220;a group of Wall Street bankers.&#8221; It is only 5% Wall Street banker&#8211;only 1/4 of Larry Summers can possibly count as a Wall Street banker.<strong>You misread what Taibbi said, which was that two people in Obama&#8217;s economic policy inner circle&#8211;Goolsbee and Kornbluh&#8211; were replaced with a group of Wall Stret bankers. Taibbi did not say that the all of the inner circle were Wall Street bankers. So, your fifth &#8220;fact&#8221; is actually a strawman. Perhaps you are focused on the subtitle? I can&#8217;t lay the subtitle at his feet because editorial staff make that decision.</strong> Note from Ken: Brad is incredibly generous in the case of Geithner, whose dinner plans while at the NY Fed were consistently at the homes of Wall Street bankers, and Summers, whose work since attempting to destroy Harvard&#8217;s endowment has been with Goldman, D. E. Shaw, and other paragons of Wall Street.  Summers may have worked for years without being on Wall Street, but it has been his primary source of income since his divorce.

<li>Mike Froman staffed the economic policy search. Mike Froman&#8211;a very smart and capable man&#8211;did not lead the economic policy search. He was not some corrupt Svengali who foisted advisors who would whisper evil in the innocent Obama&#8217;s ear. Obama led the economic policy search. <strong>Come now, Obama led the search? Really? What did that leadership entail, delegating the day-to-day responsibilities to somebody else? Froman, maybe? Since you seem to know, what did Froman actually do? And Taibbi never said or implied Froman was a corrupt evil Svengali. His point was that Froman was a Citi insider. Overall, this fact seems more like opinion.</strong>
</li>
<li>Austan Goolsbee&#8217;s absence from the transition staff was not notable. Austan Goolsbee does have a senior subcabinet appointment. And Austan Goolsbee is not a voice on the economic left&#8211;this is the man who told the Canadians not to take Barack Obama&#8217;s claims that he wanted to renegotiate NAFTA seriously. I don&#8217;t know the story of Karen Kornbluh.<strong>Your opinion of Goolsbee&#8217;s departure is an opinion, not a fact. I don&#8217;t know whose opinion is correct, although I&#8217;d bet on yours.</strong>
</li>
<li>Ah. Taibbi says: &#8220;the government also agrees to charge taxpayers for up to $277 billion in losses on troubled Citi assets.&#8221; First of all, $277 + $45 = $322, not $306. But a guarantee is not money at risk and money at risk is not money lost. As I said, it looks like the government is going to make money off of its support of Citi. (Albeit not off its support of AIG.) <strong>Clearly, Taibbi is including the backstop in his number, which you realize in 8.</strong>  Note from Ken: This is, by the way, bullshit, since it&#8217;s actually another example of the Rubinesque &#8220;contracts are only valid if they favor Wall Street firms.&#8221; What is being counted as &#8220;profits&#8221; are deeply-discounted equity options that have value because of the mass amount of subsidization and <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/12/charlie-stross-talks-about-liquidity.html">drug money</a> that has gone into the banking system without in the least being passed on to the consumer who is footing the bill.
</li>
<li>Tim Geithner was not hired as Treasury Secretary by Mike Froman. Tim Geithner was hired as Treasury Secretary by Barack Obama. <strong>You are correct that Obama hired Geithner. Nobody else could have, at least in the end. But who proposed Geithner? And what weight did Obama give the opinion of the people who proposed him? Did Obama just rubber stamp the recommendation after meeting Geithner? Who else was on the list? While there&#8217;s no doubt that Taibbi was making a lot of assumptions about Froman&#8217;s role and level of influence to jump to the obviously false conclusion that Froman hired Geithner, the fact that the conclusion was obviously false does not detract from ugly optics that Taibbi was attempting to magnify.</strong>
</li>
<li>According to CBO, the ARRA so far is not worth 640,000 extra jobs as of September 2009 but rather 1.1 million plus or minus 500,000&#8211;and that number will grow.<strong>You got your number from the CBO, but Taibbi says he got his number from the White House. There is a website managed by an executive branch agency that proclaims the 640,329 job number used by Taibbi.</strong></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>So that scores as 5 (or 6, since I&#8217;m inclined to count [2] in the Taibbi column) to 3 (3, 4, and arguably 7) against DeLong, with (8) called a draw (I would give it to Taibbi—the guarantee covers $306B in &#8220;assets&#8221; without cherry-picking, so potential buyers are seeing &#8220;support&#8221;-level offers for the entire $306B.  But there is a specific issue in using the $306B number, and Dr. DeLong correctly notes that the actual backstopping was greater than Taibbi reports. Whether this makes his interpretation here preferable is left as an exercise.)</p>
<p>Hint for the future: if you&#8217;re going to claim you&#8217;ve got fifty corrections, lead with your ten best.</p>
<p>*From the comments later, Our Own Rusty <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2009/12/ten-things-on-which-matt-taibbi-really-does-not-know-what-he-is-talking-about.html#comment-6a00e551f0800388340120a74cf57b970b">lays out the details</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Wall Street Journal 11/24/2008&#8230;Under the plan, Citigroup and the government have identified a pool of about $306 billion in troubled assets. Citigroup will absorb the first $29 billion in losses in that portfolio. After that, three government agencies &#8212; the Treasury Department, the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. &#8212; will take on any additional losses, though Citigroup could have to share a small portion of additional losses&#8230;In addition, the Treasury Department also will inject $20 billion of fresh capital into Citigroup. That comes on top of the $25 billion infusion.</p></blockquote>
<p>So it didn&#8217;t happen during Obama&#8217;s presidency, but it did happen post-election, and during the time that the Obama Administration was—by its own declarations—actively holding discussions with the parties.</p>
