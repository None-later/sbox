                                <p>by divorced one like Bush </p>
<p>I just listened to the <a href="http://crooksandliars.com/john-amato/howard-dean-wendell-potter-mike-lux-hea">conference call</a> with Gov. Dean and Wendall Potter. <br />Toward the very end of the call, the issue of medical loss ratio regulation came up. Seems like a reasonable thing to regulate especially if we are going to get Chicago School of Economics style health care reform implemented via the Shock Doctrine method. (Yes, I&#8217;ve finally started that book and I&#8217;ve got to say, what is happening here with health care reform reads all too familiar.) </p>
<p>Unfortunately, according to Gov. Dean, the CBO keeps scoring MLR regulation as a hit (as in mafia take down) to the budget. Seem from CBO&#8217;s perspective, if you regulate that the MLR can be no less than somewhere around 90%, such a number placed on profit ability makes all of the nation&#8217;s health care a government budget item. Thus, something like $2.5 trillion gets added to the budget numbers.</p>
<p>Funny thing this CBO view. Basically this means that I (We the People) can mandate that I buy insurance, that I can only buy it from the private market, that I can write the rules of the market that I buy into, but I can&#8217;t tell a corporation that is granted a privilege by me to spend it&#8217;s money on the product it has been granted a privilege to provide?  </p>
<p>Maybe the CBO figures because I decided to help some people in buying the mandated insurance, that by regulating the MLR, I&#8217;m making that money a greater expense on the budget because now 90% is going to health care services and not 70%? I really can&#8217;t figure this one. Is the CBO really saying that I (and you) the government, can not assure that I&#8217;m going to get my money&#8217;s worth? How come this issue does not come up when the government negotiates drug prices for the VA? </p>
<p>I really think, after watching our congress deal with health care, finance reform, military, that we have a bigger problem in this nation regarding economics and who is the boss here than we are willing to admit. Hint: It&#8217;s We the People who is the government.  It just seems that we have definitely, completely entered the realm of reality where &#8220;the market&#8221; is the purpose and not the means.  We have been turned to existing to serve &#8220;the market&#8221;.  We have put &#8220;the market&#8221; before all our needs and desires for us as people.  This is primitive idolizing behavior.  This is sick.</p>
<p>I have to go plow now.</p>

<p>Last evening the <a target="_blanks" href="http://cboblog.cbo.gov/?p=414">CBO Director Blog</a> announced the release of a score of the Boehner amendment: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/107xx/doc10705/hr3962amendmentBoehner.pdf">A Preliminary Analysis of a Substitute Amendment to H.R. 3962, the Affordable Health Care for America Act</a>. The results are not impressive: (as always click to enlarge)<br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SvLsmiuzmBI/AAAAAAAAAVM/lr71klquZjg/s1600-h/Boehner-dollars.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SvLsmiuzmBI/AAAAAAAAAVM/lr71klquZjg/s400/Boehner-dollars.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SvLsmBBmA_I/AAAAAAAAAVE/08X3_2AgUss/s1600-h/Boehner-coverage.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SvLsmBBmA_I/AAAAAAAAAVE/08X3_2AgUss/s400/Boehner-coverage.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />The amendment is scored at reducing the deficit by $68 billion over ten years. I can&#8217;t get the breakdown to add up (see page 4) but most of the savings is in the form of malpractice reform at $54 billion with further savings from some administrative changes relating to electronic transfers and adoption of the Eschoo Biologics Amendment all of which offsets a whopping $8 billion net actually spent to expand coverage. So what do we get from spending an average of just around $800 million a year? Essentially nothing, CBO projects that the percentage of the legal non-elderly population without health insurance will stay right at 83%.</p>
<p>I suggest the words &#8216;Epic fail&#8217; apply here.

<p>That is the subtitle of the new Center for Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP) analysis of the Aug 25th CBO and OMB Reports on projected budget deficits that is being injected into the health care debate as a reason for non-action. The CBPP analysis can be read here: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cbpp.org/cms/index.cfm?fa=view&#038;id=2901">New OMB and CBO Reports Show Continuing Current Policies Would Produce Large Deficits</a>. The authors&#8217; introduction:<br />
<blockquote>On August 25, both the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) released updated budget projections. Some observers, comparing OMB’s estimate of the deficit over the next ten years under the President’s proposed policies ($9.1 trillion) to CBO’s “baseline” estimate of the deficit under current law ($7.1 trillion), jumped to the conclusion that the President proposes to increase the deficit dramatically. In fact, the opposite is true. The President’s proposals would produce significantly lower deficits over the next ten years than continuing current policies.<br />This and other confusions have occurred because both the OMB and CBO reports are chock-full of numbers that are hard for even seasoned budget-watchers — and almost impossible for ordinary citizens — to interpret. This brief analysis explains what some of the numbers mean, how CBO’s official baseline must be adjusted to show what CBO’s estimate of deficits would be if it assumed current policies are continued, and why even that adjusted baseline should not be compared with OMB’s estimate of deficits under the President’s policies.</p></blockquote>
<p>The whole document is five pages long and should be read in full. But one lesson to take away is that you cannot directly compare CBO and OMB numbers, the former being bound by current law and the latter by current and proposed policy, two different things. To see the explanations from CBO and OMB try these links:<br />Orszag Press Release <a target="_blank" href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/blog/09/08/25/Mid-SessionReview/">Mid-Session Review</a><br />OMB Mid-Session Review <a target="_blank" href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/MSR/">Mid-Session Review Web-Page</a> with link to PDF of full report.<br />CBO Director&#8217;s Blog <a target="_blank" href="http://cboblog.cbo.gov/?p=347">Comparing CBO&#8217;s and OMB&#8217;s Projections of the Federal Budget Deficit</a> with link to PDF.<br />A table below the fold .</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/Spk0u71_6tI/AAAAAAAAASE/HtGJpw1RZ0o/s1600-h/CBPP_Table.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/Spk0u71_6tI/AAAAAAAAASE/HtGJpw1RZ0o/s400/CBPP_Table.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />Kevin Drum who pointed me to this has an annotated version of this table at MJ: http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2009/08/chart-day-0 where he totals the bottom line to get $10.556 trillion which is actually $574 billion below the figure CBPP comes up for an adjusted CBO number.</p>
<p>So before people jump to conclusions about how these new OMB and CBO numbers show Obama is breaking the bank be sure you know whether you are dealing with apples and oranges both with the initial and revised numbers.</p>

                                <p>hby Spencer</p>
<p>On Monday <a target="_blank" href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/">Greg Mankiw</a> quoted a CBO study on health care spending.</p>
<p>An Ounce of Prevention <br /><a href="http://cboblog.cbo.gov/?p=345">&#8230;is expensive, says CBO</a>:the evidence suggests that for most preventive services,expanded utilization leads to higher, not lower, medical spending overall.</p>
<p>That was the end of his quote from the study. He did not quote the part of the study that followed.</p>
<p>              Of course, just because a preventive service adds to total spending does not mean that it is a bad investment. Experts have concluded that a large fraction of preventive  care adds to spending but should be deemed “cost-effective,” meaning that it provides clinical benefits that justify those added costs.</p>
<p>And some people wonder why he quit allowing comments at his blog.</p>

                                <p>by Bruce Webb</p>
<p>On Sunday the CBO released a letter addressed to  Rep. Dave Camp, the Ranking Member on Ways and Means, which among other things measured the impact of HR3200 (the House Tri-Committee Health Care Affordability bill) and a public option on employer covered insurance. On net it turns out that they project more people on employer paid insurance than current law. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/104xx/doc10400/07-26-InfoOnTriCommProposal.pdf">Additional Information Regarding the Effects of Specifications in the America’s Affordable Health Choices Act Pertaining to Health Insurance Coverage</a></p>
<p>I provide the link for anyone who wants to explore some of those issues. But in this post I want to explore one provision that seems to have contributed to this outcome. Now there has been much wailing and gnashing of teeth among the Single Payer Now! contingent that HR3200 with or without a public option just is a huge windfall to the private insurance companies by providing them with a individual mandate that delivers millions of new customers without cost controls with the end result that insurance companies will just cherry pick their way to billions in profits. Now if they would have paused for a second to wonder why people like Kennedy and Waxman would just sell them out this way they might have been tempted to examine the bill language. But since there was no such pause I guess I will have to step in. So in re-examining the bill yesterday I came across this section whose import I had kind of missed before.<br />http://edlabor.house.gov/documents/111/pdf/publications/AAHCA-BillText-071409.pdf pg. 24-25<br />
<blockquote>SEC. 116. ENSURING VALUE AND LOWER PREMIUMS. </p>
<p>(a) IN GENERAL.—A qualified health benefits plan shall meet a medical loss ratio as defined by the Commissioner. For any plan year in which the qualified health benefits plan does not meet such medical loss ratio, QHBP offering entity shall provide in a manner specified by the Commissioner for rebates to enrollees of payment sufficient to meet such loss ratio. </p>
<p>(b) BUILDING ON INTERIM RULES.—In implementing subsection (a), the Commissioner shall build on the definition and methodology developed by the Secretary of Health and Human Services under the amendments made by section 161 for determining how to calculate the medical loss ratio. Such methodology shall be set at the highest level medical loss ratio possible that is designed to ensure adequate participation by QHBP offering entities, competition in the health insurance market in and out of the Health Insurance Exchange, and value for consumers so that their premiums are used for services.</p></blockquote>
<p> Why is this the Golden Bullet for those of us pushing the Public Option? And why contrawise is it reason for the insurance companies to go ballistic? Well a little discussion of that under the fold.</p>
<p>This provision, if implemented correctly, almost totally strips the ability of insurance companies to combine cherry picking and premium increases to continue the huge profits they garner today. What it does is to establish a minimum &#8216;medical loss ratio&#8217; which in simpler terms means a set ratio of care actually paid for to premiums collected. If by whatever means whether that be gaming the risk pool so an to only insure people unlikely to make claims or by denying coverage to insurees on a case by case basis your medical loss ratio drops below an established level the insurance company has to rebate the difference. In practice this prevents insurance companies from just arbitrarily jacking up rates and simultaneously takes the profit out of cherry-picking the risk pool. In a word this Sec automatically limits profits by establishing indirect price controls. Which is not going to make the insurance industry happy.</p>
<p>To see how this works. Under HR3200 Sec 111 bans limitations based on pre-existing conditions, Sec 114 mandates equal coverage for mental health and substance abuse treatment (p. 23), Sec 113 establishes strict limits on varying premiums across the risk pool (p.21), while section 112 guarantees enrollment and renewal, i.e. no more canceling people who actually dare to claim coverage for getting seriously ill. Now cynics can and do argue that insurance companies are extraordinarily skilled in working their way around these kind of restrictions and this is true enough. On the other hand the better they are at ducking the requirements of Secs 111-114 the more exposed they are to our Sec 116.</p>
<p>Lets say you have a company that against all law and regulation manages to have a plan that only in practice enrolls healthy adults aged 25-35 who rarely if ever use much health care. Under the current system this result yields ideal profits with collections but no payouts. Under Sec 116 your profits would be limited to the medical loss ratio. The answer for the insurance companies is to make up the difference with volume, the incentives are there to provide insurance as opposed to denying it.</p>
<p>Sec 116 would not eliminate all gaming as companies would still have an advantage if they shift their very high cost insurees over to the public option. But from the perspective of the government these are exactly the pool of people likely to end up on medicaid or qualifying for Medicare under Social Security disability anyway, for them the Public Option may just be a way station while they wait to qualify for DI.</p>
<p>What does this have to do with the CBO Report cited? Well Sec 116 prevents the Public Option from drawing too much of the overall pool away from the private plans not because it doesn&#8217;t have the ability to undercut them on cost, but because it forces them to compete for their share of the overall pool or risk seeing their gross profits squeezed.</p>
<p>I am still trying to work out in my head where the limits are here, and where the sweet spot for balancing the size of your coverage pool vs level of care the company ends up having to pay, but on a top down look it seems like insurance companies under something close to HR3200 end up making money by insuring people and not by denying coverage in whole or in part. It transforms the industry into a straight service industry from its current predatory model.</p>
<p>Sec 116: Golden Bullet for coverage, Smoking Gun for profits. It just depends which side of the divide you come down on.</p>

<p>Last week was kind of a busy time for CBO scoring with the result that some stories got over-reported and others not reported at all. So lets back up a little.</p>
<p>Tuesday July 14. CBO scores the coverage costs of HR3200, the House Tri-Committee Bill. The CBO Director&#8217;s Blog puts this announcement out <a target="_blank" href="http://cboblog.cbo.gov/?p=324">House Democrats’ Health Reform Proposal: Preliminary Analysis of Major Provisions Related to Insurance Coverage</a> Bottom line: increasing coverage to 97% of legal non-elderly residents will cost $1.048 trillion over ten years. Spending and revenue provisions of the bill not yet scored.</p>
<p>Thursday July 16. CBO director testifies to Senate and House Committees. The Director&#8217;s Blog describes this here: <a target="_blank" href="http://cboblog.cbo.gov/?p=328">The Long Term Budget Outlook</a>. And from the graphs included this seems to be mostly just another presentation of the LTBO released on June 25th and announced on the Director&#8217;s Blog under the same title as that on the Senate testimony <a target="_blank" href="http://cboblog.cbo.gov/?p=304">Long Term Budget Outlook</a>. The rest of this post will be exploring what Director Elmendorf actually said here as compared to how it was reported.</p>
<p>Friday July 17. CBO releases a new score for HR3200 which now includes the spending and revenue provisions not scored on Tuesday. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/104xx/doc10464/hr3200.pdf">PRELIMINARY ESTIMATE OF THE EFFECTS ON THE DEFICIT OF H.R. 3200, THE AMERICA’S HEALTH CHOICES ACT OF 2009 </a>. New bottom line? $239 billion over 10 years.</p>
<p>Saturday July 18th. The CBO Director&#8217;s Blog announces the release of the above report released the night before. The delay between the release Friday night and CBO and Ways and Means Committee public announcements creates a major kerfluffle on dKos with accusations of hoaxing. The dust settled a little after the Director&#8217;s Blog put out this: <a target="_blank" href="http://cboblog.cbo.gov/?p=332">Preliminary Analysis of the House Democrats’ Health Reform Proposal</a> confirming the numbers above.</p>
<p>Saturday July 18th to Monday July 20th, the Speaker and various Chairmen release Press Releases saying that the CBO confirmed that the House Bill in combination with an additional piece of legislation actually would produce a $6 billion surplus over those same ten years. This created a lot of confusion over the weekend, did CBO report $239 billion deficit? Or confirm a $6 billion surplus? Well both and for those who wish please revisit some of the past posts here at AB from last weekend.</p>
<p>But I want to focus on the reporting, in particular how sound bites from the Thursday testimony seem to have overwhelmed anything else. That coming below the fold.<br />(UPDATE: There is some weirdness in the HTML at this point that I can&#8217;t find. The page is supposed to break, and a link from CNN display. Neither happens. The title of the CNN article is &#8220;Health Reform Bill Won&#8217;t Reduce costs, and it is datelined on Friday. I give up. It works fine in Preview).</p>
<p><a href="http://money.cnn.com/2009/07/16/news/economy/health_care_reform/index.htm">Health reform bills won&#8217;t reduce costs</a> and summarized with this opening:<br />
<blockquote>The health reform bills released so far would increase government spending on health care without sufficiently reining in health care costs.<br />And at least initially they aren&#8217;t likely to significantly lower premiums for the majority of Americans with employer-sponsored health insurance.<br />That&#8217;s the sobering takeaway from testimony Thursday by Congressional Budget Office Director Douglas Elmendorf.<br />Elmendorf&#8217;s preliminary conclusions were based on a bill jointly released by three committees in the House this week and another bill passed by the Senate health committee on Wednesday.</p></blockquote>
<p>The WaPo reported on it in much the same tone: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/07/16/AR2009071602242.html">Lawmakers Warned About Health Costs: CBO Chief Says Democrats&#8217; Proposals Lack Necessary Controls on Spending</a><br />
<blockquote>Congress&#8217;s chief budget analyst delivered a devastating assessment yesterday of the health-care proposals drafted by congressional Democrats, fueling an insurrection among fiscal conservatives in the House and pushing negotiators in the Senate to redouble efforts to draw up a new plan that more effectively restrains federal spending.<br />Under questioning by members of the Senate Budget Committee, Douglas Elmendorf, director of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, said bills crafted by House leaders and the Senate health committee do not propose &#8220;the sort of fundamental changes&#8221; necessary to rein in the skyrocketing cost of government health programs, particularly Medicare. On the contrary, Elmendorf said, the measures would pile on an expensive new program to cover the uninsured.</p></blockquote>
<p>. (Before going on we could note that it really isn&#8217;t the business of news reporters to insert editorial comment like &#8220;devastating&#8221;, but then again that is characteristic of much of Lori Montgomery&#8217;s reporting.) At this point lets take a little stock. The Director&#8217;s Blog informs us that the topic of the testimony Thursday was on the Long Term Budget Outlook and not explicitly on the Health Care bills themselves. Moreover we know now, as Director Elmendorf knew then his staff was still working up the numbers on the full cost of the Tri-Committee Bill and wouldn&#8217;t release them for a full day plus after his testimony. Yet the WaPo story immediately drops any substance of the testimony and launches right into process questions and reactions by the political players with Elmendorf&#8217;s actually testimony reduced to out of context snippets.</p>
<p>The CNN reporting has a little more substance and focuses on testimony by Elmendorf that claims the current bills do not do enough to reduce the bend points in the CBO trendlines, trendlines themselves the product of the Long Term Budget Outlook. Well fair enough, on the other hand it is not at all clear that that end was the particular focus of these bills to start with, that is I don&#8217;t know where anyone promised that simply providing a public option would solve long-term health care cost trends, only that they would produce a bill that was paid for under CBO scoring criteria. Plus the reporting was spun in a way that confused &#8216;doesn&#8217;t subtract from&#8217; future deficits transforms to &#8216;adds trillion to&#8217; without acknowledgement of scoring from Friday and announcements from Saturday end up with a House Bill at least that is fully paid for.</p>
<p>I guess my real point is that you have to parse the claims you see closely. Not slowing the growth rate of health care is not the same as adding to the deficit. Nor are the goals of bringing coverage to the uninsured and controlling overall costs the same. To the extent we could achieve both goals great, and in the current political climate maybe we can&#8217;t get the first without some claims to be addressing the second. But that is a political calculation and not a policy consideration per se.Instead the question should be moving forward is as the President said in somewhat different words, how does it measure against the status quo, and our we measuring that as a percentage of national health care costs or as a percentage of the federal budget?</p>
<p>In my opinion Director Elmendorf blurred the line between two roles: one as the scorer of the impact of legislation over the next ten-years, in which case the House Bill does very well, and two as the evaluator of the long-term economic outlook. Credulous reporters and cynical politicians (or perhaps the other way around) seem to have seized on Elmendorf&#8217;s conclusion on the latter to implicitly judge the former.</p>
<p>So yes the Tri-Committee Bill adds a trillion dollars to federal health care spending to achieve coverage, on the other hand it has direct spending savings, proposed revenues, and a change to Pay-Go rules to make it officially budget neutral over the official scoring period. We should not let those concepts get fatally confused.</p>

<p>Press release from the House Ways and Means Committee dated Saturday July 18th. <a href="http://waysandmeans.house.gov/News.asp?FormMode=release&#038;ID=919">CBO Scores Confirms Deficit Neutrality of Health Reform Bill</a><br />
<blockquote>Washington, D.C. &#8212; The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) released estimates this evening confirming for the first time that H.R. 3200, America’s Affordable Health Choices Act, is deficit neutral over the 10-year budget window – and even produces a $6 billion surplus.  CBO estimated more than $550 billion in gross Medicare and Medicaid savings.  More importantly, the bill includes a comprehensive array of delivery reforms to set the stage for lowering the future growth in health care costs.   </p>
<p>Net Medicare and Medicaid savings of $465 billion, coupled with the $583 billion revenue package reported today by the House Committee on Ways and Means, fully finance the previously estimated $1.042 trillion cost of reform, which will provide affordable health care coverage for 97% of Americans.  </p>
<p>“This fulfills the strong commitment of the President and House leadership to enact health reform on a deficit-neutral basis,” said Chairman Henry A. Waxman, Chairman Charles B. Rangel, and Chairman George Miller.  “The reforms included in this legislation will help control health care costs and expand access to quality, affordable coverage to all Americans in a fiscally-responsible manner.” </p>
<p>The estimates also cover important reinvestments in Medicare and Medicaid, including phasing in the closing of the “donut” hole in the Medicare drug benefit.  The bill’s long-term reform of Medicare’s physician fee schedule to eliminate the potential 21 percent cut in fees, and put payments on a sustainable basis for the future, will cost about $245 billion.  Those costs, however, are not included in the net calculations above, as they will be absorbed under the upcoming statutory “pay go” legislation that is pending in the House.</p></blockquote>
<p> Good news as far as it goes, at least if you want to get as close to universal health care coverage as possible, and certainly you can expect progressives to run with it. But it raises some questions about the differences between &#8216;budget neutrality&#8217;, &#8216;surplus&#8217;, and savings. Rather than spoil the party I&#8217;ll move that discussion under the fold.</p>
<p>People who have been following this debate may be scratching their heads. On Tuesday the CBO scored HR3200 as adding $1.048 billion to the deficit over ten years. Late Friday that score was changed to adding  $239 billion over that same period, that is over the course of three days we somehow cut $809 billion off the cost. By Saturday night all of a sudden we now have a score of a $6 billion surplus, as close to dead even as makes no difference. So what happened? Did the bill change? Did CBO cave and change its methods? Well &#8216;No&#8217; and &#8216;No&#8217;. It turns out that the answers CBO returns depend, as they should, on the precise nature of the question.</p>
<p>The first thing of note is that while these numbers are perfectly accurate in that if you score the impact of HR3200 and some accompaning legislation related to Pay-Go to be voted on soon you will get the $6 billion surplus, but under the cautious methods used by CBO this is somewhat to put the cart before the horse. Because the latest message from the CBO Director&#8217;s Blog, released early Saturday morning still puts the matter as follows:<br />
<blockquote>Yesterday CBO released a preliminary analysis, conducted with the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT), of H.R. 3200, the America’s Affordable Health Choices Act of 2009, as introduced by several House committees on July 14. Earlier this week, CBO released a preliminary report on the health insurance coverage provisions of the bill; this latest report added analysis of the other provisions.</p>
<p>According to CBO’s and JCT’s assessment, enacting H.R. 3200 would result in a net increase in the federal budget deficit of $239 billion over the 2010-2019 period. That estimate reflects a projected 10-year cost of the bill’s insurance coverage provisions of $1,042 billion, partly offset by net spending changes that CBO estimates would save $219 billion over the same period, and by revenue provisions that JCT estimates would increase federal revenues by about $583 billion over those 10 years.</p>
<p>By the end of the 10-year period, in 2019, the coverage provisions would add $202 billion to the federal deficit, CBO and JCT estimate. That increase would be partially offset by net cost savings of $50 billion and additional revenues of $86 billion, resulting in a net increase in the deficit of an estimated $65 billion.</p></blockquote>
<p>First thing to note is that the last sentence is awkwardly phrased. That $65 billion is NOT the ten-year score but instead the score in Year 10, i.e. 2019. It basically represents the continuing cost of HR3200 going forward. But more importantly CBO is here sticking to the $239 billion figure (as bolded by me).</p>
<p>But whether you start from a $239 billion 10-year deficit or a $6 billion 10-year surplus this is quite a remarkeable achievement. Republicans who just days ago were crowing that the cost of providing near universal coverage was going to mean trillions added to the deficit are going to see that message stomped on. For example McConnell was reduced on Meet the Press to claiming this would cost &#8220;a quarter of a trillion dollars&#8221; perhaps hoping people are still scared by the label rather than the number. Because in the context of a $750 billion TARP package it is hard to scare someone with &#8216;$30 billion a year&#8217;.</p>
<p>Okay. So lets back off a little. Is it really fair to say that the changes to health care under HR3200 really save money compared to the status quo? Maybe yes, and maybe no, it all depends on where you are situated. The reality is that it is going to cost a bunch of medium term money to extend our current health care system in a way that covers 97% of the legal non-elderly population. On a national basis a good part of that will be offset by moving care delivery that is now non-compensated to being compensated. Just as a minor example we should be spending significantly less on collection agencies and medical bankruptcies. And billions of dollars formerly drawn from charity to run various hospitals can be directed other places. Plus we can save tens of billions of dollars if we just had every American on the right combination of blood pressure and cholesterol medication right from the git-go rather than after that heart attack or stroke. So there will be savings, and nationally there should long-term be net savings, and ultimately maybe huge net savings as we get per capita costs in line with other developed countries.</p>
<p>But the key point is that little to none of that is captured using CBO scoring methods. Savings to states, hospitals and individuals simply don&#8217;t register, nor do things like increased productivity from fewer lost work days. Now these kind of macro changes may well show up in CBO productions such as their Long Term Outlook but don&#8217;t register at the ground level of bill scoring.</p>
<p>In the cold light of day a big chunk of this is going to have to be paid for with a tax increase of around $500 billion dollars over ten years. And for the people tasked to pay it this isn&#8217;t going to save them anything over the status quo, not near term. Meaning that progressives shouldn&#8217;t get too far ahead of themselves crowing about a $6 billion net paper surplus.</p>
<p>I am warning about this because there is quite the excitement brewing in places like dKos among people who have confused the concepts of budget accounting and cash flow. Budgets and budget scoring are mysterious beasts and neither deficits or surpluses necessarily mean what they suggest once reported in the media.</p>
<p>In other words &#8220;I don&#8217;t think that $6 billion surplus means what you think it means&#8221;.</p>

<p>New scoring released Friday night shows the ten-year net increase to the deficit from the House Tri-Committee bill down to $239 billion with an actual five year surplus of $44 billion. I guess we will have to see whether the AP and the Republicans cling to that $1.5 trillion figure or not. And to be fair while the Press Release of the Committee claims CBO scored this actually as a 10 year surplus of $6 billion this was just accomplished by setting the $245 billion it will take to fix Medicare aside on the basis that that will be the result of separate legislation. This seems to be a dodge to me, I prefer to just stick with the numbers as they show in the table.</p>
<p>Either way ($239 billion 10 year deficit or $6 billion 10 year surplus) it gets harder for people to claim that covering 97% of Americans with health insurance is just too heavy a lift.</p>
<p>UPDATE: Hoo boy, this set off multiple hissy fits at dKos with competing diaries and claims of hoaxing to the point that both Pronin2&#8217;s and Dartagnan&#8217;s diaries got taken down. Bottom line?<br />1) The original &#8216;Press Release&#8217; does not seem to have actually been officially released. The latest official release on HR3200 seems to be this: http://waysandmeans.house.gov/News.asp?FormMode=release&#038;ID=918 It does not claim a surplus but does say the ultimate result will be paid for.<br />2) This morning the CBO Director&#8217;s Blog was updated with this: http://cboblog.cbo.gov/?p=332</p>
<p>As noted above I would not have run with the $6 billion surplus of that purported Press Release and would have just stuck with the official CBO score, but the number just didn&#8217;t come out of nowhere. I suspect that someone drafted up a Press Release that never actually went out because it was mis-leading. Anyway the $239 billion 10 year number stands.</p>

<p>Note 1: Read these tables with care! Page 1 compares currently non-elderly insured to projected non-elderly insured. This is how you end up with 97% of Americans with insurance in 2019 even as that drops to only 90% for non-elderly American citizens. <s>21</s> 34 million uninsured still seems too high to me but as footnote &#8216;d&#8217; indicates this includes people eligible for but not enrolled in Medicaid.<br />&#8220;</p>
