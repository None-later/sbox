				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>CATO was making much hay a few days ago about budget problems in California, New York, and New Jersey, which can be explained, respectively, by the Governor&#8217;s veto of an Assembly-passed budget a few months ago, the decline in tax revenues from financial services firms and continuing loss of upstate industry, and underfunded pension obligations whose origins date back to Christie&#8217;s cocaine-inspired budgets of the mid-1990s.</p>
<p>Strangely (via Dr. Black), they missed the crises in a few other states, most especially including the state governed by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-shutdown30-2009jun30,0,1912245.story">Republic hero Mitch Daniels</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Republican Gov. Mitch Daniels has warned residents that most of the state&#8217;s services &#8212; including its parks, the Bureau of Motor Vehicles and state-regulated casinos &#8212; would be shuttered unless a budget is passed today.</p></blockquote>
<p>Closing down the casinos?  Now that is extreme.</p>
<p>Mitch Daniels, doing for my old home state <a target="_blank" href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2009/06/mitch-daniels-did-not-do-his-job.html">what he did for the country</a>.</p>
