                            <div class="content">
                                <p>This article is roughly 24 hours late, but I do have additional points to the headline numbers. From <a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf">the BLS</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Nonfarm payroll employment edged down (-85,000) in December, and the unemployment rate was unchanged at 10.0 percent, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today. Employment fell in construction, manufacturing, and wholesale trade, while temporary help services and health care added jobs.</p></blockquote>
<p>The monthly shift in the <a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf">December nonfarm payroll</a> is practically a mirror image of the month that initiated the cyclical downturn, January 2008 when the payroll fell 72k (after revisions). Not because of the similar level values, but because of the mix: it is the goods-sector employment that is dragging the aggregate number, whereas the service-sector is just barely below zero. Actually, the private sector services payroll, 80% of the total service payroll, hired 17,000 more workers in net in December.</p>
<p>The volatility over the last two months has been driven primarily by the service sector. As illustrated in the chart below, the first-difference of the goods-sector payroll is approaching the coveted &#8220;0&#8221; threshold level, but at a much slower pace that is its service counterpart.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/S0ib6EKRYoI/AAAAAAAACw0/DOSbcGpFZZs/s1600-h/payroll_sector.PNG"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/S0ib6EKRYoI/AAAAAAAACw0/DOSbcGpFZZs/s320/payroll_sector.PNG" alt="" border="0"></a>The durable-goods jobs should turn up soon, at least the 64% of its payroll that is manufacturing. The <a href="http://www.ism.ws/ISMReport/MfgROB.cfm">ISM employment diffusion index</a> has been above 50 for three consecutive months. And with a 78% correlation between the 3-month lead of the index and annual manufacturing jobs growth, there is hope for January 2010. However, look for ISM diffusion index values around 53 (the average ISM value that correlates with >=0% manufacturing jobs growth) to forecast positive annual jobs growth. We are just barely there.<a name="more"></a></p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/S0icBAQRbYI/AAAAAAAACw8/wGZ9Vz_ftt8/s1600-h/ism_man_chart.png"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/S0icBAQRbYI/AAAAAAAACw8/wGZ9Vz_ftt8/s320/ism_man_chart.png" alt="" border="0"></a>It does seem that, as expected, the service sector (86% of December’s payroll) will pull the labor market back in positive territory in coming months.</p>
<p>From the Household Survey, the unemployment rate went unchanged in December at 10%. However, this is hardly good news; simple math says this rate will hover in the 9%-10% range throughout 2010 without a substantial pickup in the pace of employment growth. The reason is that the category &#8220;not in labor force&#8221; has grown by 3.4 million since May 2009.</p>
<p>If the number of unemployed persons falls each month over the next year by its 2005-2006 average, -48k, and just a quarter of the additional &#8220;not in labor force&#8221; persons since May (842k) re-enter at an average pace of 70k per month to find immediate employment, the unemployment rate will be 9.5% by December 2010. My point is: a serious growth momentum is needed to generate jobs, one that is not expected until initial unemployment claims drop significantly below their <a href="http://www.dol.gov/opa/media/press/eta/ui/current.htm">current 434k-level</a> (week ending Jan. 2).</p>
<p>Of note, average hourly earnings rose 3 cents per hour in December to $18.80/hour. Ostensibly, this is good news for the price stability picture. However, the y/y numbers are strikingly low, just 2.2% growth in earnings since December 2008. By this measure, wage pressures are extremely muted, which is another reason that the Fed may not be too quick to exit.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/S0idmyc_ljI/AAAAAAAACxE/Ogp7QMUbidw/s1600-h/earnings_chart.png"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/S0idmyc_ljI/AAAAAAAACxE/Ogp7QMUbidw/s320/earnings_chart.png" alt="" border="0"></a>The chart illustrates annual earnings growth and the unemployment rate. It wouldn&#8217;t be a stretch to expect wage growth to fall further, given the sharp upward trajectory of the unemployment rate.</p>
<p>There will likely be some volatility in coming months, specifically in April and May, when the Census hires temporary workers (6 weeks at $25/hour for 20 hours each week). <a href="http://www.newsneconomics.com/2009/12/2010-census-economic-impact-probably.html">Here is something I wrote</a> about the Census hires some time ago.</p>
<p>Of note, the BLS is beefing up its report. Effective February 5, 2010 (the January 2010 employment release), the establishment survey will include more detail on hours and earnings, including those broken down by gender.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>The <a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/ecopro.nr0.htm">BLS released</a> its employment and labor force projections for the period 2008-2018. The report highlights a more diverse and slower growing labor force stemming from a falling labor-force participation rate. Some headline findings <a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/ecopro.nr0.htm">of the report</a> are (bold font by yours truly):<br />
<blockquote>Total employment is projected to increase by 15.3 million, or 10.1 percent, during the 2008-18 period, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today. The projections show an aging and more racially and ethnically diverse labor force, and employment growth in service-providing industries.</p>
<p>&#8230;and&#8230;</p>
<p>Projected employment growth is concentrated in the service-providing sector, continuing a long-term shift from the goods-producing sector of the economy. From 2008 to 2018, service-providing industries are projected to add 14.6 million jobs, or 96 percent of the increase in total employment. The 2 industry sectors expected to have the largest employment growth are professional and business services (4.2 million) and health care and social assistance (4.0 million).</p>
<p>&#8230;and&#8230;</p>
<p>The largest decline among the detailed industries is expected to be in department stores, with a loss of 159,000 jobs, followed by manufacturers of semiconductors (-146,000) and motor vehicle parts (-101,000).</p>
<p>&#8230;and more&#8230;</p>
<p>Occupations that usually require a postsecondary degree or award are expected to account for nearly half of all new jobs from 2008 to 2018 and one-third of total job openings. Among the education and training categories, the fastest growth will occur in occupations requiring an associate degree.</p></blockquote>
<p>The last part is very interesting. According to <a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/ecopro.t09.htm">Table 9</a> of the employment projections, the growth rates of jobs requiring an associate degree or higher are generally in the double digits. In order to work in a top <a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/ecopro.t03.htm">10 wage and salary growth industries</a>, one must attain a higher degree.</p>
<p>That little fact explains the projected trend in labor-force participation among those aged 16-24 years: down.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/SzrJEmMpIsI/AAAAAAAACuU/03LTvTm9pIc/s1600-h/lfpr_age_chart.PNG"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/SzrJEmMpIsI/AAAAAAAACuU/03LTvTm9pIc/s400/lfpr_age_chart.PNG" alt="" border="0"></a><a name="more"></a>The chart illustrates the BLS&#8217; projection of the labor-force participation rate (LFPR) by age group (<a href="http://www.bls.gov/emp/ep_table_303.htm">Table 3.3</a>). The LFPR is the percentage of the population that is either working or seeking employment. There are two important points here.</p>
<p>First, the 16-24 LFPR is expected to fall another 4-points to 54.5% by 2018. This furthers a downward trend that has been underway for some time.</p>
<p>Second, the population is growing older, but that is not the full LFPR story: older workers are working longer. The LFPR for those aged 65 and older is expected to jump 33% to 22.4% by 2018. This trend has emerged more recently, where just one decade ago the LFPR went essentially unchanged from the ten years prior to that.</p>
<p>In spite of their working longer, and with the downward trend in the 16-24 LFPR, the growing baby-boomer population (individuals born 1946-1964) is expected to drag the aggregate LFPR a point-and-a-half to 64.5% by 2018 (the aggregate LFPR is an average of all age groups).</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/SzrMy5FFvQI/AAAAAAAACuc/1hool-df9Ig/s1600-h/participation_chart.png"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/SzrMy5FFvQI/AAAAAAAACuc/1hool-df9Ig/s320/participation_chart.png" alt="" border="0"></a>It should be noted that this is a long-term projection. Therefore, the 2007-2009 recession affects primarily the rates of growth toward the long-run values rather than the levels of employment and the labor force per se. According to the forecast, <a href="http://www.bls.gov/emp/ep_table_411.htm">the unemployment rate is 5.1%</a> by 2018, and the average annual rate of <a href="http://www.bls.gov/emp/ep_table_402.htm">GDP growth is 2.4% </a>(<a href="http://www.bls.gov/emp/ep_table_411.htm">slower productivity growth</a> is expected to drag GDP growth).

<p>The issue of a jobless recovery is getting a lot of attention recently.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve found the best way to look at the issue is to compare the change in real growth and productivity over the long run. There have been three periods of different productivity trends in modern US economic history.</p>
<p>Prior to about 1973 productivity growth averaged 2.8%. In the second or low productivity era, running from 1974 to 1995, productivity growth slowed to 1.5% before rebounding to 2.4% since 1995.</p>
<p>But real GDP growth also slowed over this period. As a consequence, the ratio of real GDP growth to productivity growth fell from 68% in the early strong productivity  to 50% in the weak productivity era before rebounding to over 80% in the most recent era.  Basically, real GDP growth equals productivity growth plus hours worked or employment growth.  A consequence of stronger productivity in an era of weaker GDP growth this suggests that each percentage point increase in real GDP growth generates a much weaker increase in hours worked or employment. Currently, a percentage point increase in real GDP growth now generates under a 0.2 percentage point increase in hours worked versus 0.3 in the pre-1974 era and 0.5 percentage points in the low productivity era.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SuhO_5PuwAI/AAAAAAAAA7k/8V_qlBkAdd4/s1600-h/Clipboard01.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SuhO_5PuwAI/AAAAAAAAA7k/8V_qlBkAdd4/s320/Clipboard01.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a></p>
<p>But to a certain extent comparing productivity and real GDP is comparing apples to oranges. To be accurate one should look at productivity versus output in the nonfarm sector.  GDP includes the farm sector of course, but also the nonprofit and government sectors where productivity is assumed to be zero.</p>
<p>If you look at what happened in the 1990s and early 2000s recoveries in the nonfarm business sector, you see that productivity growth significantly outpaced output growth in the early recovery phase of the cycle.  As a consequence hours worked or employment fell, generating the jobless recoveries.  It looks like the problem in these two cycles was much weaker growth rather than strong productivity.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SuddkSTaLJI/AAAAAAAAA7c/LadRuyeV83Q/s1600-h/Clipboard03.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SuddkSTaLJI/AAAAAAAAA7c/LadRuyeV83Q/s320/Clipboard03.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a><br />This shift to an environment of stronger productivity and weaker real growth generated an interesting development that has received little attention among economists or in the business press.</p>
<p>This development was a secular decline in labor&#8217;s share of the pie.  Prior to the 1982 recession there was a strong cyclical pattern of labor&#8217;s  but it was around a long term or secular  flat trend.  But since the early 1980s labor&#8217;s share of the pie has fallen sharply by about ten percentage points.  Note that the chart is of labor compensation divided by nominal output indexed to 1992 = 100. That is because the data for each series is reported as an index number at 1992=100 rather than in dollar terms. So the scale is set to 1992 =100 rather than in percentage points.  But it still shows that labor payments as a share of nonfarm business total ouput has declined sharply over the last 20 years and prior to the latest cycle we did not even see the normal late cycle uptick in labor&#8217;s share.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SuddUhLWUaI/AAAAAAAAA7M/iU2gefk317M/s1600-h/Clipboard01.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SuddUhLWUaI/AAAAAAAAA7M/iU2gefk317M/s320/Clipboard01.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a><br />If this chart gets a lot of attention it will be interesting to see how the libertarian and/or conservative analysts who keep coming up with all types of excuses to explain away the weakness in real labor compensation in recent years  explain this away.  If you really want to raise a stink you could look at this as a great example of the Marxist immiseration of labor that Marx believed was one of the internal contradictions of capitalism that would eventually lead to its self destruction.</p>

                                <p>It has long been a standard claim of economics—iirc, Robert Lucas was the first to say it aloud, though it may have been Gary Becker*—that a man who marries his housekeeper lowers GDP.</p>
<p>Apparently, Dubner and Levitt have taken this claim—along with their Rick James title**—to heart.  Echidne <a target="_blank" href="http://echidneofthesnakes.blogspot.com/2009_10_01_archive.html#8795124789977907021">has the details</a>.  A short sample:<br />
<blockquote>There is one labour market women have always dominated: prostitution. Its business model is built upon a simple premise. Since time immemorial and all over the world, men have wanted more sex than they could get for free. So what inevitably emerges is a supply of women who, for the right price, are willing to satisfy this demand. But what is the right price?&#8230;</p>
<p>It turns out that the typical street prostitute in Chicago works 13 hours a week, performing 10 sex acts during that period, and earns an hourly wage of approximately $27. So her weekly take-home pay is roughly $350. This includes an average of $20 that a prostitute steals from her customers and drugs accepted in lieu of cash.</p></blockquote>
<p>If I didn&#8217;t know that Levitt has done some research on prostitution, I would think he left this section solely to Dubner.  As it is, the skewed perspective (supply-side only) wouldn&#8217;t even pass muster in a basic neoclassical labor market model, and that the authors are trying to sell this as &#8220;economics&#8221; is, to extend a recent <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2009/10/yet-more-superfreakonomics-blogging-yes-i-know-i-know.html">note from Brad DeLong that &#8220;Levitt and Dubner today appear to no longer be thinking like economists&#8221;</a>, going to do Levitt much more harm than good.</p>
<p>Perhaps the difference between prostitutes and economists is that <a target="_blank" href="http://judithweingarten.blogspot.com/2007/03/calculus-of-prostitution-and-palmyra.html">only the former have to worry about their reputation</a>.</p>
<p>*Google indicates that the source is <a target="_blank" href="http://cje.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/bem011v1">Pigou (1932)</a>.  Does this explain the popularity of the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigou_Club">Pigou Club</a>?</p>
<p>**At this point, I&#8217;m betting they chose the title because of Abigail Breslin.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not sure whether (more likely wherE) this has been noted in the literature, but wage differentials not due to differences in workers&#8217; skill are enough to generate a business cycle.  A verbal &#8220;model&#8221; after the jump.</p>
<p>update: additional model with fixed capital added.</p>
<p>The key reference from which this is not quite obvious is <a href="http://www.jstor.org/pss/1831884">Kevin Murphy Andrei Shleifer and Robert Vishny (1989) &#8220;Industrialization and the Big Push&#8221; Journal of Political Economy vol 97 pp 1003-</a> which contains three models only one of which is The Big Push.  Another discusses wage differentials not due to worker characteristics.  Since Murphy is one of the authors, they are assumed to be compensating differentials not labor market rents but it doesn&#8217;t matter (except for welfare analysis).</p>
<p>OK the problem:  Assume that workers all have the same skill yet different wages are paid in different industries.  Can this imply multiple Pareto ranked steady states ? Can this imply that there are sunspot equilibria in which GNP changes just because people expect it to change ?   </p>
<p>To make the problem hard, assume that everyone is rational, that there is perfect competition (except for the wage differentials) and that all goods are non durable so consumption must equal production and the real interest rate just makes aggregate demand equal aggregate supply.</p>
<p>The last assumption is needed, because a model with two sectors can have a sunspot equilibrium due to the effect of (spontaneous just because people expect it) sectoral shifts on the real interest rate (Boldrin and Rusticchini in Econometrica).  I find models which rely on the effect of changes in the real interest rate on the rate of growth of aggregate consumption or labor supply to be unconvincing as there is almost exactly no sign of such effects in the data (that criticism applies to 3 published papers with my name on them).</p>
<p>OK the &#8220;model.&#8221;    Time is continuous.  People are free to borrow and save at interest rate r.  They have a rate of time preference rho</p>
<p>There is no capital.  There are two non-durable goods produced with labor alone.  There is nothing odd about good 1.  One unit of it is produced with 1 unit of labor. </p>
<p>1) C_1 = L_1</p>
<p>where C_1 is consumption of good 1 and L_1 is employment in the sector which produces good 1.</p>
<p>The price of good 1 is normalized to 1.  There is perfect competition so w_1 (the wage paid in sector 1) is equal to 1.</p>
<p>One unit of labor is needed to produce good 2</p>
<p>2) C_2 = L_2</p>
<p>total labor supply is fixed L_1+L_2 = L</p>
<p>However for some reason (it&#8217;s ok except for the welfare analysis if its a comepensating differential, that is it is more unpleasant to work in sector 2) </p>
<p>3) w_2= a > 1</p>
<p>there is perfect competition so the price of good 2 P_2 = a.</p>
<p>update 5: I am assuming that each individual worker moonlights working in both sectors and that they all spend the same fraction of their time in each sector.  In other words I am making assumptions so that all individuals have exactly the same income.  This is silly but makes things simpler.</p>
<p>Now a knife edge very special case for clarity.  The goods are perfect substitutes</p>
<p>U = aC_2+C_1</p>
<p>This means that any C_2+C_1 = L can be a steady state equilibrium.  </p>
<p>Welfare equals (L + (a-1)C_2)/rho = (aL-(a-1)C_1).</p>
<p>For this knife edge special case, there are a continuum of Pareto ranked steady state equilibria.  People are better off if they work in sector 2.  Any number can work in sector 2.</p>
<p>Well that&#8217;s an extreme example.  Now how about this one Good_1 is an inferior good.  This means that for fixed relative prices (and relative prices must be fixed) there is an interval of total consumption over which consumption of good 1 declines.   </p>
<p>update 3:  I think I was totally confused here <strike><br />update:  Assumption immediately below is a correction of the assumption in an earlier version.  Sad to say the new assumption is the assumption which I hate.</p>
<p>Consumption/permanent income decreases as the interest rate increases </strike></p>
<p>permanent income is the expected discounted value of the flow of income.  Call it pY.</p>
<p>Oh no now I need a graph.</p>
<p>Figure 1</p>
<p><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v296/rjw88/?action=view&#038;current=YC_1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v296/rjw88/YC_1.jpg" border="0" alt="figure 1"></a></p>
<p>Consider possible steady states.  Consider income and consumption of good 1.  The line shows income as a function of consumption (and production) of good 1 . The curve shows consumption of good 1 as a function of pY.</p>
<p>Note there are two steady states and one is Pareto better than the other (C_2 is higher).</p>
<p>OK now figure 2 shows Y as a function of pY.  </p>
<p><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v296/rjw88/?action=view&#038;current=YpY.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v296/rjw88/YpY.jpg" border="0" alt="figure 2"></a></p>
<p>Define total consumption as C = C_1+aC_2</p>
<p>So there are two steady states one with high output Yg and the other with low output which I will call Yb.  </p>
<p>What&#8217;s more the economy can jump from one to the other.  let&#8217;s say it switches according to a poisson alarm clock with the sunspot causing a switch arriving at rate p.  Or hell let&#8217;s say time is discrete and they switch each period with probability p.</p>
<p>In each steady state consumption equals to income so that the identity C=Y and the equations which give C_1 and C_2 as a function of y (for P_2 fixed and equal to a from the supply side) and Y as a function of C_1 and C_2 both hold.</p>
<p>Furthermore the economy can jump stochastically from one to the other.  How ?  Well lets say we are in the good state.  The national income identity means C=Y.  However individuals are free to borrow and save at interest rate r.  They decide consumption given permanent income.  This means that r can&#8217;t equal rho.  They know that their income might fall so if y=Yg all agents will try to save if r=rho.  They can&#8217;t.  we must have C=Y because there is no way to invest.  </p>
<p>So r must be lower than rho.  This means that they are satisfied if the expected marginal utility of consumption increases.  It does it jumps up to the higher marginal utility of consumption in the bad steady state with rate p.  For any p r can be calculated so that people neither want to borrow nor save if they are currently at the good steady state.</p>
<p>Similarly at the bad steady state.  Here r must be greater than rho since income and consumption might jump up.  </p>
<p>update 4:  Now I add capital to the model.  The model above is very strange as there is no fixed capital or trade so consumption must always be equal to production.  Also one of the stylized facts about wages, and, in particular, wages which are surprisingly high given worker characteristics is that they are high in industries with a high capital labor ratio.  In the model above, both industries have a capital labor ratio of 0.</p>
<p>So now there is a third good K in addition to C_1 and C_2.  At any given time total capital equals K = K_1+K_2 where K_i is capital used in sector i. Y_1 and Y_2 are production of each type of good no longer equal to C_1 and C_2.  Y = Y_1+Y_2 and C=C_1+C_2</p>
<p>The assumption about wages becomes</p>
<p>5) w_2 = (w_1)a</p>
<p>since now wages depend on the capital labor ratio.</p>
<p>I will assume that the share of capital is constant and the same in each industry.  This means that the relative prices of the goods will be constant.  For further simplicity I am going to make assumptions so that constant is 1 so P_2 = P_1.  This is all for tractability and is not realistic.  In fact not only is K/L high in high wage industries but so is the share of capital (capital income)/wL which will be just rK/wL here.  But I assume that rK/wL = alpha in both sectors cause it makes things easier.  I equations I assume</p>
<p>5) y_1 = A(L_1)^(1-alpha)(K_1)^alpha</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>6) Y_2 = A(aL_2)^(1-alpha)(K_2)^alpha</p>
<p>So both sectors have similar Cobb-Douglas production functions.  For the same amount spent on labor and capital (which means fewer physical hours of work in industry 2 since each gets a higher wage) the sectors have the same output so the two goods are sold for the same price which I set to 1.   This makes everything relatively simple and means that the crude definitions like Y = Y_1+Y_2 make sense.</p>
<p>I want to keep things simple so I will assume that you can create 2 units of K from 1 unit of good 1 and one unit of good 2.  This is an absolutely rigid no substitution allowed leontief type function.  capital depreciates at rate delta.     so </p>
<p>5) dK/dt = -deltaK + 2min(Y_1-C_1,Y_2-C_2)</p>
<p>This means that </p>
<p>6) dK/dt = -deltaK + (Y-C)</p>
<p>and the price of one unit of capital is 1, that is equal to the price of one unit of consumption good 1 which is equal to the price of one unit of consumption good 2.</p>
<p>I assume that delta is high enough that no one ever wants to convert K back to consumption goods (or that they can do that which is silly but standard).  Also I assume either that delta is high enough that no one ever wants to take capital from sector 1 and add it to sector 2 or that this is possible.  Again silly but standard.</p>
<p>Note that a shift of labor from sector 1 to sector 2 will increase demand for capital and will give a higher marginal product of capital r for the same total amount of capital K.</p>
<p>Finally I will make an assumption about tastes.  For p_1/p_2 = 1 (which it must be given the supply side) C_1 and C_2 as a function of total consumption are given by figure 3.  As C goes up from zero the ratio C_2/C_1 is constant for a while, then C_2/C_1 increases then it is constant with a higher C_2/C_1.  </p>
<p>In the regions where C_2/C_1 doesn&#8217;t change with total consumption C, this model behaves just like a standard Solow model.  However, when C_2/C_1 is higher it is as if there has been labor augmenting technological progress since labor is more productive in sector 2. </p>
<p>Recall I am assuming all workers divide their time and work in both sectors and have equal identical income.  I also they are the saver/ investors and all have equal wealth so everyone always has the same income. Silly but standard in macro.</p>
<p>This means that, for the right a and assumptions about tastes, there can be two steady states again.  In each steady state the real interest rate is equal to the rate of time preference r=rho, but in the good steady state C_2/C_1 is higher than in the bad steady state so the K/L needed to make r=rho is higher and output is higher and consumption is higher so, given tastes the ratio C_2/C_1 is higher.<br />Define the two steady state levels of capital as Kg and Kb with Kg>Kb and may use the subscripts the same way for other variables.</p>
<p>It is no longer possible to jump from one steady state to another.  K is a state variable and changes slowly.  C can jump.</p>
<p>There is a sunspot equilibrium where the economy spends much of it&#8217;s time near one of the steady states.</p>
<p>If K is just above the good steady state K (Kg) then r<rho so the expected change in consumption must be negative. this happens equilibrium way. it is constant unless poisson alarm clock rings. if rings then jumps down that c region with a low c_2 means value of marginal utility rises as required r>rho.</p>
<p>If it jumps the economy finds itself on the path of dC/dt and dK/dt which leads to a point with K just below bad steady state K.  Once it gets real close to this point, the sunspot begins giving a jump up signal which arrives at rate p again.  This makes consumption remain constant if the jump up signal doesn&#8217;t arrive at a point where r>rho so K below Kb.</p>
<p>If the jump up signal arrives then C jumps up to the region with high constant C_2/C_1 to exactly the point where the dC/dt and dK/dt equations lead it to the original point with K a little bit greater than Kb.</p>
<p>Also now the economy can have much more complicated dynamics.  It is possible to make an equilibrium in which it can jump at any time and not just when close to a steady state.</p>
<p>update 3: I think everything below is totally confused</p>
<p><strike></p>
<p>Note again two steady states.  Also note that for the Pareto better steady state (with higher Y) dY/dpY >1.  This means that this steady state is a stable steady state with Y = Yg (for good).  if Y starts slightly above steady Yg then it will converge to steady Yg.  This means that there is a sunspot equilibrium in which Y bounces around Yg just because people expect it too (rational animal spirits).</p>
<p>update 2:  The assumption which I hate that, given permanent income, consumption decreases in the interest rate is not needed for there to be a stable steady state and sunspot equilibria.  It is just needed so that the good steady state is stable.  If, in contrast, consumption increases in the interest rate for given permanent income, then the bad steady state is stable.  There is a very general result that when you pass from zero steady states to two (as in the figure) then one of the steady states is stable and one is unstable.</p>
<p>I will attempt to discuss the dynamics of Y near a steady state.  I will use linear approximations (I have to do this to have any hope of writing out the explanation with plain ascii.  That approximation is not necessary for the result.</p>
<p>There are two steady states Yg defined above and the one with lower Y which I now name Yb.  </p>
<p>I will try to find the time derivative of Y, dY/dt for Y near a steady state.  If d(dY/dt)/dY is negative then when Y is above the steady state Y falls down to the steady state. This means that the steady state is a sink, it is stable.  It means that there are sunspot equilibria where the economy bounces around the steady state.</p>
<p>I will make an assumption about the utility function.  First define total consumption</p>
<p>C = C_1+aC_2</p>
<p>note that C=Y.</p>
<p>Given the relative price P_2 = 2P_1, C_1 and C_2 are functions of C.  </p>
<p>I assume that<br />the marginal utility of consumption of good 1 is equal to </p>
<p>4) U_1(C_1,C_2) = C^(-sigma) </p>
<p>This must be equal to (1/a) times the marginal utility of consumption of good 2.</p>
<p>Now consider the real interest rate r.  Even though there is no saving and investment, there is a market clearing r such that no one wants to save or borrow.<br />Equation 4 implies that </p>
<p>5) (dC/dt)/C = (r-rho)/sigma  = (dY/dt)/Y</p>
<p>(recall the national accounts identity is just C=Y).</p>
<p>now consider constant r (just for now)</p>
<p>permanent income at t (pY_t) is the integral as s goes from zero to infinity of exp(-rs)Y_(t+s)ds</p>
<p>Given 5 that equals the integral as s goes from zero to infinity of</p>
<p>exp(s(r(1-sigma)-rho)/sigma)Y_t so  </p>
<p>6) pY_t = Y_t(-sigma/(r(1-sigma)-rho))= Y_t(sigma/(rho+(sigma-1)r)</p>
<p>if r = rho then pY_t = Y_t(sigma/sigma) = Y_t</p>
<p>if sigma is greater than 1, then pY_t/Y_t decreases in r.  If sigma is less than one then pY_t/Y_t increases in r.  Let&#8217;s assume that sigma>1 (the assumption I like).  This means that Yb is a stable steady state.</p>
<p>OK so that wasn&#8217;t very hard, but the problem is that r_t changes as Y_t changes. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m working on it (update 3.1 not any more.  I realize I was assuming that there was some way to save.  <br /></strike></p>
