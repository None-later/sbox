<p><strong>Why the Rich Love High Unemployment</strong><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://truthout.org/why-rich-love-high-unemployment/1305061465">via Truthout</a></p>
<p>Christina Romer, former member of President Obama&#8217;s Council of Economic Advisors, accuses the administration of &#8220;shamefully ignoring&#8221; the unemployed. Paul Krugman echoes her concerns, observing that Washington has lost interest in &#8220;the forgotten millions.&#8221; America&#8217;s unemployed have been ignored and forgotten, but they are far from superfluous. Over the last two years, out-of-work Americans have played a critical role in helping the richest one percent recover trillions in financial wealth.</p>
<p>Obama&#8217;s advisers often congratulate themselves for avoiding another Great Depression &#8211; an assertion not amenable to serious analysis or debate. A better way to evaluate their claims is to compare the US economy to other rich countries over the last few years. </p>
<p> <a name="more"></a>
<p>On the basis of sustaining economic growth, the United States is doing better than nearly all advanced economies. From the first quarter of 2008 to the end of 2010, US gross domestic product (GDP) growth<a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2011/04/04/recovery-in-the-u-s-beats-other-advanced-economies/">outperformed every G-7 country except Canada</a>.</p>
<p>But when it comes to jobs, US policymakers fall short of their rosy self-evaluations. Despite the second-highest economic growth, Paul Wiseman of the Associated Press (AP)<a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/42349181/ns/business-world_business/">reports:</a>&#8220;the U.S. job market remains the group&#8217;s weakest. U.S. employment bottomed and started growing again a year ago, but there are still 5.4 percent fewer American jobs than in December 2007. That&#8217;s a much sharper drop than in any other G-7 country.&#8221; According to an important study by Andrew Sum and Joseph McLaughlin, the US boasted one of the lowest unemployment rates in the rich world before the housing crash &#8211; now, it&#8217;s the highest.<a href="http://truthout.org/why-rich-love-high-unemployment/#1">[1] </a></p>
<p>The gap between economic growth and job creation reflects three separate but mutually reinforcing factors: US corporate governance, Obama&#8217;s economic policies and the deregulation of US labor markets.</p>
<p>Old economic models assume that companies merely react to external changes in demand &#8211; lacking independent agency or power. While executives must adapt to falling demand, they retain a fair amount of discretion in how they will respond and who will bear the brunt of the pain. Corporate culture and organization vary from country to country.</p>
<p>In the boardrooms of corporate America, profits aren&#8217;t everything &#8211; they are the only thing. A JPMorgan research<a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/article/profit-recovery-driven-plunging-labor-costs-explains-why-pe-multiples-will-remain-depressed">report</a>concludes that the current corporate profit recovery is more dependent on falling unit-labor costs than during any previous expansion. At some level, corporate executives are aware that they are lowering workers&#8217; living standards, but their decisions are neither coordinated nor intentionally harmful. Call it the &#8220;paradox of profitability.&#8221; Executives are acting in their own and their shareholders&#8217; best interest: maximizing profit margins in the face of weak demand by extensive layoffs and pay cuts. But what has been good for every company&#8217;s income statement has been a disaster for working families and their communities.</p>
<p>Obama&#8217;s lopsided recovery also reflects lopsided government intervention. Apart from all the talk about jobs, the Obama administration never supported a concrete employment plan. The stimulus provided relief, but it was too small and did not focus on job creation.</p>
<p>The administration&#8217;s problem is not a question of economics, but a matter of values and priorities.  In the first Great Depression, President Roosevelt created an alphabet soup of institutions &#8211; the Works Progress Administration (WPA), the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) and the  Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) &#8211; to directly relieve the unemployment problem, a crisis the private sector was unable and unwilling to solve. In the current crisis, banks were handed bottomless bowls of alphabet soup &#8211; the Troubled  Asset Relief Program (TARP), the Public-Private Investment Program (PPIP) and the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) &#8211; while politicians dithered over extending inadequate unemployment benefits.  </p>
<p>The unemployment crisis has its origins in the housing crash, but the prior deregulation of the labor market made the fallout more severe. Like other changes to economic policy in recent decades, the deregulation of the labor market tilts the balance of power in favor of business and against workers. Unlike financial system reform, the deregulation of the labor market is not on President Obama&#8217;s agenda and has escaped much commentary.</p>
<p>Labor-market deregulation boils down to three things: weak unions, weak worker protection laws and weak overall employment. In addition to protecting wages and benefits, unions also protect jobs. Union contracts prevent management from indiscriminately firing workers and shifting the burden onto remaining employees. After decades of imposed decline, the United States currently has the<a href="http://rankingamerica.wordpress.com/2009/05/01/the-us-ranks-27th-in-unions/">fourth-lowest private sector union membership</a>in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).</p>
<p>America&#8217;s low rate of union membership partly explains why unemployment rose so fast and, &#8211; thanks to hectic productivity growth &#8211; hiring has been so slow.</p>
<p>Proponents of labor-market flexibility argue that it&#8217;s easier for the private sector to create jobs when the transactional costs associated with hiring and firing are reduced. Perhaps fortunately, legal protections for American workers cannot get any lower: US labor laws make it the easiest place in the word to fire or replace employees,<a href="http://www.oecd.org/document/11/0,3746,en_2649_33927_42695243_1_1_1_1,00.html">according to the OECD.</a></p>
<p>Another consequence of labor-market flexibility has been the shift from full-time jobs to temporary positions. In 2010,<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/20/business/economy/20temp.html">26 percent of all news jobs were temporary</a>&#8211; compared with less than 11 percent in the early 1990&#8217;s recovery and just 7.1 percent in the early 2000&#8217;s.</p>

<p>The American model of high productivity and low pay has friends in high places. Former Obama adviser and General Motors (GM) car czar<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-right-path-on-jobs-jobs-jobs/2011/01/30/ABqPCME_story.html">Steven Rattner argues</a>that America&#8217;s unemployment crisis is a sign of strength: </p>
<blockquote><p>Perversely, the nagging high jobless rate reflects two of the most promising attributes of the American economy: its flexibility and its productivity. Eliminating jobs &#8211; with all the wrenching human costs &#8211; raises productivity and, thereby, competitiveness.</p>
<p>Unusually, US productivity grew right through the recession; normally, companies can&#8217;t reduce costs fast enough to keep productivity from falling.</p>
<p>That kind of efficiency is perhaps our most precious economic asset. However tempting it may be, we need to resist tinkering with the labor market. Policy proposals aimed too directly at raising employment may well collaterally end up dragging on productivity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rattner comes dangerously close to articulating a full-unemployment policy. He suggests unemployed workers don&#8217;t merit the same massive government intervention that served GM and the banks so well. When Wall Street was on the ropes, both administrations sensibly argued, &#8220;doing nothing is not an option.&#8221; For the long-term unemployed, doing nothing appears to be Washington&#8217;s preferred policy.</p>
<p>The unemployment crisis has been a godsend for America&#8217;s superrich, who own the vast majority of financial assets &#8211; stocks, bonds, currency and commodities. </p>
<p>Persistent unemployment and weak unions have changed the American workforce into a buyers&#8217; market &#8211; job seekers and workers are now &#8220;price takers&#8221; rather than &#8220;price makers.&#8221; Obama&#8217;s recovery shares with Reagan&#8217;s early years the distinction of being the only two post-war expansions where wage concessions have been the rule rather than the exception. The year 2009 marked the slowest wage growth on record, followed by the second slowest in 2010.<a href="http://truthout.org/why-rich-love-high-unemployment/#2">[2]</a></p>
<p>America&#8217;s labor market depression propels asset price appreciation. In the last two years, US corporate profits and share prices rose at the fastest pace in history &#8211; and the fastest in the G-7.    Considering the source of profits, the soaring stock market appears less a beacon of prosperity than a reliable proxy for America&#8217;s new misery index. Mark Whitehouse of The Wall Street Journal<a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2011/03/05/number-of-the-week-workers-not-benefiting-from-productivity-gains/">describes</a>Obama&#8217;s hamster wheel recovery:</p>
<blockquote><p>From mid-2009 through the end of 2010, output per hour at U.S. nonfarm businesses rose 5.2% as companies found ways to squeeze more from their existing workers. But the lion&#8217;s share of that gain went to shareholders in the form of record profits, rather than to workers in the form of raises. Hourly wages, adjusted for inflation, rose only 0.3%, according to the Labor Department. In other words, companies shared only 6% of productivity gains with their workers. That compares to 58% since records began in 1947.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Workers&#8217; wages and salaries represent roughly two-thirds of production costs and drive inflation. High inflation is a bondholders&#8217; worst enemy because bonds are fixed-income securities. For example, if a bond yields a fixed five percent and inflation is running at four percent, the bond&#8217;s real return is reduced to one percent. High unemployment constrains labor costs and, thus, also functions as an anchor on inflation and inflation expectations &#8211; protecting bondholders&#8217; real return and principal. Thanks to the absence of real wage growth and inflation over the last two years, bond funds have attracted record inflows and<a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704530204576237182248727802.html">investors have profited immensely. </a></p>
<p>The Federal Reserve has played the leading role in sustaining the recovery, but monetary policies work indirectly and disproportionately favor the wealthy. Low interest rates have helped banks recapitalize, allowed businesses and households to refinance debt and provided Wall Street with a tsunami of liquidity &#8211; but its impact on employment and wage growth has been negligible. </p>
<p>CNBC&#8217;s Jim Cramer<a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/42308019/When_Bad_News_Is_Good_News">provides insight</a>into the counterintuitive link between a rotten economy and soaring asset prices: &#8220;We are and have been in the longest &#8216;bad news is good news&#8217; moment that I have ever come across in my 31 years of trading. That means the bad news keeps producing the low interest rates that make stocks, particularly stocks with decent dividend protection, more attractive than their fixed income alternatives.&#8221; In other words, the longer Ben Bernanke&#8217;s policies fail to lower unemployment, the longer Wall Street enjoys a free ride. </p>
<p>Out-of-work Americans deserve more than unemployment checks &#8211; they deserve dividends. The rich would never have recovered without them. </p>

                                <p>For all of our economic problems here in the US, a simple measure of &#8216;misery&#8217; illustrates that US households are less miserable in March 2011 than those in the Euro area.</p>
<p>The chart below illustrates the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misery_index_%28economics%29">simple &#8216;misery index&#8217;</a>, which is the unemployment rate plus inflation. The blue line is a 45-degree line; those countries below it have seen their misery index fall on a y/y basis. Not one Euro area economy misery index fell since this time last year &#8211; French and German misery indices are unchanged despite improving employment. In contrast, the US misery index improved over the year with labor market conditions.</p>

Consumers and firms alike are feeling this in Europe. </p>
<p>In the US, fiscal policy has been accommodative enough to allow for private sector deleveraging while keeping the economy on an upward trajectory. However, food and energy price inflation in April stabilized the misery index compared to last year (not shown) &#8211; i.e., it&#8217;s no longer improving. Unless the labor market shows marked improvement in coming months, US misery will turn &#8220;Euro&#8221; as inflation batters consumers amid elevated unemployment.

                                <p>Mark Thoma is a truly stand-up guy. We need more like him screaming for the unemployed and underemployed. I&#8217;ll comment just a bit more after Mark&#8217;s commentary.</p>
<p>Mark Thoma on <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2011/02/the-slow-recovery-of-unemployment.html/">The Slow Recovery of Unemployment</a>:<br />
<blockquote>I don&#8217;t like to make economic forecasts. Though I do it on occasion, I generally leave that to <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/timduy/">Tim Duy</a> &#8212; he&#8217;s much more of a data grubber than I am so he&#8217;s better at it anyway. I do try to comment on what data says when it&#8217;s released, mostly at <a href="http://moneywatch.bnet.com/economic-news/blog/maximum-utility/">MoneyWatch</a>, but I don&#8217;t generally consider those to be formal forecasts of where the economy is headed.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a good reason why I try to avoid forecasts. In the past, whenever I&#8217;ve tried to predict the path the economy would take, I&#8217;ve found myself reading subsequent data releases in a way that supports the forecast. I think that once you make a forecast, it affects your objectivity, and I think that applies generally, not just to me.</p>
<p>Perhaps that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m feeling more and more alone in talking about the current state of the economy. Though the worries began long before this, in June of 2008 I did a MarketPlace segment where I predicted that the recovery of unemployment would lag output, and I said that policy should begin addressing the problem immediately due to the long lags between the time when policy begins is first considered and the time it actually has an impact on the economy. Ever since, I&#8217;ve found myself watching to see if that forecast was correct (which is another reason why I don&#8217;t like to make forecasts &#8212; you hope you are correct, but being correct in this case means people will struggle to find jobs, so it brings on an internal contradiction &#8212; how can you hope people will struggle?).</p>
<p>As I said above, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m alone in reading data in a way that supports previous forecasts, and others are much more bullish about the latest data releases than I have been. Part of my point has been that the data can be read another way. When people say, for example, that there&#8217;s nothing in the latest employment report to change the relatively optimistic forecasts they&#8217;ve made recently, I try to say that there&#8217;s nothing in the data to reject the alternative forecast either, i.e. that we are still headed for a very slow recovery of employment. Whatever your null hypothesis or prior beliefs were, the latest data did little to change that outlook.</p>
<p>My reason for noting that the data can be read another way goes beyond trying to show that I was right and others were wrong about how long it would take for employment to recover. I am very worried that we are, for all intents and purposes, about to abandon the millions who are still unemployed. Once we conclude that a robust recovery is underway, we will turn our attention to other things. All of the social services that we need to provide for the unemployed, simple and important things like making it possible for their kids to get dental care to name just one example, will be ignored. We devote little if any effort to job creation. We will simply turn our backs and move on.</p>
<p>I fully understand the desire to have a perfect landing, to get policy just right. But just right when the costs of unemployment are so much higher than the costs of inflation means that we should bias policy toward the unemployment problem. If we are going to make a mistake, it should be too much unemployment, and the inflation that comes with it, rather than too little. However, with the inflation hawks writing almost daily in the WSJ and elsewhere that we need to raise interest rates immediately to avoid inflation, and with all of the pressure to address the budget deficit, if anything the bias in policy seems to be in the other direction. Thus, while I acknowledge the fact that I am probably reading the data in a way that is favorable to previous statements, there was a good reason to worry back in 2008 that this would be a problem, and I believe there&#8217;s still good reason for worrying about it today. If I have read the data more pessimistically than others, the reason for it is simple &#8212; to push against the chance that we will forget about all the households that continue to struggle. If Ben Bernanke&#8217;s right, even with current policy we are looking at years until employment gets back to normal and we must do all that we can to help people find jobs or, failing that, provide the social services they need to get by until the employment picture improves.</p>
<p>Until I am sure that the economy is on firmer footing than it&#8217;s on now, and that employment prospects have improved substantially, I will continue to be the one who pushes back against optimistic reading of the data. And I will make no apologies for it beyond what I&#8217;ve said here.</p></blockquote>
<p>(More comments after the jump)<a name="more"></a><br />RW: Just today I was reading an Economist article from last week&#8217;s publication, <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/18010603">Et in Arcadia ego</a> (even in Arcadia I exist), about the homeless population that is building in the hardest hit parts of the economy (generally related to the manufacturing and housing decline). Tent cities, surging homeless rate, and poverty are becoming more of the &#8216;norm&#8217;; it&#8217;s really rather heart wrenching if you think about it.</p>
<p>And then I see a chart <a href="http://streetlightblog.blogspot.com/2011/02/inflation-expectations-and-asset-prices.html">like this</a> (h/t Ken Houghton at AB) on inflation expectations and asset prices. Yes, propping up asset prices &#8211; that&#8217;s what the Fed&#8217;s done here is inflate asset prices &#8211; will have the intended effect of dropping the saving rate and increasing current consumption; but to what end? Wall Street&#8217;s doing just fine, in fact. I&#8217;m a macroeconomic analyst and portfolio manager in the global fixed income space and have seen a nice shuffling around in the labor force. I wouldn&#8217;t say that jobs are plentiful, but popping up, nevertheless.</p>
<p>On forecasting, I find it very interesting that when Wall Street economists model their outlook for the unemployment rate &#8211; according to Bloomberg, the consensus expects the unemployment rate to drop to 8.5% in 2012 &#8211; they assume that the 2.8 million workers that are marginally attached to the labor force (of which discouraged workers is a subset) will not re-enter. Mathematically, that drops the unemployment rate: compared to a year ago, January 2010, the number of marginally attached workers has increased from 1.07% of the working-aged noninstitutional population to 1.17%, while the U3 unemployment rate dropped 9.7% to 9.0%. (the alternative measures of unemployment are listed in <a href="http://bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf">Table A-15 here.</a>)</p>
<p>I think that run75441 says it well (in the comment section of <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/02/household-survey-likely-paints-better.html">this post</a>):<br />
<blockquote>If NILF [not in the labor force] keeps going up, it does not matter what U3 does which is a joke. Parity for U3 is reached when Participation Rate equals the Participation Rate of 2001. The numeric is to nervous and today&#8217;s measurement of U3 has no meaning.</p></blockquote>
<p>Mark, thank you for your voice. It takes a lot of courage to push back against those that see just the tip of the economic iceberg, i.e. the parts of the economy that are trucking along just fine right now.</p>

                                <p><em><strong>Update:</strong> one of our readers caught a mistake in the chart. I indexed the data to December 2008, or one year after the recession actually started in December 2007. The statistics that changed are formatted in bold, and the chart in the article has been updated. The analysis doesn&#8217;t change at all, but the number of jobs lost during the recession is higher than those indicated in the original article.</em></p>
<p>From the NY Times, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/03/business/economy/03skills.html?_r=1&#038;partner=rss&#038;emc=rss">White House Plans Job Training Partnership</a> (bold by me):</p>
<blockquote><p>As part of efforts to address record-high levels of long-term unemployment, President Obama plans to announce a new national public-private partnership on Monday to help retrain workers for jobs that are in demand.</p>
<p>The national program is a response to frustrations from both workers and employers who complain that public retraining programs frequently do not provide students with employable skills. This new initiative is intended to help better align community college curriculums with the demands of local companies.</p>
<p>“The goal is to encourage community colleges and other training providers to work in close partnership with employers, to design a curriculum where they want to hire the people coming out of these programs right away,” said Austan Goolsbee, chairman of the President’s Council of Economic Advisers.</p></blockquote>
<p>The White House has coined this program Skills for America&#8217;s Future. The complication is, that lack of skills is not the problem for the <a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t04.htm">66% of the labor force aged 25 years and over</a> without a bachelor&#8217;s degree. The problem is the lack of jobs.</p>

<p>The only category to recover employment in full is that requiring a Bachelor&#8217;s degree or higher. Furthermore, no material change in employment for BA&#8217;s (or higher) has occurred since about a year ago, as indexed employment hovers around 100. No new jobs.</p>
<p>The levels of employment for those workers with the lowest levels of educational attainment, 1. and 2., are <strong>10.2% </strong>and <strong>6.6%</strong> below pre-recession levels, respectively. That is <strong>over 3.5</strong> million jobs.</p>
<p>The White House program is targeted at community college students, or education category 3., some college or associate degree in the chart above. Employment for workers with a community college degree sits over <strong>3.2%</strong> below pre-recession levels, <strong>or 1.1 </strong>million jobs. Retraining workers will not raise the employment level further.</p>
<p>The government needs to &#8220;add jobs&#8221;, not &#8220;retrain workers&#8221;, and stimulate domestic aggregate demand.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/11/business/economy/11leonhardt.html?_r=1&#038;partner=rss&#038;emc=rss">New York Times David Leonhardt argues</a> that real wages are rising, so those resilient workers that remain employed will benefit from the bounce-back in &#8220;effective pay&#8221;. The problem with this insight is twofold: first, the expansion phase of real hourly compensation, a broader measure of total earnings, is falling; and second, sitting atop a mountain of consumer and mortgage debt, the aggregate economy cannot afford a compensationless recovery.</p>
<p>From the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/11/business/economy/11leonhardt.html?_r=1&#038;partner=rss&#038;emc=rss">NY Times</a>:<br />
<blockquote>But since this recent recession began in December 2007, real average hourly pay has risen nearly 5 percent. Some employers, especially state and local governments, have cut wages. But many more employers have continued to increase pay.</p>
<p>Something similar happened during the Great Depression, notes Bruce Judson of the Yale School of Management. Falling prices meant that workers who held their jobs received a surprisingly strong effective pay raise.</p></blockquote>
<p>Rebecca: The referenced &#8220;real wages&#8221; are the <a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/realer.t02.htm">real average hourly earnings figures</a> for production and nonsupervisory workers, <a href="http://www.bls.gov/web/empsit/cestn1.htm">80% </a>of the total nonfarm payroll. The broader measure of total earnings is real hourly compensation (<a href="http://bls.gov/news.release/prod2.htm">see Table A</a> and get the data from the <a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/COMPRNFB?cid=2">Fred database</a>). Real hourly compensation measures compensation for all workers, including wages, 401k contributions, stock options, tips, and self-employed business owner compensation. (You can see a comparison of the earnings/compensation series in <a href="http://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2005/05/art1full.pdf">Exhibit 1 here.</a>)</p>
<p>Since December 2007, real hourly compensation has increased just 1.3%. Furthermore, the index declined four consecutive quarters through Q2 2010, a first since 1979-1980. If the <a href="http://www.nber.org/cycles/cyclesmain.html">NBER dates </a>the onset of the expansion at Q3 2009 (the first quarter of <a href="http://bea.gov/national/xls/gdplev.xls">po</a><a href="http://bea.gov/national/xls/gdplev.xls">sitive GDP growth</a> in 2009), real hourly compensation will have dropped .7% through Q2 2010! That&#8217;s pathetic compared to the average 2.5% gain during the first 4 quarters of expansion spanning the previous 10 recessions.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/TGL0MdTiRKI/AAAAAAAADMg/q8TuumBD0ao/s1600/hourly_earnings_table.PNG"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/TGL0MdTiRKI/AAAAAAAADMg/q8TuumBD0ao/s400/hourly_earnings_table.PNG" alt="" border="0"></a>The table lists the gain/loss of real hourly compensation, <a href="http://bls.gov/news.release/prod2.t02.htm">measured by the BLS</a>,  during the recession and early recovery for the business cycle as dated by the <a href="http://www.nber.org/cycles/cyclesmain.html">NBER</a>.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how I see it: the problem is not that real hourly compensation is falling during the the recovery, per se, it&#8217;s that real hourly compensation is falling during the recovery of a  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Balance-Sheet-Recession-Uncharted-Implications/dp/0470821167">balance sheet recession.</a><a name="more"></a></p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/TGLatM1pgTI/AAAAAAAADMI/bqYqyVr36pQ/s1600/recovery_earnings_chart.PNG"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/TGLatM1pgTI/AAAAAAAADMI/bqYqyVr36pQ/s400/recovery_earnings_chart.PNG" alt="" border="0"></a>In the context of wage and compensation growth, the NY Times article was misleading in its comparison of the Great Depression to the &#8217;07-&#8217;09 Great Recession. Mass default during the Great Depression wiped private-sector balance sheets clean, no debt. But not this time around. <a href="http://www.newsneconomics.com/2010/04/reducing-household-financial-leverage.html">We&#8217;re going to need a lot of income growth</a> (the BLS measure of real hourly compensation includes measures of income at the BEA) to increase saving enough to deleverage the aggregate household balance sheet.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/08/consumer-confidence.html">I&#8217;ll say it again</a>: we can&#8217;t afford a jobless recovery. Specifically, we can&#8217;t afford a compensationless recovery.</p>

                                <p>This recession caused a severe disruption in the labor market for teen employment. The chart below illustrates the unemployment rate alongside the employment-to-population ratio for those aged 16-19 years.</p>
<p>The visual is quite striking: at the peak of the business cycle, December 2007, the difference between the employment-to-population ratio over the unemployment rate was roughly 17.3 percentage points (pps). In June 2010, however, the difference narrowed fully to -0.3 pps.</p>

In April, <a href="http://www.oecd.org/document/49/0,3343,en_21571361_44315115_45008113_1_1_1_1,00.html">the OECD issued a press release</a> (featuring <a href="http://www.oecd.org/officialdocuments/displaydocumentpdf?cote=DELSA/ELSA/WD/SEM%282010%296&#038;doclanguage=en">related research</a>) calling for government support for &#8220;youth&#8221; unemployment across the member countries:<br />
<blockquote>The report’s message is that governments need to do much more to help young people. Some have benefitted from broader efforts to help the unemployed. But more policies are needed that target young people, especially those with poor education and skills. These “at-risk” youngsters now account for between three and four out of ten of all young people in the OECD and are at risk of long-term joblessness and reduced earnings.</p></blockquote>
<p>Back in June, the <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jun/29/business/la-fi-teen-jobs-20100628">LA Times</a> argued that young workers in the US, workers aged 16-19, are being displaced by college graduates and other skilled workers; in better times these workers would not take jobs normally filled by teenagers.</p>
<p>The recession has been particularly cruel to those aged 16-19. However, the chart above illustrates that the downward trend is both secular and cyclical, as the employment-to-population ratio has trended down since 2000.<a name="more"></a></p>
<p>At the turn of the century, the employment to population ratio for teens aged 16-19 years was 45% (average over the year), and just 35% in 2007. There’s a problem here. Workers aged 16-19 generally earn low hourly wages (unless they invented Facebook, of course); and in some cases, even the small monthly sum supports family income. And as the OECD report suggests, often young workers do not qualify for unemployment insurance when displaced.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve’s latest <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/bulletin/2009/pdf/scf09.pdf">Survey of Consumer Finance (2004-2007)</a> indicates that much of the mean income growth is accumulating at the top 10% of the income distribution (<a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/bulletin/2009/pdf/scf09.pdf">Table 1</a>). Spanning 2004-2007, the bottom 20% experienced 3.4% income growth, while the top 10% saw near 20% gains. And every bracket in between saw either negative or near-zero income growth.</p>
<p>Here’s the bigger picture: teen income is likely becoming increasingly important to the families at the bottom of the income distribution, while the jobs are becoming increasingly scarce.</p>
<p>Without entry level jobs, aggregate work experience starts to decline, which translates into lower skill overall; and then productivity declines. Bad stuff.</p>

                                <p>Unemployment rates across the G7 illustrate a broad-based labor recovery. Fantastic &#8211; now let&#8217;s get to the underlying stories.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/TC41ayrni6I/AAAAAAAADJY/wTiEOfg_gZ0/s1600/urate_g7.png"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/TC41ayrni6I/AAAAAAAADJY/wTiEOfg_gZ0/s400/urate_g7.png" alt="" border="0"></a>(Note: The US is the first to release the June 2010 figures. All other unemployment rates, except for the UK, are current as of May 2010.)</p>
<p>Germany, France, and Italy: Germany&#8217;s labor market is ostensibly improving, as the unemployment rate continues its descent. However, <a href="http://www.newsneconomics.com/2010/06/european-propaganda.html">don&#8217;t be fooled by these statistics</a>: the German government is subsidizing firms to drop hours in lieu of outright layoffs.</p>
<p>And across the Eurozone, fiscal tightening will drive unemployment rates up; <a href="http://www.newdeal20.org/2010/06/30/ireland-in-decline-or-what-austerity-looks-like-13658/">look at what fiscal austerity got </a><a href="http://www.newdeal20.org/2010/06/30/ireland-in-decline-or-what-austerity-looks-like-13658/">Ireland</a>.<br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>The United States: <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/07/employment-report.html#more">Spencer</a>, as usual, gives his insightful take on the US employment release: not good. The real problem is that the US private sector is sitting on an iceberg of debt; and the only way to avoid the economic pain of large-scale default is by dropping leverage via nominal income (wages) growth.</p>
<p>Workers have NO pricing power. How can they when the<a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/EMRATIO?cid=12"> employment to population</a> ratio dropped 0.2% to 58.5% in June? Note that 58.5% is consistent with a 1970&#8217;s-1980&#8217;s style labor force with fewer females working. Wages are going nowhere until the labor market improves substantially, and the private sector can&#8217;t do it atop the iceberg of debt. We need the government&#8217;s help there.</p>
<p>UK: The pace of the labor market deterioration is slowing (not evident in the unemployment rate, which dates to just March, but more evident in the <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/pdfdir/lmsuk0610.pdf">claimant count</a>). However, the unemployment rate is expected to rise as the government&#8217;s self-imposed austerity measures are put into play. Furthermore, look for weakening labor conditions to push further default amid big household leverage.</p>
<p>Canada: The labor market is strong as illustrated by the marked improvement in the <a href="http://www.statcan.gc.ca/subjects-sujets/labour-travail/lfs-epa/lfs-epa-eng.htm">employment figures</a>. Expansionary policy was very likely too expansionary, and the Bank of Canada <a href="http://www.bankofcanada.ca/en/monetary/target.html">has initiated its tightening cycle</a>. The economy is <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/economy/canadas-economy-keeps-roaring-ahead/article1586464/">hot right now</a>.</p>
<p>Update: A reader notes that April GDP  was released a couple of days before this article published. <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-06-30/canada-economy-unexpectedly-stalls-in-april-on-payback-for-march-growth.html">Indeed  the economy posted 0% economic gain in April</a> &#8211; not hot over the  month. However, the jobs picture remains solid on a month to month  basis, as <a href="http://www.statcan.gc.ca/subjects-sujets/labour-travail/lfs-epa/lfs-epa-eng.htm">May  2010 employment</a> gains were +25,000 and all (in net) in the &#8220;full  time&#8221; category. Being a small-open economy, much of Canada&#8217;s economic  outlook depends on external factors, especially the outlook of the US  economy.</p>
<p>Japan: The labor market is weak, as most industries posted job losses in May 2010 (access Japanese labor data <a href="http://www.stat.go.jp/english/data/roudou/154.htm">here</a>).</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Let us see if we can translate <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/02/trade-offs-and-revealed-preferences.html" target="_blank">my previous post on job selection</a> into an economic model.  Start with a basic formula:<br />
<blockquote>(1) AcceptOffer = a(1) + a(2)*<em>w</em> + a(3)*<em>b</em> + a(4)*<em>oa</em> + a(5)*<em>t</em></p></blockquote>
<p>where a is a constant, <em>w</em> is wages, <em>b</em> is benefits, <em>oa</em> is &#8220;opportunity for advancement&#8221; and <em>t</em> is treatment received in the workplace.</p>
<p>The first observation we make is that several of these variables are difficult to quantify—and even more difficult to objectify. So let’s start with the easy ones.</p>
<p><em>w</em> is very identifiable: reported (on a per capita aggregate basis), subject to enforcement penalties (e.g., minimum wage laws), and used in “downstream applications” (e.g., tax filings) and therefore relatively verifiable.</p>
<p><em>b</em> is (1) known to be non-negative and (2) often variable within, let alone between, organizations. (Vacation time, sick days, insurances offered and costs to the employee all may vary depending on level, time of service, location of office, etc.)</p>
<p>This could present a problem, but here we can use standard economic theory to our advantage. We do not know the amount of <em>b</em>, but we can assume that the employer is rational, and is offering a total compensation to the worker that s/he expects will be less than or equal to the marginal product of that person’s labor. We therefore can reasonably assume that <em>b</em> is related to <em>w</em>. If we then review the available aggregate data we can approximate that benefits offered will be approximately a certain percentage of <em>w</em>—and that workers will assume that assumption (and, in most cases, verify that assumption within a margin of error) before accepting the job.</p>
<p>We then restate the equation as<br />
<blockquote>(2a) AcceptOffer = a(1) + a(2’)*<em>w’</em> + a(4)*<em>oa</em> + a(5)*<em>t</em></p></blockquote>
<p>where w’ is the weighted combination of <em>w </em>and <em>b</em> above, and a(2’) is the restated coefficient.</p>
<p>If we then assume that all parties have full information of the ratio of wages to benefits, then a(2’) = a(2)=a(3), so we simplify to:<br />
<blockquote>(2b) AcceptOffer = a(1) + a(2)*<em>w’</em> + a(4)*<em>oa</em> + a(5)*<em>t</em></p></blockquote>
<p>We now have to consider opportunities for advancement and treatment. Here, we have two problems that are difficult, possibly insurmountable, for modeling.</p>
<p>The first is a lack of measurability. There are no public records for &#8220;didn&#8217;t get promoted.&#8221; Nor, except in extreme cases, is there a way to measure treatment by supervisors. The data that might be available&mdassh;lawsuits, official complaints, even Human Resources files (for which there are significant privacy considerations)—is all negative and, accordingly, skewed (biased). This is because (a) ninety percent or so of all workers and/or bosses will never have a complaint filed against them and (b) the ability to file a complaint may be present because the <em>general</em> work atmosphere is more amenable to filing one than not, so the presence of a complaint is not in itself a good or bad thing for the overall measure.</p>
<p>The second is that tolerances vary by person. To use an absurd example, people who use &#8220;Every Breath You Take&#8221; for their wedding may be more likely to tolerate attentions that others view as harassment. Similarly, forcing people to clock out for a &#8220;smoke break&#8221; will be viewed differently depending upon whether one is a smoker or not. General policies are just that—general.</p>
<p>So, if we are building an <em>economic</em> model, we must come up with a reasonable approximation of these last two variables. The most direct way to do this is the standard method: assume each individual has their own <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indifference_curve">Utility Curve</a>, and &#8220;prices&#8221; accordingly.</p>
<p>Based on their preferences and options, then, we map the compensation required to offset negative consequences from <em>oa</em> and <em>t</em>. While the variables still are not directly observable, we can make a simplifying assumption:<br />
<blockquote><em>Assume that the compensation required to do the work is a factor of w’</em>.</p></blockquote>
<p>Have to work in the sewer system? Change <em>w’</em> to compensate. Need to work the night shift and/or weekends? Same type of adjustment. Boss clearly favors buxom blondes and you’re a petite redhead? Adjust current salary requirements to compensate for lowered opportunity for advancement/promotion. You’re a b.b. who will have trouble getting work done because the boss will harass you? Adjust accordingly.</p>
<p>We assume—due to the constraint: a lack of available data—that we can reduce &#8220;a(4)*<em>oa</em> + a(5)*<em>t</em>&#8221; to some proportion of <em>w</em> that will compensate the worker for the environment into which they are being placed. <strong><em>If</em></strong> we further assume that the worker has complete information as to hisser preferences, the worker will not accept a job that does not offer that level of compensation.</p>
<p>So we can restate equation 2(b) using the Utility Curve assumption. Assume<br />
<blockquote>(3a)<em> </em>a(6)*<em>w&#8221;</em> =a(4)*<em>oa</em> + a(5)*<em>t</em></p></blockquote>
<p>such that w&#8221; also proportionate to <em>w</em>(and therefore <em>w&#8217;</em> as well) and a(6) is the coefficient <em>selected by the individual</em> that makes the offered wage compensatory to the opportunities for advancement and expected treatment on a Present Value basis.</p>
<p>We can then reduce equation (2b) to<br />
<blockquote>(3b) AcceptOffer = a(1) + a(2)*<em>w&#8217;</em> + a(6)*<em>w&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>or, given that (a) w&#8221; is proportionate to w and w’ and (b) that the multiplier in most cases is 1, and (c) the constant (e.g., signing bonus) can be assumed without loss of generality to be 0,<br />
<blockquote>(3b) AcceptOffer = <a href="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/S4LGtK1zFLI/AAAAAAAAAYI/m9an9O0txXo/s1600-h/clip_image002%5B10%5D%5B2%5D.gif"><img title="clip_image002[10]" height="17" alt="clip_image002[10]" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/S4LGtXR3D8I/AAAAAAAAAYM/z0Y4LZJLW8I/clip_image002%5B10%5D_thumb.gif?imgmax=800" width="11" border="0"></a></p></blockquote>
<p>to indicate that the value varies with individuals.</p>
<p>To concretize the example, assume that a redhead and a blonde, as above, are both offered a job. Assume further that the redhead’s compensation requirement—lower-but-still-positive opportunity for advancement—is lower than the blonde’s for will-be-harassed-and-work-will-be-impeded. That is<br />
<blockquote><a href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/S4LGtrWCNpI/AAAAAAAAAYQ/7qbqEBjh6Cs/s1600-h/clip_image002%5B3%5D.gif"><img title="clip_image002" height="17" alt="clip_image002" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/S4LGuADl1HI/AAAAAAAAAYU/ItL5uUDAlQQ/clip_image002_thumb.gif?imgmax=800" width="11" border="0"></a><em>(r)</em> < <a href="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/S4LGufJu8WI/AAAAAAAAAYY/bCJ5HPKY9qU/s1600-h/clip_image002%5B4%5D%5B2%5D.gif"><img title="clip_image002[4]" height="17" alt="clip_image002[4]" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/S4LGurcui8I/AAAAAAAAAYc/LHyPmIBGxaY/clip_image002%5B4%5D_thumb.gif?imgmax=800" width="11" border="0"></a><em>(b)</em></p></blockquote>
<p>There are four possibilities:
<ol>
<li>The offered wage will be below<a href="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/S4LGu1aIV6I/AAAAAAAAAYg/x7V53YmAXfU/s1600-h/clip_image002%5B12%5D%5B2%5D.gif"><img title="clip_image002[12]" height="17" alt="clip_image002[12]" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/S4LGvWq5eZI/AAAAAAAAAYk/wQGeGPehazA/clip_image002%5B12%5D_thumb.gif?imgmax=800" width="11" border="0"></a>(r), in which case neither will accept the job </li>
<p>
<li>The offered wage will be below <a href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/S4LGvjyDDKI/AAAAAAAAAYo/o0obNhnhIk0/s1600-h/clip_image002%5B14%5D%5B2%5D.gif"><img title="clip_image002[14]" height="17" alt="clip_image002[14]" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/S4LGv9ndK9I/AAAAAAAAAYs/JCTGKWNVGq0/clip_image002%5B14%5D_thumb.gif?imgmax=800" width="11" border="0"></a>(b) but above <a href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/S4LGwNJQUPI/AAAAAAAAAYw/gCdhbJUiZl0/s1600-h/clip_image002%5B16%5D%5B2%5D.gif"><img title="clip_image002[16]" height="17" alt="clip_image002[16]" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/S4LGwdpcncI/AAAAAAAAAY0/PCuAWlZujn8/clip_image002%5B16%5D_thumb.gif?imgmax=800" width="11" border="0"></a>(r), in which case one of the two positions will be filled </li>
<p>
<li>The offered wage will be above <a href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/S4LGxJBVhvI/AAAAAAAAAY4/J2c7kFEZzmk/s1600-h/clip_image002%5B18%5D%5B2%5D.gif"><img title="clip_image002[18]" height="17" alt="clip_image002[18]" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/S4LGxW8AvMI/AAAAAAAAAY8/vtmCm_F7pgU/clip_image002%5B18%5D_thumb.gif?imgmax=800" width="11" border="0"></a>(b), in which case both will accept the offer and the company will have offered a higher wage than was required to fill both positions. (That the offer is what the company believes will be the employees’ s marginal product of labor [MPL] is a collateral issue.), or</li>
<p>
<li>The company will negotiate with each, offering the redhead <img title="clip_image002[20]" height="17" alt="clip_image002[20]" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/S4LGxuQRjoI/AAAAAAAAAZA/mJVbJH7dPr0/clip_image002%5B20%5D_thumb.gif?imgmax=800" width="11" border="0">(r) and the blonde <a href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/S4LGx3z-aJI/AAAAAAAAAZE/IFKqmnu3GBc/s1600-h/clip_image002%5B22%5D%5B2%5D.gif"><img title="clip_image002[22]" height="17" alt="clip_image002[22]" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/S4LGyI3QH8I/AAAAAAAAAZI/cizz9bm5bWU/clip_image002%5B22%5D_thumb.gif?imgmax=800" width="11" border="0"></a>(b), and everyone will be happy—so long as initial expectations were accurate (or, if you prefer, the new employees both had full information).</li>
</ol>
<p>Note also that there is a learning process for both the applicant and the employer. Offers and demands will be adjusted based on historic data (if both decline the offer, the next candidates of similar background will be offered more, and perceptions of growth (improvements in experience and/or education by the worker).</p>
<p>If we generalize this, we note that there is a distribution of <a href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/S4LGynLuVXI/AAAAAAAAAZM/UsSeWigsmCw/s1600-h/clip_image002%5B24%5D%5B2%5D.gif"><img title="clip_image002[24]" height="17" alt="clip_image002[24]" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/S4LGzGVAqoI/AAAAAAAAAZQ/OoL_gHcZXUM/clip_image002%5B24%5D_thumb.gif?imgmax=800" width="11" border="0"></a> (due to Individual Preferences). If we further make simplifying assumptions—e.g., a normal distribution of <a href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/S4LGzUttzmI/AAAAAAAAAZU/5QDUxon_-Mg/s1600-h/clip_image002%5B26%5D%5B2%5D.gif"><img title="clip_image002[26]" height="17" alt="clip_image002[26]" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/S4LGzyCWkpI/AAAAAAAAAZY/n2fVQtgrOxw/clip_image002%5B26%5D_thumb.gif?imgmax=800" width="11" border="0"></a> among the population—we come to the conceit of the &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservation_wage" target="_blank">reservation wage</a>,&#8221; and all the economic literature that is attendant upon it.</p>
<p>So that is how you build an economic model.  The question then becomes: how do you <em>use </em>it?  A relatively short (though it does incorporate a micro model) discussion of that continues below the fold.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />The problem—if it is one (I’m inclined to argue it is; YMMV)—is that, having built a model in which all the proxying assumptions are &#8220;simplified&#8221; into a single variable, we lose some granularity, having made a trade-off for the sake of measurement.</p>
<p>Accordingly, a change in the &#8220;reservation wage&#8221; may not in itself tell us whether the real wage has gone up or the work environment has become, on balance, more or less acceptable.</p>
<p>Again, an example, one that will be familiar to students of microeconomics. You are given two choices: (1) you can receive $100 right here and now or (2) you can travel a known distance (say, five miles)—with a finite chance of death or injury—and receive $1,000,000 on completion.</p>
<p>Surroundings, at this point, matter. If the five miles traveled is as an American soldier in full uniform walking outside of the Green Zone, you might well choose $100. Even when you are native to the area, the choice may vary: walking five miles through one gang&#8217;s territory is a different option than traveling that distance through different territories. Or even a pure environmental matter may have an effect: Walking five miles through a desert with no canteen, or having to swim five miles from shore in a dangerous waters, is not the same risk as walking five miles down an unpaved dirt road in the middle of the day. Even if you would be required “only” to walk down a heavily-used interstate highway with no shoulder or sidewalks, discretion may be the better part of valor.</p>
<p>Over time, through the “learning process” (op cit. Arrow, 1962, as all good op cits must), the dollars offered will be adjusted so that the payouts balance on a risk-adjusted basis. (Collaterally, there may be other reasons for the greater payouts; signaling by any other name.)</p>
<p>Now suppose the landscape changes. There is a canteen every half-mile in the desert. A gang is run out of its territory, or takes over another&#8217;s territory. The Green Zone becomes larger.</p>
<p>The balance has changed; the risk is different. The job is demonstrably different, and therefore requires lower (higher) compensation. But the difference has nothing directly to do with the base salary/benefits requirement and everything to do with the <em>overall attractiveness </em>and/or <em>treatment received</em>.</p>
<p>If we were to forget that, we would conclude that there is more demand for the job itself, and therefore people are willing to take a lower salary. If, on the other hand, we keep in mind that there are more factors to the reservation wage than just the salary itself, we realize that producing a more pleasant work atmosphere is beneficial to our firm, as it enables us both to present a good face to clients <em>and</em> to reduce our cost of labor.</p>
<p>The first type of economist probably should be avoided, as he adds very little value to the discussion of how to use the model.</p>

                                <p>While I applaud the cautious optimism of <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2010/02/employment-report.html">Spencer</a> and <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2010/02/back-to-zero.html">Tom</a>, I&#8217;m more inclined to quote <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2010/02/05/economists-react-jobs-report-has-more-good-than-bad/">Joseph Brusuelas</a>:<br />
<blockquote>[T]he January payrolls added a dollop of Zen like logic to a recovery that is shaping up like no other. An additional 111,000 workers entered the labor force, yet the unemployment rate fell to 9.7% while private sector employment continued to contract. Hours worked, demand for temporary workers and the hiring in the service sector all improved. However, without the benchmark revisions, the unemployment rate would have increased to 10.6% which better captures the condition of an economy that has seen 8.4 million workers displaced during the recession.</p></blockquote>
<p>The bump in manufacturing was more than balanced by the drop in the Service Sector, as more and more <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2010/01/i-got-your-real-state-of-union-right.html">flower shops</a> cut staff in the face of slack demand and <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/bcreg/20100205a.htm">unavailable credit</a>.</p>
<p>If the bank bailout was to bailout the banks—defibrillating them to kick-start the economy&#8217;s heart, as it were—then it appears to be time to admit that that program was too small. Or to stop the other programs that are making it <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2010/02/heavy-flow-not-ipad-post.html">more advantageous for banks to hold funds than lend them</a>.  Any way you look at it, the optimistic view that declining unemployment has started <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2010/02/05/dont-expect-the-unemployment-rate-decline-to-last/">doesn&#8217;t appear to be the way to bet</a>.
