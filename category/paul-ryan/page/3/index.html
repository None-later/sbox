                                <div>(Reuters) &#8211; Invoking Pope Benedict, Republican Representative Paul Ryan defended his budget plan on Thursday at Georgetown University, where a group of the Jesuit institution&#8217;s faculty has accused him of misusing Catholic teachings to push cuts to programs that serve the poor.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>&#8220;The overarching threat to our whole society today is the exploding federal debt,&#8221; Ryan said, speaking in a Gothic, oak-paneled auditorium on the Georgetown campus.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>&#8220;The Holy Father, Pope Benedict, has charged that governments, communities, and individuals running up high debt levels are &#8216;living at the expense of future generations&#8217; and &#8216;living in untruth.'&#8221;

</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The overarching threat to our whole society today is the exploding federal debt?  Well, maybe. But this is an argument against raising revenues by raising taxes on the wealthy?  Or, for that matter, on anyone?<br /> <br />What’s most angering is this deliberately disorienting, gimmicky refusal by these pols—Ryan and Romney, in particular—to acknowledge that raising revenue through taxes reduces the government’s budget deficit and debt; that lowered tax rates in the last 11 years have significantly increased budget deficits and the debt (and that that also happened in the 1980s); that budget deficits and the national debt decreased during the 1990s after tax rates were raised during the G.H.W. Bush administration; and that Ryan’s and Romney’s tax-reduction plans would, according to (apparently) all projections except their own, substantially increase the national debt. <br /> <br />It’s one thing to argue for a substantial reduction or elimination of the national debt, but quite another to pretend that raising tax revenues isn’t one possible way to help do that.  <br /> <br /><a name="more"></a>These people do make Ayn Rand philosophical arguments to support their policy proposals, but the claim that the pope “has charged that governments, communities, and individuals running up high debt levels are ‘living at the expense of future generations’ and ‘living in untruth,’” is a <i>non sequitur </i>to the question of <i>how</i> we reduce the national debt.  
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>It appears, though, that this particular bait-and-switch—Ryan’s claim that the pope supports his budget proposals because the pope has expressed concern about high debt levels of governments, communities and individuals—is causing outright revulsion among both <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/paul-ryans-faith-based-lesson/2012/04/27/gIQAH76TlT_story.html">mainstream media pundits </a>and the general public once they hear about it.  The pope as Ryan’s budget guide?  Really?  Comments posted to an article about it yesterday on Slate, titled “<a href="http://slatest.slate.com/posts/2012/04/27/paul_ryan_cites_pope_benedict_to_defend_budget.html">Paul Ryan Cites Pope In Defense of Budget Plan</a>,” almost universally express disgust and dismay at Ryan’s claim.  The pope as Ryan’s budget guide?  </p>
</div>
<div>The beauty of Ryan’s statement is that it helpfully highlights that, Romney’s insistence to the contrary, this election is not about the present and future economy—will cutting taxes for the wealthy by 20% and eliminating the EPA and banking regulations really spur the economy and lower the national debt?—but instead <a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2012/04/romneys-radical-theory-of-fairness.html">about the very structure and purpose ofgovernment itself</a>.  And because Ryan has now invoked the pope as supposed political supporter of Ryan’s budget, the <i>real</i> Republican intent will likely gain widespread attention.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Halleluiah.  And praise the pope.

<p>Ayn Rand v. Thomas Aquinas in Paul Ryan&#8217;s Mind</p>
<p> <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2012/04/26/471730/paul-ryan-ayn-rand/">Think Progress</a> piece on Paul Ryan.   </p>
<p>Think Progress has a post noting that though Paul Ryan used to go around telling people he got into politics because of Ayn Rand, and he required all his aides to read Atlas Shrugged, now he tells the <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/297023/ryan-shrugged-robert-costa">National Review</a>:   <br />
<blockquote><bold>“I reject her philosophy,” Ryan says firmly.</bold> “It’s an atheist philosophy. It reduces human interactions down to mere contracts and it is antithetical to my worldview. If somebody is going to try to paste a person’s view on epistemology to me, then give me Thomas Aquinas,” who believed that man needs divine help in the pursuit of knowledge. “Don’t give me Ayn Rand,” he says.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;d be inclined to believe him if he started handing out copies of the Summa Theologica (in the original Latin, of course) to his aides and requiring them to read them as he did with Atlas Shrugs.  But seriously, Aquinas?  On the plus side, what he wrote is free today.  (Here&#8217;s the <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=Y20eKOudwM0C&#038;printsec=frontcover&#038;dq=summa+theologica&#038;hl=en&#038;sa=X&#038;ei=3r2aT7yYDor06AG9hK2bDw&#038;ved=0CFAQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&#038;q=summa%20theologica&#038;f=false">Summa Theologica</a>, considered his greatest work, in English.)   I&#8217;ll be honest &#8211; I tried to stumble through the Summa Theologica in my youth, but with no success.  That said, I don&#8217;t I&#8217;d pay to hear Ryan explain Aquinas&#8217;s work (provided it was a truthful and honest explanation) and how he plans to implement it to the American public.     I&#8217;d especially love to hear him explain <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/summa/3078.htm#1">this</a> to the banking community:   <br />
<blockquote>Consequently, just as it is a sin against justice, to take money, by tacit or express agreement, in return for lending money or anything else that is consumed by being used, so also is it a like sin, by tacit or express agreement to receive anything whose price can be measured by money. Yet there would be no sin in receiving something of the kind, not as exacting it, nor yet as though it were due on account of some agreement tacit or expressed, but as a gratuity: since, even before lending the money, one could accept a gratuity, nor is one in a worse condition through lending.  On the other hand it is lawful to exact compensation for a loan, in respect of such things as are not appreciated by a measure of money, for instance, benevolence, and love for the lender, and so forth.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, if Bank of America did start making loans simply out of benevolence or to encourage love for the lender, perhaps they&#8217;d make a lot fewer loans of the type that later require the benevolence of the Treasury and the Fed to bail them out.     </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s more from <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/summa/3066.htm">the Summa Theologica</a>  </p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />
<blockquote>Things which are of human right cannot derogate from natural right or Divine right. Now according to the natural order established by Divine Providence, inferior things are ordained for the purpose of succoring man&#8217;s needs by their means. Wherefore the division and appropriation of things which are based on human law, do not preclude the fact that man&#8217;s needs have to be remedied by means of these very things. Hence whatever certain people have in superabundance is due, by natural law, to the purpose of succoring the poor. For this reason Ambrose [Loc. cit., 2, Objection 3] says, and his words are embodied in the Decretals (Dist. xlvii, can. Sicut ii): &#8220;It is the hungry man&#8217;s bread that you withhold, the naked man&#8217;s cloak that you store away, the money that you bury in the earth is the price of the poor man&#8217;s ransom and freedom.&#8221;   Since, however, there are many who are in need, while it is impossible for all to be succored by means of the same thing, each one is entrusted with the stewardship of his own things, so that out of them he may come to the aid of those who are in need. Nevertheless, if the need be so manifest and urgent, that it is evident that the present need must be remedied by whatever means be at hand (for instance when a person is in some imminent danger, and there is no other possible remedy), then it is lawful for a man to succor his own need by means of another&#8217;s property, by taking it either openly or secretly: nor is this properly speaking theft or robbery.</p></blockquote>
<p>Like I said, I&#8217;d love to hear Ryan explain this stuff to the American public.  But somehow I don&#8217;t think this is what Ryan had in mind when he says &#8220;give me Thomas Aquinas.&#8221;  I&#8217;d be willing to bet he read less of Aquinas than I did.   Hat tips to both <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/27/a-is-not-a-it-seems/">Paul Krugman</a> and <a href="http://tbogg.firedoglake.com/2012/04/26/dreamy-paul-ryan-breaks-up-with-his-special-lady-now-available/">TBogg</a> (great minds think alike?).</p>

                                <p>Given Ryan’s release of his new plan calling for territorial taxation of corporations comes this example of Apple from Kenneth Thomas, <a href="http://middleclasspoliticaleconomist.blogspot.com/2012/03/apple-whines-about-having-to-pay-taxes.html">Middle class political economist</a> econoblog:</p>
<p>Apple Whines About Having to Pay Taxes<br />by<strong> Kenneth Thomas</strong><br />   <br />On Monday, <a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2012/03/19Apple-Announces-Plans-to-Initiate-Dividend-and-Share-Repurchase-Program.html">Apple announced</a> that it was going to start paying dividends to shareholders, and buy back $10 billion worth of stock. What caught many people&#8217;s attention in the subsequent conference call, however, was the company&#8217;s <a href="http://idealab.talkingpointsmemo.com/2012/03/white-house-unmoved-by-apples-offshore-cash-problem.php?ref=fpnewsfeed">pointed statement</a> that it would not be bringing back any of the cash it holds overseas, estimated at $64 billion, or over 64% of its current cash on hand.    <br />The reason, as stated by Chief Financial Officer Peter Oppenheimer, is that it would have to pay taxes on this money if it were repatriated to the United States. Apple made the money, so it owes taxes on it just like you or I would. But because the money was earned overseas (though realistically, some of it probably got there through <a href="http://middleclasspoliticaleconomist.blogspot.com/2011/11/how-transfer-pricing-hurts-middle-class.html">transfer pricing</a>), it can defer paying taxes on it until the money comes home. Taxes deferred are taxes reduced due to the time value of money, but that&#8217;s not enough for Apple. In good <a href="http://middleclasspoliticaleconomist.blogspot.com/2012/01/jon-stewart-delivers-goods-on-mitt.html">Mitt Romney fashion</a>, Apple is <a href="http://idealab.talkingpointsmemo.com/2012/03/white-house-unmoved-by-apples-offshore-cash-problem.php?ref=fpnewsfeed">working with other companies</a> to try to get the tax laws changed in its favor.What they want, as Carl Franzen of TPM points out, is a &#8220;repatriation holiday&#8221; that will allow them to bring back the money at a greatly reduced tax rate, as in 2004. Franzen notes:</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />
<blockquote>However, in that 2004 experiment, pharmaceutical companies were the largest beneficiaries and although $312 billion was brought back into the U.S. by some 800 companies, most of the money was spent on dividends and stock repurchases, as <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-09-29/google-joins-apple-mobilizing-lobbyists-to-push-for-tax-holiday-on-profits.html"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/20/business/20tax.html?pagewanted=all"><em>the New York Times</em></a> both reported, referring to numerous studies. In fact, some of the companies that benefited the most from the 2004 tax holiday ended up laying off employees.</p></blockquote>
<p>Today, despite having just gone through the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, U.S. multinationals now have over three times as much overseas as was brought back in 2004, some $1 trillion, according to Franzen&#8217;s article. Apple&#8217;s action Monday suggests that more dividends and stock repurchases would be the order of the day once again if they got their way.  <br />According to <a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/fox/2012/03/how-to-bring-apples-overseas-c.html">Justin Fox</a>, the $64 billion is &#8220;sitting in Apple&#8217;s overseas subsidiaries&#8230;&#8221; This almost certainly means it is in Ireland: According to Apple&#8217;s <a href="http://investor.apple.com/secfiling.cfm?filingID=1193125-11-282113&#038;CIK=320193">2011 Annual Report</a> (Exhibit 21.1), it has only two &#8220;significant&#8221; subsidiaries outside the country (and one significant subsidiary in the U.S.), both of which are in Ireland. Apple, then, is simultaneously benefiting from Ireland&#8217;s tax haven status and the deferral provisions of U.S. tax law.  <br />What should be done? <a href="http://middleclasspoliticaleconomist.blogspot.com/2011/11/how-profitable-fortune-500-companies.html">I agreed with Citizens for Tax Justice</a> in January that not taxing worldwide corporate profits would give companies even more incentive to make their profits show up overseas than they do now. Fox notes a similar argument from tax attorney Edward D. Kleinbard, who says that ending the deferral provision is the right way to go. That way, companies&#8217; income would be taxed in the year it was earned, and multinationals would get no benefit relative to domestic companies that don&#8217;t squirrel away their profits overseas. It would go a long way to ending our current situation where there is one tax law for the 1% and another one for the rest of us.</p>

See, e.g., <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/27/us/politics/27congress.html" target="_blank" _mce_href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/27/us/politics/27congress.html">House G.O.P. Members Face Voter Anger Over Budget</a>, New York Times, Apr. 26, 2011 (noting Webster&#8217;s statement that &#8220;not one senior citizen is harmed by this budget&#8221; while implying that it is necessary to prevent grandchildren from &#8220;looking at a bankrupt country&#8221;); <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/04/26/ap/national/main20057685.shtml" target="_blank" _mce_href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/04/26/ap/national/main20057685.shtml">Congressional Republicans go home to mixed reveiws</a>, CBS.com, Apr. 26, 2011 (noting North Carolina GOP Rep. Renee Ellmers&#8217;claim that &#8220;If you&#8217;re 55 and older, your Medicare and Social Security will not change&#8221;).<br /><a name="more"></a><br />But the Ryan proposal clearly envisions mechanisms that would likely lead to decimation of these programs&#8211;either through turning them into limited vouchers (Medicare proposal); turning the funds over to the states to use as they see fit (Medicaid proposal) or limiting benefits (Social Security proposal) in ways that will &#8211;probably sooner rather than later&#8211; hurt everybody.</p>

<li>These proposals take place in a context of expansive, concerted attacks on these &#8220;entitlement&#8221; programs, often failing to acknowledge the historic support for these programs or their foundation in the recognition that federal support is required to protect against the abject poverty and humiliating degradation that accompanied the Great Depression;</li>
<li>Benefits for elderly and sick Americans are cut to provide savings to offset some of the loss of revenues from tax cuts for Big Business and the wealthy, both of whom already pay relatively low taxes, in what hardly seems a bargain to the working poor, the elderly or in fact the overwhelming majority of Americans who are not in the top 15% income or wealth distribution. (This in spite of Ryan&#8217;s claim that there is no huge tax cut for big corporations and the wealthy&#8211;he asserts that the proposed 25% rate is &#8220;in exchange for losing their tax shelters&#8221;. See, e.g., CBS.com <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=7363939n&#038;tag=related;photovideo" target="_blank" _mce_href="http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=7363939n&#038;tag=related;photovideo">Evening News coverage of Paul Ryan holding Wis. town meetings</a>, at <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=7363939n&#038;tag=related;photovideo" _mce_href="http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=7363939n&#038;tag=related;photovideo">http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=7363939n&#038;tag=related;photovideo</a> )</li>
<li>In spite of the high cost for the vulnerable poor and elderly of these budget proposals, they don&#8217;t appear likely to achieve their proffered rationale of reducing debt and deficits&#8211;in fact, the CBO has said that the Ryan budget proposal will result in higher deficits and bigger debt burdens over the next decade.</li>
<p>
<li>It appears shortsighted to wring one&#8217;s hands about a &#8220;bankrupt country&#8221; while considering only one potential solution, especially when that solution is highly detrimental to the most vulnerable populations, and without considering the full facts regarding the amount of debt, the ability of the U.S. to weaken the dollar further to aid unemployment and debt payment, the ability of the U.S. to raise taxes judiciously rather then merely cutting spending, or the ability of the U.S. to let the tax law play out as it is currently slated to do (with the Bush tax cuts that were extended 2 more years over their originally intended short life due to sunset in 2012). As Jim Johnson, a former Ryan supporter who has &#8220;grown increasingly disgusted&#8221; with Ryan noted, &#8220;[Ryan] says Medicare is unsustainable. I&#8217;m thinking, &#8216;Yeah, it&#8217;s because medical costs are out of control.&#8217; &#8230;Why isn&#8217;t he attacking it at that level?&#8221; <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/04/26/ap/national/main20057685.shtml" target="_blank" _mce_href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/04/26/ap/national/main20057685.shtml">Congressional Republicans go home to mixed reviews</a>, CBS News.com</li>
<p>
<li>Any voucher system for health care will inevitably fail to cover increasing health care costs, resulting in rationing even the most basic health care by socio-economic class&#8211;the very problem that Medicare, Medicaid, and the limited health care reforms undertaken by the last Congress were intended to address. The Center for Budget and Policy Priorities concluded that <a href="http://www.cbpp.org/cms/index.cfm?fa=view&#038;id=3473">out-of-pocket medical costs would skyrocket for low-income seniors</a>; the Washington Post&#8217;s Fact Checker Glenn Kessler (in <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/post/gop-lawmakers-tout-medicare-reform-by-stretching-a-comparison-to-the-health-benefits-they-receive/2011/04/28/AFrRkM9E_blog.html">GOP Lawmakers tout Medicare reform by stretching a comparison to the health benefits they receive</a>, Apr. 29, 2011) notes that the CBO analysis concluded that the Ryan Medicare system would pay only 32% of health care costs by 2030, compared to 70-75% if traditional Medicare remained in place.</li>
<p>
<li>Addressing the problems in the U.S. health care system solely by market means that put the onus on health care recipients to seek cost-savings has failed miserably over the last forty years and cannot help but fail more spectacularly when the Medicaid backup is weakened and the nature of health care needs is such that one of the best antidotes to market problems (the only one permitted in radical market thinking that objects to regulatory safeguards)&#8211;informed consumers who can review options and select among competing providers&#8211;is simply not applicable. Car accident victims don&#8217;t shop for surgeons; cancer victims don&#8217;t know enough to select based on price; etc.</li>
<li>The Ryan proposal appears one-sided in its decision to cut spending on potentially vulnerable populations rather than to address the means through which health care is provided or to consider ways to control profit-taking in the health care system. The market ideology of the proposers leaves many options that might work better off the table (single payer; tax on excessive compensation; revamping the non-profit hospital system; attaching strings to the R&#038;D and other tax expenditures in the tax code; using the clout of a national system to negotiate better doctor and drug pricing for Medicare and Medicaid, etc.);</li>
<li>Many of those states that would acquire more control over the use of Medicaid funds are controlled now, as is the House, by people who have announced their intent to cut taxes on the wealthy and business while cutting or taxing pensions and health benefits for public employees and cutting funds available for Medicaid and other poverty-directed programs; it is not a difficult leap to see the interrelationship of these trends;</li>
<li>Plans to cut benefits for those who may enjoy them in the future pave the way in at least two ways for decisions shortly thereafter to cut benefits for those who currently enjoy them: first, by creating lowered expectations; second, by creating an unfair disparity that supports an &#8220;us against them&#8221; attitude between the current elderly and those who will get lesser benefits in the future. (Note that this resembles the way the right has encouraged an &#8220;us against them&#8221; attitude of <em>private workers</em>, who have been deprived of union benefits through the harsh anti-union tactics used by Big Business, against <em>public employees</em>, who have generally benefited in the past from more reasonable attitudes towards unions fostered in legislative bodies that have, in the past, understood the nature of the bargain that public employees make (which might be summarized as &#8216;work hard, get paid less than you could in the private sector, and accept later benefits in pensions and health care for lesser salary/percs now).</li>
</ul>
<p>
<p>Is is surprising that left-leaning activist groups like Move-On point to the Ryan budget proposal as a &#8220;naked, unapologetic attack on working Americans for the sake of Big Insurance and the riches of the rich&#8221; (quote from Move-On email on this matter)?</p>
