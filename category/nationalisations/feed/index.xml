				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After my <a target="_blank" href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/05/banks-just-dont-go-under.html">previous</a> <a target="_blank" href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/06/noted-for-record-failed-bank-edition.html">posts</a> on <a target="_blank" href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/03/georgia-is-1-citigroup-is-worse-than.html">Georgia</a>, it seems only fair to note the bank closings in Illinois today.</p>
<p>There have been 13 bank closings posted (as of right now, about 6:50pm) in the state of Illinois since last March.  That alone is significant—but, even more interesting, <strong>six</strong> of them occurred today.  This exceeds the previous record for a state, Georgia&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/06/noted-for-record-failed-bank-edition.html">five</a> last week.</p>
<p>Three (in Elizabeth, Oregon, and Danville) are in the NW part of the state.  The other three are located near Chicago (Worth, in Cook County), Urbana (Clinton), and Springfield (Winchester).</p>
<p>Only two of those cities (Worth and Danville) are in the Top 200 cities by size in the state, so it&#8217;s difficult not to suspect that their location had a lot to do with the closing of at least four of the banks.</p>
<p>Again, the same as the Georgia question, why Illinois? And, most especially, given the past two weeks, why are there multiple state closings now?</p>
