<p>This will soon be the new look for Angry Bear, and a switch to the wordpress platform from blogger will add considerably to functions.  Our advertisements are also missing.  The side bar functions will soon be completed (not in picture), and include a blogroll and archives. </p>
<p>The top category bar functions can be used to separate out posts from each other for reader convenience, and are color coded. An example of a hot topic can be the current writing stemming from Newtown, Ct. news and related data for the issue, which is not strictly economic in nature but well worth discussing.  The category Politics might be used to address the more political in the term political &#8216;economics&#8217;.</p>
<p>More to come.</p>

<p>Sometime later in the next month Angry Bear will have a new look to offer to readers as we switch from Blogger platform to the more versatile <i>WordPress</i> platform.  I hope to be posting with quick looks at different aspects of our redesign and explain new features that will be offered to our readers who want to take better advantage of the information Angry Bear contributors bring to the debate and discussion of economics, recommended policy and impacts,  and of course some of the political debate that is part and parcel of &#8216;political economics&#8217;.</p>
<p>The look will be more modern and cleaner to look at.  More functions to access more information from posts will be a part of the design.  But further work is needed before I elaborate.</p>
<p>More details to come next week.</p>
<p>Dan</p>
