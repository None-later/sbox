<p>The story notes that the video photographer, Marine Staff Sgt. Bill Genaust, who shot the footage, died at Iwo Jima.  </p>

                                <p>
<div dir="ltr">Yesterday, both sides drew their battle lines in the coming war over the minimum wage. After Obama called for a minimum wage hike in his State of the Union speech, House Republicans dug in against it, casting their opposition as grounded in concern for the plight of low wage workers. John Boehner <a href="http://livewire.talkingpointsmemo.com/entry/boehner-shoots-down-obamas-minimum-wage-hike">asked</a>: “Why would we want to make it harder for small employers to hire people?”</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">&#8212; <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2013/02/14/the-morning-plum-dems-to-use-minimum-wage-against-gop-in-2014/">Dems to use minimum wage against GOP in 2014</a>, Greg Sargent, Washington Post, this morning</div>
<p>To me, one of the great frustrations in Obama’s failure during most of his first term to communicate, effectively or at all, the basic premises of Keynesian and other liberal economics-related arguments (including on healthcare) was his apparent resistance to mentioning&#8211;early, often, or ever&#8211;specific other countries’ successes or failures that illustrate the point. </p>
<p>But there’s no time like the present for him and the congressional Dems to start to do do this, by maybe mentioning these facts: that Australia’s minimum wage is $15 U.S. and that its unemployment rate is 5.4%, and that the United States has (surprise!) the largest gap between the minimum wage and the median wage of any advanced economy in the world.</p>
<p>I learned those facts yesterday when I read Washington Post columnist <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/matt-miller-raise-the-minimum-wage/2013/02/06/34857264-7066-11e2-8b8d-e0b59a1b8e2a_story.html">Matthew Miller’s Feb. 6 column</a>.  He mentioned it and linked to it in <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/matt-miller-obamas-hollow-speech/2013/02/13/d928c944-75a5-11e2-95e4-6148e45d7adb_story.html">his column yesterday</a> about Obama’s State of the Union address.  In yesterday’s column, he suggested seemingly, facetiously, that it was his February 6 column that had persuaded Obama to include a minimum-wage-hike proposal in his address.  But after reading the earlier column, I suspect that it was not only what convinced Obama to make the call but also was what caused Obama to even think of it.  </p>
<p>Both of Miller’s columns say that the $9/hr. figure that Obama proposed in his speech would still leave the minimum wage at $1.68 below what the value of the minimum wage was in 1968.  The first column, Miller also mentions that several CEOs of large corporations support a rise in the minimum wage and that a prominent conservative, the editor of American Conservative magazine, suggests raising the minimum wage to $12/hr.  Of course, the Republicans will showcase their own CEOs, and some small-business owners, to support their own position.</p>
<p>Which is where Australia comes in.  Or at least where invoking it should come in. The special beauty of using Australia as an example&#8211;whether in support of an increase in the minimum wage or in refuting the Obamacare-is-socialism/makers-vs.-takers mantra&#8211;is that few Americans associate Australia with, um, socialism.  They associate it instead with free-enterprise economics and a high standard of living.  And soon, hopefully, also with a higher minimum wage that corresponds to a low unemployment rate.  </p>
<p>Maybe Marco Rubio and John Boehner could get a travel discount <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2013/02/marco-rubio-needs-to-travel-more.html">if they booked their reservations</a> together. </p>

                                <p>
<div dir="ltr">The State of the Union ritual is by now familiar to most Americans. President Obama leads the Democratic side of the chamber to a series of standing ovations for proposals that everybody knows won’t become law. Republicans show their seriousness of purpose by smirking or making stony faces — and by inviting as guests to the speech people such as <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/reliable-source/post/ted-nugent-attending-state-of-the-union-address/2013/02/11/2b868238-749f-11e2-95e4-6148e45d7adb_blog.html">rocker Ted Nugent</a>, who has called the president a “piece of [excrement]” who should “suck on my machine gun.”</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">But this spectacle, unlike [Mardi Gras], is not all harmless fun. Obama made clear that he is not entertaining serious spending cuts or major entitlement reforms. Republicans, in their responses, repeated that they are not budging on taxes. The hard choices will have to wait for another day.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">The standoff gives new meaning to Fat Tuesday: The nation’s finances are a mess, but — what the heck? — let’s have another round. No wonder a new Washington Post poll found that <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2013/02/12/obama-faces-deeply-divided-nation-in-state-of-the-union-address/">56 percent of Americans</a> have a dim view of the country’s political system.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">&#8212; <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/dana-milbank-state-of-the-union-and-mardi-gras--what-a-coincidence/2013/02/12/105119ee-7560-11e2-aa12-e6cf1d31106b_story.html?hpid=z2">Let the bleak times roll</a>, Dana Milbank, Washington Post, today</div>
<p>Yup.  Fifty-six percent of Americans want another deep recession.  Now!  Our nation’s finances are a mess.  And they want to see them become messier!  And they want a few million hungry or homeless elderly. Not necessarily now.  But soon.</p>
<p>The luxury of being a Centrist, at least one of this particular and common variety, is that you can spout generic truisms without ever actually tying them to specifics.  Much less to basic economics principles. Milbank’s column is so replete with unsupported and in fact completely unexplained inferences&#8211;declaratory clauses and sentences each made in its own little vacuum but offered as though dependent upon one another&#8211;that Milbank’s heard somewhere, that I wondered as I read this thing whether he’d brought his MacBook Air to a <a href="http://www.uline.com/Grp_316/Plastic-Retail-Food-Bags?pricode=WL25&#038;gclid=CPSNs8rBs7UCFZE-MgodmS8Axw">Uline</a> plant to watch the speech last night. I mean, how else to explain this?:</p>
<div dir="ltr">Early in his address, Obama pronounced himself “more than halfway towards the goal of $4 trillion in deficit reduction that economists say we need to stabilize our finances.” He blithely proclaimed that the rest of the job could be done by making “modest reforms” to Medicare and “getting rid of tax loopholes and deductions for the well-off.”</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">He didn’t mention that this would leave the country with a historically high debt level — and would be but a temporary fix before health-care costs explode in a decade. Departing from his prepared text, Obama challenged the idea that “deficit reduction is a big emergency, justifying making cuts in Social Security.” </div>
<p>Oh, horrors. After all, deficit reduction is a big emergency. And a historically high debt level&#8211;irrespective of the specifics, such as how high that debt level is relative to GDP&#8211;will crash the economy.  Just like the historically high debt levels did at the end of World War II. </p>
<p>“Washington’s version of Mardi Gras had begun early in the day, at the Capitol South Metro station, where members of a nonpartisan balanced-budget group, Bankrupting America, offered beads to passersby willing to ‘show us your cuts,’” Milbank writes. “By that standard, few necklaces would be distributed. Democrats and Republicans alike would sooner bare their private parts than come clean about what government programs they would cut.”  True enough.</p>
<p>But then, this:</p>
<div dir="ltr">Even [Paul] Ryan, who is drafting a budget that could slash domestic discretionary spending by 40 percent over a decade, doesn’t like to be specific. </div>
<p>Even Paul Ryan doesn’t like to be specific about cuts that would slash domestic spending by 40 percent over decade?  Even Paul Ryan?  You don’t say!</p>
<p>And then, of course:</p>
<div dir="ltr">And House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi says, “<a href="http://foxnewsinsider.com/2013/02/10/nancy-pelosi-says-the-spending-problem-is-a-false-argument/">It is almost a false argument to say we have a spending problem</a>.”</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">Pelosi’s formulation is just as reckless as the Republicans’ mantra: “We don’t have a revenue problem; we have a spending problem.”</div>
<p>Of course. Which is why, pre-Bush-tax-cuts, and pre-Bush-unfunded-wars, we didn’t have a spending problem. Now we do, so let’s cut Social Security!  Canada, Germany, Australia and Holland must also have spending problems.  After all, they have extensive social safety-net programs, and high standards of living.</p>
<p>Milbank ends by saying, “In reality, we eventually need both spending cuts and tax increases — and lots of them. But sacrifice will have to wait. In Washington, they’re still partying like there’s no tomorrow.”</p>
<p>No, actually, the Democrats are partying like there is a tomorrow.  There&#8217;s real, if unwitting, irony in the headline writer&#8217;s choice of a heading for Milbank&#8217;s column.  Although&#8211;who knows?&#8211;maybe the headline writer actually is familiar with Keynesian economics. </p>

                                <p>
<div dir="ltr">And the plain fact is that Obama has <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/02/05/remarks-president">reiterated</a> that the same spending and entitlement cuts he offered in 2011 are still on the table, even irking his own base in the process.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">&#8212; Greg Sargent, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2013/02/07/the-morning-plum-gop-resolve-on-sequester-begins-to-crack/">this morning</a></div>
<p>That really surprised me, so I clicked the link Sargent offers, which turns out to be to a transcript of Obama’s Tues. press conference. Here’s what I think Sargent is referring to, although Obama’s comments pretty clearly referred to his Dec. 2012 fiscal-cliff-crisis offer, not his debt-ceiling-crisis Aug. 2011 offer:</p>
<div dir="ltr">The proposals that I put forward during the fiscal cliff negotiations in discussions with Speaker Boehner and others are still very much on the table.  I just want to repeat:  The deals that I put forward, the balanced approach of spending cuts and entitlement reform and tax reform that I put forward are still on the table.   </div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">I’ve offered sensible reforms to Medicare and other entitlements, and my health care proposals achieve the same amount of savings by the beginning of the next decade as the reforms that have been proposed by the bipartisan Bowles-Simpson fiscal commission. </div>
<p>In <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2013/02/07/dems-will-offer-gop-spending-cuts-to-avert-doom/">an update</a> this afternoon, Sargent says Dem Senate leadership is willing to propose further spending cuts in exchange for the closing of the most outrageous oil-and-gas-industry, other corporate, and hedge-fund-manager tax loopholes.  But I think it’s a safe bet that the Senate Dem leaders are not considering anything similar to Obama’s panicky Aug. 2011 offer.  </p>
<p>But even though what appears to be at issue is Obama’s Dec. 2012 offers, not his Aug. 2011 offer, he needs to confer with Senate Dem leaders.  He may have Stockholm Syndrome, but they don’t.  Is he really planning to offer the Repubs something that would not receive 50 Dem Senate votes?  Especially when all he really has to do is bring a couple of easy-to-understand pie charts with him to his State of the Union address, and illustrate something that most Americans do not know: that as part of that Aug. 2011 Republican hostage-taking, he and the Senate Dems agreed to huge spending cuts, with no offsetting tax increases on anyone? </p>
<p>Good heavens.  I do realize that pie charts aren’t as theatrical as real-Americans-as-props-sitting-in-the-audience.  But they’re really easy to invite.  </p>
<p>And they don’t even need a security check. </p>

                                <p>
<div dir="ltr">When it comes to the most important economic challenges facing the nation, President Obama offers soaring rhetoric. He campaigned vigorously against the decline of the middle class. He launched his new term this past week with a speech declaring widespread prosperity to be a deeply American virtue — and a threatened one.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">“We are true to our creed when a little girl born into the bleakest poverty knows that she has the same chance to succeed as anybody else,” Obama said in <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/president-obamas-second-inaugural-address-transcript/2013/01/21/f148d234-63d6-11e2-85f5-a8a9228e55e7_story.html">his second inaugural address</a>, “because she is an American; she is free, and she is equal, not just in the eyes of God but also in our own.”</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">Then he talked a little about tax reform.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">Of course, cleaning up and simplifying a complicated tax code is important. But it is not, by any stretch of the imagination, a cure for widening inequality and declining economic mobility. This is the problem with the president’s approach to America’s big economic problems: His rhetoric seems way ahead of his policy proposals.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">There are several reasons for that, including the complexity of the challenges at hand, the polarized political climate and the difficulty of crafting comprehensive solutions (let alone poll-tested ones). But the simplest explanation is that Obama’s economic team is built to tackle a totally different set of issues than the ones the president loves to talk about. It is built largely to address the problems of the federal budget deficit.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">&#8212; <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/obama-wants-to-tackle-poverty-and-inequality-so-why-is-his-economic-team-so-focused-on-the-deficit/2013/01/25/d6b03482-667c-11e2-93e1-475791032daf_print.html">Obama wants to tackle poverty and inequality. So why is his economic team so focused on the deficit?</a>, Jim Tankersley, Washington Post, Jan. 25</div>
<p>One of my great disappointments, and a cause of utter dismay at times, of Obama’s first term was his near-total failure to bring into his administration really brilliant academics, and (apparently) to actually listen to the ones he did bring in.  I remember back in early 2009 how happy I was that Obama was going to pursue major healthcare insurance reform, right at the outset, and I assumed that he would enlist the assistance of two or three of the most prominent academics who had extensive background related to healthcare financing.  Which, in my opinion, meant, first and foremost, <a href="http://wws.princeton.edu/people/display_person.xml?netid=reinhard&#038;display=core">Uwe Reinhardt</a>, the James Madison Professor of Political Economy at Princeton’s Economics and Public Affairs departments.  </p>
<p>I sort of had this vision of Reinhardt and <a href="http://www.gailwilensky.com/">Gail Wilensky</a>, the moderate Republican healthcare economist who had served as George H. W. Bush’s Medicare director, joining together at Obama’s request to draft a potential healthcare insurance bill. </p>
<p>Instead, of course, Obama left it up to Max Baucus and a few other members of Congress to draft a bill from scratch, and then failed to aggressively explain its contents and refute the massive campaign of disinformation about it.  Sort of like his method of handling the stimulus legislation. Thus, the 2010 election results. </p>
<p>But healthcare costs and related issues are deeply entwined with economic and labor issues, and Reinhardt’s expertise is not limited to healthcare costs and delivery. He is not per se a labor economist, but he is per se brilliant and possessed of the ability to explain complex facts to the economics-and-healthcare-finance-challenged crowd.  (Trust me on this.) </p>
<p>A huge difference between now and any time during the past four years is that, finally, suddenly, some mainstream journalists and pundits are joining Paul Krugman in awakening to the facts highlighted in the above indented excerpt by Jim Tankersley.  In mainstream print journalism, it may still be just the editorial writers at the New York Times and economics correspondents at the Washington Post, but I’m betting that it’s about to gain real steam.  </p>
<p>The Times editorial I’m referring to <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/obama-wants-to-tackle-poverty-and-inequality-so-why-is-his-economic-team-so-focused-on-the-deficit/2013/01/25/d6b03482-667c-11e2-93e1-475791032daf_print.html">is in today’s paper</a>, and argues:</p>
<div dir="ltr">In recent years, the administration and Congress have been consumed with deficit reduction, which is antithetical to job creation because it curbs government spending when the economy is weak. Unless Mr. Obama can shift policy away from premature austerity and toward ways to bolster demand and foster investment, job growth will remain sluggish and unemployment high.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">What has been missing for years is a forceful labor agenda — one that calls for more jobs, but also has as its goal rising wages coupled with robust hiring.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">Mr. Obama can take an important step in that direction by placing his next labor secretary at the center of his economic team. The first-term labor secretary, Hilda Solis, was largely sidelined, a reflection of the administration’s focus on the recovery of Wall Street, not Main Street. Some of the names that have been floated for the job — including Jennifer Granholm, the former governor of Michigan — show that Mr. Obama is seeking someone of high stature, but any secretary’s ability to be a transformative force will depend on the president’s support.</div>
<p>I agree that if Obama limits his options for this post to past or present politicians and people already, or recently, in government, then Granholm is an excellent choice.  But I think it’s past time now for him to look elsewhere, to academia, to fill a post that has the potential to make a defining contribution to critical economic and labor policy.  </p>
<p>I fear, of course, that Reinhardt is the wrong gender.  Obama needs to place women in prominent positions in his administration, after all.  And there may well be a terrific labor economist who is female; I wouldn’t know.  But even more than placing women in prominent positions in his administration, he needs to place someone with a deep understanding of national and international labor and economics dynamics in a position of real influence and public exposure.</p>

<div dir="ltr">* Don’t forget about the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/04/opinion/krugman-friends-of-fraud.html?hp&#038;_r=0">Paul Krugman</a> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/04/opinion/krugman-friends-of-fraud.html?hp&#038;_r=0">has the goods on a story that’s getting far too little attention</a>: In filibustering Richard Cordray, Obama’s choice to head the consumer protection bureau, and demanding major changes to the agency, Republicans are trying to transform it into something that’s essentially unable to carry out its mission.</div>
<div dir="ltr">How can the G.O.P. be so determined to make America safe for financial fraud, with the 2008 crisis still so fresh in our memory? In part it’s because Republicans are deep in denial about what actually happened to our financial system and economy. [&#8230;] Just four years after runaway bankers brought the world economy to its knees, Senate Republicans are using every means at their disposal, violating all the usual norms of politics in the process, in an attempt to give the bankers a chance to do it all over again.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">Krugman notes that Cordray has drawn praise even from the bankers, which I’ve seen elsewhere, too. So: Do the financial institutions even favor what the GOP is up to here? </div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">Worth some more reporting, I’d say.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">&#8212; Greg Sargent, Washington Post, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2013/02/04/the-morning-plum-the-problem-with-the-obama-skeet-shooting-controversy/">today</a></div>
<p>One of the most dismaying and frustrating of Obama’s first-term communication failures was, for me, his utter absence of any real attempt to apprise the public of the existence of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, what its mandate is, and that (and how) the congressional Republicans have concertedly tried to undermine it, via Senate filibuster of any nominee&#8211;not just, first Elizabeth Warren, and then Richard Cordray, but, by their own admission, any nominee&#8211;to head this bureau, and by attempts to fail to appropriate operating funds for it. </p>
<p>Eight days from now, in his State of the Union address, Obama will have a terrific opportunity to educate the public about all this.  All this.  By which I mean: Not just a clause or a sentence near the end of the speech, alluding to it in listing this, that, and the other thing, but instead an actual explanation of it and of the undermining of it by the Repubs. Near the opening of the speech, before viewers click to whatever because they, like me, want to avoid gagging at the extremely tired James Baker’s great-idea-for-staging-at-Reagan’s-State-of-the-Union-addresses-and-used-by-every-president-sinnce-then real-Americans-as-props thing. (Talking about a program to help oil-company workers? Cue two oil-company workers flanking the First Lady, sitting in the first row. You know what I’m talking about.  Ad nauseum.)  </p>
<p>But since the invites of real Americans surely have already been sent out, and there’s no stopping that juggernaut anyway, however more eyes it causes to roll each year, I suggest the addition of some real Americans who already have benefited from the Bureau’s actions.  </p>
<p>I also, by the way, suggest the addition of a real American or two who, because of the provision in Dodd-Frank&#8211;or maybe it was a separate statute, all its own, effective in August 2011 but enacted in 2010 by a Dem-controlled Senate and Dem-controlled House; I’m not sure&#8211;that ended what millions of Americans fondly came to call the $400 Starbucks/McDonalds/Dunkin’Donuts coffee/sandwich/dessert, the result of inadvertent, momentary checking-account overdrafts when the mortgage payment, the doctor’s co-pay, and payment for the brake job the SUV all just by chance happened to post to your checking account moments before you swiped that ATM/credit/debit card at the Starbuck, McDonald’s or Dunkin’ Donuts.  I’ll nominate myself for an invite on that one, even though I’ve never actually owned an SUV and don’t like them much.  </p>
<p>No, <i>that</i> doesn’t involve something that changed the state of the union this past year.  But it’s long past time for our Dem politicians to start pointing out things of exactly this sort, and to ask what exactly the congressional Republicans have done along those lines since Jan. 2011. And to start educating the public about what the specifics of what they’ve done to undermine protections against financial-industry abuse, whether legal or illegal.</p>
<p>Stories that will continue to get far too little attention as long as Obama allows them to.  Or until maybe Prof. Krugman becomes President Krugman&#8211;which sounds like a plan, to me!
<div></div>
<div>&#8212;-<br />UPDATE: Oh, dear.  Turns out that Mitt Romney isn’t the only one who wasn’t familiar with the pre-Aug. 2011 $400 McDonald’s sandwich paid for (many times over) with ATM card payment charges (a.k.a., multiple overdraft fees within a period of 30 seconds.)  Regular reader coberly wasn’t either.  So he and I just exchanged the following comments in the Comments thread:</p>
<p> cobery: 
<div dir="ltr">Beverly</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">You did not exactly take advantage of your own opportunity to explain the Starbucks $400 dessert, but I can guess.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">Back when it might have been a problem for me, I kept track of the checks I wrote and did not write them for any more than I had in the bank. I think this prevented even &#8220;inadvertent&#8221; overdrafts.</div>
<p> Me: 
<div dir="ltr">Ah. Actually, I just threw that in there to be funny.  Or to try to be. (It&#8217;s not really a funny subject, so maybe I shouldn&#8217;t have tried.)  But unless you keep a lot of cash in your checking account or tie it automatically to a savings account, or were extremely careful to keep track of your checking account&#8211;and a lot of people have more than one checking account&#8211;you would, before that law came into effect in 2011, have to keep enough money in your account to include an  overdraft fee of $36 (or whatever) each for a single inadvertent overdraft, or you would find yourself charged repeated overdraft fees in a single day for every charge that came in until you realized you were overdrawn.  </div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">The new law applies only to debit/credit card/ATM transactions, not to actual checks, so you still have to be careful about checks, especially since you can&#8217;t be sure when they&#8217;ll be cashed. </div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">It also helps if you can add and subtract, I’ve learned the hard way.  One of my tax-law profs. used to say that his wife was always the one to actually do their income tax returns. The guy was friggin’ brilliant in discussing legal theory and tax strategy&#8211;best as I could tell, anyway&#8211;but swore that he couldn’t do actual math, or even competently use a calculator, worth a damn.  Makes me feel better when I recall that. (Calculators sorta throw me off, too, since I can’t figure out what all those funny-looking math symbols are.  Like the + and &#8211; signs.)</div>
<p>Back in the pre-Dodd-Frank days, there were looooads of stories on the web and elsewhere about this kind of thing.  So I assumed everyone was familiar with the issue.  Not so, though. So I thought I’d add this explanation. </div>

                                <p>
<div dir="ltr">Politico’s Glenn Thrush <a href="http://www.politico.com/politico44/2013/01/obamas-gdp-nightmare-155645.html?hp=l4">reports this morning</a> that Republicans believe the GDP report showing the economy is shrinking gives them political “leverage” over Obama, since bad economic news is terrible for the President. But Thrush notes that this shouldn’t be the case, since the contraction was the result of spending cuts, which in theory should undermine the GOP argument that we should cut spending as deeply as possible:</div>
<div dir="ltr">The fact that the shock this time came from a plunge in defense/federal spending should, in theory, bolster Obama’s contention that budget-cutting and trimming entitlement spending is the worst thing for the economy right now. It should, in a more Spock-like world, be an argument against the sequester cuts and big changes to Medicare and Social Security. </div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">Forget about that.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">All nuance is lost in the howling gale of an economic “contraction” — and the advantage, at least in the current news cycle, shifts to a down-in-mouth GOP. It’s not likely to be a major shift in the dynamics of looming fiscal fights, but Republicans, in the words of one senior Hill staffer I spoke to this morning, “will take any leverage we can get.”</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">Thrush very well be right that people won’t take the right message from the contraction. But in a rational world, what should be glaringly obvious is that the belief that this gives the party “leverage” highlights how absurdly incoherent the GOP message about the economy has become. (Read S<a href="http://maddowblog.msnbc.com/_news/2013/01/31/16789587-diagnosing-the-gdp-problem?lite">teve Benen for all the other problems here</a>.)</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">The economic contraction was driven largely by a steep drop in defense spending. As <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/01/30/government-is-hurting-the-economy-by-spending-too-little/?wprss=rss_business">Ezra Klein details</a>, this shows that “government is hurting the recovery” by “spending and investing too little.” As Ezra notes, “government spending and investment have, at all levels, been contractionary since 2010.”</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">Yet Republicans are responding to the news of the economic contraction by suggesting invalidates their view that we need to further cut spending to help the economy. Hence their claimed “leverage” in the coming battle over the sequestered cuts, half of which is to defense spending. Republicans are actively using the sequester to force Dems to agree to avert it by offsetting it entirely with other deep cuts to social programs, and no new revenues from the wealthy. In response to the contraction, John Boehner <a href="https://twitter.com/johnboehner/status/296647347096674304">tweeted out this hashtag</a>:</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">#spendingistheproblem</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">In other words, the contraction confirms that we need more spending cuts.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">&#8212; <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2013/01/31/we-all-agree-that-spending-cuts-hurt-the-economy-right-right/">We all agree that spending cuts hurt the economy. Right? Right.</a>, Greg Saregent, Washington Post, today</div>
<p>Okay, look.  If Obama doesn’t now, finally, explain Keynesian economics to the general public, using actual facts&#8211;such as the reason for the economic contraction&#8211;and point out that Boehner &#038; Co. either are ignorant of the facts or are willing to deliberately misinform the public about such a critically important matter, then he should resign and let Joe Biden explain it as president.  </p>
<p>I mean it. </p>
<p>Obama did a stellar job a week before his inaugural address explaining the debt ceiling law and what “raising the debt ceiling” means&#8211;and that ti does not mean what the Republicans’ campaign of disinformation was saying it means.  He should do the same now, on this.  </p>
<p>Presumably, he’ll enlist as his chief speechwriter for his State of the Union address a speechwriter who understands how to easily explain Keynesian economics and the current “contraction” statistics.  But, just as with his inaugural address, he should not wait until that speech to expose the Republican game plan for what it is: a concerted campaign to misinform the public about critical facts, knowing that the public will not know the accurate specifics, and aware that&#8211;as Thrush says, outright&#8211;the mainstream press will not sufficiently (or at all) apprise the public of those fact.  </p>
<p>In other words: that Romneyism&#8211;the flagrant lying, con artistry, as the chief modus operandi&#8211;is now at the very heart of what the Republican Party is.</p>
<p>The public did catch on to Romney by the fall.  And, thanks largely to Obama’s statements at his press conference on Jan. 14 abou the debt ceiling, they caught on to that, as well.  And if Obama makes an effort to explain to the public basic Keynesian economics, and cites actual facts, actual statistics, about the fourth-quarter contraction, they’ll catch on this time, too.  And, maybe, finally, to the fact that the Republicans have decided upon a strategy of fraud in order to disassemble the social safety network, including Social Security and Medicare.  </p>
<p>In his State of the Union address, he’ll have an opportunity to finally educate the public about the actual causes of the Greek meltdown, of the actual effect of Tory austerity in Britain, of the actual cause of economic near-collapse in Spain, in Italy, in Ireland, in Iceland&#8211;and of the actual effect of the safety net in Germany, in Holland, and elsewhere.  And maybe he’ll even take that opportunity.  But the State of the Union address is two weeks away.  And in responding to Boehner’s tweet at #spendingistheproblem, there’s no time like the present.  Or at least like the next few days.  Just as with the fiscal cliff and the debt ceiling, the Republicans’ political leverage, whether real or fanciful, will turn out to be ephemeral.  </p>
<p>Unless Obama remains mute.

<div>UPDATE: Wow.  Either Greg Sargent is channeling me, or I’m channeling him.  He posted <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2013/01/31/make-strong-case-that-spending-cuts-hurt-economy-mr-president/">this</a> one minute after I posted my post on AB. </div>
<p>But as I say in my post, Obama shouldn’t wait the two weeks until the State of the Union address to begin making the point.  Just as he didn’t wait a week until his inaugural address to explain to the public what “raising the debt ceiling” actually means&#8211;thus pulling the rug out from under Repubs’ disinformation campaign telling the public that it means increasing spending appropriations.  </p>
<p>Sargent titles his post “Make strong case that spending cuts hurt economy, Mr. President!”  (Amen.)  He points out: that</p>
<div dir="ltr">Unfortunately, at times, Obama has diluted this message. During his 2010 State of the Union speech, for instance, the President proposed a temporary spending freeze, and said:</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">“Families across the country are tightening their belts and making tough decisions. The federal government should do the same.”</div>
<div dir="ltr">  </div>
<p>But I think it’s a mischaracterization to describe that as a dilution of the Keynesian message.  It’s actually an outright misrepresentation of economic fact; that’s why that statement has been so detrimental.  And, if necessary, Obama should expressly acknowledge that this was misleading about economic fact, and then explain exactly why. </p>

                                <p>I’ve spent yesterday and this morning saying here that I suspect that Geithner played some role in persuading Obama himself to decide that the Justice Dept. should not do much to investigate whether there was criminal conduct by top execs at the big banks, the big investment banks, and the big mortgage companies&#8211;but also <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2013/01/lanny-breuer-and-mary-jo-white-or-is-it.html">saying</a>, this morning, that if so, I think it was because of a legitimate belief that pursuing past criminality as criminality rather than through civil cases alone, would undermine those institutions’ solvency and thus the larger economy.  </p>
<p>It’s a believe that, at least regarding such big-name mortgage firms like Countrywide and its CEO, and in my opinion, against big-name execs of the banking institutions, makes no sense. Which does suggest some direct culpability by the Justice Dept., although it doesn’t answer the question of Geithner’s role, if any.</p>
<p>But <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/tim-geithners-legacy-an-unpopular-bailout-that-helped-save-the-economy/2013/01/24/f1bf4fb6-64af-11e2-85f5-a8a9228e55e7_print.html">a lengthy article</a> about Geithner in today’s Washington Post by Zachary Goldfarb does make the point that Geithner apparently has been a strong proponent of tough new laws and regulations regarding the finance and securities industries, and, presumably, tough enforcement of the laws and regulations, old and new, going forward.  At least that’s what the article says.  </p>
<p>Which makes the separate, if inferential, point, that, regarding the Obama administration and (I suspect) regarding Geithner, there are two distinct issues: what was to be done about the past, and what is to be done in, and about, the future. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m shooting for this to be my final word on all this.  So that I won&#8217;t keep shooting myself (and my reputation as a stellar financial-industry expert) in the foot.</p>

                                <p>Oh, dear.  I like Ezra Klein. A lot.  So I’ll leave out the sarcasm&#8211;a necessity anyway, since I’ve already exhausted <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2013/01/does-david-brooks-really-think-student.html">this week’s</a> <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2013/01/he-asked-not-what-his-country-can-do.html">supply</a>. </p>
<p>But I do want to point out, because he’s so influential now, that <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/01/22/reminder-big-presidential-speeches-mostly-dont-matter/">Klein’s piece yesterday</a> siding with those who thought Obama’s speech Monday should not have set forth liberal policy positions in so in-your-face a manner, and should not have called the Republicans on their conservative ones, seems, best as I can tell, to conflate two distinct points.  More important, it fails to recognize that the events of the last week concerning the debt-ceiling issue prove one of those points wrong. </p>
<p>Klein argues, weirdly, in my opinion, that the presidential bully pulpit is not very effective, because most people don’t watch presidential speeches.  And it’s certainly true that, in the current era, most people don’t watch presidential speeches.  They may see short clips from it on the TV news, or see headlines about it in a newspaper or online, but even if they see the speech itself, it won’t change many people’s minds; almost everyone already has made up their mind about the subjects addressed in the speech.  And, by making an ideological speech, Obama made it less likely that the congressional Republicans will cooperate with him at all&#8211;a presumption disproved by <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/house-republicans-plant-to-keep-debt-limit-but-suspend-it-until-may/2013/01/22/14bc4f3e-64ae-11e2-85f5-a8a9228e55e7_print.html">this morning’s headlines</a> confirming what already had been reported yesterday as likely.</p>
<p>O, brotherhood, where art thou?  Thou art back in the first nearly-four years of Obama’s first term, in which he failed even to publicly correct patent disinformation by the Republicans, such as about what the debt ceiling is and what “raising it means&#8211;and doesn’t mean. </p>
<p>Klein’s right that the speech itself probably didn’t change any minds.  He’s wrong, though, that it was intended to do that.  It was an inaugural speech, not, say, a highly publicized press conference at which he finally educates the public about such things as the debt ceiling statute and thus demonstrates to the Republicans that the success of that particular bit of their disinformation campaign is at an end.  </p>
<p>I can’t understand why <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2013/01/what-dana-milbanks-stunningly-awful.html">so many political pundits</a>&#8211;and why Obama himself, for so long&#8211;have found it so hard to grasp the difference between political rhetoric and clear statements of actual fact and refutations of misrepresentations of fact.  </p>
<p>And, if it’s true that the presidential (and presidential-candidate) bully pulpit has little effect in educating and persuading, then why have presidential campaigns, at all?  In fact, this last one was quite effective in deconstructing critical disinformation by Romney, Ryan, and the “conservative movement,” wasn’t it? </p>
<p>Klein’s piece was titled, “Reminder: Big presidential speeches (mostly) don’t matter.”  True, when the speech is just rhetoric rather than an invocation of actual fact.  Or when the speech is not intended to throw down an ideological gauntlet, as this one was.  And did. </p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>I’m a political junkie, born and bred.  And so the number of political opinion pieces I’ve read in my life, dating back to my teenage years (me being a child of my parents, they of the ardent liberal Democrat variety&#8211; “Oh, no, Bevy!  You have to return that purse.  That company is anti-union!”  “Okayyy, Mom.”)&#8211;run probably into the thousands.  (Yikes.)  </p>
<p>And I’ve certainly read, ah-hem, a few pieces by established, mainstream columnists in respected newspapers and magazines that have made my eyes roll or made me shake my head in dismay because of some obvious flaw in logic or some clearly false representation of fact upon which the writer’s premise lies.  </p>
<p>But I don’t think I’ve ever before read such a mystifyingly wacky, whiplash-inducing, incomprehensibly-false-fact-based commentary as <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/22/opinion/brooks-the-collective-turn.html?_r=0">the one I just read</a>, by David Brooks, in today&#8217;s New York Times.  The premise: That Obama’s argument for returning the federal government’s domestic-policy emphasis to trying to increase economic and social mobility, improving public infrastructure, encouraging individual creativity, inventiveness and risk-taking, and trying to help limit climate change, Obama was arguing for … you guessed it! (at least if you read Brooks’s columns even occasionally, as I do) … European-style central-government control (commands from “headquarters”; seriously) over the private sector and the private sector’s creativeness and innovativeness.  </p>
<p>No, sir!  Wouldn’t want any of that socialist German-style engineering expertise to make its way across the Atlantic. Especially since all those engineers at, say, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siemens">Siemens</a> got their engineering degrees at &#8212; and this is really dangerous&#8211;places like the University of Heidelberg!  Which is, OMG, a public university!  Supported by German taxes.  And financially accessible by some students whose families are not upscale!</p>
<p>Yup.  And that engineering and computer science school at the University of Illinois, regularly rated among the top such programs in the country, can’t possibly have produced someone who, say, while attending the school, developed the World Wide Web by developing the first Internet browser, called Mosaic, which became Netscape.  Uh-uh.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Andreessen">Marc Andreessen</a> only thinks his college memories of life in Champaign, Ill. But they’re really of life in Palo Alto.  Or maybe Cambridge, Mass.  And how did that Wisconsin native even manage to invent anything at all, given the “hammock” (Paul Ryan’s term, not Brooks’s) he found himself in when he (probably) took out a low-interest, no-repayments-required-until-five-years-after-graduation loan to pay that out-of-state tuition back in the late 1980s, and early 1990s, under a federal Great Society program? </p>
<p>The whiplash-inducing stuff in Brooks’s column appears at two points. The first one comes about midway through the column, when Brooks switches from praising the Obama speech as a strong argument for collective government policies to, say, assist in economic and social mobility.  The second one comes late in the column, after paragraphs in which he says such things as that we have a much more dynamic and innovative private sector than does Europe because colleges and universities in the Unites States are private rather than public and Europe’s are public rather than private (I’m not joking or exaggerating; he says this), and that the programs Obama supports, such as student loan programs and financial support for schools and medical and scientific research and the like, are attempts by political progressives to undermine private enterprise and control the private sector from Washington.  He then concedes, apparently unwittingly&#8211;he seems unaware, at least, of the irony&#8211;that public programs and financial regulations can (and do!) assist creativity and innovation.</p>
<p>You really have to read the whole column to get the full flavor.  Just put on a neck brace first.</p>
<p>And while you’re reading it, remind yourself that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Edison">Thomas Edison</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Graham_Bell">Alexander Graham Bel</a>l, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_">Henry Ford</a> did not attend a private college.  Nor did <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enrico_Fermi">Enrico Fermi </a>or some of the other great physicists who emigrated to this country in the late 1930s after receiving their education at public universities&#8211;in Europe!  </p>
<p>And that David Brooks did attend a private university: the University of Chicago.  And that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Brooks_(journalist)">his Philadelphia Main Line parents </a>probably paid his tuition and room and board, free and clear.</p>
<p>Enough said. I think.  Unless of course he’s invented something that I don’t know of.  And that’s useful. </p>
<p>&#8212;-<br />*PS: Indulge me in my obsession with idiocy from big-name, mainstream political pundits, writing in (or on) prestigious, widely read political-commentary forums.  Neither David Brooks <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2013/01/what-dana-milbanks-stunningly-awful.html">nor Dana Milba</a><a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2013/01/what-dana-milbanks-stunningly-awful.html">nk</a> is, after all, all that important, I recognize.  But Brooks, <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2013/01/he-asked-not-what-his-country-can-do.html">if not Milbank</a>, flatly crossed the line into misrepresentation of fact in a way that is really beyond the pale. And no one but me probably even noticed.  </p>
<p>Frustrating. </p>
<p>&#8212;-<br />ANOTHER PS: As I said in response to a comment in the Comments thread, Brooks’s longtime shtick is anti-European&#8211;as in, Europe’s standard of living is lower than ours and that’s because their socialist policies deter creativity and innovation and therefore “dynamism.” He’s apparently run out of plausible-sounding arguments to support his belief, so he just blathers the claim incoherently, as needed.</p>
