<p> The prospects for domestic demand in the US are not bright. The labor market barely generates jobs and fiscal policy is a drag. Americans are consuming; but there’s unlikely sufficient nominal income growth to stabilize consumption expenditure growth at current levels.
<p>We’ve seen years where consumption growth outpaced income growth; but those periods of consumption were financed through leverage build – with financial conditions tight, the possibility of financing consumption outside the labor market is deteriorating (see the Banking and Finance section of the latest <a href="http://federalreserve.gov/fomc/beigebook/2011/20111019/default.htm">Fed Beige Book</a>, not encouraging).</p>
<p> <a name="more"></a>
<p>Consumption growth cannot outpace income growth indefinitely. Unless we get a true policy kick (by fiscal policy, admittedly), the cyclical recovery could be a thing of the past.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2011/10/income_consumption_chart1.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2011/10/income_consumption_chart1.jpg" width="600" height="390"></a></p>
<p>That was nominal growth – in real terms and on a historical basis, the story is just as bad. Don’t let anybody tell you that real consumption growth. At 1.8% Y/Y in August is anything but miserable, especially given that its annual pace is 1 ppt below the long run average, 2.8% Y/Y. Long run real income growth is even worse at 2.5 ppt BELOW the long run average, 2.8% Y/Y.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2011/10/real_history_chart.jpg" width="600" height="390"></p>
<p>Uh huh – yes, the US economy has definitely avoided the <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-19/bullard-says-fed-policy-appropriately-easy-relapse-unlikely-tom-keene.html">‘recession scare’</a>…right. As I see it, the problem with policy these days is not size nor level, rather complacency.</p>
