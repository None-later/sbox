<blockquote>
<p>AFTER years of poor investment returns, the pension funds of the United States’ largest companies are further behind than they have ever been. </p>
<p>The companies in the Standard &#038; Poor’s 500 collectively reported that at the end of their most recent fiscal years, their pension plans had obligations of $1.68 trillion and assets of just $1.32 trillion. The difference of $355 billion was the largest ever, S.&#038; P. said in a report. </p>
<p>Of the 500 companies, 338 have defined-benefit pension plans, and only 18 are fully funded. Seven companies reported that their plans were underfunded by more than $10 billion, with the largest negative figure, $21.6 billion, reported by General Electric. </p>
<p>The other companies with more than $10 billion in underfunding were AT&#038;T, Boeing, Exxon Mobil, Ford Motor, I.B.M. and Lockheed Martin. JPMorgan Chase had the largest amount of overfunding, $1.6 billion. </p>
<p>The main cause of the underfunding at many companies does not appear to be a failure to make contributions to the plans. Instead, it reflects the fact that investment markets have not performed well for a sustained period. </p>
