<div>Solamere Capital—named after an exclusive neighborhood in Utah where the family had a vacation home—was incorporated in February of 2008, only weeks after the campaign ended. Its first office address was the Romney campaign headquarters in Boston’s North End. One of its first big commitments was $10 million from Ann Romney’s blind trust&#8230; According to a copy of the Solamere prospectus that<em> <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/politics/articles/2011/10/07/mitt_romneys_chief_fund_raiser_built_investment_firm_on_political_network/" target="_blank">The Boston Globe </a></em>obtained, they promised “unique access” to lucrative deals that the partners would land thanks to their “close personal and business relationships.” <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/01/us/politics/ties-to-romney-08-helped-fuel-equity-firm.html?pagewanted=all&#038;_r=0" target="_blank"><em>The New York Times</em></a> reported that the firm ultimately raised money from a variety of Romney donors and fund-raisers, including<em> </em>John Miller, a longtime family friend and former corporate CEO, and Meg Whitman, the former head of eBay.

<div>Ann Romney’s blind trust had a seeing-eye dog. The trust was blind but then could see.  Truly amazing grace.
