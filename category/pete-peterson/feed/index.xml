<p>While a name well known to some, it is interesting I rarely hear it mentioned in less political circles.  I run into the Soros name more often&#8230;  <br />But it is hard to credit Soros having more influence that happen to pop up in discussions around my hometown. Peterson&#8217;s influence and funding goes <a target="_blank" href="http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-03-04/debt-debate-did-pete-peterson-waste-his-fortune">far beyond</a> the reported 500 million of his personal money being spent.</p>
<p>When Angry Bear Bruce Webb and Dale Coberly were so diligently writing about Social Security a few years ago, many thought it was time not well spent as Social Security was safe.  Even now many I speak with have little idea about the chained CPI being pushed by Democrats.    </p>
