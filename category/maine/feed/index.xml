<p>One strange thing about the health care reform debate is that insurance companies claim to support reform.  I have tended to suspect that they are just playing possum.  </p>
<p>Now I find positive proof that WellPoint is willing to do what it takes to make sure health care reform passes &#8212; <a href="http://digbysblog.blogspot.com/2009/10/socialized-profits-by-dday-wild-story.html">they sued the state of Maine claiming they have a constitutional right to make a profit !?!<br /></a><br />In fact they seem to support a public option.  It will be a bit hard for Sens Snowe and Collins to explain why they think no public option is needed after this.</p>
<p>I have a challenge.  Can anyone think of anything anyone could do which is better for the public option that this ?</p>
