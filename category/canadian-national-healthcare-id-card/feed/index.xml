				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Romney’s best line of the day was unscripted. A stray Canadian had driven from Ontario to ask Romney a question and in the process joked that Romney could not have his ID card for Canada’s national health-care system.

</div>
<div></div>
<div>The ball sat on the tee for a long second before Romney hit it. “I don’t want it!” Romney said. The crowd roared.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>&#8212; “<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/two-michigan-rallies-reveal-romney-santorum-flaws/2012/02/21/gIQA5Sz9ZR_print.html">Two Michigan rallies revealRomney, Santorum flaws</a>,” David A. Fahrenthold, Washington Post, Feb. 25, reporting on a rally earlier that day in Shelby Township, Mich. (suburban Detroit)
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Hmm.  Well, okay.  Romney and his wife Ann, an MS victim, have about $220 million with which to pay their medical expenses. </div>
<div></div>
<div>But there’s another reason that they don’t need national medical insurance: They live in Massachusetts, and so, by law, <i>have</i> medical insurance, even though neither Romney nor Ann is employed and even though Ann has a serious medical condition the onset of which predates the end of their coverage through Romney’s last employer.  That law is known, among those who deride it, as “Romneycare.”
