<p><strong>A Post:  Tax Burdens, Presidents, and Subsequent Economic Growth &#8211; A Few Pictures, Part 1</strong></p>
<p>Last week I had a post looking at the relationship between <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/07/presidents-tax-burdens-and-subsequent.html">the change in the tax burden in the first two years of a Presidential administration and the growth of real GDP during the remaining years of the administration</a>.  I&#8217;ve done variations of this exercise before.  It turns out that the more an administration reduced the tax burden in its first two years, the slower the growth the in real GDP over the remainder of its term in office administration.  Assuming the result is more than an artifact of the data (and it does seem to correspond with other results I&#8217;ve reported here over the years), it requires an explanation.  While (I am not happy to report) an increased tax burden <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/12/simple-explanation-for-strange-paradox.html">might in and of itself stimulate faster economic growth</a>, I suspect a bigger effect is that a) the easiest way to move the tax burden is by increasing or decreasing tax regulation and b) there is a correlation between an administration&#8217;s views on tax regulations and its views on other regulations that are intended to prevent externalities.   This theory is supported by the fact that the relationship between lower tax burdens and slower growth is strengthened by not including the administrations that served only four rather than eight years makes the relationship stronger.<br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>As I keep noting, one doesn&#8217;t have to like the results.  I personally would much prefer a world in which lower tax burdens do lead to faster economic growth.  But the data doesn&#8217;t seem to show that.  Still, every time I put up a post like this, I get a lot of flack.  One thing people keep telling me is that the results are, at best, a coincidence.  In their honor, in today&#8217;s post I&#8217;m going to describe a few more coincidences that the data shows in my next few posts.  Some of these coincidences I expected to see, and some, to be frank, I did not.  Today I&#8217;m going to stick with a few coincidences I expected.</p>
<p>So&#8230;  let&#8217;s go with coincidence number one. The graph below shows the change in the tax burden from Year 0 (i.e., the last full year of the prior administration) to Year 2 on one axis, and the growth rate in the last full year of each administration.  (Only eight year administrations are included.)  As an example, for Ronald Reagan, we see the change in the tax burden from 1980 to 1982 along one axis and the percentage change from the 1987 real GDP to the 1988 real GDP.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7RNRhtKqqLc/ThrMTwrhaBI/AAAAAAAAAqU/fqqQYQet0G4/s1600/Follow-up_figure_1.bmp"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7RNRhtKqqLc/ThrMTwrhaBI/AAAAAAAAAqU/fqqQYQet0G4/s320/Follow-up_figure_1.bmp" border="0" alt=""></a><br />Figure 1</p>
<p>Notice that the relationship between the tax burden in the first two years of each administration and the growth rate in its last year is extremely strong.  That&#8217;s consistent with what I wrote in my last post (and so many times before):  most administrations do not change their tax policy very much, but tax policy (and other policies that correlate with tax policy) can take a while to have an effect on the economy. </p>
<p>Before I go on, a few ground rules for those who want to comment or send me e-mail: <br />1.  If you really believe that the growth rate in the last year of an administration is &#8220;causing&#8221; the change in the tax burden in the beginning of the administration, I encourage you to seek psychiatric help.  I can&#8217;t do anything for you.<br />2.  US&#8217; participation in World War 2 prior to 1940 is best described as peripheral.  Growth in 1940, or 1939, or 1934 for that matter, is not due to World War 2.  </p>
<p>(If you find my constant repetition of these ground rules funny, hazard a guess as to what creeps into my inbox.)  </p>
<p>Now, another coincidence&#8230;  the next figure shows the the change in the tax burden from Year 0 (i.e., the last full year of the prior administration) to Year 2 on one axis, and the growth rate in the fourth year of each administration. </p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-xfHijDM1urw/ThrMTwNv-zI/AAAAAAAAAqc/CKJJTyPT0Js/s1600/Follow-up_figure_2_-_corrected.bmp"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-xfHijDM1urw/ThrMTwNv-zI/AAAAAAAAAqc/CKJJTyPT0Js/s320/Follow-up_figure_2_-_corrected.bmp" border="0" alt=""></a>Figure 2</p>
<p>Again&#8230; the picture looks an awful like Figure 1.  The fit isn&#8217;t as good (consistent with the idea that it takes a while for policy to have a a very strong effect.  Kind of odd for a coincidence.</p>
<p>Now&#8230; you may be wondering&#8230; what about other years.  I&#8217;ll tell you flat out, the fits in years 1 and 2 are awful&#8230; consistent with the idea that it takes a while for policy to have a very strong effect.  As to the rest, that will wait for the next post.</p>
<p>To close, nominal and real GDP come from the <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/xls/gdplev.xls">Bureau of Economic Analysis</a>.  GDP was first computed in 1929, so the first complete administration for which we have data is FDR I.  Data on the Federal government&#8217;s tax receipts comes from the Bureau of Economic Analysis&#8217; <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/SelectTable.asp?Selected=N#S3">NIPA Table 3.2</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Optimal Tax Rates for Generating Economic Growth According to Barro-Sahasakul Tax Data</strong></p>
<p>This piece is a bit more wonky than what I normally post.  </p>
<p>I recently re-read <a href="http://www.economics.harvard.edu/faculty/barro/files/Barro%2BRedlick%2Bpaper%2B_2_.pdf">&#8220;Macroeconomic Effects from Government Purchases and Taxes&#8221; by Barro &#038; Redlick</a>.  I was struck by how different the conclusions they make about taxes are from what you get if you simply <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/12/top-marginal-income-tax-rates-real.html">make a bar chart of the top marginal rate at any given time versus the growth rate over the next year.</a></p>
<p>Now, obviously, Barro &#038; Redlick take a completely different approach&#8230; but at the bottom of everything is the data set they use (see Table 1 of the above referenced paper and <a href="http://www.economics.harvard.edu/faculty/barro/files/MacroEffectsGovPurchasesTaxes_Data%2BAppendix.pdf">this explanation</a> of the &#8220;Barro-Sahasakul&#8221; data set).  To cut to the chase, they use estimates of the average marginal tax rates paid by taxpayers rather than the top marginal rate that I used in the bar chart referenced above.  Their overall marginal rate is made up of not just federal tax rates, but also social security tax rates, and even estimates of the state tax rates.  It should be noted the Barro is an average rate, and since the average includes non-filers (who pay zero), the Barro rate is often well below the top marginal rate.  The top Barro rate is 41.8% which occurred in 1981 (compared to top marginal rates of 90%+ from 1951 and through 1963).  The Barro rate is also not correlated with the top marginal income tax rate (correlation going back to 1929 is -30%).<br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>A lot of work clearly went into producing this overall marginal rate (I&#8217;m going to call it the &#8220;Barro tax rate&#8221; for simplicity).  But does it explain economic growth rates any better than the top marginal rate?  </p>
<p>I ran a quick and dirty regression&#8230;</p>
<p>Growth in real GDP from t to t+1 = f(Barro Tax Rate, Barro Tax Rate Squared, Top Marginal Income Tax Rate, Top Marginal Income Tax Rate Squared)</p>
<p>Data ran back to 1929, the first year for which <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/xls/gdplev.xls">real GDP</a> was computed by the BEA.  Top marginal rates came from the <a href="http://www.irs.gov/taxstats/article/0,,id=175910,00.html">IRS Statistics of Income Table 23</a>.  And the Barro Tax Rate came from Table 1 of the Barro &#038; Redlick paper.  Since Barro rates are computed only through 2005, that&#8217;s when the analysis stops.</p>
<p>Results were as follows:</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-h-4Ev_hE3pw/TdKFsv5FYUI/AAAAAAAAAnY/pTXz_DCXXHU/s1600/Barro_Figure_1.bmp"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-h-4Ev_hE3pw/TdKFsv5FYUI/AAAAAAAAAnY/pTXz_DCXXHU/s320/Barro_Figure_1.bmp" border="0" alt=""></a>Figure 1</p>
<p>(Note&#8230; the errors got big during leading up to WW2, but I don&#8217;t think that invalidates this quick and dirty look.)</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what I get out of this:</p>
<p>1.  There is definitely a quadratic relationship between tax rates in one period and real economic growth the next.<br />2.  If you&#8217;re going to pick either the Barro rate or the top marginal income tax rate, go with the latter.  Its clearly better at explaining economic growth rates.<br />3.  There may be something to be said about using the Barro rate and the top marginal income tax rate together.  They do explain different things.  </p>
<p>If you compute the &#8220;optimal tax rate&#8221; &#8211; the rate that maximizes economic growth implied by the regression &#8211; you get a Barro rate of 25% and a top marginal income tax rate of 64%.  The optimal Barro rate was last seen in 1966, when the top marginal rate was 70% and the bottom rate was 14%.  I&#8217;m guessing from this, and from looking at the Barro rate series, that this would imply that if you want to maximize growth, the top rate should be raised to about 64% and the tax burden on folks at the lower end of the income scale should be lowered.  I&#8217;m not sure Barro would be pleased with these results.  </p>
<p>I may return to this, but my next post should be the next in the series on GDP growth and the S&#038;P 500.</p>

<p><strong>Four Graphs Looking at Real Economic Growth</strong></p>
<p>This post contains four graphs looking at real economic growth, three of which also contain some tax information.  </p>
<p>The first graph shows the five year annualized growth in real GDP for every five year period beginning the one ending in 1934.  (I begin then simply because data on real GDP is only available from the BEA beginning in 1929.)  </p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Pe2bxSBiDKA/TcfbFQ3MynI/AAAAAAAAAlY/VFv4BjUYjG0/s1600/realecongrowth1.bmp"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Pe2bxSBiDKA/TcfbFQ3MynI/AAAAAAAAAlY/VFv4BjUYjG0/s320/realecongrowth1.bmp" border="0" alt=""></a>Figure 1.</p>
<p>I took the liberty of adding in two lines free-style.  The first is my attempt to trace the high points over time, leaving out WW2.  The second traces the low points, assuming the collapse from 1929 to 1932 and the post-WW2 drop are special cases.  (That huge dip from 1945 to 1950, economic shrinkage and all, is what libertarian professors like David R. Henderson keep referring to inexplicably as a <a href="http://mercatus.org/sites/default/files/publication/U.S.%20Postwar%20Miracle.Henderson.11.4.10.pdf">post-war miracle</a>.)   Those ad hoc lines seem to indicate that any &#8220;Great Moderation&#8221; in the economy &#8211; whether it began in the 1980s or earlier &#8211; is more due to a slowing down of the rapid periods of growth than to a reduction in the severity of downturns.  Put another way&#8230; the Great Moderation = the Great Suckening (for readers who aren&#8217;t economists, that&#8217;s a technical term like &#8220;sterilizing monetary policy&#8221; or heteroscedasticity).<br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Figure 2 is similar to Figure 1, but it strips out the two ad hoc lines and adds in the five year average top marginal individual income tax rate.  </p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-tJ9PiQJBu8c/TcfbgH1paLI/AAAAAAAAAlg/mK8FWtZWzYA/s1600/realecongrowth2.bmp"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-tJ9PiQJBu8c/TcfbgH1paLI/AAAAAAAAAlg/mK8FWtZWzYA/s320/realecongrowth2.bmp" border="0" alt=""></a>Figure 2.</p>
<p>As Figure 2 shows, there doesn&#8217;t seem to be much of a relationship between the average top marginal tax rate in any five year period and the annualized growth in real GDP over that same period, and certainly there&#8217;s no sign from this graph that higher tax rates discourage economic growth.  The fact that the correlation between the two series is positive indicates that if anything, in general real economic growth rates have tended to be higher when tax rates were higher.</p>
<p>Figure 3 is a scatter-plot version of the data in Figure 2.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-7F97t7KPiRI/TcfbgQDffFI/AAAAAAAAAlo/fCIL2rV0SAM/s1600/realecongrowth3.bmp"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-7F97t7KPiRI/TcfbgQDffFI/AAAAAAAAAlo/fCIL2rV0SAM/s320/realecongrowth3.bmp" border="0" alt=""></a>Figure 3.</p>
<p>Notice that it kind of looks like you can put a quadratic curve to these points &#8211; at &#8220;low&#8221; tax rates, increasing tax rates are associated with faster economic growth.  Only at very &#8220;high&#8221; tax rates &#8211; somewhere north of 70% or 80%  &#8211; does it appear that reducing tax rates are associated with faster economic growth.  Reminiscent of <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=278">this graph</a>, dontcha think?  Another thing that&#8217;s noticeable&#8230; the greater variability in growth that accompanies higher tax rates, which was also visible from Figure 2.</p>
<p>Finally, Figure 4 is the same as Figure 3, but rescaled to leave out 1942-1945, which only makes the lack of a lower taxes = faster economic growth relationship more obvious.</p>

<p>As always, if you want a copy of the spreadsheet where these graphs were produced, drop me a line.  I&#8217;m at mike period my last name (that is &#8220;kimel&#8221; &#8211; one m only!) at gmail period com.</p>

<p><strong>Libertarians Looking Vaguely in the Direction of Apostasy</strong></p>
<p>Tyler Cowen is a prominent libertarian, a professor at GMU and Director of the Mercatus Institute.  He is also on very, very dangerous ground.  Lately he has had a couple of posts &#8211; the latest one <a href="http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2011/05/was-world-war-ii-good-for-the-american-economy.html">here</a> &#8211; that quote a new book by <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Great-Leap-Forward-Depression-Financial/dp/0300151098/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&#038;qid=1303730935&#038;sr=8-1/marginalrevol-20">Alexander Fields</a>.  I haven&#8217;t read the book yet, but it seems to describe the 1930s as a period of great innovation despite pervasive misery.</p>
<p>But some of the passages Tyler quotes come tantalizingly close to noting that the economy was actually growing very rapidly by 1939.  But what happens if he realizes it isn&#8217;t just after 1939, that real growth under FDR was faster than under any President since data has been collected &#8211; even if you leave out 1941 through 1945.  See Figure 1 at <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=325">this post</a>.  (Or that FDR was followed by LBJ, and then JFK, and then Clinton.)  What if he takes a look at <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=224">private investment during the New Deal era</a>.  What if he looks at the <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/04/1920s-depression-glenn-beck-thomas.html">relationship between tax rates and economic downturns</a> or <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/04/1920s-depression-glenn-beck-thomas_19.html">comparison of growth rates</a> between the &#8220;roaring 20s&#8221; favored by libertarian myth and the New Deal era?  </p>
<p>Could a person really remain a libertarian if they realized things like that?  Cowen has a lot at stake.  I wonder if he&#8217;ll take the next step.  </p>
<p>Note&#8230; <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2011/05/notes_from_the_3.html">Arnold Kling</a> is also skating on the same ground.  As of this writing, his readers, usually good for at least a few comments on every post, are stunned into silence. </p>

<p><strong>Where Has the Spending Gone, Joe Dimaggio?</strong></p>
<p>Lately there&#8217;s been a gnashing of the teeth about the deficit and the debt and what to do about it. Democrats point out that when GW took office, there was no deficit, and that a big part of the problem is that federal <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2012/assets/hist01z2.xls">tax revenues have fallen from 20.6% of GDP in Fiscal Year 2000 to 14.9% in Fiscal Year 2010</a> (warning &#8211; Excel file), and are slated to fall to 14.4% this fiscal year. I found a nice graph <a href="http://www.deptofnumbers.com/blog/2010/08/tax-revenue-as-a-fraction-of-gdp/">here</a>. Despite the nonsense that gets referred to as <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&#038;source=web&#038;cd=2&#038;sqi=2&#038;ved=0CCoQFjAB&#038;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.presimetrics.com%2Fblog%2F%3Fp%3D241&#038;ei=s222TZCPCYGjtge85dSDAQ&#038;usg=AFQjCNFiXHcLgzuoMEAoOSvMT8xL5s_ILw&#038;sig2=U6IgfbibvYOb3oNp7L6n1g">Hauser&#8217;s Law</a>, the big fall in tax revenues is is in large part due to the tax cuts, although the poor economy also plays its share.</p>
<p>(Note &#8211; so I don&#8217;t have to keep typing it, all years in this post are fiscal years.)</p>
<p>But for there to be a deficit, tax revenues (whether high or low) have to be less than spending. And spending has also gone up (again see OMB Table 1.2 referenced above) from 18.2% of GDP in 2000 to 23.8% of GDP in 2010, and is slated to go above 25% of GDP this fiscal year. (It is worth noting – federal spending as a percentage of GDP fell in every single year during the Clinton administration… which means Newt Gingrich doesn’t get credit for it unless you believe he had one heck of a time machine.)<br /><a name="more"></a><br />I thought it would be interesting to see where that spending is going, so I pulled the data from <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2012/assets/hist03z1.xls">OMB Table 3.1</a> and graphed it below. (Dotted lines indicate future projected spending.)</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-BbflqCjK94s/TbbiAJdDivI/AAAAAAAAAk4/pcGOJLsGCno/s1600/Fed_Spending1.bmp"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-BbflqCjK94s/TbbiAJdDivI/AAAAAAAAAk4/pcGOJLsGCno/s320/Fed_Spending1.bmp" border="0" alt=""></a>Figure 1</p>
<p>The figure indicates that for the most part, spending in most categories has been pretty flat. Defense spending, though, rose from 3% of GDP in 2000 to 4.3% in 2008, 4.8% in 2010, and is slated to go above 5% this year. Afghanistan, Iraq, and now Libya all cost money, especially if conducted with sweetheart no-bid deals. The bigger ticket category that saw increases was &#8220;human resources&#8221; &#8211; that was 11.4% of GDP in 2000, reached 13.2% of GDP in 2008, and is expected to top 16% this year.</p>
<p>So what are these human resources? I don&#8217;t have the definition in front of me, but I think that includes things like unemployment compensation, food stamps, and the like. Put another way, some of the spending (it&#8217;s 3:36 AM right now &#8211; I think the &#8220;how much&#8221; part of &#8220;some&#8221; has to wait for another post) is happening because the tax cuts didn&#8217;t work as advertised. But then, its not like that <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=301">should have been a surprise</a>.</p>

<p><strong>GW Broke with Clinton.  Did Obama Break with GW</strong>?<br />Cross-posted at the <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=428">Presimetrics blog</a></p>
<p>The following major initiatives had occurred toward the end of April 2003, about two years and three months into the GW Bush administration:</p>
<p>1.    Marginal income tax rate cuts in 2001, 2002 and 2003.<br />2.    Passage of No Child Left Behind Act<br />3.    Outlays as a percentage of GDP <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2012/assets/hist01z3.xls">rose</a>.  <br />were 18.2% in fiscal 2000, 18.2% in fiscal 2001 and 19.1% in fiscal 2002. <br />4.    The inherited surplus became a deficit.<br />5.    Passage of the Patriot Act.<br />6.    Invasion of Afghanistan in response to the Sept 11 attacks.  Note that by April 2003, the Taliban insurgency was already gaining strength again.<br />7.    Abortion restrictions.  Reinstatement of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico_City_Policy">Mexico City Policy</a>.  Withdrawing funding for the United Nations Population Fund.  Began the push for the Partial Birth Abortion Ban (introduced in Feb. 2003 by Rick Santorum, passed in November of 2003).<br />8.    Sarbanes Oxley.<br />9.    Homeland Security Act.<br />10.  Invasion of Iraq.<br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Whether you agree with these policies or not, its a not insubstantial list.  Several, if not most of these initiatives represent big breaks with the previous administration.  For instance, Clinton raised marginal tax rates, whereas GW lowered them.  Federal spending / GDP fell during every single year of the Clinton administration, but would rise in most years of the Bush administration.  Clinton managed to turn a deficit into a surplus, whereas GW went the other way.  The Mexico City Policy which GW reinstated had been rescinded by Clinton.  The Patriot Act and the Homeland Security Act don&#8217;t seem to be Clinton&#8217;s style.  And while one might argue Clinton might have acted against Afghanistan following 9/11/2001, it is very, very hard to envision the subsequent invasion of Iraq had Clinton been President in 2003.  </p>
<p>We are now about two years and three months into the Obama administration &#8211; about the same amount of time it took GW to engage in the initiatives mentioned above.  So&#8230;. what are the major initiatives of the Obama administration so far, and which of them represent clear breaks with the Bush administration?  (Please stick to things that actually happened or at least in which Obama invested some political capital.  Something Obama might have said during his campaign, something you heard from one of your hallucinations, or something reported by Fox News may not fit into that category.) </p>

<p>Why I will not be Voting for Obama in 2012</p>
<p>Cross posted at the <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=417">Presimetrics blog</a>.</p>
<p>The presidential elections are a year and a half away, but I am pretty certain of one thing:  I will not be voting to re-elect Barack Obama.  That does not mean that I will be voting for the Republican nominee, or for any of the third party candidates, but rather that I do not see any likely circumstances under which Barack Obama will do anything I think is necessary to earn my vote.  That may seem unusual because I voted for Obama, and my economic views are probably best described as slightly left center.  <br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Now, I&#8217;m nobody special, and my endorsement or lack of it isn&#8217;t going to make a whit of difference, but I suspect there are other people who are also somewhere close to slightly left of center (i.e., who are either what Obama considers to be his &#8220;natural constituency&#8221; or close enough that they can be convinced to vote for him rather than his likely eventual opponent) who are starting to think the same thing I am.  So perhaps its worth trying to explain why I feel the way I do.  I think its easiest to do that by discussing the issues I think I important and what Obama has done (or not) about them.</p>
<p>1.  Economic growth/unemployment/taxes.  These three topics, as Senator Ryan and all economists know, are closely inter-related.  Sadly, the relationship between these three topics is very, very different than Senator Ryan and most economists believe.  Getting the economy moving is vital after <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/06/economic-growth-rates-presidents-party.html">eight years of mediocre growth</a> under GW Bush, culminating in the Great Recession.  But when you go back as far as the data allows, you find <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=278">a quadratic relationship between the top marginal tax rate in one year and growth in the subsequent year </a>, and that we are at a point on the curve where it is an increase, not a decrease in tax rates, that is likely to lead to faster economic growth.  Even sticking to the period of relatively low taxes we’ve been in since Reagan started his tax cuts, <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=253">growth rates should go up and unemployment rates should go down </a> if tax rates go up.</p>
<p>There are two reasons this is true.  One is that taxes pay for the existence of the government.  The government provides services the government provides that are conducive to growth and which the private sector simply has not historically provided at non-negligible levels.  These services include national defense, monitoring and controlling epidemics, and building infrastructure.  </p>
<p>The government also provides some leadership that can make it possible for the private sector to adopt new technologies.  As an example – in this day and age, having a vehicle that could run on any mix of gasoline, ethanol or natural gas (depending on which is cheapest per mile) would be a nice thing to have.  You can buy one of those vehicles today… in Brazil.  Never heard of such a thing?  Well, there are millions of bi-flex and tri-flex vehicles on the road in Brazil today, made by such exotic companies as GM, Ford, Volkswagen, and Mercedes.  Why are there so many flex-fuel cars and motorcycles on the road in Brazil?  Because the Brazilian government realized you can’t get from 1970s fuel shortages to where they are now without someone forcing both auto makers and fuel stations to make changes simultaneously.  Without government action, auto makers wouldn’t have been willing to mass produce flex-fuel vehicles out of fear there would be no filling stations for those vehicles, and fueling stations would have been reluctant to make investments out of fear that there would be no vehicles to take advantage of them.  In other words, the situation we see in the U.S.</p>
<p>But there is another, perhaps more important reason, why higher tax rates often lead to faster economic growth and lower unemployment.  As I keep pointing out, any good business owner (and any lousy one, for that matter) will tell you, if you tax something more, you get less of it.  And income taxes can be seen as penalties on withdrawing money from one’s business for the purpose of consumption, which means they discourage business owners from taking profits out of their business.  The alternative to taking profits and consuming is re-investing in the business.  Thus, higher tax rates on income lead to more investment on business.  And this result is borne out empirically; when the top marginal rate is below 50%, a tax increase is correlated with more private investment and less private consumption. </p>
<p>2.  Deficits and the national debt.  This is another tax related issue.  Historically, during and following tax hikes <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=241">tax  collections /GDP rise</a>.  During and following tax cuts, tax collections fall.   (How a fact so basic that even a child could observe it in the data became a surprise to many people is a testament to, ahem, economists like Art Laffer and Thomas Sowell.  <br />But there are many ways to cut taxes people pay, and changing the marginal rate is only one such way.  Enforcement of tax law is another.  Since 1929 (that’s as far back as data is available) – every single Republican President decreased the tax burden, the percentage of people’s income paid in taxes, and thus far, <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=92">all Democrats but Truman and Obama have increased that percentage.</a>  Click on the link and you’ll also see that growth rates were much faster for Presidents who increased the tax burden than for Presidents who decreased it.  Though there are many ways of being fiscally responsible or irresponsible, it is, of course, easier to balance the budget if tax revenues are higher.  <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2007/12/republican-party-and-national-debt.html">The last four Republican Presidents – Ford, Reagan, and the two Bushes all increased the national debt.</a>  Conversely, before Obama you had to go back to 1944, when the nation was fighting World War 2, to find a Democrat in the Oval Office who increased the national debt.  </p>
<p>And yes, I know, there was a bad recession going on when Obama took office, and the economy still sucks.  And yes, I agree with Keynes  &#8211; the data shows that expansions following recessions during which the government increased its spending <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=15">are longer and stronger than</a> when expansions following recessions during which the government cut spending.  But that spending should have been paid for  with tax hikes.  Historically, when the government raises taxes during or shortly after a recession, the resulting expansion is longer and stronger than when the government cuts taxes.  <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=3">That’s what the data shows</a>.  The reasons are the same as given above in the discussion about economic growth, plus one:  during periods of economic weakness those in the private sector tend to sit on money.  </p>
<p>As an aside – it is worth noting that both this Great Recession and the Great Depression came <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=192">about half a decade after big reductions in both marginal tax rates and regulation.</a>  Coincidence?</p>
<p>3.  Obama’s performance might resemble that of other Democratic administrations more closely had he chosen economic advisors who paid more attention to data and were less enamored of the policies GW Bush was employing.  When you pick an advisor who <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2009/01/further-critique-of-romer-and-romer.html">jumps through hoops to be like one of GW’s economic advisors</a>, you will get GW’s outcomes.  Its even worse <a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2008/11/christy-romer-to-cea.html">when you’ve been warned</a> and you do it anyway.   Frankly, if I say so myself, it isn’t that difficult to find <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=174">people who actually can spot business cycles at both ends</a>.</p>
<p>4.  The bail-outs.  Of course, one of the big contributors to the Obama deficits are how Obama reacted to the poor state of the economy.  (In fairness, some of the bail-out spending was pre-committed by the previous administration, but then Obama voted in favor of that spending as a Senator and didn’t try to walk it back once he became President.)  But where are the prosecutions?  Was there not wrongdoing?  And then you have stories <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/the-real-housewives-of-wall-street-look-whos-cashing-in-on-the-bailout-20110411?print=true">like Matt Taibbi’s latest</a>.  Like GW’s policies before him, Obama’s approach seems almost designed create another mess.  </p>
<p>5.  Health care.  Obama care = Romney care.  This is a policy that Republicans were pushing a decade ago, and would still be pushing if a Democrat hadn’t proposed it.  Where is the public option?</p>
<p>6.  The wars.  I don’t have a solution, but then I didn’t spend a few hundred million bucks running for President, nor am I about to spend a billion dollars running for re-election.  It is the height of immorality to seek out the presidency or re-election in a time of war and yet have no clue how to bring the war to a successful conclusion.</p>
<p>I always thought it was the height of insanity for anyone to vote to re-elect GW in 2004, after screwing up the economy and two wars.  Yes, I know some <a href="http://www.hoover.org/publications/hoover-digest/article/7505">worthies were still talking “Mount Rushmore” a year or two later</a>, but one should be better than that.  And yes, there are a handful of things Obama did that GW might not do, but let’s be realistic – this has looked from the very beginning like GW’s third term.</p>
<p>Which leaves just one question – if the policies of the Republicans are even worse than Obama&#8217;s – and they tend to support anti-growth tax policies (calling them pro-growth doesn’t change the data), what should a rational person do?  I don’t know.  But I think if I’m going to see Republican policies enacted, I’d prefer to see them run under a Republican label.  See, Democratic policies may not be very good, but historically they have tended to produce  <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=92">better results</a> than Republican policies.  (BTW &#8211; Michael Kanell and I have an entire book called Presimetrics looking at how Presidents performed on a wide range of topics.)  Another four years spent bringing the feeble Democratic brand down to the levels of the even more feeble Republican brand will cause lasting damage.</p>

<p><strong>John Taylor in Favor of Higher Marginal Income Tax Rates?  If Not, Why Not?</strong></p>
<p>A couple of weeks ago, John Taylor <a href="http://johnbtaylorsblog.blogspot.com/2011/01/higher-investment-best-way-to-reduce.html">posted a graph</a> showing that since 1990, there has been a negative correlation between the Investment to GDP ratio and unemployment.   </p>
<p>There&#8217;s been some back and forth between Taylor and some of the other big boys (some of it summarized at <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2011/04/graph-fight.html">Mark Thoma&#8217;s Economists View</a>, and even <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/30/more-on-unemployment-and-investment/">Krugman</a> has weighed in).<br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Lots of fun is being had by all, but it seems everyone, especially John Taylor, is missing a key point.  If, as he states in his post, &#8220;the most effective way to reduce unemployment is to raise investment as a share of GDP&#8221; and if we want to reduce unemployment, then we should be <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=301">raising the top marginal tax rate.</a>.  After all, going back to 1929 (that&#8217;s as far back as the Bureau of Economic Analysis has data), there&#8217;s a quadratic relationship between the top marginal income tax rate and the ratio of private investment to private consumption.</p>
<p>As I note in the post in which that analysis is done (complete with a nice graph):</p>
<blockquote><p>correlation between the top marginal tax rate the ratio of investment to consumption for top marginal tax rates below 50% is 55%. That is to say, an increase in tax rates increases the ratio of investment to consumption when tax rates are below 50%.</p></blockquote>
<p>So&#8230;  raise top marginal rate &#8212;> more investment &#8212;> lower unemployment.  I imagine John Taylor&#8217;s endorsement of higher marginal tax rates should come any moment now.</p>

<p>Deficit numbers for CEA chair signatories on the deficit letter</strong> Cross-posted at <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=404" target="_blank">Presimetrics</a>   Title updated</p>
<p>I&#8217;m kind of late to this, but apparently ten ex-chairs of the President&#8217;s Council of Economic Advisors decided to <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0311/51864.html">share their opinion about the national debt with the rest of us.</a> There&#8217;s been commentary here and there about how hypocritical some of the names on the list are &#8211; the CEA chair is the President&#8217;s chief economic advisor, and many of these people served under Presidents (and provided economic advice) that drove up the debt. I thought it would be an interesting exercise to put some numbers on the hypocrisy. <br /><a name="more"></a> <br />To do that, I pulled <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/cea/about/Former-Members">the dates for which each CEA chair served</a> and <a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/GFDEBTN">quarterly figures for the total public debt</a>. The debt series I obtained (from the Federal Reserve Economic database) goes back to 1966. The terms of each CEA chair served did not completely coincide with a yearly quarter, but I split them up as best I could. (Note &#8211; because sometimes it took a while for a CEA chair to be confirmed, but that person could well be offering the President advice before confirmation, I assumed that each CEA chair &#8220;took office&#8221; immediately after his/her predecessor left.) </p>
<p>The debt was adjusted by quarterly <a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/CPIAUCNS/downloaddata?cid=9">CPI</a>, and <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/TableView.asp?SelectedTable=264&#038;ViewSeries=NO&#038;Java=no&#038;Request3Place=N&#038;3Place=N&#038;FromView=YES&#038;Freq=Qtr&#038;FirstYear=1966&#038;LastYear=2010&#038;3Place=N&#038;Update=Update&#038;Java">population</a>, resulting in the real national debt per capita. The following figure shows the change in the national debt per person on a quarterly basis, over the length of each CEA chair&#8217;s term. The gray bars represent those who signed the letter. </p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-lQztipEU8I8/TZnmpevmfrI/AAAAAAAAAkc/5wWald-X2vo/s1600/CEA_chairs1.bmp"><img border="0" alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-lQztipEU8I8/TZnmpevmfrI/AAAAAAAAAkc/5wWald-X2vo/s320/CEA_chairs1.bmp"></a>Figure 1. </p>
<p>A few comments. </p>
<p>1. Most of the signatories to the letter increased the national debt per person. </p>
<p>2. A number of the CEA chairs are or have been with the Fed &#8211; none of them (Greenspan, Yellen, Bernanke) have signed the letter. </p>
<p>3. Harvey Rosen may look responsible&#8230; but that&#8217;s a function of the timing of the brief term (about a quarter) he served, encompassing the period when individual tax returns were due. He served under GW Bush, after all, and nothing GW, and despite what many supposed conservatives were saying through 2004, at no point did GW ever do anything that resembled being fiscally responsible. </p>
<p>4. About the only signatories who on the face of it have a leg to stand on signing this letter are Schultze (Carter&#8217;s CEA) and Bailey (Clinton&#8217;s last CEA chair). </p>
<p>5. I think its fair to stretch the leg to stand on thing to include Laura Tyson, Clinton&#8217;s first CEA chair. Yes, the debt increased while she was in office, but at a rapidly decreasing rate, and her advice provided some of the ground for the surpluses that came at the end of the Clinton term. </p>
<p>6. I&#8217;m sympathetic to Keynes&#8217; view that a responsible government runs up the debt when times are bad, and pays off the debt at other times. By that standard, a lot of these signatories have no excuse whatsoever. I believe it speaks very poorly of economics as a profession that anyone takes Martin Feldstein, Glenn Hubbard, Greg Mankiw, or Edward Lazear seriously, and I believe it is a sign that they have no honor that they would have the temerity to put their names on a letter like this. These are not, after all, low level drones whose livelihood depends on not making waves, but rather financially secure architects of the policies that cratered this country&#8217;s finances. As I see it, they were in the position to do good, and instead they enabled bad. </p>
<p>7. That Obama inherited an economic mess does not excuse his economic policies, or those who provided him with advice (Romer &#038; Goolsbee). Nationalizing debt incurred by companies (and there is no other way to describe the process by which nonperforming financial assets were taken off the ledgers of many companies) without also nationalizing the assets of those companies is a surefire way to ensure something like the Great Recession will happen again. And even a mediocre economist should have had the skills to convince even the densest of White House residents what happens when you don&#8217;t even try to incarcerate any of the bad actors. </p>
<p>8. I hesitate to disagree with <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2011/03/greg-mankiw-budget-arsonist-screaming-for-a-firehose.html">Brad DeLong</a> who is usually right, but I think there is yet another reason to avoid excusing his colleague Christina Romer. When a person&#8217;s most famous paper reaches a conclusion that gives ammunition to those who are wrong about economic policy, and that paper is itself a <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2009/01/further-critique-of-romer-and-romer.html">textbook application</a> of <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&#038;_udi=B6WY2-4NSX3Y5-5&#038;_user=10&#038;_coverDate=03%2F31%2F1960&#038;_rdoc=1&#038;_fmt=high&#038;_orig=gateway&#038;_origin=gateway&#038;_sort=d&#038;_docanchor=&#038;view=c&#038;_searchStrId=1703295207&#038;_rerunOrigin=google&#038;_acct=C000050221&#038;_version=1&#038;_urlVersion=0&#038;_userid=10&#038;md5=db031230a1348cde70370b7da4f5207c&#038;searchtype=a">Maier&#8217;s Law</a>, that person&#8217;s advice can only produce poor results. </p>
<p>9. If I had to award a &#8220;Supreme Chutzpah&#8221; award to any of the signers, I guess it would be Glenn Hubbard. Not only did he turn a surplus into a deficit and lay the groundwork for bigger and better deficits to come, his defense of that deficit he created was fairly unique, involving an <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2007/11/surplus-deficit-and-recession-wondering.html">implicit assumption of double digit GDP growth!!!</a>. (Yes, this man is now Dean of the Business School at Columbia.) I believe Hubbard was last seen co-authoring <a href="http://www4.gsb.columbia.edu/null?&#038;exclusive=filemgr.download&#038;file_id=53339">a paper</a> explaining the desirability of &#8220;a 4.5 percent mortgage for homebuyers for a period of time. This bold idea, akin to our proposal on this page on October 2, would help arrest the decline in house prices and absorb excess inventory of housing.&#8221; I&#8217;m not sure what &#8220;a period of time&#8221; is to Hubbard, but we had rates in that neighborhood for about six months <a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/data/MORTG.txt">last year</a>. The rates got there shortly after the Case Schiller Home Price Index had bottomed out and started rising, and <a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/data/SPCS20RSA.txt">right about the time the index started tanking again</a>. The index is now rising to new post-crash depths. </p>
<p>10. On the other hand, I suspect Brad DeLong might nominate <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2011/03/greg-mankiw-budget-arsonist-screaming-for-a-firehose.html">Greg Mankiw</a> for some sort of award among the signatories of the letter and its hard to disagree with him. FYI &#8211; my views on debt haven&#8217;t changed since <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2007/12/republican-party-and-national-debt.html">this</a>. </p>
<p>Which leads to another look at the figure I put up earlier, this time color coded by the party of the President in office. <a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-x8YitF78KcQ/TZnnHNDDzoI/AAAAAAAAAkk/6J4HAKUHEcQ/s1600/CEA_chairs2.bmp"><img border="0" alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-x8YitF78KcQ/TZnnHNDDzoI/AAAAAAAAAkk/6J4HAKUHEcQ/s320/CEA_chairs2.bmp"></a>Figure 2 </p>
<p>And one more thing&#8230; as Michael Kanell and I wrote in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Presimetrics-Facts-Presidents-Measure-Issues/dp/1579128351/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&#038;qid=1301779800&#038;sr=8-1">Presimetrics</a>, sooner or later &#8220;Democrats who make it to the Oval Office [will] realize that they are going to be tarred as fiscally irresponsible no matter what, so why make the tough decisions that Republican presidents have refused to make in recent decades?&#8221; I guess after Ford, Reagan and the two Bushes, an Obama has come home to roost.</p>

<p><strong>Japan:  The Post-WW2 Rise, the 1980s Peak, and the Decline &#8211; A Simple Theory</strong><br />Cross-posted at the <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=393&#038;preview=true">Presimetrics blog</a>.</p>
<p>A lot has been written about the disaster in Japan. I don&#8217;t have much I can add to that, except that like everyone else (or at least everyone civilized), I am so very sorry that it happened.  (What is with the folks talking about Pearl Harbor?  Seriously.  What is that about?)</p>
<p>Still, in reading about the tragedy, I had a thought about Japanese economic history and I&#8217;d like to expand on it in this post.  But I&#8217;d like to lead off by pointing out I am not an expert on Japan.  That means y&#8217;all can feel free to correct me where I&#8217;m wrong, but it also means I started off by going to <a href="http://countrystudies.us/">this website</a>, which has some cool country studies.  The website:</p>
<blockquote><p>contains the on-line versions of books previously published in hard copy by the Federal Research Division of the Library of Congress as part of the Country Studies/Area Handbook Series sponsored by the U.S. Department of the Army between 1986 and 1998. Each study offers a comprehensive description and analysis of the country or region&#8217;s historical setting, geography, society, economy, political system, and foreign policy.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let me start by quoting liberally from <a href="http://countrystudies.us/japan/123.htm">Japan country study</a>m specifically the section on bureaucrats.  <br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<blockquote><p>Although the United States occupation dismantled both the military and zaibatsu establishments, it did little, outside of abolishing the prewar Home Ministry, to challenge the power of the bureaucracy. There was considerable continuity&#8211;in institutions, operating style, and personnel&#8211; between the civil service before and after the occupation, partly because MacArthur&#8217;s staff ruled indirectly and depended largely on the cooperation of civil servants. A process of mutual co-optation occurred. </p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>In trying to discover &#8220;who&#8217;s in charge here,&#8221; many analysts have pointed to the elite bureaucracy as the people who really govern Japan, although they composed only a tiny fraction of the country&#8217;s more than 1 million national government employees. Several hundred of the elite are employed at each national ministry or agency. Although entry into the elite through open examinations does not require a college degree, the majority of its members are alumni of Japan&#8217;s most prestigious universities. The University of Tokyo Law Faculty is the single most important source of elite bureaucrats. After graduation from college and, increasingly, some graduate-level study, applicants take a series of extremely difficult higher civil service examinations: in 1988, for example, 28,833 took the tests, but only 1,814, or 6.3 percent, were successful. Of those who were successful, only 721 were actually hired. Like the scholar-officials of imperial China, successful candidates were hardy survivors of a grueling education and testing process that necessarily began in early childhood and demanded total concentration. The typical young bureaucrat, who is in most cases male, is an intelligent, hardworking, and dedicated individual. Some bureaucrats lack imagination and, perhaps, compassion for people whose way of life is different from their own.</p>
<p>The public&#8217;s attitude toward the elite is ambivalent. The elite enjoy tremendous social prestige, but members are also resented. They live in a realm that is at least partly public yet far removed from the lives of ordinary people. Compared with politicians, they are generally viewed as honest. Involvement of top officials in scandals such as the Recruit affair, however, had, to some extent, tarnished their image.</p>
<p>Japan&#8217;s elite bureaucrats are insulated from direct political pressure because there are very few political appointments in the civil service. Cabinet ministers are usually career politicians, but they are moved in and out of their posts quite frequently (with an average tenure of under a year), and usually have little opportunity to develop a power base within a ministry or force their civil service subordinates to adopt reforms. Below the cabinet minister is the administrative vice minister. Administrative vice ministers and their subordinates are career civil servants whose appointments are determined in accordance with an internally established principle of seniority.</p>
<p>In a 1975 article, political scientist Chalmers Johnson quotes a retired vice minister of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) who said that the Diet was merely &#8220;an extension of the bureaucracy.&#8221; The official claimed that &#8220;the bureaucracy drafts all the laws&#8230;. All the legislature does is to use its powers of investigation, which for about half the year keeps most of the senior officials cooped up in the Diet.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>And now the change&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Administrative reform policies in the 1980s imposed ceilings on civil service staff and spending that probably contributed to a deterioration of morale and working conditions.</p>
<p>Still another factor limiting bureaucratic power was the emergence of an affluent society. In the early postwar period, the scarcity of capital made it possible for the Ministry of Finance and MITI to exert considerable influence over the economy through control of the banking system. To a decreasing extent, this scarcity remained until the 1980s because most major companies had high debt-equity ratios and depended on the banks for infusions of capital. Their huge profits and increasing reliance on securities markets in the late 1980s, however, meant that the Ministry of Finance had less influence. The wealth, technical sophistication, and new confidence of the companies also made it difficult for MITI to exercise administrative guidance. The ministry could not restrain aggressive and often politically controversial purchases by Japanese corporate investors in the United States, such as Mitsubishi Estate&#8217;s October 1989 purchase of Rockefeller Center in New York City, which, along with the Sony Corporation&#8217;s acquisition of Columbia Pictures several weeks earlier, heated up trade friction between the two countries.</p>
<p>The whole issue of trade friction and foreign pressure tended to politicize the bureaucracy and promote unprecedented divisiveness in the late 1980s and early 1990s. During the Structural Impediments Initiative talks held by Japan and the United States in early 1990, basic changes in Japan&#8217;s economy were discussed: reforms of the distribution and pricing systems, improvement of the infrastructure, and elimination of official procedures that limited foreign participation in the economy. Although foreign pressure of this sort is resented by many Japanese as an intrusion on national sovereignty, it also provides an opportunity for certain ministries to make gains at the expense of others. There is hardly a bureaucratic jurisdiction in the economic sphere that is not in some sense affected.</p>
<p>Repeatedly, internationally minded political and bureaucratic elites found their market-opening reforms, designed to placate United States demands, sabotaged by other interests, especially agriculture. Such reactions intensified United States pressure, which in turn created a sense of crisis and a siege mentality within Japan. The &#8220;internationalization&#8221; of Japan&#8217;s society in other ways also divided the bureaucratic elite. MITI, the Ministry of Labor, and the Ministry of Justice had divergent views on how to respond to the influx of unskilled, usually South Asian and Southeast Asian, laborers into the labor-starved Japanese economy. </p></blockquote>
<p>Now a bit from <a href="http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft7t1nb5d6;brand=ucpress">Japan&#8217;s Administrative Elite</a> by B C Koh(see pages 259, 260):</p>
<blockquote><p>A decline in elitism can be seen in a number of trends: (1) a strong showing of universities other than Todai and Kyodai in the higher civil-service examination, (2) a notable increase in the proportion of private-university graduates who enter the higher civil service, and (3) advancement of &#8220;noncareer&#8221; bureaucrats to elite administrative positions.</p>
<p>Although Todai and Kyodai have consistently maintained their positions as the first- and second-largest sources, respectively, of successful candidates in the higher civil-service examination throughout the postwar period, their combined share of the total has frequently fallen short of 50 percent. In the eighteen-year period from 1970 to 1987, for example, the two top universities&#8217; share fell below the 50-percent mark eleven times (see table 9 in chapter 4). This means that the majority of successful candidates in the higher civil-service examination came from other institutions of higher learning in those years. In the 1980s, private universities surpassed the 10-percent mark for the first time, reaching 12.6 percent by 1986 and 13 percent in 1987. In the ten-year period from 1976 to 1985 the number of private-university graduates who passed the higher civil-service examination increased 3.5 times.[6]</p>
<p>If we examine the situation at the hiring stage, we find the same trend: a steady increase in the proportion of private-university graduates. Since 1980, private-university graduates who passed the higher civil-service examination had a greater probability of being hired than graduates of national universities. In 1983 and 1984, six in ten of the former, as compared with four in ten of the latter, were hired. In the ten-year period from 1976 to 1985, the number of private-university graduates who entered the higher civil service quadrupled.[7]</p>
<p>A slight decline in the elitist character of Japan&#8217;s higher civil service is suggested by a steady increase in the number of &#8220;noncareer&#8221; civil servants who advance to elite administrative positions. As we saw in chapter 4 (table 8), graduates of the intermediate civil-service examination began to appear in grade-1 positions (assistant bureau chief, division chief, and senior-level section chief) in increasing numbers since 1974; in 1981, a graduate of the lower examination attained grade 1 for the first time, and a small but growing number of others followed in his footsteps in subsequent years. By 1986, the National Personnel Authority disclosed that two in ten civil servants at the rank of section chief or its equivalent and above in the national government had not gone beyond junior colleges, implying that they were &#8220;noncareer&#8221; bureaucrats.</p></blockquote>
<p>So&#8230;  a decade before the end of Japan&#8217;s economic miracle, the fabled bureaucracy that drove Japan Inc. started to erode &#8211; more of its members started coming from lower quality, private universities, it stopped being held in as high esteem by the public, it lost its ability to impose its will on the economy, and to boot (or perhaps I should say on a related note), it started to adopt new policies and philosophies being pushed by the Reagan administration.  How long do you think it takes for something like that to have a long-term, possibly irreversible effect on an economy that used to be the envy of the world?</p>
<p>As an aside&#8230; ever notice how countries that adopt policies favored by right wing or libertarian think-tanks tend to have a few very successful years (with much crowing by those think tanks) followed by disaster?  Be it Japan, Argentina, Russia, much of Eastern Europe, Ireland, Iceland, etc., it does seem that there&#8217;s a pattern.  Heck, that pattern even <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=374">applies to the US</a>. I think even some of the promoters of those policies are starting to see that pattern.  Its to the point where a lot of folks in those circles are trying to convince the public that Singapore, a country where the government&#8217;s role in the economy is larger and more intrusive than in most other countries, is an example of a libertarian paradise.</p>
