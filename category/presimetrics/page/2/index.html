<p>Taxes and Economic Growth:  Real World &#038; Simulations</p>
<p>   Over the past few years, I&#8217;ve posted many times on an unpleasant reality:  despite the fact that so many people believe otherwise, in general, lower taxes do not result in faster economic growth.   It is really too bad, because we could all be better off if only lower tax rates led to faster economic growth.  However, the association between slower econoimc growth and lower tax rates is something we can see in data from the US, whether we use national level data, state and local data, or anything in between.     </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a post I wrote not that long ago noting that when top marginal tax rates are below about 65% or so, <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/10/laffer-curve-and-kimel-curve.html">cutting taxes is associated with slower economic growth and raising taxes is associated with faster economic growth</a>.  Here&#8217;s something <a href="http://www.voxeu.org/index.php?q=node/7402">a bit more academic showing the same thing</a>.    </p>
<p>As I&#8217;ve noted before, there&#8217;s a logical reason why lowering top marginal rates slows economic growth (except when top marginal rates are very high), and it should be obvious to anyone who has ever run a business:  the easiest way to avoid, or at least postpone paying taxes for is not to show taxable income.  If your business looks like it will show a profit, reinvest the revenues, pushing up costs and voila, you don&#8217;t have any profits for the IRS to tax.  But, by doing so, you are also strengthening the company, which means setting the stage for faster growth in later years.  And you&#8217;re more likely to follow this strategy, rather than consume your profits, the higher the tax rate.   <br /><a name="more"></a>Notice that this little story depends entirely on the self-interest of people in the economy.  Money collected in taxes could be put in a big hole and burned, and the story would still work.  (Of course, the story works better if whatever is collected in taxes is actually used productively, but that isn&#8217;t a requirement.)</p>
<p>The response I&#8217;ve gotten via e-mail and commentary comes overwhelmingly in two flavors: a.  You lie about the data and you don&#8217;t understand how people react to changes in tax rates. b.  That may be what the data shows, but it can&#8217;t possibly work in theory so it must be wrong.   </p>
<p>I can&#8217;t help the group folks in group a &#8211; I&#8217;ve offered up my spreadsheets, and frankly, anyone should be able to replicate it &#8211; this stuff ain&#8217;t rocket science.  But this post is for the folks in the second group.</p>
<p>For grins and giggles, yesterday I made a simple little simulation tool in Excel which is intended to look at the behavior of a very wealthy person reacting to changes in tax rates.  In any given period, the person consumes some percentage of the wealth they happen to have.  The remainder, the savings, are allowed to grow.   Individuals get a benefit from both consumption and holding wealth.</p>
<p> Their goal is, given the tax rate, to maximize the discounted weighted consumption &#038; wealth over all the periods of their working life.   I set tax rates at 0%, 10%, 20%, &#8230;  90%, and used Excel&#8217;s solver tool to determine the percentage of wealth they will select under each tax rate.</p>
<p>    Results are as follows:   </p>
<div><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-TYUPTao4r4Y/T6H1RSEKM8I/AAAAAAAAA10/_gNptJON56Q/s1600/Simulation%252C_Taxes_%2526_Growth.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="210" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-TYUPTao4r4Y/T6H1RSEKM8I/AAAAAAAAA10/_gNptJON56Q/s320/Simulation%252C_Taxes_%2526_Growth.jpg" width="320"></a></div>
<p>Figure 1         </p>
<p>Given the parameters selected, here&#8217;s what we find:  the higher the tax rates, the lower the less of their wealth people consume in any given period and overall.  However, the greater the wealth they accumulate&#8230;  which is essentially the story I&#8217;ve been telling to explain the data.   As noted previously, in general, higher taxes lead to faster economic growth.   </p>
<p>A few additional comments: <br />a.  The simulation is simplistic, and it does not show the quadratic relationship between taxation and growth we see in the real world data.  I believe that this can be resolved simply by taking into account satiation resulting from consumption. <br />b.  The simulation indicates that increasing tax rates makes people worse off (the discounted sum of the weighted wealth and consumption tends to be lower for higher tax rates).   <br />b. i.  However, they leave behind more wealth.  Put another way &#8211; individuals in any given period are made worse off, but their descendants are made better off.  <br />b. ii.  A more realistic scenario probably shows increased returns as wealth increases.  (Mr. Romney, to use one example, has investment options available to him that you and I do not, and Mr. Buffett has options available to him that Mr. Romney does not.) Higher taxes might very well make a person worse off today but better off in the long run.  Its great to live during the Gilded Age, a period during which tax rates fell from 75% to 24%&#8230; provided you die before the effect of the Gilded Age spits out the Great Depression.  <br />c.  Because of the way taxes are defined in this model, they play a similar role to compulsory savings.  Put another way:  this model can also explain countries with relatively low taxes but compulsory savings, such as Singapore.   <br />d.  The model also explains Tyler Cowen&#8217;s Great Stagnation.   <br />e.  Government spending does produce a benefit, though that is ignored by this model.     </p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t decided whether I want to spend time improving the simulation tool, but, as usual, if anyone wants my spreadsheet, drop me a line.  I&#8217;m at my first name (mike), my last name (kime), at gmail.</p>

<p>Explaining Why Low Tax Rates are Correlated with Slower Economic Growth, Once Again  </p>
<p>One of the regular mysteries facing economists is why the US economy fails to display evidence of a relationship that everyone seems to accept implicitly, namely that lower taxes lead to (or even are correlated with) faster economic growth.  Sure, the argument is sometimes made by academics using rather heroic assumptions.  The paper everyone seems to cite these days uses the assumptions made by politicians before a change in the tax rate as the &#8220;effect&#8221; that actually occurred after the change in the tax rate.   Non-academics rely on other heroic assumptions.  My favorite is attributing the rapid growth during the three years of the Kennedy administration to a cut in tax rates that occurred the year after he died.  (Actually, even Alan Greenspan made this one well before he made the transition from Maestro to goat.)     </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve taken a crack at explaining that puzzle, most recently <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/12/simple-explanation-for-strange-paradox.html">here</a>:   <br />
<blockquote>people will want to minimize their tax burden at any given time subject provided it doesn&#8217;t decrease their lifetime consumption of stuff plus holdings of wealth. Put another way &#8211; all else being equal, peoples&#8217; incentive to avoid/evade taxes is higher when tax rates are higher, and that incentive decreases when tax rates go down. Additionally, most people&#8217;s behavior, frankly, is not affected by &#8220;normal&#8221; changes to tax rates; raise or lower the tax rates of someone getting a W-2 and they can&#8217;t exactly change the amount of work they do as a result. However, there are some people, most of whom have high actual or potential incomes and/or a relatively large amount of wealth, for whom things are different. For these people, some not insignificant amount of their income in any year comes from &#8220;investments&#8221; or from the sort of activities for which paychecks can be dialed up or down relatively easily. (I assume none of this is controversial.) <br /><a name="more"></a>Now, consider the plight of a person who makes a not insignificant amount of their income in any year comes from &#8220;investments&#8221; or from the sort of activities for which paychecks can be dialed up or down relatively easily, and who wants to reduce their tax burden this year in a way that won&#8217;t reduce their total more or less smoothed lifetime consumption of stuff and holdings of wealth. How do they do that? Well, a good accountant can come up with a myriad of ways, but in the end, there’s really one method that reigns supreme, and that is reinvesting the proceeds of one’s income-generating activities back into those income-generating activities. (i.e., reinvest in the business.) But ceteris paribus, reinvesting in the business… generates more income in the future, which is to say, it leads to faster economic growth.  To restate, higher tax rates increase in the incentives to reduce one’s taxable income by investing more in future growth.</p></blockquote>
<p>Restating again:  when the tax rate is 75%, a business owner has a strong incentive to reinvest all his/her profits in the business rather than take those profits out and consume them.  This is because reinvesting in the business means the profits aren&#8217;t pulled out and thus aren&#8217;t recognized as income by the IRS.  Reinvesting in the business also increases the business&#8217; chances to do well in future years, which generates growth for the economy.  On the other hand, when the tax rate is 15%, there is more of an incentive to take out profits and engage in consumption of the type that does not generate much growth.     </p>
<p><a href="http://uneasymoney.com/2012/04/03/why-low-marginal-tax-rates-might-have-harmful-side-effects/">David Glasner</a> has another (albeit complementary) suggestion:   <br />
<blockquote>The connection it seems to me is that doing the kind of research necessary to come up with information that traders can put to profitable use requires very high cognitive and analytical skills, skills associated with success in mathematics, engineering, applied and pure scientific research. In addition, I am also positing that, at equal levels of remuneration, most students would choose a career in one of the latter fields over a career in finance. Indeed, I would suggest that most students about to embark on a career would choose a career in the sciences, technology, or engineering over a career in finance even if it meant a sacrifice in income.  </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>If for someone with the mental abilities necessary to pursue a successful career in science or technology, requires what are called compensating differences in remuneration, then the higher the marginal tax rate, the greater the compensating difference in pre-tax income necessary to induce prospective job candidates to choose a career in finance. So reductions in marginal tax rates in the 1980s enabled the financial sector to bid away talented young people from other occupations and sectors who would otherwise have pursued careers in science and technology. The infusion of brain power helped the financial sector improve the profitability of its trading operations, profits that came at the expense of less sophisticated financial firms and unprofessional traders, encouraging a further proliferation of products to trade and of strategies for trading them.</p></blockquote>

<p>In recent years, there have been a number of studies showing that generational income mobility is particularly low in the US.  To quote <a href="http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2006/04/Hertz_MobilityAnalysis.pdf">this 2006 study</a> by Tom Hertz:<br />
<blockquote>By international standards, the United States has an unusually low level of intergenerational mobility: our parents’ income is highly predictive of our incomes as adults. Intergenerational mobility in the United States is lower than in France, Germany, Sweden, Canada, Finland, Norway and Denmark.  Among high-income countries for which comparable estimates are available, only the United Kingdom had a lower rate of mobility than the United States.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hertz provides this handy chart:
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-qLnx95e3mfg/TwE8F4W8uVI/AAAAAAAAAtk/lynBeV_4wnI/s1600/Figure%2B1.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-qLnx95e3mfg/TwE8F4W8uVI/AAAAAAAAAtk/lynBeV_4wnI/s320/Figure%2B1.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Most of the &#8220;big government&#8221; countries that compare favorably with the US on intergenerational mobility also do pretty well on measures of entrepreneurship.  The following snapshot comes from <a href="http://archive.sba.gov/advo/research/rs370tot.pdf">this paper by Acs and Szerb</a>:</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-LNSxHoBIdaw/TwE8UyvSbyI/AAAAAAAAAtw/gYovdCYLrnk/s1600/Figure%2B2.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-LNSxHoBIdaw/TwE8UyvSbyI/AAAAAAAAAtw/gYovdCYLrnk/s320/Figure%2B2.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />(GEDI = Global Entrepreneurship and Development Index)</p>
<p>While studies are, no doubt, imperfect, I&#8217;ve seen similar results before and they seem credible to me.<br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>The studies note, essentially, that the US is not, for many, the land of opportunity it is touted to be, and is now being beaten out by countries like Denmark and Canada.  Big government countries, countries where Americans seem to believe people aren&#8217;t motivated to get off their duff, are actually quite entrepreneurial and offer offer their citizens a lot of opportunity.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, one other thing to note&#8230;  growth, real economic growth, has been slowing for decades in the US. George W Bush&#8217;s term, even prior to the start of the Great Recession, <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/12/random-observation-about-1970s-and.html">compares unfavorably with the 1970s.</a>    The highly touted Reagan years, for instance, saw much slower growth than, say, the big government LBJ administration or the even bigger government New Deal years.</p>
<p>What is going on here?  Is it really the catch-up effect, whereby wealthy countries like the US necessarily grow more slowly than other countries?  Or is there a Great Stagnation going on?  And if so, why?</p>
<p>I think one explanation for this is the Peltzman effect.  Sam Peltzman once noted that, in response to some types of regulation, people can have a tendency to change their behavior in ways that counteracts the intended purpose of the regulation.  For instance, some bicycle and motorcycle riders will take greater risks when forced to wear helmets, assuming that the helmets make them safer and more impervious to accidents.</p>
<p>Now, economic advance depends on creative destruction, and creative destruction requires people to take risks.  Come up with a great idea for a super duper new widget and it has zero effect on anything if you don&#8217;t go out and try to market the thing.</p>
<p>But take two people, both of whom independently came up with the same idea for that super duper new widget. One lives in the US, the other in Denmark.  Which one gives up his/her job to start a new company?  The American or the Dane?   My guess is the Dane will, precisely because the Dane, unlike the American, retains a safety net.  The Dane doesn&#8217;t give up health insurance for herself or her family, and has more social programs she can rely on if the new business fails.  My guess is that isn&#8217;t just true for Danes and Canadians, but also for people in a whole host of countries with a stronger safety net than the US.  If the US still scores higher than on entrepreneurship than these countries, it is for historical reasons.  Attitude is part of the ranking, after all, and Horatio Alger stories are still in our DNA.</p>
<p>If my guess is correct, there are things we should expect to see in US data:</p>
<ol>
<li>The ratio of American companies, particularly successful American companies which required substantial commitments by their founders, that are founded by foreign born people relative to native born people has been growing.  (I.e., native born Americans are becoming more risk averse when it comes to starting companies.)</p>
</li>
<li>The ratio of American companies, particularly successful American companies which required substantial commitments by their founders, that are founded by native born people who were born wealthy (and thus have their own built in safety net) relative to those founded by native born people who weren&#8217;t born wealthy has been growing.    (I.e., non-wealthy Americans are becoming more risk-averse when it comes to starting companies.)</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that I am trying to distinguish between a &#8220;business&#8221; and a business that requires some substantial commitments by their founders.   There is a big difference between someone leaving their existing employer to start a new business based on an idea they have been toying with for a while and someone who was fired six months earlier deciding that they have no choice but to start something, anything, to put food on the table.  I don&#8217;t have that data, but I would be surprised if it 1 and 2 weren&#8217;t borne out.  Unfortunately, I think the direction we are taking, politically, is just going to reduce entrepreneurship in this country more and more.  There are only so many wealthy people, and only so many foreigners coming to our shores.  The land of opportunity, we will find in the long run, is the one with a safety net.</p>

<p>A Random Observation About the 1970s&#8230; and the 1980s</p>
<p>People often point to the stagnation of the 1970s, and the Reagan administration that followed, as evidence that cutting taxes leads to faster economic growth.    But the same folks rarely look at the flip-side of things, and when they do, they don&#8217;t reach consistent conclusions.  Here&#8217;s an example of what I mean.  Real GDP grew 14.5% from the first quarter of 2003 to the last quarter of 2007.  That is a 20 quarter period.  I started with 2003 because that&#8217;s the year that tax rates dropped to 35%, and it was also more than a full year after the 2001 recession.  I picked the last quarter of 2007 as the end point because the economy peaked in that quarter.</p>
<p>What followed, of course, was the Great Recession.  2003 Q1 to 2007 Q4 were the years of the Greenspan Put, and the real estate bubble.  If it isn&#8217;t clear, I am cherry-picking, purposely selecting a period that best showcases the the 35% top marginal income tax rate era.   <br /><a name="more"></a>Now, 14.5% growth over 20 quarters lacks context.  So here&#8217;s context.  Take any consecutive 20 quarters beginning no earlier than Q1 of 1970 and ending in Q4 of 1980.  There are 25 such periods.  Only seven of them, or 28% of those periods, saw real growth rates below 14.5%.  72% of those periods had real GDP growth rates above 14.5%.  (It is worth noting that four of those seven periods began in 1970 or Q1 of 1971 and that Carter didn&#8217;t take office until Q1 of 1977.)</p>
<p>Now, the 1970s were the decade of the Oil Embargo, the Iranian Revolution, inflation, stagflation, polyester, the Bee Gees and big sideburns.  Big sideburns for crying out loud.  They were also an era with top marginal tax rates of 70%.  And yet, they compare very favorably to the best years we&#8217;ve seen since tax rates fell to 35%.</p>
<p>Now&#8230; let us discuss a more recent period.  Reagan famously cut taxes  &#8211; top rates were at 70% when he took office, and by 1986 were down to 50%.  In 1987 they were cut to 38.5%, and then to 28% in 1988.  They rose slightly to 31% in 1991.  Finally, under Clinton, in 1993, top marginal tax rates rose to 39.6%.  So we&#8217;d expect exceptionally rapid growth from 1987, ending around 1993, right?  Well, pick any quarter from 1986 Q1 to 1991 Q4 and consider the growth in real GDP over a twenty quarter period.  Every single one comes in with growth in real GDP below 14.5%.</p>
<p>That is, every single one under-performs the period that under-performs the 1970s.  (I guess we can say those periods were under-performing squared.)   The conclusion is clear, but I&#8217;m sure it is different to folks on different ends of the political spectrum.</p>

<p>A Modest Forecast:  The Average Real Growth in Ireland will Exceed 10% a Year From 2012 to 2014</p>
<p> You read the title correctly:  the Irish economy will grow by more than 10% next year.  Now, hearing that, you might be asking yourself:  &#8220;Is this guy for real?  He must be nuts.&#8221;</p>
<p> Because I&#8217;ve looked around and nobody is predicting that sort of growth for Ireland for the next few years.   So let me lay out ten facts that should make it obvious to just about everyone:</p>
<p>1.  According to the <a href="http://www.cso.ie/px/pxeirestat/Statire/SelectVarVal/saveselections.asp">Central Statistics Office</a> of Ireland, real GDP (measured in 2009 Euros) peaked at 45,583 million Euros in the fourth quarter of 2007.  It bottomed out in the fourth quarter of 2010 at 39,403 million Euros.  That is, real GDP fell by 13.5%.  Since then, GDP has barely budged.  So its safe to call 2011, four years after the peak, as a year when the bottom out process was ongoing.</p>
<p>2.  According to the OECD, <a href="http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/46/18/2506453.xls">Ireland&#8217;s all in top marginal tax rates are about 52.1%</a>.</p>
<p>3.  According to the <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/xls/gdplev.xls">BEA</a>, real GDP (measured in 2005 dollars) was 976.1 billion in 1929. It reached a nadir of 715.8 billion in 1933, amounting to a drop of 26.6%.  Note that while growth was negative in 1933 (four years after the peak), it was just a small drop.  The bulk of the decrease occurred from 1929 to 1932.   </p>
<p>4.  According to the <a href="http://www.blogger.com/www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/histab23.xls">IRS</a>, the top Federal marginal tax rate was 63% in 1934, and it rose to 79% in 1936.  Note that this wasn&#8217;t an &#8220;all in&#8221; rate.</p>
<p>5.  According to the BEA, <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/xls/gdpchg.xls">real economic growth in the US</a> in 1934, 1935 and 1936 was 10.9%, 8.9% and 13.1%.  The annualized rate of growth from 1933 to 1938, years which I&#8217;m cherry-picking to show some relatively poor growth, was 6.7% a year.   <br /><a name="more"></a>6.  FDR instituted a number of large scale programs.  For instance, <a href="http://www.indiana.edu/~liblilly/wpa/wpa_info.html">[b]y March, 1936, the WPA rolls had reached a total of more than 3,400,000 persons</a>.  For comparison,  according to the BEA&#8217;s <a href="http://www.bea.gov/iTable/iTable.cfm?ReqID=9&#038;step=1">NIPA Table 7.1</a>, the entire population of the US in 1936 was 128.181 million.  Thus, 2.7% of the US population was employed in the WPA alone.  Throw in the CCC, the Rural Electrification Administration, the TVA, and I think we can all agree that the Federal government was playing a big role in the economy.</p>
<p>7.  Many eminent worthies, too many to name, in fact tell us that the rapid growth in the economy from 1933 to 1940 was due to the bounce-back in the economy.  They also tell us that the economy would have recovered much more quickly if FDR had not followed socialist policies.</p>
<p>8.  Ireland doesn&#8217;t have as far to bounce back from as the US did in 1934, implying slower growth in Ireland today than in the US in 1934.</p>
<p> 9.  On the other hand, taxes are much lower in Ireland today than in the US in 1934, and nobody is accusing the Irish today of following socialist policies, implying faster economic growth in Ireland today than in the US in 1934.</p>
<p>10.  Facts 8 and 9 probably cancel each other out, leaving us to expect, on average, about the same growth rate in Ireland over the next few years as we saw in the US during the New Deal years when FDR ruined the economy.</p>
<p>As the eggheads say, QED.  </p>
<p>What&#8217;s nice about this is that we will see rapid growth in other countries too.  Taxes are much lower in the US now then they were during the New Deal years, and for all the cries of socialism and whatnot, there is WPA or CCC or Rural Electrification Program.  Heck, even the Fed doesn&#8217;t seem to want to do anything about jobs and that&#8217;s part of its mandate.   Back to the eggheads for a moment.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a bunch of them who think the New Deal helped the economy, that lower taxes don&#8217;t generate faster economic growth or that its a good idea for the government go out and buy stuff to boost demand at times of economic weakness.  Boy are those folks about to be surprised by the magic of the free market and low taxes.    &#8212;  <a href="http://art-bin.com/art/omodest.html">Disclosure</a>: <br />

<p>American v. Brazilian Healthcare, a Continuing Series</p>
<p>I spoke to my sister on Skype last night.  She&#8217;s been in Natal, in Northeastern Brazil, for the past few months.   Last week, she noticed a couple small warts growing on her leg.  So she wandered down to a government run hospital and and had them removed.  The hospital was low on supplies, and the doctor asked her to contribute a box of Q-tips (since Q-tips would be needed in the procedure).  The total cost of the whole thing:  12 reais, or about $6.60 American, plus a box of Q-tips.  </p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t the first time I&#8217;ve had a post that dealt with my sister and the Brazilian health care system.  A few years ago I wrote about the time she had <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2007/12/american-medical-system-one-persons.html">emergency open heart surgery</a> in Brazil, and how it compared very favorably with her experience with (planned) open heart surgery in the US.  <br /><a name="more"></a><br />Now, on the subject of the US, my wife also has an interesting healthcare story to relate.  She got a letter from Aetna, her insurance provider, indicating they didn&#8217;t know why they were being asked to pay for services when she doesn&#8217;t have health insurance through them.  Interestingly enough, money is withdrawn from our bank account each month to pay for her health insurance, and a call to Aetna indicated that she did, in fact, have health insurance.  A number of phone calls back and forth between my wife, Aetna, and her doctor resolved the issue (I think) &#8211; the doctor is being paid, etc.  But it isn&#8217;t the first time this has happened, and it serves to follow up our family&#8217;s <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/09/health-insurance-american-style.html">earlier experience with health insurance</a>.  All told, I would estimate my wife and I have spent about 40 hours &#8211; that would be a workweek &#8211; dealing with health insurance since July.  </p>
<p>Brazil is a poor country, and I don&#8217;t think anyone has ever suggested that the Brazilian health system is the best in the world.  On the other hand, we often hear precisely that about the American system from certain circles, despite the astounding cost (which doesn&#8217;t seem to include the waste of time dealing with the paperwork or fighting with health insurance companies) and ho-hum outcomes.  I&#8217;m starting to think a lot of Americans are absolutely insane.  Lord knows it would explain a lot.</p>

<p>A Simple Question about NGDP Targeting</p>
<p>It seems that a big part of the econosphere these days talks about NGDP targeting.  Translating this into English, a number of economists believe the Fed should be adjusting monetary policy to achieve a desired level of nominal GDP in any given year.  To be very precise, both the economese and the English should be adjusted slightly to explain what is really meant:  the Fed should be adjusting monetary policy to achieve a given desired rate of nominal GDP in any given year</p>
<p>To me there are two very obvious problems with this.  The first should be evident to anyone who ever spent time in South America in the 1970s or 1980s, or has so much as heard of, say, Zimbabwe or the Weimar Republic:  why should the Fed or anyone else care about nominal growth rates?  Nominal figures are useful for <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2007/01/in-my-opinion-thomas-sowell-is-hack.html">Sowellizing</a>, which apparently can be very profitable, but in the end, only inflation adjusted figures tells us whether we&#8217;re better off or not.  </p>
<p>But there is a second problem, <a name="more"></a>  and the easiest way to state it is by analogy.  Think of the Fed as the quarterback on an American football team.  I don&#8217;t much like American football, but it is evident that the goal of a quarterback is not to throw a specific number of completed passes, or even to get certain score the board.  The goal is to do what it takes to win the game.  Getting 28 points doesn&#8217;t help you if the other team walks away with 35.  On the other hand, 28 to 21 achieves the quarterback&#8217;s goal nicely.  (And of course, whether 28 points looks impressive or not depends on a number things, including the condition of your teammates and the other team&#8217;s defense.)  For a good quarterback, winning the game sometimes means mostly staying out of the way, while at other times it means taking charge.  But specific measurable numbers mean nothing in the end. </p>
<p>Now, the Fed has a dual mandate (imposed by law):  set policy to maximize employment and keep prices stable.  Of course, the two goals conflict to some extent.  Stable prices means keeping inflation rates at about zero, which nobody advocates as it would generate slow economic growth (and thus low levels of employment).  Maximizing employment could be accomplishing economic growth rates, but the Fed often tries to slow down growth rates in order to prevent the onset of inflation.  </p>
<p>The Fed is left with something that loosely translates as this:  &#8220;try to get the economy to grow as quickly as possible without setting off too much inflation.&#8221;  It accomplishes that goal to a greater or lesser extent at different times.  </p>
<p>But given the number of moving parts out there, that seems to be a much easier, and much more logical approach than saying:  let&#8217;s shoot for a 3% increase in nominal GDP this year.  </p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>Lest this post be seen as a defense of the way the Fed does its job, I should note:  I personally think the Fed has been doing a very poor job for quite a while, and some of my earliest posts are criticisms of the Fed.  I&#8217;m especially horrified by the Fed&#8217;s approach to the economic mess we&#8217;re in &#8211; as I&#8217;ve been noting since 2008, ensuring that institutions with insane and harmful business models survive to engage in more spectacularly bad behavior is no way to help the economy, and that is true whether one has NGDP targets or not.</p>

<p>The Numbers Behind Newt&#8217;s Plan to Balance the Budget</p>
<p>Newt Gingrich&#8217;s website provides information on <a href="http://www.newt.org/solutions/jobs-economy">The Gingrich Jobs and Prosperity Plan</a>.  It starts with this:  </p>
<blockquote><p>America only works when Americans are working. Newt has a pro-growth strategy similar to the proven policies used when he was Speaker to balance the budget, pay down the debt, and create jobs. </p></blockquote>
<p>Excellent.  That statement should be enough to get an idea of what the program will look like.  I want to focus on the first piece:  balancing the budget. (You can&#8217;t pay down the debt unless you run a surplus, so balancing the budget also deals with that issue.)</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what the surplus / GDP looks like for the years from 1988 to 2004.  The gray bar covers the years from 1995 (the Republican Revolution took office, and Newt Gingrich became speaker in 1995) to 1998 (Gingrich resigned as speaker in November 1998.)</p>
<p>(Incidentally &#8211; the surplus is simply Total Federal Receipts less Total Federal Expenditures, which come from lines 37 and 40 of the BEA&#8217;s <a href="http://www.bea.gov/iTable/iTable.cfm?ReqID=9&#038;step=1">National Income and Product Accounts Table 3.2</a>.  GDP comes also comes from the <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/xls/gdplev.xls">BEA</a>.)</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-nVPk_K2elno/Ttwok_cI9LI/AAAAAAAAAxw/F18FsfQFySY/s1600/Newt_Figure_1.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-nVPk_K2elno/Ttwok_cI9LI/AAAAAAAAAxw/F18FsfQFySY/s320/Newt_Figure_1.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>Figure 1</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>As you can see, the deficit did indeed turn into a surplus when Gingrich was in office.  However, the chart makes it clear the trend began before Newt took office and continued after Newt left office.  In fact, it seems that the deficit started falling in 1993.  The surplus, on the other hand, peaked in the year 2000, fell, and the budget returned to a deficit.  So what defined the years from 1993-2000?  Oh yeah, they were the years Clinton was President.  So Newt is basically saying he would support the policies that produced success in the Clinton years.  </p>
<p>That is wonderful&#8230; those were years of great prosperity.  You have to go back to the JFK &#038; LBJ years to find presidents who oversaw faster growth rates in real GDP.  But let&#8217;s stay focused on the deficit and surplus issue.  In fact, let&#8217;s deconstruct the number into its constituent parts.   Figure 2 shows Total Federal Receipts / GDP and Total Federal Expenditures / GDP.  </p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_c3tYqZvztE/Ttwok0P3RZI/AAAAAAAAAx8/dd7clNlTomc/s1600/Newt_Figure_2.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_c3tYqZvztE/Ttwok0P3RZI/AAAAAAAAAx8/dd7clNlTomc/s320/Newt_Figure_2.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>Figure 2.</p>
<p>As is evident from Figure 2, Total Federal Receipts / GDP hit a low point in 1992 and started to rise in 1993, eventually peaking in the year 2000 and then falling.  Total Federal Expenditures / GDP hit a high point in 1992, then began falling in 1993, eventually hitting a local nadir in 2000 and then starting to rise again.  The trend during the Newt Gingrich years looks like the rest of Clinton years&#8230; well, except for a slight slowing in the rate at which expenditures were dropping.  </p>
<p>Now, you might be thinking that Newt&#8217;s comments about deficit reduction speak more to his views on expenditures than on taxes.  After all, few Republicans talk about increasing the tax burden these days and it would take a lot of guts for Newt to break with his party on this one.  But looking once more at the numbers its obvious Newt really does want Americans to pay more.  </p>
<p>Consider&#8230;  in 1995, Gingrich&#8217;s first year as speaker, federal expenditures were 22% of GDP.In 1998, they were 20% of GDP.  But&#8230;  revenues in 1995 were 19.2% of GDP.  That is to say, had revenues remained at the 1995 level, they would have been less than expenditures and the budget would have still been deficit Newt&#8217;s last year in office (and in fact, in 1999 as well).  But Newt takes credit for balancing the budget.  </p>
<p>Thus&#8230;  by necessity he is taking credit for raising the tax burden on the American people.   Granted, there were no hikes in the marginal rate while he was speaker, but the increase in the tax burden came about with increased enforcement and regulation.  This is a  man with political courage!  This is a man who puts doing the right thing above any thoughts of personal gain! </p>
<p>Now, I&#8217;d like to put the tax hikes that Newt seems to be advocating in context.  For this, I&#8217;m going to steal a graph from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Presimetrics-Facts-Presidents-Measure-Issues/dp/B005HKSK8M/ref=tmm_hrd_title_0">Presimetrics</a>, the book I coauthored with Michael Kanell.  In it, we used a slightly different version of the tax burden:  instead of Federal Revenues / GDP, we looked at the percentage of people&#8217;s income that went to taxes.   We looked at the annualized rate of change of this version of the tax burden for each Congressional administration from 1952 to 2008.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what we found:</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-E20x9DhypGc/TtwollW_ImI/AAAAAAAAAyI/U7x0mQ5Y-HA/s1600/Newt_Figure_3.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-E20x9DhypGc/TtwollW_ImI/AAAAAAAAAyI/U7x0mQ5Y-HA/s320/Newt_Figure_3.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>Figure 3.</p>
<p>As Figure 3 shows, the Republican Revolution (which granted, extended a few years beyond Newt) oversaw the largest (by far!!!) annualized increase in the tax burden of any Congress in several decades!  Because taxes aren&#8217;t that popular with Republicans these days, Newt is downplaying the issue, but he seems to be dogwhistling it for those of with some familiarity with the numbers.  The only alternatives are that he is ignorant of the numbers, or that he is will to obfuscate the facts, but hopefully we can expect more than that from someone running for the highest office in the land.</p>

<p>Peter Diamond, Emmanuel Saez, Paul Krugman and Me!!  Looking at Optimal Tax Rates</p>
<p>Via <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/22/taxing-job-creators/">Paul Krugman</a>, I learned of <a href="http://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.25.4.165">this paper</a> by Peter Diamond and Emmanuel Saez.  Diamond, of course, is a Nobel Laureate.  I will be shocked if Saez isn&#8217;t one too in ten or fifteen years.</p>
<p>Long story made very short, Diamond and Saez jump through a lot of hoops and find that the optimal top marginal income tax rate (all in, that is, including federal, state and local), which they define as maximizing social welfare, is about 73%.  </p>
<p>Now, long time readers may recall I&#8217;ve been doing this sort of analysis for years, though of course I&#8217;ve been looking at tax rates that maximize real GDP growth.  Simply put, you cannot maximize long run social welfare if you aren&#8217;t maximizing economic growth.  <br /><a name="more"></a><br />My approach is much simpler than that followed by Diamond and Saez.  I like to think its much more intuitive and easier to explain.  I note that US data shows a simple quadratic relationship between real GDP growth from one year to the next and tax rates:</p>
<p>growth in real GDP, t to t+1 = f(top marginal tax rate, top marginal tax rate squared, other variables)</p>
<p>One recent post on the topic is <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/12/top-marginal-income-tax-rate-should-be.html">here</a>.   (<a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/10/laffer-curve-and-kimel-curve.html">Unlike the Laffer curve</a>, the coefficients come out statistically significant and with the right signs.)  </p>
<p>I mention all this to note that no matter what I throw into the equation, I find that the top marginal tax rate that maximizes economic growth is somewhere around 65%.  Of course, I&#8217;ve focused only on federal tax rates&#8230; add in state and local it comes pretty close to what Diamond and Saez have found.</p>
<p>As I noted above, my approach is somewhat simpler, and easier to follow than that of Diamond and Saez.  Part of the reason is that they come at it from a point of view of elasticities.  But with all due respect to my betters (Diamond and Saez, and Krugman as well considering the explanation in his post) I think this is the wrong way to consider the problem.  It requires all sorts of assumptions and generalizations about people&#8217;s behavior, some of which are both false and create resistance from folks on the right.  </p>
<p>For example, there is a notion that raising tax rates will reduce people&#8217;s willingness to work&#8230; which is only true above certain thresholds.  (That threshold, of course, varies per individual.)  As anyone who has ever had a business will tell you (when they&#8217;re not busy demanding tax reductions), you don&#8217;t pay taxes on income from the business if you turn around and reinvest that income.  (An accountant would talk to you about decreasing your tax liability by increasing expenses which amounts to the same thing.)  You only pay taxes on that income you take that income out, presumably for consumption purposes.</p>
<p>So to simplify, consider an example&#8230;.  is a successful businessperson more likely to take money out of the business if his/her tax rate is 70% or if its 25%?  In general, a person is more likely to take that money at 25%, as there&#8217;s less of a penalty.  At 70% tax rates, there is more of an incentive to reinvest in the business, creating more growth in the business in subsequent years, and more economic growth thereafter.  70% tax rates are more likely to generate faster economic growth than 25% tax rates precisely because people are self-interested and the higher tax rates induce people to continue investing in things they do well.</p>
<p>(Of course, tax rates can get too high.  At 95%, people will reinvest almost every dime&#8230; even if they have exhausted every good investment opportunity they have.  Thus, to avoid taxes they&#8217;ll be making lousy investments which in turn slow economic growth.)  </p>
<p>Still, its gratifying to see others who are more, er, credentialed doing similar work.  If I might end on a digression, though, I can think of a number of examples of work being done on blogs by people who are essentially hobbyists which is somewhat ahead of the academic literature.  However, to a large extent, if something wasn&#8217;t published in the academic literature, for all practical purposes it didn&#8217;t happen.  Which is a shame, because most of us who aren&#8217;t academics don&#8217;t have time or the resources required for such publication (such as access to econlit).  That inevitably slows economic development three ways:</p>
<p>1.  the lack of recognition discourages hobbyists who have the potential and otherwise would have the willingness to improve on the existing literature<br />2.  should such hobbyists persist and do the research, that research will not be widely disseminated even if it is an improvement over the academic literature<br />3.  it maintains an insular attitude among those who are not hobbyists.  As smart as Diamond, Saez, and Krugman all are, none of them are thinking the way someone running a business thinks of they&#8217;d have realized immediately how people who are running a business react to higher and lower tax rates.  I have read a lot of academic papers on taxation and have yet to stumble on one that gets it right.</p>

<p>And since I always offer&#8230;  if anyone wants any spreadsheets showing the quadratic relationship between tax rates and economic growth or anything else I&#8217;ve done, drop me a line.

<p>The Gold Index, April 1933 &#8211; February 1934, Courtesy of Scott Sumner</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been having a bit of a back and forth with Scott Sumner of <a href="http://www.themoneyillusion.com/">The Money Illusion</a> over the degree to which monetary policy, in particular the devaluation of the dollar, affected the economy in 1933.  (My most recent post on the issue is <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/11/scaling-to-new-depths-with-scott-sumner.html">here</a>.)</p>
<p>In private correspondence, Sumner provided me with the draft for three chapters of a manuscript he is working on.  I can safely say that whether or not I agree with his findings, Sumner has done his homework &#8211; the draft is meticulously researched and abounds with details corroborating his findings.  Of particular interest to me was a Table 8.2, which shows weekly figures for a number of series from April 15, 1933 to the first week of February, 1934.  Sumner has graciously agreed to let me post that table.  I don&#8217;t want to freeride on his efforts to much, so I&#8217;m only reproducing the first few columns.<br /><a name="more"></a><br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-RSjr1SiAFwI/TsVdWgb6RnI/AAAAAAAAAxE/-4rj2Q2mzLY/s1600/Sumner%2527s_Table.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-RSjr1SiAFwI/TsVdWgb6RnI/AAAAAAAAAxE/-4rj2Q2mzLY/s320/Sumner%2527s_Table.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>Figure 1</p>
<p>I believe the most interesting thing in the table is &#8211; what has been the cause of some discussion between the two of us &#8211; is the Gold Index.  From the footnote to the table in the manuscript:</p>
<blockquote><p>The gold index is the Annualist Index of Commodity Prices measured in gold terms. </p></blockquote>
<p>Sumner collected that data manually from old trade journals.  I haven&#8217;t been able to find that data online.  What the data shows, to quote Sumner, is that &#8220;an ounce of gold could buy more internationally traded goods in 1934 than 1933.  That’s what the 815 to 650 is showing—falling prices in gold terms.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a graph of the series:</p>

<p>Addendum <em>by Ken</em>: Here&#8217;s the Gold Index data listed above with the Vertical Axis rescaled:
