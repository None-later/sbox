		<title>At Paul Krugman’s Suggestion, I’m Offering to Sell My Heirloom 1944 Model Oldsmobile to Economist Robert Barro. Rather Than Putting It On Ebay.</title>

<div dir="ltr">Okay, by now y’all know that I’m not an economist.  Nor a statistician.  Nor a mathematician. Nor even someone who can easily understand simple line graphs.  (Bar graphs work for me, though, I’ve discovered!) </div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">But I do know a tad about 20th century American history.  So when I read Paul Krugman’s <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/20/stimulus-derangement-syndrome/">latest blog post</a>, titled “Stimulus Derangement Syndrome,” about the really bald mistakes of fact&#8211;basic failures to remember history or logic, as Krugman descriptively phrases it&#8211;by “name” conservative economists, in the service of advancing austere fiscal policy, I was struck by this sentence:</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">So, for example, we had <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/01/22/war-and-non-remembrance/">Robert Barro</a> arguing that multipliers are small because private spending fell during World War II (hello? Rationing? Banning of private construction?). </div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">I didn’t know who Robert Barro is until I read Krugman’s blog post.  But now that I do know, I want to contact him, because I think he might be interested in buying a family heirloom I have in the garage, and I&#8217;m trying to sell it.  It’s a 1944 model Oldsmobile, and it’s in vintage condition.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oldsmobile#1940s">It’s also unique</a>.  Believe me.</div>
