<blockquote>I know we&#8217;re in crazy economic times here, but it&#8217;s still a bit weird seeing economists suggesting that our government get into the mortgage business at below market rates.</p></blockquote>
<p>I say the economic times are so crazy that I&#8217;ll worry about getting a refi at &#8220;below market&#8221; rates when the market shows some signs of sanity.</p>
<p>The last time I was in the mortgage market, in late-2004, I obtained a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage at an interest rate approximately 1.6 percentage points over the 10-year Treasury bond yield at the time; that&#8217;s exactly what Hubbard and Mayer consider a normally-functioning-market spread in the <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122948162452913103.html">W$J op-ed</a> that <a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/CalculatedRisk/~3/2vv__DFf_JI/bad-housing-policy-proposals-never-die.html">CR takes on today</a>.  The same spread today would imply a rate of 3.8 percent!  Now maybe a lender today would require a &#8220;world going to hell in a handbasket&#8221; premium.  Fair enough.  But as Hubbard and Mayer observe, that could be 70 bp and that would put us at this magical 4.5 percent.  Just how much riskier <i>are</i> full-doc conforming prime mortgages?  </p>
<p>Now I&#8217;m not keen on re-inflating the bubble per se, or creating a right to a 4.5 percent mortgage.  But under the circumstances, there seem to be worse things that Uncle Sam (or Uncle Ben) can do than to lend money at normal-ish spreads on otherwise prudent terms — the &#8220;prudent&#8221; part being a missing element of a lot of bubble-era lending, of course.</p>

                                <p>In one of the stupidest wastes of Treasury monies this month—a major accomplishment, though AIG hasn&#8217;t hit the trough again yet, so there might be hope—the Treasury wants to <a href="http://calculatedrisk.blogspot.com/2008/12/wsj-treasury-considers-plan-to-lower.html">subsidize <em>new</em> mortgages</a> (link to CR):<br />
<blockquote>Under the plan, Treasury would buy securities underpinning loans guaranteed by the two mortgage giants, which are temporarily under the control of the government, as well as those guaranteed by the Federal Housing Administration. [amazement, not to mention emphasis, mine]</p></blockquote>
<p>This will, of course, address the underlying problem perfectly:<br />
<blockquote>Government officials are under pressure to stem foreclosures, which underpin much of the current financial crisis. Treasury has struggled for months to come up with a plan that would ease the market without appearing to bail out homeowners and lenders.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s Deborah Solomon, so we expect lies and deception.  So let&#8217;s fix that last sentence:<br />
<blockquote>Treasury has struggled for months to come up with a plan that would ease the market without appearing to bail out homeowners <strong>having already provided ridiculous amounts of money to the</strong> lenders.</p></blockquote>
<p>There.  Much better.</p>
<p>*Someone please break the news to <a href="http://economy.nationaljournal.com/2008/12/is-the-deficit-a-threat-to-a-f.php#1183590">the Ed Leamers of the world</a> that those are tax dollars that are being used as &#8220;monetary policy,&#8221; which will be just as much of a liability to future generations as his &#8220;fear of public goods spending,&#8221; except that we get a boost to profits when we build public goods.  Good thing he&#8217;s not an economist or&#8230;never mind.</p>

<p>First, there&#8217;s the the McCain health plan.  Or, rather, the evolution from</p>
<p>We&#8217;re phoning it in, to</p>
<p>OMG, people are <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/09/mccains-health-plan-tax-cut-or-tax-hike.html">looking at it and figuring out ways it might suck</a>, so</p>
<p>Sweeten it, but&#8230;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s too expensive for our small-government-conservative narrative, and voila,</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s commit political suicide!!<br />
<blockquote>You know, we have llike seen this before. On health care:</p>
<ul>
<li>McCain started with a tax credit that was equal in aggregate to the additional tax he levied on employer-sponsored health benefits in the first year&#8211;in later years the credit became much smaller than the tax.</li>
<li>Then it was like ooops, that&#8217;s not popular. We know&#8211;we never intended to subject employer-sponsored benefits to the FICA tax, only to the income tax.</li>
<li>Then it was like ooops, now we&#8217;re scared that the plan is fiscally irresponsible and will raise the deficit. We know&#8211;we will cut Medicare!</li>
<li>Then it was like ooops, we have to carry Floria. We know&#8211;have Sarah Palin say that McCain will not cut but will protect your entitlements.</li>
</ul>
<p>Can&#8217;t anybody play this game? If we lose the election to these clowns, I am going to be really embarrassed. It seems as though nothing is competently staffed out&#8211;as if nobody in the McCain campaign cares about actually having policy proposals, but only about having something incoherent that an ignorant and lazy reporter can be deceived into thinking is a policy proposal.</p></blockquote>
<p>Second, on the housing crisis, McCain pulls his new bailout plan out of his behind at the &#8220;debate.&#8221;  However:<br />
<blockquote>But it soon develops that much of Senator McCain&#8217;s proposal is not his but Barney Frank&#8217;s, and that the differences make it not a homeowner relief bill but an imprudent banker profit and rescue bill.</p></blockquote>
<p>And so our so-called conservatives want to nationalize negative home equity (that&#8217;s some concern for the taxpayer, there):<br />
<blockquote>[DeLong quoting the Politco] “Clearly we face the trade off that we would in fact be taking the negative equity position and putting it on the taxpayers books instead of putting it on the private lenders books or the homeowners books,” Holtz-Eakin told Politico. “We think the balance of risk has shifted to the point where this is the way to go.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Does the McCain website say that?  No.<br />
<blockquote>But by the time I got to the website, it read differently:</p>
<blockquote><p>JohnMcCain.com &#8211; McCain-Palin 2008: For those that cannot make payments, mortgages must be re-structured to put losses on the books and put homeowners in manageable mortgages. <s>Lenders in these cases must recognize the loss that they’ve already suffered.</s> [Apparently that last sentence was struck by a panicked editor &#8212; ATB.]</p></blockquote>
<p>Apparently the schmuck who was assigned the job of writing up the web description did not believe the plan could possibly be what he was told it was.</p></blockquote>
<p>Most deliciously, someone couldn&#8217;t stop from thinking out loud in naming the &#8220;program,&#8221; such as it is: it&#8217;s the &#8220;American Homeownership Resurgence Plan (McCain Resurgence Plan).&#8221;  Apparently it&#8217;s change someone can believe in.</p>

<p>England probably does enjoy more than the usual weird average behavior, thanks to the relative size of London.  House price appreciation also happens to have pretty much come to an end essentially everywhere else:</p>

If you don&#8217;t want to click the links, the story is that the peak of existing home sales was in mid-2005, whereas the Case-Shiller indexes peaked a year later.  And as of Calomiris&#8217;s writing, the OFHEO index was still at a point where Calomiris could write&#8230;<br />
<blockquote>At the moment, it is not obvious that housing or other asset prices are collapsing, or that leverage is unsustainably large for most firms or consumers.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;and it arguably was a matter of geek warfare to point out that he was whistling in the graveyard.  Heh, well, crazy as things got here, the English bubble has on its face been a lot worse.  The average detached house in England and Wales is £275,000.  Sure, the mean is not robust, but still, that&#8217;s pounds!  To the extent the <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/EconomistsView/~3/320858488/fed-watch-this.html">Fed is in a bind</a>, things should be really fun these days over at the Bank of England.</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="http://heterodoxeconomist.typepad.com/heterodox_economist/2007/06/he-once-went-to.html">Brad DeLong</a> appears (to me) to confuse perceiving a move from Democratic Republic to Empire—and therefore away from any Competitive Advantage for the past 100-ish years—with <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/05/james-poulos-fe.html">conspiracy theory</a>.  But I may just be reacting to his headline.</li>
<li>Tim Duy (at Mark Thoma&#8217;s place) <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2008/05/tim-duy-misunde.html">refuses to jump into the briar patch</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Increasingly, society views the purchase of a home as primarily an investment, not for the service it provides (don’t even get me started on this topic). </p></blockquote>
<p>Someone needs to get him started.  Or continue from <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/05/inside-cpi.html">Tom&#8217;s previous AB post</a>.</li>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p><a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/EconomistsView/~3/284935127/tax-policy-and.html">Mark Thoma</a> points to Thomas Palley playing lightning rod with &#8220;<a href="http://www.thomaspalley.com/?p=107">Tax Policy and the House Price Bubble</a>.&#8221;  With a title like that, you might expect a prima facie case for a causal link between tax preferences for homeownership and the bubble, but Palley&#8217;s lede is deeply buried and there turns out not to be a lot of there there.  The central issue is that there&#8217;s no obvious variation in tax policy that is associated with the bubble.  More after the jump.</p>
<p>Plenty of Sensible Economists have sniped at the mortgage interest deduction among other favorable tax treatments for homeownership.  Reforming, though not eliminating, the mortgage interest deduction also was a recommendation of the <a href="http://www.taxreformpanel.gov/">Tax Reform Panel</a> whose report was broadly ignored after its 2005 publication gave some of us in the econoblogiverse plenty of material (for anyone interested, my contemporary blogging on the subject is <a href="http://atbozzo.blogspot.com/2005/11/tax-reform-greatest-hits.html">linked here</a>).  Palley recites the traditional indictment: the tax policies are expensive (*), pay the middle- to upper-middle classes to do something they&#8217;d do anyway (**), are unfair to low-income taxpayers who don&#8217;t itemize or otherwise get a smaller deduction (***), and by increasing house prices work somewhat at cross purposes to the notional intent of making housing more affordable.  Fair enough.</p>
<p>Thing is, as far as the housing bubble is concerned, none of this is new.  The deduction was distorting the housing market well into pre-bubble history.  Indeed, the reductions in marginal tax rates affecting most middle- and upper-income taxpayers ought, in principle, to have reduced the distortion on the margin.  Here, for instance, is the CPI-adjusted OFHEO house price index against the marginal tax rate applicable to a family with a constant-dollar income somewhat north of mine (****):</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/21392874@N00/2473571200/" title="Marginal Tax Rates and House Prices by atbozzo, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2379/2473571200_40e747b6f4.jpg" alt="Marginal Tax Rates and House Prices" height="340" width="500"></a></p>
<p>Correlation is not causality, of course, but the simple correlation here is negative (-0.55).  Moreover, there isn&#8217;t any clear connection between the major changes in tax policy over the period and bubbly prices, unless someone can account for the rather variable lag structures.  The 1986 tax reform eliminated the deductibility of non-mortgage interest, which in particular made home-equity credit relatively attractive; in 1997, the capital-gains treatment for owner-occupied housing changed.  In both cases, at least using the CPI adjustment, prices had started recovering from their local troughs before enactment of the changes.</p>
<p>The &#8217;97 change — which replaced a tax deferral for homeownership capital gains rolled into another residence with a flat exemption of $250,000 for an individual (twice that for joint filers) — is tricky.  It does favor owner-occupied housing as an asset class by making something of a Roth IRA out of one&#8217;s house.  However, the benefits relative to previous law only assert themselves upon exit of the owner-occupied housing market, and the complete tax deferral of rolled-over equity may have been worth more in the short run to movers up or down in areas with high nominal appreciation.  Also, this was enacted against the backdrop of a right-of-center program to reduce taxation of capital income; I tend to the view that there&#8217;s not a lot of distortion between a zero capital gains tax rate and the low rates that currently prevail for other long-term gains.</p>
<p>So Palley is left with a rather tenuous assertion connecting the bubble and tax policy:<br />
<blockquote>The tax system has helped create a cult of home ownership, and that cult appears to have been an ingredient in the recent house price bubble.</p></blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t think the tax preferences exactly hurt the cult&#8217;s marketing, but let&#8217;s face facts: to explain the bubble, it&#8217;s necessary to find factors associated more-or-less with the bubble era, and from that perspective it should be amply clear that the irrational exuberance came roaring out of the financial world. The cult part was all the spinning of tales for why houses were just like stocks in the late-90s except for the crashing back to earth part, combined with the deployment of financial technologies which, while not necessarily dangerous per se (*****), certainly bore risks of unintended consequences that were broadly ignored.  So now we have a socialized financial system (at least on the downside), woohoo!</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I&#8217;m skeptical to say the very least regarding claims that we&#8217;d be living in a paradise of economic dynamism if only we were all unencumbered by our illiquid and inconvenient owned housing.  Long-term wage stagnation is a huge problem, but one that can&#8217;t fairly be placed at homeownership above other causes.</p>
<p>So Palley has some reasonably sensible reform plans that someone might phase in, but I&#8217;m not going to tell anyone that a bit of political capital ought to be spent on them that might otherwise be spent extracting us from <a href="http://icasualties.org/oif/">George and Dick&#8217;s Excellent Adventure</a> or breaking our addictions to oil and/or GHG emissions — both of which are far more difficult and urgent.</p>
<p>(*) $80 billion is a lot of money, but at ~3% of the federal budget, not the biggest boondoggle in annual expenditures.</p>
<p>(**) Distastefully inefficient to the extent it&#8217;s true.</p>
<p>(***) Also true in large part, though non-itemizers do have the standard deduction.</p>

                                <p>Thanks to Rdan for the welcome.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m with <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheBigPicture/~3/283364160/visualizing-inf.html">Barry Ritholtz</a> in admiring the NYT&#8217;s <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2008/05/03/business/20080403_SPENDING_GRAPHIC.html">interactive consumer price inflation mosaic</a>, which the print edition didn&#8217;t do justice to.    As someone who occasionally gets a bee in the bonnet over the successes and failures of economic measurement methods, the graphic also helps illustrate a couple ways in which CPI can be <a href="http://atbozzo.blogspot.com/2008/03/actual-economics-post-why-shadow.html">unfairly maligned</a>.  As I read it, the graphic deals best with one class of arguments for why CPI is screwed up:</p>
<p>ZOMG the price of [CPI component in the news] is skyrocketing!   Lo, prices of goods that headlines would lead you to believe should be measured as skyrocketing by-and-large are — +26% for gasoline, +48% for heating oil, etc.  Gasoline is even a big enough component of average expenditures for the price increases to be legitimately painful for anyone without good substitution opportunities.  But it&#8217;s still only so much of a representative budget; cheese, bread, and eggs are much less so.   And ample sums are spent on other things where there isn&#8217;t much or even any inflation at all.  (How these all should be treated for any given policy purpose is a separate issue.)  Meanwhile, the gorilla in the room is housing, as housing rentals and equivalents account for 30% of expenditures.</p>
<p>However, that leads to a second bad argument:</p>
<p>ZOMG the biggest component of CPI is imputed!  Indeed, <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/04/mike-mandel-rem.html">Brad DeLong</a> recently observed Michael Mandel suggesting that personal consumption expenditures be calculated ex-imputations — of which owner-occupied housing is the biggest.  That wasn&#8217;t the sharpest thing that&#8217;ll appear in BusinessWeek this year.  Catch is, it&#8217;s not like homeowners don&#8217;t (a) consume housing services and (b) incur opportunity costs doing so whether or not they (like my family among other leveraged real estate investment partnerships) actually shell out a lot of cash for house payments.  We consume non-marketed goods and services all the time.  Missing markets in almost everything, I like to say.</p>
<p>The details of the imputation of housing expenditures for owners certainly aren&#8217;t sacred.  For one thing, in much of the country, the rental and owner-occupied housing stocks resemble each other very little.  For another, I&#8217;d like to hear why it would be unreasonable to calculate the imputed rent at a &#8216;rational&#8217; rate given what the owners paid, which goes to the issue of whether housing expenditures above imputed market rents should be treated as consumption or investment.    Anyway, between <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/CalculatedRisk/~3/280371885/homeownership-and-vacancy-rates.html">vacancies</a> and the supply of foreclosed properties, I doubt shelter inflation will be a big problem in the near future.</p>
<p>So, I don&#8217;t go to bed worrying about inflation, or that we&#8217;ve been in an especially protracted recession for years and apparently don&#8217;t know it (an implication of claims you can find out there that CPI and like measures understate &#8220;true&#8221; inflation by very large amounts).  Employment and the distribution of such growth as we have had is another matter.</p>

                                <p>Reader Ken Melvin sends along some thoughts on housing prices:</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>Speculation in housing:</p>
<p>Much of the speculation in houses is due leveraging.   The buyer puts down 10% on a $500,000 home, first year; price of the home goes up 10% to $550,000.  The buyer sells and voila, makes 100% on his 10% down.  Hell of a deal.  Next buyer puts down $55,000, price goes to $605,000.  Next buyer puts down $60,500, house goes to $665,500, …  Another year later; $732,050.  Getting ridiculous, so it begins to slow a bit.  Say increases drop to 5%.  Buyers say, still not too shabby, in fact, we’ll gladly settle for a mere 50% return.  So, they plunk down $73,205, prices goes to $768,600, houses sell, and the buyers makes 50% return on their investment.</p>
<p>How best offset the speculative force of leveraging? No help from the world of finance here.  They’re getting a cut.  Given that I think that speculation in housing is bad and think that this can easily be proven; we can; put a high tax on residential real estate gains, fifty per cent or better &#8211; make it high – make it mean something, and, keep assessments current.</p>
<p>Why the lender should be partner:</p>
<p>Guy builds a bunch of condos in Bayland planning to sell them for $550,000.  Oops, sub-prime crisis – has to sell these condos for $350,000; a price that still affords the developer a decent return.  So, the price is whatever the market will bear.  If the condos in Bayland ha been completed and were sold a couple years ago, when the market price for such was $550,000, the developers would have stuck an additional $200,000 per in their pocket, a small ton of money, and, by now, all them would be running for US Senator.  The lender would have packaged the $550,000 loans as ‘financial instruments’, sold them, then, with new and better reserves, loaned more money to buy more overpriced condos.   So:  The developer will sell their product for anything between a reasonable mark up and whatever the market will bear.  The buyer doesn’t have anyway of knowing what the units are really worth.  But, the lenders and the builders do.  If the lenders were partner to the purchase, they wouldn’t give anymore than they had to give.  If the lenders were partners to the purchase, they would have said we’ll lend no more than 90% of $350,000.  This way, the buyers don’t get stuck owing $495,000 (assuming they paid 10% down) on a condo worth $350,000, aren’t bankrupting themselves making payments on overpriced condos, and, more people will be able to afford housing. </p>
<p>At a selling price of $350,000, the buyer puts down $35,000 and owns 10% of the condo, while the lender owns the remaining 90%.  Price goes to $400,000 in two years, condo sells, lender nets $45,000, buyer $5,000.  Little speculative force due leverage here. </p>
<p>Conversely, say price goes down to $300,000 over two years, condo sells, lender loses $45,000, buyer $5,000.  If the price goes down to $300,000 and there’s no sale of the condo of the example, the condo’s worth about what the buyer owes (~$300,000), so chances are the buyer would hang in there and continue making payments.  Compare this way of financing housing to what we have now.</p>
<p>A footnote on an associated aspect of housing prices &#8211; interest rates and housing prices: In short, housing prices are a function of the payments a typical homebuyer can afford and thus are a function of interest rates.  If a buyer can afford payments of $3,000/mo and interest rates are 6%; the buyer can afford to pay $500,000 for a house.  If interest rates go to 8%; the same buyer can only afford a $370,000 house.  Whether houses are built is determined by the difference (margin) between what potential buyers can afford and their building costs.  The sub-prime loans skewed the (initial) payments the buyer could afford.</p>
