<p> What Bush II and Clinton Got Wrong On The Economy</p>
<p>First, we start off with sectorial balances. Trade deficits must be offset by government and/or private deficits. For example, if we had a $50 billion trade deficit, then that needs to be offset with a $50 billion government deficit. Otherwise, the private sector will be driven into debt, which is not as sustainable long term.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s look at the Bush years in the accompanying chart. Trade deficits far exceeded budget deficits, and grew quite large. As those trade deficits grew as a % of GDP, the budget deficit was shrinking. I think we know the net effect as the private sector was driven further into debt &#8211; real estate related debt, which unraveled in 2008. Now going back a little further, this condition also existed under Clinton though to a lessor extent.</p>
<p>Both presidents should have run larger deficits to keep the sectors in balance. This could have been achieved through some combination of policies that either lowered the trade deficit, and/or increased spending, and/or tax cuts. Needless to say they both got it wrong, and Obama&#8217;s stimulus spending was the correct move to begin to get the sectorial balances back in check. However, Obama really needs to be running larger deficits to correct for the past imbalances.</p>

<p> History Lesson &#8211; Deficits as a % of GDP, Tax Rates </p>
<p>DISCLAIMER: This is not a defense of Bush II. Just the facts on the deficit, and a further discussion of sectoral balances and some tax rate info.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s look at some history, because the belief is that Bush II ran the biggest budget deficits ever, and ruined the Clinton surpluses. I wish we did not spend so much on the military under Bush. However, the Bush deficits were not that large as a % of GDP. His father, and Reagan ran bigger ones. The deficits were not that far off where we were at the end of the 70&#8217;s either. Now keep in mind, that the trade deficit does factor in &#8211; been having trouble assembling historical data on this. When running a trade deficit we need to run a federal deficit to keep the private sector in balance. <br />See <a href="http://www.creditwritedowns.com/2011/02/government-deficits-and-the-financial-sectors-balances.html">Credit write downs</a>  on sectoral balances:</p>
<p>The key formulas is as follows:</p>
<p>Domestic Private Balance + Domestic Government Balance + Foreign Balance = 0<br />Via <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/the-growing-government-deficit-actually-means-savings-for-the-private-sector-2011-2#ixzz2NZIXVitT">Business Insider</a> L Randall Wray</p>
<p>Lastly, the Obama deficits are exactly what we needed to make up for the deficits that were probably too small under Clinton and Bush II.</p>
<p>Now, much of the talk on historical Tax Rates focuses on marginal rates- I found this table to be quite interesting as it looks beyond the top marginal rates, and breaks out lower income folks.</p>

<p>Data is for 3 groups 1/2 median income; Median Income ; Twice Median income respectively </p>
<p>Year &#8212; Average Combined Rates for each group that includes payroll taxes and EITC , and the last numbers are the top and bottom marginal rates that excludes payroll taxes ( I just sampled a few years, go to the link to see more. I used average cause that better reflects what one actually pays) :</p>

<p><strong>How money enters the economy through deficit spending. A simple model for discussion.</strong><br /><strong><br /></strong>
<div><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-C-EzVf3pXwg/UTSi30f3cwI/AAAAAAAABiY/SRUQAmDQO2o/s1600/NFA.png" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-C-EzVf3pXwg/UTSi30f3cwI/AAAAAAAABiY/SRUQAmDQO2o/s1600/NFA.png" height="318" width="320"></a></div>
<p><strong><br /></strong>

<p>When the government deficit spends here are the mechanics:</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>a) Government buys goods from some private entity, let&#8217;s say $1,000 worth. The government deficit spends to do this. They credit the private entity&#8217;s checking account to the tune of $1,000 (increases reserves by $1,000)</p>
<p>b) Government issues a bond for $1,000</p>
<p>c) Private entity&#8217;s checking account is debited $1,000 to buy…</p>
<p>On net, a financial asset of $1,000 has been added to the economy &#8211; the original reserves are still there!<br />In this spreadsheet I have created three scenarios, for the sake of discussion. Don&#8217;t worry where the initial $1,000 for each person comes from, do not consider one rich or one poor &#8211; this is for illustrative purposes only to see the mechanics. There is no foreign trade, nor any private borrowing. That is for another discussion. Treat each year as a a calendar year.</p>
<p>Example 1, the government runs a surplus, and makes zero purchases. Quite simply the surpluses drain the economy and essentially drive the private sector into debt. The government does not save surpluses in any account for a rainy day. Its a drain.</p>
<p>For Example 2, we add in government purchases which slows the drain.</p>
<p>In Example 3, we deficit spend, which adds money to the economy &#8211; there is more there to drive aggregate demand.</p>
<p>Deficit spending is our savings, it is NOT like a household budget.</p>
