<p><strong>How money enters the economy through deficit spending. A simple model for discussion.</strong><br /><strong><br /></strong>
<div><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-C-EzVf3pXwg/UTSi30f3cwI/AAAAAAAABiY/SRUQAmDQO2o/s1600/NFA.png" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-C-EzVf3pXwg/UTSi30f3cwI/AAAAAAAABiY/SRUQAmDQO2o/s1600/NFA.png" height="318" width="320"></a></div>

<p>When the government deficit spends here are the mechanics:</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>a) Government buys goods from some private entity, let&#8217;s say $1,000 worth. The government deficit spends to do this. They credit the private entity&#8217;s checking account to the tune of $1,000 (increases reserves by $1,000)</p>
<p>b) Government issues a bond for $1,000</p>
<p>c) Private entity&#8217;s checking account is debited $1,000 to buy…</p>
<p>On net, a financial asset of $1,000 has been added to the economy &#8211; the original reserves are still there!<br />In this spreadsheet I have created three scenarios, for the sake of discussion. Don&#8217;t worry where the initial $1,000 for each person comes from, do not consider one rich or one poor &#8211; this is for illustrative purposes only to see the mechanics. There is no foreign trade, nor any private borrowing. That is for another discussion. Treat each year as a a calendar year.</p>
<p>Example 1, the government runs a surplus, and makes zero purchases. Quite simply the surpluses drain the economy and essentially drive the private sector into debt. The government does not save surpluses in any account for a rainy day. Its a drain.</p>
<p>For Example 2, we add in government purchases which slows the drain.</p>
<p>In Example 3, we deficit spend, which adds money to the economy &#8211; there is more there to drive aggregate demand.</p>
<p>Deficit spending is our savings, it is NOT like a household budget.</p>
