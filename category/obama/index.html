<p>With all this stalemate posturing in Washington, today Chris Hayes has come up with the best idea I have heard yet to move the players.  And, in my opinion actually solve our economic depression.</div>
<div></div>
<div>One trillion dollars to be spent on direct hiring by the government along with debt forgiveness.  A solution right out of the New Deal program.  Unfortunately for Chris, Obama does not have the language within his vocabulary to recognize such an approach and thus in Obama&#8217;s <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/ref/us/politics/21seelye-text.html" target="_blank">own words</a>: “&#8230;put us on a fundamentally different path because the country was ready for it.”</div>
<div></div>
<div>In fact, not only does he not have the language within his vocabulary to recognize a solution from history, he thinks the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/ref/us/politics/21seelye-text.html" target="_blank">60&#8217;s and 70&#8217;s</a> were full of excesses (while noting Kennedy moved the nation in a new direction&#8230;right into the excesses of the 60&#8217;s?)*</div>

<div>Do you think anyone who remembers what it meant to be a leader in the Democratic Party was watching?   </div>
<div></div>
<div>*“I do think that, for example, the 1980 election was different. I think Ronald Reagan changed the trajectory of America in a way that, you know, Richard Nixon did not and in a way that Bill Clinton did not.”</div>
<div>&#8220;He put us on a fundamentally different path because the country was ready for it. I think they felt like, you know, with all the excesses of the 60s and the 70s, and government had grown and grown, but there wasn&#8217;t much sense of accountability in terms of how it was operating. I think people just tapped into &#8212; he tapped into what people were already feeling, which was, we want clarity, we want optimism, we want a return to that sense of dynamism and entrepreneurship that had been missing.”  </div>
<div></div>
<div><i>Don&#8217;t get me going on the people wanting &#8220;clarity&#8221; (security state that even the congress can&#8217;t get info on) and &#8220;optimism&#8221; (the audacity!).</i></div>

                                <p>At least on certain issues.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not inherently a  great pessimist, but with few exceptions each passing month for over a  decade now has seen my optimism whither, at least a little.  So I can&#8217;t  help but see the manure-colored lining in this otherwise rosy, fluffy  cloud.</p>
<p><a href="http://maddowblog.msnbc.com/_news/2013/02/27/17116916-the-party-in-need-of-a-major-makeover?lite">Steve Benen reports</a> that according to the new NBC/WSJ poll, Americans trust Democrats more  than Republicans on domestic issues, sometimes by large margins.  Here  is a graph.  (As always, click to embiggen.)</p>
<p>
<div><a href="http://m.static.newsvine.com/servista/imagesizer?file=steve-benen31504FA3-10CB-8A49-73D8-B81D1B111D48.jpg&#038;width=600"><img border="0" height="232" src="http://m.static.newsvine.com/servista/imagesizer?file=steve-benen31504FA3-10CB-8A49-73D8-B81D1B111D48.jpg&#038;width=600" width="400">  </a></div>
<div>Graph 1   Who Do You Trust?</div>
<p>But  the causes of my pessimism are four-fold.  First, as Benen goes on to  note, the same polling reveals that in the popular mind &#8220;Republicans  have an advantage on the (sic) reducing the deficit, &#8216;controlling&#8217;  government spending, and national defense.&#8221;  Well, there&#8217;s three reasons  for pessimism right there.  A) Reducing the deficit is an issue of  exactly zero urgency, and attacking it now <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2012/dec/21/opinion/la-oe-kelton-fiscal-cliff-economy-20121221">will certainly cause economic hardship</a>,  especially for those at the bottom. Further, Republicans have been huge  debt increasers for decades, while Dems have not.  B) We absolutely do not have a spending problem.  We absolutely do have a revenue problem, as graph 2 plainly indicates.  I think the Republicans have become convinced of their own lies.</p>
<div><a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fredgraph.png?g=fYp"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fredgraph.png?g=fYp" width="400"></a></div>
<div>Graph 2   Federal Gov Current Recpts by GDP </div>
<p>C)  From FDR through LBJ to BHO, Dems have been every bit as war-mongerish  as their Rep counterparts; BHO has continued his predecessors war  initiatives almost seamlessly;  and 9/11 happened on W&#8217;s watch.  This  just makes me want to cry.</p>
<p>But I have a bigger list.   Second, a look a graph 1 reveals some disturbing details.  A)  Joe  BeerCan must not connect &#8220;Looking out for the middle class,&#8221; Medicare,&#8221;  &#8220;Health Care,&#8221; &#8220;Medicare,&#8217; or &#8220;Social Security&#8221; with &#8220;Economy&#8221; or the  results for those categories would line up better.  B) Considering Paul  Ryan and the never-ending series of Republican contrived cliffs, scoring  Dems only marginally better than Repubs on the economy is, all by  itself, cause for despair.  C) As is the close call on taxes.</p>
<p>Third,  and I&#8217;ve already alluded to this, there is almost no daylight between  the two parties on foreign policy issues.  Still I have to give a slight  nod to the Dems, based on practicality, because: John Bolton.</p>
<p>And  last, though I firmly believe to the bottom of my heart that the Dems  are superior on absolutely every issue, problem and question that might  rise, they still aren&#8217;t that damned good.  Case in point: the new head  of the Michigan Democratic party is a venture capitalist.  As Bill Maher  sagely put it, while the Democrats have moved to the right, the  Republicans have moved to the insane asylum.  They demonstrate this  anew, <a href="http://southernbeale.wordpress.com/2013/02/26/the-latest-crazy-wingnut-theory-about-lady-parts/">almost every single day</a>.  </p>
<p>The  lessons of history and even a casual observation of the current  failures of European austerity show that progressive policies are the  clear and present necessity.  But even if we had strong Dem majorities,  we still have Reaganite B. Hoover Obama in the White House, and a  genuine progressive movement in congress the exact size and shape of  Bernie Sanders.  </p>
<p>As one of my college professors put it long ago:  Booze is the only answer.</p>

                                <p>Part III &#8211; How to think about time series data.</p>
<p>For reference:<br />Part II  <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/09/why-spendinggdp-is-terrible-horrible-no.html">Federal Spending as a Fraction of GDP</a></p>
<p>Part I  <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/09/a-quick-look-at-federal-spending.html">Federal Spending Growth</a></p>
<p>Some  commentors to the previous posts have rightly concluded that I consider  spending under Obama in the context of historical trends.  In fact, if  you don&#8217;t consider historical trends, you are ignoring the most  important element of context that is available.  I only mentioned trends  briefly in Part II, but the directional changes in the graphs of Parts I  and II implicitly suggest them.</p>
<p>Time series data that  relate to the size of the population, the government, or the economy  generally follow a quasi-exponential growth pattern.  I say <i>quasi-</i> because a perfect exponential growth pattern  results from a continuous  constant rate of growth, while real world growth rates vary from year.   Graph 3 of Part II shows how these variations have occurred over  several decades.  Usually this does not result in a large or permanent  deformation in the shape of a quasi-exponential curve, since the growth  rate typically oscillates irregularly around a mean value that only  changes slowly over time.</p>
<p>Graph 2 in Part II shows that  the spending and GDP growth curves stay close to exponential tracks  over long time spans.  It also illustrates that the recent recession was  one of those rare times when growth rates deviated substantially.</p>
<p>Human  eye-brain coordination doesn&#8217;t deal well with exponential curve  shapes.  Straight lines are much easier to comprehend and extrapolate.   Graphing quasi-exponential data on a log scale reduces the curve to a  quasi-straight line that is much easier to use and understand.</p>
<p>Graph  1 shows Federal Spending and GDP, since 1995, plotted on a log scale.   Constant growth results in a straight line segment, and a higher growth  rate causes a steeper slope.  Zero growth shows up as a horizontal  line.   I&#8217;ve again included a line for 5 times spending, to get a close  overlay with the GDP line.</p>

<p>There  is an upward bend in the spending line in 2000.  This is most easily  seen in the blue line.  During the 90&#8217;s, we can see that GDP grew faster  than spending.  In 2001-2, GDP growth flat-lined, as expected during a  recession. Then, from 20002 to 2008, the growth rates for GDP and  spending were close to identical.  Both lines twist during the most  recent recession.  Curiously, spending growth was flat for a large  portion of 2008.</p>
<p>Since the recession, the spending lines are very close to flat, and GDP growth has been anemic.  Here is a close up.</p>

<p>Graph 3 provides context, all the way back to 1947.  Ponder the inflection points and slope changes at your leisure.</p>

<p>Note  that there are only two flat-ish spots in the spending lines: now, and  during the Eisenhower administration. The current administration has, at  least temporarily, broken the decades-long trend in continuous spending  increases.  </p>
<p>To emphasize the obvious, spending growth  is now very close to zero.  In context, this is remarkable.  Saying  Obama is a profligate spender is a lie.  </p>
<p>In this post, I am not suggesting that the rate of spending growth under any president is good, bad, appropriate or inappropriate.  I am only pointing out what was and is.  </p>
<p>So, this is how you think about time series data.<br />0)  Forget your preconceived notions.    (Frex:I had no idea that spending  growth has essentially stopped until I looked at the data.)<br />1) Identify trends. The history of time series data provides meaningful context.<br />2) Identify break points and trend changes.  These are key data points.<br />3) Note the directions of these changes.<br />4) Think hard about what these observations are actually telling you, not what you want them to say.<br />5) Double down on 4) if you are looking at a ratio.  Ponder that denominator. <br />6) Don&#8217;t cherry pick.  It&#8217;s dishonest.</p>
<p>There  are a lot of ways to look at a data set: linear and log scales, rate of  change, etc.  Chose the one that gives the clearest picture of the data  you want to analyze, or simplifies the analysis, or makes it easier to  understand.  Studying different views can be informative, as can a  comparison of different data sets.  </p>
<p><a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?g=ara">Here is the working page at FRED for the graphs in this post</a>.  I encourage the interested reader to spend some time working with the capabilities of this very powerful tool.</p>
<p>Editorial Comment:<br />In  case it&#8217;s not obvious, I&#8217;ll tell you that I write these posts because  they interest me and I think they generate some knowledge, or at least  information, that is worth sharing.  I have virtually no interest in the  fool&#8217;s errand of convincing anybody that I am right &#8211; either the data  analysis convinces you or it doesn&#8217;t.  So unless you have better data,  or can point out some specific flaw in my reasoning [and then tell me  specifically and in detail how to get it right] don&#8217;t bother arguing  with me.</p>
<p>I appreciate rational discourse, and am always  willing to engage thoughtful readers. I&#8217;m also willing to be proven  wrong by a cogent argument.  That said, though, I don&#8217;t really care if  anyone comments.  At this point, I&#8217;d <i>almost</i> rather nobody  did.  But if you chose to, please do me the courtesy of having your  comment be somewhere in the general vicinity of on-topic.  And &#8211; fair  warning: naked assertions and unsubstantiated ideologically approved  talking points will be scoffed at, so please check that nonsense at the  door.</p>

                                <p>A post like this really shouldn&#8217;t be necessary, but part of the right wing canard that <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/09/a-quick-look-at-federal-spending.html">Obama has been a profligate spender</a> is based on spending as a percentage of GDP.</p>
<p>It looks like this &#8211; Graph 1.</p>
<p>
<div><a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fredgraph.png?g=ajA"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fredgraph.png?g=ajA" width="400"></a></div>
<div>Graph 1.  Fed Expenditures/GDP</div>
<p>Sure  enough, by the end of Clinton&#8217;s term the ratio had fallen from Reagan&#8217;s  high of 24% to a modern low of 19%.  But note that the 19% value wasn&#8217;t  typical.  It was the end point of a decade-long decline.  And, yep,  there&#8217;s Obama with an all-time-high approaching 26%.</p>
<p>What  otherwise intelligent, and sometimes even famous people seem to ignore  though, is that every ratio has not only a numerator but also that <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/08/debt-recession-and-that-ol-devil.html">ol&#8217; devil denominator</a>.    Let&#8217;s have a look at both of them.  Graph 2 shows GDP and Expenditures  since 1980, expressed in $ Billions.  I&#8217;ve also added a line  representing 5* Expenditures, since 20% of GDP is a reasonable rough  estimate for the post WW II era.</p>
<p>
<div><a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fredgraph.png?g=ak0"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fredgraph.png?g=ak0" width="400"></a></div>
<div>Graph 2.  Expenditures and GDP Compared</div>
<p>Actually,  the 5x Expenditures line runs pretty consistently above the GDP line,  telling us two things that we should have already known from looking at  Graph 1.  First, Expenditures greater than 20% of GDP have been the norm  since before 1980, and 2) Clinton&#8217;s final number is not representative  of anything other than a single year.  Using it as a comparator is  cherry-picking and fundamentally dishonest.</p>
<p>The 5x line  also emphasizes that the majority of the spending increase under Obama  unavoidably occurred during the officially designated recession.  The  GDP line shows that, post recession, GDP growth has not recovered to the  pre-recession trend line.  In fact, growth has established a new trend  line with a lower slope.  This is unprecedented in the scope of FRED  historical data.  My guess is that insufficient Federal spending has  been a big drag on this recovery.  But it&#8217;s also true that GDP growth  has been in secular decline since the Reagan administration.  Note that skewing the denominator down will automatically skew the ratio up.  This is what Bill Clinton calls &#8220;arithmetic.&#8221;</p>
<p>Slicing  across this a different way, Graph 3 gives us year-over-year percentage  growth in Expenditures and GDP, dating back to the Eisenhower  administration.</p>
<p>
<div><a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fredgraph.png?g=akg"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fredgraph.png?g=akg" width="400"></a></div>
<div>Graph 3.  YoY % Change in Expenditures and GDP</div>
<p>A few simple observations:<br />&#8211; The spending increase during the recent recession was modest by any standard, and dwarfed by earlier surges.<br />&#8211; That increase, coupled with the most severe GDP decline since the <i>other</i> Great Depression gave our beloved ratio a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad double whammy.<br />&#8211; GDP growth during this recovery is only marginally better than it was during the 2001-2 low, and far below Clinton era levels.<br />&#8211; Clinton was the most consistently frugal president of the post WW II era &#8211; until now.<br />&#8211; Since the recession was declared over, B. Hoover Obama has been <i>miserly</i>.</p>
<p>One  can legitimately argue that Obama&#8217;s approach to the economy has been  excessively conservative.  Krugman has made this point repeatedly.  I  often say that Clinton governed to the right of Eisenhower &#8211; who was a  genuine deficit hawk &#8211; and that Obama is to the right of Clinton. That  is intended to be slightly hyperbolic, but using this data as the  benchmark, it&#8217;s dead on.</p>
<p>Any questions?</p>

                                <p>Over at <a href="http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2012/09/democrats-day-2.html">Plain Blog</a>, an anonymous wing nut made this off-topic comment.<br />
<blockquote>Now, yes, Bill Clinton and his 2000 federal spending level of 18% of GDP  doesn&#8217;t put him on the fringe, which makes it surprising that you  lefties are celebrating him, even as you hysterically condemn anybody  who resists the Left&#8217;s current  massive  spending levels, which are  nearly 50% greater than Clinton&#8217;s and are spending the nation into  debt  obvlivion.</p></blockquote>
<p>This once again raises the regressive canard that Obama has been a profligate and fiscally irresponsible spender.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s have a look.</p>
<p>Here is a graph of current expenditures that took place in the years of the current century.</p>
<p>
<div><a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fredgraph.png?g=agQ"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fredgraph.png?g=agQ" width="400"></a></div>
<p>First  observation is that anon&#8217;s math isn&#8217;t very good.  Current expenditures  are roughly 100% greater than when Clinton left office, not a mere 50%.</p>
<p>Second  observation is that the vast majority of that increase &#8211; from about  $1900 billion to about $3200 billion &#8211; took place under the previous  administration.</p>
<p>Third observation is that the bulk of  the Obama increase occurred during the recession &#8211; as it should &#8211; from a  bit under $3200 billion to a bit under $3600 billion.  Since then it&#8217;s  crept up to about $3800 billion, and has recently flat-lined.</p>
<p>A  more subtle point is that spending, like many time series data sets,  increases exponentially over time, following population growth.  So,  saying that a value at time B is some percentage greater than the value  at time A communicates essentially zero information.  Context matters. </p>
<p>Let&#8217;s look at expenditures in terms of year over year increase.</p>
<p>
<div><a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fredgraph.png?g=agZ"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fredgraph.png?g=agZ" width="400"></a></div>
<p>Yep, there was a big increase in 2009 and 2010, as social safety net programs kicked in.</p>
<p>Since  then, expenditure growth fell precipitously and now has actually gone  negative.  The last time that happened was in the Eisenhower  administration.  Clearly, Obama has not been profligate.  Would it be an  exaggeration to say he&#8217;s been miserly?</p>
<p>Bill Clinton  did a great job of exposing Republican lies in his speech at the  Democratic convention last night.  But really, it&#8217;s easy.  All you have  to do to refute a regressive is have a quick look at facts and data.</p>

<p>Payroll Employment by Presidential Administrations</p>
<p>Ryan is saying that Obama&#8217;s record is like Jimmy Carter&#8217;s record.</p>
<p>When it comes to employment we should hope so.</p>
<p>During Carter&#8217;s four years in office payroll employment expanded some 10 million,<br />or 12.5%.  or at an average annual rate of 3.1%   This is the second best employment record of<br />any post WW II Presidential administration.  It is almost a full percentage point stronger than<br />Reagan&#8217;s average gain of 2.2%.</p>

<p>I would think the better comparison would be against Bush  where over eight years payroll employment only expanded some 308,000.   Interestingly, in three and a half years under Obama payroll employment  has expanded more that it did over eight years under Bush.</p>

<p>You would think that someone in the press would call the Republicans on their claims.</p>
<p>In modern times every Democratic presidential administration left office with a lower unemployment rate than when they took office.  But only one Republican Administration has managed this accomplishment.</p>

<p>I thought it would be interesting to post this chart of real private GDP in recoveries.</p>
<p>It clearly shows that since the great moderation we have experienced three recoveries that compared to previous recoveries were very weak.  Whether this is the new norm is open to debate.</p>
<p>But interestingly, at this point in the recovery this measure of real private GDP is exactly the same as it was in the last cycle under Bush that Larry Kudlow called the &#8220;Goldilocks&#8221; recovery.</p>

<div>I can’t help but think that Romney’s newly invigorated crony-capital (e.g., Solyndra) schtick is very much a double-edged sword for him.  I mean, isn’t he the candidate who, notwithstanding his claimed concern about the federal deficit, refuses to support the proposed elimination of the federal government’s subsidies to the oil and gas industry, and who (as per a speech he gave last winter in, I think, Utah) wants the federal government to sell most of the national forest and park land to the logging industry because, well, the public doesn’t need those forests and parks?
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Or am I mistaken in thinking that the Koch brothers <a href="http://exiledonline.com/a-people-history-of-koch-industries-part-ii-libertarian-billionaires-charles-and-david-koch-are-closetcase-subsidy-kings-who-milk-big-government-tyranny-but-want-to-slash-spending-on-anyone-else/">have vast oil, gas and logging interests</a>—and that the brothers contribute heavily to Romney, his super PACs and other Republican fundraising groups?
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Or that Romney’s proposal to tie the level of his proposed increases in Defense spending to the level of annual GDP output, rather than, y’know, this country’s national defense needs—might have something to do with crony capitalism?
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Not even to mention a stunningly perverse pinstriped-patronage version of Keynsian economics.  Okay, I’ll mention it:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Romney&#8217;s plan calls for linking the Pentagon&#8217;s base budget to Gross Domestic Product, and allowing the military to spend at least $4 dollars out of every $100 the American economy produces.”
</p>
</div>
<div>&#8212; <i><a href="http://money.cnn.com/2012/05/10/news/economy/romney-defense-spending/index.htm">Defense spending to spike $2.1 trillion under Romney</a></i>, CNN Money, May 10, 2012.)
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Been wondering when this interesting little policy proposal, and its obvious purpose, would start to get some national media attention.  There’s no time like the present.  Not that our blog is a national media outlet.  But we can pretend.

<div>A key but seriously underemphasized factor in the near-collapse of the financial system and economy in 2008 was the role that the two largest securities-ratings firms, Moody’s and Standard and Poors, played: The two agencies routinely and deliberately overrated the value of mortgage-backed securities. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>So I was momentarily (and naively) stunned to read this morning the specifics of the highly-publicized Ernst and Young report released yesterday claiming that Obama’s main tax proposal could cause the loss of 710,00 jobs. A Yahoo! News <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/ticket/white-house-blasts-study-critical-obama-tax-plan-214215322.html">article </a>summarizes:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>On the official White House blog, senior Obama economic policy aide Jason Furman ripped the new study. Among his complaints:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>&#8211;       The report, funded by pro-business groups generally hostile to Obama&#8217;s agenda, assumes that none of the revenue generated by raising taxes on the richest Americans goes to deficit reduction. Instead, it assumes the money would go to expanding government spending. But the president has called for the money to go to reducing the federal deficit and national debt.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>&#8211;       The report omits Obama&#8217;s push for new tax cuts to spur private-sector hiring and investment. By ignoring the predicted impact on jobs growth, Furman argued, the study distorts the impact of the president&#8217;s agenda.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The article goes on to say that “Furman, whose title is Principal Deputy Director of the National Economic Council, also charged that the study&#8217;s conclusions are ‘dramatically out-of-line with estimates by other analysts’ like the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the non-partisan standard for judging the economic impact of federal legislation.”  Furman also noted that the proposal would restore tax rates to their Clinton-era level, a time of significant jobs creation.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Good grace.  Ernst and Young is not an ideological think tank.  Not openly, anyway.  It is instead one of the very largest and most prestigious accounting firms in the world, and, like Moody’s and Standard and Poors, is relied upon by securities investors and merger-and-acquisition folks for honest evaluation of corporate value and the like in SEC filings and private deal-making. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>It also is generally considered a proverbial gold-standard firm in preparing tax documents for corporations and (wealthy) individuals.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Which brings me to the subject of the IRS.  Needless to say, the IRS’s investigatory powers <i>cannot</i> be used for political purposes.  For the most basic and obvious reasons, that would be illegal; it would undermine democracy itself.  (See, e.g., Richard Nixon; Watergate.)  But if this firm is simply altering or removing relevant facts from its computations in order to meet a client’s pre-calculation demand—which apparently is what happened in this instance—its very credibility is so undermined that the firm’s identification on IRS, or for that matter securities, documents, as having played a role in the preparation of the document, should begin to raise red flags for the relevant government agencies.  And for anyone reading a securities prospectus or considering the purchase of, or investment in, a particular business.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>There’s simply a limit to the extent to which relevant facts can be manipulated or discounted and still have the financial representations not amount to fraud.  In the case of this Ernst and Young report, it’s fraud, but not illegal fraud.  But that’s only because the report itself was not part of a securities or IRS filing or some other financial transaction.

                                <div>Okay, okay.  I know that Obama doesn’t read AB.  So I know that his decision, reflected in his speech today at a lunch with Associated Press editors and reporters, to finally—<i>finally</i>—start refuting the Republicans’ economics proposals with actual <i>examples</i> and <i>statistics</i>, was not prompted by my repeated laments here that Obama just doesn’t <i>do</i> specifics, i.e., <i>statistics</i> and other <i>facts</i>, when speaking to the general public, which until now he&#8217;s rarely done anyway.  And my primal pleas that he do so.  (When, earlier this year, he defended his decision to openly approve a Super Pac that supports him, explaining that he decided to not unilaterally disarm, I said to myself: “Hmm. Guess he’s had a change heart, after unilaterally disarming for the last three years.”)

<p>
<div>The New York Times is <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/04/us/politics/obama-attacks-house-gop-budget.html?_r=1&#038;partner=rss&#038;emc=rss&#038;src=igw">reporting </a>on its website:</div>
<div></div>
<div>President Obama opened a full-frontal assault Tuesday on the budget adopted by House Republicans, condemning it as a “Trojan horse” and “thinly veiled social Darwinism” that would greatly deepen inequality in the country.…
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>In the latest of a series of combative speeches, the president said Americans could not afford to elect a Republican president at a time of fragile economic recovery, with a weak job market and a crushing national debt from “two wars, two massive tax cuts and an unprecedented financial crisis.”
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The widening gulf between the rich and everyone else, Mr. Obama said, was hobbling the country’s economic growth. He cited studies that found that societies with less income inequality had stronger and steadier growth.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>“In this country, broad-based prosperity has never trickled down from the success of a wealthy few,” the president said, according to excerpts of his address. “It has always come from the success of a strong and growing middle class. That’s how a generation who went to college on the G.I. Bill, including my grandfather, helped build the most prosperous economy the world has ever known.” …
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>But the president reserved his harshest words for the 2013 budget proposal recently passed by the Republican-controlled House. The budget, drafted by Representative Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, calls for $5.3 trillion in spending cuts, as well as tax cuts for households earning more than $250,000.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>“Disguised as a deficit reduction plan, it’s really an attempt to impose a radical vision on our country. It’s nothing but thinly veiled social Darwinism,” Mr. Obama said. “By gutting the very things we need to grow an economy that’s built to last — education and training, research and development — it’s a prescription for decline.”
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>I&#8217;m absolutely thrilled. Obama’s finally picking up the gauntlet that the Repubs have thrown down, and, calling that spade the spade that it is, is throwing it back.  Hard.  Clear. And with real precision.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>By far the most important parts of what he said are, I think, his references to the WWII generation’s use of the GI Bill and how it effectuated class mobility and helped spur the tremendous economic growth of the three postwar decades, and his actual citation to studies showing that societies with less income inequality had stronger and steadier growth.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Hooray.  Hooray!
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>But I hope he goes even further and compares the tax rates during the 1950s, ‘60s, ‘70s, ‘80s and ‘90s—including capital gains taxes and estate taxes—with today’s tax rates established during the G. W. Bush presidency and, even more important, with the tax rates proposed by the current Republicans.  </div>
<div></div>
<div>Yup.  George Romney and Edward Davies, Ann Romney&#8217;s father, amassed their wealth during Socialism.  They must have been economic Houdinis.  Or  corrupt Commie officials.</div>
<div>
</div>
<p>
<div>I hope Obama also discusses what those higher tax rates bought.  The interstate highway system, for example, and the student loan programs and significant aide to state universities that helped finance so many baby boomers’ college educations.  And that he points out, again and again, that in January 2001 we had no budget-deficit problem because we were raising most of the federal tax revenue needed to pay for most of our federal needs.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Specifics.  Statistics.  To refute the damn lies and the soundbites and clichés.  And to illustrate the consequences.  A picture really <i>is </i>worth a thousand words.  Even if the picture is drawn in words.</div>
<div>
</div>
<div>
</div>
<div>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Here&#8217;s one such picture, already framed: In his State of the Union address earlier this year, Obama acknowledged the problem of spiraling college tuitions and its effect on the ability of college-age members of the so-called working- and even middle-class to attend college, and on the longer-term economic effects upon those who do, using college loans that leave them owing massive debts upon graduation.  Not even to mention the long-term effects on the economy from this huge aggregate debt.  He suggested penalties, in the form of reductions in federal funds, for colleges and universities that don’t find ways to curtail the tuition hikes. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>A day or two later, Linda posted a fact-based refutation, pointing out that the main reason for the incessant tuition hikes at public universities is the incessant cutting of state funding for those universities, necessitated all the more by the economic downturn since 2007 and the resulting decrease in tax revenues and increase in recession-related expenditures.  Not long afterward, I read—I don’t remember where—that one major state university, which was not identified in the article, has seen its state funding reduced from 80% of its total revenue sources to 20% within (I think) the past two decades.  The result, as some longtime professors at state universities lament, is that the student bodies at these schools are now, unlike in earlier relatively-recent times, largely from upscale families, and very few are from working-class families. The level of federal financial assistance to states for colleges and universities obviously impacts this significantly.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>I’d love to hear Obama use this as an example to illustrate that the starve-the-beast juggernaut has broad and profound societal consequences. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>I’d also love to see Obama ask rhetorically what people think will be the consequence of the Republicans’ budget if, during the next economic downturn there  is no funding for unemployment compensation, a need that obviously is in an inverse relation to the unemployment rate and therefore to tax revenues.  And what will we cut from the budget in order to provide emergency disaster funding for, say, hurricane damage?
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>But today was a terrific start.  It’s statistics and other specifics that matter.  And today, for once, he provided some.  Hopefully, it was <i>just</i> the start.
