				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>David Neiwert (h/t <a href="http://www.mystical-politics.blogspot.com/">Rebecca Lesses</a>) <a href="http://crooksandliars.com/david-neiwert/eliminationist-rhetoric-and-shooting">doesn&#8217;t quite get it right</a>:<br />
<blockquote>There will be a lot of hand-wringing in the coming days over the shooting of Rep. Giffords this morning at a constituent event &#8212; some of it, almost certainly, from the folks at Fox, who will wonder aloud how this kind of thing could happen.</p>
<p>It can happen, in fact, because conservatives so thoughtlessly and readily use violent eliminationist rhetoric when talking about &#8220;liberals&#8221; (to wit: anyone who is not a conservative). They will adamantly deny it, of course, but the cold reality is that this kind of talk creates permission for angry and violent people to act it out.</p></blockquote>
<p>Susan of Texas notes that <a href="http://agonyin8fits.blogspot.com/2011/01/nobody-is-responsible-for-anything-ever.html"><em>The Atlantic</em>, in the person of their resident economics and finance blogger, is rather married to the idea as well</a>.</p>
