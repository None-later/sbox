<blockquote>[W]hen the New York Times came and offered [Ross Douhat] a column, he did not turn it down saying &#8220;no, I clearly do not deserve this honour, others are far more qualified for it that me&#8221;.</p></blockquote>
<p>The NYT thinks Douhat&#8217;s important because people link to him.  They neither realize—nor care—that you&#8217;re laughing at him.  They just count the links and think he&#8217;s Valuable.</p>
<p>Stop linking.  Please.  Even the thorough destructions (e.g., <a target="_blank" href="http://lefarkins.blogspot.com/2009/10/concern-trolling-at-its-finest.html">Dave Noon</a>) include the trackback.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t include a link to Douhat.  Think of the children.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I first heard that Michael Jackson died, I thought immediately of Chuck Sullivan.  I met him once, probably in the early 1990s, after his sponsorship of The Jacksons&#8217;s Victory tour savaged his fortune.  Unlike the other Moguls I Have Seen, it seemed his reversal of fortune impacted his mood. (More likely, I just caught him on a bad day.)http://www.blogger.com/post-create.g?blogID=5048766</p>
<p>So I decided to do an AB post about the Victory tour, which was probably the beginning of the end for MJ&#8217;s claim to being &#8220;<a target="_blank" href="http://lefarkins.blogspot.com/2009/06/elvis-has-left-building.html">the new Elvis</a>,&#8221; since it was the last time he toured with his family.</p>
<p>Fortunately, as my Loyal Reader (a loyal Patriots fan) notes, I don&#8217;t have to.  Chad Finn at the Boston Globe <a target="_blank" href="http://www.boston.com/sports/football/patriots/reiss_pieces/2009/06/how_michael_jac.html">tells the story</a>:<br />
<blockquote>[A] disastrous business venture by the Sullivan family &#8212; the founding owners of the franchise &#8212; indirectly helped Kraft fulfill his dream of owning the Patriots&#8230;.Charles Sullivan had used the stadium as collateral to fund the Jackson brothers&#8217; Victory Tour back in 1984. Over-leveraged, Sullivan went bankrupt and was forced to sell the arena.</p></blockquote>
<p>The rest, as they say, is <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/HIStory-Past-Present-Future-Book/dp/B0000029LG/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&#038;s=music&#038;qid=1246036501&#038;sr=1-1">HIStory</a>.</p>
<p>UPDATE:  More discussion of <a target="_blank" href="http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/06/26/from-the-white-house-files-a-fight-over-michael-jackson/?">the Victory tour, the Reagan Administration, and the bitter attitude of a future Supreme Court jutice at the NYT blog</a> h/t <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/GregMitch">Greg Mitchell&#8217;s Twitter feed</a>).</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m not really paying attention to (major league) baseball this year, so I should probably leave this to <a target="_blank" href="http://lefarkins.blogspot.com/">Scott</a>, but, as a query:</p>
<p>For all team that was supposed to have had a major improvement in its middle relief this year, the Yankees appear to have given up a large number (>=7) of runs in the middle and late innings this year.</p>
<p>Is Alan Greenspan the Yankee pitching coach, and assuring the von Steingrabbers that such &#8220;bubbles&#8221; are &#8216;Once in a Century&#8217; moments?</p>
