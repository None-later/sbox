				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We can only hope that the special Infrastructure supplement in today’s edition of <a href="http://www.ft.com/home/us">The Pink One</a> was written and/or edited by a PwC, not an FT, employee.  Otherwise, how are we to explain Michael Peel’s curious declaration in “Unweaving a Tangled Web” that:<br />
<blockquote>…[there is a] continued prevalence of corruption around the complex, lucrative, and transnational global infrastructure industry, <em>despite</em> limited efforts in the past few years to root it out. [emphasis mine]</p></blockquote>
<p>Let’s see: complex (difficult to understand and therefore regulate), lucrative, transnational (easier to create transactions and translational exposures), and facing “limited efforts” at control.  Would anyone—even William Easterly—even consider the possibility that this is not an area more subject than most to regulatory capture at best, and corruption as the norm?</p>
<p>Other sentences we should expect from Mr. Peel:</p>
<blockquote><p>SEC enforcement officials remain overburdened and behind despite Christopher (“Uh, two plus two?  Pass me a calculator.”) Cox having been replaced as its Chair.</p>
<p>BP leadership still want their lives back despite their recent ability to capture almost 10% of the oil escaping from their Deep Horizon drilling site.</p>
<p>Chernobyl-area lumber sales continue to be made primarily in the grey market to unsuspecting customers despite the leak that irradiated those trees being almost twenty years old.</p>
</blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My Loyal Reader sends another example of  <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&#038;sid=agUbc_f0nSuU&#038;refer=home">those glorious, worthy individuals</a> about whom &#8220;we do not have time&#8221; to worry:<br />
<blockquote>Former [AIG] Chief Executive Officer Maurice &#8220;Hank&#8221; Greenberg may try to end government involvement in the company &#8220;as prompt [sic] as possible,&#8221; his attorney David Boies said in an interview this week. Greenberg&#8230;has said the takeover might have been avoided if AIG got a bridge loan, tapped private investors and sold assets.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;<a href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0088170/quotes">Aye, and if my grandmother had wheels, she&#8217;d be a wagon!</a>&#8220;</p>
<p>Did I mention that Greenberg has frequent contact with AIG&#8217;s Board of Directors of AIG, so assuming that he&#8217;s stupid enough to only be suggesting this <em>now</em> is a real stretch?  Did I mention <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/09/saying-it-all.html">that the Fed Rule cited specifically restricts their action to &#8220;unusual and exigent circumstances&#8221;</a>?</p>
<p>Did I mention that the odds that Hank Greenberg was deliberately deceiving some reporter (and that his deception was cited as reality by a rather optimistic Bloomberg scribe) probably approach infinity?</p>
<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_R._Greenberg">sainted 83-year-old Trilateral Commission member</a> continues:<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;How can it be the right move if shareholders lose 80 percent of their equity?&#8221; he said in a Sept. 17 interview. Greenberg, the CEO for almost four decades until [he was ousted in] 2005, controlled about 11 percent of the shares through personal holdings and investment firms he runs before the takeover agreement, the largest stake.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yep, I really want to bail this guy&#8217;s company out, since clearly shareholders &#8220;losing 80% [or 79.9%] of their equity&#8221; <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=F#chart3:symbol=f;range=19970103,20080919;indicator=volume;charttype=line;crosshair=on;ohlcvalues=0;logscale=on;source=undefined">would</a> <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=FNM">never</a> <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=FRE">happen</a> <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=CMGI#chart2:symbol=cmgi;range=my;indicator=volume;charttype=line;crosshair=on;ohlcvalues=0;logscale=on;source=undefined">to</a> <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=JDSU#chart2:symbol=jdsu;range=my;indicator=volume;charttype=line;crosshair=on;ohlcvalues=0;logscale=on;source=undefined">any</a> <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=MER&#038;t=5y&#038;l=on&#038;z=m&#038;q=l&#038;c=">public</a> <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=GM&#038;t=5y">company</a>. (Yes, I picked obvious ones.)</p>
<p>Apparently, Maurice &#8220;Hank&#8221; Greenberg believes we have time, and he&#8217;s a lot more involving in the genesis and exigesis of the current crisis than we are.  So why would we disagree with him?  The return to the &#8220;good&#8221; intertemporal equilibrium may be at stake.</p>
