<p>Models for health care organizations?</p>
<p>In a recent post I opined the Mayo Clinic and Cleveland Clinic, both favorites of President Obama, were not models for wide application to the rest of the nation.</p>
<p>In response to a spirited debate (thanks Coberly) I wrote up these comments.</p>
<p>Starting in the 90s a common model has been the Medical Services Organization, or MSO.</p>
<p>(I seem to remember the MSO evolving from failed staff model HMOs.)</p>
<p>In the model, the hospital or integrated network buys and/or  starts physician practices, manages those practices, and the physicians are employees of the MSO corporation.</p>
<p>Many of the MSOs were/are an attempt to provide adequate primary care medicine in an era when primary care practices are tough to manage. The MSO model allowed a central organization to hire, deploy and re-deploy physicians in accordance with the needs of the community. </p>
<p>Many of the early MSOs failed, for a variety of reasons, but often bad management. Hospital executives thought “I can manage a hospital, therefore I can manage physician groups,”  and that was very misguided thinking.  Some still use that line of thinking, producing poor results.</p>
<p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
<p>The MSO model can be used in both large cities and small communities.</p>
<p>The model allows (or forces) better coordination between physicians and hospitals.</p>
<p>The model can be combined with an insurance product, or not.</p>
<p>The model allows better coordinated negotiations with private insurers.</p>
<p>Patients can often keep their doc, just under a different nameplate.</p>
<p>There is a potential in integrate information systems.</p>
<p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong><br />Hospitals often do a poor job of management.</p>
<p>Hospitals often botch physician contracting.</p>
<p>Most hospitals lose money on MSOs, theoretically making up the difference by capturing ancillaries and through management efficiencies.</p>
<p>Many physicians are lousy employees. Physicians rarely trust hospital executives.</p>
<p>Physician motivation and work ethics change, structuring physician contracts is very difficult.</p>
<p>Specialists, by and large, have not bought into the MSO model, which remains a province of primary care (often including internal medicine and ob-gyn).</p>
<p><strong>Prediction: </strong><br />Health care reform will drive providers to start new MSOs and to expand current MSOs. There will be a honeymoon period, but the marriages may not live happily ever after.</p>

                                <p>by Tom Bozzo</p>
<p>Tyler Cowen <a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2009/06/why-us-policy-is-especially-egalitarian-.html">writes</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Since old, high-bank-account white males have lots of social status and power, [believers in egalitarianism] cannot bring themselves to regard those males as holding very poor overall endowments.</p></blockquote>
<p>Cowen claims that the poor old rich white guys&#8217; supposedly &#8220;poor overall endowments&#8221; arise from the impairment of their human capital at the more-or-less imminent end of life.  There might be half of an argument here if human capital were the only component of individual wealth.  Instead, we have Shorter [*] Tyler Cowen: The rich actually aren&#8217;t so rich if you don&#8217;t count their money.  Whether and to what extent marrying Neutron Jack increased Mrs. Suzy Welch&#8217;s human capital as distinct from social and financial capital is left as an exercise for the reader.</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s pretty easy to construct an exception to Cowen&#8217;s claim that<br />
<blockquote>The &#8220;poorest&#8221; people are not those with low incomes but rather those with low human capital endowments.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Take a suitably dimwitted heir to a sufficiently large fortune and I will show you someone not only a lot richer than a comparably bright person who picked his or her parents badly, but in fact just about everyone else.</p>
<p>Now Cowen actually is right to point out that the U.S. health care system provides plenty of care to seniors at the end of life despite what I will agree are often modest endowments of wealth (including, but not necessarily limited to, human capital).  The inference that this makes the U.S. health care system more egalitarian than European systems, however, is highly questionable to say the least.  First of all, health care for the elderly is the most European part of the U.S. system: more-or-less universal, more-or-less socialized medicine.  Second, to the extent European systems spend (relatively) less money on the elderly, they don&#8217;t have obviously worse outcomes (shorter lives, etc.) to show for it.</p>
<p>Subject the elderly to the more-or-less private sector part of the U.S. system and those financial endowments are likelier to drive allocations of health care resources.  And indeed it tends to be individuals with high human capital endowments who get the jobs with benefits that provide decent health care.  Certainly the state of the U.S. health care system isn&#8217;t going to make me, whether egalitarian-minded or acting on pure self-interest, more inclined on the margin to switch places with the middle-aged immigrant behind the McDonald&#8217;s counter next door to the office.  A leveling possibility in the U.S. system is that a bout of unemployment coinciding with an unlucky draw from the distribution of health outcomes can leave a middle-aged economics PhD approximately as screwed as the guy at McDonald&#8217;s, but reasonable people can reject race-to-the-bottom egalitarianism.  I&#8217;ll wager the lower-endowment exceptions with decent health insurance are disproportionately public-sector employees (where a common complaint from conservatives and libertarians is that they have it too good relative to their private-sector counterparts; see e.g. U.S. Postal Service, bargaining-unit employees of) and other unionized workers.</p>
<p>The egalitarian reformer of the U.S. may reasonably conclude that fairness is best served by making the U.S. system more like the Europeans, or by promoting public plans over private ones.</p>

                                <p>Robert Waldmann</p>
<p>Tilman Tacke and I are quite cautious in <a target="_blank" href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/03/income-distribution-infant-mortality.html">this paper</a> which does not support my pet theory described in <a target="_blank" href="http://ideas.repec.org/a/tpr/qjecon/v107y1992i4p1283-302.html">this paper</a>.  The stylized fact (which has returned after a brief absence from the data) is that, given the income of poorer quintiles, where the rich are richer more babies die.  My pet theory is that this is due to &#8220;distortion of consumption&#8221; where the poor imitate the consumption of the rich (which is more costly the richer the rich are) and this foolish spending causes infant mortality.</p>
<p>It turns out that this bold idea wasn&#8217;t totally new after all.  I just found it in <br />The Wealth of Nations by Adam Smith first published in 1776.</p>
<p>I explain after the jump.</p>
<p>The idea appears really really appears on page 1103 (Book 5 Chapter 2 article 4 section 2 &#8220;taxes  on consumable commodities&#8221;) of my copy of The Wealth of Nations by Adam Smith published in 1776.<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;Consumable commodities are either luxuries or necessaries,</p>
<p>By necessaries I understand not only the commodities which are indispensably necessary for the support of life, but whatever the custom of the country renders it indecent for creditable people, to be without.  A linen shirt, for example, is, strictly speaking, not a necessary of life.  The Greeks and Romans lived, I suppose, very comfortably though they had no linen.  But in the present times, through the greater part of Europe, a creditable day lobourer would be ashamed to appear in public without a linen shirt, the want of which would be supposed to denote that disgraceful degree of poverty, which, it is presumed, no body can well fall into without extreme bad conduct.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>He argues that, therefore taxes on necessaries will drive up wages in the long run.<br />To understand you have to know Smith&#8217;s theory of wages which is that the steady state wage is such that population neither grows nor shrinks and at a lower wage population will shrink due to increased mortality due to poverty. So his claim is that taxing necessaries, including linen shirts in Europe in 1776, would cause the population to decline due to increased mortality.  This only makes sense if he believes that, in order to wear a linen shirt, Europeans of his day would skimp on food to an extent which increased the mortality of their children.</p>
<p>This is made very clear when, in contrast, Smith argues that a tax on luxuries consumed by the poor will not affect wages in the long run<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;The different taxes which have in the course of the present century been imposed on spirituous liquors, are not supposed to have had any effect on the wages of labour. &#8230;<br />The high price of such commodities does not necessarily diminish the ability of the inferior ranks of people to bring up families.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>That is a high price of linen shirts will necessarily diminish the ability of the inferior ranks of people to bring up families &#8230; by causing their children to die.</p>
<p>Smith definitely did not consider any form of contraception including abstinence.  He is quite clear on the idea that steady state wages are determined by infant and child mortality in book 1 chapter 8.</p>
<p>To get to causation rich are richer so more babies die one just needs to add that average standards of living affect what goods &#8220;the custom of the country renders it indecent for creditable people, to be without.&#8221;</p>
<p>So I guess I wasn&#8217;t the first to come up with the idea.  However, I was only 216 years late.</p>
<p>The most flaky far out interpretation of the stylized fact (destroyed by including pubhealth anyway) is clearly stated in The Wealth of Nations.  Wow.</p>

                                <p>Via Dr. Black, we <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2008/10/28/news/economy/health_care_and_election/?postversion=2008102807">get CNN reporting</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Younger, healthier workers likely wouldn&#8217;t abandon their company-sponsored plans, said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, McCain&#8217;s senior economic policy adviser.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why would they leave?&#8221; said Holtz-Eakin. &#8220;What they are getting from their employer is way better than what they could get with the credit.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>And why is it better?  Because of the tax credit that is going away.</p>
<p>But let&#8217;s be nice to a man who has, in the past few months, eliminated his credibility to ensure that no ex-GWBush Administration official retains his or her reputation after leaving office.*  Let&#8217;s assume he&#8217;s telling the truth.</p>
<p>So the young, healthy workers stay with the employer plan (that, miraculously, doesn&#8217;t go away in a miasma of Moral Hazard**).  This leaves the older workers, who no longer get a decent deal from their employer, to find something in the marketplace.</p>
<p>Gosh, guess what happens when your selection group becomes more Adverse? Costs go up.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s review what Holtz-Eakin has actually declared, explicitly and by implication:
<ol>
<li>Younger workers will keep the employer-provided health insurance, since it would cost them more to buy on their own</li>
<li>Older workers won&#8217;t be provided with insurance, and it will cost them Even More than More to buy health insurance on their own.</li>
</ol>
<p>Even if we were ignoring that Health Insurance is <strong>NOT HEALTH <em>CARE</em></strong>,*** John McCain&#8217;s proposal, by the admission of his own Economic Advisor, makes the <em>current</em> situation appear <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_optimal">Pareto-optimal</a>.</p>
<p>Which leaves us only one question: Why would any economist <em>support</em> it?</p>
<p>*I should probably stipulate positive here.  For instance, anyone who followed Condi &#8220;I was National Security Advisor on 11 Sep 2001&#8221; Rice&#8217;s prior career wouldn&#8217;t have expected much from her.</p>
<p>**Using the actual Health Economics definition here, not the generic phrase to describe why we need to give Goldman Sachs and Jamie Dimon $700 Billion.</p>
<p>***Yes, I&#8217;m shouting.  Claiming to address health care when all you address is health insurance is like claiming to have fixed a smashed-in door by changing the lock on it.</p>

                                <p>by Tom Bozzo</p>
<p><a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/10/cant-anybody-pl.html">Brad DeLong blogs</a> the train wreck at a clown show that is the McCain campaign so I don&#8217;t have to (big report due in a week, sorry ).  He has a twofer.</p>
<p>First, there&#8217;s the the McCain health plan.  Or, rather, the evolution from</p>
<p>We&#8217;re phoning it in, to</p>
<p>OMG, people are <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/09/mccains-health-plan-tax-cut-or-tax-hike.html">looking at it and figuring out ways it might suck</a>, so</p>
<p>Sweeten it, but&#8230;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s too expensive for our small-government-conservative narrative, and voila,</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s commit political suicide!!<br />
<blockquote>You know, we have llike seen this before. On health care:</p>
<ul>
<li>McCain started with a tax credit that was equal in aggregate to the additional tax he levied on employer-sponsored health benefits in the first year&#8211;in later years the credit became much smaller than the tax.</li>
<li>Then it was like ooops, that&#8217;s not popular. We know&#8211;we never intended to subject employer-sponsored benefits to the FICA tax, only to the income tax.</li>
<li>Then it was like ooops, now we&#8217;re scared that the plan is fiscally irresponsible and will raise the deficit. We know&#8211;we will cut Medicare!</li>
<li>Then it was like ooops, we have to carry Floria. We know&#8211;have Sarah Palin say that McCain will not cut but will protect your entitlements.</li>
</ul>
<p>Can&#8217;t anybody play this game? If we lose the election to these clowns, I am going to be really embarrassed. It seems as though nothing is competently staffed out&#8211;as if nobody in the McCain campaign cares about actually having policy proposals, but only about having something incoherent that an ignorant and lazy reporter can be deceived into thinking is a policy proposal.</p></blockquote>
<p>Second, on the housing crisis, McCain pulls his new bailout plan out of his behind at the &#8220;debate.&#8221;  However:<br />
<blockquote>But it soon develops that much of Senator McCain&#8217;s proposal is not his but Barney Frank&#8217;s, and that the differences make it not a homeowner relief bill but an imprudent banker profit and rescue bill.</p></blockquote>
<p>And so our so-called conservatives want to nationalize negative home equity (that&#8217;s some concern for the taxpayer, there):<br />
<blockquote>[DeLong quoting the Politco] “Clearly we face the trade off that we would in fact be taking the negative equity position and putting it on the taxpayers books instead of putting it on the private lenders books or the homeowners books,” Holtz-Eakin told Politico. “We think the balance of risk has shifted to the point where this is the way to go.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Does the McCain website say that?  No.<br />
<blockquote>But by the time I got to the website, it read differently:</p>
<blockquote><p>JohnMcCain.com &#8211; McCain-Palin 2008: For those that cannot make payments, mortgages must be re-structured to put losses on the books and put homeowners in manageable mortgages. <s>Lenders in these cases must recognize the loss that they’ve already suffered.</s> [Apparently that last sentence was struck by a panicked editor &#8212; ATB.]</p></blockquote>
<p>Apparently the schmuck who was assigned the job of writing up the web description did not believe the plan could possibly be what he was told it was.</p></blockquote>
<p>Most deliciously, someone couldn&#8217;t stop from thinking out loud in naming the &#8220;program,&#8221; such as it is: it&#8217;s the &#8220;American Homeownership Resurgence Plan (McCain Resurgence Plan).&#8221;  Apparently it&#8217;s change someone can believe in.</p>

<p>McCain <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122315505846605217.html?mod=googlenews_wsj">is going after Medicare and Medicaid</a>.<br />
<blockquote>But Douglas Holtz-Eakin, Sen. McCain&#8217;s senior policy adviser, said Sunday that the campaign has always planned to fund the tax credits, in part, with savings from Medicare and Medicaid. Those government health-care programs serve seniors, poor families and the disabled. Medicare spending for the fiscal year ended Sept. 30 is estimated at $457.5 billion.</p></blockquote>
<p>At least he made it official.</p>
<p>Call those Florida relatives now.</p>
<p>UPDATE:  PGL beat me to this one by about half an hour and is much nicer about the proposal than I <a href="http://econospeak.blogspot.com/2008/10/mccains-health-care-for-well-to-do-but.html">over at Econospeak</a>.  (Then again, I&#8217;m not a &#8220;deficit hawk&#8221;—precisely because of reasons like this.)</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>The Tax Foundation sent me an e-mail pointing me to <a href="http://www.taxfoundation.org/blog/show/23599.html">Gerald Prante</a> (who&#8217;s participated in our comments section in the past) taking <a href="http://www.time-blog.com/swampland/2008/09/mccains_health_care_tax_increa.html">Joe Klein</a> to task for calling McCain&#8217;s proposed $5,000* refundable tax credit that would offset income tax on health insurance benefits &#8220;insufficient.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what the McCain web site has to say:<br />
<blockquote>While still having the option of employer-based coverage, every family will receive a direct refundable tax credit &#8211; effectively cash &#8211; of $2,500 for individuals and $5,000 for families to offset the cost of insurance. Families will be able to choose the insurance provider that suits them best and the money would be sent directly to the insurance provider. Those obtaining innovative insurance that costs less than the credit can deposit the remainder in expanded Health Savings Accounts.</p></blockquote>
<p>The McCain campaign already deserves a few demerits for this representation of the plan.  First, they don&#8217;t mention the tax increase that the health insurance credit offsets.  Second, a credit that&#8217;s provided directly to insurers in lieu of (some) insurance premiums and then could be rolled over into an HSA if there&#8217;s something left over (which there won&#8217;t be for any family buying low-deductible health insurance) doesn&#8217;t sound much like it&#8217;s &#8220;effectively cash.&#8221;</p>
<p>Klein calls the McCain credit &#8220;insufficient&#8221; because it won&#8217;t pay the premium for typical employer-provided family coverage.  (<a href="http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/UploadedPDF/411750_updated_candidates_summary.pdf">Analysis</a> [PDF] of the plan by the Tax Policy Center indeed yields the result that the McCain plan would not provide for much insurance uptake among the currently-uninsured.)  Prante claims that Klein doesn&#8217;t know the difference between a credit and a deduction, and provides a calculation purporting to show that the value of the deduction that McCain would repeal is less than the credit:<br />
<blockquote>What [Klein] fails to understand is that the $5,000 value of the credit would be worth more than the current exclusion for almost any taxpayer. For example, a family in the 25% bracket would have its income tax before credits increase by .25 * 12,000 = $3,000. However, the family would be getting a $5,000 CREDIT that trumps the $3,000 extra in taxes from the elimination of the exclusion. Even&#8230; in the 35% bracket, the family having $12,000 in insurance would come out ahead.</p></blockquote>
<p>End of story?  Not quite.</p>
<p>In the quibble department, Prante assumes that the federal income tax exclusion can be repealed without state tax consequences.  To the extent state income definitions follow the feds, state taxes would take away several hundred more dollars of the credit.</p>
<p>The big question is whether today&#8217;s $12,000 employer-sponsored plan would still be available for no more than $12,000.  That depends on factors such as the employer exercising its &#8220;option&#8221; to continue to offer a group plan, and healthy members of the group resisting the incentives that the McCain plan provides to defect to the high-deductible insurance/HSA combination.</p>
<p>While McCain promotes the &#8220;option&#8221; of retaining existing coverage, the McCain plan&#8217;s incentives exacerbate &#8220;adverse selection death spiral&#8221; problems that particularly affect small groups under current policies.  That is, increasing the price of insurance coverage on the margin would encourage the healthy and/or lucky-feeling to exit relatively expensive group plans, with the tax credit intended to encourage substituting the combination of a high-deductible individual plan and accompanying HSA.  This leaves the comprehensive plans&#8217; members sicker, or at least lossier, and drives up prices for remaining participants.  (Repeat until the high price collapses the plan.)  The <a href="http://content.healthaffairs.org/cgi/content/full/hlthaff.27.6.w472/DC1">Buchmueller et al. review of the McCain plan</a> in Health Affairs mentions but does not quantify the potential effects of breaking up existing risk pools.</p>
<p>For employees sent to the individual market because employers drop group coverage, Buchmueller et al. suggest that insurance expenditures would increase markedly.  They indicate that the typical $12,000 group policy for a family would cost roughly $2,000 more to obtain in the individual market (and note that many plans in the individual market have lower prices but much lower coverage).</p>
<p>In Prante&#8217;s calculation, the $12,000 policy costs someone in the 25% bracket $9000 after income tax.  The $14,000 equivalent individual policy with the McCain family-level tax credit costs $9000 after income tax.  So we&#8217;ve already exhausted the purported net benefit of the McCain tax credit for a family that wants to keep its coverage but is knocked out of the employer-sponsored group market.  But the situation is actually worse than that, because shifting $9000 in compensation from benefits, which apparently the McCain plan would still exempt from payroll taxes, to wages subjects the compensation in lieu of benefits to payroll tax as well.  This can increase taxes up to $1377 (at 15.3%) in this example, depending on where the hypothetical family&#8217;s wages stand with respect to the Social Security contribution and benefit base (currently $102,000).</p>
<p>Having <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/08/right-wing-anti-tax-machine-doesnt-have.html">recently seen</a> the Tax Foundation concerned about Obama policies that would raise tax rates a few percentage points on high earners, it would be remiss of me to point out that the combined tax rates on wages paid in lieu of health benefits would be just as high for middle-class taxpayers under McCain&#8217;s health plan. That&#8217;s 25% for federal income tax, 5% or so for state taxes, and 15.3% for payroll taxes, 45.3% altogether, for compensation that current law and Obama policies would tax at 0%!  (A new Tax Foundation <a href="http://www.taxfoundation.org/publications/show/23610.html">issue brief</a> on the subject which otherwise mostly <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BradDelongsSemi-dailyJournal/~3/395454361/this-is-a-joke.html">invents a big number</a> for the McCain plan&#8217;s reduction in the uninsured does at least acknowledge this in passing.)  Since the McCain plan would, in the estimation of Buchmueller et al., shift millions of workers and their dependents to the individual market (representing 5 to about 15 percent of individuals covered under employer-sponsored plans; references in the article), the prospect of tax increases under the McCain plan is by no means vanishingly rare.  Indeed, shifting people to the individual market is basically a feature of the plan, and not a bug — a part of the program is to de-link employment and health insurance and that&#8217;s a legitimate policy goal.</p>
<p>This also leaves the question of just why conservative health reformers think we need to impose what amounts (vs. current policy) to a Pigovian tax on health insurance.  In the <a href="http://content.healthaffairs.org/cgi/content/full/hlthaff.27.6.w462/DC1">companion piece on the Obama plan</a> by Antos et al. also in Health Affairs, there&#8217;s talk of &#8220;perverse incentives&#8221; under the current system but not a lot of beef beyond econ 101-style handwaving:<br />
<blockquote>The following analysis reflects the authors&#8217; concern that Senator Obama&#8217;s failure to address the perverse incentives in the U.S. health system will exacerbate the cost problem he has argued must be solved if we are to achieve anything close to universal coverage. Tax subsidies that promote first-dollar coverage have led consumers, health care providers, and suppliers to act as if any service that might yield some value, no matter how small, should be covered. Subsidized third-party payment has helped drive up health spending and, as demonstrated by the <em>Dartmouth Atlas,</em> sometimes has even led to poorer health outcomes. Realistic expectations about cost, value, and the outcomes that health care is likely to provide must be better understood by all parties.</p></blockquote>
<p>An upshot of recent <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/09/alice-in-co-payland.html">health-care cost-shifting</a> between employers and employees is that &#8220;first-dollar&#8221; coverage is now rare.  I&#8217;ve had true first-dollar coverage in the distant past, ain&#8217;t got it now, and couldn&#8217;t have it for a premium that would keep my small employer-sponsored group together.  A main idea behind copayments and coinsurance is to avoid some obvious free-as-in-beer-goods problems by not covering the first dollar.</p>
<p>Moreover, they totally beg a central economic efficiency question: given the disconnection between health care prices and marginal costs, it&#8217;s far obvious that allocative efficiency is better served by exposing consumers to something like the list prices of routine services as opposed to the co-payments or co-insurance.  (Exercises: What&#8217;s the marginal cost of a $150-list-price office visit where you spend 5 minutes with a nurse and 5 minutes with the doctor?  Of a $1000 CT scan?  The $200 month&#8217;s supply of an on-patent drug?)  Explanation of benefits forms provide routine evidence that much or most of the price of various health-care services is markup.**</p>
<p>Of course, dynamic efficiency considerations mean that incremental cost constraints must be satisfied somehow — marginal cost prices wouldn&#8217;t be compensatory for the doctors, clinics, and hospitals.  But efficiency-improving pricing arrangments that better align prices with marginal costs such as &#8220;two-part tariffs&#8221; (where customers pay a fixed charge plus variable usage-based charges; see e.g. your electric, gas, or [limited-usage] phone bill) can look a lot more like traditional insurance with what Antos et al. characterize as &#8220;modest&#8221; cost sharing than a high-deductible health plan plus an HSA.  On this front, the conservative reform approach involves an unforgivable conflation of price and cost.***</p>
<p>Nor do some of the &#8220;perversions&#8221; sound all that perverse as features of private or social insurance.  On Obama&#8217;s proposal to establish a federal reinsurance pool, Antos et al. write:<br />
<blockquote>Even though employers would welcome the subsidy, the reinsurance does not reduce health care use or cost. Instead, the policy just shifts some of the cost to the federal budget and could even increase health care spending. Insurers and providers might be encouraged to provide more services to patients who were above the catastrophic threshold since the federal government was sharing in the cost.</p>
<p>The proposal could also lead to anomalous results. One neonatal intensive care stay could lead to federal catastrophic payments for an employer with younger employees (and lower health costs per employee), while an employer with older workers and much higher per employee costs might receive no subsidy for the costs of managing chronic conditions.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is just about 180-degrees backwards.  True, risk-spreading does not in itself reduce the cost of health care, but it does reduce the cost of health insurance, and reducing the cost of insurance helps promote efficient (multi-part) pricing of health care.  Moreover, million-dollar NICU trips and the like are exactly the sort of losses for which reinsurance is appropriate.  In the absence of adequate reinsurance, catastrophic losses are a death-spiral trigger, since especially small groups end up with huge premium increases leading to collapse of the plans one way or another.   As for covering chronic conditions such as aging, the factoid that most of us would like to grow old and healthy, and be well-cared-for in the alternative, suggests a role for intergenerational transfer mechanisms for equitable distribution of the costs.</p>
<p>It might be argued that the reinsurance services could be provided privately, but what I&#8217;ve heard from people involved with such matters at local health insurers is that health care reinsurance isn&#8217;t a candidate for Marginal Revolution&#8217;s &#8216;markets in everything&#8217; series.</p>
<p>Hoisted from our archives, here&#8217;s <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2004/09/kerrys-health-care-reinsurance.html">Kash from 2004</a> addressing the question of whether the reinsurance pool (also a Kerry proposal) would increase costs:<br />
<blockquote>How would this national reinsurance pool help our nation&#8217;s health care problem? In a couple of ways. First and most obviously, it would simply reduce the cost to health insurers of providing health insurance, resulting in lower premiums. Part of this cost would be shifted to taxpayers, but as we shall see, the cost to taxpayers will be less than the savings reaped by people buying health insurance&#8230;</p>
<p>Think of it this way. Since the claims for one seriously ill person can easily reach $100,000 or more in a year (while most people&#8217;s claims are probably just in the hundreds of dollars), it&#8217;s much harder for an insurance company to predict what the aggregate health care costs will be of a group of 10 people compared to a group of 1,000 people. The law of large numbers means that you can pretty much rely on population averages when trying to guess how much health care the large group will need over the year; but for the small group, you either have to spend a lot of time and energy evaluating each of the 10 individuals to estimate each one&#8217;s likely health care needs for the coming year, or else you have to just take a chance. And insurance companies hate just taking chances.</p>
<p>The best estimates that I have seen by an economist of the effects of this reinsurance proposal are those by Kenneth Thorpe, professor at Emory&#8217;s school of public health. <a href="http://www.sph.emory.edu/hpm/thorpe/nobugthorpe2.pdf">He estimates</a> that the Kerry plan would reduce the variance of firms&#8217; insurance claims by about 50 percent. This in turn will have two effects. It means that it will become dramatically cheaper for small firms to provide health insurance to their employees. Combined with the plan&#8217;s requirement that all participating firms offer health insurance to all employees, Thorpe estimates that about 3 million currently uninsured people will start receiving health insurance. This in turn will help to reduce the country&#8217;s overall health care costs by allowing more preventative care and early detection of health problems.</p></blockquote>
<p>That is, since insurance costs depend on the variance of the losses, insufficient reinsurance implies higher risk premia paid to insurers, and those premia are big.</p>
<p>So McCain policies would raise taxes on lots of middle-class workers and dramatically increase marginal tax rates on some middle-class earnings regardless of the net benefits (something conservatives wring their hands over in other contexts), not obviously in service of aligning health care prices and marginal costs and without features that promote efficient risk-sharing.  That&#8217;s changiness we shouldn&#8217;t believe in, my friends.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p>* For a family; individuals would get $2500.  Observe that there&#8217;s a family insurance penalty in the plan, as family plan premiums are commonly more than double individual premiums.</p>
<p>** E.g., the negotiated price between my health plan and the UW hospital for my son&#8217;s emergency appendectomy last year was roughly 1/3 of list.</p>
<p>*** Yes, people use &#8220;cost&#8221; when they mean &#8220;price&#8221; colloquially all the time; the problem is not considering price/cost ratios carefully when arguing that one price promotes economic efficiency better than another.</p>

                                <p>The essence of &#8220;market-based&#8221; health care &#8220;reforms&#8221; is that patients are exposed to the prices of the services that they receive (or are offered) and choose not to consume those with low perceived net benefits.  With high-deductible health plans favored by conservative reformers, this means paying out of pocket for routine services. [*] This is a centerpiece of <a href="http://www.johnmccain.com/Informing/Issues/19ba2f1c-c03f-4ac2-8cd5-5cf2edb527cf.htm">health care reform a la McCain</a>, in the mild camouflage of &#8220;innovative insurance&#8221; and &#8220;expand[ed] benefits of health savings accounts.&#8221;  [**] These plans already have been growing rapidly with a push from Bush and congressional Republican policies.</p>
<p>So how are they working out?  <a href="http://www.startribune.com/business/27701694.html?elr=KArksUUUU">In the S&#8217;trib&#8217;</a>, Chen May Yee finds that market magic does not always include putting enough dollars in those pockets:
</p>
<blockquote><p>Once a month, doctors and staff at Edina [Minnesota] Sports Health &#038; Wellness stay late to talk business&#8230;. Then there&#8217;s the topic nobody likes: which patients to drop because they aren&#8217;t paying their bills.</p>
<p>The clinic has been terminating an average of 16 patients a month. Most have high-deductible health plans and haven&#8217;t paid their bills for more than nine months&#8230;</p>
<p>Break-up letters from doctors are just one unintended consequence in the roll-out of high-deductible plans, the fastest-growing segment of the medical insurance market as traditional plans become ever more unaffordable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yee reports that the breakups happen in relatively special cases (e.g. small clinics that can&#8217;t afford to provide much uncompensated care) and information on the extent of the phenomenon is anecdotal.  However, larger organizations are seeing increases in uncompensated care provided to the theoretically-insured:
</p>
<blockquote><p>Last year, [Hennepin County Medical Center] gave away $86 million in uncompensated care &#8212; $4 million, or 4.7 percent, to insured patients. This year, HCMC expects $90 million in uncompensated care, with 8.4 percent, or $7.5 million, from insured patients&#8230;</p>
<p>Fairview Health Services, Regions Hospital and HealthEast Care System also are seeing more unpaid bills from insured patients. Like HCMC, they&#8217;re nonprofit, with policies not to turn patients away.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I might suggest that a system is only so market-based when it relies on the public or (publicly-subsidized) nonprofit sectors to cover its failures.  And for an added bonus, the system is not necessarily cheaper to administer:
</p>
<blockquote><p>Medical billing offices are working harder than ever. What used to be paid by insurance in a couple of weeks is now being stretched out to two- to six-month payment plans for patients, said Randi Tapio, chief executive of Medical Billing Professionals in St. Cloud, a firm that works with independent physician offices.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re sending statements every month, calling them,&#8221; Tapio said. &#8220;Our costs go up.&#8221;</p>
<p>If a patient is uninsured, a clinic can ask for payment upfront or devise an early payment plan. But with insured patients, health plans require that clinics wait until after the service and the health plan determines who owes what. By then, the patient is out the door.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But never fear, improved bill-collection technology is here!</p>
</p>
<blockquote><p>Recently, [a] clinic began asking patients having costly procedures such as surgeries to swipe a credit card upfront. An estimated amount is authorized but not charged until the health plan sends a letter saying what the patient owes&#8230;</p>
<p>HealthEast clinics are looking into check-in kiosks, like those at airports, where patients insert a credit card and are asked if they want to pay their co-pay.</p>
<p>&#8220;The thing is to be more intentional about collecting,&#8221; said Keith Rahn, who oversees HealthEast clinic billing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=U.S._Chamber_of_Commerce">U.S. Chamber of Commerce</a> has been running &#8216;issue ads&#8217; telling Minnesotans that Sen. Norm Coleman has been working to keep government out of health care decisions.  The credit-card companies, not so much.</p>
<p></p>
<p>[*] Which is to say, the premise of the system is that its biggest problem is overconsumption of routine care.  In this regard, it runs against the current of some traditional health plans which have been reducing out-of-pocket shares for some expenditures (e.g. related to chronic conditions like diabetes) because their members are perceived as not being good at picking and paying for the higher-return care.</p>
<p>[**] Amusingly, while Obama issues pages generally link to more detailed <a href="http://www.barackobama.com/pdf/issues/HealthCareFullPlan.pdf">briefing documents</a> [PDF], a &#8220;Learn More About the McCain Health Care Reform Plan&#8221; link takes visitors to <a href="http://www.johnmccain.com/healthcare/">this page</a> with a few bullet points and an auto-playing video ad, which in turn links back to the issues page for &#8220;the facts.&#8221;</p>
