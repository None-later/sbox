                                <p>The most interesting presentation I saw at the AEA last January was Maccini and Yang&#8217;s discussion of the effect of rainfall on the health and growth of Indonesian babies.* It was subsequently discussed as <a href="http://papers.nber.org/papers/w14031">an NBER working paper</a>** by <a href="http://healthcare-economist.com/2008/06/12/are-wet-babies-healthy-babies/">Jason Shafrin</a>, and the thing that made it most interesting is that Maccini and Yang found an effect on female children, but not one on male children. </p>
<p>But that&#8217;s a developing economy.  Would the same type of thing happen in a developed nation?</p>
<p>Apparently, via <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2008/08/links-for-20-11.html">Mark Thoma&#8217;s links</a>, the answer is <a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2008-08/ifts-bda081108.php">yes</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>People who suffer from cardiovascular diseases at advanced ages may have reason to suspect that the cause of their illness lies far away &#8230; around the date of their birth. A team of European researchers reports that if economic conditions at the time of birth were bad, then this leads to a higher risk of cardiovascular mortality much later in life.</p></blockquote>
<p>The researchers used Danish twins born around the turn of the (19th into 20th) century as their baseline.  And the nature-nurture difference appears to be at the margin:<br />
<blockquote>The twin data come with an added bonus. They make it possible to check whether a twin pair&#8217;s health outcomes are more similar later in life if they were born under adverse conditions than if they were born under good conditions. It turns out that, indeed, they are more similar later in life if the starting position was bad. Conversely, if an individual is born under better conditions, then individual-specific factors dominate more. In short, individual-specific qualities come more to fruition if the starting position in life is better.</p></blockquote>
<p>The full paper is available <a href="http://ftp.iza.org/dp3635.pdf">here</a> (PDF).</p>
<p>*The reasoning for such a study seems fairly straightforward: babies are most affected in their earlier years, rainy seasons—especially in subsistence-farming areas—should tend to produce a better crop yield and therefore marginally more calories available to babies. So the alternative hypothesis should be that rainy seasons produce healthier children, as reflected in schooling accomplishments and height, among other things.<br />**[Free version <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~deanyang/papers/macciniyang_undertheweather.pdf">here</a>; PDF]</p>

<p>AKA</p>
<p><a href="http://abcnews.go.com/print?id=5257935">&#8216;Her Way&#8217;</a>; Obama Health Plan Could Go In Clinton&#8217;s Direction<br />Teddy Davis, John Santucci and Gregory Wallace  ABC News  06.29.2008</p>
<blockquote><p>Obama&#8217;s surrogate [Dr. Kavita Patel] made her comments Wednesday while representing him at a National Journal health-policy forum moderated by Ron Brownstein, the political director of Atlantic Media.</p>
<p>Patel&#8217;s individual mandate remarks were made in response to an insurance industry leader suggesting at the same forum that insurers will oppose Obama&#8217;s plan as currently structured. Insurers are worried that the Illinois Democrat has not tied an individual mandate to &#8220;guaranteed issue,&#8221; the industry&#8217;s term for requiring patients to be covered without regard to pre-existing conditions.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve had the conversation about . . . guaranteed issue,&#8221; said Karen Ignagni, the president and CEO of America&#8217;s Health Insurance Plans. &#8220;But we are prepared to have that conversation in the insurance industry <bold>if</bold> the politicians are ready to stand up and say <bold>we are going to get everyone in.&#8221;</bold></p>
<p>Ignagni&#8217;s words are watched closely because the organization she heads emerged from the Health Insurance Association of America, sponsors of the &#8220;Harry and Louise&#8221; ads which played a critical role in killing Clinton&#8217;s effort to reform health-care in the 1990s.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I didn&#8217;t see that coming, but I should have. Obama&#8217;s plan has the part consumers like but has the problem that it would bankrupt the health insurance industry. Hmmm what if his plan was to terrify them into accepting universal health insurance with the public sector allowed to compete ? Current proposal sounds lovely. It would make it advantageous to the young and healthy to wait till they get sick to get insurance. The problem is that it could cause the industry to enter a death spiral.</p>
<p>But it sounds lovely. Do you want to bet your industry on your ability to stop the 46 year old African American major party nominee whose middle name is Hussein and who beat the police and the newly elected Democratic governor in a *unanimous* Illinois senate vote ? Better to deal I&#8217;d say. Maybe, just maybe, Ignagni really agrees with me that opposing Obama on a superficially appealing plan whose only fault is that it will destroy her industry is not a bright move.</p>
<p>And look at the headline from <a href="http://www.greenchange.org/"> Green Change</a>. We have Obama caving to the health insurance industry by accepting 100% universal health insurance (sort of like the time that he <a href="http://rjwaldmann.blogspot.com/2007/11/i-agree-with-ed-kilgore-and-disagree.html">adopted Republican talking points</a> by proposing his donut social security funding huge progressive tax increase, class war, soak the rich and spread it out thin plan).</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if he is is just brilliant or is also blessed.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there is no solution to the problems of London and New York relative to Paris.  I believe Dani Rodrik, in another context, <a href="http://rodrik.typepad.com/dani_rodriks_weblog/2008/06/the-economist-evaluates-the-randomized-evaluators.html">explained why this may be so</a>, even if his commenters appear to miss the point.</p>

                                <p>By: Divorced one like Bush</p>
<p>From this story at <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/archive/2008/06/10/9534/">Common Dreams</a> comes the news that Senator Obama has chosen Jason Furman as an economic advisor.  The story notes Mr. Furman&#8217;s fame for his defending of the <a href="http://www.americanprogress.org/kf/walmart_progressive.pdf">Walmart model</a>. The one that states Walmart is helping the less fortunate.   I don&#8217;t buy it in the big picture scheme of viewing.  In fact, we at AB have had this discussion and I even posted a link to a report from the EPI which noted not everything related to ones financial well being can be bought at Walmart.  Frankly, there are some very big items that are not on Walmart&#8217;s shelves that take up a large portion of ones budget.</p>
<p>He has held a good <a href="http://wagner.nyu.edu/faculty/facultyDetail.php?whereField=facultyID&#038;whereValue=323">position at the Brookings</a>.  Note that bit about director of economic policy for the Kerry/Edwards campaign.  Not to keen on the Hamilton Project though:<br />
<blockquote>The offices belong to the Hamilton Project, a small think tank created by Robert E. Rubin, Bill Clinton&#8217;s Treasury secretary and key economic adviser, and former Treasury deputy secretary Roger C. Altman, who would be a front-runner for the same job in a new Clinton administration.</p></blockquote>
<p>Is this the concession the Clinton/Blue Dog group was looking for?  The DLC still keeps control of the money issues?  <a href="http://www.inclusionist.org/node/1413">This article</a> suggests some recent Hamilton Project influencing.Do we really need Chicago School lite?  Are we that timid that we couldn&#8217;t try another school of thought?  Now that would be “change”. </p>
<p>Then I read this in the Common Dreams article:<br />
<blockquote>One economist who has disputed some of Mr. Furman’s findings on Wal-Mart said the disagreement shouldn’t disqualify him. “That’s small potatoes. Jason’s economic agenda goes way beyond that,” Jared Bernstein of the Economic Policy Institute said. “That’s not anything close to a deal breaker.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Well ok?  If the EPI can say there is more to this young man than Walmart, I need to go looking.  I found this from Mr. Furman&#8217;s article on <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/26/AR2007102601860.html">corporate taxes</a>: <br />
<blockquote>“We should consider tax reform in the classic 1986 mode: lower tax rates and broaden the tax base by limiting special exemptions. Both halves of this classic equation have the potential for helping the economy by eliminating the perverse incentives to invest in tax-favored activities rather than in more economically productive activities. “</p></blockquote>
<p>Alrighty, there is more to his thinking.  He relates our <a href="http://www.democracyjournal.org/printfriendly.php?ID=6466">health care problems to the tax code </a>also:<br />
<blockquote>Not only do we spend more than any other country on health care, nearly 50 percent more per capita than the second-highest-spending nation, but citizens in 28 other countries have a higher life expectancy and 33 other nations have lower infant mortality rates.</p>
<p>If this were a government-run health care system, the voting public and policymakers would be up in arms. Yet, perhaps because health care is largely perceived as a private-sector concern, there is relative quiet: while voters tell pollsters that it is a top priority, there appears not to be comparable political pressure for serious reform or any fundamental change in the government’s involvement, either in the provision or funding of health care. This is in part because much of the federal government’s involvement with the health care system is through the hidden backdoor of the tax code. An importantprinciple for modern progressives is that when the government has to intervene in the marketplace, it should not prop up failure. Yet the federal government is, in fact, deeply involved in perpetuating the current &#8220;private&#8221; health care system and all its flaws, spending approximately $200 billion annually in subsidizing employer-provided insurance. It is the single biggest subsidy in our tax system, more than twice as costly as the mortgage interest deduction. The only government programs that cost more are Social Security, national defense, and Medicare.</p></blockquote>
<p>Interesting perspective&#8230;yes?  But, I&#8217;m not so sure he is correct with the solution, though I can now see why Senator Obama has put him at the table:<br />
<blockquote>In fact, if we turned our irrational health tax subsidies right-side up–by curbing subsidies for higher-income workers and those with more generous health insurance plans–we could raise tens of billions of dollars annually, money that could go toward increasing access to health insurance. Taking it a step further, we could scrap the current deduction altogether and replace it with progressive tax credits that, together with other changes, would ensure that every American has affordable health insurance.</p></blockquote>
<p> Not exactly a Mrs. Edward solution if I have read her correctly.  </p>
<p>This person, Mr. Furman seems to fit well with Senator Obama&#8217;s other econ advisor, Mr. Austan Goolsbee.  I think we can now start making some educated guess on what to expect for proposed solutions to the shift of income share to the top 1%.  You know: It&#8217;s the economy stupid, Show me the money, declining real wages, consumer economy with little to spend, (add your&#8217;s here&#8230;).  We&#8217;re going to try a new version of trickle down which has some form of tax code tightening, but no direct social policy influencing.  Social influencing, like say, we use the tax code to make it more profitable for the company to pay the help as oppose to paying the very top management and shareholders.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Mark Duggan and Fiona Scott Morton published <a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w13917">a paper at NBER</a> with this general conclusion:<br />
<blockquote>Using data on product-specific prices and quantities sold in each year in the U.S., our findings indicate that Part D substantially lowered the average price and increased the total utilization of prescription drugs by Medicare recipients. Our results further suggest that the magnitude of these average effects varies across drugs as predicted by economic theory.</p></blockquote>
<p>Even though they were only using one year&#8217;s worth of data—or perhaps because of it—they concluded that the program has been a success for the most common drugs. I posted this list at <a href="http://atbozzo.blogspot.com/2008/04/rush-knows-his-audience.html">MU</a>, but it bears repeating here:<br />
<blockquote>Lipitor, Zocor, Prevacid, Nexium, Zoloft, Epogen, Celebrex, Zyprexa, Neurontin, Procrit, Effexor, Advair, Paxil, Norvasc, Pravachol, Plavix, Allegra, Wellbutrin, Oxycontin, Fosamax, Vioxx, Singulair, Protonix, Actos, Ortho, Aciphex</p></blockquote>
<p>Duggan and Scott Morton also found that—for the &#8220;small subset of &#8216;protected&#8217; therapeutic classes&#8221; that all providers were required to carry—the Part D prices to consumers actually <em>rose</em>. The authors explain this as a standard of economic theory:<br />
<blockquote>According to Part D regulations, there are six “protected” therapeutic classes in which PDPs must be less aggressive with their formularies than in other therapeutic areas. All products in the HIV, anti-cancer, anticonvulsant, immunosuppressant, antipsychotic, and antidepressant categories must be included in all Part D formularies. While a PDP cannot exclude any drug in these categories, it can create financial incentives or administrative hurdles to affect a patient’s choice of drug&#8230;.We do not know whether the restrictions applied to these classes have a measurable impact on the behavior of PDPs because in the first year of the program it was not clear how much CMS would oversee formularies. If restrictions are binding, their effect will be to reduce Part D’s effect on the substitutability among drugs (lower [gamma-sub-g]) and therefore reduce the PDP’s ability to extract manufacturer discounts.</p></blockquote>
<p>English version: without being able to threaten to exclude a drug from coverage, and not being certain about whether they would be permitted to classify a drug as more expensive than a counterpart under their specific plan, the drug companies could not bargain effectively with drug manufacturers.</p>
<p>Which makes perfect sense, until you consider that the price to Medicare recipients of those drugs went <em>up</em>.</p>
<p>Imagine the negotiations.  &#8220;You charge $1,000 for that drug.&#8221;  &#8220;Yes, but for you, $1,005.&#8221;  &#8220;Done.&#8221;</p>
<p>Duggan and Scott Morton do present some caveats<br />
<blockquote>To the extent that plans become more or less successful at negotiating prices in future years, the results may of course change. Secondly, we are unable to measure any <em>ex post</em> rebates which PDPs may have been able to negotiate and which affect net prices to PDPs. Such rebates do not appear on the invoice, which is the source of IMS data, and might be causing prices to be even lower than those measured here. If rebates are present, our estimates are a lower bound to the price reductions achieved by PDPs.</p></blockquote>
<p>Translation: Some PDPs may be making more money than we think at the current levels.<br />
<blockquote>The other rebates that we do not measure are Medicaid rebates paid by manufacturers to the Medicaid program. Dual eligibles’ pharmaceutical purchases under Medicaid automatically generated this rebate. Once dual eligibles move into Medicare Part D plans, their pharmaceutical purchases occur at different prices,  which is what we document here, but they no longer trigger automatic rebates. Any study of the total cost of Part D to the government would want to consider both sets of rebates.</p></blockquote>
<p>Translation: While the PDPs may have earned more, the government may have <em>spent</em> more (rebates not received).</p>
<p>The last two possible results would be similar to those expected by many economists who looked at the form of Part D, where the largest buyer (the Government) was prevented from using its buying power, but obligated to foot the bill for private companies that, individually and probably even collectively, would not be able to negotiate with the same influence.</p>
<p>More worrisome than that this conclusion should be expected is what might be expected to happen if the PDPs were rational.  Again, this would come from standard economic theory, though it is not discussed explicitly by Duggan and Scott Morton.</p>
<p>To be direct about it, the PDPs in Medicare Part D each has a steep learning curve, effectively creating a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switching_costs">switching cost</a> for the consumer.  That, in turn, will enable each PDP to retain its consumer base, <em>even while increasing the prices it charges</em>.</p>
<p>Health Economists especially are fond of talking about the &#8220;full cost&#8221; of something.  If it would take me twenty or thirty hours to select a replacement PDP, the that &#8220;cost&#8221; will keep me from switching, <em>even if I end up paying a few dollars more for a prescriptions</em>.</p>
<p>Contrast this with, say, automobile insurance.  The terms are all similar, and I can spend &#8220;15 minutes&#8221; getting a quote from GEICO (or three or four from Progressive) that I know is essentially the same coverage as my current provider.</p>
<p>I may not know how well the insurer will respond to me, and I may not know if they can provide the other policies I need (home, life, etc.), so there may be minor externalities (e.g., having to write different checks at different times to different insurers for different policies).  But there will be nothing on the order of the <em>switching costs</em> currently associated with Medicare Part D.</p>
<p>Duggan and Scott Morton have done a service in indicating that Part D has gotten more people using more drugs.*  And they have so far shown that economic theory appears to be holding in a real-life situation.</p>
<p>If economic theory continues to hold, we should expect that profit margins will grow over time, in reaction to the high switching costs that are built into the program.</p>
<p>We can hope that will not be so, but Mark Duggan and Fiona Scott Morton have not indicated that would be the way to bet.</p>
<p>*This is also the lesson of the Massachusetts universal health plan, but that&#8217;s for another post, though I note that the differing reactions to the two situations from some of the think tanks is interesting in itself.</p>

                                <p>The other point from my earlier chart on health care spending worth noting is that in the PCE data health care accounts for around 20% of consumer spending.  In contrast, medical care only has a weight of 6.2% in the CPI.  Since health care prices generally rise some two to three percentage points faster then overall inflation this implies that the CPI significantly understates reported inflation.  If the weight of medicine in the CPI were more like the weight in spending, the reported inflation rate would have been up to a full percentage point higher every year.</p>
<p>Interestingly, when I bring this point up to all the people who argue that the CPI overstates inflation they generally try to change the subject.</p>

                                <p>My wife (aka the world&#8217;s greatest nurse) has been an RN for three decades.</p>
<p>One of her annual rituals is to attend recertification class for CPR (because she doesn&#8217;t work ICU or surgery she does not need the advanced cardiac program). She has plenty of experience and often more clinical training than the Red Cross instructor.</p>
<p>This year due to a medical leave, some travel and the holidays her certification will be expired for about six weeks. Not that her skills expire, of course.</p>
<p>One of her co-workers suggested she get re-certified over the Internet for the interim period.</p>
<p>Ok she says, and sent dutiful husband to do the search.</p>
<p>Sure enough, since her certification is current now (or lapsed less than six months) and she has a license she could get  herself re-certified on-line. She thinks it is bizarre.</p>
<p>In the search process I found some scary sites that claim that someone who has never had any first aid or CPR training can train on the Internet and get a certifications sufficient for most OSHA requirements. This is learning first aid and CPR by watching a video on a computer screen.  Gasp.</p>
<p>I have done first aid and CPR training about 25 times in the past 45 years, with numerous refreshers in between while the youngsters are doing First Aid merit badge. I have pumped on the dummy &#8217;til my hands were numb and I was out of breath (and I&#8217;m 1-for1 in real world CPR, the scariest 8 minutes of my life).</p>
<p>Can you learn a hands-on skills on the Internet? Is this a step too far for a novice? Would you want CPR from an Internet student?</p>
<p>My wife goes to the Red Cross and bangs on the dummy in January. She is for real.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>A week ago, my sister, while traveling in Natal, a city in Northeastern Brazil, experienced some heart trouble.  Heart trouble is nothing new for her; she&#8217;s had a defibrillator in her for well over a decade now, and has undergone heart surgery a few times.  Long story short, a taxi driver rushed her to the hospital, and on Tuesday she underwent heart surgery.  Luckily for her, there&#8217;s a new <a href="http://www.hospitaldocoracao.com.br/">heart hospital</a> in Natal, so they knew what they&#8217;re doing.  It also allows her to compare care under specialists in the US (she&#8217;s been through this in LA, Houston, and North Carolina) to her care under specialists in a city most people have never heard of in Northeastern Brazil.</p>
<p>A few interesting facts:</p>
<p>1.  Needless to say, despite the plummeting value of the dollar relative to the Brazilian real, the cost of this surgery and everything related to the hospital stay is much, much cheaper in Brazil.  (Thank goodness &#8211; her insurance company will reimburse her for most of the expenses, but since it was done abroad, she has to pay for it first and submit a bill later.) <br />2.  My sister says that from her perspective, this surgery went more easily than the many surgeries she had in the US.  In plain English, the pain, upon awakening, was much, much less, and she was up and about much more quickly.  Whoever was in charge of sedation and anesthesia did one heck of a job.  (I should also note &#8211; this surgery was something of an emergency &#8211; I believe each time she&#8217;s had surgery in the US, they had time to plan and the surgery was scheduled months in advance.)<br />3.  The pre- and post- op care has been first rate.  My sister uses words like &#8220;fabulous&#8221; and &#8220;incredible&#8221; to describe how she&#8217;s been treated.  She&#8217;s talking about buying a place in Natal and moving there, and I suspect she&#8217;s only half joking.  Maybe less than half.</p>
<p>Health care is more expensive and often of lower quality in the US than in developing countries like Brazil, even when you&#8217;re dealing with exotic problems which is what American care supposedly excels at dealing with.  Someone tell me again about the greatness of the American medical system.</p>

                                <p>Three Kentucky lawyers are sitting in a Kentucky jail on multiple fraud charges in relation to a Fen-phen malpractice suit (a discredited diet drug).</p>
<p>After settlement the lawyers lied to the victims, and told some of the victims that discussing the settlement with anyone else was a criminal act subject to jail terms. Nice thing to do to sick people.</p>
<p>It seems that of a $200 million settlement the lawyers ate up $150 million or so, while lying to the victims about the terms of the settlement. There are allegations that the lawyers created a charity with a paid board seat for the state court trial judge.</p>
<p>This case got lots of publicity not because the victims were slammed but because the lawyers used some of the money to buy a piece of Curlin, a famous race horse from the 2006 season, while victims were still awaiting funds to pay medical bills.</p>
<p>There was a small amount of justice in the case when the lawyers started fightin amount themselves, over the money of course.</p>
<p>The federal district court trial judge will not allow the lawyers to post bail because they have been stonewalling about the whereabouts of some of the money.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve thought for years that civil court settlements over $xx should be subject to a CPA review for proper distribution, and that all class action settlements should be reviewed. I&#8217;ve done this sort of review for a court when a juvenile was an accident victim. If everything is honest the cost isn&#8217;t that high.</p>
<p>This would, of course, drive the trial lawyers into a frenzy. But what about the victims?</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Professors Paul Krugman and Greg Mankiw have stirred up the blogosphere recently with columns on health care. I think both of them are often wrong, as are many economists on many topics, IMHO.</p>
<p>Before I go on let me stipulate:</p>
<p>Both are smarter than I am.<br />Both are better educated than I am.<br />Both have better quantitative skills than I have.<br />Both have more resources than I have.</p>
<p>But both are wrong on healthcare issues.</p>
<p>How dare I challenge these respected giants of economics?</p>
<p>Thirty years of involvement in health care ranging from accounting for a single physician practice to working with national healthcare associations on broad policy issues.  For starters.<br />And you will never see my byline in the NYT on healthcare issues.</p>
<p>In the US there is apparently a strain of thought that only lawyers, journalists and economists are generally qualified to comment as “experts” on  a huge range of topics.</p>
<p>(I’ll rip on lawyers another day.)</p>
<p>Krugman and Mankiw have formidable skills and access to mountains of data. Both are adept at looking at those mountains, looking at the work of other economists and policy wonks, and drawing conclusions.  I grant them their intellectual superiority.</p>
<p>But here is the question:</p>
<p>Can economists really use their skills and resources to be experts on such a wide range of topics?How much credibility should we give them?</p>
<p>Your comments.</p>
