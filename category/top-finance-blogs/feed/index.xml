Its a pretty good list.</p>

<p>His thoughts on what is more mainstream caught my fancy as well. Angry Bear has developed a solid readership since 2003, but economic blogs were anything but mainstream even six/seven years ago, and are common to major media outlets now. September 2008 brought a big jump in readership to most of the econoblog world. But which are closer to mainstream?  And how does that impact what is covered?  Who is the audience today?  Worth pondering. </p>
