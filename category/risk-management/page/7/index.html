                                <p>I&#8217;ve spent most of the past two weeks alternating between dizziness and sleep.  Maybe the dizziness explains why I find myself in agreement with <a target="_blank" href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123578492279598531.html?mod=djemEditorialPage">a WSJ editorial</a>:<br />
<blockquote>In a better world, Citi would have long ago been put into bankruptcy. The FDIC could have taken over and disposed of the bank&#8217;s assets, while protecting insured deposits as it always does. The profitable parts of Citigroup could then have been sold off to people who could better manage them.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let&#8217;s do some elementary math in support of the WSJ position:<br />
<blockquote>Taxpayers have already put more than $50 billion in capital into the bank, while guaranteeing $301 billion of its bad assets, and the bank still can&#8217;t stop its slide.</p></blockquote>
<p>All right, I&#8217;ll work with the low number, which is the most optimistic estimate anyone has published recently: $50 Billion.  The Big C&#8217;s market capitalisation (the Present Value of the Expected Unencumbered Future Cash Flows as expressed as the stock price times the number of shares) as of last night is $8.18 Billion.</p>
<p>Can we stop talking about the evils of &#8220;wiping out the existing shareholders&#8221;?  They were wiped out more than $40 Billion ago.</p>
<p>The WSJ does make one mistake:<br />
<blockquote>But in this vale of taxpayer tears, Citi is &#8220;too big to fail&#8221; and thus must be propped up lest it (allegedly) spread contagion through the financial system. While that may have been true last fall amid the worst of the financial panic, we don&#8217;t think the contagion would be the same now that the federal government has guaranteed anything in the financial system that moves.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, not exactly.  By my count from the <a href="http://www.fdic.gov/bank/individual/failed/banklist.html">FDIC Failed Banks list</a>, 28 banks have been closed since October of 2008, including two yesterday. And there&#8217;s no sign that that trend is ending. But this is spot on:<br />
<blockquote>That isn&#8217;t the view at Treasury, which yesterday agreed to a stock swap that will buy Citi more time to, well, who knows? The feds will trade the preferred taxpayer shares for Citigroup common, which means giving up their 5% dividend and taking on more future risk in return for a 36% ownership stake.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let&#8217;s review below the fold:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Fed has put at least $50 billion into The Big C.*</li>
<li>The Big C is worth, according to its best-informed shareholders, slightly over $8 billion.**</li>
<li>The Fed&#8217;s $50 billion will get it a 36% share in The Big C.</li>
<li>Basic Math Interlude:  $50B=0.36x => x = $50B/0.36 = $138.89B implied value</li>
<li>Pause to repeat: The market thinks The Big C is worth just over $8 Billion. The current &#8220;book value&#8221; of the institution—a mythical number only an accountant could love, and her only because she is paid to love it—is just over $80 Billion.  The <em>Best Case Scenario</em> for the Fed commitment is that The Big C is worth nearly $140 Billion.</li>
<li>Interlude: [search Internet for a picture of The Nile to insert here. Settle for trying to get the <a href="http://www.sadlyno.com/">Sadly, No!</a> guys to photoshop Tim Geithner&#8217;s head onto Pam Tillis&#8217;s body.]</li>
<li>Remind the blogsphere of Simon Johnson&#8217;s <a href="http://baselinescenario.com/2009/02/07/ten-questions-for-secretary-geithner/">answer to Question 8</a>:<br />
<blockquote>8. How many of the largest 5 banks will likely end up with government as majority owner?</p>
<p>&#8211;  Any honest market-based valuation of bank assets will show a majority of large banks are presently insolvent but can be righted with substantial new capital. </p>
<p>&#8211; If the answer isn’t “at least two,” then either the Treasury does not plan to properly value assets, or someone is not yet prepared to tell the full truth.</p></blockquote>
<p></li>
<li>Point out that, if you believe the market, there are two banks that are currently Serious Outliers in Book-to-Market Value, The Big C and BofA.

<p></p>
</li>
<li>Decide not to discuss stress testing, which indicates that Wells Fargo is also seriously endangered, in this post, in large part because of its acquisition of WalkAllOverYa, which had previously acquired <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/02/13/60minutes/main4801309.shtml">World Savings Bank</a>.  Leave for later; tell audience not to hold breath.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, let&#8217;s pretend that past is prologue and that Timmeh! is just making the best deal he can.  (Pause for laughter to subside.)  Let&#8217;s just Focus on the Future.</p>
<p>The Obama Administration is commonly described as planning to ask for $750 Billion in additional &#8220;bailout funds.&#8221;  <a href="http://www.propublica.org/article/obama-admins-budget-guesstimate-for-bailout-oh-around-750-billionish">They are claiming that this should be shown on the budget as $250 Billion</a>, since they expect to get about 2/3s of the funds back over time. [link added, h/t Frank Rich in the NYT]</p>
<p>Given the above details re: The Big C, and the abundant reports with multinational historic examples that shows nowhere near that size of return, why should we be expected to believe them?</p>
<p>With regard to The Big C, I&#8217;ll give the penultimate word, once again, to the WSJ editorialists:<br />
<blockquote>Meanwhile, Treasury is forcing the bank to get some new, and presumably more competent, directors. Many of the current directors were going to leave later this spring anyway, but at least this imposes some discipline in return for the federal largesse. Citi&#8217;s management will stay in place, at least for now.</p>
<p>Again in a better world, the new board and Treasury would find better managers. But yesterday&#8217;s announcement included no roadmap for how the bank plans to restructure, if it even plans to do so. The hope is that it can earn itself back to profitability. More realistically, a bank that has failed as often as Citigroup needs to shrink until it is no longer too big succeed.</p></blockquote>
<p>As followers of the Iraq War know, <a href="http://www.booksamillion.com/product/9780275994457?id=4358528114086">Hope is not a Plan</a>.  When the WSJ endorses nationalisation, it&#8217;s clearly an idea whose time has come.</p>
<p>*We can pretend the asset guarantees—a Really Stupid Idea from people Robert assures me are smart—are independent of the firm; that is, if Goldman or BofA owned them, they would have gotten the same deal.</p>
<p>**I maintain that the current stock price is approximately the price of a two- or three-year call option at a price marginally above the current level—say, $3 or $5—and as such we should rightly view the current stock value as $0.00.  But that&#8217;s for another post.</p>

<p>Since the current Administration is now threatening to continue with the same effort, any cause for optimism is sadly misplaced.</p>

                                <p>A correspondent notes CJR found a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cjr.org/the_audit/good_scoop_by_the_ft.php">good scoop by the FT</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Merrill Lynch paid out about $4 billion in bonuses just days before Bank of America took it over, the Financial Times says this morning.</p>
<p>What raises the eyebrows is the timing: Merrill paid its bonuses before the year was even up, “an unusual step” because bonuses in past years weren’t paid until late January or early February.</p></blockquote>
<p>But, of course, by then, the bonuses would have been under the auspices of Bank of America, since that deal closed 1 January 2009.*</p>
<p>My favorite pull quote combines issues of corporate governance, moral hazard, and risk (mis)management:<br />
<blockquote>The timing is notable because the money was paid as Merrill’s losses were mounting and Ken Lewis, BofA’s chief executive, was seeking additional funds from the government’s troubled asset recovery programme to help close the deal.</p>
<p>Merrill and BofA shareholders voted to approve the takeover on December 5. Three days later, Merrill’s compensation committee approved the bonuses, which were paid on December 29.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve never been a believer in Ken Lewis&#8217;s alleged skills as a banker—his wins have been ones of sewlf-admitted collusion, while his &#8220;free market&#8221; purchases have generally been abject failures, the cost savings more than lost in knowledge failures—and this specific instance looks as if he got played badly.</p>
<p>If BofA paid or is paying retention bonuses as well, Lewis should be terminated with extreme prejudice and the entire BofA board should be removed by the shareholders.** It&#8217;s not as if (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/24/business/24bank.html?hp=&#038;pagewanted=print">it is filled with crack financial wizards.</a>):<br />
<blockquote>[T]he Bank of America board, whose ranks include the mayor of Spartanburg, S.C.; a retired general, Tommy R. Franks; and the former chairman and chief executive of Lowe’s&#8230;.</p></blockquote>
<p>*BofA, memory serving, pays its bonuses in early February—but one somehow suspects that the question would not have been about the timing of the payments.</p>
<p>**I was going to say &#8220;with pitchforks, if necessary,&#8221; but that might be taken as extremism, since we&#8217;re not talking about civilians.</p>

                                <p>There is a reason I never believe people who judge the health of a company by its credit rating: the evidence isn&#8217;t there, and everyone in the market knows it isn&#8217;t there.</p>
<p>Here is a prime example: General Electric (GE; the company that Jack eviscerated) has a AAA credit rating.  It is also paying a 31 cent per share <em>quarterly</em> dividend.</p>
<p>The stock is <a target="blank" href="http://www.marketwatch.com/quotes/ge">trading at $12/share</a> as I type.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a yield of 10.31%, per MarketWatch.</p>
<p>The 30-year Treasury, as I write (presumably the Friday close) is <a target="blank" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/markets/rates/index.html">yielding 3.32%</a>.</p>
<p>Rounding off—I doubt anyone would seriously quibble the basis point—we have an allegedly-AAA company whose <em>stock</em> is trading 7.00% above Treasuries.  At a time when <a target="blank" href="http://bloomberg.com/markets/rates/corpbonds.html">the average &#8220;redemption yield&#8221; for investment-grade bonds is 6.47%</a>.</p>
<p>Now, in sane circumstances, people would be saying, &#8220;Oh, but that&#8217;s because GE will, certainly, cut its dividend.  And investors know that.&#8221;  However, CEO Jeffrey Immelt (the man charged with cleaning up Jack&#8217;s mess, who instead compounded his predecessor&#8217;s actions) assured investors that the dividend will not be cut, <a target="blank" href="http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=fc406610968e45feb7fb93bbec7dce50&#038;siteid=nwtpm&#038;sguid=pOcNmUHx20O0R5GhFlfw6A">even as he noted that GE expects an &#8220;extremely difficult&#8221; 2009</a>.</p>
<p>Moody&#8217;s has GE on credit watch with &#8220;outlook negative,&#8221; but <a target="blank" href="http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/general-electric-sees-more-credit/story.aspx?guid=%7BB65B0C9B-3426-422A-8480-EB752C91AAD8%7D">they&#8217;ve only been there since 13 January 2009</a>.  This is a company that is paying about <a target="blank" href="http://www.marketwatch.com/quotes/ge">15% of its net earnings</a> out in dividends.  Calling GE &#8220;<a target="blank" href="http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=fc406610968e45feb7fb93bbec7dce50&#038;siteid=nwtpm&#038;sguid=pOcNmUHx20O0R5GhFlfw6A">not a growth stock</a>&#8221; is like calling Sears anything other than a real-estate play: so bloody obvious that it shouldn&#8217;t need to be said.</p>
<p>Yet, for some reason, it needed to be said.  And Moody&#8217;s is hanging there, ten days into &#8220;outlook negative&#8221; while the bleeding stock market is screaming &#8220;junk bond yield&#8221; on the equity.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong; GE is probably still investment grade.  Their <s>store credit card business</s> <s>ownership of NBC and affiliates</s> <s>consumer products division</s> defense contracts alone should keep them there.  But that&#8217;s what we said about GM too.</p>
<p>GM stock, which is <a target="blank" href="http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=fc406610968e45feb7fb93bbec7dce50&#038;siteid=nwtpm&#038;sguid=pOcNmUHx20O0R5GhFlfw6A">the downside risk cited by MarketWatch</a>, is currently yielding 28.5%.  If General Electric (GE) were yielding that level with the current dividend, it would be priced around $4.35—about another 64% decline.  [<i>As noted in the comments, GM has suspended its dividend and actually yields nothing; the MarketWatch site for some reason reports the yield based on the suspended dividend anyway.  -ATB</i>] </p>

<p>Brad DeLong boldly attempts to exhaustively list the factors which can affect the value of a fixed income asset.   This is some Mac generated i document and I can&#8217;t cut and paste. Go <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2009/01/delong-what-has-happened-to-milton-friedmans-chicago-school-draft.html#comments">here</a> and search for &#8220;there are four&#8221;. </p>
<p>The four are called &#8220;default&#8221;, &#8220;the safe real interest rate&#8221;, &#8220;risk&#8221;, and adverse selection.</p>
<p>I view the assertion that &#8220;there are four&#8221; as a challenge and quibble after the jump.</p>
<p>First the instruments in question promise nominal payments so the safe interest rate in question is the safe nominal interest rate not the safe real interest rate.  The word &#8220;real&#8221; is essentially a typo.</p>
<p>Second &#8220;default&#8221; and &#8220;risk&#8221; are the same things for fixed income instruments (clearly what Brad is discussing).  By &#8220;risk&#8221; I assume he means &#8220;risk bearing capacity&#8221; or &#8220;risk aversion&#8221;.  However, default is a much broader problem than Brad seems willing to admit.  He counts exactly two sources of default risk &#8212; 1 trillion in housing related defaults and 3 more trillion from defaults caused by the recession.  This leaves out other sources of changes in estimated default risk (not risk aversion or risk bearing caspacity but risk).</p>
<p>That is, I see a fifth cause of the decline in asset values.  I think many assets were over-valued in the past, because the ratings agencies were tricked or cashing in on their late lamented excellent reputations (or both).  The loss of confidence in said agencies causes an increase in estimated risk not because risk has increased or risk aversion has increased but because the old estimates are now known to be bogus.</p>
<p>More generally, risk modeling by traders was similarly complete nonsense.  I don&#8217;t know to what extent the traders were tricked and to what extent they were in on the scam (nor I suspect do they).  </p>
<p>Structured finance created a huge illusion of wealth by creating an illusion of safety.  The financial engineers knew how the agencies rated (the agencies explained for a consulting fee) and how traders estimate &#8220;value at risk&#8221;.  They knew people assumed (or pretended to assume) that all stochastic variables are normally distributed.  Thus it was profitable to sell instruments with skewed returns (fat lower tails) unless the rare negative event occurred during the testing period (in which case the instruments could be re-engineered).  A senior tranche of a pool of moderately risky assets has a skewed distribution. </p>
<p>Similarly money could be made by reducing own variance for a given beta by pooling assets and issuing claims on the pool.  The variance of an average is less than the average variance.  The covariance of an average and the market portfolio is the average covariance.  <a href="http://theamericanscene.com/2008/12/23/ahi-quanto-a-dir-qual-era-e-cosa-dura-esta-selva-selvaggia-e-aspra-e-forte-che-nel-pensier-rinova-la-paura">Thus a claim on a pool of BBB rated corporate bonds was rated AAA</a>.  Turning BBB to AAA is worth a lot of money except for the fact that it was a scam (investors could pool themselves &#8212; they don&#8217;t seem to have understood that pre-pooling reduces the benefit to them of their own pooling &#8212; or they were in on the scam).</p>
<p>That is there were trillions of fantasy dollars created out of nothing by financial engineering (on top of whatever real wealth had been created by financial engineering which genuinely made better insurance and diversification possible).  The loss of that illusion can&#8217;t be estimated easily as  &#8220;housing related defaults&#8221; (and note my example has nothing to do with housing or recessions).  </p>
<p>The risk of a nationwide decline in house prices was estimated at 0 by S&#038;P (I am not exaggerating).  Now there has been such a decline, and they must admit that there is the risk of another such decline in the future.  Even if the current decline costs just $ 1 trillion, the future possible declines also cost money.</p>
<p>So much of the wealth was an illusion which won&#8217;t come back soon.  This end of systematic miss-estimation of risk is not on your list.</p>
<p>Also institutions took huge gigantic bets against each other (as in AIG lost writing CDSs).  This increases counter party risk.  No one knows if a counter party is solvent.  That reduces the value of a huge number of instruments.  The damage could have been done without involving the housing industry or the stock market if, say, investment bank CEOs played a really high stakes poker game and all claimed to have won money.  Also bankruptcy is costly.  Even if the CEOs had played hundred billion ante poker on camera, wealth would have been destroyed and more wealth would have been shifted from investors to lawyers.  This is another item not on your list.</p>
<p>Finally, much of the strange new finance was designed to help agents avoid prudential rules and regulations which they considered to be costly.  Now they have learned two things.  First that the regulations weren&#8217;t so pointless so they will have to pay that cost to avoid bankruptcy.  Second they will be audited by banking regulators, trustees etc and found wanting.   This last point is semi redundant as it amounts to an increase in perceived risk or a reduction in perceived capacity to bear risk (default or risk in Brad&#8217;s terms).  However, it explains why I keep speculating that this that or the other operator was in on the scam.</p>

                                <p>Robert Waldmann </p>
<p>ended my last post 5 minutes ago wishing for part III of the saga and here it is !<br /><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/12/30/AR2008123003431.html?hpid=topnews">The final act for AIG by  Robert O&#8217;Harrow Jr. and Brady Dennis</a></p>
<p>The collapse was, of course, quick when it came.  One interesting fact is that AIG Financial Products (AIGFP) stopped writing new CDSs in 2005.  Another is that, until then, they had little idea what they were doing.</p>
<blockquote><p>In fall 2005, Eugene Park was asked to take over Alan Frost&#8217;s responsibilities at Financial Products. Frost had done exceedingly well in marketing the credit-default swaps to Wall Street, and was getting a promotion. He would now report to Cassano directly on other strategic projects.</p>
<p>Park &#8230;was worried about the subprime component of the CDO market. He had examined the annual report of a company involved in the subprime business. He was stunned, he told his colleagues at the time.</p></blockquote>
<p>What a fascinating new idea &#8212; how about examining the annual report of a firm whose securities one insures.  I mean not all of them (what a bore) but just one.  </p>
<p>From this passage it seems that AIGFP just assumed that mortgages were what they had been in the past.  I mean it&#8217;s not their problem.  The non bank mortgage lenders were loaning all they could, because they figured they could pass on the risk (well sometimes risk sometimes certainty of default) to people making CDOs who could pass it on to people buying CDOs who could pass it on to AIGFP which doesn&#8217;t seem to have wondered what they were insuring.</p>
<p>I give you a hint.  If you tell the world that you are glad to bear all of some vaguely defined kind of risk, then it will get riskier.</p>
<p>AIG was a major factor in the market: </p>
<blockquote><p>Financial Products had $2.7 trillion worth of swap contracts and positions; 50,000 outstanding trades; 2,000 firms involved on the other side of those trades; and 450 employees in six offices around the world.</p></blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s $ 6 billion in exposure per employee!</p>
<p>Obviously AIGFP had decided that to write CDSs on AAA rated securities was to get money for nothing.  They couldn&#8217;t possibly examine the securities they were insuring.  Notice how Frost&#8217;s role was described: &#8220;Frost had done exceedingly well in marketing the credit-default swaps to Wall Street.&#8221;  You can do very well at selling something if you are charging too low a price.</p>
<p>I guess they can blame the credit rating agencies.  In fact they do, but not for rating toxic sludge AAA but for rating them AA.  The final words &#8220;There was no system in place to account for the fact that the company might not be a Triple A forever.&#8221;</p>
<p>In fact AIG hasn&#8217;t paid out on CDSs, they ran $150 billion short of ready cash, because they had to post collateral: &#8216;If additional downgrades occurred, either in AIG&#8217;s credit rating or in the CDO ratings, Financial Products would have to come up with tens of billions of dollars in collateral it did not have.&#8217;</p>
<p>AIG was downgraded from AAA to AA when Eliot &#8220;socks on&#8221; Spitzer caught him cooking the books.  </p>
<blockquote><p>On March 14, 2005, Greenberg stepped down amid allegations about his involvement in a questionable deal and accounting practices at AIG. The next day, the Fitch Ratings service downgraded AIG&#8217;s credit rating to AA. The two other major rating services, Moody&#8217;s and Standard &#038; Poor&#8217;s, soon followed suit.</p></blockquote>
<p>I guess that explains why he didn&#8217;t go after anyone with a pitchfork.</p>
<p>Back to my usual anti CDS rant after the jump.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d say that was crazy.  Given AIGs exposure they shouldn&#8217;t have been rated AA.  I ask for the nth time, what is the point of a CDS ?  Why can&#8217;t AIG issue AIG bonds and use the proceeds to buy assets rather than insuring them ?  I think it is clear. If AIG had issued 3 trillion in debt they wouldn&#8217;t be rated AA.   CDSs written appear on the balance sheet at market value.  This is nonsense.  In the long run, the two actions (write a CDS on assets or sell debt and buy those assets) have the same impact on AIG&#8217;s book equity, in the short run the only difference is that AIG can be forced to post collateral (which can be seized in full even if it is in chapter 11 and mere bond-holders have to wait and get cents on the dollar) if it writes CDSs.  </p>
<p>I think that it is strictly better for bondholders if AIG issues debt and buys assets than if it insures those assets (I am considering the premia paid on CDSs).  I think the only reason to do it with CDSs is to trick regulators and ratings agencies about AIGs liabilities. </p>
<p>On a basically different topic, I cut some boring stuff out of one of my posts and put it here.</p>
<p>Now I think it is fairly likely that, if they they had stuck to CDSs on corporate bonds, AIGFP would have done very well just as they would have done issuing AAA bonds of their own and buying AA bonds.</p>
<p>My guess is that, at first, the money was there to be made because of excessively prudent rules and regulations.  It is also there, because prudential regulations do not consider covariances so a diversified pool of AAA bonds is treated as if it is as risky as one AAA bond.  This is necessary as there was no covariance rating agency which was worthy of the trust earned by the credit rating agencies.  Thus the only variable which was independently estimated with some reliability (back then in 1998) was the risk of default of a single instrument.  </p>
<p>My current view is that this would be a reasonable approach to prudential regulation if there weren&#8217;t firms like AIG financial products.  The entities subject to the rules and regulations are large enough that they can diversify their portfolio at a very modest cost.  They don&#8217;t bear risk for the fun of it.  It is safe to assume that they will diversify without being specifically required to do so &#8230; unless there is a financial engineering industry which sets up special purpose entities with diversified portfolios and issues single securities whose ratings are high because of that diversification.  This means that the diversification (by the SPE) suddenly relaxes the prudential requirement.  </p>
<p>By pre-diversifying the financial engineers reduce the further reduction in risk available from diversification.  The limiting case would be reached if all securities were put in a huge pool which was cut into tranches.  At that point, the risk of default on any portfolio of, say all existing AA securities would be as high as the risk of default on a single security, because there would only be one AA security.  Thus for the same prudential regulations, banks would be allowed to bear much more risk.  </p>
<p>This is not socially useful.  If prudential regulations are optimally adjusted to take into account the increased correlation of different assets, then nothing is accomplished.  Otherwise the regulations are effectively changed by agents who can pocket the expected value of future public bailouts.  </p>

<p>The second of three parts of Dennis and O&#8217;Harrow&#8217;s series on the downfall of AIG introduces two new features—credit default saps and Joseph Cassano.  Together the two managed to bring down AIG.</p>
<p>Thus far we have only read about how AIG got into the business of writing CDSs &#8212; it seemed too good to be true &#8212; money for nothing.  My guess is that the first ones they wrote did amount to money for almost nothing.  However such opportunities are few and if one considers one year&#8217;s money for nothing as the minimum acceptable profits for next year you will end up getting money for a while for destroying the world&#8217;s largest insurance company.</p>
<p>To me the interesting part is how they got into the CDS market</p>
<blockquote><p>in early 1998: &#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230; a new kind of contract known as a credit-default swap. For a fee, the firm essentially would insure a company&#8217;s corporate debt in case of default. The model showed that these swaps could be a moneymaker for the decade-old firm and its parent, insurance giant AIG, with a 99.85 percent chance of never having to pay out.</p>
<p>The computer model was based on years of historical data about the ups and downs of corporate debt, essentially the bonds that corporations sell to finance their operations.</p></blockquote>
<p>My guess is that the model was right and that returns on writing (less than 10 year) CDSs on corporate debt were huge while the risk was nothing that AIG couldn&#8217;t handle.  This profit opportunity could exist because of binding prudential regulations &#8212; banks worried about capital requirements and managers of endowments and pension funds with rules requiring much of their assets to be AAA corporate debt or safer would be willing to pay much more than the actuarially fair premium for a CDS on, say,  AA debt.   Given the correlation of default on different AA bonds, writing CDS on a broad array of them is essentially money for nothing. The most likely value for payouts is zero and the expected value plus, say, 10 standard deviations would be less than the fees.</p>
<p>I have bolded the two factors which convince me that the model might have been reasonable when it was written.  First this was corporate debt not new financial products so the ratings were based on decades of experience and not on, say, the assumption that the probability of a nationwide average house price decline is zero (an actual assumption made by Standard and Poor&#8217;s really).  Second, I sure hope the &#8220;years&#8221; also amounted to decades including recessions and such.  The use of sample frequencies to estimate probabilities is always risky, but if the sample size is a few years during an unprecedented house price boom, it is insane.  </p>
<p>The problem is that once one has gotten money for nothing it is very hard to convince oneself that there is no more to be had.  </p>
<p>The aim of this article seems to be to describe Hubris* &#8212; the pride that came before a fall.  This is an old theme in drama &#8212; the oldest.  I always read about it when I read stories of financial collapses.  I suspect that it might be added, because it makes a morality play out of math.  I suppose it might often be relevant because of human nature.  However, I also think it is particularly relevant to finance.</p>
<p>The efficient markets hypothesis (adjusted for inflation) says you don&#8217;t find hundred dollar bills on the sidewalk.  It is false.  However, you don&#8217;t find a hundred dollar bill on the same concrete square day after day.  It is possible for financial operators to find an anomaly and make a huge profit with moderate risk.  At best they can find two or three.  There don&#8217;t seem to be many of those who don&#8217;t conclude that they are geniuses who can find such profit opportunities year after year.  A shining exception is <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2008/oct/18/banking-useconomy">Andrew Lahde</a> who made a killing and cashed in.  However, he isn&#8217;t in the business anymore.  </p>
<p>I don&#8217;t see a solution to this problem.  You have to put up either with people who think they are geniuses, because they have been very successful or who have something to prove.  In particular, I think the replacement of Tom Savage by Joseph Cassano may have been very costly for AIG (Savage really retired according to all accounts).  The huge profits made by Savage and Sosin (his predecessor) set a standard which Cassano was determined to surpass. It is very unwise to employ someone who considers finding hundred dollar bills on the sidewalk to be barely adequate.</p>
<p>It is also interesting that Cassano is not a quant: </p>
<blockquote><p>A Brooklyn College graduate, the 42-year-old Cassano was not one of the &#8220;quants&#8221; who had mastered the quantitative analysis and risk assessment on which the firm had been built. He had no expertise in the art of hedging. But he had excelled in the world of accounting and credit &#8212; the &#8220;back office,&#8221; as it is known on Wall Street.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now quants are clearly dangerous, but at least they know the silly assumptions they made when writing their models.  In particular they must understand the fact that quantitative models require parameter estimates which are definitely not reliable unless based on large amounts of data.  I don&#8217;t think someone who is good in the back office understands that estimates based on small samples are not just less precise but also have distributions which can&#8217;t be determined at all based on available data.</p>
<p>Anyway, the third article in the series should be bloody.</p>

                                <p>Robert Waldmann</p>
<p>Over at the Washington Post, Robert O&#8217;Harrow Jr. and Brady Dennis have a fairly interesting first of 3 articles on what went wrong at AIG.  Of course, they tend to stress personalities and personal conflicts, but they do slip in some good points about economics.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d say the key bit was that AIG made a deal and only later noticed that they had made a suboptimal choice of incentive structures.</p>
<blockquote><p>Under the joint-venture agreement, Financial Products received its profits upfront, even if the transactions took 30 years to play out. AIG would be on the hook if something went wrong down the road, not Sosin and his team, who took their pay immediately. </p></blockquote>
<p>Could that cause problems ?  Naaahh no way efficient markets imply that short term profits are just like long term profits (impossible).</p>
<p>The rest of my thoughts on the first third of the long sad story comes after the jump.</p>
<blockquote><p>Greenberg was proud and protective of his company&#8217;s AAA credit rating, one of only a handful in the world.</p>
<p>The AAA, awarded after an examination by the bond-rating firms, sent a resounding signal to clients that they could always sleep well at night, that AIG was in no danger of failing. The more secure a company, the more cheaply it could borrow money &#8212; a fact that would be pivotal to Financial Products&#8217; success.  </p></blockquote>
<p>This is, I think, a large part of the problem right there.  An AAA rating is very valuable and any firm well into AAA territory has unused credibility which can be sold by borrowing at AAA rates and buying risky assets.  The rating was just worth too much to leave sitting there, so it was destroyed.</p>
<blockquote><p>Sosin and Rackson hoped that everyone would get rich, but they had their sights set on something more. They wanted to tear down walls they saw as impediments to innovation, the &#8220;fiefdoms&#8221; that were standard practice at other Wall Street firms. Their vision required a collaborative culture and a computer system that no one else had. For six months, the group worked on constructing &#8220;the position analysis and storage system,&#8221; or PASS. They called it simply &#8220;the system.&#8221;</p>
<p>It enabled Financial Products to bring a rare discipline to complex trades. By maintaining market, accounting and transaction details in one place, Sosin (Howard Sosin founder of &#8220;Financial products&#8221;which was a joint venture with AIG and eventually brought the firm down) and his people could track the constantly changing value of a trade&#8217;s components in a way no other firm could. </p></blockquote>
<p>The advantages of this approach are clear &#8212; only by keeping track of such data in one place can a firm estimate the risk of its portfolio.  The (by then long obsolete) very old approach effectively valued assets based on their own risk not their firm portfolio betal.  However, the disadvantage should also be clear.  An accounting &#8220;Fiefdom&#8221; mgiht also be called keeping the accountants independent from the traders.  The unification elminates oversight.  I can see how a trader might trust himself to manage risk too and consider separate departments a waste of resources.  I can also see how Greenberg might agree as explained by O&#8217;Hara and Denis&#8217;s version of the negotiations with Sosin on the joint venture (their quotation marks)</p>
<blockquote><p>Greenberg had little extra time for the nuts-and-bolts details that Sosin sought to negotiate. &#8220;I don&#8217;t really know much about this,&#8221; he told Matthews. &#8220;You go talk to these people.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Greenberg did notice that he had a problem</p>
<blockquote><p>Greenberg&#8217;s love of his joint venture&#8217;s revenue could not overcome his desire for greater control. He chafed at the deal, worrying that he had given Sosin too much freedom.</p>
<p>One detail in particular nagged at Greenberg. Under the joint-venture agreement, Financial Products received its profits upfront, even if the transactions took 30 years to play out. AIG would be on the hook if something went wrong down the road, not Sosin and his team, who took their pay immediately. </p></blockquote>
<p>Ooops.   This is just dumb dumb dumb.  If the managers of &#8220;Financial Products&#8221; understand that the gap in the market which they discovered and monopolized is now full of competitors *and* see a bubble coming, the sharp thing to do is to ride the bubble getting short term profits safely in the bank.  Paying based Mark to market profits is little better than paying on and mark to model (made up) profits.  I think this mistake requires the influence of market fundamentalists who assume that there can&#8217;t possibly be bubbles.  </p>
<p>The full argument is that bubbles are against investors rational self interest, and if asset prices are largely determined by delegated managers like Sosin, then contracts must have been written to align their interests with, in this case, AIGs shareholders so there is no need to worry that incentive contract encourage money managers to buy into bubbles because bubbles can&#8217;t exists because &#8230; Ah yes the argument is clearly circular nonsense.  </p>
<p>So Greenberg broke with Sosin (who stopped being a genius when he didn&#8217;t have access to an AAA rating) and solved the problem by handling financial products (minus a 150 million golden parachute also). </p>
<blockquote><p>Savage, a 44-year-old Midwestern math whiz, had just been named the new president of Financial Products. With the honor came explicit expectations, which Greenberg made clear: &#8220;You guys up at FP ever do anything to my Triple A rating, and I&#8217;m coming after you with a pitchfork.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>My advice ?  Buy pitchfork futures.  </p>
<p>&#8220;With a PhD from Claremont Graduate University in California, Savage&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>Greenberg also wanted to change the way Financial Products&#8217; employees divvied up its share of the profits. Under the previous arrangement, Sosin and his crew had the right to book immediate profits on the long-term deals. Greenberg thought there was a powerful incentive to go after millions of dollars in short-term gains while leaving AIG and its shareholders responsible for potential losses for years to come.</p>
<p>Savage agreed with Greenberg that Financial Products employees should defer half of their compensation for several years, depending on the length of the deals being done </p></blockquote>
<p>Problem solved. Instant access to merely 15% of booked profits on megadeals couldn&#8217;t distort anyone&#8217;s incentives.  I mean half of a gigantic conflict of interests is still a gigantic conflict of interests.  </p>
<blockquote><p>Savage said. &#8220;Hank Greenberg&#8217;s a great man. And I&#8217;m willing, when I talk to him, to say, you know, I&#8217;m in the presence of a great man and that&#8217;s worth something.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t want to know how much dealing with such a great financial genius was worth to Savage.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&#038;sid=aKr.oY2YKc2g">Bloomberg</a> now suing in court under the Freedom of Information Act for aggregate information concerning types of collateral being  used for collateral with the $1.5 trillion authorized by Congress.  The books from Treasury are being kept by the Fed, so regular rules of FOIA are in a deeply grey area.</p>
<p>Does the President have any control over disclosure rules??</p>
<p>[Update from Ken:  Am I the only one who thinks that if Tim Geithner goes along with the Administration&#8217;s &#8220;no aggregates&#8221; postion,* combined with <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2008/11/culture-of-risk.html">his hiring of Michael Alix to help supervise banks</a>, it would disqualify him from being a reasonable candidate for Treasury Secretary?]</p>
<p>Update:  used for collateral replaces bought in second paragraph</p>
<p>Update II: clarification of what Geithner should not be advocating, as noted by Walker in comments.</p>
