                                <p>You can&#8217;t make him think—or own to loan.  Krugman <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/27/opinion/27krugman.html?partner=rssnyt&#038;emc=rss&#038;pagewanted=print">notes</a>:<br />
<blockquote>[L]ast week <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/25/business/25nocera.html?hp=&#038;pagewanted=print">Joe Nocera of The Times</a> pointed out a key weakness in the U.S. Treasury’s bank rescue plan: it contains no safeguards against the possibility that banks will simply sit on the money. “Unlike the British government, which is mandating lending requirements in return for capital injections, our government seems afraid to do anything except plead.” And sure enough, the banks seem to be hoarding the cash&#8230;.</p>
<p>Events have forced Mr. Paulson into a partial nationalization of the financial system — but he refuses to use the power that comes with ownership. [link added]</p></blockquote>
<p>So that $700 billion was the kleptocratic c.f. Main Street suspected it was, and which Wall Street has known at least since <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2008/09/mussolini-style-corporatism-in-action.html">Ms. Smith Listened in on Washington</a>.</p>
<p>And that just means it will be longer, and worse.  But Jamie Dimon will be richer at the end, so all is well in Paulsonland.</p>
<p>UPDATE: Peter Dorman at <a href="http://econospeak.blogspot.com/">Econospeak</a> was <a href="http://econospeak.blogspot.com/2008/10/bailing-out-banks-but-not-economy.html">all over the Nocera piece</a> the day before I saw it.  And his reading, naturally, is classier than mine:<br />
<blockquote>You can lead a bank to liquidity but you can’t make it loan.</p></blockquote>
<p>but the description is pretty much the same:<br />
<blockquote>It makes it crystal clear that Paulson has a plan for his friends in the financial world, but there is no plan for the economy.</p></blockquote>
<p>The United States can&#8217;t wait for noon on January 20, 2009.</p>

                                <p>The leadership at Wells Fargo must be royally peeved <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/21/business/21plan.html?_r=1&#038;hp=&#038;oref=slogin&#038;pagewanted=print">at this point</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Stable national players like Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, and Wells Fargo are already digesting acquisitions. A second group of so-called super-regional banks are well positioned to take over their competitors, officials said, but have been reluctant to undertake or unable to complete deals.</p>
<p>By offering capital at a favorable rate, the government may encourage them to expand. In this category, industry analysts point to regional leaders, like KeyCorp of Cleveland; Fifth Third Bancorp of Cincinnati; BB&#038;T of Winston-Salem, N.C.; and SunTrust Banks of Atlanta.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now, to be polite about it, one of those last four is (imnvho) a strong contender for Worst-Run U.S. Bank <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/10/20/sports/Sports-Economy-Naming-Rights.php">That Didn&#8217;t Pay $400MM for Naming Rights</a> (h/t <a href="http://thesportseconomist.com/">Skip Sauer</a>).  Ignoring that, a quick glance at the list shows at least two—BB&#038;T and most especially SunTrust—that would have made Wells Fargo a very happy camper in its Southern Strategy effort.</p>
<p>So now, having spent the money, beating Citi and saving the FDIC, Wells is going to have to watch as SunTrust eats its lunch before it has even sat down for appetizers.</p>
<p>This is a bad move by the Fed that will result in no new lending, a lot of window-dressing, and bigger bank failures during the second term of the &#8220;failed Obama administration.&#8221;  (Video of Dave Barry appearance at the National Press Club, 12 November 1992, does not seem to be available on the Internet.  C-Span??  C-SPAN???)</p>
<p>If anyone wants to understand &#8220;moral hazard,&#8221; just imagine being a WFC shareholder* who watched your bank do due diligence and is about to watch SunTrust snap up some weak-kneed competitor by filling out a two-page form and sending it to Hank Paulson.</p>
<p>Anyone who says that Paulson (1) knows what he is doing, (2) does not use the word &#8220;kleptocracy&#8221; in describing Paulson&#8217;s actions, and (3) thinks it is a Good Idea is lying or selling something.</p>

                                <p>Alea <a href="http://www.aleablog.com/taf-undersubscribed/">notes</a> TAF results:<br />
<blockquote>Total propositions submitted: $138.092 billion<br />Total propositions accepted: $138.092 billion<br />Bid/cover ratio: 0.92</p>
<p>Number of bidders: 71</p></blockquote>
<p>The auction in question was supposed to be <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/tafschedule.htm">a $150B, 85-day auction to get firms through year-end</a>.  (For contrast, the last 84-day [12 week] auction h<a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20080909a.htm">ad a bid-to-cover of 1.27</a>.)</p>
<p>Clearly, all the firms that are using the TAF have no capital impediments through the end of the year.  The crisis is over!</p>
<p>So why is the government in the Commercial Paper business?</p>

                                <p>UPDATE:  Brad DeLong notes that <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/10/good-luck-neel.html">there is no requirement, under the bailout bill, for halfway measures and delays</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Every other country that is in this business is nationalizing the banks and injecting capital into them. Only the United States is operating on the asset side along. It&#8217;s unlikely to work, and Neel is now responsible.</p>
<p>Time to shift the focus of the TARP: it shouldn&#8217;t be buying up assets, it should be injecting capital and taking equity instead&#8211;which it can do, the way that Dodd and Frank have written it. But it probably won&#8217;t do until Paulson is replaced.</p></blockquote>
<p>The rest of this post can now be read as an explanation of why that last sentence is true.</p>
<p>The book <a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/cnnm/081006/100608_treasury_hiring_guidelines.html">is being written</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Appoint a crony you brought with you to Treasury to run the program. Refer to him as &#8220;a former executive&#8221; in the press release because it sounds More Authoritative*:<br />
<blockquote>[Neel] Kashkari, a former executive at Goldman Sachs, is the assistant Treasury secretary for International Economics and Development. He joined Treasury in July 2006 and worked on several of Treasury&#8217;s initiatives in response to the housing crisis &#8211; including the formation of the mortgage industry alliance Hope Now.</p></blockquote>
<p></li>
<li>Admit that you&#8217;re going to be picking your friends for all the other jobs as well, while trying to make it sound as if it were a virtue forced upon you, not something for which you have been preparing** for months:<br />
<blockquote>The Treasury on Monday also released its guidelines for how it would hire firms to manage asset purchases.</p>
<p>It cited the need to begin the program urgently. Asset managers and other private-sector agents involved in running it may be hired &#8220;through other than full and open competition,&#8221; the Treasury said in a statement.</p>
<p>The department will post help wanted notices on its Web site and applicants will be reviewed in a two-stage process after they&#8217;ve expressed interest.</p></blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Stage 1: Do I owe him a favor, or will he owe me one?  If not, no.</p>
<p>Stage 2: Will he find me a job on 21 January 2009? If not, no.</p>
<p>Further chapters as the details expand.</p>
<p>*He was a VP at Goldman, which is technically &#8220;executive-level,&#8221; but not exactly close to C-level.</p>
<p>**I was going to say &#8220;should have been preparing,&#8221; since the recession is now four quarters old, until I realised that Paulson has been preparing—for the coming kleptocracy.</p>

                                <p>A detail of tax law makes all the difference in <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/10/wachovia-citigroup-wells-fargo.html">Stormy&#8217;s post below</a>.  Buy the whole thing, get the tax break.  Buy part of it, you don&#8217;t.*</p>
<p>The other half of the answer is that &#8220;timing is everything.&#8221;  And playing Chicken with the FDIC often has Unintended Consequences.**  So let&#8217;s turn the continuous-not-discrete timeline details over to reader A C Shareholder <a href="http://www.haloscan.com/comments/angrybear/2658912203484449642/#723255">in comments to Stormy</a> (minor edits for style):<br />
<blockquote>While obviously I am biased because Wachovia stole 20% of my equity value on Friday, I do think it&#8217;s always fun to watch the Monday morning quarterbacks talk about Wells Fargo as if they only needed a little more time.</p>
<p>When you are dealing with a bank run, you do not have a &#8220;couple of days.&#8221; The &#8220;couple of days&#8221; was the FDIC trying to get Wachovia and Wells Fargo together starting on the Thursday before last weekend and then Wells bailing around Saturday night, Sunday morning. Wells Fargo played chicken with the FDIC by walking away. Do not believe for a minute that walking away from the table wasn&#8217;t a a calculated move designed to put Wachovia in receivership a la WaMu. The only problem was Wells didn&#8217;t foresee Citi putting a deal together that quickly.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s try to construct what would have happened last weekend if Citi doesn&#8217;t step in. Wells leaves Wachovia at the altar Sunday night. Not a great sign of confidence for Wachovia. Market and business opens on Monday. Everyone had been anticipating a deal over the weekend—without one, CFOs and Treasurers get antsy. Noon, the House votes down the bailout package. Immediately, wire and ACH transactions begin hammering Wachovia. Suppose they get through the day, overnight banks refuse to lend to Wachovia. Wachovia&#8217;s funding dries up (look at LIBOR and the TED spread). Tuesday, money continues to pour out of Wachovia. After a brief pop, the market is hearing more about Wachovia precarious position and starts trending lower. Without funding sources, Wachovia is at the Fed window for all monies. Tuesday overnight, still Wachovia cannot borrow from its peers—deposit base is down 15 &#8211; 20 billion. Wednesday, FDIC seeing that the market has lost confidence in Wachovia steps in and puts Wachovia into receivership.</p>
<p>As for the FDIC&#8217;s ability to get anymore deals done, it doesn&#8217;t absolutely stop them. However, now all deals will be receivership deals like WaMu. Wells, Chase, and BofA are all just under or over the 10% deposit base limit so none of them have the ability to merge anymore. The only bank with the ability to merge balance sheets is Citi. As for the others (US Bancorp, PNC, and BB&#038;T), they may be able to do something but they have much smaller asset base in which to spread out losses. If you are VikrAm Pandit, are you going to do another OPEN transaction again with the FDIC or are you going to have the FDIC put &#8217;em in a body baG and wipe out all debt and equity holders? Every regional bank shareholder that goes to receivership from here on out can thank Wells and Wachovia when there debt and equity gets wiped out.</p>
<p>So in return for my use of capital and stock last week that came in at the 11th hour and saved Wachovia and then floated them for an entire week of the worst funding environment in decades perhaps ever &#8211; I get a 20% loss as the CEO of Wachovia was smiling and grinning as late as Thursday. This knife in my back belongs to Wachovia&#8217;s CEO Steele.</p></blockquote>
<p>*This is nothing Citigroup wouldn&#8217;t have known.  The next step in the process is to realize that C valued the non-banking operations of &#8220;WalkAllOverYa&#8221; at less than the net value of the tax break. The implications of that are left to the reader. <strong>UPDATE</strong>: This is not necessarily so—see <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/10/cynics-version-of-wells-fargo-fdic.html">my follow-up post</a>—they valued the net value of the non-banking operations as less than the <em>Expected</em> tax break&#8217;s value, which was even lower than the value Wells is using.</p>
<p>**In this case, we have to assume the consequences really were Unintended, since assuming that Citigroup would buy the banking operations if Wells walked away would—<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/06/business/06bank.html?_r=1&#038;hp=&#038;adxnnl=1&#038;oref=slogin&#038;adxnnlx=1223233531-aAjjfhul2cUz94p8RVsBcg&#038;pagewanted=print">as has become the case</a>—make the acquisition more difficult for Wells. Which is as it should be.</p>

                                <p>Stormy</p>
<p>Let the Rich Bail Them Out. So says <a href="http://www.sanders.senate.gov/news/record.cfm?id=303980">Bernie Sanders</a>, now the Independent, junior senator from Vermont, formerly the &#8220;longest serving independent member of Congress in American history&#8221;&#8211; sixteen years.</p>
<p>Bernie makes some <a href="http://www.sanders.senate.gov/news/record.cfm?id=303980">cogent points</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
<p>This bill does not effectively address the issue of what the taxpayers of our country will actually own after they invest hundreds of billions of dollars in toxic assets. </p>
<p>This bill does not effectively address the issue of oversight because the oversight board members have all been hand picked by the Bush administration. </p>
<p>This bill does not effectively deal with the issue of foreclosures and addressing that very serious issue, which is impacting millions of low- and moderate-income Americans in the aggressive, effective way that we should be. </p>
<p>This bill does not effectively deal with the issue of executive compensation and golden parachutes. Under this bill, the CEOs and the Wall Street insiders will still, with a little bit of imagination, continue to make out like bandits.</p>
<p>This bill does not deal at all with how we got into this crisis in the first place and the need to undo the deregulatory fervor which created trillions of dollars in complicated and unregulated financial instruments such as credit default swaps and hedge funds. </p>
<p>This bill does not address the issue that has taken us to where we are today, the concept of too big to fail. In fact, within the last several weeks we have sat idly by and watched gigantic financial institutions like the Bank of America swallow up other gigantic financial institutions like Countrywide and Merrill Lynch. Well, who is going to bail out the Bank of America if it begins to fail? There is not one word about the issue of too big to fail in this legislation at a time when that problem is in fact becoming even more serious.</p>
<p>This bill does not deal with the absurdity of having the fox guarding the hen house. Maybe I&#8217;m the only person in America who thinks so, but I have a hard time understanding why we are giving $700 billion to the Secretary of the Treasury, the former CEO of Goldman Sachs, who along with other financial institutions, actually got us into this problem. Now, maybe I&#8217;m the only person in America who thinks that&#8217;s a little bit weird, but that is what I think.</p>
<p>This bill does not address the major economic crisis we face: growing unemployment, low wages, the need to create decent-paying jobs, rebuilding our infrastructure and moving us to energy efficiency and sustainable energy. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then Bernie comes to the crux of the matter:<br />
<blockquote>There is one issue that is even more profound and more basic than everything else that I have mentioned, and that is if a bailout is needed, if taxpayer money must be placed at risk, whose money should it be? <i>In other words, who should be paying for this bailout which has been caused by the greed and recklessness of Wall Street operatives who have made billions in recent years?</i> </p></blockquote>
<p>Before answering this rhetorical question, Bernie calls our attention to a few unsavory facts:<br />
<blockquote>
<p>Over the last seven and a half year, since George W. Bush has been President, 6 million Americans have slipped out of the middle class and are in poverty, and today working families are lining up at emergency food shelves in order to get the food they need to feed their families. </p>
<p>Since President Bush has been in office, median family income for working-age families has declined by over $2,000. </p>
<p>More than seven million Americans have lost their health insurance. </p>
<p>Over four million have lost their pensions. Consumer debt has more than doubled. And foreclosures are the highest on record. Meanwhile, the cost of energy, food, health care, college and other basic necessities has soared. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then Bernie asks: Who, in the last seven years, made the money&#8211;and how much did they make?<br />
<blockquote>
<p>For the first seven years of Bush&#8217;s tenure, the wealthiest 400 individuals in our country saw a $670 billion increase in their wealth, and at the end of 2007 owned over $1.5 trillion in wealth. </p>
<p>In our country today, we have the most unequal distribution of income and wealth of any major country on earth, with the top 1 percent earning more income than the bottom 50 percent and the top 1 percent owning more wealth than the bottom 90 percent. </p>
<p>CEOs of Wall Street firms received unbelievable amounts in bonuses, including $39 billion in bonuses in the year 2007 alone for just the five major investment houses.</p>
<p>We have seen the incredible greed of the financial services industry manifested in the hundreds of millions of dollars they have spent on campaign contributions and lobbyists in order to deregulate their industry so that hedge funds and other unregulated financial institutions could flourish. </p>
<p>We have seen them play with trillions and trillions dollars in esoteric financial instruments, in unregulated industries which no more than a handful of people even understand. </p>
<p>We have seen the financial services industry charge 30 percent interest rates on credit card loans and tack on outrageous late fees and other costs to unsuspecting customers. </p>
<p>We have seen them engaged in despicable predatory lending practices, taking advantage of the vulnerable and the uneducated. We have seen them send out billions of deceptive solicitations to almost every mailbox in America. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is hard to argue with Bernie. Eh? And now his solution:<br />
<blockquote>
<p>I proposed to raise the tax rate on any individual earning $500,000 a year or more or any family earning $1 million a year or more by 10 percent. </p>
<p>That increase in the tax rate, from 35 percent to 45 percent, would raise more than $300 billion in the next five years, almost half the cost of the bailout. </p>
<p>If what all the supporters of this legislation say is correct, that the government will get back some of its money when the market calms down and the government sells some of the assets it has purchased, then $300 billion should be sufficient to make sure that 99.7 percent of taxpayers do not have to pay one nickel for this bailout. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I do like Bernie&#8217;s style and his thinking. I am not sure his 10% hike would really solve the credit problem at this point. It would, however, help make the bailout itself more palatable for the rest of us. It might also be a signal that we are about to get serious about the kind uncontrolled greed that has gotten the green light from those who should know better.</p>

                                <p>CNN does some he-said, she-said, but <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2008/09/21/news/economy/bailout_proposal_Sunday/index.htm">throws in some data</a>:<br />
<blockquote>The administration&#8217;s proposal also requests that Congress authorize an increase to the nation&#8217;s debt ceiling. Currently, it&#8217;s set to rise to $10.6 trillion for fiscal year 2009 &#8211; which runs from October 2008 through September 2009. But the proposal requests that limit be increased to $11.315 trillion to allow for the purchases of mortgage-backed assets. [emphasis mine]</p></blockquote>
<p>Now, strangely, I have always heard that assets have a positive value.  When I buy $100 worth of a stock—say, PWND—my Net Asset Value doesn&#8217;t change.  The same should be true of buying a MBS worth $0.30 on the dollar.</p>
<p>So why would we need to increase the deficit ceiling by $700,000,000,000 if we&#8217;re buying assets worth $700,000,000,000?</p>
<p>The only reasonable conclusion is that we plan to pay $700,000,000,000 <strong><em>above market</em></strong> for the securities.  No wonder it has to be &#8220;clean and quick.&#8221;</p>

(Or, as I would prefer to write it, just so everyone understands: $900,000,000,000.  About 3,000 a person, or 26.7% of the annual median household income, assuming a family of four.)</p>
<p>What would makes anyone think <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/09/just-like-beanie-babies.html">another $700,000,000,000</a> will solve the problem?  Just because &#8220;sooner or later, you&#8217;re talking about real money&#8221;?</p>
<p>It is, or should be, <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/09/understanding-t.html">no longer possible to pretend that this is still just a liquidity crisis</a>. Certainly, <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/09/perception-v-reality.html">the Fed isn&#8217;t doing so</a>. It is well beyond that.</p>
<p>Adding liquidity will not solve the problem. And if the plan is to buy assets above their value—then why are we expected to <em>buy</em> Beanie Babies?  Shouldn&#8217;t we be selling them to Treasury Secretary <s>Gramm</s> <s>Fiorina</s> Paulson?</p>

                                <p>UPDATE:  <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/20/no-deal/">Krugman comes to the same conclusions, more concisely</a>.  (That&#8217;s why he gets paid the big bucks.)  And Brad DeLong has modified <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/09/understanding-t.html">his original position</a> to the point where <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/09/note-to-self-po.html">it&#8217;s got a good chance of working going forward</a>.</p>
<p>I started a &#8220;<a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/09/what-is-asset.html">What is an Asset</a>&#8221; post yesterday, which got sidetracked by Brad DeLong&#8217;s urging that the rewards for bad behavior be maintained while expecting a return to the &#8220;good&#8221; intertemporal equilibrium to be maintainable in the face of payoff-dominant strategies that, in his scenario, become equally risky and offer higher rewards.*</p>
<p>For those who want to see where the post would have gone, let us pull two comments from  AnonCC to the fore:<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;There are only a few problems, key of which is the title of this piece. Derivatives may have a value, but are they actually assets? Worse, if the Fed buys an asset, does it also have to buy all of the associated derivative contracts, one side of which may—by that simple—become worthless or become payable?&#8221;</p>
<p>This is precisely what really scares me about Paulson&#8217;s description of the bailout plan. Hybrid and synthetic CDOs (which cover most CDOs issued from 2006 on) are definitely not assets! These monsters are insurance companies that will be seen to be severely underfunded when insurers like MBIA, Ambac and AIG fail to pay on their reinsurance policies. If Treasury buys these insurance obligations, it will become a financial insurer for subprime.</p>
<p>(I should add that there are cash CDOs that are not insurance companies and can be fairly considered as assets. So all CDOs cannot be grouped in the same category.)</p>
<p>I think we&#8217;re talking hundreds of billions paid up front for the privilege of providing this insurance, and trillions out the back door to hedge funds and the remaining investment banks over the next decade.</p></blockquote>
<p>Dean Baker <a href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/beat_the_press_archive?month=09&#038;year=2008&#038;base_name=questions_on_the_bush_bailout">takes  the question of the bailout to an even more elementary level</a>, having remembered that there is a market and therefore a &#8220;market value&#8221;:<br />
<blockquote>The most obvious question: is how will paying market price for near worthless assets prevent the collapse of zombie institutions like Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers and AIG? These institutions needed money. They won&#8217;t get it from selling mortgage backed securities, that are chock full of bad mortgages, at the market price. We already know this, because they already had the option to do so.</p>
<p>The Bush proposal to throw out hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars to buy up this debt will do little if anything to prevent another round of collapsing banks. We will again see desperate weekends with Treasury and Fed honchos running around trying to save the next major basket case.</p>
<p>The other big question is: how will we get the banks to honestly describe the assets they throw into the auction?</p></blockquote>
<p>Unless the Fed is planning to buy assets at <em>above</em> market value—that is, to directly subsidize those same bankers and firms with taxpayer dollars, with concomitantly to make those risky assets &#8220;less&#8221; risky in the market and still providing no route or incentive to return to the &#8220;good&#8221; equilibrium—the &#8220;bailout&#8221; as discussed with have no positive effect on the health of the firm(s).</p>
<p>So what Henry Paulson is proposing has to be a direct subsidy to have any effect.</p>
<p>As an isolated plan, it is a reward for bad behavior.  Only if it were combined with those items for which we &#8220;don&#8217;t have time&#8221;—say, <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2008/09/recapitalizatio.html">the plan suggested by Mark Thoma</a>—could it possibly be an economically viable plan:<br />
<blockquote>First, in return for taking toxic assets off of a firms books at a price that is higher than the market rate, the government would get a share of any future profits the firm makes for some time period, say 10% for ten years, something like that. Administratively, it could come as an increased tax rate on profits and, if it helps politically, it could be earmarked for a particular cause. The government pays the firm a fair value for the assets plus an additional amount to help with recapitalization, and in return gets a claim on future profits for a period of time (I would also tie executive compensation directly to profits to help prevent gaming).</p></blockquote>
<p>*As a result of this, and some unfelicitous phrasing, I am now in DeLong Coventry.  I can live with that.</p>
