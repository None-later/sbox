				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I&#8217;m sure you are all feeling kind of blah.  You have this final exam for this session and I can tell by your performances on the quizzes that you are still confused.  The problem solving portions of the quizzes have been very telling.  So lets review.   </div>
<div>  </div>
<div></div>
<div>You&#8217;re taxes are not too high.  It&#8217;s your income that is too low!  Remember this and you will be able to solve enough of the problems to obtain a passing grade and graduate.  And class, no one running today for president gets this.  It is why President Obama looked like such a dufus in the debate.  Romney took a step to his left&#8230; right into Obama&#8217;s policy space.  Where does one go to gain more space when they have walled up the door to the left of them as President Obama has?</div>
<div></div>
<div>Let&#8217;s get something real clear from the beginning.  Unless you are acquiring the majority of your money from money  YOU ARE NOT<a href="https://www.google.com/#hl=en&#038;output=search&#038;sclient=psy-ab&#038;q=define+capitalist&#038;oq=define+&#038;gs_l=hp.1.0.35i39j0l3.735.1657.0.3579.7.6.0.0.0.0.219.938.0j5j1.6.0.les%3B..0.0...1c.1.VPyK4hyLvzM&#038;pbx=1&#038;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.&#038;fp=f2b10cd80850d317&#038;biw=1024&#038;bih=600" target="_blank"> A CAPITALIST</a> </div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>Second: A MARKET IS NOT AN ECONOMY.</div>
<p><a name="more"></a>
<div></div>
<div>You my fellow students, are citizens living in a particular social structure that can be understood by various groupings of all human interaction that takes place within.  The largest grouping is “society”.    Yes, there is the ultimate grouping known as the human race, but I&#8217;m keeping this discussion and exam limited to the USA society.  (If you pass, you will get to tackle the larger human race grouping in your graduate studies.)  An economy is one such organizational grouping of activity.  A democracy is another.   A “market” is only a labeling of activity.  It is one of many relational activities within an economy and/or a democracy within a society.  An election is another such activity. </div>
<div></div>
<div>Now, this is very important: THERE IS NO HIEARCHY of the various groupings.  There can&#8217;t be.  It&#8217;s impossible as the groupings are not determinate of life and living.   I will tell you that my physiology professor stated that the determinate of life is a membrane.  So, let&#8217;s get off the “market” kick.  Trust me, “market” will not be an answer on the exam.   </div>
<div></div>
<div>If you are not a citizen capitalist, then you are a citizen laborer.  (These are descriptive labels that are not all inclusive of your potential grouping.)   You are acquiring your money mostly via your labor.  Physical labor, cognitive labor  it does not matter because you are using some ratio of both to acquire your money.  You are expending your labor to your personal level of comfort.  Note, I did not say you are expending your labor to the level of market ability or market possibility.  Your labor does not determine your comfort.  Your labor is not interpretative of your comfort.  It is having obtained your level of desired comfort (comfort as defined by you) that will have determined your labor expended.   </div>
<div></div>
<div>Society ultimately determines your value which is based on what society deems of value to it.  Now I know you are thinking I&#8217;ve really put my foot in it here.  I haven&#8217;t.  The market does not determine your value.  The collective of “society” does determine your value and the collective is dynamic though I am not implying any particular velocity of dynamism.  I am not quantifying or qualifying the dynamism.  Elections do the determining.  </div>
<div></div>
<div>Now that we are all on the same page, let me repeat myself: YOUR TAXES ARE NOT TOO HIGH.</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>Your income is too low and no one running for president sees your relationship in this economy in this way.  They don&#8217;t see it because not enough of you see it this way either.  To many are acting as if they are capitalists.  To many are acting as if the market is determinate.  Who the hell is in control here?  YOU or the market?   </div>
<div></div>
<div>So, let me explain your current condition and thus in doing so provide you with what the goal needs to be of any policy (and a focus of your essay) that either of the two presidential candidates propose.  It is working the goal that will allow you to obtain the highest grade on the exam.  Hell, let&#8217;s include the congressional candidates also. They make proposals all the time.  Understand the goal and how you acquire your money and the essay portion (voting) will be a snap.  Original thinking combined with the greatest inclusiveness will get a higher grade.</div>
<div></div>
<div>You are living in the median household.  I know this because, class&#8230; say it with me: I am not a capitalist.   </div>
<div>In 1976 your household had the median income of $12,690.   </div>
<div></div>
<div>Using the magic of the <a href="http://www.measuringworth.com/m/calculators/uscompare/%20" target="_blank">Measuring Worth</a>site  (it is the  only calculator allowed for your final) your household in 2011 has grown to $52,200.00 based on the skilled labor value.   Notice, we are not using the skilled capitalist value (there is none listed).</div>
<div></div>
<div>Unfortunately for you, the census states that your household actually has only $50,054 of income.  The difference of $2146 is the results of your labor not being valued as much as it was in 1976.  Society has decided that what ever it is you are doing it is not of such value as it was in 1976.  In fact, your value is so little that it did not even keep up with inflation.  How ya feeling about that?</div>
<div></div>
<div>Still thinking it&#8217;s that your taxes are too high?   </div>
<div></div>
<div>Well class, here&#8217;s the real pain: $61,629.00.*   This is the number that you would have if society had just kept the dynamics as they were.   For the sensitive students, unfortunately the ever dynamic society just didn&#8217;t keep the same flaming intensity of love for you as it now cherishes for the capitalist.   Sorry class.  Society has changed.  It values the capitalist more.  Thus, society has changed the economy so that the market activities result in more of the income produced going to the capitalist.  Society did this to you.  </div>
<div></div>
<div>Have I made this personal enough for you?  (Remember&#8230;the essay.)   Just in case I haven&#8217;t, recall the earlier part of this review.  You are a part of a collective group called “society”.  </div>
<div></div>
<div>Let&#8217;s recap:  Society.  You are a part of society.  Society is dynamic.  Elections determine.  You are not a capitalist.  &#8220;Economy&#8221; is a grouping.  &#8220;Market&#8221; is not an answer.  Your taxes are not to high.  Your income is to low.    </div>
<div></div>
<div>Here is the major essay question:  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fgjfi1DU1mQ" target="_blank">What do you want from life</a>?  I look for original thought and inclusiveness.   Bonus points if you can relate it all to the preamble of the USA societal organizing document.I remove points for facts supported by opinion.</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>*As calculated by using the ratio of the share of income for the non capitalist to capitalist  in 1976 to the time period of around now (like today).</div>
<div></div>
<div>$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$</div>
<div></div>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>by <strong>Mike Kimel</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Effect of Individual Income Tax Rates on the Economy, Part 1: 1901 &#8211; 1928</strong> </p>
<p>In 1913, the 16th Amendment to the Constitution led to the income tax system we know and don&#8217;t love today.  Since that time, in fact, since way before that time, people have been arguing about the effect of taxes on the economy.  Over the next few posts, I will take a systematic look at the relationship between individual tax rates and the economy going as far back as the data allows in the United States.</p>
<p>In most of these posts, I will measure the effect of the economy using growth in real GDP per capita.  However, that series only dates back to 1929.  So in today&#8217;s post, which will focus on the period up to December 1928, I will look at the recessions (using official dates from the <a href="http://www.nber.org/cycles.html">NBER</a> and compare that to top individual marginal tax rates as published in the <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/histab23.xls">IRS&#8217; statistics of income historical table 23</a>.</p>
<p>The graph below shows the top marginal tax rate (black line) and periods in which the economy was in recession (gray bars) going back to January 1901.  (Note &#8211; the economy was in a recession from June of 1899 to December 1900, so January 1901 is a nice &#8220;clean slate&#8221; date at which to start.)  </p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-hWeel4ZxERk/TkhdlowX3SI/AAAAAAAAAq8/UcKIo90LuEQ/s1600/individual%2Bincome%2Btaxes.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-hWeel4ZxERk/TkhdlowX3SI/AAAAAAAAAq8/UcKIo90LuEQ/s320/individual%2Bincome%2Btaxes.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>Figure 1.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>I think the graph above lends itself to be division into three more or less discrete periods.  The first is the pre-tax period from 1901 until 1912.  The second is the &#8220;rising tax&#8221; period from 1913 through 1918, and the third is the &#8220;falling tax&#8221; period from 1919 to 1928.  </p>
<p>Now, if you asked the typical economics professor  or politician or conservative to rank three periods &#8211; no individual income taxes, rising individual income tax rates, and falling individual income tax rates &#8211; in terms of time spent in recession, you&#8217;d probably hear this back, &#8220;The economy will spend less time in recession when there are no income taxes, and the most time in recession when tax rates are rising.&#8221;  </p>
<p>But that isn&#8217;t what the data shows.  The time spent in recession is pretty comparable.  The percentage of months under recession in the pre-tax period is 43.8%.  The percentage of months under recession in the rising tax period is 40.3%.  The percentage of months under recession in the falling tax period is 42.5%.</p>
<p>Now let&#8217;s talk some nuance.  A recession is not a recession is not a recession.  For instance, the recession that began in 1907 was pretty severe, and is often referred to as the Panic of 1907.  The recession of 1918 was caused by the end of WW2.  And then there&#8217;s one more detail worth mentioning, the elephant not in the room so to speak.  The graph doesn&#8217;t show what happened in 1929, following just over a decade of tax cuts (in which time the top marginal rate fell from 77% to 24%), we had the Great Depression.  </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>By Daniel Becker</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>In the comments to my post <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/08/reminder-from-obamas-february-2009.html">&#8220;A reminder from Obama&#8217;s February 2009 speech&#8221;</a>, there is the following:</div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><div>&#8220;I guess it relates to the fake Obama they had made up in their heads,&#8230;&#8221; </div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>This sums up the early comments to the post suggesting that those who trusted Obama have only themselves to blame.</div>
<div></div>
<div>I addressed that concept in <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2008/11/obama-is-he-or-isnt-he-real.html">Obama, is he or isn&#8217;t he real&#8230;?</a>  In that post I presented transcripts of Obama&#8217;s speeches and responses to questions and then argued:   </div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><div>&#8220;Are those talking like Glen Greenwald correct in that people should not be surprised with Obama&#8217;s appointments? Maybe, but then based on the above Obama words, that would mean we (you and I) just plain have to approach our relationship with governing as suspect until proven otherwise. Unfortunately, that means we will always be a day late and a dollar short having never known at the time of the decision if we made the correct one because you can not go by what is said.&#8221;</div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>I recommend people go and not only read the posting, but the comments.  (History is always fun to review.)</div>
<div></div>
<div>I concluded that posting with:</div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><div> &#8220;Do you know what happens to a person when they can never get a straight, no hidden agenda answer from one they count on? They go nuts.&#8221;</div>
</blockquote>

<hr xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">  
<div>This all speaks to the issue of growing our economy, because to promote distrust in a developed economy where 77% of our capital is intangible (via 2005 World Bank study) is to be destroying the prime driver of our growth. I wrote about the issue of were our true wealth comes from a few times.  For this posting I am drawing on<a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2009/02/attention-republicansblue-dog.html"> Attention Republicans/Blue Dog Democrates: Tax cuts as stimulus work against your goal.</a></div>
<div>February 5, 2009.  </div>
<div></div>
<div>From the World Bank study:  </div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><div>“An economy with a very efficient judicial system, clear and enforceable property rights, and an effective and uncorrupt government will produce higher total wealth.”</div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>I concluded:</div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><div> &#8220;The republicans/blue dogs, and those helping them by lending their &#8220;professionalism&#8221;, think they are only effecting a political strategy. In truth, they are destroying the very basis for the wealth they desire. Their entire campaign for decades to discredit, to instill mistrust in the primary institution we have, the US (We the People) government, has been the primary cause to our economic decline. To increase the level of distrust is to decrease the available “intangible capital” which is 77% of our wealth generating power. &#8220;</div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>Which brings us to what we just experienced with the debt ceiling issue.  It&#8217;s not just the resulting budget changes, it&#8217;s the overall cognitive change being made in the people regarding trust of our ability to access a candidate and make the choice that will produce the desired results.  Clinton, as for the Dems made the first blow to our trust with &#8220;triangulation&#8221;.  I can and have on my own gone back and read speeches and answers to questions by Clinton during his first run and it shows the same as I note regarding Obama in &#8220;is he or isn&#8217;t he real&#8221;.  Obama is (knowingly or not) bringing our trust close to death.   </div>
<div>Even the debt ceiling event is only the latest in a string of recent events that all drive an additional spike into the coffin of &#8220;trust&#8221;.   </div>
<div></div>
<div>Last night on Racheal Maddow&#8217;s show, Chris Hayes, noted that we are now in a phase of governance where &#8220;created&#8221; crisis is the vehicle for results.  Yes, Shock Doctrine governance level II..  It was presented from the perspective that the conservative mind set is the one employing such a tactic.</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>Visit msnbc.com for <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/">breaking news</a>, <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3032507">world news</a>, and <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3032072">news about the economy</a></div>
<p>
<div></div>
<div>  In my opinion, what he missed, and what makes this a unique form to this nation&#8217;s version of Naomie Klein&#8217;s  Shock Doctrine is that there are enough economically conservative minded people in the opposing party (democratic party in this case) that the ruse can be played out with a more believable presentation than if just one side is playing along.  Yes, both side play it differently, but would that not be expected based on the supposed &#8220;base party&#8221; paradigms?  At no time during any of these &#8220;crisis&#8221; did the primary players on the democratic side resist the crisis by calling it out.  Instead, they used it to get what the conservative faction of the party (a smaller faction since the last election) wants. These &#8220;wants&#8221; being very much inline with the republican non Norquist/Tea Party faction&#8217;s wants.  Commonly referenced as  Wall Street.  In the end, no one to blame&#8230;It was the crisis.  </div>
<div></div>
<div>This pattern has held true through out Obama&#8217;s current term.  In the latest example, the proposed budget from the house progressive caucus, the largest of the democratic party caucuses never was mentioned by the president.  Recall the single payer health insurance issue? </div>
<div></div>
<div>The issue for this posting is not the &#8220;wants&#8221;.  It is not about the resulting policy from the latest ruse played on We the People.  The prime issue, the issue always suggested, implied, bandied about, but never out and out confronted: Public Trust.   </div>
<div></div>
<div>This latest Obama/conservative policy process has brought us closer than ever to the demise of our economy and thus our democracy not primarily by the furthering of the financial disequilibrium, but by the perpetuation and enlarging of the perimeters of social order that will now be distrusted.  I think we have approached, if not completely included the full boundaries of American culture in that which is to be distrusted with the completion of this debt crisis event. </div>
<div></div>
<div>Sadly, I do not think Obama and those referred to as the &#8220;adults in the room&#8221; know what they have done.  Instead. as I stated above, they believe they are just &#8220;effecting a political strategy&#8221;. </div>
<div></div>
<div> </div>
<div>There are 2 versions of distrust.  First is the distrust nurtured by those who have made it a political tool of their strategy for political dominance, power and fortune.  It is the &#8220;&#8230;most dangerous words in the English language: I am from the government and I am here to help you&#8221;.  These people do not know that in essence their distrust is part of the ruse.  The other distrust is those who see the ruse, have acted via those they trusted only to find they can no longer be trusted.  I don&#8217;t believe one is worse than the other, but I do know having both means the solution will be slower in materializing.  In both cases those in power can not be trusted and those who know it, presently have no one in power to represent their solutions.  It serves to make the what is the solution clear, it does not server to make it any easier or quicker in coming. </div>
<div></div>
<div> </div>
<div>I do not believe this mode of operation is forever simply because we are not naturally selfish, self serving for survival sake creatures. We are not naturally so shallow in our collective thinking.  It is only in our isolated, individual thought that we can and will be shallow.  Of course this assumes that the concepts and application of virtual reality throughout our daily lives does not mutate us way from our natural self.   A big assumption considering &#8220;reality&#8221; is in the phrase &#8220;virtual reality&#8221; and the character dynamic is trust.    </div>

<p><strong>Why the Rich Love High Unemployment</strong><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://truthout.org/why-rich-love-high-unemployment/1305061465">via Truthout</a></p>
<p>Christina Romer, former member of President Obama&#8217;s Council of Economic Advisors, accuses the administration of &#8220;shamefully ignoring&#8221; the unemployed. Paul Krugman echoes her concerns, observing that Washington has lost interest in &#8220;the forgotten millions.&#8221; America&#8217;s unemployed have been ignored and forgotten, but they are far from superfluous. Over the last two years, out-of-work Americans have played a critical role in helping the richest one percent recover trillions in financial wealth.</p>
<p>Obama&#8217;s advisers often congratulate themselves for avoiding another Great Depression &#8211; an assertion not amenable to serious analysis or debate. A better way to evaluate their claims is to compare the US economy to other rich countries over the last few years. </p>
<p> <a name="more"></a>
<p>On the basis of sustaining economic growth, the United States is doing better than nearly all advanced economies. From the first quarter of 2008 to the end of 2010, US gross domestic product (GDP) growth<a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2011/04/04/recovery-in-the-u-s-beats-other-advanced-economies/">outperformed every G-7 country except Canada</a>.</p>
<p>But when it comes to jobs, US policymakers fall short of their rosy self-evaluations. Despite the second-highest economic growth, Paul Wiseman of the Associated Press (AP)<a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/42349181/ns/business-world_business/">reports:</a>&#8220;the U.S. job market remains the group&#8217;s weakest. U.S. employment bottomed and started growing again a year ago, but there are still 5.4 percent fewer American jobs than in December 2007. That&#8217;s a much sharper drop than in any other G-7 country.&#8221; According to an important study by Andrew Sum and Joseph McLaughlin, the US boasted one of the lowest unemployment rates in the rich world before the housing crash &#8211; now, it&#8217;s the highest.<a href="http://truthout.org/why-rich-love-high-unemployment/#1">[1] </a></p>
<p>The gap between economic growth and job creation reflects three separate but mutually reinforcing factors: US corporate governance, Obama&#8217;s economic policies and the deregulation of US labor markets.</p>
<p>Old economic models assume that companies merely react to external changes in demand &#8211; lacking independent agency or power. While executives must adapt to falling demand, they retain a fair amount of discretion in how they will respond and who will bear the brunt of the pain. Corporate culture and organization vary from country to country.</p>
<p>In the boardrooms of corporate America, profits aren&#8217;t everything &#8211; they are the only thing. A JPMorgan research<a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/article/profit-recovery-driven-plunging-labor-costs-explains-why-pe-multiples-will-remain-depressed">report</a>concludes that the current corporate profit recovery is more dependent on falling unit-labor costs than during any previous expansion. At some level, corporate executives are aware that they are lowering workers&#8217; living standards, but their decisions are neither coordinated nor intentionally harmful. Call it the &#8220;paradox of profitability.&#8221; Executives are acting in their own and their shareholders&#8217; best interest: maximizing profit margins in the face of weak demand by extensive layoffs and pay cuts. But what has been good for every company&#8217;s income statement has been a disaster for working families and their communities.</p>
<p>Obama&#8217;s lopsided recovery also reflects lopsided government intervention. Apart from all the talk about jobs, the Obama administration never supported a concrete employment plan. The stimulus provided relief, but it was too small and did not focus on job creation.</p>
<p>The administration&#8217;s problem is not a question of economics, but a matter of values and priorities.  In the first Great Depression, President Roosevelt created an alphabet soup of institutions &#8211; the Works Progress Administration (WPA), the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) and the  Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) &#8211; to directly relieve the unemployment problem, a crisis the private sector was unable and unwilling to solve. In the current crisis, banks were handed bottomless bowls of alphabet soup &#8211; the Troubled  Asset Relief Program (TARP), the Public-Private Investment Program (PPIP) and the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) &#8211; while politicians dithered over extending inadequate unemployment benefits.  </p>
<p>The unemployment crisis has its origins in the housing crash, but the prior deregulation of the labor market made the fallout more severe. Like other changes to economic policy in recent decades, the deregulation of the labor market tilts the balance of power in favor of business and against workers. Unlike financial system reform, the deregulation of the labor market is not on President Obama&#8217;s agenda and has escaped much commentary.</p>
<p>Labor-market deregulation boils down to three things: weak unions, weak worker protection laws and weak overall employment. In addition to protecting wages and benefits, unions also protect jobs. Union contracts prevent management from indiscriminately firing workers and shifting the burden onto remaining employees. After decades of imposed decline, the United States currently has the<a href="http://rankingamerica.wordpress.com/2009/05/01/the-us-ranks-27th-in-unions/">fourth-lowest private sector union membership</a>in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).</p>
<p>America&#8217;s low rate of union membership partly explains why unemployment rose so fast and, &#8211; thanks to hectic productivity growth &#8211; hiring has been so slow.</p>
<p>Proponents of labor-market flexibility argue that it&#8217;s easier for the private sector to create jobs when the transactional costs associated with hiring and firing are reduced. Perhaps fortunately, legal protections for American workers cannot get any lower: US labor laws make it the easiest place in the word to fire or replace employees,<a href="http://www.oecd.org/document/11/0,3746,en_2649_33927_42695243_1_1_1_1,00.html">according to the OECD.</a></p>
<p>Another consequence of labor-market flexibility has been the shift from full-time jobs to temporary positions. In 2010,<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/20/business/economy/20temp.html">26 percent of all news jobs were temporary</a>&#8211; compared with less than 11 percent in the early 1990&#8217;s recovery and just 7.1 percent in the early 2000&#8217;s.</p>
<p><a href="https://members.truth-out.org/donate">Fight the lies and misinformation! Please make a tax-deductible donation to Truthout today and keep real independent journalism strong.</a></p>
<p>The American model of high productivity and low pay has friends in high places. Former Obama adviser and General Motors (GM) car czar<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-right-path-on-jobs-jobs-jobs/2011/01/30/ABqPCME_story.html">Steven Rattner argues</a>that America&#8217;s unemployment crisis is a sign of strength: </p>
<blockquote><p>Perversely, the nagging high jobless rate reflects two of the most promising attributes of the American economy: its flexibility and its productivity. Eliminating jobs &#8211; with all the wrenching human costs &#8211; raises productivity and, thereby, competitiveness.</p>
<p>Unusually, US productivity grew right through the recession; normally, companies can&#8217;t reduce costs fast enough to keep productivity from falling.</p>
<p>That kind of efficiency is perhaps our most precious economic asset. However tempting it may be, we need to resist tinkering with the labor market. Policy proposals aimed too directly at raising employment may well collaterally end up dragging on productivity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rattner comes dangerously close to articulating a full-unemployment policy. He suggests unemployed workers don&#8217;t merit the same massive government intervention that served GM and the banks so well. When Wall Street was on the ropes, both administrations sensibly argued, &#8220;doing nothing is not an option.&#8221; For the long-term unemployed, doing nothing appears to be Washington&#8217;s preferred policy.</p>
<p>The unemployment crisis has been a godsend for America&#8217;s superrich, who own the vast majority of financial assets &#8211; stocks, bonds, currency and commodities. </p>
<p>Persistent unemployment and weak unions have changed the American workforce into a buyers&#8217; market &#8211; job seekers and workers are now &#8220;price takers&#8221; rather than &#8220;price makers.&#8221; Obama&#8217;s recovery shares with Reagan&#8217;s early years the distinction of being the only two post-war expansions where wage concessions have been the rule rather than the exception. The year 2009 marked the slowest wage growth on record, followed by the second slowest in 2010.<a href="http://truthout.org/why-rich-love-high-unemployment/#2">[2]</a></p>
<p>America&#8217;s labor market depression propels asset price appreciation. In the last two years, US corporate profits and share prices rose at the fastest pace in history &#8211; and the fastest in the G-7.    Considering the source of profits, the soaring stock market appears less a beacon of prosperity than a reliable proxy for America&#8217;s new misery index. Mark Whitehouse of The Wall Street Journal<a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2011/03/05/number-of-the-week-workers-not-benefiting-from-productivity-gains/">describes</a>Obama&#8217;s hamster wheel recovery:</p>
<blockquote><p>From mid-2009 through the end of 2010, output per hour at U.S. nonfarm businesses rose 5.2% as companies found ways to squeeze more from their existing workers. But the lion&#8217;s share of that gain went to shareholders in the form of record profits, rather than to workers in the form of raises. Hourly wages, adjusted for inflation, rose only 0.3%, according to the Labor Department. In other words, companies shared only 6% of productivity gains with their workers. That compares to 58% since records began in 1947.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Workers&#8217; wages and salaries represent roughly two-thirds of production costs and drive inflation. High inflation is a bondholders&#8217; worst enemy because bonds are fixed-income securities. For example, if a bond yields a fixed five percent and inflation is running at four percent, the bond&#8217;s real return is reduced to one percent. High unemployment constrains labor costs and, thus, also functions as an anchor on inflation and inflation expectations &#8211; protecting bondholders&#8217; real return and principal. Thanks to the absence of real wage growth and inflation over the last two years, bond funds have attracted record inflows and<a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704530204576237182248727802.html">investors have profited immensely. </a></p>
<p>The Federal Reserve has played the leading role in sustaining the recovery, but monetary policies work indirectly and disproportionately favor the wealthy. Low interest rates have helped banks recapitalize, allowed businesses and households to refinance debt and provided Wall Street with a tsunami of liquidity &#8211; but its impact on employment and wage growth has been negligible. </p>
<p>CNBC&#8217;s Jim Cramer<a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/42308019/When_Bad_News_Is_Good_News">provides insight</a>into the counterintuitive link between a rotten economy and soaring asset prices: &#8220;We are and have been in the longest &#8216;bad news is good news&#8217; moment that I have ever come across in my 31 years of trading. That means the bad news keeps producing the low interest rates that make stocks, particularly stocks with decent dividend protection, more attractive than their fixed income alternatives.&#8221; In other words, the longer Ben Bernanke&#8217;s policies fail to lower unemployment, the longer Wall Street enjoys a free ride. </p>
<p>Out-of-work Americans deserve more than unemployment checks &#8211; they deserve dividends. The rich would never have recovered without them. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Crossposted at <a href="http://streetlightblog.blogspot.com/">The Street Light.</a></em></p>
<p>The more I get to know this recovery, the more I’m starting to like it.</p>
<p>Yes, it’s been rather standoffish, giving the cold shoulder to millions of unemployed Americans. And true, through much of 2010 it was maddeningly elusive, never giving us confidence that it was here to stay. But the more data I review from the second half of 2010, the more I start liking what I see. Particularly because the data suggests to me that this recovery, while not roaring, is being built on a solid foundation, and therefore has the potential to grow into something pretty meaningful as this year progresses.</p>
<p>There are four things in particular that make me guardedly happy about this recovery.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p><strong>1. The manufacturing sector. </strong><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Ne0uGUCxusE/TVnGz4SA6hI/AAAAAAAAAYE/WOLwDVbEtI4/s1600/manuf%2Bjobs1.PNG"><img border="0" alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Ne0uGUCxusE/TVnGz4SA6hI/AAAAAAAAAYE/WOLwDVbEtI4/s320/manuf%2Bjobs1.PNG"></a><br />I’ve spent a lot of time over the last week explaining why I am <a href="http://streetlightblog.blogspot.com/2011/02/lean-mean-manufacturing-machine.html">bullish on US manufacturing</a>. The manufacturing sector is too small to make a significant dent in the US’s vast unemployment problem. However, it has been the source of some net job creation (see table), and more generally is a good indicator of the competitiveness of the US economy in terms of international trade. Which brings us to&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>2. US exports. </strong><br />Exports from the US did very well in the second half of 2010, which helped to give the US economy a substantial boost toward the end of the year. Best of all, this strong export performance was driven by <a href="http://streetlightblog.blogspot.com/2011/02/selling-stuff-to-china.html">sales to the growing, dynamic, developing countries of the world like China</a>. That makes it likely that continued rapid growth in China and other developing countries will actually provide a noticeable boost to the US economy in 2011 and going forward. Compare this with what happened during the recovery from the previous recession. As shown in the chart below, in 2002-03 US export growth only provided a modest 0.45% boost to GDP. This time around, however, US export growth has been adding over a full percentage point to US GDP growth.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-IvpgBH-KSzo/TVnHlGs_JQI/AAAAAAAAAYM/9X5ZJSTzh8w/s1600/recovery%2B1.PNG"><img border="0" alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-IvpgBH-KSzo/TVnHlGs_JQI/AAAAAAAAAYM/9X5ZJSTzh8w/s400/recovery%2B1.PNG"></a><br /><strong>3. Business purchases of investment goods.</strong><br />Unlike the recovery from the last recession, when businesses were extremely slow to begin purchasing new equipment and machinery, in 2010 business spending on things other than buildings grew at a healthy rate. In fact, investment spending in “equipment and software” (the “e&#038;s” in the chart above) added over a full percentage point to GDP growth through 2010. The best part of this kind of spending is that it provides a much greater boost to productivity, and thus long-term economic growth, than personal consumption spending. The fact that in 2010 far more of the growth in real GDP came from business investment (and less from residential investment) than was true during the previous recovery is a very good sign for medium and long-term economic growth in the US.</p>
<p><strong>4. Household financial retrenching. </strong><br />The biggest drag on economic growth during this recovery has been the ongoing financial rebalancing that US households have been doing by paying down debt. But while this has meant that consumption has not grown as rapidly as it might have, it also means that this recovery is not (unlike the previous one) being built on borrowed money. Household debt levels have fallen dramatically over the past two years (see the chart below), and while arguably still higher than they should be, the fact that households have been reducing their debt in a pretty determined way suggests that households will be able to increase, and sustainably increase, their spending in 2011 and beyond as incomes grow faster.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-wp7S5e6nq84/TVnISlF8NlI/AAAAAAAAAYU/geat1AK9I3M/s1600/recovery%2B2.PNG"><img border="0" alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-wp7S5e6nq84/TVnISlF8NlI/AAAAAAAAAYU/geat1AK9I3M/s400/recovery%2B2.PNG"></a><br />Yes, all in all, I think there are some very nice things to like about this recovery. Now we just need it to set to creating new jobs in a serious way. But based on the strong foundations on which this recovery is being built, I think it won’t be much longer before we see meaningful falls in unemployment levels in the US.</p>
<p>I must say: after being very bearish on the US economy through all of the 2000s (and particularly during my previous stint writing for Angry Bear, 2003-06), it’s nice to finally have something hopeful to write about this surprisingly alluring recovery&#8230;</p>

<p>Concerned about the cause of the Dow?  Not to fear.  Many have been working on it such as <a href="http://www.salon.com/opinion/greenwald/2008/10/13/obama/index.html">Glenn Greenwald</a>.The market does not like someone who is not like them so goes the Mc Cain clan.  It is possible, but then Glenn asks for proof and finds <a href="http://godly-fumigation.blogspot.com/2008/10/lies-damned-lies-and-statistics.html">an economist</a> of his nature who has discovered it is all due to McCain!

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>by divorced one like Bush<br />Update below.</p>
<p>The other day, reading the comments got me thinking about the relationship of peoples income vs their presidential candidate choice.  I think it was about how the economy is doing.  Well, we all say it is bad because all these big, humongous finance institutions are having troubles.  But, my perspective is that the economy is about you and me.  It exists for us.  But, not much is being looked at from that perspective, except for the home mortgage sector.   Simultaneously we hear how we (you, me and thee) have to learn to save more while being asked what can be done to revive the consumer economy.  You know, get it back to the good old days.  Yes-er-y, that&#8217;s a solvable puzzle.  Which good old days do they want to recreate?  The saving days or the consuming days?  If they want both, I would say ok, but we will have to reverse the income shift.</p>
<p>Anyway, I decided to see if I could create a movement to focus the issue of the economy back onto how you  and me are doing.  It&#8217;s a monumental task, but I&#8217;m game.  I&#8217;ve gotten a little help from McCain in that he has tied the fundamentals of the economy to you and me, the American Worker (stand up and salute!).  As much as &#8220;fundamentals&#8221; are not considered the worker, the reality is we the citizens are the fundament factor in an economy.  No you and me, no exchange of valuable stuff.</p>
<p>So, I have created a chart because I don&#8217;t know how to produce one of those neat colored USA maps of all 50 states, their unemployment rate, hourly wage, 1 yr change of wage, hours worked and 1 yr change of hours worked.  The <a href="http://www.bls.gov/sae/saeaepp.htm">data is from here</a>.  I then color coded the state name based on the <a href="http://www.pollster.com/polls/2008president/">polling map</a> as of 9/16/08.<br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_ea3-LcbrX8A/SNFKNsw_PrI/AAAAAAAAAIc/X_0trekNJNI/s1600-h/State+wage,+hrs+worked,+President+Candidate.JPG"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_ea3-LcbrX8A/SNFKNsw_PrI/AAAAAAAAAIc/X_0trekNJNI/s400/State+wage,+hrs+worked,+President+Candidate.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a><br />How do you like it?  I&#8217;m rather proud of my self.</p>
<p>The color for the states are blue, light blue, red, light red and black.  I assume the red/blue shades are obvious.  The black are toss-up states.  The data in blue are numbers that did worse than average for the variable to the detriment of the citizen.  If the unemployment was higher than average, it is blue.  If the wage change and hourly wage  was less than average it is blue.  Those in red are negative.  The hours worked and change in hours worked greater than average are in blue.  I view having to work more a negative.  I do not want to have to continually increase my time in the rat race.  Though, some I&#8217;m sure would look at the opportunity to work more as a positive.  You get to earn more.  Well that&#8217;s relative to your opinion of what your free time is worth.  One state has green&#8230;Utah.  It&#8217;s hourly wage and work hours have gone down.  But, hey the unemployment rate is very low.</p>
<p>There are 8 undecided, 18 blue or leaning blue and 24 red or leaning red.<br />14 of 23 states with unemployment below average are voting or tending to vote McCain.   Three undecided have lower rates.   8  states of the 23 are voting or tending to vote Obama.   61% red and 44% blue are below the average unemployment.  </p>
<p>12 of 22 states with above average hours worked increase are red or leaning that way.  8 of are blue.  <br />6 of the 12 state with negative increases in hours worked are red, 4 are undecided which leave 2 blue.  </p>
<p>9 of 26 states that saw negative, zero or less than average 1 year hourly wage increases are red or leaning such.  7 are undecided and 10 are blue or leaning such.   3 of the 6 states with negative hourly wage growth are red, one is undecided and one is blue.  </p>
<p>21 states of 30 who have an average hourly wage less than the national average are red or leaning that way.  5 are blue or leaning such and 4 are undecided.  </p>
<p>18 of the 24 states that work more than the national weekly average hours are red or leaning such.  3 are undecided and 3 are blue.  </p>
<p>6 of 9 states who are working more than the average work week and did not see their wage increase the average amount are red or leaning red.  2 are undecided and 1 is blue.  2 states saw their hourly wage go down and their hours worked go up, both are red.  </p>
<p>Ok, so what are we to make of the voting your pocketbook thought?</p>
<p>Update: Ran some numbers.  Red states average $19.41/hr and 35.73 hours per week for a gross pay of $693.52.  Blue states average $22.68/hr and 34.38 hours per week for a gross pay of $779.74.  Earn more, work less.  Now that is the way to get out of the rat race!</p>
