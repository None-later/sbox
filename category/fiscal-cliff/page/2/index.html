<p>More on the Threat to Social Security and Medicare from the so-called &#8220;Fiscal Cliff&#8221;</p>
<p>In several posts recently I have discussed the harmful demands the right is engaging in related to the so-called &#8220;fiscal cliff&#8221; created by the original Bush tax cuts (set to sunset en masse), the artificial debt ceiling (used by the GOP to exact promises of spending cuts during a recession along with extension of unneeded tax cuts for the rich), and the ill-conceived notion that the U.S. military should continue to be funded at dangerously high levels that (i) ensure that the military-industrial complex will find a war or quasi-war in which to engage their newest toys while (ii) sucking resources from public infrastructure projects and education that are vitally needed to sustain our economy.  See, e.g., <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/11/the-gop-extortion-demands-cut-social.html">The GOP&#8217;s extortion demands: cut Social Security or we&#8217;ll shoot</a>;<br /><a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/11/if-dems-got-backbone.html">If the Dems got backbone</a>;   <br /><a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/11/is-it-fiscal-cliff-or-merely-bump-in.html">Is it a fiscal cliff or merely a bump in the road</a>;  <br /><a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/11/calling-all-americans-we-face-crisis.html">We face an &#8216;austerity crisis&#8217; not a &#8216;fiscal cliff</a>. </p>
<p>A. <strong>The Explanation.</strong><br /><strong><br /></strong> At least the national media and a slew of bloggers are beginning to provide some background information to ordinary Americans on just what is driving the national discussion of &#8220;fiscal cliffs&#8221; and &#8220;austerity&#8221; demands.  See, e.g., Richard Rubin &#038; Heidi Przybyla, <em>Tax Pledges Confound Math as Obama Seeks Deal with Republicans</em>, Bloomberg.com (Nov. 16, 2012) (noting that &#8220;The $607 billion fiscal cliff is the combination of tax increases and spending cuts that will take effect in January if Congress doesn’t act&#8221; and characterizing the positions of the parties as follows: &#8220;Republicans want to extend expiring tax cuts for all income levels and are demanding an overhaul in 2013 of entitlement programs and the tax code&#8221; while &#8220;Obama wants $1.6 trillion in higher taxes for top earners over the next decade, achieved through a combination of limits on breaks and higher tax rates on ordinary income, capital gains, dividends and estates&#8221;); Jackie Calmes, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/16/us/politics/the-fiscal-cliff-explained.html">Demystifying the Fiscal Impasse that is Vexing Washington</a>, New York Times (Nov. 16, 2012), at A19 (the online article is dated Nov. 15). </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>[A] slew of tax cuts — $400 billion for 2013 — expire on Dec. 31: All of the Bush-era rate reductions; smaller tax cuts that periodically expire for businesses and individuals; and the 2-percentage-point cut in payroll taxes that Mr. Obama pushed in 2010&#8230;.  Also, 28 million taxpayers — about one in five, all middle- to upper-income — would have to pay the alternative minimum tax in 2012&#8230;. That is because Congress has failed to pass an inflation adjustment&#8230;.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>An emergency unemployment-compensation program is expiring, which would save $26 billion but end payments to millions of Americans who remain jobless and have exhausted state tax benefits.<br />Medicare payments to doctors would be reduced 27 percent, or $11 billion, because this year Congress has not passed the usual so-called &#8216;doc fix&#8217; to block the cuts&#8230;.</p>
<p>The biggest cut would be $65 billion, enacted across the board for most federal programs over the last nine months of fiscal year 2013, from January through September.  This cut, known as the sequester, was mandated by an August 2011 budget deal between [President] Obama and Congress that ended [the GOP] standoff over raising the nation&#8217;s debt limit.   <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/16/us/politics/the-fiscal-cliff-explained.html">Demystifying the Fiscal Impasse that is Vexing Washington</a><br />It is surely accurate that our still-weak economy would do better if we do not hit it too hard with decreases in government spending&#8211;especially decreases to government spending that supports the most vulnerable amongst us who need unemployment support in order to provide the basic necessities.  Similarly, it is surely true that some of the Bush tax cuts and the Obama payroll tax reduction are still vitally important to those in the lower 60% or so of the income distribution because of the slow growth in the economy.  We will want to find some resolution to the situation that accommodates the need to avoid a harmful austerity approach.<br />So the Times&#8217; explanation of the components of the so-called &#8220;fiscal cliff&#8221; is okay.  And it is reasonable in noting that the situation is currently &#8220;vexing&#8221; to Washington.  Similarly, the Bloomberg article succinctly characterizes the clear poles of the Democratic and Republican positions&#8211;a Democratic insistence on higher taxes paid by the rich, and a Republican insistence on so-called &#8220;tax reform&#8221; and spending cuts, aimed in particular at the earned benefit and safety net programs of Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. </p>
<p>B. <strong>A Grand Bargain or a Devil&#8217;s Bargain&#8211;How the Heck Did Social Security Even Get In the Picture?</strong><br /><strong><br /></strong> Where the Times article fails is in its discussion of the &#8220;reasons&#8221;  for excessive worry about the &#8220;fiscal cliff&#8221; (if one can really call the GOP recalcitrance to immediately pass an extension of at least a good portion of the Bush tax cuts for individual taxpayers in the true middle class any form of reason).  <br />The Times article asserts that the &#8220;main disagreement&#8221; between Dems and Republicans is merely the question of extending the Bush tax rates for the top 2 percent of taxpayers.  That is a considerable understatement, one that results in part from the way the media reduces complex issues to easily retained soundbites, in that it ignores the considerable disagreement about whether and to what extent there should be any changes at all to the various earned benefit programs. </p>
<p>The  article author appears to operate on an unstated assumption that because President Obama seemed ready to trade off changes in Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid benefits for higher taxes on the very richest of the rich in August of 2011, he will still enter into such a &#8220;Grand Bargain&#8221; to avoid the so-called &#8220;fiscal cliff.&#8221;  Progressives hope, at least, that Obama will not fall prey to those same conclusions: <strong>Obama is now in a position of considerable leverage, and he must recognize that he cannot allow the Democrats to be extorted into a Devil&#8217;s Bargain to reduce Social Security, Medicaid, and Medicare benefits in exchange for the pittance of slightly higher taxes on the upper crust.</strong><br />The article goes even further astray at the end with its label of a &#8220;two-part deal&#8221; as the &#8220;best-case outcome&#8221;.  It claims that &#8220;[m]any budget experts and economists are hoping for a two-part deal.  The first part would extend many of the tax cuts and repeal the automatic spending cuts to avert the changes scheduled after Jan. 1.  But it would be contingent on the second part: a framework for reducing projected long-term deficits by overhauling both the tax code&#8211;to raise revenues&#8211;and entitlement programs&#8211;chiefly Medicare and Medicaid, whose rising costs in an aging population are unsustainable.&#8221;  Id.</p>
<p>Of course, here the &#8220;many&#8221; is simply put out there without any context, so one can&#8217;t challenge the statement as accurate or inaccurate.  The right-wing has a stable of market fundamentalist economists who want to see earned benefit programs reduced, and there are certainly the Blue-Dog Dems and a number of others (like the Bowles Simpson group) who go along with that with little questioning of the ultimate negative impact on quality of life and decency of those determinations.  Overall, <strong>there is considerable parroting of the right-wing rhetoric that suggests that these vitally important programs have to be overhauled, rather than recognizing that it is the factors that lead to ever-increasing costs for medical care in the United States that must be addressed.</strong>  And it mistakenly suggests that there is a consensus in that regard. This is a perfect example of the way today&#8217;s journalists buy into the rhetoric that is promoted (at great expense) without questioning the fundamental presuppositions underlying it.  In fact, <strong>the sequester deal did not touch Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid because there was no consensus that these programs should be reduced.  And the election results demonstrate that there is no consensus now that these program benefits must be reduced, though there is likely a consensus that health care costs in this country are increasing well beyond what is reasonable</strong>.  It is absolutely critical that the distinction be made.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s take these issues into consideration here.</p>
<p>C. <strong>Thinking about the two key components of the so-called &#8220;fiscal cliff&#8221;&#8211;tax cuts and spending cuts</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>1. The Bush tax cuts, job creators, and uncertainty</strong><br /><strong><br /></strong> The right has, not unexpectedly, argued that not extending all of the tax cuts&#8211;including those that amount to significant dollars for the wealthiest upper crust&#8211;will create a dire situation since, the right argues, the wealthy are the &#8220;job creators&#8221;.  There is no empirical evidence supporting the idea that tax cuts for the upper crust do anything to create jobs: most jobs are created by small businesses, and those with incomes above $250,000 make up only about 3% of small businesses. </p>
<p>Others argue that the uncertainty of letting the Bush tax cuts expire on December 31 is itself a dire blow to the economy.  But in the same breath, the media and most members of the Democratic and Republican parties acknowledge that they do not disagree on the need to extend the tax cuts for the middle income group at this time&#8211;the Democrats because they recognize that the tax cuts are still needed at a time of continuing slow growth out of the Great Recession caused by the profligate regulatory and tax policies of the Bush years, and the GOP because they recognize that they have no opportunity for an electoral majority if they continue to ignore the middle class. </p>
<p>Thus,  <strong>savvy political advisers note that allowing the Bush tax cuts to expire and then enacting judiciously selected tax cuts targeted at the middle class (perhaps similar to the Bush tax cuts for the lower income groups or perhaps more carefully selected and without the many corporate tax giveaways) are fairly sure things, so that the arguments from uncertainty reduce to the same-old right-wing scare tactics.</strong><br /><strong><br /></strong> <strong>2. The sequester, military spending, health care costs, and the importance of Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid</strong><br /><strong><br /></strong> Some conclude that neither side wants the sequester, with its domestic spending cuts and military cost-cutting, to go into place.  This, too, may be incorrect and overly simplistic. </p>
<p>Many progressives recognized that we have a substantial imbalance in spending, in which we neglect public infrastructure (roads, bridges, public transportation especially rail and inter-and intra-city rail) and human capital development (funding for public education and for basic research) while pushing money at the military-industrial complex.  The latter step merely encourages the military to find ways to use the military investment it makes&#8211;i.e., more money essentially fosters war-mongering simply by providing plenty of the tools to carry it out through exorbitant expenditures on the military.  <strong>Letting the sequester take place is probably the only way that our dysfunctional Congress&#8211;with far-right-wing/Tea Party dominance in the House and the minority-control rule through the filibuster in the Senate&#8211;will be able to undo the disastrous emphasis on military spending above everything else that began with Reaganomics.</strong><br />Accordingly, a better course might be to let the sequester take hold, too, and then selectively undo cuts that jeopardize sound government&#8211;such as cuts to research, centers for disease control, public transportation, public infrastructure, education, and funding of public pension obligations.  Surely the right recognizes that Americans are not happy when lax regulation results in deaths from medical care because Congress was lobbied out of regulating compounding pharmacies or deaths from bridge collapse because Congress refused to spend sufficiently on upgrading our antique transportation infrastructure or continually falling behind in research on Alzheimers and cancer and the many other modern afflictions because Congress has been so stingy with federal funds supporting basic research at our research universities.</p>
<p>OF course, we know from the election that today&#8217;s GOP sees no problem with cuts to various domestic programs that the Dems (and many ordinary Americans) hold dear&#8211;the right&#8217;s admitted goal since Reagan has been to reduce the size of government, on the ill-founded belief in market fundamentalism that private markets can do everything better.  </p>
<p>But we have years of evidence that disproves that belief, and progressives must start publicizing the absurdity of the right&#8217;s claims about market fundamentalism and the right&#8217;s denials about basic scientific theory.  Climate change is real, and investments will be required to protect our great cities.  Social Security is not bankrupt, and there is no reason that it cannot continue for years (even indefinitely) without reducing benefits.  Markets like medical care simply don&#8217;t work without governmental intervention because Big Pharma, Big Insurance, and Big Med (especially for-profit hospitals, nursing homes but also too highly compensated doctors combined with too lowly compensated aides and other assistants) exercise near-monolithic control of access and pricing, rendering the health care &#8220;market&#8221; dysfunctional, and government intervention will be required to create health-care delivery systems that serve the people. </p>
<p>(Even those who ascribe to Milt Friedman&#8217;s views of how markets work&#8211;views which in my view are based on unrealistic and overly simplistic assumptions that leave out most of the truth of human behavior in order to arrive at neatly mathematical formulas&#8211;recognize problems with the health care market where physicians operate in a structure of monopolistic competition.  In <em>Capitalism and Freedom</em>, Friedman noted that state licensing acts as a barrier to entry that gives physicians considerable market control, thus resulting in rent profits.  Friedman&#8217;s market fundamentalism solution would be to allow anyone to practice medicine without a license, thus creating consumer &#8220;choice.&#8221;  Query whether anyone without considerable wealth would actually prefer a return to those &#8220;quack&#8221; days of frontier medicine where such a market existed or would rather have a version of today&#8217;s regulated system of health care professionals with both affordability and competence. I argue that the latter is both preferable and attainable.  See below.)</p>
<p>The following provides some of the factual evidence for the importance of government intervention in the medical care market&#8211;European and Canadian health care, which are generally forms of government single-payer or single-payer/single-provider care, and Medicare, which is a form of government single-payer care, are both considerably less costly and substantially more universal in coverage than the standard, private market U.S. medical care model.   See, e.g., the OECD&#8217;s comparative statistics on medical care provision in the US compared to OECD countries and Canada, available <a href="http://www.oecd.org/document/16/0,3343,en_2649_34631_2085200_1_1_1_1,00.html">here</a> (see statistical spreadsheet <a href="http://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=SHA">here</a>).</p>

<p>The central problem of our economy is widening inequality. It&#8217;s reducing the purchasing power of the vast middle class on which job growth depends, and turning the economy into a speculative casino for multimillionaires and billionaires.  It&#8217;s also undermining our ability to turn the economy around, as those millionaires and billionaires subsidize politicians who refuse to raise taxes on the wealthy and seek to cut spending critical to the middle class and the poor.  Robert Reich, <a href="http://www.salon.com/2012/11/15/stop_income_inequality/?source=newsletter">Stop income inequality!</a>, Salon.com (Nov. 15, 2012) (formatting changed).</p>
<p>The more I think about this, the more I am convinced that, as Kenneth Thomas says, <em>Democrats Should Just Sit Back and Ride Over the Fiscal Cliff </em>(in a post at Middle Class Political Economist, republished on BusinessInsider.com, <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/what-the-fiscal-cliff-means-for-the-middle-class-2012-11">here</a>) and Angry Bear <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/11/what-fiscal-cliff-means-for-middle-class.html">here</a>. </p>
<p>[The fiscal cliff] is the combination of spending cuts and tax increases set to take place on January 1 based on several different laws.  Estimates of the consequences run as high as <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/rickungar/2012/11/10/the-fiscal-cliff-explained/2/">$800 billion</a> next year, or 5.2% of the country&#8217;s<a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2001rank.html">$15.29 trillion gross domestic product</a> in 2011.  Yes, that would mean a recession, with obvious consequences for the middle class.  But this is only true if we did nothing after January 1, and that&#8217;s not going to happen.  Id.</p>

<p> What the Fiscal Cliff Means for the Middle Class</p>
<p> Now that the election is over, it seems like all the politicians and pundits can talk about is the so-called &#8220;fiscal cliff.&#8221; But the chatter around the fiscal cliff is deeply weird, so in this post I will explain what it is and what the issues involved mean for the middle class.<br />   <br />Just what is the fiscal cliff? It is the combination of spending cuts and tax increases set to take place on January 1 based on several different laws. Estimates of the consequences run as high as <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/rickungar/2012/11/10/the-fiscal-cliff-explained/2/">$800 billion</a> next year, or 5.2% of the country&#8217;s <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2001rank.html">$15.29 trillion gross domestic product</a> in 2011. Yes, that would mean a recession, with obvious consequences for the middle class. But this is only true if we did nothing after January 1, and that&#8217;s not going to happen.<br />    <br />To put it another way, $800 billion is a 72.7% cut in the government&#8217;s <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/13/business/federal-deficit-for-2012-fiscal-year-falls-to-1-1-trillion.html?_r=0">budget deficit</a> for the just ended 2012 fiscal year. You would think this would make the people calling for an immediate cut in the deficit happy, but nooooo. <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/11/squirming-hawks/">Just the opposite</a>, which is the weirdest aspect of the entire debate. I&#8217;ll come back to that in a minute; first, let&#8217;s look at the main components of the fiscal cliff.<br />    <br />The biggest chunk is $426 billion from the final expiration of the Bush tax cuts, according to a <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-07-13/republican-tax-cut-costs-much-more-than-obama-s-bgov-barometer.html">Bloomberg analysis</a> in July. Of this, $358 billion is for the first $250,000 of all taxpayers&#8217; earnings, and the remaining $68 billion is for the tax cuts for income above $250,000 ($200,000 for a single person) that President Obama wants to get rid of. Both Republicans and Democrats want to retain the tax break for 98% of households, but Republicans will try to hold it hostage to the cuts for the other 2%. Since the Bush tax cuts expire if nothing gets done (because they were originally passed through the Senate&#8217;s reconciliation procedure, which gave them a 10-year lifespan; then renewed for 2 years in 2010), on January 1 the Republicans will have no more leverage on this. Thus, I expect that the middle class tax cuts will be made permanent and, by early January at the latest, the $68 billion will be all that will have expired. Since the wealthy spend less of their income than do the middle class or poor, this tax increase will have little contractionary effect on the economy.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a>   <br />Another set of tax provision affecting couples with over $250,000 and individuals over $200,000 is contained in the Affordable Care Act. These folks will have to pay an extra 0.9% tax on earnings over the thresholds for Medicare, and an extra 3.8% on investment income, starting in 2013. According to an <a href="http://www.jacksonfreepress.com/news/2012/aug/10/affordable-care-act-tax-increases-are-coming-who-p/">Associated Press estimate</a>, this will raise $318 billion over 10 years, so we&#8217;ll call it $30 billion for 2013. Since this is part of the funding for Obamacare, the President is highly unlikely to budge on this. Again, as a tax hike on the top 2%, it will have relatively little contractionary effect.<br />    <br />There are $110 billion in automatic spending cuts scheduled in 2013 due to the so-called &#8220;sequester.&#8221; These were triggered last year when <a href="http://middleclasspoliticaleconomist.blogspot.com/2011/08/how-bad-was-debt-deal-for-middle-class.html">no deal was made</a> on long-term deficit reduction. With unemployment still at 7.9%, government spending cuts are definitely harmful to the middle class. To the extent that the $55 billion cut from the defense budget comes from overseas spending, there will be little contractionary effect in this country. That is, if we closed a military base in Germany, it would have more of an effect there than here. In any event, since the United States spends 41% of the world&#8217;s total military expenditure,* we could afford to redirect quite a bit of this $711 billion annual expenditure (China is a very distant second at $143 billion) to other uses. Nation building at home, as the saying goes.<br />    <br />The other $55 billion would come from domestic discretionary spending, so the middle class would bear the full brunt of this. Of course, neither party wants to see &#8220;their&#8221; favorite budget items cut, so there is a good chance that these spending cuts will be delayed, which would be a good thing, though not as good as shifting some military spending into the domestic budget.<br />    <br />There&#8217;s more, of course, but the basic outline is clear: we are seeing a replay of last year&#8217;s debt ceiling &#8220;deal,&#8221; in which Republicans are trying to pass austerity measures the public does not support and did not vote for in the just concluded election. Indeed, a majority voted not just for a Democratic President and a Democratic Senate, but for a Democratic House of Representatives as well, with Republicans maintaining a majority only due to <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2012/11/07/1159631/americans-voted-for-a-democratic-house-gerrymandering-the-supreme-court-gave-them-speaker-boehner/?mobile=nc">gerrymandering</a> and compliant Republican courts. As <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/11/squirming-hawks/">Paul Krugman points out</a>, the self-proclaimed &#8220;fiscal hawks&#8221; are tying themselves up in knots on why going over the cliff is bad when it achieves their goal of debt reduction. The answer, of course, is that they want to cut &#8220;low-priority spending,&#8221; by which they mean programs benefiting the middle class. As <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/11/if-dems-got-backbone.html">Linda Beale argues</a>, the right course for Democrats is to do nothing until January, when the Bush tax cuts will be gone and we can pass tax cuts more targeted to the middle class as well as redirecting spending from our bloated military to domestic programs.<br />    <br />* Source: SIPRI (Stockholm International Peace Research Institute) Military Expenditure Database 2011, <a href="http://milexdata.sipri.org/">http://milexdata.sipri.org</a><br /><a href="http://middleclasspoliticaleconomist.blogspot.com/2012/11/what-fiscal-cliff-means-for-middle-class.html">http://middleclasspoliticaleconomist.blogspot.com/2012/11/what-fiscal-cliff-means-for-middle-class.html</a></p>

<p>        &#8230; <br />
<blockquote>Few expect Washington to replicate the scope of the Bowles-Simpson plan. Though it is widely praised, its $4 trillion in 10-year savings includes major changes to Social Security opposed by liberals and an aggressive new tax code that would generate far more revenue than most conservatives could stomach.</p></blockquote>
<p>        &#8230; <br />
<blockquote>About half the new savings would come from reversing part of the massive tax cuts that, along with the collapse of tax collections during the recent recession, are a major cause of current budget problems. The rest would come from lower spending, including on Social Security and Medicare, forecast to be the biggest drivers of future borrowing.</p></blockquote>

<p>Fifty-three percent of the nation believes that if a fiscal agreement isn&#8217;t reached by New Year&#8217;s Eve, Republicans in Congress are the ones to blame, reports a new Washington Post-Pew Research Center poll. It also reports that only 38 percent believe that the president and the Republican Congress will reach a deal.</p>
<p>If those pessimists are right, then in an effort to assure a long-term deficit reduction, a series of mandatory and draconian spending cuts will jump off in less than seven weeks, coupled with the expiration of a slew of tax cuts.</p></blockquote>

<p>Elites Demanding Austerity Also Ignored Housing Bubble</p>
<p>
<blockquote><strong>… </strong>it was somewhat <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/04/books/review/the-signal-and-the-noise-by-nate-silver.html">shocking to see a book review in The New York Times by Noam Scheiber, an editor at The New Republic</a>, that longed for the day when we will have people who can use data to identify housing bubbles before they grow so large as to pose a serious danger to the economy.
<p>The personal slight is beside the point; the issue is that our elites are being allowed to construct an alternative reality that absolves them of responsibility for the ruined lives all around us. The reality is that people in positions of authority chose to ignore the evidence of a rapidly growing bubble and those trying to call attention to the dangers it posed. Instead, we have Scheiber giving us the &#8220;Who could have known?&#8221; story. His case is that the dynamics of the bubble were just too complicated for people to grasp given the tools available at the time. The people who clearly warned of the bubble, using data, simply did not exist in Scheiber&#8217;s universe.</p>
<p>If it were just Scheiber saying this on a rant somewhere, he could be easily dismissed as a crank. While he is a prominent writer on policy and politics, prominent writers say ridiculous things all the times.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />
<blockquote>But this was not just a random rant. It was a book review in The New York Times, by far the nation&#8217;s most prestigious newspaper. It is a paper that employs fact checkers and prides itself on accuracy. Would The New York Times allow a book reviewer to bemoan the fact that no one had questioned the existence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq prior to the war?
<p>And the bubble warners were not entirely below The New York Times&#8217; radar screen. In fact, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/25/weekinreview/the-nation-the-perils-of-predicting-financial-bubbles.html">several Times reporters</a> had <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/11/business/business-in-debate-over-housing-bubble-a-winner-also-loses.html">picked up</a> on <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/28/business/28home.html?pagewanted=all">warnings</a> of the housing bubble. In fact, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/16/opinion/mind-the-gap.html">Paul Krugman,</a> perhaps the most famous economist in the world, used his New York Times column in 2002 to warn of the dangers posed by the housing bubble.<br />Given this history, how can an ill-informed book reviewer get away with making what is obviously an untrue assertion in a New York Times book review? The simple answer is that Scheiber&#8217;s &#8220;Who could have known?&#8221; story is quite comforting to people with power in this country.</p>

<p>Calling all Americans: we face an &#8220;austerity crisis&#8221; not a fiscal &#8220;cliff&#8221;; we need a piecemeal solution, not a &#8220;grand bargain&#8221;</p>
<p>Keynesian economic theory is the only theory that has gotten much of what&#8217;s gone on in the last few decades correct, but of course the GOP market fundamentalists, in reliance on the unrealistic assumptions of most freshwater economics, still claim that all we need to do is starve the beast more, cut taxes and regulations more and economic growth will take off and take care of every problem imaginable.  In the process of trying to enact their ever-more-absurd vision of how to legislate a good economy, the GOP is prepared, once again, to be the obstructionist party of &#8220;no&#8221;, with Boehner saying no tax rate increases, Ryan claiming that Obama&#8217;s reelection (with exit polls showing majority support for tax increases on the wealthiest Americans) does not signify a mandate to increase taxes on the wealthiest Americans, and the GOP generally pushing for benefit cuts to Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security &#8211;irrelevant to the deficit and actively harmful to the livelihoods of millions of Americans and hence to the economy &#8211;as the solution of choice to the horror (in their view) of cutting military expenditures or raising taxes on the rich.</p>
<p>There may finally be some light at the end of the long, corporatist, Koch-funded, Norquist-induced &#8220;big sleep&#8221; in which too many Americans were lulled into thinking that taxes were all bad, spending was all bad unless on military, and the GOP greed-is-good; let-the-rich-keep-getting-even-richer philosophy was okay.  Alex Seitz-Wald even asks &#8220;<a href="http://www.salon.com/2012/11/14/is_it_game_over_for_grover_norquist/">Is it game over for Grover Norquist?&#8221;, </a>Salon.com (Nov. 14, 2012).  Seitz-Wald reports that Norquist has only 217 no-tax pledgers in the new House and an all-time low of only 39 in the Senate, and contrasts that with 238 House members and 41 Senators last year.  Id.  Thousands of Norquist&#8217;s political arm Americans for Tax Reform were spent on two GOP pledge signers&#8211;Ricky Gill and Lee Anderson&#8211;who were ultimately defeated.  Some who signed the pledge, such as MN Chip Cravaack (who lost) recognized too late that giving away your responsibility to think was an act of political suicide.  Even Senators Graham and McCain have suggested that the time of adhering to a no-taxes-ever pledge has passed, and Jeb Bush, the family&#8217;s current presidential aspirant, says he doesn&#8217;t believe in &#8220;outsourc[ing] your principles and convictions to people.&#8221;  Id.  Even Boehner, after all, has admitted he could support limiting deductions as a way to get more taxes from the rich, even if he won&#8217;t yet say he will agree to tax rate increases.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Robert Reich notes that the apparent GOP willingness to allow some tax increases through &#8220;base broadening&#8221; should be looked at squarely for what it really is&#8211;not generally a way to ensure that the rich pay more and that the poor and middle class continue to get appropriate breaks on their taxes to avoid a renewed recession.  See Robert Reich, <a href="http://www.salon.com/2012/11/14/so_much_for_grand_bargains/">So much for &#8216;grand bargains&#8217;</a>, Salon.com (Nov. 14, 2012).</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8216;Broadening the base&#8217; has nothing whatever to do with the rich paying more.  That&#8217;s because a lot of tax credits and deductions help the middle class and the poor.  If we end the Earned INcome Tax Credit, for example, some of the poorest Americans weill end up sacrificing.  That tab was $63 billion last year.  Or if the &#8216;loophole&#8217; is tax-free employee health care, or the home mortgage tax deduction, or tax-deferred 401k accounts, most of the added tax revenues will come out of the pockets of the middle class.  So when Republicans talk about &#8216;broadening the base&#8217;, watch your wallets. Id.</p></blockquote>
<p>Instead of cutting these types of loopholes that are beneficial to the middle and lower income classes, Reich suggests that Congress take aim definitively at the lairs of tax loopholes for the rich.<br />If Republicans won&#8217;t budge on raising tax rates but insist on broadening the base, Democrats should take aim at the biggest tax loophole of all for America&#8217;s wealthy: the preference for capital gains.  Id.<br />Krugman in his blog, <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/14/the-austerity-bomb/?smid=tw-NytimesKrugman&#038;seid=auto">An Austerity Bomb </a>(Nov. 14, 2012) argues that we&#8217;ve again allowed the extremists on the right to set the tone of the dialogue by letting them label the current situation.  We aren&#8217;t facing a &#8220;fiscal cliff&#8221;, he notes, but rather an &#8220;austerity bomb&#8221;. </p>

<p>Is it a fiscal cliff or merely a bump in the road?</p>
<p>Sixty percent of American voters in exit polls indicated that they supported higher taxes for the wealthy, see <a href="http://democrats.senate.gov/2012/11/08/on-taxes-the-voters-have-spoken/">here</a>.  Even some arch conservatives are acknowledging that some tax increases won&#8217;t do terrible harm.  Id. (noting that the Wall Street Journal&#8217;s Stephen Moore acknowledged that Obama &#8220;can claim that he&#8217;s got a voter mandate to do that [raise taxes on the rich].&#8221; Even Conservative Weekly Standard Editor Bill Kristol counseled Republican leadership to get real.</p>
<p>You know what? It won&#8217;t kill the country if Republicans raise taxes a littlbe bit on millionaires.  It really won&#8217;t, I don&#8217;t think.  &#8230;  Really? The Republican party is gonna fall on its sword to defend a bunch of millionaires, half of whom voted Democratic, and half of whom live in Hollywood and are hostile to Republicans?  Nicole Flatow, <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2012/11/11/1176641/weekly-standard-editor-bill-kristol-raising-millionaires-taxes-wont-kill-the-country/?utm_source=PolicyMic+Newsletter&#038;utm_campaign=1172c11df5-New_Newsletter2_29_2012&#038;utm_medium=email&#038;mobile=nc">Weekly Standard Editor Bill Kristol: Raising Millionaires&#8217; Taxes &#8216;Won&#8217;t Kill the Country&#8217;</a>, ThinkProgress (Nov. 11, 2012).</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the House and Senate Republican leadership (Rep. Boehner and Sen. McConnell) are insisting that they will not allow tax rates to rise.   McConnell told Breitbart.com the following:<br />
<blockquote><strong>One issue I’ve never been conflicted about is taxes. I wasn’t sent to Washington to raise anybody’s taxes to pay for more wasteful spending and this election doesn’t change my principles.</strong> This election was a disappointment, without doubt, but let’s be clear about something: <strong>the House is still run by Republicans, and Republicans still maintain a robust minority in the Senate. </strong>I know some people out there think Tuesday’s results mean Republicans in Washington are now going to roll over and agree to Democrat demands that we hike tax rates before the end of the year.<strong> I’m here to tell them there is no truth to that notion whatsoever</strong>.  Annie-Rose Strasser, <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2012/11/09/1169451/mcconnell-no-taxes/">Senate Minority Leader: We Won&#8217;t Raise Taxes At All</a>, ThinkProgress (Nov. 9, 2012).</p></blockquote>
<p>President Obama Friday invited Congress to sign off on a tax cut for the middle class right away&#8211; noting that just extending the Bush tax cuts for those who make less than $250,000 would give a tax cut to 98 percent of Americans and 97 percent of small businesses. </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>“While there may be disagreements in Congress over whether to raise taxes on people making *over* $250,000 a year, nobody — not Republicans, not Democrats — want taxes to go up for folks making under $250,000 a year,” Obama said. “So let’s not wait.”  Adele M. Stan, <a href="http://www.salon.com/2012/11/10/obama_throws_down_gauntlet_on_fiscal_cliff/">Obama throws down gauntlet on fiscal cliff</a>, Salon.com (Nov. 10, 2012).</p>
<p>Robert Reich, now at the University of California at Berkeley, writes that the game of chicken is on.<br />So who blinks first? Democrats who don’t mind going over the cliff because they’ll get a better final deal – and the deal will be retroactive to January 1<sup>st</sup> so it’s not really a cliff at all but more like a little hill? Or Republicans who want to extend the Bush tax cuts beyond January 1<sup>st</sup>, until we get sufficiently close to the debt ceiling that they can once again threaten the full faith and credit of America?</p>
<p>As I said before, I had naively assumed the election would put an end to these games, but obviously not. Yet Obama and the Democrats are holding most of the cards now. Let’s hope they use them.  Robert Reich, <a href="http://www.salon.com/2012/11/09/get_ready_for_an_economic_game_of_chicken/?source=newsletter">Get ready for an economic game of chicken</a>, Salon.com (Nov. 9, 2012).</p>

<p>I was going to list representative links but gave up&#8230;I leave it to readers to supply their own sources for this post.</p>
<p>The issue has been framed as mostly an ideological and partisan battle, with a life of its own separate from any technical, economic, or financial consequences from reasonably competent &#8220;analysts&#8221;.</p>
<p>The fear is so great that the public wants an answer regardless of the details.  (Notice that talking point sounds familiar).</p>
<p>There are are usually only two parts to the problem, </p>
<p>1. Unspecified tax changes, often lumped under loopholesandexemptions.</p>
<p>2. Sociasecuritymedicare are now the only drivers that matter to the cliff.</p>
<p>repeated and repeated and until it feels like simple cut and paste from the articles I have read&#8230;.and often buried in the middle somewhere of the text.</p>
<p>who are the people who want a cut and pasted solution?  </p>

<p>Will the Reign of Witches end January 1st?<br />(hat tip to Maggie Mahar at Health Beat blog)<br />
<blockquote>A little patience,&#8221; Jefferson wrote, &#8220;and we shall see the reign of witches pass over, their spells dissolved, and the people recovering their true sight, restoring their government to its true principles. It is true, that in the meantime, we are suffering deeply in spirit, and incurring the horrors of a war, and long oppressions of enormous public debt. &#8230; If the game runs sometimes against us at home, we must have patience till luck turns, and then we shall have an opportunity of winning back the principles we have lost. For this is a game where principles are the stake.</p></blockquote>
<p>Thomas Jefferson in writing to John Taylor after discussing Mr. Martin&#8217;s patent.</p>
<p>Jefferson complains of President Adams, the Federalists, and the Sedition Act which was used to quiet dissent and criticism. Our present situation allows a Republican minority led by their leaders John Boehner and Mitch McConnell to hold the nation hostage to the terror of cuts in domestic programs and defense in January after failing to compromise with the President on tax increases and spending cuts. In answer to the obstructionists, what if the second term President Barack Obama let the cards fall where they may and the cuts happen? Peter Orszag suggests it may not be so terrible to allow the nation to temporarily drive off the fiscal cliff to break the backs of the Republican party whose only weapon is to hold hostage the nation’s economy. Perhaps the newly elected president could have a plan to bring to an end the obstructionism of the Republicans whose sole goal was to keep Obama from being re-elected.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Jonathan Chait suggests there may be such a plan to end the reign of witches.  November 7th</p>
<p>
<blockquote>Obama does have a plan to break the legislative impasse and settle the long-term struggle over the scope of government. It does not rest on the GOP’s coming to its senses and thinking of the national good. The plan is the very opposite of naïve. And he can put it into effect even more quickly than Romney could enact his own plan. Here is how it will happen. On the morning of November 7, a reelected President Obama will do … nothing. For the next 53 days, nothing. And then, on January 1, 2013, we will all awake to a different, substantially more liberal country. The Bush tax cuts will have disappeared, restoring Clinton-era tax rates and flooding government coffers with revenue to fund its current operations for years to come. The military will be facing dire budget cuts that shake the military-industrial complex to its core. It will be a real-world approximation of the old liberal bumper-sticker fantasy in which schools have all the money they require and the Pentagon needs to hold a bake sale.</p></blockquote>
<p>Allow the program cuts to take place, the tax breaks to end, and place the Republicans in their own predicament. He could then go back and restore the middle lower income tax breaks and domestic program funding. What Republican will deny a tax cut to its primary constituency and the restoration of funds to the third rail of Social Security and Medicare?  Medicaid the program of choice for most of the middle income in going into Nursing Home care would not be far behind. Having opposed any compromise over the last two years with the objective of denying President Obama the presidency in 2012, the Republicans may have spent their powder in opposition and also in flexibility to compromise and in turn becoming a hostage to their own divisiveness. Lobbyists and executives are already pushing the Republicans to seek an agreement on tax increases and spending cuts. McCain and Lindsay have signed a letter calling for a bipartisan agreement to head off cuts to the military and defense contractors. Twixt and between . . .</p>
<p>Chait posits there is not an immediate need for a bipartisan agreement to head off the Thelma and Louise driving off the deficit precipice action of the US. With the resulting increase in taxes, revenues will swell and eventually lead to a deficit reduction allowing it to decrease to 1% of the economy and stabilize through 2022. All Obama has to do is wait and restore the programs he wishes after January 1st 2013. Of course, this begs another question.</p>
<p>Former 2008 Democrat transition lead John Podesta “does not envision Obama playing chicken with the Republicans even though the President comes off an election victory and holds the Republicans in a tight space.&#8221; <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/07/us/politics/obama-second-term-has-immediate-challenges.html%20pagewanted=all&#038;_r=0%20Question%20for%20the%20Victor;%20How%20Far%20Do%20You%20Push?">Question for the Victor; How Far Do You Push?</a></p>
<p>I guess my question is, which Obama will emerge? One who has learned bipartisanship with this crop of Republicans will not work or the Obama who will go down in history as one of the weakest presidents ever who appeases the Republicans with cuts to Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid to gain tax increases. During his campaigning, not much was heard on the domestic issues from the incumbent President until late in the campaign leaving a gap in what his positions truly were with regard to immigration, Social Security, Medicare/Medicaid, etc. creating tension amongst his followers.<br />
<blockquote>Mr. Obama seemed to address this tension in the closing speeches of his campaign. ‘I want to see more cooperation in Washington,’ he said in Mentor, Ohio. ‘But if the price of peace in Washington means slashing student aid, reversing his health care program or cutting people from Medicaid’ he added, ‘that’s not a price I’ll pay.’</p></blockquote>
<p>The next 53 days will tell us which President has taken office in the second term.</p>
