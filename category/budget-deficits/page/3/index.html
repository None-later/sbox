<p>I’ve been asked several times how I feel about the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget">president’s proposed budget</a>, and I find it hard to answer. For me, it all comes down to the following diagram:</p>
<p><a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451b33869e2014e5f4025b0970c-popup"><img title="Ss784" border="0" alt="Ss784" src="http://economistsview.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451b33869e2014e861adcda970d-800wi"></a>    <br />[Source: <a href="http://cbo.gov/ftpdocs/115xx/doc11579/06-30-LTBO.pdf">CBO</a>]</p>
<p>The main problem, as this graph from the CBO clearly shows, is rising health care costs. However, few politicians are talking about the real problem, let alone trying to find ways to solve it. So all of the budget debate we are seeing is really just tinkering around the edges of the long-run debt problem. For example, as the graph shows Social Security has little to do with our long-run budget problem, and the imbalance in this program can be fixed relatively easily. So whatever we do here it will still leave the big problem — rising health care costs — unaddressed.</p>
<p> <a name="more"></a>
<p>Until politicians start leveling with the public about the source of the budget imbalance instead of fooling them into thinking the measures they are talking about for Social Security and other programs will help to solve our long-run debt problem, we won’t make much progress. And the costs of this political strategy could be large. We could lose valuable programs — programs we can easily afford once the health care cost problem is resolved –as politicians attempt to make the public think they are making inroads on the long-run budget problem when in fact they are avoiding the real issue (and it doesn’t help at all that any attempts to control health care costs are derided as “death panels”).</p>

                                <p>In the context of <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/02/continuing-resolution-hr-1-links.html">Dan&#8217;s post below</a>, I just want to repeat <a href="http://capitalgainsandgames.com/blog/bruce-bartlett/2142/democratic-budgetary-passivity">what Bruce Bartlett said so accurately yesterday</a>:<br />
<blockquote>[H]ere&#8217;s what I would be doing if I were organizing opposition to the Republican budgetary disinformation campaign. First of all, I would be holding hearings five days a week in the Senate Appropriations Committee and every other Senate committee on the impact of proposed Republican budget cuts. Whose benefits are going to be cut? What programs will be shut down? What are the real world consequences of the Republicans&#8217; plans?</p>
<p><em>I have no idea and I have made an effort to try and find out.</em> But there are undoubtedly people who know at the Office of Management and Budget and the various departments of government that are filled with assistant secretaries eager to testify before a congressional committee and respond in detail to the implicit Republican argument that spending can be massively cut without hurting anyone.</p>
<p>Another thing I would be doing is commissioning reports by the Congressional Research Service, the Government Accountability Office, and the Congressional Budget Office to provide data and analysis on the impact of Republican plans. And believe me, any request from the chairman of the appropriations committee gets the very careful attention of those who run these organizations for obvious reasons.</p>
<p>The next obvious step is to get all of the various organizations that represent farmers, defense contractors, health providers and so on to do their own analyses based on their intimate knowledge of how spending cuts will affect them. These people will also be more than happy to testify before a congressional committee on short notice.</p>
<p>Within a couple of weeks I think it would be very easy to put flesh on the bones of the Republican plans and mobilize the millions of people who will be affected but probably have no idea at this time that this is the case because no one has told them. I think the political dynamics could change quickly. But someone needs to get the ball rolling, get the analyses started, organize the hearings and so on. Why this isn&#8217;t already being done, is a complete mystery to me. [emphasis mine]</p></blockquote>
<p>That no one has been willing or able to answer Mr. Bartlett&#8217;s question tells me all I need to know about who will be hurt by the cuts: the vast majority of the American people.  We&#8217;re not just talking the people who scheduled a trip to DC after their kid was fascinated by <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1078912/"><em>Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian</em></a>.  We&#8217;re talking the kids, their parents, and their neighbors.</p>
<p>The silence from the DSCC members is deafening. And, in more than one sense of the word, Depressing.</p>

                                <p>The Ryan Roadmap was introduced and then dropped into obscurity as Republicans simply ignored it and appararantly its author, the House Budget Committee Ranking Member Paul Ryan. Well that was then, today that is CHAIRMAN Paul Ryan and the official respondee to the SOTU plus the man who has unilateral control over budget levels this year. Not exactly &#8216;Paul Who?&#8217; any more. So in the interest of public education let&#8217;s take a little trip on Paul&#8217;s highway.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.roadmap.republicans.budget.house.gov/">A Roadmap for America&#8217;s Future: from budget.house.gov</a> and specifically its <a target="_blank" href="http://www.roadmap.republicans.budget.house.gov/Issues/Issue/?IssueID=8514">&#8216;Tax Reform&#8217;</a> page.<br />
<blockquote>Provides individual income tax payers a choice of how to pay their taxes – through existing law, or through a highly simplified code that fits on a postcard with just two rates and virtually no special tax deductions, credits, or exclusions (except the health care tax credit).<br />Simplifies tax rates to 10 percent on income up to $100,000 for joint filers, and $50,000 for single filers; and 25 percent on taxable income above these amounts. Also includes a generous standard deduction and personal exemption (totaling $39,000 for a family of four).<br />Eliminates the alternative minimum tax [AMT].<br />Promotes saving by eliminating taxes on interest, capital gains, and dividends; also eliminates the death tax.<br />Replaces the corporate income tax – currently the second highest in the industrialized world – with a border-adjustable business consumption tax of 8.5 percent. This new rate is roughly half that of the rest of the industrialized world.</p></blockquote>
<p>Billionaires don&#8217;t become such by paying themselves large salaries, it taking 100 years to earn your first billion even with a salary of $10 million a year, instead they gain that wealth by accumulating capital and taking gains on it in the form of actual capital gains as defined and interest and dividends. None of which are taxable under the roadmap. Nor are any future disbursements from their grandchildren&#8217;s Trust Funds. Tax Freedom FOREVER! Hurray!! If you chose your grandparents right. (Me? Not so much).</p>
<p>But gosh wouldn&#8217;t exempting all returns on capital from taxation blow a hole in the budget? I meant the Right spends endless time complaining that the lower 40% don&#8217;t pay taxes. Au contraire mon frere. Per CBO this is all free!! At least once they adopted the scoring rules provided them by Ryan&#8217;s staff.</p>

However, as specified by your staff, for this analysis total federal tax revenues are assumed to equal those under CBO’s alternative fiscal scenario (which is one interpretation of what it would mean to continue current fiscal policy) until they reach 19 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2030, and to remain at that share of GDP thereafter.</p></blockquote>
<p>See how easy that is!! Just tell CBO to not score the cost of your tax cuts and BINGO! Balanced budget!!! Well in year 50, but still. </p>
<p>This is the man official Washington is swooning over as being &#8220;serious&#8221;. Sorry folks Ryan and his Roadmap are frauds, more like the Tour Guide and Map to VoodooLand than anything.</p>

                                <p>This week Trichet laid down the ECB&#8217;s hand, (effectively) announcing his intention to maintain inflation at the ECB&#8217;s target rather than allow it to overshoot. For all intents and purposes, 2% inflation stabilizes the real exchange rate rather than furthering real depreciation in the Periphery and real appreciation in Germany (or the Core).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/8262685/EMU-policies-are-pushing-Southern-Europe-into-systemic-political-crisis.html">Ambrose Evans-Pritchard</a> agrees with my interpretations of Trichet&#8217;s speech:<br />
<blockquote>Mr Trichet’s fire-breathing rhetoric can be taken as a signal that the ECB will continue to run monetary policy for German needs and tastes, refusing to accommodate a little slippage on inflation to let Club Med regain lost competitiveness without having to endure the agony of debt-deflation. Indeed, the ECB seems to have picked up some of the worst habits of its mentor. </p></blockquote>
<p>Only the rebalancing of inter-euro current accounts will bring stable  fiscal finances for debtor and creditor countries alike, something made  more difficult with 2% average inflation! Trichet, in an <a href="http://www.ecb.int/press/key/date/2011/html/sp110115.en.html">interview with German newspaper, Bild.de</a>, doesn&#8217;t acknowledge this fact (bolded by RW):<br />
<blockquote>Let me be very clear: this is not a crisis of the euro. Rather, what we have is a crisis related to the public finances of a number of euro area countries. All governments have to put their finances in order, and above all those governments and countries which have lived well beyond their means in the past.</p></blockquote>
<p>Really? On the aggregate, Euro zone economies &#8216;living well beyond their means&#8217; are now doing so in two respects: the current account deficit and public deficits. They&#8217;re not the same. Don&#8217;t even start with the &#8216;twin deficit&#8217; story &#8211; <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2010/06/parenteau-marching-to-austeria-and-other-neolib-fibs.html">Rob Parenteau refuted that some time ago</a>.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />It&#8217;s not about government dissaving, per se. For countries like Spain, or any other Euro area economy with years of accumulated private sector leverage, the only way for the public sector to simultaneously reduce fiscal and private deficits is for <del> Germany </del>foreigners to dissave (foreigners run large CA deficits). (See a previous post of the <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/10/whos-saving-what-application-of-3.html">3-sector financial balances model here</a>.)</p>
<p>Given the close trade ties in the Euro zone, growing income from abroad effectively means a transfer of saving from the Eurozone Core to the Periphery via the current. This requires real appreciation in Germany, for example, and real depreciation in Spain.</p>
<p>First, real appreciation/depreciation could have been given a fighting chance with a lapse of the inflation target. Trichet made it quite clear where the ECB stands on this front: NEIN.</p>
<p>Portugal, Greece, and Spain have essentially no chance if left to their own accord.</p>
<p>Spain along with other Periphery economies are relatively &#8220;closed&#8221; compared to the German export powerhouse; that needs to change.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/TTRlVSkWziI/AAAAAAAADbo/6hkDwsRmg0U/s1600/openness_chart.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/TTRlVSkWziI/AAAAAAAADbo/6hkDwsRmg0U/s400/openness_chart.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a>The chart above illustrates the degree of openness across the Eurozone, as measured by (exports + imports) divided by GDP. Spain, Greece, Italy, and France (expected to run budget deficits the size of Spain this year) are the most &#8216;closed&#8217; of the Euro area (16, not including Estonia). In Greece, Spain, and Italy, the GDP share of export income has decreased over the last decade; furthermore, it&#8217;s imports, rather than exports, that make the larger contribution to economic openness.</p>

<p>Even if Spain was more &#8216;open&#8217;, real appreciation is ingrained in the economy, as represented by unit labor costs. Structural reform is required on many fronts, private and public.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/TTRxyYBzTUI/AAAAAAAADb4/Fl50BfZwAog/s1600/ulc.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/TTRxyYBzTUI/AAAAAAAADb4/Fl50BfZwAog/s400/ulc.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a>Since 2001, Spanish unit labor nearly doubled, +46%, while those in Germany grew just 17%. Recently, unit labor costs in Spain have stabilized. This is due to the contraction of the construction sector, which dragged productivity in recent years. Going forward, more is needed.</p>
<p>The EU made several recommendations in their 2010 Surveillance of <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/publications/european_economy/2010/pdf/ee-2010-1_en.pdf">Intra-Euro-Area Competitiveness and Imbalances</a> (pg. 78):<br />
<blockquote>Enhancing productivity in a more sustainable way would involve further investment in and enhancing the efficiency of expenditure in research, development and innovation, as well as improving the efficiency of R&#038;D expenditure are crucial for achieving productivity advances. Further improvements of the education and life-long learning systems and investment in human capital should also be envisaged. This may be achieved inter alia, by ensuring the effective, implementation of widespread education reforms in addition to upgrading the skills and increasing mobility of the labour force to promote a swift transition into employment, and reducing segmentation in the labour market.</p></blockquote>
<p>Nowhere does the report say that competitiveness should be achieved by getting public finances &#8216;in order&#8217;. In fact, I&#8217;d deduce from these comments that more, rather than less, government spending is needed.</p>
<p>Without > 2% inflation, these countries don&#8217;t stand a chance.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>I&#8217;m late to seeing this, and Bruce has probably already covered it, but Doug Elmendorg at the CBO <a href="http://cboblog.cbo.gov/?p=1726">inadvertently gives away the game</a> on the Administration&#8217;s approach to—let alone opinion of—the Social Security &#8220;Trust Fund&#8221;:<br />
<blockquote>The balances in trust funds have accrued because income associated with those programs has exceeded the expenses; when that happens, the surplus cash flow is used to finance the government’s ongoing activities, and the trust fund is credited with a corresponding amount of Treasury securities. Although trust funds have an important legal meaning, <em>in that they may constrain the amount a program can spend</em>, they are essentially an accounting mechanism and <em>have little relevance in an economic or budgetary sense</em>. The value of Treasury securities held by trust funds and other government accounts measures only some of the commitments the government has made, and it <strong><em>includes some amounts that may not represent future obligations at all</em></strong>. [emphases mine]</p></blockquote>
<p>Pay particular attention to that last; it&#8217;s the closest you&#8217;ll find to an acknowledgement from a government official that There is No Crisis.</p>
<p>As Bruce has noted, only by distorting the worst-case and median cases does the Administration produce scenarios under which the Social Security Trust Fund—if credited with its accruals <em><a href="http://www.ssa.gov/history/BudgetTreatment.html">as the Greenspan Commission intended</a></em> (see &#8220;Off-Budget&#8221; Again-&#8220;; h/t PGL <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2006/10/ssa-on-reporting-of-federal-budget.html">here</a>)—does not have the funds to pay its obligations in perpetuity.  (As Dean Baker once observed, if you take those scenarios and apply them to the equity markets, the case for privatization disappears even more quickly.)</p>
<p>Doug Elmendorf&#8217;s admission that there may well be a perpetual Social Security surplus, even if it is phrased as &#8220;some amounts that may not represent future obligations, stands in stark relief of <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2010/11/yes-the-entitlement-commission-was-an-unforced-error-by-the-obama-administration.html">the most notable &#8220;unforced error&#8221; of the Obama Administration</a>.</p>

                                <p>Update: Brad DeLong <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2010/12/cant-anybody-in-obamas-inner-circle-play-this-game.html">appears to confirm</a> that Obama&#8217;s inner circle would be best served by being placed in a circular firing squad, given live ammo, and being told to &#8220;do what is right.&#8221;</p>
<p>The plethora of disingenuous claims that Barack Obama &#8220;won&#8221; with the McConnell-Obama &#8220;compromise&#8221; are legend.  See, for instance, <a href="http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2010/12/obama-president-mcconnell-sucker.html">the idiocy of Andrew Sullivan</a> (of which Andrew Samwick is too generous when he describes it as &#8220;<a href="http://capitalgainsandgames.com/blog/andrew-samwick/2071/white-house-white-board-tax-deal">poor political tactics</a>&#8220;; see also <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2010/12/aimai-on-mcconnell-obama.html">Brad DeLong</a>), and <a href="http://rortybomb.wordpress.com/2010/12/13/re-examining-the-who-got-what-chart/">the Administration&#8217;s disingenuous &#8220;what &#8216;we&#8217; won&#8221; chart</a>.</p>
<p>The big question was how this is supposed to stimulate the economy. Those of us who argued that it would do damage noted that it was the first move.</p>
<p>Obama has so far played (<a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/12/can-either-james-kwak-or-mark-thoma.html">as I noted earlier</a>):  1 g4 e5 </p>
<p>Now, Mark Thoma discovers that he <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2010/12/cutting-social-security-to-prevent-cuts-in-social-security.html">really does intend 2 f3 and then will wait for the Republican&#8217;s next move</a>:<br />
<blockquote>The second part, now being teed up by the White House and key Senate Democrats, is a scheme for the president to embrace much of the Bowles-Simpson plan — including cuts in Social Security. This is to be unveiled, according to well-placed sources, in the president’s State of the Union address.</p></blockquote>
<p>followed soon by what may be the stupidest serious paragraph ever written by someone who isn&#8217;t Donald Luskin:<br />
<blockquote>White House strategists believe this can also give Obama “credit” for getting serious about deficit reduction — now more urgent with the nearly $900 billion increase in the deficit via the tax cut deal.</p></blockquote>
<p>We have always heard that the first Black President would be subject to an increased threat of assassination.  Only now do we discover that he intends to commit <em>seppuku</em>.</p>
<p>The optimistic version of his chances for re-election now appears to be the case presented by &#8220;Norman&#8221; in comments to my previous post (slightly edited for clarity):<br />
<blockquote>If &#8220;O&#8221; continues his so called compromise—giving in to whatever the right wants—doesn&#8217;t pull a LBJ and gets the nod in 2012, the Repubs nominate Sarah [Palin], then it&#8217;s quite possible he could win again. Only this time, the Republicans would be a deciding factor in the win. Why? Because they know he will cave on just about everything they ask for.</p></blockquote>
<p>The only quibble there may be the &#8220;just about.&#8221;</p>

                                <p>Update: Brad DeLong looks at the data and suggests that <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2010/12/james-kwak-on-the-obama-renaissance.html">the problem may be that the current President is as innumerate as the previous one</a>.</p>
<p>Mark Thoma <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2010/12/the-obama-renaissance.html">quotes James Kwak</a>:<br />
<blockquote>So no, I don’t think Obama is abandoning his principles for political advantage; I think these are his principles. And while I’m upset at him, I’m upset at him for being wrong on the policy level, not for abandoning anything or selling out&#8230;I always thought Obama was a moderate who looked like a progressive.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m with Kwak on that; it&#8217;s one of the reasons I supported the relatively-more-progressive Hillary through the primaries.*</p>
<p>Where I&#8217;m less sanguine is the base from which Mark let him start:<br />
<blockquote>Obama is certainly in a decent position politically, and I would bet on him to be reelected comfortably in 2012.</p></blockquote>
<p>In 1996, Bill Clinton had the advantage of Bob Dole—the 1996 equivalent of Newt Gingrich—being his opponent.  Dole had been a known quantity to voters for over a decade (&#8220;Do you want Grits and Fritz or a Ford Dole?&#8221;) who supported Clarence Thomas, talked about Hideo Nomo of the Brooklyn Dodgers, and fell off the front of a stage—and still <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1996">garnered more than 40% of the vote, losing the popular vote by only slightly more votes than Ross Perot won</a>.  And that was after the advantage of a virtually-uncontested primary, which Mr. Obama may not enjoy.**</p>
<p>Kwak later backtracks a bit:<br />
<blockquote>I think two years would be enough time for labor markets to recover if we could expect policy supporting employment along the way. But we are likely to get just the opposite, deficit cutting measures and other policies that work against employment and hence work against electoral success for the Democrats. <em>Toss in a compromise on Social Security that angers the Democratic base, a possibility that cannot be dismissed as Obama follows up on what appears to be a successful move to the center, and the future does not look as bright.</em> Obama may think he is playing the game well now, but the game is far from over.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is at least far more accurate than the declaration that Obama won when his opening g4 was followed by the Republican&#8217;s e5.  And Thoma follows up with his expectation of Obama&#8217;s next move being f3:<br />
<blockquote>That would put an end to any stimulus due to the tax compromise. <em>Stimulating the economy was never the intent of the GOP when they agreed to the tax compromise, it was all about the estate tax and tax cuts for the wealthy.</em> They will do what they can to decrease government spending over the next two years, starting in January, and if they are successful it will reverse any benefit the economy might have received from the compromise.</p></blockquote>
<p>Given that we all agree on the likely next two years, it would be nice to see an economic model from either Mark or James Kwak that justifies the expectation that Obama is in a position &#8220;to be reelected comfortably in 2012.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the very least, I want to offer to bet with Mr. Kwak, at even odds, with proceeds to go to the charity of the winner&#8217;s choice. Here&#8217;s <a href="http://www.shelterfromthestorm.ca/">my choice</a>.</p>
<p>*The other being that she would know from the start that she was hated, and be ready for bear at the outset. (As an aside: sorry, <a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/">Scott</a>, but hiring Mark Penn, while a mistake, is not a revelation of policy preferences. Or, if you want to argue it is, tell us what replacing Howard Dean and the 50-State Strategy with Tim Kaine and Suborning Democrats such as Sibelius and Napolitano into the Administration is.)</p>
<p>**I say this not only because I would like to see him challenged—his doing a Specter in 2011 is about the only hope for my grandchildren—but also because it makes sense to prepare the field for 2016 and beyond.  It would be dumber of the Democrats <em>not</em> to have someone challenge him in the primary, leaving only HRC and Joe Biden as probably 2016 candidates, than it would be to unite behind him in the hope that Republicans nominate someone who is unelectable a la Dole in 1996.</p>

<p><a href="http://econospeak.blogspot.com/2010/11/impoverished-and-impoverishing-debate.html">The Impoverished, and Impoverishing, Debate about Fiscal Deficits</a><br />originally posted at <strong>Econospeak</strong>
<p>It is like living in a dream—a very bad dream. Everything seems at once real and imaginary, serious and deliriously impossible. The language is familiar and incomprehensible. And it seems there is no waking up, ever.</p>
<p>I’m talking about the “debate” over America’s fiscal deficits, which is what I stumbled into after a night of much happier visions. Now, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/29/us/politics/29fiscal.html?ref=todayspaper&#038;pagewanted=print">according to this morning’s New York Times</a>, the left has weighed in with its own plans to achieve deficit stability. Of course, it is more reasonable than the pronunciamenti of the Simpson-Bowles cabal, with a wiser assortment of cuts and more progressive tax adjustments. Still, it is part of the same bizarre trance, disconnected from the basic laws of income accounting.</p>
<p>All you need to know is the fundamental identity. In its financial balance form, it appears as:</p>
<p>Private Deficits + Public Deficits ≡ Current Account Balance<br /><a name="more"></a><br />If the US runs, say, a 4% CA deficit, the sum of its net public and private deficits must equal 4%. You can’t alter this no matter how you juggle budgets.<br />Add to this one more piece of wisdom, which we should have learned from the past three years, even if we were blind to everything else: private debts matter as much as public ones. The indebtedness of households, corporations and financial entities can bring down the economy as readily as the profligacy of the public sector. In fact, in the grip of a crisis (which we have not yet escaped), private deficits are far harder to finance because of their greater default risk. That’s why governments slathered themselves with red ink: they borrowed to assume the debts that private parties could no longer bear.</p>
<p>So what does this mean for US fiscal deficits? Isn’t it obvious? Public deficits can be brought down only to the extent that the private willingness and capacity to borrow increases and current account (mostly trade) deficits shrink. There is still an important discussion to be had over the size and composition of revenues and expenditures, of course, but this is only about how, not how much. To put it differently, if private deficits and the external position of the US economy remain as they are, planned deficit reduction by the government cannot be realized. Revenues will fall along with spending, the economy will take a dive, and actual fiscal deficits will be unmoved. This is guaranteed by the laws of arithmetic, and you can see such a process happening in real time in the peripheral Eurozone countries.</p>
<p>What can break this fall? The current account constraint can be relaxed as falling incomes drive falling imports, but this entails an economic catastrophe unless devaluation can do the job instead. Or the borrowing capacity of the private sector can rise, but this is inconceivable in a collapsing economy. Or, facing the abyss, those who run the show can dispense with all the nonsense about fiscal prudence in isolation from surrounding economic conditions, and open the spigots once again.<br />My prediction: if there is deficit-cutting in the US of any sort before the private sector is prepared to take on more debt and, especially, approximate trade balance is restored, we will see exactly this third scenario. The economy will take a dive, political leaders (whether of the latté or tea persuasion) will spend like crazy, and fiscal deficits will be larger than ever. The deficit-cutting debate is delusional.</p>

<blockquote><p>The sudden proliferation of deficit-reduction plans is a reminder that the deficit is, at its heart, a math problem. To get the budget into &#8220;primary balance&#8221; in 2015 &#8211; that&#8217;s wonk-speak for a balanced budget before interest payments, and it&#8217;s the target everyone is trying to hit &#8211; we need $225 billion in savings and new revenue. And you know what? That&#8217;s not so hard. </p>
<p>You get there by adding taxes and subtracting spending. As the differences between the various plans suggest, there are a lot of ways to do that. Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles, the Bipartisan Policy Center, Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.) and the conservative Americans for Tax Reform all have their own proposals, with their own unique mixes of policy suggestions. </p>
<p>Resolving the deficit, however, requires a different sort of math. The equation is almost insultingly simple: 218 + 60 + 1. That&#8217;s a majority in the House plus a supermajority in the Senate (though you could do this through budget reconciliation, meaning you only need a majority) plus a signature from the president. This math problem, however, is almost impossible to solve. That&#8217;s because the politicians don&#8217;t agree, and perhaps more important, neither do the people.</p></blockquote>
