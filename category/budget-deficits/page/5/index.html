<p>CBO Director&#8217;s Blog summary of <a target="_blank" href="http://cboblog.cbo.gov/?p=1112">Long Term Budget Outlook</a> (Interesting side comment: &#8220;Later this week, CBO will release a report on a number of different policy options for changing Social Security&#8221;). Elmendorf, not surprising given his history and current job, is fully on the side of the deficit hawk/hysterics.</p>
<p>Report text (1.2MB PDF) <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/115xx/doc11579/06-30-LTBO.pdf">Long Term Budget Outlook</a></p>
<p>These were just released at 9AM Eastern so I haven&#8217;t had a crack at them yet. Feel free to beat me to the juicy parts and put them up in comments. I&#8217;ll update this post as necessary through the course of the morning.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/TCtTmoWGJ_I/AAAAAAAAAXw/0Cdwz0RUqmY/s1600/CBO+LTO+Fig1-2.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/TCtTmoWGJ_I/AAAAAAAAAXw/0Cdwz0RUqmY/s400/CBO+LTO+Fig1-2.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />Interestingly if we examine the above two figures we see that &#8216;Extended baseline&#8217; which essentially means &#8216;Current law&#8217; shows the deficit vanishing by 2014 and Debt Held by the Public stabilizing through 2035. Making  some of the &#8220;If this  goes on the sky will fall!&#8221; rhetoric around Obama policy a little overstated, just as with Social Security a plan of &#8220;Nothing&#8221; getting oddly some pretty good projected results.</p>

<p>High on the list of tasks mandated of the Obama Deficit Commission is to get the deficit down to 3% of GDP by 2015. Unfortunately for them they have set up a situation where they can&#8217;t move that number via cuts to Social Security, if anything such cuts more one of their metrics the wrong way. To understand why we need to revisit old friends including &#8216;Leninist Strategy&#8217;, &#8216;CSSS&#8217;, &#8216;deficit&#8217;, &#8216;debt&#8217; and &#8216;unfunded liability&#8217;.</p>
<p>It was well understood as far back as the publication of Butler and Germanis&#8217; <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cato.org/pubs/journal/cj3n2/cj3n2.html">Leninist Strategy (11th article here)</a> in 1983 that cutting benefits in the near term for existing retirees and even for newly approaching retirees was both politically deadly and deeply inequitable, these people simply didn&#8217;t have time to do alternative planning through Personal Retirement Accounts or anything else. This reality was explicitly recognized by Bush&#8217;s 2001 Commission to Strengthen Social Security where it was established as Guiding Principle no 1 of 6 <a target="_blank" href="http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/csss/index.htm">CSSS</a>. Now how long this grace period should be and whether it would be permanent for that class of retirees, or whether they would ultimately share in whatever index changes were adopted vary across plans. What doesn&#8217;t vary is the fact that no plan entirely based  on benefit cuts can move that 2015 target number.</p>
<p>The why and how of this below the fold.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />The first problem is that Social Security &#8216;reformers&#8217; continually confuse &#8216;deficit&#8217;, &#8216;debt&#8217; and &#8216;unfunded liability&#8217;. They implicitly assume that current year deficits sum into ten year debt increases which in turn equate to long-term unfunded liabilities. And if we were just talking about General Fund spending this would largely be so. But Social Security throws some wrinkles in.</p>
<p>Lets take the extreme case, one where benefit cuts happen right away from Day One. Well if big enough they would put Social Security back in cash-flow positive  territory (CBO&#8217;s &#8216;Primary Surplus&#8217;) and so score as a reduction in deficits compared to the baseline, so far so good. But by forestalling the need to pay a portion of the interest accruing on the Trust Fund in cash those cuts equally serve to pad the bottom line of Trust Fund balances, which for this purpose score as a part of total Public Debt. To make it worse interest not paid out in cash gets transformed into new principal which itself starts drawing interest and so boosting Trust Fund Balances compared to the baseline. Exactly how are you creating &#8216;intergenerational equity&#8217; and relieving your children and grand-children when the net effect of short term cuts is a boost in long-term debt. (I know this sounds goofy, but that  is the way the numbers run).</p>
<p>So the Commission is already in a trap, they can improve the short term deficit position by cutting benefits and in so doing also have positive effects on 75 year and Infinite Future actuarial gaps but only at the cost of actually increasing Public Debt over the medium term. But it gets worse, because they have already ruled out short term benefit cuts.</p>
<p>The strictest plan being floated right now is that of co-Chairman Alan Simpson. He would reduce the grace period so that it only cover people 60 and older. But this means that you simply don&#8217;t see any savings at all until people now aged 59 reach Full Retirement Age which in practice means 2017. Meaning you don&#8217;t move the number in the target year of 2015 AT ALL. And unless you quickly phase in those benefit cuts in a big way in 2017 you end up with no real impact on your standard CBO Ten Year score.</p>
<p>And the Ryan Roadmap makes this worse, he would exempt people 55 and older which means your very first savings come in 2022 and so outside the 10 Year scoring window altogether. And  then you have people like Bachmann vaguely  proposing to &#8216;wean&#8217; people under 50 off Social Security, which puts any savings off until 2027. Which is fine if your real goal is to eliminate Social Security over the long run, but not particularly compelling when you are trying to sell this as a deficit and debt reduction measure sparked by short term Obama spending. It literally does not compute.</p>
<p>The current public line being taken by most of the Commissioners is that they have to tackle Social Security to show the bond market that they are serious. But since it is doubtful they have the cojones to cut  benefits in the short term and even if they do won&#8217;t have the effect they need on either their Public Debt or Debt Held by the Public metrics, how is that supposed to reassure the bond markets of anything?</p>
<p>Now the Commission has a tiny exit hole. If they can keep the focus entirely on reducing the 75 year and Infinite Future actuarial gap and keep the public in the dark about the actual effect of their proposals on ten year deficits and twenty year debt levels they might escape the trap. But their political need in the here and now to make unpopular future cuts to Social Security somehow forced on them by current deficits makes it difficult for them to pull the bait and switch, over the last year the  informed public has been trained to look at the CBO score and in that regard the Commission has nothing.</p>

<p>Reader BuffPilot has been asking Angry Bear for awhile now to post the following graph<br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/S8dozbViClI/AAAAAAAAAXQ/Xza0LZQCtb4/s1600/obama_budget_deficit_2009.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/S8dozbViClI/AAAAAAAAAXQ/Xza0LZQCtb4/s400/obama_budget_deficit_2009.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />http://blog.heritage.org/2009/03/24/bush-deficit-vs-obama-deficit-in-pictures/<br />If you follow the link you will see that Heritage updated it with new CBO and OMB data this year. That is below the fold.<br /><a name="more"></a><br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/S8doz3_kd0I/AAAAAAAAAXY/nOrNwC4Dtwc/s1600/obama_budget_deficit_2010.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/S8doz3_kd0I/AAAAAAAAAXY/nOrNwC4Dtwc/s400/obama_budget_deficit_2010.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />http://blog.heritage.org/2010/02/05/past-deficits-vs-obamas-deficits-in-pictures/</p>
<p>Which I will amplify with the actual CBO Table<br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/S8dswzCHUCI/AAAAAAAAAXg/dNGzTXnHIhE/s1600/Table+1-1.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/S8dswzCHUCI/AAAAAAAAAXg/dNGzTXnHIhE/s400/Table+1-1.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/108xx/doc10871/Chapter1.shtml</p>
<p>I am not sure what the take away here is. A year ago CBO was more pessimistic than OMB about the years after 2012, where OMB stay deficits stabilizing at a fairly level percentage of GDP, CBO saw much sharper increases. This year that seems to have flipped flopped some with both OMB and CBO seeing deficits stabilizing through 2018, with CBO seeing smaller deficits than projected the year before and the White House OMB seeing them somewhat higher. probably because CBO is working off current law that would have middle class tax cuts expire, while OMB is counting on preserving them for people making under $250,000. Anyway if you just take CBO scoring things are moving in the right direction policy-wise.</p>
<p>Anyway plenty for people to chew on. Consider this a budget and deficit open thread.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p><em>Note: This is “what I believe I said,” not“what I would have said” and is presented here solely to document the confluences that were, perhaps, clearer in my head than they were in the presentation itself.  As such, several references here are echoes of earlier pieces of the presentation. (Links to same will be updated as soon as possible.)<br /></em>
<p>To review, there are three standard methods of reducing a fiscal debt: default, inflate, and taxation and/or budget cutting.  I believe it is clear that default is not desirable; the historic examples of 1917 Russia and the State of Louisiana are clear indicators that issues persist long after the act itself, and the recent suffering of the Argentineans in 2002 and 2003 clearly shows that, even at the time, default is at best a problematic solution, more an amputation than a lancing.</p>
<p>The second, moderate inflation, has the collateral issue that some of the assumed benefits of an inflationary policy—especially an inflationary policy in an environment with a relatively low savings rate—do not accrue to the country whose currency is the dominant one in the world.  As I noted earlier, David Beckworth is doing some research in this area, and I look forward to seeing the results.It seems safe to assume that the benefits of inflation will not accrue in the way a model might predict, and therefore “solving” the problem with inflation will require a suboptimal level to achieve optimal policy.  The chance of having to repeat “the Volcker experiment” would not be small, while the likelihood of success would not be so large.</p>
<p>Budget cutting is an abiding idea. While I’m perfectly willing to stipulate that one might be able to cut around 1% of GDP from the US defense budget, and that some direct consumption—though much of this is a State and Local issue more than a Federal one—might be reducible, this appears unlikely to have more than a marginal effect. While we like—indeed, make a living from identifying—marginal effects, the magnitude of the issue at hand requires more.  Since we generally can stipulate that transfer payments are at worst neutral (or, by Jim Baker’s “supply-side/conspicuous consumption” theory presented earlier, likely beneficial to both the velocity of money and overall tax revenues), gains from there will, at best, not help the team.</p>

</p>
<p>This leaves taxation, and it is perfectly reasonable to assume that taxation can be increased. Except that, as you can see from the graphic I have left on the screen, we have a large deadweight loss in health care spending. We spend approximately 6% more, on a percent-of-GDP basis, than the next country, with no noticeable economic value-added.  Having that deadweight loss hanging over the economy limits options—possibly as much or more than being the dominant currency.  And since the basic premise of this panel appears to be that we would prefer that the US Dollar remain the dominant world currency—that is, becoming the 21st century equivalent of 20th century Britain not being a desired outcome—we are left to the reality that we cannot solve the budget crisis without reducing or eliminating much of the deadweight loss in the health-care system.</p>
<p>Were we to solve only half of the difference and transfer that amount to tax revenues, we would solve the budget deficit without adding any drag to the economy, effectively substituting tax revenues for cost overruns. We would, in short, have produced a better team: a better engine for growth and a greater potential for entrepreneurial opportunity, even if a groundskeeper becomes underutilized in the process.</p>
<p>The most viable alternative to addressing the deficit by addressing the deadweight loss in the health-care system appears to be to yield our place as the world’s Reserve currency of choice. There does not appear to be much of an appetite for that, even if there were a clear mechanism to do so.</p>
<p>As economists we look for the suboptimal.  In this case, we can identify the areas where the returns are low—defense spending—the areas where spending growth might be moderated—Government Direct Consumption, although that is a very nominal portion of the Federal budget—and areas where there are clear deadweight losses—health care spending.  Only the latter shows much promise as a direct, not just a marginal, way to address the problem.</p>

<p>Well it looks like we are going to get a Deficit Commission and one way or another Social Security will be on the table. But what exactly does that mean for either Social Security or the total deficit picture? Before answering that lets review a couple of basics.</p>
<p>In talking deficit reduction we need to distinguish between &#8216;deficit&#8217; and &#8216;debt&#8217;. A &#8216;deficit&#8217; is basically an accounting convention, it is worthwhile to calculate various gaps between income and cost. But not everything labeled &#8216;income&#8217; actually represents cash extracted from the economy, in particular interest on Intragovernmental Holdings is not in fact financed by such dollars, although it is real as real in the long run, in the immediate term it is simply a bookkeeping entry. Which leads to some really odd results. In order to keep things straight the CBO maintains two different measures for deficits: &#8216;primary deficit&#8217; which measures actual cash flow and &#8216;deficit&#8217; which includes that interest. Now in general newspapers report the deficit and not the primary deficit, when we talk about an Obama $1.6 trillion deficit for FY2010 that figure silently includes interest on the Intragovernmental Holdings as a positive number, whereas a calculation of primary deficit wouldn&#8217;t include it at all.</p>
<p>Turning to &#8216;debt&#8217;. Last week Congress raised the debt ceiling from $12 trillion to close to $15 trillion. But this does not mean Treasury is free to borrow up to $3 trillion in cash prior to going back to Congress, because there are two different components of debt subject to the ceiling. You can check out both the total debt and its two components via a web application maintained by Treasury called <a target="_blank" href="http://www.treasurydirect.gov/NP/BPDLogin?application=np">Debt to the Penny</a> which would tell you that as of Monday &#8216;Debt held by the Public&#8217; was $7.849 trillion while &#8216;Intragovernmental Holdings&#8217; were $4.499 trillion for a total of &#8216;Public Debt&#8217; of $12.349 trillion, which is the number you normally see reported in the newspapers.</p>
<p>Mostly when people talk &#8216;deficit reduction&#8217; they do so not in the context of opening borrowing room in the current year or its effects on interest rates, those those are pretty important things indeed. Instead they tend to think of it in terms of debt reduction or perhaps just a slowing in the growth rate of Public Debt. And one way to accomplish that is to cut spending. Or so you would think, once you start factoring in the curious treatment of interest on Intragovernmental Holdings things start getting strange. Follow me below the fold if you dare.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />More than half of the $4.499 trillion in Intragovernmental Holdings are held by the two Social Security Trust Funds, in fact they have $2.5 trillion in Treasury obligations that score as part of Public Debt. But for the sake of this argument I want to simplify that a little:</p>
<p>Suppose you have a Trust Fund with a balance of $2 trillion in notes earning 5% a year which operates along side a benefits program with its own dedicated revenue stream that either will or will not pay all costs in any give year. Now imagine three different scenarios:</p>
<p>A1: the benefits program self-funds with non-interest income equalling cost<br />B1: the benefits program runs with an operating loss of $100 billion<br />C1: the benefits program runs with an operating surplus of $100 billion<br />What are the subsequent impacts on total Public Debt?</p>
<p>Under A1 there is no call on funds from Treasury nor is there any cash flow to it. But Treasury does have to create $100 billion in the form of new Special Treasuries to credit to the Trust Fund to account for interest. This $100 billion adds to Intragovernmental Holdings which in turn adds to Public Debt for a net increase in that debt of $100 billion.</p>
<p>Under B1 there is a call on $100 billion in funds from Treasury to meet costs. To meet that call Treasury has to borrow (or find revenue, same thing for our purposes) $100 billion in Debt held by the Public. In turn it offsets that by not giving any credit to the Trust Fund for accrued interest, instead &#8216;taking&#8217; it in exchange for that other dept. The end result is that $100 billion is added to Debt held by the Public and so to Public Debt while nothing is added to Intragovernmental Holdings with a net increase in total Public Debt of $100 billion, i.e. the same amount as A1.</p>
<p>Under C1 the operating surplus of $100 billion flows to Treasury and in principle pays down that same amount in Debt Held by the Public (or reduces borrowing by that amount, same thing) which reduces Debt Held by the Public and hence Public Debt by that amount. But under the rules in play Treasury is required to issue $100 billion in Special Treasuries to &#8216;pay&#8217; for that borrowing and another $100 billion in such Treasuries to account for the interest which increases Intragovernmental Holdings and so Public Debt by that amount for a total net increase in total Public Debt of $100 billion. Same as A1 and B1.</p>
<p>So for the specific purpose of calculating Public Debt A1=B1=C1. I suggest this result is pretty damn counter-intuitive but absent some mechanism I am missing that is how the numbers run.</p>
<p>Okay now say in the interest of deficit and debt reduction we cut our benefits program by $100 billion a year while leaving its revenue constant.</p>
<p>A2. The benefits program, previously revenue neutral, now provides a $100 billion cash surplus to Treasury reducing Debt Held by the Public by that amount. In turn Treasury issues $200 billion in Special Treasuries to account for the borrowing and the accrued interest. Net increase in the Public Debt is still $100 billion.<br />B2: The benefits program, previously running at a $100 billion loss, is no revenue neutral with no cash effect on Treasury meaning that Treasury only has to issue a Special Treasury for $100 billion meaning a net increase in Public Debt of $100 billion.<br />B3: The benefits program, previously running a $100 billion surplus now is running a $200 billion one, reducing Debt Held by the Public and hence Public Debt by that same amount. But Treasury has to issue $300 billion in Special Treasuries for a net increase in Public Debt of $100 billion.</p>
<p>Now this is getting kind of spooky, not only does A1=B1=C1 for the purposes of the number on the Debt Clock, they are also precisely equal to A2=B2=C2. That is no matter whether the current system is running cash surpluses, cash deficits or is cash neutral cutting $100 billion in spending doesn&#8217;t move the Debt Clock at all.</p>
<p>Does this mean there is no real world effect? Well of course not, between the six scenarios we have impacts on Debt Held by the Public from up $100 billion to down $200 billion depending on the before and after states, that is real money. But all it really is is a transfer from Social Security beneficiaries to holders of Debt Held by the Public, it is just robbing Grandma so as to make it easier to pay off the Chinese Central Bank.</p>
<p>Making the attempt to attach at least this component of Entitlements Reform to raising the Debt Ceiling kind of a sham. Because for the specific purpose of calculating total Public Debt subject to the limit it is a wash.</p>
<p>Now lets turn to Deficits. Under Unified Budget scoring any surplus to Social Security including accrued interest counts as a positive meaning a $100 billion annual cut in Benefits will yield a $1 trillion ten year score plus any additional interest effects on the Trust Funds which actually would be substantial. Because every $100 billion added to or not subtracted from the Trust Fund will be generating 5% compound interest. But those same interest dollars which score as a positive on a 10 year deficit total actually score as an equal increase in Public Debt. This too is pretty damn counterintuitive, we have the same factor driving deficit and debt in opposite directions.</p>
<p>And just to insert some final confusion what does $100 billion in cost cuts per annum do for our old friend Unfunded Liability. Well it wipes it out, the problem being that it is simply replaced by Public Debt in the form of Special Treasuries even as the dollars used to build that fund were spent long since. Given all this I can&#8217;t see why any worker would support cuts to Social Security, all that does it cut current obligations while replacing them with Public Debt in the future, a debt that we can&#8217;t expect the capitalists of the future to be any more willing to pay back than the capitalists of today. As long as the Social Security Trust Funds are throwing off enough interest dollars to cover the gap between  Income excluding Interest and Cost there is absolutely no reason why workers should simply sacrifice their own interests here. In this scenario all of the benefit simply flows to the bond market. Now theoretically there would be positive impacts on interest rates which might create some indirect benefits for consumers, and if we were experiencing Carter/Reagan double digit interest rates then maybe a case could be made. But under current conditions I just don&#8217;t see it.</p>
<p>Anyway the next time some one comes waving that $12 trillion figure as a reason to cut Social Security be sure to ask him to show his work, in this particular case cutting spending actually serves to increase debt. And weirdly enough so does increasing revenue. Such are the weirdities of Trust Fund accounting.<br />____________________________________________</p>
<p>Final bonus nugget. What would a perfectly balanced Social Security system look like?<br />One it would run a small cash flow deficit, Treasury would be transferring some money to SS each and every year.<br />Two still Social Security would overall score as being in surplus for Unified Budget purposes.<br />Three beyond whatever borrowing was needed for One, Social Security would be adding to Public Debt every year.</p>
<p>Yep a system that is cash flow negative, in permanent surplus AND adding to debt. Perfect! Wrap your head around that for awhile.</p>

<p>This un-borrowed, un-spent money qualifies as deficit reduction?</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes.  We expected a $1.4B deficit, it will only be $1.2B.</p>
<p>Next silly question.<br />
<blockquote>For Asia’s emerging economies, Geithner’s high road entails strengthening “their social safety nets through sustainable health and retirement-benefit schemes, thus reducing the need for high precautionary saving that contributes to global imbalances.”</p></blockquote>

                                <p>by divorced one like Bush</p>
<p>So I check my mail today, 10/17 (been attending continuing ed this weekend) and find that as a member of the National Association of the Self-Employed (150K strong) I will now receive a news letter of sorts from a John Mauldin by receiving his latest: Muddle Through, R.I.P?   Muddle Through is some interpretation of his from 2002 as to what the economy was.  In a word the economy was: Yawn.  Slow growth, jobless recovery.</p>
<p>He then gets into his real message: Deficits as far as you can see thus, we&#8217;re screwed.  Here we come Japan, “Japanese Disease”, unless we can get savings and there is a way to do it. (Can you guess where he&#8217;s going?)</p>
<p>Mr. Mauldin starts off with some math and explanation to make his case:<br />
<blockquote>GDP (Gross Domestic Product) is defined as Consumption (C) plus Investment (I) plus Government Spending (G) plus [Exports (E) minus Imports (I)] or: <br />GDP = C + I + G + (E-I)<br />(For the wonks out there, GDP is usually termed &#8220;Y&#8221;.)</p>
<p>This equation is known as an identity. An identity is an equality that remains true regardless of the values of any variables that appear within it. That means it is not a guess or an approximation. It is simple reality.</p>
<p>Thus, if there is a government deficit, there must be savings by both consumers and businesses, plus capital flows from outside the country, to offset that deficit in order for there to be any money left over for investments&#8230; There must be savings in order for there to be investment. And without investment, you do not get job growth or economic growth.</p></blockquote>
<p>During his Japanese Disease part of the argument we get to the bottom line:<br />
<blockquote>Since government deficit spending has no long-term multiplier effect, growth has been nonexistent. (By the way, that research about multiplier effects has also been done by Christina Romer, the chairman of the current President&#8217;s Council of Economic Advisors, and further explored by European economists. There is general agreement on these facts.)</p></blockquote>
<p>He then quotes Professor Barro (do you see now where he&#8217;s going?):<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;&#8230;The government problem is complicated by the fact that the tax multiplier is 3, meaning that a 1% change in taxes will change GDP by about 3% over time. More recent research (Barro &#038; Redlick, September 2009, &#8220;NBER Working Paper 15369&#8243;) suggests that a 1% cut in the marginal tax rate would raise GDP in the ensuing year by 0.6%. With the deficit rising due to a zero spending multiplier, the tendency will be to try to raise taxes to pay for this higher level of expenditures, which will further depress aggregate spending and output.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, there it is, some Romer interpretation.  But, we&#8217;re not fully there as to the solution.  The banks are missing in this presentation until Mr. Mauldin asks who will buy this debt?   <em>“I think that the buyers of the debt could be US banks for quite some time&#8230;”</em> then notes that banks are not lending and asks:<br />
<blockquote>So where do banks put their cash and reserves they are not lending? At the Fed and in Treasury debt. If you can leverage capital at ten to one (as banks can) and if you get 2% (for longer-term debt) and if you only have costs of, say, 50 basis points (or 0.5%), you can make a return on equity of 15% with no risk.</p></blockquote>
<p>Thus, they are not lending because there is no need to in order to make money which has hurt small and medium businesses by cutting off their “life blood” resulting in no job creation.</p>
<p>Oh, another thing, banks are taking a hit on commercial real estate so they need to save (his words are “raise capital”).  Poor banks are just trying to survive and the lowly job seekers are just the collateral damage. So sorry.</p>
<p>Are you following?  Massive government deficit is causing the banks to park their government created money in the government and it&#8217;s killing our jobs because the small and medium business can&#8217;t  get a loan because the banks need to save in order to cover the commercial real estate losses.  <br />
<blockquote>Large government deficits choke off the very investment that we need to create jobs.</p></blockquote>
<p>So just what would the banks do about the commercial real estate losses if the government didn&#8217;t have this massive debt to make money off of?  How would they save?  Does this part of his argument not suggest that the deficit is good if the goal is to save the banks?  That has been the goal after all.</p>
<p>This get&#8217;s us to the Romers specifically.  At the end of the debt bad (but good for the banks), we&#8217;re contracting Japanese Disease, banks are being banks (being savings institutions) and it is all killing the jobs we get this:<br />Given that the current Congress is hell bent on massively raising taxes in 2011, we are likely to dip back into recession by then, if not before. Remember, taxes have a multiplier effect of three. That means tax cuts increase GDP (over time) by three times their amount. But tax increases reduce GDP by three times the increase. That will make deficits worse, and unemployment will again start to rise from already high levels. Twenty states have already raised sales taxes, and more are raising other taxes. It is a vicious spiral.</p>
<p>You know what is missing from his argument which, because it is missing makes it a bastard argument?  It is this: <br />http://elsa.berkeley.edu/~cromer/draft1108.pdf<br />Panel (d) shows that the point estimates for the effect of a deficit-driven tax increase of 1% of GDP on GDP are consistently positive. However, there are too few tax changes of this type for the effects to be estimated precisely. <strong>The maximum impact is a rise in GDP of 2.48%</strong> (t = 1.03). While one should be very cautious in reading anything into such imprecise estimates, <strong>the results are suggestive that tax increases to reduce an inherited deficit may be less costly than other tax increases.</strong></p>
<p>You know what is another example of a bastard argument?  It is the one made by the person that took some medical well baby guidelines and implemented a policy that prevented a 4 month old from getting health insurance coverage for being too fat!  </p>
<p>Bastardization of research happens all the time by the health insurance industry.  I hope there are other doc&#8217;s on Mr. Mauldin&#8217;s email list that make the same recognition of his argument.  I don&#8217;t see how they can&#8217;t.  We deal with it every day.   </p>
<p>Sure glad I have the doc&#8217;s here at AB that <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/01/further-critique-of-romer-and-romer.html">are into</a> <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/03/more-on-romer-and-romer-2007.html">economic wellness care</a>.</p>

Some observers, comparing OMB’s estimate of the deficit over the next ten years under the President’s proposed policies ($9.1 trillion) to CBO’s “baseline” estimate of the deficit under current law ($7.1 trillion), jumped to the conclusion that the President proposes to increase the deficit dramatically. In fact, the opposite is true. The President’s proposals would produce significantly lower deficits over the next ten years than continuing current policies.<br />This and other confusions have occurred because both the OMB and CBO reports are chock-full of numbers that are hard for even seasoned budget-watchers — and almost impossible for ordinary citizens — to interpret. This brief analysis explains what some of the numbers mean, how CBO’s official baseline must be adjusted to show what CBO’s estimate of deficits would be if it assumed current policies are continued, and why even that adjusted baseline should not be compared with OMB’s estimate of deficits under the President’s policies.</p></blockquote>
<p>The whole document is five pages long and should be read in full. But one lesson to take away is that you cannot directly compare CBO and OMB numbers, the former being bound by current law and the latter by current and proposed policy, two different things. To see the explanations from CBO and OMB try these links:<br />Orszag Press Release <a target="_blank" href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/blog/09/08/25/Mid-SessionReview/">Mid-Session Review</a><br />OMB Mid-Session Review <a target="_blank" href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/MSR/">Mid-Session Review Web-Page</a> with link to PDF of full report.<br />CBO Director&#8217;s Blog <a target="_blank" href="http://cboblog.cbo.gov/?p=347">Comparing CBO&#8217;s and OMB&#8217;s Projections of the Federal Budget Deficit</a> with link to PDF.<br />A table below the fold .</p>

<p>So before people jump to conclusions about how these new OMB and CBO numbers show Obama is breaking the bank be sure you know whether you are dealing with apples and oranges both with the initial and revised numbers.</p>

                                <p>by Bruce Webb</p>
<p>In a previous post I highlighted the chapter of CBO&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/102xx/doc10297/06-25-LTBO.pdf">Long-Term Budget Outlook</a> that pertained to Social Security. But the Report goes beyond that and in fact focuses on two different possible scenarios outlined in the following Table:<br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/Skj0hqGN-0I/AAAAAAAAAPs/LbB-hSrrgAQ/s1600-h/CBO+LTBO+Table+1-1.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/Skj0hqGN-0I/AAAAAAAAAPs/LbB-hSrrgAQ/s400/CBO+LTBO+Table+1-1.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />The shorthand way of defining &#8216;extended baseline&#8217; is &#8216;Bush tax cuts expire on schedule&#8217; while &#8216;alternative fiscal&#8217; equates to &#8216;extending tax cuts&#8217;. There are additional components like AMT and physician compensation which have been consistently adjusted to avoid the impacts of then current law projections (feel free to expand on this in comments) but the real question boils down to &#8216;sunset tax cuts&#8217; or &#8216;extend them&#8217;. So what would be the consequences? More figures under the fold.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/Skj3GgxLyJI/AAAAAAAAAQE/OXL_KoWG9Uk/s1600-h/CBO+LTBO+Table+1-2.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/Skj3GgxLyJI/AAAAAAAAAQE/OXL_KoWG9Uk/s400/CBO+LTBO+Table+1-2.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />Under &#8216;extended baseline&#8217; the deficit in 2035 projects to be 5.6% of GDP. Is this good? Well no, I don&#8217;t think it is even acceptable. But it is a lot better place to start that the 14.6% of GDP deficit we get from &#8216;alternative fiscal&#8217;.</p>
<p>Now the above are snapshots. What if we aggregate this over 25, 50, and 75 year intervals? Well you get Box 1-1.<br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/Skj0h0sNi-I/AAAAAAAAAP8/ICwd0OfgblY/s1600-h/CBO+LTBO+Box+1-1.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/Skj0h0sNi-I/AAAAAAAAAP8/ICwd0OfgblY/s400/CBO+LTBO+Box+1-1.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Now these annual and aggregated deficts all need to get financed by borrowing. How does that shake out?<br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/Skj0ho5r9EI/AAAAAAAAAP0/x9cf3adFNdM/s1600-h/CBO+LTBO+Fig+1-3.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/Skj0ho5r9EI/AAAAAAAAAP0/x9cf3adFNdM/s400/CBO+LTBO+Fig+1-3.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />So if we let the Bush tax cuts sunset we buy ourselves about 20 years to figure out what to do long-term. If we extend them we are looking at a situation by 2037 where debt held by the public is a full 200% of  GDP as opposed to 75% under current law (i.e. tax cuts sunset).</p>
<p>So those people who are attacking Obama spending effects on the deficit over the next 10 to 20 years using CBO numbers need to confront the fact that there is a lot more long term impact from the foolish policy of tax cuts on top marginal rates.</p>
<p>Let the hot, hot fun begin!</p>
