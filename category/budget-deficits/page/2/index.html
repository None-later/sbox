                                <p><a href="http://econ4obama.blogspot.com/">Economists for Obama</a> suddenly showed up in my RSS reader again. It&#8217;s <a href="http://econ4obama.blogspot.com/2011/08/yuck.html">not a pretty sight</a>:<br />
<blockquote>I suppose I might change my mind, but after watching the President give in to the Boehner-McConnell blackmail axis, I don&#8217;t imagine I&#8217;ll be spending much of my time advocating his re-election. Assuming he&#8217;s the Democratic nominee, which I do, I&#8217;ll vote for Obama, because the alternative will still&#8211;somehow&#8211;be worse. But I really can&#8217;t see how, in good conscience, I could defend the economic policies of a guy who has signed on to fiscal contraction in the midst of a major downturn. And that&#8217;s leaving aside the President&#8217;s apparent lack of understanding of the importance of bargaining from strength. So much for all that poker expertise he&#8217;s supposed to have.</p>
<p>What a shame.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>I got into this relationship without any illusions about who you were. I never listened when others told me that you were perfect. I never listened when some told me you weren&#8217;t worth my time. I got together with you because I believed in us. You and me. Somewhere along the way, you stopped caring. Somewhere along the line, you started believing in others more than you believed in me.</p>
<p>I loved you as a smart, principled man. I worked at this relationship. Even when we fought, I still sought out the good in you. Now, finally, after watching you have affair after affair, saying each time that it was just a one-time thing, I have to allow myself to feel bitter and angry and more than a little foolish. And I have to do that by myself.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure many of my friends will be upset. &#8220;What are you going to do now?&#8221; they&#8217;ll say. &#8220;You&#8217;re not going to date Mitt or Michele, are you?&#8221; What that implies is that I should <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/post/liberals-hate-the-debt-deal-so-what/2011/08/02/gIQA0AIsqI_blog.html">settle</a>, that I should compromise myself and my dreams just to keep us together. No one deserves that kind of power. And they never considered a third option between staying with you and being with someone else. They never considered that I could just be alone. </p>
<p>So this is a separation, and I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll be dating again quickly. But I need a break. I need to remember why I loved you. I need to miss you. I need to see if I miss you. Sure, sure, you&#8217;ll say, I&#8217;m being a drama queen, that nothing has changed, that I don&#8217;t live in the real world, that everything you&#8217;ve done has been for me, that I just don&#8217;t understand what it&#8217;s like to live with the pressure that you have. No, but I have to live with the results of what you do. And after you&#8217;re done, in 2013 or 2017, you&#8217;ll still be a rich moderate conservative and I&#8217;ll still be a middle-class liberal trying his best to clean up all the messes.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m gonna pack up my stuff and head out now. I wish you well, truly, for everyone&#8217;s sake. But I think if there&#8217;s anything you can take away from this, it&#8217;s simple:</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not me. It&#8217;s you.</p></blockquote>

Which is undoubtedly what several of the more politically-aware appointees started doing around twenty-four hours ago, making getting anything done all the more improbable.</p>

<li>It&#8217;s not a repeat of 1937.  It&#8217;s closer to 1882. Economists who know their history, speak up.</p>

<li>Ryan Avent (on his Twitter feed yesterday): &#8220;Assuming no extension of the payroll tax cut or UI benefits, the US is looking at a 2% of GDP effective fiscal tightening over the next year.&#8221; (NOTE: Later details appear to be that this is basically 2.6% decline from tightening, 0.5% cyclical gain, netting to around 2%.  Reference also made to JPMC survey above.)</li>

<li>Dear <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/31/business/economy/whats-with-all-the-bernanke-bashing.html?_r=2">Greg Mankiw</a> (h/t <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2011/07/links-for-2011-07-30.html">Mark Thoma</a>):
<p>If you claim the Federal Reserve Board is an independent entity, why do you argue that &#8220;a higher inflation target is a political nonstarter&#8221; (even while conceding that &#8220;economists have argued, with some logic, that the employment picture would be brighter if the Fed raised its target for inflation above 2 percent&#8221;)?</li>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Readers here will know more about the US federal government income statement than I. However, given the near ubiquitous deficit hysteria, I wanted to illustrate the truth about the budget deficit. The truth is, that deficit hysteria has been set in motion by A surge in government spending on items like unemployment compensation, food stamps, and other types of &#8216;support payments to persons for whom no current service is rendered&#8217; AND low tax receipts. Yes, long-term reform is needed; but my general conclusion is that the deficit hysteria is sorely misplaced.</p>
<p>First things first, the fiscal deficit &#8211; receipts minus net outlays as a % of GDP &#8211; is big. In June 2011, the 12-month rolling sum of net receipts (the budget deficit) was roughly 8.5% of a rolling average of GDP. This is down from its 10.6% peak in February 2010, but the level of deficit spending clearly makes some nervous.</p>
<p>Why should they be nervous about the &#8216;level&#8217; of the deficit? I don&#8217;t know, since recent &#8216;excess&#8217; deficits are cyclically endogenous. The chart below illustrates the spending and tax receipt components of the US Treasury&#8217;s net borrowing (see Table 9 of the <a href="http://www.fms.treas.gov/mts/index.html">Monthly Treasury Statement</a>). Weak tax receipts and big spending are driving the federal deficits (spending, as we will see below, has surged on items directly related to the business cycle).</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-vieS9T9mgKA/Tjh8m4EUA8I/AAAAAAAAD24/pV57iha5Ekw/s1600/deficit_breakdown.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-vieS9T9mgKA/Tjh8m4EUA8I/AAAAAAAAD24/pV57iha5Ekw/s400/deficit_breakdown.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />READ MORE AFTER THE JUMP!<br /><a name="more"></a><br />In June, the 12-month rolling sum of tax receipts &#8211; mostly corporate and individual income taxes and social insurance and retirement receipts &#8211; was 15.6%, which is up from its 14.5% cyclical low in January 2010. On the spending side, net outlays in June 2010 were a large 24.2% of GDP and down just slightly from the 25.3% peak in February 2010.</p>
<p>Deficit hysteria should be more appropriately placed as &#8220;lack of jobs and tax receipts hysteria&#8221;. At this point, the budget could just as easily worsen as it could improve, given the fragile state of the US economy (see <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2011/08/forecast-update.html">Tim Duy&#8217;s recent post at Economist&#8217;s View</a>).</p>
<p>Why the wrong hysteria?</p>
<p>Reason 1. Taxes. Some would love to increase taxes &#8211; but the fact of the matter is, that tax receipts remain well below their long-term average of 18% of GDP. Tax receipts will not improve without new jobs since individual income taxes account for near 50% of total receipts.</p>
<p>Reason 2. The spending has been on cyclical items. </p>
<p>The best time to &#8216;worry&#8217; about government spending is NOT when the economy is barely moving.</p>
<p>The chart below illustrates the big ticket items of the monthly outlays &#8211; roughly 87% of total outlays. The broad spending components are listed in Table 9 of the <a href="http://www.fms.treas.gov/mts/mts0611.txt">Monthly Treasury Statement</a>. The long-term average shares of total spending are indicated in the legend.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-mLbWzh6wWqs/Tjh_5-VFDsI/AAAAAAAAD3A/y4iHx9lNusI/s1600/spending_bigticket.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-mLbWzh6wWqs/Tjh_5-VFDsI/AAAAAAAAD3A/y4iHx9lNusI/s400/spending_bigticket.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />The items health, medicare, and income security (inc security) are all above their respective long-term averages. But spending on income security outlays is the only spending component to have broken its trend, i.e., surge. According to the GAO&#8217;s budget glossary (<a href="http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d05734sp.pdf">link here, .pdf</a>), this item includes the following cyclical spending:<br />
<blockquote>Support payments (including associated administrative expenses) to persons for whom no current service is rendered. Includes retirement, disability, unemployment, welfare, and similar programs, except for Social Security and income security for veterans, which are in other functions. Also includes the Food Stamp, Special Milk, and Child Nutrition programs (whether the benefits are in cash or in kind); both federal and trust fund unemployment compensation and workers’ compensation; public assistance cash payments; benefits to the elderly and to coal miners; and low- and moderate-income housing benefits.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s spending on unemployment and food stamps that&#8217;s driving spending at the margin.</p>
<p>The same deal exists with the &#8216;smaller ticket items&#8217;. Of these <br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-uf1PT7gZamI/Tjh_900F3BI/AAAAAAAAD3I/vh5Khf_3tCM/s1600/spendins_smallerticket.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-uf1PT7gZamI/Tjh_900F3BI/AAAAAAAAD3I/vh5Khf_3tCM/s400/spendins_smallerticket.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>OK &#8211; so deficit hysteria is about, but it&#8217;s misplaced. One could argue for more, not less, spending to get the jobs growth, hence tax receipts, up.</p>

<p>Being that we&#8217;re about to experience austerity because we are convinced we can&#8217;t spend money properly such that we actually end up with more after rather than less &#8230;  which is very depressing to me and defeatist in presentation, I present my new theme song:  That&#8217;s how it goes.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>I just find it fascinating that we will accept the argument that government needs to run as we run our own houses and thus need to not spend more than we have, blah, blah, blah yet we seem not willing to apply the concept that we apply daily in our own household to get ourselves an education, a house, our own business, improvement to our property and self.  We do this all the time because we understand it is building our wealth, and we do it even though we can&#8217;t print our own dollars like the government can.  (Yeah, we&#8217;re not Greece in that way.)</p>
<p>Really, just listen to both sides presenting the austerity program arguments.  Can&#8217;t you hear how disjointed the reasoning is?  Can&#8217;t you hear how selective they are in presenting examples of proof of their argument which is resulting is a totally disjointed line of reasoning.  Ask one question you are told we need to save to prosper.  Ask another question you are told we need to spend less just like you, to prosper.  Ask a third question and you are told we have no money, just like you.  Ask a forth question and we&#8217;re told the economy is growing (more money produced) NOT LIKE YOU.  Ask a fifth question and we are told to better yourself, NOT LIKE WE THE PEOPLE.  Ask a sixth question and we are told to get an education, NOT LIKE WE THE PEOPLE.  Ask a seventh question and we are told to&#8230;(fill in your own).</p>
<p>My favorite verses of the song and why it is my new theme song:</p>
<blockquote><p>I help you and you help me<br />That’s the way the world should  be<br />Tit for tat and give and take<br />Just be good for goodness sake<br />I’ll  pick you up if you should fall<br />It works both ways if it  works at all<br />Hold in your heart the people you love<br />Always thank the powers above<br />Everyone  deserves a share<br />So keep your promise, fair is fair</p>
<p>So gather ‘round me people<br />And help me while I sing this song<br />I’d  rather have you with me<br />Together as we travel along<br />It’s the feeling of the wind in your face<br />The sound of the music they play<br />The  friends you make along the way<br />Don’t you know, that’s how  it goes</p></blockquote>

                                <p>CBS Marketwatch <a href="http://blogs.marketwatch.com/fundmastery/2011/07/12/the-u-s-treasury-will-not-default/">Devalues their Brand</a>. Kash <a href="http://streetlightblog.blogspot.com/2011/07/great-depressions.html">views the carnage</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
<blockquote>Despite all the rhetoric and posturing we see in the media and in Washington D.C., it is safe to say categorically that the U.S. Treasury will not default on its debt after August 2nd, even if the debt ceiling is not raised. Not only will the Treasury be able to pay interest on U.S. debt obligations, but there is money for other essential programs as well. However, there will be some serious cutting that has to happen because spending clearly exceeds revenues.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, quite. In fact, some specific numbers are provided in this column: federal spending would instantly have to be reduced by about $100bn per month. By the end of 2011 federal spending would be about $500 bn lower for the year than it would have been otherwise.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve made this point before, but for numbers that large, anyone who wants to pretend to have some understanding about the economy has to think about macroeconomic effects. In particular, spending cuts of that size would reduce the US&#8217;s 2011 GDP by multiple percentage points. The Q3 and Q4 GDP growth rates wold probably be on the order of between -5% and -10%. Recall that during the recession of 2008-09, GDP only fell by about 4% in total. The unemployment rate would be likely to rise by several percentage points from its current level of 9.2%, to perhaps 15% or more of the US population. Recall that at its worst, the unemployment rate during the Great Recession only reached 10%.</p>
<p>So when you read someone blithely writing that the federal government will not default in the absence of a debt ceiling deal, and instead will merely have to trim excess spending, remember that what they&#8217;re really advocating is a new and deliberately caused Great Depression. And not just in economists like me.</p></blockquote>
<p>Can it really be that bad? Well, <a href="http://blogs.marketwatch.com/fundmastery/2011/07/12/the-u-s-treasury-will-not-default/">yes</a>. This is what Marketwatch allows to be given their imprimatur, as one Kurt Brouwer presents &#8220;in a Q&#038;A format&#8230;what I believe you need to know at a basic level&#8221;:<br />
<blockquote>If we do not raise the debt ceiling by August 2nd, we will not default on Treasury obligations. Nor, will we have trouble making Social Security payments. However, there would be a big drop — roughly 44% — in government spending because that percentage represents the difference between government revenues which would be about $200 billion for the full month of August and [sic] $172 billion for August if we start counting after the first week when the deadline hits. Spending is slated to be over $300 billion that month.</p></blockquote>
<p>Kash is right; that&#8217;s about $100B a month. So how does Brouwer solve that $100B+ shortfall?<br />
<blockquote>The [Bipartisan Policy Center] study projects there will be $172 billion in federal revenues in August and $307 billion in authorized expenditures. That means there’s enough money to pay for, say, interest on the debt ($29 billion), Social Security ($49.2 billion), Medicare and Medicaid ($50 billion), active duty troop pay ($2.9 billion), veterans affairs programs ($2.9 billion).</p>
<p>That leaves you with about $39 billion to fund (or not fund) the following:
<li>Defense vendors ($31.7 billion)</li>
<li>IRS refunds ($3.9 billion)</li>
<li>Food stamps and welfare ($9.3 billion)</li>
<li>Unemployment insurance benefits ($12.8 billion)</li>
<li>Department of Education ($20.2 billion)</li>
<li>Housing and Urban Development ($6.7 billion)</li>
<li>Other spending, such as Departments of Justice, Labor, Commerce, EPA, HHS ($73.6 billion) [formatted for style]</li>
</blockquote>
<p>Oh, he doesn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Now, does Brouwer prioritize payments by &#8220;bang for the buck&#8221; (multiplier effect)? No. Paying interest on debt supersedes even the Social Services. If you&#8217;re looking to do as little damage as possible to your domestic economy (this is our government, not China&#8217;s), you don&#8217;t prioritize paying the interest on the debt (multiplier well 1; those people are liquidity-constrained in a way that coupon-clippers never will be).</p>
<p>And if you want to be a viable long-term investment, you don&#8217;t cut your current investment in long-term human capital (DoE, EPA).*</p>
<p>So what do you do, pay bond interest, or pay for parts and repairs on that military equipment that keeps active-duty military active? If you&#8217;re sane, you put troops on the line in priority over investors whose interest payment won&#8217;t be the source of their next meal or the protection from that next IED.</p>
<p>What does Brouwer say about these choices?<br />
<blockquote>No doubt picking and choosing who gets paid and who doesn’t would be chaotic. And, lots of programs would not get their funding and that would lead to plenty of screaming. Nonetheless, it should be clear from this exactly how much we are spending in excess of government revenues. And, that could and should lead to a sober assessment of what government can and cannot do.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ayup. Government can, if they ignore Brouwer&#8217;s advice, keep Brad DeLong calling this &#8220;The Little Depression,&#8221; keep people employed, and set up future growth with trained workforces and people who are not starved into unhealthiness.</p>
<p>Or it can do what Brouwer wants, and pay bond market investors who don&#8217;t need the cash while soldiers die and people starve.</p>
<p>Mark Thoma should be ashamed to share pageviews with this guy.</p>
<p>*As <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/07/texas-jobs-engine-or-texas-jobs.html">Beverly&#8217;s post</a> notes, Texas notes that &#8220;beginning 25 years ago, the state began significantly increasing its education funding and therefore the quality of its workforce.&#8221;  Conservatives used to see the value of human capital development in creating an environment for jobs, and I still hold to that one.**</p>
<p>**Rick Perry has, of course, reversed this, so anyone looking to start a business in the mid-2030s might do well to avoid the Lone Star State. Unless, of course, everyone else follows suit.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <div>This is why Andrew Leonard (h/t <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/">Yves Smith</a>) gets paid for blogging and I don&#8217;t. He tries to do the impossible: <a href="http://www.salon.com/news/michele_bachmann/index.html?story=/tech/htww/2011/06/28/imichele_bachmann_economics_the_annotated_version">make sense out of Michelle Bachmann&#8217;s &#8220;economics</a>&#8220;:<br />
<blockquote>1) The interest can easily be paid for &#8230;</p>
<p>Bachmann is making the argument here that the U.S. can choose to pay its creditors &#8212; the various holders of government-issued debt &#8212; first, and thus not technically be in default. It&#8217;s an open question whether credit rating agencies and bond investors will accept that technicality. China might get paid in full, but millions of Americans would immediate get stiffed. Of course, Bachmann doesn&#8217;t mention that choosing such a strategy would require extraordinarily severe and immediate spending cuts &#8212; around $4.5 billion a day &#8212; in programs such as Social Security, Medicare, defense, unemployment benefits, et cetera. Economists generally agree &#8212; the negative economic impacts of such drastic short-term cuts in government spending would almost surely drive the U.S. straight back into recession.</p>
<p>Furthermore, <em>a failure to reach agreement on the debt limit would guarantee bond market jitters, pushing up interest rates and raising the cost at which the U.S. government can borrow funds &#8212; and thus end up increasing the deficit</em>.</p></blockquote>
<p>So what happened today? There was <a href="http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/2011/06/3rd-strike-of-the-week-for-the-treasury/">a seven-year Treasury auction</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Today the 7 yr saw a yield of 2.43%, 3 bps above the when issued</p></blockquote>
<p>The WI is where that same note was trading even as it was being auctioned. Which works out to be about a 19.2 cent reduction per $100 of security.</p>
<p>19.2 cents doesn&#8217;t sound like much, but there was <a href="http://www.treasurydirect.gov/instit/annceresult/press/preanre/2011/R_20110629_1.pdf">almost $30 Billion in securities issued</a>. So that&#8217;s $55,642,171<br />that didn&#8217;t get paid to the U.S. Treasury (or $57,433,536 if you&#8217;re counting the Open Market Activities).</p>
<p>Even if you want to be generous and assume—it&#8217;s crazy optimistic, but let&#8217;s be <em>really</em> generous—that half a basis point of that is just a long tail (not entirely unreasonable, but rather generous), there are still $46,376,844 (or $47,869,918) that just got left on the table out of fear of near-term deficit issues.</p>
<p>Not incidentally, that&#8217;s $46-57+  million dollars that isn&#8217;t available for maneuvering to avoid an official default (as opposed to the practical default that has been in effect for almost two months now). From just one of the nearly 300 auctions that are held every year.</p>
<p>But not raising the debt ceiling won&#8217;t mean anything. Michelle Bachmann assures us that just because Social Security/Disability/Medicare etc. payments won&#8217;t be made for August 3rd, it&#8217;s not a problem.</p>
<p>Sooner or later, we&#8217;ll be talking about really money. Right now, it&#8217;s just your mother&#8217;s livelihood.  But at least that money has been saved by those who are investing in seven-year Treasuries.  Maybe they&#8217;ll loan her some of that savings.  Oh, right:
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-6-2WNThnlp4/Tgujbgv_5vI/AAAAAAAAAe4/n61alDs1zMU/s1600/EXCRESNS20110629.png"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-6-2WNThnlp4/Tgujbgv_5vI/AAAAAAAAAe4/n61alDs1zMU/s320/EXCRESNS20110629.png" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>At least we know where they got the money to buy the notes.</p>

                                <p><em>Cross-posted at <a href="http://streetlightblog.blogspot.com/">The Street Light</a></em>.</p>
<p>Absurd news today from S&#038;P&#8217;s credit rating analysts, who have apparently been drinking liberally from the Deficit Crisis Kool-Aid:</p>
<blockquote><p>NEW YORK (<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/sp-cuts-us-rating-outlook-to-negative-2011-04-18?dist=afterbell">MarketWatch</a>) — Standard &#038; Poor’s cut its ratings outlook on the U.S. to negative from stable on Monday, lighting a fire under Washington’s deficit-reduction debate and sending stock markets sharply lower. </p>
<p>The rating agency effectively gave Washington a two-year deadline to enact meaningful change, just days after House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan and President Barack Obama each outlined their plans for slashing debt. S&#038;P nonetheless kept its highest rating, AAA, on the U.S. </p></blockquote>
<p>US debt is still rated as AAA, which effectively means that S&#038;P&#8217;s rating analysts believe there is a zero percent chance of the US government not making payments on its debt.  However, this new &#8220;ratings outlook&#8221; indicates that they now believe that there&#8217;s a reasonable chance that some time within the next two years they will change their mind, and start to believe that there&#8217;s a chance &#8212; albeit a remote one &#8212; of the US government defaulting on its debts.</p>
<p>For perspective, the following chart shows the OECD&#8217;s forecast for the burden of debt payments in the US and the world&#8217;s other largest developed economies.  Net interest payments both this year and next year will be lower than any other major OECD country with the exception of Japan.</p>
<p>Update:  NYT offers six more reactions <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/04/18/is-anyone-listening-to-the-standard-poors">here</a>. (h/t Rebecca)<br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-K8W8YleMGDY/Tay6DArcY4I/AAAAAAAAAes/PglJZXuRasY/s1600/fearmongering1.PNG"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-K8W8YleMGDY/Tay6DArcY4I/AAAAAAAAAes/PglJZXuRasY/s400/fearmongering1.PNG" border="0" alt=""></a><br />Ah, but no doubt S&#038;P is worried about what will happen to that debt burden beyond 2012.  After all, there are alarming predictions that the currently large budget deficits will continue to be unduly large after 2012, even as the economy recovers.  </p>
<p>But deficit projections are notoriously slow to catch up with the business cycle.  When the economy is doing well and deficits are small, forecasters tend to look in the rearview mirror and make very rosy projections into the future.  And when the economy is doing poorly and deficits are large, forecasters also tend to project doom and gloom going forward.  </p>
<p>So let me put up this reminder about how bad, and backward-looking, medium-term deficit forecasts can be.  It shows the US government budget balance as forecast by the CBO in 1993 and 1995, and compares those forecasts with what actually happened.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-dUzjKnEQLhs/Tay6IoTJ4LI/AAAAAAAAAe0/hJrMclzIfII/s1600/fearmongering2.PNG"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-dUzjKnEQLhs/Tay6IoTJ4LI/AAAAAAAAAe0/hJrMclzIfII/s400/fearmongering2.PNG" border="0" alt=""></a><br />I don&#8217;t want to argue that the US has no long-term deficit problems.  It does.  And steps will need to be taken &#8212; <em>when the economy is in good shape</em> &#8212; to bring revenues more in line with spending.  But the current fear-mongering over the US&#8217;s budget deficit is just that: fear-mongering.  And today S&#038;P played a shameful role in it.</p>

                                <p>More on the health-care later, but let me be clear:</p>
<p><strong><em>Congressman Paul Ryan&#8217;s &#8220;plan&#8221; is</em></strong> <strong>NOT</strong> <em><strong>a budget</strong></em>.</p>
<p>Budgets show Sources and Uses.  As <a href="http://cbo.gov/doc.cfm?index=12128">the CBO analysis</a> makes clear, this &#8220;budget&#8221; is no more a budget than Ryan&#8217;s last round of fakery.  To wit:<br />
<blockquote>The path for revenues as a percentage of GDP was specified by Chairman Ryan’s staff. The path rises steadily from about 15 percent of GDP in 2010 to 19 percent in 2028 and remains at that level thereafter. <em>There were no specifications of particular revenue provisions that would generate that path.</em> (CBO, page 11; emphasis mine)</p></blockquote>
<p>This is the equivalent of my current household budget, which is heavily dependent upon winning the lottery sometime in the next three years even though there is no provision for buying tickets.<br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;ll call Ryan&#8217;s proposal a budget when—as, for instance, <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/winning-the-future">Obama&#8217;s does</a>—he specifies Sources as well as Uses.  Until then:<br />

</p>
<p>And, with due respects to <a href="http://boatagainstthecurrent.blogspot.com/2011/02/quote-of-day-elton-john-with-tough-love.html">the alcoholic lout</a>, sometimes a fantasy is <em>not</em> all you need.</p>

                                <p>by: Daniel Becker<br />This is<a href="http://roundtree7.wordpress.com/2011/03/26/updated-secrets-of-us-history/"> very important</a>.  It is a list of all we have done in the world.   Go take a look.  It won&#8217;t take long.  I&#8217;ll wait for you to return.</p>
<p>That we do not teach about this in our schools is why we are who we are.  This list should be a banner which is run along the bottom of every news cast for as long as we are involved in such activity or when a new such action is proposed.  It should be a page in every Sunday newspaper edition for as long as we are involved or when a new such action is proposed.</p>
<p>Most of all, this list and the banner should start with the following words: &#8220;<strong>You have done all of the following&#8230;&#8221;  </strong>I say &#8220;you&#8221; because such actions need to remain personal.   It is always personal.  Yes, you and me personally have done all of this.  Don&#8217;t start thinking that the use of robotics removes you from the equation.  Don&#8217;t fall for that psych-ops.  You, me, we still are the one&#8217;s pulling the trigger.  We did this.  All of this.  </p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />We&#8217;re broke? We have to sacrifice? What do we have to sacrifice, our dignity? Our integraty? Do you like someone doing all this in your name? Your name is on it. Don&#8217;t make that mistake thinking it&#8217;s not. </p>
<p>Oh, it&#8217;s only about the money at this blog? Well, you&#8217;re the private sector, you, me and we. Is this how you would choose to spend your Nth dollar? Is this how you would choose to spend your vaction money, your retirement money, your holiday gift money? I mean, it&#8217;s all extra spending anyway. Gee, you have no extra? Well then, is this how you would choose to spend your grocery money, your heating money (just filled my tank, $3.59/gal), your insurance money, your TAX money? </p>
<p>Is the private sector spending it better than the government sector? How can you tell? See, private or government, it&#8217;s still US. You pulled the trigger. I pulled the trigger by inclusion. We pulled the trigger.</p>
<p>And the rest of the world knows it.</p>

<blockquote>The time to stand up to the budget busting was when it happened, and when members of the list had the power to affect policy, not many years later in an article at Politico. Many on the list were either part of the decision making team in the 2000s that opened the hole in the budget, or supported what the team did.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>So, 10 former White House economic advisers (who, judging by results, suck at their jobs) now say USA is bankrupt from high deficits.</p></blockquote>

<p>There is concerted effort to portray Social Security as ruining the country by being a significant cause of the current deficit , and this is not accidental.  Social Security has been funded by payroll taxes that are supposed to be dedicated to the payouts.  But the GOP since Reagan has worked to cut income taxes and increase military funding (especially with the Bush &#8220;pre-emptive&#8221; wars of choice that Stiglitz now says will cost us a minimum of FIVE TRILLION), and has borrowed from those Social Security pension funds to pay for those tax cuts and military excesses. It&#8217;s the tax cuts and runaway military spending that are choking this country&#8217;s economy, not Social Security.  That fact gets lost unless Social Security&#8217;s income and outflows are portrayed fully.  It&#8217;s a fact that the GOP wants to be lost, I think, along with the overall amount of military and related spending in our budget.</p>
<p> <a name="more"></a>
<p>The cost of treating Social Security as part of the deficit is that workers who have been locked out of sharing in productivity gains will pay, while the benefits have gone especially to the upper class that owns most of the financial assets and most of the military-industrial complex.</p>
<p>The deficit hype appears to be a concerted effort, in other words, to destroy the programs that were created in reaction to the colossal inequities that were contributory causes of the Great Depression and were intended to safeguard the broad-based society where growth is shared and everyone has opportunities that is essential to democracy.  I just found that Robert Reich has similar thoughts, noting that this is a divide-and-conquer strategy built on three kingpins:  the battle over the budget, the assault on public employees, and the distortion of the Constitution. See <a href="http://www.salon.com/news/politics/war_room/2011/02/18/robert_reich_republican_strategy/index.html">The Real Republican Strategy</a>, Salon.   What the GOP aims to do, I suppose, is to weaken the 90% who aren&#8217;t in the race to be the richest plutocrats of the country., and make sure that they secure the spoils for those at the top.</p>
<p>It would seem that the GOP is using this moment to</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Get rid of programs that have advanced gender equality</strong>.
<ul>
<li>See Rebecca Traister, <a href="http://www.salon.com/news/abortion/index.html?story=/politics/war_room/2011/02/18/traister_speier_abortion">This is what pro-life means</a>?, Salon.com, Feb. 18, 2011, noting that &#8220;Morality is on the side of women, on the side of children, on the side of a society that offers aid to its impoverished and to its young and does not discriminate against half its population. In Moore&#8217;s words, &#8216;Planned Parenthood is healthy for women, it’s healthy for children, and it’s healthy for our society.&#8217; &#8221;  The post includes a video of Rep. Jackie Speier&#8217;s impassioned response to the lack of understanding about abortions.  </li>
<li>See, e.g., <a href="http://pol.moveon.org/waronwomen/?id=26177-3577895-L74IWLx&#038;t=3">Top 10 Shocking Attacks from the GOP&#8217;s War on Women</a>,  MoveOn&#8217;s political action group (noting the attempt by various state and federal Republican groups to reduce access to abortions and r;define victims of rape  (but not of other crimes like burglary) as mere &#8220;accusers&#8221;; expand legitimate &#8220;defense&#8221; to permit killing abortionists; cut funding for food and other assistance to low-income pregnant women and families; allow hospitals to refuse abortions necessary to save a woman&#8217;s life;    eliminate preschool programs for poor kids at state levels and Head Start at the federal level; cut funding for services for the elderly poor (most of whom are women); cut all funding for Planned Parenthood; cut all funding for family planning.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Get rid of public employee unions (and reneg on pension promises made years ago at the same time).</strong> The mainstream media has lapped this up like the lapdogs they are.  See, e.g., Wall Street Journal, New York Times stories.  
<ul>
<li>Gov. Walker in Wisconsin&#8211;the state where there is a pitched rhetorical battle to get rid of public employee unions and defund public pensions&#8211;die not inherit a budget shortfall.  Like at the national level, GOP policies are driving the attack on public employee more than the actual deficits involved&#8211;especially since those shortfalls at states are related to the toll of the Great Recession and to states&#8217; long-term habits of borrowing from Peter (their own employees&#8217; pension funds) to pay Paul (e.g., their other creditors or even their wealthiest taxpayers who were spared taxes by the borrowing).  See, for example, Mark Thoma at Economist&#8217;s View on <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2011/02/the-unrest-in-wisconsin.html">the spreading use of recession-induced budget gaps to target unions</a>. Gov. Walker has pushed the &#8220;tax cuts create jobs&#8221; idea, signing various business tax cuts into law. See Walker <a href="http://host.madison.com/ct/news/opinion/editorial/article_61064e9a-27b0-5f28-b6d1-a57c8b2aaaf6.html">Gins Up Crisis to Reward Cronies</a>, The Cap Times, Feb. 16, 2011;  <a href="http://legis.wisconsin.gov/lfb/Misc/2010_01_27_MillerPocan.pdf">Wisconsin Legislative Fiscal Bureau, annual review of the State&#8217;s Fiscal Status</a> (Jan 2010) ( even with the recession and various changes that caused the state to have less revenues, projecting a surplus of more than $55 million at the end of the 2009-2011 biennium which, though below the statutory surplus of $65 million required, means that the state was still doing well); <a href="http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/114944994.html">Walker Signs 2 More Business Incentive Bills</a>, Journal Sentinel, Jan. 31, 2011.  Exacerbating the shortfall created by the tax cuts, the state has about $260 million of unfunded obligations&#8211; from taking $200 million out of a dedicated fund for general fund purposes and from an unpaid obligation to Minnesota under a tax reciprocity agreement (an obligation that is earning interest at more than $4000 a day).  So the public employees aren&#8217;t the cause of the state&#8217;s problems.  </li>
<li>This is particularly worrisome for higher education.  See <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2011/02/14/wisconsin_governor_seeks_major_cuts_in_faculty_benefits_and_union_rights">Inside Higher Education story </a>on impact on Wisconsin academics.  These attempts to hit public employees generally start with some of the studies that suggest that public employees have better benefits than private employees.  As noted in earlier posts, that is debatable.  Commensurability is a problem, since many state and federal government jobs require higher education and experience levels.  Wages are negotiated  in exchange for better long-term benefits, which the states are now talking about reneging on.  It&#8217;s as though the private industry owners wrote the following script based on this &#8220;time to get even&#8221; rationale. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>for years, we have underpaid our workers while keeping all the productivity gains for ourselves and paying ourselves knock-out pension and health benefits. </p>
<p>We&#8217;ve made sure that workers couldn&#8217;t unionize, by spending lobbying dollars to fight fair systems (like carch-check) and using all the powers of the employer to intimidate workers (see, e.g., Wal-Mart&#8217;s long history of unfair labor practices).   </p>
<p>Now it is clear that unions do benefit workers&#8211;just look at the fact that public employees have decent wages and benefits because they are able to bargain collectively with a decent employer that doesn&#8217;t use these methods to squelch workers. </p>
<p>We&#8217;ve got to stop that&#8211;let&#8217;s paint a picture of underpaid private workers who have very little in benefits, in order to incite jealousy of public workers. </p>
<p>Then we can use the deficit that we created by evading taxes, lobbying for tax cuts, and charging ridiciulous amounts for contracts through the military-industrial-banking complex to justify taking away both the benefits that public employees long ago gave up wages to receive and the collective bargaining rights that allowed them to get decent wages and benefits.</p>
<p>After all, the alternative would be for workers in our industries to realize that they&#8217;ve been cheated by not sharing in productivity and not being permitted to unionize. </p>
<p>We can&#8217;t have that&#8211;they might get some share of the wealth that has been increasingly accruing to us. </p>
<p>And we deserve all that wealth, because we&#8217;ve run our companies so well by making sure that they can&#8217;t unionize and that workers understand that they, not us, are expendable.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hamstring or get rid of the EPA</strong> &#8211;The script here sounds very familiar.  We can&#8217;t have the EPA regulating carbon dioxide.  That would cut back on our profits.  So what if we are contributing the the rapidly accelerating global warming debacle.  We just can&#8217;t have environmental safeguards preventing us from making a killing (in more than one way) with oil and ore.  If we want to use highly toxic chemicals in fracturing rock to extract gas, we should be able to do it.  That&#8217;s the free market we believe in.  Free for us, risky for those who have to clean up after us (remember the Great Recession and TARP&#8211;same thing). </li>
<li><strong>Get rid of public broadcasting.</strong>  Public Broadcasting has provided a voice for diverse perspectives in local communities that otherwise are completely left out of commercial media for lack of the funding to buy a way in.  But that voice is not necessarily monotonal&#8211;it often has religious or conservative perspectives, but it also permits liberal or atheistic perspectives.  So call up the script again, which in this case might go something like this&#8211;hey, we&#8217;ve allowed media companies to consolidate so that most are owned by a very few media conglomerates (Rupert Murdoch, SONY, Sinclair, etc.).  That&#8217;s great for us, because it permits us to control the way things are cast.  Look at how Murdoch has made even the conservative Wall Street Journal a right-wing rag on our side&#8211;not just the op-ed pages anymore, but the way the stories are chosen and cast.  PBS, on the other hand, stillmanages to show some leftie stuff&#8211;even with the fear we&#8217;ve put into them with Ken Tomlinson and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting&#8217;s requirement of balance.  (We know that there isn&#8217;t always a right-wing side that&#8217;s worth covering, but no matter&#8211;they MUST adopt the Fox News view of &#8220;fair and balanced&#8221; or funding will cease.  Better still, let&#8217;s just cease the funding anyway.  Bill Moyers and his ilk is a threat to every multinational corporation that is attempting to protect its hordes of cash from the US treasury by offshoring jobs and offshoring all intangible rights.</li>
</ul>
<p>Gail Collins notes the same mentality when she discusses the way Congress &#8220;saved&#8221; the Defense Department&#8217;s budget to sponsor Nascar racers.  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/19/opinion/19collins.html">Sacred Cows, Angry Birds</a>, New York Times, Feb 19, 2011.  Yes, that&#8217;s right&#8211;Defense wanted to torpedo the funding, but Congress found it was too important to woo Nascar fans to the military-industrial complex way of thinking.  They refused to cutit. </p>
<p>The newly ascendant Republicans have been howling that the deficit is so big, so threatening, that no traget for cutting is sacred.  &#8220;Everything is on the table.  We&#8217;re broke,&#8221; said Boehner.</p>
<p>But the table is mainly crowed with stuff the Republicans didn&#8217;t like to begin with.  Family-planning money and environmental protection, but not oil tax breaks or Nascar sponsorships.  &#8220;Sesame Street&#8221; is fair game, ut the Dayton 500 is untouchable.</p>
