<p><a target='="_blank"' href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2010/11/wapo-inaccurately-reports-consensus-forming-on-deficit.html"><strong>WaPo (inaccurately?) reports consensus forming on deficit</strong></a><br />crossposted with <strong>Ataxingmatter</strong></p>
<p>The buildup in the corporate media supporting the corporatist wishlist on budgeting is growing.  First there was the clamor about the Bowles-Simpson road map to conquering the deficit&#8211;depicted as a reasonable, middle-of-the-road approach.  Bowles-Simpson is a neo-liberal/neo-conservative group of people with little understanding of the predicament of the vulnerable middle class in this economy, and apparently as little creativeness for moving the economy out of the stagnation from the four decades of Reaganomics and into a new era of broad-based growth that lifts all boats, rather than just the yachts of the already rich and famous.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a>
<p>Then there was even more clamor about the more &#8220;radical&#8221; plan put forward by Alice Rivlin and cohorts.  Rivlin is another neo-liberal Clintonite who is perfectly willing to sacrifice the New Deal to get the neo-deal. </p>
<p>Obama doesn&#8217;t seem willing to fight any fight.  He quits before he starts, disgusting liberals who understand that a democracy cannot survive based on the kind of &#8220;free market capitalism&#8221; espoused by the oligarchs who benefit from it.  So there is already talk of extending the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy, which have nothing at all to do with jobs, entrepreneurship, innovation, or growth of the US economy and everything imaginable to do with elitism, power, and hording of productivity gains for the G.W. Bush fan club of have-mores.</p>
<p>So it is perhaps not so surprising that the WaPo is already declaring that a &#8220;consensus <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/2010/11/21/AR2010112103919_pf.html">is forming on what steps to take in cutting the deficit</a>.&#8221;  Story by Lori Montgomery, WaPo, Nov. 22, 2010.   Ms. Montgomery takes the pundits and neo-con/neo-lib descriptions as god&#8217;s truth as she describes &#8220;a surprising consensus&#8221; around &#8220;the sacrifices necessary to achieve those goals [of less debt and smaller government]&#8221; being &#8220;Big cuts at the Pentagon. Higher taxes, including those on home ownership and health care. Smaller Social Security checks and higher Medicare premiums.&#8221;  Once again, the neo-con faction has used its corporate-owned media to hone its message that there is no choice (false note of sadness) but to cut those deficit-causing &#8220;entitlements&#8221; like Social Security and Medicare. </p>
<p>The awful deed is required, she suggests, to avoid a &#8220;European-style debt crisis.&#8221; No real analysis is there.  Once again we see the proof in the pudding: the corporate media has discovered that it can deliver press releases and paid interpretations of events much more cheaply than it can do investigative journalism with smart journalists paid a decent salary and provided decent benefits.  Infotainment, not news; opinion, not facts; rehashing of partisan positions, not analysis. </p>
<ul>
<li> No mention of the fact that the Euro zone nations do not have monetary sovereignty.  The story ends with the scare-tactice line (from a Republican strategist, so part of the framing intended to make it acceptable to cut Medicare and Social Security while providing more tax cuts to the wealthy) &#8220;if we don&#8217;t act [to cut the deficit], we will be Greece.&#8221;  That&#8217;s simply not true.  We are not in the same position as Greece.  We need to do some things, but we have many more choices than Greece (though the Republican path of tax cuts for the wealthy and spending increases on programs that benefit big corporate interests tend to reduce those choices).  While I don&#8217;t entirely agree with the monetarists who want us to print our way out of debt and deficits, there is some basis for printing more dollars to meet national needs, stimulate the economy, and avoid more borrowing.  That is not an option for Greece.  </li>
<li>No analysis of the tax proposals&#8211;lower rates even with closing some loopholes will generally mean more of the burden is passed to the middle class and taken from the wealthy.  Merely repeats the Republican notion that lower tax rates lead to economic growth (they don&#8217;t&#8211;just look at the historic pattern of growth and tax rates&#8211;we have higher growth when we have higher rates, likely because it leads to better allocation of resources). </li>
<li>No mention of the fact that the health reform bill, when it kicks in, should begin the process of reducing health care costs, or of the fact that a much more cost-effective solution&#8211;rather than cutting benefits to those vulnerable elderly and sick for whom Social Security and Medicare is a lifeline&#8211;would be to throw the rent-seeking health insurers out of the primary business of determining who gets health care and let them make their non-rentier profits on supplementing a national health care single-payersystem similar to Canada&#8217;s or Britain&#8217;s or Germany&#8217;s&#8211;anybody but our failed profits-for-financial-institutions-at-the-cost-of-care-for-ordinary-Americans system. </li>
<li>No mention of the fact that Social Security is not even officially part of the deficit&#8211;that in fact we have borrowed from the funds paid in by workers who are now retiring so that we could create a tax-haven economy for the wealthy and corporate elite or the fact that whatever shortfall Social Security might (but not necessarily will) face in future years is EASILY solvable by extending the tax to full wage income of all workers (and, for this purpose at least, acknowleding that payments from hedge and equity fund partnerships to service partners in respect of their &#8220;profits&#8221; interest are compensation that is subject to payroll taxation).  Social security should be off the table because it ain&#8217;t broke, any future fixing that it needs is simple and equitable, and it has been put on the table by the same monied elites that at the same time work to ensure that their favorite tax breaks and other benefits stay in the system (such as the charitable contribution deduction for the value of stock, rather than the basis that represents the owner&#8217;s actual investment in the stock).  Instead, the Bowles-Simpson right-wing dominated group would reduce benefits for all retirees by redefining their cost of living needs (in spite of the fact that the current formula is probably weighted too lightly on the kinds of expenses that the elderly face, they would suggest a formula that would be even less likely to keep the elderly who depend on SS on an even keel); means-test Social Security (thus destroying the key element of the near universal support of the program); and raise the retirement age (to 69) meaning that some people who get nothing whatsoever from the years invested and many in manual labor jobs would be worn out before able to retire. </li>
<li>No mention of the fact that  Alan Simpson, Obama&#8217;s choice to co-chair his so-called Commission on Fiscal Reform (it should have been called&#8211;neo-lib/neo-con commission for cutting benefits under Social Security and Medicare), has consistently targeted Social Security (and other New Deal programs) as a huge unearned entitlement that should just be gotten rid of or at least whittled down to the bare bones if at all possible.  See e.g., <a href="http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2010/08/group-alan-simpson-sexist-must-resign-for-comparing-social-security-to-cow-with-tits.php">Alan Simpson Calls Social Security &#8216;Cow with 310 Million Tits,&#8217; Causes Uproar</a>, TPM Muckraker, Aug. 25, 2010.  It&#8217;s no surprise that a commission made up of elitists &#8211;including nine Republicans that the Business INsider site politely calls merely &#8220;tax averse&#8221; (see Beutler, <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/meet-18-people-who-could-determine-the-fate-of-social-security-2010-8">Meet the 18 People Who Could Determine the Fate of Social Security</a>&#8220;, Aug. 30, 2010) opts for solutions that favor elites. </li>
<li>No mention of the fact that Social Security funds were <strong>required to be invested in US Treasuries</strong>-(see <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/ProgData/fundFAQ.html">Trust Fund FAQs</a>,&#8221; Social Security Administration, February 18, 2010)  <br />The SS surplus funded US debt at the same time that huge tax cuts were enacted in favor of corporate and wealthy elites, but now the neo-con/neo-lib move to decrease benefits is essentially a call to reneg on commitments made to those that funded the surplus and borrowing. </li>
<li>No mention of the fact that most of the Bowles-Simpson crew held pre-determined positions that favored reducing the programs that help the poor and vulnerable (see Beutler, <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/meet-18-people-who-could-determine-the-fate-of-social-security-2010-8">Meet the 18 People Who Could Determine the Fate of Social Security</a>&#8220;, Aug. 30, 2010) :
<ul>
<li>Bowles himself, a Wall Streeter Clintonite Dem who was not very strongly against privatization when he was chief of staff; </li>
<li>Simpson, who has supported privatization and benefit cuts to Social Security for deaces, </li>
<li>Rivlin, another bank-friendly Clintonite who has long argued for cutting Social Security benefits; </li>
<li>Stern, a former President of the SEIU who has supported the idea of investing Social Security funds in the stock market rather than in US Treasuries; </li>
<li>Cote, Republican CEO of Honeywell who has advocated cuts for military servicemen and women rather than defense contractors like Honeywell;  </li>
<li>Fudge, an Obama supporter who has been in business at Kraft Foods and Young &#038; Rubicam (so is likely to support business friendly solutions whether they are good for the vulnerable or not) </li>
<li>Paul Ryan, Republican advocate of austerity budgeting, Social Security privatization, and Medicare vouchers </li>
<li>Jeb Hensarling, Republican advocate of austerity budgeting and privatization and cuts for Social Security and Medicare </li>
<li>Dave Camp, Michigan Republican that wants tax cuts, and Social Security privatization </li>
<li>Judd Gregg, Republican interested in raising retirement age to 70, privatizating Social Security, shrinking government by &#8220;starving the beast&#8221;, and yet doesn&#8217;t think tax cuts should be offset </li>
<li> Tom Coburn, Republican from Oklahoma  who says he&#8217;s &#8220;open to everything if it gets us where we need to go&#8221; regarding the commission&#8217;s deficit reduction aims, BUT hypocritically opposes not providing an additional tax cut for the wealthy.  Coburn wants to &#8220;dismantle large segments of the federal government&#8221; and wants all options on the table except preserving current structure and benefits or increasing SS taxes (on the wealthy).  He also wants to cut pay and benefits for military dependents, retirees and survivors.  Funny, he doesn&#8217;t mention generals or defense contractors.  Coburn has consistently worked to eliminate the New Deal programs oriented towards the ordinary and middle class folks. </li>
<li>Mike Crapo, Republican who wants to privatize Social Security and reduce benefits for anyone born after Jan.1, 1950. </li>
<li>John Spratt, blue-dog Democrat who has long advocated  changes to Social Security, including supplementing SS with private plans </li>
<li>Xavier Becerra, democrat who may actually oppose changing Social Security </li>
<li>Jan Schakowsky, progressive democrat who opposes entitlement cuts and fought for the public option </li>
<li>Kent Conrad, Democratic budget hawk who opposed the public option, supports passing new tax cuts that extend the Bush cuts for everybody, though arguing for tax increases eventually </li>
<li>Max Baucus, Democrat who supported Bush tax cuts (imagine where we might be if he had fought instead for ordinary Americans) and has consistently supported decimating the estate tax and has supported the idea of Social Security cuts </li>
<li>Dick Durbin, a progressive Democrat who nonetheless has been open to cutting Social Security</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>No analysis is there.  What Montgomery puts forward as supporting the idea of a national consensus is the Bowles-Simpson vague statement of a roadmap; the Rivlin-Domenici panel, another neo-lib/neo-con dominated group whose prescriptions are predictable; Frank Keating, a Republican who wants lower income-tax rates and a national sales tax (perfect for the wealthy in passing the burden of taxation to the middle class); and retired military officers and national security experts who agree that the hugely bloated Pentagon budget can be reduced (can&#8217;t we ALL agree on that one?).  That&#8217;s a national consensus?  I don&#8217;t think so.</p>
<p>Regretably, she ends with a quote from Domenici (not a moderate by any means) saying that the fact that there is some common ground about cuts and tax increases among this disparate group  is &#8220;&#8216;a testament to the moderate nature&#8217; of the ideas under discussion&#8221;.  No&#8211;it is a testament to the ability of one view to dominate the media and to be presented as a growing consensus on the need to cut the welfare programs that are the backbone of the New Deal, in order to frame the discussion in a way that pushes it towards a single conclusion.</p>

<blockquote><p>The Washington Consensus That Excludes the Overwhelming Majority of the Public</p>
<p>A front page Washington Post editorial <strong>*</strong> touted the &#8220;accord seen in debate over deficit.&#8221; It begins by telling readers that: &#8220;the sacrifices necessary to achieve those goals are coming into sharp focus.&#8221;</p>
<p>Included in the Post&#8217;s list of sacrifices are cuts to Social Security. It never mentions the fact that poll after poll continue to show that the vast majority of the public strongly opposes cuts to Social Security. It is only the select group of Washington insiders that the Post chose to cite that is agreeing on the &#8220;sacrifices necessary.&#8221;<br /><a name="more"></a><br />It is also worth noting that the Post did not even mention plans by the Bowles-Simpson and the Pew-Peterson deficit commission to cut the annual cost of living adjustment. This change would reduce benefits by an average of 0.3 percentage point for each year that a worker receives benefits. This means that after 10 years their benefits will be 3 percent lower as a result of this cut. After 20 years the cut will be close to 6 percent. If the average beneficiary receives benefits for 20 years this means that the average benefit cut will be close to 3 percent.</p>
<p>For most retirees Social Security is most of their income. For the bottom 20 percent of the income distribution, it is almost their entire income. This means that the change in the Social Security indexation formula proposed by these deficit cutters would have almost as much effect on after-tax income for many retirees as the proposed ending of the Bush tax cuts for high income households, which would increase their tax rate by 4.6 percentage points on income above $200,000. While the Post has devoted endless news stories to the consequence of this change in the tax code, it did not even think it was worth mentioning the proposed cut in Social Security benefits.</p>
<p>It is also worth mentioning that the Post&#8217;s consensus on reducing the deficit excludes the proposal from the IMF for more taxes on the financial sector. Insofar as taxes on the financial sector are not being considered it is likely attributable to the fact that financial interests are playing such a central role in the debate. A newspaper would call attention to this fact.</p>

<p><strong>Extrapolated September 2010 Debt, by President</strong></p>
<p>Cross-posted at the <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=222">Presimetrics blog</a>.</p>
<p>This one is quick and dirty because I&#8217;m very low on time&#8230;. Anyhow, these days there&#8217;s a lot of talk about the debt, and some talk about how irresponsible Obama is, or maybe its GW. Who knows, there&#8217;s a lotta talk and very little hard facts, much less context. So, from working on Presimetrics, I had some debt data lying around and started with that.</p>
<p>The table below shows the total national debt and ending national debt for each President for December of the year before he took office and the growth rate over that time period. For grins I threw in the President&#8217;s extrapolated September 2010 debt. That was computed by taking the debt in December (in September 2010 dollars) of each President&#8217;s last year in office, and, assuming the rate at which debt had increased during his term would continue all the way to September 2010.</p>
<p>All data is in September 2010 dollars.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Figure-11.bmp"><img title="Figure 1" alt="" src="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Figure-11.bmp"></a></p>
<p><strong>To interpret</strong>:<br /><a name="more"></a><br />In December 1980, a month before Reagan took office, the debt was 2.354 trillion (Sept 2010 dollars). A month before he left office, in December 1988, that debt had increased to 4.866 trillion, which is an annualized growth rate of 9.50% a year. Starting with 4.866 trillion in December of 1988, and increasing at a rate of 9.50% a year would give you 35 trillion and change by September of 2010.</p>
<p>A few things to note&#8230; the two Presidents who added to the debt at the quickest rate were GW in first place and Reagan in second. They were followed by Ford, and then Obama, with GHW Bush not far behind. Now, I&#8217;ve been pretty critical of Obama for continuing GW&#8217;s policies (see Presimetrics, the book I wrote with Michael Kanell, and <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2009/12/obama-bush-mankiw-look-taxes-spending.html">this</a>) but all in all, as lousy as he&#8217;s been, he&#8217;s far, far from the worst perpetrator when it comes to fiscal irresponsibility. (And please, spare me the whole &#8220;the banks needed saving&#8221; when so did many businesses and households&#8230; which weren&#8217;t saved. I&#8217;d be less inclined to carp if the money was spent on keeping Main Street afloat rather than seeing so much flow to Wall Street.) I wonder how the Tea Partiers would react to that information, and whether they are are angrier at GW and Reagan than they are at Obama. Somehow I doubt it.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2010/oct/06/economy-economics">Dean Baker </a>finds gaping holes in deficit hawk rhetoric using the simple accounting identity that national saving must equal the current account (S-I = CA). If the domestic private-sector&#8217;s desire to save is positive, then the only way for the public sector (i.e., government) to net save is for the economy as a whole to run a sizable current account surplus.</p>
<p>Singapore does just that. Spanning the years 2004-2009, the average current account surplus was near 21% of GDP, which enabled the government to run surpluses near 5% of GDP and the private sector to save 16% of GDP. Singapore is a net-saver in all sectors of the economy: private, public, and international. However, it&#8217;s Singapore&#8217;s huge current account surplus that allows the domestic sector to net save, and not all financial balances are created equally.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s use a slightly different version of <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2010/03/parenteau-on-fiscal-correctness-and-animal-sacrifices-leading-the-piigs-to-slaughter-part-1.html">Rob Parenteau&#8217;s 3 Sector Financial Balances Map</a> to illustrate that not all financial balances are created equally.<br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/TLMPnRg3NiI/AAAAAAAADSM/PrVpHpmn5tM/s1600/FBM.JPG"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/TLMPnRg3NiI/AAAAAAAADSM/PrVpHpmn5tM/s400/FBM.JPG" alt="" border="0"></a>The chart illustrates the combination of private and public surpluses (or deficits) that prevail at each of three &#8220;zones&#8221; of the Balanced Current Account Line (BCAL). The BCAL zones are: CA > 0 to the right of the red line, CA World Economic Report database, October 2010, is used to construct the average 3-Sector Financial Balances Map for the IMF&#8217;s Advanced Economies spanning the years 2004-2009. (Note: Singapore, Norway, and Iceland are not illustrated because their respective sector financial balance points lie outside the normal range and distort the map.) </p>
<p>The public-sector financial balance (PubS) for each economy is the <a href="http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/gfs/manual/">IMF&#8217;s measure of general government net lending</a> as a percentage of GDP. The domestic private-sector financial balance (PrivS) is the residual of the current account as a percentage of GDP less PubS such that the following identity holds:</p>
<div><u>PrivS + PubS = Current Account</u><br />(please see <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2010/03/parenteau-on-fiscal-correctness-and-animal-sacrifices-leading-the-piigs-to-slaughter-part-1.html">Rob&#8217;s post</a> for further detail on the sectoral balances approach)</div>
<p>In the chart, the four quadrants of public-sector and private-sector financial balances that account for the CBAL zones across the Advanced Economies are:</p>
<p>I. PubS > 0 (public-sector surplus) and PrivS  II. PubS III. PubS > 0 and PrivS > 0<br />IV. PubS  0</p>
<p>The quintessential savers are listed in quadrant III and to the right of the BCAL: Sweden, Hong Kong, Luxembourg, and Singapore (not shown). The classic debtors are listed in quadrant II and to the left of the BCAL: Ireland, Spain, Portugal, Greece, and a couple of other Eurozone economies that are not labeled (Cyprus, Malta, and Slovak Republic). Finally, quadrants I and IV list economies that have positive saving in one of the domestic accounts: public (I) or private (IV).</p>
<p>The point is pretty clear: in order for the government to net-save, PubS > 0, either the private sector must dissave and/or the current account must be in surplus. It&#8217;s that simple.</p>
<p>Notice that the financial balances of Spain, Portugal, Ireland, and Greece are in quadrant II and to the left of the CABL. These are averages, and the fiscal deficit worsened markedly in 2009 and 2010 as the private sector incentive to save surged. Currently, though, the fiscal adjustment requirements are huge (deep into quadrant II). For example, <a href="http://www.bis.org/review/r101008a.pdf">Spanish policymakers announced a deficit reduction path</a> to take the PubS <br />Given that Spain, for example, is starting from a point of hefty private-sector  deficits over the last five years, on average, the sole hope for a  successful policy tightening lies with external demand growth (the  current account). Spain needs massive export income in order to finance  such reductions in the government deficits.</p>
<p>So who will succeed in reducing their public fiscal deficits? Pretty much any country with private surpluses has a fighting chance: Germany, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, the UK, and the US even (on the corporate side). The problem is, that policy makers can&#8217;t just tell the private sector to start dissaving. Well, it can, but incentives may be needed.</p>
<p>All else equal, <a href="http://macromarketmusings.blogspot.com/2010/10/is-this-really-it.html">recent FOMC announcements</a> furthered a dollar sell-off, and along with recent disinflation the <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-10-10/dollar-touches-15-year-low-versus-yen-on-speculation-of-further-fed-easing.html">economy has a fighting chance</a> if policy does move toward austerity. But as <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2010/oct/06/economy-economics">Dean Baker suggests, more currency re-valuation</a> is needed.</p>

<p>Kevin Drum <a href="http://motherjones.com/comment/reply/72731">writes</a><br />&#8220;The GOP leadership has released &#8220;Tread Boldly,&#8221; a guidebook for Republican members of congress during the summer recess, and it includes a whole section called &#8220;Spending Restraint Solutions for Discussion.&#8221; Finally, we&#8217;ll get some details! So here they are:</p>
<p>&#8216;Canceling unspent “stimulus” funds, saving up to $266 billion &#8230;&#8217;</p>
<p>Being hep and up to date with the interwebs, the Republicans <a href="http://www.gop.gov/resources/library/documents/recesskits/2010-August.pdf">posted a pdf.</a></p>
<p>My point is that they just declared their willingness to increase the taxes paid by over 95% of working US families.  There is no way they can get &#8220;up to $266 billion&#8221; by cancelling other parts of the stimulus and not cancelling the tax cuts.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Notably  <a href="http://tinyurl.com/383zezq">&#8220;of the $787 billion in the Recovery Act, about 94% is either in tax cuts, payments, or projects under contract. &#8220;</a>  Are the Republicans proposing that the Federal Government violate signed contracts ?  Wouldn&#8217;t that be a seizure ?  </p>
<p>The payments include extended unemployment insurance (I&#8217;m not sure that&#8217;s the only payment).  Total additional government consumption (the standard word for government investment too) was $ 265 billion, so one can&#8217;t save $266 billion by cutting the un-contracted funds (about $ 50 billion).<br />http://tinyurl.com/383zez</p>
<p>Of course the Republicans would like nothing less than to have to explain that the ARRA included tax cuts for over 95% of working families in the USA and to explain that they want to eliminate those cuts (as all currently Republican legislators not from Maine voted against those tax cuts).</p>

<p>Projected growth in spending on the federal government&#8217;s big health and retirement programs&#8211;Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security&#8211;dominates the long-run budget outlook. If current policies continue, that spending is likely to grow significantly faster than the economy as a whole over the next few decades. By 2040, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects those outlays will rise to about 17 percent of gross domestic product (GDP)&#8211;  more than double their current share.  <br /><a target="_blank" href="http://cbo.gov/doc.cfm?index=2517&#038;type=0">CBO report</a> ready for hawking in year 2000. </p>
<p>Was this before or after our deficit hawks started crowing in year 2000?</p>
<p>(a figure virtually identical to current estimates&#8230;oops&#8230;2010)</p>

<p>Perhaps if we dismiss the current hawks we could actually address the issue of deficits.</p>

                                <p>UPDATE: Jason Linkins at one of the non-Breast-Enhanced sites of the <em>Huffington Post</em> did <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/07/26/neel-kashkari-tarp-guru-s_n_659423.html">a burlesque of which I can only dream</a> on the same piece.</p>
<p>Via Chris Hayes&#8217;s Twitter feed (and he got it from David Sirota), the following is from &#8220;<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/07/25/AR2010072502755.html">No more &#8216;me first&#8217; mentality on entitlements</a>&#8220;:<br />
<blockquote>While it does not happen often, our political system is capable of making unpopular decisions that are in our collective best interest. In 2008, during the most severe financial crisis in 80 years, Republican and Democratic leaders in Washington came together to do something deeply unpopular: bail out the financial system via the Troubled Assets Relief Program. These leaders understood the consequence of inaction was economic devastation for Americans. Passing TARP was the right thing to do. </p>
<p>[B]ailing out the financial system went directly against our shared beliefs in free markets and fair play.  <em>While the vast majority of Americans did not cause the financial crisis, <strong>we all had to sacrifice</strong> to stop it.</em> Such a cultural violation has angered people nationwide, which makes cutting entitlements more difficult because it will again betray our sense of fairness.</p>
<p>The challenge of entitlements is more difficult than the financial crisis: First, we must reach consensus to make cuts before the fiscal crisis is upon us&#8230;.If we wait until the bond market shuns Treasurys, the economic consequences could be dire. Virtually overnight, we could have far less money to spend on priorities such as defense, education and research.</p>
<p>Cutting entitlement spending requires us to think beyond what is in our own immediate self-interest. But it also runs against our sense of fairness: We have, after all, paid for entitlements for earlier generations. Is it now fair to cut my benefits? No, it isn&#8217;t. But if we don&#8217;t focus on our collective good, all of us will suffer.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve resequenced the above paragraphs a bit, but remained faithful to the argument as presented.</p>
<p>The author:  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neel_Kashkari">Neel Kashkari</a>, who is described as &#8220;a managing director of the investment management firm PIMCO, served as an assistant Treasury secretary during the George W. Bush administration. He led the Office of Financial Stability and ran the Troubled Assets Relief Program until May 2009.&#8221;</p>
<p>His <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/01/business/economy/01kashkari.html?_r=1&#038;pagewanted=print">sacrifices for the sake of TARP</a> are well known; indeed, documented in the paragraph above. And, gosh, isn&#8217;t it nice that he pushes an argument that would make fixed-rate securities—you know, the thing PIMCO is famous for trading—more valuable?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s good to know that &#8220;Me First&#8221; needs to change, and nice to see the Post presenting a prime example of why.</p>

<blockquote><p>U.S. spending on weapons through 2016 likely will grow faster than the overall defense budget, which will have annual increases of only about 1 percent above inflation, according to Pentagon Comptroller Robert Hale.  </p>
<p>“Our goal would be to get forces and modernization to grow by 2 or 3 percent,” Hale said in an interview, while saying that “it’s not a given.”  </p>
<p>An increase in weapons spending will include greater purchases of Bethesda, Maryland-based Lockheed Martin Corp.’s F-35 fighter, new ground vehicles, ship construction, satellite systems and unmanned drones, according to the Pentagon’s long- range plan. Northrop Grumman Corp., of Los Angeles, and Chicago-based Boeing Co. also stand to benefit.  </p>
<p>Some money may be shifted into equipment and personnel accounts from an effort to cut $100 billion of overhead costs over five years, announced by Defense Secretary Robert Gates on June 28, Hale said.  </p>
<p>“Procurement and research are in the ‘gaining’ portion of the budget,” Hale said. “The goal would be to move money from support-type activities &#8212; operations and maintenance, military construction &#8212; into acquisition.”</p></blockquote>

Testimony is public domain&#8230;here it is in entirety.</p>
<p><strong>Statement to the Commission on Deficit Reduction</strong><br /><strong>James K. Galbraith</strong>, Lloyd M. Bentsen, jr., Chair in Government/Business<br />Relations, Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs, The University of Texas at Austin<br />June 30, 2010</p>
<p>Mr. Chairmen, members of the commission, thank you for inviting this statement.</p>
<p>I am a professional economist, but I have served in a political role, as Executive Director of the Joint Economic Committee of the United States Congress. I am offering this statement on behalf of Americans for Democratic Action, an organization co-founded in 1949 by (among others) Eleanor Roosevelt, John Kenneth Galbraith, Arthur M. Schlesinger, jr., and Ronald Reagan. Accordingly I would like to begin with a political comment.</p>
<p>1. Clouds Over the Work of the Commission.</p>
<p>Your proceedings are clouded by illegitimacy. In this respect, there are four major issues.</p>
<p>First, most of your meetings are secret, apart from two open sessions before this one, which were plainly for show. There is no justification for secret meetings on deficit reduction. No secrets of any kind are involved. Nothing you say will affect financial markets. Congress long ago &#8212; in 1975 &#8212; reformed its procedures to hold far more sensitive and complicated meetings, notably legislative markups, in the broad light of day.</p>
<p>Secrecy breeds suspicion: first, that your discussions are at a level of discourse so low that you feel it would be embarrassing to disclose them. Second, that some members of the commission are proceeding from fixed, predetermined agendas. Third, that the purpose of the secrecy is to defer public discussion of cuts in Social Security and Medicare until after the 2010 elections. You could easily dispel these suspicions by publishing video transcripts of all of your meetings on the Internet, and by holding all future meetings in public. Please do so.</p>
<p>Second, there is a question of leadership. A bipartisan commission should approach its task in a judicious, open-minded and dispassionate way. For this, the attitude and temperament of the leadership are critical.</p>
<p>I first met Senator Simpson when we were both on Capitol Hill; at Harvard he became friends with my late parents. He is admirably frank in his views. But Senator Simpson has plainly shown that he lacks the temperament to do a fair and impartial job on this commission. This is very clear from the abusive response he made recently to Alex Lawson of Social Security Works, who was asking important questions about the substance of the commission&#8217;s work, as well as calling attention to the illegitimate secrecy under which you are operating.</p>
<p>A general cannot speak of the President with contempt. Likewise the leader of a commission intended to sway the public cannot display contempt for the public. With due respect, Senator Simpson&#8217;s conduct fails that test.</p>
<p>Third, most members of the Commission are political leaders, not economists. With all respect for Alice Rivlin, with just one economist on board you are denied access to the professional arguments surrounding this highly controversial issue. In general, it is impossible to have a fair discussion of any important question when the professional participants in that discussion have been picked, in advance, to represent a single point of view.</p>
<p>Conflicts of interest constitute the fourth major problem. The fact that the Commission has accepted support from Peter G. Peterson, a man who has for decades conducted a relentless campaign to cut Social Security and Medicare, raises the most serious questions. Quite apart from the merits of Mr. Peterson&#8217;s arguments, this act must be condemned. A Commission serving public purpose cannot accept funds or other help from a private party with a strong interest in the outcome of that Commission&#8217;s work. Your having done so is a disgrace.</p>
<p>In my view you also should not have accepted help from the Economic Policy Institute, even though EPI&#8217;s positions on the merits are substantially closer to mine.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />Let me now turn to the economic questions. A first economic question is, what caused the deficits and rising public debt? The answer comes in two parts: present deficits and projected future deficits.</p>
<p>2. Current Deficits and Rising Debt were Caused by the Financial Crisis.</p>
<p>Overwhelmingly, the present deficits are caused by the financial crisis. The financial crisis, the fall in asset (especially housing) values, and withdrawal of bank lending to business and households has meant a sharp decline in economic activity, and therefore a sharp decrease in tax revenues and an increase in automatic payments for unemployment insurance and the like. According to a new IMF staff analysis, fully half of the large increase in budget deficits in major economies around the world is due to collapsing tax revenues, and a further large share to low (often negative) growth in relation to interest payments on existing debt. Less than ten percent is due to increased discretionary public expenditure, as in stimulus packages.</p>
<p>This point is important because it shows that the claim that deficits have resulted from &#8220;overspending&#8221; is false, both in the United States and abroad.</p>
<p>3. Future Deficit Projections are Generally Based on Forecasts which Begin by Assuming Full Recovery, but this Assumption is Highly Unrealistic.</p>
<p>Unlike the present deficits, expected future deficits are not usually considered to be due to continued recession and high unemployment. To understand how the discussion of future deficits is being framed, it is necessary to grasp the work of the principal forecasting authority, the Congressional Budget Office. CBO&#8217;s projections proceed in two steps. First, they wipe out the current deficits, over a very short time horizon, by assuming a full economic recovery. Second, they create an entirely new source of future deficits, essentially out of whole cloth. The critical near-term assumption in the CBO baseline concerns employment. CBO claims to expect a relatively rapid return, over five years, to high levels of employment, and the baseline incorporates a correspondingly high rate of real growth in the early recovery from the great crisis. If this were to happen, then tax revenues would recover, and ordinarily the projected deficits would disappear. This is what did happen under full employment in the late 1990s.</p>
<p>But under present financial conditions this scenario of a rapid return to high employment is highly unrealistic. It can only happen if the credit system finances economic growth, which implies a rising level of private (household and company) debt relative to GDP. And that clearly is not going to happen. On the contrary, de-leveraging in the private sector is sure to remain the rule for a long time, as mortgages and other debts default or are paid down, and as many households remain effectively insolvent due to their mortgage debt.</p>
<p>With high unemployment, high public deficits are inevitable. The only choice is between an active deficit, incurred by putting people to work or otherwise serving national needs &#8212; such as providing a decent retirement and health care to the aged &#8212; and a passive deficit, incurred because at high unemployment tax revenues necessarily fail to cover public spending. Cutting public spending or raising taxes, now or in the future, by any amount, cannot reduce a deficit due to high unemployment. The only fiscal effect is to convert an active deficit into a passive one &#8212; with disastrous economic and social effects.</p>
<p>4. Having Cured the Deficits with an Unrealistic Forecast, CBO Recreates them with Another, Very Different, but Equally Unrealistic Forecast.</p>
<p>In the CBO models, high future deficits and rising debt relative to GDP are expected. But the source is not a weak economy. It is a set of assumptions describing an economy after full recovery from the present crisis. In the CBO forecasts, big future deficits arise from a combination of (a) rapidly rising health care costs and (b) rising short-term interest rates, in the context of (c) a rapid return to high employment and (d) continued low overall inflation. This combination produces, mechanically, a very large net interest payout and a rapidly rising public debt in relation to a slowly rising nominal GDP.</p>
<p>Even if CBO were right about recovery, which it is not, this projection is internally inconsistent and wholly implausible. It isn&#8217;t going to happen. Low overall inflation (at two percent) is inconsistent with the projected rise of short-term interest rates to nearly five percent. Why would the central bank carry out such a policy when no threat of inflation justifies it? But the assumed rise in interest rates drives the projected debt-to-GDP dynamic.</p>
<p>Similarly, the rise in projected interest payments is inconsistent with low nominal inflation. Interest payments rising to over 20 percent of GDP by mid-century would constitute new federal spending similar in scale to the mobilization for World War II. Obviously this cannot happen with two percent inflation. And although a higher inflation rate is undesirable, arithmetically it means a lower debt-to-GDP ratio.</p>
<p>Finally, rapidly rising health care costs and low overall inflation are mutually consistent only if all prices except health care are rising at less than that low overall inflation rate &#8212; including energy and food prices in a time of increasing scarcity. This too is extremely unlikely. Either overall health care costs will decelerate (relieving the so-called Medicare funding problem) or the overall inflation rate will accelerate &#8212; reducing the debt-to-GDP ratio.</p>
<p>In sum: the economic forecasts on which you are being asked to develop a credible plan for reducing deficits over the medium term are a mess. The unemployment and growth forecasts are implausibly optimistic, while the inflation and interest rates projections are implausibly pessimistic and mutually inconsistent.</p>
<p>Good policy cannot be based on bad forecasts. As a first step in your work &#8212; long overdue &#8212; the Commission should require the development of internally consistent, and factually plausible, economic forecasts on which to base future deficit and debt projections.</p>
<p>5. The Only Way to Reduce Public Deficits is to Restore Private Credit.</p>
<p>The conclusion to draw from the above argument is that large deficits going forward are likely to have the same source as they do right now: stubbornly high unemployment.</p>
<p>The only way to reduce a deficit caused by unemployment is to reduce unemployment. And this must be done with a substantial component of private financing, which is to say by bank credit, if the public deficit is going to be reduced. This is a fact of accounting. It is not a matter of theory or ideology; it is merely a fact. The only way to grow out of our deficit is to cure the financial crisis.</p>
<p>To cure the financial crisis would require two comprehensive measures. The first is debt restructuring for the entire household sector, to restore private borrowing power. The second is a reconstruction of the banking system, effectively purging the toxic assets from bank balance sheets and also reforming the bank personnel and compensation and other practices that produced the financial crisis in the first place. To repeat: this is the only way to generate deficit-reducing, privately-funded growth and employment.</p>
<p>As a former top adviser in the Clinton White House, co-chairman Bowles no doubt knows that privately-funded economic growth produced the boom years of the late 1990s and the associated surplus in the federal budget. He must also know that the practices of banks and investment banks with which they were closely associated worked to destroy the financial system a decade later. But I would wager that the Commission has spent no time, so far, on a discussion of the relationship between deficit reduction and financial reform.</p>
<p>To be clear: unemployment can be cured without private-sector financing, if public deficits are large enough &#8212; as was done during World War II. But if the objective is to reduce public deficits, for whatever reason, then a large contribution from private credit is essential.</p>
<p>One more time: without private credit, deficit reduction plans through fiscal austerity, now or in the future, will fail. They cannot succeed. If at the time the cuts take effect the economy is still relying on public expenditure to fund economic activity, then reducing expenditure (or increasing taxes) will simply reduce GDP and the deficits will not go away.</p>
<p>Further, if the finances of the private sector could be fixed, then an austerity program would be entirely unnecessary to reduce public debt. The entire national experience from 1946 to 1980, when public debt fell from 121 to about 33 percent of GDP and again from 1994 to 2000, proves this. In those years the debt-to-GDP ratio fell mainly because of creditdriven economic growth &#8212; certainly not because of public-sector austerity programs. And this is why the deficits returned, in 1980-2 and in 2000, once the credit markets froze up and the private economy entered recession.</p>
<p>Thus until the private financial sector is fully reformed &#8212; or supplemented by parallel financing institutions as was done in the New Deal &#8212; high deficits and a high public-debt-to-GDP ratio are inevitable. In the limit, if there is no private financial recovery, debt-to-GDP will converge to some steady-state value, probably near 100 percent &#8211; a normal number in some countries &#8211; and at that point the public deficit will be the sole engine of new economic growth going forward. Only when the private sector steps up, will the debt-to-GDP ratio begin to decline.</p>
<p>For this reason, a Commission report focused on &#8220;entitlement reform&#8221; rather than &#8220;financial reform&#8221; would be entirely beside the point. Entitlement cuts, no matter how severe, cannot and will not achieve deficit reduction. They cannot &#8220;meaningfully improve the long-term fiscal outlook,&#8221; as required by your charter. All they will accomplish is to impoverish vulnerable Americans, impairing the functioning of the private economy and the taxing capacity of the government.</p>
<p>6. Social Security and Medicare &#8220;Solvency&#8221; is not part of the Commission&#8217;s Mandate.</p>
<p>I note from Chairman Simpson&#8217;s conversation with Alex Lawson that the Commission has taken up the questions of the alleged &#8220;insolvency&#8221; of the Social Security system and of Medicare. If true, this is far outside any mandate of the Commission. Your mandate is strictly limited to matters relating to the deficit, debt-to-GDP ratio and fiscal stability of the U.S. Government as a whole. Social Security and Medicare are part of the government as a whole, so it is within your mandate to discuss those programs &#8212; but only in that context.</p>
<p>To make recommendations about the matching of benefits to payroll taxes &#8212; now or in the future &#8212; would be totally inappropriate. Within your mandate, the levels of payroll taxes and of Social Security benefits are relevant only insofar as they influence the current and future fiscal position of the government as a whole. Their relationship to each other is not relevant. You are not a &#8220;Social Security Commission&#8221; and there is no provision in your Charter for a separate discussion of the alleged financial condition of either program taken on its own. Such discussions, if they are occurring, should be subjected to a point of order.</p>
<p>The usual &#8220;solvency&#8221; arguments directed at the Social Security system and at Medicare as separate entities are in any event complete nonsense. These programs are just programs, like any others, in the Federal Budget, and the Social Security and Medicare &#8220;systems&#8221; are thus fully solvent so long as the Federal Government is. Further, as explained below, under our monetary arrangements there is no &#8220;solvency&#8221; issue for the federal government as a whole. The federal government is &#8220;solvent&#8221; so long as U.S. banks are required to accept US. Government checks &#8212; which is to say so long as there is a Federal authority in the Republic. This point has been demonstrated repeatedly in times of stress, notably during the Civil War and World War II.</p>
<p>7. As a Transfer Program, Social Security is Also Irrelevant to Deficit Economics.</p>
<p>Political discussions of &#8220;long-term fiscal sustainability&#8221; &#8212; including in the Charter for this Commission &#8212; make an economic error when they loosely use the word &#8220;entitlements&#8221; and suggest that supposed economic dangers of federal deficits (for instance, rising real interest rates) can be reduced by &#8220;entitlement reform.&#8221; As a matter of economics, this is not true.</p>
<p>&#8220;Government Spending&#8221; &#8212; as any textbook will verify &#8212; is a component of GDP only insofar as the spending is directly on purchases of goods and services. That alone is what economists mean by the phrase &#8220;government spending.&#8221; GDP is the final consumption of produced goods and services, and government is one of the major consuming sectors; the others being private business (investment) and households (consumption).</p>
<p>Social Security is a transfer program. It is not a spending program. A dollar &#8220;spent&#8221; on Social Security does not directly increase GDP. It merely reallocates a dollar from one potential final consumer (a taxpayer) to another (a retiree, a disabled person or a survivor). It also reallocates resources within both communities (taxpayers and beneficiaries). Specifically, benefits flow to the elderly and to survivors who do not have families that might otherwise support them, and costs are imposed on working people and other taxpayers who do not have dependents in their own families. Both types of transfer are fair and effective, greatly increasing security and reducing poverty &#8212; which is why Social Security and Medicare are such successful programs.</p>
<p>Transfers of this kind are also indefinitely sustainable &#8212; in fact there can intrinsically be no problem of sustainability with transfer programs. Apart from their effect on individual security, a true transfer program uses (by definition) no net economic resources. The only potential macroeconomic danger from &#8220;excessive&#8221; transfers is that the transfer function may be badly managed, leading to excessive total demand and to inflation. But there is no risk of this so long as the financial crisis remains uncured. Under present conditions Social Security and Medicare are bulwarks for stabilizing a total demand that would otherwise be highly deficient.</p>
<p>Similarly, cutting Social Security benefits, in particular, merely transfers real resources away from the elderly and toward taxpayers, and away from the poor toward those less poor. One can favor or oppose such a move on its own merits as social policy &#8211; but one cannot argue that it would save real resources that are otherwise being &#8220;consumed&#8221; by the government sector.</p>
<p>The conclusion to be drawn is that Social Security should in any event be off the agenda of your Commission, as it is a transfer program and not a program of public spending in the economic sense. In particular it does not use capital resources and will not drive up interest rates. This is true whether the &#8220;Social Security System&#8221; is in internal balance or not.</p>
<p>8. Markets are not calling for Deficit Reduction; Now or Later.</p>
<p>Let me turn next to a larger economic question. Do deficit projections matter? Are they important? Was the President well-advised to frame the mandate of the Commission as he did?</p>
<p>What, in short, are the economic consequences of a high public deficit and a rising debt-to-GDP ratio, and what (if any) benefits are to be expected from creating an expectation that deficits will come down and that the debt-to-GDP ratio will fall?</p>
<p>The idea that US economic policy should aim for a path of reduced deficits in the future, is shared by liberals and conservatives, and it is, from a political standpoint, a very powerful idea. The Commission&#8217;s charter takes for granted that this goal is desirable. It specifies that your objective is to achieve a balanced &#8220;primary budget&#8221; &#8212; net of interest payments, by 2015.</p>
<p>Yet your charter does say why this is an appropriate goal. It cites no study to which one might refer. It does not explain why 2015 is the right target date, as opposed to (say) 2025 or even 2050. It does not spell out the economic consequences &#8212; if any &#8212; of failing to meet the stated objective.</p>
<p>Does the requirement make economic sense? I shall tackle that question in two parts. The first accepts the view most people hold of the fiscal and financial world. The second reflects, from an operational standpoint, how that world actually works in practice.</p>
<p>Most informed laymen believe that the Federal government must borrow in order to spend. They believe that the interest rate on Treasury securities is set in a market for government bonds. The markets impose discipline on the government. Thus their idea is that &#8220;fiscal responsibility&#8221; will produce low long-term interest rates and tolerable borrowing conditions for the federal government, while &#8220;irresponsibility&#8221; will be punished by higher, and eventually intolerable, debt service costs.</p>
<p>Accepting this view for the moment, what does the present level of long-term interest rates tell us? As I write, thirty year Treasury bonds are yielding just over four percent &#8212; or just a little more than half their yield a decade back. On the argument just given, this must be an extraordinary success of virtuous policy. It seems that Wall Street has made a strong vote of confidence in the fiscal probity of our current policies. This vote is unqualified, backed by money, contingent on nothing. It therefore represents a categorical rejection, by Wall Street itself, of the CBO&#8217;s doomsday scenarios and all other deficit-scare stories.</p>
<p>On this theory, it follows that the mandate to reduce the primary deficit to zero by 2015 is unnecessary. Such an action can hardly reduce interest rates &#8212; neither short nor long-term &#8212; which are already historically low.</p>
<p>But wait a minute, some may say. Yes interest rates are low at the moment. But bond markets are fickle, they can turn on a dime. And what then?</p>
<p>Yes, it is possible that interest rates could rise. But the problem with this argument is that it takes us away from the premise of rationality. If bond markets are fickle and arbitrary, who is to say what they will do in response to any particular policy? In the face of irrational markets, the sensible policy is to borrow heavily for so long as they are offering a good deal. One may say that all good things end, and perhaps they will. But if markets are irrational, then by construction you cannot prevent this by &#8220;good behavior.&#8221;</p>
<p>The conclusion from this section is that one cannot logically argue that markets insist on deficit reduction. Either the markets are rationally unworried about deficits, or they are acting irrationally right now, in which case they can hardly &#8220;insist&#8221; on anything.</p>
<p>9. In Reality, the US Government Spends First &#038; Borrows Later; Public Spending Creates a Demand for Treasuries in the Private Sector.</p>
<p>As noted, the above argument is based on the common belief that the government must borrow in order to spend, and thus that the government faces &#8220;funding risks&#8221; in private markets. Such risks exist, of course, for private individuals, for companies, for state and local governments, and for national governments such as Greece that have ceded monetary sovereignty to a central bank. But the situation of the United States government is quite different.</p>
<p>The U.S. government spends (and the Federal Reserve lends) in a very simple way. It does so by writing checks &#8212; in fact simply by marking up numbers in a computer. Those numbers then appear in the bank accounts of the payees, who may be government employees, private contractors, or the recipients of federal transfer programs.</p>
<p>The effect of government check-writing is to create a deposit in the banking system. This is a &#8220;free reserve.&#8221; Banks of course prefer to earn interest on their reserves. Thus they demand a US Treasury bond, which pays more interest without incurring any form of credit or default risk. (This is like moving a deposit from a checking to a savings account.) The Treasury can meet that demand, or not, at its option &#8212; it can permit, or not permit, the stock of US Treasury bonds in circulation to increase.</p>
<p>So long as U.S. banks are required to accept U.S. government checks &#8212; which is to say so long as the Republic exists &#8212; then the government can and does spend without borrowing, if it chooses to do so. And if it chooses to issue Treasuries to meet the demand, it can do that as well. There is never a shortfall of demand for Treasury bonds; Treasury auctions do not fail.</p>
<p>In the real world, the government creates demand for bonds by spending above the level drained by taxation from the system. The extent to which those bonds are held locally, or abroad (another common source of worry) depends on the US current account deficit. This also has nothing to do with approval or disapproval by foreign bankers, central bankers, or their governments of American deficit policy. A foreign country cannot acquire a US Treasury bond unless someone outside the United States has acquired dollars to pay for them, which is generally done by running a trade surplus with the United States. And when foreigners do acquire those dollars, then like domestic banks they prefer to earn interest, which is why they buy Treasury bonds.</p>
<p>Insolvency, bankruptcy, or even higher real interest rates are not among the actual risks to this system. The actual risks in this system are (to a minor degree) inflation, and to a larger degree, depreciation of the dollar. However at the moment there is wide agreement that a lower dollar would be a good thing &#8212; against the Chinese RMB and now also the euro. So it is difficult to believe that the goal of deficit reduction per se serves any coherent, or presently desirable,<br />economic objective.</p>
<p>We can conclude that there is actually no economic justification for the target of reducing the primary deficit to zero by 2015 or any other date. The right economic objectives are to meet real problems, not those conjured from thin air by economists. Bringing about a rapid end to unemployment, caring properly for an aging population, cleaning up the Gulf of Mexico, coping with our energy insecurity and with climate change are all far more important objectives than reducing a projection of future budget deficits.</p>
<p>10. The Best Place in History (for this Commission) Would be No Place At All.</p>
<p>Most people assume that &#8220;bipartisan commissions&#8221; are designed to fail: they are given thorny (or even impossible) issues and told to make recommendations which Congress is free to ignore or reject. In many cases &#8212; yours is no exception &#8212; the goal is to defer recognition of the difficulties for as long as possible.</p>
<p>You are plainly not equipped by disposition or resources to take on the true cause of deficits now and in the future: the financial crisis. Recommendations based on CBO&#8217;s unrealistic budget and economic outlooks are destined to collapse in failure. Specifically, if cuts are proposed and enacted in Social Security and Medicare, they will hurt millions, weaken the economy, and the deficits will not decline. It&#8217;s a lose-lose proposition, with no gainers except a few predatory funds, insurance companies and such who would profit, for some time, from a chaotic private marketplace.</p>
<p>Thus the interesting twist in your situation is that the Republic would be better served by advancing no proposals at all.</p>
