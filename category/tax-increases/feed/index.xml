<p>Sometimes a few letters to the editor can restore one&#8217;s faith in the sensibleness of fellow Americans.  I particularly like <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/26/opinion/l26kristof.html?_r=1&#038;emc=tnt&#038;tntemail1=y">Jerry Trupin&#8217;s Nov. 25, 2010 New York Times letter </a>responding to Nicholas Kristof&#8217;s article on hedge funds.  In <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/18/opinion/18kristof.html?scp=1&#038;sq=kristof%20hedge&#038;st=cse">A Hedge Fund Republic</a>, New York Times, Nov. 18, 2010, Kristof noted that the US has long surpassed familiar &#8220;banana republics&#8221; in rampant inequality, with plutocrats in the top 1%  controlling 24% of American income in 2007.  In that context, it simply doesn&#8217;t make economic sense, Kristof says, for Congress to plan to give $700 billion in tax cuts to the wealthiest amongst us for the next ten years and yet not be willing to extend unemployment benefits for the long-term jobless as a result of this recession.  The richest 0.1% of taxpayers would get an average tax cut of $370,000&#8211;no way, Kristof says, that they will hire enough new groundskeepers and garage maintenance personnel to make that a good way to jumpstart the economy,  compared to getting money in the hands of those at the bottom. Tax cuts didn&#8217;t work to create jobs in the Bush II regime, and they&#8217;re not going to work now.  Getting money into the hands of the poor and middle class&#8211;especially the unemployed&#8211;does.  </p>
<p>Trupin&#8217;s brief letter says it all&#8211;as one of the fortunate whose taxes would increase if the Bush cuts aren&#8217;t renewed for the wealthy, he benefited last year by being able to refuse to take out a 401(k) minimum distribution, saving himself $28,000 in taxes but not spending an additional penny.  That was a giveaway for the rich, as so many of our policies have been.  And it didn&#8217;t do a thing to create jobs.</p>
