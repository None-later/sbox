<div>NEW YORK (AP) — A judge on Wednesday struck down a portion of a law giving the government wide powers to regulate the detention, interrogation and prosecution of suspected terrorists, saying it left journalists, scholars and political activists facing the prospect of indefinite detention for exercising First Amendment rights.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest in Manhattan said in a written ruling that a single page of the law has a &#8220;chilling impact on First Amendment rights.&#8221; She cited testimony by journalists that they feared their association with certain individuals overseas could result in their arrest because a provision of the law subjects to indefinite detention anyone who &#8220;substantially&#8221; or &#8220;directly&#8221; provides &#8220;support&#8221; to forces such as al-Qaida or the Taliban. She said the wording was too vague and encouraged Congress to change it.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<h1>
<div>&#8212; <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/federal-judge-terror-law-violates-1st-amendment-233222966.html">Federal judge: Terror law violates 1st Amendment</a>, Larry Neumeister, today
</p>
</div>
</h1>
<div>I wrote about this case on AB back in January and said that there&#8217;s no question but that that part of the law is unconstitutional.  I said back then that the only real question in that case is whether the plaintiffs, Truthdig columnist Chris Hedges and a few other journalists, have “standing” at this point to challenge the constitutionality of the law—that is, that they could show that things they themselves want to do are things for which, under the statute, they possibly could be detained.  According to today’s AP report, the government’s lawyer effectively acknowledged at the oral argument in the case in March that that’s possible.  
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>That clarified that the statute is as broad and as amorphous as the plaintiffs say it is—that there is no way even to know whether certain activities could result in detention (a violation of due process, which requires that laws be specific about what is proscribed), and also that the statute authorizes detention for activities that are protected by the First Amendment, including activities of the sort that these plaintiffs had engaged in and plan to engage in in the future.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>This ruling is almost certain to be affirmed on appeal in the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, based in New York.  But ultimately, the Supreme Court will have to hear the case.  If, as I expect, the appellate court affirms the trial judge’s ruling striking down the law as unconstitutional, the Supreme Court will hear the case, because the Court always agrees to hear cases in which a lower appellate court has invalidated a federal statute.  And in the unlikely event that the appellate court reverses the trial judge’s ruling, the Court will hear this case because the First Amendment and due process issues are just too clear and too important here, and because the law so clearly does violate the First Amendment speech and assembly clauses and (because of its vagueness) Fifth Amendment due process rights.  I have no doubt that the Supreme Court will strike it down as unconstitutional.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>It should be noted here that the only reason that Obama signed the law last December is that it was a poison pill that the House Republicans inserted into a Defense Department appropriations bill that was passed under deadline and that was necessary in order to avoid an interruption in salary to military personnel, among other things, if I recall correctly.  The Republicans’ purpose, of course, was to try to fabricate a Dems-are-soft-on-terrorism issue for the November elections.  As I said in my January post, Republican pols think it’s still 2002. Or at least 2004.  Or maybe even 1980.  Or 1968.  It’s not; they don’t realize that that well’s finally run dry, but it has.  Obama should have stood his ground, although some congressional Dems voted for the appropriations bill, for fear of political repercussions.  When Obama signed it, he said he thought that part of the law may well be stricken down as unconstitutional, and I do think that that’s what he expected.  Still ….</div>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>You don’t have to be a conservative who’s helped coopt the American flag as a rightwing Republican political symbol—replacing the Elephant, which no one under the age of 50 even recognizes anymore as the GOP’s official emblem—to be offended by someone’s false claim of having received a military honor, especially one awarded for extraordinary valor.  Count me among those who both distain the GOP’s appropriation of the flag as its partisan symbol—my late father, a combat veteran, a lifelong liberal Democrat, and famously (among those who knew him) very mild-mannered, used to suggest angrily that the next time a military draft is needed, Congress limit it to registered Republicans—and who find repulsive the misrepresentation of receipt of such a military honor.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>So I sympathize with the sentiment of the members of Congress who voted to enact the Stolen Valor Act, signed into law in 2006, which criminalizes the false representation of having received any U.S. military decoration or medal and which provides for a more severe penalty for falsely claiming to have been awarded the Medal of Honor than any other decoration or award.  But not enough to want the Supreme Court to uphold its constitutionality, in the case in which it heard oral argument this morning. Nor do I expect that the Court will uphold it, notwithstanding Scalia’s apparent vote to do so, in seeming contradiction to his famous vote in a 1989 case to strike down a Texas statute that criminalized flag burning.  (Notably, Scalia and Stevens swapped ideological roles in that case, with Stevens voting to uphold the law and Scalia providing the fifth vote to strike it down as violative of the First Amendment.)  And notwithstanding his joining the opinion written by John Roberts for all the justices except Alito two years ago striking down as a First Amendment violation a 1999 federal statute making it a felony to depict in a video, or sell the video depiction, of people crushing small animals for sexual gratification. That&#8217;s because I don&#8217;t think Scalia&#8217;s vote will be needed.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>I believe that the crush-video opinion, <i>United States v. Stevens</i>, is the more relevant one, because, unlike the flag-burning case, <i>Texas v. Johnson</i>, the purpose of the speech that the statute prohibits is not political, and therefore is not “core” First Amendment speech under the Court’s free-speech jurisprudence, but instead is made for the personal benefit of the speaker. Which is why I expect that Kennedy, who joined Scalia in the flag-burning-statute case, and Roberts will vote to strike down the Stolen Valor Act as unconstitutional.</div>
<p><a name="more"></a>
</p>
<p>
<div>
<p> </p>
<p>Mark Sherman, the Associated Press’s Supreme Court correspondent, reported after this morning&#8217;s argument:</p></div>
<div>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Some justices said they worried that upholding the Stolen Valor Act could lead to other limits on speech, including laws that might make it illegal to lie about an extramarital affair or a college degree, or to impress a date.</div>
<div>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>&#8220;Where do you stop?&#8221; Chief Justice John Roberts asked at one point.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>But Roberts later joined other justices in indicating that the court could make clear that, if it upheld the law, it would only be endorsing an effort to prevent people from demeaning the system of military honors that was established by Gen. George Washington in 1782.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Well, yes.  And had the Court upheld the crush-video statute as constitutional, it would only have been endorsing an effort to prevent people from sadistically crushing small animals to death—one of the videos at issue showed a woman killing a small dog by stomping the spike heel of her shoe into the dog—demeaning humanity, as Alito effectively implied in his dissent.  He said that in his opinion, <span lang="EN">the most relevant First Amendment opinion was one from 1982, in a case called <i>New York v. Ferber</i>.  <i>Ferber</i>held that, even independent of the “obscenity” exception to First Amendment protection, child pornography is not protected speech, because advertising and selling child pornography provides an economic motive for producing child porn, which in turn is intrinsically related to child sexual abuse and which in fact usually involves the use of actual children, and which has little artistic value—and that the government has a compelling interest in preventing sexual exploitation of children.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div><span lang="EN">“I believe,” Alito said, “that <i>Ferber</i>’s reasoning dictates a similar conclusion here.” <u><sup> </sup></u>No, he granted, the government’s interest in preventing sexual exploitation of children is more compelling than its interest in preventing the sadistic sacrifice of defenseless animals in the name of profit.  But the government does nonetheless have a strong interest in preventing the sadistic sacrifice of defenseless animals in the name of profit, and that interest is compelling enough to overcome the strong presumption of First Amendment protection, given that the sole purpose is profit, not art, not politics, not information.  Just profit.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div><span lang="EN">To which I, a dog lover of the first magnitude, and someone who near-literally feels the physical pain of an abused animal she’s read about, said to myself, “I agree.” 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div><span lang="EN">But John Roberts didn’t and either did Antonin Scalia or Anthony Kennedy.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>&#8220;When Congress passed this legislation, I assume it did so because it thought that the value of the awards that these courageous members of the armed forces were receiving was being demeaned and diminished by charlatans. That&#8217;s what Congress thought,&#8221; Sherman quotes Scalia as saying this morning. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Well, maybe that is what Congress thought, but it enacted the statute without first holding any hearings on it.  And Sonia Sotomayor provided some evidence this morning to refute the contention that the lies have devalued the military medals, including the Medal of Honor, have been diminished by the lies of people claiming falsely to have been awarded them.  Acknowledging that the lies justifiably provoke an emotional reaction, she noted that the Court has long and repeatedly held that the provocation of offense, alone is insufficient to justify government censorship.  Her money line?  “So outside of the emotional reaction, where&#8217;s the harm? And I&#8217;m not minimizing it. I, too, take offense when people make these kinds of claims, but I take offense when someone I&#8217;m dating makes a claim that&#8217;s not true.” 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Sherman mentions after the quote that Sotomayor is divorced.  
</p>
</div>
<div>Which brings the question back full circle, to Roberts’ question, “Where do you stop?”  My guess: With a well-meaning statute that criminalizes the making of a false claim to have received a military honor.  Which, offensive as it, does not encourage sadistic killing of animals in order to videotape them for profit.   
</p>
<p>The case argued today is <i>U</i>.<i>S</i>. <i>v</i>. <i>Alvarez</i>.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>* UPDATE: Dahlia Lithwick’s Supreme Court Dispatches report on the oral argument, <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/supreme_court_dispatches/2012/02/xavier_alvarez_lied_about_winning_the_congressional_medal_of_honor_.single.html">posted tonight</a> on Slate, is a must-read.  My take, after reading it: That trademark infringement is now gonna be a criminal offense.  Well, not <i>having </i>the trademark, actually, but saying you have a copy of it when you don’t.</p>
<p>Uh-oh. I better stop saying that that crystal vase in my living room is a Waterford. Y’know, when people ask.  
<div>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Yikes.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> I sent a link to Beverly to <a href="http://www.truth-out.org/problem-citizens-united-not-corporate-personhood/1326497162" target="_blank"> this article</a> which stated <i>Citizen United</i> was not so much about corporate personhood.  Here is her response, and in addition in a later e-mail Beverly makes this key point (intro amended for readability):   <br />
<blockquote>&#8230;that no constitutional amendment is necessary in order to nullify Citizens United, because Citizens United actually was decided on the basis of a purported issue of fact that was unsupported by any evidence and that can be refuted by actual clear evidence&#8211;and that that&#8217;s really the point that the Montana Supreme Court justices were making. </p></blockquote>
<p>and actually much more&#8230;.</p>
<p>by <strong>Beverly Mann</strong></p>
<p>The Beginning of the End of <i>Citizens United</i></p>
<p>The article makes the important point that <i>Citizens United</i> and <i>Bellotti</i>, the 1978 opinion that <i>Citizens United</i> uses as its justification, focus mainly on the listeners’ right to hear political speech rather than on the speaker’s right to speak, and so it is not corporate personhood but instead the money-is-speech Supreme Court tenet that is the operative precept in <i>Citizens United</i>. But then the authors claim that, because no listener was a plaintiff challenging the constitutionality of the statute, the Court had no authority to decide the issue on the basis of the supposed interests of listener members of the public. That’s ridiculous, and they themselves effectively refute it. They say:</p>
<blockquote><p>For their <a href="http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2727&#038;context=faculty_scholarship">traditional First Amendment balancing</a>, on one side of the scale, courts have categorized the speech as either a kind that communicates an idea, opinion, demand, information relevant to democratic debate, etcetera, or a kind that better fits the category of being merely an instrumentality of transactional conduct. (The speech can also fall in the middle between these two categories). The more communicative and the less transactional, the more weight the courts have recognized on this side of the scale. On the other side of the scale is weighed the amount of harm done by allowing the speech. Speech that merely facilitates the conduct of transactions, such as fraud, conspiracy, insider trading tips, pimping and so forth may properly be criminalized and regulated without much regard for the fact that the means for carrying out the transactions may be entirely speech. Money in politics falls within the category of transactional speech, and it also causes severe harm to the democratic form of government. It may, therefore, be regulated and criminalized.</p></blockquote>
<p>One reason why speech that communicates political argument, ideas, opinions, information relevant to democratic debate, is more protected under the First Amendment than commercial or transactional speech is that the public has a stronger interest in hearing, and therefore a stronger right to hear, political argument, ideas, information, etc., than it does transactional speech. A big part of the balancing in First Amendment speech cases concerns the interest of the listener.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />Also, their statement that “[m]oney in politics falls within the category of transactional speech” is clearly wrong. It seems to me that money in politics isn’t speech at all. But it’s certainly not transactional speech. Transactional speech is the speech intended to induce the payment of money—speech intended to induce the purchase, or whatever. It’s not the payment of the money. </p>
<p>It’s also wrong to conclude that corporate personhood played no role at all in the outcome of <i>Citizens</i> <i>United</i>. The majority talked about the First Amendment right of corporations, unions, nonprofits, to have their message heard through mass media—and that therefore they themselves (the corporations, unions , nonprofits), like listeners of speech, have a First Amendment right to have their message heard only because they are deemed “persons.” The First Amendment gives rights only to persons or “persons”. So in this case, it was both the supposed rights of the human listeners and, separately, the supposed rights of the speaker “persons” that the Court found that the statute violated. But either one alone would have been enough, in the opinion of the Court’s bare majority, in this case.</p>
<p>Then there’s this paragraph, which makes no sense at all:</p>
<blockquote><p>First, the Roberts 5 stepped outside the court&#8217;s constitutional authority by taking up and deciding cases concerning election integrity. Maintaining the integrity of elections was a political question of such importance to the founding fathers who wrote the Constitution that in Article I, Sections 4 and 5, they specifically consigned to the elected Congress both regulation and judging of the manner of holding elections. The founders rightly understood that Congress would be far more subject to popular pressure to maintain election integrity than would the appointed-for-life members of the court. Taking up a case and overturning a law that provides for election integrity infringes a power specifically assigned to Congress, thereby undermining the separation of powers. This also violates the court&#8217;s own well-established precedent of refusing jurisdiction concerning political questions. The court followed this traditional rule defining the boundary between judicial and legislative issues from the 1803 decision in <em>Marbury v. Madison</em> until the <em>Buckley</em> decision in 1976.</p></blockquote>
<p>Huh? <i>Of course</i> the Court has the constitutional authority to take up and decide cases concerning election integrity. Yes, Article I, Sections 4 and 5, specifically consign to the elected Congress both regulation and judging of the manner of holding elections. Other sections of Article I, and other parts of the Constitution, consign to Congress the writing of other types of statutes. And under <i>Marbury v. Madison</i>, the Court has the authority to decide the constitutionality of those statutes.<br />They are right that the court improperly “overruled a fully supported legislative finding that private money in elections causes sufficient harm to justify its regulation.” In the Montana case discussed in the article, in which the Montana Supreme Court on Dec. 31 issued an opinion upholding the constitutionality of a longtime Montana statute limiting campaign contributions and (I believe) campaign expenditures supposedly independent of specific candidates’ campaigns, despite Citizens United, there was specific, strong evidence both of actual corruption before the enactment of the legislation, and of a strong public belief that unlimited contributions and independent expenditures by corporate interests (or by very wealthy individuals) undermines the integrity of the legislative process. </p>
<p>The Montana Supreme Court opinion details this. In <i>Citizens</i> <i>United</i>, the majority said they concluded that neither of these existed. But in light of the detailed examples of that type of corruption, and the statement of six of the seven Montana Supreme Court justices that they themselves believe that unlimited contributions and independent expenditures directly corrupts the legislative process, it will be a lot of fun to watch the Supreme Court majority reiterate that they “find” that there is no such corruption and no public perception that that kind of money undermines the integrity of the legislative process.</p>
<p>The <i>Citizens United</i> majority’s purported finding was intended as a finding of fact, not a statement of law—a very big difference, and the reason that, as you know, Dan, I disagree with the legal pundits who have said they expect that the Supreme Court will overrule the Montana Supreme Court. <br />In <i>Citizens United</i>, the Supreme Court simply decided on its own to address this issue and the constitutionality of the part of the McCain-Feingold law that this supposed finding of fact concerned. There was no evidentiary hearing in the trial court concerning either actual corruption or the public perception of it, related to unlimited campaign contributions and unlimited independent campaign expenditures by corporations. The Court’s majority simply pronounced their finding of fact based upon nothing more than their personal views, their own ideology, as if ideology and the personal opinions of five justices is evidence.</p>
<p>In my opinion, under the ruling in <i>Citizens United</i>, which actually is a fact-based ruling rather than a categorical statement of constitutional law, Congress could re-enact a statute similar to that part of McCain-Feingold, and as the law stands now, under Citizens United, defend its constitutionality in court. When the statute’s constitutionality is challenged, the government, in defending in the lawsuit, could parade huge numbers of people—some of them very high-profile. NY Times columnist, Thomas Friedman, for example, has called the system of campaign contributions legalized bribery authorized by the Supreme Court), some of them just ordinary folks from, say, Montana—to refute the unsupported , out-of-the-blue, findings of fact in <i>Citizens United</i>.</p>
<p>Unless, of course, the Supreme Court, in, say, the Montana case suddenly changes the stated justification for its Citizens United ruling, from a supposedly fact-based one to a categorical ruling of law that the First Amendment bars any such statutory restrictions irrespective of facts, and therefore overtly removes this area of First Amendment law from the usual balancing-of-interests analysis. Most people think that’s what they did in <i>Citizens United</i>. But it’s not. The Montana Supreme Court justices recognized this, and it was the basis for their ruling.</p>
<p>And once the Montana case gets to the Supreme Court, and gets the national publicity it will get if (almost certainly, when) the Supreme Court agrees to hear it, the public will learn this. I think the Court will be treading quite close to losing the confidence of a vast majority of the public if it reiterates its own claimed finding of fact from <i>Citizens United</i>, in the face of the extensive evidence in that case (again, including the view of six of the seven Montana Supreme Court justices) that vast majorities of the public do, as a matter of fact, perceive that unlimited campaign contributions and veneer-thinly-independent electioneering expenditures compromise the integrity of the legislative system. And I think the justices will recognize that.</p>
<p>Which will leave them with the choice between categorically rewriting a significant part of First Amendment law, which they superficially nodded to in <i>Citizens United</i> and circumvented there via their spontaneous finding of fact, or instead once again overtly supersede clear fact with their own Mad Hatter view of it. Sit tight.</p>
<p>Beverly</p>

<p>Arguments were heard by the U.S. Supreme Court this week as to whether restrictions on corporate political donations were constitutional or whether those corporations are protected by the First Amendment. Court watchers report that signs are that the Robert&#8217;s Court will so rule with the ruling due to be handed down around Oct 5. I&#8217;ll let those who like battle out the legal issues in comments. I want to know what would then prevent the following wholly fictional scenario?</p>
<blockquote><p>Flash forward to early Winter 2011 when in this era of the permanent campaign contenders for Election 2012 need to start their preparations. For the Republicans three faces have emerged. One is John Ellis, former political analyst for Fox News, most famous for being the first such analyst to call Florida for George W Bush in 2000. Ellis is expected to be backed by millions of dollars from his former employer NewsCorp, parent of Fox News, as well as substantial donations from the Carlyle Group, a privately held corporation with substantial but undetermined ownership interest held by Ellis&#8217;s uncle, former President George H.W. Bush. The other is former Tennessee Senator Dr. Bill Frist, jumping back in the political ring due to his concern about the impending socialization of medicine, but this time directly backed up by the resources of Hospital Corporation of American (HCA) founded and until recent years run by members of the Frist family. The third face is  surprise entrant Manuel G________, a wealthy third generation Mexican American little known outside Latino business, charitable, and religious circles. He currently is CEO of TelMUSA, a newly formed American subsidiary of  TelMex.</p>
<p>On the Democratic side two candidates have emerged to challenge President Obama from the Left. One is Darcy Burner {ed: I said fiction} former Microsoft exec, Congressional candidate, and first executive director of  the American Progressive Caucus Policy Foundation. A longtime favorite of the progressive wing of the Party she is expected to draw strong support from Microsoft and various investment companies owned by Microsoft co-founder and billionaire Paul Allen. A more long-shot candidate is Massachusetts based Peter M________. Born in Puerto Rico he is currently both an executive for Citgo and a long-time supporter of community organizing in cities throughout the Northeast. He has strong pledges of support from Citgo and its parent PDV America Inc.</p></blockquote>
<p>Mr. G and Mr. M are fictional as is TelMUSA, but the other persons and affiliations are real.</p>
<p>Well it is a problem of billionaires, and more particularly foreign billionaires. In this scenario John Ellis would be drawing his support from Australian billionaire Rubert Murdoch, his wealthy family&#8217;s interest in the Carlyle Group, itself with substantial ownership interest by high ranking members of the Saudi Arabian royal family including Prince Bandar. Then you have Bill Frist, drawing direct support from hospital giant HCA, source of his own substantial fortune. And finally Mr. G, a man who works in a direct line for Carlos Slim, the owner of TelMex and the third richest man in the world.</p>
<p>On the Democrat side you would have Darcy backed by two more of the wealthiest men and corporations in the person of Gates and Allan and Mr. M. working for the wholy owned American subsidiary of the Venezuelan government, a guy named Hugo Chavez.</p>
<p>So we really want to turn American political financing over to Prince Bandar, Rubert Murdoch, Carlos Slim, and God help us Hugo Chavez? Would we fill much better knowing that on the other side were balanced out candidates backed by companies largely owned and controlled by Gates, Allen and Frist&#8217;s wealthy family?</p>
<p>And you can make this a lot more sinister. Throw in U.S. companies controlled by people associated with Putin or with Chinese Government ownership interests and you can have a real nightmare. People on the Right blindly pushing to unleash American corporations need to remember that when you get to the big boys there mostly ain&#8217;t no such thing as an &#8220;American company&#8221;. Not anymore.<br />(Update: a reader reminds me that Murdoch is now a U.S. Citizen. This doesn&#8217;t materially effect the argument. The danger is from any billionaire or company buying politicians directly. Moreover Murdoch&#8217;s Wiki bio says he became a citizen simply to satisfy legal requirements for owners of TV stations and not out of some sense of real loyalty to the U.S.)</p>
