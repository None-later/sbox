<p>Len Burman, now a professor at Syracuse but still affiliated with the Tax Policy Center, wrote a blurb for Forbes on <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/leonardburman/2012/02/20/stingy-rich-people-santorum-gingrich-edition/">Stingy Rich People, Santorum-Gingrich Edition</a>, Forbes (Feb. 20, 2012), which was a followup to <a href="http://taxprof.typepad.com/taxprof_blog/2012/02/wapo.html#tp">Caron&#8217;s comparison of presidential contender giving </a>based on &#8220;Romney and Obama vie for title of most charitable; Santorum gave least to charity,&#8221; Washington Post (Feb. 16, 2012). </p>
<p>Romney gave about 13.8% of his income to charity in 2010, and Obama gave about 14.2% of his in 2010. The Gingrichs (with about $3.1 million in income) gave only about 2.6% of theirs in 2010 and the Santorums (with about $0.9 million in income), only about 1.8% of theirs in 2010.<br />Burman professes his surprise at Gingrich and Santorum&#8217;s relative stinginess, given their avowed commitment to religion (and their open claim to religious merit) and the Christian doctrine of tithing 10% of one&#8217;s income to the church.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />But Burman finds that the relative stinginess of the two candidates is about on a par with members of their respective income classes. The group of people making between half a million and a million give an average 2.6% in 2009 and the group making between $2 and $5 million gave about 3.2% on average. Conclusion&#8211;Santorum and Gingrich are &#8220;in the middle of the pack&#8221; in terms of generosity for people of their income level.</p>
<p>Personally, I&#8217;ve always thought candidates should keep their religious faith to themselves. I don&#8217;t think we have any business at all taking into consideration whether a presidential candidate is a Mormon, a Baptist, a Muslim or an atheist. But if they do make a point of their religious faith and present it as a worthy attribute qualifying them for the presidency, then it is rather revealing when those who openly &#8220;brag&#8221; about their religiosity don&#8217;t comply with the most fundamental concept of sharing and generosity in the bible, the tithing requirement</p>
