<p>While I don&#8217;t go to Starbuck&#8217;s, Ms, Rdan does on the way to work, and was told her card had $0 balance this morning.  She had credited $40.00 last week&#8230; it is hard to get a $0 balance right on the money without either forking over cash for the balance (as a reminder to power up so to speak) or having odd cash amounts on the card.  The manager told her there are customers reporting card problems.</p>
<p>Anyone else?   (Comments after your coffee gladly accepted).</p>
