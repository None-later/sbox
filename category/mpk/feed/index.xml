				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Peter Dorman at Econospeak, who is smarter and nicer than I am,* <a href="http://econospeak.blogspot.com/2011/02/are-bosses-always-right.html">boils down the question</a>:<br />
<blockquote>[D]o you believe that managers normally make the right decisions over how to run organizations?</p></blockquote>
<p>If you believe that premise, please explain:
<ol>
<li>Why all those great managers of the late 1940s through the mid-1970s ran defined benefit contribution plans, but their successors—who supposedly are more capable—are only capable of offering defined contribution?</li>
<li>That &#8220;underfunded pension benefits&#8221; are evil, but &#8220;overunded&#8221; pensions led to the LBO (now &#8220;Private Equity&#8221;) movement of the 1980s.</li>
<li>That, in the 1980s, GM being $1B underfunded caused Congress to pass a bill allowing pensions to become fully funded over 20 years—and that most of those targets were missed?</li>
</ol>
<p>If bosses are so good at managing &#8220;ongoing concerns,&#8221; why do they take their payments upfront?  What does—and should—this tell us about discount rates?</p>
<p>*This is a fairly low standard, outside of people who work in finance.</p>
