				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://baselinescenario.com/2012/07/12/the-market-has-spoken-and-it-is-rigged/">Simon Johnson</a> at Baseline Scenario</p>
<p>points to basic fraud on the business practices for LIBOR:
</p>
<blockquote><p>The behavior at Barclays has all the hallmarks of <a href="http://www.journalofaccountancy.com/Issues/2004/Oct/BasicLegalConcepts.htm">fraud</a>, pure and simple – intentional deception for personal gain, causing <a href="http://www.houston-opinions.com/law-fraud.html">significant damage</a> to others.
<p>The <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/c/commodity_futures_trading_commission/index.html?inline=nyt-org">Commodity Futures Trading Commission</a> nailed the detailed mechanics of this deception in plain English in its “Order Instituting Proceedings” (which is also a settlement and series of admissions by Barclays). Most of the compelling quotes from traders involved this scandal come from the Order, but too few commentators seem to have read the full document. Please <a href="http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/enfbarclaysorder062712.pdf">look at it</a> now, if you have not done so already</p>
