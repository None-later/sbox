<p>More on the Threat to Social Security and Medicare from the so-called &#8220;Fiscal Cliff&#8221;</p>
<p>In several posts recently I have discussed the harmful demands the right is engaging in related to the so-called &#8220;fiscal cliff&#8221; created by the original Bush tax cuts (set to sunset en masse), the artificial debt ceiling (used by the GOP to exact promises of spending cuts during a recession along with extension of unneeded tax cuts for the rich), and the ill-conceived notion that the U.S. military should continue to be funded at dangerously high levels that (i) ensure that the military-industrial complex will find a war or quasi-war in which to engage their newest toys while (ii) sucking resources from public infrastructure projects and education that are vitally needed to sustain our economy.  See, e.g., <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/11/the-gop-extortion-demands-cut-social.html">The GOP&#8217;s extortion demands: cut Social Security or we&#8217;ll shoot</a>;<br /><a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/11/if-dems-got-backbone.html">If the Dems got backbone</a>;   <br /><a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/11/is-it-fiscal-cliff-or-merely-bump-in.html">Is it a fiscal cliff or merely a bump in the road</a>;  <br /><a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/11/calling-all-americans-we-face-crisis.html">We face an &#8216;austerity crisis&#8217; not a &#8216;fiscal cliff</a>. </p>
<p>A. <strong>The Explanation.</strong><br /><strong><br /></strong> At least the national media and a slew of bloggers are beginning to provide some background information to ordinary Americans on just what is driving the national discussion of &#8220;fiscal cliffs&#8221; and &#8220;austerity&#8221; demands.  See, e.g., Richard Rubin &#038; Heidi Przybyla, <em>Tax Pledges Confound Math as Obama Seeks Deal with Republicans</em>, Bloomberg.com (Nov. 16, 2012) (noting that &#8220;The $607 billion fiscal cliff is the combination of tax increases and spending cuts that will take effect in January if Congress doesn’t act&#8221; and characterizing the positions of the parties as follows: &#8220;Republicans want to extend expiring tax cuts for all income levels and are demanding an overhaul in 2013 of entitlement programs and the tax code&#8221; while &#8220;Obama wants $1.6 trillion in higher taxes for top earners over the next decade, achieved through a combination of limits on breaks and higher tax rates on ordinary income, capital gains, dividends and estates&#8221;); Jackie Calmes, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/16/us/politics/the-fiscal-cliff-explained.html">Demystifying the Fiscal Impasse that is Vexing Washington</a>, New York Times (Nov. 16, 2012), at A19 (the online article is dated Nov. 15). </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>[A] slew of tax cuts — $400 billion for 2013 — expire on Dec. 31: All of the Bush-era rate reductions; smaller tax cuts that periodically expire for businesses and individuals; and the 2-percentage-point cut in payroll taxes that Mr. Obama pushed in 2010&#8230;.  Also, 28 million taxpayers — about one in five, all middle- to upper-income — would have to pay the alternative minimum tax in 2012&#8230;. That is because Congress has failed to pass an inflation adjustment&#8230;.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>An emergency unemployment-compensation program is expiring, which would save $26 billion but end payments to millions of Americans who remain jobless and have exhausted state tax benefits.<br />Medicare payments to doctors would be reduced 27 percent, or $11 billion, because this year Congress has not passed the usual so-called &#8216;doc fix&#8217; to block the cuts&#8230;.</p>
<p>The biggest cut would be $65 billion, enacted across the board for most federal programs over the last nine months of fiscal year 2013, from January through September.  This cut, known as the sequester, was mandated by an August 2011 budget deal between [President] Obama and Congress that ended [the GOP] standoff over raising the nation&#8217;s debt limit.   <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/16/us/politics/the-fiscal-cliff-explained.html">Demystifying the Fiscal Impasse that is Vexing Washington</a><br />It is surely accurate that our still-weak economy would do better if we do not hit it too hard with decreases in government spending&#8211;especially decreases to government spending that supports the most vulnerable amongst us who need unemployment support in order to provide the basic necessities.  Similarly, it is surely true that some of the Bush tax cuts and the Obama payroll tax reduction are still vitally important to those in the lower 60% or so of the income distribution because of the slow growth in the economy.  We will want to find some resolution to the situation that accommodates the need to avoid a harmful austerity approach.<br />So the Times&#8217; explanation of the components of the so-called &#8220;fiscal cliff&#8221; is okay.  And it is reasonable in noting that the situation is currently &#8220;vexing&#8221; to Washington.  Similarly, the Bloomberg article succinctly characterizes the clear poles of the Democratic and Republican positions&#8211;a Democratic insistence on higher taxes paid by the rich, and a Republican insistence on so-called &#8220;tax reform&#8221; and spending cuts, aimed in particular at the earned benefit and safety net programs of Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. </p>
<p>B. <strong>A Grand Bargain or a Devil&#8217;s Bargain&#8211;How the Heck Did Social Security Even Get In the Picture?</strong><br /><strong><br /></strong> Where the Times article fails is in its discussion of the &#8220;reasons&#8221;  for excessive worry about the &#8220;fiscal cliff&#8221; (if one can really call the GOP recalcitrance to immediately pass an extension of at least a good portion of the Bush tax cuts for individual taxpayers in the true middle class any form of reason).  <br />The Times article asserts that the &#8220;main disagreement&#8221; between Dems and Republicans is merely the question of extending the Bush tax rates for the top 2 percent of taxpayers.  That is a considerable understatement, one that results in part from the way the media reduces complex issues to easily retained soundbites, in that it ignores the considerable disagreement about whether and to what extent there should be any changes at all to the various earned benefit programs. </p>
<p>The  article author appears to operate on an unstated assumption that because President Obama seemed ready to trade off changes in Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid benefits for higher taxes on the very richest of the rich in August of 2011, he will still enter into such a &#8220;Grand Bargain&#8221; to avoid the so-called &#8220;fiscal cliff.&#8221;  Progressives hope, at least, that Obama will not fall prey to those same conclusions: <strong>Obama is now in a position of considerable leverage, and he must recognize that he cannot allow the Democrats to be extorted into a Devil&#8217;s Bargain to reduce Social Security, Medicaid, and Medicare benefits in exchange for the pittance of slightly higher taxes on the upper crust.</strong><br />The article goes even further astray at the end with its label of a &#8220;two-part deal&#8221; as the &#8220;best-case outcome&#8221;.  It claims that &#8220;[m]any budget experts and economists are hoping for a two-part deal.  The first part would extend many of the tax cuts and repeal the automatic spending cuts to avert the changes scheduled after Jan. 1.  But it would be contingent on the second part: a framework for reducing projected long-term deficits by overhauling both the tax code&#8211;to raise revenues&#8211;and entitlement programs&#8211;chiefly Medicare and Medicaid, whose rising costs in an aging population are unsustainable.&#8221;  Id.</p>
<p>Of course, here the &#8220;many&#8221; is simply put out there without any context, so one can&#8217;t challenge the statement as accurate or inaccurate.  The right-wing has a stable of market fundamentalist economists who want to see earned benefit programs reduced, and there are certainly the Blue-Dog Dems and a number of others (like the Bowles Simpson group) who go along with that with little questioning of the ultimate negative impact on quality of life and decency of those determinations.  Overall, <strong>there is considerable parroting of the right-wing rhetoric that suggests that these vitally important programs have to be overhauled, rather than recognizing that it is the factors that lead to ever-increasing costs for medical care in the United States that must be addressed.</strong>  And it mistakenly suggests that there is a consensus in that regard. This is a perfect example of the way today&#8217;s journalists buy into the rhetoric that is promoted (at great expense) without questioning the fundamental presuppositions underlying it.  In fact, <strong>the sequester deal did not touch Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid because there was no consensus that these programs should be reduced.  And the election results demonstrate that there is no consensus now that these program benefits must be reduced, though there is likely a consensus that health care costs in this country are increasing well beyond what is reasonable</strong>.  It is absolutely critical that the distinction be made.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s take these issues into consideration here.</p>
<p>C. <strong>Thinking about the two key components of the so-called &#8220;fiscal cliff&#8221;&#8211;tax cuts and spending cuts</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>1. The Bush tax cuts, job creators, and uncertainty</strong><br /><strong><br /></strong> The right has, not unexpectedly, argued that not extending all of the tax cuts&#8211;including those that amount to significant dollars for the wealthiest upper crust&#8211;will create a dire situation since, the right argues, the wealthy are the &#8220;job creators&#8221;.  There is no empirical evidence supporting the idea that tax cuts for the upper crust do anything to create jobs: most jobs are created by small businesses, and those with incomes above $250,000 make up only about 3% of small businesses. </p>
<p>Others argue that the uncertainty of letting the Bush tax cuts expire on December 31 is itself a dire blow to the economy.  But in the same breath, the media and most members of the Democratic and Republican parties acknowledge that they do not disagree on the need to extend the tax cuts for the middle income group at this time&#8211;the Democrats because they recognize that the tax cuts are still needed at a time of continuing slow growth out of the Great Recession caused by the profligate regulatory and tax policies of the Bush years, and the GOP because they recognize that they have no opportunity for an electoral majority if they continue to ignore the middle class. </p>
<p>Thus,  <strong>savvy political advisers note that allowing the Bush tax cuts to expire and then enacting judiciously selected tax cuts targeted at the middle class (perhaps similar to the Bush tax cuts for the lower income groups or perhaps more carefully selected and without the many corporate tax giveaways) are fairly sure things, so that the arguments from uncertainty reduce to the same-old right-wing scare tactics.</strong><br /><strong><br /></strong> <strong>2. The sequester, military spending, health care costs, and the importance of Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid</strong><br /><strong><br /></strong> Some conclude that neither side wants the sequester, with its domestic spending cuts and military cost-cutting, to go into place.  This, too, may be incorrect and overly simplistic. </p>
<p>Many progressives recognized that we have a substantial imbalance in spending, in which we neglect public infrastructure (roads, bridges, public transportation especially rail and inter-and intra-city rail) and human capital development (funding for public education and for basic research) while pushing money at the military-industrial complex.  The latter step merely encourages the military to find ways to use the military investment it makes&#8211;i.e., more money essentially fosters war-mongering simply by providing plenty of the tools to carry it out through exorbitant expenditures on the military.  <strong>Letting the sequester take place is probably the only way that our dysfunctional Congress&#8211;with far-right-wing/Tea Party dominance in the House and the minority-control rule through the filibuster in the Senate&#8211;will be able to undo the disastrous emphasis on military spending above everything else that began with Reaganomics.</strong><br />Accordingly, a better course might be to let the sequester take hold, too, and then selectively undo cuts that jeopardize sound government&#8211;such as cuts to research, centers for disease control, public transportation, public infrastructure, education, and funding of public pension obligations.  Surely the right recognizes that Americans are not happy when lax regulation results in deaths from medical care because Congress was lobbied out of regulating compounding pharmacies or deaths from bridge collapse because Congress refused to spend sufficiently on upgrading our antique transportation infrastructure or continually falling behind in research on Alzheimers and cancer and the many other modern afflictions because Congress has been so stingy with federal funds supporting basic research at our research universities.</p>
<p>OF course, we know from the election that today&#8217;s GOP sees no problem with cuts to various domestic programs that the Dems (and many ordinary Americans) hold dear&#8211;the right&#8217;s admitted goal since Reagan has been to reduce the size of government, on the ill-founded belief in market fundamentalism that private markets can do everything better.  </p>
<p>But we have years of evidence that disproves that belief, and progressives must start publicizing the absurdity of the right&#8217;s claims about market fundamentalism and the right&#8217;s denials about basic scientific theory.  Climate change is real, and investments will be required to protect our great cities.  Social Security is not bankrupt, and there is no reason that it cannot continue for years (even indefinitely) without reducing benefits.  Markets like medical care simply don&#8217;t work without governmental intervention because Big Pharma, Big Insurance, and Big Med (especially for-profit hospitals, nursing homes but also too highly compensated doctors combined with too lowly compensated aides and other assistants) exercise near-monolithic control of access and pricing, rendering the health care &#8220;market&#8221; dysfunctional, and government intervention will be required to create health-care delivery systems that serve the people. </p>
<p>(Even those who ascribe to Milt Friedman&#8217;s views of how markets work&#8211;views which in my view are based on unrealistic and overly simplistic assumptions that leave out most of the truth of human behavior in order to arrive at neatly mathematical formulas&#8211;recognize problems with the health care market where physicians operate in a structure of monopolistic competition.  In <em>Capitalism and Freedom</em>, Friedman noted that state licensing acts as a barrier to entry that gives physicians considerable market control, thus resulting in rent profits.  Friedman&#8217;s market fundamentalism solution would be to allow anyone to practice medicine without a license, thus creating consumer &#8220;choice.&#8221;  Query whether anyone without considerable wealth would actually prefer a return to those &#8220;quack&#8221; days of frontier medicine where such a market existed or would rather have a version of today&#8217;s regulated system of health care professionals with both affordability and competence. I argue that the latter is both preferable and attainable.  See below.)</p>
<p>The following provides some of the factual evidence for the importance of government intervention in the medical care market&#8211;European and Canadian health care, which are generally forms of government single-payer or single-payer/single-provider care, and Medicare, which is a form of government single-payer care, are both considerably less costly and substantially more universal in coverage than the standard, private market U.S. medical care model.   See, e.g., the OECD&#8217;s comparative statistics on medical care provision in the US compared to OECD countries and Canada, available <a href="http://www.oecd.org/document/16/0,3343,en_2649_34631_2085200_1_1_1_1,00.html">here</a> (see statistical spreadsheet <a href="http://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=SHA">here</a>).</p>

<p>The central problem of our economy is widening inequality. It&#8217;s reducing the purchasing power of the vast middle class on which job growth depends, and turning the economy into a speculative casino for multimillionaires and billionaires.  It&#8217;s also undermining our ability to turn the economy around, as those millionaires and billionaires subsidize politicians who refuse to raise taxes on the wealthy and seek to cut spending critical to the middle class and the poor.  Robert Reich, <a href="http://www.salon.com/2012/11/15/stop_income_inequality/?source=newsletter">Stop income inequality!</a>, Salon.com (Nov. 15, 2012) (formatting changed).</p>
<p>The more I think about this, the more I am convinced that, as Kenneth Thomas says, <em>Democrats Should Just Sit Back and Ride Over the Fiscal Cliff </em>(in a post at Middle Class Political Economist, republished on BusinessInsider.com, <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/what-the-fiscal-cliff-means-for-the-middle-class-2012-11">here</a>) and Angry Bear <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/11/what-fiscal-cliff-means-for-middle-class.html">here</a>. </p>
<p>[The fiscal cliff] is the combination of spending cuts and tax increases set to take place on January 1 based on several different laws.  Estimates of the consequences run as high as <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/rickungar/2012/11/10/the-fiscal-cliff-explained/2/">$800 billion</a> next year, or 5.2% of the country&#8217;s<a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2001rank.html">$15.29 trillion gross domestic product</a> in 2011.  Yes, that would mean a recession, with obvious consequences for the middle class.  But this is only true if we did nothing after January 1, and that&#8217;s not going to happen.  Id.</p>

<p> Romney and Ryan have apparently joined the GOP sore-losers ranks most ably demonstrated by John McCain&#8217;s bitter post-presidential candidate spin.  Romney betrayed the GOP&#8217;s disregard for ordinary Americans in a post-election talk with some of his major donors. </p>
<p>Like his &#8220;47% comment&#8221; in which he disparaged those who don&#8217;t have to pay income tax (but generally pay payroll and other taxes) by asserting that they aren&#8217;t personally responsible and enjoying being dependents, Romney&#8217;s comment about the reasons he lost essentially blames the voters for taking bribes from the sitting president.   He suggested that Obama appealed to specific interest groups &#8220;the African American community, the Hispanic community and young people&#8221; with generous &#8220;gifts&#8221; like health-care reform, amnesty for children of illegal immigrants. See  Maeve Reston, <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-romney-donors-20121115,0,1719033.story">Romney attributes loss to &#8216;gifts&#8217; Obama gave minorities</a>, LATimes.com (Nov. 15, 2012).<br />
<blockquote>Young voters, Romney said, were motivated by the administration&#8217;s plan for partial forgiveness of college loan interest, the extension of health coverage for students up to age 26 on their parents&#8217; insurance plans and free contraception coverage under Obama&#8217;s healthcare plan, which he credited with ushering greater numbers of college-age women into Obama&#8217;s coalition.<br />The extended insurance coverage, in particular, was &#8220;a big gift to young people,&#8221; he said, noting that they turned out as a &#8220;larger share in this election even than in 2008.&#8221;  Id.</p></blockquote>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Similar language was used to describe the reasons African Americans and Latinos voted in large numbers for Obama.</p>
<p>Such willingness to attribute defeat to political bribery goes a long way in demonstrating how out of touch the GOP is with what government should be doing.  There is some obligation for politicians to serve the people&#8211;thinking in the long term and not just for the short term, but considering what kinds of programs merit consideration because of the good they do for individuals and in turn for society. Romney&#8217;s deafness to this issue&#8211;and his view that taking care of the wealthy few is the only goal of tax policy (and probably spending policy as well)&#8211;justly helped in his defeat.  It is terribly important that federal officials recognize the staggering inequality now existing and growing in this country and its impact on all of our lives and the sustainability of the economy as well as the future of our democratic institutions. Romney didn&#8217;t get it.  Obama got it imperfectly.  Given a choice, a majority recognized the difference.</p>
<p>It is now time for the GOP to take off its blinders and get a better sense of how their economic policies and in particular their tax policies have been harmful to ordinary Americans and hence to the economy. </p>

<p>Calling all Americans: we face an &#8220;austerity crisis&#8221; not a fiscal &#8220;cliff&#8221;; we need a piecemeal solution, not a &#8220;grand bargain&#8221;</p>
<p>Keynesian economic theory is the only theory that has gotten much of what&#8217;s gone on in the last few decades correct, but of course the GOP market fundamentalists, in reliance on the unrealistic assumptions of most freshwater economics, still claim that all we need to do is starve the beast more, cut taxes and regulations more and economic growth will take off and take care of every problem imaginable.  In the process of trying to enact their ever-more-absurd vision of how to legislate a good economy, the GOP is prepared, once again, to be the obstructionist party of &#8220;no&#8221;, with Boehner saying no tax rate increases, Ryan claiming that Obama&#8217;s reelection (with exit polls showing majority support for tax increases on the wealthiest Americans) does not signify a mandate to increase taxes on the wealthiest Americans, and the GOP generally pushing for benefit cuts to Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security &#8211;irrelevant to the deficit and actively harmful to the livelihoods of millions of Americans and hence to the economy &#8211;as the solution of choice to the horror (in their view) of cutting military expenditures or raising taxes on the rich.</p>
<p>There may finally be some light at the end of the long, corporatist, Koch-funded, Norquist-induced &#8220;big sleep&#8221; in which too many Americans were lulled into thinking that taxes were all bad, spending was all bad unless on military, and the GOP greed-is-good; let-the-rich-keep-getting-even-richer philosophy was okay.  Alex Seitz-Wald even asks &#8220;<a href="http://www.salon.com/2012/11/14/is_it_game_over_for_grover_norquist/">Is it game over for Grover Norquist?&#8221;, </a>Salon.com (Nov. 14, 2012).  Seitz-Wald reports that Norquist has only 217 no-tax pledgers in the new House and an all-time low of only 39 in the Senate, and contrasts that with 238 House members and 41 Senators last year.  Id.  Thousands of Norquist&#8217;s political arm Americans for Tax Reform were spent on two GOP pledge signers&#8211;Ricky Gill and Lee Anderson&#8211;who were ultimately defeated.  Some who signed the pledge, such as MN Chip Cravaack (who lost) recognized too late that giving away your responsibility to think was an act of political suicide.  Even Senators Graham and McCain have suggested that the time of adhering to a no-taxes-ever pledge has passed, and Jeb Bush, the family&#8217;s current presidential aspirant, says he doesn&#8217;t believe in &#8220;outsourc[ing] your principles and convictions to people.&#8221;  Id.  Even Boehner, after all, has admitted he could support limiting deductions as a way to get more taxes from the rich, even if he won&#8217;t yet say he will agree to tax rate increases.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Robert Reich notes that the apparent GOP willingness to allow some tax increases through &#8220;base broadening&#8221; should be looked at squarely for what it really is&#8211;not generally a way to ensure that the rich pay more and that the poor and middle class continue to get appropriate breaks on their taxes to avoid a renewed recession.  See Robert Reich, <a href="http://www.salon.com/2012/11/14/so_much_for_grand_bargains/">So much for &#8216;grand bargains&#8217;</a>, Salon.com (Nov. 14, 2012).</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8216;Broadening the base&#8217; has nothing whatever to do with the rich paying more.  That&#8217;s because a lot of tax credits and deductions help the middle class and the poor.  If we end the Earned INcome Tax Credit, for example, some of the poorest Americans weill end up sacrificing.  That tab was $63 billion last year.  Or if the &#8216;loophole&#8217; is tax-free employee health care, or the home mortgage tax deduction, or tax-deferred 401k accounts, most of the added tax revenues will come out of the pockets of the middle class.  So when Republicans talk about &#8216;broadening the base&#8217;, watch your wallets. Id.</p></blockquote>
<p>Instead of cutting these types of loopholes that are beneficial to the middle and lower income classes, Reich suggests that Congress take aim definitively at the lairs of tax loopholes for the rich.<br />If Republicans won&#8217;t budge on raising tax rates but insist on broadening the base, Democrats should take aim at the biggest tax loophole of all for America&#8217;s wealthy: the preference for capital gains.  Id.<br />Krugman in his blog, <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/14/the-austerity-bomb/?smid=tw-NytimesKrugman&#038;seid=auto">An Austerity Bomb </a>(Nov. 14, 2012) argues that we&#8217;ve again allowed the extremists on the right to set the tone of the dialogue by letting them label the current situation.  We aren&#8217;t facing a &#8220;fiscal cliff&#8221;, he notes, but rather an &#8220;austerity bomb&#8221;. </p>
<blockquote><p>[The term &#8216;fiscal cliff&#8217; implies] &#8220;a problem of excessive deficits when it&#8217;s actually about the risk that the deficit will be too small; also and relatedly, the fiscal cliff stuff enables a bait and switch in which people say &#8216;so, this means that we need to enact Bowles-Simpson and raise the retirement age?&#8217; which have nothing at all to do with it.  Id.</p></blockquote>

I would like to see more information on plans for future &#8216;unique&#8217; storms and ways to handle some of the unique problems encountered by rescue teams, firemen, and aid workers.</p>
<p>Bloomberg, the Financial Times, the New York Times and other editorials wanted &#8216;to join the band climbing back on the wagon&#8217; so to speak along with some politicians.</p>
<p>by Linda Beale</p>
<p> What natural disasters like Sandy teach us about taxes and government, and why NY City Mayor Bloomberg endorsed Obama</p>
<p> Bloomberg announced <strike>today (</strike>a week ago<strike>)</strike> that President Obama would be the best candidate to lead the nation over the next four years.  See <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/02/nyregion/bloomberg-endorses-obama-saying-hurricane-sandy-affected-decision.html?emc=na">Bloomberg Endorses Obama, Citing Climate Change</a>, New York Times (Nov. 1, 2012).  Bloomberg made the decision in part because of Hurricane Sandy, which wreaked havoc on the east coast, costing many lives and much financial distress.  Obama&#8217;s leadership and willingness to commit federal agencies to aid municipalities and people recover from the devastation was a marked contrast to the Bush Administration&#8217;s handling of Katrina and the utter disregard shown by Bush&#8217;s FEMA executives for prudent planning and quick response. </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>There is a clear consensus among reputable scientists that global warming is underway and that superstorms like Sandy are one of the likely results.  In that context, a vibrant and efficient emergency response organization is terribly important.  Obama has shown that he recognizes this, in the way that he has handled the preparations for, and implementation of plans after, Hurricane Sandy. </p>
<p>Romney has amply demonstrated that he does not recognize the importance of government action to deal with natural disasters and similar emergencies.  Instead, he has suggested that &#8220;private organizations&#8221; should replace FEMA and that many other similar federal agencies should be squeezed down or even squeezed out.  Even in the lead-up to Sandy&#8217;s east coast strike, Romney was assisting with a gathering of canned goods and praising private charitable responses to emergencies, even though such action is not a very effective way to mobilize emergency aid. Further, as Bloomberg noted in his endorsement of Romney, Romney&#8217;s positions on many issues have shifted radically to the right in his attempt to win the election:  “ &#8216;In the past [Romney] has taken sensible positions on immigration, illegal guns, abortion rights and health care – but he has reversed course on all of them, and is even running against the very health care model he signed into law in Massachusetts,&#8217; Bloomberg said.&#8221;  Id.</p>
<p>Anyone who knows anything about public infrastructure and natural disaster knows that charitable groups and money-making enterprises cannot possibly substitute for good government action.  That is the reason that so many in Haiti are still living in improvized dwellings and so many in Somalia still suffer from chaotic lives with anarchy rather than government as their norm. </p>
<p>Obama&#8217;s course is the right one.  He hasn&#8217;t been willing to speak as strongly about issues like the environment and global warming as I would like, because he is at heart a centrist.  But at least he knows that government can and must act in ways that private organizations cannot act, a truth that Romney seems incapable of acknowledging.  That is the reason that taxation needs to be increased rather than merely &#8220;starving the beast&#8221; to reduce the size of government.  Government is just &#8220;we the people&#8221; acting to do things that are needed that we cannot do individually or even through a business enterprise.  Government acting in those ways requires taxes to provide the revenues to support the activities.  And those things are not inherent evils, as the radical right today paints them.  Quite the contrary.  Taxation and government activity in support of the public good are vitally important parts of a sustainable democracy<br />.<br />cross posted and lightly edited <a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2012/11/what-natural-disasters-like-sandy-teach-us-about-taxes-and-government-and-why-ny-city-mayor-bloomber.html">ataxingmatter</a></p>

                                <p>(Dan here&#8230; This one is still relevant.  I let it hang in drafts by mistake.)</p>
<p>by Linda Beale</p>
<p>Romney shows he&#8217;s a &#8220;know-it-all&#8221; who has no real ideas at all.</p>
<p>I missed almost all of the first debate but watched most of this second one.  My quick sum-up of the action was the Obama was straightforward, prepared, and much more energetic than in the first debate.  While I don&#8217;t think he has been a great president, he has nonetheless acted on a number of matters in ways that move us away from the disastrous policies of the Bush years&#8211;fairer immigration actions, more interest in the middle class and jobs, wise action to save the auto industry when Romney would have allowed one of the midwest&#8217;s major industries to rot on the vine, attempting to move the corporate tax debate away from giveaways for the multinationals and towards more reasonable tax policies, movement on health care reform (though still not towards the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-payer_health_care">single-payer</a> option that we must eventually embrace), movement on financial institution reform through <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodd%E2%80%93Frank_Wall_Street_Reform_and_Consumer_Protection_Act">Dodd-Frank</a> (though still not sufficient control of the financialization of the economy).</p>
<p>Romney, quite frankly, came across as an arrogant shell who doesn&#8217;t have any substance underneath the expensive coif of hair and Armani suit.  He constantly blames Obama for the Great Recession that stemmed directly from the failed Bush economic policies favored by the Republican party&#8217;s right wing, the same policies that Romney and Ryan want to re-install if they take over the White House.  He consistently fails to acknowledge that the deficits under Obama were temporary ones caused by the trillions of dollars of unnecessary Bush individual and corporate tax cuts, the Bush preemptive wars, the class warfare of tax policies that favor the 1%, privatization of education and the militaryh, and the financialization of the economy egged on under Bush by the right&#8217;s misguided views of &#8220;free&#8221; trade (meaning business can run over the workers and the environment at will and pay less taxes even while causing more societal harm).  Romney (as Obama noted in the debate tonight) goes George W. Bush even further&#8211;he would ruin Medicare by turning it into &#8220;voucher-care&#8221; that was insufficient to meet vulnerable seniors&#8217; needs, and he would destroy Social Security by privatizing it so that seniors are at the whim of the stock market and Wall Street traders for their very livelihood.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Yet this guy born with a silver spoon in his mouth and with a family of connections to power really thinks that he got where he is on his own!  What a laugh.  And then he thinks that he can bamboozle the American people by saying &#8220;I know how to do that&#8221; about creating jobs, getting rid of the deficit, creating growth, solving immigration, making us &#8220;energy dependent in 8 or 5 years&#8221; and everything else he can promise us.  But he doesn&#8217;t think he has to bother to tell us anything about how he will do that.  Often when asked specific questions, he fell back on his &#8220;The last four years with Obama have been awful and I feel your pain&#8221; absurdity,  </p>
<p>His claim of empathy with the ordinary folks asking questions in the audience was absurd because one only has to harken back to that tape of his disdain for the 47%&#8211;and his arrogant view that anyone in that group was dependent on government and unwilling to take personal responsibility for themselves&#8211;to know that he doesn&#8217;t really give a damn about ordinary folk like those in the audience tonight.  He&#8217;d follow that with another claim that he would fix everything because &#8220;I know how to do that&#8221;, yet in every instance there was nary a specific word about  exactly what he would do.  </p>
<p>One thing is for sure&#8211;Romney&#8217;s view that cutting tax rates across the board by 20% will jump-start the economy is &#8220;nonsense&#8221;, as even conservative GOP economist Bruce Bartlett acknowledges.  See Bruce Bartlett, <a href="http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/16/romneys-tax-plan-and-economic-growth/">Romney&#8217;s Tax Plan and Economic Growth</a>, Economix Blog, New York Times (Oct. 16, 2012) (statng that &#8220;the idea that tax reform will jump-start an economy suffering from the after-effects of a cyclical downturn is nonsense&#8221; and concluding that &#8220;even if Mr. Romney’s plan is enacted as proposed the growth effect will be small to nonexistent&#8221;).</p>
<p>On taxes, Romney now claims that he will not cut the amount of taxes paid by the top 5% but will give everybody else a tax cut.  Note that isn&#8217;t the same that he has said for months on end, when he made clear that everybody would get the same 20% rate reduction (which would give the wealthy a huge dollar cut, and the middle class a piddling cut) and mocked Obama for wanting to hold the upper-crust more accountable for helping reduce the deficit.  He claims he&#8217;ll not increase the deficit, even though he wants to cut taxes and eliminate the estate tax and increase military spending.  He won&#8217;t say what deductions he&#8217;ll cut or what protections for the poor he&#8217;ll keep. </p>
<p>He claims the numbers add up but won&#8217;t tell us what the numbers are.   I think it&#8217;s perfectly clear:  he won&#8217;t say how he can do that in a revenue-neutral way because it can&#8217;t be done.  The New York Times editorial yesterday chimed into the growing list of reputable organizations asserting that his numbers simply don&#8217;t add up, noting &#8220;the many deceptions in the campaign’s blue-sky promises of low taxes and instant growth.&#8221;  See Editorial, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/16/opinion/mitt-romney-needs-a-working-calculator.html">Mitt Romney Needs a Working Calculator</a>, New York Times (Oct. 15, 2012). <br />
<blockquote>[The Joint Committee on Taxation] asked its staff what would happen if Congress repealed the biggest tax deductions and loopholes and used the new revenue to lower tax rates. The staff started adding it up: end all itemized deductions, tax capital gains and dividends as ordinary income, and tax the interest on state and local bonds, along with several other revenue-raisers.    <br /><a href="http://media.bloomberg.com/bb/avfile/r9DCbKWFmKdw">The answer came last week</a>: ending all those deductions would only produce enough revenue to <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-12/repealing-deductions-pays-for-4-tax-cuts-study-says.html">lower tax rates by 4 percent</a>. <br />Mitt Romney says he can lower tax rates by 20 percent and pay for it by ending deductions. The joint committee’s math makes it clear that that is impossible. Id.</p></blockquote>
<p>Note that Romney doesn&#8217;t intend to tax dividends and capital gains at the same ordinary income rate that us ordinary folks pay on our compensation income, so he wouldn&#8217;t even get to a 4% reduction in rates with his version of tax &#8220;simplification.&#8221;  He wants to keep allowing people like him to get a tax-advantaged &#8220;preferential rate&#8221; on carried interest that they get as their compensation in vulture capital &#8220;private equity&#8221; funds that buy up American businesses and load them with debt and offshore their jobs.  He wants to keep taxing capital gains and dividends at the ridiculously low rates achieved by the Bush tax cuts that were a major factor in driving us from surplus to deficit.  He even wants to cut capital gains and dividend and interest tax rates to zero for those making less than $200,000.  (<em>Of course, that group doesn&#8217;t have much of that kind of capital income&#8211;it is mostly the province of the very rich at the top.  One suspects the rate cut for the upper middle class that would apply to is just a prelude, like most of the Bush-era tax cuts, to a Republican push to eliminate taxes entirely on capital income, which Romney and Ryan have supported in the past.</em>)  He wants to cut taxes for the huge multinational corporations and encourage them to continue moving our jobs offshore.</p>
<p>There is no way that such a tax policy makes sense for America.  It will let the rich get richer, when we are already at a point where the middle class is shrinking because of the way big business has grabbed all the productivity gains for the managers and owners and left ordinary workers hanging out to dry.</p>
<p>Reaganomics&#8211;with its push for privatization, tax cuts, militarization, and deregulation&#8211;stabbed at the heart of the US economy.  The Bush tax cuts drove us from surplus to deficit in one fell swoop and set the stage for the Republican obstructionist games that have gone on during the four years of the Obama administration, in which the radical right GOP has cared more about pushing for extremist policies beneficial to the wealthy and the big corporations they run rather than considering what is good for the country.  Romneyomics would be even worse&#8211;right-wing market fundamentalism at its most extreme, with the rich making off like bandits and the rest of us left to scramble for crumbs. Surely the American folk aren&#8217;t going to buy this idea of rehashing the very ideas that got us into the Great Recession mess from the guy who says &#8220;I know how to run the country because I got rich as a vulture capitalist&#8221;.</p>

<p>The right-wing&#8217;s &#8220;breadwinner conservatism&#8221;&#8211;starve the state; support traditional families (only)</p>
<p>Many of us who think about tax and economic policy have been confounded by the tendency of lower-middle-class families to vote Republican, which means they are ultimately voting against their own economic interests for a party that wants all the benefits of the federal government to accrue to the already wealthy, and sets policies to ensure that is true, from tax cuts to capital gains, estate taxes and progressive rates (all favoring the wealthy) to the kinds of subsidies represented by the &#8220;active business exception&#8221; that allows tax free reorganizations to move business assets and jobs out of the country without any tax &#8220;toll&#8221; on the departure.</p>
<p>Michelle Goldberg , a Newsweek and Daily Beast writer, provides some answers to this mystery in her review of Robert Self, &#8220;All in the family: The realignment of American Democracy since the 1960s&#8221; Hill &#038; Wang (2012) in The Nation (Oct. 22, 2012), at 32.  While she finds the Self book lacking in the in-depth analysis that would make it not only a great read but also a revealing informational source on the changes in the American polity, she does note  the  label he attaches to the right-wing resurgence (&#8220;breadwinner conservatism&#8221;) as an apt descriptor of the way social traditionalism&#8211;opposition to gay rights; eagerness to encourage governmental support of fundamentalist Christian dogmas and impose them on others; belief that the only kind of family that should receive government subsidies and support are those with a mother (ideally non-working), breadwinner father and children&#8211;intersects with radical market fundamentalism and its &#8220;starve the beast&#8221; approach to government.  Instead of the paradox that liberals sense between&#8221;values&#8221; voting and market fundamentalist economic theory that supports an oligarchy at odds with most of the &#8220;values&#8221; voters&#8217; economic self-interest, Self describes the way &#8220;social and economic conservatism buttress each other&#8221;.  Id.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>&#8220;[T]he defense of the autonomous, idealized nuclear family &#8216;was intimately linked to the way [conservative activists] also sought to limit government interference in the private market,&#8221; Self writes. Id. at 33.<br />Thus, when two women with children are paid about the same at their job in a daycare center but one is firmly in the middle class because she is married with a husband in a good job and the other is struggling on food stamps because she is not married, the attitudes of progressives and conservatives differ starkly on the remedies.  Progressives see this is a failure of the system to support all kinds of families and consider the right&#8217;s denigration of the hardworking single mother as hypocrisy. </p>
<p>The right, however, believes that &#8220;encouraging traditional faimilies is of paramount social importance&#8221; so it is okay with a system that makes the lives of single mothers more difficult while rewarding more traditional mothers.  Because the right also dislikes any form of government intervention in the markets or government intervention that might upset the applecart regarding the dominance of traditional families (and traditional religious institutions), it wants to keep government small and ineffective, assuring that it does not provide public support such as &#8220;food stamps, subsidized daycare, and after-school programs&#8221; that would make life easier for single mothers.  As <a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2012/10/growing-inequality-calls-for-both-predistribution-and-rightly-directed-redistribution.html">Paul ryan</a> made clear in his &#8220;path to prosperity&#8221; budget plan, the right-wing prefers to undermine government because it wants nongovernmental institutions to determine who gets aid, and how.  When fundamentalist churches are the arbiters of aid, single women experience the shame and public ignominy that the right believes they deserve. </p>
<p>Goldberg adds substance beyond what she finds in Self.  She notes that &#8216;[a]s long as big-government liberalism worked to uphold the nuclear family, it was supported by a fairly broad social consensus.&#8221;  When traditional ideas about gender and about the innate heroism of the military started to fray in the 1960s and 1970s with feminism, gay rights, and sexual liberation, and calls for the end of patriarchy,  the right responded.  Radical anti-feminists like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phyllis_Schlafly">Phyllis Schlafly</a>, notes Goldberg, saw feminists as &#8220;radicals who are waging a total assault on the family, on marriage, and on children.&#8221;  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Gilder">George Gilder</a>, radical anti-feminist and hardcore supply-sider who wrote many speeches for Reagan, &#8220;was upfront about opposing reproductive rights because he believed they undermined male power and about how his economic theories depended on women&#8217;s submission. Goldberg quotes the following passage from Gilder:</p>
<p>When the women demanded&#8217; control over our own bodies,&#8217; they believed they were couching the issue in the least objectionable way. &#8230; But as Norman Mailer pointed out at the time, they were in fact invoking one of the most extreme claims of the movement and striking at one of the most profound male vulnerabilities.  For, in fact, few males have come to psychological terms with the existing birth-control technology; few recognize the extent to which it shifts the balance of sexual power in favor of women.  A man quite simply cannot now father a baby unless his wife is fully and deliberately agreeable. &#8230; Male procreativity is now dependent, to a degree unprecedented in history, on the active pleasure of women.&#8221;  Id. at 34 (quoting Reagan speechwriter George Gilder).</p>
<p>Goldberg concludes that &#8220;[t]he contemporary conservative movement has succeeded in part by painting the government as the ultimate cause of emasculation.&#8221;  Id. at 34.  She suggests that Ryan&#8217;s speech at the convention personified this view, arguing essentially that men who want more authority and control of their families and their destinies should battle the &#8220;suffocating power of the state&#8221; and beware of the problems when &#8220;government accords [privileges] to women or minorities or the poor&#8221;.  Id. at 34.</p>

<p> The GOP, rape and abortion, and the place of God in political discourse</p>
<p> Remember GOP candidate Akin and his comments about no-pregnancies-from-legitimate-rape, suggesting somehow that most rapes are not legitimate and are maybe sought after by the one raped as well as by the rapist?  Akin revealed an incredible lack of understanding about what rape means to women in terms of the devastiating difficulty of the experience itself and its long-term impact on a person&#8217;s well-being and sense of self.  At the same time, he showed an incredible naivete or lack of competence in judging science from hearsay in his belief that women who are raped can prevent pregnance (apparently by some kind of magic).  Akin has come to symbolize for me the problem of the far-right&#8217;s dominance of the GOP in terms of inability to distinguish fact from convenient fiction, scientific theory from dogmatic beliefs and wishes, or societal realities from ideological wishes.</p>
<p>Now we learn that Richard Mourdock, GOP Senate candidate in Indiana, supports banning abortion in all circumstances other than when the life of the mother-to-be is endangered.  When asked about pregnancies that result from rape, he insisted that he thought the woman should be forced to carry out the pregnancy because &#8220;even when life begins in that horrible situation of rape, that is something that God intended to happen.&#8221;  (He has since &#8220;apologized&#8221;, if you can call a statement that others have &#8220;misinterpreted his comments&#8221; an apology.  See Aaron Blake and Chris Cillizza, Mourdock <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2012/10/24/mourdock-god-intended-for-babies-to-result-from-rape/?wpisrc=nl_pmpolitics">apologizes for &#8216;misinterpretation&#8217; of rape comments, Obama campaign pounces</a>, The Fix, Washington Post (oct. 24, 2012).</p>

<p>This is just another example of the GOP&#8217;s deaf ear to what they impose on women&#8211;even what may be construed as a &#8220;war on women&#8221; because of their unwillingness to treat women as equals in so many ways, including in having appropriate choices about their own bodies.  Because the mostly white males that make up the GOP political class never are in the position of being impregnated by a criminal rapist or carrying an embryo from a few cells through its development into a fetus and then delivering a baby that they will need to love and cherish throughout its life, they can easily say that if you got pregnant in a rape, the new life form that is represented by the joining of your egg cell and the rapist&#8217;s sperm cell is something &#8220;God intended to happen&#8221; and therefore you must preserve that life.  Mourdock doens&#8217;t understand what it means to become pregnant and carry that pregnancy through to fruition or what it would be like to carry the child of your rapist and to give birth to that child.  Mourdock, I dare say, doesn&#8217;t begin to comprehend the violation to self that rape signifies to women.  And the Obama campaign is correct in noting that &#8220;a Republican Congress working with a Republican president Mitt Romney would (feel) that women should not be able to make choices about their own health care.&#8221;  Id.</p>
<p>GOP NRSC chairman John Cornyn supported Mourdock, saying that we all &#8220;believe that life is a gift from God.&#8221;  Id.  But it is an obvious fact that we humans destroy life on a massive scale&#8211;from baby lambs slaughtered to &#8220;celebrate&#8221; Easter to mature wild horses slaughtered to satisfy other countries&#8217; craving for meat, from death penalty murders by the state to drone murders by the military.  The right&#8217;s fixation on abortion appears to have much more to do with the desire to keep women in a submissive state than it has to do with cherishing  lives-to-be or existing life.  If life is so cherished, why doesn&#8217;t the GOP support a vegan diet, elimination of the death penalty, funding for adequate pre-natal and post-natal care for those in the lower 40 percent of the income distribution, and diplomacy over military solutions to international disputes?</p>
<p>Of course, there&#8217;s another issue here, one that cannot seemingly be addressed any more in the public arena.  It is politicians&#8217; pervasive reliance on their own personal beliefs in and about &#8220;God&#8221; as a justification for political and governmental action or inaction, the incremental encroachment of an outspoken minority&#8217;s religious beliefs on the available options for the vast majority who may not share them.  Mourdock&#8217;s statement implies that all Americans must necessarily believe in (his version of) God, since he is asserting that legislation on abortion must take (what he deems to be) God&#8217;s plans into account.   And whatever happens, it must be (his) God&#8217;s intent.  Thus, in spite of Mourdock&#8217;s denial that he is saying that (his) God preordains the rape as well as the pregnancy, it is hard to escape the conclusion that he must ultimately believe that, since the pregnancy would not have happened in these cases without the rape.  And thus he ultimately is suggesting that rape isn&#8217;t quite so bad as any woman who has been raped&#8211; or has imagined being raped, or has known someone who was raped &#8211;knows it is.</p>

<p>Another Court Strikes Down DOMA</p>
<p>The Second Circuit ruled on Thursday on the estate tax case involving the legality of DOMA&#8211;<a href="http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/1afe4f62-fbf9-4e0d-a409-26ab7396971e/1/doc/12-2335_complete_opn.pdf">Windsor v. United States </a>(or in the long form&#8211;Windsor, executor of the Estate of Spyer, v. United States).  Readers may recall this as a case in which a group of members of the House of Representatives intervened when the Obama administration announced that it would no longer defend DOMA in court.  The surviving spouse of a same-sex couple was denied the marital deduction, and the trial court (Southern District of New York) reached summary judgement in her favor.  The Second Circuit affirmed the decision, concluding that DOMA is an unconstitutional violation of the <a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2012/09/doma.html">Equal Protection Clause</a>.</p>
<p>The court first concluded that homosexuals are a discrete and insular minority that is entitled to heightened scrutiny.  Turning to the rationales suggested by the Congressional intervenors to support the law, the court rejected each of them in turn, as follows:</p>
<p>1) Argument that DOMA is valid as a way of achieving uniformity in marriage law for federal purposes:<br /><em>Because DOMA is an unprecedented breach of longstanding deference to federalism that singles out same-sex marriage as the only inconsistency (among many) in state law that requires a federal rule to achieve uniformity, the rationale premised on uniformity is not an exceedingly persuasive justification for DOMA. Id. at 38.</em><br /><em></em><br /><a name="more"></a><em><br /></em> 2) Argument that DOMA is valid as a way of protecting the federal fisc by preventing the extension of government marriage benefits to a certain group:<br /><em>DOMA is properly considered a</em><em> benefit withdrawal in the sense that it functionally</em><em> eliminated longstanding federal recognition of all marriages</em><em> that are properly ratified under state law&#8211;and the federal</em><em> benefits (and detriments) that come with that recognition.</em><em> Furthermore, DOMA is so broad, touching more than a</em><em> thousand federal laws, that it is not substantially related</em><em> to fiscal matters. Id. at 39.</em><br /><em><br /></em> 3)Argument that DOMA is valid as a way of preserving a traditional understanding of the institution of marriage:<br /><em>Quoting Heller (509 U.S. at 326), the court notes that &#8220;ancient lineage of a legal concept does not give a law immunity from attack for lacking a rational basis,&#8221; nor does tradition satisfy &#8220;the more demanding test of having a substantial relation to an important government interest. Similar appeals to tradition were made and rejected in litigation concerning anti-sodomy laws . . . [and] neither history nor tradition could save a law prohibiting miscegenation from constitutional attack.&#8221;  Id. at 40.</em></p>
<p>4) Argument that DOMA is valid as a means of encouraging responsible procreation:<br /><em>The court finds DOMA insufficiently related to the goals stated by the intervenors&#8211;that DOMA encourages &#8220;natural&#8221; procreation, &#8220;biological parenting&#8221; and &#8220;optimal parenting by a mother and father&#8221;.  These are incentives for heterosexuals to marry, which were the same before and after DOMA was enacted.  Courts have been &#8220;unable to find even a rational connection between DOMA and encouragement of responsible procreation and child-rearing.&#8221;  Id. at 42</em><br /><em><br /></em> cross posted with <a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2012/10/another-court-strikes-down-doma.html">ataxingmatter</a></p>

<p>Romney&#8217;s &#8220;Binders full of women&#8221; comment<br /><em>editor&#8217;s note:  this is a political commentary and not a tax discussion</em>.</p>
<p>When Romney was asked what he could do about the inequity in women&#8217;s compensation, he didn&#8217;t answer the question.  He tried to turn it to his advantage by telling a story of how he ended up bringing a number of women into his cabinet back in the days when he was a more liberal politician serving as governor of Massachusetts.  He claimed that he wasn&#8217;t pleased that his staff hadn&#8217;t found qualified women for cabinet posts, and that he told them to go shake the trees and find some.  They came back with a binder full of women and he appointed a cabinet with record numbers of women.</p>
<p>So he didn&#8217;t answer what he would do about the pay inequities that exist.  He didn&#8217;t answer what he would do about the hiring inequities that exist, other than what seemed to be a personal claim that he personally ensured that there was an adequate search to establish a deep pool of women cabinet candidates.<br />But as a woman, I was jarred by the comment.  It was as though there really weren&#8217;t any &#8220;qualified&#8221; women but when pushed, he was able to come up with &#8220;binders&#8221; of women that could be appointed anyway and he did.  There was a hint that the women he appointed weren&#8217;t really &#8220;qualified&#8221;.  Or that because he had to push his staff to go out and find them, something else was wrong.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>It turns out that another organization&#8211;the Massachusetts Women&#8217;s Political Caucus&#8211; was thinking ahead and trying to ensure that whomever was elected governor would be aware of the many qualified women who could serve on a cabinet.  It created a Government Appointments Project (MassGAP) that developed an extensive process for candidate consultation on including women in high-level positions and got pre-election commitment from both the Democratic and Republican candidates to make efforts towards that goal. It was binders put together by MassGAP that the governor used to make his appointments.  (Perhaps if organizations in other states had prepared in that way, even more governors would have done better jobs of appointing females to their cabinets.)</p>
<p>Further, the meaty positions that were considered central to the functioning of the state (budget, trade, and similar matters) were indeed handed over to men.  The women were given more peripheral roles.<br />While Romney should receive some recognition for acknowledging that appointment of women was and is the right thing to do, his awkward phrasing nonetheless suggests that he doesn&#8217;t think women are at a par with men in this game of politics, and his avoidance of the heart of the equity question suggests he doesn&#8217;t get it.</p>

<p>Romer&#8217;s deficit reduction suggestions worth a read</p>
<p>Christina Romer&#8217;s recent piece in the New York Times is worth reading.  See C.D. Romer, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/09/business/cutting-the-deficit-compassionately-economic-view.html">Cutting the Deficit, with Compassion</a>, New York Times at BU5 (Sept. 9, 2012).</p>
<p>Now, I generally have found Romer too willing to advocate austerity economics and too unwilling to support progressive tax policies.  But nonetheless, this piece hits some good notes.  For example, while arguing that reducing the deficit needs to be a priority, she acknowledges that it must be done &#8220;in a way that does as little harm as possible to people, jobs and economic opportunity.&#8221;  Similarly, she recognizes that requires going slowly&#8211;&#8221; a comprehensive, aggressive deficit reduction plan [should be passed] as soon as possible, but the actual spending cuts and tax increases should be phased in as the economy recovers.&#8221;  Why?  Because &#8220;[a] crude rule of thumb is that every $100 billion of deficit reduction will cost close to a million jobs in the near term.&#8221;  A big price to pay that makes it reasonable to consider not only LONG-TERM deficit reduction plans but also SHORT-TERM job creation measures.</p>
<p>(Linda here<em>&#8230;  And in case you wonder, tax cuts for the wealthiest amongst us, as advocated by the Romney-Ryan team&#8211;are NOT job creation measures.  The Romney-Ryan budget proposes to achieve revenue neutrality, huge tax cuts for the rich, and no tax cuts for the middle class by not proposing any specifics.  The reality is that the Romney-Ryan plan is just politico-wishspeaking:  there is no plan that will do what they claim, because they depend on the now-well-disproven idea that huge tax cuts for the wealthy will generate more tax revenues while creating more jobs.  Nope.  Neither likely nor even possible.  And by not specifying what they&#8217;d cut, they are merely trying to fool the people.)</em><br /><em><br /></em> Here are what Romer proposes in italics, with some commentary after:</p>
<p>1) <i>tax credits for businesses that actually increase employment</i></p>
<p>Not a bad idea to replace the endless suggestions of business tax cuts, but any accountability will have to be long-term&#8211;i.e., payroll will have to increase over a period of 2 years and the particular jobs created will have to stay in place for at least 2 years before any tax reward should be available</p>
<p>2) <i>&#8220;well-designed tax reform that raises at least some additional revenue&#8221; and &#8220;let[s] the <a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2012/07/senate-votes-at-4-today-725-on-obama-tax-cut-proposal.html">Bush tax cuts</a> expire for those earning more than $250,000 a year [while] [i]ncreasing rates on top earners&#8221; and &#8220;lowering tax expenditures&#8221; including &#8220;the low tax rate on capital gains and dividends&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Hmmmm.The clarion call for tax reform has consistently been used by DC lobbyists to push for <a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2012/07/senate-votes-at-4-today-725-on-obama-tax-cut-proposal.html">tax CUTS</a> for the wealthy and big business.  It is not so clear that we need a huge tax reform.  What is usually meant by tax reform is &#8220;simplification,&#8221; which is just another way to justify unneeded tax cuts  .We do not need to cut the corporate tax rate.  We do not need to reduce tax regulations. </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>But I do agree with Romer&#8217;s notion that we need some tax increases.  My preference would be to allow the entire panoply of Bush tax cuts&#8211;passed by a Congress that unfortunately and wrongly believed the Laffer lie that cutting taxes would increase revenues&#8211;to expire as the Republicans originally purported to intend.  Let the sunset happen.  And then come next year, think about what, if any, of the cuts make sense. Perhaps a cut to the income tax rates of those who make less than $100,000 a year.  But an increase for those that make more than that, and a significant increase for the top two quintiles, would be in order.  We should raise rates on the wealthiest by creating additional tax brackets for those making 500,000 to a million, 1-2 million, 2-10 million, and above 10 million.   We could reasonably examine the many tax expenditures/subsidies in the Code and begin to cut back on them&#8211;starting with the capital gains rate preference, and moving through the exorbitant support for wealthy mortgages (limit it to an interest deduction on the first $250,000 of mortgage interest and phase that out for anyone with an income above $500,000) and including the R&#038;D credit (rather than deduction), the &#8220;active financing exception&#8221; and the subsidy for moving active businesses offshore (and along with that, eliminating any idea that there is such a thing as a &#8220;profits&#8221; partner who isn&#8217;t taxed on a &#8220;transfer&#8221; of a partnership interest at the time the interest is provided).</p>
<p>3)<i> slowing spending growth for government health care spending- by reducing overpayments to health care providers (as the $716 billion cut misrepresented by the GOP does); by increasing those cost-cutting reforms to find other ways that we are inefficient; by &#8220;making the wealthy pay a larger share of their Medicare costs and gradually raising the Medicare eligibility age&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Here we see the problem that no one in government dares to say what must be said&#8211;that until we move to a single-payer system like the rest of the advanced world, we will see private parties continuing to rip off rent profits from providing health care.  We must eventually expand to &#8220;medicare for all&#8221;&#8211;and we should do that soon.  In the transition, it would be reasonable to have a means-adjusted payment scale, so that the Medicare tax is higher for those with more income (corresponding to the increased brackets for the income tax).  And it might be reasonable to have a few major categories of jobs for determining base retirement age&#8211;workers in steel plants who work in 115 degree interiors when it is 90+ degrees outside likely should retire earlier than workers in academia who work at their desks in air-conditioned offices.  But that won&#8217;t be easy and will need to be developed by consensus over some reasonable time, rather than through partisan, anti-worker politics.</p>
<p>4) <i>cut other spending&#8211;protecting children, displaced workers, and wounded veterans in the process,as well as money for education (including <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pell_Grant">Pell grants</a>) and infrastructure and scientific research&#8211;but cutting &#8220;agricultural price supports and subsidized crop insurance programs that mainly benefit large commercial farmers,&#8221; the Pentagon&#8217;s budget, and high-speed rail.</i><br /><i><br /></i> We certainly can cut a lot of waste and warmongering out of the Pentagon&#8217;s budget, which is one reason that I&#8217;m all for letting the sequester approved by Republicans go through.  We could save a great deal there that could be used for infrastructure and other spending that builds opportunities and jobs instead of supporting the military-industrial complex.  I&#8217;d also support  cutting most of the agricultural subsidies, which primarily support Agribusiness that produces tasteless food at a high environmental cost.  But I disagree strongly on high-speed rail.  If we don&#8217;t as a nation invest in transportation infrastructure that moves us beyond the costly highways (costly in human lives, dollars to build and maintain, and environmental degradation), we will not advance our economy as we must.</p>
