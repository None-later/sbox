<p> Romney and Private Equity&#8217;s Questionable Schemes for Paying Very Little Tax</p>
<p> Presumably any American who wants to be informed is aware that GOP presidential candidate <a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2012/08/-private-equity-magic-trick-equity-managers-gain-taxpayers-losses-reich-video.html">Mitt Romney</a>&#8216;s claim to business acumen resides in his experience at a <a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2012/08/-private-equity-magic-trick-equity-managers-gain-taxpayers-losses-reich-video.html">private equity firm</a> that made much of its money by ramping up debt at purchased firms and using that debt to repay whatever (usually relatively small) investment the equity firm partners made in what has come to be known as &#8220;LBO&#8221; deals (for &#8220;leveraged buyout&#8221;).  In LBOs, the equity firm investors almost always do well to exceedingly well, using mostly other people&#8217;s money. </p>
<p>Not so generally for the workers in the bought-out company.  The &#8220;rent&#8221; profits of the equity firm are often on the back of the workers, who may get fired in favor of outsourcing their jobs or get stuck in a rut, as productivity gains go to the new managers and owners and not to the workers.  At the least, the high debt load makes it very difficult for the company to succeed and certainly difficult for it to give its workers a fair shake.   Remember that one of Romney&#8217;s gaffs was to admit that he enjoys firing workers.<br />Why anybody thinks this kind of winner-take-all, leverage-&#8217;em-up mentality of private equity firms suggests the kind of leader desirable for a democracy that purports to provide genuine opportunity for all classes of citizens to live a decent life is beyond me. </p>
<p>But even if the very nature of the business and the common tools of over-leverage and &#8220;rent&#8221; profits for a very few already at the top don&#8217;t give voters cause for pause, then there are the many ways that private equity firm partners manage to avoid paying their fair share of taxes, which ensures that more of the tax burden falls on the less-well-off, that are worthy of consideration, even if candidate Romney has not (as his campaign claims) benefited from them personally.  That is because if Romney is elected president, his views on the acceptability of aggressive tax strategies of questionable legality will matter.  We should know what kinds of tax schemes are routine in the business that he touts as good evidence of his ability to serve as president of this nation&#8211;especially if some of them are obviously poor policy (the carried interest treatment) or highly questionable tax avoidance schemes (the management fee conversion waiver scheme).</p>
<p>1. Carried Interest   (More after the jump)</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>The best known way private equity firm partners reduce taxes is by earning their compensation in the form of &#8220;carried interest&#8221; and claiming that such profits should be treated the same way a real capital investment in a partnership is treated, even though it is awarded as compensation for their purported management expertise and work and not as a return on an actual investment made.   That is, they claim they are profits partners in the firm and that their compensation is a distribution of the partnership&#8217;s profits (usually from gains on sales, and hence eligible for preferential capital gains) to them rather than compensation income.  As such they benefit from the extraordinarily preferential rate for capital gains in the current law as enacted under the Bush administration (generally 15%).  Carried interest is the primary reason that candidate Romney has to pay such a very low rate of taxes on his income from his business.</p>
<p>The Internal Revenue Code (the codification of the federal statutes governing the federal income tax) does not include a specific provision governing profits interests and indicating that such &#8220;profits&#8221; partners should be treated as actual partners in a partnership (without that partnership interest itself being subject to tax as compensation) entitled to receive capital gains distributions.  Accordingly, as one partnership tax treatise puts it, the tax treatment of a transfer to a &#8220;service partner&#8221; of a &#8220;profits interest&#8221; for services &#8220;has been uncertain&#8221; because &#8220;[n]o provision of the Code specifically exempts from taxation the receipt of any partnership interest in exchange for services.&#8221;  Willis &#038; Postlewaite, Partnership Taxation, 6th ed, at 4-124.    There is some case law about profits interests, but those cases made it even less clear how and when such interests should be taxed. </p>
<p>Finally, the Service resolved the issue with administrative authority (heavily lobbied for in the interests of equity partners and real estate profit partners, in particular) in Rev. Proc. 93-27 (and later proposed regs and other items) that does not treat the issuance of a compensatory &#8220;profits interest&#8221; as  a taxable event in most instances.  The main reason for the treatment may well be the so-called &#8220;Wall Street Rule&#8221;&#8211;once incredibly wealthy taxpayers hire sophisticated, high-priced lawyers to produce opinons supportive of a taxpayer-favorable interpretation and then operate as though the Code blesses a particular activity, it is hard for tax administrators to issue regulatory authority that treats that activity differently.</p>
<p>2, Management Fee Conversion Waivers<br />But there is another lesser-known aspect to the compensation that private equity fund partners earn for their services in their private equity firms&#8211;the management fee.  Most explanations describe this as  compensation paid for services that is subject to taxation at the ordinary rate (just like a secretary&#8217;s wages would be).  But that disregards a practice that exists among a significant number of equity firms (the Times article linked below says about 40% in 2009) that are willing to take aggressive positions to avoid paying taxes and can afford to pay the tax professionals to provide a way to do it&#8211;the management fee waiver conversion scheme. </p>
<p>The conversion of management fees from ordinary income to capital gains is purportedly accomplished by &#8220;waiving&#8221; the fees (not necessarily across-the-board throughout the life of the firm, but often selectively and on a quarter-by-quarter basis),  Instead of getting fees, the partner claims they are &#8220;converted&#8221; to a share of related profits &#8211;i.e., they become an additional carried interest&#8211;and hence eligible for treatment as (deferred) capital gains from the firm.  </p>
<p>Some tax professionals think this conversion waiver works.  Much of this is again the &#8220;Wall Street Rule&#8221;&#8211;the claim that lots do it, the IRS has known about it, and oh it should be justifiable because now the &#8220;fee&#8221; is (sort of, maybe, kinda) at risk.  It is not really at risk in the way we ordinarily think of investment risk, since these are pre-tax dollars &#8212; the managers are not putting after-tax dollars at risk like any other investor is doing.  And as Vic Fleischer commented to the Gothamist blog, &#8220;there is a tension between economic risk and tax risk &#8230;. The way Bain set it up there&#8217;s not much risk at all, so it&#8217;s hard to see how this income should receive capital gains treatment.&#8221;  Christopher Robbins, <a href="http://gothamist.com/2012/09/02/ny_ag_bain_capital_others_may_have.php">NY AG: Bain Capital and others may have skirted tax law</a>, the Gothamist (Sept. 2, 2012).  </p>
<p>I&#8217;d guess  that most professionals do not think the conversion scheme works, at least not in most instances.  This would be especially true for those who consider that interpretations of the law should further coherent bodies of law that work as fairly as possible.  And even more tax professionals likely think that the partnership rules should be adjusted to ensure that it doesn&#8217;t work, since otherwise we are perpetuating inequities in the tax system that favor the already incredibly rich.</p>
<p>The conversion waiver issue has come to the attention of the public now because the New York State attorney general is investigating private equity firms who may have engaged in this conversion waiver practice.  See Nichnolas Confessore et al, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/02/business/inquiry-on-tax-strategy-adds-to-scrutiny-of-finance-firms.html">Inquiry on Tax Strategy Adds to Scrutiny of Finance Firms</a>, New York Times (Sept. 1, 2012) (noting that the AG&#8217;s subpoenas, issued by the AG&#8217;s Taxpayer Protection Bureau, cover firms like Kohlberg Kravis, TPG Capital, Apollo Global, Silver Lake and Bain, and that Bain partners may have saved more than $200 million in federal income taxes, $20 million in Medicare taxes). <br />It&#8217;s not clear on what grounds the New York AG is investigating this issue, which appears on the surface to be primarily a federal income tax issue.  It could be some sort of state-law fraud claim but it could also be a claim that underpayment of state taxes routinely results from the filing posture taken,  Equity partners in firms using the conversion waiver would presumably be able to save on state income taxes through either rate preferences and/or deferral, depending on the state and how much the state&#8217;s laws build on the federal filing.  Though New York State does not have a preferential rate for capital gains, if the timing of reporting the income is set by the conversion waiver, the deferral would amount to a significant state tax savings that deprives New York of needed revenues. </p>
<p>[<em>Aside:  By the way, some of the information about the management fee conversion waiver first came to broad public attention in connection with Bain and the trove of documents released at Gawker.com.  See John Cook, <a href="http://gawker.com/5936394">The Bain Files: Inside Mitt Romney&#8217;s Tax-Dodging Cayman Schemes</a>, Gawker.com (Aug. 23, 2012) (noting that the huge cache of Bain financial documents &#8220;shed a great deal of light on those finances, and on the tax-dodging tricks available to the hyper-rich that [Romney] has used to keep his effective tax rate at roughly 13% over the last decade&#8221;).   These documents, and the further analysis articles available at the Gawker.com site, are worth considering for their own revelation of what Romney&#8217;s real business is like and how that does (or doesn&#8217;t) suggest he can help our economy as president&#8211;it is a business where &#8220;opaque complexity&#8221; allows the &#8220;preposterously wealthy&#8221; to engage in &#8220;exotic tax-avoidance schemes&#8221;, according to the Gawker.com article.  (I have not yet personally perused much of the 950 page trove on Gawker.)  That said, Romney&#8217;s campaign issued a statement indicating that the candidate has not benefited from the conversion waiver practice.  We have not, of course, seen enough of Romney&#8217;s tax returns and supporting information to be able to judge this matter independently.  The focus on the conversion waiver thus provides yet another reason why candidate Romney should release 10 years of tax returns as other candidates have done</em>.]</p>
<p>There are two additional readable pieces on this conversion waiver issue, plus a scholarly article that anyone wanting to better understand the details can peruse.  Vic Fleischer, a tax prof at Colorado who made his original contribution to academe by writing about carried interest, has an article that sets out the issues well, with an example contrasting the significant difference in after-tax results for a real investor compared to a profits-interest purported investor.  See Victor Fleischer,<a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2012/09/04/whats-at-issue-in-the-private-equity-tax-inquiry/?nl=business&#038;emc=edit_dlbkpm_20120904">What&#8217;s at issue in the private equity tax inquiry</a>, DealBook, New York Times (Sept. 4, 2012). See also Brian Beutler, <a href="http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2012/09/did-bain-capital-execs-break-the-law-using-a-common-tax-avoidance-strategy.php">Did Bain Capital Execs Break the Law Using a Common Tax Avoidance Strategy? </a>Talkingpointsmemo.com (Sept. 3, 2012). The academic piece is Gregg Polsky, <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1295443">Private Equity Management Fee Conversions </a>(Nov. 4, 2008).  The following two paragraphs are from the conclusion to that piece.</p>
<p>In fact, there are strong arguments that it is not. While managers argue that the safe harbor in Rev. Proc. 93-27 applies to the additional carried interest, there are both technical and conceptual claims to the contrary. Without the protection afforded by Rev. Proc. 93-27, the additional carried interest would be taxable upon receipt if it has a market value capable of determination. Both the context in which the additional carried interest is issued and the specific design features of the typical additional carried interest support the view that additional carried interests are significantly easier to value than prototypical profits interests.Under existing case law, this would mean that the additional carried interest is taxable upon receipt as ordinary income to the extent of its fair market value.</p>
<p>The IRS also has strong arguments under section 707(a)(2)(A), which recasts transactions that are artificially designed as partnership transactions in order to obtain tax benefits, such as character conversion. In the context of fee conversions, the most critical fact that favors section 707(a)(2)(A) re-characterization is the manager’s very limited exposure to risk. As a result, section 707(a)(2)(A) likely applies to fee conversions. If so, the manager’s attempt to convert the character of their management fee income would be thwarted.<br />

<p><strong>Not on Tax (or only indirectly so): GOPer Akin&#8217;s &#8220;legitimate rape&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>As most of you have heard by now, the Missouri Republican nominee for Senate, current House Rep. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Akin">Todd Akin</a>, in a Sunday interview with KTVI-TV, justifying his opposition to any abortion ever, even in the case of rape, made the following incredibly absurd statement:<br />
<blockquote>First of all, from what I understand from doctors [pregnancy from rape] is really rare.  If it&#8217;s a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down. But let&#8217;s assume that maybe that didn&#8217;t work, or something.  I think there should be some punishment, but the punishment ought to be on the rapist and not attacking the child.  Amy Davidson, <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/closeread/2012/08/what-does-todd-akin-think-legitimate-rape-is.html">What Does Todd Akin Think &#8216;Legitimate Rape&#8217; is?</a>, New Yorker (Aug. 19, 2012).</p></blockquote>
<p>Davidson makes a number of worthy points about this troubling statement by a sitting Congressman who happens to serve on the House committee dealing with science issues.   The statement demonstrates: <br /><a name="more"></a>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;biological ignorance&#8221; (women do get pregnant from rape)</li>
<li>disregard of women&#8217;s interest in the matter (&#8220;Akin apparently has not [realized] that people possessing a &#8216;female body&#8217; are also part of the political conversation&#8221;) </li>
<li>Akin&#8217;s ethically challenged thinking (&#8220;There is the puzzling idea that the putative rarity of pregnancies caused by rape would make it any less of a &#8216;tough sort of ethical question.'&#8221;) </li>
<li>absurd categorization of rape into &#8220;legitimate&#8221; and otherwise (&#8220;[D]oes Akin think that doing what one could to survive would delgitimze the rape&#8211;or that a legitimate victim is [only] one who sees rape as a fate worse than death? &#8230;<strong>The problem here is not just whether Akin thinks conception during rape is possible, but what he thinks rape is</strong>.&#8221; emphasis added)</li>
</ul>
<p>Even when Akin tried to limit the harm done by his statement (he twittered &#8220;I have great empathy for all victims.  I regret misspeaking&#8221;), he nonetheless confirmed his view that pregnancies resulting from rape don&#8217;t merit abortions.<br />   <br />What GOP Rep. Akin&#8217;s statement reveals is the craven indifference of the right-wing of the Republican party to the suffering of a woman left to bear a child of her rapist, its unconscionable disregard of scientific fact, and the inexcusable attempt to appeal to America&#8217;s fundamentalist &#8220;value&#8221; extremists on the right who want to impose their views on social and fiscal issues on all the rest of us, no matter what the consequences.</p>
<p>As a <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2012/08/20/the-many-faces-of-the-republican-party/">recent poll </a> by the Washington Post and Kaiser Family Foundation demonstrated, the strongest group of Republicans, albeit still a minority at 28%, is represented by Tea Party members who support radical social visions of 1900s morality rules being imposed on everyone (fundamentalist religious views enshrined in law and in &#8220;traditional&#8221; interpretations of the Constitutions, resulting in no same-sex marriage, no same-sex adoptions, no abortions (even for rape victims)) <em>combined with</em> 1900s ideas about tax revenues and spending provisions (removing the safety net provided by Medicare and Social Security and substituting some version of privatization or elimination of these programs, so that the elderly are thrown back on charity care; allowing today&#8217;s robber barons (corporate moguls and private equity vulture capitalists) to fire workers and reduce their pay indiscriminately through dismantling of unions whenever possible; elimination of tax burdens on capital income; and remaking the corporate tax code to be even more favorable to multinationals).</p>
<p> And <a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2012/08/who-is-paul-ryan.html">Paul Ryan</a>, Romney&#8217;s vice presidential selection, is of accord with this group and opposes an abortion ban exception for rape victims (though Romney&#8217;s campaign on Sunday claims that the Romney-Ryan ticket would not opposed abortions after a rape&#8211;as though we have any reason to believe that will still be Romney&#8217;s position a few days from now&#8230;..).</p>
<p>As a commenter noted, Akin really just said what he believes out loud, betraying to everyone what he really has in mind.  I hope Missourians recognize this snake in congressman garb for what he is&#8211;someone who shouldn&#8217;t be allowed to touch a Senate seat with a 10-foot pole.</p>

<p> Romryanomics&#8211;prosperity for the well-off fueled by austerity for the rest</p>
<p> I&#8217;ve put off writing about stilted robo-Romney&#8217;s choice of the perpetual-smily-Ryan as veep about as long as I can, I suppose.  So let me talk about it in broad terms in this post.  In the next posts, I&#8217;ll discuss more methodically the vacuous &#8220;Romney program&#8221; and the toxic &#8220;Ryan path to prosperity&#8221; with particular attention to what they have said specifically (or not, in Romney&#8217;s case) about what they want to do with the tax system. </p>
<p>Both Romney and Ryan come from well-to-do families with the privileges of financial support, status and connections that adhere thereto (see <a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/20/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-he-didnt-inherit-money-his-parent/">this story</a> on Romney&#8211;by the way, a donated inheritance is still an inheritance and donations of that magnitude earn other privileges for the elite; and <a href="http://blogs.detroitnews.com/politics/2012/08/14/ryans-family-fortune-built-on-taxpayer-money/">this story </a>on Ryan&#8211;whose wife also inherited millions including oil and gas interests), yet support the neoconservative economic mythology that wealth is wholly based on merit and that the way to have a good economy is to make sure the wealthy, who are deemed to be the (mythic) &#8220;job creators&#8221; are happy.  This leads them to support austerity for the middle class and seniors coupled with deregulation, privatization, militarization and tax cuts&#8211;Romryanomics 101. </p>
<p>Key to the Romney program (or what can be derived from a description of generalities-without-specifics that can&#8217;t be scored by economists plus Romney&#8217;s statement earlier that he would sign Ryan&#8217;s budget proposal into law if passed by Congress plus his Monday statement that &#8220;his own plan for Medicare is &#8216;very similar&#8217; to Ryan&#8217;s&#8221;, per this <a href="http://nbcpolitics.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/08/14/13282003-romney-draws-on-2010-playbook-in-medicare-offensive?lite">NBCnews.com story </a>) and the Ryan so-called &#8220;path to prosperity&#8221; (see, e.g., the <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-hiltzik-20120815,0,1949780.column">LA Times story</a>) is privatization of, and spending cuts to, Social Security and Medicare, along with spending cuts to everything else that serves the public good (environmental programs, parks, etc.) and vulnerable minorities in this country and isn&#8217;t part of the military-industrial-financial complex.  That is, social welfare programs that have made the difference between poverty and dignity for American seniors will be undone by some level of privatization and benefit cuts, to accomodate unmerited tax cuts for the wealthy and increased spending on the military (notice the echos of Bush&#8217;s Iraq-war buildup in the talk about being tough on Iran and extraordinarily friendly to Israel coming from the campaign). </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Of course, this program of tax cuts, militarization, and deregulation has already been tried&#8211;those are the ideas that failed to deliver a robust economy under George W. Bush, who had an anemic recovery from 2001-2004 in spite of the $1.3 trillion in tax cuts over ten years enacted in 2001 and the continuing tax cuts carried out in 2003 and 2004.  Nor did Bush&#8217;s imperialistic militarization through two preemptive wars deliver a robust economy.  Instead, the rash of financial speculation and finanialization of the economy pushed us into a deep financial crisis and the Great Recession.  Those ideas will upend the recovery from that recession that has been underway under Obama.</p>
<p>Both Romney and Ryan have personally benefited from the kind of government that recognizes the importance of public-private cooperation in institution and infrastructure building, yet pontificate that government is always less efficient than private enterprise.  That rhetoric is used to justify stifling innovative programs like supporting experiments in environmentally sound energy development, but it doesn&#8217;t come into play as far as continuing to ladle out tax-code largesse to the profitable oil and gas extractive industry or coddling financial institutions through deregulation (Romney, for example, <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-05-14/romney-vowing-dodd-frank-repeal-hits-jpmorgan-inconvenient-truth.html">supports dismantling Dodd-Frank</a>, an already timid effort to rein in financial speculation; Ryan <a href="http://www.nextnewdeal.net/rortybomb/paul-ryan-really-doesnt-dodd-frank">voted for TARP and against Dodd-Frank</a>, positions that garnered Republicans a haul of financial industry contributions).  That approach will continue the George W. Bush trend of the financialization of the economy and likely land us in another, even worse, systemic financial crisis. </p>
<p>Both had ancestors that benefited greatly (in terms of prestige and in terms of economics) from their involvement in and with government.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Romney">Romney&#8217;s father George</a>, of course, was a well-known governor of Michigan &#8211;and  a wealthy corporate CEO in the auto industry that benefited hugely from the government shift from investment in railroads to investment in roads.  Ryan&#8217;s family reaped its riches at the public trough&#8211;involved in the kind of public-private partnerships that made the transcontinental railroads possible (and built enormous wealth for the railroad builders) and the interstate highway system possible (and built enormous wealth for the highway builders).  See Libby Spencer, Ryan <a href="http://blogs.detroitnews.com/politics/2012/08/14/ryans-family-fortune-built-on-taxpayer-money/">family fortune built on taxpayer money</a>, DetroitNews.com (Aug. 14, 2012);  Sally Kohn, <a href="http://www.salon.com/2012/08/14/paul_ryan_didnt_build_that/">Paul Ryan didn&#8217;t build that!</a>Salon.com (Aug. 14, 2012) (noting that  the Ryan family, starting with his great-grandfather building railroads, has profited from government contracts over more than a century, including &#8220;at least 22 defense contracts &#8230; since 1996&#8221;).<br />Romney likes to think of himself as a successful businessman who can lead the country by supporting business.</p>
<p>But Romney is mainly a vulture capitalist.  His private equity firm bought companies that were doing well and providing good US jobs, loaded them up with debt so that outsize profits could be made for the Bain &#8220;investors&#8221; (himself included), and &#8211;if it helped them make even more outsize profits&#8211;enjoyed firing the &#8220;excess&#8221; workers. Private equity firms don&#8217;t produce anything.  While the right applauds the so-called &#8220;creative destruction&#8221; that tears existing companies apart to sell off the pieces for more or to enable firing the workers and breaking a union contract, those activities don&#8217;t add to a sustainable economy.  They  mostly look for companies they can take over, with no regard for the workers&#8217; lives or the communities in which the companies exist, in order to capture what economists refer to as &#8220;rent&#8221; profits, usually through loading the companies up with debt.  Some of the companies thrive or just survive, but many of the workers don&#8217;t, since cutting workers is a favored cost-cutting measure.  Some of the companies go bankrupt, leaving all the workers in the lurch and usually without promised pensions.  Some of the companies turn to outsourcing workers in order to make enough to pay off the debt.  There&#8217;s not much in vulture capitalism that bodes well for a vulture capitalist as president.</p>
<p>Ryan likes to think of himself as a principled thinker who will push for what he considers appropriate policies (no matter, apparently, their impact on vulnerable seniors or middle-class Americans).  As Ryan&#8217;s 2005 speech to <a href="http://www.atlassociety.org/outline-john-galts-speech">the Atlas Society</a>made clear, he has been an avid follower of Ayn Rand, the alpha-male praising, privileged-innovator(&#8220;producers&#8221;)-elite loving, anti-societal cooperation, anti-altruism,  radical libertarian, free-trade &#8220;objectivist&#8221; author that has been called the &#8220;Goddess of the Market&#8221; (see Jennifer Burns, Goddess of the Market: Ayn Rand and the American Right).  Ryan even told the Weekly Standard in 2003 that  “I give out ‘<em>Atlas Shrugged’</em> as Christmas presents, and I make all my interns read it,” he said. “Well&#8230; I try to make my interns read it.” Rachel Weiner, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/post/what-ayn-rand-says-about-paul-ryan/2012/08/13/fd40d574-e56d-11e1-8741-940e3f6dbf48_blog.html">What Ayn Rand says about Paul Ryan</a>, Washington Post (Aug. 13, 2012).  Lately, though, he&#8217;s been trying to distance himself from Rand, perhaps because he finally learned that her brand of radical libertarianism derived from atheism rather than theism.  Kate Sullivan, <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/pageviews/2012/08/veep-nominee-paul-ryan-renounces-former-fascination-with-ayn-rand">Veep nominee Paul Ryan renounces former fascination with Ayn Rand</a>, NY Daily News (Aug. 14, 2012).</p>

                                <div>Okay, okay.  I know that Obama doesn’t read AB.  So I know that his decision, reflected in his speech today at a lunch with Associated Press editors and reporters, to finally—<i>finally</i>—start refuting the Republicans’ economics proposals with actual <i>examples</i> and <i>statistics</i>, was not prompted by my repeated laments here that Obama just doesn’t <i>do</i> specifics, i.e., <i>statistics</i> and other <i>facts</i>, when speaking to the general public, which until now he&#8217;s rarely done anyway.  And my primal pleas that he do so.  (When, earlier this year, he defended his decision to openly approve a Super Pac that supports him, explaining that he decided to not unilaterally disarm, I said to myself: “Hmm. Guess he’s had a change heart, after unilaterally disarming for the last three years.”)

<div></div>
<div>So the first sentence in the title of this post is facetious.  The second sentence in the title is not.</div>
<p><a name="more"></a>
</p>
<p>
<div>The New York Times is <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/04/us/politics/obama-attacks-house-gop-budget.html?_r=1&#038;partner=rss&#038;emc=rss&#038;src=igw">reporting </a>on its website:</div>
<div></div>
<div>President Obama opened a full-frontal assault Tuesday on the budget adopted by House Republicans, condemning it as a “Trojan horse” and “thinly veiled social Darwinism” that would greatly deepen inequality in the country.…
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>In the latest of a series of combative speeches, the president said Americans could not afford to elect a Republican president at a time of fragile economic recovery, with a weak job market and a crushing national debt from “two wars, two massive tax cuts and an unprecedented financial crisis.”
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The widening gulf between the rich and everyone else, Mr. Obama said, was hobbling the country’s economic growth. He cited studies that found that societies with less income inequality had stronger and steadier growth.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>“In this country, broad-based prosperity has never trickled down from the success of a wealthy few,” the president said, according to excerpts of his address. “It has always come from the success of a strong and growing middle class. That’s how a generation who went to college on the G.I. Bill, including my grandfather, helped build the most prosperous economy the world has ever known.” …
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>But the president reserved his harshest words for the 2013 budget proposal recently passed by the Republican-controlled House. The budget, drafted by Representative Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, calls for $5.3 trillion in spending cuts, as well as tax cuts for households earning more than $250,000.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>“Disguised as a deficit reduction plan, it’s really an attempt to impose a radical vision on our country. It’s nothing but thinly veiled social Darwinism,” Mr. Obama said. “By gutting the very things we need to grow an economy that’s built to last — education and training, research and development — it’s a prescription for decline.”
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>I&#8217;m absolutely thrilled. Obama’s finally picking up the gauntlet that the Repubs have thrown down, and, calling that spade the spade that it is, is throwing it back.  Hard.  Clear. And with real precision.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>By far the most important parts of what he said are, I think, his references to the WWII generation’s use of the GI Bill and how it effectuated class mobility and helped spur the tremendous economic growth of the three postwar decades, and his actual citation to studies showing that societies with less income inequality had stronger and steadier growth.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Hooray.  Hooray!
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>But I hope he goes even further and compares the tax rates during the 1950s, ‘60s, ‘70s, ‘80s and ‘90s—including capital gains taxes and estate taxes—with today’s tax rates established during the G. W. Bush presidency and, even more important, with the tax rates proposed by the current Republicans.  </div>
<div></div>
<div>Yup.  George Romney and Edward Davies, Ann Romney&#8217;s father, amassed their wealth during Socialism.  They must have been economic Houdinis.  Or  corrupt Commie officials.</div>
<div>
</div>
<p>
<div>I hope Obama also discusses what those higher tax rates bought.  The interstate highway system, for example, and the student loan programs and significant aide to state universities that helped finance so many baby boomers’ college educations.  And that he points out, again and again, that in January 2001 we had no budget-deficit problem because we were raising most of the federal tax revenue needed to pay for most of our federal needs.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Specifics.  Statistics.  To refute the damn lies and the soundbites and clichés.  And to illustrate the consequences.  A picture really <i>is </i>worth a thousand words.  Even if the picture is drawn in words.</div>
<div>
</div>
<div>
</div>
<div>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Here&#8217;s one such picture, already framed: In his State of the Union address earlier this year, Obama acknowledged the problem of spiraling college tuitions and its effect on the ability of college-age members of the so-called working- and even middle-class to attend college, and on the longer-term economic effects upon those who do, using college loans that leave them owing massive debts upon graduation.  Not even to mention the long-term effects on the economy from this huge aggregate debt.  He suggested penalties, in the form of reductions in federal funds, for colleges and universities that don’t find ways to curtail the tuition hikes. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>A day or two later, Linda posted a fact-based refutation, pointing out that the main reason for the incessant tuition hikes at public universities is the incessant cutting of state funding for those universities, necessitated all the more by the economic downturn since 2007 and the resulting decrease in tax revenues and increase in recession-related expenditures.  Not long afterward, I read—I don’t remember where—that one major state university, which was not identified in the article, has seen its state funding reduced from 80% of its total revenue sources to 20% within (I think) the past two decades.  The result, as some longtime professors at state universities lament, is that the student bodies at these schools are now, unlike in earlier relatively-recent times, largely from upscale families, and very few are from working-class families. The level of federal financial assistance to states for colleges and universities obviously impacts this significantly.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>I’d love to hear Obama use this as an example to illustrate that the starve-the-beast juggernaut has broad and profound societal consequences. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>I’d also love to see Obama ask rhetorically what people think will be the consequence of the Republicans’ budget if, during the next economic downturn there  is no funding for unemployment compensation, a need that obviously is in an inverse relation to the unemployment rate and therefore to tax revenues.  And what will we cut from the budget in order to provide emergency disaster funding for, say, hurricane damage?
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>But today was a terrific start.  It’s statistics and other specifics that matter.  And today, for once, he provided some.  Hopefully, it was <i>just</i> the start.  
</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <div>In her post earlier today on <em><u>Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum</u></em>, the sort-of-<i>Citizens</i>&#8211;<i>United</i>-like case argued yesterday in the Supreme Court, Linda discusses the issue that was supposed to be the one that the Court would decide, because, well, that was the issue that the lower appellate court, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, decided.  The issue is whether under the Alien Tort Statute, which was enacted in 1789 and allows “aliens” to file civil lawsuits in the U.S. for violations of the “law of nations,” allows aliens to sue <i>corporations</i>, or instead only individuals, for violations of human rights as defined under clearly-established international law.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The Second Circuit court said it doesn’t, and, as the excerpt from that opinion that Linda posts shows, the appellate panel used as its justification the judges’ own moral judgment that since individuals (i.e., the corporation’s top executives) make the corporate decisions to leverage the corporation’s resources to accomplish these heinous acts, only those individuals, and not the ill-used corporation itself, should be suable.  And that therefore, only those individuals, and not the ill-used corporation itself, <i>will</i> be suable in U. S. federal courts under the ATS.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>This notwithstanding that the statute itself says nothing at all about <i>who</i>can be sued under it; it states only what acts the actor can be sued <i>for</i>.  And notwithstanding that the Second Circuit panel’s stated grounds for the ruling, if not necessarily the result (the dismissal of the lawsuit), conflict with the Supreme Court’s ruling two years ago in <i>Citizens United v. FEC</i>.  Which parlayed the First Amendment free-speech right of individuals into a right of corporate CEOs to leverage those rights of its individual human shareholders into a First Amendment speech right of the CEO to use corporate funds to advance his or her political preferences.</div>
<p><a name="more"></a>
</p>
<p>
<div>The plaintiffs in the case, 12 Nigerians, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/court-skeptical-about-overseas-corporate-abuse-suits/2012/02/28/gIQA9bx1gR_story.html">allege that Shell Oil aided and abetted the Nigerian government in committing</a> horific violations of human rights against protesters of the company’s operations in that country in the 1990s.  According to the several reports I’ve read about yesterday’s argument, Anthony Kennedy, author of the <i>Citizens United</i> opinion, said at the very outset that he agreed with Shell’s statement in its brief that international law does not recognize corporate liability. Case closed.</div>
<div>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>But Elena Kagan (not a personal favorite of mine, for reasons that I’ll leave for another post, but someone who does demonstrate the ability to recognize distinctions in procedural/jurisdictional law in response to Kennedy’s indications that he cannot, and who is not shy about showing it; this is the second time in about a year that Kagan has done that during an oral argument) pointed out that international law addresses the acts that violate universally accepted human rights, but is silent on who can be sued for committing those acts.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>And Samuel Alito and Stephen Breyer agreed. “Let&#8217;s assume that the French ambassador is assaulted or attacked in some way in the United States, and that that attack is by a 10 corporate agents. Would we say that the corporation cannot be sued under the Alien Tort Statute?” <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/supreme_court_dispatches/2012/02/the_supreme_court_considers_whether_royal_dutch_shell_is_immune_from_liability_for_human_rights_abuses_because_it_is_a_corporation_.single.html">Slate’s Dahlia Lithwick quotes</a> Alito as asking Kathleen Sullivan, Shell’s lawyer.  Who responded, “Yes, because there is no assaulting ambassador norm that applies to corporations.” Oh?  Does the State Department’s Foreign Service know this?  
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Lithwick also quotes Sullivan as saying that “Nuremberg, if it established nothing else, established that it is individuals who are liable for human rights offenses.” She must be right that that’s what the Nuremberg trials established, since the Nuremberg prosecutors didn’t indict Volkswagen and try to have it executed. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Breyer suggested that pirates should incorporate themselves, under the name “Pirates, Inc.”  A company in which I want to buy stock, if it ever goes public. Under international securities law.  As established at Nuremberg.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Nuremberg, by the way, didn’t establish “nothing else.”
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Lithwick suggests that a majority of the justices will not say that corporations cannot be sued under the ATS.  Given the 5-4 ruling in Citizens United, the juxtaposition of the two opinions would be too damaging to the Court’s standing among the public.  I agree; after all, the First Amendment doesn’t say that corporations have First Amendment speech rights, nor mention corporations at all, but <i>that</i> didn’t stop the majority of justices from …  well ….
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>But neither do I think the Court will say that the ATS <i>does</i> allow lawsuits against corporations for violations of internationally recognized human rights. I think a majority will decide not to decide that issue at all, in this case.  Instead, a majority will say what Alito said at another point: that the statute was not intended to allow people who have no connection to the United States to sue under the statute for violations of human rights by <i>anyone</i>—human or corporate—that himself/itself has no legal-status connection to the United States and that occurred outside the United States.  The Nuremberg defense will have to await another day to succeed or not.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Alito’s French-ambassador-assaulted-in-the-U.S. hypothetical was not a random fact selection. The purpose of the statute, it was made clear during the argument, was to grant ambassadors to the U.S. the right to sue in U.S. court for violations of human rights committed in the U.S—rights they have long had here anyway.  But this is a very old statute, and apparently predates those rights.  The statute itself doesn’t <i>say</i> that it’s limited to circumstances involving victims or perpetrators who have with legal ties to the U.S.  But, whatever.  
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>I expect that the Court will fill in those blanks.  Although I won’t bet on it. I’ll save my money instead for the Pirates, Inc. IPO.

<p>Pandering to the Right Fringe</p>
<p>This campaign season has revealed more clearly than ever the ultimate goal of today&#8217;s hard right, as manifested in campaign debates and the right-wing think tanks&#8217; output.  It is nothing less than dismantling the protections established under FDR&#8211;Social Security, Medicare, minimum wage and other safety net protections that are nonetheless thinner than most advanced democracies have&#8211;under the guise that these programs are too costly, do not require personal responsibility, and can&#8217;t be afforded under the new right&#8217;s &#8216;realism&#8217; about the deficits.</p>
<p>The right doesn&#8217;t want to afford these programs. Now that it has managed to &#8216;starve the beast&#8217; through the Bush tax cuts, the repetitive stalling on increasing the debt ceiling, and numerous other revenue reduction measures&#8211;especially in the corporate tax provisions&#8211;it will claim that there is simply nothing else to be done but cut the safety net away.</p>
<p>This is mere spin.  Tax increases and judicious stimulus measures can allow us to recover.  Removing the safety net will  thrust the country into a deep recession, since it will impact seniors, dependent children and the most vulnerable.  The poverty increase that we have witnessed over the last few years will continue. Surely this is not what Americans want for their country!</p>
<p>But the politicians continue to preach the failed approaches of Reaganomics, in the claim that their deregulatory and corporate tax cutting agenda will &#8220;revive&#8221; manufacturing.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />Santorum is riding his near-miss in Iowa under the guise of a populist who understands the worries of the downtrodden labor class in America.  The Wall Street Journal (Jan. 7-8, 2012) says that he &#8220;cast[s] himself as an advocate for blue-collar workers and their economically troubled communities, hoping to capitalize on differences with Mr. Romney, a wealthy former private-equity investor and son of a Michigan governor.&#8221;  </p>
<p> Santorum once didn&#8217;t have much money and he has memories of a coal-miner grandfather.  Is that enough to create &#8216;bona fides&#8217; for his views on how we should manage the U.S. economy?    Seeing poverty can help a person to empathize with those in poverty, or it can lead that person to denounce those who remain in poverty as lazy bums who are in poverty from their failure to take the steps the person took to rise above it.  Seeing poverty doesn&#8217;t mean that person understands the kinds of gut-wrenching problems that much of middle America and especially those at the lower end of the distribution are experiencing today&#8211;small towns that are rotting off the map as manufacturing jobs vanish and farms have become corporate enterprises, extensions of Cargill and AMD and Tyson and the few others that dominate the American production of food from seed to harvest to grocer to table. </p>
<p>And the policies that Santorum favors will be extraordinarily destructive of the middle class: they favor the wealthy and corporate enterprises, not the little guy. </p>
<p>Some of the things Santorum is mentioning on the campaign trail might benefit some in the middle class&#8211;like the idea of tripling the exemption for children, though the proposal apparently isn&#8217;t linked to income level and so would not be focused on families that need the help.  (And it would be widely available, adding significantly to the deficit).</p>
<p>The rest of Santorum&#8217;s tax proposals favor the wealthy&#8211;lowering corporate tax rates to half their current level, eliminating corporate tax entirely for manufacturers, eliminating corporate tax on overseas profits that are used to buy manufacturing equipment (not clear whether that applies even if the equipment is used overseas as well, since the current tax code is already too friendly to active overseas businesses), and eliminating taxes on capital income. </p>
<p>Those provisions are most favorable for the wealthy who own most of the corproate stock and other financial assets.  hough the right likes to label these kinds of tax policies &#8216;pro-growth&#8217;, they are in fact a replay of the failed policies of the last 40 years that have resulted in stagnate wages for the middle class and dying small towns, while the beneficiaries of the tax largesse flourish in gated communities.</p>
<p>These tax policies will carve out huge holes in federal revenues, resulting in increased deficits that will be used as justification for decimating earned benefit programs (Social Security, Medicare, and unemployment compensation).  A vicious circle of cutting revenues and then using the loss of revenues to justify cutting important federal programs will leave the middle class (and especially the poor and the near-poor) in even worse condition, as the safety net that is especially needed now is weakened or removed.</p>
<p>These ideas on the right, stale as they are, are getting the kind of attention that cements them in people&#8217;s views, no matter how wrong they are.  In debate after debate, candidates vie with each other to pander to the right.  See, e.g., Santorum Claims Romney&#8217;s Tax PLan Isn&#8217;t Bold Enough, Huff. Post (Jan 9, 2012).  Romney wants to cut taxes and spending and thinks Government is too big, but he at least thinks we need taxes to cover core responsibilities that government should do.  Santorum wants more&#8211;more tax cuts for the wealthy and large corproations. </p>
<p>And when you repeat something over and over, it tends to stick. The American people are hearing these same ideas from every Republican candidate, as they compete to win the radical fringe of the Republican party. </p>
<p>What is worrisome is that progressives are disengaged. They  are miffed about the continuing degradation of civil rights under the continuing &#8220;war&#8221; on terrorism, Obama&#8217;s weakness in not being able to stand up to the Republican minority or even hold to his threat to veto (see, e.g., the pipeline problem) and the way corporate lobbyists are succeeding in causing agencies to weaken or delay important environmental regulations. They are miffed because they had projected onto Obama their specific dreams of revitalization and change, and there is no way that any one person could have satisfied all that.  Much less this person, who was an inexperienced politico with a stable of advisers from Wall Street and past administrations who valued change not one whit. </p>
<p>But it seems fairly obvious that the only hope for progressives is to defeat the resurging right that intends to deregulate, cut taxes and privatize if it gains complete power through control of the White House, House and Senate.</p>

                                <p>by <strong><a href="http://presimetrics.com/">Mike Kimel</a></strong></p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2011/10/steve-rattners-and-amity-shlaes-w-style-economic-policy-.html">Linda Beale</a>, I headed over <a href="http://www.bushcenter.com/downloads/pressReleases/Amity_Schlaes_Press_Release.pdf">here</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The George W. Bush Institute announced today that Amity Shlaes has been named director of the 4% Growth Project, a key part of the Institute’s focus on economic growth. Miss Shlaes will open the project&#8217;s office in New York. The aim of the project is to illuminate ideas and reforms that can yield faster, higher quality growth in the United States, and to underscore the importance of growth in America&#8217;s future. Part of that work involves finding ways to make growth and economics generally accessible to more Americans, especially younger Americans. The program will conduct and sponsor research on all aspects of economic growth, host conferences, as well as partner with other institutions in such endeavors.</p></blockquote>
<p>The following graph, I think, illustrates you need to know about Amity Shlaes:
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-yMzB1D3FDDc/Tp2LNdVRysI/AAAAAAAAAnY/uiVEyy820Rs/s1600/Figure%2B1.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-yMzB1D3FDDc/Tp2LNdVRysI/AAAAAAAAAnY/uiVEyy820Rs/s320/Figure%2B1.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>OK.  I lied.  The graph is actually missing something.  See, we only have <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/xls/gdplev.xls">official data going back to 1929</a>.  And the Great Depression began very, very early in Hoover&#8217;s term.  And Hoover had been a cabinet secretary under Coolidge, and ran for office under a platform which essentially called for continuing Coolidge&#8217;s policies. And Shlaes&#8217; forthcoming book is in praise of Calvin Coolidge.  It should be noted that the economy was in recession during over 38% of the months in which Coolidge took office, which makes much of the Coolidge era a dry run (so to speak) for the monster that would come in 1929.</p>
<p>Put another way&#8230;  Shlaes is part of a movement to praise policies responsible for a lousy economy culminating in the Great Depression (i.e., those of Coolidge and Hoover).  Shlaes is also part of a movement to praise the policies responsible for a lousy economy culminating in the start of the Great Recession and the mess we&#8217;re in today.  (Yes, the Great Recession started in 2007, and no, Obama hasn&#8217;t made any substantial changes on taxes or regulation from the way GW Bush ran the country.)  Conversely, Shlaes is a well-known critic of the policies that produced the fastest period of peace time economic growth this country has seen.</p>
<p>To me this feature of economics is kind of odd.  For some reason, policies that have failed spectacularly over and over continue to have adherents.  Policies that have worked spectacularly have critics.   Debating the merits of a cavalry charge into the teeth of an armored column was barely excusable in August of 1939, but at least that debate was put to a rest by the German blitzkrieg.  Its been generations since anyone argued that horsemen can go toe to toe with tanks.</p>
<p>Which leads me to a hypothetical.  Say we lived in a parallel universe where Shlaes was a quisling, a real villain whose goal was to harm this country as much as she could by convincing the nation to commit economic suicide.  How would the graph above and the two paragraphs that followed it look any different?</p>

<p><strong>The AMT: why we should retain it with minor reforms to protect the true middle class</strong></p>
<p>A commenter on an earlier thread complained about the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT), saying it should be abolished. He seemed somewhat misinformed, suggesting that the alternative to the AMT is better enforcement.It seems that it might be timely to remind readers about the purpose of the AMT, its advantages as well as its flaws, and the way that reform could reasonably be undertaken to better accomplish its purposes. The following is an edited excerpt of my response to that reader on this issue.</p>
<p>The purpose of the AMT is to limit the advantage from aggregating deductions and exclusions and other provisions that are of particular benefit to those with high incomes.</p>
<p>For background, readers may want to read my extensive article on the AMT, available on SSRN at <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=726362.">http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=726362.</a> Or you can skim through the more accessible (and less dense) series of blogposts on the AMT based on the ideas and information in the article, titled &#8220;What Should Congress Do about the AMT?: <a name="more"></a>

<p>The AMT operates (admittedly imperfectly) to reduce the tremendous advantage that the highest-income Americans in the top 20% of the income distribution enjoy from the many deductions, exclusions and outright subsidies built into the tax Code. Many of those deductions and exclusions make some sense if provided to those who otherwise would pay too high a rate of tax&#8212;i.e., the personal exemption, the medical expense deduction&#8211;or if the intent of a transaction would be somewhat undone by taxation&#8211;i.e., the gift exclusion. But many of them don&#8217;t make much sense at all (e.g., the charitable contribution deduction at face value rather than at investment amount; the mortgage interest deduction) and certainly don&#8217;t make sense as a regressive item that provides the greatest benefit to the highest income recipients. The AMT operates to reduce that unmerited advantage by measuring (again, imperfectly) the cumulative effect of preferences that reduce taxes. As tax policy, it has the disadvantage of adding complication and creating some confusion, but the clear advantage of providing another way of ensuring that those with high incomes pay some tax.</p>
<p>
<p>Congress should quit its annual extension of stupid giveaways like the R&#038;D credit, and it should quit its senseless annual extension of the AMT &#8220;patch&#8221;. Instead, it should reform the AMT along the lines that I suggested in the article and series of postings&#8211;by treating the capital gains preferential rate as an AMT preference item (which was done earlier in our more sensible history), by indexing the AMT exemption amount to inflation at an amount that would correspond, in the context of the AMT, to similar protection offered by the regular tax for those in the bottom 60% of the income distribution. The latter step would prevent the problem of the AMT reaching ever lower into the income distribution and thus protect the middle class, while permitting the AMT to operate as it should on the top two income quintiles.</p>

<p>crossposted with Ataxingmatter</p>
<p><em>Note to readers:  sorry for the long absence again&#8211;personal circumstances prevented my blogging for the last several weeks.  I hope that I can again resume regular blogging now, but do apologize for the absence</em>.</p>
<p>The IRS recently released its <a href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/10databk.pdf">2010 Data Book</a>, which describes the agency&#8217;s activities for the 2010 FY ending September 30, 2010. </p>
<p>One important part of the data revealed is a much-needed focus on the compliance of wealthy taxpayers.  IRS Commission Doug Shulman admitted in late 2009 that the agency needed to shift its focus to pay more attention to high-net-worth individuals&#8211;at least in part to reassure ordinary Americans that the rich weren&#8217;t able to avoid compliance (i.e., the idea that they might be able to avoid paying taxes simply because they had lots of money and could seek out tax shelters unavailable to the rest of us).  The IRS created a group within the agency focused on &#8220;global high wealth&#8221; individuals&#8211;those with $10 million or more.  Plans for the group required increased audits as a way to call attention to the problems and for the agency to teach itself more about the ways that these high-wealth individuals maintain their wealth and receive their income.  The Data Book shows that the IRS audited 18.4% of those high-income taxpayers in FY 2010, up considerably from the rate of 10.6% the prior fiscal year.</p>
<p> <a name="more"></a>
<p>The release describing the databooks highlights the following information&#8211;including the fact that tax revenues are down compared to prior years.</p>
<p>During fiscal year 2010, the IRS collected $2.3 trillion in revenue, and processed 230 million returns. More than 116 million returns, including almost 70 percent of individual income tax returns, were filed electronically. More than 119 million individual income tax return filers received a tax refund, totaling $358 billion. In fiscal year 2010, IRS spent an average of 53 cents to collect each $100 of tax revenue.</p>
<p>The IRS examined more than 1.5 million individual income tax returns and nearly 30,000 returns filed by corporations, excluding S corporations. The IRS provided taxpayer assistance through 305 million visits to IRS.gov and assisted more than 78 million taxpayers through its telephone helpline or at walk-in sites.</p>
