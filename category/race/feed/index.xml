				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of my favorite paper presentations ever was by Daniel Parent, who is a good enough reason in himself for pending Labor Economists to apply to <a href="http://www.hec.ca/en/">HEC</a>. He was trying to present data on income inequalities in the Financial Services industry and was forced to note—all right, I asked—that they didn&#8217;t have the data to determine if there was a racial difference in earnings because there wasn&#8217;t enough data on high-earning Blacks in the sample to be &#8220;statistically significant.&#8221;  Since the sample used IRS data, among other sources, the answer was clear.</p>
<p>Now (via <a href="http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2011/05/sentences-to-ponder-11.html">Tyler Cowen</a>), I see that &#8220;not statistically significant&#8221; is not just for Financial Services Executives; <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/ideas-market/2011/05/18/republican-and-democratic-professors-grade-differently/">the WSJ&#8217;s markets blog notes</a>:<br />
<blockquote>On average, Republican professors gave black students grades that were .2 of a grade point lower than their Democratic colleagues, or about two-thirds of the distance between a B and a B-minus.</p>
<p>(Among eleven black professors in the sample, there were no Republicans, and the Democrats appeared to grade white and black students as their white-Democratic peers did. But <em>there were too few black professors to make that finding statistically significant</em>.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Again, the finding may not be statistically significant, but the sample, er, complection is.</p>
<p>Their data set is available <a href="http://www.aeaweb.org/aej-applied/accepted_single.php?id=678&#038;jrnl=app">here</a>.</p>
<p>UPDATE:  Thoreau <a href="http://highclearing.com/index.php/archives/2011/05/20/12966">riffs on the subject</a> and finds <a href="http://pluto.huji.ac.il/~azussman/partisan_grading.pdf">a link to the paper</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This cannot be true, can it?</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/2289453/louisiana_justice_of_the_peace_denies.html">Louisiana Justice of the Peace Denies Marriage License to Interracial Couple</a>:<br />
<blockquote>According to [Keith Bardwell, a justice of the peace in Tangipahoa Parish], he won&#8217;t support interracial marriages because he doesn&#8217;t feel that black or white society will accept the children of the couple once they are born.</p></blockquote>
<p>I can&#8217;t find him in Martindale-Hubbell, but other articles note <a target="_blank" href="http://www.zimbio.com/Keith+Bardwell/articles/cL4BpHco2WS/Keith+Bardwell+Louisiana+Justice+Peace+Refuses">him saying</a>:<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been a justice of the peace for 34 years and I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve mistreated anybody. I&#8217;ve made some mistakes, but you have too. I didn&#8217;t tell this couple they couldn&#8217;t get married. I just told them I wouldn&#8217;t do it.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
