<p>Actually, murky is something of a good thing when referring to business cycle dynamics. It usually means that a bottom is forming.</p>
<p>In some sense, the key to recovery is the stabilization of home values. If home values would just “stop” declining – I understand that there is a market mechanism going on here that is pushing home values to (or even below) an equilibrium – then the banking system can get on with its solvency issues. (<a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2009/08/banks-sitting-on-bad-mortgages-and-they.html" target="_blank">Naked Capitalism has a nice piece today</a> on banks not foreclosing in order to avoid further writedowns.) Let’s see what’s going on in the US from the perspective of several indicators.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www2.standardandpoors.com/spf/pdf/index/CSHomePrice_Release_082562.pdf">S&#038;P/Case-Shiller</a> and the <a href="http://www.fhfa.gov/webfiles/14801/FINAL2q09hpi.pdf">Federal Housing Finance Agency</a> (FHFA) reported their quarterly house price indexes today. Interestingly enough, the two (Q2 2009)reports diverge.</p>
<p>The S&#038;P/Case-Shiller marked a quarterly gain of about 1.4%, while the FHFA reported a quarterly loss of about 0.7%. Is this the start of an interesting story on the downside? On the upside, the Case-Shiller index showed a much larger bubble in home values relative to imputed rents. Will the FHFA show a deeper trough than the Case-Shiller?</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/SpQTla9C32I/AAAAAAAACcM/J8xmSJ4rPi0/s1600-h/bubble_chart.PNG"><img alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/SpQTla9C32I/AAAAAAAACcM/J8xmSJ4rPi0/s320/bubble_chart.PNG" border="0"></a></p>
<p>The chart illustrates the price to imputed rent ratio for the two measures of national real estate values. This can be thought as the tangible asset equivalent to a corporate stock price to earnings, or price to dividend, ratio. It measures the value relative to the flow of ownership gains, as represented by the imputed rent series measured by the BLS (owner occupied rent <a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.t01.htm">in the CPI table</a>).</p>
<p>It is unlikely that the quarterly FHFA index will depart from the positive trend for too much longer (if indeed, it has stabilized), as the monthly index is showing more consistent gains over the last three months.</p>
<p>This is kind of interesting &#8211; the Case-Shiller, which includes foreclosures, is likely catching the upswing in foreclosure demand, while the FHFA is grabbing more of the downward trend in the &#8220;average&#8221; mortgage. But the LoanPerformance home price index likewise includes subprime loans and foreclosures, and it is showing some life (see chart below). Below is the 3-month annualized growth rate over the last two years for a cross-section of home value indicators. (In most cases, the monthly indexes are a subset of the national index.)</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/SpQUBWtuReI/AAAAAAAACcU/boNNFFQ2cow/s1600-h/3-moann.chart.PNG"><img alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/SpQUBWtuReI/AAAAAAAACcU/boNNFFQ2cow/s320/3-moann.chart.PNG" border="0"></a></p>
<p>One indicator to note <a href="http://www.loanperformance.com/products/hpi.aspx"> is the LoanPerformance house price index (LPHPI)</a>, which is used by the Fed to estimate the value of real estate in the flow of funds accounts, and is growing at a 9.1% annualized rate. States seeing at least a 4% 3-month gain include Ohio, Wisconsin, New York, Virginia, South Carolina, Georgia.</p>
<p>Likewise, the median existing home price and new home values are reported. These series are not seasonally adjusted; and therefore, are not extremely helpful in this context. But the 3-month existing home values remain in positive territory, although at a slowing rate of improvement. It should be noted that the median home prices is a cruder measure of home values – the Case Shiller and FHFA were developed in order to overcome the limitations of thinking in terms of the “median”.</p>
<p>So it looks like there is a chance that home values stabilize before 2010. We will see, as a 1 quarter increase by the Case Shiller index, although positive, is far from a trend.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>The editors of the WSJ <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/07/every-time-i-tr.html">agree with Brad DeLong</a> that the Fannie/Freddie problem is that their short-term cash flows may be(come) impaired:<br />
<blockquote>The most immediate danger is that investors will shrink from rolling over the debt of the two companies, leading to a run a la Bear Stearns&#8230;.With so much on the line, we&#8217;ve been suggesting that Treasury and Congress step up now with a public capital injection to help [Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac] ride out their losses.</p></blockquote>
<p>So let me see.  The solution to avoiding spending taxpayer monies is&#8230;spending taxpayer monies?  Let&#8217;s see how quickly they backtrack:<br />
<blockquote>Yes, this would mean putting some taxpayer cash up front, but in the cause of avoiding the far greater risk of a collapse or Bear-like run. If the capital injection was made in the form of a subordinated debt or preferred stock offer, taxpayers would get a stake in the companies and some return on their investment once the crisis passes.</p></blockquote>
<p>Isn&#8217;t this usually what gets done in the &#8220;free market&#8221;?  In fact, iirc, The Big C has done this a few times recently.*  Why should FNMA and FHLMC be different?<br />
<blockquote>We haven&#8217;t suddenly become socialists. What taxpayers need to understand is that Fannie and Freddie already practice socialism, albeit of the dishonest kind. Their profit is privatized but their risk is socialized. We&#8217;re proposing a more honest form of socialism, with the prospect of long-term reform. [emphasis mine]</p></blockquote>
<p>The above paragraph is something I could have written.  And probably have.  And it only gets better:<br />
<blockquote>In return for putting up the cash, the taxpayers would also need some reassurance that this Fan and Fred debacle couldn&#8217;t happen again. Thus their regulator would need the power to shrink their portfolios of mortgage-backed securities that have made them such high-risk monsters, and ultimately to wind the companies down. Apart from outright failure, the worst scenario would be a capital injection that left the companies free to commit the same mayhem all over again two or 10 years from now.</p></blockquote>
<p>You got it, folks.  The WSJ has just come out in favor of (1) a government bailout and (2) more regulation of, effectively, an industry.**</p>
<p>But wait.  Did you catch the shift?  Let&#8217;s try it again:<br />
<blockquote>Thus their regulator would need the power to shrink their portfolios of mortgage-backed securities that have made them such high-risk monsters, and ultimately to wind the companies down.</p></blockquote>
<p>Whoop, there it is!  Same old WSJ.  Save the mortgage market just to destroy it. Which must be why, since (see the DeLong link above) Fannie and Freddie are solvent in the long-term, they go on to object to one option:<br />
<blockquote>On Friday, Senate Banking Chairman Christopher Dodd (D., Conn.) declared that Fannie and Freddie are &#8220;fundamentally strong,&#8221; that fears about their capital are overwrought, and that &#8220;this is not a time to be panicking about this. These are viable, strong institutions.&#8221; Yet he also said that one option under discussion is to let the two companies borrow from the Federal Reserve&#8217;s discount window.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let&#8217;s see.  We have a short-term cash flow issue that <em>may</em> arise. Two possible solutions are: (1) ensure that the firms have a borrowing line available that is both <strong>higher</strong> than the FedFunds rate*** and perfectly in keeping with the implicit guarantee of their loans or (2) add some cash now, but with the goal of eliminating the firms, probably just about the time the U.S. housing market starts to recover.</p>
<p>If that second is the case, will their auditors be allowed to say, &#8220;Since you don&#8217;t intend this to be an ongoing concern, we aren&#8217;t going to bother to dig too deeply?&#8221;</p>
<p>The WSJ piece ends with a classic &#8220;disregard what we&#8217;ve said for the past several years, especially the David Malpass and Larry Kudlow editorials&#8221;:<br />
<blockquote>If there&#8217;s any other good news in all this, it is that the scandal of Fannie and Freddie is at last coming into public focus. The Washington political class has nurtured and subsidized these financial beasts for decades in return for their campaign cash and lobbying support. Wall Street and the homebuilders also cashed in on the subsidized business, and also paid back Congress in cash and carry.</p>
<p>The losers have been the taxpayers, who will now have to pay the price for this collusion. Maybe the press corps will even start reporting how this vast confidence game could happen.</p></blockquote>
<p>Dear Press Corps: please start by examining the WSJ&#8217;s continual &#8220;everything is good because house values keep appreciating&#8221; pieces.</p>
<p>*Yes, I know they have.  Just don&#8217;t have time to find links now.<br />**Since Fannie and Freddie-backed mortgages make up a large majority of the industry; op. cit. <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2008/06/so-much-for-free-markets-federally.html">here</a>.<br />***I&#8217;ll stop making fun of the &#8220;Discount&#8221; Rate when it goes back to being a Discount Rate.  Possibly, the next President will be sane.</p>

                                <p>John Carney at Dealbreaker notes <a href="http://dealbreaker.com/2008/07/why_a_fannie_mae_conservatorsh.php">the official reason</a> the White House prefers that the government takeover Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac:<br />
<blockquote>The reason the Bush administration is leaning toward bringing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac into conservatorship rather than backstopping the two home mortgage companies is that concern about moral hazard problem. Bailing out Fannie and Freddie would reward years of aggressive use of financial mismanagement, according to some members of the administration.</p></blockquote>
<p>When I stopped laughing at the idea that <a href="http://www.buzzflash.com/contributors/03/04/23_resume.html">George W. Bush-led administration</a> would object to the government rewarding financial mismanagement, I found Carney had actually admitted the real reason:<br />
<blockquote>In the Old Executive building and the White House, Fannie Mae is viewed by many as a hotbed of waste, fraud, abuse and Democratic featherbedding.</p></blockquote>
<p>Whereas &#8220;<a href="http://www.halliburton.com/">fraud</a>, <a href="http://www.blackwaterusa.com/">abuse</a>,and <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5148982">Republican featherbedding</a>&#8221; are the rule of the day.</p>
<p>But then Carney goes off the deep end:<br />
<blockquote>What&#8217;s worse, the administration believes that both companies failed their public mission of making housing affordable.</p></blockquote>
<p>Uh, this is the administration that argued for the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/23/opinion/23krugman.html?hp=&#038;pagewanted=print">ownership society</a>, right?  The Administration that trumpeted the (temporary) growth in home ownership over the past five or so years as proof its policies were working?  The same people who decided that the cap on Fannie/Freddie loans needed to be <em>raised</em> from $417,500 are now worrying about &#8220;making housing affordable&#8221;?? (Which is different, clearly, from making housing affordable.)</p>
<p>Do they believe all those new owners were financed solely by <a href="http://my.countrywide.com/">Countrywide</a> and <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB121581435073947103.html?mod=hpp_us_whats_news">Indymac</a> [LINK UPDATED] and other well-run, profitable, free-market companies such as <a href="http://www.bearstearns.com/">The Old Firm</a> or <a href="http://dealbreaker.com/2008/07/lehman_gets_murdered_by_fannie.php">Lehman</a>?</p>
<p>The normally-astute Yves Smith was <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2008/06/so-much-for-free-markets-federally.html">complaining a while back</a> about the fact that Fannie and Freddie (and FHA) are virtually The Only Lenders left in the market.  It&#8217;s possible that the move back to being government entities (as opposed to GSEs) will strengthen, or even reinvigorate, the housing market.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s not the way to bet.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p><a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/06/next-stop-pottersville.html">Tom already hit</a> this <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/23/opinion/23krugman.html?pagewanted=print">Paul Krugman column</a>, so I&#8217;ll just put together a list:
<ol>
<li>&#8220;I.R.S. lets you deduct mortgage interest from your taxable income but doesn’t let you deduct rent&#8221; But not mortgage <strong>principal</strong>. And the interest deduction still leaves an owner out of pocket for at least 65%—probably more.</li>
<li>&#8220;[I]f the market value of the house falls, the buyer can easily lose his or her entire stake.&#8221; But they still own the house, and still get to live there.  (If I buy a corporate bond, the market price may also decline below par—but it&#8217;s an <em>unrealised</em> loss. If the corporation declares bankruptcy and the Delaware courts are corrupt [oh, wait&#8230;], then I lose that investment too—and I have nothing to show for it.)  So when Krugman says, possibly accurately, that &#8220;there are probably around 10 million households with negative home equity,&#8221; he doesn&#8217;t mean that they&#8217;re on the streets.  He just means they&#8217;re not making a profit.*</li>
<li>&#8220;Owning a home also ties workers down.&#8221;  No argument here; how is this a benefit to homeowners?</li>
<li>&#8220;Buying a home usually though not always means buying a single-family house in the suburbs, often a long way out, where land is cheap.&#8221; Again, no argument, though I would assume homebuyers would consider the Total Cost of Ownership. And, again, how is this a benefit to homeowners?</li>
</ol>
<p>So Krugman has presented at least two (arguably three, if you forget that Dean Baker, for instance, profited well by selling his home in 2003 or 2004) negative externalities to home ownership in an 800-word column.  Those seem as if they might well be worth that deduction on mortgage interest.** </p>
<p>*As I&#8217;ve noted elsewhere, there are &#8220;homeowners&#8221; on Lon Gisland who bought in 1989 and couldn&#8217;t &#8220;afford&#8221; to move until at least 2002. And that was without the Bush administration&#8217;s, er, help.<br />**Though, if you think about it, in a standard mortgage, the deduction has a declining value the longer one stays.  Then again, the value of stability is not minor, and probably compensates for the minor decline in the interest deduction.</p>

<blockquote>Owning a home also ties workers down. Even in the best of times, the costs and hassle of selling one home and buying another — one estimate put the average cost of a house move at more than $60,000 — tend to make workers reluctant to go where the jobs are.</p></blockquote>
<p>Do we liberals really want to be making the case that society would be better off on net if more of the citizenry were effectively rootless migrant workers?</p>
<p>This is an area where there&#8217;s <a href="http://ideas.repec.org/p/use/tkiwps/0401.html">at least some conflict</a> between the macro- and micro-level evidence, and the more theoretically compelling micro evidence is less supportive of the view that there&#8217;s harmful causality from homeownership to labor market macro-features.</p>
<p>(It doesn&#8217;t help that the $60K figure for the &#8220;one estimate&#8221; of a typical move cost comes across as highly bogus.  Commission on a ~$200K median house at 6% is around 12 grand.  I&#8217;d guess typical search, moving [i.e. shipping], and closing costs would be of a similar magnitude.  Other things equal, search and moving costs would be incurred in moves absent homeownership and aren&#8217;t appropriately included in a figure intended to express relocation costs specific to owning.  Likewise, commissions and closing costs for homeownership should be expressed net of rental transactions costs.)</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/marketsmag/mm_1007_story2.html">Bloomberg Magazine, in &#8220;Unsafe Havens&#8221;</a>. (Hat tip to <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2007/09/some-money-market-funds-have-large.html">Naked Capitalism</a>.)</p>
<blockquote><p>reports that money market funds run by Bank of America Corp., Credit Suisse Group, Fidelity Investments and Morgan Stanley owned over $6 billion of CDOs with subprime debt in June.</p>
<p>The reason this is a serious issue is that money market funds have a $1 NAV, meaning &#8220;net asset value&#8221; rule. The funds are required by the SEC to invest conservatively. In practice, they always to maintain principal value. But as the article explains, this sort of investment puts the funds at risk of breaching the $1 NAV requirement.</p>
<p>What this article tells us, in effect, is that investors weren&#8217;t completely nuts to have dumped money market funds for Treasuries in August. Of course, they probably should have called the fund manager first, since most large fund management firms, such as Vanguard, correctly see this sort of paper as in appropriate for a money market fund.</p>
<p>The article is quite long but very much worth reading in its entirety; we&#8217;ve excepted the juicy bits. From Bloomberg Magazine:</p>
<p>Unbeknownst to most investors, some of the largest money market funds today are putting part of their cash into one of the riskiest debt investments in the world: collateralized debt obligations backed by subprime mortgage loans&#8230;.</p>
<p>Money market funds with total assets of $300 billion have invested in subprime debt this year&#8230;.</p>
<p>Under SEC rules, money market managers must invest in securities with &#8220;minimal credit risks.&#8221; Joseph Mason, a finance professor at Drexel University in Philadelphia and a former economist at the U.S. Treasury Department, says subprime debt in money market funds is far from safe.</p>
<p>&#8220;This creates tremendous risk for today&#8217;s money market investors,&#8221; says Mason, who wrote an 84-page report on CDOs this year. &#8220;Right now, I&#8217;m not comfortable investing anything in CDOs.&#8221;&#8230;.</p>
<p>On Aug. 9, BNP Paribas SA, France&#8217;s biggest bank by market value, froze withdrawals on three investment funds with assets of 2 billion euros because the bank couldn&#8217;t find a way to value its U.S. subprime bonds and other assets. CDOs aren&#8217;t bought and sold on exchanges and their trading has little transparency&#8230;.</p>
<p>Bruce Bent, who in 1970 created the first money market fund, The Reserve Fund, says no money market fund should invest in subprime debt.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s inappropriate,&#8221; Bent, 70, says. &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t have a place in money market funds. When I created the first money market fund, I said you have to have immediate liquidity, safety and a reasonable rate of return. You also have to have a situation where you&#8217;re not giving people headline risk.&#8221;</p>
<p>Investors have sought safety during the subprime meltdown by moving their holdings to U.S. Treasuries and money market funds. On Aug. 8, just after the Bear Stearns hedge funds filed for bankruptcy protection, U.S. money market fund total assets reached a record high of $2.66 trillion, with investors pouring $49 billion into such funds in one week, according to the ICI.</p></blockquote>
<p>Reader Jack asked about money disappearing. Some was pure vapor wares in a bidding war for promises on ROI. Other money came from what were safe havens of money markets, municipal bonds, and other financial vehicles that were supposed to be only steady and safe.</p>
<p>Springfield MA sued and won their $14 million from Merryl Lynch based on their agent&#8217;s inappropriate behavior by disregarding the town&#8217;s mandate of investment vehicles.</p>

                                <p>Here is an observation from the <a href="http://www.irvinehousingblog.com/2008/03/01/wot-3-1-2008/">Irvine Housing blog</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>It takes at least 300 days from the time of mortgage reset to the time the REO is listed on the open market. This process can drag on much longer if the borrower attempts to make payments on the new schedule. Borrowers may drain other resources such as credit cards or retirement savings to postpone default.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/R8n2Ic54AfI/AAAAAAAABAs/m6cazWlM2qE/s1600-h/irvine+housing+blog+-+resets.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/R8n2Ic54AfI/AAAAAAAABAs/m6cazWlM2qE/s320/irvine+housing+blog+-+resets.jpg" border="0"></a></p>
<blockquote><p>Once the property becomes REO, the lender may not quickly and efficiently prepare it for sale. Most lenders do not have sufficient staff to deal with the large number of REOs they currently have, and the numbers are growing daily. Plus the loss mitigation procedures often demand higher prices for 90 days before the price cuts get more aggressive. Basically, it will take at least one year between the reset and the final sale in the open market, and 18 months is probably a more realistic timeframe.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>The current REO pool is composed of those who gave up even before their loans reset. The huge number of resets and ensuing foreclosures is just now starting to hit the market. Today, we are beginning month 15 on the chart, but the impact on the market is at best in month 3 and more realistically, it is just now starting.</p></blockquote>
<p>Note &#8211; emphasis mine.</p>
<p>Anyway, my mostly uneducated guess (what little I know comes mostly from <a href="http://calculatedrisk.blogspot.com/">Calculated Risk</a> and the Irvine Housing blog and my own limited observations about the market) is that there&#8217;s a long way to go. Across the street from our <strike>hovel</strike> apartment is <strike>another hovel</strike> a tiny home &#8211; one bathroom, two bedrooms, on a small lot. Sure, it was nicely remodeled, but this is Silver Lake, about ten minutes from downtown Los Angeles &#8211; a somewhat artsy bohemian community not located atop a newly discovered oil deposit. The current owners paid about $800K for it, a year ago. I imagine if it went on the market now, that price would be down at least $100K.</p>
<p>Perhaps I&#8217;m wrong, but my mind simply doesn&#8217;t accept that the place across the street is worth more than $150K (in 2000 dollars). I figure when I see the house offered for that price, the market will be back to normal. And a lot of people are going to go through a lot of pain in the process.</p>

                                <p><i>My thoughts are with the residents of New Orleans and the Gulf Coast tonight.</i></p>
<p>This week two prominent economists predicted a housing bust and possible recession in &#8217;06; three if you count Chairman Greenspan. Actually Greenspan&#8217;s comments, made at the Federal Reserve&#8217;s Jackson Hole Conference, were not predictions, but general observations. Quoting from Greenspan&#8217;s closing remarks (emphasis added):<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;&#8230; the housing boom will inevitably simmer down. As part of that process, house turnover will decline from currently historic levels, while home price increases will slow and prices could even decrease. As a consequence, <i>home equity extraction will ease and with it some of the strength in personal consumption expenditures.</i> The estimates of how much differ widely.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>There is no question that equity extraction has been an important driver of consumer spending over the last few years. Even if housing prices remain elevated, a housing slowdown will lead to lower equity extraction, lower consumer spending and an economic slowdown. How much will the economy slow? Estimates &#8220;differ widely&#8221;. But clearly there is reason for concern; from Greenspan&#8217;s opening comments:<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;&#8230; newly abundant liquidity can readily disappear. Any onset of increased investor caution elevates risk premiums and, as a consequence, lowers asset values and promotes the liquidation of the debt that supported higher prices. This is the reason that <i>history has not dealt kindly with the aftermath of protracted periods of low risk premiums.</i>&#8220;</p></blockquote>
<p>Is Greenspan predicting a recession? Maybe. Princeton economist Dr. Krugman went much further predicting the housing bubble would &#8220;burst&#8221; soon:<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;I&#8217;ll give you a forecast which might very well be wrong, but I think it will burst in the spring of next year,&#8221; he said at a derivatives conference in Brazil&#8217;s winter resort of Campos do Jordao.</p></blockquote>
<p>As all economists do, Krugman then offered some caveats (see <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2005/08/25/news/economy/housing_bubble.reut/">article</a>). Dr. Leamer, of UCLA&#8217;s Anderson Forecast, also <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,167141,00.html">suggested</a> that a recession was very likely:<br />
<blockquote>In Leamer&#8217;s view, the housing market appears to have peaked &#8220;in California and elsewhere. It will take more than a year for this weakness to turn into job losses and to affect the economy in general.&#8221;</p>
<p>And, yes, he&#8217;s using the &#8220;R&#8221; word. As in &#8220;recession.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>If housing has peaked, why will it take a year for the economy to slide into recession? I believe Dr. Leamer is relying on historical evidence that shows recessions start about 8 to 12 months after the number of housing transactions peak. Here is a look at the last three consumer recessions (four counting the &#8217;80s double dip). The gray area signifies that the economy was in recession based on the National Bureau of Economic Research&#8217;s <a href="http://www.nber.org/cycles.html/">cycle dates</a>. Even both recessions in the early &#8217;80s were preceded by significant declines in sales volume.</p>

<p><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/img/243/2888/640/80NewHomeSales.jpg"><img src="http://photos1.blogger.com/img/243/2888/320/80NewHomeSales.jpg" border="0"></a></p>
<p><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/img/243/2888/640/90NewHomeSale.jpg"><img src="http://photos1.blogger.com/img/243/2888/320/90NewHomeSale.jpg" border="0"></a></p>
<p>I believe this historical evidence is the reason Dr. Leamer is suggesting &#8220;it will take more than a year&#8221; for the housing slowdown to impact the economy.</p>
<p>It is possible that the economy will slow sooner this time since housing is a much larger percentage of the economy. Also, unlike the previous periods, housing is now the main engine of the economy. This is especially true when the substantial contribution of equity extraction to consumer spending is included. Even if housing prices stay stable, lower equity extraction could lead to significantlyly lower consumer spending, as has happened in the UK.</p>
<p>As an aside, the Bank of England rate cut hasn&#8217;t helped the <a href="http://today.reuters.co.uk/news/newsArticle.aspx?type=businessNews&#038;storyID=2005-08-28T232104Z_01_KWA884030_RTRUKOC_0_UK-ECONOMY-BRITAIN-HOMETRACK.xml">UK housing</a> market:<br />
<blockquote>House prices in England and Wales fell for the 14th straight month in August for an annual rate of decline of 3.7 percent, a survey showed on Monday.</p></blockquote>
<p>And I see Fleckenstein is declaring: <a href="http://moneycentral.msn.com/content/P123683.asp">It&#8217;s RIP for the housing boom</a>. It is possible that housing has peaked (in transaction volumes), but we cannot be sure for several months.</p>
