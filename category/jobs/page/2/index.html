                                <p>There was an interesting blog post over at the <a href="http://macroblog.typepad.com/macroblog/productivity/">Macroblog</a> (Atlanta Fed) regarding productivity. John Robertson and Pedro Silos highlight the contributions to GDP growth from various factors, including productivity and employment. <a href="http://macroblog.typepad.com/macroblog/productivity/">One of their findings</a>:<br />
<blockquote>As this chart shows, relatively high labor productivity growth during a recession is not a phenomenon isolated to the 2007–09 and 2001 recessions (for present purposes, the end of the most recent recession is identified with the trough in GDP in the second quarter of 2009). All recessions from WWII through 1970 also featured sizable growth in labor productivity.</p></blockquote>
<p>The article focuses on the contribution of productivity gains to GDP growth during a recession and the early stages of the recovery. The authors do not comment on, however, a very interesting bit of their story: the “hourless” recovery. <a href="http://www.frbatlanta.org/news/speeches/lockhart_060310.cfm">Lockhart speaks of this curtly in his speech</a> &#8211; the focus of the macroblog article:<br />
<blockquote>Current data on the use of part-time workers suggest that businesses have some scope to increase hours without hiring new full-time employees.</p></blockquote>
<p>The precipitous drop in hours worked has differentiated this labor downturn from previous cycles (papers <a href="http://www.frbsf.org/publications/economics/letter/2009/el2009-18.html">here</a> and <a href="http://www.frbsf.org/publications/economics/letter/2010/el2010-07.html">here</a>). According to the <a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/prod2.toc.htm">BLS Q1 2010 productivity report</a>, the recovery of the 2007-2009 recession has so far been “hourless”, which is consistent with the previous two cycles.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/TBiz4gQovSI/AAAAAAAADHo/oAYsKAdIW94/s1600/productivity_chart.png"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/TBiz4gQovSI/AAAAAAAADHo/oAYsKAdIW94/s400/productivity_chart.png" alt="" border="0"></a><a name="more"></a>The chart illustrates the contributions to output growth from hours and productivity for the the first three quarters of recovery spanning the last six recessions. Note: the current recession has not <a href="http://www.nber.org/cycles.html">officially been dated</a> as having ended, but <a href="http://www.frbatlanta.org/news/speeches/lockhart_060310.cfm">June or July 2009</a> is the &#8220;whisper&#8221; talk for now. I will simply call Q3 2009 as the onset of the recovery, since GDP grew that quarter.</p>
<p>The &#8220;hourless recovery&#8221; is underway: a cumulative 3.3% of output has been generated over the last three quarters (using the BLS productivity report) via a 0.9% drop in aggregate hours. <a href="http://www.newsneconomics.com/2009/08/can-firms-simply-add-hours-to-recover.html">I argued </a>last year that adding back hours cannot generate sufficient output growth for sustainable &#8220;recovery&#8221;; however, productivity growth has been strong enough that the productive hours cycle has not even begun.</p>
<p>It’s likely that the large service sector is the drag that is driving the “hourless” recovery because manufacturing hours are red hot.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/TBj6TVVuUdI/AAAAAAAADHw/ol3AxxGR1N0/s1600/weekly_hours.PNG"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/TBj6TVVuUdI/AAAAAAAADHw/ol3AxxGR1N0/s400/weekly_hours.PNG" alt="" border="0"></a>(The weekly hours series are indexed to 100 for comparison.)</p>
<p>The chart illustrates average weekly hours of <a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t23.htm">production and nonsupervisory workers</a> in manufacturing and private industry payroll. Manufacturing weekly hours, 41.5 hours per week in May 2010, recovered 5% off the low of 39.4 hours in March 2009. Furthermore, May 2010 set a ten year record, breaking past levels not seen since July 2000 (not shown in chart but you can see it <a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/AWHMAN?cid=11">here</a>). In contrast, total private weekly hours remain below pre-recession levels, just 1.5% off of the June 2009 low, 33.0 hours.</p>
<p>The BLS breaks down average weekly hours <a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t18.htm">for all workers by industry since 2006</a>. The service sector is the lion&#8217;s share of the private payroll (~85%). Of the service sector payroll, 68% remains short of pre-recession weekly hours worked: <a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/AWHAETTU?cid=11">trade, transportation, and utilities</a>, <a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/AWHAEPBS?cid=11">professional and business services</a>, and <a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/AWHAEEHS?cid=11">education and health services</a>.</p>
<p>Adding hours still won’t provide a large growth impetus, as <a href="http://www.newsneconomics.com/2009/08/can-firms-simply-add-hours-to-recover.html">I argued here</a>; however, the service industry has yet to see the burst in hours like in manufacturing. As such, I agree with the overall conclusions of the <a href="http://macroblog.typepad.com/macroblog/productivity/">Robertson and Silos article</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Hence, it will probably take awhile to see how President Lockhart&#8217;s forecast of continued modest employment growth pans out.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Five Million Jobs?</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;It is remarkable, in view of the virtual unanimity of opinion among economists as to the general shape of the relationship between hours and output, that the effect of hours shortening has received so little attention in published projections. It is often completely ignored even in their description.&#8221; – Edward F. Denison, &#8220;Employment and Hours of Work: Their Contribution to Past Growth and a Projection of the Future&#8221; in The Sources of Economic Growth, 1962.</p></blockquote>
<p>In the early 1960s, Edward Denison, the founder of growth accounting, estimated that roughly one-tenth of the economic growth that occurred between 1909 and 1958 in the U.S. could be attributed to the &#8220;effect of shorter hours on [the] quality of a man-hour&#8217;s work.&#8221; That would have translated into approximately three million jobs created &#8212; except Denison also assumed that the optimal working time for output was 48.6 hours a week, 52 weeks a year (the 1929 annual average)! So he subtracted &#8220;the effect of shorter hours on [the] quality of a man-year&#8217;s work&#8221; from his estimate of growth, leaving an implied net loss of around 200,000 jobs over the 48-year period. What those calculations show, more than anything, is how sensitive any employment projections are to the framing assumptions. We will soon have occasion to tweak these assumptions to generate a range of employment estimates, but first a word about the long-term trend in hours of work.</p>
<p>Joseph Zeisel, writing in the Bureau of Labor Statistics  Monthly Labor Review in 1958 called the long-term decline in the industrial workweek, &#8220;one of the most persistent and significant trends in the American economy in the past century.&#8221; That is, it had been a persistent and significant trend up until around 1940. After a brief spike during World War II, however, the length of the average workweek in manufacturing quickly receded to pre-war levels and then remained essentially unchanged for 65 years, with only minor, short-lived fluctuations reflecting the ebb and flow of the business cycle. By March 2010, the average manufacturing workweek lasted six minutes longer than it had in August 1945.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TBQiaNTfi_I/AAAAAAAAAKk/nvoTdOVxoxM/s1600/sandwich1.bmp"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TBQiaNTfi_I/AAAAAAAAAKk/nvoTdOVxoxM/s320/sandwich1.bmp" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>The chart above shows the decline in weekly manufacturing hours from 1850 to 1950, the levelling off of hours after World War II and a trendline extrapolating from the 1850-1950 rate of decline. In the broader economy, annual hours of work continued to decline after World War II, but at a slower rate than they had previously.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />Furthermore, the increased participation of women and students in the workforce, a sectoral shift of employment away from manufacturing and toward services and the expansion of part-time work contributed to the post-war decline in annual hours. Annual hours for full-time workers showed even less movement. The chart below shows &#8220;potential&#8221; and actual annual hours from 1909 to 1958 as reported by Denison and annual hours from 1950 to 2009 as reported by the Conference Board&#8217;s Total Economy Database.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TBQj4qNgTDI/AAAAAAAAAK0/iNmILDojy_E/s1600/sndwich2.bmp"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TBQj4qNgTDI/AAAAAAAAAK0/iNmILDojy_E/s320/sndwich2.bmp" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Had the annual hours of work continued to decline at the rate they did from 1909 to 1958, average annual hours in 2009 would have been about 14% lower than they were. What might the effect on job creation have been? Recall that Denison&#8217;s estimates were based on his assumption that the optimal length of the workweek for total output was 48.6 hours, 52 weeks a year. He also supposed that maximum productivity would occur at 33.9 hours a week. Below that latter figure, output was assumed to fall faster than hours as hours declined. But is it reasonable to assume that the optimal hours for both output and hourly productivity would remain the same from 1909to 2009? No. </p>
<p>Not unless we are prepared to defend the proposition that technology has remained unchanged or that the optima are unaffected by technology. <br />To estimate the job creating potential of shorter hours, I assume that the trend of hours of work from 1909 to 1958 approximates the amount of working time that would be optimal for output. This suggests that in 1909 the optimal workweek was indeed 52 hours and in 1958 it was 39.6 hours. Projecting that trend indicates an optimal workweek of 29 hours in 2009 (or, alternatively, 32 hours a week with five weeks&#8217; vacation). Since a longer than optimal week subtracts output from the optimal potential, we can estimate that about six and a half percent of potential output was wasted by excessive hours of work.* That is to say, people were too worn out to produce as much as they otherwise could have. In terms of jobs lost, this represents over five million jobs. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve used some fairly conservative benchmarks to anchor the trendline. If I had chosen 1940, instead of 1958, as the endpoint, then the trend would have indicated an optimal working year of 1400 hours and around 11 million potential jobs foregone. Also, Sydney Chapman&#8217;s theory of the hours of labor shows that hours determined in a hypothetical competitive market tend to be longer than optimal with regard to output. So even the pre-1940 trend may overstate the length of working time that would be optimal. The assumption that the given hours of work in 1909 and 1958 were optimal is, in effect, unrealistic. But to produce any estimate at all it is necessary to make such an unrealistic assumption. In the period since World War II, a significant payroll tax and regulatory bias against reducing the standard full-time hours of work has emerged, more or less &#8220;freezing&#8221; weekly hours at the forty-hour standard established in 1938 by the Fair Labor Standards Act.</p>
<p>Remember, these are not work-shared jobs, created by redistributing a given number of hours of work. They are productive jobs associated with an expanded output. Whether or not that additional economic growth would be a good thing is another matter I will examine in due course. For the present, however, what I want to call attention to is the seeming indifference of conventional economists to a rather considerable untapped potential source of job creation.</p>
<p>*An explanation of how maintaining excessively long hours over the long run actually detracts from total output can be found in Sydney Chapman&#8217;s 1909 Economic Journal article, &#8220;Hours of Labour.&#8221; Initially, an extra hour of working time (beyond the hypothetical long run optimum) adds an increment of output to the daily total, but over time, say a few months, the accumulated fatigue leads to a diminished pace throughout the day and a lower total daily output. The optimum is thus determined by the amount of time and effort can be sustained over the long run.</p>
<p>To estimate how much output is subtracted by excessive hours, we use an idealized, smoothed work curve that assumes a rise in hourly productivity through the early hours of the day followed by a plateau and decline of productivity as fatigue sets in. These changes can be represented by a sine curve, which is convenient for calculation of the area under each segment of the curve, representing the variation in hourly productivity. For example, the diagram below represents work curves for 1909 and 1958. As indicated, the output per worker in 1958 was a bit more than twice the output per worker in 1909. That greater total output, however, occurred in a much-reduced number of hours of work: 2704 hours in 1909 and 2060 hours in 1958. If we assume that annual hours in both 1909 and 1958 were optimal, given the respective levels of technology, then increasing annual hours in 1958 to the 1909 level would have reduced total output in 1958 by around 22%.</p>

<p>I have emphasized short-run job creation quite a bit recently, and I have noted, implicitly at least, that we shouldn&#8217;t be too picky about the quality of the jobs that are created. Most jobs will do.</p>
<p>But in the long-run the quality of jobs matters a lot, and when the private sector finally begins reabsorbing the unemployed, the underemployed, and the discouraged, we want people to be able to find jobs with decent wages and benefits &#8212; jobs that are as good or better than the jobs they had before. </p>
<p>But where, exactly, will those jobs come from? I wish I had the answer.</p>
<p>Education is part of it, better education means better jobs on average, and it&#8217;s easy to imagine a substantial fraction of the population benefiting from an educational advantage. So I won&#8217;t back off prior calls to improve education at all levels.</p>
<p>But even if we substantially improve education, it won&#8217;t fully solve the problem. There will still be a need for quality jobs that are not all that dependent upon knowledge based skills. However, it&#8217;s harder to imagine an emerging set of industries that will provide the large number of quality jobs that we need to replace those lost from industries in decline.</p>
<p>If these jobs fail to be created in the next years and decades, the result will be an ever widening gap in the distribution of income with, as now, a group at the top doing relatively well, and everyone else treading water at best. </p>
<p>Is it overly pessimistic to worry that we may be headed in that direction?</p>

<p>Job Automation, Purchasing Power and Consumer Spending</p>
<p>I’ve had several <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/11/could-advancing-job-automation.html" target="_blank">recent posts</a> here arguing that automation technology is likely to depress wages and lead to significant structural unemployment in the coming years. One of the most common criticisms of my argument is that I am “not thinking like an economist” and that I’m viewing things in terms of dollars, rather than in terms of purchasing power. </p>
<p>Here’s part of a comment that James D. Miller, an economics professor at Smith College, made on my <a href="http://econfuture.wordpress.com/2009/11/25/comparative-advantage-v-machines" target="_blank">econfuture blog:</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Non-economists (even when they are very smart and well-studied) get in trouble when they consider trade issues in terms of dollars (“everyone could work for a dollar an hour?”) It’s better to think of wages in terms of what you could buy. In a world with hyper-productive robots you could buy lots of stuff if you could work at a task for say 1,000 hours that saved a robot 10 seconds of time.</p></blockquote>
<p>So the basic idea here is that although automation may result in very low wages in dollar terms (as well as high unemployment, since we do still have a minimum wage), things won’t be so bad because the efficiency of production will increase dramatically and everything will be really cheap. </p>
<p>To see the problem with this, <a href="http://www.visualeconomics.com/how-the-average-us-consumer-spends-their-paycheck" target="_blank">view this graph at Visual Economics</a> showing how consumers spend their incomes. The graph makes it immediately clear that consumers spend the lion’s share on their incomes on things like housing, insurance, health care, transportation and food.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />“Hyper-productive robots” are not going to lower anyone’s mortgage principle, and interest rates surely cannot go much lower. Nor can rents adjust too far downward without threatening the landlord’s mortgage. The same is true of insurance. The reality is that the most of the average consumer’s budget is based primarily on asset (and debt) values—and not directly on how efficient the economy is at producing goods and services. Food and energy prices are likewise unlikely to adjust downward. Expenditure categories that might see falling prices as automation progresses, such as apparel, entertainment and miscellaneous represent a tiny fraction of the average budget, and in many cases prices have already been minimized by globalization.</p>
<p>The only way to have expenditures fall in line with wages so that consumers could maintain their standard of living would be to have asset and debt values collapse. And that, of course, would be catastrophic for the financial system. Asset values in the United States reflect the basic assumption that we are going to continue to have a vibrant mass-market economy and a first-world living standard. You cannot have third-world wages with first-world asset values. That is the reason that countries like Thailand prohibit foreigners from buying property and driving values beyond the reach of their population. </p>
<p>As wages fall and unemployment rises, the average consumer is going to be squeezed by the fixed costs that cannot adjust downward. Mortgage defaults would soar and discretionary consumer spending is likely to plummet.</p>
<p>A <a href="http://www.usnews.com/money/blogs/flowchart/2009/12/03/why-rich-consumers-matter-more.html" target="_blank">recent article in U.S. News</a> noted that spending is already heavily concentrated among high income consumers:</p>
<blockquote><p>The top 10 percent of earners account for 22 percent of all spending, for instance, according to Moody&#8217;s Economy.com. The top 25 percent of all earners account for 45 percent of spending. The bottom 50 percent of earners, by contrast, spend just 29 percent of all the money in the consumer economy.</p></blockquote>
<p>As job automation (and globalization) drives down wages and creates structural unemployment, these numbers will become even more concentrated. At what point does this become unsustainable? In an environment with extreme financial stress due to loan defaults and falling asset values, can the wealthy few really drive consumer spending indefinitely? Recent history shows very clearly that when fear is pervasive, rich people stop buying as well. So where will consumer spending come from? </p>

<p>For the sake of argument, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/feature/2009/11/02/healthcare_employment/index.html">jobs in our future</a> over the next few years or so appear to be in the health care industry and education.  Jobs needing less education than a BA are among the fastest growing. <br />
<blockquote>Where are tomorrow&#8217;s jobs going to come from? The question is more urgent than ever, with official unemployment hovering around 10 percent and with nearly one in five Americans unemployed, if you count part-time workers who want full-time jobs and people so desperate that they have given up looking for work entirely.</p>
<p>Most popular discussion about jobs focuses on the effects of offshoring of manufacturing jobs to China and other countries, many of which, like China, manipulate exchange rates and use subsidies to promote their industries. Combating predatory trade practices and rebalancing global trade by means of higher U.S. exports is important, in the short and medium term. But in the long run technologically driven productivity growth is the most important factor in shaping employment in the U.S. and every country in the world.</p></blockquote>
<p>Productivity and innovation are the catch words, and examples demonstrate how this has worked in the last century. But if policy makers need to craft a response to mitigate the changes, and re-training happens, what is it going to be?  <br />
<blockquote>The emptying of the cubicles won&#8217;t result in permanent mass unemployment, the present prolonged crisis notwithstanding. As it has always done in the past, labor will shift from more mechanized to less mechanized sectors. But what will those jobs be?</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>The aging of the boomers accounts for only 10 percent of the growth. The rest comes from increasing demand. That&#8217;s because productivity growth in agriculture, construction and manufacturing has greatly reduced the cost of food, shelter and appliances. In the U.S. and similar nations, the freed-up income tends to be used on quality-of-life goods, of which healthcare is the most important.</p>
<p>&#8230;the economist Robert Fogel, &#8220;Just as electricity and manufacturing were the industries that stimulated the growth of the rest of the economy at the beginning of the 20th century, healthcare is the growth industry of the 21st century. It is a leading sector, which means that expenditures on healthcare will pull forward a wide array of other industries, including manufacturing, education, financial services, communications and construction.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>Another widespread myth holds that most Americans need to go to college in the future. In reality, most of the fastest-growing jobs, including those in healthcare, do not require a four-year bachelor&#8217;s degree. According to the Council of Economic Advisers: &#8220;The categories with some education required beyond high school are growing faster than those not requiring post-secondary schooling.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>None of this means that we don&#8217;t need world-class scientists and engineers, or that we don&#8217;t need to rebuild our manufacturing export industries, or that we don&#8217;t need to hire people to design and build up-to-date infrastructure and energy systems. High-tech agriculture, manufacturing and infrastructure and related business and professional services will remain essential to economic dynamism. But thanks to ever smarter machines, fewer and fewer people will work in the primary (field), secondary (factory) and tertiary (office) sectors. Most of the job growth will be in the &#8220;quaternary&#8221; sector of healthcare and other qualify-of-life services.</p></blockquote>

<p>The BLS establishment survey (<a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t14.htm">nonfarm payroll</a>) reports that the accumulated job loss since December 2007 is 5.02% (almost 7 million jobs), blowing the total job loss of the previous &#8220;biggie&#8221; recessions, the 73-75 and 81-82 recessions, out of the water by 2.5% and 2%, respectively. There&#8217;s no question that it has been bad, with almost every industry slashing payroll.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/SqQOUg10LWI/AAAAAAAACfo/m-AySv6LmtU/s1600-h/accumulated_jobloss_chart.png"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/SqQOUg10LWI/AAAAAAAACfo/m-AySv6LmtU/s320/accumulated_jobloss_chart.png" alt="" border="0"></a>The chart illustrates the total accumulated job loss across the major industries spanning December 2007 to August 2009 (nonfarm payroll listed <a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t14.htm">here</a>). Assuming that the recession is over (the consensus and key indicators seem to indicate that a <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601068&#038;sid=aUPIThl8CVVQ">business cycle trough has been found</a>), then there are just two men left standing (adding jobs over the cycle), education and health services and government (barely). Even the historical job anchors , other services, professional and business services, and financial activities, are down between 1.8 and 8%! The job loss is broad and deep.</p>
<p>However, the industry contributions to total job loss show that the job destruction is heavily weighted in manufacturing and construction, which account for roughly half of the total drop in nonfarm payroll (-2.5% of the total -5%). But manufacturing and construction hold just a 16% share of the entire payroll.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/SqQGd9Hn_yI/AAAAAAAACfg/H7uvrxz7tf4/s1600-h/contributions_chart.png"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/SqQGd9Hn_yI/AAAAAAAACfg/H7uvrxz7tf4/s320/contributions_chart.png" alt="" border="0"></a>Productivity numbers, i.e., growing amid record output loss, would suggest (even <a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/prod2.nr0.htm">manufacturing productivity</a> saw growth in Q2 2009) that factories are running on skeleton crews, which is efficient given the drop in demand. And a resumption of aggregate demand may be partially satisfied by <a href="http://www.newsneconomics.com/2009/08/can-firms-simply-add-hours-to-recover.html">adding hours</a>, but that will only go so far. Firms will need to hire, and hire soon after demand starts to grow again.</p>

                                <p>What do you think of a job that use to pay $13/hr, three years latter paying that same person now $11/hour? What do you think of that same job having other people being paid $9.56/hr.</p>
<p>It is a union hospital job cleaning rooms after the patient goes home. Cleaning as in washing walls, floor, beds, etc. It includes doing “trash and linen”; collecting the bags of linen and throwing them into a cage that gets piled high, throwing trash into a dumpster but, not on a regular bases. They have a young man for that. Just one man for the heavy work during the week. He&#8217;s on vacation. They have another male, but only on weekends (works 2 jobs, 49 yrs old). He&#8217;s had enough. He&#8217;s leaving.</p>
<p>They are not allowed to strike as they are considered essential to the operations. The company can not keep help, especially male help.</p>
<p>We hear about people having downsized their incomes when they have to make a change of job, but this is a downsizing within the same employment. How did this happen? The hospital outsourced the maintenance and then the company was sold&#8230;not to an outside the nation company.</p>
<p>My brother-in-law use to earn $80,000/yr. They cut his job. He ended up working for a company that filled a contract that a second company had for a third company who outsourced the department to the second company. He was paid $45,000/yr, was part of a team of 5 who replaced 15 people who were all making what he use to make.</p>
<p>Maybe it&#8217;s time we start understanding that “outsourcing” is not just a process of moving a job out of the country. It is also a shell game within the country.</p>
