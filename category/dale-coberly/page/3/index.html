<p>Social Security&#8230;Hearts and Minds</p>
<p>   Tom Margenau wrote an essay about the payroll tax holiday in The National Memo <a href="http://nationalmemo.com/content/your-tax-holiday-gift-lump-coal" target="_blank">Is Your Tax Holiday Gift A Lump of Coal?</a>  His essay seemed to me to illustrate one of the problems with the Social Security &#8220;debate&#8221; as it has been constructed.</p>
<p>Margenau  describes himself as &#8220;not very good with numbers,&#8221; but someone who has been accused of being &#8220;a bleeding heart liberal.&#8221;  &#8220;But,&#8221; he says, &#8220;this is one liberal who gives the Republicans credit&#8230; at least they are willing to talk about it.&#8221;   The trouble with all this is that Margenau does not understand the numbers, so he is giving the Republicans credit for being willing to talk about a problem that does not exist.</p>
<p>This is exactly what &#8220;liberals&#8221; have been doing:  searching, searching for a way to ease their bleeding hearts by solving the huge, terrible problem that only looks huge when you don&#8217;t understand the numbers.</p>
<p>Margenau cites the famous &#8220;in less than 20 years there will be only two workers supporting each retiree.&#8221; And he proposes &#8220;relatively modest changes&#8230; bumping up the retirement age..&#8221;</p>
<p>You may read his full essay at the place cited.  Easiest for me to simply reprint here the reply I sent to him. <br /><a name="more"></a><br />
<blockquote>&#8220;Tom,  Your heart is in the right place, but you miss the critical point.  Social Security is not welfare.  It is critically important that it   is not welfare.  FDR understood this so he made it &#8220;worker paid&#8221;   insurance, &#8220;so no damn pollitician can take it away from them.&#8221;  Social Security was never in trouble. </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p> All that 3 to 1 and 2 to 1   worker to retiree ratio is lying nonsense meant to impose on people   whose math skills are not very good.  What it amounts to is that if people are going to live longer&#8230;  say   20 years after working 40 years, instead of 13 years after   working 40 years, they will need to save about one third more each   month for their own retirement.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p> This means raising the payroll tax   from 6% to about 8%.  And since the change in life expectancy is not   going to happen all at once, it means we can raise the payroll tax   one half of one tenth of one percent each year. </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p> This is an increase of 40 cents per week for the average worker   today.  And while the increase gets bigger over time, so do wages. So   the increase will never be felt as more of a burden than that 40   cents per week.  AND the workers will get the money back, with   interest, so they can look forward to a longer retirement with better   benefits than today&#8217;s retirees. </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p> The Republicans were not being more responsible&#8230; they were telling   a Big Lie.  They could get away with it because the average person is   innumerate, and the average liberal no longer understands the   important difference between Social Security and welfare.  It is probably too late, but it would help if the people who think SS   is important at least understood the facts and the basic principle.</p></blockquote>
<p>Margenau replied to me that &#8220;the worker to beneficiary ratio is not lying nonsense.  It is critically important.&#8221;  And indeed it is.  It is fundamental.  But it doesn&#8217;t mean what he thinks it means.  All it means is that if we are going to live longer we are going to have to save more for our retirement. The &#8220;more&#8221; is not burdensome.</p>
<p>But working an extra year could be hell for many people.   Meanwhile, Our President, and his Friends Across the Aisle have killed Social Security.  They did it by the breathtakingly bold and easy step of just taking away its funding by calling for a &#8220;payroll tax holiday.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Democrats &#8230;Democrats!&#8230; are now running on the issue of making the payroll tax holiday permanent &#8220;to avoid a huge tax increase on the middle class.&#8221;  The lying is sickening.  But the people will go for it.  And the Republicans will cry,  &#8220;Oh no, not the briar patch!  Don&#8217;t throw me in dat briar patch Br&#8217;er Obama.&#8221;</p>
<p>And laugh up their sleeves while the &#8220;progressives&#8221; think they have scored a huge win for the poor.   And the poor will never understand what happened until they go to retire and learn they&#8217;ve had another year added on to their sentence, or have to go to the welfare office to prove they need &#8220;benefits,&#8221;  and they better bring a note from their doctor saying they only have one more year to live.</p>
<p>The only way out of this would be a sudden demand by a hundred million working people to &#8220;raise our taxes!  give us back our Social Security!&#8221;</p>

<p>SOCIAL SECURITY AIN&#8217;T BROKE</p>
<p>A Reply to Linda Beale</p>
<p>I want to take advantage of Linda Beale&#8217;s essay &#8220;Social Security: It Ain&#8217;t Broke Unless China is too&#8221; to make some points of my own.  I want to be clear at the outset that I am grateful to Linda for her essay.  She is essentially right.  My comments are secondary.  It&#8217;s not a case of my disagreeing with Linda, but of having something to say that I hope will help people understand the Social Security &#8220;question&#8221; a little better.  </p>
<p>I am going to assume the reader has Linda&#8217;s essay in front of him.</p>
<p>First, I don&#8217;t agree with Krugman: you CANNOT think of Social Security as &#8220;part of the budget.&#8221;  I don&#8217;t know how the government talks to itself about this,  but they sure went to a lot of effort to segregate Social Security funds from the budget with a payroll tax and a Trust Fund. . You don&#8217;t have a &#8220;trust fund&#8221; if the money is fungible.</p>
<p>We once had a reader at Angry Bear point to a CBO &#8220;paper&#8221; that said because SS funds come into the Treasury like other taxes, they cannot be regarded as separate from those other taxes. The money is not &#8220;marked&#8221; so you can tell SS money from other money.  This is a lie.  The government is quite capable of keeping track of where the money comes from and where it is dedicated by law to go.  So be warned, there are experts, even in the heart of CBO who are quite willing to lie to you if they think they can get away with it.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />Second,  i don&#8217;t like the usage  &#8220;workers pay&#8230; to support [past workers, current retirees] who paid into it in the past.&#8221;   While this is technically true,  it is misleading.  Those current retirees DID pay into SS in the past.  They paid for their own benefits.  Pay as you go is merely the very clever way the first cohort&#8217;s payments are protected from inflation, and earn interest, without being exposed to the risks of the market, so they can be returned to the taxpayer in time to help pay for his retirement.  It is critical that people understand that the workers pay for their own benefits.  It is NOT &#8220;the young paying for the old.&#8221;   When they figure your benefits, they look at what YOU paid in, not what your son is paying in.</p>
<p>Like a lot of things in life, both ideas are true here.  We are paying for the older generation, just as the next generation will pay for us. But at the same time we are paying directly for ourself.  The money we pay is recorded against our name.  Just like in a bank account.</p>
<p>Third , you&#8217;ll get some disagreement  about when the Trust Fund was created and what for.  Beale is essentially right about the present Trust Fund being created to allow the boomers to pay in advance for the part of their own retirement benefits that would be needed in excess of normal pay as you go. The trust fund was there at the beginning as a simple way to buffer income against outgo, both for normal monthly ebbs and flows, and for the occasional recession when taxes collected would fall short of benefits &#8220;promised.&#8221;  But the &#8217;83 Social Security Commission knew the boomer retirement was coming, and the tax rate they set at that time &#8220;just happened&#8221; to result in a Trust Fund large enough to bridge the boomer retirement. This is the point we have reached today.  A long expected point, in spite of the liars screaming that SS has gone &#8220;cash flow negative.&#8221;  SS has not gone &#8220;negative.&#8221;  It&#8217;s cash flow includes interest, and eventually principle, from the savings it generated exactly for this purpose.</p>
<p>Fourth, I don&#8217;t agree with Beale that there is NO &#8220;problem.&#8221;  The Trust Fund is not the problem.  The problem is that as people live longer, they will need to devote a higher percent of their earnings to their retirement.. OR not retire as young, OR live on less when they do.  I don&#8217;t think any sane person would choose options 2 and 3 when option 1 is so cheap.  But it IS a &#8220;problem,&#8221;  a very small one once it is understood, which is why the bad guys work so very hard to prevent your understanding it.  You, the young, can insure your own future retirement  with no increase in retirement age or cut in monthly benefits simply by raising your own tax&#8230; really your own savings rate&#8230; one half of one tenth of one percent per year,  or about forty cents per week in today&#8217;s terms.  This is an enormously better solution than not letting people retire when they are old, or cutting their benefits below survival levels, or taxing the rich and turning Social Security into welfare as we knew it.</p>
<p>Fifth.. the Trust Fund treasuries will indeed run out some time around 2030 or 40 or 50.  It is a fatal argument to tell people don&#8217;t worry be happy.  Even &#8220;the young&#8221; can see that they will be taking a benefit cut when they retire if nothing is done.  Their problem is they don&#8217;t know they can avoid the benefit cut by raising their own &#8220;tax&#8221; by an amount so small they would not even notice it.  </p>
<p>Default or not Default is not the question.  Default would just move up the day when the tax needs to be raised, but would make no real difference in justice to anyone.  And the lying bastards won&#8217;t default in a way you could bring them to court for.  They will just cut benefits one way or another so the TF does not have to be paid back in a time inconvenient to themselves.  They CAN do that.  And that is the extent to which Uncle Sam borrowing from himself IS a problem.  But it is not the problem that the liars say it is.  Uncle Sam will have no problem finding the money. In fact, i don&#8217;t think the liars really care about the money. What they really want to do is destroy Social Security. They hate it because they hate the idea of &#8220;the help&#8221; being idle.  They can&#8217;t imagine you might think you have something more important to do with your golden years than work for them.</p>
<p>Sixth..  The liars claim that the iou&#8217;s are meaningless is based on their idea that the government has to tax the people to find the money to pay the people.  This is a confusion &#8230; we are not all the same person&#8230;  but it is one they probably sincerely believe, and it isn&#8217;t helpful (to them) for us to miss the point. It needs to be explained. The money is owed to the people who paid their payroll tax on the understanding that it would be used to pay for their retirement.  It will be paid by people who did not pay that payroll tax, and who presumably benefitted by borrowing the money.  They will not be paying twice for their Social Security.  They will be paying for the first time for what their government bought with the money they borrowed FROM Social Security.  The rich know that it is THEY who will be taxed to pay back the money they borrowed from Social Security.  And they are just short sighted enough to stop thinking right there, especially as they can rationalize that the money was borrowed not by them but by &#8220;the government&#8221;  whoever that is. But since they hate the government, they can pretend they have no obligation to pay it&#8217;s bills just by pretending they got no benefit from spending the money.</p>
<p>Again, I want to think Linda for her essay, and I hope this helps.</p>

<p><strong>WHAT KOTLIKOFF (REALLY) SAID</strong></p>
<p>Larry Kotlikoff responded to my post in comments (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/10/social-security-its-just-math.html#comments">Social Security: It’s Just Math</a>). by saying that I (coberly) “wrote quite a lot about something I [Kotlikoff] didn&#8217;t really say.”  He has a point.  I based my speculations about where he obtained his misleading numbers on an <a target="_blank" href="http://www.npr.org/2011/08/06/139027615/a-national-debt-of-14-trillion-try-211-trillion">NPR summary</a> of their interview  with him. Kotlikoff says my speculations were wrong.  He actually got his misleading numbers by including “Medicare plus Medicaid plus Social Security expenditures per adult.” </p>
<p>I still don’t know exactly how he derived his numbers, but I remain quite certain that talking about SocialSecurityMedicareandMedicaid  in one mouthful is grossly misleading.  Social Security has nothing to do with any deficits as it is paid for by the people who will get the benefits. IF those people are going to want higher benefits in the future to keep up with their longer life expectancy and higher standard of living, they would have to raise their own payroll tax about one half of one tenth of one percent, about 40 cents per week in today’s terms, each year while their incomes are projected to be rising over one full percent per year, or eight dollars per week per year in today’s terms.  These numbers are derived directly from the SSA Trustees Report, and CBO options numbers two and three.</p>
<p>Medicare and Medicaid, by contrast, depend on the cost of medical care.  Costs which we are going to have to pay, if we want the medical care, even if we cut Medicare and Medicaid to zero.  We would just end up paying through private insurance, which would tend to mean that the old and poor would not get medical care&#8230; not because “we” were not paying for “their” care, but because we were not allowed to pay in advance for our own care using a system that protects our money from loss due to inflation, including “medical inflation.” </p>
<p>Medicare  is NOT the young paying for the old.  It is the young paying for their own expected costs in old age while they are young and healthy and are making money. <a name="more"></a> As for Medicaid,  costs depend on both the costs of medical care and the number of people in poverty in this country.  Kotlikoff appears to be suggesting that “the young” could save themselves a lot of money if they just didn’t worry about their own needs when they get old, and didn’t think there was any reason to care for the poor and sick. Neither compassion nor an enlightened self interest would be allowed to suggest to the young that they might become old or sick or poor themselves, or that they would ever profit from living in a nation in which the poor and the sick can expect to be helped to return to being strong and good employees, good customers, or even good soldiers.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=139027615">Here is a transcript</a> of what Kotlikoff really said on NPR.  I offer a few  comments interlinear.<br />
<blockquote>August 6, 2011 &#8211; </p>
<p>DAVID GREENE, host: Now, S&#038;P says this downgrade might not even be the last one if the nation&#8217;s debt keeps ballooning. So how to turn this around? Listen to the prescription from Boston University economist Laurence Kotlikoff.  </p>
<p>LAURENCE KOTLIKOFF: What you have to do is either immediately and permanently raise taxes by about two-thirds, or immediately and permanently cut every dollar of spending by 40 percent forever. So I&#8217;m talking about cutting Medicare benefits, Medicaid, Social Security, defense spending, you name it, by 40 percent forever, starting today. That&#8217;s what the CBO&#8217;s numbers say we have an absolutely enormous problem facing us. </p></blockquote>
<p>Again, Kotlikoff prefers the big hammer approach. We are not allowed any subtlety in deciding what programs to cut, or what taxes to raise.  If taxes are currently about 18% of GDP a two thirds raise would raise them to 30%.  This looks a bit scary,  but if we look hard at what we are getting for the money, and what we can get with the money we have left after paying taxes, we COULD decide that it is just the price we have to pay to provide the infrastructure that protects our ability to make money in the first place.   I don’t know if we would feel safe in a country with a 40% smaller defense budget.  And I am sure that not allowing the people to pay more than 60% of what it would cost them to provide an adequate retirement would not be really  smart financial planning.</p>
<blockquote><p>GREENE: Big tax increases, huge cuts to military spending and entitlement programs &#8211; good luck getting that through Congress &#8211; and the problem Kotlikoff says is a whole lot bigger than this $14 debt we&#8217;ve been talking about.  <br />KOTLIKOFF: If you add up all the promises that have been made for spending obligations, including defense expenditures, and you subtract off all the taxes that we expect to collect, the difference is 211 trillion. That&#8217;s the fiscal gap. That&#8217;s our true indebtedness.  <br />GREENE: It&#8217;s a big number. Why aren&#8217;t we hearing more about that as these big debates and all the drama go on in Washington? </p></blockquote>
<p>It is indeed a big number. Kotlikoff needs to explain where he got it from. Then we can look at it and see if it makes any sense.</p>
<blockquote><p>KOTLIKOFF: Well, the politicians have chosen their language carefully to keep most of the problem off the books, and they&#8217;ve done this for decades. So this is Enron accounting to the 10th power, I mean, millionth power, actually</p></blockquote>
<p>.  I see.  It’s a secret.  Been going on for decades. And we never knew.  I don’t know if Kotlikoff has any idea what the “millionth power” means, but given his other numbers, I think he just likes the scary sound of it.</p>
<blockquote><p>GREENE: Quite a strong accusation.  <br />KOTLIKOFF: Well, it&#8217;s, you know, it&#8217;s true. Why are these guys thinking about balancing the budget? They should try and think about our long-term fiscal problems. We&#8217;ve got 78 million baby boomers who are poised to collect, in about 15 to 20 years, about $40,000 per person. Multiply 78 million by 40,000, you&#8217;re talking about more than $3 trillion a year in today&#8217;s dollars just to give to a portion of the population. That&#8217;s an enormous bill that&#8217;s overhanging our heads, and Congress isn&#8217;t focused on it.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is the quote I addressed in my earlier post.  Kotlikoff needs to explain in detail where he gets his numbers. </p>
<p>But more than that we need to understand that Social Security  is not something “we” “give” to “a portion of the population.”  Social Security is “us” paying for our own costs in advance of the time we will BE that “portion of the population.  This is also true about Medicare, though it’s not so obvious in the way Medicare is financed. </p>
<p>As for Medicaid, well,  as long as “we” know that we will never be in that “portion of the population”  or derive any benefit from anybody who is,or was, then I guess there is no reason on earth why “we” should set a “portion” of our money aside to take care of those problems.  But if we know it is OUR money for our own potential needs, it would be sensible to look at ways to control costs.  Kotlikoff appears to think the best way to control the future cost of living is to cut off our own heads now.</p>
<blockquote><p>GREENE: So Americans just watch this drama play out in Washington. I mean, is your message to them that this was all just a useless process?  <br />KOTLIKOFF: This is a sideshow. The Democrats and Republicans have been having a food fight for decades. Underneath that facade of conflict, what&#8217;s really going on is that older generations are taking from young generations on a ongoing basis. And we&#8217;ve consistently done too little, too late, looked too short-term. Well, guess what? You can&#8217;t keep putting off these problems. And we&#8217;ve used language to disguise what&#8217;s really going on here, which is this mess of Ponzi scheme. </p></blockquote>
<p>I would be the last to claim that the Congress is more than a sideshow.  But I hope I have made clear to you why it is national suicide to divide ourselves into “the younger” versus “the older” generations.  We will all become “older” in time.  Meanwhile, even if enlightened self interest does not teach us to pay in advance for at least enough of our old age to meed basic needs, in a program that can guarantee our money will not disappear due to inflation or a bad day on the stock market, we might at least remember that the older generation had something to do with feeding and clothing and housing and educating us, and defending the country and building the infrastructure that makes it possible for us to make more money, with less work, than the now old could when they were young.  Teaching us to think of our elders as “the enemy” is teaching us a kind of mental disease that will return us to the law of the jungle and a life that is “solitary, poor, nasty, brutal, and short.  It is the devil’s agenda.</p>
<blockquote><p>GREENE: We&#8217;ve been speaking to Laurence Kotlikoff, professor of economics at Boston University. He joined us from member station WBUR in Boston. Thank you so much, professor.  <br />KOTLIKOFF: My pleasure.</p></blockquote>

<p>SOCIAL SECURITY:</p>
<p>IT’S JUST MATH</p>
<p>or how to lie with numbers</p>
<p>&#8220;Math doesn&#8217;t lie&#8221; seems to be the new focus group tested mantra  about Social Security that Congressmen and their journalists are so proud to repeat.  What it really means is &#8220;we put a lot of money into finding ways to make the numbers sound big enough to scare the children.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here is a recent example, which I found in  <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/intelligence_squared/2011/09/stop_obsessing_over_entitlement_reform.single.html">http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/intelligence_squared/2011/09/stop_obsessing_over_entitlement_reform.single.html</a></p>
<p>&#8220;Slate:Of course, old people today are no longer poor because of Social Security. But recently, GOP presidential contender and Texas Gov. Rick Perry called it a &#8220;Ponzi scheme.&#8221; And last month, the economist Laurence Kotlikoff said this in an interview with NPR: &#8220;We&#8217;ve got 78 million baby boomers who are poised to collect, in about 15 to 20 years, about $40,000 per person. Multiply 78 million by $40,000–you&#8217;re talking about more than $3 trillion a year just to give to a portion of the population. That&#8217;s an enormous bill overhanging our heads, and Congress isn&#8217;t focused on it.&#8221; But you&#8217;ve written that Social Security will be only a small contributor to the future budget gap. Are Kotlikoff&#8217;s worries unfounded?</p>

<p>A look at the 2011 Trustees Report Table IV.B2  shows that, sure enough, in 2025 there will be about 78 million beneficiaries to OASDI.    To find the &#8220;$40,000 per person&#8221; is not so easy.  Look at Table VI.F7, Cost of OASDI (“Social Security”) in 2025 will be $1213 Billion, not 3 Trillion, for a per person cost of about $15,551 in “constant 2011 dollars” , not  $40,000.  Hmmm, maybe he means “current dollars, that is inflated dollars.  Well, table VI.F8 gives  $1626 Billion for 2025, still not $ 3 Trillion, or $40,000 per person.  </p>
<p>Wait, maybe he is talking about Social Security PLUS Medicare (HI).  Getting closer. Table VI.F9 gives the combined cost for OASDI AND HI, in current (inflated) dollars as $ 2237 Billion.  Not 3 Trillion. Not $40,000 per person.</p>
<p>So where does Kotlikoff get his scary numbers?  Perhaps from the (Table VI.F9) “High Cost” estimate for 2025, in current dollars,for Social Security plus Medicare, of $ 2737 Billion. Close enough, if you don’t mind rounding up by 10%.</p>
<p>It is not honest to start out by talking about Social Security, then skip to talking about (mumble) “socialsecurityplusmedicare” without bothering to mention that you have done so, or pointing out that Medicare is a very different kind of problem than Social Security. And it is not honest to use a “high cost” estimate which even the Trustees regard as “unlikely,” without even mentioning that that’s what you are doing.  Nor is it honest to talk about inflated dollars without telling people that’s what you are doing and giving them a basis for understanding what the numbers mean in terms of the money they have in their wallet today.</p>
<p>Table VI.F4 gives GDP in current dollars for 2025 as $ 30 Trillion dollars. And the combined “high cost estimate” for the combined costs of Social Security and Medicare as 8.96% of that.  Table VI.F4 gives the intermediate (most likely) estimate of the combined cost of Social Security and Medicare to be 7.66% of GDP. </p>
<p>But even staying with Kotlikoff’s misleading estimate, a “high cost” estimate of feeding and housing, and basic medical care, for 78 million people, over a quarter of the adult population, may reach 10% of GDP.</p>
<p>Kotlikoff is pretty sure this is an “enormous bill overhanging our heads”&#8230;.”just to give to a portion of the population.”</p>
<p>But “we” are not giving it to them.  They will have paid for it.  </p>
<p>And every one of us will one day be in that “portion of the population.”  Kotlikoff appears to be suggesting we just ask old people to step out into the blizzard, so “we” don’t have to pay for “them.” </p>
<p>But “we” will be paying for ourselves&#8230;  just in case, you know, we don’t want to go into the blizzard. “We” are “them.”</p>
<p>With pay as you go financing “we” pay for our future benefits over a forty year period, an average of 30 years before we will need to collect. This is no different than “saving” the money.  Because of inflation people cannot afford to just put the money under the mattress.  Before Social Security they would take it to a bank and hope the bank would pay it back, with enough interest to stay ahead of inflation.  Or they would “invest” their money in hopes of getting back more than they paid in by taking advantage of the growth in the economy.  The  success of this would depend upon picking the right investment on the right day.</p>
<p>Social Security avoids both the risk of inflation, and the risks of investments that go bad at the worst possible time.  By using your money to pay back the people who paid for their Social Security before you, they are able to pay those people with money that is worth more than the money the older people paid in.  This is very simple:  Those older people paid a tax on an income that was a lot smaller than yours.  You pay the same tax on a larger income. This makes more money available to pay the benefits due to the older people.</p>
<p>This is effectively the same as “interest”, and because it comes from the growth of the whole economy it is not subject to the same risk as individual investments.  And because it is paid in “current” dollars, it always keeps up with inflation.</p>
<p>And when it’s your turn to retire, you will get the same advantage the older generation got.  And when your children retire, they will get the same advantage you got.  And so on, forever.</p>
<p>But please note, it is YOU paying for your own retirement.  It is NOT you paying for granny.  She already paid for her own retirement.  </p>
<p>Don’t be confused by the pay as you go feature.  It is really not different from what happens when you put your money in the bank or buy stocks and bonds.</p>
<p>Your money goes, the same day you deposited it, right out the door to pay for the current uses of some other person.  And when you are ready to cash out your savings, or stocks and bonds, the money would come in the door, that very day, from some other person, presumably someone looking for a safe place to save for his retirement.</p>
<p>To get a more honest picture than the one Kotlikoff is trying to scare you with,  look at Table VI.F7,  and see that the intermediate (best guess) cost of OASDI in 2025 is projected to be $ 1212.8 Billion in &#8220;constant 2011 dollars&#8221;&#8230; dollars worth as much as the dollars in your wallet today.   Divide $1212.8 Billion by 78 million and you get $15,549 per beneficiary.  </p>
<p>Table VI.F2 says this is 15.67% of “taxable income.  The same line gives the SS income rate  as 13.15%.  This is the amount of money available to pay the benefits. It comes from the current payroll tax rate of 12.4%  and additional income&#8230; mostly a part of the income tax that IRS collected on income from benefits and kicks back to SS. This means a tax increase of about 2.5% (15.7 &#8211; 13.2) would be needed to close the gap.  </p>
<p>The best way to increase the tax this much by the year 2025 would be to raise the payroll tax about one tenth of one percent per year for each the boss and the worker.</p>
<p>But it turns out the need for the raise has long been anticipated and the workers have been “saving up for it” by paying a tax rate higher than needed for the usual pay as you go.  This gives SS a savings account (the Trust Fund) to draw on to ease the transition to the higher tax rate. The Trust Fund will still have about  2.6 Trillion dollars in it by 2025, helping to pay the increased costs (Table VI.F7).  </p>
<p>We could just let the Trust Fund make up the difference between the tax rate and the cost rate, but this would not be prudent.  It turns out that a gradual increase in the tax rate of ONE FOURTH  of one tenth of one percent per year for each the boss and the worker will keep Social Security “solvent” forever. This is about 20 cents per week per year for each. </p>
<p>Actually no increase at all would be needed to  keep Social Security “solvent.”  The increase suggested here is what it would take to maintain the current “replacement rate”.. that is the percent of your pre-retirement earnings that you collect from Social Security on a monthly basis, AND retire at the same age as current retirees.   It’s pretty certain you would want to do both of those things, and as we have seen, the cost is not even high enough to notice.</p>
<p>While your tax is going up one quarter of one tenth of one percent per year, your income is projected to go up over one full percent per year.  That means, essentially, that each year your tax is twenty cents more per week (forty cents if you are your own boss) and your income is 8 dollars per week more than it was last year.  Leaving you with MORE money every week than you had before, PLUS having paid for a longer, richer, secure retirement.</p>
<p>So Kotlikoff’s 3 Trillion dollar “enormous bill hanging over our heads,” just to “give” to a “part” of the population (you) turns out to be a need to raise your own tax&#8230; really your own savings&#8230; less than a tenth of a percent per year over the time between now and then.</p>
<p>Remember this is your own money.  Not “the government’s.”  It’s not welfare.  You pay for your own retirement.  There is no deficit or debt.  Just a need to pay for what YOU will need. And it won’t cost enough to even notice.</p>
<p>It’s just math.</p>
<p>[note&#8230;</p>
<p>The numbers I give above are for OASDI, Social Security proper, not Medicare, because Medicare’s problems are best addressed by controlling medical costs (not by cutting benefits).</p>
<p>But even if costs can’t be controlled,  we may decide we want to pay for the medical care anyway.  The cost of this would be about a fourth of the cost of Social Security.  So the same logic applies. Instead of raising your tax 40 cents per week each year, you might have to raise it 50 cents per week each year.  You are still going to have more money after paying the tax than you have today.  And you will still be paying, in advance, for your own needs&#8230;  not some other “portion of the population.”]</p>

<p><strong>ARITHMETIC MATTERS</strong></p>
<p>I was thinking that someone could fault my essay the other day about the “Intelligence Squared” debate.  I said that Howard Dean’s side did not really help anyone understand why, or what, or how to “save the program.”  I hope I helped explain the why and what, but I probably wasn’t any more clear than Dean about  how.</p>
<p>This will attempt to address that. Recall the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/312411#ixzz1a6qBaLMN%3Cbr%20/%3E">original article about the debate</a> </p>
<blockquote><p>Arithmetic still matters,&#8221; Zuckerman began. &#8220;Medicaid now pays for both health and long term care for roughly 55 million Americans. It finances more than one third of all births in the United States, and pays the cost of almost two thirds of the people in nursing homes. The federal government underwrites 50 to 77 percent of the cost, depending on the income level of each state. Even so, Medicaid is the second biggest and fastest growing category of state spending. Costs are up more than 60 percent in the last five years and are expected to exceed $450 billion this year and to keep growing by about eight percent annually for the next decade. In the next &#8212; by the mid-2030s, the 65 and over population will nearly double, and health care costs, which have been rising far faster than worker productivity since the end of World War II, may be completely out of control, resulting in a tidal wave of federal spending.</p></blockquote>
<p>Perhaps arithmetic still matters, but Zuckerman is careful to avoid giving us any.  Instead he seduces us down a path that begins with apparent sober numerical facts and ends with pure demagoguery.</p>
<p>You need to learn to beware of words like “costs are up more than 60%”&#8230; <br /><a name="more"></a><br />Sixty percent of what?  If Medicare costs went up 60%, they would go from 3% of payroll to about 5%.  This might be more than you want to pay.  It might even be more than it should be.  But it is not exactly an intolerable burden if that’s what it costs to live a longer and healthier life.</p>
<p>But, just as a matter of “arithmetic,” note how a 2% increase in costs becomes a scary “60% increase.”  This is typical of the “it’s just math” school of liars.</p>
<p>Similarly, the rest of Zuckerman’s seduction presents numbers intended to scare you into thinking that Medicaid costs are high and growing alarmingly.  It would be just as reasonable to think that health care costs are high and will get higher, and that government programs are the best way people have to pay for them. Or even that government needs to step in and find a way to control costs (which is not the same as cut benefits).</p>
<p>But finally we reach the payoff.: be afraid of costs “completely out of control”  and “a tidal wave of Federal spending.&#8221;</p>
<p>None of the “arithmetic” Zuckerman  gives us here actually supports that scary rhetoric.  His theorem amounts to:  “If costs are going up, we must cut our insurance.”</p>
<p>I don’t know how much costs are going to go up.  Neither does Zuckerman.  But I can suggest that you try to find out what costs are now in terms of your own personal budget, and what they are likely to be in terms of your personal budget at some reasonable time in the future.  And what the estimate is based on.  And whether it is a cost you are going to have to pay one way or another&#8230; either through taxes or private insurance or out of pocket. Don’t forget this is insurance.  You may be healthy today,  but with insurance you are paying a little bit now “just in case” you are faced with life or death huge costs&#8230;personal costs&#8230;in the future.</p>
<p>And what is the safest way to pay for them.  Private insurance cannot guarantee that it will be able to pay for your care, even after you have paid premiums for your entire life.  The government can.  </p>
<p>There is also some reason to suppose that the government might be in a better position to control prices than private insurance. But only  as long as we can remind the government that we are paying for our own insurance here, and not just some budget item they can cut  “to balance income”  with no consequences to the people who thought they were paying for insurance that would be there when they need it.</p>
<p>Pay as you go is the only way that I can think of to make this work.  Under  pay as you go the people just pay for current costs.  Their own future costs will be higher, so they are not bearing an unfair burden. Their own future costs will be paid for (directly) by the workers of that time&#8230; who will have higher wages and will be more able to afford it.  Those future workers own higher costs in turn will be paid for by the workers of that later time&#8230; who will have higher wages&#8230; and so on.</p>
<p>Perhaps the process can’t go on forever.  But it can go on a lot longer than retired people can afford to pay each month for the “insurance” that would pay for their current level of risk. The ultimate answer to high costs is to find a way to control them, and to decide how much of your current income you are willing to set aside for what level of health care you may want in the future. Please note there is no &#8220;looming deficit&#8221; here. We just pay the costs as they come up.  The magic of pay as you go will assure than none of us pay more than our own &#8220;expected&#8221; costs.  The fact that we are paying in advance of our own need does not mean that we are paying for &#8220;someone else&#8221; or that we are not paying for ourself.</p>
<p>I don’t know what the whole health care arithmetic will turn out to be when it is done by someone honest, but I can point at something which may be important to keep in mind:</p>
<p>Table VI.F2 of the 2011 Trustees Report tells us that the cost of Medicare (HI) in 2030 will be about 4.4% of taxable payroll, compared to about 3.8% today. This looks to me like about a half of one percent increase in your payroll tax, and half of that will be paid by your boss.  That is not a staggering burden. [It might be more reasonable to compare the future cost to the present tax rate.. 2.9%, half from the worker, half from the boss.  This would suggest a need to raise the tax 1.5% over the next 20 years.  That would be less than half of one tenth of one percent per year for each the boss and the employee&#8230;.still not a staggering burden.  And it goes to pay for your own eventual health care needs.]</p>
<p>Moreover, the real wage is expected to increase at least 1.2% per year between today and 2030.  This would result in a real wage that is about 25% higher in 2030 than it is today.</p>
<p>Lets say that today you are making 1000 dollars per week.  You are paying 1.45% for Medicare or about $14.50 per month. (your boss pays another $14.50, but if you want to say that is “really” your money, you need to add $14.50 to your income. )  This leaves you with about $986 a week after you have paid for your Medicare.</p>
<p>In 2030, your income would be 1,250 dollars per week (real).  And if there were no increase in the Medicare tax rate, your tax would be $18.12, leaving you with $1232 per week after you have paid for Medicare.</p>
<p>If the cost of Medicare goes up to 4.4% of taxable payroll and the tax rate is raised to meet the cost, your share goes up to 2.2%, and you would pay $27.50 per week for Medicare, leaving you with about $1222 after paying for your Medicare.</p>
<p>So even with the increased cost of Medicare, you would have 236 dollars in real money more than you have today AFTER paying for your Medicare.</p>
<p>There are, of course, other taxes,  but the arithmetic is the same.  After calculating the increased costs, and your expected increase in wages, you are going to be richer in the future, not staggering under a load of “debt”.</p>
<p>All you have to do is pay for what YOU ARE GOING TO NEED.  You are not “paying for granny.”  Granny already paid for herself.  </p>
<p>Note that even if costs for health care go up faster than your wages &#8230; in real terms&#8230;  you are still paying for something you may want more than a new car when you get sick.</p>
<p>I suggest this is the real arithmetic you need to keep in mind.</p>
