                                <div>Laurence Kotlikoff has a post in <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-07-11/social-security-hole-overwhelms-taxes-cuts.html" target="_blank">Bloomberg opinion section</a> on the current status of the Social Security.  This is lifted from Dale Coberly&#8217;s note back to him:</div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><p>Your analysis that SS is desperately broke ignores the fact that the projected shortfall can be made up by raising the payroll tax one half of one tenth of one percent per year, while incomes are projected to go up over one full percent per year.</p>
<p>This would result ultimately in an increase in the payroll tax of about 4% of income (which you misleadingly call a 33% increase in the tax, which it is, but which is likely to mislead the average reader).  A 4% increase in the tax really amounts to a 4% increase in the savings protected by Social Security, which is properly understood as insurance against the potential failure of other modes of saving for retirement.  The 4% increase is a very fair price to pay for the longer life expectancy that the workers paying the tax will enjoy.</p>
<p>They really won&#8217;t want to work any longer, and since they are paying for their own benefits, there is no reason they should have to.  Further, while the tax increase does represent a higher percent of their income going to their own longer retirement, the projected increases in their wages would leave them at least twice as well off &#8220;after the tax&#8221; (that is, in terms of money left in their pockets each month after putting away the extra for their longer retirement) as they are today.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if you are able to understand all this, or if you just prefer to ignore it.  But I do what I can.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>by Dale Coberly</p>
<p> A kind person suggested I be ready to be crucified about calling for increasing a &#8220;regressive tax&#8221; if I call for raising the payroll tax  forty cents per week.</p>
<p>The people who say Social Security is a regressive tax are suffering from brain damage caused by parrot fever.  Having been taught to say &#8220;regressive tax, regressive tax&#8221; when they  were young and impressionable, they can&#8217;t stop themselves. They don&#8217;t  mean anything by it, but they think they do.</p>
<p>They don&#8217;t know what a regressive tax is.  They don&#8217;t know what a tax is.  They don&#8217;t know what regressive means.  And above all they have no sense of proportion.</p>
<p>The &#8220;tax&#8221; increase needed by Social Security is forty cents per week.  This is the cost to the average worker of saving a program  that will give them about twenty thousand dollars a year when they retire.  But the &#8220;liberals&#8221; call that forty cents a &#8220;regressive tax,  regressive tax&#8221; and would see the poor loose that twenty thousand  dollars in order to save forty cents worth of &#8220;regressive tax, regressive tax.&#8221;</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>A regressive tax is a tax that falls more heavily on the poor than on the rich as a percent of income.  The usual case is a &#8220;sales tax&#8221; as compared to a graduated &#8220;income tax.&#8221;  As long as either tax is used to pay for the same government expenses, the sales tax is more  &#8220;regressive&#8221; than the graduated income tax because the poor spend a larger percentage of their income than the rich on items covered by the usual sales tax schemes.</p>
<p>But Social Security does not pay for government expenses.  It pays for the retirement of the person paying the tax.  So it is not a tax in the usual sense in which a tax is a payment to the government for government expenses.</p>
<p>And Social Security is designed so that people who end up poor after a lifetime of work get a much higher return on their &#8220;investment&#8221; than those who end up &#8220;well off.&#8221;  So the poor are paying LESS for what they get than the rich. The poor are getting MORE for what they  pay than the rich.  This is called &#8220;progressive.&#8221;  It is the opposite of &#8220;regressive.&#8221;</p>
<p>But you will never convince someone who got his PhD by saying &#8220;regressive tax, regressive tax.&#8221;  And that, my children, is why you won&#8217;t get Social Security when you get old.  Because the professional liberals will save you from that bad old regressive tax, regressive tax.</p>

<p><strong>Fixable Error</strong><br /><strong>New Insight</strong><br /><strong>and Social Security</strong><br />(amended version)<br />When errors are honest, and people keep talking in good faith, they are usually fixable. One of the errors I will talk about here is mine. The new insight is entirely the result of the good faith and honesty of Eric Laursen who has written a book about Social Security called The People&#8217;s Pension.</p>
<p>In the transcript ( <u><a href="http://retirementrevised.com/money/qa-eric-laursen-on-the-peoples-pension">http://retirementrevised.com/money/qa-eric-laursen-on-the-peoples-pension</a></u> ) of Mark Miller&#8217;s interview with Laursen about his book appears this statement regarding possible fixes for Social Security:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;A fallback would be to raise payroll taxes for everyone, but so slowly that it would have little impact – say, by 0.01 percent a year&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I knew this was wrong, and I thought I knew why: Lots of people get confused between 0.01 which is one percent of one, and 0.01 percent, which is one ten thousandth of whatever you are talking about. A tax increase of 0.01% on a 40,000 dollar per year income would be 4 dollars a year. This would not help Social Security. But it is marvelous that a tax increase of 0.05%, which is one half of one tenth of one percent, per year would solve the Social Security problem entirely. This is five times 0.01%, or about 20 dollars per year, per year, or about 40 cents per week, per year.</p>
<p>Laursen told me he had gotten the number from Monique Morrissey ( <u><a href="http://www.epi.org/page/-/old/briefingpapers/BriefingPaper287.pdf">http://www.epi.org/page/-/old/briefingpapers/BriefingPaper287.pdf</a></u> ).</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8221; These projected longevity gains, if they materialize, could also be offset by a 0.01 percentage-point increase in the payroll tax per year from 2025 to 2084 (from 6.2% to 6.8% overall). Over this 60-year period, average wages are projected to nearly double in inflation-adjusted terms. &#8220;</p></blockquote>
<p>So I read Morrissey&#8217;s paper to see where she had gotten the number. Morrissey is primarily arguing against increasing the retirement age, and she wishes to show that increases in life expectancy are not the drivers of the projected shortfall in SS:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8221; However, gains in life expectancy represent only a small part of the fiscal challenge facing Social Security. The increase in the normal retirement age from 65 to 67, currently underway, already offsets gains in life expectancy for workers born before 1960, and longevity gains for younger generations account for only a fifth of the projected Social Security shortfall. &#8220;</p></blockquote>
<p>So the difficulty is not in the arithmetic, but in the fact that she is talking about only ONE cause of the projected shortfall, which by her reckoning is only one fifth of the problem.<br />That&#8217;s fine, but it can lead to confusion. As in fact it did for Laursen and me.</p>
<p>Morrissey&#8217;s essay is mostly written in opposition to raising the retirement age, and it is WELL WORTH READING.</p>
<p>She provided me with a new insight.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>That said, I disagree with her conclusion.</p>
<p>Her conclusion is that raising the cap on income subject to the payroll tax, scrapping it entirely, is the answer to the Social Security projected shortfall. I think that such a solution has no chance whatsoever in this political climate. And I do not think it would be a reasonable solution for a program that is successful exactly because it is NOT WELFARE. Raising the cap would turn SS into welfare by “taxing the rich” for benefits they will not get.</p>
<p>Moreover the cost of fixing SS by raising the payroll tax under the current cap is so tiny&#8230; forty cents per week&#8230; that no one would even feel it. And it would preserve the fundamental nature of Social Security: the “tax” is paid for by the workers who will get the benefits.</p>
<p>Morrissey appears to think of Social Security as “social welfare”, in which the whole society&#8230; and that means the rich&#8230; pay for the needs of the needy.</p>
<p>But American workers don’t see themselves as needy; they don’t want welfare; and they very much like the idea that they “paid for it themselves.”</p>
<p>And the American “rich” are not going to pay for the workers retirement. They see themselves as having a hard enough time paying for welfare for the truly needy without being asked to foot the bill for every single worker’s expected twenty years in retirement.</p>
<p>But Morrissey provided an insight which I had missed.</p>
<p>I have been saying that the need for the payroll tax increase is because future workers are going to be living longer in retirement than past workers.</p>
<p>Morrissey shows that in some important ways this is not exactly true. Future workers will not, in general, live significantly longer than current retirees. The increases in longevity will be mostly among the rich.</p>
<p>She shows the previous increases in longevity have largely been paid for by other factors, including increases in population and increases in incomes. I’ll leave you to read her essay to learn about this. Essentially I will argue that those other factors have masked the &#8220;true&#8221; cost of Social Security, and it would be serious error to to try to make up for changes in them by changing the fundamental nature of Social Security from &#8220;the workers pay for it themselves,&#8221; to &#8220;social insurance,&#8221; or what we call &#8220;welfare.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is not that easy to correct demographic trends, or economic trends, or inequities in the earnings of the poor vs the rich. These are problems that should be addressed, but they should be addressed outside of Social Security. Social Security is insurance, designed to help people through bad times. It is a mistake to shoulder Social Security with the burden of correcting all the ills of society that may fall upon the poor.</p>
<p>But that brings me to my error. And why I am not going to “fix” it.</p>
<p>I came into the Social Security debate from a background that has nothing to do with politics or “social welfare.” This gives me a different “frame.” [note this is not Lakoff’s political framing, but more like framing a problem in physics so that it can be solved. Peter Peterson has framed the problem so it cannot be solved at all. Peterson has dedicated a billion dollars to making his framing the conventional wisdom, and I think Morrissey has accepted it without thinking too much about it.<br />Consider a universe in which, for the moment, there is no population growth, no increases in longevity, no economic growth, no inflation, no interest, no changes in longevity. </p>
<p>But in this universe people still work when they are adults and strong, and want to be able to retire at some point before they die. They will need to &#8220;save&#8221; for that retirement some of what they produce while they are working.</p>
<p>This leads to a Basic Retirement Equation:</p>
<p>years worked, times percent of earnings “saved,” equals years retired, times retirement income (as a percent of prior earnings).</p>
<p>So if you are going to work for forty years and expect to live ten years in retirement at 40% of your prior income, you would need to “save” ten percent of your income:</p>
<p><strong>40 X 10% = 10 X 40%</strong></p>
<p>It does not matter, in this universe, if you save this as gold in a box, or as a non-cash implicit agreement by which working adults pay for the needs of the elderly, or by a formal pay as you go “tax”.</p>
<p>In all cases you are deferring 10% of your present income so that you will have enough to live on when you get old. This can be done by hoarding “gold”, which is dangerous, or by implicit “honor your mother and your father” agreement between generations, or by an explicit government-managed (but not “government paid”) tax and benefit system.</p>
<p>Now imagine another universe in which nothing has changed except that you expect to live 20 years in retirement. The equation now becomes:</p>
<p>&#8220;40 years working, times 20% savings, equals 20 years in retirement, times 40% “replacement benefit.”</p>
<p>This may look like a lot of money to save, or be taxed, but it would be a perfectly reasonable solution to the problem of living for twenty years after you become too old to work, or want to work. The key here is you have to realize the 20% is “your money”. You saved it. And it will be you who spends it.<br />As long as the other members of the society agree that this is a reasonable way to apportion earnings between working years and retirement years, it is no problem. Especially if the workers agree that money not used by those who die earlier than the 20 year expectancy will be used to pay for the needs of those who live longer. This is not welfare. It’s insurance.</p>
<p>Now, in the real world, the fact has been that other factors including income growth and population growth&#8230; at least the population of workers in the Social Security program&#8230; have worked to reduce the needed “savings” or tax rate. [Also, for the past few hundred years or so, &#8220;interest&#8221; or &#8220;capital growth, including appreciation of stocks, has reduced the needed &#8220;savings&#8221; rate. But this has been accompanied by the risks of inflation and market losses, which is what Social Security was invented to provide insurance against.]</p>
<p>But these other factors are OUTSIDE of Social Security. And Social Security does not depend on them to work.</p>
<p>It may be that rising income inequality, reductions in birth rate, or other economic and demographic factors will affect the tax rate needed to provide a reasonable retirement “rate.” But the BASIC fact is that it is the ratio between working years and retirement years that determines “the cost of retirement.”</p>
<p>Social Security is designed explicitly to take care of the ups and downs in the economy, including demographics. If rates have to go up, or if benefits have to come down in response to hard times, so be it. That is the history of the human race: There are fat years and lean years.</p>
<p>Some people argue, in bad faith I think, that ups and downs in Social Security &#8220;return on investment&#8221; are a kind of generational crime. They prefer you don&#8217;t look at the ups and downs in return on investment in the private markets. Even that box of gold under the bed, or the ability of the working adults in a family to care for their own elderly relatives, or the ability of investors to realize a rate of return they need to fund their own retirement&#8230; will be subject to factors like demographics, wars, the state of the economy, inflation, market losses, and will result in greater or lower &#8220;returns on investment&#8221; from one generation to the next. But the enemies of Social Security want you to think that if SS does not make exactly the same return to each generation, some generation is being &#8220;robbed.&#8221;</p>
<p>As it happens we are looking at&#8230; according to the Trustees&#8230; a period of time where some of the factors that have held down the cost of Social Security in the past will not be as much of a help in the future as they have been in the past. These &#8220;anti-factors&#8221; include rising inequality of income, a falling birth rate, lower productivity gains.. a combination of factors that will require either a benefit cut of about 20% or a tax raise of about 4%, which can be phased in over about eighty years, at one half of one tenth of one percent at a time.</p>
<p>Cutting a benefit that is already at survival level by 20% is insane. Raising a tax 4% over about 80 years wouldn’t even be felt. [The 4% tax increase would occur while incomes are increasing more than 100%, so that, in round numbers, after eighty years your after tax income will have increased 96% instead of 100%&#8230; you are not going to notice the difference&#8230; unless of course you threw away your Social Security in order to &#8220;save&#8221; that 4%.]</p>
<p>But these factors are external to the basic mathematics of retirement, especially from the perspective of the individual. The basic relation is: {the number of years you work compared to the number of years you expect to be retired} determines {the ratio between tax rate and benefit rate}.  </p>
<p>While it is true that relying on the “whole economy pays for everybody” could in principle produce the same result, on average, through general taxation and a &#8220;government pension.&#8221; This perspective leads to an understanding which is basically wrong, and which the politics of this country, and the psychology of both the workers and the “rich” is not ready to accept. We prefer an explicit relation between the money we &#8220;save&#8221; as individuals and the benefits we get as individuals. We prudently modify this principle enough to allow for an insurance factor whereby those who cannot save enough over a lifetime of work to pay for a decent retirement are helped out by the &#8220;excess&#8221; of those who were able to save &#8220;more than enough&#8221; in the protected savings plan we know as Social Security. But the principle is still essentially &#8220;you pay for what you get.&#8221;</p>
<p>Morrissey may be correct that only one fifth of the projected shortfall is “due to” rising life expectancies, but that is because those other factors that have previously reduced the cost due to rising life expectancies may no longer be able to do so.   </p>
<p>We cannot easily change those factors, but going from there to propose a “solution” that destroys the fundamental nature of Social Security by changing it from “worker pays” to “the rich pay,” will in the first place not be accepted by those rich who have the political power in this country, and in the second place would deprive the workers of both the satisfaction and the political power of being able to say “I paid for it myself.”</p>
<p>If there were no alternative&#8230; if the extra revenue needed for a decent retirement were beyond the reach of the workers, then a welfare solution might be necessary&#8230; though this would be a bad way to arrange an economy over the long run. But since the cost of “fixing” Social Security, whatever the reason for the shortfall, amounts to only forty cents per week per year, it is far, far better that the workers pay for it themselves than to have them go to Mr. Richfellow and say, “Please, Sir, can I have some more?”</p>
<p>Meanwhile I will keep saying the need for the “tax” increase is because we are going to be living longer. I believe this is the more fundamental truth. And it’s certainly a lot easier to explain to people than all the complications Morrissey addresses in her essay. And it leads to the correct solution: the workers need to pay a little more for their own retirement because they will be living longer. </p>
<p>When you go to the store you do not go up to a well dressed stranger and say, “Sir, it looks like you have more money than I have. Please pay for my groceries.”</p>
<p>Social Security is you paying now while you have the money for the groceries you will need later when you may not have the money. That is a lot better for the country, and a lot safer for the workers, than teaching them to expect &#8220;the rich&#8221; to pay for the predictable costs of a large, and normal, part of their lives.</p>

<p><tt><strong>SAVING SOCIAL SECURITY SIMPLIFIED</strong></tt><br /><tt><strong></strong><br />The Trustees Report came out again this week.</p>
<p>And all the newspeople told us again that we are doomed.  Doomed.   <br />"Social Security is running out of money!"</p>
<p>Except it isn't.</p>
<p>And all the Professional Defenders of Social Security rushed out to  <br />tell us, "We can save Social Security: just make the rich pay for it!"</p>
<p>Except they won't.</p>
<p>And they really shouldn't.  And we shouldn't want them to.  Most  <br />workers understand that Their Social Security is Their money.  They  <br />paid for it.  They need to know that IT'S NOT WELFARE.</p>
<p>But all the paid experts and politicians, and all the high end  <br />newssources can only think in terms of welfare.  So the Bad Cop says  <br />we got to cut it.  And the Good Cop says we got to make the rich pay  <br />for it.</p>
<p>But actually all we really need to do is just pay for it ourselves...  <br />as we always have.</p>
<p>It wont cost much.  An additional 40 cents per week each year will  <br />pay for the whole "shortfall."</p>
<p>You don't have to take my word for it.  The Congressional Budget  <br />Office says the same thing.  A CBO Study:  <em><strong>Social Security Policy  <br />Options, July 2010</strong></em>,  Option <strong>2</strong> (page 17) says "Increase the Payroll  <br />Tax Rate by 2 Percentage Points Over 20 years... this option would  <br />raise the combined payroll tax rate gradually, by 0.1 percentage  <br />point (0.05 percentage points each for employers and employees) every  <br />year from 2012 to 2031... This option would extend the trust fund  <br />exhaustion date to 2083."</tt><br /><tt></tt><br /><tt></tt><br /><tt><a name="more"></a><br />Please note that while the tax would be increasing at one tenth of  <br />one percent per year... combined... wages would be increasing over  <br />one full percent per year.  So in today's terms the tax for the  <br />employee would increase by 40 cents per week (and another 40 cents  <br />for the employer), while wages are going up eight dollars per week  <br />each year.</p>
<p>CBO Option 3 would Increase the Payroll Tax Rate by 3 Percentage  <br />Points Over 60 years.  This would be a twenty cents per week increase  <br />in the tax each year for the employee and the employer.</p>
<p>With both of these Options it is likely that a similar increase would  <br />need to be enacted at the end of the twenty, or sixty, year period.  <br />This is unlikely to be a problem after people have seen that a  <br />gradual increase is not a "burden."  In fact it is unlikely they will  <br />even notice it.  Nor will the increases continue forever.  The  <br />Trustees Projection is that the need for increases will flatten and  <br />fall to essentially zero after life expectancies stabilize between  <br />2050 and 2070 or so.</p>
<p>Remember it is not a tax going into a government black hole.  It is  <br />You saving your own money, protected by "pay as you go with wage  <br />indexing,"  so that if all else fails you can retire when you need  <br />to.  You get your money back with interest in an annuity that will  <br />last the rest of your life. No matter what.</p>
<p>Now here is the hard part for you.</p>
<p>You need to think about this and make sure you understand it.  Then I  <br />am going to ask you to sign a petition.  Yes, I hate petitions too.   <br />But it's the only way I can think of to spread the word to the people  <br />that they can save their own Social Security for pennies per week.   <br />And not have to turn it into welfare by "raising the cap,"  or make  <br />it worthless as retirement insurance by cutting benefits, means  <br />testing, or raising the retirement age.</p>
<p>The petition calls for enactment of CBO Option 2 or 3.  It is not so  <br />important exactly which of these is enacted, or some variation.  What  <br />is important is that people learn how cheap it would be for them to  <br />save their own Social Security.  They won't learn it from the media,  <br />the politicians, or the experts.</p>

Then, and I know  <br />this is an imposition,  ask your friends to read this and talk about  <br />it, and sign the petition.</p>

<p><strong>DAMNED LIARS</strong></p>
<p><strong>AND SOCIAL SECURITY</strong></p>
<p>There are liars, damned liars, and “non partisan experts.” The non partisan experts are expert liars, “non partisan” because that’s the best lie of all. A damned liar need not be an expert, but he is usually pretty clever at mixing “true” facts, or at least “facts you can’t prove are not true,” with false implications that lead the people he wants to deceive into hurting themselves with false conclusions. Those false conclusions are ideally tied to other ideas that the mark really, really wants to believe, so he is never really able to let go of the lie he has been taught.</p>
<p>Robert J. Samuelson is not an expert, but he gets all his “facts” from them pre-twisted and designed to mislead. He published a pretty good example of the art of deception on Easter Sunday in the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/wouldroosevelt-recognize-todays-social-security/2012/04/08/gIQALChd4S_story.html" target="_blank">Washington Post</a>.</p>
<p>Good enough, in fact, that when I started to deconstruct the lies for this post, I soon saw that I was in for a long job.. one too long to expect readers to put up with. So I will have to content myself, and you, dear reader, with “pointing at” the truth and leave you to decide for yourself how far you want to go to understand it for yourself.</p>
<p>Samuelson begins by claiming that FDR would not approve of Social Security today because it has become &#8220;the dole&#8221; that Roosevelt tried to avoid. His argument is entirely fallacious. And, as it turns out, he is telling these lies in order to encourage us to change Social Security so that it BECOMES the dole. One can&#8217;t be sure that Samuelson recognizes this himself. A career of telling lies for money must do terrible things to a man&#8217;s brain.</p>
<p>Samuelson is very confused&#8230; or wants you to be confused&#8230; about the differences between &#8220;pay as you go&#8221; and “the dole” and &#8220;contributory&#8221; pension plans. </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>He gets the history of the development of the Social Security idea exactly backwards. For a clearer understanding of that history I recommend &#8220;The Battle to Save Social Security,&#8221; by Nancy Altman.</p>
<p>But rather than get lost in the mazes of Samuelson&#8217;s mind, I will attempt to describe the development of &#8220;pay as you go,&#8221; not as a &#8220;plan&#8221; but as a fact on the ground. Let us begin by examining one of Samuelson&#8217;s lies&#8230; a very familiar one:</p>
<p>But now, demographics are unfriendly. In 1960, there were five workers per recipient; today, there are three, and by 2025 the ratio will approach two. Roosevelt’s fear has materialized. Paying all benefits requires higher taxes, cuts in other programs or large deficits.<br />This is intended to deceive. The ratio of workers to retirees will not cause large deficits or cuts in other programs, or higher taxes. The reason the ratio has changed over the years is mostly due to the arithmetic of phasing in a pay as you go plan.</p>
<p>Suppose there is a great nation in which workers have been working and saving for their future retirement by putting some of their earnings into bank accounts or into stocks and bonds. Then suppose that a great catastrophe comes to that nation and wipes out the savings. The older workers have lost the most..they had the most savings to lose. But even younger workers can now understand that their own future savings will be at risk of being lost just as the older workers have lost theirs. <br />The workers come up with a way to &#8220;insure&#8221; their savings. They agree to join a retirement insurance pool with a &#8220;pay as you go&#8221; financing plan. Every worker will contribute a small part of his weekly pay to a fund that will pay for the &#8220;benefits&#8221; of those who retire.</p>
<p>Suppose there are forty million workers. A million aged 64, a million aged 63, and so on down to a million aged 26 and a million aged 25. The first year there are forty million workers and zero retirees. The ratio of workers to retirees is 40 to zero. The next year the million 64 year olds turn 65 and retire. The 25 year olds turn 26&#8230; and a million new workers turn 25 and begin paying the “tax.” Now there are forty million workers and one million retirees. The ratio of workers to retirees is now 40 to 1. The next year another million workers will retire, and a million new workers will come in at age 25. Now there will be forty million workers and two million retirees.. the ratio of workers to retirees is now 40 to 2. And so on. But not forever. Because eventually some of the retirees will die, and eventually the number of retirees who die will be equal to the number of people who retire each year, so the ratio of workers to retirees will stabilize according to the life expectancy of retirees. If that life expectancy is about 12 years, the ratio of workers to retirees will stabilize at about 3 to 1. Note here that the ratio of workers to retirees is the same as the ratio of working years to retirement years for each worker (on average).</p>
<p>The workers designing our retirement insurance plan know this. They know that the early retirees will collect more in benefits than they paid in. But they decide that this is fair; in fact it is exactly what is needed: Those who will retire soon are those who have lost the most savings in the recent disaster, and have the least time to recover by saving up enough under a &#8220;contributory&#8221; financing plan. The workers also know that those older workers contributed to the previous system: a combination of welfare and old fashioned “honor your father and your mother” care of their own parents. The workers also know the older workers cared for them when they were younger and built the infrastructure by which they are able to make money at all. They “paid for” their retirement, even though the money did not go into the current plan. The workers understand that by ‘grandfathering in” the older workers they are merely doing the fair and honorable thing of providing a transition from the previous, failed, plan to the new, better, plan.</p>
<p>The workers also know that the younger workers will not be hurt by “paying for” the older workers. The younger workers will eventually pay the full cost of their own retirement. They will not have to pay “more” because part of that money was used to pay for those who went before them. This is one of the beauties of “pay as you go” : As long as new workers will need the same insurance, they will join the pool and their contributions will pay directly for the retirement of the older workers. But the new workers won’t lose anything by that because their own retirement will be paid for by the newer workers coming into the system.</p>
<p>This is not a Ponzi scheme. The workers ALL get what they are paying for, and they will keep coming into the system as long as they need a way to insure their own retirement.<br />The current ratio is near 3 to 1 and is expected to go to near 2 to 1. But this is not a catastrophe. The current payroll tax is about 6%. If 3 workers paying 6% of their pay can &#8220;support&#8221; one retiree. Two workers would need to pay about 9% of their pay to support one retiree. Or, and this is a better way to think of it, each worker would need to pay 6% to pay for a life expectancy of 12 years. If he expects to live 20 years, he will need to pay about 9%. This may look expensive to you until you realize it is exactly the amount of money you would need to save for twenty years of retirement whether there was Social Security or not. While it’s true you “might” do better on the stock market, it is also true you might do a whole lot worse. And having less than you need is much, much more painful than having more than you need is pleasurable.</p>
<p>The numbers are actually a little better than this, and it will take a long time to reach that 2:1 ratio, if ever. And if you read the Trustees Report&#8230; if you read it very carefully&#8230; it shows that under their predictions&#8230; including the increase in life expectancy and the reduced ratio of workers to retirees&#8230;the payroll tax would only have to be raised to just over 8% for the worker. <br />Moreover the need for the raise will be so gradual that it can be met by raising the tax an average of one half of one tenth of one percent per year while wages are going up over a full percent per year. This means that a tax increase of about forty cents per week each year, while wages are going up about eight dollars per week each year, would enable workers to continue to pay for their own retirement, as they always have, and would have TWICE AS MUCH MONEY in their pockets AFTER paying for their longer retirement as they have today.</p>
<p>This preserves the INSURANCE nature of Social Security. It will add NOTHING to &#8220;the deficit,&#8221; and it means YOU will get to collect YOUR money when the time comes without welfare &#8220;means testing.” having to beg the rich man to pay for it, benefit cuts, or increase in the retirement age&#8230;which you will not like, whatever you think while you are young.</p>
<p>If you read the Samuelson editorial, it is important to keep in mind that what Samuelson means by “contributory” is you “invest” in stocks and hope for the best while you build up your savings&#8230; exactly the plan that failed and led to the need for Social Security in the first place. There is nothing wrong with investing, but Social Security provides you with insurance “in case” you don’t do as well as you hoped. As the ad says, “priceless.”</p>
<p>You also need to keep in mind that Social Security contributes NOTHING to the deficit. It is NOT welfare. It is paid for entirely by the workers who will get the benefits. Social Security has NOTHING to do with “why America’s budget problems are so intractable.” That problem is caused by deficit spending to pay for arms buildups, actual wars, and recessions caused by the big money gambling schemes&#8230; that Samuelson’s friends want you to play with them.</p>
<p>Samuelson seems confused about “pay as you go.” He does not understand money at all. He thinks that if “your money” is used to pay the benefits of someone already retired that you have “lost” your money. But this is no more true than you have lost your money because when you put it in the bank, the bank gives it to someone else to use while waiting for you to ask for it back.<br />Samuelson cites Sylvester Schieber. I have not read Schieber’s new book. But his “The Real Deal” was a collection of clever lies. Schieber qualifies as a “non partisan expert.”</p>
<p>Samuelson says “Americans believe (falsely) that their payroll taxes have been segregated to pay for their benefits&#8230;” This is a lie. There is nothing false about the segregation. It is the law. Your payroll taxes pay for your benefits. No other taxes pay for your benefits, and your taxes cannot be used for any other reason. They do not contribute to “the deficit” in any way.</p>
<p>Samuelson seems to think that the fact that you receive more in benefits than you paid for&#8230; “even assuming (again, fictitiously) that they had been invested” is an argument AGAINST Social Security. It looks to me like an argument FOR it. You get more in benefits than you paid in, because the benefits are paid for out of taxes on incomes that increase over time, even when the tax rate does not. This IS an investment. It is an investment in the growth of a “corporation” called The United States of America.</p>
<p>Samuelson is conflating Social Security with Medicare. The growth in medical costs predicted over the next century will require that the Medicare tax be increased, or that medical costs be brought down. But cutting Medicare will not lower medical costs, and it’s a pretty stupid idea to cut your insurance because you expect your medical costs to increase.</p>
<p>Finally, Samuelson, after saying that Roosevelt would hate Social Security today because it is “the dole,” a statement that is a lie, calls for us to ask “who among the elderly need benefits?” because he thinks we need to turn Social Security into a needs based welfare program&#8230; the “dole.”<br />As I said, when a man chooses to tell lies for a living, it must do terrible things to his brain.<br />Social Security is an “entitlement” because YOU HAVE PAID FOR IT. Don’t let the liars confuse you. It does not need to be “fixed.” All of the “fixes” on the table are stealth plans to destroy it. They want your money for their gambling games, and they hate the idea of workers having the security to EVER be able to say, “I have enough. Now I want to retire and do something with my remaining years better than working for the boss.”</p>

<p>AARP vs. Social Security?</p>
<p>Last week <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/16/social-security-cuts-aarp_n_1344934.html?ref=daily-brief">Huffington Post</a></p>
<p>reported that AARP was embarking on a</p>
<p>&#8220;Social Security and Medicare &#8220;listening tour&#8221; called <a href="http://www.aarp.org/politics-society/advocacy/info-03-2012/earned-a-say-events-tn1796.html">&#8220;You’ve Earned a Say and We’re Listening.&#8221;</a> Through &#8220;town halls, community conversations, bus tours and other events,&#8221; the influential organization promises to offer members a chance to speak out on the simmering debate over the future of Social Security and Medicare.</p>
<p>&#8220;The outreach is part of the group&#8217;s campaign to restore <a href="http://firedoglake.com/2011/06/30/supporting-social-security-benefit-cuts-whats-in-it-for-aarp/">trust it lost</a> during last year&#8217;s spending debate, when a top AARP official told the<i> Wall Street Journal</i> the organization was open to cuts to the entitlement programs. &#8220;The ship was sailing. I wanted to be at the wheel when that happens,&#8221; AARP policy chief John Rother said, <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304186404576389760955403414.html">according to <i>the Wall Street Journal</i></a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;But while AARP staffers fan out across the country to hear from members, the group&#8217;s CEO, Barry Rand, will be listening to a different cast of characters.</p>
<p><a href="http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/saloninvite.pdf"><u>An AARP invitation</u></a> to a secret &#8220;Relaxed and Robust Evening of &#8216;Salon Style&#8217; Conversation&#8221; to be held at a Capitol Hill home on March 27, obtained by The Huffington Post, indicates that the organization is still very much interested in a &#8220;grand-bargain&#8221; style deal that puts Social Security and Medicare cuts on the table.<br />&#8220;&#8221;AARP is not pursuing any closed door deals or grand bargains,&#8221; said an AARP spokeswoman. &#8220;Our main focus is hearing from our members, and all Americans, what they think about ways to strengthen Social Security and Medicare. That&#8217;s precisely why we&#8217;re launching &#8216;You&#8217;ve Earned a Say.&#8217; We are interested in hearing from all sides and having civil discourse on these issues.&#8221;</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>&#8220;The invite list for 2012 suggests that AARP is still very much open to cutting Social Security and Medicare, as a majority of this year&#8217;s expected &#8220;thought leaders&#8221; have thoughts that involve slashing Social Security.<br />&#8220;&#8221;They want to be at the table when a deal is cut,&#8221; said one person who declined to be named because he continues to work closely with AARP. The irony is that while AARP&#8217;s legislative team may be convinced that a deal is inevitable, a grand bargain actively opposed by AARP would be effectively impossible for Congress to pass.&#8221;</p>
<p>What this amounts to is that AARP, granny&#8217;s lawyer, sees granny being raped by a bunch of thugs. But instead off rushing in to help her, he waits to see how the struggle is going. If it looks like the rapists are going to win, he will rush in to help them. Just in case, you know, there might be something in it for him.<br />There were 3700 comments on Huff Post to this article. Most of them understood that AARP is not one of the good guys, and their &#8220;we want to hear from you&#8221; is just a cynical smokescreen..no more than a survey to see how effective the lies have been. But sadly, not one of the 3700 comments showed any real understanding of Social Security or the &#8220;crisis&#8221; surrounding it. They have all grown up hearing the lies, and no effective answer to those lies. Not surprising when the politicians and the press are effectively owned by the Liars, and the &#8220;liberals&#8221; who defend Social Security always start out by talking as if the lies were true.<br />Rather than attempt to counter the lies, I will just repeat the simple truth here one more time and hope that someone finds a way to tell the people:</p>
<p>Social Security has nothing to do with the deficit, and it never will. Social Security is not going broke, and it never can. Social Security is not paid for by &#8220;the government.&#8221; It is paid for by the workers who will get the benefits. </p>
<p>With no change whatsoever Social Security can continue to provide &#8220;adequate&#8221; benefits so workers can afford at least a basic retirement after about forty years of work&#8230; that is when they reach 62, though they can get a larger monthly benefit if they choose to retire later. </p>
<p>IF those same workers as a voting majority decide they want the &#8220;same replacement rate&#8221; (monthly benefit as a percent of of their average lifetime real working wages) &#8230; over a longer life expectancy in retirement&#8230; they can raise their own payroll tax one half of one tenth of one percent per year&#8230; or about forty cents per week each year in today&#8217;s terms while their wages are increasing over one full percent per year&#8230; or about eight dollars per week per year.</p>
<p>Pretty much everything else you hear about Social Security is Lies or nonsense. There is no need to raise the cap, cut benefits, raise the retirement age, means test, or tax the rich. At most just a tiny raise in what amounts to an insurance premium to cover the increased costs associated with living longer in a richer society.</p>

<p><strong>LES MISERABLES:   SOCIAL SECURITY</strong><br />Javert And Evil</p>
<p>From a message from the <em><strong>National Consumer Law Center</strong></em> (reference <a href="mailto:msaunders@nclc.org">msaunders@nclc.org</a>):  <br />
<blockquote><strong>&#8220;</strong>It’s perfectly fine for a person who failed to pay their child support to end up penniless and living in their car, and to die that way.<strong>”</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>– High Ranking U.S. Treasury Official, in response to a request for help with Treasury’s rules which allow 100% of Social Security benefits to be taken to pay for decades-old child support.  February 3, 2012.           As the result of the concurrence of two new Treasury rules, elderly and disabled Social Security recipients will soon lose all of their benefits to old child support orders.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>•   As of March, 2013, all recipients of federal benefits must receive benefits through electronic deposit, either through deposit directly into a bank account, or using the Treasury authorized Direct Express Card. (31 CFR § 208.4.) </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><strong>·</strong>  Treasury’s new garnishment rule, intended to protect benefits in bank accounts from garnishment allows child support orders to garnish all of the funds in the accounts. (31 CFR 221.4.)   </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>As a result,  65% of the recipient’s benefits will be withheld pursuant to administrative seizures and paid directly to the child support office.  <u>The remaining 35% will be deposited into the beneficiary’s bank account, where it will be seized in full through a bank garnishment.</u></p></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>Most SS recipients who owe child support are old and or disabled.  Their children are grown and the child  support is owed to the state.  The amounts of the orders have ballooned to tens of thousands because of annual 10 or 12% interest rates applied.<br /><a name="more"></a><strong>·</strong>    Although blind and elderly, Mr. W.  found a legal services lawyer in September 2010 when the Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE) ordered Treasury to take $217 from his Social Security check (which normally is $775).  Five weeks after the legal services lawyer filed papers, the OCSE stopped the garnishment as it was required to do under New York State law.  But in January 2011, the OCSE&#8217;s computer matched and froze Mr. W. &#8216;s bank account, depriving him of his entire Social Security payment.  Again the legal services lawyer interceded, and after several weeks, the OCSE returned Mr. W. &#8216;s Social Security.  But in July 2011, the OCSE&#8217;s computer froze Mr. W. &#8216;s account again.  South Brooklyn Legal Services fought to retrieve  his Social Security payment so Mr. W.  could pay his rent. </p></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><strong>·</strong>    Mr. R.  is sixty two years old, homebound, and lives entirely off of his $780 Social Security payment. In June 2011, the OCSE ordered the U.S. Treasury to garnish 65% of Mr. R.  Social Security check for child support arrears owed to his adult children.  This reduced his check to $273.  Unable to pay his rent or feed himself for an entire month, R.  protested to the OCSE.  After reviewing evidence in July 2011 showing Mr. R.  lived below the poverty line, the OCSE stopped the garnishment as New York law requires.  But the OCSE did not reprogram its computers.  On August 5, 2011, Mr. Richard&#8217;s bank account containing his restored, direct deposit Social Security check was matched and seized by the OCSE&#8217;s computer.  Although a legal services lawyer sent Mr. R.&#8217;s bank records to the OSCE, the account remains restrained.  So desperate remains Mr. R.  that he went by access-a-ride in his wheelchair to the local OSCE office in person, begging for money for rent.  An  indifferent bureaucrat told him to come back with an award letter form Social Security and perhaps he would do something.  Mr. R.  called Social Security and was told he would receive an award letter in seven to ten business days.  And because the Social Security Administration could not switch his electronic check to paper until 6 weeks later, his next month’s check sailed electronically into his frozen account where it was also unreachable to him.</p></blockquote>
<p>I have argued in this space that Social Security is the only way ordinary workers have to save their own money for retirement in a way that is protected from inflation and market losses. People of a Libertarian Persuasion have argued that the money is NOT safe from “the government.” In general that has not been the case&#8230;  only one person has lost his Social Security money because of “the government,”  and he was a deported communist. that is, someone we the people, though our government, are perfectly willing to cheat and cause great harm.  I have thought the government would not be able to cheat and harm the entire population of Social Security contributors and recipients.   </p>
<p>But “the government”  appears to be embarked on a course to give aid and comfort to those who say “you can’t trust the government.”   </p>
<p>Well, you can’t.  Unless WE have the decency to protect “the least of these” against the evil that can and does appear from time to time in “our government,” we can expect the time will come when we are among that select minority which the government can cheat and harm with impunity because “we the people” don’t give a damn.</p>
<p>It’s not Social Security that is at fault here.  It is us.   </p>
<p>Let it be understood that I am not arguing that folks should not be required to pay their child support.  But hitting someone old or disabled with a decades old bill, with accrued interest, that takes everything they have to live on, and saying, “It’s perfectly fine for a person who failed to pay their child support to end up penniless and living in their car, and to die that way,&#8221;  &#8230;is evil.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if this is part of an ongoing &#8220;conspiracy&#8221; to discredit Social Security, or if it is just the random evil that can occur at all times&#8230; in government or out of it.  But it is evil.  And we should stop it.</p>

<p><strong>SOCIAL SECURITY   More How They Lie To Us</strong></p>
<p>David Brooks says in a column headlined  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/10/opinion/brooks-where-are-the-liberals.html" target="_blank">Where Are the Liberals?</a></p>
<p>Americans don&#8217;t hate government, but  &#8220;believe the government has been captured by rent-seekers.&#8221;    <br />
<blockquote>This is the disease that corrodes government at all times and in all places. As George F. Will wrote in a column in Sunday’s Washington Post, as government grows, interest groups accumulate, seeking to capture its power and money. Some of these rent-seeking groups are corporate types. . . .   Others exercise their power transparently and democratically. As Will notes, in 2009, the net worth of households headed by senior citizens was 47 times the net worth of households led by people under 35. Yet seniors use their voting power to protect programs that redistribute even more money from the young to the old and affluent.   </p></blockquote>
<p>The lie is that this  is a dishonest segue from corporate rent seekers to the implication that &#8220;seniors&#8221; (as if they were all the same) are rent seekers, and that the normal wealth that &#8220;a generation&#8221; acquires after a lifetime of work is somehow unnatural and unfair, and worst of all, that somehow SS is redistributing money to the affluent.   </p>
<p>SS doesn&#8217;t redistribute money except from your young self to your old self, exactly as if you had saved it (and bought insurance against inflation and financial setbacks of various kinds),  it does not add to the wealth of the wealthy, it helps the elderly poor live in modest comfort&#8230; very modest comfort.   </p>
<p>Just to be clear, not all the elderly are rich.  Social Security is a way for people to protect themselves from being destitute in old age. It does not make them rich.  It does not take money from “the government.” It does not take money from the poor young to give to the elderly rich.  Workers simply save their own money in an insurance plan run by, but not paid for by, the government.  The plan protects their savings from inflation, market losses, and certain kinds of personal bad luck.  It is insurance.  At the end of the day part of the premium paid by those who end up not needing the insurance (they did not have the fire) is used to help out those who did have the fire.  As it turns out even those who don’t have the fire get all of their premium back plus enough interest to make up for inflation and provide a real return on their “investment” equal to the average growth of wages over the time they have been making their Social Security payments.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />And, just in case you missed it, working people normally start out relatively poor in “wealth”,  they work all their lives to acquire “wealth” so they will be able to retire when they need to or want to.  For Brooks, or George Will to imply that somehow this is robbing the young is not just a lie, it’s a damned lie.   </p>
<p>SS does not redistribute money from the young to the old&#8230; except in the sense of deferring some of your spending when you are young so that you will have something to live on when you are old.  Pay as you go is the mechanism that makes this possible without risk of losses due to inflation or bad investments.     </p>
<p>This is no different from what you would do if you saved it on your own&#8230; except for the guarantee.  It is no more “rent seeking” than any other investment. All investment assumes that when you need to start cashing in your assets there will be another generation of investors out there glad to buy your stocks, or at least buy the products of the company you own stock in.  If this be “rent seeking” then the whole idea of capitalism is based on rent seeking.   </p>
<p>Brooks and George Will know this.  They are highly paid liars, confidence men paid to talk you out of your life savings.</p>

<p><strong>SOCIAL SECURITY</strong><br /><strong>How They Lie To Us</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204531404577054290268238730.html%22%3En" target="_blank">The Wall Street Journal</a> in the article <i>Newtitlement State </i>is unhappy with Newt Gingrich’s plan to privatize Social Security. Not only does it know that “privatization” failed when Bush offered it to the country, but they understand that most elected Republicans have distanced themselves from private-account carveouts as well.  Rather than embracing them, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, whose election was one of the Tea Party&#8217;s biggest victories in 2010, said during his campaign.<br />
<blockquote>“Privatization of the accounts has come and gone. There are other alternatives, such as [raising] the retirement age, how you adjust payments in the future, &#8216;need&#8217; measures, et cetera.</p></blockquote>
<p>What this means is that “privatization” was never more than a political strategy to kill Social Security. It failed, and now we have a better plan to kill Social Security that won’t cost so much.  </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what the Journal said about Gingrich&#8217;s plan</p>
<blockquote><p>The irony of Social Security is that its slow-motion solvency crisis is relatively easy to resolve—and the political system is moving toward consensus, if haltingly&#8230;. Personal Social Security accounts are desirable, but that doesn&#8217;t mean it makes sense to reject compromises that reduce future liabilities. Yet Mr. Gingrich proposes no such changes in his plan, perhaps because they are politically unpopular. But such an abdication opens him up to charges that he&#8217;s not serious about reform and that he has no plan to pay for the transition costs of going to personal accounts (that is, when younger workers put their money in their own accounts, rather than funding current retirees).</p></blockquote>
<p>This is so subtle and so dishonest that I thought it would be worth the time to deconstruct it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Its slow-motion solvency crisis&#8221; &#8230; note that this assumes there is a solvency crisis. In fact there is not one. Social Security is not insolvent and can never be insolvent. With no changes whatsoever it can pay future benefits that are adequate by today’s standards, benefits which will be in fact greater in real value than today’s benefits.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />One danger here is that even the defenders of Social Security have got into the habit of pointing to the 2036 DEATH OF THE TRUST FUND as “not a crisis&#8230; it’s 25 years away.”</p>
<p>Well 25 years is coming soon enough that folks are starting to notice that it will happen before or during their own retirement. The defenders of SS need to learn that 2036 is not a crisis, not because it is so far away, but because it never meant anything in the first place.</p>
<p>At about that time the Trust Fund will have done its job: helped pay for the boomer retirement, and will run out of money just the way your Christmas Fund runs out of money on or about December 25. After that Social Security goes back to regular old pay as you go financing, the way it was designed to work. </p>
<p>Because IN THE MEANWHILE life expectancy has been increasing, the disappearance of the Trust Fund will not cause, but will unmask, the need to increase the tax rate to pay for that increased life expectancy IF the workers of that time want to keep a replacement rate that reflects the INCREASE in their standard of living since the last time the tax rate was set. If they decide they will want to do this, the easiest and fairest way to accomplish it would be to start this year with a raise of forty cents per week, and to increase the tax another forty cents per week each year&#8230; while their wages will be increasing about eight dollars per week each year.</p>
<p>“is relatively easy to resolve.” Yes, of course it is. A tiny increase in the tax rate would do it. An increase so small no one would even notice it. But that’s not what the Journal means. They mean it would be relatively easy to cut benefits, or raise the retirement age, or “means test”. All of these would destroy Social Security and cause misery to hundreds of millions of people over time, but they would be “relatively easy” to enact.</p>
<p>“the political system is moving toward consensus,” With a billion dollars of Peterson money behind the “consensus” the political system is indeed moving. But this does not mean that “consensus” means either that honest people are realizing this is the best way, or that the people&#8230; as opposed to the politicians&#8230; are in favor of this. But, as the Journal knows, slip in the word “consensus” and readers will feel, if not think, that “everyone knows&#8230;and so it must be so.”</p>
<p>“Personal Social Security accounts are desirable,” This is almost “subliminally” slipped in. You won’t remember where you heard it, but “personal accounts are desirable” will stick in your brain unexamined. ARE personal (not private, of course, personal) accounts desirable? Well no. But you aren’t going to get to see an honest debate about that. You will just “believe “ it when the time comes. Personal accounts are not INSURANCE, which is what Social Security is. A personal account is exactly what the people had before the great depression taught them a lesson that no one alive now remembers very well. The depression taught people that some kind of retirement insurance was necessary to prevent very widespread poverty among people too old to work, or too old to be hired. With a personal account you might get a little richer than you will from the same money put into Social Security, or you might get a lot poorer. There is no reason you can’t have a personal account in addition to your Social Security insurance&#8230; but they don’t want you to think that.</p>
<p>“that doesn&#8217;t mean it makes sense to reject compromises that reduce future liabilities.” But “future liabilities” means “future benefits.” And just what is being compromised? You are saving yourself a forty cent tax increase for the “compromise” of getting benefits cut about 200 dollars a month at a time in your life when that will really hurt, or having two years added to the time you HAVE to work for the boss, even though you paid, or could have paid, for your own retirement. Note that no one is stopping you from working extra years if you want to. SS is insurance. It’s there in case you can’t work longer. Or don’t want to work longer&#8230;. remember, you paid for it. </p>
<p>“ Yet Mr. Gingrich proposes no such changes in his plan, “ Note that “compromises” has become “changes.” Benefit cuts. means testing. work, if you can find work, until you drop.</p>
<p>“ perhaps because they are politically unpopular.”. Yes, it would be a shame if the people were to be allowed to have their opinion heard. Much less be informed about what their choices are. You see, the only way we can save the country is to lie to the people and take away their right to save for their own retirement.</p>
<p>“such an abdication opens him up to charges that he&#8217;s not serious about reform and that he has no plan to pay for the transition costs of going to personal accounts “ Ah, there’s the rub. After the failure of he Bush “personal accounts” plan, the enemies realized they could could kill Social Security without incurring the “costs of transition.” Simply cut benefits, raise the retirement age, impose means testing&#8230; so that the program will no longer work as insurance sufficient to allow people to retire. This would force them to try to beat inflation and the markets on their own&#8230; without &#8220;the government&#8221; incurring any transition cost. A win win&#8230; for the people who hate Social Security.</p>
<p>“that is, when younger workers put their money in their own accounts, rather than funding current retirees.” And here is the father of lies. With Social Security workers already “put their money in their own accounts.” It happens that “pay as you go” DIRECTLY funds “current retirees.” But that doesn’t mean the workers are paying for someone else’s greedy granny. They are paying for their own retirement. Workers who “invest” in stocks and bonds are “funding current retirees”&#8230; who live off stock and bond returns. The only difference is that with Social Security the workers are guaranteed that their own retirement will be paid for when they need it.</p>
<p> The United States of America has more assets than any stock or bond can claim to have. In the case of Social Security the &#8220;asset&#8221; is an infinite supply of new workers who need to save for their own retirement in the only plan that protects their savings from inflation and market losses, and certain kinds of personal misfortune. They no more..or less&#8230; &#8220;pay for&#8221; current retirees than an unending supply of new customers &#8220;pay for&#8221; the retirements of those who own the stocks and bonds issued by a corporatioin.</p>
<p>But you need to think. With SS you pay your insurance premium and a record of that payment is recorded in your name. When you come to retirement, the total of your contributions is automatically adjusted to equal the average growth in the economy, which includes both inflation and real growth in wages. Your benefit is calculated based on your adjusted contribution. It is “paid for” (directly) by the contributions of those still working&#8230; who will get the same good deal you are getting. But while they are “funding” the system, they are not “paying for” current retirees. The current retirees already paid for themselves. Current workers are paying for themselves.</p>
<p>Or they were until the enemies of Social Security came up with the truly brilliant plan of killing Social Security simply by giving the workers their savings back to fritter away. They promise to make up for your lost savings by borrowing the money and taxing the rich&#8230; turning Social Security into welfare as we knew it. Welfare is something they already know how to kill in the dark.</p>
