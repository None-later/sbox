				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I took a couple of days to let life interfere with blogging, but none of the standard politics/economics bloggers seems to have highlighted this note from the Lex column of last Wednesday’s (13 October 2010) FT (again, no link; feel free to provide in comments) under the heading “Defence M&#038;A”:<br />
<blockquote>
<p>Lockheed has two small services businesses on the block. [These] in particular appear vulnerable as Robert Gates, secretary of defence, <em>looks for back-office savings to fund operational spending.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s pretty much a fair description of the reason for the existence of <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1469749" target="_blank">MERS</a>.* If there is an area of the U.S. economy that it <strike>is more corrupt</strike> has poorer incentive-alignment than FIRE, it is Defense Spending.  Mr. Gates’s willingness to encourage that by removing processing controls does not bode well for long-term budgetary value.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>*Well, the other reason, after tax evasion.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Back in the Good Old Days, Leveraged Buyouts (LBOs) all the rage. Not coincidentally, the phrase &#8220;underfunded pension liabilities&#8221; moved into the mainstream.</p>
<p>Long story short: when legislation is finally passed to make the &#8220;underfunded&#8221; portion a thing of the past (you can stop laughing any time), several large companies run by Captains of Industry—think Roger Smith and GM—complained that actually putting that funding on their balance sheet would cost <em>One <strong>Billion</strong> dollars</em> off their market cap.  So they were given twenty (20) years to Make It Right.</p>
<p>And Everyone Lived Happily Ever After.</p>
<p>Apparently, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/20/business/economy/20pension.html?_r=1&#038;hp=&#038;oref=slogin&#038;pagewanted=print">until today</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Stung by outsize investment losses, some of the nation’s biggest companies are pushing Congress to roll back rules requiring them to put more money into their pension funds, <em>just two years after President Bush signed a law meant to strengthen the pension system</em>.</p>
<p>The total value of company pension funds is thought to have fallen by more than $250 billion since last winter. With cash now in short supply for companies, they are asking Congress to <em>excuse them from having to replenish the required amounts</em>.</p>
<p>Lawmakers from both parties seem receptive to the idea, and there was talk of adding a pension relief provision to the broad fiscal stimulus package Congress considered for this week’s lame-duck session. [emphasis mine]</p></blockquote>
<p>The best line, of course, comes from an advocate of the Steal Short, Pauperize Long crowd:<br />
<blockquote>“Congress needs to make the funding less volatile,” said Representative Earl Pomeroy, Democrat of North Dakota, who has long been outspoken on pension issues. “I believe that taking this step will save thousands of jobs without costing the Treasury anything.”</p></blockquote>
<p>I believe in the Easter Bunny, the Tooth Fairy (not the <a href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0091474/">Tom Noonan</a> version), and the Reagan Revolution, too.</p>
