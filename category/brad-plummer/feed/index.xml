Links to a more careful and complete look at the numbers follows:</p>
<p>Brad Plummer at the WaPo discusses two issues with employment and seasonal factors: <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/08/05/wait-the-u-s-economy-actually-lost-1-2-million-jobs-in-july/">Wait, the U.S. economy actually lost 1.2 million jobs in July?</a></p>
<p>Bill McBride at Calculated Risk adds his own analysis and charts in this post&#8230;<a href="http://www.calculatedriskblog.com/2012/08/payroll-employment-and-seasonal-factors.html">Payroll Employment and Seasonal Factors</a></p>
