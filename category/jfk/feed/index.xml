<div>Romney didn&#8217;t apologize for [his] comments, instead he doubled down, saying that his opponent, President Barack Obama, believes in &#8220;redistributing wealth,&#8221; while &#8220;we believe in free people and free enterprise.&#8221;
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Democrats &#8220;believe you have to take from some and give to others. I don&#8217;t believe in that,&#8221; he said, repeating the same theme.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>&#8220;I believe America was built on the principle of government caring for those in need but getting out of the way and allowing free people to pursue their dreams,&#8221; Romney said. &#8220;Free people pursing free enterprises is the only way we&#8217;ll create a strong and growing middle class and the only way we&#8217;ll help people out of poverty.&#8221;
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>&#8212; Mitt Romney, speaking to Neil Cavuto <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2012/09/18/161364378/in-fox-interview-romney-doubles-down-on-47-percent-comments?ft=1&#038;f=1001">on Fox News today</a>
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Yup. That’s right. Dwight Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy, Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, and Bill Clinton didn’t believe in free people and free enterprise. All <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/16/opinion/sunday/do-tax-cuts-lead-to-economic-growth.html?gwh=5E06CD6CBDC4DD462E65D218F4B5A237">presided over</a> redistribution-of-wealth schemes of the sort that Romney warns against. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Which is why George Romney made so little money in the ‘50s and ‘60s and why America’s economy and American society were so awful all those decades after we abandoned freedom of people and free enterprise after 1929, until George W. Bush restored some of our freedom and our free-enterprise system—but not enough of it.  No wonder George Romney left the auto industry for government.  He wanted to make some money!
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>We need to end this redistribution-of-wealth thing completely!  Forever! I don’t see why we have to tax people like Mitt Romney <i>at all</i>. Why does Romney want to reduce their taxes just 20% further?  I demand an answer! Free people pursing free enterprises is the only way we&#8217;ll create a strong and growing middle class.  Which is why we weren’t able to do that between the 1920s and the 2000s!</div>
<div>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Poor Warren Buffett, Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, and others so hampered by our non-free-enterprise system during the decades preceding 2001, toiling under Communist rule and longing for freedom and a non-redistributive economic system.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>&#8212;-
</p>
</div>
<div>Seriously, folks.  If Obama doesn’t remove this straw man from this economic-history savant’s arsenal of parading apparitions by the end of the day tomorrow, I’ll be really frustrated.
</p>
