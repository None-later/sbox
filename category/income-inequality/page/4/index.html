<p>Continuing my <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/05/monetary-policy-im-sorry-its-just-not.html">prior post</a> suggesting that what ever monetary policy has done, it has not reached that vast majority nor has it addressed what is the main issue, I viewed <a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-PPMC1yThA7s/Te2CxHdeVII/AAAAAAAAAok/JpU9l8iU52s/s1600/Figure_1stagnation.bmp">this chart</a> by Mike Kimel and thought: Perfect!<br />Then comes Ken Houghton linking to <a href="http://www.freakonomics.com/2011/06/08/were-halfway-to-a-lost-decade/">this article</a> with it&#8217;s chart. <br />What do they have in common? Income inequality. So let me repost <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2007/12/its-big-one-honey-i-know-it.html">this graph</a> from my 12/2007 post.<br />I&#8217;m only posting the second half of the graph, as that is the one that matters. </p>
<p>
<div><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-g-5O6E53JmA/TfD-FYlVwUI/AAAAAAAAARE/q0txm5D_CnA/s1600/Bottom+99%2525+income+vs+outlays+63+-+05.JPG" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="197px" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-g-5O6E53JmA/TfD-FYlVwUI/AAAAAAAAARE/q0txm5D_CnA/s320/Bottom+99%2525+income+vs+outlays+63+-+05.JPG" t8="true" width="320px"></a></div>
<div>Take a look at 1996. That is the year that personal consumption crossed over the income level of the bottom 99%. It&#8217;s been borrowed money ever since. For an economy that runs on making money from money, that&#8217;s not a problem for those who earn their income by such a manor, is it?</div>
<p><a name="more"></a>
<div></div>
<div>Back to Mike&#8217;s chart. He noted that the change in what type of spending was associated with recessions happened around the early 70&#8217;s. That time is when another major event happened. The rise in productivity disconnected from the rise in wages. That is, any rise in productivity did not produce a corresponding rise in wages as was the historical norm. My position is that this was the start of the &#8220;new&#8221; service economy of making money from money that went into full mode with Reagan. Ok, we went from government spending to private sector spending as the fuel for the economic engine which I agree with Mike is what is the real mechanisms that is behind the results Mike notes Tyler Cowen labeled The Great Stagnation. Mr. Cowen is correct, it&#8217;s a great stagnation, but stagnation has it&#8217;s cause. Regarding both Mike and Mr. Cowen, the shift from government spending to private sector spending being considered the fuel that resulted in stagnation is not the complete answer. The change in the means of spending coincides with the ideology change. We went all Milton and Rand ideologocially. However, the act of spending dollars and the means by which dollars are spent is not the fuel of the engine, it only referrers to the distribution of the fuel. Mike is taking about the distribution system and Mr. Cowen is talking about the results of using that system.</div>
<p>So, what is the real culprit? What is it about the fuel that made us get to where we are today? </p>
<p>We started starving the engine of fuel. And we did it by using a supposedly better fuel distribution system. Instead of moving the money into the engine via the broadest distribution system, we followed an idea that suggested a more focused distribution system would work. It has not worked. It has quite literally starved the engine of fuel. I noted <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2008/12/income-distribution-and-gdp-it-matters.html">this here</a>. <br />To quote that post using the time span of 1933 to 2005: </p>
<p>
<blockquote>For the first 43 years, GDP doubling was always ahead of the income. For the next 32 years, GDP growth was always behind the income which was do to the top 1%&#8217;s share. Their&#8217;s is the only income that increased faster than the economy. In chart form it looks like this:<br />First 43 years doubling: GDP 8.6 yrs, 99%&#8217;ers 10.75 yrs, 1%&#8217;ers 14.3 yrs.<br />Next 32 years doubling: GDP 10.6 yrs, 99%&#8217;ers 11 yrs, 1%&#8217;ers 8 yrs.</p></blockquote>
<p>The first 43 years the share of income to the top 1% was declining to a low in 1976. After that in was increasing.</p>
<p>Ok, now to Mike&#8217;s chart. He stated: <br />
<blockquote>Basically, if you corner enough economists, you might get them to tell you recessions begin if there&#8217;s a big drop in private consumption, private investment, or gov&#8217;t spending.</p></blockquote>
<p>Reading that statement while looking at his chart should be causing fire alarms and sirens to sound. This is because, if &#8220;private consumption&#8221; is an accepted cause of a recession, and the only time such appears to be associated is this current recession in 72 or so years of having recessions, then something has radically changed. If that chart showing that an accepted cause of recession only happened once in recent history, then honey, it&#8217;s the big one.</p>
<p>I think there is no way to deny it. Income inequality is the dinosaur in the room. It is the meteor that hit the earth. It is why all the past solutions theorized and used since the New Deal recovery are not working.   
<div>They can&#8217;t work because they do not address the predicted but never before (recent history) experienced.</div>
<p>So, look at my chart again. It&#8217;s borrowed money that keep the consumption going since 1996 (yeah the supposedly great Clinton year). You do know that the share of income rose faster to the top 1% during his 2 terms than during Reagan, Bush 1 and Bush 2? It was debt combined with &#8220;new products&#8221; designed to pretend people could pay the debt which kept it going. </p>
<p>In terms of numbers: $1,400,000,000,000. That&#8217;s 1.4 trillion dollars every year, year in and year out that the original system had moving through it that is now somewhere in the new system doing nothing as it relates to building a larger, stronger, healthier economic engine. You can&#8217;t cut taxes enough to make up for this. You can&#8217;t distribute enough money via QE to make up for this mostly because QE does not address this at all <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/05/monetary-policy-im-sorry-its-just-not.html">as noted.</a> <br />  <br />Still not convinced with my graph, Mike&#8217;s chart and the chart Ken referred too? Then try this on for size: <em><u>Recent Trends in Household Wealth in the United States: Rising Debt and the Middle-Class Squeeze—an Update to 2007, by Edward N. Wolff, Levy Economics Institute of Bard College</u></em> </p>
<p>March 2010 Page 20 to 22</p>
<blockquote><p>As noted above, the ratio of debt-to-net-worth of the middle three wealth quintiles rose from 37 percent in 1983 to 46 percent in 2001 and then jumped to 61 percent in 2007. Correspondingly, their debt-to-income rose from 67 percent in 1983 to 100 percent in 2001 and then zoomed up to 157 percent in 2007! This new debt took two major forms. First, because housing prices went up over these years, families were able to borrow against the now-enhanced value of their homes by refinancing their mortgages and by taking out home equity loans (lines of credit secured by their home)&#8230;Where did the borrowing go? Some have asserted that it went to invest in stocks. However, if this were the case, then stocks as a share of total assets would have increased over this period, which it did not (it fell from 13 to 7 percent between 2001 and 2007). Moreover, it did not go into other assets&#8230;The question remains whether the consumption financed by the new debt was simply normal consumption or was there a consumption binge (acceleration) during the 2000s emanating from the expanded debt? That is, did the enhanced debt simply sustain usual consumption or did it lead to an expansion of consumption?</p>
<p>The average expenditure of the median income class was virtually unchanged from 1989 to 2001 and also from 2001 to 2007. Thus, the CEX data, like the NIPA data, show no acceleration in consumer spending during the debt splurge of the 2000s. <strong>As a result, it can be concluded that the debt build-up of the 2000s went for normal consumption, not enhanced consumption.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Got that? Let&#8217;s summarize: The share of income to the 99% of people declined from 1976 onward. At the same time the means of making money changed from labor production to money manipulation (producer economy to finanicialized economy) adding to the reduction in share of income. We also changed the ideology to one from relying on the vast population (as represented by the individual and We the People) to relying on a small portion of the population to distribute what money was created. We did this for 33 years. By 1996, people were borrowing as a means to sustain their standard of living (not increase it). If the people are not spending to increase their standard of living, then is the economy really growing? By 2006 people were no longer able to make the payments and consumption was declining.  Then gas hit $4/gal and winter heating was looking like another $4000 to $6000 would be needed.</p>
<p>To date, nothing has been done to address this. Nothing at all. And, by &#8220;this&#8221; I mean, the income inequality that has resulted in an an economy where a very small group of people (top 1%) are taking money out of the system (that is money that would fuel the engine) faster than the engine can make it which results in an ever faster declining share to the rest of the people. Instead, we have refined new fuel and dumped it right into the top 1%&#8217;s hands and wonder why the engine is still sputtering? </p>
<p>One other issue I have with framing and the words used today: <em><u>Under water.</u></em> </p>
<p>People are not under water. They are not drowning in debt. On the contrary, people are dehydrating. They are starving for water. Do you know what the symptoms are of dehydration? You get thirsty and then urinate less to conserve water. (debt spending) Then you stop making tears and stop sweating. (can&#8217;t borrow) Eventually your muscles cramp, the heart palpitates and you get dizzy. (close to bankruptcy, voting against your interest) Let it go long enough and you get confused, weak and your coping mechanisms fail. (Tea Party, etc) In the end, your systems fail and you die. (recession)</p>
<p>People are dehydrating and Washington is doing nothing about it because they believe it is drowning.  They are throwing out life boats to people in a desert.  That is the chart Ken linked to.</p>

<li><a href="http://underbelly-buce.blogspot.com/">Buce</a> has been on fire recently, so I&#8217;ll probably have to do a post about why <a href="http://underbelly-buce.blogspot.com/2011/05/can-taxpayers-thank-eliot-spitzer-for.html">this post</a> is so off-target, though his conclusion is correct (short version: he&#8217;s been misled).</p>
</li>
<li>If I&#8217;m reading this morning&#8217;s <a href="http://www.smartbrief.com/servlet/encodeServlet?issueid=B7FCF69E-7215-4E6D-AC62-53F6A3532773&#038;sid=4da1e808-6b9f-4d1d-bfb8-caea93b4c6d8">SIFMA Brief</a> correctly, Moody&#8217;s—whose rating skills Robert has discussed at length—(1) may downgrade US debt <a href="http://r.smartbrief.com/resp/cVvhCcmoBhBZAweeXXqh">if we spend too much </a>and (2) will downgrade US banks <a href="http://r.smartbrief.com/resp/cVvhCcmoBhBZAweltoih">unless we spend too much on them</a>.  Oh, and the banks object to regulation because it would <a href="http://r.smartbrief.com/resp/cVvhCcmoBhBZAweBelfW">&#8220;artificially&#8221; reduce asset values</a> (presumably, many of the same ones Moody&#8217;s wants protected).
</li>
<li>Relatedly, James Salt (probably h/t Felix) notes that &#8220;generous&#8221; UK banks are <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/jim-saft/2011/06/02/beware-generous-uk-banks/">playing reporting games</a>.  (The US version is to deny the rework and leave the asset marked at unsustainable levels.)
</li>
<li>That <a href="http://holykaw.alltop.com/school-superintendent-requests-school-be-turn">this is spot-on</a> would make me sadder if I thought we still lived in anything resembling a meritocracy, or even a developing economy.
</li>
<li>If we needed further evidence of that, the state with the best secondary eduction system in the country is pushing forward with <a href="http://schoolfinance101.wordpress.com/2011/06/03/the-offensively-defensive-ideology-of-charter-schooling/">privatize-the-gains</a>.
</li>
<li>I&#8217;m more and more convinced that China &#8220;is different,&#8221; but very much not certain the differences will make an ultimate difference.  Daniel Gross <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/blogs/daily-ticker/bear-china-shop-163217166.html">is inclined to think not</a>.  More on this as I finally finish my review of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Boombustology-Spotting-Financial-Bubbles-Before/dp/0470879467/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&#038;s=books&#038;qid=1305207274&#038;sr=1-1"><em>BoomBustOlogy</em></a>, which you should expect to see some time before the apocalypse.
</li>
<li>I assume everyone has already seen <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/group/scspi/cgi-bin/facts.php">this</a>.  Just in case, <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/group/scspi/cgi-bin/facts.php">check out the facts</a>, stylised or not.
</li>
<li>Oh, and Felix is wrong <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2011/05/31/the-stocks-housing-disconnect/">here</a>.  But that&#8217;s a post that will probably never be written by me.  Someone else want to send it in?</li>

<div>Stock market is up, Profits are up and banks are safe. So what? Unemployment is somewhere between going down and I can&#8217;t get no satisfaction. Housing values <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/US/05/14/falling.home.prices/">are still falling</a>.  </div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><p>A new nationwide survey from real estate Web site Zillow.com says the value of U.S. homes fell 3% from January 1 to March 30 &#8212; the steepest quarterly decline since 2008.</p></blockquote>
<div> </div>
<div>I know, I&#8217;m suppose to care. Bigger picture and all. But frankly, when I read comments such as that by <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/05/euro-area-is-miserable.html#comments">Mark Sadowski&#8217;s</a>: </div>
<div> </div>
<blockquote><p>Since Bernanke&#8217;s Jackson Hole speech the steep rise in stock prices has increased household wealth by some $5 trillion. The rise in inflation expectations has helped to ease the household debt deflation problem. Consumption has been the bright story in the BEA numbers last two quarters,&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>I just get all “A vineyard? Really?” Now I know Rebecca&#8217;s post is about looking for some indication that things are better though tipsy and Mark is responding that with: No, things are rather solid in the “we&#8217;re moving forward” category. </div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>I&#8217;m going to be bold here and state right out that I&#8217;m speaking for the middle-class. (Those of this class can correct me if I&#8217;m wrong.) Five trillion dollar in new stock market wealth is not reaching us. I&#8217;m happy for you all that are now more wealthy, but really, you&#8217;re only a small percentage of the population and thus your success is not representative of how well We the People in total are doing.</div>
<p><a name="more"></a>
<div>Before I go further, let us do a little simple math (for you stat manipulators, the key word: simple. Add more complication as you wish in comments.) I am allowed to do this, keep it simple because I&#8217;m not an economist. Or am I? </div>
<div></div>
<div>Let&#8217;s say <a href="http://www.levyinstitute.org/pubs/wp_589.pdf">that 81.2% of all stock</a> is owned by the top 10% of wealth gatherers. (table 9). Let&#8217;s say there was 100 shares at $1 each for a total value in stock on 8/31/10 of $100. That $100 became $129.80 by 5/2/11.(S&#038;P closing numbers)  But, I&#8217;m going to round off all of this to keep it really simple. 100 shares. 80 shares owned by 10 people. 20 shares owned by 90 people. Fast forward 9 months and now the $100 is $120. Still 100 shares. (We&#8217;re excluding splits, initial offerings and anything else that would increase the number of shares, simple.) </div>
<div></div>
<div>So, 10 people now have a total worth of $96. The 90 people are splitting up $24. Both saw a 20% rise. Hooray! But here&#8217;s the issue, an additional $1.60 will do a lot more than an additional $0.04. The issue is coin in the pocket. For the middle-class, it&#8217;s just not happening.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Let&#8217;s add a some more fun facts to this Yahoo party.  <a href="http://www.levyinstitute.org/pubs/wp_589.pdf"> I used:</a>  <strong>Recent Trends in Household Wealth in the United States: Rising Debt and the Middle-Class Squeeze—an Update to 2007</strong> by Edward N. Wolff, Levy Economics Institute of Bard College, March 2010</div>
<div> 
<div>As of 2007, 38% of all households have stock via pensions and of that group it represents 31.4 % of all stock. (Table 14b, 14c) Unfortunately, the middle 3 quintiles 65.1% of their assets are their house, 12.9% is pension, 3.6% is stock held in some form. Darn few of the middle-class have any stock at all and what they have is tied up. </div>
<div></div>
<div>So again, that 29.8% rise&#8230; ain&#8217;t feeling it. I ain&#8217;t feeling it in customers in my shop. I ain&#8217;t feeling it in volume of sales in my shop. I ain&#8217;t feeling it in dollar&#8217;s per sale in my shop. Guess what I ain&#8217;t gonna do? I ain&#8217;t gonna hire anyone. </div>
<div></div>
<div>Let me leave you with this. Let&#8217;s say we manage to move 5 more people into the group that has 80% of the stock for a total of 15 people. They each have $5.333.  (Finance likes to measure as if they are using micrometers.) The remaining 85 have $0.235. The 85 have 5.9% more wealth to start. 9 months later, the 15 people have $6.40 each. They have $1.067 more. The 85 have $0.282. </div>
<div></div>
<div>Certainly $0.047 more to those in the 85 group is not going to make them go out and buy flowers. However, 5 more people have more than a buck to spend and in my shop that buys one carnation that will last 2 to 3 weeks.  As I noted before, buying that flower for one&#8217;s self has <a href="http://generallythinking.com/positivepsychology/flowers-happiness-the-emotional-impact-of-plants-external/">major positive benefits</a> for one&#8217;s personality. I have a better shot at selling that 1 carnation when there are 15 people that could purchase it than when there are 10. That mean&#8217;s there is a better chance that there will be one more happy person and thus push the consumer confidence index up. <br />That my middle-class friends, is the power of policy designed to promote income and wealth equality vs just wealth increases.  I want me some of that there policy.  </div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>A vineyard. Really?</div>

<p>In earlier posts on ataxingmatter (<a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2011/04/robert-reichs-after-shock.html" target="_blank" _mce_href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2011/04/robert-reichs-after-shock.html">here</a> and <a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2011/04/robert-reichs-after-shock-prescriptions-for-the-cure-1.html">here</a>), I reviewed Robert Reich&#8217;s 2010 book, <em>After Shock</em>, and wrote about his suggested cures for the problems made most visible in the 2007 crash and the Great Depression that followed.</p>
<p>The gist of the book is summed up in the following quote:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;[L]eft to its own devices, the market concentrates wealth and income&#8211;which is<br />disastrous to an economy as well as to a society.&#8221; at 59</p></blockquote>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Corey Robin writes in the Nation about the same problem, <a href="http://www.thenation.com/article/159748/reclaiming-politics-freedom">Reclaiming the Politics of Freedom, The Nation</a>, Apr. 26, 2011. But he notes that harping on the distributional inequality doesn&#8217;t resonate with voters. If the left wants to influence policies and capture the hearts of voters, he suggests, it needs to demonstrate that this distributional mayhem, which leaves everybody but the rich vulnerable, has even broader consequences that reach to the very fundamental creation myths of our society&#8211;the desire to be our own masters, to free ourselves from a tyrannical monarchy and colonial overlords who seemed to want to dictate how we could work, what we could drink, and where we could live. That is, to make what we are saying comprehensible at the &#8220;yeah, that&#8217;s what counts for me&#8221; level, we need to connect to America&#8217;s own Founding Moment. We need to &#8220;reclaim[] the politics of freedom.&#8221;</p>
<p>And I think he is correct. Because the problem we are facing today, with corporate lobbying and campaign contributions reinforcing the elite class&#8217;s wining and dining of politicians, is more than the dysfunction of the economy. Yes, there is too much money at the top where there is not enough ability to spend it. Yes, there is too little money at the bottom where there is no way to provide for basic needs. Yes, there is barely enough in the middle, resulting in stagnation in local businesses who don&#8217;t have enough customers to sell to and can&#8217;t afford to give credit to those who want to buy. </p>
<p>It is not just that banks, connected to power through their managers and shareholders, are able to speculate with other people&#8217;s money (our money!) in the international derivatives casino and then push their losses off on us. It is not just that corporate bosses rake in as much in a day as many of their workers make in an entire year of hard labor. It is not just that we can no longer talk to anybody local when there is a problem with our phone or our order from a company. It is not just that ordinary people are ignored, disregarded, almost shunned, because the elite really are only comfortable in the company of other elites. It is not just that we can&#8217;t get an appointment with a doctor unless we have (expensive) health insurance, or can&#8217;t get that crown we need on the broken tooth because it costs as much as some of us make in half a year.</p>
<p>No. These things are real, they affect us every day, they make us angry every day because we recognize our powerlessness to deal with the highly impersonal Big Business world that has been fostered by the four decades of reaganomics&#8217; deregulation, privatization, tax cuts and militarization. But still, the problem goes much deeper than these things. </p>
<p>Our very freedom is threatened. When we are economically powerless, we are also powerless in our lives because we lose our freedom to make choices that are right for us. </p>
<ul>
<li>we lose our rights to bargain with our employers (look at how Wisconsin and Ohio have treated their public employees or how WalMart treats its workers and anyone who talks unions), </li>
<p>
<li>we lose the power to improve ourselves by pulling ourselves up by the bootstraps through publicly funded education from grade school through university, </li>
<p>
<li>we are dominated in the marketplace by powerful businesses that use automated systems to turn us off, ignore our calls and letters seeking redress for a mischarge or a poorly done job,</li>
<p>
<li>we lose our jobs, are forced to accept paycuts or furloughs, when the company claims times are tought, yet we watch the same public companies to pay their CEOs millions more </li>
</ul>
<p>Our freedom to improve ourselves, freedom to choose the kind of work we want to do, freedom to prepare for our retirement and then retire with some security about our future, freedom from worry about whether or not a catastrophic medical emergency will eat up all our savings and leave family without an adequate living&#8211;all these freedoms are being threatened today by the concentration of wealth in the hands of an elite few who thereby become emplowered to set the market terms as they choose. </p>
<p>The idea of the &#8220;free market&#8221; is a bill of goods sold to replace the real concepts of freedom we should be considering. Markets, of course, can only function well for the people where government constraints prevent the owners and managers from setting all the terms to suit themselves, leaving externalities of their profitmaking to be borne by the people. literally ripping them off. The sloganeers have persuaded ordinary Americans to think that the American Dream of freedom is encapsulated in that little bitty notion of a &#8220;free market&#8221; so that they will unknowingly throw away the big idea of freedom&#8211;the freedom to set one&#8217;s own course in life, in a cooperative society that works to provide those tools.</p>
<p>The reason we need a progressive tax policy&#8211;including at the least progressive tax rates with brackets that reach much higher into the stratosphers of the ultra rich (55% for those making $1 million or more annually) ; elimination of the capital gains preference (so that all income is taxed under the same rate structure); and an estate tax with bite (meaning a graduated rate that protects a reasonable nest egg for the next generation while serving as one method of limiting the concentration of wealth)&#8211; is to ensure the freedom of each and every one of us, from rich to poor, from newly arrived immigrant to elderly Native American.</p>

<p><strong>Wiggle Room</strong></p>
<p>In a claustrophobic economy where the lions share of the fruit of citizens’ efforts is funneled to a small number of beneficiaries, where institutions intended to intervene on their behalf have been rejigged to work backwards, what can the little guy do to gain some wiggle room?</p>
<p>The poorest Americans have many strategies that provide small amounts of wiggle room, like working off-the-books, juggling  several bank accounts or using payday lenders, locking kids in a closet so they can go to work, and stiffing landlords and various debtors when and as they can.  Some are chosen strategies, some are just the result of not having enough tokens to satisfy all the turnstiles.</p>
<p>And these skills are ancient.  Being dirt poor is a venerable world sport, and the tactics have been practiced since before written records.</p>
<p>But in the past century we seem to have entered a new situation, where the great majority of people are in a closed system with very little wiggle room, and most wiggle choices leading to less, not greater freedom and prosperity.<br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>The bumper sticker used to say, “If you are not angry, you’re not paying attention.”  But now it should read “If you are not claustrophobic, you don’t understand the situation.”</p>
<p>In my city, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-chat/1035089/posts">a man went missing</a> a few years ago, and was finally found dead in a basement space behind a false wall – a space that was narrower at the bottom than the top.  He hadn’t been shot or stabbed – in fact, he had fallen prey to his own efforts to escape.  Every wiggle wedged him lower, and made it harder for him to breathe, until he suffocated.</p>
<p>The great question facing ordinary Americans is not how to find further wiggle strategies, to make do with less, to work harder to try to tread water under increasing burdens.  That way lies less freedom.</p>
<p>In a way, Americans do understand this.  Otherwise, why would they have disdain for the model of the immigrant many Americans scorn?   – living ten to a room, on rice and beans, sleeping in shifts to make use of scarce bedspace, and all for wages that a babysitter would refuse?  Americans scorn these living arrangements, but that’s where they’re heading.</p>
<p>And many of the wiggle strategies in use even 80 years ago (raising chickens, cutting firewood for heat) are impossible now.  Urging the majority to do more with less, (“austerity”) while the 1% do less with far more, is not the solution.  But what is?</p>
<p>Going Galt isn’t an option.  The poor are their own hostages, and dropping out of the labour market in large numbers is what’s happening now, anyway.  But would it be possible to move into the “rice and beans” model while concurrently building solid economic walls to provide breathing space and room for more effective wiggling?</p>
<p>Could the model of the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beghards_and_Beguines">Beguines</a> show us a direction?</p>

<p>King Abdullah&#8217;s move comes after thousands of Jordanians took to the streets — inspired by the regime ouster in Tunisia and the turmoil in Egypt — and called for the resignation of Prime Minister Samir Rifai who is blamed for a rise in fuel and <a target="_blank" href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/f/food_prices/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier">food prices</a> and slowed political reforms. </p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="http://econospeak.blogspot.com/2011/01/whither-egypt.html">Barkley Rosser</a> offers a take off point for the international aspects of the Egyptian turmoil, and a <a target="_blank" href="http://econospeak.blogspot.com/2011/01/political-economic-basis-of-egyptian.html">beginning look</a> at the history of the politics/economics of the nation.</p>
<blockquote><p>Yesterday, Juan Cole posted on  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.juancole.com/2011/01/egypts-class-conflict.html">Class Conflict in Egypt</a>. As usual, very insightful on the poltical economic foundations of this uprising. He argues that the original base of support for the Nasserist regime that took over in a coup in 1952 was rural land reform, with the rural middle class that got land still the base of the regime. However, over time with urbanization and slow growth and the rise of corruption since Mubarak took over, that base has eroded. <br /><a name="more"></a><br />Nasser also gained credibility for throwing out the British and standing up to other outsiders (with the US and Soviets ironically siding with him in the 1956 Suez Crisis against the UK, France, and Israel).</p>
<p>Real wages doubled between 1960 and 1970, when Nasser died, but stagnated after that until 2000, with nearly zero real per capita income growth and a worsening income distribution. Neo-liberal policies, including relaxation of food price controls in the 1990s, did not produce much, although growth did increase after 2000, running at a 5-6% rate. But it has not been enough to provide jobs for the many urban youth, particularly the better educated ones.</p>
<p>Also, since 1980 the regime has been seen as supported by outsiders, particularly the US, Israel, Britain, and France, in contrast to the Nasser period. As economic problems surged with the food price spikes in 2008 and the subsequent Great Recession in the world economy, this made for a weak foundation of support for the regime. We should expect any successor to take a more independent line, especially the moderate El-Baradei who was so badly treated by the US previously. </p>
<p>I must note, however, that while inequality has increased, it is not all that bad compared to many other countries, with Egypt&#8217;s current Gini coefficient of 34.0 putting it in 90th place in terms of inequality in the world.</p>
<p>Finally, I note that the chances for Mohamed El-Baradei succeeding Mubarak (eventually anyway) have increased with him receiving the support of the Ikhwan, the Muslim Brotherhood. However, there are other more radical Islamist groups in Egypt calling for an Islamist state with Shari&#8217;a imposed as law, although they appear to be a minority on that side, even though they are more moderate than the expelled Egyptian Islamic Jihad, whose leaders include the #2 and #3 figures in al-Qaeda.</p></blockquote>

                                <p><strong>Tom Walker</strong><br />(aka Sandwichman at <a href="http://ecologicalheadstand.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Ecological Headstand</a>)</p>
<p><strong>Modeling Sunshine and Shadows: Inequality, long hours and crisis</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://fistfulofeuros.net/afoe/economics-and-demography/sunshine-at-the-imf-of-all-places/" target="_blank">Alex Harrowell at A Fistful of Euros</a> sees sunshine beaming from the IMF in a working paper by Michael Kumhof and Romain Rancière that identifies income inequality as a potential source of financial crisis. No shit, Sherlock! Outside of the formal modeling, the proposition hardly sounds remarkable.</p>
<p>As goldilocksisableachblonde noted on <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2010/12/sunshine-at-the-imf-of-all-places.html" target="_blank">Mark Thoma&#8217;s site</a>, &#8220;This finding is consistent with intuition and common sense , meaning &#8211; according to mainstream economic theory backed by models and more models &#8211; it&#8217;s gotta be wrong.&#8221; Kumhof and Rancière themselves note that &#8220;the link between income inequality, household indebtedness and crises has been recently discussed&#8230;&#8221; but they object that the authors &#8220;do not make a formally consistent case for that argument.&#8221; What they mean by not &#8220;formally consistent&#8221; is presumably not using a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model such as they employ. I would like to see K&#038;R try that argument in court.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your honor, sir, I object, the videotape of my client breaking open the ATM with a sledgehammer is not a DSGE model and thus is not formally consistent as evidence.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Objection overruled.&#8221;</p>
<p>But it is well that K&#038;R build their formally consistent model to demonstrate that possibility of something happening, which the rest of us can observe with our naked eyes. This will keep other formally-consistent DSGE model builders busy tinkering with assumptions until they can explain the findings away. I betcha Lee Ohanian could come up with a doozy &#8212; and it would get more media!</p>
<p>Anyway, where there is sunshine, there are bound to be shadows and the Sandwichman couldn&#8217;t resist the temptation of scouring the working paper for some shade. And here it is:<br /><a name="more"></a><br />
<blockquote>&#8220;Finally, the addition of a shock to workers’ labor supply would help to address an important issue raised by Reich (2010), who emphasizes that in the United States households faced with higher income inequality have employed two other important coping mechanism apart from higher borrowing, namely higher female labor force participation and longer hours. This allowed them to replace some of the lost income, and therefore to limit the amount of additional borrowing.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Now I haven&#8217;t read Bob Reich&#8217;s new book but I did the next best thing. I saw him talk about it at a book tour event in Point Reyes Station in October. Reich&#8217;s argument is that 1. incomes have stagnated since the early 1980s 2. the first response of households was to increase hours supplied to the labor market to maintain purchasing power but when that strategy ran up against its limit, 3. households began to borrow aggressively. I think Reich has the ingredients right but they&#8217;re in the wrong chronological order. That can be crucial when you&#8217;re baking a cake or explaining history. Long before incomes began to stagnate, hours of work ceased a century long trend of decline, a trend that BLS economist Joseph Zeisel had called &#8220;one of the most persistent and significant trends in the American economy in the past century.&#8221;</p>
<p>Not to put too blunt a point on it, Americans suddenly stopped taking part of the gains of technology in the form of leisure. It&#8217;s not as if they &#8220;just decided&#8221; to do this, either. There were all sorts of structural changes in the U.S. labor market that broke the trend. Just to name a few, there was the abandonment of the shorter hours employment strategy by organized labor in favor of promoting economic growth fueled by government spending, there was the explosion of per-employee benefits (quasi-fixed costs) as a proportion of total compensation and there was the FLSA provisions themselves which, in effect, were a double-edged sword with regard to the incentive of overtime pay.</p>
<p>From a long-term historical perspective, hours of work stagnated before wages did. I&#8217;m well aware of the <i>post hoc propter hoc</i> fallacy. Just because the hours stagnation came first, doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean it caused the wage stagnation. On the other hand, there is a sufficient body of theory suggesting that just such a causal chain is likely.</p>
<p>Ira Steward articulated this theory in the 1860s. Marx also presented a theoretical explanation linking technological advance, immiseration of workers and economic crisis. Sydney J. Chapman confirmed the basis of Steward&#8217;s and Marx&#8217;s theories but within a neo-classical framework. Dorothy W. Douglas reviewed Steward&#8217;s theory during the Depression judged it to be rich in explanatory power, institutionally speaking.</p>
<p>More recently Keynes and Luigi Pasinetti advanced theories that none of the formally-consistent model builders have sought to confirm or refute. Instead, the formally-consistent model builders busied themselves refuting a theory that didn&#8217;t exist &#8212; that &#8220;the amount of work to be done was a fixed quantity.&#8221; Not surprisingly, they succeeded in refuting that faux fallacy (in a formally-consistent manner, of course) and figured that was all they needed to do. Steward, Marx, Chapman, Keynes and Pasinetti be damned!</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong. I think formally modeling realistic assumptions is a huge step forward from formally modeling laughable ones. I&#8217;m just not sure I (or the unemployed) can wait another sixty years or so for economists to get around to building a formally-consistent model that reflects the powerful explanatory theories the formal modelers have ignored for the last sixty years.</p>

It is also related to concpts determining trade policies:</p>
<blockquote><p>None of these countries significantly increased the share of GDP going to government transfers. What happened is that some nations did more than others to pass the fruits of economic growth on to the poor.
</p>
<p>Trickle down via transfers occurs in various ways. In some countries pensions, unemployment compensation, and related benefits are indexed to average wages, so they tend to rise automatically as the economy grows. Increases in other transfers, such as social assistance, require periodic policy updates. The same is true of tax reductions for low-income households.</p>
<p>Should we bemoan the fact that employment and earnings aren’t the key trickle-down mechanism?</p>

                                <p>by Bruce Webb</p>
<p>As I browsed through the news today it kind of struck me, not like a lightning bolt but more as an accumulation of blows, that capital was going for the final victory over labor. It was not just the realization that the corporatists and their enablers in both parties were willing to accept 9% plus unemployment long-term but offer no relief at all to the 99ers, but equally willing to accept an investment climate where employers simply will not hire even if they are sitting on piles of cash, because after all who knows and why should any individual employer take the first jump. But this article pushed me over the edge: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/07/30/AR2010073005722.html?hpid=moreheadlines">Employers shrink pay raises, focus increases more on top performers</a><br />
<blockquote>In other cases, employers can afford raises but are holding off to conserve cash in case the economy slips into another recession. They also are recognizing that they don&#8217;t have to offer pre-downturn-level raises because of an abundance of unemployed job applicants willing to work for less.</p>
<p>&#8220;The companies have the money to pay but they don&#8217;t need to pay it because the supply [of highly qualified unemployed people] is still there,&#8221; said Tim Namie, managing director of Manpower Professional&#8217;s Washington region.</p>
<p>Employers, Namie added, &#8220;are willing to roll the dice&#8221; that because of the tight job market, meager raises won&#8217;t prompt good workers to quit. And if the workers do leave, he said, employers figure they can find replacements willing to work for lower wages.</p></blockquote>
<p> Gone is even any pretense that wages are somehow magically tied to &#8220;marginal productivity&#8221;, nope we are reverting right back to 19th century industrial standards where labor is simply replaceable. Don&#8217;t want a job that barely pays now? Well screw you, we&#8217;ll just hire a homeless 99&#8217;er at 10% less, after all it will allow him to pay for a couple of months in a rooming house. These sons-a-bitches are betting they can roll the dice and have it come up &#8216;1888&#8217;. Well a funny thing happened in those years right before the turn of the 19th century when the Gilded Age was truly golden and Robber Barons were building mansions and founding Colleges, a certain segment of labor decided they weren&#8217;t going to take it anymore, and things got kind of messy for the capitalists. And a few decades later we had the following ballad going around: (lyrics under the fold).<br /><a name="more"></a><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://randompottins.blogspot.com/2005/11/ballad-of-joe-hill.html">RandomPottins: blog of Charlie Pottins of the UK: Ballad of Joe Hill</a><br />
<blockquote>On November 19, 1915, as working men were being sent to slaughter each other for rival imperial powers, working class hero and songwriter Joe Hill was executed by firing squad in the state of Utah.</p>
<p>In 1925, Alfred Hayes wrote a poem about Joe Hill entitled &#8220;I Dreamed I Saw Joe Hill Last Night&#8221;, but sometimes just called &#8220;Joe Hill&#8221;. Hayes&#8217;s lyrics were turned into a song in 1936 by Earl Robinson.<br />It has been sung by Paul Robeson and Pete Seeger, and by the Irish singer Luke Kelly. Probably the best known version today was sung and recorded by Joan Baez in 1969, and featured in the film by Joe&#8217;s fellow-Swede Bo Widerborg in 1971. Bob Dylan has said that Joe Hill&#8217;s story helped inspire him to write his own songs.</p>
<p>But the lyrics as sung have sometimes varied, as the ballad was passed down over the years, sung at benefit concerts, and meetings, around campfires or in pubs.</p>
<p>I dreamed I saw Joe Hill last night,<br />Alive as you and me.<br />Says I &#8220;But Joe, you&#8217;re ten years dead&#8221;<br />&#8220;I never died&#8221; said he,<br />&#8220;I never died&#8221; said he.<br />&#8220;In Salt Lake, Joe,&#8221; says I to him,<br />him standing by my bed,<br />&#8220;They framed you on a murder charge,&#8221;<br />Says Joe, &#8220;But I ain&#8217;t dead,&#8221;<br />Says Joe, &#8220;But I ain&#8217;t dead.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Copper Bosses killed you Joe,<br />they shot you Joe&#8221; says I.<br />&#8220;Takes more than guns to kill a man&#8221;<br />Says Joe &#8220;I didn&#8217;t die&#8221;<br />Says Joe &#8220;I didn&#8217;t die&#8221;</p>
<p>And standing there as big as life<br />and smiling with his eyes.<br />Says Joe &#8220;What they can never kill<br />went on to organize,<br />went on to organize&#8221;</p>
<p>From San Diego up to Maine,<br />in every mine and mill,<br />where workers fight,<br />to defend their rights,<br />That&#8217;s where you find Joe Hill,<br />it&#8217;s there you find Joe Hill!</p>
<p>I dreamed I saw Joe Hill last night,<br />alive as you and me.<br />Says I &#8220;But Joe, you&#8217;re ten years dead&#8221;<br />&#8220;I never died&#8221; said he,<br />&#8220;I never died&#8221; said he.</p></blockquote>
<p>I am not a revolutionary, but on the other hand I am not here to turn my back on the IWW (Wobblies) or Harry Bridges who as head of the ILA (Longshoremen) led the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.calisphere.universityofcalifornia.edu/themed_collections/subtopic4d.html">1934 San Francisco General Strike</a>. The New Deal overall can be seen as the result of a Great Compromise, Labor agreeing to maintain a system fundamentally based on and controlled by Capital in return for a fair share of resultant productivity. And with fits and turns that compromise and deal held up for 50 years. Until in the 1980s Capital decided that with a determined effort they could just roll back the clock a hundred years and tell labor to stuff it, to work or starve.</p>
<p>I mean it is one thing to tolerate high levels of unemployment, it is another to deliberately set out to exploit it in the way outlined by that WaPo article today. Which btw proceeded, without any apparent indignation, to point out that local workers in the DC area had it relatively easy, those workers outside the military-intelligence-national security sectors not even getting Beltway and Wall Street wage increases.</p>
<p>Look no one wants to see violence in the streets, but history shows that it is not only the capitalists that have 2nd amendment remedies. Joe Hill may have more life in him than they like.</p>

                                <p>No, not that anyone should <a href="http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/37216290/ns/today-today_people/">pay her $15,000-$30,000 to talk to teenagers about why they should be abstinent</a>. (Short version: &#8220;As with my mother, I wasn&#8217;t, and look what I&#8217;m doing now. Uh, well&#8230;&#8221;)</p>
<p>But, <a href="http://capitalgainsandgames.com/blog/andrew-samwick/1731/divorce-and-upward-mobility">via Andrew Samwick</a>, <a href="http://economicmobility.org/assets/pdfs/Family_Structure.pdf">a study from the Pew Foundation</a> (PDF) using PSID data finds that:<br />
<blockquote>Among children who start in the bottom third of the income distribution,<br />only 26 percent with divorced parents move up to the middle or top third<br />as adults, compared to 42 percent of children born to unmarried mothers<br />and 50 percent of children with continuously married parents.</p></blockquote>
<p>Or, in ratio terms, it is only 19% more likely that the child&#8217;s eventual economic status will be improved if the mother marries someone and stays married until the child is eighteen, compared to a 61.5% improvement in the expected well-being of the child if the mother remains unmarried for the entire eighteen years.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, twice as many children have parents who divorce before the child is nineteen (14%) than are raised by unwed mothers (7%).</p>
<p>There may also be elements of selection bias in the data: a woman who opts to raise a child on her own instead of getting married is more likely to instill that independence of spirit in her child than someone who enters into what turns out to be a bad marriage.</p>
<p>The other interesting table in the study shows how severely income inequality increased across a generation.
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/S_QoXm2XCTI/AAAAAAAAAa0/vl401TBrvqE/s1600/mobilitytable1.JPG"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/S_QoXm2XCTI/AAAAAAAAAa0/vl401TBrvqE/s400/mobilitytable1.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Note that the bottom tier improves the least, that the 50th percentile grows much slower than even the 75th, and that the percentage change in the Mean is greater than the percentage change at any tier except the 90th percentile.</p>
<p>So much for the rising tide having lifted all boats—clearly, it capsized a few.</p>
