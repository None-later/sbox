                                <p>The Rude Pundit Has a Brilliant Suggestion. OWS didn&#8217;t expect to be in Zucotti Park for more than two months.  It looks as if they&#8217;ll be there a lot longer.</p>
<blockquote><p>UPDATE: Michael Swanwick <a href="http://floggingbabel.blogspot.com/2011/10/boo.html">shows how easy it can be</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s Halloween!  So Marianne and I went down to City Hall to donate  a case of water, a box of granola bars, and some M&#038;Ms (for the seasonality) to the Occupy Philadelphia people.</p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>This presents some issues; that summer sleeping bag <a href="http://rudepundit.blogspot.com/2011/10/lets-actually-do-something-blanket.html">isn&#8217;t really adequate for NYC winters</a>:<br /><a name="more"></a><br />
<blockquote>[W]inter&#8217;s coming, fast up here in the Northeast. And while the Rude Pundit is convinced that the true flourishing of the Occupy movement will occur next spring (and into the awful summer and awfuller fall of an election year), there&#8217;s a core of the protesters who are gonna stay, no matter what.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what the Rude Pundit proposes, an action in the spirit of OWS:</p>
<p>On Friday, November 25, the day after Thanksgiving, Black Friday, the biggest shopping day of the year, as marketers force us to know, let&#8217;s give to our local Occupy encampments what they need to stay warm for the winter.</p>
<p>The deal: check out your local Occupy website. There&#8217;s <a href="http://occupywallst.org/article/urgent-winter-donation-needs/">a list</a> of all the <a href="http://www.occupybuffalo.org/donate/">things</a> they <a href="http://occupychi.org/supplies-needed">need</a> in <a href="http://occupynashville.org/">order</a> to flat out survive into the <a href="http://occupysf.com/get-involved/donate/donation-list-up-to-date">Spring</a>. [links to NY, Buffalo, Chicago, Nashville, and SF lists in original]</p></blockquote>
<p>Having shoveled snow this weekend—and knowing people in NJ, MA, and CT who are without power, and (especially in MA) don&#8217;t expect to have it back until the weekend at least—my only concern with this plan is that 25 November may be late.
<p></p>
<blockquote><p>Speaking of marketing, we could call this &#8220;Blanket the Earth.&#8221; We could organize this on, say, a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Blanket-the-Earth/222529267813542?skip_nax_wizard=true#%21/pages/Blanket-the-Earth/222529267813542?sk=wall">Facebook</a> page or perhaps a <a href="http://twitter.com/#%21/blankettheearth">Twitter</a> feed or a hastag.</p></blockquote>

<p>crony capitalism and casino capitalism&#8211;bad flavors for right or left, per Kristof and Stiglitz</p>
<p>The Occupy Wall Street focus on &#8220;we are the 99 percent&#8221; juxtaposed with the CBO&#8217;s recent report on the growing inequality in America (see <a href="http://cbo.gov/doc.cfm?index=12485">here</a>) come at a time when the American right is pushing hard for policies, like Perry&#8217;s so-called &#8220;Flat Tax&#8221; and Cain&#8217;s so-called &#8220;FairTax&#8221;, that will exacerbate that inequality in a winner-take-all economic system that rewards the speculators and fat cats to the detriment of ordinary society.  Hopefully those first two items will cause ordinary folk to think twice before supporting that exacerbating trend on the right.  The right likes to disguise them as &#8216;folksy&#8217; &#8216;down-home&#8217; populism.  They aren&#8217;t.  They are wolves disguised in sheep&#8217;s clothing.</p>
<p> <a name="more"></a>
<p>In <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/27/opinion/kristof-crony-capitalism-comes-homes.html">Crony Capitalism Comes Home</a>, New York Times (Oct. 26, 2011), Nicholas Kristof notes the &#8220;alarmist view&#8221; of Occupy Wall Street rampant among the media and the elitist critics of the movement&#8211;one that sees the protesters as &#8220;half-naked Communists aiming to bring down the American economic system&#8221; or &#8220;a &#8216;mob&#8217; trying to overthow capitalism.&#8221;  He rightly responds that it is instead a movement that &#8220;highlights the need to restore basic capitalist principles like accountability.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>[I]n recent years, some financiers have chosen to live in a government-backed featherbed. Their platform seems to be socialism for tycoons and capitalism for the rest of us.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The American critique of the Asian crisis was correct. The countries involved were nominally capitalist but needed major reforms to create accountability and competitive markets.  Something similar is true today of the United States.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Capitalism is so successful an economic system partly because of an internal discipline that allows for loss and even bankruptcy. It’s the possibility of failure that creates the opportunity for triumph. Yet many of America’s major banks are too big to fail, so they can privatize profits while socializing risk.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>[Mohamed El-Erian, chief executive of Pimco] told me that the economic system needs to move toward “inclusive capitalism” and embrace broad-based job creation while curbing excessive inequality.  “You cannot be a good house in a rapidly deteriorating neighborhood,” he told me. “The credibility and the fair functioning of the neighborhood matter a great deal. Without that, the integrity of the capitalist system will weaken further.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p> <!-- more -->
<p>Kristof and El-Erian are correct. </p>
<p><strong>The movement in the US over the last few decades has made crony capitalism possible by pretending that abstract economic theories about &#8220;free markets&#8221; developed by Milt Friedman and his Chicago boys and based on unreal assumptions about human behavior should not only be consulted for setting fiscal policy but are the &#8220;God&#8217;s Truth&#8221; bible from which such policies should be derived.  This has led to the capture of the markets by big money</strong>.  Swarms of lobbyists for Big Oil/ Insurance/ Banks/ Pharma draft the laws that apply to their industries then work with the agencies to draft favorable interpretations into the regulations and then use powerful firms funded by business coalitions like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, National Association of Manufacturers or supported by &#8220;business-funded so-called &#8216;think tanks&#8217; to exploit the courts (packed by the right in the four decades since Reagan) to push industry favorable policies no matter the &#8216;externalities&#8217;  for people&#8217;s lives, the environment, other priorities, and individual freedoms.</p>
<p>Crony capitalism doesn&#8217;t hold capitalists accountable for what they do.  We put minimal if any restraints (tax law, anti-trust law, patent  law) on business monopolization and business consolidation and business ability to use the power of money to influence the work of legislators, executives and courts.  We allow private equity funds that buy, fire, and sell at great profits to themselves but at great cost to communities, not just in jobs lost, but also in abandoned buildings left to be handled at the taxpayers&#8217; expense and polluted waterways, ground and air left to be cleaned (if at all) at taxpayers&#8217; expense.  Wal-Mart moves from one address to another across the street and a short hop down the road, because it gets a new tax rebate from the county over the line and leaves behind the community that gave it a tax rebate for the first store, without ever providing the financial benefits the rebate was intended to buy and leaving behind the pollution, waste and destruction of an empty shell megabuilding (real life anecdote from Champaign, Illinois).</p>
<p><strong>Crony capitalism results in excessive inequality </strong>(witness the way the managers and owners have accrued all the productivity gains of the last decade) and <strong>excessive inequality furthers crony capitalism</strong>.</p>
<blockquote><p>[Lawrence Katz, a Harvard economist, says that] excessive inequality can have two perverse consequences: first, the very wealthy lobby for favors, contracts and bailouts that distort markets; and, second, growing inequality undermines the ability of the poorest to invest in their own education.  &#8220;These factors mean that high inequality can generate further high inequality and eventually poor economic growth.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is very similar to what Joseph Stiglitz has been telling us for some time.  In his 2010 book, Freefall, Stiglitz recognized that America&#8217;s economic crisis stemmed in part from unfounded faith in Econ 101.  :</p>
<blockquote><p>Modern economics, with its faith in free markets and globalisation, had promised prosperity for all. The much-touted New Economy – the amazing innovations that marked the latter half of the 20th century, including deregulation and financial engineering – was supposed to enable better risk management, bringing with it the end of the business cycle. If the combination of the New Economy and modern economics had not eliminated economic fluctuations, at least it was taming them. Or so we were told.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>The Great Recession – clearly the worst downturn since the Great Depression 75 years earlier – has shattered these illusions.  (This and the following excerpts are from the extract of his book, <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/7061058/Joseph-Stiglitz-Why-we-have-to-change-capitalism.html">Why we have to change capitalism</a>, The Telegraph)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Saying that does not make anyone &#8220;against capitalism&#8221;.  It just means that we must open our eyes to understand the potential that unfettered capitalism has for highly negative destruction.  As Stiglitz says, &#8220;markets lie at the heart of every successful economy but &#8230; [they] do not work well on their own.&#8221;  We have to let government work to correct the imbalances that otherwise result from unfettered capitalism&#8211;especially the kinds of imbalances that start to grow when casino capitalism is let loose by socializiation of losses and privatization of gains resulting in enormous inequality within the society.</p>
<blockquote><p>Economies need a balance between the role of markets and the role of government – with important contributions by non-market and non-governmental institutions. In the last 25 years, America lost that balance, and it pushed its unbalanced perspective on countries around the world.  The current crisis has uncovered fundamental flaws in the capitalist system, or at least the peculiar version of capitalism that emerged in the latter part of the 20th century in the US.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>[A] closer look at the US economy suggests that there are some deeper problems [than just the ones resulting from our current financial crisis and recession]: a society where even those in the middle have seen incomes stagnate for a decade, a society marked by increasing inequality; a country where, though there are dramatic exceptions, the statistical chances of a poor American making it to the top are lower than in &#8220;Old Europe.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Stiglitz concludes, as many of us have, that this crisis should be taken as an opportunity to ask what kind of society we would like to have and to make the changes necessary to ensure that we are on the right path.</p>
<blockquote><p>We have gone far down an alternative path – creating a society in which materialism dominates moral commitment, in which the rapid growth that we have achieved is not sustainable environmentally or socially, in which we do not act together as a community to address our common needs, partly because rugged individualism and market fundamentalism have eroded any sense of community and have led to rampant exploitation of unwary and unprotected individuals and to an increasing social divide.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The model of rugged individualism combined with market fundamentalism has altered not just how individuals think of themselves and their preferences but how they relate to each other. In a world of rugged individualism, there is little need for community and no need for trust. Government is a hindrance; it is the problem, not the solution.</p>
<p>But if externalities and market failures are pervasive, there is a need for collective action, and voluntary arrangements will typically not suffice.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The government plays an important role in restraining the &#8220;dark angels&#8221; of capitalism and allowing the &#8220;good angels&#8221; to operate for the benefit of society.  Without government as an enforcer of accountability and trust, some version of crony capitalism and its brute-force harm to those who lose out in the struggle for wealthy is inevitable.  </p>
<blockquote><p>This crisis has exposed fissures in our society, between Wall Street and Main Street, between America&#8217;s rich and the rest of our society. While the top has been doing very well over the last three decades, incomes of most Americans have stagnated or fallen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We need to keep this in mind, as we deal with the myriad proposals coming from the right to continue the trend of unfettered markets, crony capitalism and winner-take-all policies.  Deregulation for Big Banks/Oil/Pharma et al will not create jobs, tax cuts for the wealthy will not unleash broad-based growth, and larger inflows of lobbyists [see, e.g., Eggen &#038; Farnam, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/lobbyists-playing-key-role-in-2012-fundraising/2011/10/24/gIQAUg0GMM_story.html">Lobbyists playing key role in 2012 fundraising</a>, Wash. Post (Oct. 27, 2011)] into even our political decisionmaking processes made possible by the Citizens United case will not provide ever more &#8220;free speech&#8221; for everyone.  These are excesses of brute-force capitalism exercised in a plutarchy, not evidence of a sustainable democracy. </p>
<p>The answer is what might be called &#8220;mitigated capitalism&#8221;&#8211;an economy that can benefit from the incentive power of capitalism, but that limits and restrains its excesses through reasonable social welfare programs and safety nets for those that are left behind in one way or another, strong emphasis on providing public education and other systems that allow individuals to take advantage of opportunities to advance themselves, and strong enforcement of laws that protect the public commons (natural resources, air, water, land, and the public square) for the public.  The progressive income tax&#8211;a system that taxes every person on their income from whatever source (capital or labor)&#8211;and the estate tax&#8211;a system that redresses the inability of the tax system to capture the appreciation of capital resources during a person&#8217;s lifetime&#8211;are key ingredients of the tax answer to preventing crony/brute-force capitalism&#8217;s sway.</p>

<p>No, no, no.</p>
<p>The &#8220;hard hats&#8221; have been brutalized <em>much more than</em> &#8220;the rest of us&#8221; in this economy.  And the economy before that.

<p>I&#8217;ve been writing about the relationship between tax rates and growth since I started blogging in 2006. A lot of those posts have focused on the quadratic relationship between tax rates and growth. That is, it turns out that if you take US data going back to when the BEA started keeping track, 1929, you can easily build a model of the following form:</p>
<p>% change in real GDP from t to t+1 = a + b*Top Marginal Tax Rate at time t<br />+ c* Top Marginal Tax Rate squared at time t </p>
<p>I have modestly referred to that as the Kimel curve. Now, it turns out that for most variations on that theme I&#8217;ve come up with, b is positive, c is negative, and both are significant at the 5% or 10% level. That allows you to find a top marginal tax rate that maximizes growth&#8230; which turns out to be somewhere between 60% and 70% depending on how the model is specified.</p>
<p>In this post I want to address a few criticisms by running two additional regressions with more or less the form. Parts of this may get a bit wonky but I&#8217;m going to keep it so that even if you&#8217;ve never done any statistical analysis, hopefully you&#8217;ll be able to follow the outcomes.</p>
<p>In the first regression, I&#8217;m going to account for a few additional facts:<br />1. By going with every single observation the BEA produces, I&#8217;ve been accused of &#8220;cherry picking.&#8221; So I&#8217;m going to throw in a dummy variable for Hoover. <br />2. I&#8217;ve been told the only reason growth was so quick during the New Deal was that there was a bounceback effect from the Great Depression&#8230; so I&#8217;m throwing in a dummy variable for FDR&#8217;s peacetime years (i.e., 33-41).<br />3. I&#8217;ve been told WW2 biases the results&#8230;. so there&#8217;s a third dummy for 1942-1944, the fast growing years in WW2. <br />4. I&#8217;ve also included two demographic variables: the percentage of Americans 35 to 44 and the percentage of Americans 45 &#8211; 54. The latter group tends to be the highest income group these days, but in an earlier era more focused on manual labor, those 35 to 44 might have been higher paid. <br />5. For grins, I threw in a dummy variable which is equal to 1 if the President is a Republican and 0 otherwise. </p>
<p>So&#8230; here&#8217;s what it looks like:
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-rOgMAImqGFw/Tqh1Mcp8S3I/AAAAAAAAAoU/xtQwc6aeAw8/s1600/figure%2B1%2B-%2Bkitchen%2Bsink.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-rOgMAImqGFw/Tqh1Mcp8S3I/AAAAAAAAAoU/xtQwc6aeAw8/s320/figure%2B1%2B-%2Bkitchen%2Bsink.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>So what does it all mean? Well, this set of variables explains about 43% of the observed variation in growth rates over the period for which we have data (see the adjusted R2). There&#8217;s obviously room to improve the model, variables I&#8217;m not accounting for, etc.</p>
<p>The percentage of Americans 35 to 44 has a positive coefficient and is almost significant at 10%. We&#8217;re almost at the point where we&#8217;d be comfortable saying as that percentage increases, growth increases. The percentage of Americans 45 &#8211; 54 has a negative coefficient, but isn&#8217;t close to being significant. </p>
<p>Not surprisingly, the Hoover dummy is associated with economic shrinkage, FDR&#8217;s peacetime period is associated with positive growth, and 1942 &#8211; 1944 is associated with even faster economic growth.</p>
<p>The Republican dummy is not significant &#8211; any difference in the growth rate observed between the two parties can be explained by other factors. Which other factors?</p>
<p>Well, the top marginal tax rate and the top marginal tax rate squared are both significant &#8211; the former is positive and the latter is negative, which means they trace out the desired upside-down-U shape. </p>
<p>Oh&#8230; and the top of the curve happens when tax rates are at 64%. That is, the fastest growth rates seem to occur when the top marginal tax rate is around 64%. Now, I&#8217;ve had post after post on this topic, and the top of the curve always seems to occur in more or less in the same place. It isn&#8217;t a coincidence folks. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ll post results of the second regression in my next post in the series. That regression will focus on the period since Reagan took office and thus will only include data from 1981 to the present. What does it say? Well, a hint: if you don&#8217;t like the results shown in this post, you won&#8217;t be happy about that one either. But remember, I&#8217;m just the messenger. The data is what the data is, and if it isn&#8217;t showing what you think it should, its up to you figure out what&#8217;s wrong with the analysis or with the data, to pontificate wisely and inaccurately, to ignore the evidence, or to change your mind. </p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>If anyone has a line on a good inequality series with annual data that goes back to 1929, please let me know. I&#8217;d like to drop it into the model. I&#8217;d also love a good proxy for regulation. Don&#8217;t be afraid to offer other suggestions for data to drop into the mix are welcome too. I&#8217;m like a DJ, I take requests, but it helps if you can point to whatever data you want me to use. </p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>As always, if you want my spreadsheets drop me a line at &#8220;mike&#8221; period &#8220;kimel&#8221; (note &#8211; one m only in my last name!!!!) at gmail.com.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>Thanks to Bill McBride for pointing toward the demographic data and m. jed for suggesting its use.</p>

                                <p>Elaine Kamarck wrote an article in The Washington Monthly&#8217;s blog &#8220;Ten Miles Square&#8221; entitled <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/ten-miles-square/2011/09/no_time_to_go_wobbly_on_welfar032288.php#">&#8220;NO Time to Go Wobbly on Welfare Reform&#8221;</a></p>
<p>Briefly for those who have not clicked the link, the article stresses that TANF (aka welfare) is a very small component of the social welfare safety net (as was AFDC before welfare reform). Kamarck argues that one would not have such a negative view of welfare reform if one considered the whole poverty assistance system. She presents data on the poverty rate and discusses its change over time. Then mixing political strategy and policy analysis, she argues that it would be very politically costly for Democrats to question welfare reform.</p>
<p>I agree entirely with the first claim, which is not related to the rest of the article (which discusses policy not politics and reality not the median voters&#8217; perception of reality).</p>
<p>The article contains factual errors. They are not minor.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>1) Kamarck shows a graph of total EITC and AFDC/TANF benefits and writes &#8220;As the following chart illustrates, spending on the EITC took off just as welfare reform was adopted.&#8221; This claim is false. As the graph shows, spending on the EITC took off in 1993 following the passage of the Clinton recovery bill (tax increase for rich people, .7 cent a gallon gas tax and massive expansion of the EITC). This was three years before the welfare reform bill signed in 1996. Kamarck asserts 1993=1996. In fact 1993<br />2) Kamarck writes &#8220;the welfare rolls, which, by supporting mothers only if they weren’t working and weren’t married.&#8221; In fact in 1996 (and earlier) some married women and some employed women received AFDC benefits. In 1996 AFDC was available to married couples with children (subject to availability for work rules) in 25 states. It is just not true that only unmarried women received AFDC (it is true that few married couples with children were poor enough to qualify but that is a fact about income distribution and not about the program in those 25 states). Also AFDC was available to women who worked but had very low incomes (benefits would be zero for someone who worked year round full time for the minimum wage). IIRC the effective marginal tax rate was around 70%. However, for Kamarck&#8217;s claim to be true, it would have to be infinite at labour income =0. </p>
<p>Now both of Karmack&#8217;s claims about AFDC are uncontroversial &#8212; they are something which everyone thinks he or she knows. They are also false. I think they should be corrected.</p>
<p>In addition to the two very important (central to the article) errors of fact mentioned above, Kamarck makes very serious errors of omission. She notes that Clinton vetoed an earlier welfare reform bill which converted food stamps to a block grant. She neglects to mention that the bill he signed massively cut food stamps. The projected savings from the bill were overwhelmingly due to the food stamps cuts not the transition from AFDC to TANF. </p>
<p>I suspect (just a guess not a claim) that the actual ex post cuts in the 90s were more than 100% due to the cuts in food stamps &#8212; the AFDC was an entitlement without a fixed budget so spending would have fallen during the late 90s boom. The federal TANF contribution is a block grant which does not depend on how many people are needy so it didn&#8217;t fall in the 90s. I guess that in the first years after welfare reform TANF cost the Federal Government more than AFDC would have cost.</p>
<p>But the cuts to the food stamps program were severe dwarfing the cuts to AFDC/TANF spending. </p>
<p>It is not at all possible to evaluate the effect of welfare reform on the poor by looking at the poverty rate. For one thing food stamps are not counted as income in the calculation of the poverty rate. The program and the massive cuts in 1996 just don&#8217;t appear in the headline data on poverty.</p>
<p>Much more importantly, neither TANF nor AFDC is designed to reduce the poverty rate. AFDC and TANF benefits are not high enough to bring income over the poverty line. The purpose of the programs is to prevent severe poverty while keeping the long long term unemployed poor so that they have an incentive to seek work. </p>
<p>The poverty rate is just one statistic which gives us some information about poverty. It would be the whole story only if a household with income one cent before the poverty line suffered as much as a household with 0 income. To find possible costs due to welfare reform, one has to consider the distribution of income among households below the poverty line. One easily available statistic is the severe poverty rate (also called the deep poverty rate) the fraction of people in households with income below half the poverty line. </p>
<p>Data on severe poverty rate only go back to 1975. The current level is the highest on record. The ratio of the severe poverty rate to the poverty rate has increased since welfare was reformed. The sever poverty rate and this ratio are useful if one wishes to determine whether welfare reform may have hurt the poor by making them severely poor and not just poor. Kamarck considers only the poverty rate. This is a serious conceptual error.</p>
<p>I believe that her article contains false claims of fact which should be corrected and that it makes a contribution to the discussion of no value whatsoever.</p>

                                <p> By Daniel Becker
<div>This is a bit of an interlude in my writing regarding the income tax of yore. Though, this does involve taxation. This is also a continuation in my postings regarding real world small business experiences. Yes, you are going to get to read about a real situation that involves a real small business and tax policy.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Before I mislead anyone, the taxes of concern are not about income taxation. Your business has to actually have an income for that tax to matter. I&#8217;m not talking personal income. I&#8217;m not talking capital gains taxes. Darn few honest to goodness small businesses ever have to worry about that in their daily activities. Maybe in the end you will have some capital gains after you pay yourself back all the personal money you put into your small business. I&#8217;m not talking payroll taxes cuts. Yeah, on what was a $100,000 payroll you gain maybe a couple thousand dollars, but on what was a ½ million business that is now 55% of what it was with payroll adjusted to match, it means little. I mean, that business is sure going to be hiring new people with that!</div>
<div></div>
<div> Oh, just in case you think I&#8217;m off the mark, consider <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/145946/small-businesses-hiring-fewer-workers-needed.aspx">this poll from 11/10</a>.   In the poll, 90% hired what was needed or fewer than needed. The catch: Only 1% hired because of the a new tax break. 41% were to replace an employee. When asked why they hired fewer than needed: 79% worried that sales or revenue would not justify more employees. However, 13% did hire because business was better. The lucky ones. So go ahead, keep giving me tax cuts, blah, blah, blah and all that monetary relief because that US Chamber of Commerce sure represents my thoughts and desires. NOT! Idiots!</div>
<div></div>
<div>Some perspective <a href="http://web.sba.gov/faqs/faqindex.cfm?areaID=24">on small business.</a> </div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><p>“In 2009,there were 27.5 million businesses in the United States, according to Office of Advocacy estimates.The lastest available Census data show that there were 6.0 million firms with employees in 2007 and 21.4 million without employees in 2008. “</p></blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>I know it is soothing to croon over the days when the Dodge Brothers, Ford, Colt, Walton and Gates were small and became major examples for their time of the American Dream of economic power. But really, the truth is most small business were and are people earning a living on their own vs working for Microsoft (the definition of part time abuse) or Walmart or GM, or GE or Boeing&#8230; They were huge numbers of small local retail. All gone. Small local banks? Going. Small local agriculture (RI used to have a state fair), forget about it.  Look around.</div>
<div></div>
<div>So lets get to the heart of it. First a bright spot. The flower shop had it&#8217;s first month this year that was better than last year. August. No, I&#8217;m not assuming this is a trend and here is why.</div>
<p><a name="more"></a>
<div>The city of Woonsocket has lost it&#8217;s Walmart to the town of North Smithfield, it&#8217;s neighbor. Major tax hit to the city. N. Smithfield got the Walmart because it decided that building a 650K sq ft shopping development would offset their rising taxes. I mean really, when in the last 30 years have we seen big business pay enough in taxes such that they actually were paying for their presence? Cut, cut, cut has been their chant. So, I can expect my property and inventory taxes to rise unless something replaces that Walmart. Say the state stepping up. Which tends to happen via the state giving less to the towns like North Smithfield.</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>I wrote about this type of tax chasing in <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2007/03/divorced-one-like-bush-on-property.html">one of my first posts</a>. </div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><p>“You know what is missing in this discussion (a discussion happening in every town USA)? The question: Compared to what? What are we basing the above statements on? Is it simply that we have less money after the bills are paid? Well, from 1955 to 1998, GDP rose by a factor of 20. Tax burden as a percent of income rose by a factor of 26.7. But income for a family of 4, 2 people working (sound familiar) only rose by a factor of 11.5. From 1976 to 2001 the top 1 % share of income went from 8.6 % to 21%. Yes, we have less money at the end of the day. Unfortunately, not benefiting from the national wealth as we had in 1955 (when the tax burden was 18% of your pay and would be today if all was equal) is a national policy issue.”</p></blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>This is the issue of small business. See, we are all just trying to earn an income. Just like the person who works for the multinational. The income is much less because business sales are down. So, how should I plan for the pending tax rise? Do not just give me an answer that involves further big business moving into the area, because as I showed in the post on property taxes and development, it&#8217;s not so simple as welcoming Mr and Mrs. big business into the neighborhood. </div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><p>“But, for my purposes Smithfield (an abutting town) presented the most interesting data. They had a new retail development go in, but ½ the size of that proposed for my town. It&#8217;s citizens have seen since 1999 in sequence a 9.8, 4, re-val, 5.5 and 8.7 percent rise in the tax rate. It&#8217;s commercial development has been only 10% industrial. My town only had a 6.4% total rise in the same time span.”</p></blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>Oh save me great god of the mega corporations from the evils of local taxation. Yeah, I didn&#8217;t think praying would work.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Next up involves a CVS move. CVS is headquartered in Woonsocket. It obviously has some new hot shot who has a better way. They are looking to own their stores and not lease. They are consolidating 2 stores into one bigger store on new property. Yes, about ½ the property was zoned commercial, the other ½ was residential (real houses on it) turned commercial. This is important, because the CVS consolidation will leave 2 existing commercial spaces empty. We&#8217;ll add them to the Walmart space and potentially the Lowe&#8217;s space as it is suppose to be moving to the new North Smithfield development which is built on what was 126 acres of woods. </div>
<div></div>
<div>Sticking with Woonsocket, the location of my flower shop, the city has managed to add to its commercial property stock while turning a good portion of it into none productive commercial property stock. How soon do you think those empty places will fill up? Don&#8217;t hold your breath.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Some more good news. I managed to cut a major expense for the shop just this June to the tune of $379/month. We were in a unique position in that they kind of needed us. It&#8217;s not going to happen again. $4548 per year. Nice. It&#8217;s the heating expense for a year assuming the speculators don&#8217;t get active again. Yep, get rid of those government regulations as they sure are doing me harm. NOT!</div>
<div></div>
<div>The plaza that one of the CVS stores is moving out of is a customer of ours. We do seasonal decorating for them. It is about $3900/yr. Well, we&#8217;re not decorating with mums this fall and Christmas looks to be out too. How much you wanna bet spring next year and for some years to come is out? Gonna bet enough to do Washington a favor and higher someone?</div>
<div></div>
<div>Are you seeing where all this is going? I saved us some big coin. I&#8217;m loosing the same amount. Now, this is not the first hit from a CVS decision. Some other person there decided to make it simple for them to pay for their flower needs by going with Pro Flowers instead of feeding the 4 local florists which they had done for decades. They think they are getting a 20% discount from Pro Flowers. Little  </div>
<div>do they understand the flower business. Not the first time mega corps thought they new more than the little guy. It represented about 2.4% of our business at the time. May not sound like a lot, but when you consider the extra business generated by CVS using one&#8217;s shop to send flowers, it becomes significant. </div>
<div></div>
<div>Let&#8217;s add a third issue. Refi. Time to take advantage of the low rates. The purpose is to improve, that is reduce your monthly cash outlays. But as any real small businesses owner learns, there is no such thing as a fixed rate. We have paid off 22.2% of the loan that combined the original purchase of the business and property with the rehab that needed to be done in 2004. We have about 36% of the tax appraised value in equity of the property. </div>
<div></div>
<div>Here&#8217;s the concern, do you take a 20 yr loan with a rate of between 5 to 5.5% to be reset in 5 years or do you take 6 to 6.5% to be reset in 10 yrs? Do I bet that in 5 years business is better because the economy is better which could also mean all that projected inflation do to the Fed monetary policy and at least protect my self for 10 yrs? Or do I bet that nothing will be much better and try to preserve my cash flow (in a small business it&#8217;s always about cash flow, accrual be damn) and go for the 5% figuring the Fed money flood won&#8217;t roost for at least another 5 yrs? Oh, the refi cost are going to run you about $4000. There goes that big saving from my hard nosed negotiations again. </div>
<div></div>
<div>Your facing tax increases beyond the usual but, not because the public employees are paid too much. Your running out of area&#8217;s to cut. Major corporation moves are working against you just as off shoring is working against the middle class, the very class of your concern as you are in it and draw your income from it. And all the policy talk being pushed has little to do with the issues that you are facing because the number one issue you are facing is <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/01/i-got-your-real-state-of-union-right.html">a lack of a middle class</a>. </div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>Have you heard of the “hourglass strategy”? Look it up. Ah, no it&#8217;s not a strategy you can use, but is one that will work against you.</div>

<div>A while ago (an understatement) I posted on the question of what is rich. The <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2009/04/define-rich.html">first dealt</a> with what issues to consider in defining rich. The <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2009/05/define-rich-part-ii-rat-race-and.html">second</a> was looking at the issue of getting rich if that is even what one wants to do. The “rat race”. I don&#8217;t believe most people really want to be rich. I believe most people when thinking about being rich are thinking about what it would take to remove the fears of events that would make one&#8217;s life either very difficult in a world that requires money to remove risk or drastically different from what one&#8217;s life was. I&#8217;m thinking things like losing a job, debilitating injury or illness possibly resulting in physical disability or Louis Winthorpe III. </div>
<div></div>
<div>This all ties into “The American Dream”. The “Dream” is not just an ideology of governance and social philosophy. It is also a life style and thus requires a specific level of income. I have posted on this issue also and noted just how high in income we have driven this “Dream” such that two people with bachelor’s degrees just starting life together may not be able to have it. </div>
<div></div>
<div>Now that we have entered a period where taxes are on everyone&#8217;s minds such that there is serious consensus to raising taxes, maybe we need to see what we had in the past to know what we need now. I am sure most readers are aware of Mike&#8217;s work defining what rates appear to effect economic growth the best. If I recall correctly the number for the top 1% was around 65%. I have also suggested that there is a range as to how large a share of the income the top 1% should have. That number for the top 1% is not to be above 15% and not to much below 10%. </div>
<div></div>
<div>I should also <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/01/opus-1-discussion-on-taxation.html">mention my postings</a> on <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2008/01/opus-1-second-movement-on-taxation.html">taxation’s purpose</a>. Specifically I looked at taxing from the perspective of the legal profession as oppose to the economic profession. The conclusion was that there was one main reason for taxing. It is to fulfill the directive of our constitution: equality of power. It is to assure the concept of one voice one vote. If there was ever a time in our history to raise taxes in order to assure this directive it is now in the age of the Citizens United ruling. President FDR referred to the issue and those with the one voice multiple votes do to their monied power as “economic royalty”. I like that phrase and I wonder why it is not used as are retort to those who use “class warfare” as a guilt trip.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Let&#8217;s get started.</div>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />I have constructed 4 sets of data using the tax rates of 1936/37, 1945/46, 1965/67 and 2010. I chose 1936 because it is a tax rate increase after the economy had turned north based on Mikes posting. I chose 1945/46 because it is another adjustment that happens right after after WWII. I chose 1965/67 because it is the decrease often spoken of fondly. Of course 2010 is because that is where we are at. 
<div></div>
<div>This posting would be hugely long if I post on all 4 periods at once, so I have broken it up. Let me first and I think most importantly note that we people today have no idea just how much we were willing to tax ourselves to have the society that we now refer to as “the good old days”. Not only did we have the tax tables of 1936, that table eventually had a 10% surcharge added to pay for the war. Yes, another reason to consider the generation that fought the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> world wars the greatest generation. There was a 7% surcharge for the Vietnam war, though that number became less as time passed. Still, we knew that if we wanted to do exceptional things, we had to tax ourselves exceptionally. Also, the early taxation made no distinction for single or married, never mind filing joint or separate. Everyone paid the same rate. Most interestingly, with the current table, the people who comparatively get screwed are those who are married and file separately. All the rates kick in at a lower income than even those who are single. The other thing we don&#8217;t seem to understand is that all the tax rhetoric we have been hearing since Reagan <a href="http://taxhistory.tax.org/www/website.nsf/Web/THM1901?OpenDocument">we&#8217;ve heard before virtually to the word.</a></div>
<div></div>
<div>Andrew Mellon, Treasury Secretary 1921 to 1932 :</div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><div>Generally speaking, Mellon argued that tax burdens were too high. Steep rates, he insisted, served only to stifle incentive and foster tax evasion. “Any man of energy and initiative in this country can get what he wants out of life,” he wrote. <em>“But when initiative is crippled by legislation or by a tax system which denies him the right to receive a reasonable share of his earnings, then he will no longer exert himself and the country will be deprived of the energy on which its continued greatness depends.”</em></div>
<div></div>
<div>Worse yet, Mellon argued, high rates didn’t even raise money. By encouraging both legal tax avoidance and illegal tax evasion, they eroded the tax base and reduced overall revenue. <em>Lower rates, he said, would actually raise money by spurring economic growth and reducing the incentive for tax avoidance. “It seems difficult for some to understand,” he complained, “that high rates of taxation do not necessarily mean large revenue to the government, and that more revenue may actually be obtained by lower rates.”</em> In particular, Mellon insisted that high rates distorted investment decisions, boosting the popularity of tax-free state and local government bonds. Indeed, Mellon made these tax-free bonds a regular target of his reform attempts, but Congress resisted his plans to eliminate them.</div>

<div></div>
<div>Atlas Shrugged wasn&#8217;t even written then!  What we don&#8217;t hear much of are the original concerns and reasoning for progressive taxation. Teddy Roosevelt:</div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><div>1906&#8230;<strong>We should discriminate in the sharpest way between fortunes well-won and fortunes ill-won; between those gained as an incident to performing great services to the community as a whole, and those gained in evil fashion by keeping just within the limits of mere law-honesty.</strong></div>
<div></div>
<div>1907 regarding an income tax:&#8230;while in addition it is a difficult tax to administer in its practical working, and great care would have to be exercised to see that it was not evaded by the very men whom it was most desirable to have taxed, for if so evaded it would, of course, be worse than no tax at all; <strong>as the least desirable of all taxes is the tax which bears heavily upon the honest as compared with the dishonest man. </strong></div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>No advantage comes either to the country as a whole or to the individuals inheriting the money by permitting the transmission in their entirety of the enormous fortunes which would be affected by such a tax; and as an incident to its function of revenue raising, such a tax would help to preserve a measurable equality of opportunity for the people of the generations growing to manhood.</strong> We have not the slightest sympathy with that socialistic idea which would try to put laziness, thriftlessness and inefficiency on a par with industry, thrift and efficiency; which would strive to break up not merely private property, but what is far more important, the home, the chief prop upon which our whole civilization stands. Such a theory, if ever adopted, would mean the ruin of the entire country&#8211;a ruin  which would bear heaviest upon the weakest, upon those least able to shift for themselves.</div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>At this moment, I want to mention corporate taxes. There are lessons to be learned from it&#8217;s history. I think it is a factor in understand more completely the issue Mike is focusing on: taxation and GDP growth. <a href="http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxfacts/displayafact.cfm?Docid=203">Wrap your minds around the fact</a> that from 1936 to 1943 there were 6 years that corporate tax collections were greater than personal income tax collections. 1943 was the best year for this as personal income tax collections were 68.1% of the corporate tax collections. Just one year later it flips to corporate tax collections being 75.3% of personal income tax collections. In 1944 $34,543 million in total for the two taxes was collected vs 1943 $16,062 million in total.  <a href="http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxfacts/displayafact.cfm?Docid=204">In fact, personal income taxes</a> remain in the mid to high 40 percent of total revenue collections from 1944 to present. The corporate share of total revenue peaks in 1943 at 39.8% and declines to hover around the 10% level with a few ventures into the single digits. Most notably 1983 the corporate share was 6.2% and 2009 it was 6.6%. </div>
<div>First up is our current tax table. I used the “married filling jointly” as that would be consistent with the other tables. One big rule of this series of postings: DO NOT concern yourself or me about the deductions that exist. They do not matter for this presentation and for all intent and purposes we can consider the income to have already gone through the deduction calculator and is now ready to have the tax table applied. This is because, these tables only apply to adjusted gross income.</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-lX4293efG5Y/Tl_Efh3ab1I/AAAAAAAAARc/W7X0lIr0Ki0/s1600/2010+Tax+table+Define+Rich+3.JPG" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="211" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-lX4293efG5Y/Tl_Efh3ab1I/AAAAAAAAARc/W7X0lIr0Ki0/s320/2010+Tax+table+Define+Rich+3.JPG" width="320" xaa="true"></a></div>
<div></div>
<div>You will notice that the table is calculated out to $,1,000,000 of income. I did this in order to keep all the tables going to the same income level. The 1936 table actually has rates for incomes up to $8 million. That is $8 million in 1936. (Using my <a href="http://www.measuringworth.com/calculators/compare/">favorite money converter</a> that would be $301,000,000 in unskilled labor or $573,000,000 in GDP/capita.) Going to $1,000,000 in income also allows one to see what happens at the top when the rate no longer rises. </div>
<div></div>
<div>A very important concept to understand is that not every dollar is taxed at the single percentage rate as you go up the income ladder. Thus, there are two columns in my charts. The “Marginal Tax” is the additional money paid at the top of the bracket for the corresponding rate. The “Total tax” is the actual money paid up to that level. It is the “effective rate”. In simple terms, if you are at the 35% level, you  </div>
<div>are not paying 35% on all that you earn. Instead you are paying the amount based on your income being divided up into the number of brackets that exist. For 2010, there are 6 brackets, thus you have six different incomes so to speak. </div>
<div></div>
<div>This is what it looks like as a graph.</div>
<div></div>
<div><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-OCqtKMLzE3A/Tl_Ejt_NFtI/AAAAAAAAARg/bwU8IixjaGc/s1600/2010+Tax+rate+graph+Define+Rich+3.JPG" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-OCqtKMLzE3A/Tl_Ejt_NFtI/AAAAAAAAARg/bwU8IixjaGc/s320/2010+Tax+rate+graph+Define+Rich+3.JPG" width="320" xaa="true"></a></div>
<div></div>
<div>When the rate maxed out, I divided the range to $1 million into even parts so that the tax paid for each additional income level is the same. For the 1945/46 and 1965/67 data sets I converted the net income to 2010 dollars. I used the “unskilled labor” and GDP/cap as those are the 2 factors suggested as being the best for knowing what income equivalents are over time. The 1936 data set is converted to 1967 dollar because the numbers just get crazy. For example, a net income of $3840 is $145,000 in unskilled labor and $275,000 in GDP/cap. Though it is only $60,400 via the CPI. Which doesn&#8217;t say much for today&#8217;s median family income. It also gives us a clue as to just how much money is considered “rich”.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Next posting, I will start presenting the historical data sets. I&#8217;m still thinking about the best way to do it as what is important is the comparison among the data sets.  Maybe post just the data charts and later the graphs or maybe one data set and it&#8217;s graphs at a time.  </div>

<div>Ok some more information to bolster my position that my flower shop being down this year another 4.5% compared to last year (at least the decline is leveling off) is not the results of government debt or too much taxation or banks not lending or unions&#8230; nope, my shop is off because of one thing: Lack of income in the hands of the many and nothing to date has been done to change that.</div>
<div></div>
<div>As noted <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/05/monetary-policy-im-sorry-its-just-not.html">here</a> and<a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/06/monetary-policy-im-not-only-not-feeling.html"> here</a>, monetary policy is not going to cut it.  (Please pray for the Greeks.)   </div>
<div>Or I should say, not cutting it for anyone who earns a penny because someone else had an extra penny to spend beyond their non-discretionary expenditures.  That is, they are at the point of autonomous consumption, but not at the point of offsetting income earned from their cognitive or physical labor with that earned from money.  That means we&#8217;re talking about the bottom 90% of the income earning population.  (The top 10% own 82% of the stock.)</div>

<p>
<div>The first shows just how much of a dive spending has taken.  Considering we&#8217;re a &#8220;consumption economy&#8221;, I don&#8217;t think this bodes well for us.  The second shows how lacking in recovery such spending is compared to prior recession.   </div>
<div></div>
<div>I don&#8217;t know about you, but I don&#8217;t care how much money we pump into the economy at the top, if it doesn&#8217;t get in the hands the bottom 90% of the income earners, there will be no recovery.  It does not matter if the Fed&#8217;s are pumping it in or the Government is doing it via tax reductions because both methods are not putting the majority of the money in the hands of the many.  The Fed article notes that this discretionary spending is &#8220;services&#8221;.  It is 30% of all personal consumption expenditures (PCE).  Non-discretionary is 34% of PCE, that leaves 36% somewhere in the middle?  They state PCE is 70% of all output.  So, 30% of 70% is 21% of all output?  Using $14.7trillion means about 3.09 trillion has taken a 7% hit of $216 billion! ( I readily accept any math corrections in comments)</div>
<div></div>
<div>The author states:  </div>
<blockquote><div>Because consumption accounts for about 70 percent of output, this in turn raises some concern about the future strength of the recovery.</div>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><div>That&#8217;s an understatement!  He hedges some more: Also, households may remain wary about their employment and income prospects, suggesting that they may have lowered their future income expectations.</div>
</blockquote>
<div>Really?  &#8220;May&#8221; is the word one wants to use here? </div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>A <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/the-collapse-in-us-discretionary-spending-2011-7">Mr. Roche</a> is more direct:</div>
<div></div>
<div>The real weakness in this recovery is rooted in the fact that consumer balance sheets are so mangled that they’re spending primarily on non-discretionary items and saving the rest of their incomes to pay down debts.  This is important to understand because policy must be geared in such a way that it does not further hinder the household balance sheet.  And therein lies the problem with a policy such as QE2.  Anything that can potentially cause cost push inflation will only further weaken the household sector and detract from any possible recovery.  In the case of QE2 I think we saw the increased speculation contribute directly to rising commodity prices which ultimately squeezed consumers further and led to the current soft spot in the economy.</div>
<div>BINGO!</div>
<div></div>
<div>Let&#8217;s not stop there.  From Mr. Weisenthal Under &#8220;<a href="http://real-economics.blogspot.com/2011/07/bankruptcy-of-economics.html">Scariest Job&#8217;s Chart Ever</a>&#8221; we get this one on the duration of unemployment.</div>

<div>Which brings me to my posting from 4/2008:<a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2008/04/longest-recession-ever.html"> The longest Recession Ever</a></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>I noted in this post that it took 20 months from the Bush 2 recession for the peak of what I call Person Weeks Unemployed (a multiple of the number of people out and the number of weeks out).  I also noted that Reagan with back to back recessions did not see the peak until 30 months past the first recession.  Almost 3 full years!  He also double the quotient.  </div>
<div></div>
<div>I ended with: </div>
<blockquote><div>Thus, the peak of a recession is in the eye of the beholder. If you&#8217;re a person earning money from labor, a recession these days can last a very long time. This data would suggest that what we are seeing in the Spencer post is not a decreased risk but a lull before the storm. One other thing. It appears the Republicans fail again. As a group they have the longest turn-around to seeing a reduction in lost labor.</div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>There you have it.  You want to fix the economy?  Don&#8217;t follow the conservative ideology.   The Republicans win in delaying recoveries.  Yet, here we are with a &#8220;Democratic&#8221; president using the very language, words, framing of the group that is proven to not know how to create jobs and thus get money in the hands of the many in the shortest amount of time.  Some say the Republicans are doing it this time with intention.  I doubt that, though it is a meme that would make them seem to be the ultimate chess players.  </div>

                                <p>By: Daniel Becker <br />There is some <a href="http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2011/06/budget_cuts.html">new information</a> from Adam Hersh of Center for American Progress showing what has happened in the states that have followed the conservative economic approach (yes, talking to you Obama, DLC, Clintonites).  Keep cutting at your own risk.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the thing.  Like the Wile E Coyote, we seem to have run off the cliff.  Our feet are still moving like we are running because we have not noticed we are off the cliff.   Or I should say those in the lofty parts of our power house and economy have not noticed.   Now, in cartoons, sometimes the charater makes the realization and can scramble back to safety at the edge of the cliff.  However,  Wile E never did get it and always fell.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not interested in being taken down by Senator, Represenative, President, Chairman Wile E Coyote.  No thank you.  I know we&#8217;re off the cliff as do the vast majority of not only the USA but it seems the rest of the 1st world nations.  So listen up Wile E.  We&#8217;re not following you any more ( I hear you Greek patrons).  Not going to try to catch that road runner your way anymore.   And here is why:</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />
<blockquote>Relative to national economic trends, states that increased spending enjoyed on average: <br />0.2 percentage point decrease in the unemployment rate <br />1.4 percent increase in private employment <br />0.5 percent real economic growth since the start of the recession. </p>
<p>In contrast, states that cut spending saw on average:<br />1 percentage point increase in the unemployment rate <br />2.1 percent loss of private employment <br />2.9 percent real economic contraction relative to the national economic trend.</p></blockquote>
<p>So, I hope the IMF is happy now.  I have to be honest, the study does note: <br />
<blockquote>The three figures presented in the accompanying charts demonstrate that steep state government spending cuts have gone hand-in-hand with rising unemployment, falling private-sector payroll employment, and lower real growth in states&#8217; gross domestic product, or GDP—the sum of all goods and services produced by labor and equipment in each state, minus imports. <em>The analysis, however, does not tell us whether the spending cuts caused the negative economic outcomes.</em> <strong>But in all three cases, steep spending cuts are statistically associated with markedly worse economic performance.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>There are some nice charts at the linked article if you are more visual.  Personally, I feel this new info just further supports <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/06/monetary-policy-im-not-only-not-feeling.html">my position</a> that people are not drowning (debt is not money and thus not water), they are dehydrating.  We need more of the water that already exists.  It&#8217;s the income inequality issue.  I am rather certain that more government cutting has no chance, zero chance of reversing the inequality.  </p>
<p>If we can&#8217;t reverse the inequality, then we&#8217;re going to continue with what <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2008/12/income-distribution-and-gdp-it-matters.html">I pointed out in 2008</a>.  That is, the top is taking money from the economy as income faster than the economy can produce it.  Can you keep spending more than you make?  No, is the conservative answer.  Well, can you keep taking it faster than you can produce it?  No, is the liberal/progressive answer.  </p>
<p>The issue is not that we are spending too much via government because the government is not just another player in the economy.  As I have noted, as long as the government acts counter to the players in the economy and does so in a manor that assures equality and the reduction of risk in living, it is not a competitor.  It does not &#8220;crowd out&#8221; the private sector.  </p>
<p>This leaves the real issue of a stalling economy, and declining living security one of  to much money being taken out of the economy.  For decades as noted, one group has been taking too much money out of the economy and have been doing it at ever increasing rates: the top 1%.  They are doing it faster than the economy can produce it.  This, as far as I am concerned is no different than government cutting spending.  Either way, money is taken out.  Velocity is what we are talking; how much and how fast money is moving through the economy.   Of course to understand such, one has to appreciate that Wall Street, banks, and markets are not an economy.  This is why the government, acting to fulfill it&#8217;s prime purpose of equality of power is never a competitior in the economy.</p>
<p>So, how convienent the conservative issue is debt.  Too much of it they say.  Too much spending.  HA!  The real debt is in the lack of income to everyone other than those in the top 1%.  They took and are taking so much money out of the system in the form of income (decrease union membership, tax cuts, off shoring, financialization, consolidation) that they have damaged the machine which allowed them to have growing income.  This is the real debt.  It is the lack of economic growth.  And the rich have caused it.  Yet there solution is to cut government spending and further reduce the amount of money in the active (remember velocity) part of the economy all the while taking even more out as income in their pockets?</p>
<p>Do you see how nuts Wile E Coyote is?<br /> </p>
