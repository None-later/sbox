<blockquote><a href="http://www.homepages.ucl.ac.uk/~uctpjrt/">Orazio Attanasio</a> (University College London, Department of Economics), <a href="http://www.chicagobooth.edu/faculty/bio.aspx?person_id=12825092096">Erik Hurst</a> (University of Chicago, Booth School of Business) &#038; <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/~pista/">Luigi Pistaferri</a> (Stanford University, Department of Economics), <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2035781">The Evolution of Income, Consumption, and Leisure Inequality in the US, 1980-2010</a> (<a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w17982">NBER</a>):</p>
<p><em>Recent research has documented that income inequality in the United States has increased dramatically over the prior three decades. There has been less of a consensus, however, on whether the increase in income inequality was matched by an equally large increase in consumption inequality. Most researchers have studied this question using data from the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CE)</em></p>
<p><em>&#8230;</em><br /><em> </em></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><em>All of our different methods yield similar results. We find that consumption inequality within the U.S. between 1980 and 2010 has increased by nearly the same amount as income inequality</em></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><em>Income Inequality and Leisure Inequality: Do the 1% Work Harder Than the 99%?</em></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Wall Street Journal Wealth Report, <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/wealth/2012/04/27/do-the-wealthy-work-harder-than-the-rest/?mod=WSJBlog">Do the Wealthy Work Harder Than the Rest?</a>, by Robert Frank:</p></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><em>A new study [below] offers evidence that higher-educated (and therefore higher-earning)  Americans do indeed spend more time working and less time on leisure than poorer income groups. In fact, while income inequality may be growing, “leisure inequality” – time spent on enjoyment – is growing as a mirror image, with the low earners gaining leisure and the high earners losing.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><em><br /></em><br />
<blockquote><em>The more surprising discovery, however, is a corresponding leisure gap has opened up between the highly-educated and less-educated. Low-educated men saw their leisure hours grow to 39.1 hours in 2003-2007, from 36.6 hours in 1985. Highly-educated men saw their leisure hours shrink to 33.2 hours from 34.4 hours. &#8230; A similar pattern emerged for women. Low-educated women saw their leisure time grow to 35.2 hours a week from 35 hours. High-educated women saw their leisure time decrease to 30.3 hours from 32.2 hours. &#8230; (The study defines leisure as time spend watching TV, socializing, playing games, talking on the phone, reading personal email, enjoying entertainment and hobbies and other activities.) &#8230;</em></p></blockquote>

<div></div>
<div>Today we are continuing to look at the historical tax tables to see how we viewed and possibly defined rich.  I introduced this idea with my post: <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/09/define-rich-part-iii-what-tax-tables-of.html">Defining Rich III</a>.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I found a source for all sorts of historical data from the <a href="http://www.census.gov/prod/www/abs/statab.html">Census Bureau</a>.  You can down load it or the better way is to click on the PDF file which brings up the Intro and then click on any of the listings of the table of contents which takes you to that set of PDF data.  For this posting regarding income data I am using <a href="http://www2.census.gov/prod2/statcomp/documents/1937-13.pdf">this section</a>.   </div>
<div></div>
<div>The average weekly income for all manufacturing was $22.82 per week on 39.1 hours work.  The highest paid was printing/publishing newspapers/periodicals at $35.15 per week on 37 hours work.  The lowest was cotton goods at $13.80 per week on 37.5 hours of work.   </div>
<div></div>
<div>In the non-manufacturing sector the I calculated the average weekly income to be $23.76 on 40.28 hours of work.  The highest earnings were electric power/lights manufactured gas at $31.70 per week on 40.2 hours work.  The lowest was hotels at $13.97 per week on 48.3 hours of work.    For the Walmart greeter retail trade-general merchandising it was $17.51 per week on 40.8 hours work.</div>
<div></div>
<div>There were regional differences also.  The most glaring is the north/south difference.  The hourly wage ranges from 12.5 cents to 19 cents less if you worked in the south.  The greatest differences being between the East South Central and the Pacific North.  </div>
<div></div>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<div>The data uses an average of 1923 to 1925 to equal 100% for comparisons.  Thus, 1936 weekly earnings were 89.7 % of that standard however they were 109.9 % adjusted for cost of living.  Things were looking up having hit their lows in 1933.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Using my <a href="http://www.measuringworth.com/calculators/index.php">favorite money converter</a> and to not let the numbers become to many and thus cause one&#8217;s mind to go blank, I converted the average hourly wage for the four categories listed:</div>
<div></div>
<div><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-7FzQWjwM8C8/T1OHwyv0cpI/AAAAAAAAASI/T3BmhKZ1WQM/s1600/1936+Hourly+pay+Converted.JPG" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="197" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-7FzQWjwM8C8/T1OHwyv0cpI/AAAAAAAAASI/T3BmhKZ1WQM/s320/1936+Hourly+pay+Converted.JPG" width="320"></a></div>
<div>  </div>
<div>Thus we have an annual income ranging from a high of $1827.80 per year for the newspaper worker to $717.60 per year for the cotton goods worker.   These are the numbers you need to keep in mind as we look at the 1936 tax tables.  These are the numbers that let us start to understand what we used to  </div>
<div>consider rich.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The lowest tax rate in 1936 is 4% on incomes up to $4000.   This $4000 appears to capture  the income of the vast majority of workers in the nation in 1936.    Remember, this income that is taxed is already adjusted for any deductions.  Thus, if after all your deductions you had $4000 left over, you paid 4% of that in federal income tax.  You paid $160 in taxes.    Today, using the converted average income a person would be paying up to 15% of their adjusted income for federal income taxes.  They would be paying 25% if they were receiving the equivalent share of GDP/capita.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The highest rate in 1936 is 79% on income over $5,000,000.  OH MY GOD!  Don&#8217;t panic folks.  Converted as unskilled labor, this is $188,000,000 of adjusted gross income.  That is a freakn&#8217; pile of money after all deductions are taken.  Still, I&#8217;m sure some are thinking I must be a real soak the rich kind of guy to brush off 79%.  Here&#8217;s the thing.  It&#8217;s a very big thing.  VERY BIG THING.  This person is only paying that 79% on any money above the $5,000,000 after all deductions.   They spent all the money they believed their business (s) needed, they gave all they wanted to charity, they took the housing credits, subtracted any losses on capital gains, gave to their children and any other activity that would subtract money from their gross income.  When it was all done, that person still had $5,000,000 left over to be taxed at 79% and it is only that $1 (ONE DOLLAR) which put their income at $5,000,000 that will be taxed at 79%.  </div>
<div></div>
<div>What we have forgotten, or have failed to honestly accept is that the old way of producing a tax schedule did not tax at a constant rate from the first dollar.  Each time you broke into a new “tax bracket” only that money within that tax bracket was taxed at the brackets given rate.  Thus, the higher up the tax rate ladder one was, the smaller their actual percentage of income paid for taxes became relative to the indexes specified rate.  Frankly what this means is that the only person paying the full bracketed rate is the person at the bottom of the table.  If you were in the 4% bracket, you paid a full 4% of your ADJUSTED gross income to the federal government.   How convenient for those arguing to “simplify” the tax system that a huge portion of the tax paying public pays the full indexed rate and thus when you talk to them about a 79% tax rate they are prone to interpret that rate as being paid on all the money they earned. Ouch!  How to move a populous made simple. </div>
<div></div>
<div>There were 33  brackets in 1936.  When people talked about the “complexity” of the tax system they used to be talking about how many brackets there were.  After all, the goal of the complainers is to get the “system” down to the lowest single rate they can buy.  Interestingly enough, there is a flat rate in the 1936 table.  You just had to be willing to really work hard to earn an income large enough to receive such a rate.  It&#8217;s the top rate.  </div>
<div></div>
<div>The following chart shows how this works.  It is a chart of the percentages of the marginal rate verse the actual rate paid.  Notice how there is a bulge in the middle.  Those people got the biggest built in break from the marginal rate.  I don&#8217;t know how to figure out how many people were within the bracket range of number 7 to 23, but it would be interesting to see if this was what we would consider the middle class.</div>
<div><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-H1v9kCeo-tw/T1OIQrvadRI/AAAAAAAAASQ/zWYFdOLlkHI/s1600/1936+Marginal+vs+Actual+Tax+rate.JPG" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="235" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-H1v9kCeo-tw/T1OIQrvadRI/AAAAAAAAASQ/zWYFdOLlkHI/s320/1936+Marginal+vs+Actual+Tax+rate.JPG" width="320"></a></div>
<div></div>
<div>  </div>
<div>What all this comes down to is a chart that looks as follows:</div>
<div><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-t_FIS6h4jFE/T1OIZ4bE8bI/AAAAAAAAASY/3vWOhS8t9CY/s1600/1936+Tax+Table+Graph.JPG" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="235" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-t_FIS6h4jFE/T1OIZ4bE8bI/AAAAAAAAASY/3vWOhS8t9CY/s320/1936+Tax+Table+Graph.JPG" width="320"></a></div>
<div>Notice that once we get to the 25th bracket the individual is paying more than 50% of their income in taxes.  For shame people will say.  How dare We the People take so much from that person.  It&#8217;s stealing!  NOT!</div>

<div></div>
<div>First, at the 25<sup>th</sup> bracket the adjusted gross income in today&#8217;s unskilled labor value is $9,420,000 per year.  Remember, ADJUSTED GROSS INCOME.  All deductions have been taken.  There is nothing at this income that one could not have had at $7,540,000 (the converted income that taxes less than 50%) that is not just more of what they already have.</div>
<div></div>
<div> </div>
<div>Second, at this level of income no one is doing it solely on their own.  What we used to understand is that there is a point of income earning that stops being do to one&#8217;s labor and moves to being simply the capture of a greater share of the income earned off the commons.  Haven&#8217;t hear that term “commons”.  Ask a person <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_commons">from Massachusetts</a>.  In the case of income, it is the money earned as a results of all the investments We the<br />People have made.  In practice if you own a business and have employees, the road you used to get to your business  is used by all the employees and thus you have received a share of their share of the use of the road.  You have received a greater share of the road&#8217;s effect on economic activity without doing any extra work.  You only had to pay your taxes&#8230;just like all your employees in order to have that road in place for your use.  I believe this is why there was a point in the 1936 tax table at which your tax paid became greater than 50% and climbed steeply until you rang the income bell at which time your were rewarded with a flat rate on everything earned beyond the bell&#8217;s posted height.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Third, at this level of income the Constitution&#8217;s prime objective kicks in: equality of power.  We are living the effects of having been taught away from this effect of money.  I refer you back to my series looking at taxation from a justice perspective.  Starting <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2008/01/opus-1-discussion-on-taxation.html">here</a> going on <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2008/01/opus-1-second-movement-on-taxation.html">here</a> and<a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2008/02/opus-finale-discussion-on-taxation.html"> finishing here</a>.  I&#8217;ll just let what I ended that series with be my overall thoughts on why power and thus justice need to be part of the taxation discussion: </div>
<div> </div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><div>As a professional, I can understand the argument to separate the two issues via 2 professions. The concept of a profession is that it is specialized. As a thinking person and a citizen, the public discussion should not allow the issue of efficiency to dominate one profession&#8217;s focus while the issue of equity dominates another profession. We have to assure both equity and efficiency are discussed and decided upon in order to stay true to the preamble of the Constitution and minimize Thomas Jefferson&#8217;s observation of the citizens response.</div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>There is one major point to learn from the charts above.  If you want a progressive system, you need many tax brackets.  The more steps there are the more fair and specifically addressed is any particular level of income.   To compare the charts of 1936 to 2010, you can view the<a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-lX4293efG5Y/Tl_Efh3ab1I/AAAAAAAAARc/W7X0lIr0Ki0/s1600/2010+Tax+table+Define+Rich+3.JPG"> 2010 table here</a> and <a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-OCqtKMLzE3A/Tl_Ejt_NFtI/AAAAAAAAARg/bwU8IixjaGc/s1600/2010+Tax+rate+graph+Define+Rich+3.JPG">the graph here</a>.</div>

<p> The first graph shows Real GDP/capita and <a href="http://jazzbumpa.blogspot.com/2011/02/real-disposible-income-per-capita.html">Real Disposable Income/Cap</a> since 1950 on a log scale.  (Data through 2009, from <a href="http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/cats/income_expenditures_poverty_wealth.html">The Census Bureau</a>. Table 678 at the link.)</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve left the 50&#8217;s out of the argument (but not the graph,) as a  courtesy to Ike, since his  relative performance suffers due to the post war baby boom.  The  population grew at an above normal rate for over a decade, and that  skews the GDP/Cap data.</p>

<p><a name="more"></a><br />If you&#8217;ve been paying any attention to time series economic data, you  know there are break  points in almost any econ measure, somewhere in the vicinity of 1980.   I&#8217;ve added trend lines, breaking the data sets arbitrarily at 1980.   These trend lines here tell the same story &#8211; it&#8217;s deja vu all over  again.   Pre-1980 trend lines start with 1960 data.  I stopped the post &#8217;80  trend line data sets at 2007, to avoid the  influence of The Great Recession, which would have have <i>further deceased</i> their slopes.</p>
<p> What I want to emphasize here is the difference between the two lines.   Though both have a knee, the Disposable Income break is much sharper.    Here is a graph of the difference between the two, linear scale.  And,  BTW, this time I left the &#8217;08 and &#8217;09 data in the trend line  determination.  </p>

<p> Well &#8211; since 1980(-ish) not only has GDP growth slowed, the amount  captured in disposable income has decreased, quite dramatically.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a whole lot of wealth that is NOT ending up in the hands of ordinary people.   Which is why it doesn&#8217;t get spent.  But that is another story.</p>

                                <p><u>INTRODUCTION</u></p>
<p>1) Rethug Speaker of the House John Boehner says that as a nation, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/robert-creamer/no-mr-boehner-america-is_b_823304.html">&#8220;we&#8217;re broke</a>&#8220;; Rethug presidential candidate Ron Paul claims America &#8220;<a href="http://www.mediaite.com/tv/rep-ron-paul-america-should-declare-bankruptcy/">should declare bankruptcy</a>.&#8221;  I say these two are liars, and at least one of them is crazy.</p>
<p>2) Tyler Cowan says &#8220;<a href="http://conhomeusa.typepad.com/bigideas/2011/02/tyler-cowen-.html">we are poorer than we think we are</a>,&#8221; due to mis-measurement of value, which might be true.  I believe his prescription for recovery is generally very bad, though.</p>
<p>3) In comments to <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/01/matt-stoller-former-senior-policy.html">my previous Angry Bear post</a>, Bob McManus directed us to the writings of Michael Hudson, where we find his post <a href="http://michael-hudson.com/2011/12/democracy-and-debt/">Democracy and Debt</a>.   This is must reading.  The relevant point here is that the increasing  capture of wealth, as rents, by a creditor class impoverishes society in  general, and this eventually leads to severe repression, major social  upheaval, or both.  <a href="http://jazzbumpa.blogspot.com/2011/04/brute-economics-of-slavery.html">I whole-heartedly agree</a>.</p>
<p>4) Jon Hammond&#8217;s <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/01/guest-post-does-lower-corporate-tax.html">guest post at Angry Bear </a>shows that a more-or-less continuous decrease in real investment has occurred during the post WW II era.</p>
<p>In  this series of posts, I intend to show that we are a wealthy nation,  but that our wealth  has been increasingly captured by elite creditors,  who, in my opinion, are strangling the economy by 1) extracting  excessive rents and 2) diverting this wealth to financial tail chasing,  rather than real investment.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><u>WHERE THE MONEY HASN&#8217;T GONE </u></p>
<p>Here is a look at average hourly earnings, the typical income of a working stiff, presented on a log scale.</p>
<p>
<div><a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fredgraph.png?g=4ks"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fredgraph.png?g=4ks" width="400"></a></div>
<p>Like almost every time series you can imagine, <a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?g=4kt">including GDP</a>,  it exhibits a break near 1980.   The break is always to lower growth.   But, compared to most other data series, this break is especially sharp.</p>
<p>Hear  is the same series compared to GDP, an approximate measure of the  income of the nation, on a linear scale.  For this graph, each is  normalized to a value of 100 in Q1, 1965.</p>
<p>
<div><a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fredgraph.png?g=4kr"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fredgraph.png?g=4kr" width="400"></a></div>
<p>While earnings have grown less than 8 times in 47 years, GDP has grown more than 20 times.</p>
<p>Clearly,  the money has not gone to compensation of the workers whose labor  actually creates the wealth of the nation.  That might explain some of <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/12/be-vewy-vewy-quiet/">the alleged envy</a>.</p>
<p><u>CORPORATE PROFITS</u></p>
<p>As a first step in  finding where the money has gone, let&#8217;s consider the growth of corporate  after-tax profits since about 1950.  You can see it in <a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?g=4j9">this FRED graph</a>.    It&#8217;s on a log scale, so constant growth would be a straight line.   There are lots of wiggles, but I see an increasing slope over time, and  it&#8217;s not an optical illusion.</p>
<p>
<div><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0RbG_1gQUYM/Tw3ddKHUaoI/AAAAAAAABvQ/Q_Yy2WdP7TU/s1600/Corp+Profits+Jan+2012.JPG"><img border="0" height="298" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0RbG_1gQUYM/Tw3ddKHUaoI/AAAAAAAABvQ/Q_Yy2WdP7TU/s400/Corp+Profits+Jan+2012.JPG" width="400"></a></div>
<p>There  are a lot of ways to parse this.  One is to connect the dip bottoms  with straight lines.  I&#8217;ve done that with alternating red and blue to  show the slope increasing over time.  The problem is selecting which  bottoms to connect.  Some alternate choices are indicated in yellow.   The yellow lines define times of above normal profit growth: 1970 to  1980, 1986 to 1998, and 2001 through 2007.  Each of them leads to a  correction, indicated by a purple line across the top of the decline.</p>
<p>After  I did all that, it occurred to me to let Excel throw an exponential  best fit line on the data set, and you can see that as well.</p>
<p>I  see now that I could have included another yellow line from 1961 to  1967.  Notice that with each yellow line, the data set advances above  the exponential best fit line before a sideways correction takes it  below again.  After the correction is complete, profits increase again  until the best fit curve is breached.  Or, they did until now.</p>
<p>Remember  that on a log scale constant growth rate is represented by a straight  line, and that the growth compounds, so that the underlying increase is  exponential.  Sooner or later, that has to end.  Nothing in the real  word can go to infinity.  Here we see an exponential curve on a log  scale.  This demonstrates an increasing growth rate.  Therefore, the  underlying increase is greater than exponential.  If exponential growth  is unsustainable, what would you say about greater than exponential  growth?</p>
<p>In fact, the whole trend might now be falling  apart, as the last blue line has a much lower slope.  Also, for the  first time following a correction, profits have stayed below the trend  line, and the gap is increasing.</p>
<p>To show the extent of  national income capture by corporations, here is a graph of corporate  profits as a percentage of GDP.   I&#8217;ve divided the set into two  segments: 1951 to 1979, and 1980 on, and had Excel place a linear trend  line on each.  This division is somewhat arbitrary, but almost every  economic time series you can find has a break point within a few years  of 1980.  Division between &#8217;79 and &#8217;80 is the least favorable to my  point that Profits/GDP had no trend in the post WW II Golden Age, but  have trended sharply upward during the Great Stagnation period.</p>
<p>
<div><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-0DQTBTXwI3M/Tw3lMSmUMDI/AAAAAAAABvY/FMm1xzEdTNE/s1600/Corp+Prof+by+GDP.JPG"><img border="0" height="298" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-0DQTBTXwI3M/Tw3lMSmUMDI/AAAAAAAABvY/FMm1xzEdTNE/s400/Corp+Prof+by+GDP.JPG" width="400"></a></div>
<p>Profit/GDP  growth was unusually poor from 1980 through 1986.  Then from late 2001  through early 2006 it exhibited the greatest growth ever.  But remember  the denominator effect.  <a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?g=4jc">Nominal GDP growth</a> increased rapidly following the &#8217;80-&#8217;82 double recession; while GDP  growth in this century has been generally slow.  The financial melt-down  of 2008 caused a dip that was sharp and brief, but the rebound has not  gone to a new high.  But even now, in the midst of anemic recovery,  profit/GDP is hovering in the 9 to 10% range, far above historical  norms. </p>
<p><u>CONCLUSION</u></p>
<p>The  corporate profit growth picture looks unsustainable, and that is  troubling.  What it means for the future is anybody&#8217;s guess.  But, what  we get from it is the first partial answer to the question, &#8220;Where has  all the money gone?&#8221;</p>
<p>Gone to profits, everyone.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The accompanying graphic shows a fascinating correlation. In the years before New Deal regulation of banks and after the easing of regulations began in 1980, bank failures were quite high. So was income inequality.</p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/david-cay-johnston/files/2011/12/US_BNKFAIL1211_SC.jpg"><img title="US_BNKFAIL1211_SC" alt="" src="http://blogs.reuters.com/david-cay-johnston/files/2011/12/US_BNKFAIL1211_SC.jpg" width="500" height="350"></a></p>
<p> <a name="more"></a>
<p>But from about 1933, when the federal regulation of banks was put in place, to 1980, when Chicago School theories began to shape policy, bank failures were rare. During those years incomes were much more equal, with a prosperous middle class. &#8230;</p>
<p>Correlation is not causality, but the fact that income inequality rose as banking regulations were eased makes sense. Freed of restraints, banks got into all sorts of activities that generated fees and saddled clients with high-interest debt. And once banks could collect fees for mortgages without having to worry about repayment — because the mortgages were sold off by Wall Street — the crucial link between reward and responsibility was severed.</p>
<p>With loosened financial regulation it would seem smart to increase law enforcement. Instead, enforcement was cut, as the chart from Syracuse University’s Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse shows. Based on Justice Department internal reports, it shows criminal prosecutions involving financial firms down sharply since fiscal 1999.</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>These findings about bank failures, income inequality and lack of prosecutions all take us back to the coordinated attempt by the central banks of the United States, Britain, Canada, the European Union, Japan and Switzerland to delay the day of reckoning on European debt. &#8230; Given the revolving doors that allow the financial class to move smoothly between government, central banks and financial firms throughout the modern world, and how those in power in all of these places have invested their reputations in Chicago School theories, my educated guess is that taxpayers will be stuck with the costs. Let’s hope I am wrong.</p></blockquote>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>When I left <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/09/define-rich-part-iii-what-tax-tables-of.html">this series</a> in September, I had introduced the idea of looking at past tax tables as a means of understanding how We the People define rich.  One specific note from history was a surcharge on top of themarginal tax rates to pay for the Great One (WWII).  Obviously, that aspect of our moral character has gone right out the window. 
<div></div>
<div>Also for a <a href="http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxfacts/displayafact.cfm?Docid=203">brief period</a> (1936 to 1943,on 6 occasions) business paid more of the income tax revenue collected than did people.  I also noted that 1983 and 2009 the corporate share of income tax revenue was just over 6% of the totalrevenues (FICA included).  Its lowest points.  Reagan/Bush II. However, interestingly enough, Bush II did manage to get thecorporate tax collections as a percentage of personal collections(excluding FICA) up to 33.9%! Clinton only managed 26.6% in 1995. The last time we saw a ratio where corporate collections were in the30% range was 1979.   In 1959 it was 47.1%.   1980 heralded the new standard of the mid to low 20% range.   Of course Reagan wins thispersonal verses corporate relationship with a corporate total that is only 12.8% of the personal in 1983.</div>
<p>
<div>One other very interesting aspect ofour tax history using <a href="http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxfacts/displayafact.cfm?Docid=203">the same table</a> is that from 1934 to 1983 when tax revenue from personal collections became less than the year prior, this was only for one year with the exception of 1945/46. Corporate revenue follows the same pattern except for 3 periods where there was a decline for 2 years running: 1946/47, 1958/59 and1961/62.  From 1983 until 2001 the personal revenue is more every year than the year prior.  It&#8217;s like a switch was thrown after 1983.  The corporate revenue declines twice for 1 year each in this 1983 –2001 span; 1990 and 1999.  Starting in 2001, the decline in revenuecollections for both personal and corporate last for 3 years running;2001 to 2003 and 2008 to 2010.  Someone threw a double pole switchhere.  We&#8217;ll have to wait to see for 2011.</div>
<div></div>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<div>Obviously, from this bit of history we can see a few trends at least.  We have been reducing the burden on corporations as paying their share for the use of the commons.  From1984 to 2000 the personal collections never declined yet thecorporate did twice.  Prior to 2001, our tax tables and all their loop holes produced a fairly stable ever rising stream of revenue. However, after 2001, the stability is less in that any time there isa reduction in revenue collections, it lasts 3 times longer. Finally, except for 2005 to year ending 2007, since 1980 we think that corporations should only pay between 20 to 26% of what We thePeople pay in to our government.  </div>
<div></div>
<div>I mention all the above because it isevident that more than just the marginal rates are changing and, as far as my assessment of these changes go, they are leading us to anever less stable adjusted gross income base for then calculating the tax due.  That is, the base has been adjusted such that it is moresensitive to down turns in the economy.  Prior to the Reagan taxrevolution, both the personal and corporate base were fairly evenlysensitive with the corporate being maybe a little more sensitive.  </div>
<div></div>
<div>For 50 years (1934 to 1983) there wereonly 3 periods in which the corporate collections were less for 2years in a row and none of them were the back to back Reaganrecessions.  After 1983, the base for personal taxation has changedsuch that it is not effected by any recession.  However, thecorporations got relief twice.  Considering that from 1934 to 1982there are only 2 recessions listed by <a href="http://www.nber.org/cycles.html">NBER</a> as lasting more than a year (1973/75and 1981/82, 16 months each)  1 year of less revenue does not seembad.  However, for the last 2 recessions, the revenue collectionshave been less each year for 3 consecutive years for both thepersonal and the corporate collections even though the latestrecession is listed as lasting 18 months. </div>
<div></div>
<div>Withinthis 3 year pattern, we also see that the declines are greater.  Fromthe high to the low for 2000 to 2003, by 2003 personal collectionsare 79% of the high and corporations are 63% of their high.  For thepresent recession personal became 78.4% of the high and corporationswas 62.9% of their high.  Even in 1983, when Reagan wins thepersonal/corporation differential the declines were only 97% personaland 75.2% corporations.  For another perspective, that 2 year declineof personal revenue collections for 1945/46 the personal declinedonly to 81.7% of the high.  During this period the corporations onlydeclined for 1 year (1947) to 72.5% of the high.  In 1947, corporaterevenue collections were 48% of the personal collections.  In 2000,the peak corporations revenue was 20.6% and in 2008 it was 26.6% ofthe personal revenue collections.     </div>
<div></div>
<div>Obviously we made more than marginalrate changes after 1980.  We changed the way the base is calculatedsuch that corporations paid significantly less as a share of thetotal income taxes and was more tied to a change in the economy suchthat corporate taxes due were less during a recession where as thepeople had no reprieve.  How&#8217;s that for fairness?  Then came Bush II. The base changed even more&#8230; so such that now the decline inrevenue collected lasted longer than the recession and the declineswere greater.</div>
<div></div>
<div>We do not just need to raise the rates,we need to return to a broader base.  That is, when all thedeductions are done, the adjusted gross income needs to be higher. On the other hand, what we are seeing here could be the results ofthe massive shift of income up the line combined with the decreasedrates.  Considering this history, the cry to lower rates and get ridof loop holes just will not work.  This is a cry for flattening theincome tax, which is what we have been doing since the 60&#8217;s which wasaccelerated since Reagan.  It will create a tax base that is moreunstable and thus runs even greater deficits during times of economicdecline not to mention the overall decline in total revenue collectedduring good times.  And, it totally ignores the issues of equality ofpower along with the concept of the commons.  You know, that We thePeople premise.     </div>
<div></div>
<p>But before you get to excited aboutthis suggesting or, that I am saying that the poor need to pay moretaxes and the rich are over taxed consider the tax table from 1936,its lowest income tax bracket is 4%.   This is on an income up to$4000.  Let&#8217;s bring that forward to 2010 using my <a href="http://www.measuringworth.com/calculators/compare/">favorite money converter</a>.  CPI states that $4000 is now $60,400.  Today&#8217;s rate for $16,750 to $68,000 is 15% instead of 4%.  Of course,I like the unskilled labor and nominal GDP/capita numbers of $145,000and $275,000 respectfully.</p>
<p>Alright, I&#8217;ll be fair.  The lowest rate in1967 is 14% for up to $1000.  That figures to 2010 of $6540 CPI,$6670 unskilled and $11200 nominal GDP/capita.  Though, the $4000 in1936 is $9640 in 1967 which puts one in the 22% bracket ofthat year.  Using the $12000 for the top of that 1967 bracket brings us to$78,300 CPI adjusted gross income for 2010.  $78,300 puts one in the25% bracket for 2010.  Obviously another issue we have here when itcomes to setting up marginal rates based on historical records is howmuch the base (adjusted gross income) is effected by how the CPI iscalculated.  Any way you figure it, we have been pushing the marginalrate higher and deeper into the lower end of the income pool.
<div></div>
<div>Ok, onto the fondly remembered tax yearof 1936.  Next post. </div>

<p><a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2011/11/the-rights-scam-about-social-security-it-aint-broke-unless-china-is-too.html">The right&#8217;s smoke and mirrors scam about Social Security&#8211;it ain&#8217;t broke (unless China is too)</a>
<p>We&#8217;ve noted in these postings the growing inequality between rich and the rest of us in America, and that is the appropriate backdrop against which to investigate further the right&#8217;s smoke-and-mirrors scams about tax policy and earned benefits.  Let me remind you with Kevin Drum&#8217;s Mother Jones article on <a href="http://motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2011/10/price-plutocracy-0">The Price of Plutocracy</a>: &#8220;<strong><em>For all practical purposes, every year about $700 billion in income is being sucked directly out of the hands of the poor and the middle class and shoveled into the hands of the rich</em>.</strong>&#8221; (That sentence is illustrated with a great chart, with data drawn from Joseph Hacker of Yale and Paul Pierson of Berkeley, the authors of Winner-Take-All Politics, a book I highly recommend.)</p>
<p>The national debate about deficits has been part of a relentless push by the right to reduce as much as possible the New Deal earned benefit programs of Social Security and Medicare. The right twists the facts to suit the arguments it wants to make.  Krugman hones in on this issue, noting Dean Baker&#8217;s similar anger at the Washington Post&#8217;s inconsistency in considering Social Security in a recent article by Post writer Lori Montgomery, who seems to be miming for the hard right, anti-New Deal crowd in Washington .  See Krugman, <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/30/social-security-bait-and-switch-a-continuing-series/">Social Security, Bait and Switch, a Continuing Series</a>, New York Times (Oct. 30, 2011).</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Social Security is a program that is part of the federal budget, but is by law supported by a dedicated source of revenue. This means that there are two ways to look at the program’s finances: in legal terms, or as part of the broader budget picture.</em></p>
<p> <a name="more"></a>
<p><em>In legal terms, the program is funded not just by today’s payroll taxes, but by accumulated past surpluses — the trust fund. If there’s a year when payroll receipts fall short of benefits, but there are still trillions of dollars in the trust fund, what happens is, precisely, nothing — the program has the funds it needs to operate, without need for any Congressional action.</em></p>
<p><em>Alternatively, you can think about Social Security as just part of the federal budget. But in that case, it’s just part of the federal budget; it doesn’t have either surpluses or deficits, no more than the defense budget.</em></p>
<p><em>Both views are valid, depending on what questions you’re trying to answer.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>What you can’t do is insist that the trust fund is meaningless, because SS is just part of the budget, then claim that some crisis arises when receipts fall short of payments, because SS is a standalone program</em>.</strong>  Id. (emphasis added).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Further, the right refers to these programs as &#8220;entitlements&#8221;, a term that is meant to dredge up resentments against those who have some rights to benefits from these programs.  The right uses &#8220;personal responsibility&#8221; and &#8220;entitlements&#8221; as though they refer to two non-intersecting worlds, whereas in fact the opposite is true.</p>
<p>Workers pay into Social Security to support current workers who paid into it in the past.  The trust fund was established, and amended with a good deal of actuarial research under Reagan in 1983, with the knowledge that the baby boom generation would be passing through and create a bulge of benefit needs and that US birth rates tended to be smaller now than they were a century ago.  In other words.  what is happening now in terms of the baby boomer population reaching retirement age and the decline in US birthrates was exactly the information on which the Social Security changes made in the 1980s were predicated.  Either we believe that these kinds of predictions are reasonable (in which case it is utterly silly to raise nightmare scenarioes about bankruptcy, because there is nothing of the sort) or we believe that it is impossible to predict for sure what will happen (in which case it is utterly silly to raise nightmare scenarios about Social Security bankruptcy, because GDP could grow just a little faster than predicted, easing all future problems, or boomer needs could grow just a little less than predicted, easing all future problems).  Either way, the crisis-bell ringing being done by the right as a way to attribute deficits to Social Security is a smoke and mirrors scam.</p>
<p>It is even more so since the Social Security trust fund is invested in US Treasuries and those Treasuries plus new tax funds coming in pay all the benefit costs.  Is the US going to default on Treasuries.  Well, if so, we have a bigger problem with Japan and China not liking that&#8211;not just the Social Security trust fund.  The hard right seems to think it is okay to play political games with US debt, but American citizens should be aware that this is what they are doing.</p>
<p>For a good overall exposition of these issues, see the article in  Salon by Gene Lyons, <a href="http://www.salon.com/2011/11/03/how_the_rich_created_the_social_security_crisis/?source=newsletter">How the Rich Created the Social Security &#8216;Crisis&#8217;</a> (Nov. 3, 2011) (noting the &#8220;decades-long propaganda war against America’s most efficient, successful and popular social insurance program&#8221;).</p>
<blockquote><p><em>[T]his is the beneficiaries’ money, invested by the Social Security trustees in U.S. Treasury bonds drawn upon “the full faith and credit of the United States.” <strong>Far from being “meaningless IOUs” as right-wing cant has it, they represent the same legally binding promise between the U.S. government and its people that it makes with Wall Street banks and the Chinese government, which also hold Treasury Bonds</strong>.</em></p>
<p><em>A promise not very different, the Daily Howler’s Bob Somerby points out, from the one implicit in your bank statement or 401K (if you’re lucky enough to have one). Did you think the money was buried in earthen jars filled with gold bullion and precious stones?  Id. (emphasis added).</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>One might add that many of our multinational corporations that are currently lobbying heavily for yet another tax break in the form of a &#8220;repatriation holiday&#8221; for their offshored, untaxed profits actually have the substantial portion of those profits invested in those same U.S. Treasury notes.  So, as ataxingmatter has noted before, much of that money is already in the US and repatriation will generally not be of much benefit merely from bringing cash back to go through the US economy.  As the article notes, allowing repatriation would lead to corporations dumping about a trillion of US Treasuries on the market, and likely cause a rise in the interest rate the US government must pay to borrow.  Not a win-win situation.  IN fact, clearly a loss for the US government and the majority of US taxpayers, both in Treasury interest rates and in lost corporate tax revenues.</p>

                                <div><a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/richard_wilkinson.html">This is a 16 minute</a> * lecture by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_G._Wilkinson">Richard Wilkinson</a>.  It is posted at TED.  I am posting it here, as I can not believe this information has not received more attention now that the US is awakening from the decades long delusion of prosperity which did not and as shown in the lecture could not lead to greater justice (which implies equality) via the model of economics we have been using. </div>
<div></div>
<div>The model known by many aliases (Chicago School, Friedman, etc) has resulted in the thought that people are drowning in debt and that we have privatized the profits but socialized the losses. These are inaccurate metaphors. They are the results of the language of the delusion we have been living for 3 decades and thus by definition can not capture the truth of our condition. As the science presented in the lecture shows, if our all encompassing concern should be equality, then people are not drowning, they are <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/06/monetary-policy-im-not-only-not-feeling.html">dehydrating</a>. </div>
<div></div>
<div>The dehydration is the results of privatizing security in life and socializing the risks in life. We are not “drowning” in risk or losses. We of the 99% are lacking in the substance that reduces risk. One can certainly drown from too much water, but the natural risk in life is not having too much water, it is having too little. Thus is the realization of the delusional statement “drowning in debt” and “socialized the losses”. </div>
<p><a name="more"></a>
<div>The lack of reduction of life&#8217;s risks is the inequality, the social injustice&#8230;the diversion from the purpose expressed in the preamble to our Constitution. “We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.”</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>The following <a href="http://www.crimeandjustice.org.uk/wilkinsoninequality.html">concluding statement</a> from a different lecture by Professor Wilkinson summarizes the TED lecture. As you watch the lecture keep in mind the 4 goals I highlighted of the preamble and consider that they were put into a document that created an government 223 years ago this year (based on ratification). I have a greater respect for the intellect and their insight into the human experience of those who wrote and ratified our Constitution. </div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><p>“For thousands of years the best way of improving the quality of human life has been to raise material living standards. We are the first generation to have got to the end of that process. No longer does economic growth improve health, happiness, or wellbeing. If we are to improve the real quality of life further, we have to direct our attention to the social environment and the quality of social relations. But rather than continuing to tackle each problem separately, by spending more on medical care, more on police, social workers and drug rehabilitation units, we now know that it is possible to improve the psychosocial wellbeing and social functioning of whole societies. <strong>The quality of social relations is built on material foundations &#8211; on the scale of the material inequalities between us</strong>.” </p></blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>With information such as this research and that of the<a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2007/10/human-capital-is-where-its-at.html"> 2005 World Bank</a> paper on what produces wealth , considering our Constitution&#8217;s preamble, we should not be struggling looking for guidance as to what direction, what path, what solution we need for our self (our self as in We the People). </div>

<p>Inequality&#8211;the facts speak for themselves (don&#8217;t listen to the apologists on the right)
<p>Inequality is real, and it is growing.  It is debilitating for democratic institutions, as the Supreme Court&#8217;s Citizens United case and its aftermath start to impact the federal elections and as the money from the Koch brothers, Walton heirs and others swings the debate with purchased sound bites designed to deceive and enable the &#8220;enrich the rich&#8221; winner-take-all economy created by right obstructionism (itself enabled by the relaxation of the filibuster rule that created a 60 vote requirement in the Senate and allowed an intransigent minority to prevent legislative enactments supported by a clear majority).</p>
<p>Tax policy matters to income inequality.  For background on this, read <a href="http://acivilamericandebate.wordpress.com/2011/04/10/the-30-year-growth-of-income-inequality/">The 30-year growth of income inequality</a>, A Civil American Debate (Apr. 10, 2011) (providing two graphs showing the top tax rate over time the income inequality (the percentage of total income going to the top 10%), which shows that income inequality levels inversely track the top tax rate&#8211;as the rate increases, income inequality decreases).  When top tax rates are lowered too much, they do not do their work in maintaining respectable limitations on income inequality.  With the slide in economic fairness under reaganomics (privitization, deregulation, tax cuts&#8211;especially for the wealthy, and militarization), the US has now &#8220;two economies, a wealthy &#8216;top&#8217; economy doing very well, and a &#8216;bottom&#8217; economy for roughly the bottom 99% facing income stagnation, with dwindling wealth and resources.&#8221;  The growth in income inequality shows that gains at the top dwarf, by any measure, those for everybody else.</p>

<p><a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341cf2a753ef0162fc123828970d-pi"><img title="Growth-in-income-inequality1" border="0" alt="Growth-in-income-inequality1" src="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341cf2a753ef0162fc123828970d-800wi"></a></p>
<p> (Note: the most recent CBO report has slightly different numbers, but in the same range&#8211;close enough for our purposes.)</p>
<p>Even these solid income inequality facts are treated by the right as sound bites to be manipulated.  An article in The New Republic debunks the American Enterprise Institute&#8217;s Jim Pethokoukis&#8217;s attempt to mask the facts.  See Matt O&#8217;Brien, <a href="http://www.tnr.com/blog/jonathan-cohn/96897/income-inequality-myth-debunk">Is Income Inequality a &#8216;Myth&#8217;?</a>, The New Republic (Oct. 31, 2011) (hat tip Mark Thoma) (discussing Jim Pethokoukis, <a href="http://blog.american.com/2011/10/5-reasons-why-income-inequality-is-a-myth-and-occupy-wall-street-is-wrong/">5 reasons why income inequality is a myth&#8211;and Occupy Wall Street is wrong</a>, EnterpriseBlog, American Enterprise Institute (Oct. 18, 2011). </p>
<p> As O&#8217;Brien puts it, Pethokoukis&#8217;s article asserting that income inequality is a myth &#8220;suffers from the defect of having a tenuous relationship with reality.&#8221;  Especially when, as Jared Bernstein noted, whatever the cuase for the increase in inequality (and there are several likely suspects), &#8220;the highest quality data that we have all show the same thing: significant increases in inequality.&#8221;</p>
<p>Petrhokoukis tries to suggest that the &#8220;move rightward toward a greater embrace of free-market capitalism&#8221; is proof that inequality hasn&#8217;t exploded in the reaganomics era because inequality should have led to &#8220;beleaguered workers unit[ing] and demand[ing] a vastly expanded safety net and sharply higher taxes on the rich.&#8221;  He calls the &#8220;occupy wall street&#8221; protesters &#8220;radicals&#8221;&#8211;I guess because they are willing to sacrifice personal comfort to bring a non-violent message to the world through their signs and statements about the unfairness of today&#8217;s society with its gaping inequalities in income and wealth, resulting in an influential 1% that can arrange laws to suit them.  He tries to argue that the very idea that &#8220;the rich are getting richer at the expense of the middle class and poor&#8221; is left-wing fantasy.</p>
<p>Of course, the dominance of the free-market mantra is actually proof of inequality, not evidence of some kind of notion of growing equality.  The irrational adoption of Friedmania &#8220;free market&#8221; anti-factual policies has taken place due to the inordinate advantage enjoyed by the uberrich in promoting policies favorable to their own wealth and status in winner-take-all politics, enhanced by recent decisions granting state-created concessions (corporations) &#8220;free speech&#8221; rights to intervene in political campaigns in which corporations do not have a right to vote,</p>
<p>And the ability of the uberrich to buy policies that suit them means that legislation to re-empower unions as an antidote to plutarchy can&#8217;t get passed the &#8220;bought and paid for&#8221; legislatures.  A majority of workers want to be able to unionize; a majority of Americans want higher taxes on the rich; a majority of Americans oppose the kinds of &#8220;bailout&#8221; policies for banks espoused by Bush where there was lots of taxpayer money and no accountability.  The policies favored by the 99% aren&#8217;t enacted because of the power of money wielded by the 1%.</p>
<p>So what does Pethokoukis rely on to make his case? snips and snippets of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pethokoukis claims that income gains have been shared &#8220;fairly equally</strong>&#8221; among workers and managers.&#8221;  While it is true that one piece of research suggests that the gap between productivity and wages may not be as high as commonly thought.  Pethokoukis stretches (and abuses) that research in making his claim.  There&#8217;s clearly a gap, it may be debatable what it&#8217;s exact size is, but there&#8217;s no debating the story of runaway wealth at the top of the income distribution. </li>
<li><strong>Pethokoukis claims that after-inflation median incomes haven&#8217;t really stagnated </strong>in the last 30 years.  He relies on a pair of Federal Reserve studies that use different numbers to jigger the after-inflation incomes produced by CBO.  Voila&#8211;with these &#8216;adjustments&#8217;, the numbers don&#8217;t say what they appear to say.  That&#8217;s not research&#8211;that&#8217;s fudging the numbers to get the desired result. </li>
<li><strong>Pethokoukis asserts that better accounting for positive transfers (taxes, benefits, pensions, healthcare) and consumption would show there is no real inequality gap</strong>.  While it is true that after-tax inequality is smaller than pre-tax inequality (thank goodness), it is not true that inequality is eliminated or even that as much inequality is eliminated as used to be.  Taxes and benefits are less redistributive downwards than they used to be. and tax cuts have been primarily redistributive upwards.  Even taking all benefits into account, inequality is increasing rapidly. As for consumption, the wealthy don&#8217;t have to consume as much of their income as the poor (increases inequality), and the poor and middle class had to borrow in order to maintain consumption (shows increases in inequality). </li>
<li><strong>Pethokoukis claims that measuring inflation correctly shows inequality has been &#8220;roughly&#8221; unchanged. </strong> That&#8217;s ridiculous.  Yeah, higher end goods show more inflation in price than the lower-end goods consumed by the growing class of poverty-striken Americans as Americans move from middle to lower middle and lower income groupings.  The market can still function at the high end with price increases because the wealthy have more income to pay those inflated prices.  The fact that the wealthy have more money to buy more inflated higher end goods doesn&#8217;t mean inequality hasn&#8217;t increased.  Fewer middle class can shop regular goods and now have to shop for discounts.  That&#8217;s more proof of inequality, not less  (inequality still underlies the consumption patterns). </li>
<li><strong>Petrokoukis asserts that the fact that most of the population has the ability to take advantage of technological advances (long-distance telephone calss, air condition, dishwashers, iPods, digital cameras and color TVs) means that inequality isn&#8217;t growing because &#8220;America is better off today.&#8221; </strong> Of course, this is a straw man argument.  First, the growing numbers of American affordable gadgets doesn&#8217;t reduce the shame, humiliation and degradation of poverty for the growing numbers of Americans living in poverty.  Every family will have some of those gadgets, just like poorer families after the advent of trains could enjoy faster transportation (on the few occasions they used it) by train than queens and kings had indulged in in the age of chariots.  Doesn&#8217;t mean that inequality isn&#8217;t rampant, or that those technological benefits make up in any way for the substantial detriments of a highly unequal society where the benchmark norm is whatever everybody has access to and the relative comparison is in terms of what the wealthy have that others don&#8217;t have.  What the wealthy have these days are not so much technological advantages (though those also exist in signficant degree and kind different from what the middle and poor classes enjoy) but advantages in terms of education, opportunity, jobs, access to power, access to influence, health care, travel, leisure, personal space, food, entertainment, etc.  The suggestion that everybody has been so benefited by the gadget culture so that the huge problem of inequality should be ignored shows that somebody has lived on the &#8220;right&#8221; side of the tracks for so long that they cannot even comprehend what it is like to be on the losing side of the winner-take-all economy.</li>
</ul>
<p>The concluding paragraph of the New Republic report sums it up.</p>
<blockquote><p>Since 1979, incomes for the broader middle class increased 40 percent, while the top one percent shot up a staggering 275 percent. Conservatives can pretend otherwise, but the numbers won’t.</p>
