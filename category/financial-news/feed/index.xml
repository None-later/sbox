				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Rebecca Wilder</strong> has shifted to publishing her insightful articles on Europe back to her <em>Newsneconomics</em> platform, but will continue to publish on US topics and US/Europe connections on <strong>Angry Bear</strong>.</p>
<p>I think that the shift is smart&#8230;the audience for Angry Bear is focused more on the US and as the election cycle is already quite heated probably will remain so.  The material on Europe tends to get lost.</p>
<p>The <em>Financial Times</em>, for instance, picks up her material rather quickly through the <em>Newsneconomics</em> name.  Therefore, for now Rebecca has chosen to write for Angry Bear and to keep us abreast of the Eurozone through Newsneconomics.  </p>
<p>Such an arrangement allows for a different audience to communicate with each other in comments, many who are economists and readers who live in the Eurozone and whose primary interest is in their own news.</p>
<p>But Eurozone news remains quite pertinent to Angry Bear readers, hence I will post excerpts and a link to her posts through Angry Bear. </p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.newsneconomics.com/2011/07/scary-chart-of-day-irelands-bank-run.html">Ireland&#8217;s Bank run</a> by Rebecca Wilder</p>
<blockquote><p>I knew that the <a href="http://www.centralbank.ie/polstats/stats/cmab/Pages/Money%20and%20Banking.aspx">Irish deposit base</a> was shrinking &#8211; I just didn&#8217;t realize the severity of the situation. In sum, €21.4 bn in household and non-financial business deposits have been drawn down since their respective peaks.</p>
<p>Irish businesses in aggregate have been in a silent bank run since 2007, households since 2010. So how big is €21.4 bn? Roughly 14% of Irish GDP.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Most investors would acknowledge that social media is playing an increasing role in their investment decisions,&#8221; observes the UK Web site <a href="http://mindfulmoney.co.uk/">Mindful Money</a>. &#8220;Yet no-one has mapped the emerging network of influence likely to be playing a crucial part in those decisions.&#8221; Until now.<br />The presentation below provides a fascinating map of financial media influencers. The MindfulMoney top 20 should come as no surprise. You probably visit them daily, or at least discuss ideas they have unearthed long before the mainstream media stumbles onto them.<br />Here are the top 20, with links, followed by the presentation. Congratulations to all listed: </p>
<p>1. <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/">Naked Capitalism</a><br />2. <a href="http://paul.kedrosky.com/">Infectious Greed</a><br />3. <a href="http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/">The Big Picture</a><br />4. <a href="http://jessescrossroadscafe.blogspot.com/">Jesse&#8217;s Cross Roads Cafe</a><br />5. <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/">Zerohedge</a><br />6. <a href="http://globaleconomicanalysis.blogspot.com/">Mish&#8217;s global Economic Analysis</a><br />7. <a href="http://www.calculatedriskblog.com/">Calculated Risk</a><br />8. <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/">Paul Krugman&#8217;s Blog</a><br />9. <a href="http://ftalphaville.ft.com/">FT Alphaville</a><br />10. <a href="http://blog.mises.org/">Ludwig von Mises Institute</a><br />11. <a href="http://blog.globalmarkettrader.com/">The Market Trader</a><br />12. <a href="http://wsj.com/">WSJ Blogs</a><br />13. <a href="http://epicureandealmaker.blogspot.com/">The Epicurean Dealmaker</a><br />14.<a href="http://www.creditwritedowns.com/">Credit Writedowns</a><br />15. <a href="http://dealbreaker.com/">Dealbreaker</a><br />16. <a href="http://mpettis.com/">China Financial Markets</a><br />17. <a href="http://maxkeiser.com/">Max Keiser</a><br />18. <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/">The Angry Bear</a><br />19. <a href="https://www.economistsubscriptions.com/searchcs/us/">The Economist</a><br />20. <a href="http://www.jrdeputyaccountant.com/">Jr. Deputy Accountant</a></p>
<p>There are several thoughts that occur to me regarding this list,<br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>but the first is that readers and those who comment make a difference&#8230;people bring information and insights that go far beyond slogans of the moment or passions of the day, although those are are part of the deal. This is true for each blog but also from my experience readers usually have at least several blogs on their lists, and often are not organized simply by political economic approach as the first criterion. One can read NC or Economist&#8217;s View as well as Mish.</p>
<p>These blogs are data driven in various ways and often contain many links that allow easy access to data, original materials, or documents so people may check accuracy of the post. In looking for new writers for AB this is one criterion that is mandatory overall, and even decent writers of blogs with strong opinions often omit links to such data or docs, which is unsatisfactory but average for writing. The extra care for targeted audiences pays off.</p>
<p>Most are dominated or driven by a person with a strong presentation style and implied forceful personality who spends a lot of time gathering information and is part of the industry. Angry Bear is a multi-authored blog that has more of a magazine format than most.</p>
<p><a href="http://ibankcoin.com/chessnwine/2011/01/15/ibcs-top-finance-blogs-of-the-internet-2/" target="_blank">Another recent list</a> ranked 20 top financial blogs includes AB and is based on pageviews, but the notion they added appears to have a definition of finance that includes advice to investors.</p>
<p>Anyway, our readers and commenters deserve the credit in addition to the contributors. Thanks all. Dan </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>by: Divorced one like Bush</p>
<p><a href="http://crooksandliars.com/john-amato/peter-schiff-was-right">Crooks and Liar&#8217;s</a> posted this video, but their presentation seems more from a position of how correct Peter Shiff was.  I think what is more important, and a better lesson to learn is how much crap was being presented by Fox as real, reliable, truthful information that &#8220;you can use&#8221;.  Listen to the other &#8220;panelists&#8221;.  </p>
<p>If we do not learn to understand &#8220;crap&#8221; reporting, if we do not learn to understand story telling for selfish purpose, if we do not learn to understand that propagandizing is not solely a political tool, but more importantly an economic tool, we will not solve our&#8217;s and the worlds current economic condition.</p>
<p>What this video is, is the unvailing of one of the real life experiences of the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120382/plotsummary">Truman show</a> we have been living in since Reagan, only this interpretation of the story used the constructed world of finance on the stage known as the economy.</p>
