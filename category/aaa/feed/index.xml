				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a target="_blank" href="http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/08/you-get-what-you-pay-for/">Simon Johnson</a> comments on Standard and Poor&#8217;s irrational ratings:<br />
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/standard_and_poors/index.html?inline=nyt-org">Standard &#038; Poor’s</a> downgrade of United States government debt last month has been much debated, but not enough attention has been devoted to the fact, <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-08-31/subprime-mortgage-bonds-getting-aaa-rating-s-p-denies-to-u-s-treasuries.html">reported last week</a> by Bloomberg News, that it continues to rate securities based on subprime mortgages as AAA.</p>
<p>In short, S.&#038;P. is suggesting that these mortgages are more creditworthy than the United States government — a striking proposition. Leave aside for a moment that S.&#038;P. made a big mistake in its analysis of the <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/f/federal_budget_us/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier">federal budget</a> (as <a href="http://baselinescenario.com/2011/08/16/how-big-is-the-deficit-anyway/">explained</a> by James Kwak in our blog). Just focus on all the things that can go wrong with subprime mortgages: housing prices can fall, people can lose jobs, the economy may fall into <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/r/recession_and_depression/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier">recession</a> and so on.</p>
