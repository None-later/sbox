<p>If I had to pick out the two biggest sources of confusion about Social Security finance it would have to be one, the relation of the Trust Funds to Public Debt and two, the relation of Social Security surplus/deficits to Budget Scoring. At Angry Bear we have discussed the equation Debt Held by the Public + Intragovernmental Holdings = Public Debt enough that most regular readers probably get it. So today I want to lay out some definitions and explanations of &#8216;on-budget&#8217; directly from the source.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2011/assets/concepts.pdf">Office of Management and Budget: Budget Concepts and Budget Process</a> This comes from Section 12 of OMB&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/Analytical_Perspectives">Analytical Perspectives on the Budget</a> which is the explanatory supplement to the Budget itself. The best guide to it is <a target='_blank"' href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2011/assets/list.pdf">List of Charts and Tables</a> where the lead number refers to the Section, with Section 5 being &#8216;Long Term Budget Outlook&#8217; (compare with CBO&#8217;s report with the same title), Section 6 being &#8216;Federal Borrowing and Debt&#8217;, and Section 27 &#8216;Trust Funds and Federal Funds&#8217;. Not exciting reads, but full of good to know information. Under the fold I have extracted from Section 12 &#8216;Budget Concepts and Budget Process&#8217; the portion discussing the difference between &#8216;On-budget&#8217; and &#8220;Unified Budget&#8221; &#8216;.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><a href="http://reddit.com/submit"> <img src="http://reddit.com/static/spreddit7.gif" alt="submit to reddit" border="0"></a> p. 134<br />
<blockquote>Every year since 1971, however, at least one Federal entity that would otherwise be included in the budget has been declared to be off-budget by law. Such off-budget Federal entities are federally owned and controlled, but their transactions are excluded, by law, from the rest of the budget totals, which are also known as “on-budget” totals. When a Federal entity is off-budget by law, its receipts, budget authority, outlays, and surplus or deficit are separated from all other (on-budget) receipts, budget authority, outlays, and surplus or deficit. The budget reflects the legal distinction between on-budget entities and off- budget entities by showing outlays and receipts for both types of entities separately.   </p>
<p>Although there is a legal distinction between on-budget and off-budget entities, there is no conceptual difference between the two. The off-budget Federal entities engage in the same kinds of governmental activities as the on- budget entities, and the programs of off-budget entities result in the same kind of outlays and receipts as on-budget entities. The “unified budget” reflects the conceptual similarity between on-budget and off-budget entities by showing combined totals of outlays and receipts for both types of entities.   </p>
<p>The off-budget Federal entities currently consist of the Postal Service Fund and the two Social Security Trust Funds: Old-Age and Survivors Insurance and Disability Insurance. Social Security has been classified as off-budget since 1986 and the Postal Service Fund has been classified as off-budget since 1990.  A number of other entities that had been declared off-budget by law at different times before 1986 have been classified as on-budget by law since at least 1985.</p></blockquote>
<p>So in examining Table 12-1 we can see that for all practical purposes &#8216;Off-budget&#8217; = Social Security (the Postal Service Fund showing little activity) while &#8216;Total&#8217; Surplus or Deficit = the so-called &#8220;Unified Deficit&#8221;, in quotes because in law there is no longer any such thing, it is just a very convenient reporting number.</p>
<p>Hopefully this will help clear up some rampant terminological confusion, if not fuller explanations are available in the various sections of the Analytical Perspectives.</p>

<p>Exactly a month ago I put up a post <a target="_blank" href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/07/if-social-security-annual-report.html">If a Social Security Annual Report Vanishes into the Forest</a> noting that not only was the Report months overdue but that nobody seemed to notice or care that there was no official announcement about the reasons for the delay or a new release date. The date that had been floated back in April was June 30th, then later some were saying &#8216;July&#8217; and then when July rolled around word around the Capitol was &#8216;August&#8217;. But nobody who knew anything was talking on the record. Then last week of all papers it was the Spokane Spokesman-Review that reported August 5th. But that news was only semi-officially confirmed this week when it was announced that AEI was having a briefing on the Report on Friday the 6th (today) and NASI was having a bigger event on Monday the 9th. But as for any official announcement there was nothing, not at SSA, nor at Treasury or HHS or Labor. Nor was the Report up on the web Thursday morning. It wasn&#8217;t until an hour before official Report release that Labor issued a news release with a link to the pdf of the Report. Well I was ready, a live link to it was up here at 11:22 Eastern, beating the official time by 38 minutes. But all of this leaves this question. Why the secrecy? Three Cabinet Secretaries and the Commissioner of Social Security were scheduled to release a public Report that had implications for every worker and retiree in the country and yet no one knew nothing.</p>
<p>Well the Report appeared and proceeded to make about as little noise as it did when in vanished into the woods, as I type a search on &#8216;2010 Social Security Report&#8217; turns up no MSM links in the top ten, unless you consider HuffPo MSM, and two of the top six results are to my posts here. Now Heritage and the Washington Times (which I don&#8217;t consider MSM) had what appear to be canned pieces up claiming that the Report confirmed their gloomy views but didn&#8217;t seem to address the actual numbers but for the most part there is very little coverage.</p>
<p>Now you can call me a cynic but some of this secrecy  and effective non-coverage may stem from the fact that the Report did not match the current narrative of &#8216;Crisis&#8217;. Instead Trust Fund depletion remained pegged at 2037, the date that cash surpluses vanish moved from 2016 to 2015 while the 75 year actuarial gap actually  dropped significantly from 2.00% to 1.92% putting it right back to 2001 levels. Meaning that a decade of &#8216;Crisis&#8217; has gone by with no action at all and Social Security emerges unchanged. Which leaves all the &#8220;we can&#8217;t afford to wait!&#8221; &#8220;delay will only make the cost larger and more abrupt!!&#8221; folk with a little egg on their faces. Social Security-still not broke.</p>
<p>More notes and an interesting graph under the fold.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/TFw96m_X0gI/AAAAAAAAAY4/Sd4QJkn8vGk/s1600/2010+Fig+IV.B3+TF+Ratios.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/TFw96m_X0gI/AAAAAAAAAY4/Sd4QJkn8vGk/s400/2010+Fig+IV.B3+TF+Ratios.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />For those joining this party late the &#8216;Trust Fund Ratio&#8217; is the Trust Fund balance expressed as a percentage of cost in any even year with the offical target being a TF Ratio of 100, meaning one year of reserves. This is called by the Trustees &#8216;actuarial balance&#8217;. Although we generally talk about THE Social Security Trust Fund, there are actually two, the OAS (Old Age/Survivors) and the DI (Disability) Trust Funds. In this figure OAS is the dark line and DI the light one. Additionally though we also tend to talk about Social Security going deplete in some future year or being able to pay out some percentage of benefits at that date in doing so we are generally referring to what the Trustees call the &#8216;Intermediate Cost Alternative&#8217; in this figure denoted as &#8216;II&#8217;. However they also give us two other Alternatives, a more pessimistic one called &#8216;High Cost&#8217; here &#8216;III&#8217; and a more optimistic one called &#8216;Low Cost&#8217; here &#8216;I&#8217;.  Low Cost and High Cost are fairly artificial in construction as each takes each of the variables that together determine solvency and varies them in the same direction, either better for solvency in the case of Low Cost or worse for High Cost. Since in practice it is not likely that every economic and demographic variable will move in the same direction in the same magnitude these two alternatives have to be regarded as being on the extremes of the probability spread. On the other hand this depends crucially on whether Intermediate Cost has in fact captured the true mean for each variable, if Intermediate Cost can be shown to be on the whole too pessimistic then Low Cost outcomes become more probable, and of course the converse is true. But that will have to be the subject of future posts.</p>
<p>A very common claim about Social Security is that there is no way that we can grow out of &#8216;crisis&#8217;. Well this figure puts that claim in doubt, because while Low Cost may not be totally likely it is at least possible and if it comes about OAS projects to never have a TF Ratio lower than 300, and since the target is only 100 can be said to give a result of &#8216;over-funded&#8217;, if it seems to be coming about then the policy question in the year 2020 will begin to revolve around when to cut FICA and by how much to get that tail pointing closer to 100 than to 450 and rising as it leaves the projection period, Because oddly enough an over-funded Trust Fund is in its own way a bigger threat to Social Security long-term than an under-funded one. (I can point to some older posts on this if anyone cares).</p>
<p>Which brings us to an important point. While it may well be that Low Cost is unlikely, it is not an optimal outcome anyway, instead the sweet spot is somewhere between I and II in this figure and to get there we don&#8217;t have to hit every number of Low Cost, just enough of them in the right magnitudes to pull II&#8217;s tail up so that it intersects 100 at the end of the projection period or at least dips below actuarial balance (the same thing) as far in the future as possible. And many of those numbers are susceptible to deliberate policy choices. For example Social Security outcomes improve with higher immigration and higher fertility, and since immigrants, at least those from developing countries, tend to be more fertile sticking to a policy of closed borders, while maybe appealing to younger Teabaggers in the here and now, plays a certain amount of hell with their future retirement outlook. Equally Social Security solvency is positively correlated with more employment and higher real wage although the effect is offset by the fact that the increased income also results in increased costs in the form of higher benefit checks. But from the perspective of the worker this is all good, it means that any future percentage cut in benefits would be from that much higher a baseline, which means that solvency effects aside a deliberate policy targeting employment and real wage will result in a better Social Security outcome. (Minimum wage increase anyone?). Similarly improvements in productivity, even if they don&#8217;t pass through perfectly to Real Wage, increase affordability by holding down the percentage of GDP needing to be devoted to Social Security, or perhaps assisting us to achieve Prof. Jamie Galbraith&#8217;s appeal to enhance Social Security benefits rather than cut them.</p>
<p>Which suggests  a second prong to the NW Plan. The first prong simply assumes Intermediate Cost numbers and programs in the revenue increases needed to target actuarial balance, the second would be to advocate for policies that make some or all of those tax increments unnecessary. The right answer is not to just passively accept our fate and schedule benefit cuts prematurely, the numbers needed to substantially cut the payroll gap even in the absence of tax increases are by no means out of reach, add a few tenths of a point to productivity and a good deal of &#8216;crisis&#8217; simply vanishes.</p>

<p>Well surprising to me anyway. The 2009 Social Security Report projected a 75 year actuarial gap for combined OASDI of 2.00%. Between the structural change involved in changing the valuation period (as 2009 drops off and a new year 75 is added) and the current recession cutting into revenues I fully expected this gap to edge up. Instead it was revised down to 1.92% putting it back to where it was in 2001. Why the change? Well the following table breaks it down. As always, click to enlarge.<br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/TFr5AygPKZI/AAAAAAAAAYo/mbaa_vEJGVs/s1600/2010+II.D2+Reasons.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/TFr5AygPKZI/AAAAAAAAAYo/mbaa_vEJGVs/s400/2010+II.D2+Reasons.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />Well it wasn&#8217;t because they gamed future economic and demographic projections (except one) the OACT left ultimate numbers unchanged. There were some changes in initial numbers due to high unemployment, but those were offset by changes in the Methods and Programmatic Data. Instead the biggest change is the +.14 due to Legislation offset by the -.06 due to the Valuation period to give our net change of +.08.</p>
<p>And what legislation was that? Health Care Reform. The OACT calculates that HCR will result in dollars being shifted from employer paid health insurance to wages after the Exchanges et al are fully in operation. This seems to rest on an argument from economic theory that has employers setting total compensation at some rate established by the underlying fundamentals and then backing out health care costs from that, with the idea that savings in the latter simply means more of the total flowing to wages. Well personally I have never been convinced by that argument, but in that I am in a decided minority, in particular most of the professional economists I know endorse it. So I guess I&#8217;ll just let it stand.</p>
<p>What are the policy implications of a steady state or dropping year over year 75 year actuarial gap. Well some thoughts under the fold.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />Well the first thing it does is put the &#8220;We can&#8217;t afford to wait&#8221; folk in their place. Take the following table showing actuarial gap by Report year.<br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/TFr_MxECZpI/AAAAAAAAAYw/kKdGO4k_JAs/s1600/2010+VI.B1+Actuarial+Balance+by+year.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/TFr_MxECZpI/AAAAAAAAAYw/kKdGO4k_JAs/s400/2010+VI.B1+Actuarial+Balance+by+year.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />This table is found on page 153 and is accompanied by text explaining the specific changes that went into adjusting the number, but if we back up a bit we can see that after a fairly drastic surge between 1993 and 1994 the actuarial gap has, despite any attempt to adopt policy to address it, has stayed remarkable steady fluctuating around a mean of 2.0%. This is a little odd for two reasons, one is that the change in actuarial period represented here should have something like 0.7% to the accumulated total, that instead if anything that the trend has been modestly down suggest there is something in the model which is too pessimistic, and that this factor or factors, whatever they are, is enough to offset the accumulated change due to valuation period.</p>
<p>But even without trying to identify those factors we can come to a clear empirical conclusion: based on these numbers the clearly superior approach to Social Security (and the last entitlements commission-Kerrey-Danforth) in 1994 has been a plan of &#8216;Nothing&#8217;. Addressing Social Security in 1994 by cutting benefits or raising taxes would have been a straight give away by everyone who was either a worker or retiree in those years, instead all beneficiaries received full benefits and all workers got the equivalent of a 2%+ tax cut. And based on the results of the 2010 Report &#8216;Nothing&#8217; was also a perfectly fine plan for 2009, despite all the hysteria stirred up by &#8220;vanishing surplus, YEARS ahead of schedule, we got to act RIGHT NOW&#8221; the final numbers just show no support for that at all.</p>
<p>Now for those of us who want to avoid any future cut in benefits there is merit in putting in place a contingency plan that would have us move when the numbers actually support it. But those who want to use some theoretical future cut in benefits to justify cutting benefits even sooner are asking workers for a give-away where there is no evidence they need to sacrifice themselves in the face of something that doesn&#8217;t appear to be a crisis at all.</p>
<p>Just as supporters claimed when Bush took a run at Social Security in 2004-2005. Five years later and we are right back at 1.92% of payroll.</p>

<p>Hot off the press. PDF of the 2010 Social Security Report: http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/2010/tr10.pdf</p>
<p>News Release: http://www.ssa.gov/pressoffice/pr/trustee10-pr-alt.pdf HTML version: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/pressoffice/pr/trustee10-pr.htm">Social Security Board of Trustees: Long-Range Financing Outlook Remains Unchanged</a> Boy that title blew me away, as did the initial numbers:<br />
<blockquote>The Social Security Board of Trustees today released its annual report on the financial health of the Social Security Trust Funds and the long-range outlook remains unchanged.  The combined assets of the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) Trust Funds will be exhausted in 2037, the same as projected last year.  The Trustees also project that program costs will exceed tax revenues in 2010 and 2011, be less than tax revenues in 2012 through 2014, and then permanently exceed tax revenues beginning 2015, one year earlier than estimated in last year’s report.  The worsening of the short-range outlook for the Social Security Trust Funds is due in large part to the recent economic downturn. </p>
<p>In the 2010 Annual Report to Congress, the Trustees announced:</p>
<p>The projected point at which the combined Trust Funds will be exhausted comes in 2037 – the same as the estimate in last year’s report. At that time, there will be sufficient tax revenue coming in to pay about 78 percent of benefits.<br />The projected point at which tax revenues will fall below program costs comes in 2010.  Tax revenues will again exceed program costs in 2012 through 2014 before permanently falling below program costs in 2015 &#8212; one year sooner than the estimate in last year’s report.<br />The projected actuarial deficit over the 75-year long-range period is 1.92 percent of taxable payroll &#8212; 0.08 percentage point smaller than in last year’s report.<br />Over the 75-year period, the Trust Funds would require additional revenue equivalent to $5.4 trillion in present value dollars to pay all scheduled benefits.<br />“The impact of the current economic downturn continues to be felt by the Social Security Trust Funds,” said Michael J. Astrue, Commissioner of Social Security.  “The fact that the costs for the program will likely exceed tax revenue this year is not a cause for panic but it does send a strong message that it’s time for us to make the tough choices that we know we need to make.  I applaud President Obama for his creation of the Deficit Commission so we can start the national discussion needed to ensure that Social Security remains a foundation of economic security for our children and grandchildren.”</p></blockquote>
<p> I&#8217;ll be back after I have, you know, actually read some of it (and checked some links).</p>

<p>First and foremost the long-awaited Social Security Annual Report will be released at noon Eastern on Thursday Aug. 5th. If the release holds true to form it will also go live to the web at that same time. I will have a breakout of the Report at my blog <a target="_blank" href="http://bruceweb.blogspot.com/2010/08/2010-social-security-report.html">2010 Social Security Report</a>  or you can get your own copy of the Summary (typically 15 pages) or the Full Report (250 pages) at the SSA Trustees Report page: http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/index.html I will be posting extracted Figures and Tables here at Angry Bear over the next couple of days.</p>
<p>Second a Social Security news site was brought to my attention by its siteowner. It is devoted to the nuts and bolts of Social Security administration with a focus on Disability. Nancy Ortiz, frequent commenter and Social Security veteran tells me she checks it daily. <a target="_blank" href="http://socsecnews.blogspot.com/">Social Security News</a></p>
<p>Third Aug 14th marks the 75th anniversary of Social Security and is celebrated in the new release of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.socialsecurity.gov/policy/docs/ssb/v70n3/index.html">Social Security Bulletin: 75th Anniversary Edition</a>. Of particular note is an article by the Social Security Chief Actuary Stephen Goss <a target="_blank" href="http://www.socialsecurity.gov/policy/docs/ssb/v70n3/v70n3p111.html">The Future Financial Status of the Social Security Program</a> whose abstract is as follows:<br />
<blockquote>This article describes four concepts—solvency, sustainability, shortfalls, and solutions—as they apply to the financial status of the Social Security program as well as how Social Security financing fits in the general federal budget. The little-understood basis for future projected shortfalls is explained and detailed in relation to the possible solutions.</p></blockquote>
<p>A very valuable resource.</p>
<p>Fourth. August is also the normal publication month for CBO&#8217;s Long Term Projection for Social Security. If it is released on schedule it will go head to head with the SSA Annual Report which for the first time allows us a real apples to apples comparison of the respective projections and methodologies without the normal April to August time lag. If so it should be good fun.</p>

<p><strong>“SOCIAL SECURITY POLICY OPTIONS”  JULY 2010</p>
<p>A USER FRIENDLY GLOSS ON THE CBO REPORT</strong></p>
<p>The first thing that strikes me about the CBO report is that the language is unnecessarily negative.  They tell you that Social Security is running out of money.  They tell you this three times in three ways. They don&#8217;t tell you that this means a whole lot less than you think it does.</p>
<p>They say “for the first time since&#8230;1983&#8230;outlays will exceed&#8230;annual tax revenues.”  They don’t tell you that in 1983 the tax was increased exactly so that revenues would exceed outlays, increasing the size of the “Trust Fund,” in order to create a bigger reserve to carry Social Security through times, like the present recession, when outlays exceed revenues.  </p>
<p>It has long been known that through this increased Trust Fund the baby boomers have paid in advance for their own retirement. But CBO just forgets about the Trust Fund and says “starting in 2016&#8230;the program’s annual spending will regularly exceed its revenues.”  Forget about the two and a half trillion dollars the program has in the bank. </p>
<p>CBO tells you that “the trust funds&#8230; will be exhausted in 2039.”  But they don’t tell you that Social Security can go right on paying benefits on a “pay as you go” basis, just the way it was designed to do.  This could require a reduction in the “replacement value” of benefits, but not a reduction in their “real value” as compared to today’s.  The “replacement value” is the amount of the monthly benefit as a percent of the worker’s adjusted average lifetime monthly income. (The “adjusted” income includes an effective interest that is equal to inflation plus the increase in average national per capita real incomes for each the year since the tax was paid on that income.) The reason the reduction would be needed is that the next generation of retirees are  expected to live longer than the last. To avoid a reduction in monthly benefits, the same replacement rate could be paid, over the longer life expectancy, with a payroll tax increase at that time of about 1.9% of payroll for each the worker and his boss.</p>
<p>They do manage to tell you in a footnote that to bring Social Security &#8220;into actuarial balance over the 75 years, payroll taxes would have to be increased 1.6%.&#8221;   This is about eight dollars per week for a worker making 50,000 dollars per year. They are not in a hurry to tell you that there is no need to increase the tax that eight dollars per week today.    There is no need, and much harm in raising the tax too soon.  All it would do would be to increase the Trust Fund&#8230; increase the amount of money that Congress &#8220;borrows&#8221; from Social Security and then blames Social Security when it doesn&#8217;t want to pay it back:  &#8220;you should have taken the bottle away from me. you know I can’t be trusted.&#8221;</p>
<p>The eight dollars doesn&#8217;t need to be paid today.  It can and should be phased in over about forty years.  A rate that would never be &#8220;felt&#8221; as more than 80 cents per week. but would average twenty cents per week per year while incomes were going up an average of ten dollars per week per year. (Again, these amounts are in today&#8217;s money.)<br /><a name="more"></a><br />I don&#8217;t quite know what to do about people who would think that saving an extra eight dollars per week so they can retire &#8220;on time&#8221; is an intolerable burden. And for those who think the eight dollars the boss would contribute is really &#8220;my money,&#8221;  all i can say is, you aren&#8217;t getting it today, so you won&#8217;t miss it if the boss puts it in a savings account for you.</p>
<p>If you work for yourself, and pay both shares, and make near or over the top of the SS-taxable income, you would be looking at an extra 32 dollars per week.  This is not an insignificant amount of money, but it is a good investment as insurance, especially as you will almost certainly get all of it back, with interest, when you retire.  And remember it is 32 dollars out of about 2000 dollars per week&#8230;.or more, depending how much over the cap you earn.  It’s not something you would actually notice unless you obsess about what you &#8220;might have gotten&#8221; by investing, and risking, it on the market.</p>
<p>My guess is that if you are going to make big money on investments, you can find something other than your Social Security money to invest and risk.  Then if the unthinkable happens and your investments fall through, or you become disabled, or your job becomes obsolete, you would still have about 2000 dollars a month (in today’s money) Social Security to live on.  Not a lot by your standards, maybe,  but a hell of a lot better than living out of a dumpster. </p>
<p>CBO tells you that the “gap” between revenues and scheduled benefits is 0.6% of GDP.<br />They don’t tell you that this is not a lot of money to pay for feeding and housing and providing modest comforts for about one fourth of the population. Or that the people getting the benefits will have paid for it themselves.  That is, the people paying the tax will get their money back with interest.  Perhaps they don’t want to have to try to explain “pay as you go” to people who think that money they put in a bank is kept in a locked box for them, growing interest by spontaneous generation.</p>
<p>A lot of people don’t realize that 0.6% is 60 cents out of a hundred dollars.<br />Surely the workers of America can find a better use for that kind of money than to save it for their own retirement.</p>
<p><strong>THE POLICY OPTIONS</strong></p>
<p>Page xi of the summary gives an overview of the effect on the actuarial gap of various policy options.  The chart is poorly labeled.  It is not clear  that the values given are in &#8220;percent of GDP,&#8221;  so you would have to know, for example, that a value of 0.6 on the chart is actually 100% of the actuarial gap.</p>
<p>Then you would have to be careful about reading the policy options.  For example the second option &#8220;increase the payroll tax rate by 2 percentage points over 20 years” actually closes the actuarial gap entirely.   Why then does the third option, &#8220;increase the payroll tax rate by 3% over 60 years, only close the gap by .5%of GDP (which is 83% of the entire gap)?  </p>
<p>The answer is that 2% over 20 years is a full tenth of a percent per year, while 3% over 60 years is a tax increase of half a tenth of a percent per year. This means that after 20 years the second option has raised the tax 2%, while the third option would only have raised it by 1%.  By year 40, when the third option catches up to 2%, the higher tax phased in earlier by the second option would have had its effect on the 75 year gap enhanced by the interest it has been earning from the excess it collected over what was needed to pay expenses in the earlier years.  </p>
<p>On the other hand, by reaching a tax rate of 3% instead of 2%, the third option is much closer to closing the actuarial gap for “the infinite horizon,” which would require a total tax increase of 3.6% over 75 years.  </p>
<p>It needs to be noted that this is the &#8220;combined&#8221; tax, so the workers’ share would be half a tenth of a percent per year in the second option, or half of a half of a tenth of a percent per year in the third option.  In today&#8217;s terms that amounts to about 40 cents per week per year for the second option, and 20 cents per week per year for the third.  These are not staggering burdens.</p>
<p>As it turns out, these increases &#8220;only&#8221; balance the trust fund for 75 years.  To balance SS over the &#8220;infinite horizon&#8221; would require that the second option be run for about another 17 years, or the third option would need to be extended for another 15 years.  A better answer would raise the tax one tenth of a percent whenever the Trustees report &#8220;short term actuarial insolvency.&#8221;  This would average one fourth of one tenth of one percent per year (about twenty cents per week) for each the employer and the employee for 64 years and would leave SS fully paid for, and fully &#8220;funded,&#8221; able to pay all benefits for the &#8220;infinite future,&#8221;  with no reason to anticipate a need for further tax raises after that time.</p>
<p>So when you look at the other policy options, you need to keep in mind that what you are being asked to do is to substitute another &#8220;solution&#8221; for part or all of the staggering cost of twenty cents per week per year for the workers to pay for their own benefits.</p>
<p>In this regard, you could:</p>
<p><strong>RAISE THE CAP</strong><br />Eliminate the taxable maximum (the cap), raising the tax on people making over 106,800 a year by 12.4%.  These are people who would not expect to benefit from Social Security.  You can see why they might think this is a poor idea  compared to raising the tax of the people who will actually get the benefit by one fourth of one tenth of one percent per year.</p>
<p>Or you could raise the cap to cover 90% of earnings.  This would raise the tax on some, but not all, income over 106,800 by 12.4%, and would save the workers about one third of that one fourth of one tenth of one percent per year.  This is about six cents per week for the workers who get the benefits vs about 24 dollars per week, or 1200 dollars per year,  for each ten thousand over the current cap, on a worker who will not see any benefit.  Sounds like great politics.</p>
<p><strong>CUT BENEFITS</strong></p>
<p>Or you could cut benefits.  CBO offers a variety of options. which save the worker from 3 cents per week to 20 cents per week, at the cost of cutting his retirement benefit (in today&#8217;s terms) from about a thousand dollars a month (note: &#8220;month&#8221;) to about 700 dollars a month, or even to 500 dollars a month.  Talk about your penny wise, pound stupid.</p>
<p><strong>RAISE THE RETIREMENT AGE</strong></p>
<p>Or you could  raise the retirement age to 70.  this will save the worker 10 cents per week per year.   If you can&#8217;t imagine what having to work an extra 3 years would do to someone with a hateful job, or declining health, declining physical or mental abilities, or a life expectancy somewhat shorter than what we are being told &#8220;we&#8221;&#8230; mostly the rich and well fed and lightly worked&#8230; can &#8220;expect&#8221;,  you need to do some serious thinking. That future old person might be you.  Or, if you can imagine this, your child:</p>
<p>“Here my child, my darling, I saved you ten cents per week.  Only now that you are old, you have to work another three years to pay for it.”  “But dad, my arthritis!  But dad,  I really wanted some time for myself before I have to go to the old folks home.”</p>
<p>But hell, what do you care?  So what if the cop that answers your 911 call is seventy years old.  No doubt the guy with the gun breaking in downstairs will be seventy too.</p>
<p><strong>AND IN CONCLUSION</strong></p>
<p>The last paragraph on p xii  invites another kind of stupid thinking. It is true that gradually phased in tax increases will have a bigger lifetime effect on younger workers than older workers.  But younger workers are going to be making a lot more money and living a lot longer.  The phased in tax will actually proportion the larger share of the tax increase to those who will get the most benefit from it&#8230; by living longer in retirement at a higher standard of living. </p>
<p>The question you should be asking yourself is not, &#8220;Will I get a few tenths of a percent better or worse deal than my parents?&#8221; but, &#8220;Will I be getting a good value for my money?&#8221; The answer is that yes you will.</p>
<p>You are paying for insurance&#8230;  an insurance policy that will pay you if you get disabled, pay your family if you die, pay you enough to retire if you otherwise reach old age without enough to retire on, and pay you back everything you paid in, with interest, if you are among those lucky enough to earn near the top of the income ladder  for a whole lifetime.  </p>
<p>What pays for this magic insurance is the difference between what the high earner &#8220;might have&#8221; gotten on his &#8220;investment&#8221; and the &#8220;average increase in wages&#8221; over his lifetime. That high earner will have plenty of other money to invest to chase those higher returns at higher risk.</p>
<p>Judge it as an investment and you miss the point that it is insurance.  Judge it as welfare and you fail to understand that the workers pay for it themselves. It was deliberately designed NOT to be welfare.</p>
<p>I have only covered the Summary.  But this is a good place to stop for now.  Looking ahead, what I see is more clever writing that never lies exactly, but is carefully designed to lead you to arrive at false conclusions and hurt yourself, or stand silently by while they hurt your children</p>

<p>(My God, can we get any more jargony and wonkish? Well &#8220;Si, Si, Puede!&#8221;)</p>
<p>When the Greenspan Commission was convened back in 1982 Social Security scoring started and stopped with the SSA Office of the Chief Actuary who are also tasked with researching, compiling and presenting the Annual Report for review and signing by the Trustees, many of whom may not have any relevant training. OACT is by statute and tradition a professional and non-partisan group of technocrats. Sometime after 1983 the role of scoring Social Security started being shared with the Congressional Budget Office, also by statute and tradition a professional and non-partisan group of technocrats. What is more CBO formally agrees to accept OACT demographic projections. So you would expect the top line numbers of both to come in pretty close alignment in regards to Trust Fund Depletion. Well you would be wrong, CBO and OACT have in the past seen pretty wide variations in dates of TF depletion and total actuarial gap. Now in the past decade or so this didn&#8217;t matter much because even the Bush push for Social Security reform never made it as far as the legislative process, to my knowledge no bills were submitted, meaning no official CBO scoring. Moreover in the normal course of events there was enough lag between the reporting by SSA and CBO that the divergence between them could go unnoticed since neither stayed in the news past a news cycle or two anyway.</p>
<p>Well this year is different. We have a presidential Deficit Commission which has already announced a focus on &#8216;Entitlements&#8217;, including Social Security, and are prepared to make a recommendation in December, which recommendation if passed through the Senate was last week guaranteed a vote by the House. Meaning that this year the question of scoring is going to come to the fore, in selecting a package of SS &#8216;reforms&#8217; whose score is going to have the final say? I put this question to a panel of experts with decades of experience and while some gave me pretty definitive answers the consensus was &#8220;Bruce, that is an awfully good question.&#8221;</p>
<p>Report geekery below the fold.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />The two main sources of Social Security scoring are the Annual Reports of the Trustees of Social Security, normally released on March 31st and available <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/index.html">here</a>, and CBOs Long Term Projection for Social Security, normally released in August and available <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cbo.gov/publications/bysubject.cfm?cat=11">here</a>. This five month gap normally results in SSA numbers being internalized in the MSM, with few reporters or columnists noting the difference, with a major exception of Dean Baker, who for a variety of reasons tends to go with CBO numbers.</p>
<p>Well a funny thing happened this year, the Social Security Report did not come out on March 31st, it didn&#8217;t even come out on the semi-official revised date of June 30th, and Treasury refuses to commit to a firm date even now, with the best guesses on Capitol Hill suggesting sometime in August. Now there is no reason to suggest that CBO will experience a similar delay they came out with their Long Term Budget Outlook (which has a Social Security component) on time and also released a scoring of thirty different <a target="_blank" href="http://cboblog.cbo.gov/?p=1142">Social Security Policy Options</a> on July 1st. So best available information as of this minute is that we will have two dueling Reports coming out head to head right in time to inform the decision making of the Deficit Commission.</p>
<p>So which one rules? Well we got an interesting hint in an article (interesting in itself) detailing some internal strife in SSA between Commissioner Astrue and Chief Actuary Steve Goss published in the NYT on July 11: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/11/us/politics/11benefits.html?_r=1&#038;hpw">Lawmakers Defend Social Security’s Chief Actuary in Clash With Commissioner</a>. The following two sentences jumped out at me (bolding mine):<br />
<blockquote>Mr. Goss’s responsibilities have suddenly increased. Leaders of a presidential commission seeking ways to reduce the federal budget deficit said they would rely exclusively on his estimates to measure the financial effects of proposals to overhaul Social Security</p></blockquote>
<p> Which suggests that for the Commission&#8217;s purposes when it comes to Social Security and  Medicare CBO is locked out. But can they equally lock out CBO when it comes time to other spending and tax suggestions? Can they just agree to look at one part of a data table while ignoring another that mentions Social Security?</p>
<p>And  whatever the Commission decides what happens when the package hits Congress? In 1983 there was no CBO long term scoring of Social Security, and a Congressional staffer who worked on the legislative package confirmed to me that at least House Ways and Means and probably Senate Finance relied exclusively on OACT. Then again they didn&#8217;t have a lot of choice. But in 2010 we know from observation of the Stimulus and HCR legislative process that budget bills BY RULE live or die based on CBO scoring.</p>
<p>To which some people will suggest that it doesn&#8217;t matter much, after all the 2009 Social Security Report put the long-term gap at 0.7% of GDP while the most recent CBO scoring puts it at 0.6% of GDP. On the other hand the gap between the 2009 SS Report and the 2010 looks to have stretched out by 15 months (May 13th to mid-August) and performance of Social Security, particularly on the Disability Insurance side, was MUCH more miserable than expected, we can expect OACT to bump that 0.7% up a bit. Moreover each 0.1% of GDP represents maybe 0.3% of covered payroll, no one should be surprised to see CBO scoring the 75 year gap at 1.6% of payroll and OACT at 2.2%, this would simply mirror the similar gaps we saw in the respective 2008 and 2009 reporting.</p>
<p>Why is this gap important? Because a lot of the options on the table score right in that .2 of GDP/.6% of payroll gap between CBO and probable SSA, a package of three fixes designed to meet SSA scoring could be revised to two fixes and still meet the requirements of CBO, a seemingly balanced package coming out of the Commission could be transferred to an unbalanced, and based on history even more worker-unfriendly one, by Congress using CBO numbers to say strip out a cap increase proposal in favor of one focusing entirely on benefit cuts.</p>
<p>There may be little in this world more geekish than focusing on the fine points of CBO vs OACT scoring. But that doesn&#8217;t mean it is not important. Your future retirement may rest on which way this one leans.</p>

<p>In 2003 CBO published an Issue Brief illustrating the relative contribution of Aging and Real Benefit Growth to future Social Security spending called <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/43xx/doc4380/07-01-SocSecAging.pdf">The Future Growth of Social Security: It’s Not Just Society’s Aging</a> with results graphed above:.</p>
<p>Discussion under the fold. <br /><a name="more"></a><br />
<blockquote>Approximately 55 percent of the higher spending is due to an expected increase in the number of beneficiaries, as the number of new claimants grows and as life expectancy rises. The Social Security trustees estimate that the population age 65 or older will increase from 37 million today to 75 million in 2035 and to 95 million in 2075. <br />Life expectancy for people currently age 65 is estimated to be 83 years. In 2035, it is estimated to be 85 years, and in 2075, 87 years. <br />The remaining 45 percent of the rise in spending is due to a projected increase in the real value of Social Security benefit checks. Under the trustees’ assumptions, the purchasing power of the average earner’s benefits at retirement is expected to nearly double between now and 2075.Source: Congressional Budget Office. </p></blockquote>
<p>This increase in purchasing power is the result of adjusting initial retirement benefits by real wage increases over the worker&#8217;s lifetime. The end result is that retirees share in both the upside and downside of economic growth, if Real Wage for workers is stagnant so do will be initial benefits, if on the other hand workers gain Real Wage increases in line with the traditional relation found between Productivity and Wage (something that broke down some the last decade) then the rising tide really will lift all boats.</p>
<p>A couple of further notes. If retirement benefits are projected to increase in real terms by close to 100% over the next 75 years, then a projected cut of 20-25% on Trust Fund exhaustion would STILL see those future workers with larger baskets of goods than similarly situated retirees (this is what we call &#8216;Rosser&#8217;s Equation&#8217;).</p>
<p>But this real term increase doesn&#8217;t come at the expense of younger workers still in the work force, at least not without some forced special pleading. The goal clearly shown in Fig 2 is to keep overall replacement values steady with each future generation just able to hold onto its share of the overall societal increase. This seems fair to me.</p>
<p>There are some that insist that if you &#8216;really&#8217; look at the numbers you will see that Social Security was simply too generous to earlier generations. How you reconcile this with these graphs showing that each generation will be able to afford a bigger basket of goods than their predessessor would seem difficult. Because arguments from ROI (but I could have had EVEN MORE, and screw Grandma) seem pretty hard-hearted and selfish. But perhaps someone can make the moral case in comments.</p>

                                <p>and nobody notices, did it really disappear?</p>
<p>by Bruce Webb</p>
<p>I started reading the Annual Report of the Trustees of Social Security in 1997 and awaited its typical March 31st release date each year since with eager anticipation. To the point that last year I put up a post that morning called <a target="_blank" href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2009/03/bestest-day-of-year-ssrr-day.html">Bestest Day of the Year: SSRR Day</a> where &#8216;SSRR&#8217; stood for &#8216;Social Security Report Release&#8217;. Well people mocked, and rightfully so, because SSRR Day 2009 didn&#8217;t happen until May 1st. The delay, though not quite explained, was explicable, on typical SSRR Day only two of six Trustees was actually confirmed.</p>
<p>Well flash forward to 2010. A year older and perhaps a little wiser, and wary from being pwned the year before I put up the following post on Mar 21 heralding the impending release: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/03/upcoming-attractions-in-social-security.html">Upcoming Attractions in Social Security</a>, putting it in the context of the new Obama Deficits Commission while warning that the 2009 Report had been delayed. Well a helpful informant advised me that the word was that it would be delayed until April, and then on April 5th it was announced widely that Report Release would be June 30th. Oddly none of this was official, the news just got out in typical Beltway fashion.</p>
<p>Come mid June I started referencing the new, new updated release date only to be notified by three different knowledgeable sources that word was out that Report Release would be delayed yet again, perhaps until August. And just like with the 2009 Report the explanations advanced were not unreasonable. But none of them were official, to my knowledge no one has at any point officially announced even the fact that the Report would be delayed (and delayed and delayed) beyond its statutory release date, and still less given an official explanation.</p>
<p>I find this odd in the extreme, particularly since Social Security is front and center in the news with the ongoing meetings of the Catfood Commission with their strong suggestions that cuts to Social Security are definitely on the table. You would think that repeated delays in the release of this key Report would at least require SOME explanation and that someone in the media might be asking questions. But no like the proverbial tree falling in the forest no one was close enough to hear the sound. If any. Well the silence is deafening. The lead press item on the Social Security website is the news that Isabella is the number one name for baby girls this year. http://www.ssa.gov/ Which I guess is fascinating news for fans of the Twilight franchise but not quite satisfying for us data driven types.</p>
<p>When the Report does come out it will appear on the following page: http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/index.html (and interestingly the page was updated this weekend to include &#8216;2010&#8217; as a choice for &#8216;Publication Year&#8217;. As of this moment neither clicking on the Summary or total Report button gets you to anything, but the fact that the page was changed at all is fascinating Certainly I&#8217;ll be checking back regularly.) But the delay still remains inexplicable.</p>

<p>In response to my Pelosi Rule post of yesterday commenter Darms plays Devil&#8217;s Advocate in asking the following shrewd question.<br />
<blockquote>Bruce,    Since the commision may be looking for a mechanism to delay redemption of those SS trust fund bonds and I&#8217;ve read that some of these bonds are routinely redeemed &#038; renewed each year, would that not provide those on the commission with an excuse to cut SS funding now even though the actual problem is not until 2030 or beyond? In contrast to your thesis above? Possible quote come December &#8211; &#8220;Yes, we know the problem w/SS funding won&#8217;t be upon us for decades but we have to defund SS now as paying off this year&#8217;s (&#038; next thru 2015&#8217;s) maturing SS trust fund bonds is pushing this deficit to unmanageable levels!!! You lame ducks have to support this NNOOOWWWWW!!!!! Thanx Nancy!&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p> Well the answer is that &#8220;They will try, unfortunately budget scoring rules totally undercut their argument&#8221;.</p>
<p>To see why this should be we need to revisit the concepts of &#8216;debt&#8217; and &#8216;deficit&#8217; as they relate to Social Security reporting and CBO deficit scoring, the numbers just don&#8217;t move in the way you think they would. Discussion under the fold.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />We start with the Social Security Trust Funds (there are two, more on that later). Currently the combined OASDI Trust Fund holds $2.5 trillion in Special Treasuries. These make up the majority of the $4.5 trillion in &#8216;Intragovernmental Holdings&#8217; which in turn are scored as a portion of total &#8216;Public Debt&#8217;. The latter needs to be distinguished from &#8216;Debt Held by the Public&#8217; which is all Treasury debt held by entities other than the Treasury itself. The balances of Debt Held by the Public, Intragovernmental Holdings, and total Public Debt can be checked at the Treasury&#8217;s handy Debt to the Penny web application: http://www.treasurydirect.gov/NP/BPDLogin?application=np . As of close of business Thurs these were $8.6 tn, $4.5 tn for a total of $13.1 tn. So for this purpose the Trust Fund Balances for Treasury score as part of Public Debt.</p>
<p>But seen from the perspective of CBO and OMB those balances are simply the sum of a set of SURPLUSES since 1983, in each of those years the increase in Trust Fund assets, scoring as a debt to Treasury, scores for budget purposes as a REDUCTION to the deficit.</p>
<p>Back to the Trust Funds. Contrary to the belief of some the Special Treasuries in the Trust Funds have specific rates and maturities, if the funds they represent are not needed to meet cost they are rolled over. Since neither the maturing bond nor its replacement actually has to be financed out of the public market, principal redemption results in no  change to either debt or deficit. Interest is a little different. Interest accruing to the current TF balances that is not needed to meet current cost is credited to the TF in the form of new Special Treasuries. These add to Intragovernmental Holdings and so are scored as in increase in Public Debt to Treasury.</p>
<p>But the Treasury Secretary is also ex officio the Managing Trustee of Social Security, and while he is wearing that hat that same increase in debt scores as an increase in assets to Social Security, and in an odd twist score the same way at CBO, interest on the TF is added to any cash surpluses from taxation to make up total Social Security &#8216;surplus&#8217; which is then deducted from any General Fund deficits to generate the top level number we generally recognize as &#8216;the deficit&#8217; (as in Obama is on track for a $1.5 tn deficit in 2010).</p>
<p>Lets pause for a second, because this is totally counter-intuitive. How can interest transformed into Special Treasuries but not actually financed from public markets ever be considered an offset from real world cash deficits? What happens if Social Security goes cash flow negative as revenue from taxes dips below total costs and a portion of interest has to be paid from the General Fund in cash? Are you telling me that the remaining interest STILL counts as surplus for the top line deficit number!??</p>
<p>Yep. And we won&#8217;t even get into how it is treated by OMB for Budget purposes.</p>
<p>Which gets us most of the way towards answering Darms Devil&#8217;s Advocacy. First if Social Security is in overall surplus, meaning all income INCLUDING interest is in excess of costs, there is no effect on either debt or deficit to roll over TF principal, that is a wash. In this scenario any excess interest scores as new debt to the Bureau of Public Debt but as a surplus to both Social Security AND CBO, it serves to reduce deficits and not increase them.</p>
<p>Although combined Social Security projects to be in a state of &#8216;surplus/primary deficit&#8217; in 2010 and 2011 with receipts from taxation failing to meet cost and a portion of TF interest having to be paid in cash, it will still be showing up in CBO scoring as a surplus on the top line number. And it is actually projected to return to &#8216;surplus/primary surplus&#8217; from 2012 to 2017. Meaning that in 2015 Social Security will neither in accounting terms or in actual cash flow be contributing to the deficit at all, in fact it will still be offsetting it.</p>
<p>Now in theory the Commission could act to increase this offset by slashing current benefits between now and 2015, that would serve to boost TF balances and yearly surpluses, that is increasing debt while cutting deficits, but there are no proposals on the table to actually do so, even Alan Simpson, currently taking the hardest public line would exempt workers 60 and older from any near term benefit cuts, meaning no savings until at least 2017, and most other proposals out there would not effect at least initial benefits for workers 55 and older (viz Ryan Roadmap) meaning no top line savings until 2022.</p>
<p>The Commission can enact changes to Social Security benefit ratios that limit its share of GDP and also the dollar amount of its so-called &#8216;unfunded liability&#8217; over the 75 year window. What they can&#8217;t do is make changes that will help them achieve their mandate of reducing the deficit to 3% of GDP by 2015, at least under CBO scoring rules.</p>
