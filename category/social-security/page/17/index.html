<blockquote>Everyone,</p>
<p>    Over the weekend, eight of us who worked on the Greenspan commission drafted a joint written statement (attached and pasted below.)<br />We have just submitted it to the Budget Committee.  We are hoping it gets as wide a distribution as possible.  In that regard, if any of you are able to post it on your web sites, and get it in the hands of bloggers, reporters, etc., I and the other signatories would really appreciate it.</p>

<p>(Update: the below now available as an linkable online Doc: http://docs.google.com/View?id=dc36qc9g_1crqqnpdt )<br />STATEMENT OF<br />STAFF TO THE 1981-83 NATIONAL COMMISSION<br />ON SOCIAL SECURITY REFORM</p>
<p>HEARING ON BIPARTISAN PROCESS PROPOSALS<br />FOR LONG-TERM FISCAL STABILITY</p>
<p>THE BUDGET COMMITTEE<br />U.S. SENATE</p>
<p>NOVEMBER 10, 2009</p>
<p>Chairman Conrad, Ranking Member Gregg, and Members of the Committee:</p>
<p>This statement represents the views of eight individuals who helped craft and secure the enactment of the Social Security Amendments of 1983.[1]  Those amendments, which followed the recommendations of the National Commission on Social Security Reform (the so-called Greenspan commission), eliminated Social Security’s then-projected short-range and long-range shortfalls.  Our involvement with the Commission’s work may provide useful insights into the advisability of using a commission or task force to eliminate, as part of an effort to control the overall federal deficit, the long-range shortfall now being projected for Social Security.  Social Security’s current projected shortfall, it should be noted, is much less immediate and severe than the shortfall Congress eliminated twenty-six years ago.    </p>
<p>Fast-Tracking Social Security Legislation Is Unprecedented</p>
<p>An expedited procedure, which limits debate and prohibits all amendments, would be unprecedented: Since its enactment in 1935, Social Security legislation has always had the benefit of (1) full hearings before the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee; (2) executive sessions which provided all members the opportunity to offer amendments; (3) unlimited debate and opportunity for amendments in the Senate; and (4) debate and amendment in the House of Representatives, consistent with its rules.  This was the procedure that was followed in the enactment of the Social Security Amendments of 1983, which eliminated the then-projected Social Security deficit. </p>
<p> Throughout Social Security’s long history, advisory councils have been used frequently to recommend changes.  Congress has always used the normal legislative process when considering those recommendations.  The normal legislative process was followed in 1983, when Congress considered the Greenspan commission recommendations.   Indeed, the decision to raise the retirement age was the result not of a commission recommendation, but of an amendment offered by Representative J.J. “Jake” Pickle (D-TX) during consideration of the legislation on the floor of the House of Representatives.</p>
<p>The Greenspan Commission Succeeded Because of its Broad, Diverse Composition</p>
<p>In addition to recommending that the normal legislative process be employed, we advise that any task force or commission that is established with respect to Social Security be broadly representative, including members from business, labor, and the general public.  This was the composition of successful Social Security advisory councils and commissions of the past, including the Greenspan commission.    </p>
<p>Part of the success of the Greenspan commission was its diverse membership, which included the then-President of the AFL-CIO, Lane Kirkland; four business leaders, including the then-President of the National Association of Manufacturers, Alexander Trowbridge; a leading advocate for the elderly, then-Congressman Claude Pepper (D-FL); and a leading women’s advocate, former Congresswoman Martha Keys (D-KS).   We believe that good public policymaking demands that any Social Security task force or commission be broadly representative of labor, business, seniors, women, and other groups vitally affected by Social Security.</p>
<p>Base Closure and Realignment Commission Analogy Overlooks Fundamental Differences  <br />Those who advocate a fast-tracked procedure for reform of Social Security and other entitlements frequently invoke the example of the Base Closure and Realignment Commission (“BRAC”).  The political context and constitutional structure of BRAC, however, are completely different.   Because the national interest in closing unnecessary bases was in sharp tension with preventing the adverse and localized economic consequences of closing a particular base, success depended on all members agreeing to elevate national interest over local interest   This posed a classic prisoner’s dilemma: If only some members acted in the national interest and against the localized interest of those they represented, while others acted solely in defense of their localized interest, the ones acting in the national interest would “lose,” because the national interest would be defeated but their local interest would not be protected.   Consequently, without a mechanism to require everyone to act in the national interest, the natural tendency would be to engage in logrolling, forming alliances to prevent one’s own base from being closed, and the obvious result would have been that no base would be closed.  BRAC provided a mechanism which permitted escape from this prisoner’s dilemma.  An impartial expert panel determined which bases to close and Congress agreed in advance to accept the entire package of recommendations unless a majority of both Houses objected in a single up-or-down vote.    </p>
<p>In stark contrast to base closings, where local and national interests may diverge, local and national interests are aligned perfectly with respect to Social Security, because every state and every district includes beneficiaries and FICA-paying workers.  Consequently, every member of Congress has comparable interests and concerns, though, of course, they may differ on principles and preferences.  Those principles and preferences should be open to full unrestricted deliberation in the Congress.  Members have been elected to apply their principles and preferences to hard decisions; a commission with responsibility over Social Security, where its recommendations are considered under expedited procedures with no power to amend, improperly shifts responsibility and shields members from accountability.</p>
<p>In the case of the base closings, Congress could have simply provided guidelines and delegated the decision to the Department of Defense.  Instead, Congress chose to retain greater control and accountability by establishing a commission and preserving the power to reject, on an all-or-nothing basis, its determination.   Unlike the decision about which specific bases to close, Congress lacks the constitutional authority simply to delegate the decision to change Social Security’s income or outgo.  Exercise of the power to tax and spend under Article I of the Constitution requires that Congress itself, not a delegate of Congress, make the relevant decisions and take full constitutional responsibility for them, together with full accountability.    </p>
<p>Establishing a commission and considering its recommendations under expedited, extraordinary rules blurs accountability and therefore breaches the spirit of that basic principle of constitutional accountability.  History shows that Social Security reform can take place through the normal legislative process, without recourse to extraordinary arrangements.  We witnessed it in 1983. </p>
<p>Social Security’s Vital Importance to the Nation Requires Public Accountability</p>
<p>Because Americans in the last year have lost trillions of dollars in home equity and retirement savings, it is more important than ever that Social Security reform be addressed in the sunshine.   Social Security today provides an economic lifeline more crucial than ever to the millions who receive its benefits and the millions more who are insured in the event they, or workers on whom they depend, lose wages as a result of disability, premature death, or old-age.  In 2009, more than 52 million people are receiving monthly benefits, including 33 million retired workers, 2.4 million spouses or divorced spouses of retired workers, 4.4 million aged widow(er)s, 7.7 million disabled workers, and 4.1 million children of deceased, disabled or retired workers. </p>
<p>Our brave soldiers wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan receive Social Security benefits, as do their spouses and children, and so do the families of soldiers who have given their lives in defense of the nation.  Though little noted, Social Security continues to provide benefits to the families of those who lost their lives in the 9/11 attacks.   Its benefits &#8212; which are crucial to the vast majority of its beneficiaries and the communities in which they live and spend &#8212; are modest by any measure.  Indeed, average benefits are less than what is paid for full-time minimum-wage work.  Nor is there waste: the program is efficient, returning in benefits more than 99 cents of every dollar collected in income. </p>
<p>The importance of Social Security demands that proposals for change receive careful consideration, with public participation through its representative groups, so that the implications of all changes are closely examined and clearly understood.  Any kind of expedited procedure would be a disservice to the American people.</p>
<p>Social Security, Currently in Surplus,  Is Not Part of the Deficit Problem</p>
<p>Moreover, there is no need for hasty action with respect to the program.  Social Security is currently in surplus.  According to the 2009 Annual Report of the Board of Trustees, published May 12, 2009, Social Security ran a surplus of $180 billion last year and had accumulated a reserve of $2.4 trillion.   (Even excluding the interest income, there was still a surplus of $64 billion.) [2]    The Trustees’ Report projects that Social Security’s accumulated reserve will continue to grow until about 2024,[3] and, the program can continue to pay full benefits until 2037 to the millions of children, disabled workers, retired workers, and spouses (including widowed and divorced spouses) dependent on those benefits.  Indeed, the most recent projections of the Congressional Budget Office, published in August, forecast that full benefits can continue to be paid until 2043.  Consequently, Congress has the time to undertake careful, deliberate action through the normal legislative process.</p>
<p>Social Security Is Already Prohibited under Current Law from Deficit Spending</p>
<p>Though few realize it, Social Security already contains an automatic built-in trigger to restore it to balance, if it should ever have insufficient assets to cover scheduled benefits.   The law prohibits Social Security from paying any benefits with respect to which it has insufficient revenue.  Consequently, if at any point in the future, it has insufficient revenue to cover the costs of benefits, those benefits will be automatically reduced, without any action by Congress.</p>
<p>Social Security Helped the Country Avoid a 1930s-Style Depression</p>
<p>The recession that almost turned into a depression holds lessons for the future.  The banking and financial systems almost collapsed, requiring unprecedented federal help.  Millions of Americans lost trillions of dollars in private pension wealth.  In fortunate contrast, Social Security proved rock solid, providing guaranteed benefits that help offset lost earnings and stimulate the economy by maintaining purchasing power.   Hidden in the shadows of the unemployment and foreclosure statistics of the 1930s were elderly parents dependent on and living with adult workers.    That added suffering has been largely avoided today, thanks to Social Security.</p>
<p>For all these reasons, while we support efforts to bring the federal deficit under control, we urge members of this Committee and all members of Congress to refrain from employing a fast-tracked procedure for Social Security, and instead allow Congress to consider Social Security legislation through the normal procedure which has resulted in successful legislation in the past.[4]</p>

<p>[1] Seven of the eight signatories of this statement served on the staff of the Greenspan commission.  Nancy J. Altman, J.D. served as executive assistant to Alan Greenspan, who chaired the Commission;  Merton C. Bernstein, LL.B.., Coles Professor of Law Emeritus, Washington University, served as principal consultant to the Commission; Suzanne M. Blouin served as executive assistant to Robert J. Myers who was executive director of the Commission; Elizabeth T. Duskin served as Senior Staff Adviser to the Commission; Lori L. Hansen served as technical adviser to Commission Member Robert M. Ball; Eric Kingson, Ph.D., Professor of Social Work, Syracuse University, served as policy advisor to the Commission; and Bruce D. Schobel, FSA, served as staff actuary to the Commission.  The eighth signatory of this statement is Patricia E. Dilley, J.D., LL.M, Professor of Law, University of Florida, who served as professional staff to the Subcommittee on Social Security of the Ways and Means Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives from 1981 to 1987, and worked closely with the staff of the Greenspan commission.</p>
<p>[2] While Social Security is in surplus with or without inclusion of its investment income, we believe that the investment income should be treated identically to all other sources of income.  Some have argued that Social Security’s investment income should be ignored because it involves inter-fund transfers which are not shown when the federal budget is displayed on a unitary basis and are irrelevant for the limited exercise of macroeconomic analysis.  In contrast, we believe that in determining the financial status of Social Security, it is illogical to exclude its investment income, which has been a source of Social Security revenue starting in 1937, and is dedicated, by law, to the exclusive use of its beneficiaries.<br />[3] See footnote 2.<br />[4] We have limited our statement to Social Security, but many of the same arguments apply to other programs, such as Medicare.   It too is vitally important to the nation, has lower administrative costs than private insurance despite its coverage of the most expensive part of the population, and has rising costs primarily as a result of the same pressures that are driving up the nation’s health care costs, private as well as public.  Like Social Security, it has never been subject to an expedited fast-track procedure.  The only reason to subject it to one seems to be simple avoidance of accountability.</p>

<p>The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nasi.org/usr_doc/Fixing_Social_Security.pdf">National Academy of Social Insurance</a> report on options for Social Security is public and now available in pdf form. &#8220;The purpose of this report is to help analysts and policymakers consider options to bring Social Security into long-term balance in ways that also address concerns about benefit adequacy.&#8221; </p>
<p>One cannot simply glance through such dense material and numbers, but I did find the following on page 14 (or actually page 20 of 44 pdf form). (the exact numbers have been changed from the proposal by NASI, but are faithful to the process):  </p>
<p>From page 14:<br />
<blockquote>Option #7c: Schedule a Very Gradual Contribution Rate Increase Over 20 Years. To avoid abrupt changes in Social Security contribution rates, this option would schedule very gradual increases in the Social Security contribution rate (one-twentieth of one percent per year over 20 years for employees and employers, each), beginning in 2015. By 2035, the Social Security rate would be 7.2 percent for both workers and employers. In 2015, the increase for an average earner making $53,085 then would be $26.50 a year, or about 50 cents a week. It would reduce the 75-year deficit by 1.39 percent of taxable payroll or by about 69 percent. Dale Coberly, a frequent commenter on Social Security, recommended a gradual tax increase of this sort (Coberly, Larson and Webb 2009).11</p></blockquote>

<p>Like many contributors not in the spotlight the hours devoted to creating material to even be noticed, then evaluated, and then published is a testimony to hard work, due diligence, and a non-profit motive. The weekend hours and midnight oil burned by NASI personnel and contributors is rarely noticed by media, nor appreciated by recipients.  Many of us talk about &#8216;they&#8217;&#8230;.well, meet three.  Best to Bruce, Dale, and Arne.</p>

<p>If you click on the Social Security link in the upper left sidebar you are sent to an index page on my website which in turn links back to an extended series of posts here at Angry Bear starting in May of 2008. Something that apparently a reader did this morning leaving the following comment:<br />
<blockquote>Larry said&#8230;<br />I&#8217;d greatly appreciate an update, given the latest revenue numbers, which show outlays exceeding income at least for the time being.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well I left an extended reply there but thought I would supplement it with a brief version here. (Well it didn&#8217;t turn out brief, sorry.)</p>
<p>It is quite possible that 2009 and 2010 will see Social Security go cash flow negative in that they will take in a little less in cash via payroll tax and tax on benefits than they will pay out in benefits. Whether this is a problem or not depends on your views about the Social Security Trust Fund. Legally Social Security has roughly $2.5 trillion dollars in assets which in turn represent about 20% of total U.S. Public Debt. Under the law Social Security is on an equal standing with all other creditors who have lent money to the U.S. and expect to get it back based on Full Faith and Credit of the United States. Now there are some valid questions about whether the U.S. can sustain a Public Debt load that is as of last Friday $11,920,519,164,319.42 and projected to grow at $1 trillion a year for the next 10 years. On the other hand people who are using legalisms to tell you that somehow the $2.5 trillion of that $11.9 trillion that is owed to current workers and retirees is in a junior debt position to the $800.5 billion owed to China are blowing smoke. Legally, morally and even more important electorally the claims of American workers and retirees are if anything better than those of the Chinese Central Bank.</p>
<p>There are people who will make earnest claims that one branch of government cannot owe money to another branch. There is no legal basis for that claim, it is a simple exercise in logical hair splitting. The reality is this. A major part of total American income has been tapped to pay out retirement benefits to workers and to build up a reserve to continue those pay outs for future retirees. The excess dollars have been borrowed on behalf of all Americans including those who gain their income from sources not exposed to this particular source of taxation. Those people, whose incomes range from the lower six to the upper eight digits, by and large don&#8217;t want to pay those dollars back and have hired people to manufacture reasons to convince people making five digit incomes or less that America as a whole simply can&#8217;t afford to pay that money back and that the lower 95% or so of Americans just have to lump it and accept that as a lost cost. Well we don&#8217;t have to lump it and have at our disposal democratic means that ensure that the the six to eight digit people pay back their fair share of the money that we all borrowed. Unless of course we fall for the spin being presented by the paid spinners at the Concord Coalition, Cato, and American Enterprise Institute. (And those were not chosen at random, they are the collective headquarters of the War on Social Security).</p>
<p>So my answer to Larry is: We have $2.5 trillion dollars backed by the Full Faith and Credit of the United States in the Social Security Trust Funds. Those dollars are currently earning around $110 billion in interest this year which is more than enough to cover what may be a $5 billion or so shortfall in tax income this year and potentially more next. Social Security is still running large surpluses and Trust Fund balances will continue to increase until around 2022 and then start shrinking until they fall under a 100% reserve around 2026 en route to running out totally by 2037. If we want to maintain full scheduled benefits after 2037 we need to make minor changes in revenue either starting immediately or when Social Security falls out of Short Term Actuarial Balance (which the Trustees define as not having a 100% reserve in each of the next 10 years). But unless you simply discount that $2.5 trillion dollar balance and the interest it earns to zero a cash flow shortfall representing less than 1% of total outlays for Social Security is absolutely nothing to worry about. And those who earnestly tell you different are liars, thieves or people deceived by the liars and thieves.</p>
<p>(BTW some of the liars are some of the nicest people you will meet. Just as people who are paid to represent rapists and murderers may be nice people in person. That doesn&#8217;t mean that their goals are benign. So feel free to substitute &#8216;paid advocate&#8217; for &#8216;liar&#8217; if you like, it doesn&#8217;t change the substance.)</p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/politics/bal-md.briefs251sep25,0,4964906.story">Balt Sun: Obama picks Carolyn Colvin for SSA Deputy</a><br />
<blockquote>President Barack Obama has chosen Carolyn W. Colvin of Maryland to be deputy commissioner of Social Security, the White House announced Thursday. Currently special assistant to Maryland&#8217;s transportation secretary, Colvin was Montgomery County Health and Human Services director until her dismissal by newly elected county executive Ike Leggett in November 2006. She previously served as a deputy commissioner at the Social Security Administration and is a member of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare and the National Forum for Black Public Administrators.</p></blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t know anything about Colvin except that she perviously served as Deputy Commissioner for Programs and Policy in at least 1997, i.e. under Clinton. Here is a policy statement from her then: http://www.nls.org/passssa.htm.</p>
<p>Here is the SSA Org Chart: http://www.ssa.gov/org/ssachart.pdf In it you can see there is a Deputy Commissioner in the Office of the Commissioner which you could call &#8220;The&#8221; Deputy Commissioner and then 13 Divisions for various operational and policy areas, nine of them headed by a Deputy Commissioner for &#8216;X&#8217;. Colvin is being slotted into the actual number two slot which naturally on this org chart is listed as &#8220;Vacant&#8221;.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know the implications. That she served in the Clinton era SSA is a mixed bag, that she is currently a member of NCPSSM is a good sign for supporters of traditional Social Security. And it is also good that she has a background as a line administrator as opposed to an academic background. Less likely to let policy get blinded by pretty theories.</p>

<p>Summary from Director&#8217;s Blog <a target="_blank" href="http://cboblog.cbo.gov/?p=342">CBO’s Long-Term Projections for Social Security: 2009 Update</a><br />Full Report: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/104xx/doc10457/08-07-SocialSecurity_Update.pdf">Long-Term Projections for Social Security: 2009 Update</a></p>
<p>This newest report on the long-range health of Social Security shows a shape not much changed from last year&#8217;s but with some changes in the detailed dates and numbers. Per this report Social Security will be able to pay out &#8220;scheduled benefits&#8221; until Trust Fund exhaustion in 2043 and thereafter will be able to pay out &#8220;payable benefits&#8221; at a rate starting at 83% of scheduled benefits and then gradually sinking to 78% by 2083. Even after adjusting for inflation benefits after 2043 will be better than retirees get today in real terms even though they will be a smaller replacement percentage. That is our children&#8217;s retirement will be materially better than that of their grandparents if not quite keeping up with the working life gains of their own grandchildren. And this even if we don&#8217;t fix Social Security along lines suggested by the <a target="_blank" href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/05/nw-plan-for-real-social-security-fix.html">Northwest Plan for a Real Social Security Fix</a>.</p>
<p>If we did decide to fix Social Security on the revenue side we are faced with a gap scored by CBO of 1.3% of payroll compared to the 2.0% SSA score. That is where the NW Plan, based as it is on the more conservative SSA number, would have a year two increased tax of around $1.50 per week for the median income household, under CBO numbers that would be down to just around a $1.00. (If anyone is interested in seeing why CBO and SSA come up with these different scores please consult App. B on pages 33-34.)</p>
<p>Important note. CBO figures typically show the 80% probability band, meaning there is a 10% chance that outcomes will be more positive and an equal chance they will be more negative. That is when examining Figure 1 above note that there is a small chance that Social Security will actually self-fund without changes even within the 80% band (the medium blue area of overlap) plus a small chance that it would even be overfunded once you add in the upper 10%. Also note that this distribution is somewhat stricter than many where a 90% band would be more typical.</p>

<p>I haven&#8217;t posted on Social Security for a while for a pretty simple reason. Nothing has been going on. Until today when Social Security released the following Policy Brief: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.socialsecurity.gov/policy/docs/policybriefs/pb2009-01.html">Distributional Effects of Raising the Social Security Taxable Maximum</a>.<br />
<blockquote>This policy brief analyzes the effects on taxpayers and Social Security beneficiaries of either eliminating the taxable maximum (tax max) for Social Security or raising it to a level so that 90 percent of all Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI)–covered earnings would be subject to the payroll tax. Under both scenarios it is possible to either calculate benefits based on the current-law tax max (no max and max 90) or to credit the new taxable amounts toward benefits (no max plus benefits and max 90 plus benefits).</p></blockquote>
<p> Historically Social Security had tapped the top 90% of income. Due to the skewing of income we have seen over the last couple of decades that percentage is down to about 84%. Various plans including LMS and the Obama preliminary plan have suggested adjusting the cap upwards, with or without a donut hole, either to the traditional 90% level or following Medicare with no limit at all. Additionally there has been debate whether this cap increase should be accompanied by additional benefits. This study finally, thankfully puts some numbers in play. Those interested should read the whole thing. The current projected payroll gap is 2.00%. An increase to a 90% level with no increase in benefits, which is in the range of what both LMS and the Obama cap increases propose, fills only about half of the gap. On the other hand extending FICA to all income with no increase in benefits backfills the whole thing. Personally I still favor the Northwest Plan that would leave the capp unchanged, but for those who would like to play mix and match here is your opportunity. (The tables are easier to read in the HTML version, these are copied from the PDF).<br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SnCIDEbKLaI/AAAAAAAAARs/kYVi3qpZtpc/s1600-h/Cap+increase+proposals.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SnCIDEbKLaI/AAAAAAAAARs/kYVi3qpZtpc/s400/Cap+increase+proposals.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>

<p>(Social Security is chapter 3)</p>
<p>(Update) Not a lot of meat here. CBO offers two outlooks for Social Security, one which projects a payroll gap of 1.33% (extended baseline) and another 1.54%. (alternative fiscal scenario). The former assumes that the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts sunset on schedule and the AMT is not indexed for inflation, the latter assumes the opposite. In any event either is below the Trustees&#8217; current law projection of 2.00%. Meaning the cost of the Northwest Plan would be adjusted down by a third or a quarter respectively.</p>

As the percentage of people of retirement age doubles so does the amount of GDP needed to house and feed them! Hmm, what the hell is wrong with that? Retirees not having to shuffle up to the table to beg for scraps? Getting their proportionate share of GDP? The horrors!</p>

<p>And for the privatizers out there, be sure to compensate for the fact that 36% of benefits goes to survivors and disabled workers when calculating your ROI.</p>

<p>Just read the whole thing.<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://writ.news.findlaw.com/commentary/20090521_buchanan.html">The 2009 Social Security Trustees&#8217; Report: Good News Behind the Headlines</a></p>
<p>I could not agree more with Prof. Buchanan&#8217;s conclusion.<br />
<blockquote>While there is some talk of returning to address Social Security&#8217;s finances after we fix healthcare costs, it at least appears likely that we will not overreact to the annual trustees&#8217; report by deciding to spend valuable legislative resources on a relatively (or perhaps completely) healthy program while other, more pressing problems languish.</p>
<p>At this point, the best that we can hope is for Congress and the President to focus on bringing healthcare costs back under control. If they can accomplish that, they will not only save Medicare but they will also find that Social Security is a program that – although it must of course be carefully monitored – need not be a legislative priority.</p>
<p>Neil H. Buchanan, J.D. Ph. D. (economics), is an Associate Professor at The George Washington University Law School, where he teaches tax law and policy.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>by Bruce Webb</p>
<p>In comments Andrew Biggs claims that the <a target="_blank" href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/05/nw-plan-for-real-social-security-fix.html">NW Plan</a> does not actually eliminate $15.4 trillion in unfunded Social Security liability but instead leaves a 1% payroll gap over the Infinite Future. I have no reason to suspect his math but do suspect he doesn&#8217;t fully understand the mechanism.</p>
<p>The Northwest Plan ultimately is a response to long term uncertainty in the projections. Under CBO&#8217;s most recent projections the payroll gap for Social Security is about half of that projected by SSA (1.06% to 2.00%). If the schedule of tax increases set forth in the spreadsheet was set in stone this would mean that if actual economic performance came in in line with CBO then Social Security would over the long term be overfunded, which oddly enough would be a very, very bad thing for Social Security, something I pointed out in installment ten of the AB Soc Sec Series <a target="_blank" href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/05/bw-on-soc-sec-x-danger-of-low-cost.html">The Danger of Low Cost</a>. The NW Plan avoids this by monitoring the tail of the valuation period. For example under 2009 OASDI Trigger the projected Trust Fund ratio remains remarkable steady from around 2062 to 2080 but then takes a mild but noticeable dip to the end of the projection period. If this trend persists as we change valuation periods with the 2010, 2011, and 2012 Reports it might trigger another increase in the mid 2090s. On the other hand if it reverses we might have to push the 2074 increase forward a bit. If it turns out that CBO is more right than SSA this might mean canceling one of the intermediate year cuts and stretching the rest out some, or alternately reduce the amount of the increase in one or more of the scheduled.</p>
<p>In any event we can always adjust the schedule so that the TF ratio result in the new year 75 always remains between 100 and 300 and as such eliminating unfunded liability over that period and so for some extended period beyond.</p>
<p>I suppose someone could take 2009 OASDI Trigger and extend it from 2082 to 2109 and so capture all the potential costs for &#8216;past and current participants&#8217; and so show that the pace of needed increases after 2082 is such that the people of 2062 should consider changing the benefit formula. On the other hand our bigger policy need in the 2060&#8217;s might be planning how to relocate NYC and the whole state of Florida to higher ground. The very uncertainly inherent in future outcomes mitigates against too much prior planning.</p>
<p>The NW Plan eliminates unfunded liabilities because it sets up a mechanism similar to that under which the Fed predicts inflation, with the advantage that SSA will always have a 75 year planning window. If unfunded liability starts creeping back into the picture 20, 30, or 40 years from now the Dales, Bruces and Arnes of that era can deal with it. There is no reason to assume a priori that they will be more feckless than we are and that events occurring decades after our own deaths are our responsibility. This plan if adopted gives us quite powerful assurance that the Social Security car will still have plenty of life left in it 76 years from now. Good enough for me.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t step in the Voodoo.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2009-05-28-debt_N.htm">Leap in U.S. debt hits taxpayers with 12% more red ink</a><br />
<blockquote>Yhe latest increase raises federal obligations to a record $546,668 per household in 2008, according to the USA TODAY analysis. That&#8217;s quadruple what the average U.S. household owes for all mortgages, car loans, credit cards and other debt combined.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a huge implicit mortgage on every household in America — except, unlike a real mortgage, it&#8217;s not backed up by a house,&#8221; says David Walker, former U.S. comptroller general, the government&#8217;s top auditor.</p></blockquote>
<p> It is nonsense like this that explains why the Northwest Plan for a Real Social Security Fix is better than my previously preferred plan of &#8216;Nothing&#8217;, it helps to shut Peterson stooges like Walker the hell up.</p>
<p>What Walker is telling us via USA Today (which near as I can see did no &#8216;analysis&#8217; at all, just parroting the &#8216;Fiscal Wake-up Tour&#8217; message instead) is that if you add the the current value of all US debt, add to that projected costs of Social Security, Medicare and military pensions you come up with a total of $63.8 trillion which if divided by the number of CURRENT households gives you a total of $546 thousand. This is a meaningless number for any number of reasons. One it implicitly defines &#8216;household&#8217; as &#8216;current household and any future households stemming from it&#8217;, that is if you have four kids your ultimate per household burden will be a quarter of that. Plus this calculation ignores all future households stemming from future immigration and of course households stemming from them. It is a junk number. But rather than try to demonstrate the absurdity of the logic and the arithmetic lets just make a big chunk of that debt go away.</p>
<p>If the NW Plan was enacted into law tomorrow $15.4 trillion in &#8216;unfunded liability&#8217; would vanish from the books. Poof! With no money down and easy payments starting in 2010. Which is better than any mattress deal out there.</p>
<p>Social Security and the CBO score future liability on a current law basis, change the law you change the score. Lets take three different households. The first is a household making median household income of $50,000. The second is a household with a single earner making the average income of $40,000. The third is a one person household where the worker is earning $12.50 an hour. Under the NW Plan the first household would pay $1.50 more in taxes per week by the second year, the second household $1.20 cents, the third household 75 cents with no further changes in tax rate until 2026. That is all it would take to wipe almost a quarter of that $63.8 trillion off the books.</p>
<p>Because it is all just word games. Under current law the Federal Government is required to pay Social Security benefits on the established schedule as long as it has money coming in to pay for it. But if the dedicated revenue stream falls short of that Congress is fully empowered to change that current law. Is the Federal Government really on the hook for $15.4 trillion in unfunded liability for Social Security? Well under current law as of June 1, 2009 yes. After passage of the NW Plan not. Or for that matter after passage of some &#8216;Bi-Partisan&#8217; Commission recommendation not. Trying to equate a current law projected liability into an actual measure of future household debt is just Voodoo Arithmetic. Because at some point Congress will move to add funding to current law or change the current law benefit schedule and in doing so will make that $15.4 trillion dollar &#8216;unfunded liability&#8217; vanish like smoke.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t fall for the hype. Normal households don&#8217;t budget that way. Unless you plan to starve to death you have an unfunded liabiliity for all the food you are going to eat between now and your projected mortality date. If you rent you have an unfunded liability for the cost of keeping a roof over your head. Ditto for your utilities, your clothes, your entertainment. For that matter your real unfunded liability for your car, mortgage and credit cards is far above the face value of the loan balance, absent a Lotto victory you are far more in debt than your current balance sheet shows. But what is important is your carrying costs. Can you make rent and car payments and buy groceries and entertain yourself while paying down your principal balance on your revolving debt? Well then you are fine. That doesn&#8217;t mean you don&#8217;t need to look down the road at things like future college bills or retirement income, it is that if you do you will probably look at it in terms of your monthly income, can I afford to set aside X hundred dollars a month to pay for Suzie&#8217;s education, or maybe to save up for the down payment on that new bass boat?  After that it is just a matter of making payments out of current income.</p>
<p>So people have a choice regarding Social Security. Do you want to lay awake at night wondering how you can possibly come up with your share of $15.4 trillion? Or just roll over thinking &#8220;Well I think I can find an extra buck and a half a week in the next two years and a buck or so more per week per year in 2026. Why am I even worrying?&#8221;.</p>
