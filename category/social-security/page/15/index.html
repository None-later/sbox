<p>I mention from time to time that I talk with a number of D.C. policy types about Social Security, but mostly don&#8217;t use names because the conversations are officially off the record. Well a group of them, spearheaded by Roger Hickey&#8217;s folks at Campaign for America&#8217;s Future, have gone on the record in a big way and moreover want you to join in and comment on their new blog <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ourfuture.org/features/virtual-summit-fiscal-and-economic-responsibility">The Virtual Summit for Fiscal and Economic Responsibility</a></p>
<p>The blog launched yesterday with a piece by Dean Baker, who as those of you who follow this topic has been a key defender of Social Security for years, being notably ahead of the curve when he and colleague Mark Weisbrot published <a target="_blank" href="http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/035468.html">Social Security: the Phony Crisis</a> in 1999, and another by Congressman John Conyers, plus contributions by Bill Scher and Dave Johnson of CAF (Dave also being a veteran of the &#8216;There is No Crisis&#8217; movement of 2005) and Barbara Burt of the Frances Perkins Center (Perkins being FDR&#8217;s Labor Secretary and so the foster mother of Social Security).</p>
<p>I have been asked to contribute and will from time to time. So for those who have been asking when supporters of Social Security were going to get organized and push back on the Peter G Peterson contingent in a public way, well the answer was &#8216;yesterday April 20th, 2010&#8217;. Be there.</p>

<p>Well this is a response to a question in the Rivlin thread. There are widespread misunderstandings about what if anything makes up the &#8220;IOUs&#8221; in the Trust Funds, with many people thinking they just have artificially low rates (and so obviously underperforming theoretical private accounts) or just are open-ended loosey-goosy commitments to maybe pay the money back someday. Well that is not how it works at all on a monthly basis. So with no further ado here they are:<br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/S8Cnq47yV5I/AAAAAAAAAXI/s4oWWQOs13s/s1600/2009+OAS+Assets.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/S8Cnq47yV5I/AAAAAAAAAXI/s4oWWQOs13s/s400/2009+OAS+Assets.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />As always click to enlarge. Some notes under the fold.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />First thing to notice is that these are the assets of the OASI or Old Age/Survivors Insurance Trust Fund, there is an entirely different set of assets in the DI or Disability Insurance One.</p>
<p>Second thing is that there are a range of yields from Certificates as low as 2.750% and Bonds as high as 7.250% with maturities ranging from 2008 to 2022.</p>
<p>Third is that this table gives you a snapshot of two moments in time, year-end 2007 and year-end 2008. A slot marked by &#8220;&#8211;&#8221; in the 2007 column indicates a bond that was issued in 2008 and so obviously did not exist in Dec 2007, similiarly a slot marked by &#8220;&#8211;&#8221; in the 2008 column indicates a bond category that was redeemed during the course of the year</p>
<p>Okay some observations. The instruments with the lowest rates were mostly issued in 2008, which is perfectly in line with the yields in Regular Treasuries in that time period. Contrawise the ones with the highest rates represent mostly 10 year bonds issue eight or nine years ago, once again in line with market conditions then. Note too that with one except every slot that shows zero in 2008 after showing a positive number in 2007 has a face maturity of 2008, these bonds matured and were honored by Treasury, no muss no fuss, just the same kind of routine re-financing you see in the Regular Treasuries.</p>
<p>But there was one interesting exception, the Treasury also redeemed the 3.500% 2009 a year ahead of time, which points out two facts, one that these securities are redeemable at any time, while as we see they are typically held to maturity, in a time of need the Treasury can and will tap them, and too that the Treasury at least in this case did so in the way that best preserved the fiscal health of the Trust Fund, presumedly they could have saved some interest by cashing in the remaining 7.000+% bonds instead.</p>
<p>The Social Security Trust Funds are not investment funds, that is not their purpose, but neither are they simple slush funds designed to separate out workers from their wages. I argue a times that there is something odd about certain details of the actual reporting, but as to daily operations and general management the Trustees have over the years lived up to their titles.</p>

                                <p>Nothing sinister. The Social Security and Medicare Annual Reports are released together each year because each interacts deeply with the other. The new Health Care Reform law significantly changes Medicare and so the Obama Administration decided to update its numbers to match the new reality. Which makes sense. But expect opponents to mount a hissy fit about Obama &#8216;hiding&#8217; something.</p>
<p>Because that is what they do.</p>

                                <p>The 2010 Social Security Report is due out any day now and I thought I could lay some groundwork for a number based discussion of its implications. Starting with changes to the 75 year projection over time.</p>
<p>1996-2.19%<br />1997-2.23%<br />1998-2.19%<br />1999-2.07%<br />2000-1.87%<br />2001-1.86%<br />2002-1.87%<br />2003-1.92%<br />2004-1.89%<br />2005-1.92% <br />2006-2.02%<br />2007-1.96%<br />2008-1.70%<br />2009-2.01%<br />2010-??<br />Each Report Year the Trustees give an estimate of how much payroll tax would have to go up immediately to deliver Long Term Actuarial Balance, meaning full payment of scheduled benefits and a Trust Fund with a one-year reserve at the end of the 75th year. In this post I want to explore the reasons why this number can go either up or down over the course of a single year, sometimes in a pretty dramatic manner, how can one Report Year whip the tail by as much as +/- 10%? Geekiness under the fold.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />The first thing to understand is that the bias in this number by rights should be upwards for two reasons. Consider 1998, in point of fact we did nothing in the faces of a 2.23% actuarial gap from the previous year, meaning that extra dollars were not collected and so contributed neither principal or interest to the Trust Fund, all things being equal this should have added to the cost of an ultimate fix, because as &#8216;everyone knows&#8217; the longer we wait the more any fix is going to cost. Well the numbers show that not to be true, in the face of inactivity the total cost can actually go down, why that is to be explored a little later. The second cause for an upward bias is the result of the change in valuation  period, in 1998 what had been year 1, that is 1997 dropped off, and what had been year 76 became the new year 75 and so got included. And the Trustees tell us that change alone will add 0.06% to the gap. Meaning that if we were 100% confident in our modeling we would expect to see an uptick in that amount each and every year.</p>
<p>Well a single glance at this time/number series shows that we are not justified in that confidence, when people claim that the Trust Fund &#8216;will&#8217; run dry in 2037, what they mean knowingly or not is &#8216;if every bit of our methodology is correct and so too all of our economic and demographic assumptions about the future&#8217;. Well obviously we don&#8217;t know what is going to be happening in 75 years, or even 10 years. For that matter only a handful of people not named Baker or Schiller were predicting this years economy even 3 years ago.</p>
<p>This uncertainty is fully recognized by the professionals in the SSA Office of the Chief Actuary, a fact that is shown in three ways. First the numbers above are drawn from is known as the Intermediate Cost alternative, the OACT also provides a more optimistic Low Cost alternative, and a more pessimistic High Cost alternative to present a range of possible outcomes. Second the OACT doesn&#8217;t pretend to be able to predict future business cycles after the first ten years, instead all of their economic number series under all three alternatives settle out into what are called the Ultimate values, and finally the OACT shows its work in the form of Sensitivity analyses and Stochastic projections that show how those outcomes vary in response to changes to individual variables and in light of past variations, all of which are published in the Annual Report.</p>
<p>Which leads me to my first conclusion here: Infinite Future is Hooey. Given the probabilistic variation revealed even over the medium term and particularly given that an outcome that shows the system fully funded over the 75 year period (which is the result of Low Cost), and given the substantial uncertainties in even year over year projections as revealed above trying to influence policy by an &#8216;Unfunded Liability&#8217; over the &#8216;Infinite Future Horizon&#8217; is not just misguided, it is thoroughly dishonest. Particularly given the time series.</p>
<p>In 1997 Social Security could still reasonably be said to be in crisis, the 2.23% projected actuarial gap had been steadily increasing over the few years before just as you would expect from a crisis left unaddressed, the fact that the system had finally reached a Trust Fund ratio of 100 in 1993 and so met the short term test did not mean the whole program was out of the woods, as long as the actuarial gap was ticking upwards there was good reason to &#8216;Save Social Security First&#8217;, after all under then current projections the Trust Fund would go to zero in 2029.</p>
<p>Well a funny thing happened, starting in 1998 the gap, even in the face of inactivity started to drop, in the first year just a little but in 1999 and 2000 by a lot, 10% improvement per year in a 75 year outlook. And it was in response to this that Dean Baker and Mark Weisbrot published <a target="_blank" href="http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/035468.html">Social Security: the Phony Crisis</a> and I developed my own plan for Social Security which I cleverly dubbed &#8220;Nothing&#8221;. In 2000 Greenspan was happily assuring us that via the miracle of the Great Moderation we had conquered the business cycle and we could enjoy 3% productivity and 4% Real GDP forever. Numbers that if correct were far better than the ones of Low Cost which showed Social Security vastly overfunded going forwards.</p>
<p>Which leads to a second conclusion. When it came to Social Security the Bush Administration was thoroughly dishonest from the start, they promoted their tax cuts based on a set of economic numbers that if they had actually come about would have saved Social Security along the way. Yet they willfully ignored the number series above and convened a Social Security Commission that still relied heavily on the rhetoric of crisis and &#8216;we can&#8217;t afford to wait&#8217;. Well the hell we couldn&#8217;t, the ways the projected numbers were moving during Bush&#8217;s first term there was positive evidence that a short term policy of &#8220;Nothing&#8221; was in fact optimal.</p>
<p>As noted at the outset the natural bias in this series in the face of inactivity is upwards due to theoretical taxes not collected in the previous year combined with the built in increase due to change in actuarial balance. Leaving aside the specific reasons for changes in projections from year to year the fact that four years of inactivity from the time Bush was elected in 2000 to his re-election only increased the actuarial gap by 0.02% and even at that was down by 0.03% from the previous year made the whole Social Security Tour of Spring 2005 itself throughly dishonest. These numbers show clearly why &#8220;There is No Crisis&#8221; was a relatively easy campaign to win, our side had the numbers.</p>
<p>Well except one. In 2003 a new measure of Social Security solvency suddenly appeared in the Reports, instead of measuring the payroll gap over the standard 75 year window, the Trustees would add a new number projecting Intermediate Cost over the Infinite Future Horizon. Now given the existing probability range over even the first 75 years and the rapid changes in outlook seen since 1997 this was more akin to witch magic than anything, but it produced a very useful number on its own. All of a sudden the President&#8217;s Men could point away from a number that was under 2% and on balance shrinking and to a number that was almost twice as high at 3.5%. And they needed a number that high and badly because of something I pointed out in an adage coined in 1997:</p>
<p>&#8220;If privatization is necessary, it won&#8217;t be possible. If privatization is possible, it won&#8217;t be necessary.&#8221;</p>
<p>For movement Republicans the real Social Security crisis was that it existed in the first place. But due to its general popularity a head-on assault was thought politically impossible, so in order to sell their ideologically preferable system of Private Accounts they were forced to play the solvency crisis card, and to present the better returns on equities as being the key to the solution. Unfortunately for them there were three problems here. One their models assumed traditional returns on stocks, which in turn required growth rates in line with historical trends, which rates if sustained were significantly better than those projected under Intermediate Cost assumptions. Hence the ditty above. A secondary problem is that along side their ideological commitment to Private Accounts was their even stronger commitment to tax cuts which had been sold on claims that such cuts would boost productivity. If tax cuts had actually worked as advertised then Social Security would have been saved from crisis along the way. A third problem was structural, any move from traditional Pay-Go Social Security to self-funded Private Accounts had to somehow handle the transition costs. And there was no way to do that at a cost to the worker that would not exceed the 1.89% payroll gap. Which would reasonably lead an informed worker to ask &#8220;Exactly what is in this for me that I should take this extra risk when I could just except the tax increase and guarantee a 100% benefit?&#8221;</p>
<p>And there was no answer to that in 2005, even the use of a 3.5% Infinite Future number didn&#8217;t rescue the calculations, there was no numerically based challenge to the proven plan of &#8220;Nothing&#8221;. To see why we have to look a little deeper at the numbers and what I call &#8220;The Cost of Inactivity&#8221;.</p>
<p>In 2001 the process of actual shrinkage in actuarial gap stalled. There is some reason to believe that this stalling was deliberately engineered so as not to make the sales job for private accounts even harder than it was. People in a position to know on both sides of the issue insist that deliberate manipulation of the numbers in the Report is impossible, but both Prof. Rosser and an originally skeptical Arne took a hard look at the internals of the data tables and numerically if not practically the case is pretty solid. But either way a steady number as seen from 2001-2005 is an irrefutable argument for &#8220;Nothing&#8221; for two reasons. One the same performance numbers that drove down and then kept steady the actuarial gap also moved the date of Trust Fund exhaustion out in time, between 1997 and 2005 the date of depletion had been pushed out from 2029 to 2042. Not only had that date been moving at more than a year per year, suggesting that the event itself would never happen, it was being pushed out past the point of maximum Boomer demographic impact, a close look at the numbers show that the thirty or so years after mid-century will be relatively easy on Social Security as it handles a cohort of Gen-Xers that is numerically smaller than the Boomers that will have moved off the stage and the still working Millennials behind. In 2005 the case for simply waiting out &#8216;Crisis&#8217; was excellent. Because every year of inactivity meant the functional equivalent of a tax cut in the amount of the fix not applied.</p>
<p>Well the case for &#8220;Nothing&#8221; got more problematic with the gyrating numbers from 2006-2009 and what is likely to be a disappointing number for 2010. Which is why I moved off &#8220;Nothing&#8221; to support the &#8220;NW Plan&#8221;. But in any event it is important that all decision making on this be driven by the numbers and not by slogans. And that means digging into the data tables and not relying on the MSM to bring you the news. Hopefully this post will help you cut through the spin certain to be coming down the road in the next couple of weeks after Report release.</p>

                                <p>by Bruce Webb</p>
<p>And I could add honest definitions and honest framing to that.</p>
<p>In Dec 2005 three former staffers to Bill Clinton, John McCain and GW Bush respectively released the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hks.harvard.edu/jeffreyliebman/lms_nonpartisan_plan_description.pdf">Liebman-MacGuineas-Samwick Non-Partisan Social Security Reform Plan (9 pg PDF)</a> or LMS. The authors proposed a package of changes to Social Security comprised of a 1.5% across the board payroll tax increase, an adjustment of the payroll gap back to the 90% level (it had drifted down to 84%) for the equivalent of another 1.0% of payroll, and adjustment in retirement age scored at 0.62% of payroll, and a change in indexing of initial benefits that scored at 2.08% of payroll for a total worker financed &#8216;fix&#8217; of 5.2% of payroll. Interestingly enough in that year the total 75 year actuarial gap was scored at 1.92% of payroll, meaning that an immediate hike of that amount would deliver 100% of scheduled benefits over the 75 year window traditionally used to score Social Security solvency. So why a 5.2% solution to a problem scored 1.92%?</p>
<p>Well therein lies a tale, and an important one when we are faced with a so-called Deficits Commission whose leaders make it clear that Social Security is front and center, as workers and future retirees we owe it to ourselves to understand what problem &#8216;reformers&#8217; are actually addressing. Because LMS at least is not focused on retirement security, not at least in the dollars and cents sense. Much more under the fold. (It wouldn&#8217;t hurt to bring along your tin-foil hat).<br /><a name="more"></a><br />My first introduction to LMS came the summer before publication when co-author Prof. Andrew Samwick outlined it in a guest post at DeLong. In the course of discussion he casually claimed that the payroll gap was 3.5%. When in comments I asked &#8220;Whence 3.5% Samwick?&#8221; and pointed to the standard 1.92% 75 year number reported by the Trustees, both he, and by e-mail DeLong, informed me that he was referencing the gap projected over the Infinite Future Horizon and pointed to Table IV.B7 in the Report.  Well sure enough alongside the $3.5 trillion dollar 75 year gap was a $10.5 trillion Infinite Future one.</p>
<p>Well I had been reading and comparing Trustees Reports since 1997 and never heard of such a thing, was I just a sloppy reader? Well no, it turns out this particular measure was relatively new having been introduced with the 2003 Report. Why was it so introduced? And why should we prefer it to the previously satisfactory 75 year window? Well a tale within a tale. From the Report, bolding mine<br />
<blockquote>Consistent with practice since 1965, this report focuses on the 75-year period from 2003 to 2077 for the evaluation of the long-run financial status of the OASDI program on an open group basis (i.e., including both current and future participants). Table IV.B7 shows that the present value of open group unfunded obligations for the program over that period is $3.5 trillion. Some experts, however, have described the limitations of using a 75-year period. Overemphasis of summary measures (such as the actuarial balance and open group unfunded obligations) for the 75-year period can lead to incorrect perceptions and policy that fails to address sustainability.<br />In order to provide a fuller description of long-run unfunded obligations of the OASDI program, this section presents estimates of obligations that extend to the infinite horizon.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hmm, &#8220;some experts&#8221;, &#8220;incorrect perceptions&#8221;, &#8220;address sustainability&#8221;. What the heck is sustainability in context? Why should workers care? Got a name for any of those experts or an explanation of why an alternate perception that focuses on outcomes within our own lifetime and not on retirement of people not yet born is somehow &#8220;incorrect&#8221;? Why so? Well I suggest that the answer is that retirement security for current workers is simply not the focus of these unnamed &#8220;experts&#8221;, and that somehow the Trustees in 2003 rather silently adopted that same focus for reasons unstated.</p>
<p>Returning to LMS. In the description of the authors we get the following, once again bolding mine:<br />

From 2003 to 2004, he was Chief Economist on the staff of President Bush’s Council of Economic Advisers, where his responsibilities included Social Security.</p></blockquote>
<p> Well &#8220;responsibilities&#8221; is a broad term, but you would expect that an implicit change in the focus in Social Security from 75 year solvency to Infinite Future &#8216;sustainable solvency&#8217; might suggest the involvement of the CEA Chief Economist, and certainly Samwick qualified as an &#8220;expert&#8221;, but Prof Samwick has informed me personally that he was not in fact responsible for this particular change. And Andrew is a truly nice guy and is often described along with Bruce Bartlett as one of a small number of &#8220;honest conservative economists&#8221; by people like Brad DeLong, still it is interesting to me that the introduction to LMS starts off with these sentences:<br />
<blockquote>The three of us – former aides to President Clinton, Senator McCain, and President Bush – did an experiment to see if we could develop a reform plan that we could all support.  <br />The Liebman-MacGuineas-Samwick (LMS) plan demonstrates the types of compromises that can help policy makers from across the political spectrum agree on a Social Security reform plan. The plan achieves sustainable solvency through progressive changes to taxes and benefits, introduces mandatory personal accounts, and specifies important details that are often left unaddressed in other reform plans.</p></blockquote>
<p> So while Prof. Samwick was maybe not the engineer here, he certainly was willing to board the train in time to draft LMS.</p>
<p>To which we return once again with an examination of Table 2 on page 7 along with this accompaning text:<br />
<blockquote>Sustainable solvency is achieved – The Social Security actuaries find that actuarial balance would improve by 2.14 percent of taxable payroll over the 75-year projection horizon. The current Social Security deficit is 1.92 percent of payroll.  Therefore, the changes in the plan would lead to a 0.22 surplus.  Trust fund balances in the last year of the actuaries’ projection period are positive and increasing.   (See http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/solvency/Liebman_20051117.pdf).</p></blockquote>
<p> Okay we have a 1.92% payroll gap and a 2.14% solution, reasonable enough. But what was this about a 5.2% solution? Where is the extra 3.06%? Well 1.56% percent of it is accounted for in the Table, that amount gets diverted to a new PRA, Private Retirement Account, leaving us missing only 1.5%. And where is that? Well buried in the text on page 1, LMS proposes a mandatory deduction of 1.5% credited directly to the individuals PRA and so not properly speaking contributing to Actuarial Balance and so excluded from Table 2.</p>
<p>Well I have to cry foul here. We have a problem scored 1.92% and a solution that includes a package of tax increases totaling 2.5% between the across the board increase and the payroll cap increase, that is more than enough to deliver 100% of scheduled benefits if simply applied to the Trust Fund. But we ALSO have an additional package of benefit cuts totaling 2.7% which itself would have closed all of the gap and then some. On the other hand the individual comes out of this with a PRA funded with a total of 3.06% of his wage income over that period. Perhaps the end result is a BETTER than 100% of scheduled benefit? Well no, a look at Table 1 shows that a retired couple can expect to get a result from 85% (low earner one worker) to 109% (high earner two worker) compared to the baseline schedule.</p>
<p>Well but what about Ownership Society? You have your PRA, surely you can pass those assets onto your heirs? Well no. Not unless you die quickly.<br />
<blockquote>All payments from PRAs would be paid as annuities, which would initially be required to be fixed, inflation-indexed annuities provided by the Social Security Administration as part of a beneficiary’s regular Social Security benefit.  Full annuitization by age 68 is required, but beneficiaries can choose to spread annuitization between 62 and 68 if so desired.  Married beneficiaries would be required to purchase joint and two-thirds survivor annuities.  Annuities would be 10-year certain annuities to provide payouts to heirs of those who die soon after annuitization.  The total balances in the accounts of the two spouses in a married couple would be split equally in the case of divorce.</p></blockquote>
<p> So what would workers see out of LMS? Well a joint survivor fixed income, inflation indexed annuity paid out monthly by the Social Security system. Which sounds identical to what happens today, except the result in the case of LMS is exposed to the market, the results in Table 1, bad as they are, assume &#8220;Expected Yield on Mixed Portfolio&#8221;. Meaning it is kind of a crap-shoot.</p>
<p>Does LMS do some good things? Well yes, but none of them particularly rebound to the benefit of most workers and certainly not lower earning workers. Instead they are asked to chip in a combination of 1.5% in &#8216;contributions&#8217; (they obviously would not be exposed to the cap increase) and take a guaranteed 2.7% cut in benefits hoping to make up around half of that through returns on their PRAs. How did the authors possibly proposed to sell that?</p>
<p>Time to put that Tin Foil Hat on. If you bury the 1.5% increase in the text and address all the other changes you have workers giving up 3.7%, or 2.7% for those earning under the old cap. Which is a lot to only partially solve a problem scored at 1.92% over 75 years. But not a lot to solve a problem scored at 3.5% over the Infinite Future. It is really the odd coincidence to have a new number pop up in the 2003 Report so useful for the purposes of selling a Privatization Plan that on one accounting requires just that amount of offset. How do you sell a plan that proposes a 5.2% solution to a problem scored 1.92%? Easy hide 1.5% of the solution and re-score the problem by 1.58%. Tin Foil Hat off.</p>
<p>As we confront the work of the new Deficit Commission it will be important for workers to firmly keep their own self-interest in mind and ask some serious questions. One what problem is the Commission actually addressing. Two how much of that problem if any was actually caused by Social Security. Three if the solution to that problem only calls for sacrifices by workers in the form of benefit cuts where is the equity. We know the way the problem will be framed, it will be expressed in dollar terms over the Infinite Future Horizon, it will be blamed on excessive Backward Transfers to previous generations, there will be attempts to blame Boomers for ruining the whole world with their greed. Because that is what the &#8216;reformers&#8217; have been doing for years, trying to find some way to stick workers with the tab.</p>
<p>Make them honestly define the problem they are solving. Make sure they use honest scores. Don&#8217;t let them frame this as some problem created by workers when it is nothing of the sort. And above all don&#8217;t let them bill you 5% for a problem that in 2009 was scored 2.01%. Social Security faces a real actuarial gap much as it has in various years past. And given that it is a plan financed for workers by workers it is incumbent on workers to suggest a solution. Dale, Arne and I have proposed a solution that delivers 100% of the scheduled benefit via a phased in set of payroll tax increases. Other workers might decide that it would be better to combine a lower set of increases with some changes in indexing or retirement age, or throw in some increase in cap levels. All of which is legitimate enough. What isn&#8217;t legitimate is for some Commission to use some bait and switch tactic like LMS does.</p>

<blockquote><p>Hi Bruce,</p>
<p>I really enjoyed your recent post to OpenLeft about the war on Social Security. I wrote a related piece deconstructing Obama&#8217;s latest picks to the Debt Commission:</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.alternet.org/story/146183/obama_packs_debt_commission_with_social_security_looters?page=entire">Alternet: Obama Packs Debt Commission with Social Security Looters?</a></p>
<p>Any feedback about the article or thoughts on the matter would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>I run a watchdog website called <a target="_blank" href="http://littlesis.org/">LittleSis.org</a> that tracks ties between corporate and government elites, with an emphasis on Wall Street. We&#8217;re gearing up for a sustained investigation into the networks of funding and influence behind the latest attack on Social Security, and I wanted to just say hello and touch base. It seems that there could be more coordination happening between various folks keeping watch on this. </p>
<p>Best,<br />Matthew</p></blockquote>
<p> I have Matthew&#8217;s full contact info if serious people want it. But the piece is very good regardless.</p>
<p>(Update: Lifted from comments:<br />Movie Guy: &#8220;Matthew Skomarovsky wrote an excellent piece.  It strikes me that it deserved a stronger presentation at Angry Bear.  I doubt that many casual drive-by readers  bothered to click on the main post sublink.  But what a piece&#8221;)</p>
<p>Worth saying twice. Click and read.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>by Bruce Webb</p>
<p>Well some things are coming clear about the Presidents Deficit Commission. One its Chairmen have made it clear that its business starts and stops with Entitlements, the concerns some Republicans had that this would be Obama&#8217;s way of boosting taxes on the General Fund side or slashing military spending have been shown to be misplaced. Moreover it is clear from the NYT article cited by Jack yesterday plus many other indications that Social Security is front and center, after all the GOP has used the prospect of cuts to Medicare as a centerpiece to their opposition to HCR.</p>
<p>So the ground in being prepared for a grand debate on Social Security. But the question I want to throw out today is this: Who will be the scorekeeper? And the answer to that has huge implications.</p>
<p>There are three main governmental actors who score Social Security and they are not lined up neatly in either methodology or timing. First and foremost are the Trustees of Social Security. They release their Annual Report typically on March 31st though it can come out, as it did last year, as late as May. When it does come out it will be available here: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/index.html">Trustees&#8217; Reports</a> and of course in short order via a link in a post here at AB.</p>
<p>At that point we will be able to compare its numbers to those of the Congressional Budget Office. The CBO gives ten year numbers for Social Security with its standard Budget Outlooks and updates of its Baseline but its main analysis of Social Security comes each August in the form of a document entitled &#8216;CBO&#8217;s Long-Term Projections for Social Security&#8217;. The 2009 version of this is available here: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cbo.gov/publications/bysubject.cfm?cat=11">CBO Publications: Social Security and Pensions</a></p>
<p>A third scorekeeper is the White House Office of Management and Budget which releases its own 10-year numbers on Social Security with its release of the President&#8217;s Budget. Normally these numbers would not be front and center in a Social Security discussion, but this is after all a Presidential Commission and moreover the current top two at OMB are themselves authors of prominent Social Security plans: Diamond-Orszag and Liebman-MacGuineas-Samwick (LMS).</p>
<p>So we are faced this year with our own Clash of the Titans. And it matters because the data sets are incongruent, where CBO in August projected a 75 year actuarial gap of 1.3%, SSA put it at 2.01% in May. Whereas SSA tells us that the Trust Fund will likely go to depletion in 2037 based on the best available information they had a year ago, CBO using updated information from last Spring/Summer still would have that date be 2043. And that time gap is very significant, it is the difference between mid-point Boomers being 82 or just crossing the average projected mortality date and 88 when most of that cohort will have shuffled off to Buffalo (and points beyond).</p>
<p>A couple of days ago it was announced that the Executive Director of the President&#8217;s Commission would be former top Clinton advisor and DLC Chair Bruce Reed and presumedly Bruce is staffing up as we speak. We don&#8217;t know when the Commission will actually hold its first hearings but certainly those will be shaped and informed by the numbers in the soon to be released SSA Trustees Report. But the time-table established would have the Commission issue recommendations in December presumedly to be acted on by the next Congress in Spring 2011. Which means that the Commission and then Congress are going to be dealing with four sets of numbers in succession: 2010 Social Security Report (April), Presidents 2011 Budget (Summer), CBO&#8217;s Long-Term Projections (August), and then in all likelihood the 2011 SS Report (April 2011).</p>
<p>So it should be interesting, because the set of policies you need to address a 2% of payroll gap in 2037 are very different from those needed to address a 1.3% gap in 2043. And the reality is that the situation on the ground has moved significantly since even those numbers were produced.</p>
<p>I addressed the question SSA? or CBO? to a big group of policy experts. And one of the biggest, and one with a long resume of top jobs at both SSA and CBO firmly answered &#8216;CBO&#8217;. But some people closer to the current action said essentially &#8216;Not so fast, that decision has not been made&#8217;. Well it makes a huge difference because coincidentally some of the major proposals out there like changes in retirement age and cap increases typically score right at 0.7% of payroll and so very close to the difference between SSA and CBO, if we adopt the former they might have to be included in a proposal, if we adopt the latter they could be scrapped without damage.</p>
<p>By and large the Press reporting in years past and most policy discussion generally has revolved around the Trustees numbers and until the debate over HCR few people even understood the role of CBO is scoring legislation. Now that the focus is turning squarely on Social Security commenters who have been content to deal with issues like Trust Fund Depletion in terms of &#8216;will run out&#8217; are suddenly going to be confronted with an amount of ambiguity and varying datasets that they just are not prepared for. But at least Angry Bear readers will have had a little heads up.</p>

                                <p>by Bruce Webb</p>
<p>Well it has been a relatively quiet winter on the Social Security front, but we are fast coming up on what I only half-jokingly call the &#8220;Bestest Day of the Year&#8221;, the release of the Annual Report of the Trustees of Social Security. The Report has in many recent years come out reliably on the last day of March but can be as late as May (as it was last year, perhaps because the Trustees were not all in place). When it does come out it can be found, viewed and downloaded at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/index.html">SSA: Trustees Reports</a>. The first thing I look at is of course the bottom line, what the number is for the actuarial gap and the date for Trust Fund exhaustion, but the second thing I look at is the magnitude of the change from 2009 and more importantly the reasons for that change. For example a couple of years ago the outlook brightened more than I expected, and a few years before that had darkened more than expected. Well it turned out that changes in assumptions about immigration in the first case and interest rates in the latter accounted for almost all the difference, very little was actually due to short term economic projections. So if there is anyone out there really prepared to dig into the tables it might be worth your time to review the 2009 Report, or at least the 15 page Summary, both available at the link.</p>
<p>The Report takes on some new urgency this year because of the appointment of the President&#8217;s Deficit Commission, which really should be called the Entitlements Commission. Because its leadership has made it clear that taxes and military spending will NOT be on the table, this will all be about what Co-chairman Alan Simpson calls the Big Three: Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. And the deck has been stacked. For those who haven&#8217;t been following the Commission will have 18 members, six appointed by the President, only four of whom can be Democrats, six by the House and six by the Senate. And although there is a requirement for a 14 vote super-majority to advance a recommendation, something that would normally insure gridlock, it appears that Obama is appointing five people favoring &#8216;reform&#8217; and only one firm defender of Social Security (Andy Stern of SEIU). Since it is a given that all six Republican Congressional members will be in favor of gutting Social Security, and knowing that of the three Senate Dems Durbin, Baucus and Conrad only the first is a lock to support Social Security as currently configured, blocking 14 votes means getting all 3 of Pelosi&#8217;s representatives, and we are already seeing reporting of intense pressure to appoint &#8220;at least one&#8221; Blue Dog. Meaning there is great risk of having &#8216;reformers&#8217; walk in the door with 14 votes locked down. And the only way supporters are going to be able to fight back is to make sure they are using real numbers, and that their proposals don&#8217;t play tricks like applying a 5.2% worker paid fix to a problem scored 1.92% (as has been done before with LMS).</p>
<p>And along with posts dealing with the Report release and the Commission expect some re-caps of the ins and outs of Social Security finance itself. Familiar territory to some here, but necessary for people just entering the fray. But enough for today, the basketball is starting. Arrivederci.</p>

<p>The  immediate economic/political news this week will revolve around Health Care and then transition to Jobs. Which is a good thing because I could really use a job with health care benefits. But Social Security blogging is what I do so here is a piece on the various ways in which Social Security &#8216;crisis&#8217; is viewed which in turn controls the structuring of the proposed solutions. A lot of meta with not much in the way of numbers so I&#8217;ll tuck it unobtrusively under the fold.<a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Once again I&#8217;ll let Baker and Weisbrot set the stage from their 1999 &#8216;Social Security: the Phony Crisis&#8217;<br />
<blockquote>We have a chance, said President Clinton, to “fix the roof while the sun is still shining.” He was talking about dealing with Social Security immediately, while the economy is growing and the federal budget is balanced. The audience was a regional conference on Social Security, in Kansas City, Missouri, that the White House had helped bring together.</p>
<p>The roof analogy is illuminating, but we can make it more accurate. Imagine that it’s not going to rain for more than 30 years. And the rain, when it does arrive (and it might not), will be pretty light. And imagine that the average household will have a lot more income for roof repair by the time the rain approaches.</p>
<p>Now add this: most of the people who say they want to fix the roof actually want to knock holes in it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Exactly so. Meaning that the first step in engaging in a defense of Social Security is to determine if your opponents falls in the &#8216;mend it&#8217; category or the &#8216;end it&#8217;. Is the problem that Social Security is fundamentally broken? or that it exists at all?</p>
<p>By the Seventies the latter question seemed to be settled, Social Security was the Third Rail of American Politics, conventional wisdom said if you tinkered with it you died. This is not to say that people believed the program itself was perfect, Social Security having been adjusted both as to form with the addition of first survivors and later disability insurance and requiring periodic adjustments in the tax rate, but apart from some Randian Objectivists few people were willing to attack the concept openly even if they doubted the ultimate solvency. But those who were in what we would now call Movement Conservatism, that strand leading from Landon to Reagan never embraced Social Security and warned against expansion of the concept via Medicare and federalized Welfare programs, it was just that through the sixties and seventies they were stymied by a combination of the Democratic coalition forged in the New Deal along with the more liberal to moderate North East style Republicanism that came to be known as the Rockefeller Wing, which could be typified as those Republicans who believed in Good Government (in previous generations known as &#8216;Goo Goos&#8217; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goo-goos)</p>
<p>But of course the ground was moving under their feet. The forces unleashed by the Civil Rights movement, the anti-war movement, environmentalism, and the counterculture served both to fracture the New Deal Coalition, particularly as a result of the Southern Realignment and to undermine the mostly Northeastern and Mid-Western power structure of the Republican Party and moved that power South and West and we could add Right as well. And one result among many is that fundamental hostility to Social Security transformed from being a fringe position to being that of the center of Movement Conservatism and Reaganism.</p>
<p>The end result of the Greenspan Commission of 1982-83 was a compromise fix of Social Security and this has fed a myth that all parties were pre-committed to a &#8216;mend it&#8217; and not &#8216;end it&#8217; position. The accounts of the actual participants show this was not true, the decision to mend came after a bitter deadlock, that was broken only after Reagan concluded he didn&#8217;t have the votes to do what he wanted. Even at that it was a close thing, Reagan having committed to the deal having to do some arm twisting on some of the Republican Commissioners and still ending up with three No votes on final.</p>
<p>In the aftermath of what they called among themselves the &#8216;fiasco&#8217; represented by the 1983 compromise, ideological opponents of Social Security literally regrouped themselves around what would become the Cato Project on Social Security Privatization (now Cato Project on Social Security Choice) and undertook a joint reframing exercise on Social Security that in one incarnation was labeled the &#8216;Leninist Strategy&#8217;. Rather than an open attack on Social Security as being a bad thing in and of itself, a position largely untenable at the time, they simply set out to undermine future support for it, primarily among younger workers, and selling the message that whatever you thought of Social Security in principle, that long term it was guaranteed to fail in practice, and so that while it could be patched, there was no permanent &#8216;mend it&#8217; solution, meaning that at some point it would need to be addressed by an &#8216;end it&#8217; or at least &#8216;transform it&#8217; strategy.</p>
<p>Which is where we are today. The fundamental opposition to Social Security is where it has been since Alf Landon ran against it in the 1936 Presidential election, but the framing built on top of that foundation has been reshaped into one where the problem is not that Social Security is inherently bad, but that it is irretrievably broken. The problem for those opponents is that they can not concede either on &#8216;irretrievable&#8217; or &#8216;broken&#8217;, that would simply case them to fall back on a &#8216;socialism&#8217; argument that has been proven unpersuasive to a population that can say with no apparent sense of irony &#8216;keep government out of my Social Security&#8217;.</p>
<p>It is this commitment to the concept of &#8220;irretrievable&#8221; that seems to baffle supporters of Social Security. They live in a mental world that believes &#8216;Social Security is a social good that if possible should be fixed&#8221; as opposed to a mental world that holds &#8216;Social Security is a social evil that is also broken, but should not be fixed in any event&#8217;. For opponents &#8216;crisis&#8217; is more seen as &#8216;opportunity&#8217;. Which is why you have to smile at the naivete of progressives who see the answer as being blindingly obvious, just raise the cap. For opponents any fix to Social Security misses the fundamental problem it poses, and the very worst possible approach would be one that moves Social Security even farther in terms of redistribution. For them the answer to socialism is not more socialism, supporters of a cap increase might as well be speaking Martian in terms of likelihood of delivering that particular message.</p>
<p>For years I thought that the answer to Social Security &#8216;crisis&#8217; was to point out that the problem, to the extent it even was a problem, was small, on balance shrinking, meaning that the cost of a fix going forward would likely end up smaller than projected, and expect this would be received as good news. Who wouldn&#8217;t want a cheap and easy fix to an issue that was being framed as being broken? Not quite getting that for opponents of Social Security that brokenness was the best feature of Social Security, it giving them the opening they needed to address the real problem, which is socialism in America. They believe they have their hands around the neck of socialistic Social Security which is half-choked and ready to be shoved in Grover Norquist&#8217;s bathtub for final drowning and here come Coberly and Webb suggesting the patient would be okay if you just opened up his airway a little. Man talk about missing the point.<br />_______________________________<br />This post was originally heading in a different direction. That argument will have to be saved for Part 2.</p>

                                <p>by Daniel J. Becker</p>
<p>Back in <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2008/06/senator-obama-chooses-jason-furman-econ.html">June of &#8217;08</a> I asked regarding Jason Furman&#8217;s appointment by Obama: <br />
<blockquote>Is this the concession the Clinton/Blue Dog group was looking for? The DLC still keeps control of the money issues? </p></blockquote>
<p>I asked because of his connection to the Hamilton Project at the Brookings Institute: Hamilton Project, a small think tank created by Robert E. Rubin, Bill Clinton&#8217;s Treasury secretary and key economic adviser, and former Treasury deputy secretary Roger C. Altman&#8230;</p>
<p>Bruce <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2008/06/soc-sec-xxv-advisor-jason-furman-on.html">posted a response</a> by Furman regarding Obama&#8217;s SS plans: <br />
<blockquote>As president, he would work with Congress on a bipartisan basis to design the details of such a change, including the tax rate, how it is phased in over time, the linkage between these tax payments and benefits and other critical design elements of this plan.</p></blockquote>
<p>We have known what Obama&#8217;s position is since his campaigning.  Unfortunately, many have ignored it even blaming the victim (the voter) for his lack of left leaning action.   But, just to bolster the smacking up side the head <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/02/obama-and-social-security.html#comments">Bruce</a> is offering via NewDealDemocrat, I went digging further on Mr. Furman and found this from 2005 via <a href="http://www.cbpp.org/cms/?fa=view&#038;id=261">Center on Budget</a> and Policy Priorities: <br />
<blockquote>By contrast, under traditional reform plans like that proposed by economists <strong>Peter Diamond and Peter Orszag,</strong> the debt would be reduced immediately, and by 2050, the amount of debt reduction would be substantial.</p></blockquote>
<p>Mr. NewDeal stated: <br />
<blockquote>In short, only a month into his Administration, Candidate Obama&#8217;s insistence on tax hikes as the method of long term Social Security budget balancing was replaced by President Obama&#8217;s embrace of the <strong>Diamond-Orszag plan</strong>&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>I was certain with Hillary we were getting the DLC and all the Chicago School Econ we could handle. I was resisting the temptation of conspiracy thought when I asked if Furman was a concession to the Clinton power block, but I feel confident now that this is exactly what happened.  Hillary conceded on June 7th, Furman was appointed on June 9th.</p>
<p>Remember the 60&#8217;s and the warnings about how the &#8220;Man&#8221; was messing with our heads? The message wasn&#8217;t to be paranoid, the message was to be aware.</p>
