<p>Barkley Rosser and I among others have long claimed that Social Security&#8217;s economic models are too pessimistic in light of performance both over the whole post-war period and particularly over the last dozen years. And the numbers looking back are pretty clear, Social Security income/cost ratios have come in better than Intermediate Cost projections and were right up to around August of 2008 (when things went into decline).</p>
<p>These claims have drawn some pushback from the &#8216;Crisis&#8217; folk including Andrew Biggs. In his most recent post he calls on Doug Elmendorf of CBO to give the explanation. <a target="_blank" href="http://andrewgbiggs.blogspot.com/2009/03/cbo-explains-why-future-gdp-growth-will.html">CBO Explains Why Future GDP Growth Will be Slower than in the Past</a>. But first Andrew explains why GDP in and of itself is not the key metric.<br />
<blockquote>This difference comes down to the fact that the Trustees don&#8217;t think about &#8220;GDP growth&#8221; as a single thing, but break it down into its components and project how those components will change over time. In fact, despite Langer&#8217;s claim that &#8220;The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is the key economic assumption in estimating costs,&#8221; it actually plays no direct part in estimating Social Security&#8217;s finances: Social Security doesn&#8217;t collect taxes based on GDP, nor does it pay benefits based on GDP. </p></blockquote>
<p>To some degree this is a straw man argument, critics of the current Intermediate Cost economic model use Real GDP because it is a widely reported and pretty well understood metric that within limits reflects the factors which really determine Social Security solvency, which is to say more people working at higher wages with lower inflation. In any event whatever the source of increased GDP the larger it is the easier it is to supply a basket of goods to a more or less fixed cohort of future retirees, (being that almost everyone who will be collecting Social Security over the 75 year actuarial window being already alive). So granting the point that GDP is not a perfect proxy for Social Security solvency why is it going to be smaller going forward? Elmendorf explains (and Biggs follows up)<br />
<blockquote>
<blockquote>Projected growth from 2015 to 2019 is also below historical average growth rates, a difference that is more than accounted for by slower growth in the labor force because of the retirement of the baby boom generation. Over the postwar period, the labor force grew at an average annual rate of 1.6 percent; by contrast, we project it to grow only 0.4 percent per year in the period from 2015 through 2019. As a result, potential GDP grew 3.4 percent per year on average in the postwar period, but CBO expects that it will grow by only 2.4 percent annually (allowing for a tad more productivity growth) in the 2015-2019 period.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, the economy will grow more slowly in the future because the labor force will grow more slowly in the future. No conspiracy needed.</p></blockquote>
<p>Excuse me for leaving my tin foil hat on. My response to Biggs is under the fold.</p>
<blockquote><p>A slower growing labor force in the future implies more demand for the labor hours that remain which if the rules of supply and demand work in the way that most economists insist they do should translate into real wage gains (which are directly captured by FICA taxes). Instead we are told that real wage increases will decline permanently to an annual 1.0 to 1.1% rate.<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/V_economic.html#188118">Table V.B1.—Principal Economic Assumptions</a></p>
<p>Similarly if the economy is sputtering going forward due to a slowing in labor force growth (and so a slip in covered worker ratio) you would think you could counteract that via an increase in legal immigration. Instead we are told that by 2010 legal immigration will stabilize at a rate 21% below that of 2006 and remain at  750,000/year forever.<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/V_demographic.html#205410">Table V.A1.—Principal Demographic Assumptions, Calendar Years 1940-2085</a> <br />Which means that as the population increases from 308 million in 2007 to 481 million in 2085 the proportion of foreign born Americans is projected to steadily drop. This flies in the face of American historical experience, when we needed farmers to open up the frontier we got them from the Scots-Irish and the Germans (that&#8217;s when my ancestors checked into America). When we needed laborers to build the railroads we got them from Ireland and China. If we have a growing yet ageing population and a dire need for more night nurses and geriatric care doctors we have a ready supply going forward in Mexico and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Perhaps someone can provide a reasoned explanation why in the face of an economy handicapped by a stagnant labor supply our policy response will be to clamp down on both legal and illegal immigration in the way implied by the data tables. But until that contradiction gets satisfactorily explained I will be keeping that hat firmly down around my ears.</p>
<p>Because it all still looks like a model chasing a desired conclusion. Particularly when Low Cost itself sees immigration settling out an an absolute rate lower than the 2006 peak. This really doesn&#8217;t make any real world sense at all.</p></blockquote>
<p>I want to highlight that last point. Per the 2008 Report legal immigration for 2006 was estimated to be 950,000 with illegal immigration adding another 380,000 for a total of 1,330,000 adding to a total population equalling 306 million. Under Intermediate Cost assumptions those numbers are projected to settle out at 750,000 and 380,000 by 2020 (1,130,000 out of 345 million people) and to an ultimate 750,000 and 275,000 or 1,025,000 new immigrants out of a 2085 population estimated at 481 million. Now these numbers do imply that we ultimately get reasonable control of the borders, which is not a bad thing in and of itself. But it also implies a specific policy decision to limit legal immigration 17% lower in absolute numbers than the 2006 peak. While this maybe would come as good news to the no-growth zealots currently controlling the Sierra Club, it would be an odd response to an systematic economic slowdown caused by low labor supply growth.</p>
<p>And this remains true when we turn to Low Cost. It also suggests we will get better control over the borders with illegal immigration dropping through the 75 year window, although slower than IC. But it also implicitly argues that we will by 2010 set a hard, permanent cap on legal immigration at 960,000. Which date is exactly when Boomer retirement picks up and so the need for cheap labor to care for us in our old age. The notion that we will be beating our heads against the wall wondering where we will get landscapers and nursing home aides come 2020 is pretty odd. Because unless Mexico and the Philippines drop off the face of the planet this shouldn&#8217;t really be a problem.</p>
<p>The conspiracy I see is not in Intermediate Cost projections, that could be explained away as the natural caution of actuaries. But in data category after data category it is Low Cost that seems artificially capped both on the economic and demographic fronts. The argument boils down to saying that the near future (say the next twenty years) cannot even on your most optimistic assumptions be as good as the recent past. We probably will not hit every component of Low Cost, that is a function of a model that assumes every factor favorable to solvency tracks together (Low Cost) or alternatively that every factor moves negatively (High Cost). (We indeed would be served better with an expanded matrix of alternatives, something suggested by the SSAB). That is no reason to simply accept that demography has us in a helpless trap that dooms us to no better than 1.1% Real Wage, 1.7% Productivity, and 2.1% Real GDP.</p>
<p>Come on we can do better than that! We are not passive victims here, we can if necessary craft policy in a way that targets economic growth. That is if we want Low Cost outcomes we can implement Low Cost policy, and if that requires relighting the torch on the Statute of Liberty sobeit.</p>

<p>Those who ignore history are bound to repeat it. The otherwise estimable Ezra falls into the trap.<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/ezraklein_archive?month=03&#038;year=2009&#038;base_name=bipartisan_policy_making&#038;6">Bipartisan Policy Making</a> Hertzberg is wrong at so many levels and so many points that you hardly know where to start. I have bolded some of the really wrong-headed claims.<br />
<blockquote>Rick Hertzberg notices some Republicans calling for a payroll tax cut amidst the stimulus and proclaims it a Good Idea. It is a good idea! And I like the endgame, too:<br />
<blockquote>Liberals have been reticent, too. The payroll tax now provides a third of federal revenues. And, because it nominally funds Social Security and Medicare, some liberals regard its continuance as essential to the survival of those programs. That’s almost certainly wrong. Public pensions and medical care for the aged have become fixed, integral parts of American life. Their political support no longer depends on analogizing them to private insurance. Besides, the aging of the population, the collapse of defined-benefit private pensions, the volatility of 401(k)s, and pricey advances in medical technology mean that, no matter what efficiencies may be achieved, Social Security and Medicare will—and should—grow. Holding them hostage to ever-rising, job-killing payroll taxes is perverse.</p>
<p>If the economic crisis necessitates a second stimulus—and it probably will—then a payroll-tax holiday deserves a look. But it’s only half a good idea. A whole good idea would be to make a payroll-tax holiday the first step in an orderly transition to scrapping the payroll tax altogether and replacing the lost revenue with a package of levies on things that, unlike jobs, we want less rather than more of—things like pollution, carbon emissions, oil imports, inefficient use of energy and natural resources, and excessive consumption. The net tax burden on the economy would be unchanged, but the shift in relative price signals would nudge investment from resource-intensive enterprises toward labor-intensive ones. This wouldn’t be just a tax adjustment. It would be an environmental program, an anti-global-warming program, a youth-employment (and anti-crime) program, and an energy program.</p></blockquote>
<p>If we had a serious public sphere in which legislators actually wanted to solve problems and were genuinely committed to the public policy ideas they claim to support rather than the industries that fund their reelection, this is the sort of discussion we&#8217;d see.</p></blockquote>
<p>Just shoot me now. Or follow me below the fold while I explain why this is just wrong, wrong, wrong and worse muddle-headed.</p>
<p>Since Alf Landon and the presidential campaign of 1936 the Republican Party has always had the destruction of Social Security as close to openly at the center of their policy goals as they have dared to make it. And after 1965 that has been true of Medicare as well. Because the programs has been very politically popular they have rarely dared to make an open assault on either. That is why Newt had to backtrack on his &#8220;Wither on the vine&#8221; comment and lamely claim he was not talking about Medicare itself but only HCFA. His proposal which disguised real cuts to Medicare (after calculating in medical inflation and growing numbers of covered beneficiaries) by nominal increases in dollars spent was a clear attempt to cripple Medicare over time until it was weak enough to drown in Grover Norquist&#8217;s bathtub. This is what he intended and every observant people knew it, yet he got away with claiming that those nominal increases not only were not real cuts but that people who claimed different were simple liars (something the MSM accepted like gospel.)</p>
<p>And that is why Bush&#8217;s attempt to privatize Social Security ultimately fell apart. His attempts to sell it based on &#8220;Ownership society&#8221; and &#8220;Private control&#8221; and &#8220;Inheritability&#8221; for lower income workers didn&#8217;t hold up to examination. The semi-official Posen plan (floated but never explicitly endorsed) with its clawback and annuitization provisions was a crappy deal for workers, once you ran the numbers, something those in on the game on both sides knew from the beginning. I want to repeat a quote from Dean Baker&#8217;s Phony Crisis that I have put up before:<br />
<blockquote>We have a chance, said President Clinton, to “fix the roof while the sun is still shining.” He was talking about dealing with Social Security immediately, while the economy is growing and the federal budget is balanced. &#8211; &#8211; &#8211;</p>
<p>The roof analogy is illuminating, but we can make it more accurate. Imagine that it’s not going to rain for more than 30 years. And the rain, when it does arrive (and it might not), will be pretty light. And imagine that the average household will have a lot more income for roof repair by the time the rain approaches.</p>
<p>Now add this: most of the people who say they want to fix the roof actually want to knock holes in it.</p>
<p>This is the situation facing Social Security, and it is well known to those who have looked at the numbers.</p></blockquote>
<p> Moral: beware of Republicans bearing hammers. </p>
<p>Just as conservatives say about conservatism, Social Security can not fail, it can only be failed. And felled. And killed. If the Republicans can find a chink in its armor they will strike. Social Security&#8217;s historical defense has been the wall between FICA payroll tax and the General Fund. Certainly there is a gate in that wall that allows money to flow through in controlled fashion, but the key is control, you don&#8217;t want people willy-nilly busting holes in Social Security&#8217;s perimeter wall.</p>
<p>Even with the current barrier in place and Social Security safely supplied until 2041 or 2049 Republicans and Blue Dogs are arguing that we have no choice but to cut benefits by changing initial benefits from being adjusted for real wage to being adjusted for prices. Because in their world view there is no wall at all between the Trust Funds and the General Fund or for that matter between the Trust Funds themselves. They don&#8217;t see an OASI and a DI and a HI, no they see some OASDIHISSISMIPartBPartD monster. And one they want to kill. The notion that there is no danger to Social Security because Newt and Bush over-reached is dangerous nonsense, Hertzberg&#8217;s claim that &#8220;public pensions and medical care&#8221; no longer need the political protection afforded by the wall that keeps them positioned as insurance simply flies in the face of the 74 year history of periodic efforts to kill Social Security.</p>
<p>In these matters the Republican Party relies on two standard rhetorical moves. One they divide all government spending into two categories: money we can&#8217;t NOT afford, which includes pretty much anything military, and money we CAN&#8217;T afford, which is just about everything else. (It is why they can&#8217;t be concerned by weapons programs that continue to go billions of dollars over budget, because gosh those F-22s might be vital one day, but get all indignant at proposals to put $50 million towards the Arts or $1 million towards cricket control.) And two they insist that &#8220;temporary&#8221; tax cuts are actually in practice permanent and that allowing them to lapse is just a huge tax increase. We see this daily in their response to the prospect of Republican supported tax sunsets actually being allowed to occur on the schedule they themselves set. Anyone who doesn&#8217;t think that same logic won&#8217;t be applied to a &#8220;temporary&#8221; payroll tax holiday is in my view delusional.</p>
<p>Once Republicans are allowed to blow even the smallest hole through the payroll tax wall they will certainly point to decaying figures for TF solvency as &#8216;proof&#8217; that the Republican and Blue Dog plan for bleeding Social Security dry over time is just something we will have to do, because you can bet that Social Security will &#8216;regretfully&#8217; be placed in the category of &#8216;spending we CAN&#8217;T afford&#8217;. Because there will never come a time when lifting that &#8216;temporary payroll tax holiday&#8217; will not be presented as a job killer and a huge regressive tax on lower income workers. That kind of bait and switch is what they do.</p>
<p>Klein and Hertzberg are implicitly claiming they can outplay the Republicans here. As if these guys hadn&#8217;t been playing and planning this game for decades before these kids were born. And all with the naive belief that the answer to everything is to tax stuff you don&#8217;t like: &#8220;things like pollution, carbon emissions, oil imports, inefficient use of energy and natural resources, and excessive consumption&#8221;. Yep and you can pay for the whole thing simply by a combination of lifting payroll tax and rebates to lower income workers. All without any risk to the programs heretofore financed by that walled off revenue.</p>
<p>Given the historical record of Republican hostility to the establishment and continuation of Social Security and Medicare and indeed anything that smacks of Social Democracy (say things like paid FMLA) it is just a horribly risky gamble to tinker with the carefully constructed wall that is FICA as currently configured. (For example the payroll cap is an important buttress to that wall, it keeps an important and immensely influential population segment willing to support the wall as opposed to tearing it down.)</p>
<p>As currently configured Social Security fundamentally owes nothing to the people who control capital because to date it has drawn nothing from them. (At worst it required them to pay down the TF in the early sixties and the seventies, in effect repaying money borrowed in earlier decades.) Breaking down that wall or just punching holes in it in effect turns over part of the defense over to the people who historically have been intent on leveling the entire Social Security city. It is called a Trojan Horse, and those bearing this particular &#8216;gift&#8217; should not be assumed to be acting in good faith. Not given the historical record.</p>
<p>The tendency of these post-Reagan liberal market and consumption tax loving fan-boys to think they are smarter than FDR is dangerous. The people who designed Social Security knew what they were doing and things like financing it entirely through wages and keeping contributions capped are important features and not just bugs to be swatted away.</p>
<p>Revised moral: Beware of twenty-something liberals bearing fly-swatters before they enable the Republican/Blue Dog hammer bearers. The roof isn&#8217;t perfect, but it keeps the rain out. And that is not a bug.</p>

<p>In a post at his site <a target="_blank" href="http://andrewgbiggs.blogspot.com/2009/03/survey-half-of-workers-would-opt-out-of.html">Andrew Biggs</a> points us to a NewMajority.com piece by him <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newmajority.com/ShowScroll.aspx?ID=13d1525d-a025-4465-842c-e2d536f008fd">Survey: Half of workers would opt out of Social Security if they could</a> which in turn points to a survey sponsored by Sun Life Financial <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sunlife-usa.com/unretirementindex/results.cfm">Results show that almost half (48%) would prefer to stop paying into the Social Security</a></p>
<p>The results broke down by ages as follows:<br />30-39: 59%<br />40-49: 52% (Men 57%, Women 44%)<br />50-59: 44%<br />60+: 34%<br />All: 48% as being willing to drop out of Social Security even if they had to forfeit benefits earned to date.</p>
<p>Which lead Biggs to ask in comments: <i> What does it say when even people who benefit from Social Security have so little faith in it, particularly when the main purpose of the program is to make people feel secure?</i> to which my reply was<br />
<blockquote>Well some people really do believe &#8220;Things go better with Coke&#8221;. Because Coke paid good money to market that message.</p>
<p>The results of the survey tell me something I have known for a long time, the efforts outlined in Butler and Germanis (Cato J. 1983) worked brilliantly. The plan as outlined had three parts which I would summarize as follows:<br />1. Reassure those in or approaching retirement<br />2. Convince younger workers that Social Security just won&#8217;t be there for them<br />3. Present them with a plausible alternative based on the argument &#8216;something is better than nothing&#8217;</p>
<p>This plan was perhaps one of the best marketing campaigns in history with the results seen in the survey. Those who have been exposed to the message promulgated by what is now known as the &#8220;Cato Project (on) Social Security Choice&#8221; aided and abetted by various enterprises sponsored by Pete G. Peterson such as Concord and the movie I.O.U.S.A combined with an active outreach to younger workers via such things as the Fiscal Responsibility Wakeup Tour over the 25 years (since the publication of Butler and Germanis) have largely succumbed to the message strategy. Naturally people will want to opt out if they don&#8217;t believe they will get anything out or can get better returns on their own.</p>
<p>So congratulations are due to all concerned. But all that polling really shows is the success of the marketing campaign. In my experience extraordinarily few of the doubters really have any conception of the actual numbers in play. Mainly because they never seem to be part of the message being delivered. Except of course when they see numbers aggregated over the Infinite Future Horizon for both Social Security and Medicare.</p>
<p>&#8220;What does it say when even people who benefit from Social Security have so little faith in it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Well it suggests to me that Cato got its money worth in some of its past hires.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ll explain that last piece of snark and discuss some implications of this below the fold.</p>
<p>In the Summer of 1983, smarting under what they called the &#8220;fiasco of the last 18 months&#8221;, i.e. the Greenspan Commission and subsequent 1983 Reform, the Cato Institute convened a conference in Washington DC and subsequently published the papers in their Fall 1983 Cato Journal under the title <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cato.org/pubs/journal/cj3n2/cj3n2.html">Social Security: Continuing Crisis or Real Reform</a>. One of those articles had the intriguing title of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cato.org/pubs/journal/cj3n2/cj3n2-11.pdf">Social Security Reform: Achieving a &#8216;Leninist&#8217; Strategy</a>. In that article was laid out the long term plan alluded to in my comment quoted above, which plan focused in large part on convincing younger workers that Social Security just wouldn&#8217;t be there for them. Cato not only accepted that plan it institutionalized it in what was then known as the Project on Social Security Privatization but now known as the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.socialsecurity.org/about/index.html">Project on Social Security Choice</a>. (Note the domain name: http://www.socialsecurity.org/about/index.html &#8211; they have staked a claim to Social Security itself)<br />One thing to note is that &#8216;privatization&#8217; has essentially been scrubbed out of the &#8216;About&#8217; page and in fact it now states<br />
<blockquote>On August 14, 1995, the Cato Institute launched its Project on Social Security Choice, the largest undertaking in the organization&#8217;s history. The objective of the project is to formulate a viable blueprint allowing individuals the opportunity of owning their own retirement account. The project publishes books, studies, and articles and holds conferences. The Cato Institute&#8217;s experts examine the problems facing the current system, the methods that can be used to move towards a system of personal retirement accounts, and the effects that a new system would have on workers.</p></blockquote>
<p> Subsequently it was shown that &#8216;privatization&#8217; and &#8216;privatizing&#8217; didn&#8217;t poll well and so were dropped. As in &#8220;We have always been at war with Oceanea&#8221;. They were a little more open on the actual launch <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cato.org/research/ss_prjct.html">Project on Social Security Privatization</a><br />
<blockquote>On August 14, 1995, the 60th anniversary of Social Security, Cato held a press conference to inaugurate its Project on Social Security Privatization. That event was televised by C-SPAN and covered by ABC’s Good Morning America. The objective of Cato’s Project on Social Security Privatization is to formulate and recommend a viable ‘blueprint’ for privatizing the U.S. Social Security system. The Project is directed by Cato’s director of health and welfare studies, Michael Tanner, and is co-chaired by José Piñera, Chile’s former labor minister and architect of that country’s private pension system, and William Shipman, principal at State Street Global Advisors.</p></blockquote>
<p>How successful was the Project? Well in the early days pretty good. In fact by 1996 they were able to put up this result <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cato.org/pubs/ssps/ssp5es.html">Public Opinion and Social Security Privatization (by Michael Tanner, Project Director)</a> (bolding mine)<br />
<blockquote>Although Social Security remains one of the most popular government programs, most Americans understand that the system faces serious future financial problems and would support privatization of the retirement system, according to the results of a poll conducted by Public Opinion Strategies on behalf of the Cato Project on Social Security Privatization.</p>
<p>Among the poll&#8217;s findings:<br />More than 88 percent of Americans believe that Social Security either is in trouble today or will be in trouble within the next 20 years. Fully 60 percent of all Americans under age 65 believe Social Security will not be there for them when they retire.<br />As a result, more than two-thirds (69 percent) believe that Social Security will require &#8220;major&#8221; or &#8220;radical&#8221; change within the next 20 years. Among younger voters, approximately half believe that major or radical change is needed today. The support for change cuts across ideological and party lines.<br />Voters reject most traditional Social Security reforms such as raising the retirement age, raising payroll taxes, or reducing benefits.<br />Approximately two-thirds of voters would support privatization of Social Security, transforming the program into a privatized mandatory savings program. More than three-quarters of younger voters support privatization.</p></blockquote>
<p> Which explains my snark about Cato&#8217;s &#8220;past hires&#8221;. Starting with Butler and Germanis in 1983 and institutionalizing with the Project in 1995 the Cato Institute set out on a long range plan to undermine traditional Social Security by convincing younger workers that it just wouldn&#8217;t exist AT ALL. This was and is fundamentally dishonest, as long as FICA exists Social Security can pay out some level of benefits. An honest discussion would focus on the exact amount of the shortfall and the full range of possible solutions in that context. That discussion didn&#8217;t happen because the paid professionals at Cato deliberately set out to prevent it. A hint as to the next step comes in the sidebar of the Project&#8217;s &#8216;About&#8217; page. (bolding mine)<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;The largely Cato Institute-staffed presidential commission owes its existence to the Cato Institute itself. For the last quarter of a century, the Washington, D.C.-based libertarian think tank has been campaigning for the privatization of Social Security.&#8221;<br />&#8211; William O&#8217;Rourke, Chicago Sun Times, August 28, 2001</p></blockquote>
<p>Per O&#8217;Rourke it would seem that the original Butler and Germanis plan was first institutionalized under Cato with the Project and then elevated to official status with the 2001 Commission, itself staffed by those hired professionals from Cato. And who beside Director Tanner would those people be. Well those who follow this series will be familiar with at least one name. From the Cato <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cato.org/people/biggs.html">people</a> page.<br />
<blockquote>Andrew Biggs is a former Social Security analyst and Assistant Director of the Cato Institute&#8217;s Project on Social Security Choice. Prior to joining Cato he was Director of Research at the Congressional Institute in Washington, D.C. (where he remains a Fellow), and a staff member for the House Banking and Financial Services Committee. He holds a Bachelor&#8217;s degree from the Queen&#8217;s University of Belfast, Master&#8217;s from Cambridge University and Ph.D. from the London School of Economics and Political Science.<br />In 2001 Biggs served as a staff member for the President’s Commission to Strengthen Social Security, and in 2002 he was appointed by the Bush administration as a delegate to the National Summit on Retirement Savings and addressed the United Nations International Conference on Financing for Development.</p></blockquote>
<p>So when Biggs asked &#8220;&#8221;What does it say when even people who benefit from Social Security have so little faith in it?&#8221;</p>
<p>and I replied: &#8220;Well it suggests to me that Cato got its money worth in some of its past hires.&#8221;  I really meant &#8220;Heckuva job, Andy!&#8221;</p>
<p>People who make the argument that Social Security should be privatized because so many people under 50 are skeptical that it will even be there have the cart ahead of the horse. The real question is why those people are so skeptical to begin with? And to me the answer is pretty clear, Cato set out in 1983 to sell privatization via what I can only describe as a systematic propaganda plan aptly described by Butler and Germanis as a &#8221; &#8216;Leninist&#8217; Strategy&#8221;. It worked. Because I have a 1996 poll and a 2009 survey to prove it. A final note from Butler and Germanis<br />
<blockquote>There are two main elements to this strategy. <br />The first element consists of a campaign to achieve small legislative changes that embellish the present IRA system, making it in practice a small-scale private Social Security system that can supplement the federal system. As part of this campaign, the natural constituency for an enlarged IRA system must be identified and welded into a coalition for political change. If these objectives are achieved, we will meet the next financial crisis in Social Security with a private alternative ready in the wings—an alternative with which the public is familiar and comfortable, and one that has the backing of a powerful political force. </p>
<p>The second main element in our reform strategy involves what one might crudely call guerrilla warthre against both the current Social Security system and the coalition that supports it. An economic education campaign, assisted by modest changes in the law, must be undertaken to demonstrate the weaknesses of the existing system and to allow it to be compared accurately (and therefore unfavorably) with the private alternative. In addition, methods of neutralizing, buying out, or winning over key segments of the Social Security coalition must be explored and formulated into legislative initiatives, <br />The objective of this element of the strategy complements the first. The aim is to weaken political support for the present system when the next financial crisis appears. This two-pronged strategy will now be considered in more detail.</p></blockquote>
<p> Hmm, &#8220;an economic education campaign&#8221;. Gosh there is another word for what is being proposed here, one on the tip of my tongue, I think it starts with a &#8216;p&#8217; and is associated with a certain <a target="_blank" href="http://www.psywarrior.com/Goebbels.html">Herr G</a>. Even paranoids have real enemies. Mine are at the Cato Institute and strolling around the offices of the PGP Foundation.</p>

<p>1997 II.F6<br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SXCRE_g272I/AAAAAAAAADg/IZflIL6Lfzw/s1600-h/97-IIF6.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SXCRE_g272I/AAAAAAAAADg/IZflIL6Lfzw/s320/97-IIF6.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />2007 II.D7<br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SXCTiKqAs6I/AAAAAAAAADw/OBHMRx6eheE/s1600-h/07-II.D7.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SXCTiKqAs6I/AAAAAAAAADw/OBHMRx6eheE/s320/07-II.D7.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />Each year the Trustees of Social Security provide a graphic representation of the results of the three alternative projections: Low Cost, Intermediate Cost, and High Cost represented by results I, II, III respectively. And  the overall shape of the graph didn&#8217;t vary much from 1997 to 2007 (other selected years can be seen at <a target="_blank" href="http://bruceweb.blogspot.com/2009/01/alternative-shapes.html">Alternative Shapes</a>). While the date of Trust Fund Depletion (on the figure a TF ratio of 0) moved out some for Intermediate Cost (II) the result for Low Cost never really varied, instead it yielded a more or less flat Trust Fund ratio. For most purposes a flat Trust Fund ratio means that Social Security is &#8216;fixed&#8217; in that income including interest on the Trust Funds continues to meet projected cost. But you can get too much of a good thing, for example the interest on a Trust Fund with a ratio of 2000 at a nominal 5% rate would fully cover cost, which would operationally transform Social Security into a General Fund welfare plan. But this seemed to be just a pie in the sky idea, instead even the most optimistic projection showed Trust Funds ratios under Low Cost somewhere between 300 and 500 meaning that Interest would only be called upon to meet 15-25% of ongoing cost after 2029 or so. Nice steady state system.</p>
<p>The whole question seemed rather academic in that Low Cost was always seen as an optimistic economic model. If the best we could possibly accept was a steady state system why really even think about Low Cost, if it happened it happened.</p>
<p>But the narrative changed drastically with the 2008 Report, the story line got a lot more twisted, it is just that nobody noticed. The 2009 Report is due out in a couple of weeks and who knows exactly what story it tells, but for those interested you can take a look at the Future of the Shape per the 2008 Report below the fold.</p>
<p>2008 II.D6<br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/R_PB6t4ggSI/AAAAAAAAAAM/JjA6Q-1kAOQ/s1600-h/Snapshot+2008-04-02+10-08-52.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/R_PB6t4ggSI/AAAAAAAAAAM/JjA6Q-1kAOQ/s320/Snapshot+2008-04-02+10-08-52.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />The first thing to note is that this version of Low Cost is not a good outcome, there is no good reason to have the Trust Fund long term at anything but flat. In fact I argued that we should actually target a TF ratio of 100 in <a target="_blank" href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/06/soc-sec-xxvi-social-security-low-cost.html">Low Cost and the 100/100 Target</a>. But rather than rehash that I want to examine another aspect.</p>
<p>In the Summary of the Annual Report the Trustees supply three numbers for  Intermediate Cost: cost of an immediate fix, cost of a fix in 2041, cost of a fix at the end of the 75 year window, and then two more: amount of benefit cut needed in 2041 and cost at the end of the window. In years past those first three numbers are implicitly the equivalent of Low Cost in that they projected the same outcome of fully funded system with a presumedly flat TF ratio. In 2008 it is different. Now instead of needing numbers right at the probability limit (which is what Low Cost is presented to be) instead economic outcomes in between Intermediate Cost and Low Cost could end up producing that steady state result.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s take some pairs of numbers for ultimate years (ten years out) from Intermediate Cost and Low Cost:<br />Unemployment: 5.5%, 4.5%<br />Real Wage: 1.1%, 1.5%<br />Productivity: 1.7%, 2.0%<br />Real GDP:  2.2%, 2.9%</p>
<p>Which raises a series of questions. One, even if we conclude that Low Cost is on the whole too optimistic, what is the economic argument against outcomes that split the difference? For example 2006 was not considered to be a really great economic year but the respective numbers turned out to be: 4.6%, 1.8%, 1.0%, 2.9%, that is while productivity lagged the other numbers came in pretty much at Low Cost levels.  Granted 2008 numbers are going to look terrible and 2009&#8217;s worse but is there someone out there with a serious argument about why these number series can&#8217;t revert to 2006 levels on average?</p>
<p>Two, what if we embarked on an economic policy that targeted the 100/100 outcome? I posed a form of this question back in 2006 in <a target="_blank" href="http://bruceweb.blogspot.com/2006/01/goldilocks-and-three-social-security.html">Goldilocks and the Three Social Security Bears</a> but would reformulate it into something like the Four Musketeers. First let the Trustees continue to present the three current alternatives based on what they claim is best possible analysis, i.e. High Cost, Intermediate Cost, and Low Cost. But supplement that with a fourth economic model that would explicitly target a 100/100 solution (100% of scheduled benefit with a 100 TF ratio). And then let us have a debate whether we can reach that through policy means.</p>
<p>Because frankly laissez-faire is pretty much yesterday, the people who claimed that everything could be explained by EMH and that we would just end up where we would have been proven dead wrong. Specific choices by policy makers and investors combined with some Animal Spirits put us in the place we are and only die-hards are clinging to the idea that any of this was just the result of the Invisible Hand operating in a market of fully-informed participants. (Ask Bernie M&#8217;s clients how informed they were in retrospect). The dominant view in current Administration thinking is that we should strive for specific economic outcomes through deliberate policy actions. Why not include Social Security solvency via economic growth as one of those outcomes?</p>
<p>Because if we just slice the differences we are looking at something like 5.0% unemployment, 1.3% real wage, 1.9% productivity and 2.6% real GDP in the out years  to mostly or entirely solve the current projected gap. Those are not mad, crazy numbers and we don&#8217;t just have to accept what the economy throws at us. I don&#8217;t think we are likely to even get back at any point to 1999 numbers that had us at 4.2% unemployment, 4.7% real wage, 2.4% productivity, and 4.4% real GDP and certainly not as an average. But it seems kind of un-American to insist that the future can never even approach the past. These are just not unrealistic policy targets, why NOT shoot for them.</p>

<p>The following three Tables are copied from the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hks.harvard.edu/jeffreyliebman/lms_nonpartisan_plan_description.pdf">Liebman-MacGuineas-Samwick Non-Partisan Social Security Reform Plan</a> to make a couple of points. One is that the plan authors are just not that into you, that is if you are a wage worker seeking a more comfortable retirement. They see crisis from a much different standpoint. Discussion under the fold.<br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/Sbf30exknaI/AAAAAAAAAHA/uWUVvI1Y_w4/s1600-h/LMS_Table1.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/Sbf30exknaI/AAAAAAAAAHA/uWUVvI1Y_w4/s400/LMS_Table1.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/Sbf30DKSiII/AAAAAAAAAGw/IsCHZUWrKrE/s1600-h/LMS_Table2.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/Sbf30DKSiII/AAAAAAAAAGw/IsCHZUWrKrE/s400/LMS_Table2.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/Sbf30JpcGYI/AAAAAAAAAG4/P13L3Ec682I/s1600-h/LMS_Table+2.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/Sbf30JpcGYI/AAAAAAAAAG4/P13L3Ec682I/s400/LMS_Table+2.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />For workers &#8216;crisis&#8217; is normally defined as a cut in retirement benefits at some point in the future. In its more invidious form this translates into &#8216;Social Security will not be there for me&#8217;, i.e. &#8216;no check&#8217;. Well this can&#8217;t happen, as long as FICA payroll tax is being collected and dedicated to Social Security then checks at some level will still continue to go out. Still the Trustees tell us in the 2008 Report that benefits after 2041 will only be 78% of those payable in 2040. They further tell us that we could backfill that gap with a 1.7% immediate increase in payroll tax split between employer and employee or roughly double that if we wait until the last minute. LMS was published in Dec 2005 and the numbers were a little different, at that point the Trustees told us that benefits after 2041 would only be 76% of those payable in 2040 unless we raised payroll tax immediately by 1.92%. (The reason why the projected gap shrank and so the cost of the fix from 2005 to 2008 is a good question for another time.)</p>
<p>If we look at Table 1 we clearly see that the authors of LMS are not first and foremost concerned with a better check, not at least for the typical situation where the male earner predeceases the female earner. LMS freely accepts that lower earners will have to take a 4-15% cut relative to the schedule and that single earners at all levels will take a net 9-15% cut. At first glance it looks like only high income two earning couples make out. But even that is deceiving as we will see.</p>
<p>Now some might give the authors the benefit of the doubt and point out that 85% is better than (then) 76%. A look at Table 2 will disabuse you of that notion. Under 2005 projections we could provide a 100% result with a 1.92% increase or in other words an improvement of 24 points. Which suggests we could get about a 12 point jump with a 1.0% increase or an 88% result. Meaning for the low income one earner couple they could get a better result just by accepting the provision for a payroll cap increase (here called &#8216;raise taxable minimum&#8217;) which is scored at 1.0%. Or they could close even more of the gap by just accepting an increase in retirement age which is scored at .62%. Those two provisions alone reduced the projected gap down to 0.30% which for a low earning couple making $30,000 translates to $90 per year. That is raise the cap, increase retirement age, and pay less than $2 a week and &#8216;crisis&#8217; defined as &#8216;benefit cut compared to the schedule&#8217; just vanishes.</p>
<p>But is worse than that. What Table 2 doesn&#8217;t show is the provision that would directly raise payroll by 1.5% ANYWAY. Which itself would generate about 18 points of improvement meaning that everyone would get a (74+18=) 92% benefit just from the proposed tax increase. In fact lower and medium level workers would get a better deal just by cutting that tax increase by 33% to 1.0% and raising the cap for another 1.0%. Boom! that 1.92% payroll gap would be more than erased. And the point only gets sharper if you substitute the current 1.7% gap.</p>
<p>So what do lower income workers gain from LMS and its PRAs? Well nothing really, and even that assumes 6.5% real returns on equities. Instead they are promised 2.7% in combined benefit cuts plus 1.5% in tax increases so as maybe to backfill about a third of the benefit cut that &#8220;Nothing&#8221; promises them today. You don&#8217;t have to be a math genius to understand that throwing 4.2% of combined payroll equivalent at a problem scored at 1.92% and only closing 9 points of a 24 point gap is not really serving your interest. (And that is not considering the adverse effects resulting from raising the payroll cap.)</p>
<p>In fact the calculations don&#8217;t change much as you move up the income ladder. While the higher income double earning household ends up with a 127% result that comes at the price of paying an extra 1.5% on income up to the existing cap and then 12.4% on income up to the proposed cap.</p>
<p>So &#8216;cui bono&#8217;. Obviously the authors are not defining &#8216;crisis&#8217; in terms of actual wage worker retirement security, because those workers could get better results at much lower costs, clearly they really are not that into us. So for them what is the definition of &#8216;crisis&#8217;? Well a look at Table 3 gives you the needed hint. The table is a little confusing so lets allow the authors to explain it in their own words (with some bolding by me)<br />
<blockquote>Fiscally responsible plan – The plan puts great emphasis on fiscal responsibility – borrowing less from general revenues than any other plan that has been scored by the Social Security actuaries in recent years.  Table 3 compares the LMS plan with other recent Social Security reform plan.  The first column compares general fund transfers to the OASDI Trust Funds.  This is one measure of how much a plan relies upon unspecified resources from outside of Social Security to bring the system into balance.  The LMS plan does not rely at all on general fund transfers, and instead uses changes to benefits and revenues to bring Social Security into balance.  The second column shows the sum of all Social Security cash-flow deficits.  In years in which Social Security benefits exceed revenues, the shortfall must be made up by the general funds of the government either through reductions in other government spending, increases in taxes, or issuing additional debt.  Paying all currently scheduled benefits would require the rest of the government to come up with $6,372 billion in funds over the next 75 years.  Under the LMS plan this number is reduced to $1,456 billion.   None of the other 18 other plans scored by the Office of the Actuary in the past three years has lower cash-flow deficits than the LMS plan.</p></blockquote>
<p>Clearly for the authors of LMS the definition of &#8216;Social Security crisis&#8217; is simply the demands it MIGHT make on the General Fund going forward. (Because of course we could just proceed with a plan of &#8220;Nothing&#8221; and just take our lumps in 2041 (SSA IC) or 2049 (CBO IC) or never (SSA LC)).</p>
<p>Now defenders of LMS might jump into point out that PRAs allow a form if inheritable rights that current Social Security doesn&#8217;t. But the devil is in the details. The authors again:<br />
<blockquote>All payments from PRAs would be paid as annuities, which would initially be required to be fixed, inflation-indexed annuities provided by the Social Security Administration as part of a beneficiary’s regular Social Security benefit.  Full annuitization by age 68 is required, but beneficiaries can choose to spread annuitization between 62 and 68 if so desired.  Married beneficiaries would be required to purchase joint and two-thirds survivor annuities.  Annuities would be 10-year certain annuities to provide payouts to heirs of those who die soon after annuitization.  The total balances in the accounts of the two spouses in a married couple would be split equally in the case of divorce. </p>
<p>Investment options are restricted and full annuitization is required because Social Security is meant to provide a basic level of retirement income support.  For an average earner, the combination of the traditional benefit and PRA annuity will provide a replacement rate of about 35 percent.</p></blockquote>
<p> Hmm so the average working couple (who don&#8217;t happen to die within 10 years of retirement) will have a government issued, inflation adjusted check replacing around 35% of their pre-retirement income. With no inhertable property right. Which sounds a heck of a lot like traditional Social Security. But at least you would be able to control your investments, wouldn&#8217;t you? Well not really.<br />
<blockquote>In order to keep total expected retirement benefits at levels comparable to those specified in current law, the LMS plan establishes personal retirement accounts equal to 3 percent of taxable payroll (using the current-law maximum as the cap).    <br />The investment options for PRAs are designed to limit administrative costs and the risks to investors.  PRAs would be invested with one of 15 private fund companies certified by the government to be eligible to receive PRA deposits.  Each of these fund companies would be required to offer 5 broadly diversified investment options, patterned after the Federal Employee Thrift Savings Program.  A central clearing house would handle transactions.  Social Security actuaries estimate that administrative charges associated with PRAs would be approximately 30 basis points per year.</p></blockquote>
<p> Why not just open the Federal Thrift Savings Program to everyone? With the Social Security Administration acting as that &#8216;central clearing house&#8217;?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think that Liebman and MacGuineas at least were motivated by simple ideological hostility to the New Deal, Liebman after all taking posts in both the Clinton and Obama Administrations and <a href="http://www.crfb.org/html/aboutStaff.htm">Maya MacGuineas</a> just being a centrist deficit hawk. For that matter I don&#8217;t think even Samwick is driven by anything other than a commitment to traditional market economics that reflexively prefers private to public solutions, even as here where the &#8216;private&#8217; is more or less symbolic. But what is clear is that none of them are driven by some progressive impulse to improve the economic condition of wage workers now or in retirement.</p>
<p>Conclusion. When someone comes up to you and claims that Social Security is in &#8216;crisis&#8217; and needs &#8216;reform&#8217; you should be asking them three questions: how do they define &#8216;crisis&#8217;, what do I get out of their &#8216;reform&#8217;, and what is it going to cost me. And that is not class warfare or denial or anything else. It is instead just a market transaction, make  the cost/benefit case for why a societal problem scored at 1.92% or 1.7% of payroll needs to be paid for by a combined 5.2% package paid for exclusively by wage workers.</p>
<p>(And no, &#8216;retirement gift for President Bush&#8217; doesn&#8217;t make the cut&#8217;)</p>

<p>Andrew Biggs <a target="_blank" href="http://andrewgbiggs.blogspot.com/2009/03/charleston-post-courier-opposition-not.html">references</a> an editorial from the  Charleston SC Post and Courier <a target="_blank" href="http://www.charleston.net/news/2009/mar/10/advance_entitlement_reform74401/">Advance Entitlements Reform</a><br />
<blockquote>However, President Obama&#8217;s major entitlement-reform offensive strikes on the Medicare front. He proposed, in his speech to Congress, to deliver &#8220;quality, affordable health care for every American&#8221; while also bringing runaway costs under control. That challenging goal contradicts the president&#8217;s contention, in the same speech, that he doesn&#8217;t believe in &#8220;bigger government.&#8221;</p>
<p>But just as Democrats, including then-Sen. Obama, shouldn&#8217;t have rejected President George W. Bush&#8217;s Social Security reform proposals without offering coherent counterproposals, Republicans who oppose President Obama&#8217;s health-care ideas should offer tangible counterproposals on Medicare reform, too.</p></blockquote>
<p> And then Biggs comments as follows<br />
<blockquote>In 2005, there was little public or media pressure on Democrats to put their own Social Security reform plan on the table; it was sufficient that they merely oppose President Bush&#8217;s plan. I suspect the same won&#8217;t be true for Obama&#8217;s health proposals, so those who wish to take a different path on health care shouldn&#8217;t be complacent that opposition is enough.</p></blockquote>
<p>The second assertion is perfectly sound, every serious person agrees that the current track of medical inflation is unsustainable, either we need to restrict coverage even more or find some other way to control costs in a way that allows us to maintain or hopefully expand coverage, doing &#8220;Nothing&#8221; not being a credible alternative. But the same is not true for Social Security, the situations are just not as symmetrical as Biggs would have us believe. Before explaining why I want to include the two paragraphs immediately following from the Post and Courier editorial.<br />
<blockquote>The status quo will lock Medicare on a track toward a balance-sheet train wreck. Medicare trustees warned last year that the system, on its present course, would run out of money by 2019.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, such familiar alarms about Medicare — and Social Security — have long fallen on deaf ears, perpetuating delays in dealing with their problems. With each buck-passing postponement of the hard choices required to achieve long-term solvency, the tasks get more expensive, and thus more likely to send politicians running for cover.</p></blockquote>
<p>Oops. There are a couple of errors operating here. To see what they are you can follow me below the fold. </p>
<p>As to Medicare. First of all Medicare is not a monolith, its various Parts draw their funding from different sources. That is Part B-Doctors and Part D-Drugs draw their funding from the General Fund and as such cannot &#8220;run out of money&#8221; anymore than the Defense Department can. The decision of whether to finance visits to the doctor&#8217;s office vs buying F-22s is a policy choice and not on a inevitable track to anywhere, still less a &#8220;balance-sheet wreck&#8221;. So that is error number one.</p>
<p>Error number two is a little more subtle. Medicare Part A-Hospital, which makes up just over half of overall Medicare is indeed funded by payroll taxes whose surpluses and deficits are credited to the HI (Hospital Insurance) Trust Fund. And that Trust Fund is indeed slated for depletion in 2019. Does that mean that Part A will &#8220;run out of money&#8221;. Well no, not in the sense that the editorial implies. To see why we need to step back and look at the language of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cms.hhs.gov/ReportsTrustFunds/downloads/tr2008.pdf">2008 Medicare Report</a> itself.<br />
<blockquote>Under the intermediate assumptions the HI trust fund is projected to be exhausted in 2019, the same year as in last year’s report but at an earlier point within the year, due to slightly lower projected payroll tax income and slightly higher projected benefits than previously estimated. For the 75-year projection period, the actuarial deficit is virtually the same as in last year’s report, at 3.54 rather than 3.55 percent of taxable payroll.</p></blockquote>
<p>If we unpack this a little we see that not much harm was done by doing &#8220;Nothing&#8221; in 2007, you got a little slippage in the date of Trust Fund Depletion offset somewhat by a tiny bit of improvement in the actual actuarial deficit. In contrast lets look at the equivalent passage in the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cms.hhs.gov/ReportsTrustFunds/downloads/tr2007.pdf">2007 Medicare Report</a><br />
<blockquote>Under the intermediate assumptions the HI trust fund is projected to be exhausted in 2019, 1 year later than in last year’s report, due to slightly higher projected payroll tax income and slightly lower projected benefits than previously estimated. For the 75-year projection period, the actuarial deficit is little different from that in last year’s report, at 3.55 rather than 3.51 percent of taxable payroll.</p></blockquote>
<p>That is if you had just jumped from the 2006 Report to the 2008 you would have seen HI Trust Fund Depletion pushed back by a year even as the actuarial gap increased from 3.51% to 3.54%. This isn&#8217;t an argument for doing &#8220;Nothing&#8221; for Medicare but it renders this from the editorial as being somewhat over heated: <i>With each buck-passing postponement of the hard choices required to achieve long-term solvency, the tasks get more expensive</i>. Well maybe yes and maybe no. Because as we can see the process is not linear, better payroll receipts can push the depletion date back, worse ones can move it up, but in the end Medicare Part A can never run OUT of money in the absolute sense, it can only run SHORT of money. The distinction may seem academic but it is the difference between maybe needing to ration care and cutting off Medicare altogether. The Post and Courier is shouting apocalypse while reality is stating problem. This is particularly so when the proposed solution to some projected shortfall necessitating rationing in 2019 is just to start rationing care today, that just defines the problem as the solution.</p>
<p>Still the editorial&#8217;s overall point on Medicare is sound, the Republicans really just can&#8217;t be the party of &#8216;No&#8217; on Health Care. But the same is not true of Democrats on Social Security. When Biggs states the following he is establishing a false parallel.<br />
<blockquote>In 2005, there was little public or media pressure on Democrats to put their own Social Security reform plan on the table; it was sufficient that they merely oppose President Bush&#8217;s plan.</p></blockquote>
<p>First of all there was some media pressure, it is just that the push-back came in the form of &#8216;There is no crisis&#8217; on the sensible grounds that there was a big difference between a problem that probably would manifest itself by 2018 or so (Medicare) and certainly would do so before mid-century (Health Care generally) and a problem that might manifest itself by 2041 and was in any event on a much smaller scale (Social Security). To lift my own comment from Biggs (additions in italics).<br />
<blockquote>Democrats had a coherent counterproposal. It just was too simple to be comprehended by the Post and Courier.</p>
<p>Take 1.89%. <i>Payroll gap per 2004 Report</i> Add four years of &#8216;Nothing&#8217;. Result? 1.7% <i>Payroll gap per 2008 Report</i><br />http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR04/II_conclu.html#wp86802</p>
<p>Now you can take other starting and ending points. For example I could take 2004 and 2006 and get the results 1.89% and 2.02%. Or I could change measures and use 2004 and 2008 to yield 2042 and 2041. And then if you like do some elaborate calculations to calculate the savings or loss in current dollars of not implementing a fix in 2004.</p>
<p>No one has to agree with Dean Baker that this is just a Phony Crisis promulgated by people &#8220;who say they want to fix the roof (but) actually want to knock holes in it&#8221;. And there may be some force in the argument that unfunded liability over the Infinite Future Horizon creates serious issues of inter-generational inequity that will need to be addressed at some point or another. (Personally I am with Dean and think the latter argument is hooey.)</p>
<p>But wherever you land on the fundamental question the twin assertions of &#8220;We can&#8217;t afford to wait&#8221; and &#8220;The cost will only get greater if we delay&#8221; just are not supported by the historical record from 1997 to 2008. Now oddly they were supported by that record from 1993 to 1996 and retrospectively they may end up being supported by the record from 2008-2011. But from the actual standpoint of March 2009 there just isn&#8217;t a whole bunch of the &#8220;Fierce urgency of Now&#8221; operating.</p>
<p>The 2006 Report was quite the disappointment, the outlook as a percentage of payroll having darkened significantly since 2004. Did this mean the &#8220;There is no Crisis&#8221; people of spring 2005 had egg on their face? Well not really because you could calculate with some precision the <a target="_blank" href="http://bruceweb.blogspot.com/2006/05/cost-of-inactivity-nothing-as-plan-for.html">Cost of Inactivity</a> between any two time points. And knock on wood for all &#8216;current participants&#8217; in all years and for all &#8216;future participants&#8217; in every year but 2006 the cost of sticking with the Democratic plan of &#8220;Nothing&#8221; as a plan for Social Security has been negative, that is workers have been left dollars ahead.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing&#8221; is not a particularly compelling plan, it doesn&#8217;t fit neatly within the conventions of reporting on policy. Which doesn&#8217;t mean it has not proved to be a numerically sound plan. Since 1997.</p></blockquote>
<p>That is there is no such thing as SocialSecurityMedicareMedicaid and it is not at all hypocritical for Democrats to have refused to endorse some type of reform for Social Security in 2005 while demanding Republicans get off the stump on Medicare in 2009. You simply get a fiercer urgency from 2019 than you do from 2041 (or 2049).</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing&#8221;. The numerically proven plan for Social Security since 1997.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing&#8221;. The &#8216;so far we have dodged the bullet&#8217; plan for Medicare. 2019 is not a drop dead point for Medicare, it doesn&#8217;t actually effect Parts B and D in the first place and only effects Part A in minor ways to start with (the actuarial gap being just under 1% of payroll at that point), we have the time to get Medicare the right &#8220;Something&#8221; and should. But that doesn&#8217;t mean Democrats have any obligation to budge on Social Security.</p>

<p>In a world where we actually had our priorities straight we wouldn&#8217;t even be talking about Social Security. The country, the world is sick with fear about our jobs, about keeping our houses, about the plunging values in our 401ks. The LAST thing we need is the Peter G. Petersons fear-mongering Social Security. Why do they do it anyway? Well that is a topic for comments, what this post proposes to do is to supply people with the necessary weapons to beat these people back so that we can address the real world problems.</p>
<p>Discussion of Social Security should but mostly doesn&#8217;t start with the annual <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/index.html">Reports of the Trustees</a>. Each year since 1941 the Trustees have released a detailed report on the financial status of Social Security and all of them are available in a variety of formats. Yet hardly anyone seems to have read them. Why? Because they are long and boring and chock full of numbers. Moreover there are mine fields along the way. Because between the professionals who generate the numbers and the Congress to whom they are officially directed are situated the six Trustees. To the extent that people know the Trustees exist they tend to believe they are apolitical technocrats. Au contraire mon frere, instead they are all Presidential appointees including three cabinet secretaries and all typically committed to advancing the President&#8217;s agenda. Which for the last eight years has been privatization. The consequence has been that the shorter versions of the Reports: the Status Report, the Summary and the Press Release are subtly infused with ideological spin. So before just diving in most people would benefit from getting some instruction from the dive masters. Names and directions under the fold.</p>
<p>These days Dean Baker is probably best known for his role in calling the Housing Bubble early and often, most recently from his perch at his TAP blog <a target="_blank" href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/beat_the_press">Beat the Press</a> where on a daily basis he excoriates the coverage of the MSM on all things economic. (The WaPo coming in for some really serious beat downs). But before his gig at BTP he was known as the chief promoter of the claim that opponents of Social Security were really not being animated by a desire to &#8216;fix&#8217; a system in &#8216;crisis&#8217; but instead on dismantling it. With colleauge Mark Weisbrot he published in 1999 <a target="_blank" href="http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/035468.html">Social Security: the Phony Crisis</a> Excerpts from the Introduction are available at the link but the first few paragraphs are worth copying here:<br />
<blockquote>We have a chance, said President Clinton, to “fix the roof while the sun is still shining.” He was talking about dealing with Social Security immediately, while the economy is growing and the federal budget is balanced. The audience was a regional conference on Social Security, in Kansas City, Missouri, that the White House had helped bring together.</p>
<p>The roof analogy is illuminating, but we can make it more accurate. Imagine that it’s not going to rain for more than 30 years. And the rain, when it does arrive (and it might not), will be pretty light. And imagine that the average household will have a lot more income for roof repair by the time the rain approaches.</p>
<p>Now add this: most of the people who say they want to fix the roof actually want to knock holes in it.</p></blockquote>
<p> And probably the most prominent of those fixers (and already called out by name by Dean and Mark in 1999) is Peter G. Peterson, founder and more importantly funder of the Concord Coalition and the Peter G Peterson Foundation. Now Concord bills it self as follows:<br />
<blockquote>The Concord Coalition is dedicated to educating the public about the causes and consequences of federal budget deficits, the long-term challenges facing America&#8217;s unsustainable entitlement programs, and how to build a sound economy for future generations.</p></blockquote>
<p> But as the quote suggests they tend to strongly draw a line between &#8217;causes&#8217; of &#8216;federal budget deficits&#8217; and &#8216;unsustainable entitlement programs&#8217;. Other parts of the deficit crisis are alluded to in passing, but generally their discussion starts and stops with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.concordcoalition.org/learn/entitlements/entitlements">Entitlements</a>, a word that Concord may not have coined but has certainly promulgated. Most recently Concord and the PGP Foundation have been publically pushing their <a target="_blank" href="http://www.concordcoalition.org/act/fiscal-wake-tour">Fiscal Wake-up Tour</a> itself covered in documentary form with the movie <a target="_blank" href="http://www.concordcoalition.org/iousa/iousa-movie">I.O.U.S.A.</a>. While this movie was recently shown on CNN without much editorial comment it is not a neutral statement at all. Instead it is more of an infomercial designed to sell Social Security &#8216;crisis&#8217;.</p>
<p>Okay having established that Dean is the champion of Social Security and Pete G. Peterson is the adversary, where do you go to fill out your knowledge? Well you could stay close to home and read the essays put up by Dale Coberly here at AB <a target="_blank" href="http://bruceweb.blogspot.com/2009/02/coberly-on-social-security-at-angry.html">Coberly on Social Security</a> or by me <a target="_blank" href="http://bruceweb.blogspot.com/2008/08/angry-bear-social-security-series.html">Angry Bear Social Security Series</a> perhaps starting with <a target="_blank" href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/02/social-security-simple-story-vs-myth.html">Social Security: Simple Story vs. Myth Busting</a> but I would suggest making a first stop at Lee A. Arnold&#8217;s animation <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tts2uTWt6e8">Social Security: a Polemic (in Ecolanguage)</a></p>
<p>At this point you would be prepared to go into the Reports themselves. You would want to first read the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/trTOC.html">Overview</a> keeping in mind that it is in part a political document and then jump into the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/trLOT.html">List of Tables</a> and the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/trLOF.html">List of Figures</a>. In toto this is a little of an information overload, to start with you need to look at the following:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/VI_cyoper_history.html#159726">Table VI.A4.—Historical Operations of the Combined OASI and DI Trust Funds, Calendar Years 1957-2007 [Amounts in billions]</a>. This tells you where Social Security has actually been. (Note in particular how small the balances were under Johnson and Reagan, the notion that the former used Social Security to fund the Great Society or that the latter raided it to pay for tax cuts are in numeric context ridiculous, there just wasn&#8217;t that much money there.)<br />Now you can check out where Social Security is projected to go under the three alternatives: Low Cost, Intermediate Cost, and High Cost <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/VI_OASDHI_dollars.html#150920">Table VI.F8.—Operations of the Combined OASI and DI Trust Funds, in Current Dollars, Calendar Years 2008-85 [In billions]</a>. (Note that Low Cost has Social Security fully funded and even overfunded going forwards.)<br />To get some idea about which alternative is most probable you can look at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/V_economic.html#188118">Table V.B1: Principal Economic Assumptions</a> &#038;<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/V_economic.html#200328">Table V.B2: Additional Economic Factors</a> keeping in mind that the most important numbers are &#8216;Ultimate&#8217; ones, where the Reports see the economy settling out over the long run.<br />To see how realistic the demographic assumptions are you would look at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/V_demographic.html#205410">Table V.A1.—Principal Demographic Assumptions, Calendar Years 1940-2085</a></p>
<p>So after reading Dean and watching Lee and dabbling in the offerings put up by Dale and me and examining the numbers in the above five tables you would be better armed than the vast majority of people out there who purport to know something about Social Security. And you would be in pretty good shape to make a claim about which of the following outcomes is in fact more probable. (Alternative II is Intermediate Cost, and the only one ever talked about in the media. It shows the standard story of Trust Fund peaking in the early 2020s and declining to zero in 2041. But if we end up with anything close to Alternative I which is Low Cost we will be having a whole different discussion going forwards.)</p>

<p>The Treasury Department maintains a handy web application called <a target="_blank" href="http://www.treasurydirect.gov/NP/BPDLogin?application=np">Debt to the Penny</a>. As the name suggests it will give you total Public Debt to the penny for specific dates in the past or for a range of dates. It is this total Public Debt figure that is generally cited in news coverage, resulting in reporting that debt under Bush went from $5,727,776,738,304.64 on Jan 19, 2001 to $10,626,877,048,913.08 on Jan 20, 2009. If theoretically Bush had continued Clinton era fiscal policies and had Clinton era outcomes would the the final Total Debt figure be higher that $5.7 trillion? Or lower? or About the same?</p>
<p>The obvious, intuitive answer would be &#8216;lower&#8217;. That is even small General Fund surpluses serve to lower overall debt and that effect  combined with the higher rate of real wages experienced in Clinton&#8217;s terms means higher revenue and  an even greater surplus in Social Security, so General Fund surplus plus  Social Security surplus = lower debt. Right?</p>
<p>Hmm, well, no, not necessarily. To see why you can follow this below the fold. Just be sure to bring your headache medication of choice.</p>
<p> Because a closer look at Debt to the Penny shows that Treasury tracks two different debt categories: Debt held by the Public and Intragovernmental Holdings and combines them to get total Public Debt. And more than half of Intragovernmental Holdings are made up of the Special Treasuries in the Social Security Trust Funds. The Bush years did not put any serious holes in long-term possibilities for Social Security solvency, results approaching total system solvency being by my calculations more probable than not. That doesn&#8217;t mean the TF came through unscathed. Per the 2001 Report&#8217;s Intermediate Cost projections toward year end 2008 TF balance was projected to be $2.808 trillion up from $1.049 trillion.  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR01/II_project.html#98733">Table II.D1.- Abbreviated Operations of the Combined OASI and DI Trust Funds, Calendar Years 2000-10 [Amounts in billions]</a>  Instead it ended up at $2.4 trillion.</p>
<p>So if we return to our theoretical scenario we would have Clinton era small General Fund surpluses combined presumedly with Intermediate Cost SS surpluses. But our equation changes. Now we have General Fund surplus MINUS Social Security surplus = total debt. Whether the resultant is higher or lower than the original $5.7 trillion in total debt is difficult to calculate in precise terms but it seems likely that the growth in the TF by $1.75 trillion (2001 projection ) would have likely been significantly more than the cumulative GF surplus meaning that the Debt Clock would have continued to tick.</p>
<p>If we examine the Social Security Reports from 1997 to 2007 we see that the optimistic Low Cost alternative projects what would seem to be a Goldilocks outcome, with the porridge being neither too hot or too cold. After all what is it about fully funded benefits with no needed changes in taxation or retirement age is there not to like? Well nothing really. Until you start looking at issues of intergenerational equity. Because how does Low Cost translate to the Debt Clock in future years?</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/VI_OASDHI_dollars.html#150920">Table VI.F8.—Operations of the Combined OASI and DI Trust Funds, in Current Dollars, Calendar Years 2008-85 [In billions]</a><br />2040 $11.7 trillion; 2060 $28.3 trillion; 2080 $88.0 trillion and all of that scoring as debt on the Debt Clock. That is why I get headaches, fully funded Social Security translating to ever mounting total Public Debt.</p>
<p>Which only compound when I consider the flipping point. Under Low Cost assumptions Social Security relies on interest earned on the TF to fill the gap between revenue from taxes and total cost for every year from 2023-2064. But the actual principal in the TF is entirely due to excess contributions made by workers from 1983-2023. In 2065 Low Cost projections would have tax revenues once again exceeding cost without needing to tap the interest on the principal which at that point would total $37.0 trillion. Who has the moral claim to that money? In 2065 there will be substantial numbers of retirees who were in the work force prior to 2023. But only that fraction of them who owe tax on benefits are still contributing anything and their whole cohort has secure benefits going forward, they can be made whole by eliminating tax on benefits. So what claim do those workers who entered the work force after 2023 but before 2065 really have? Sure their contributions served to largely fund the retirement of people before them, but only &#8216;largely&#8217; because a substantial part of that cost was picked up by interest on surplus  payroll contributions they never had to pay, to some degree they have had a subsidized ride and have been made whole as is. And the worker entering the workforce in 2065 doesn&#8217;t have too much of a claim on the balance given that he has yet to pay anything at all and is projected to get full benefits.</p>
<p>The simplest answer is to first simply write down the TF in 2065 from $37 trillion to $7.5 trillion (one year of reserves) and then reduce FICA to the level where it plus interest on the remaining $7.5 trillion will continue to meet total cost. And then secondly commit to rebating to surviving retirees any lifetime tax on benefits paid. In this scenario nobody gets seriously screwed, they paid their insurance premium in the form of payroll tax, everyone gets full benefits. But viewed from another light it is just a $29.5 trillion dollar gift to those people who were on the hook previously, i.e. high income earners who just end up with a huge liability lifted. Meaning that the people who borrowed all that money from 1983 to 2023, or at least their heirs, get a windfall while still have being able to put their boots in the sides of Boomers and Gen-Xers (who themselves would have been fooled into blaming Boomers all along).</p>
<p>This is not a simple story, which is why it gives me headaches to explain. But it goes to show why Social Security surpluses are not an unalloyed good. Instead they can serve to create a mental picture of total debt that is disconnected with economic reality. If we end up achieving Low Cost outcomes, or outcomes close to that, and as a result at some point in the next fifty years we end up writing down the TF by $29 trillion, is that portion of the principal really debt that should be scored on the Debt Clock in the meantime? Certainly it was a liability to the degree that interest had to be paid on at least a portion of it (in the mid-thirties this approaches 50% of accrued interest needing to be tapped in any given year, that percentage drops over time). Well it is hard to say.</p>
<p>Moral? Don&#8217;t let the Pete G. Peterson people get a backdoors victory by trumpeting Total Debt while slyly denying that the Trust Fund is  real. Because if it is not real to the degree that Peterson et al are never going to have to pay the borrowed money back, either because the economy grows fast enough to mean it is not needed in the end or because they will just get us to accept lower benefits, then it ends up being no more debt than &#8216;unfunded liability&#8217; means an actual liability. They are calling &#8216;debt&#8217; to scare you into actions that remove that debt. From their ledgers. Because Peterson would still have workers be screwed in the form of lower benefits.</p>
<p>(BTW these calculations show why Buffpilot&#8217;s claim that Clinton didn&#8217;t reduce debt is not quite right. First of all some of that &#8216;debt&#8217; was really SS surpluses, and second he ignores inflation by using nominal and not real numbers.)</p>

<p>Not in any real world sense. And before shaking your head in sorrow at the fact that Bruce seemingly has lost it given the numbers in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/IV_LRest.html#267528">Table IV.B6.—Unfunded OASDI Obligations for 1935 (Program Inception)Through the Infinite Horizon</a> which clearly show a $4.3 trillion dollar gap over the 75 year window and a $13.6 trillion gap over &#8216;Infinite Horizon&#8217;, consider that obviously I know the Table exists, in fact here it is.<br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SaV6gOsq7hI/AAAAAAAAAGg/64I6RAepCbU/s1600-h/Table+IV.B6.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SaV6gOsq7hI/AAAAAAAAAGg/64I6RAepCbU/s400/Table+IV.B6.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />Plus its brother which throws a $17.4 trillion and a $15.6 trillion at us. Meaning that depending on how you define it and what time period you chose the Trustees tell us the unfunded obligation runs somewhere between $4.3 trillion and $17.4 trillion (source of the &#8216;$17.4 trillion backwards transfer). <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/IV_LRest.html#267012">Table IV.B7.—Present Values of OASDI Cost Less Tax Revenue and Unfunded Obligations for Program Participant</a><br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SaV6gHDKY-I/AAAAAAAAAGo/9xSIMo2yAf4/s1600-h/Table+IV.B7.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SaV6gHDKY-I/AAAAAAAAAGo/9xSIMo2yAf4/s400/Table+IV.B7.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a> Click to enlarge either table.<br />Given that how can I possibly claim that the &#8216;Unfunded Liability&#8217; doesn&#8217;t exist? Because unless you are the Commissioner of Social Security or one of the Trustees it just doesn&#8217;t equate to a real life event. To understand why you would need to follow me under the fold.</p>
<p>The key is to understand that the Commissioner and the Trustees are constrained by current law. While the Trustees tend to talk about events at depletion as being automatic<br />
<blockquote>If no action were taken until the combined trust funds become exhausted in 2041, then the effects of changes would be more concentrated on fewer years and fewer cohorts:<br />•<br />For example, payroll taxes could be raised to finance scheduled benefits fully in every year starting in 2041. In this case, the payroll tax would be increased to 15.94 percent at the point of trust fund exhaustion in 2041 and continue rising to 16.60 percent in 2082.<br />•<br />Similarly, benefits could be reduced to the level that is payable with scheduled tax rates in each year beginning in 2041. Under this scenario, benefits would be reduced 22 percent at the point of trust fund exhaus tion in 2041, with reductions reaching 25 percent in 2082.</p></blockquote>
<p> in fact they are not, the Commissioner and the Trustees having neither the authority to change the benefit schedule or the FICA rate, that being reserved to Congress. Which one way or another will simply eliminate some or most of the so-called &#8216;unfunded liability&#8217;.</p>
<p>Currently Social Security is faced with certain &#8216;inflection&#8217; points. One is Shortfall, the date that income excluding interest (i.e. tax) falls behind total cost. Under Intermediate Cost projections that is set at 2017. At that point some of the accrued interest on the Trust Fund which heretofore had simply been &#8216;funded&#8217; by crediting the TF with Special Treasuries (which are not funded with current year borrowing) instead has to come from the General Fund. Initially the effect is small, the Trust Fund continuing to grow right to the point that all interest has to be funded by current year borrowing. This point which I call &#8216;Peak&#8217; is projected for 2023. After Peak funding full benefits means redeeming the accumulated Special Treasuries until they are gone. This event is called TF Depletion and under SSA projections is set for 2041. (The CBO uses somewhat different calculations and gets different dates but that is immaterial for the purposes of this discussion).</p>
<p>Now people vary on whether we should see Shortfall or Peak or Depletion as the key date for &#8216;Crisis&#8217; but come what may under Intermediate Cost assumptions at some point Congress has to act, precisely because the Trustees are constrained by current law. Lets say Congress just decides to procrastinate right to Depletion. At this point they have some choices. They could raise FICA by 3.54% points or they could cut benefits by 22% or they could do some combination or they could do what the Greenspan Commission did and just do enough to kick the problem down the road for another 30 or 40 years. But whatever they do at a stroke they eliminate most to all of the &#8216;unfunded liability&#8217;. Because tax increases serve to fund the liability while benefit cuts serve to eliminate it and there is no third alternative being that the Commissioner has no ability to borrow money.</p>
<p>Seen properly &#8216;unfunded liability&#8217; is just a fictive artifact stemming from the Trustees having to assume current law. If they are able to pay full benefits they are obligated to do so, to that extent there is a liability. But it is limited, if Congress decides to fund that liability it will be paid, if Congress deliberately decides not to the liability goes away.</p>
<p>It is useful and even crucially important to understand the gap between projected revenue and projected cost at the point of Trust Fund depletion. It is equally useful but not particularly important to examine that gap in some future year. What is not useful is to sum up those amounts and hang them like the Sword of Damocles over our heads. The summed gaps are not legal liabilities because Congress is free to eliminate them. Now some might consider them moral liabilities and potentially the needed changes would lead to some political liabilities for that future Congress, but the notion that every child born in America automatically inherits $150,000 in unfunded debt is hooey. Because before 2041 actions will be taken to either fund that debt or write it off and poof that &#8216;Unfunded Liability&#8217; vanishes.</p>
<p>_________________<br />On a somewhat different note I would ask you to take a look at Table IV.B7. First it tells us there is a $17.4 trillion dollar gap between future tax revenues and future costs for &#8216;Current participants&#8217;. This is the source of the claim that the problem is do to over generosity to people in the past. This is just not true, examination of the Tables shows that every penny of that $17.4 trillion is &#8216;owed&#8217; to a subset of retirees projected to be drawing benefits between 2041 and 2108. The Report puts it as follows:<br />
<blockquote>The first line of table IV.B7 shows that the present value of future cost less future taxes over the next 100 years for all current participants equals $17.4 trillion. For this purpose, current participants are defined as individuals who attain age 15 or older in 2008. Subtracting the current value of the trust fund (the accumulated value of past OASDI taxes less cost) gives a closed group (excluding all future participants) unfunded obligation of $15.2 trillion. This value represents the shortfall of lifetime contributions for all past and current participants relative to the lifetime costs associated with their generations. For a fully‑advance‑funded program this value would be equal to zero.</p></blockquote>
<p> This may be the most political passage in the main body of the Report which by and large is pretty straightforward. Then again the whole notion of &#8216;Infinite Future Horizon&#8217; wasn&#8217;t introduced until the 2003 Report and it is hard to not suspect that the motivation was political. Because the language is carefully crafted to put the blame on &#8216;past and current participants&#8217; while giving &#8216;future participants&#8217; a pass, leaving of course Gen-Xers to bath in their sense of being persecuted by Boomers. But in point of fact no Gen-Xer is a &#8216;future participant&#8217; instead they are all classified as &#8216;current participants&#8217; and the vast bulk of the projected gap is due to them not being able to fund their own benefits after 2041 and before 2108. A fact that is shown that once you subtract out the excess contributions of &#8216;past and current participants&#8217; (i.e. the current Trust Fund) the gap drops to $15.2 trillion.</p>
<p>Which brings up a second point. &#8216;Past participants&#8217; (i.e. dead people) are clearly paid up, those checks already cashed. And those &#8216;current participants&#8217; who will be dead by 2041 are also paid up. Now those Boomers who will be living for some years after 2041 are on the hook for some portion of the $4.3 trillion of &#8216;unfunded liability&#8217; over the 2041-2082 but not that much being that the total gap between 2008-2057 is just .94% of payroll and not all of that due to us. Instead most of the gap coming in that third 25 year window <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/IV_LRest.html#274087">Table IV.B4.—Components of Summarized Income Rates and Cost Rates, Calendar Years 2008-82[As a percentage of taxable payroll]</a>. Further lets look at the significance of these numbers:<br />$2.2 trillion = Trust Fund i.e excess contributions by past and current participants (including all Boomers)<br />-$4.3 trillion = Gap between tax and cost between 2041 and 2082 less credit for the TF (partially due to Boomers)<br />-$6.5 trillion = Total gap between tax and cost between 2041 and 2082 for all participants (including some future participants born between 1993 and 2015)</p>
<p>-$17.4 trillion = Total gap between tax and cost between 2041 and 2108 for current participants<br />-$15.2 trillion = Total gap between tax and cost between 2041 and 2108 less credit for the TF<br />-$13.6 trillion = Total gap between tax and cost between 2041 and Infinite Future after including the $1.5 trillion surplus from future participants.</p>
<p>So future participants are responsible for a small portion of the $6.5 trillion gap between 2041 and 2082. As are Boomers. But mostly you are talking about Gen-X and leading edge Millenials not paying their way.</p>
<p>Similarly future participants are not at all responsible for that $17.4 gap for current and past participants between 2041 and 2108. Nor are past participants, indeed many of them contributed to the Trust Fund that reduces that gap to $15.2 trillion. And by 2041 Boomers will range from old to dead. Meaning once again we are talking about Gen-X and leading edge Millenials not paying their way.</p>
<p> So when you add it all up almost all of this liability derives from the retirees of 2058-2108 not including any of those born after 1993. The very youngest Boomer will be 94 in 2058. And any of our grandkids born after 1993 will actually be contributing to a long term surplus. Meaning almost all of the problem derives from Gen-Xers and leading Millenials scheduled to get some $14+ trillion or so of extra benefits over contributions.</p>
<p>&#8216;Backwards transfer&#8217; my ass. Instead Boomers not only paid benefits for the Greatest Generation, we are projected to pay almost all of our own benefits and now are asked to take cuts so that Gen-X doesn&#8217;t feel aggrieved by adjustments to benefits after around 2029. Whereas if they just got off the couch and grew the economy like Boomers and our parents and grandparents did everybody gets paid in full.</p>
<p>But I guess it is more fun to whine about &#8216;Selfish Boomers&#8217; than to do the actual arithmetic.</p>

                                <p>guest post by Coberly</p>
<p>A few years ago the Social Security Trustees began publishing a warning that went something like this: &#8220;After the year 2040 Social Security will only be able to meet 75% of promised benefits.&#8221; </p>
<p>You may have gotten this message in the mail, or heard it while waiting to talk to Social Security on the telephone. But look at what it really says. </p>
<p>If Social Security can meet 3/4 of promised benefits with the existing tax, it could meet ALL promised benefits with a 33% tax raise. 3/4 times 4/3 equals One. </p>
<p>But the current tax is 6.2% of payroll. 33% of 6.2 is 2.1. So a 2% raise in the payroll tax would enable Social Security to meet all promised benefits. </p>
<p>Current average income is 700 dollars per week. 2% of 700 is 14 dollars. (For a low wage worker, the tax increase would be about 7 dollars per week.) </p>
<p>Projected average income in 2040 is 1000 dollars per week. 2% of 1000 is 20 dollars per week. </p>
<p>So Social Security can be &#8220;saved&#8221; by a 20 dollar increase in tax on an income that has increased by 300 dollars by the time the raise is needed. The reason the raise will be needed is to pay for the six extra years of life expectancy those future tax payers will have compared to us. The 20 dollar raise will preserve their benefits at current replacement value and allow them to retire at the normal age. </p>
<p>This is not a crisis. </p>
<p>I can say a great deal more about this. But this is enough for lesson one. Except to point out that Peter Peterson has convinced everyone, including some bi-partisan experts and possibly Barack Obama that 20 dollars times 2 (boss&#8217;s share) times 52 weeks times 200 million taxpayers times 75 years is an &#8220;Unfunded Deficit of 31 Trillion Dollars!!&#8221; Which of course it is. He hopes you will not do the arithmetic and realize it is still only 20 dollars a week. Or realize that it is &#8220;unfunded&#8221; because we don&#8217;t need to pay for it in advance. <br />__________________________<br />guest post by Coberly.</p>
