                                <p>Reader Arne, a long time and well informed commenter submitted to Tuesday&#8217;s Social Security post a list of seven deceptively simple in form questions to get my take on them. Which I gave in comments. Unfortunately what HaloScan gives it can take away and a time this morning both his questions and my answers had vanished. Well they came back and I thought it useful to front page them and invite readers either to attempt their own answers or comment on mine.</p>
<p>Remember the rules. Anyone can ask for a response to a question or argument. No one has the right to demand one. Silence in this case does not equate to consent.That said what is on your mind? Anything related to Social Security is fair game. But first over to Arne.</p>
<p>Here are some questions I think are interesting, but I would prefer to see Bruce post them with his thoughts and for others to try to stay tightly on-topic. </p>
<p>1) What should we do if the SSA intermedicate forecast is right? When and how would we change? <br />2) Which is really more important, productivity or demographics?<br />3) Given that the TF lasts at least 20 more years, is moving (some of) it from US Treasuries to equities a good idea? How does that change with LC instead of IC?<br />4) Is solvency relevent? {mild edit to remove a side irrelevant side issue} <br />5) Are the stochastic projections (Appendix E) meaningful?<br />6) What do the 1984 and 1985 reports show us about intent?<br />7) Why did the TF ratio outperform expectations in the late 90&#8217;s? Can it do so again?</p>
<p>1. Well there are two answers to that. One would rely on what I call Rosser&#8217;s Equation and point out that &#8216;crisis&#8217; means a 78% result of a benefit scheduled at 160% relative to what similarly situated retirees get today. Since 78% of 160% = 125% and the event if and when will come after I am gone, I don&#8217;t see why I should get exercised about this one way or another. Particularly if the plan to avoid sticker shock is just to phase it in faster. So one perfectly good response is Nothing.</p>
<p>The second answer would be to point out with Coberly that a tax based solution is in fact pretty cheap. The current payroll gap is down to 1.7% of payroll which for a household of $50,000 would require an $850 a year fix, or half that if you examine that from an employer/employee split. But as I argue in Cost of Inactivity the trend short term is good and mathematically calculates out to Nothing for now as well.</p>
<p>The legal answer is to wait until the Social Security system falls out of Short Term Actuarial Balance. Under Intermediate Cost assumptions the TF ratio falls below 100 in around 2036, meaning the system would fail the test some nine years earlier or in 2027 which would leave 14 years to 2041 to come to a policy decision, which would be plenty of time and a much more informed information environment. Of course if depletion continues to move out in time then so would this decision point. So once again the answer to your question in the here and now is Nothing. Ask me again in 2027.</p>
<p>2. For decision making? Productivity. Because the Demographics are already built into the model and do not vary much over the short term that will be determinative, which is to say the 2009 to 2012 time period. Fluctuations in fertility obviously only manifest themselves 21 years or so out of phase. Whereas year over year productivity can vary greatly.</p>
<p>3. Diversification of the Trust Fund is in my view a good thing, though equities would not be my choice of asset class. The question is to some degree moot under IC. Surpluses start shrinking after 2017 and vanish after 2023. Given that fairly short investment window the difference in yield probably wouldn&#8217;t offset the risk of markets crashing at just the wrong time. We would be a little embarrassed if the Great Crash of 2023 wiped out most of our portfolio just as we needed to cash parts of it in. Under LC I would argue that diversification is almost an absolute necessity in that it avoids the Interest on Interest problem. If we assume Low Cost and took the current surplus and invested it in outside assets and then reinvested the earnings we would have a chance to really build a portfolio. Under Low Cost the time to tap the Trust Fund portfolio does not start until 2023 and at a much lower rate amounting to 25% of the interest accrued from a portfolio of Special Treasuries, presumedly something less with better yielding outside assets. You can do quite a bit with a reinvestment rate of say 80% of earnings. As to asset class I would pick school and transportation bonds which would serve to create jobs, lower borrowing costs to states and local jurisdictions, yet maintain the predictability of Treasuries.</p>
<p>4. Solvency is relevant because opponents of Social Security have framed the argument in those terms. They chose not to fight this out on straight out ideological, pro market terms. Instead they sold the message of &#8216;bankrupt&#8217;. I can only fight on the battlefield in play and for the most part that is one of Solvency.</p>
<p>5. I don&#8217;t find the Stochastic Projections compelling. I am even less a statistician than I am an economist but the following passage was troubling. Perhaps you could explain it:</p>
<p>&#8220;Each time-series equation is designed such that, in the absence of random variation, the value of the variable would equal the value assumed under the intermediate set of assumptions.&#8221;</p>
<p>The language in Appendix E is rather opaque, perhaps deliberately so, but it seems to build in the assumption that is actually in challenge, that Intermediate Cost is overall a reasonable median. But really the question of the Stochastics are above my pay grade.</p>
<p>6. Well the unkind answer would be to say &#8216;Look&#8217; and link to http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/index.html but I went ahead and checked the 1985 Summary. They essentially gave the system a clean bill of health with the actuarial deficit of Intermediate II-B only being .41% while the 1985 definition of &#8216;close actuarial balance&#8217; was &#8216;estimated average annual income rate between 95% and 105% of the average cost rate&#8217;. So I would sum their intent as &#8216;maybe we fixed it, but lets keep a close eye on it&#8217;. Because they were only .09% of payroll of falling outside their preferred band.<br />http://www.ssa.gov/history/pdf/1985.pdf</p>
<p>7. Well that one is easy. Whether you take as your key variable Real GDP, Real Wage, population in employment all were way ahead of expectations. Whether the late nineties could happen again depends of what you think caused it to happen in the first place, a question which has economists of all ideological types coming up with different answers. Personally I am a little more optimistic that those times could come again. Then again they are not needed to achieve Low Cost results. Low Cost only assumes 2.8% ultimate GDP and 2.0% productivity both well below the rates we were seeing in the late 90s. Which is probably the least understood thing about Low Cost. In historical context its numbers seem to be pretty low hanging fruit. To me anyway, I am still waiting for someone to explain why no year in the future could possibly be as good as 2006. I don&#8217;t need to appeal back to 1999.</p>
<p>Fire away.</p>

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                            <a href="./../index.html" class="post-category-44" title="social security"><div class="color-box"></div>social security</a>                                                                     </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Or perhaps we could call this &#8216;Social Security basics as seen by Bruce&#8217;. In any event.</p>
<p>Some recent e-mail exchanges and comments have led me to conclude that there are certain misconceptions about Social Security finance, misconceptions that both feed on and feed into certain pernicious myths initiated by people who oppose Social Security on principle but want you to believe it is all about the finance.</p>
<p>The first misconception stems from the fact that the Treasury Department taken as a whole doesn&#8217;t need the equivalent of a Savings Account, that is a place to hold large amount of actual dollars in reserve. The reason is simple, when put in the crudest terms it not only has excellent credit which it exercises daily, if it comes to it Treasury owns the printing press. On the other hand it manages a number of programs who do need that equivalent of which the three largest are Social Security Retirement, Social Security Disability, and Medicare. So how do they handle this. Well the mechanism is simple, it just results in some conceptual confusion. More below the fold.<br />The mechanics of Social Security are pretty simple. The Federal Government collects taxes on wages and on high income benefits and then turns around and spends much to most of that right back out the door in the form of disability and retirement checks. If there are surpluses the money is credited to the Social Security Trust Fund which then turns around and invests them in the safest historical investment known, in this case a special type of T-Bill known as a Special Treasury. Like the case of all T-Bill sales the proceeds flow to the Treasury and are available for the government to spend as they like. Nothing wrong there, that is what happens when you buy a bond, they take the money, give you a promise to repay, and then they invest the money is hopefully productive ways. This is not &#8216;raiding&#8217;, this is not &#8216;looting&#8217;, but it is a promise that creates a specific future obligation, and is specifically booked as debt and shows up in the familiar $9 trillion total debt as seen on various debt clocks. Note too that this process can, and as we will see, has reversed. If there is a string of years when Income from taxes lags cost then the flow reverses, the General Fund makes up the difference and retires an equivalent amount of debt.</p>
<p>Which leads to myths one and two: the Great Raids of Johnson and Reagan. The narrative here suggests that Johnson raided Social Security Trust Funds to fund Vietnam and that Reagan raided it again to pay for the Cold War and that as a result the cupboard was left bare. This is just numeric nonsense and betrays both a misunderstanding of the nature of the Trust Fund and of the Special Treasuries they hold plus a total exaggeration of the dollars in question. The latter can be seen in <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/VI_cyoper_history.html#159726">Table VI.A4.—Historical Operations of the Combined OASI and DI Trust Funds,Calendar Years 1957-2007 [Amounts in billions]</a>. For our purposes the key columns are the right hand three under &#8216;Assets&#8217;. Taking the last first, the Trust Fund Ratio is the Trust Fund balance expressed as a ratio of time with 100=1 year. Legally the Trustees are supposed to monitor the Trust Fund ratio and alert Congress any time it falls out of Short Term Actuarial Balance, which is defined as a projected TF Ratio of at least 100 in each of the next 10 years.</p>
<p>Which gives us mythbuster one: any year that Social Security has a TF Ratio close to 100 is a year when nothing is being looted, instead the President, Congress and Trustees are all fulfilling their fiduciary responsibility. If we look at the table we see that Johnson maintained the Trust Funds at ratios between 97 and 110 at the end of each of his full years in office, and delivered a 101 ratio to his successor, in respect to Social Security he was practically the perfect steward. </p>
<p>Now if we look forward in time we see that Nixon allowed the TF ratio to fall below 100 and so out of Actuarial Balance, and that Ford and Carter did nothing about it. Though this made them perhaps poor stewards at one level, it didn&#8217;t make them thieves the direction of cash flow during these years was actually from the General Fund to Social Security (third column from right).</p>
<p>Which leads us to the Reagan Administration. Reagan inherited a lemon, Social Security was coming off a string of six years of cashing in Trust Fund assets with money from the General Fund, although all the bills had been paid and all legal obligations met, the cupboard was in fact bare. The ideologues were howling to just let it die, they hated Social Security from the beginning and were just waiting for their day to come. It came and Reagan let them down, instead he instituted a medium term fix.</p>
<p>Which puts the lie to myth 2: the Reagan raid. First if we look at the Trust Fund year by year (third column) we see that one, the dollar figures in any given year are not particularly big, with half of the total increase coming in the last year of his term. Second the Trust Fund ratio although improving was only up to 41. But there was no raid, instead there was a simple accumulation of investments to get the fund back on track to a TF ratio of 100. Whatever else his faults, Reagan is totally blameless over Social Security. He did his job.</p>
<p>As did Bush I. He didn&#8217;t do anything dramatic but he did deliver a Trust Fund with a ratio of 97 and clearly on track for Actuarial Balance.</p>
<p>Which gives rise to myth 3: pre-funding. Any year that the Social Security Trust Funds have a ratio of 100 or less they are not prefunding anything, in fact they are in actuarial imbalance and in effect under water, which was true for every year from 1971 to 1993. There was a real crisis in Social Security in the early eighties but collectively this country fulfilled its responsibilities to Social Security retirees. (Although I will hasten to note that the entire net bill was picked up by workers, capital&#8217;s role was limited to not actually wrecking the system). But there is no hard evidence I know of that the Commission ever thought of their efforts of doing more than returning it to actuarial balance, and a recent interview with the Executive Secretary of the Commission confirmed as much. While they did present a set of numbers that would do the job, they were hardly in a position to predict that series of years in the late nineties when Social Security was actually set on the path to solvency.</p>
<p>The state of affairs under the Clinton and Bush Administration is in fact somewhat of an anomaly but there it is. Current surpluses and current economic growth are coming in at rates that should allow us to pay all or almost all of benefits going fowards. If and only if we are vigilent enough to keep future governments simply fulfilling their fiduciary duty. And the politics of that will have to wait on another day and another post.</p>

                                <p>I have a horse race to watch so this will be short and in the form of a intellectual challenge.</p>
<p>In any year that Social Security is in surplus, as it is now and is projected to be until 2017, cutting benefits actually increases total federal debt and so worsens the overall financial outlook going forward. The result is to a striking degree counterintuitive but it is in fact true, if you sit down and think about the implications of investing the entire Trust Fund in Special Treasuries. Which same fact makes revenue increases through such things as a cap increase transform into long term debt.</p>
<p>The arithmetic seems beyond the best efforts of Cosi and tends to baffle Obama supporters who think that a cap increase is progressive (it isn&#8217;t) and would somehow help Social Security (it doesn&#8217;t). Not everything in life is intuitive, for example it is simply absurd how much of modern mathematics and engineering depends on the use of the square root of negative one (&#8216;i&#8217;).<br />(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imaginary_unit) and lets not even get started on Schroedinger&#8217;s Cat. Social Security financing is not as baffling as Quantum Mechanics but it does has its quirks, and this is one of them.</p>
<p>Cutting Social Security spending near term creates long term Federal debt. Discuss.</p>

                                <p>The following is a reworked version of a piece originally put up immediately after the release of the 2006 Report in response to what seemed a very worrisome development. After a long series of years of continual improvement in Social Security long term outlook, suddenly progress stalled and actually reversed, the payroll gap went from 1.89% in 2004 to 1.92% in 2005 to 2.02% in 2006. Cause for concern? Absolutely. Cause for action? Well lets do the numbers.</p>
<p>Can we quantify the price of inaction on Social Security? My starting point is this table from EPI <a href="http://www.epi.org/content.cfm/issueguides_socialsecurity_changes">Changes in Trustees Projections Over Time</a>.<br />Note these are not EPI numbers, these are official numbers from the Annual Reports: &#8220;Source: Annual Reports of the Board of Trustees of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance and Disability Insurance Trust Funds, 1996-2004.&#8221; With the help of reader Paul in comments I can now present a series that is filled in and longer.<br />Report Date:::Payroll Gap:::Trust Fund Depletion<br />1996:::2.19%:::2029<br />1997:::2.23%:::2029<br />1998:::2.19%:::2032<br />1999:::2.07%:::2034<br />2000:::1.89%:::2037</p>
<p>My fundamental views about Social Security crystalized in the 1999-2000 period. Anyone looking at this number series and drawing the conclusion &#8216;Man we got to start moving on this crisis, and soon&#8217; is simply innumeric. Maybe something would need to be done down the road but as it stood Trust Fund depletion was retreating at a rate of two years per year, suggesting it might never come. Now the Bush years and a more complicated story.</p>
<p>2001:::1.86%:::2038 (Reader Paul supplied these, and the series after 2004-thanks Paul)<br />2002:::1.87%:::2041<br />2003:::1.92%:::2042<br />2004:::1.89%:::2042</p>
<p>This is where President Bush entered the battle. Clearly progress was being made, Depletion was still being pushed out in date and this even true in 2004 when taken by month, I think there was about a nine month improvement over the course of the year. This progress didn&#8217;t show up as much on the payroll gap side, but properly understood this is all the more cause for Inactivity. Doing Nothing in Bush&#8217;s first term was the effective equivalent of a tax cut averaging 1.89% in each year, and all from the first dollar and not the last, for wage workers the Cost of Inactivity was money left in their pockets. Absent a better deal than what they were being offered they really had no reason to move. As it turns out Bush&#8217;s implied preference, the Posen Plan did not in fact offer that deal, a point that was hammered home by Lee A. Arnold in a clever animation <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tts2uTWt6e8">Econolanguage: Social Security</a> now available on YouTube.</p>
<p>2005:::1.92%:::2041<br />2006:::2.02%:::2040 (this is what percipitated the early version of this post, that was not pleasant news)<br />2007:::1.95%:::2041<br />2008:::1.70%:::2041</p>
<p>Now let the fun begin. My oh my plenty of numeric fun to be added. Below the fold.</p>
<p>Lets take this as if it were a betting game, me betting my current dollar against some lost dollars going forward. Now clearly in any year that shows an absolute improvement in either magnitude of the gap and/or Depletion moving out in time is a winning bet for Nothing. As are a series of years with that same result. For example we could take it by term:<br />1996:::2.19%<br />2000:::1.89%<br />2004:::1.89%<br />2008:::1.7%<br />Winner, winner, chicken dinner!! Each term left four years of taxes not taken in peoples wallets and ended up with a cost per year going forward that was equal or less that the starting point of the term. The people who insist that &#8216;There is no time to wait&#8217; &#8216;Sooner is better than latter&#8217; and &#8216;If we delay, if will only cost more in the end&#8217; in fact have no numeric evidence to back any of that up. Now certainly it is possible for this trend to reverse, in fact the outlook got considerably bleaker in the mid-ninties, things looked a lot better in 1993 then they did subsequently in 1997, which in the event showed &#8216;crisis&#8217; at its peak. But that is just where the game gets interesting.</p>
<p>Lets say the 2009 Report shows a jump back to 1.95%. Does this make Nothing a losing bet, should we act this year after all? Not necessarily, you have to calculate the Cost of Inactivity for each individual. And moreover decide over what period you want to measure that. Moreover the effects are not necessarily reciprocal, at least over the short run. If the payroll gap actually goes up due to worse than projected current year results, that simply suggests the previous &#8216;fix&#8217; would not in fact have fixed the entire gap, whereas when the gap moves down that current year dollar is real as real. But for the sake of argument lets say you could show that the entire uptick was due to failure to collect that one current year payroll dollar. How many years would it take to have that become a financial negative for any given individual. Well if you look at a situation where you have a level real wage when measured in constant dollars the calculation is pretty simple:</p>
<p>Amount of increase multiplied by years to retirement minus previous year payroll gap. For me in 2005 that worked out to:<br />.03 x 17 = .51 &#8211; 1.89% = -1.38%. That is over my working life Nothing in 2005 still worked out as a tax cut, just a little less than I might have hoped for. How about 2006?:<br />.10 x 16 =1.6% &#8211; 1.92% = -.32% Well kind of nets out as a skinny tax cut but one that works to one degree or another for everyone within 20 years of retirement. And of course the improvement from 2.02% to 1.95% meant Nothing was an absolute win short term and equally medium term. Take any year you like and multiply its payroll gap against the number of years between then and now. That is your cummulative tax cut equivalent for that span. Then use a variation of the equation to calculate how long it would have to be before that became a losing bet. The figure rapidly hits the hundreds of years.</p>
<p>Lets turn the bet on its head and look forward. What level of increase in payroll gap would actually make Nothing a losing bet? The calculation is a little more simple: Current year payroll gap divided by years to retirement or in my case 1.7% divided by 15 or .11%. Could the gap increase by that much? Well maybe, the jump in 2006 was close to that but even then I break even. Now if I was 22 and starting my first job I might take a little different attitude. I didn&#8217;t see any benefit from the dollars not taxed. On the other hand if I was 28 and still struggling to pay off my student loans that roughly 2% a year not taken out of my paycheck probably looks pretty good.</p>
<p>From my perspective any year where the payroll gap is less than the 2.23% of 1997 is a call for Nothing as a plan. Certainly we want to take a hard look if the numbers start trending upwards year over year, but as long as the number is fluctuating around the 2% level there is really nothing to worry about. Once you calculate the Cost of Inactivity against the current utility of that payroll dollar. After all doing nothing in 2008 will leave the median household with about $1000 or close to the amount of the current stimulus check. &#8216;Fixing&#8217; Social Security would then be the fiscal equivalent of taking away the punchbowl right as the party was scheduled to start. Nothing smart about that.</p>

<div></div>
<div>Outcome II shows the standard narrative. A Trust Fund Ratio rising to a peak in 2017  then a more or less rapid falloff to zero as the first the interest is tapped and then the principal is redeemed with the result of total Trust Fund Depletion in 2041.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Outcome III or High Cost shows the same process only accelerated.</div>
<div></div>
<div>But Outcome I or Low Cost shows a much different picture. The Trust Fund ratio peaks at about 450 about 2020 then dips to 390 by around 2040 as a portion of the interest is tapped but after a period of plateau sharply increases through the remainder of the 75 year actuarial window. This is quite literally the picture of a potentially overfunded Social Security system. Is a Low Cost outcome guaranteed? Well no. Is it possible? Certainly the numbers are not at all outlandish and perfectly in line with economic performance over the last fifteen years.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Can we at least talk about the implications of this?</div>
<p>Well I just copied this over from the Bruce Web in response to a comment from Jim A on the previous post. Some explanation of terminology is in order here. First the three curves represent the three different alternatives supplied by the Trustees. The only one generally reported in outcome II or Intermediate Cost, with the other two (High Cost and Low Cost) supposedly representing the outward bounds. In point of fact for the years 1997 to 2004 the deviation from Intermediate Cost was always in the direction of Low Cost and often exceeded its numbers.</p>
<p>Social Security solvency is measured in two ways. One is by payroll gap which is to say the amount that the payroll tax would have to be raised immediately or contrawise at Trust Fund Depletion to fully fund the current schedule of benefits. Per the 2008 Report those figures are 1.7% and 3.54% respectively, numbers that have trended down significantly since the 1997 Report. The second measure is Trust Fund Ratio which is to say Trust Fund assets measured as a function of time with 1 year = 100. Under current law (or perhaps simply practice) Actuarial Balance is defined as having a Trust Fund Ratio of 100 for each of the next 10 years (Short Term Actuarial Balance) or the next 75 years (Long Term Actuarial Balance). In 2003 a new measure was added which would have us evaluate actuarial balance over the &#8216;Infinite Future Horizon&#8217;. This was in my opinion a simple gimmick to allow opponents of Social Security to use really scary numbers rather than focus on the traditional and reasonable 75 year planning window, a window that pretty much covers the interests of most peoples children and grandchildren.</p>
<p>Now in examining the graph we can see Low Cost (outcome I) we see a sharp acceleration of the TF Ratio after 2060 with it exiting the 75 year window at 650. This is dangerously high, that is if we consider the Trust Fund and more significantly the interest it earns as being a real asset. And we should because otherwise we would be arguing for what pgl calls a backdoor employment tax that called on one sub-set of Americans to subsidize General Fund spending. And theoretically there is an argument to be had there but it sure puts &#8216;paid&#8217; to the &#8216;poor people don&#8217;t pay taxes&#8217; narrative the Right is so fond of. But in point of fact flattening the tail down to where the Trust Fund is at its nominal target of 100 is difficult, the only way of doing that is to starve the beast by cutting payroll tax rates and using General Fund dollars now rather than later to pay down the Trust Fund. Because the longer you wait the higher the proportion of Cost has to be born by the General Fund as opposed to FICA to keep interest on interest from bloating the TF. This is incidentally why cutting benefits or increasing revenues by such measures as raising the cap are counterproductive, they simply increase the amount of accrued interest without actually benefitting anyone today.</p>
<p>Of course this whole discussion is moot if we actually get outcome II or Intermediate Cost. Our choice of policy going forward is entirely dependent on whether future outcomes are closer to II or I which in turn requires an examination of the assumptions underlying Intermediate Cost and Low Cost in light of the fact that most of the bias over the last 12 years has been strongly to the upside. Yet all of the policy discussion to date simply clings to Intermediate Cost assumptions and considers the problem to be one of deficit in 2041 when it is not clear that is at all the most likely outcome.</p>
<p>Next post or so we&#8217;ll stick in some actual projected growth numbers. In the meanwhile you can ponder the implications of a $117 trillion Trust Fund in 2085 (Low Cost projection) <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/VI_OASDHI_dollars.html#150920">Table VI.F8.—Operations of the Combined OASI and DI Trust Funds, in Current Dollars, Calendar Years 2008-85 [In billions]</a></p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Well Reader Dan invited me to submit some posts on Social Security and so here I am. Depending on reader interest this is the first in a series trying to get us to a deeper understanding of what Social Security actually is and where it is likely heading. And that may be a much different place than most people currently think.</p>
<p>Social Security finance is a really odd beast, it has a strong up is down quality that tends to baffle people. For example I will be making the case in a later post that cutting Social Security benefits actually harms the long range financial stability of the system. Why this seeming paradox holds requires us to examine some mechanical peculiarities of a PayGo system given the details of the current state of its financing. But before diving into the deep end I want to establish a conceptual framework, that is to show you Social Security through my eyes.</p>
<p>First it all starts, and mostly stops, with the Trustees&#8217; Reports, more formally known as the &#8216;ANNUAL REPORT OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF THE FEDERAL OLD-AGE AND SURVIVORS INSURANCE AND FEDERAL DISABILITY INSURANCE TRUST FUNDS&#8217;. Almost every fact, factoid and date cited in this debate comes directly or indirectly from this Report. (Certainly CBO has a slightly different interpretation but they don&#8217;t really challenge the fundamental assumptions of the Trustees). For the most part in this game all of the players are playing out of the same playbook and more importantly out of a particular subset of that book. More on that point later. The first lesson people need to learn is that &#8216;It is already built into the model&#8217;. This is particularly important in relation to the demographics, because the first response from those hearing that Social Security is not particularly in crisis is: &#8216;What about the Boomer Retirement?&#8217; &#8216;More retirees, less workers, what don&#8217;t you get about that?&#8217; or &#8216;People are living longer!&#8221; Well I know all those things mainly because the demographers working in the Office of the Chief Actuary know them full well and have already accounted for them in their models. Which are published in the Report. Which I read.</p>
<p>Second point. Social Security really and truly is Insurance. Endless efforts have been made to blur this fact, and I expect/hope to see some in comments, but they all fail in the face of the actual operation of the system. Social Security collects premiums from all wage workers up to a determined wage level and disperses benefits to qualified beneficiaries. Which is pretty much the same as what New York Life does, cash flows in one door and out the other. That varying things happen with excess cash in between are not really the concern of the buyer and future beneficiary of the policy, as long as they get the promised benefits when the time comes then all&#8217;s fair. That is there is no functional distinction between drawing a benefit dollar from the existing investment pool as opposed to simply paying it out of current premiums, PayGo does not equate to Ponzi. Banks and Insurance Companies don&#8217;t have current cash reserves equivalent to all of their obligations, instead that money is locked up in what may be long term investments, instead they rely on current cash flow to carry the load. Of course banks are required to hold some cash reserves with the Federal Reserve and Insurance companies themselves carry reinsurance, you can&#8217;t get too close to the edge. And this is where Social Security Insurance departs from New York Life, instead of reinsurance it has Trust Funds.</p>
<p>Which gets us to the third point. Social Security is not the Trust Funds anymore than New York Life is its reinsurance policy. The Trust Funds are simply the numeric measure of how much Social Security has in long term reserves. This amount can over any given year or series of years trend up or down without directly effecting benefit payments. In an up year Income Excluding Interest exceeds Cost and so surpluses flow to the Trust Fund, in a down year Income Excluding Interest lags Cost and the Trust Fund has to be drawn down, but typically not by much, current income is always carrying much of the load and would even if the Trust Fund went to zero.</p>
<p>Last points for today. Trust Fund &#8216;crisis&#8217; is normally set at two possible points. One is crisis at Shortfall, that point where Current Income is projected to fall behind Cost for an extended period. This would require a sustained drawdown on the Trust Fund as more and more interest is diverted to pay current benefits. Whether this really equates to &#8216;crisis&#8217; requires an analysis of the actual dollars in context. That rarely happens, instead people jump right to &#8216;Raise taxes to unendurable levels! or Slash benefits to the bone! We got to act now!!&#8217; Well this hysteria whether real or fake (and much of it is fake) is simply that. Absent an examination of the numbers it is simply as Shakespeare put it &#8216;A tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing&#8217;, In this particular case if you can&#8217;t say it in numbers you really shouldn&#8217;t be saying it at all.</p>
<p>The second &#8216;crisis&#8217; point, and the more traditional one, is crisis at Depletion, that point where the Trust Fund has been drawn down to nothing. Once again the temptation is to jump to &#8220;Oh My God we&#8217;ll have to raise taxes&#8217; or worse &#8216;Its bankrupt!! Dead broke!!! Checks will stop!!&#8217; Well that too is mostly nonsense, by law we need do nothing at Trust Fund Depletion, instead benefits would simply be reduced to whatever level was supported by current income. Whether that adds up to &#8216;crisis&#8217; is once again a matter of comparing the numbers to the actual schedule of benefits while comparing it to benefit levels today. In the event the relevent equation from the 2008 Report is 78% of 160% = 120%. More on that later.</p>
<p>So lessons attempted here?<br />1. Numbers matter and they are to be found in the Reports. Including all the relevant demographic ones.<br />2. Social Security is in fact a Pay as you Go Insurance plan with a certain level of reserves. It is not a Ponzi scheme.<br />3. That reserve is called the Trust Fund, but is not itself the whole of Social Security any more than your bank account is the whole of your finances.<br />4. No one likes to draw down their reserves as we would at Shortfall, but you have to put that in context of your entire financial position. Which means looking at the numbers, see point 1<br />5. You plan for your retirement and ideally meet 100% or more of your goal. Hitting 78% may or may not be some sort of crisis, it might just mean buying a smaller boat. We need to examine Depletion in the context of both absolute level of benefit cuts and probability that the current projection will come to be.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be glad to answer questions and meet challenges in comments. In future posts I will be explaining some of the odd terminology used: Low Cost alternative, Trust Fund Ratio, Covered Worker Ratio etc. For those who just can&#8217;t stand to wait you might want to browse the Nov. 2004 archives of the Bruce Web (bruceweb.blogspot.com).</p>

                                <p>Bruce Webb looks at the Trustee&#8217;s Report&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>One of my very first posts at my Social Security website was <a href="http://bruceweb.blogspot.com/2004/11/what-is-low-cost-alternative-what-does.html">What is the Low Cost Alternative</a> which I put up on November 20th, 2004. In it I made the observation that since 1997 Low Cost, purportedly the upper end of a possible range of economic outcomes, in fact always gave the same result: fully funded Social Security through the 75 year actuarial window with a steady reserve. It consistently returned what I call Baby Bear results, the porridge never being too hot or too cold. I discussed the implications of this in my 2006 Post <a href="http://bruceweb.blogspot.com/2006/01/goldilocks-and-three-social-security.html">Goldilocks and the Three Social Security Bears.</a> Well this held up excellently through the 2005, 2006, and 2007 Reports each of which gave the same basic Baby Bear outcome. Which made 2008 kind of a shock. For the first time the Trustees present a Low Cost model that would officially have Social Security over funded after mid century. Low Cost is outcome I in the following figure <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/II_project.html#112699l">Figure II.D6.—Long-Range OASDI Trust Fund Ratios Under Alternative Assumptions [Assets as a percentage of annual cost]</a> A constantly rising Trust Fund is a long range menace to Social Security, there is a point when having too much in reserve becomes a bad thing, something I expand on some in <a href="http://bruceweb.blogspot.com/2006/01/interest-on-interest-threat.html">Interest on Interest: a Threat</a>. There is only one way to flatten the tail after 2041 to get Social Security back to long term Baby Bear status. And that is some combination of cutting revenues or increasing future benefits. Which is to say exactly 180 degrees reversed from pretty much universal policy positions. To say the least, not at all the kind of crisis people are envisioning.</p>
<p>The policy implications are quite interesting. While of course Low Cost outcomes are not guaranteed, outcomes better than the standard Intermediate Cost model are more likely than not. People who insist that sooner is better than later may well have a point. If you delay those revenue cuts through reduction in FICA or diversion of interest into other asset classes for too long things spiral out of hand.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>With all the discussion about our plight money wise I thought it would be interesting to see just how distorted our view can become depending on what factor we choose as a comparison. Also, I find <a href="http://www.measuringworth.com/uscompare/">this site fun</a>.</p>
<p>So, just how do we compare today to the fondly remembered yesterday? I am very grateful to you for asking. Let&#8217;s see, we need a base. Let us use Social Security (OASDI to be complete) as a base dollar source. There have been suggestions that we need to raise the wage cap. OK, maybe, but what should it be? Using this OK, but what should it be?  Using <a href="http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxfacts/Content/PDF/ssrate_historical.pdf">this pdf chart</a> I picked 3 different years as starting points.  1937, because  “In the Beginning” there was poverty.  1966, because the beginning went so well, we added more.  And 1983 because we became enlightened .</p>
<p>Using the Measuring Worth site I produced this chart:<br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_ea3-LcbrX8A/R_FHHV_0IxI/AAAAAAAAAHI/CEIsmKH2Vik/s1600-h/Social+Security+Wage+Base+chart.JPG"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_ea3-LcbrX8A/R_FHHV_0IxI/AAAAAAAAAHI/CEIsmKH2Vik/s400/Social+Security+Wage+Base+chart.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a><br />The 6 factors are explained at the Measuring Worth site. My short hand is: C Bundled = Consumer Bundle, Unskilled = Unskilled Wage. The N in NGDP stands for nominal.</p>
<p>So, what number do we pick? The one that shows the current cap is set way to high, so we obviously are covering too much in OASDI as compared to the past. Or the one that shows the current cap is too low, so we obviously are not covering as much in OASDI as in the past.</p>
<p>I vote for the one which shows that the $94,200 cap is about the proper income to be earned by the Unskilled Labor force allowing such a person to have maintained their standard of living based on the Consumer Bundle. Yet even at that, their share of GDP would be historically rather low.</p>
<p>Anyone recall me <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/04/this-is-continuation-of-looking-at.html">presenting an argument</a> that we have pushed the cost of the American Dream up to the point that one has to be in the top 10% of income earners to have it? It also takes 2 people working to do it.</p>
<p>In fact how uncanny that the <a href="http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/histinc/f07ar.html">median household income</a> in which the wife is not working, for 1967 (couldn&#8217;t find a number for 1937) converts to an Unskilled Labor income of $48,353 and the Consumer Bundle is $51,019.</p>
<p>Maybe we shouldn&#8217;t feel to bad. Based on Measuring Worth&#8217;s President George Washington example, the current President George is getting screwed by about $100K. But, this does not include the benefits received by the present George. Guess we are getting the short end compared to being president.</p>
<p>Saving the rustbelt goes beyond a geographic area. Saving the rustbelt is referring to a demographic group.</p>

                                <p>On January 10 Moody&#8217;s, in concert with the other main bond rating firm, Standard and Poor&#8217;s, gave the United States its top AAA credit rating. The terrorist blackmail threat came in the form of a demand by Moody&#8217;s that the U.S. government &#8220;reform&#8221; Social Security and Medicare: &#8220;In the very long term, the rating could come under pressure if reform of Medicare and Social Security is not carried out as these two programs are the largest threats to the long-term financial health of the United States and to the government&#8217;s Aaa rating.&#8221;</p>
<p>Steven Hess, Moody&#8217;s top analyst for the US economy spelled it out even more explicitly to the London Financial Times: &#8220;If no policy changes are made, in 10 years from now we would have to look very seriously at whether the US is still a triple-A creditThe US rating is the anchor of the world&#8217;s financial system. If you have a downgrade, you have a problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>There seems to be more than a difference of opinion a la David Walker as well.  My question is why?  How do they interpret the problem as financial?</p>
