                                <p>by<strong> Dale Coberly</strong><br /><strong><br /></strong><br /><strong>Social Security</strong><br /><strong><br /></strong><br /><strong>The Fundamental Truth</strong><br /><strong><br /></strong><br />If you don’t understand this, you don’t understand Social Security. If you do understand it, all the rest is minor technical detail&#8230; or utter nonsense.</p>
<p>Social Security is not welfare. Social Security is not an investment plan. Social Security is insurance&#8230; to avoid welfare if your investment plan doesn’t work out as well as you hope.</p>
<p>Because of the complexity of the modern economy Social Security is insurance that is needed more often than not. It does what the family used to do under the guidance of “Honor your father and your mother.”<br />But even there you have to understand that while “you” helped out your parents in their old age, they “paid for” that help, first by paying for their own parents in their turn; and second, by paying for you when you were very young; and third, by building the “infrastructure” that made it easier for you when it came your turn to work for a living.</p>
<p>There is nothing about Social Security that guarantees you will always have higher benefits than your parents, or pay lower “taxes.” The world changes. There are fat years and lean years.</p>
<p>What Social Security does do is guarantee that even in the lean years you can “save enough” for your own old age, by the miracle of pay as you go&#8230; paying for your parents old age&#8230; which they paid for in their turn.<br />I hope you can understand the dual nature of “paying for.” It is actually the normal way money works. <br />When you put money in any investment, or Social Security, your money “pays for” whatever the bank or the company you invested in uses it for in that day. What you get is a claim on “your money” when you ask for it back. Some claims are more secure than others.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>You have NO guarantee you will get your money back from a stock. You have some guarantee&#8230; because of government insurance&#8230; that you will get it back from a bank. With Social Security you get the best guarantee so far devised by man&#8230;you get your money back unless you let your elected representatives steal it from you. And because it&#8217;s pay as you go, you get back &#8220;real dollars.&#8221; Inflation is taken care of automatically, and if the economy grows, you get an effective compound interest equal to that growth.<br />Even if the economy declined 50% and we had to live on half of what we earn today, we would still need to set aside about 10% of that in order to have enough to live on when we were too old to work. If you don’t think you can do that, you need to think harder. Half the people in America are already doing it&#8230; living on half what you make and saving for their retirement thanks to Social Security.</p>
<p>In those very bad times that no one is currently predicting, SS would handle it the way societies have handled bad times since the beginning of human societies. We’d all have a little less, and we’d share that with the old folks. </p>
<p>The Trustees currently predict a “worse” economy in which the Social Security benefits would need to be reduced about 25%. It turns out this level of benefits would still be higher on a monthly basis, in “real value,” than today&#8217;s. It also turns out that the reason for the reduction is that future generations are expected to live longer than past generations, so you get that “reduced benefit” for many more months&#8230; adding up to the same thing in the end.</p>
<p>But it also turns out that those future generations, even under the “bad” predictions, will be earning more than twice what we are&#8230; in real dollars. That means they could raise their own payroll tax by two or four percent, keep the present benefit rate&#8230; also about twice the value of today’s in real dollars&#8230; AND have more than twice as much money after paying the tax as they have today.</p>
<p>But that’s the good news. If the economy really did go bad you would still need to save for your retirement. And Social Security is the ONLY way you can do that safe from inflation&#8230; and the bad economy.<br />Instead, what we have today is as if we were on an ocean liner and every time the wind blows from the north, the captain and crew start running around the poop deck screaming, “If this keeps up the ocean will freeze over. We’ve got to lighten ship. Start throwing the passengers overboard. Now.</p>
<p>The Big Liars&#8230; and that seems to include everyone in Washington&#8230; are telling us that we have to cut off our heads today in order to save the cost of dinner twenty years from now.<br />You need to be smarter than that.</p>

                                <p>Social Security arithmetic isn&#8217;t hard. Tedious perhaps and with counter-intuitive results but once certain terminological obstacles are swept away not requiring advanced math skills. But oy that terminology! This post proposes to start demolishing those conceptual barriers.</p>
<p>Social Security is considered &#8216;solvent&#8217; when its &#8216;Trust Fund&#8217; is in &#8216;actuarial balance&#8217;. The Social Security Trust Fund was created pursuant to the Social Security Amendments of 1939 to hold any excess of dedicated Social Security revenue over cost and serves primarily as a reserve fund. Those excess revenues are held in the form of interest earning Special Treasuries with that interest being included as revenue. When the accumulated principal including retained interest equals 100% of projected NEXT YEAR cost the Trust Fund is considered to be in &#8216;actuarial balance&#8217;. Now since Social Security income and cost project to change each year &#8216;actuarial balance&#8217; cannot effectively be measured in nominal dollar terms because a year end 2012 balance equal to 100% of 2013 projected cost will generally be something less than 100% of 2014 cost. And this quite aside from any fluctuations in the economy, that is all things being equal a steady-state Social Security system requires a steadily increasing Trust Fund principal balance to be judged in &#8216;actuarial balance&#8217;.</p>
<p>Meaning &#8216;fixing&#8217; Social Security, making it &#8216;solvent&#8217;, means something more than restoring actuarial balance for the current year, instead it requires having the system project to maintain &#8216;actuarial balance&#8217; over time. Historically the Trustees of Social Security established two different measures of solvency: &#8216;short term actuarial balance&#8217; and &#8216;long term actuarial balance&#8217;. &#8216;Short term&#8217; here means the same 10 year budget window used by the rest of government, if year end principal balance in the SS Trust Funds projects to be 100% or greater (in SS jargon a &#8216;trust fund ratio of 100 or more&#8217;) in EACH of the next 10 years Social Security &#8216;meets the test for short term actuarial balance&#8217;. Similarly if the TF ratio projects to be 100 or more in EACH of the next 75 years Social Security meets the test for &#8216;long term actuarial balance&#8217;. In the last couple decades &#8216;short term&#8217; and &#8216;long term&#8217; actuarial balance have been supplemented by two new ways of considering solvency. In 2002 we saw the introduction of  &#8216;Infinite Future Horizon&#8217;, that is in principle extending solvency to Heat Death of the Sun. More reasonably for long-term planning purposes is something called &#8216;sustainable solvency&#8217; which takes into account the predictable increase in structural cost year over year and argues that &#8216;long term actuarial balance&#8217; should include not just years 1-75, but also the trend for year 76 and after. That is we shouldn&#8217;t just fix Social Security for 2012, we should take steps to make sure it won&#8217;t fail the test for &#8216;long term actuarial balance&#8217; come 2013.</p>
<p>Okay having (I hope) adequately defined &#8216;solvency&#8217;, &#8216;actuarial balance&#8217;, &#8216;trust fund ratio&#8217;, &#8216;Infinite Future Horizon&#8217; and &#8216;sustainable solvency&#8217; we can develop some implications below the fold.<br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>What would &#8216;sustainable solvency&#8217; look like? Now given that year 76 total cost will be predictably more than year 75 year total cost even if the current year 75 year model is perfect, it follows that maintaining a trust fund ratio of EXACTLY 100 requires a small increase in Trust Fund balance EACH year. Which is where things start getting odd.</p>
<p>Okay assume we have a Trust Fund with a principal balance equal to 100% of next year&#8217;s cost where that principal is held in interest earning Special Treasuries whose interest is in turn counted as income. Further assume that all non-interest SS income for the upcoming year projects to be equal to projected cost. What is the result for the Trust Fund? Well one thing to recognize is that maturing Special Treasuries are not in themselves counted as &#8216;income&#8217;. If the dollars represented by those Treasuries are not needed for current year cost they are simply retained and rolled over into new issues. The second is that interest on the current portfolio IS counted as &#8216;income&#8217; but if not needed to pay current year cost is itself rolled over into new Special Treasuries. That is under the assumptions of our current scenario, where NON-interest income equals current cost, the result will be retention of 100% of principal augmented by interest converted to new principal in the form of new issues along side those rolled over.</p>
<p>Simple enough but with some odd results. Under our scenario maturing principal is not redeemed for cash, it is simply exchanged for new Special Treasuries with new (typically) 10 year maturities. And a few seconds of thought shows that in a steady state system of  &#8216;sustainable solvency&#8217; they might NEVER need to be redeemed for cash. In fact, and this is a key point, they would all need to be retained and augmented with new principal sufficient to maintain that Trust Fund ratio of 100. Meaning that those Treasuries, though real interest earning obligations of the U.S. government, never actually get paid off.</p>
<p>This tends to throw supporters of Social Security for a loop. Because they often believe that the Trust Funds were established in 1983 as a method of pre-funding Boomer retirement and were ALWAYS expected to be paid down to zero and so be temporary: &#8220;Reagan borrowed the money to pay for tax cuts, they NEED to pay it back&#8221;. Well actually under ideal circumstances they don&#8217;t need to pay it back. They only need to honor the obligation by continuing to pay and/or credit interest on the accumulated principal with the latter being retained to maintain the crucial function of &#8216;sustainable solvency&#8217; as measured by &#8216;trust fund ratio&#8217;.</p>
<p>And this is where things get hairy, because note I said in reference to interest that it needs to be paid and/or credited. And by &#8216;credited&#8217; I mean retained in the form of new Special Treasuries sufficient to maintain a trust fund ratio of 100. Which means that portion of interest retained to maintain an overall condition of &#8216;sustainable solvency&#8217; is never paid off by cash transfers either. In terms understandable to Paulite TeaTards those Special Treasuries used to roll over existing principal and to &#8216;finance&#8217; retained interest are just &#8216;fiat money&#8217;. Or in terms understandable by the rest of us &#8216;Interest Earning Obligations backed by Full Faith and Credit of the U.S.&#8217;</p>
<p>If this sounds crazy it is probably because Social Security is not now in &#8216;sustainable solvency&#8217;. Although on a combined basis the OASDI Trust Funds do meet the test for &#8216;short term actuarial balance&#8217; they DO NOT meet the &#8216;long term&#8217; test and still less either the test for &#8216;sustainable solvency&#8217; (i.e. year 76 and some years after) or &#8216;infinite future&#8217; (i.e. year 76 and EVERY year for centuries to come). Under current projections Trust Fund principal will need to be redeemed for cash starting in the 2020s and project to be totally redeemed by the mid 2030s. But given a sensible worker friendly fix that starts by taking the numbers and methodology of the Social Security Reports seriously they don&#8217;t need to be.</p>
<p>(After all it is eminently sensible to maintain a prudent reserve and reasonable enough to consider a TF ratio of 100 to be a simple minimum. On the other hand there is a limit beyond which too much reserve actually becomes dangerous (topic for another post). And when I started blogging on this in 2004 it appeared we were on that dangerous &#8216;over-funded&#8217; path. But the 2007 recession took care of THAT problem with the result that TF ratios are already dropping from their peak even as they still remain right around 350 (three and a half years of reserve). Of course there is no real world problem with those ratios dropping, that is after all what the extra reserve is for, to be tapped as needed. On the other hand simple prudence mandates putting into place a plan to keep them from dropping to levels which would cause the failure of  &#8216;short term actuarial balance&#8217; and even to put them onto a glide path towards &#8216;long term actuarial balance&#8217; and heck even &#8216;sustainable solvency&#8217;. Which (cough, cough) the Northwest Plan for a Real Social Security Fix does even as it maintains 100% of the current law scheduled benefit. Even as it largely avoids substantial paydown of Trust Fund principal in nominal terms, instead putting Social Security on the path to permanent TF ratios in the 130 range.)</p>
<p>What then would &#8216;sustainable solvency&#8217; look like from the perspective of the General Fund? Well for one thing the Social Security Trust Fund balance, while still being a very real claim on the future, with a minimum amount of due diligence never actually become itself &#8216;due&#8217;. Not in cash anyway. And interestingly neither will that portion of accrued interest needed to maintain the targeted TF ratio whether that be 100 or 130 or whatever. On the flip side not all interest can simply be credited to the Trust Fund as new Special Treasuries without potentially boosting the TF ratio to a point where worker&#8217;s rebel as a prudent &#8216;reserve&#8217; transmutes into an interest free loan to the General Fund. I mean who is the &#8216;moocher&#8217; or &#8216;looter&#8217; in that scenario?</p>
<p>I leave as an exercise for the reader to poke at the numbers and see what part of Trust Fund interest simply gets retained as Special Treasuries (and so not financed from the real economy) to maintain minimum TF ratios as opposed to that portion of that interest that needs to be paid out in benefits to keep that TF ratio below acceptable sustainable maximums, which for the sake of argument we could put at 166. Whatever is the result of the offset due to retained interest is in effect the discount on the cash interest rate and under standard Intermediate Cost assumptions is something like 40% off the nominal rate. But it doesn&#8217;t discount to zero, the Trust Fund never becomes (or shouldn&#8217;t anyway) a purely free lunch. Pretty cheap for the social utililty and equity Social Security delivers but not cost free. As Chief Actuary of SS Steve Goss explained in a crucially important article in the 70th anniversary edition of the Social Security Bulletin: <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/ssb/v70n3/v70n3p111.html">The Future Financial Status of the Social Security Program </a> (bolding mine)<br />
<blockquote>However, the occurrence of a negative cash flow, when tax revenue alone is insufficient to pay full scheduled benefits, does not necessarily mean that the trust funds are moving toward exhaustion. In fact, in a perfectly pay-as-you-go (<abbr title="pay go">PAYGO</abbr>) financing approach, with the assets in the trust fund maintained consistently at the level of a &#8220;contingency reserve&#8221; targeted at one year&#8217;s cost for the program, the program might well be in a position of having negative cash flow on a permanent basis. This would occur when the interest rate on the trust fund assets is greater than the rate of growth in program cost. In this case, interest on the trust fund assets would be more than enough to grow the assets as fast as program cost, leaving some of the interest available to augment current tax revenue to meet current cost. Under the trustees&#8217; current intermediate assumptions, the long-term average real interest rate is assumed at 2.9 percent, and real growth of <abbr>OASDI</abbr> program cost (growth in excess of price inflation) is projected to average about 1.6 percent from 2030 to 2080. Thus, if program modifications are made to maintain a consistent level of trust fund assets in the future, interest on those assets would generally augment current tax income in the payment of scheduled benefits.</p></blockquote>
<p>That is within stated limits neither the fact nor the timing of Social Security going cash flow negative means a damn thing in the bigger picture. Something some commenters have a hard time grasping.</p>

                                <div>Laurence Kotlikoff has a post in <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-07-11/social-security-hole-overwhelms-taxes-cuts.html" target="_blank">Bloomberg opinion section</a> on the current status of the Social Security.  This is lifted from Dale Coberly&#8217;s note back to him:</div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><p>Your analysis that SS is desperately broke ignores the fact that the projected shortfall can be made up by raising the payroll tax one half of one tenth of one percent per year, while incomes are projected to go up over one full percent per year.</p>
<p>This would result ultimately in an increase in the payroll tax of about 4% of income (which you misleadingly call a 33% increase in the tax, which it is, but which is likely to mislead the average reader).  A 4% increase in the tax really amounts to a 4% increase in the savings protected by Social Security, which is properly understood as insurance against the potential failure of other modes of saving for retirement.  The 4% increase is a very fair price to pay for the longer life expectancy that the workers paying the tax will enjoy.</p>
<p>They really won&#8217;t want to work any longer, and since they are paying for their own benefits, there is no reason they should have to.  Further, while the tax increase does represent a higher percent of their income going to their own longer retirement, the projected increases in their wages would leave them at least twice as well off &#8220;after the tax&#8221; (that is, in terms of money left in their pockets each month after putting away the extra for their longer retirement) as they are today.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if you are able to understand all this, or if you just prefer to ignore it.  But I do what I can.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>by Dale Coberly</p>
<p> A kind person suggested I be ready to be crucified about calling for increasing a &#8220;regressive tax&#8221; if I call for raising the payroll tax  forty cents per week.</p>
<p>The people who say Social Security is a regressive tax are suffering from brain damage caused by parrot fever.  Having been taught to say &#8220;regressive tax, regressive tax&#8221; when they  were young and impressionable, they can&#8217;t stop themselves. They don&#8217;t  mean anything by it, but they think they do.</p>
<p>They don&#8217;t know what a regressive tax is.  They don&#8217;t know what a tax is.  They don&#8217;t know what regressive means.  And above all they have no sense of proportion.</p>
<p>The &#8220;tax&#8221; increase needed by Social Security is forty cents per week.  This is the cost to the average worker of saving a program  that will give them about twenty thousand dollars a year when they retire.  But the &#8220;liberals&#8221; call that forty cents a &#8220;regressive tax,  regressive tax&#8221; and would see the poor loose that twenty thousand  dollars in order to save forty cents worth of &#8220;regressive tax, regressive tax.&#8221;</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>A regressive tax is a tax that falls more heavily on the poor than on the rich as a percent of income.  The usual case is a &#8220;sales tax&#8221; as compared to a graduated &#8220;income tax.&#8221;  As long as either tax is used to pay for the same government expenses, the sales tax is more  &#8220;regressive&#8221; than the graduated income tax because the poor spend a larger percentage of their income than the rich on items covered by the usual sales tax schemes.</p>
<p>But Social Security does not pay for government expenses.  It pays for the retirement of the person paying the tax.  So it is not a tax in the usual sense in which a tax is a payment to the government for government expenses.</p>
<p>And Social Security is designed so that people who end up poor after a lifetime of work get a much higher return on their &#8220;investment&#8221; than those who end up &#8220;well off.&#8221;  So the poor are paying LESS for what they get than the rich. The poor are getting MORE for what they  pay than the rich.  This is called &#8220;progressive.&#8221;  It is the opposite of &#8220;regressive.&#8221;</p>
<p>But you will never convince someone who got his PhD by saying &#8220;regressive tax, regressive tax.&#8221;  And that, my children, is why you won&#8217;t get Social Security when you get old.  Because the professional liberals will save you from that bad old regressive tax, regressive tax.</p>

<p><strong>Fixable Error</strong><br /><strong>New Insight</strong><br /><strong>and Social Security</strong><br />(amended version)<br />When errors are honest, and people keep talking in good faith, they are usually fixable. One of the errors I will talk about here is mine. The new insight is entirely the result of the good faith and honesty of Eric Laursen who has written a book about Social Security called The People&#8217;s Pension.</p>
<p>In the transcript ( <u><a href="http://retirementrevised.com/money/qa-eric-laursen-on-the-peoples-pension">http://retirementrevised.com/money/qa-eric-laursen-on-the-peoples-pension</a></u> ) of Mark Miller&#8217;s interview with Laursen about his book appears this statement regarding possible fixes for Social Security:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;A fallback would be to raise payroll taxes for everyone, but so slowly that it would have little impact – say, by 0.01 percent a year&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I knew this was wrong, and I thought I knew why: Lots of people get confused between 0.01 which is one percent of one, and 0.01 percent, which is one ten thousandth of whatever you are talking about. A tax increase of 0.01% on a 40,000 dollar per year income would be 4 dollars a year. This would not help Social Security. But it is marvelous that a tax increase of 0.05%, which is one half of one tenth of one percent, per year would solve the Social Security problem entirely. This is five times 0.01%, or about 20 dollars per year, per year, or about 40 cents per week, per year.</p>
<p>Laursen told me he had gotten the number from Monique Morrissey ( <u><a href="http://www.epi.org/page/-/old/briefingpapers/BriefingPaper287.pdf">http://www.epi.org/page/-/old/briefingpapers/BriefingPaper287.pdf</a></u> ).</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8221; These projected longevity gains, if they materialize, could also be offset by a 0.01 percentage-point increase in the payroll tax per year from 2025 to 2084 (from 6.2% to 6.8% overall). Over this 60-year period, average wages are projected to nearly double in inflation-adjusted terms. &#8220;</p></blockquote>
<p>So I read Morrissey&#8217;s paper to see where she had gotten the number. Morrissey is primarily arguing against increasing the retirement age, and she wishes to show that increases in life expectancy are not the drivers of the projected shortfall in SS:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8221; However, gains in life expectancy represent only a small part of the fiscal challenge facing Social Security. The increase in the normal retirement age from 65 to 67, currently underway, already offsets gains in life expectancy for workers born before 1960, and longevity gains for younger generations account for only a fifth of the projected Social Security shortfall. &#8220;</p></blockquote>
<p>So the difficulty is not in the arithmetic, but in the fact that she is talking about only ONE cause of the projected shortfall, which by her reckoning is only one fifth of the problem.<br />That&#8217;s fine, but it can lead to confusion. As in fact it did for Laursen and me.</p>
<p>Morrissey&#8217;s essay is mostly written in opposition to raising the retirement age, and it is WELL WORTH READING.</p>
<p>She provided me with a new insight.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>That said, I disagree with her conclusion.</p>
<p>Her conclusion is that raising the cap on income subject to the payroll tax, scrapping it entirely, is the answer to the Social Security projected shortfall. I think that such a solution has no chance whatsoever in this political climate. And I do not think it would be a reasonable solution for a program that is successful exactly because it is NOT WELFARE. Raising the cap would turn SS into welfare by “taxing the rich” for benefits they will not get.</p>
<p>Moreover the cost of fixing SS by raising the payroll tax under the current cap is so tiny&#8230; forty cents per week&#8230; that no one would even feel it. And it would preserve the fundamental nature of Social Security: the “tax” is paid for by the workers who will get the benefits.</p>
<p>Morrissey appears to think of Social Security as “social welfare”, in which the whole society&#8230; and that means the rich&#8230; pay for the needs of the needy.</p>
<p>But American workers don’t see themselves as needy; they don’t want welfare; and they very much like the idea that they “paid for it themselves.”</p>
<p>And the American “rich” are not going to pay for the workers retirement. They see themselves as having a hard enough time paying for welfare for the truly needy without being asked to foot the bill for every single worker’s expected twenty years in retirement.</p>
<p>But Morrissey provided an insight which I had missed.</p>
<p>I have been saying that the need for the payroll tax increase is because future workers are going to be living longer in retirement than past workers.</p>
<p>Morrissey shows that in some important ways this is not exactly true. Future workers will not, in general, live significantly longer than current retirees. The increases in longevity will be mostly among the rich.</p>
<p>She shows the previous increases in longevity have largely been paid for by other factors, including increases in population and increases in incomes. I’ll leave you to read her essay to learn about this. Essentially I will argue that those other factors have masked the &#8220;true&#8221; cost of Social Security, and it would be serious error to to try to make up for changes in them by changing the fundamental nature of Social Security from &#8220;the workers pay for it themselves,&#8221; to &#8220;social insurance,&#8221; or what we call &#8220;welfare.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is not that easy to correct demographic trends, or economic trends, or inequities in the earnings of the poor vs the rich. These are problems that should be addressed, but they should be addressed outside of Social Security. Social Security is insurance, designed to help people through bad times. It is a mistake to shoulder Social Security with the burden of correcting all the ills of society that may fall upon the poor.</p>
<p>But that brings me to my error. And why I am not going to “fix” it.</p>
<p>I came into the Social Security debate from a background that has nothing to do with politics or “social welfare.” This gives me a different “frame.” [note this is not Lakoff’s political framing, but more like framing a problem in physics so that it can be solved. Peter Peterson has framed the problem so it cannot be solved at all. Peterson has dedicated a billion dollars to making his framing the conventional wisdom, and I think Morrissey has accepted it without thinking too much about it.<br />Consider a universe in which, for the moment, there is no population growth, no increases in longevity, no economic growth, no inflation, no interest, no changes in longevity. </p>
<p>But in this universe people still work when they are adults and strong, and want to be able to retire at some point before they die. They will need to &#8220;save&#8221; for that retirement some of what they produce while they are working.</p>
<p>This leads to a Basic Retirement Equation:</p>
<p>years worked, times percent of earnings “saved,” equals years retired, times retirement income (as a percent of prior earnings).</p>
<p>So if you are going to work for forty years and expect to live ten years in retirement at 40% of your prior income, you would need to “save” ten percent of your income:</p>
<p><strong>40 X 10% = 10 X 40%</strong></p>
<p>It does not matter, in this universe, if you save this as gold in a box, or as a non-cash implicit agreement by which working adults pay for the needs of the elderly, or by a formal pay as you go “tax”.</p>
<p>In all cases you are deferring 10% of your present income so that you will have enough to live on when you get old. This can be done by hoarding “gold”, which is dangerous, or by implicit “honor your mother and your father” agreement between generations, or by an explicit government-managed (but not “government paid”) tax and benefit system.</p>
<p>Now imagine another universe in which nothing has changed except that you expect to live 20 years in retirement. The equation now becomes:</p>
<p>&#8220;40 years working, times 20% savings, equals 20 years in retirement, times 40% “replacement benefit.”</p>
<p>This may look like a lot of money to save, or be taxed, but it would be a perfectly reasonable solution to the problem of living for twenty years after you become too old to work, or want to work. The key here is you have to realize the 20% is “your money”. You saved it. And it will be you who spends it.<br />As long as the other members of the society agree that this is a reasonable way to apportion earnings between working years and retirement years, it is no problem. Especially if the workers agree that money not used by those who die earlier than the 20 year expectancy will be used to pay for the needs of those who live longer. This is not welfare. It’s insurance.</p>
<p>Now, in the real world, the fact has been that other factors including income growth and population growth&#8230; at least the population of workers in the Social Security program&#8230; have worked to reduce the needed “savings” or tax rate. [Also, for the past few hundred years or so, &#8220;interest&#8221; or &#8220;capital growth, including appreciation of stocks, has reduced the needed &#8220;savings&#8221; rate. But this has been accompanied by the risks of inflation and market losses, which is what Social Security was invented to provide insurance against.]</p>
<p>But these other factors are OUTSIDE of Social Security. And Social Security does not depend on them to work.</p>
<p>It may be that rising income inequality, reductions in birth rate, or other economic and demographic factors will affect the tax rate needed to provide a reasonable retirement “rate.” But the BASIC fact is that it is the ratio between working years and retirement years that determines “the cost of retirement.”</p>
<p>Social Security is designed explicitly to take care of the ups and downs in the economy, including demographics. If rates have to go up, or if benefits have to come down in response to hard times, so be it. That is the history of the human race: There are fat years and lean years.</p>
<p>Some people argue, in bad faith I think, that ups and downs in Social Security &#8220;return on investment&#8221; are a kind of generational crime. They prefer you don&#8217;t look at the ups and downs in return on investment in the private markets. Even that box of gold under the bed, or the ability of the working adults in a family to care for their own elderly relatives, or the ability of investors to realize a rate of return they need to fund their own retirement&#8230; will be subject to factors like demographics, wars, the state of the economy, inflation, market losses, and will result in greater or lower &#8220;returns on investment&#8221; from one generation to the next. But the enemies of Social Security want you to think that if SS does not make exactly the same return to each generation, some generation is being &#8220;robbed.&#8221;</p>
<p>As it happens we are looking at&#8230; according to the Trustees&#8230; a period of time where some of the factors that have held down the cost of Social Security in the past will not be as much of a help in the future as they have been in the past. These &#8220;anti-factors&#8221; include rising inequality of income, a falling birth rate, lower productivity gains.. a combination of factors that will require either a benefit cut of about 20% or a tax raise of about 4%, which can be phased in over about eighty years, at one half of one tenth of one percent at a time.</p>
<p>Cutting a benefit that is already at survival level by 20% is insane. Raising a tax 4% over about 80 years wouldn’t even be felt. [The 4% tax increase would occur while incomes are increasing more than 100%, so that, in round numbers, after eighty years your after tax income will have increased 96% instead of 100%&#8230; you are not going to notice the difference&#8230; unless of course you threw away your Social Security in order to &#8220;save&#8221; that 4%.]</p>
<p>But these factors are external to the basic mathematics of retirement, especially from the perspective of the individual. The basic relation is: {the number of years you work compared to the number of years you expect to be retired} determines {the ratio between tax rate and benefit rate}.  </p>
<p>While it is true that relying on the “whole economy pays for everybody” could in principle produce the same result, on average, through general taxation and a &#8220;government pension.&#8221; This perspective leads to an understanding which is basically wrong, and which the politics of this country, and the psychology of both the workers and the “rich” is not ready to accept. We prefer an explicit relation between the money we &#8220;save&#8221; as individuals and the benefits we get as individuals. We prudently modify this principle enough to allow for an insurance factor whereby those who cannot save enough over a lifetime of work to pay for a decent retirement are helped out by the &#8220;excess&#8221; of those who were able to save &#8220;more than enough&#8221; in the protected savings plan we know as Social Security. But the principle is still essentially &#8220;you pay for what you get.&#8221;</p>
<p>Morrissey may be correct that only one fifth of the projected shortfall is “due to” rising life expectancies, but that is because those other factors that have previously reduced the cost due to rising life expectancies may no longer be able to do so.   </p>
<p>We cannot easily change those factors, but going from there to propose a “solution” that destroys the fundamental nature of Social Security by changing it from “worker pays” to “the rich pay,” will in the first place not be accepted by those rich who have the political power in this country, and in the second place would deprive the workers of both the satisfaction and the political power of being able to say “I paid for it myself.”</p>
<p>If there were no alternative&#8230; if the extra revenue needed for a decent retirement were beyond the reach of the workers, then a welfare solution might be necessary&#8230; though this would be a bad way to arrange an economy over the long run. But since the cost of “fixing” Social Security, whatever the reason for the shortfall, amounts to only forty cents per week per year, it is far, far better that the workers pay for it themselves than to have them go to Mr. Richfellow and say, “Please, Sir, can I have some more?”</p>
<p>Meanwhile I will keep saying the need for the “tax” increase is because we are going to be living longer. I believe this is the more fundamental truth. And it’s certainly a lot easier to explain to people than all the complications Morrissey addresses in her essay. And it leads to the correct solution: the workers need to pay a little more for their own retirement because they will be living longer. </p>
<p>When you go to the store you do not go up to a well dressed stranger and say, “Sir, it looks like you have more money than I have. Please pay for my groceries.”</p>
<p>Social Security is you paying now while you have the money for the groceries you will need later when you may not have the money. That is a lot better for the country, and a lot safer for the workers, than teaching them to expect &#8220;the rich&#8221; to pay for the predictable costs of a large, and normal, part of their lives.</p>

<p><strong>Social Security Hurt by Republican Jobs Obstructionism</strong></p>
<p>The Center for Economic and Policy Research (CEPR) published its <a href="http://www.cepr.net/index.php/data-bytes/social-security-bytes/recession-weak-economy-behind-revision-of-social-securitys-projected-shortfall-to-2033">commentary</a> on Monday&#8217;s release of the <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/oact/tr/2012/index.html">Social Security Trustees Report</a>, which found that the Social Security trust fund would be exhausted in 2033. CEPR rightly blames the recession for the deterioration of Social Security&#8217;s finances. <a href="http://middleclasspoliticaleconomist.blogspot.com/2011/09/increase-in-uninsured-rate-shows-need.html">As I argued last September</a> with regard to falling health care coverage, the new results from the Trustees show the need for a jobs agenda.</p>
<p>In fact, in just four years, the estimated trust fund exhaustion date (intermediate assumption) has gotten eight years closer. It was 2041 in the <a href="https://www.socialsecurity.gov/pressoffice/pr/trustee08-pr.htm">2008 report</a>, 2037 in the <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/oact/tr/2009/index.html">2009 report</a>, 2037 in the <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/oact/tr/2010/index.html">2010 report</a>, and 2036 in the <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/oact/tr/2011/index.html">2011 report</a>. Jared Bernstein <a href="http://jaredbernsteinblog.com/moving-exhaustion/">charts these trends</a> going back to 1985:</p>

<p>The CEPR analysis highlights just how crucial jobs are to Social Security&#8217;s solvency:<br />
<blockquote>As workers have found themselves without jobs, Social Security has received fewer contributions. The 2007 Trustees&#8217; Report projected 169.0 million workers in 2011 earning $6.5 trillion in taxable earnings. Last year, there were only 157.7 million workers earning $5.5 trillion.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, there was a $1 trillion shortfall of income in 2011 alone compared to the pre-recession baseline. If this doesn&#8217;t highlight the need for much greater action on the jobs front, nothing does.<br />   <br />Yet what is the Republican response to this situation? At the federal level, there has been universal opposition to anything that might create more jobs as long as Obama is President. At the state and local level, as Paul Krugman points out, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/23/opinion/krugman-the-amnesia-candidate.html?_r=1">70% of the decline in public sector jobs</a> has come in Texas and in the states where Republicans took control of government in 2010.    </p>
<p>What we see from the Trustees Report is that as jobs and income decline, Social Security is directly harmed. And I&#8217;m starting to have the feeling that for the Republicans, this is a feature, not a bug.  crossposted with <a href="http://www.blogger.com/middleclasspoliticaleconomist.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Middle Class Political Economist</a></p>

<p><tt><strong>SAVING SOCIAL SECURITY SIMPLIFIED</strong></tt><br /><tt><strong></strong><br />The Trustees Report came out again this week.</p>
<p>And all the newspeople told us again that we are doomed.  Doomed.   <br />"Social Security is running out of money!"</p>
<p>Except it isn't.</p>
<p>And all the Professional Defenders of Social Security rushed out to  <br />tell us, "We can save Social Security: just make the rich pay for it!"</p>
<p>Except they won't.</p>
<p>And they really shouldn't.  And we shouldn't want them to.  Most  <br />workers understand that Their Social Security is Their money.  They  <br />paid for it.  They need to know that IT'S NOT WELFARE.</p>
<p>But all the paid experts and politicians, and all the high end  <br />newssources can only think in terms of welfare.  So the Bad Cop says  <br />we got to cut it.  And the Good Cop says we got to make the rich pay  <br />for it.</p>
<p>But actually all we really need to do is just pay for it ourselves...  <br />as we always have.</p>
<p>It wont cost much.  An additional 40 cents per week each year will  <br />pay for the whole "shortfall."</p>
<p>You don't have to take my word for it.  The Congressional Budget  <br />Office says the same thing.  A CBO Study:  <em><strong>Social Security Policy  <br />Options, July 2010</strong></em>,  Option <strong>2</strong> (page 17) says "Increase the Payroll  <br />Tax Rate by 2 Percentage Points Over 20 years... this option would  <br />raise the combined payroll tax rate gradually, by 0.1 percentage  <br />point (0.05 percentage points each for employers and employees) every  <br />year from 2012 to 2031... This option would extend the trust fund  <br />exhaustion date to 2083."</tt><br /><tt></tt><br /><tt></tt><br /><tt><a name="more"></a><br />Please note that while the tax would be increasing at one tenth of  <br />one percent per year... combined... wages would be increasing over  <br />one full percent per year.  So in today's terms the tax for the  <br />employee would increase by 40 cents per week (and another 40 cents  <br />for the employer), while wages are going up eight dollars per week  <br />each year.</p>
<p>CBO Option 3 would Increase the Payroll Tax Rate by 3 Percentage  <br />Points Over 60 years.  This would be a twenty cents per week increase  <br />in the tax each year for the employee and the employer.</p>
<p>With both of these Options it is likely that a similar increase would  <br />need to be enacted at the end of the twenty, or sixty, year period.  <br />This is unlikely to be a problem after people have seen that a  <br />gradual increase is not a "burden."  In fact it is unlikely they will  <br />even notice it.  Nor will the increases continue forever.  The  <br />Trustees Projection is that the need for increases will flatten and  <br />fall to essentially zero after life expectancies stabilize between  <br />2050 and 2070 or so.</p>
<p>Remember it is not a tax going into a government black hole.  It is  <br />You saving your own money, protected by "pay as you go with wage  <br />indexing,"  so that if all else fails you can retire when you need  <br />to.  You get your money back with interest in an annuity that will  <br />last the rest of your life. No matter what.</p>
<p>Now here is the hard part for you.</p>
<p>You need to think about this and make sure you understand it.  Then I  <br />am going to ask you to sign a petition.  Yes, I hate petitions too.   <br />But it's the only way I can think of to spread the word to the people  <br />that they can save their own Social Security for pennies per week.   <br />And not have to turn it into welfare by "raising the cap,"  or make  <br />it worthless as retirement insurance by cutting benefits, means  <br />testing, or raising the retirement age.</p>
<p>The petition calls for enactment of CBO Option 2 or 3.  It is not so  <br />important exactly which of these is enacted, or some variation.  What  <br />is important is that people learn how cheap it would be for them to  <br />save their own Social Security.  They won't learn it from the media,  <br />the politicians, or the experts.</p>
<p>Please visit    <a href="http://signon.org/sign/fix-social-security-with">http://signon.org/sign/fix-social-security-with</a>? <br />source=s.em.cp&r_by=4120788  and sign the petition.  Then, and I know  <br />this is an imposition,  ask your friends to read this and talk about  <br />it, and sign the petition.</p>
<p>Thanks!<br /></tt></p>

<div></div>
<div>This link  SHOULD get you to the CURRENT summary. Which means 2011 until it means 2012. When it does.</div>
<div><a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TRSUM/index.html">Social Security and Medicare Summary Report</a> BTW from all evidence 99% of all Social Security reports found in the lamestream media (because on this one the Snow Queen is right) are cribbed from the Summary which also is much the same as the introduction to the full Report. But the real juice is in the Tables and Figures which among other things show alternate projections besides the standard &#8216;Intermediate Cost alternative&#8217; always cited.

                                <p>The first link is to the 2011 Report and is meant as a teaching tool. The Table shows projected income, cost, and balance projections over what the Trustees consider the &#8216;short term&#8217;, which is the same ten years used by OMB and CBO in their scoring. <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/2011/IV_A_SRest.html#317992">Table IV.A3.—Operations of the Combined OASI and DI Trust Funds, Calendar Years 2006-20 </a><br />Traditionally income came in three primary forms: contributions from payroll (FICA), tax on benefits, and interest on Trust Fund principal. In 2011 the loss of income due to the payroll tax holiday was projected to be replaced by General Fund transfers so adding a fourth (offsetting) category. Cost also comes in three forms with benefits constituting more than 99% (including Railroad Retirement Board interchange) and admin just under 1%. In any year when total income including accrued interest exceeds total cost the Table shows a surplus &#8216;Net increase during year&#8217; and a corresponding addition to the Trust Fund balance &#8216;Amount at end of year&#8217;. And taken ON ITS OWN TERMS, combined OASDI shows continuing surpluses through the ten year window to a total of something over $900 billion in surpluses. Which BTW score as such on the top line number CBO and subsequently the press report as THE Budget Surplus/Deficit. Okay then where is the crisis? What part of &#8216;near a trillion dollar surplus&#8217; don&#8217;t we understand? Well there are a couple of answers to that, which to start with will require some longer range outlook. New table below the fold. <br /><a name="more"></a><a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/2011/VI_F3_OASDHI_dollars.html#201773">Table VI.F8.—Operations of the Combined OASI and DI Trust Funds,  in Current Dollars, Calendar Years 2011-85</a> This table shows longer term projections under the three different economic and demographic models used by the Trustees of which &#8216;Intermediate Cost&#8217; is the standard one. Here we can see that under IC projections surpluses vanish soon after the ten year window of Table IV.A3 and that year end balances start shrinking ultimately to vanish in 2036. Now the end of surpluses and even depletion of Trust Fund balances doesn&#8217;t mean that there simply are no funds to pay any benefits, even in 2035 &#8216;Income excluding interest&#8217; STILL will exceed $2.2 trillion a year. On the other hand projected Cost under the scheduled benefit would be a little over $2.8 trillion, leaving a 22% or so gap. And since under current law Social Security has no ability to borrow would require an abrupt drop in benefits to 78% of the schedule.  So THAT is the agreed definition of &#8216;crisis&#8217;: &#8216;sudden immediate drop in benefits by 22% at the point of Trust Fund Depletion&#8217;. But that is also the point where agreement stops as a divide arises between what I will call Social Security &#8216;supporters&#8217;, &#8216;reformers&#8217; and &#8216;Rosserites&#8217; (a term I just invented). For &#8216;supporters&#8217;, that is for advocates of traditional Social Security crisis focuses on &#8216;drop&#8217;. As a result their range of policy responses mostly revolve around ways to avoid the cut altogether, which given a system where non-benefit costs (i.e. admin) represent 1% of total costs, requires boosts on the income side. Hence approaches ranging from &#8216;lift the cap&#8217; to Dale Coberly&#8217;s &#8216;good grief, it is just 40 cents a week to start if you gradually boost FICA&#8217;. On the other hand while some &#8216;reformers&#8217; pay at least lip service to &#8216;drop&#8217; their real concern is the &#8216;sudden immediate&#8217; part and what they anticipate will be the political reaction: which in their imagination means millions of screaming &#8216;Greedy Geezer&#8217; Boomers descending on Capitol Hill demanding that all scheduled benefits be paid in full no matter what. So their range of policy responses fall into two basic approaches plus a blend. One approach is to appeal to the Magical Fairy Dust of Equity Markets and claim that private accounts will simply make up the difference. Another approach is just to avoid the &#8216;sudden&#8217; part by simply phasing in the cut by such things as means testing, retirement age adjustments, changes in CPI whatever that end up with the same 22% (or more) cut but with less drama. And the more cynical ones combine both approaches by pretending (or believing) that Magical Fairy Dust will just offset those gradual cuts and everyone (but especially account managers of private accounts) will live happily ever after.  But either way this leaves &#8216;supporters&#8217; and &#8216;reformers&#8217; talking past each other with the former focused on avoiding cuts altogether while the latter concentrate on making them imperceptible. But which makes them just not hear solutions that would actually cost them anything, because &#8216;cuts&#8217; as such are not where they see the problem to start with.  Now somewhere between &#8216;supporters&#8217; and &#8216;reformers&#8217; are the distinct minority of &#8216;Rosserites&#8217;. And by &#8216;distinct minority&#8217; I mean Professor Barkley J Rosser and your (not-so) humble blogger. (Although such luminaries as Prof K and Dean Baker at least acknowledge that we exist and have a point). Now Rosserites are opposed by the non-Rosserites (which mostly means AB commenter Dale Coberly, we could have a joint meeting of both sides in a phone booth-if such existed anymore)who I think misjudge us. That is where Rosserites are making an observation, and drawing a theoretical conclusion, we are not in fact ADVOCATING that outcome, just pointing out that the 22% cut at Trust Fund Exhaustion is not in full context a &#8216;crisis&#8217; at all. And that understanding this allows us to modulate our responses to what all agree is a problem, whether that be defined as &#8216;cut&#8217; or &#8216;sudden&#8217;.  Rosserites, or at least this Rosserite, point to the following 2002 Congressional Budget Office Report: <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/publication/14580">The Future Growth of Social Security: It&#8217;s Not Just Society&#8217;s Aging</a> and particularly to Figure 2 on page 2. Now in what may be the least known aspect of Social Security it turns out that the scheduled benefit under current law actually results in increased REAL benefits over time. That is measured in terms of actual purchaseable basket of goods the average benefit was projected to rise from $14,000 in 2002 dollars to $26,000 in 2002 dollars between 2002 and the end of the 75 year projection period. Or close to a 85% REAL INCREASE for the retiree of 2077 as opposed to what my Mom got in 2002. Which Rosserites take as an argument to put the 22% cut in 2036 in the context of this upward sloping baseline. That is per CBO benefits at the point of Trust Fund Depletion (using 2002) projections were scheduled to be about 140-150% of then current benefits and a 25% cut to THAT still rendered what I cheekily call &#8216;Rosser&#8217;s Equation&#8217; (Barkley can&#8217;t decide whether to be &#8216;bemused&#8217; or &#8216;amused&#8217; by this), that is 75% of 150% = 115%. Meaning that the real world consequence of that &#8216;sudden&#8217; &#8216;cut&#8217; would still be a check 15% better than my Mom gets today. In real basket of goods terms. Which doesn&#8217;t mean we shouldn&#8217;t take steps to avoid or at least mitigate that cut, just to point out that it is hard to parse &#8216;15% better real benefit&#8217; into &#8216;Boomer Geezers giving Gen-X a bone job&#8217;. Or in less crude terms &#8216;what the heck kind of &#8216;intergenerational warfare&#8217; are we talking here?&#8217;  Well it is getting close to Report release time and I want to leave time for people to do some fact checking and link following. All I ask is that people keep the reality of the current baseline of the scheduled benefit in mind when assessing &#8216;crisis&#8217; if and when the Trust Fund actually goes to zero balances.</p>
