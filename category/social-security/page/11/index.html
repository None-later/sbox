<p>And by &#8216;framing&#8217; I mean as in Film Noir gangster movies rather than Lakoffian terms. (Apropos of nothing, Prof. Lakoff gave me the worst grade I ever got in college, but felt so bad about it I wanted to tell HIM to &#8216;buck up&#8217;. Long time ago.)</p>
<p>Peter Orszag has made quite a stir with a couple of Op-Eds this last weekend of which the most recent was <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/15/opinion/15orszag.html?_r=1">Safer Social Security</a> in which he cleverly indicts and then sentences Social Security with the following:<br />
<blockquote>Nevertheless, Social Security does face an actuarial deficit. Current projections suggest that, after 2037, benefits would need to be reduced by more than 20 percent to match revenue. Measured over the next 75 years, the deficit in Social Security is expected to amount to 0.7 percent of the economy — not a huge amount, but a deficit nonetheless.</p>
<p>So it would be desirable to put the system on sounder financial footing. And that is precisely what the co-chairmen of President Obama’s bipartisan commission on reducing the national debt have bravely proposed to do. It’s too bad their proposal has been greeted with so much criticism, especially from progressives — who really should look at it as an opportunity to fix Social Security without privatizing it. Although the plan leans too much on future benefit reductions and not enough on revenue increases, it still offers a good starting point for reform.</p></blockquote>
<p> Well this is going to take a whole lot of unpacking, and the only question is where to start. And a prosaic answer is &#8216;Under the fold&#8217;.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />Orszag&#8217;s first move is to point out that Social Security faces an actuarial defict and defines the effect of that in terms of a &#8216;more than 20 percent&#8217; cut after 2037, and then proceeds to quantify that cut as an actuarial gap of 0.7% of the economy. Already he is having things two ways. Lets say we adopted a plan of &#8216;Nothing&#8217; in the face of &#8216;Crisis&#8217;, what would be the result on that actuarial gap? Well one answer is that the accumulated Social Security Trust Funds would be drawn down to  depletion, which if nothing was done in response would require a 22% cut from the scheduled benefit. Now whether this cut actually even represents a &#8216;Crisis&#8217; depends on your reaction to what I call &#8216;Rosser&#8217;s Equation&#8217;. Under the current schedule real benefits as measured in terms of a basket of good are set to grow by 100% over the seventy five year projection and account for a full 45% of program growth over that period, which can be seen in graphic form via this 2003 CBO Report <a target="_blank" href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/www.cbo.gov/doc.cfm?index=4380&#038;type=0">The Future Growth of Social Security: It&#8217;s Not Just Society&#8217;s Aging</a>. This growth in real benefits is such that even a 22% cut on Trust Fund depletion in 2037 would still result in a better real result for the retiree of 2038 with Rosser&#8217;s Equation yielding something close to &#8216;78% of 160% =125%&#8217;, in this context &#8216;Crisis&#8217; means &#8216;25% better real check than my Mom gets today&#8217;. Which should pose two questions: one to the hardline deficit guy of &#8216;Well then Who Cares?&#8217; and another to the New Dealer &#8216;How do we close the gap?&#8217;.</p>
<p>Taking the hardliner first. In his world Social Security &#8216;crisis&#8217; takes two forms. The one cited most often is the actuarial gap between scheduled and payable benefits over the 75 year and Infinite Future Horizon, that is what it would cost to appease that New Dealer and deliver 100% of the schedule. And those numbers are expressed in three ways in the following Table from the 2010 Report: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/2010/IV_LRest.html#267528">Table IV.B6.—Unfunded OASDI Obligations for 1935 (Program Inception) Through the Infinite Horizon,</a> If we take as SS critics like to do the Infinite Future numbers we see a gap of $16.1 trillion which equates to 3.3% of payroll and 1.2% of GDP, or if we use the more traditional 75 year window we get corresponding numbers of $5.4 trillion, 1.8% of payroll (2.01% if you add in the requirement for a 100% reserve), and 0.6% of GDP. But what critics, and including Orszag here, glide over is that a policy of &#8216;Nothing&#8217;, if strictly adhered to resets all those numbers to zero at Trust Fund Depletion, the benefit cut itself wiping out that &#8216;unfunded liability&#8217;. Because the so-called &#8216;Unfunded Liability&#8217; is not in a legal sense a liability at all, Congress can and has changed both tax and benefit levels to raise or lower that &#8216;liability&#8217; and can effectively eliminate it altogether by simply doing &#8216;Nothing&#8217;. Meaning that critics can present either the 22% percent cut or that 0.6% GDP gap as being the definition of crisis but putting them both forward at the same time is just dishonest. Because the cut in and of itself eliminates the gap.</p>
<p>So a policy of &#8216;Nothing&#8217; projects the following result: 100% of the scheduled benefit payable until 2037 with retirees in that year getting a roughly 60% better check than today, and then if the economic projections are correct (a big if) then a cut to a Pay-Go status in 2038 that would have initial benefits only 25% better than today and then a continued (if slower) growth in real terms from then on. How does this result remotely add up to crisis for the hardliners? Well it is a mostly unstated political calculation, they believe that when push comes to shove that then current retirees will demand that the full schedule be paid ANYWAY, no matter what the consequences. So what is the &#8216;brave&#8217; answer to this future political showdown? Convince workers that &#8216;crisis&#8217; doesn&#8217;t mean &#8216;25% better real check&#8217; but instead &#8216;no check for me&#8217; and so accept a phased in benefit cut that STILL ends up with most workers getting a worse deal than plain &#8216;Nothing&#8217;. And especially those workers who will have spent most of their projected retirement already by 2037. The SSA Office of the Chief Actuary scored the ultimate effects of Simpson-Bowles as a percentage of scheduled and payable (i.e. after cut) benefits at various income levels, which scores were mostly extracted in the following post here: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/11/more-from-ssa-on-simpson-bowles-plans.html">More From SSA on Simpson-Bowles</a>. And the results show that everyone in the top 60-70% of lifetime wage earnings comes out a loser, first  taking initially small cuts from the schedule starting in 2010 that by 2037 have the &#8216;High&#8217; and &#8216;Maximum&#8217; earners taking the same cut by 2040 as &#8216;Nothing&#8217; would enroute to a 35% or 41% cut compared to the schedule respectively by 2080.</p>
<p>Now why does Orszag insist that progressives should accept this cut for the majority of beneficiaries as the starting point for compromise? Because it isn&#8217;t privatization. Oh boy, oh joy we get to trade slow bleeding for amputation! Instead of say going for a complete cure.</p>
<p>Now that we know what result &#8216;Nothing&#8217; would deliver for the typical beneficiary, that is a 25% better basket of real goods even after the reset, what would be the cost of a &#8216;Something&#8217; that would actually deliver 100% of the schedule or a 60% better basket? Orszag and friends won&#8217;t even allow you to go there, by methods fair and foul they  have prevented open discussion of what  in real terms a revenue based solution would mean, and in particular any revenue based solution starting from across the board payroll tax increases. The unstated implication is that such solutions would be too costly for the average worker for the benefits accrued, but despite a lot of talk about &#8216;all options being on the table&#8217; this one is not offered even in expectation of it being rejected. Because odds are it wouldn&#8217;t be, in comparison to the drastic cuts presented as an alternative the needed tax increases would be a flea bite.</p>
<p>CBO recently scored 30 different policy options to address the projected 0.6% of GDP gap between scheduled and payable benefits in a Report linked from and with key graphic reproduced in this AB post <a target="_blank' href=" http:>CBO Scores Social Security Policy Options</a>. Now a lot of progressives insist the answer is easy: &#8220;Lift the cap&#8221; and depending on how you lift the cap and whether you allow that increase to come with a commensurate better benefit you can fix or even more than fix the gap via that route, see Options 4 and 6. On the other hand the Option closest to the Obama campaign proposal of taxing wages over $250k at 2-6% which is no 9 only closes 1/6th of the gap. But some of the traditional SS defenders at AB think this is largely the wrong way to go, in large part because the cap has serious political and philosophical advantages in keeping Social Security a worker funded retirement system rather than a welfare system. Now Dale, Arne and me are currently on record with the NorthWest Plan which is close to Option 2 which CBO does score as backfilling the entire gap, but I would be perfectly happy with a combination of Options 3 (raise FICA 0.05% a year for 60 years) and 5 (gradually restore taxable maximum to the traditional 90% of wage income level) which disregarding possible interaction add up to a 0.7% of GDP fix to the 0.6% projected problem (CBO) or 0.7% one (SSA) and allows for adjustments in the out years.</p>
<p>But for Orszag embracing a fix in perfectly alignment with most past adjustments and maintaining the traditional balance and structure of Social Security is just us sailing up some river in Egypt, in our stubbornness unwilling to admit the &#8216;bravery&#8217; of Simpson and Bowles where that bravery involves bleeding away retirement security for the middle class while giving the truly wealthy of free pass. Well sorry, until &#8216;compromise&#8217; is defined as putting the FULL RANGE of possible solutions on the Table and engaging in a numerically honest discussion of the tradeoffs, I am inclined to ignore Peter Orszag and instead listen to the long-time champion of Social Security, Dean Baker of CEPR:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.cepr.net/index.php/publications/reports/action-on-social-security-the-urgent-need-for-delay">Action on Social Security: the Urgent Need for Delay</a> whose advice starts:<br />
<blockquote>There is enormous public confusion (much of it deliberately cultivated) about the extent of Social Security’s projected shortfall. Many policymakers and analysts point out that projections from the Congressional Budget Office and the Social Security Trustees show the program to be out of balance in the long-term, therefore we would be best advised to make changes as soon as possible. This paper argues that supporters of the existing Social Security system should try to ensure that no major changes to the core program are implemented in the immediate future. It points out that:<br />1) There is good reason for believing that the public will be better informed about the financial state of Social Security in the future, in part because of the weakening of some of the main sources of misinformation;<br />2) Many more people will be directly dependent on Social Security in the near future. These people and their families will likely be strong defenders of the program;<br />3) The group of near-retirees, who may be the victims of early action, will desperately need their Social Security since they have seen much of their wealth eliminated with the collapse of the housing bubble; and<br />4) The concern over “maintaining the confidence of financial markets” is an empty claim that can be used to justify almost any policy.</p></blockquote>
<p> Consider this post my little attempt to help out on bullet point one. &#8216;Nothing&#8217;-STILL the numerically proven plan since 1997.</p>

<p>On Thursday I put up an extract from a SSA Office of the Actuary score of one of two of the Simpson-Bowles draft Social Security plans, that is the bottom line of Plan 2A <a target="_blank" href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/11/bottom-line-score-on-simpson-bowles.html">Bottom Line Score on Simpson-Bowles</a>. This post expands on that by including the cover letter and plan details on 2A as well as details and score on 2B. As it turns out 2A and 2B have the same bottom line projections and outcomes but in the interest of completeness here you have them. This is not the complete letter, there are two more tables which did not as I could see add much. I don&#8217;t know if the letter has been published on the SSA site, I received it in PDF form, but I can forward the whole 7 pages to whoever wants it. (For example I was not able to screen capture the footnotes in a single shot so I left them off).</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Reader HM suggests this sort of letter to Congress:</p>
<blockquote><p>Senator/Representative _________:      </p>
<p>I am writing to you to ask you to join the fight against those who want to &#8220;privatize&#8221; / &#8220;personalize&#8221; or otherwise roll back the Social Security retirement insurance program as we know it.      </p>
<p>As I&#8217;m sure you know, to ensure Social Security had the funds to meet the baby boomer&#8217;s retirement this century, back in 1985 Alan Greenspan and the Democratic Congress changed the plan to overtax FICA payers so that the baby boom could pre-pay their retirements.      </p>
<p>But now that the program has over-taxed FICA payers over $1.5T (Trillion), and has another $1T of accrued interest, very powerful forces are at work to essentially steal this money from middle class ratepayers like me.      <br /><a name="more"></a>    <br />These monied interests are demagoguing our Treasury bond holdings as &#8220;just worthless IOUs&#8221;, &#8220;we just owe it to ourselves&#8221;, &#8220;Congress spent the money already&#8221; etc. in the attempt to confuse the electorate about who now owes whom this $2.5T (and growing).      </p>
<p>It is NOT true that SSA&#8217;s bonds are &#8220;worthless IOUs&#8221; &#8212; the Treasury Bonds held by SSA are just as real obligations of the US government as any other government agency&#8217;s, including for example the Alaska Permanent Fund, which holds $2.5B of Treasuries per their latest report.      </p>
<p>It is NOT true that &#8220;we just owe it to ourselves&#8221; &#8212; since Federal income tax payers are overwhelmingly well above the FICA cutoff, it can honestly be said that when the SSA Treasury bonds are redeemed to the Treasury, to raise this extra cash either a) the wealthy must pay via higher taxes, or b) we borrow the money, [or c) we print it, but I don&#8217;t want to go there].      </p>
<p>While it is true that Congress has spent the money, that&#8217;s part of the original plan. Now that the money has been spent into the economy, our economy has grown greatly since 1985 and we can and I think should now begin redeeming the bonds for the retirees who, having paid so much extra into the SSI retirement system, are now beginning to draw their money out via regular SSI checks.       </p>
<p>While there can be honest differences of opinion about how best to draw down our $2.5T holding, I urge you to do your part as my representative to preserve the system and prevent these rat bastards from STEALING MY MONEY.  </p>
<p>Thank you.</p></blockquote>

Now this is probably not as satisfying as the (hat tip Yves Smith crosspost) post from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2010/11/guest-post-open-letter-to-alan-simpson-erskine-bowles-chairmen-of-the-u-s-deficit-commission-regarding-proposed-changes-to-social-security-%C2%BB.html">Steve</a> at the <em>Daily Bail</em>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear&#8212;&#8212;-,  <br />I hope that you will be standing tall against the current forces of deception that are campaigning hard to destabilize Social Security as we know it.  The SS program works very well and has been doing so since its inception.  The program is in the black and only a deceitful campaign to destroy the program presents it any other way.  The Trust Fund is real and is a debt to the system as well as the program&#8217;s &#8220;savings account&#8221; upon which if draws when receipts from FICA are insufficient to cover benefits.  Do not conflate Social Securities solvency with the deficit condition of the general budget or the Medicare program.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />  The Peterson Foundation is leading this deceptive attack on the sanctity of Social Security in a brazen attempt to weaken that system and move ever closer to a privatization scheme.  The so-called bipartisan Deficit Commission, correctly maligned as the Cat Food Commission,  is stacked against Social Security. It&#8217;s Chairmen&#8217;s preliminary recommendations are absurd if the purpose of the Commission is to genuinely find a means by which to balance the general budget.  It lacks even face validity.  That is not surprising as its two Chairs have previously expressed their individual biases.  Mr. Simpson has been publicly derisive of the Social Security program.  Mr. Bowles is a hand maiden to the investment banking community serving as a Board member of JP Morgan bank and receiving compensation of $300,000 for attending several Board meetings each year.  That&#8217;s bi-partisan??  Only if one considers right of center and far right as the measure.   </p>
<p>I&#8217;m looking for you to play a more significant role protecting the interests of working middle class Americans in any effort to &#8220;adjust&#8221; Federal spending, taxation and Social Security.</p></blockquote>

It shows the final results of the Simpson-Bowles Social Security proposal as percentage of benefits payable to various income levels compared to &#8216;scheduled&#8217; and &#8216;payable&#8217; benefits. Under current projections &#8216;payable&#8217; benefits after Trust Fund Depletion will have to be reduced by 22% initially and 25% ultimately. On the other hand &#8216;scheduled&#8217; benefits are payable in full up to the point of Depletion. So any payout less than 100% in the &#8216;scheduled&#8217; column between now and 2037 is a loss compared to the status quo as is any payout less than 78% in 2037 or 75% in 2080.</p>
<p>Coberly and I (and some others) have been warning for years about the dangers of turning Social Security from an insurance program with mild progressive transfers to a welfare system. Well this is a pure illustration of that, I can&#8217;t imagine any scheme designed to more undermine support for Social Security than one that calls for earners in the top 50% taking a cut even from the projected cut. The answer to a &#8216;crisis&#8217; defined as an ultimate 25% cut in scheduled benefit is for upper income folk to take a 35-41% cut? All in an effort to save them a phased in 0.1% of payroll per year increase over the next 20 years?</p>
<p>(In passing note that despite promises to hold current retirees harmless changes in (mostly) COLA result in cuts compared to the 2030 baseline of between 5% for medium earners to 12% for maximum earners.)</p>

<p>&#8216;&#8230;is that the strategy to get major slashes to Social Security and Medicare takes an Seven Step and that this technique is not new and in fact mirrors the original plan for Bush&#8217;s Commission to Strengthen Social Security (CSSS) in 2001-2002.</p>
<p>Step one. Get consensus on &#8216;Crisis&#8217;. In this case that current debt growth levels are unsustainable.<br />Step two. Get consensus that there are only three possible paths out: revenue increases (A), cuts in military and other discretionary spending (B1 and B2), or cuts to non-discretionary spending, meaning Medicare and Social Security (C)<br />Step three: Having agreed that some combination of A, B, and C is needed set up a Commission with a mandate to propose an up or down vote.<br />Step four. Committee decides it is unwise to increase taxes during a recession and eliminates (A). Commission further decides that it is unwise to cut defense spending in the middle of two wars eliminating (B1) and that eliminating infrastructure spending or farm supports is both unwise or politically impossible in the current climate (B2)<br />Step five. Recommend a package of cuts to Medicare and Social Security-C on the basis of shared sacrifice, after all every CD and State has a share of the elderly population.<br />Step Six: Tell Congress that the statute doesn’t allow them to revisit A or B and then that NOT voting for a C based solution means denial of Steps one and two.<br />Seven: Either get a vote for C or run against opponents as ‘Do Nothing Deficit Deniers”</p>

Obama’s Bowles and Simpson fiscal commission:<br />
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Social Security cuts: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Index the retirement age to longevity &#8212; i.e., increase the retirement age to qualify for Social Security &#8212; to age 69 by 2075.</li>
<li>Index Social Security yearly increases to inflation rather than wages, which will generally mean lower cost of living increases and less money per average recipient.</li>
<li>&#8220;Increase progressivity of benefit formula&#8221; &#8212; i.e., means test part of Social Security benefits by 2050.</li>
<li>Increase the Social Security contribution ceiling: while <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Security_Wage_Base">people only pay Social Security taxes on the first $106,800 of their wages today</a>, that&#8217;s only about 86% of the total potentially taxable wages. The co-chairs suggest raising the ceiling to capture 90% of wages.</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="more"></a>
<p><strong>Tax reform:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The co-chairs suggest capping both government expenditures and revenue at 21% of GDP eventually.</li>
<li>In their first plan, called &#8220;The Zero Plan,&#8221; they suggest reducing the tax brackets to three personal brackets and one corporate rate while eliminated all credits and deductions. Without any credits or deductions (including the ETIC and mortgage interest deductions), the 3 tax rates would be 8, 14 and 23 percent.</li>
<li>In their second plan, they would increase the personal deduction to $15,000, create 3 tax brackets (15, 25 and 35%); repeal or significantly curtail a number of popular tax deductions (including the state and local deduction and the mortgage interest deduction); and eliminate other tax expenditures.</li>
<li>The third plan would force Congress to undertake comprehensive tax reform by 2012 by raising taxes for each year Congress fails to act.</li>
<li>All their proposals limit Congress to collecting taxes on income made within the United States, reducing or eliminating taxes on American expats and revenues companies earn abroad.</li>
<li>They also suggest raising the federal gas tax by 15 cents per gallon.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Medicaid/Medicare cuts</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Force more low-income individuals into Medicaid managed care.</li>
<li>Increase Medicaid co-pays.</li>
<li>Accelerate already-planned cuts to Medicare Advantage and home health care programs.</li>
<li>Create a cap for Medicaid/Medicare growth that would force Congress and the President to increase premiums or co-pays or raise the Medicare eligibility age (among other options) if the system encounters cost overruns over the course of 5 years.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Discretionary spending cuts</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Eliminate all earmarks.</li>
<li>Eliminate the Office of Safe and Drug-Free Schools.</li>
<li>Freeze federal worker wage increases through 2014; eliminate 200,000 federal jobs by 2020; and eliminate 250,000 federal non-defense contractor jobs by 2015.</li>
<li>Eliminate subsidized student loans, in which the government makes interest payments while the student is in school.</li>
<li>Establish co-pays in the VA medical system and change the co-pays and deductibles for military retirees that remain in that system.</li>
<li>Eliminate NASA funding for commercial space flight.</li>
<li>Require the Smithsonian museums to start charging entrance fees and raise fees at the national parks.</li>
<li>Eliminate funding to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting &#8212; which many conservatives suggested in the wake of the firing of former NPR contributor Juan Williams.</li>
<li>Reduce farm subsidies by $3 billion per year.</li>
<li>Create a Committee to eliminate unnecessary programs to the tune of $11 billion by 2015.</li>
<li>Merge the Department of Commerce and the Small Business Administration and cut its budget by 10 percent.</li>
<li>End &#8220;low-priority&#8221; Army Corps of Engineers programs to the tune of $1 billion by 2015.</li>
<li>Cut the State Department&#8217;s overseas budget by 10 percent by 2015; reduce the proposed foreign aid budget by 10 percent in 2015; and cut voluntary contributions to the United Nations by 10 percent in 2015. </li>
<li>Eliminate the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, which provides subsidized financing and political risk insurance for U.S. companies&#8217; investments abroad.</li>
<li>Cut $900 million in fossil fuel research funds.</li>
<li>Force airlines to increase their contributions to airline security costs and allow them to increase per-ticket security fees.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Defense spending cuts:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Double the number of defense contractor positions scheduled for elimination from 10 percent of current staff augmentees to 20 percent.</li>
<li>Reduce procurement by 15 percent, or $20 billion.</li>
<li>Eliminate the V-22 Osprey program.</li>
<li>Cancel the Marine Corps&#8217; Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle program.</li>
<li>Halve the number of F-35 Joint Strike Fighters in favor of F-16s and F/A-18Es.</li>
<li>Cancel the Marine Corps F-35 program.</li>
<li>Cancel the Navy&#8217;s Future Maritime Prepositioning Force.</li>
<li>Cancel the new Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV), the Ground Combat Vehicle, and the Joint Tactical Radio.</li>
<li>Reduce military forces in Europe and Asia by one-third.</li>

<p>A year and a half ago I put up a post here called <a target="_blank" href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2009/03/fierce-urgency-of-nothing-democratic.html">The Fierce Urgency of &#8216;Nothing&#8217;</a> whose conclusion was:<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;Nothing&#8221;. The numerically proven plan for Social Security since 1997.</p></blockquote>
<p> So you can imagine my gratification at running across the following by the co-author of the must read book from 1999 <a target="_blank" href="http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/035468.html">Social Security: the Phony Crisis</a>, economist and co-director of CEPR (Center for Economic and Policy Research) Dean Baker.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.cepr.net/index.php/publications/reports/action-on-social-security-the-urgent-need-for-delay">Action on Social Security: the Urgent Need for Delay</a><br />
<blockquote>There is enormous public confusion (much of it deliberately cultivated) about the extent of Social Security’s projected shortfall. Many policymakers and analysts point out that projections from the Congressional Budget Office and the Social Security Trustees show the program to be out of balance in the long-term, therefore we would be best advised to make changes as soon as possible. This paper argues that supporters of the existing Social Security system should try to ensure that no major changes to the core program are implemented in the immediate future. It points out that:<br />There is good reason for believing that the public will be better informed about the financial state of Social Security in the future, in part because of the weakening of some of the main sources of misinformation;<br />Many more people will be directly dependent on Social Security in the near future. These people and their families will likely be strong defenders of the program;<br />The group of near-retirees, who may be the victims of early action, will desperately need their Social Security since they have seen much of their wealth eliminated with the collapse of the housing bubble; and<br />The concern over “maintaining the confidence of financial markets” is an empty claim that can be used to justify almost any policy.</p></blockquote>
<p>The full paper in PDF can be found at this link <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cepr.net/documents/publications/ss-2010-11-1.pdf">The Urgent Need for Delay</a>. And if I say so myself goes a long way towards explaining the justification of my previous post from Sept. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/09/why-nothing-is-still-2nd-best-plan-for.html">Why &#8216;Nothing&#8221; is STILL the 2nd Best Plan for Social Security</a>. I am doing what I can here at AB  to make sure that &#8220;the public will be better informed about the financial state of Social Security in the future&#8221;, but you could do worse than taking the word from the Leader of the Pack. Because Dean has been on this beat even longer than I have, and is a real economist to boot. Go Read!!</p>

                                <p>by Bruce Webb</p>
<p>Well I guess my reputation precedes me at least a little bit. Jed Graham of Investor&#8217;s Business Daily has devised a new fix for Social Security and published it as <a target="_blank" href="http://www.awelltailoredsafetynet.com/A_Well-Tailored_Safety_Net/Table_of_Contents.html">A Well Tailored Safety Net (link to chapter summary)</a> and kindly offered to send me a copy to review. Well I am in the midst of a move South to Seattle and a new job search (see note under fold) and so won&#8217;t have time for a full reading but will put some first impressions below the fold. Mr. Graham points us to a favorable review by <s>Jonathon Chait</s> Noam Scheiber on Chait&#8217;s blog  in The New Republic (h/t Graham) <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tnr.com/blog/jonathan-chait/78729/bona-fide-social-security-fix">A Bona-Fide Social Security Fix</a> as well as a piece in The National Review by Reiham Salam <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nationalreview.com/agenda/251079/jed-graham-work-disincentives-reihan-salam">Jed Graham on Work Disincentives</a> and concludes with some apparent satisfaction:<br />
<blockquote>It’s kind of noteworthy when these liberal and conservative publications see eye to eye on an issue as ideologically divisive as Social Security reform. It’s even more noteworthy considering that these are two of the more thoughtful people writing about economic policy.</p></blockquote>
<p> Well while Chait is a reasonably consistent liberal both him and TNR lean a lot heavier in the direction of &#8216;neo&#8217; than &#8216;New Deal&#8217; liberal, if we had an equally favorable opinion from The Nation maybe we could talk here. But Angry Bear readers can make up their own minds on the substance of the reviews and the overall political approach of the reviewers.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Mr. Graham appended a copy of his testimony to the Obama Deficit Commission <a target="_blank" href="http://blogs.investors.com/capitalhill/index.php/home/35-politicsinvesting/1926-what-i-told-obamas-fiscal-commission-about-social-security">What I told Obama&#8217;s Fiscal Commission About Social Security</a>.</p>
<p>Well having let Mr. Graham by implication make his full case up-front I will address some of his points below. Rather roughly I am afraid, since merits of his specific proposal aside he is working from the same flawed conception of Social Security as almost everyone else, he just adopts them to screw over workers in a slightly more equitable way than most other &#8216;Reform&#8217; plans.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />(First on that job hunting note. I am looking for full, part time or project related work in the Seattle area, if interested my resume has its own blog <a target="_blank" href="http://planwebb.blogspot.com/">PlanWebb</a>)<br />Okay back to Mr. Graham.</p>
<p>First, and a minor carp, Graham didn&#8217;t tell the &#8216;Commission&#8217; anything, instead he meet with two unidentified but &#8220;first-rate&#8221; staff members. which considering much of that staff was supplied by Pete G Peterson may mean little more than preaching to the converted.</p>
<p>But more serious objections can be found in his chapter summaries linked above.</p>
<p>Chapter one: &#8220;Social Security’s $2.4-trillion trust fund contains no real resources.&#8221; Graham has simply adopted the &#8216;Phony IOU&#8217; narrative whole. There is nothing in the law or in past or current practice to suggest that the Special Treasuries will not be honored just as they were in the entire period from 1971 to 1982 when interest and principal were honored down to the next to the last dime or as they are being honored TODAY in respect to the DI Trust Fund which has been taking accrued interest in cash since 2006 and principal since 2009. If they are not &#8220;real resources&#8221; why is Treasury forking over some $32 billion in cash to the Disability Trust Fund in 2010 alone? The reality of those resources is proven every time a disability check hits a bank account. Graham thus loses me at sentence one.</p>
<p>Chapter two; &#8220;Social Security&#8217;s history over the past quarter-century reveals that today&#8217;s predicament of a worthless Trust  Fund didn&#8217;t take anyone by surprise&#8221;. Pure polemic. The Fund is not &#8220;worthless&#8221;, a fact revealed by the redemption of DI assets over the last year and a half with no outcry from anyone. The Special Treasuries are real as the regular Treasuries held by the CCB and the proof is in the continuing benefit checks. And Graham doesn&#8217;t build back any cred with me by titling this chapter &#8216;A political fraud&#8217;, instead the political fraud is insisting that notes that in accordance with the Social Security Act of 1935 are &#8220;fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by the Federal government&#8221; are nothing of the sort.</p>
<p>Chapter three: &#8216;The Price of Delay&#8217;. Well unless we ignore that the cost of delay since 1997 has been a projected payroll gap down by more than 10% (from 2.23% over 75 years to 2.01% in 2010) even as the change in projection period itself should add 0.05% per year to the gap, the drop itself shows that the whole concept of &#8220;We can&#8217;t afford to wait&#8221; could use some examination. And Graham suggests that an immediate fix would require 1% of GDP where a fix delayed until 2037 would require 3% which numbers could use some sourcing. Per this Table from the Report <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/2010/IV_LRest.html#267528">Table IV.B6.—Unfunded OASDI Obligations for 1935 (Program Inception)  Through the Infinite Horizon, Based on Intermediate Assumptions</a> total Infinite Horizon GDP gap is 1.2% of GDP whereas the 75 year gap is put by the Trustees at 0.6%. Nor is it clear that GDP is the right measure here, far more informative would be to put these numbers in pocketbook form as a percentage of payroll. And the Trustees put that cost if the Trust Fund goes to depletion at 3.7% of covered payroll (12.4% to 16.1%), an amount significantly less than 3% of GDP.</p>
<p>Well I don&#8217;t have the time or inclination to go through the rest of the chapters but as typical Graham ignores the simplest solution to Social Security: keep the current structure in place and raise FICA by 0.1% per year (less than a tenth of projected Real Wage increases projected) for 20 years and per CBO the problem is solved without the complicated structure proposed by Graham. Plus the table in Graham&#8217;s testimony tells it all. Under his plan average workers taking early retirement are absolute losers compared to the current system for the first seven years of retirement and only slowly make it up via extra years of life. And since the initial cut is to 56.9% instead of the current steady 80.1% the net effect is to tie low income workers to the plow for some extra work years, a prospect pleasing to those fully invested in the Protestant Work Ethic (particularly those whose own jobs are pretty cushy) but not necessarily to the low income worker who is not a good bet to beat the mortality tables anyway.</p>
<p>In any event Graham would have to address my objections to his formulations and numbers in Chapters 1-3 for me to take this proposal seriously.</p>

                                <p>by Bruce Webb</p>
<p>In the past I have travelled or lived in most parts of the U.S. and in visiting the local tavern, bar or lounge am offered some choices in types and serving sizes of beer. Most places by answering &#8216;bottle&#8217; to the question &#8216;bottle or draft&#8217; you are locked into a measured 12&#8243; serving, no more no less, which is why in most places outside Texas and maybe Colorado you can&#8217;t go too wrong ordering &#8216;a bottle of Bud&#8217; (though you might get some dirty looks by asking for a cold glass). But if you chose &#8216;draft&#8217; you can be in uncertain territory.  Most places will give you some choice between small, large and pitcher where the small is somewhat smaller than the 12 ounces you get in a bottle and the large is modeled on the English pint. But as experienced travelers/drinkers understand all too well &#8216;pint&#8217; in too many places has little relation to its standard definition of &#8217;16 ounces&#8217;, in fact in a lot of places if you order a 12 ounce bottle and a cold &#8216;pint&#8217; glass the resultant pour gets you suspiciously close to the rim. Which is why in my own State of Washington you never encounter &#8216;pints&#8217; outside an Irish Bar or brew pub, instead we drink &#8216;pounders&#8217;. Now since a standard pint of water weighs exactly a pound the implication is that your &#8216;pounder&#8217; actually contains sixteen ounces, but it is not like this is an actual violation of truth in advertising laws, most people know the score, you are lucky to get 14 ounces in a pounder and 42 ounces in a pitcher.</p>
<p>What does this have to do with Social Security? Well it offers a different way of examining what &#8216;solvency&#8217; means in relation to SS: should we be worried how close the pour is to the rim? Or to the actual contents of the serving? And the answer to that question ends up having some surprising  constraints on your policy options. Actual Social Security discussion under the fold.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />Social Security solvency is mostly reckoned in terms of income to cost ratio and presented as either a percentage of projected payroll or GDP over the given projection period. But neither that projected income or projected cost is fixed, each instead is the product of a formula or formulae whose factors are determined by actual economic and demographic outcomes compared to the baseline assumptions. And it is in my view the failure among most commentators to fully grasp that variability that distorts the policy decision field.</p>
<p>Starting at the cost end we have this CBO study from 2003: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cbo.gov/doc.cfm?index=4380&#038;type=0">The Future Growth of Social Security: It&#8217;s Not Just Society&#8217;s Aging</a>. If we examine its figures and tables we can see that fully 45% of the projected growth in Social Security over the 75 year projection period is due to improvements in real benefits delivered compared to today, in terms  of our metaphor the Trustees are promising us that if all things go right our &#8216;pint&#8217; will actually have more content ounces going forward than today and cumulatively a lot more, at the end of the day we are drinking something closer to those beer steins you see at Munich&#8217;s Oktoberfest. Prost! But a look at the revenue end gives us some more sobering news, while Social Security left unchanged can deliver 100% of scheduled benefits right up to 2037, in our metaphor a pour  right up to the rim, after that projected revenues only deliver a 78% pour. Hmm, downer. But how down should we actually be? This graph from  Dean Baker at CEPR (though designed to illustrate a different point) is instructive: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cepr.net/index.php/blogs/cepr-blog/social-security-and-the-washington-post-who-is-going-down-first">Social Security and the Washington Post: Who Is Going Down First?</a>. What the graph shows is a fairly dramatic cutback in benefits at Trust Fund depletion, in numeric terms 22%. But note that the resulting beer stein STILL holds more ounces of beer than the one retirees get today, indeed about 20% more ounces. Moreover the pour starts improving  in short order and by mid-century is as big as it ever was and then stein and pour continue to grow throughout the projection period. Now if we take the 2010 to 2037 line and extend it we see that our retiree/drinker of 2085 coulda/woulda been drinking from a full stein some 25% bigger than the one he ends up with. But  still his daily beer ration remains more than double of what it is today.</p>
<p>Most policy discussions today hyperfocus on ways to get the stein and the pour into perfect alignment. Social Security &#8216;reformers&#8217; tend to focus on ways to shrink the stein to meet the projected pour, preferably without a sudden transition that will upset the customers. Veteran beer drinkers will recognize this approach, typically bartenders wanting to skimp on beer serving sizes simply swap out their &#8216;pints&#8217; with ones with gradually thicker sides and bottoms, the result looks the same and feels the same in your hand, but over time just doesn&#8217;t deliver the same zip. On the other hand supporters of traditional Social Security like Angry Bear&#8217;s Dale Coberly focus on ways to keep the pour right up to the rim of the growing stein, in Dale&#8217;s case by pointing out that the cost to the customer for that brimful of beer is just pennies per week. But I suggest what is important is not the alignment of brim and pour but the actual amount of the pour.</p>
<p>This post was inspired by an exchange between Dean and Henry Aaron of Brookings that I was privy to in which Aaron made the following observation in relation to the effect of higher real wages or an adjustment in the payroll cap adding to the total Social Security wage base:<br />
<blockquote>A larger tax base has some effect on benefits.  Since 1972, the system gains only very little, because a higher wage base raises taxes today and benefits later on; the system makes money on the time-value of money, but nothing else (in the pre-indexing days, the story is more complex).</p></blockquote>
<p> And if you define a balanced &#8216;system&#8217; with a perfect alignment between brim and pour this is quite true. But if you focus on actual pour size that &#8216;nothing else&#8217; becomes something pretty significant. If we turn again to Dean&#8217;s figure and plug in higher real wages and a larger wage base oveall the effect is to drive the dark blue benefit line into a steeper rise. This does not necessarily delay the time of Trust Fund Depletion or the percentage of reset but it does or should change the resultant pour, from the perspective of the worker the same percentage cut from a higher baseline means more beer today and  more beer than projected in the long term.</p>
<p>Some beer drinkers feel cheated if their &#8216;pint&#8217; is not filled to the point that it overflows onto the serving tray as it is being brought to the table. Me I&#8217;ll just take that honest pint. Now looking forwards I would want as big a pour as I could get in my growing stein but my concern would be measuring from the bottom of the stein to the top of the pour and not the top of the pour to the rim of the stein, in the end I am a beer drinker wanting my fair serving whatever the variations in the glassware.</p>
