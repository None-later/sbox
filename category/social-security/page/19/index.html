In reality the two Social Security Trust Funds have portfolios of securities with stated maturities and rates. As these become due each year they are  rolled over into new securities in whole or in part. If the particular program is running a cash deficit as the DI (Disability Insurance) has been since 2006 some of those securities are redeemed for cash and the amount of new securities issued to compensate for interest accrued on the Trust Fund are reduced by exactly that amount. This cash transfer did not cause the sky to fall three years ago, in fact like a tree in the woods nobody except a few people at Treasury or SSA even knew it was happening. In the case of OAS it ran a cash surplus in 2008 with the effect that more securities were issued than retired as shown here. In less than ten years OAS like DI before it will have cash needs in excess of cash receipts from taxation and a small part of its accrued interest will be paid out by Treasury in cash rather than in Special Treasuries and this too will not cause the sky to fall, instead it will be just a normal transaction between the Treasury and SSA.</p>
<p>In the context of total transfers in and out of Treasury the day the OAS Trust Fund moves from what CBO calls Primary Surplus to Primary Deficit will barely be a ripple on the huge wave of money going back and forth. Only morons and people trying to fool you claim this event is meaningful. Now it is true that after ten or fifteen years that ripple that started in 2016 MIGHT start getting noticeable and the column on the right starts looking notably smaller than the one on the left which would then be an argument for putting Plan NW into place for 2028. But the notion that we should be panicked because a combined event projected for 2017 now projects for 2016 is just scare-mongering. Because no part of those T-Bills look phony to me.</p>

                                <p>by Bruce Webb &#038; Coberly</p>
<p>(Update: links to Google versions of spreadsheets added. .xls versions available by request)<br />The Northwest Plan is put forth here as a replacement for the plan of Nothing <a target="_blank" href="http://bruceweb.blogspot.com/2006/05/cost-of-inactivity-nothing-as-plan-for.html">The Cost of Inactivity: &#8216;Nothing&#8217; as a Plan for Social Security</a>. Not that there is anything wrong with Nothing, we did nothing between 1997 and 2008 and the size of the problem facing Social Security shrank from 2.23% of payroll to 1.7%, and the date of Trust Fund Depletion moved out from 2029 to 2041. There must be a word for a problem that left unaddressed got smaller and more distant in time, but that word is not &#8216;crisis&#8217;. So while Nothing&#8217; has its merits it just is not as satisfying as Something, especially when the Henny Penny&#8217;s of this world are running around insisting the sky is falling. So the Northwest Plan is our Something.</p>
<p>It is often claimed that we just can&#8217;t tax or grow our way our of the so-called &#8216;Entitlements Crisis&#8217; which is true if you believe there is some sort of SocialSecurityMedicareMedicaid program out there. But there isn&#8217;t any such program and there is no good reason to insist that these programs be considered together. If we isolate Social Security we can see that there are very good possibilities the economy will grow fast enough to continue shrinking the payroll gap just as it did over the last dozen years. And if it doesn&#8217;t the cost of closing the gap via tweaks in payroll can be managed in a way that it would not be noticed. Hence the Northwest Plan.</p>
<p>The Plan comes in two flavors, the Tenth Now plan and the Trigger plan. There has been a certain amount of debate over the last few years that the Trustees&#8217; Intermediate Cost alternative&#8217;s economic projections were too negative and that we can afford to take his year by year using the numerically proven plan of Nothing. The Tenth Now plan essentially abandons that argument and just accepts Intermediate Cost at face value as a basis for planning policy. Per the 2008 Report the cost of a straight out fix via a payroll tax increase would be 1.7%, presumedly split as now with 0.85% paid by the employer and 0.85% by the employee. This is not a lot of money when you break it down to the individual worker, on the other hand the actual dollars won&#8217;t be needed for a few decades, there is no reason we cannot phase this in gradually.</p>
<p>Under Tenth Now FICA rates would be boosted by 0.1% every year from 2010 to 2029 then held steady until 2053 where if needed a new series of increases would be triggered. We say if needed because there are very good chances that we may never need to pull that trigger, and pretty good chances that we can halt the original set of increases prior to 2029 as actual numbers come in. The advantage of Tenth Now is that it arithmetically fixes Social Security and so removes it from the policy debate and with it takes $13.6 trillion in &#8216;unfunded liability&#8217; off the balance sheets thus removing a weapon from the hands of those who want to use projections over the God help us &#8216;Infinite Future Horizon&#8217; to scare us into gutting Social Security.</p>
<p>But the truth is that we could maintain a program of Nothing. Under current law Social Security is considered to be in Short Term Actuarial Balance if its Trust Fund Ratio is projected to remain above 100 (one year of reserves) in each of the next ten years. If we examine the projections of Intermediate Cost in the following table we can see that the combined Trust Funds will maintain TF ratios above 100 until around 2037 meaning that they would fail the Short Term test in 2028. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/IV_LRest.html#316289">Table IV.B3.—Estimated Trust Fund Ratios, Calendar Years 2008-85[In percent]</a>. The Trigger Plan uses that test failure as the event to trigger a new set of increases starting in 2028 that arithmetically keep the combined TF ratio above 100 throughout the standard 75 year window.</p>
<p>On a pure policy basis the Trigger Plan is a better choice because it builds in flexibility. If the economy performs worse than projected the trigger point moves up, if the economy performs better than projected the trigger point moves out but in either case the phased in nature of the changes means no sudden economic discontinuities. Politically Tenth Now might be preferable because it demonstrates how small the cost of a fix really is when it comes right down to the individual weekly paycheck.</p>
<p>Update: Google spreadsheets: <a target="_blank" href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=ru4Qp28bP72l2gsRvR_-yGQ">NW Plan-Trigger</a>&#8212;- <a target="_blank" href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=rUd69spjuuumNuYeAYFA1dQ">NW Plan-Tenth Now</a> <br />Excel or Appleworks versions are available on request by e-mailing Bruce at Bruce dot Webb2 at verizon dot net.</p>
<p>Both Tenth Now and Trigger treat Social Security as an undifferentiated whole. In truth OAS (Old/Age Survivors) and DI (Disability) are separate programs with separate trust funds. As it turns out DI already has failed the Short Term Actuarial Balance test. This suggest that the right solution is to apply a modified Tenth Now to DI that would have payroll increasing 0.05% (a Twentieth) each year for five years starting in 2010 which then would be followed up by a modified Trigger of about 0.07% for OAS in 2028. This works on a back of the envelope calculation but has not been turned into an actual spreadsheet.</p>
<p>The real reason for releasing the Northwest Plan this week (because versions of it have been discussed here at AB for months) is that with the release of the 2009 Social Security Report Tuesday afternoon we fully expect a full court press to push the Conrad-Gregg/Cooper Wolf SAFE bi-partisan commission legislation which is designed to force a plan based on benefit cuts through Congress on an up or down basis with little scope for debate or modification. It is important that people know that there are alternatives, including one that requires no changes at all until 2028. The only urgency here is among those who don&#8217;t want you to know how easily we can maintain Social Security as is.</p>

                                <p>by Bruce Webb; plan details and numbers by Coberly and Arne</p>
<p>The Northwest Plan takes as a starting point by answering the question raised in <a target="_blank" href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/05/time-for-clarity-income-vs-cost-six.html">A Time for Clarity</a> by coming down clearly on the side of the beneficiary. Which among other things means accepting that the current Trust Fund is an asset and not a liability. This doesn&#8217;t mean we can ignore the burden it places on future taxpayers, we just insist it be placed in numeric context. Exactly how much burden does redemption really place on future taxpayers? By year? And &#8216;$13.6 trillion over the Infinite Future Horizon&#8217; is not in fact an answer to those questions.</p>
<p>The Northwest Plan starts by examining the six possible approaches and initially rejects the two that are directly harmful to future beneficiaries which is to say 1) raise retirement age &#038; 2) adjust benefit formulae. There are projections that would force us to those positions but we see no reason to start with the proposition &#8220;Mom is projected to living longer than her Gramma did so lets just hitch her to the plow until she is 70&#8221;. Because for most workers retirement is the goal and not something you are &#8220;forced to&#8221; endure. Healthy time with the grandkids, time to travel, time not being under the thumb of your boss is what we are shooting for.</p>
<p>This is not to say that the Northwest Plan slavishly insists on delivering exactly 100% of the scheduled benefit, just that we get as close to it as we can without undue burden on workers or diverting assets away from other social goods. Of the three of us Arne and I am most mindful of Rosser&#8217;s Equation, which takes into account the fact that since initial benefits rise with real wage that future retirees will be able to buy a bigger basket of goods than current ones do. In fact if we did nothing to Social Security and the economy came in line with Intermediate Cost projections the reset in benefits in 2041 still leaves future retirees with a better benefit than currently situated retirees gets today. While a 22% cut seems drastic and is something the Northwest Plan is designed to avoid we do note that with Prof. Rosser that 78% of 160% = 125%. (I want my great-niece to have a better life-style in retirement than her great-grandmother (my Mom) does today. On the other hand my Mom is doing just fine, that N. would only get a 25% better deal would not be not a tragedy. Still I want to deliver 60% if I can.)</p>
<p>So if benefit cuts are what we are trying to avoid, which of the other four approaches do we favor? Well I don&#8217;t think any of us reject out of hand diversifying Social Security away from bonds to other asset categories, if that is if that didn&#8217;t put benefits unduly at risk and promised a better result. None of the Plans I am aware of take that approach, each has a component that cuts guaranteed benefits, and too many take a Dow 36,000 approach to potential risk of equities. Nor do we favor approaching this via raising the cap outright, though I for one would be open to adjusting the formula that increases it annually. But that is not part of the current Northwest Plan. What is is below the fold.</p>
<p>If we reject initially approaches 1-4 we are left with 5 &#038; 6: raise payroll tax across the board, or  target policy in ways that will lead to increases in Real Wage. Given that the future is unknowable the Northwest Plan starts by assuming Intermediate Cost but builds in triggers to account for performance better than that. (If the economy performs substantially under Intermediate Cost we will have problems far bigger than Social Security to contend with). What is the real cost of a payroll based fix?</p>
<p>Well in large part it depends on when you start, the Trustees explain it as follows.<br />
<blockquote>Over the full 75-year projection period the actuarial deficit estimated for the combined trust funds is 1.70 percent of taxable payroll—0.26 percentage point smaller than the 1.95 percent deficit projected in last year’s report. This deficit indicates that financial adequacy of the program for the next 75 years could be restored if increases were made equivalent to immediately and per manently increasing the Social Security payroll tax from its current level of 12.4 percent (for employees and employers combined) to 14.10 percent. Alternatively, changes could be made equivalent to reducing all current and future benefits by about 11.5 percent. Other ways of reducing the deficit include making transfers from general revenues or adopting some combina tion of approaches.<br />If no action were taken until the combined trust funds become exhausted in 2041, then the effects of changes would be more concentrated on fewer years and fewer cohorts:<br />•<br />For example, payroll taxes could be raised to finance scheduled benefits fully in every year starting in 2041. In this case, the payroll tax would be increased to 15.94 percent at the point of trust fund exhaustion in 2041 and continue rising to 16.60 percent in 2082.<br />•<br />Similarly, benefits could be reduced to the level that is payable with scheduled tax rates in each year beginning in 2041. Under this scenario, benefits would be reduced 22 percent at the point of trust fund exhaus tion in 2041, with reductions reaching 25 percent in 2082.</p></blockquote>
<p>In summary we could raise payroll tax by 1.70% immediately, or we could wait until 2041 and raise it by 3.54% initially with increases of an additional 0.66% over the subsequent forty-two years.</p>
<p>This gives us a range of options for a tax-based fix, and none of them are ugly, in each case the net is a better real basket of goods. For example  take a worker making a wage of $12.50 per hour, fairly typical for a moderately skilled laborer or clerk, which over the course of a year gives a annual wage income of $26,000. If we asked that worker if he would accept an increase in payroll tax of $221 per year with another $221 coming from his employer in he knew that would deliver 100% of the scheduled benefit with no need to change retirement age would he take that? Is an extra three years of retirement worth $4.25 a week out of your current take home? (1.7%/2 = 0.85 x $26,000 = S221/52 = $4.25). Of course the numbers increase proportionately as you move up the income ladder but even for people earning at the cap we just are not talking that much money ($106,850 x 0.85% = $908/52 = $17.50 or double that for the self-employed).</p>
<p>This is doable, but the Northwest Plan seeks to make it even more doable with two alternative plans. One plan shows the actuarial result if you phase in this increase starting a 0.1% in 2010 and increasing it at that rate each year until 2030, then holding until 2053 where if need a trigger kicks in with gradual increases from there. This is what Coberly calls Tenth Now. The second plan would hold rates where they are until 2028 and start the increases then. This is what Coberly calls Trigger 2. The spreadsheets are fairly cryptic, you have to know how Social Security organizes its data to begin to understand them, and they are currently only partially available in Excel, instead originating in an AppleWorks format, but for those that want the early versions they are available at by emailing me at bruce.webb2 at verizon dot net. (clearly indicate subject, this is mostly my spam mail box). When we get them worked into more readible form we will get them up on the web.</p>
<p>Beyond the tax piece the Northwest Plan also addresses the question of growth. People often make the claim that &#8220;We can&#8217;t tax or grow out way out of this&#8221; but that is only true if you conflate so-called Entitlements into some hybrid SocialSecurityMedicarePartAMedicairdMedicarePartB&#038;D program. Instead all of these programs have their own challenges and their own solutions. If we examine Social Security in isolation there are not only tax based fixes but all growth based fixes. Arne I working some of this out, in the meanwhile you can see his work at <a target="_blank" href="http://adastra1960.blogspot.com/">Arne&#8217;s Blog</a></p>
<p>The Northwest Plan in combination can deliver a 100% benefit at a very reasonable price to the worker. At the very least in a democratic society ALL options should be on the table and not just the subset that most editorials offer us today. We don&#8217;t need to tie Mama to the plow, under the Tenth Now plan she and her employer just has to start paying 0.1% more per year, For the worker earning $12.50 per hour that works out to $26 in the first year, meaning just on an extra one hour of labor per year or a contribution of a buck a month. Depending on wage history it might mean working up to 20 hours more by 2030. Still not a bad tradeoff for three years of lost retirement (and even at that raising retirement age only closes about one-third of the gap.)</p>
<p>At a minimum it is worth calculating the impact of including a payroll tax base component in an overall Social Security Fix.</p>
<p>(Please feel free to check the math, we want to get this right)</p>

                                <p>by Bruce Webb</p>
<p>Over the next couple of days I&#8217;ll be rolling out what I am tentatively calling the Northwest Plan for Fixing Social Security, &#8216;Northwest&#8217; because the three current contributers happen to live in the Pacific Northwest. But before doing so I want to lay out some of the conceptual differences underlying various discussions of Social Security Crisis.</p>
<p>Everyone I think would agree that Crisis is marked by a gap between Income and Cost at various future points and intervals. But that is where agreement stops and conflict starts.</p>
<p>Social Security starts from the position that it is obligated by law to pay out benefits under the current schedule and it breaks down Income and Cost as seen in this table: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/IV_SRest.html#253691">Table IV.A3.—Operations of the Combined OASI and DI Trust Funds, Calendar Years 2003-17  [Amounts in billions]</a> In their formulation it breaks down as follows:<br />Income = Net contributions (FICA payroll tax) + Tax on Benefits + Net Interest<br />Cost= Benefits + Administration + RRB Interchange<br />Income &#8211; Cost = Net increase during year which added to year beginning  Trust Fund Balance = Total TF Assets which as of Jan 1, 2008 was $2.2 trillion.</p>
<p>In this model Income-Cost = Surplus/Deficit and indeed it is this figure that is used in Unified Budget Surplus/Deficit.  But that is just the Trustees position.</p>
<p>Others including the people at AEI look at this from a totally different direction and insist that we should properly see this in terms of Cash Flow to and from the General Fund, Under their formulation it breaks down like this:<br />Cash Income=Net contributions +Tax on Benefits<br />Cash Outlays=Benefits + Administration + RRB Interchange<br />Liabilities=Existing Trust Fund Balance plus Net Interest.</p>
<p>What was for Social Security at the end of 2007 a  $2.2 trillion asset is for AEI a $2.2 trillion liability which needs to be addressed sooner rather than later. In fact from their perspective it is even worse than that. Because if you take this &#8216;funded liability&#8217; and add it to &#8216;&#8221;unfunded obligation for past and current participant&#8221; of $15.2 trillion you end up with a &#8220;Present value of future cost less future taxes for current participants&#8221; of $17.4 trillion. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/IV_LRest.html#267012">Table IV.B7.—Present Values of OASDI Cost Less Tax Revenue and Unfunded Obligations for Program Participants[Present values as of January 1, 2008; dollar amounts in trillions]</a></p>
<p>Neither model is illegitimate in itself, it is just that the first takes the view point of the beneficiary while the second takes the viewpoint of the future taxpayer. What is the future retirees&#8217; asset, the year end Trust Fund balance, is the current taxpayers&#8217; liability. Which is where the problems start. Because the two populations only partially overlap in space and time. Some current taxpayers will receive only a small fraction of their income in retirement under Social Security. On the other hand they pay most of the income tax needed to redeem the Trust Fund. While certain future beneficiaries will rely on Social Security for most of their income in retirement and may not pay any income tax at all. And of course there is a whole range of people who fall in between.</p>
<p>Now under either model there are six possible approaches to closing the gap between income however defined and cost.<br />1. Raise the retirement age<br />2. Change the formulae for initial benefits and/or adjustment of future benefits<br />3. Raise the current payroll cap or change the formula which annually adjusts it<br />4. Exploit the long term premium of stocks over bonds by diversifying away from Special Treasuries<br />5. Raise payroll tax across the board<br />6. Target policy in ways that increase Real Wage going forward.<br />(Actually it is not as simple as this suggests, this implicitly holds the demographic assumptions steady. We could also target policy at the fertility, mortality and immigration numbers, but that only over-complicates an already complex question).</p>
<p>If as AEI does you consider the Trust Fund to be a liability whose future funding should be minimized or avoided in the interest of &#8216;sustainable solvency&#8217; then the obvious starting points are 1 &#038; 2. If you are a future retiree who will be mostly reliant on Social Security and doesn&#8217;t anticipate paying income tax in retirement 1 &#038; 2 would be your last resort. In fact since from this standpoint &#8216;crisis&#8217; is defined as a benefit cut in 2041 1 &#038; 2 might add up to a cure that is worse than the disease, and particularly if like me you don&#8217;t have any solid plans to be around after 2041.</p>
<p>So when evaluating any Social Security &#8216;Reform&#8217; plan it is important to see what they are fixing, are they looking out for the interest of the future beneficiary? Or just the future taxpayer? And which taxpayer? The worker making under the median or the taxpayer who earns their income from gains on capital? </p>
<p>Cui bono? Cui poena? Those are the questions we should be starting with.</p>

<p>The 2009 Report of the Trustees of Social Security will be released late in the afternoon on Tuesday the 12th. Reports from all years are available starting from this page <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/index.html">Reports from the Board of Trustees</a> or you can view the HTML, download the PDF, or order a paper copy of the new Report directly from this page <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/index.html">The 2009 OASDI Trustees Report</a> (link will not work until Report is actually released). There will also be a new post here and at BruceWeb.blogspot.com giving some breakdowns followed up by new numbers.</p>
<p>Why is this important? Didn&#8217;t all this get settled in 2005? Au contraire mon frere, instead the enemies of Social Security are gearing up for one last run at it. In this case they are mounting a campaign to form a &#8216;bi-partisan&#8217; entitlements commission that would present an up or down plan to Congress. Which would be reasonable enough if there was proposed to be a free and open debate with all options on the table. That is not the plan, instead they want to stuff the commission with people pre-committed to a program of benefit cuts and retirement age increases, any idea of addressing this through phased in tax increases or simply taking a tack of &#8216;wait and see&#8217; (the &#8220;Nothing&#8221; Plan) not even being on the table.</p>
<p>The plan for a bi-partisan commission is being pushed hard from the outside by various entities connected to Peter G. Peterson (see the discussion in this William Grieder cover story for the Nation <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thenation.com/doc/20090302/greider">Looting Social Security</a>) and is represented in Congress by two pieces of proposed legislation. The Senate version is called <a target="_blank" href="http://budget.senate.gov/democratic/statements/2007/bipartisantaskforcerelease091807.pdf">Conrad-Gregg</a> for short and was introduced by the Senators in a Sept 2007 Op-Ed <a target="_blank" href="http://thehill.com/op-eds/a-bipartisan-approach-to-americas-greatest-fiscal-challenge-2007-09-26.html">A bipartisan approach to America’s greatest fiscal challenge</a>. They describe the plan as follows:<br />
<blockquote>We believe the solution lies in a balanced, bipartisan approach. Therefore, we have come together to offer the Bipartisan Task Force for Responsible Fiscal Action Act. This task force, made up equally of Democrats and Republicans, will be charged with authoring bipartisan legislation to immediately begin addressing the nation’s fiscal challenges. Everything will be on the table. This will not be another commission mulling over ideas that will be filed away, and it won’t be under the control of one political party or the other. It is designed to produce legislative solutions that Congress must vote on, not just bury in political debate.</p>
<p>Here’s how it will work: The bill establishes a 16-member task force that is comprised of four congressional members each chosen by the Senate majority leader and House Speaker; three congressional members each chosen by the Senate and House Minority Leaders; and two administration members, one chosen by the president and the other being the Secretary of the Treasury, who will serve as task force chairperson.</p></blockquote>
<p>Though unstated the recommendation of this Commission will be presented to Congress on an up or down basis on the model established by BRAC, the Base Realignment and Closing Commission. We can assume that all six Republicans will be committed to benefit cuts, and that by nature the two Democratic sponsors (Conrad from the Senate and Cooper from the House) will be seated then with Administration buy-in the &#8216;reformers&#8217; start with a ten vote majority and only need Reid and Pelosi to add in a combination of two &#8216;sensible&#8217; &#8216;moderates&#8217; to make this a foregone conclusion.</p>
<p>The corresponding version on the House side is called the <a target="__blank" href="http://www.cooper.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&#038;task=view&#038;id=239&#038;Itemid=73">Cooper-Wolf SAFE COMMISSION LONG-TERM FISCAL REFORM BILL</a> described by Cooper as follows:<br />
<blockquote>The Securing America’s Future Economy (SAFE) Commission Act would create a 16-member panel comprised of the White House OMB Director and Treasury Secretary; four members appointed by the Senate Majority Leader and four appointed by the Speaker of the House; three appointed by the House Minority Leader and three appointed by the Senate Minority Leader. No more than four Members of Congress could sit on the commission. It would be tasked with holding town hall meetings around the country and then submitting a report that balances long-term spending and revenue scenarios for the nation. If Congressional leaders fail to introduce their own proposal, the SAFE Commission’s legislative proposal is automatically brought to the House floor. If passed, it is sent to the Senate for similarly expedited consideration.</p></blockquote>
<p> This plan is very similar to Conrad-Gregg except that it limits Congressional participation to four members of Congress who quite naturally would be named Conrad, Gregg, Cooper and Wolf. Meaning that if the Peterson folk can get two out of the six outside Democratic seats they are home free. And you bet there will be a push to get participation from some of these &#8216;bi-partisan&#8217; groups. Because what could be more bi-partisan than a group effort by Brookings and AEI? Look at all the sensible moderates authoring the following: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.concordcoalition.org/files/uploaded_for_nodes/Taking_Back_Our_Fiscal_Future.pdf">Taking Back our Fiscal Future</a> We got Will Marshal! and Alice Rivlin! But look at how they describe the challenge and the solution.<br />
<blockquote>• Unsustainable deficits in the federal budget threaten the health and vigor of the American economy.  <br />• The first step toward establishing budget responsibility is to reform the budget decision process so that the major drivers of escalating deficits—Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid—are no longer on autopilot. </p></blockquote>
<p>Read through the entire document, there is not a hint that those deficits were also driven by out of control defense spending or tax cuts for the wealthy, as with every single Peterson backed call for fiscal responsibility the solution allways starts and stops with &#8216;entitlements&#8217;. And for those who say &#8216;Wait neither Brookings or AEI is a Peterson production&#8217;, not that this document is hosted at Concord which was founded and to all accounts still ultimately controlled by Peterson.</p>
<p>Some more links: AEI <a target="_blank" href="http://www.american.com/archive/2009/a-first-step-toward-fiscal-responsibility">A First Step Toward Fiscal Responsibility</a> Which step would be? Why a Bi-Partisan Commission! This one evenly split between Republicans and Democrats, meaning of course that Blue Dogs control the outcome. Or you could just explore the links at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bipartisancommission.com/Resources.html">The Bipartisan Commission: a bipartisan way to solve our nation&#8217;s  financial challenges</a> and what are those challenges?<br />
<blockquote>The following are some useful websites which provide additional information concerning the fiscal problems that the federal government faces concerning entitlement spending on Medicare and Social Security as well as possible solutions, including the establishment of a bipartisan commission to find solutions for these problems. </p></blockquote>
<p> And among those &#8216;useful websites&#8217;? Hmm, the Concord Coalition and the Peter G. Peterson Foundation.</p>
<p>They say even paranoids have real enemies, and if Social Security was personified it would be twitching madly ever time it looked over its shoulder and saw a representative of PGP. Which in this case includes Conrad, Gregg, Cooper and Wolf.</p>
<p>So it is not just a Report release, it is the opening shot in what will hopefully be the last Battle to Kill Social Security. They set the stage with &#8216;Vanishing Surplus&#8217;, you can bet they are going to try to ram the results of the Report right down our throats. And given that there are reliable reports that SSA is still stuffed with Bush embeds (up until a week ago there were no official Obama photos hanging in the SSA offices and some higher-ups are resisting that even now) a little vigilance is in order.</p>

<p>These figures show graphically what the recession has done to Social Security&#8217;s medium term outlook. Answer? Not much.. A near term dip in income is never fully recovered in dollar terms.  A DI  &#8216;Primary Surplus&#8217; heading for zero got there a little faster. Does any of this add up to rushing to form a Bi-Partisan Commission? I don&#8217;t think so.<br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SgHLl4pXI9I/AAAAAAAAAMI/49qNEffAxMc/s1600-h/SSABPresentation.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SgHLl4pXI9I/AAAAAAAAAMI/49qNEffAxMc/s400/SSABPresentation.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SgHORD48lAI/AAAAAAAAAMQ/MN7FBgysvbc/s1600-h/SSABPresentation2.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SgHORD48lAI/AAAAAAAAAMQ/MN7FBgysvbc/s400/SSABPresentation2.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SgHORRWoxWI/AAAAAAAAAMY/CoqnEA51NNs/s1600-h/SSABPresentation3.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SgHORRWoxWI/AAAAAAAAAMY/CoqnEA51NNs/s400/SSABPresentation3.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SgHORWsRlqI/AAAAAAAAAMg/ScEmCzdxCS4/s1600-h/SSABPresentation4.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SgHORWsRlqI/AAAAAAAAAMg/ScEmCzdxCS4/s400/SSABPresentation4.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/101xx/doc10100/SSABPresentation.pdf">CBO Presentation to SSAB</a> (note there is no associated text-this link included for reference)</p>

<p>(Update 2 : Deleted Update 1.)</p>
<p>Currently there is a lot of discussion about forming a new bipartisan Entitlements Commission modeled in part on the &#8216;Greenspan Commission&#8217; of 1981-82 and partly on the Base ReAlignment Commission (BRAC). The idea is that you get people to agree on &#8216;Crisis&#8217;, then get a &#8216;bipartisan&#8217; group together to present an up or down &#8216;compromise&#8217; proposal to Congress. I put &#8216;bipartisan&#8217; and &#8216;compromise&#8217; in quotes because this idea is being pushed by a combination of Conservative Republicans and Blue Dog Democrats who have predetermined the outcome. A group I belong to is preparing some major push-back, and when the lead authors get the material together it certainly will be plugged here. But in the meantime I invite those interested in this to actually revisit the results of the previous Commission.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/history/reports/gspan.html">REPORT OF THE NATIONAL COMMISSION ON<br />SOCIAL SECURITY REFORM JANUARY 1983</a>. </p>
<p>The guts of the Report are found here:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/history/reports/gspan5.html">Chapter 2: FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS</a></p>
<p>While the meat is found here: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/history/reports/gs18tab.html">Appendix K- List of Tables</a> This is extracted from the broader <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/history/reports/gspan18.html">Actuarial Cost Estimates for OASDI and HI and for Various Possible Changes in OASDI and Historical Data for OASDI and HI</a></p>
<p>Some selected tables and commentary below the fold.</p>
<p>The first Table is from Chapter 2 and shows the mix of recommendations. Note that .58% of payroll is punted to Congress, the rest of this was what they could get from a consensus vote. Even then the final vote on the Report was 12-3.<br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SfN_GebYSrI/AAAAAAAAALw/sBjlzJACEhk/s1600-h/Grnsp+Table+A+(first+part).jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SfN_GebYSrI/AAAAAAAAALw/sBjlzJACEhk/s400/Grnsp+Table+A+(first+part).jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SfN_GfTC0II/AAAAAAAAALo/SoxeXZk-PoA/s1600-h/Grnsp+Table+A+(2nd+part).jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SfN_GfTC0II/AAAAAAAAALo/SoxeXZk-PoA/s400/Grnsp+Table+A+(2nd+part).jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />Now the result translated into numbers:<br />I am only showing the results for Alternative II-A which is the more optimistic of the two Intermediate Cost projections, for II-B you will have to click through. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/history/reports/k7a.html">Table 7-A: Cost rates</a><br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SfN_GrWc2oI/AAAAAAAAAMA/pqx8uL-5ftc/s1600-h/Grnsp+Table+K7-A.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SfN_GrWc2oI/AAAAAAAAAMA/pqx8uL-5ftc/s400/Grnsp+Table+K7-A.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Now the same data expressed in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/history/reports/k8.html">Trust Fund Ratios by Alternative</a><br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SfN_GvmUzKI/AAAAAAAAAL4/AaxAdqP1mrE/s1600-h/Grspn+Table+K8.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SfN_GvmUzKI/AAAAAAAAAL4/AaxAdqP1mrE/s400/Grspn+Table+K8.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>A close look shows that the Commission didn&#8217;t really think they had fixed OAS even in the short run. And while their numbers show OAS (that is the actual retirement component) running surpluses in the medium term they still foresaw it running to Depletion in 2027.</p>
<p>As I have said before this would be a pretty sad and ineffective kind of &#8216;Prefunding Boomer Retirement&#8217;. Why is combined TF Depletion now set for 2041? Because the economy actually came in somewhat better than II-A and closer to I (which is now called Low Cost). But that wasn&#8217;t part of the master plan</p>
<p>Some additional perspective from the Commission&#8217;s Executive Director can be found in this Oral History of Robert Myers. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/history/myersorl.html">Oral History of Robert Myers</a></p>

<p>Last month we were delivered alarming news from AEI: <a target="_blank" href="http://andrewgbiggs.blogspot.com/2009/03/slowdown-slashes-social-security.html">Slowdown Slashes Social Security Surplus</a> illustrated with the table above in turn derived from this source <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/ProgData/allOps.html">SSA-Trust Fund Data</a>. And sure enough if you followed the link and inserted Feb 2009 that is exactly what you would see. But what if you put it into series and included the months Dec to March? Well you get the following.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SfIQ_mbUSmI/AAAAAAAAALY/NjmozmWbZHc/s1600-h/Trust+Fund+Data+March+2009.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SfIQ_mbUSmI/AAAAAAAAALY/NjmozmWbZHc/s400/Trust+Fund+Data+March+2009.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SfIQ_c0MGWI/AAAAAAAAALQ/k53CRkVEsuc/s1600-h/Trust+Fund+Data+Feb+2009.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SfIQ_c0MGWI/AAAAAAAAALQ/k53CRkVEsuc/s400/Trust+Fund+Data+Feb+2009.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SfIQ_TSSu3I/AAAAAAAAALI/_vWPqScx-60/s1600-h/Trust+Fund+Data+Jan+2009.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SfIQ_TSSu3I/AAAAAAAAALI/_vWPqScx-60/s400/Trust+Fund+Data+Jan+2009.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SfIQ_EuD2wI/AAAAAAAAALA/tt2XQY_wFOs/s1600-h/Trust+Fund+Data+Dec+2008.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SfIQ_EuD2wI/AAAAAAAAALA/tt2XQY_wFOs/s400/Trust+Fund+Data+Dec+2008.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>First thing of note. The combined surplus returned in March. While DI continued to run a deficit OAS ran more than enough surplus to cover it. It looks like February may have fell victim to the fact that it has three fewer workdays which for people who work hourly that much less in FICA taxes. On the other hand benefits are paid monthly in equal amounts. Which suggests that February will always be a poorly performing month.</p>
<p>Now move to January and compare it to February. Note anything different? Well the fact that revenue from taxation on benefits was only $13 Million in Feb as opposed to $6001 million in January maybe, mighta made the difference.</p>
<p>Finally we can check out December. Interest on investments in Feb was $92 million, in January only $25 million, while in December it was a whopping $58 BILLION (yes with a &#8216;B&#8217;).</p>
<p>So what happens when you pick a month that one-has a smaller FICA stream due to fewer work days, two-doesn&#8217;t get a big infusion from tax on benefits like January did, and three-did not get a huge infusion from accrued interest like December did? You get a mediocre to negative result in that month relative to other months.</p>
<p>Which leaves one last question. Are the guys from AEI incompetent? Or just skilled cherry pickers?</p>

                                <p>by Bruce Webb</p>
<p>Commenter and  blogger Arne (whose largely SS Blog is found <a target="_blank" href="http://adastra1960.blogspot.com/">here</a>) asked in comments whether it was time to move beyond &#8220;Nothing&#8221; and propose to policy makers some alternative plans to address future discontinuities. Which is a very sensible question, because if and when the Social Security Trust Funds (DI and then later OAS) approach depletion, we have to do &#8220;Something&#8221;. Because as former Deputy Commissioner of SS Biggs helpfully explained it turns out that current law does not allow the Commissioner of SS to either unilaterally change benefit levels, nor does he have the legal authority to borrow. Which means that the combined 22% cut in benefits in 2041 (SSA) would show up as delayed checks for Disabled beneficiaries as DI goes deplete around 2019 (CBO) and for OAS beneficiaries around 2049 (CBO). In all likelihood &#8220;Something&#8221; will have to be done whether that be the plan advanced by Arne, the quite similar plan advanced by <a target="_blank" href="http://bruceweb.blogspot.com/2009/02/coberly-on-social-security-at-angry.html">Coberly</a>, or several varieties of my plan, or <a target="_blank" href="http://www.brookings.edu/views/papers/orszag/200504security.pdf">Diamond-Orszag</a>, or <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hks.harvard.edu/jeffreyliebman/lms_nonpartisan_plan_description.pdf">Liebman-MacGuineas-Samwick</a> or any other plan people might like to suggest.</p>
<p>But my answer to Arne&#8217;s question is &#8220;Not yet&#8221;. To understand why we have to consider what &#8220;bi-partisan compromise&#8221; on Social Security has meant in the recent past and today. Links and discussion below the fold.</p>
<p>I take as our starting place President Bush&#8217;s 2001 <a target="_blank" href="http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/csss/index.htm">Commission to Strengthen Social Security</a>. The Commission&#8217;s web-site lays out its task as follows (bolding mine): <br />
<blockquote>On May 2, President Bush announced establishment of a bipartisan, 16-member Commission &#8220;to study and report … specific recommendations to preserve Social Security for seniors while building wealth for younger Americans.&#8221;<br />Guiding Principles<br />The Commission was asked to make recommendations to modernize and restore fiscal soundness to Social Security, using six guiding principles:</p>
<p>Modernization must not change Social Security benefits for retirees or near-retirees.<br />The entire Social Security surplus must be dedicated only to Social Security.<br />Social Security payroll taxes must not be increased.<br />The government must not invest Social Security funds in the stock market.<br />Modernization must preserve Social Security`s disability and survivors insurance programs.<br />Modernization must include individually controlled, voluntary personal retirement accounts, which will augment Social Security.</p></blockquote>
<p>Meaning that &#8216;bi-partisan&#8217; in context means &#8216;Democrats who agree in advance on a no-tax/PRA solution&#8217;. Which in turn means that none of Coberly&#8217;s, Arne&#8217;s, mine, or even D-O or LMS plans would meet the initial cut, all of whom include or are open to some increase in payroll tax and only LMS explicitly including PRA&#8217;s. When Bush in 2004 and 2005 claimed &#8216;all options are on the table&#8217; he really meant &#8216;all options bracketed by the three models included in the CSSS Final Report <a target="_blank" href="http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/csss/reports/Final_report.pdf">Strengthening Social Security and Creating Personal Wealth for All Americans</a>&#8216;. Meaning that &#8216;dialogue&#8217; was implicitly defined as &#8216;after first capitulating to my principles&#8217;.</p>
<p>Which is why &#8220;Nothing&#8221; remained my preferred plan right through to January 20th, 2009, there was no way the Bush Administration would agree to any &#8220;Something&#8221; I would accept. Indeed their starting position required rejecting a plan co-written by a top Bush administration economist whose portfolio included Social Security (Samwick of LMS). On my analysis LMS is a horribly worker-unfriendly plan that shifts most burdens for &#8216;fixing&#8217; Social Security &#8216;crisis&#8217; from capital entirely to wage workers and doesn&#8217;t &#8216;fix&#8217; the &#8216;crisis&#8217; as normally framed: benefit cuts at depletion in 2041 (SSA). LMS compromises on Bush&#8217;s six principles by proposing taxes on wage workers and wage workers only. To describe it as the authors do as a &#8220;bi-partisan compromise&#8221; is from a progressive standpoint ludicrous:<br />
<blockquote>The three of us – former aides to President Clinton, Senator McCain, and President Bush – did an experiment to see if we could develop a reform plan that we could all support. The Liebman-MacGuineas-Samwick (LMS) plan demonstrates the types of compromises that can help policy makers from across the political spectrum agree on a Social Security reform plan.</p></blockquote>
<p> But all of those &#8216;compromises&#8217; end up being in the form of worker concessions, and almost all the benefits ultimately flow to capital. As I put this is post no. 5 in my AB SS series (May 12, 2008 <a target="_blank" href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/05/bw-on-soc-sec-vi-lms-and-infinite.html">LMS and the Infinite Future</a><br />
<blockquote>Which is well and good except that in this case &#8216;spectrum&#8217; seems to span everything from (barely) left-center to right. This is bipartisan in the Lieberman sense, lets agree to slightly moderate a conservative position and call it good. Second coming of FDR it decidedly isn&#8217;t. But back to the authors. Prof Jeffrey Liebman (of Harvard&#8217;s Kennedy School of Government) is particularly interesting in that as well as being a former Clintonista he is currently one of the top three economists on Obama&#8217;s economic team. When Social Security policy is being discussed in what I hope is an Obama Administration he is more than likely to be sitting at the table, something I view with a certain unease.</p></blockquote>
<p>An unease I maintain today eleventh months later. Barkley Rosser advised me to discount Liebman on the basis that the real danger to Social Security is coming from Larry Summers. Which may be, on the other hand Liebman subsequent to that advice from Barkley landed as one of Orzsag&#8217;s top level deputies as the Executive Associate Director at OMB. Indeed while the OMB org chart show the Executive Associate Director at the same level as the four regular Associate Directors the language of the Press Release shows him to be maybe the First among Equals<br />
<blockquote>Today, President-elect Barack Obama announced the following key posts at the Office of Management and Budget (OMB): Jeffrey Liebman, Executive Associate Director; Steve Kosiak, Associate Director for Defense and International Affairs; Robert Gordon, Associate Director for Education, Income Maintenance and Labor; Xavier de Souza Briggs, Associate Director for General Government Programs; Preeta Bansal, OMB General Counsel and Senior Policy Advisor; and Kenneth Baer, Associate Director for Communications and Strategic Planning.</p></blockquote>
<p> Which is why I am not yet ready to abandon my current policy preference of &#8220;Nothing&#8221; at least for any purposes outside the confines of the Econoblogs at least not yet. As it is we have the co-author of a not-so-bad Social Security plan (Diamond-Orzsag) at the OMB and the co-author of an awful SS plan (Liebman of LMS) serving as his deputy, and no clear defender of traditional SS in the Administration except Jared Bernstein and maybe Jason Furman. Against that we have calls from Hassett and Biggs at AEI and their apparent stenographers Montgomery and Hiatt at the WaPo insisting that the answer to to agree to a &#8216;bi-partisan commission&#8217;. </p>
<p>HIatt made the case as follows: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/04/10/AR2009041002155.html">Fixing the Budget In the Worst (But Only) Way</a><br />
<blockquote>But in the department of doggedness, nobody can outdo Wolf, a Republican who has represented parts of Northern Virginia for 28 years. For the past several years, what he has been most persistent about is the need for a bipartisan commission to stave off looming fiscal disaster. He introduces legislation, writes letters, makes calls. Above all he pleads his case: Nothing else is going to work.</p>
<p>For just as long, I&#8217;ve been reluctant to admit that Wolf might be right. There are two big problems with the type of commission he&#8217;s proposing, which would present Congress with one take-it-or-leave-it grand solution. It can produce lowest-common-denominator-type answers. And it makes sense only if you&#8217;re willing to admit that the regular political system cannot do what it is supposed to do. Which, lately, has been seeming like a safer and safer bet.</p>
<p>The model for the Wolf idea is the method Congress has used to close military bases since 1988. Recognizing that the Pentagon operated too many facilities but that no legislator would vote to close a base in his or her own district, Congress set up a Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission (BRAC), which came up with a rational downsizing plan. Congress had to vote for the whole list or nothing at all; there could be no special pleading.</p></blockquote>
<p>Why is the regular political system not functioning? Could it have anything to do with the fact that Republicans have united in opposition to any plan of Obama&#8217;s that spends any money on domestic programs in favor of a solution that freezes all domestic programs across the board, claims that a $34 billion in increased defence spending equates to &#8216;slashing&#8217; that budget and proposes that the answer is just to agree on abolishing corporate taxes and continuing lower taxes on the wealthy? Well no, it is Obama&#8217;s refusal to adopt Bushonomic economic policy that worked so marvelously up to now. Which is how the Washington Post defines &#8216;bi-partisanship&#8217;. What is Hiatt&#8217;s preferred solution for breaking this deadlock? Simple. We just sign on to Wolf&#8217;s proposal.<br />
<blockquote>Now comes the movement to bring the rationale behind BRAC to the budget. Wolf&#8217;s bill is co-sponsored by Rep. Jim Cooper (D-Tenn.); comparable legislation in the Senate is backed by the chairman and the ranking minority member of the Budget Committee, Kent Conrad (D-N.D.) and Judd Gregg (R-N.H.). The idea got a boost 10 days ago from another panel of Wise Men (and a couple of Wise Women) in a report called <a target="http://www.thepresidency.org/pubs/Saving_Americas_Future_report.pdf">Saving America&#8217;s Future</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;In light of the demonstrated inability of the existing political process&#8221; to address the country&#8217;s fiscal problems, the panel said, Congress should create a Fiscal Future Commission modeled on, yes, BRAC. The authors include a former NATO ambassador, David Abshire; a former Lockheed Martin CEO, Norman Augustine; a Democratic former governor, Roy Romer; former attorney general Edwin Meese; former senators Sam Nunn and Chuck Hagel; and many more.</p>
<p>The idea makes most sense for something like saving Social Security, <i>where there&#8217;s a large consensus at the political center on what needs to be done</i> (change the inflation index for benefits a bit, raise the age limit a bit, tax income at a slightly higher level) but no political will to do it. But the Fiscal Future Commission would fix not only all entitlement programs but also &#8220;reorient government spending programs and tax preferences.&#8221; And it would do so &#8220;free of the pressure and influence of interest groups and partisan elements.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p> Taking the last point first, lets take a look at the names of those &#8216;Wise Men (and Women). <a target="_blank" href="http://bruceweb.blogspot.com/2009/04/fred-hiatts-wise-men.html">Fred Hiatt&#8217;s Wise Men</a>. Short version: four generals and admirals, a handful of retired Congressional defense hawks,  a former Secty of the Army, six former Republican cabinet level officials, two college Presidents with strong ties to Wall Street, plus for the heck of it a civil liberties defending Obama supporter. But basically a group that ranges all the way from the Center to the right. Oh and yes a certain <a target="_blank" href="http://bruceweb.blogspot.com/2009/04/fred-hiatts-wise-men.html">C. Fred Bergsten</a>. Who&#8217;s he? &#8220;C. Fred Bergsten has been director of the Peterson Institute for International Economics since its creation in 1981.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yep nothing like loading up your lineup with a bunch of defense hawks and Bush cabinet members and a Pete G. Peterson guy to get you free from &#8220;the pressure and influence of interest groups and partisan element&#8221;. This is just another case of Peterson trying to make a move.</p>
<p>Then note that Hiatt presents us with a solution that could have been (and likely was) written by Pete G. himself and presents it as a &#8220;large consensus at the political center&#8221;.</p>
<p>So the answer to Budget &#8216;crisis&#8217; is to propose a compromise on bi-partisan lines between Obama top level officials open to  SS benefit cuts (e.g. Orszag and Liebman) and Congressional conservative Republicans (Gregg) and Blue Dog Democrats (Cooper and Conrad) who agree that Social Security is unsustainable with backing from a Pete G. Peterson front group masquerading as the Sensible Centrist Wise Men and so form a &#8220;Bi-Partisan Commission&#8221; to present an &#8220;Up or Down&#8221; solution on the BRAC model. Well no thanks, not only am I not willing to get fooled again, I wasn&#8217;t much fooled the first few times around.</p>
<p>Meaning I am not yet ready to move off a position of &#8220;Nothing&#8221;. Not at least until we get to the point of being able to lift the rock of Social Security &#8216;reform&#8217; via a Fiscal Future Commission  without finding Pete G. Peterson or his minions scurrying around trying to undermine Social Security.</p>
<p>We can and should debate the merits of various Social Security plans, whether that be D-O or LMS or Arne&#8217;s. But let us not fool ourselves that the current environment supports a true &#8216;Bi-Partisan Commission on Social Security&#8217; that would allow Arne&#8217;s or Coberly&#8217;s or certainly my plans to be debated in good faith. Because the sellers of crisis led by Cato, AEI, Concord and the various PGP organizations have sold all Republicans and most if not all of the Blue Dog and DLC Democrats on the notion that &#8220;Something has to be done, and sooner better than later, about Social Security&#8221;. &#8220;Nothing&#8221; is not a perfect plan but currently is a hell of a lot better than all the &#8220;Somethings&#8221; actually out there in the policy arena.</p>
<p>It is often said that the &#8220;Best Defense is a Good Offense&#8221;. Well not always, not if you are leaving a secure position and running right up hill in the face of the guns, you can ask how that worked for General Pickett at Cemetary Ridge or for  Lord Cardigan at Balaclava, and that even though the opposition was fighting according to the rules, something that really can&#8217;t be said to be happening in the continuing seventy plus guerilla war to kill Social Security using all necessary means.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know of a single Democratic policy maker on either the Congressional or Administration side that has openly come out and embraced a Social Security solution that relies on some combination of taxes and targeted growth policy that would deliver a Coberly or Arne outcome of fully funded benfits without abandonment of the current insurance model. At best we have plans that attempt to address the projected gap in a purportedly progressive way via a cap increase. Until we can get people to understand that &#8220;Nothing&#8221; is better than the existing proposed &#8220;Somethings&#8221; then I am a little hesitant to open a door to those who reject &#8220;Nothing&#8221; out of hand, and whose starting position is just as hard as Bush&#8217;s insistence that PRAs and no taxes have to be included in the governing guidelines. The other side of this has consistently asserted that we have to fight this fight on their conceptual ground under their rules of engagement which ALWAYS start from a presumption of benefit cuts as the &#8216;sensible centrist&#8217; thing to do. I am not willing to accept that as a point of departure.</p>
<p>In the current environment &#8216;Bi-partisanship&#8217; equates to &#8216;We are all Blue Dogs now!&#8217;. Well no, this Yellow Dog Democrat may vote for a Blue Dog in the interest of a Democratic majority if given no other choice. But I have no intent of changing coats and just turning my back on the New Deal in the ways the Blues demand.</p>
