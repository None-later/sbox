<p>SOCIAL SECURITY AIN&#8217;T BROKE</p>
<p>A Reply to Linda Beale</p>
<p>I want to take advantage of Linda Beale&#8217;s essay &#8220;Social Security: It Ain&#8217;t Broke Unless China is too&#8221; to make some points of my own.  I want to be clear at the outset that I am grateful to Linda for her essay.  She is essentially right.  My comments are secondary.  It&#8217;s not a case of my disagreeing with Linda, but of having something to say that I hope will help people understand the Social Security &#8220;question&#8221; a little better.  </p>
<p>I am going to assume the reader has Linda&#8217;s essay in front of him.</p>
<p>First, I don&#8217;t agree with Krugman: you CANNOT think of Social Security as &#8220;part of the budget.&#8221;  I don&#8217;t know how the government talks to itself about this,  but they sure went to a lot of effort to segregate Social Security funds from the budget with a payroll tax and a Trust Fund. . You don&#8217;t have a &#8220;trust fund&#8221; if the money is fungible.</p>
<p>We once had a reader at Angry Bear point to a CBO &#8220;paper&#8221; that said because SS funds come into the Treasury like other taxes, they cannot be regarded as separate from those other taxes. The money is not &#8220;marked&#8221; so you can tell SS money from other money.  This is a lie.  The government is quite capable of keeping track of where the money comes from and where it is dedicated by law to go.  So be warned, there are experts, even in the heart of CBO who are quite willing to lie to you if they think they can get away with it.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />Second,  i don&#8217;t like the usage  &#8220;workers pay&#8230; to support [past workers, current retirees] who paid into it in the past.&#8221;   While this is technically true,  it is misleading.  Those current retirees DID pay into SS in the past.  They paid for their own benefits.  Pay as you go is merely the very clever way the first cohort&#8217;s payments are protected from inflation, and earn interest, without being exposed to the risks of the market, so they can be returned to the taxpayer in time to help pay for his retirement.  It is critical that people understand that the workers pay for their own benefits.  It is NOT &#8220;the young paying for the old.&#8221;   When they figure your benefits, they look at what YOU paid in, not what your son is paying in.</p>
<p>Like a lot of things in life, both ideas are true here.  We are paying for the older generation, just as the next generation will pay for us. But at the same time we are paying directly for ourself.  The money we pay is recorded against our name.  Just like in a bank account.</p>
<p>Third , you&#8217;ll get some disagreement  about when the Trust Fund was created and what for.  Beale is essentially right about the present Trust Fund being created to allow the boomers to pay in advance for the part of their own retirement benefits that would be needed in excess of normal pay as you go. The trust fund was there at the beginning as a simple way to buffer income against outgo, both for normal monthly ebbs and flows, and for the occasional recession when taxes collected would fall short of benefits &#8220;promised.&#8221;  But the &#8217;83 Social Security Commission knew the boomer retirement was coming, and the tax rate they set at that time &#8220;just happened&#8221; to result in a Trust Fund large enough to bridge the boomer retirement. This is the point we have reached today.  A long expected point, in spite of the liars screaming that SS has gone &#8220;cash flow negative.&#8221;  SS has not gone &#8220;negative.&#8221;  It&#8217;s cash flow includes interest, and eventually principle, from the savings it generated exactly for this purpose.</p>
<p>Fourth, I don&#8217;t agree with Beale that there is NO &#8220;problem.&#8221;  The Trust Fund is not the problem.  The problem is that as people live longer, they will need to devote a higher percent of their earnings to their retirement.. OR not retire as young, OR live on less when they do.  I don&#8217;t think any sane person would choose options 2 and 3 when option 1 is so cheap.  But it IS a &#8220;problem,&#8221;  a very small one once it is understood, which is why the bad guys work so very hard to prevent your understanding it.  You, the young, can insure your own future retirement  with no increase in retirement age or cut in monthly benefits simply by raising your own tax&#8230; really your own savings rate&#8230; one half of one tenth of one percent per year,  or about forty cents per week in today&#8217;s terms.  This is an enormously better solution than not letting people retire when they are old, or cutting their benefits below survival levels, or taxing the rich and turning Social Security into welfare as we knew it.</p>
<p>Fifth.. the Trust Fund treasuries will indeed run out some time around 2030 or 40 or 50.  It is a fatal argument to tell people don&#8217;t worry be happy.  Even &#8220;the young&#8221; can see that they will be taking a benefit cut when they retire if nothing is done.  Their problem is they don&#8217;t know they can avoid the benefit cut by raising their own &#8220;tax&#8221; by an amount so small they would not even notice it.  </p>
<p>Default or not Default is not the question.  Default would just move up the day when the tax needs to be raised, but would make no real difference in justice to anyone.  And the lying bastards won&#8217;t default in a way you could bring them to court for.  They will just cut benefits one way or another so the TF does not have to be paid back in a time inconvenient to themselves.  They CAN do that.  And that is the extent to which Uncle Sam borrowing from himself IS a problem.  But it is not the problem that the liars say it is.  Uncle Sam will have no problem finding the money. In fact, i don&#8217;t think the liars really care about the money. What they really want to do is destroy Social Security. They hate it because they hate the idea of &#8220;the help&#8221; being idle.  They can&#8217;t imagine you might think you have something more important to do with your golden years than work for them.</p>
<p>Sixth..  The liars claim that the iou&#8217;s are meaningless is based on their idea that the government has to tax the people to find the money to pay the people.  This is a confusion &#8230; we are not all the same person&#8230;  but it is one they probably sincerely believe, and it isn&#8217;t helpful (to them) for us to miss the point. It needs to be explained. The money is owed to the people who paid their payroll tax on the understanding that it would be used to pay for their retirement.  It will be paid by people who did not pay that payroll tax, and who presumably benefitted by borrowing the money.  They will not be paying twice for their Social Security.  They will be paying for the first time for what their government bought with the money they borrowed FROM Social Security.  The rich know that it is THEY who will be taxed to pay back the money they borrowed from Social Security.  And they are just short sighted enough to stop thinking right there, especially as they can rationalize that the money was borrowed not by them but by &#8220;the government&#8221;  whoever that is. But since they hate the government, they can pretend they have no obligation to pay it&#8217;s bills just by pretending they got no benefit from spending the money.</p>
<p>Again, I want to think Linda for her essay, and I hope this helps.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve noted in these postings the growing inequality between rich and the rest of us in America, and that is the appropriate backdrop against which to investigate further the right&#8217;s smoke-and-mirrors scams about tax policy and earned benefits.  Let me remind you with Kevin Drum&#8217;s Mother Jones article on <a href="http://motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2011/10/price-plutocracy-0">The Price of Plutocracy</a>: &#8220;<strong><em>For all practical purposes, every year about $700 billion in income is being sucked directly out of the hands of the poor and the middle class and shoveled into the hands of the rich</em>.</strong>&#8221; (That sentence is illustrated with a great chart, with data drawn from Joseph Hacker of Yale and Paul Pierson of Berkeley, the authors of Winner-Take-All Politics, a book I highly recommend.)</p>
<p>The national debate about deficits has been part of a relentless push by the right to reduce as much as possible the New Deal earned benefit programs of Social Security and Medicare. The right twists the facts to suit the arguments it wants to make.  Krugman hones in on this issue, noting Dean Baker&#8217;s similar anger at the Washington Post&#8217;s inconsistency in considering Social Security in a recent article by Post writer Lori Montgomery, who seems to be miming for the hard right, anti-New Deal crowd in Washington .  See Krugman, <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/30/social-security-bait-and-switch-a-continuing-series/">Social Security, Bait and Switch, a Continuing Series</a>, New York Times (Oct. 30, 2011).</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Social Security is a program that is part of the federal budget, but is by law supported by a dedicated source of revenue. This means that there are two ways to look at the program’s finances: in legal terms, or as part of the broader budget picture.</em></p>
<p> <a name="more"></a>
<p><em>In legal terms, the program is funded not just by today’s payroll taxes, but by accumulated past surpluses — the trust fund. If there’s a year when payroll receipts fall short of benefits, but there are still trillions of dollars in the trust fund, what happens is, precisely, nothing — the program has the funds it needs to operate, without need for any Congressional action.</em></p>
<p><em>Alternatively, you can think about Social Security as just part of the federal budget. But in that case, it’s just part of the federal budget; it doesn’t have either surpluses or deficits, no more than the defense budget.</em></p>
<p><em>Both views are valid, depending on what questions you’re trying to answer.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>What you can’t do is insist that the trust fund is meaningless, because SS is just part of the budget, then claim that some crisis arises when receipts fall short of payments, because SS is a standalone program</em>.</strong>  Id. (emphasis added).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Further, the right refers to these programs as &#8220;entitlements&#8221;, a term that is meant to dredge up resentments against those who have some rights to benefits from these programs.  The right uses &#8220;personal responsibility&#8221; and &#8220;entitlements&#8221; as though they refer to two non-intersecting worlds, whereas in fact the opposite is true.</p>
<p>Workers pay into Social Security to support current workers who paid into it in the past.  The trust fund was established, and amended with a good deal of actuarial research under Reagan in 1983, with the knowledge that the baby boom generation would be passing through and create a bulge of benefit needs and that US birth rates tended to be smaller now than they were a century ago.  In other words.  what is happening now in terms of the baby boomer population reaching retirement age and the decline in US birthrates was exactly the information on which the Social Security changes made in the 1980s were predicated.  Either we believe that these kinds of predictions are reasonable (in which case it is utterly silly to raise nightmare scenarioes about bankruptcy, because there is nothing of the sort) or we believe that it is impossible to predict for sure what will happen (in which case it is utterly silly to raise nightmare scenarios about Social Security bankruptcy, because GDP could grow just a little faster than predicted, easing all future problems, or boomer needs could grow just a little less than predicted, easing all future problems).  Either way, the crisis-bell ringing being done by the right as a way to attribute deficits to Social Security is a smoke and mirrors scam.</p>
<p>It is even more so since the Social Security trust fund is invested in US Treasuries and those Treasuries plus new tax funds coming in pay all the benefit costs.  Is the US going to default on Treasuries.  Well, if so, we have a bigger problem with Japan and China not liking that&#8211;not just the Social Security trust fund.  The hard right seems to think it is okay to play political games with US debt, but American citizens should be aware that this is what they are doing.</p>
<p>For a good overall exposition of these issues, see the article in  Salon by Gene Lyons, <a href="http://www.salon.com/2011/11/03/how_the_rich_created_the_social_security_crisis/?source=newsletter">How the Rich Created the Social Security &#8216;Crisis&#8217;</a> (Nov. 3, 2011) (noting the &#8220;decades-long propaganda war against America’s most efficient, successful and popular social insurance program&#8221;).</p>
<blockquote><p><em>[T]his is the beneficiaries’ money, invested by the Social Security trustees in U.S. Treasury bonds drawn upon “the full faith and credit of the United States.” <strong>Far from being “meaningless IOUs” as right-wing cant has it, they represent the same legally binding promise between the U.S. government and its people that it makes with Wall Street banks and the Chinese government, which also hold Treasury Bonds</strong>.</em></p>
<p><em>A promise not very different, the Daily Howler’s Bob Somerby points out, from the one implicit in your bank statement or 401K (if you’re lucky enough to have one). Did you think the money was buried in earthen jars filled with gold bullion and precious stones?  Id. (emphasis added).</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>One might add that many of our multinational corporations that are currently lobbying heavily for yet another tax break in the form of a &#8220;repatriation holiday&#8221; for their offshored, untaxed profits actually have the substantial portion of those profits invested in those same U.S. Treasury notes.  So, as ataxingmatter has noted before, much of that money is already in the US and repatriation will generally not be of much benefit merely from bringing cash back to go through the US economy.  As the article notes, allowing repatriation would lead to corporations dumping about a trillion of US Treasuries on the market, and likely cause a rise in the interest rate the US government must pay to borrow.  Not a win-win situation.  IN fact, clearly a loss for the US government and the majority of US taxpayers, both in Treasury interest rates and in lost corporate tax revenues.</p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2004/03/three-card-monte-following-up-on-kashs.html">Three-Card Monte</a></p>
<p>Following up on <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060519071923/http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2004_02_29_angrybear_archive.html#107824838689419474">Kash&#8217;s earlier post</a> about Greenspan, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060519071923/http://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/02/opinion/02KRUG.html?ex=1393563600&#038;en=f70ca455a31dd83d&#038;ei=5007&#038;partner=USERLAND">Krugman&#8217;s op/ed</a> also highlights a fairly bold bait and switch maneuver by Greenspan:<br />
<blockquote>The payroll tax is regressive: it falls much more heavily on middle- and lower-income families than it does on the rich. In fact, according to Congressional Budget Office estimates, families near the middle of the income distribution pay almost twice as much in payroll taxes as in income taxes. Yet people were willing to accept a regressive tax increase to sustain Social Security.   <br />Now the joke&#8217;s on them. Mr. Greenspan pushed through an increase in taxes on working Americans, generating a Social Security surplus. Then he used that surplus to argue for tax cuts that deliver very little relief to most people, but are worth a lot to those making more than $300,000 a year. And now that those tax cuts have contributed to a soaring deficit, he wants to cut Social Security benefits.</p></blockquote>
<p> <a name="more"></a> As you can see from <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060519071923/http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2004_02_22_angrybear_archive.html#107751944016281105">this post</a> last week, the 2004 deficit is only brought down to a mere $500,000,000,000 by starting with the non-trustfund deficit of $631,000,000,000 and subtracting from that the $154,000,000,000 surplus created by the payroll tax (money allegedly going into the trust fund/lockbox).  <br />To summarize, here&#8217;s Greenspan&#8217;s 20+ year plan to roll back Social Security:<br />
<blockquote>
<p>Step 1. Get appointed in early 1980s to committee to protect Social Security.</p>
<p>Step 2. Successfully propose substantial increases in regressive payroll taxes in order to save Social Security. Workers will pay higher payroll taxes but their retirement benefits will be assured.</p>
<p>Step 3. Wait 20 years; to pass the time, become Chairman of the Federal Reserve.</p>
<p>Step 4. Actively support large and regressive cuts in <em>income</em> taxes. Never mention <em>payroll</em> taxes.</p>
<p>Step 5. Repeat step 4.</p>
<p>Step 6. Observe that in 2004, steps 4 and 5 lead to a $631b shortfall; Step 2, however, created a $154b surplus.</p>
<p>Step 7. Reverse Steps 4 and 5.</p>
<p>Step 8. Just kidding about step 7. Seriously, the answer is clear: cut Social Security benefits.</p>

<p><strong>WHAT KOTLIKOFF (REALLY) SAID</strong></p>
<p>Larry Kotlikoff responded to my post in comments (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/10/social-security-its-just-math.html#comments">Social Security: It’s Just Math</a>). by saying that I (coberly) “wrote quite a lot about something I [Kotlikoff] didn&#8217;t really say.”  He has a point.  I based my speculations about where he obtained his misleading numbers on an <a target="_blank" href="http://www.npr.org/2011/08/06/139027615/a-national-debt-of-14-trillion-try-211-trillion">NPR summary</a> of their interview  with him. Kotlikoff says my speculations were wrong.  He actually got his misleading numbers by including “Medicare plus Medicaid plus Social Security expenditures per adult.” </p>
<p>I still don’t know exactly how he derived his numbers, but I remain quite certain that talking about SocialSecurityMedicareandMedicaid  in one mouthful is grossly misleading.  Social Security has nothing to do with any deficits as it is paid for by the people who will get the benefits. IF those people are going to want higher benefits in the future to keep up with their longer life expectancy and higher standard of living, they would have to raise their own payroll tax about one half of one tenth of one percent, about 40 cents per week in today’s terms, each year while their incomes are projected to be rising over one full percent per year, or eight dollars per week per year in today’s terms.  These numbers are derived directly from the SSA Trustees Report, and CBO options numbers two and three.</p>
<p>Medicare and Medicaid, by contrast, depend on the cost of medical care.  Costs which we are going to have to pay, if we want the medical care, even if we cut Medicare and Medicaid to zero.  We would just end up paying through private insurance, which would tend to mean that the old and poor would not get medical care&#8230; not because “we” were not paying for “their” care, but because we were not allowed to pay in advance for our own care using a system that protects our money from loss due to inflation, including “medical inflation.” </p>
<p>Medicare  is NOT the young paying for the old.  It is the young paying for their own expected costs in old age while they are young and healthy and are making money. <a name="more"></a> As for Medicaid,  costs depend on both the costs of medical care and the number of people in poverty in this country.  Kotlikoff appears to be suggesting that “the young” could save themselves a lot of money if they just didn’t worry about their own needs when they get old, and didn’t think there was any reason to care for the poor and sick. Neither compassion nor an enlightened self interest would be allowed to suggest to the young that they might become old or sick or poor themselves, or that they would ever profit from living in a nation in which the poor and the sick can expect to be helped to return to being strong and good employees, good customers, or even good soldiers.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=139027615">Here is a transcript</a> of what Kotlikoff really said on NPR.  I offer a few  comments interlinear.<br />
<blockquote>August 6, 2011 &#8211; </p>
<p>DAVID GREENE, host: Now, S&#038;P says this downgrade might not even be the last one if the nation&#8217;s debt keeps ballooning. So how to turn this around? Listen to the prescription from Boston University economist Laurence Kotlikoff.  </p>
<p>LAURENCE KOTLIKOFF: What you have to do is either immediately and permanently raise taxes by about two-thirds, or immediately and permanently cut every dollar of spending by 40 percent forever. So I&#8217;m talking about cutting Medicare benefits, Medicaid, Social Security, defense spending, you name it, by 40 percent forever, starting today. That&#8217;s what the CBO&#8217;s numbers say we have an absolutely enormous problem facing us. </p></blockquote>
<p>Again, Kotlikoff prefers the big hammer approach. We are not allowed any subtlety in deciding what programs to cut, or what taxes to raise.  If taxes are currently about 18% of GDP a two thirds raise would raise them to 30%.  This looks a bit scary,  but if we look hard at what we are getting for the money, and what we can get with the money we have left after paying taxes, we COULD decide that it is just the price we have to pay to provide the infrastructure that protects our ability to make money in the first place.   I don’t know if we would feel safe in a country with a 40% smaller defense budget.  And I am sure that not allowing the people to pay more than 60% of what it would cost them to provide an adequate retirement would not be really  smart financial planning.</p>
<blockquote><p>GREENE: Big tax increases, huge cuts to military spending and entitlement programs &#8211; good luck getting that through Congress &#8211; and the problem Kotlikoff says is a whole lot bigger than this $14 debt we&#8217;ve been talking about.  <br />KOTLIKOFF: If you add up all the promises that have been made for spending obligations, including defense expenditures, and you subtract off all the taxes that we expect to collect, the difference is 211 trillion. That&#8217;s the fiscal gap. That&#8217;s our true indebtedness.  <br />GREENE: It&#8217;s a big number. Why aren&#8217;t we hearing more about that as these big debates and all the drama go on in Washington? </p></blockquote>
<p>It is indeed a big number. Kotlikoff needs to explain where he got it from. Then we can look at it and see if it makes any sense.</p>
<blockquote><p>KOTLIKOFF: Well, the politicians have chosen their language carefully to keep most of the problem off the books, and they&#8217;ve done this for decades. So this is Enron accounting to the 10th power, I mean, millionth power, actually</p></blockquote>
<p>.  I see.  It’s a secret.  Been going on for decades. And we never knew.  I don’t know if Kotlikoff has any idea what the “millionth power” means, but given his other numbers, I think he just likes the scary sound of it.</p>
<blockquote><p>GREENE: Quite a strong accusation.  <br />KOTLIKOFF: Well, it&#8217;s, you know, it&#8217;s true. Why are these guys thinking about balancing the budget? They should try and think about our long-term fiscal problems. We&#8217;ve got 78 million baby boomers who are poised to collect, in about 15 to 20 years, about $40,000 per person. Multiply 78 million by 40,000, you&#8217;re talking about more than $3 trillion a year in today&#8217;s dollars just to give to a portion of the population. That&#8217;s an enormous bill that&#8217;s overhanging our heads, and Congress isn&#8217;t focused on it.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is the quote I addressed in my earlier post.  Kotlikoff needs to explain in detail where he gets his numbers. </p>
<p>But more than that we need to understand that Social Security  is not something “we” “give” to “a portion of the population.”  Social Security is “us” paying for our own costs in advance of the time we will BE that “portion of the population.  This is also true about Medicare, though it’s not so obvious in the way Medicare is financed. </p>
<p>As for Medicaid, well,  as long as “we” know that we will never be in that “portion of the population”  or derive any benefit from anybody who is,or was, then I guess there is no reason on earth why “we” should set a “portion” of our money aside to take care of those problems.  But if we know it is OUR money for our own potential needs, it would be sensible to look at ways to control costs.  Kotlikoff appears to think the best way to control the future cost of living is to cut off our own heads now.</p>
<blockquote><p>GREENE: So Americans just watch this drama play out in Washington. I mean, is your message to them that this was all just a useless process?  <br />KOTLIKOFF: This is a sideshow. The Democrats and Republicans have been having a food fight for decades. Underneath that facade of conflict, what&#8217;s really going on is that older generations are taking from young generations on a ongoing basis. And we&#8217;ve consistently done too little, too late, looked too short-term. Well, guess what? You can&#8217;t keep putting off these problems. And we&#8217;ve used language to disguise what&#8217;s really going on here, which is this mess of Ponzi scheme. </p></blockquote>
<p>I would be the last to claim that the Congress is more than a sideshow.  But I hope I have made clear to you why it is national suicide to divide ourselves into “the younger” versus “the older” generations.  We will all become “older” in time.  Meanwhile, even if enlightened self interest does not teach us to pay in advance for at least enough of our old age to meed basic needs, in a program that can guarantee our money will not disappear due to inflation or a bad day on the stock market, we might at least remember that the older generation had something to do with feeding and clothing and housing and educating us, and defending the country and building the infrastructure that makes it possible for us to make more money, with less work, than the now old could when they were young.  Teaching us to think of our elders as “the enemy” is teaching us a kind of mental disease that will return us to the law of the jungle and a life that is “solitary, poor, nasty, brutal, and short.  It is the devil’s agenda.</p>
<blockquote><p>GREENE: We&#8217;ve been speaking to Laurence Kotlikoff, professor of economics at Boston University. He joined us from member station WBUR in Boston. Thank you so much, professor.  <br />KOTLIKOFF: My pleasure.</p></blockquote>

<p>SOCIAL SECURITY:</p>
<p>IT’S JUST MATH</p>
<p>or how to lie with numbers</p>
<p>&#8220;Math doesn&#8217;t lie&#8221; seems to be the new focus group tested mantra  about Social Security that Congressmen and their journalists are so proud to repeat.  What it really means is &#8220;we put a lot of money into finding ways to make the numbers sound big enough to scare the children.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here is a recent example, which I found in  <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/intelligence_squared/2011/09/stop_obsessing_over_entitlement_reform.single.html">http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/intelligence_squared/2011/09/stop_obsessing_over_entitlement_reform.single.html</a></p>
<p>&#8220;Slate:Of course, old people today are no longer poor because of Social Security. But recently, GOP presidential contender and Texas Gov. Rick Perry called it a &#8220;Ponzi scheme.&#8221; And last month, the economist Laurence Kotlikoff said this in an interview with NPR: &#8220;We&#8217;ve got 78 million baby boomers who are poised to collect, in about 15 to 20 years, about $40,000 per person. Multiply 78 million by $40,000–you&#8217;re talking about more than $3 trillion a year just to give to a portion of the population. That&#8217;s an enormous bill overhanging our heads, and Congress isn&#8217;t focused on it.&#8221; But you&#8217;ve written that Social Security will be only a small contributor to the future budget gap. Are Kotlikoff&#8217;s worries unfounded?</p>
<p> <a name="more"></a>
<p>A look at the 2011 Trustees Report Table IV.B2  shows that, sure enough, in 2025 there will be about 78 million beneficiaries to OASDI.    To find the &#8220;$40,000 per person&#8221; is not so easy.  Look at Table VI.F7, Cost of OASDI (“Social Security”) in 2025 will be $1213 Billion, not 3 Trillion, for a per person cost of about $15,551 in “constant 2011 dollars” , not  $40,000.  Hmmm, maybe he means “current dollars, that is inflated dollars.  Well, table VI.F8 gives  $1626 Billion for 2025, still not $ 3 Trillion, or $40,000 per person.  </p>
<p>Wait, maybe he is talking about Social Security PLUS Medicare (HI).  Getting closer. Table VI.F9 gives the combined cost for OASDI AND HI, in current (inflated) dollars as $ 2237 Billion.  Not 3 Trillion. Not $40,000 per person.</p>
<p>So where does Kotlikoff get his scary numbers?  Perhaps from the (Table VI.F9) “High Cost” estimate for 2025, in current dollars,for Social Security plus Medicare, of $ 2737 Billion. Close enough, if you don’t mind rounding up by 10%.</p>
<p>It is not honest to start out by talking about Social Security, then skip to talking about (mumble) “socialsecurityplusmedicare” without bothering to mention that you have done so, or pointing out that Medicare is a very different kind of problem than Social Security. And it is not honest to use a “high cost” estimate which even the Trustees regard as “unlikely,” without even mentioning that that’s what you are doing.  Nor is it honest to talk about inflated dollars without telling people that’s what you are doing and giving them a basis for understanding what the numbers mean in terms of the money they have in their wallet today.</p>
<p>Table VI.F4 gives GDP in current dollars for 2025 as $ 30 Trillion dollars. And the combined “high cost estimate” for the combined costs of Social Security and Medicare as 8.96% of that.  Table VI.F4 gives the intermediate (most likely) estimate of the combined cost of Social Security and Medicare to be 7.66% of GDP. </p>
<p>But even staying with Kotlikoff’s misleading estimate, a “high cost” estimate of feeding and housing, and basic medical care, for 78 million people, over a quarter of the adult population, may reach 10% of GDP.</p>
<p>Kotlikoff is pretty sure this is an “enormous bill overhanging our heads”&#8230;.”just to give to a portion of the population.”</p>
<p>But “we” are not giving it to them.  They will have paid for it.  </p>
<p>And every one of us will one day be in that “portion of the population.”  Kotlikoff appears to be suggesting we just ask old people to step out into the blizzard, so “we” don’t have to pay for “them.” </p>
<p>But “we” will be paying for ourselves&#8230;  just in case, you know, we don’t want to go into the blizzard. “We” are “them.”</p>
<p>With pay as you go financing “we” pay for our future benefits over a forty year period, an average of 30 years before we will need to collect. This is no different than “saving” the money.  Because of inflation people cannot afford to just put the money under the mattress.  Before Social Security they would take it to a bank and hope the bank would pay it back, with enough interest to stay ahead of inflation.  Or they would “invest” their money in hopes of getting back more than they paid in by taking advantage of the growth in the economy.  The  success of this would depend upon picking the right investment on the right day.</p>
<p>Social Security avoids both the risk of inflation, and the risks of investments that go bad at the worst possible time.  By using your money to pay back the people who paid for their Social Security before you, they are able to pay those people with money that is worth more than the money the older people paid in.  This is very simple:  Those older people paid a tax on an income that was a lot smaller than yours.  You pay the same tax on a larger income. This makes more money available to pay the benefits due to the older people.</p>
<p>This is effectively the same as “interest”, and because it comes from the growth of the whole economy it is not subject to the same risk as individual investments.  And because it is paid in “current” dollars, it always keeps up with inflation.</p>
<p>And when it’s your turn to retire, you will get the same advantage the older generation got.  And when your children retire, they will get the same advantage you got.  And so on, forever.</p>
<p>But please note, it is YOU paying for your own retirement.  It is NOT you paying for granny.  She already paid for her own retirement.  </p>
<p>Don’t be confused by the pay as you go feature.  It is really not different from what happens when you put your money in the bank or buy stocks and bonds.</p>
<p>Your money goes, the same day you deposited it, right out the door to pay for the current uses of some other person.  And when you are ready to cash out your savings, or stocks and bonds, the money would come in the door, that very day, from some other person, presumably someone looking for a safe place to save for his retirement.</p>
<p>To get a more honest picture than the one Kotlikoff is trying to scare you with,  look at Table VI.F7,  and see that the intermediate (best guess) cost of OASDI in 2025 is projected to be $ 1212.8 Billion in &#8220;constant 2011 dollars&#8221;&#8230; dollars worth as much as the dollars in your wallet today.   Divide $1212.8 Billion by 78 million and you get $15,549 per beneficiary.  </p>
<p>Table VI.F2 says this is 15.67% of “taxable income.  The same line gives the SS income rate  as 13.15%.  This is the amount of money available to pay the benefits. It comes from the current payroll tax rate of 12.4%  and additional income&#8230; mostly a part of the income tax that IRS collected on income from benefits and kicks back to SS. This means a tax increase of about 2.5% (15.7 &#8211; 13.2) would be needed to close the gap.  </p>
<p>The best way to increase the tax this much by the year 2025 would be to raise the payroll tax about one tenth of one percent per year for each the boss and the worker.</p>
<p>But it turns out the need for the raise has long been anticipated and the workers have been “saving up for it” by paying a tax rate higher than needed for the usual pay as you go.  This gives SS a savings account (the Trust Fund) to draw on to ease the transition to the higher tax rate. The Trust Fund will still have about  2.6 Trillion dollars in it by 2025, helping to pay the increased costs (Table VI.F7).  </p>
<p>We could just let the Trust Fund make up the difference between the tax rate and the cost rate, but this would not be prudent.  It turns out that a gradual increase in the tax rate of ONE FOURTH  of one tenth of one percent per year for each the boss and the worker will keep Social Security “solvent” forever. This is about 20 cents per week per year for each. </p>
<p>Actually no increase at all would be needed to  keep Social Security “solvent.”  The increase suggested here is what it would take to maintain the current “replacement rate”.. that is the percent of your pre-retirement earnings that you collect from Social Security on a monthly basis, AND retire at the same age as current retirees.   It’s pretty certain you would want to do both of those things, and as we have seen, the cost is not even high enough to notice.</p>
<p>While your tax is going up one quarter of one tenth of one percent per year, your income is projected to go up over one full percent per year.  That means, essentially, that each year your tax is twenty cents more per week (forty cents if you are your own boss) and your income is 8 dollars per week more than it was last year.  Leaving you with MORE money every week than you had before, PLUS having paid for a longer, richer, secure retirement.</p>
<p>So Kotlikoff’s 3 Trillion dollar “enormous bill hanging over our heads,” just to “give” to a “part” of the population (you) turns out to be a need to raise your own tax&#8230; really your own savings&#8230; less than a tenth of a percent per year over the time between now and then.</p>
<p>Remember this is your own money.  Not “the government’s.”  It’s not welfare.  You pay for your own retirement.  There is no deficit or debt.  Just a need to pay for what YOU will need. And it won’t cost enough to even notice.</p>
<p>It’s just math.</p>
<p>[note&#8230;</p>
<p>The numbers I give above are for OASDI, Social Security proper, not Medicare, because Medicare’s problems are best addressed by controlling medical costs (not by cutting benefits).</p>
<p>But even if costs can’t be controlled,  we may decide we want to pay for the medical care anyway.  The cost of this would be about a fourth of the cost of Social Security.  So the same logic applies. Instead of raising your tax 40 cents per week each year, you might have to raise it 50 cents per week each year.  You are still going to have more money after paying the tax than you have today.  And you will still be paying, in advance, for your own needs&#8230;  not some other “portion of the population.”]</p>

<p><strong>ARITHMETIC MATTERS</strong></p>
<p>I was thinking that someone could fault my essay the other day about the “Intelligence Squared” debate.  I said that Howard Dean’s side did not really help anyone understand why, or what, or how to “save the program.”  I hope I helped explain the why and what, but I probably wasn’t any more clear than Dean about  how.</p>
<p>This will attempt to address that. Recall the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/312411#ixzz1a6qBaLMN%3Cbr%20/%3E">original article about the debate</a> </p>
<blockquote><p>Arithmetic still matters,&#8221; Zuckerman began. &#8220;Medicaid now pays for both health and long term care for roughly 55 million Americans. It finances more than one third of all births in the United States, and pays the cost of almost two thirds of the people in nursing homes. The federal government underwrites 50 to 77 percent of the cost, depending on the income level of each state. Even so, Medicaid is the second biggest and fastest growing category of state spending. Costs are up more than 60 percent in the last five years and are expected to exceed $450 billion this year and to keep growing by about eight percent annually for the next decade. In the next &#8212; by the mid-2030s, the 65 and over population will nearly double, and health care costs, which have been rising far faster than worker productivity since the end of World War II, may be completely out of control, resulting in a tidal wave of federal spending.</p></blockquote>
<p>Perhaps arithmetic still matters, but Zuckerman is careful to avoid giving us any.  Instead he seduces us down a path that begins with apparent sober numerical facts and ends with pure demagoguery.</p>
<p>You need to learn to beware of words like “costs are up more than 60%”&#8230; <br /><a name="more"></a><br />Sixty percent of what?  If Medicare costs went up 60%, they would go from 3% of payroll to about 5%.  This might be more than you want to pay.  It might even be more than it should be.  But it is not exactly an intolerable burden if that’s what it costs to live a longer and healthier life.</p>
<p>But, just as a matter of “arithmetic,” note how a 2% increase in costs becomes a scary “60% increase.”  This is typical of the “it’s just math” school of liars.</p>
<p>Similarly, the rest of Zuckerman’s seduction presents numbers intended to scare you into thinking that Medicaid costs are high and growing alarmingly.  It would be just as reasonable to think that health care costs are high and will get higher, and that government programs are the best way people have to pay for them. Or even that government needs to step in and find a way to control costs (which is not the same as cut benefits).</p>
<p>But finally we reach the payoff.: be afraid of costs “completely out of control”  and “a tidal wave of Federal spending.&#8221;</p>
<p>None of the “arithmetic” Zuckerman  gives us here actually supports that scary rhetoric.  His theorem amounts to:  “If costs are going up, we must cut our insurance.”</p>
<p>I don’t know how much costs are going to go up.  Neither does Zuckerman.  But I can suggest that you try to find out what costs are now in terms of your own personal budget, and what they are likely to be in terms of your personal budget at some reasonable time in the future.  And what the estimate is based on.  And whether it is a cost you are going to have to pay one way or another&#8230; either through taxes or private insurance or out of pocket. Don’t forget this is insurance.  You may be healthy today,  but with insurance you are paying a little bit now “just in case” you are faced with life or death huge costs&#8230;personal costs&#8230;in the future.</p>
<p>And what is the safest way to pay for them.  Private insurance cannot guarantee that it will be able to pay for your care, even after you have paid premiums for your entire life.  The government can.  </p>
<p>There is also some reason to suppose that the government might be in a better position to control prices than private insurance. But only  as long as we can remind the government that we are paying for our own insurance here, and not just some budget item they can cut  “to balance income”  with no consequences to the people who thought they were paying for insurance that would be there when they need it.</p>
<p>Pay as you go is the only way that I can think of to make this work.  Under  pay as you go the people just pay for current costs.  Their own future costs will be higher, so they are not bearing an unfair burden. Their own future costs will be paid for (directly) by the workers of that time&#8230; who will have higher wages and will be more able to afford it.  Those future workers own higher costs in turn will be paid for by the workers of that later time&#8230; who will have higher wages&#8230; and so on.</p>
<p>Perhaps the process can’t go on forever.  But it can go on a lot longer than retired people can afford to pay each month for the “insurance” that would pay for their current level of risk. The ultimate answer to high costs is to find a way to control them, and to decide how much of your current income you are willing to set aside for what level of health care you may want in the future. Please note there is no &#8220;looming deficit&#8221; here. We just pay the costs as they come up.  The magic of pay as you go will assure than none of us pay more than our own &#8220;expected&#8221; costs.  The fact that we are paying in advance of our own need does not mean that we are paying for &#8220;someone else&#8221; or that we are not paying for ourself.</p>
<p>I don’t know what the whole health care arithmetic will turn out to be when it is done by someone honest, but I can point at something which may be important to keep in mind:</p>
<p>Table VI.F2 of the 2011 Trustees Report tells us that the cost of Medicare (HI) in 2030 will be about 4.4% of taxable payroll, compared to about 3.8% today. This looks to me like about a half of one percent increase in your payroll tax, and half of that will be paid by your boss.  That is not a staggering burden. [It might be more reasonable to compare the future cost to the present tax rate.. 2.9%, half from the worker, half from the boss.  This would suggest a need to raise the tax 1.5% over the next 20 years.  That would be less than half of one tenth of one percent per year for each the boss and the employee&#8230;.still not a staggering burden.  And it goes to pay for your own eventual health care needs.]</p>
<p>Moreover, the real wage is expected to increase at least 1.2% per year between today and 2030.  This would result in a real wage that is about 25% higher in 2030 than it is today.</p>
<p>Lets say that today you are making 1000 dollars per week.  You are paying 1.45% for Medicare or about $14.50 per month. (your boss pays another $14.50, but if you want to say that is “really” your money, you need to add $14.50 to your income. )  This leaves you with about $986 a week after you have paid for your Medicare.</p>
<p>In 2030, your income would be 1,250 dollars per week (real).  And if there were no increase in the Medicare tax rate, your tax would be $18.12, leaving you with $1232 per week after you have paid for Medicare.</p>
<p>If the cost of Medicare goes up to 4.4% of taxable payroll and the tax rate is raised to meet the cost, your share goes up to 2.2%, and you would pay $27.50 per week for Medicare, leaving you with about $1222 after paying for your Medicare.</p>
<p>So even with the increased cost of Medicare, you would have 236 dollars in real money more than you have today AFTER paying for your Medicare.</p>
<p>There are, of course, other taxes,  but the arithmetic is the same.  After calculating the increased costs, and your expected increase in wages, you are going to be richer in the future, not staggering under a load of “debt”.</p>
<p>All you have to do is pay for what YOU ARE GOING TO NEED.  You are not “paying for granny.”  Granny already paid for herself.  </p>
<p>Note that even if costs for health care go up faster than your wages &#8230; in real terms&#8230;  you are still paying for something you may want more than a new car when you get sick.</p>
<p>I suggest this is the real arithmetic you need to keep in mind.</p>

<p>INTELLIGENCE SQUARED DEBATE OFFERS LITTLE IN THE WAY OF ACTUAL INTELLIGENCE</p>
<p>I am reading a short article on the Intelligence Squared debate I previously referred to in <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/10/social-security-for-young.html" target="_blank">Social Security For the Young</a>. It turns out they were more concerned with &#8220;insurance&#8221; than with Social Security.</p>
<p>But they don&#8217;t seem to understand the idea of insurance. The &#8220;for&#8221; side of the debate resolution: &#8220;Commitments made to seniors decades ago&#8230;saddle our children with unmanageable debt&#8230;&#8221; neglected to mention that Granny paid for those &#8220;commitments,&#8221; and there is no &#8220;debt,&#8221; manageable or otherwise. But granny didn&#8217;t get much help from the &#8220;against&#8221; side. Here are excerpts from the article <a href="http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/312411#ixzz1a6qBaLMN" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>One shocking statistic is that 37 percent of those who came of age in this millennium are unemployed,&#8221; Rosenkranz said. &#8220;When consumers lack the confidence to spend, when businessmen lack the confidence to invest and to hire, it is the young that suffer most. The health insurance debate focused on the uninsured. But think for a moment about how health insurance is priced. Almost everywhere the young pay the same premium as their more illness prone elders. A massive subsidy for the old paid for by the young. Tens of millions of young people quite reasonably said no thanks to health insurance until the government mandated that they say yes.</p></blockquote>
<p>The motion was that the young are being asked to sacrifice financially for the entitlement programs of the elderly, and the Conservative panelists argued in favor of that motion.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />
<blockquote>Arithmetic still matters,&#8221; Zuckerman began. &#8220;Medicaid now pays for both health and long term care for roughly 55 million Americans. It finances more than one third of all births in the United States, and pays the cost of almost two thirds of the people in nursing homes. The federal government underwrites 50 to 77 percent of the cost, depending on the income level of each state. Even so, Medicaid is the second biggest and fastest growing category of state spending. Costs are up more than 60 percent in the last five years and are expected to exceed $450 billion this year and to keep growing by about eight percent annually for the next decade. In the next &#8212; by the mid-2030s, the 65 and over population will nearly double, and health care costs, which have been rising far faster than worker productivity since the end of World War II, may be completely out of control, resulting in a tidal wave of federal spending.</p></blockquote>
<p>But the Liberal camp did not see America&#8217;s entitlement programs as something that needs significant renovation.</p>
<blockquote><p>The elderly used to be the poorest group in American until in 1926 the farm states where the Depression started began Social Security, which has then spread to a national program by Roosevelt in 1933,&#8221; Dean argued. &#8220;So this is a core program. We just need to make it work and we just need some mild tweaks. Health care needs a lot of tweaks, but the whole system needs tweaks, not simply Medicare. And we should stop victimizing Medicare for the sake of keeping our taxes absurdly low. The fact is people need to pay their fair share in America, and the Bush tax cuts need to sunset. You know, when the taxes were at Bill Clinton’s rate, the economy was a whole lot better than it is now. And I wouldn’t mind going back to those taxes and paying my fair share at all.</p></blockquote>
<p>Beginning with the fatuous remark by Zuckerman that &#8220;Arithmetic still matters&#8221; it seems to me that neither side understands what they are talking about.</p>
<p>Arithmetic only matters if you understand the problem you are &#8220;solving&#8221; in the first place.</p>
<p>I doubt very much &#8220;the young&#8221; pay the same for private health insurance as &#8220;the old.&#8221; But in the case of Medicare, and less directly Medicaid or any government paid health insurance, the whole point is that THE YOUNG WILL BECOME THE OLD. It makes more sense for them to pay a small premium, while they are young and healthy and working, over a long period of time, so that they will have paid in advance for health care needs that will come when they are old and sick and not working. THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT OF &#8220;INSURANCE.&#8221; 
<p>And that is the whole reason that government paid insurance is &#8220;better than&#8221; private insurance. It just is not possible for a private company to pay for health care forty years after the premium was paid in. Government plans, whether explicitly &#8220;pay as you go&#8221; plans for which the insured person pays directly, as Medicare is in part, or just a general &#8220;we are all in this together&#8221; plan where &#8220;on average&#8221; younger workers are &#8220;paying for&#8221; older people out of general taxes&#8230; but will be paid for in their turn when they become older&#8230; can manage this kind of infinite &#8220;pay it forward&#8221; financing with no problem at all. No problem except for the political liars who pretend that the young are bearing the burden for the old.. as a trick to fool the young into voting for someone who promises to lift the burden&#8230; and leave them to the mercies of the free market when they get old and sick and out of work.</p>
<p>
<p>The fact that costs are going up is not an argument FOR cutting your insurance. In fact it would be insane to CUT your insurance because you think costs are going to go up. With pay as you go financing the increased costs will be to some extent subsidized by the &#8220;next&#8221; generation&#8230; but that generation will have its own increased costs subsidized by the following generation. Moreover each generation will be richer than the last, making it easier for them to pay the increased costs. This is not a Ponzi scheme, because each generation will get the same good deal as the last&#8230;and it can go on forever. In fact, it&#8217;s the best deal &#8220;the young&#8221; can hope for.</p>
<p>
<p>Unfortunately Howard Dean&#8217;s remarks, as quoted here, don&#8217;t seem to address this simple fact. Rather he offers a kind of vague &#8220;we need to pay taxes to save the program&#8221; which is true, but doesn&#8217;t really help anyone understand why. or what. or how.</p>
<p>
<p>Go back to what Rosenkranz said at the beginning of the excerpt: &#8220;When consumers lack the confidence to spend, when businessmen lack the confidence to invest and hire, it is the young that suffer most.&#8221;</p>
<p>
<p>And what does Rosenkranz think will happen to consumer confidence, and ultimately to business confidence, when young people finally notice that without Social Security and Medicare they are looking forward to an old age that is desperate,poor, nasty, brutal, and short?</p>
<p>
<p>I would add an entirely personal comment: The purpose of arguments like &#8220;honoring commitments to granny&#8230; impose intolerable debt on the young&#8221; is three fold.</p>
<p>
<p>First, encourage &#8220;the young&#8221; to continue to believe they will never get old.</p>
<p>
<p>Second, take the young despise the old, and everyone else: &#8220;we don&#8217;t owe them anything.&#8221; We are all proud, heroic, individuals. We don&#8217;t need &#8220;cooperation&#8221;, much less kindness.</p>
<p>
<p>And third, enable the young to tell themselves that &#8220;commitments&#8221; don&#8217;t matter. Not just vague promises here, but commitments to give people what they paid for.</p>
<p>Someone more old fashioned than we allow ourselves to be would say this is the way to a society of anxiety, pain, and misery. Pleasures, perhaps, for the &#8220;winners,&#8221; but no happiness at all, for anyone, win or lose.</p>

<p><strong>Social Security For The Young</strong></p>
<p>Intelligence Squared U.S. (corrected link: http://intelligencesquaredus.org/) is sponsoring an Oxford-style debate Tuesday evening in Manhattan. The program is entitled &#8220;Grandma&#8217;s Benefits Imperil Junior&#8217;s Future&#8221; The resolution:</p>
<p>&#8220;Commitments made to seniors decades ago failed to foresee the harsh economic realities of the present. Do entitlements saddle our children with unmanageable debt, asking them to sacrifice their future for the sake of the elderly? Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid were created to provide a social safety net. But if we cut these programs, are we balancing the budget on the backs of the aged and sick, leaving behind society’s most vulnerable?&#8221;</p>
<p>Arguing for the motion will be Fox &#8220;News&#8221; commentator Margaret Hoover and U.S. News and World Report editor-in-chief Mort Zuckerman.</p>
<p>Arguing against will be former DNC Chair and Vermont Gov. Howard Dean and Roosevelt Institute economist Jeff Madrick.</p>
<p>Does keeping promises to the elderly mean sacrificing our children&#8217;s future?</p>
<p>The answer is, &#8220;NO! This is nonsense. Social Security has NOTHING to do with balancing the budget.</p>
<p>But while you will hear the lies the enemies of Social Security have been telling for 75 years, it is not certain the defenders of Social Security will explain the simple truth.<a name="more"></a></p>
<p>The simple truth is that Social Security has nothing to do with &#8220;the harsh economic realities of the present&#8221; except to provide the insurance payments that people paid for &#8220;just in case&#8221; of harsh economic realities like the present.</p>
<p>Social Security is NOT in trouble. It is not broke. It is not going to go broke. It can&#8217;t ever go broke.</p>
<p>Unless you believe the lies and let them break it.</p>
<p>With NO CHANGES AT ALL Social Security can continue to pay &#8220;all&#8221; benefits forever at a level that is &#8220;enough&#8221; by today&#8217;s standards.</p>
<p>So why do we keep hearing that is going to go broke and create huge budget deficits&#8230; unless we raise huge taxes on the young&#8230; or &#8220;the rich&#8221;?</p>
<p>Well, because there are highly paid liars &#8212; they call them &#8220;non partisan experts&#8221; &#8212; who are paid to tell you this.</p>
<p>And you, dear reader, will have to think very hard to free yourself from the lies. They have been telling you lies since you were a child, charitably giving &#8220;lesson plans&#8221; to the schools, so that well meaning, but not very well informed, teachers would teach the lies to children too young to know they were being lied to. So you would grow up and every time you heard &#8220;Social Security.&#8221; you would think, &#8220;it won&#8217;t be there for me. it&#8217;s going broke.&#8221;</p>
<p>And even those people who partly know better can only say &#8220;it&#8217;s not going broke&#8230; not yet anyway.&#8221; or &#8220;it&#8217;s not going broke, it will be able to pay 80% of benefits&#8230; so it&#8217;s only 20% broke,&#8221; or &#8220;it&#8217;s not going broke&#8230; we can make the rich pay for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, it&#8217;s not going broke at all. Not even one percent. Not ever. And it doesn&#8217;t need to be fixed. And the rich don&#8217;t have to pay for it.</p>
<p>In fact the whole point of Social Security is that it is NOT a tax on the rich. It is NOT welfare. It is not even &#8220;government spending.&#8221; It is the only way that workers have to save their own money for their own retirement protected from inflation and market losses.</p>
<p>Social Security is a very smart way to protect workers savings by a simple idea called &#8220;pay as you go with wage indexing.&#8221;</p>
<p>The way it works is something like this. [There are some details here that I have simplified to make the point easier to follow. They do not change the basic idea, or the &#8220;cost&#8221; to workers in any important way.]</p>
<p>When I was young I made a dollar an hour. If the payroll tax then was what it is today [it was a lot less] it would mean I paid about 6 cents an hour to Social Security, and my boss contributed another six cents. My 12 cents, times 2000 hours per year times about 100 million people [if the population was the same&#8230; it was a lot less] would add up to enough money to pay the retirement needs of about 50 million old people [there were a lot fewer]. Fifty years later, workers doing the same work I was doing are making about ten dollars an hour. So they contribute about $1.20 to their Social Security. That means that $1.20 times 2000 hours per year times 100 million people would be available to pay the retirement benefits of 50 million retirees. In other words, to pay my current Social Security benefits, there is ten times as much money available as i was paying in&#8230; with no change in the tax rate.</p>
<p>Some of this is &#8220;just&#8221; inflation, but enough of it is a real increase in wages over that time. This real increase in wages translates into a real effective &#8220;interest&#8221; on the money I paid into Social Security, allowing me to collect more than I paid in. Even the part that was &#8220;inflation&#8221; would have been hard for me to earn in interest over those fifty years.</p>
<p>Now it happens that over that time, the ratio of the number of beneficiaries to the number of workers has changed, but so has the tax rate. The ratio of workers to beneficiaries has gone from ten to one to about three to one. So the tax rate has gone from 2% to 6%. That is not a &#8220;terrible problem.&#8221; It merely reflects the gradual phasing in of Social Security. This meant that on a pay as you go basis the early worker-beneficiaries got a bargain. On the other hand, those early workers had supported their own parents and paid for welfare for others, lived through the depression and fought World War 2, and served in the draft, and built the infrastructure that makes it easier for you to make money than it was for them. But it does not mean that later worker-beneficiaries are bearing a cruel burden. They are paying in no more than they will get back. In fact they are paying less, because of that pay as you go effective interest we just talked about.</p>
<p>If there were no Social Security you would still have to save at least as much money as you now save via the payroll &#8220;tax.&#8221; Moreover you would have to earn at least enough interest to pay for inflation, and you would be lucky to earn enough interest to equal the effective interest that &#8220;wage adjustment&#8221; through Social Security provides you. You might do better than that. Or you might do a lot worse. Social Security is insurance to prevent you from doing worse. The &#8220;rate of return&#8221; is not bad, but that&#8217;s not the important point. The important point with insurance is the difference between &#8220;enough&#8221; and &#8220;not enough.&#8221; Social Security provides you with enough to retire if all else fails.</p>
<p>The hardest part of saving enough on your own would be actually saving the money in the first place. Most people can always find something more important today than saving money for tomorrow. And then tomorrow comes sooner than they expect. The second hardest part would be keeping up with inflation. And the third hard part would be not losing it all to a bad investment or just a bad decade on the stock market.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s basically how it works. No tricks. No magic. No anxious hopes. No &#8220;if only&#8217;s&#8221;. No greedy geezers. No taxes on the rich. No trips to the welfare office. Just you saving for your own basic retirement. There is no reason this can&#8217;t continue forever.</p>
<p>So why does &#8220;everybody know it&#8217;s going broke and it won&#8217;t be there for them&#8221;?</p>
<p>Because everybody has been lied to. You have been lied to your whole life, and you will have to work very hard to understand that. All the little lies will pop into your head saying, &#8220;No&#8230;it&#8217;s really a Ponzi scheme.&#8221; &#8220;no, it&#8217;s really greedy geezers,&#8221; &#8220;no. the return on investment is really lousy.&#8221; &#8220;no, the return on investment is really too generous.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not going broke. Ever. But here is why they get away with saying &#8220;it&#8221; is.</p>
<p>Back in 1983 there was some danger it COULD go broke. There was a lot of inflation and a lot of unemployment at the same time, and the Social Security tax rate had not been raised enough to pay for the benefits the workers would need. [it was 8%]. They fixed that problem then by raising the rate to 11.4%, scheduled to rise to 12.4%. But this rate was actually higher than needed to just pay for Social Security&#8217;s needs on a pay as you go basis. The extra was put into a Trust Fund &#8212; that means it was saved in a legal way so the money, and the interest it earned could only be used to pay for Social Security benefits. So in effect the Baby Boomers would be paying in advance for their own retirement needs above the normal pay as you go rate. This Trust Fund is exactly like a savings account you might set up to pay for your kid&#8217;s college. It grows until the kid goes to college, then it is draw down to pay for his expenses. And it runs out of money about the time he graduates. So the Social Security Trust Fund is expected to run out of money just about the time the Baby Boomers run out&#8230;. of a need for benefits.</p>
<p>It is this running out of the Trust Fund that the politicians and journalists point to and shout that &#8220;Social Security is going broke.&#8221; But the Trust Fund is NOT Social Security. It&#8217;s a bridge fund to help pay for the Boomer retirement. It is SUPPOSED to run out of money.</p>
<p>After that, Social Security goes back to &#8220;pay as you go with wage indexing.&#8221; And it can continue on that basis forever.</p>
<p>But there is one more little wrinkle in the story. While the Trust Fund is paying for the Boomer retirement, the &#8220;young&#8221; are going to be living longer than their grandparents did. If they are going to be living longer, they will need to save a little more for their retirement.</p>
<p>Or they can wait and not retire as soon as they might have wanted. Or they can retire on time and take a little less each month in order to make their savings last the longer time they will need it.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, with no change at all, Social Security can pay for them to retire on time, and pay &#8220;all&#8221; benefits over their life expectancy at a monthly rate that would be considered &#8220;enough&#8221; by our standards today. But because the people of that time will be making about 60% more (real) money than we are today, they may want to retire at the same higher standard of living&#8230; that is keep the same monthly rate of benefits that people get today (which would be worth more than today&#8217;s). If they will want to do this&#8230; keep the same &#8220;replacement rate&#8221; and the same retirement age, they would need to raise their savings rate (payroll tax) about 2% for the worker and 2% for the employer. This will not be a hardship for them because they will be making 60% more than you are today. And the really good news is they don&#8217;t have to do this all at once. In fact it would be better if they raised it about a tenth of a percent per year over the next twenty years. They would never notice the increase&#8230; because their wages are going up. But they sure would notice having to put off their retirement, or having to live on a pension that was &#8220;enough&#8221; for their grandparents, but won&#8217;t buy what the people living in the same time and in the same neighborhood are going to &#8220;need.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Social Security cannot go broke. It can always pay &#8220;all&#8221; benefits. But you will have to defend it from the liars, and you will have to decide what tax rate you are willing to pay in order to get the level of benefits you will want at the age you will want to retire.</p>
<p>To put it simply, if you want to keep the same retirement age, and the same relative replacement rate you would need to raise your tax rate at least one half of one tenth of one percent per year&#8230; that&#8217;s forty cents per week in today&#8217;s terms.</p>
<p>Or you could take the chance of having to work for the boss until you are ready for the glue factory. Even if you don&#8217;t want to stop working when you are 65, or 62, you may like the idea of having your Social Security to back you up while you try to do something really worthwhile with the rest of your life.</p>
<p>But you are going to have to undo a lot of lies if you are going to save your Social Security for your own needs.</p>
<p>Small note on math:</p>
<p>The average worker is making 1000 dollars a week today; he is paying 60 dollars a week for his Social Security, and his boss is contributing a matching 60 dollars. This leaves him with 940 dollars a week to live on (and pay other taxes). The average SS beneficiary gets about 400 dollars a week.</p>
<p>In 2040 or so the average worker will be making about 1600 dollars a week. With no change in the payroll tax, he would pay 96 dollars a week into SS. his boss would match that. leaving him with 1504 per week to live on&#8230; The average beneficiary would get 640 per week&#8230;. IF he wasn’t going to live longer. To make the money last a life time that is about one third longer he would have to settle for 480 dollars per week.</p>
<p>Or he could have raised his payroll tax by 2%. then he would pay a tax of 128 dollars per week, and his boss would match that. leaving him 1472 per week to live on &#8230; And the average beneficiary would get that 640 per week without having to delay his retirement for years. Note the trade off. He gives up 32 dollars a week out of 1500 while he is working in order to gain 160 dollars a week out of about 500 while he is retired. And this doesn&#8217;t even count the gain that worker will get from the &#8220;effective interest&#8221; we talked about.</p>
<p>Look at those numbers. It’s hard for young people to really understand that they are going to get old, and they are not going to want to work until they are ready to die, or may not even be able to work. You are going to have 530 dollars more per week after tax than you have today even if you raise your own tax the 2% that would be enough to allow you to retire young enough to enjoy it, with enough money to live about the way your neighbors live&#8230; the way you lived before you retired.</p>
<p>This is not a crushing burden. It’s called being richer, and using some of your extra money to pay for a longer, happier retirement.</p>
<p>And it has NOTHING to do with the Federal budget. It’s you paying for your own retirement. IF you are smart enough to keep them from stealing it.</p>

                                <p>Brad DeLong points us to a post from The Nation on early Koch brothers and Hayek <a target="_blank" href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2011/09/the-road-to-serfdom.html">The Road to Serfdom!!</a></p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.thenation.com/article/163672/charles-koch-friedrich-hayek-use-social-security?utm_source=dlvr.it&#038;utm_medium=twitter&#038;page=full">Yasha Levine and Mark Ames</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Charles Koch to Friedrich Hayek: Use Social Security!: [I]n early June 1973, weeks after [Charles] Koch was appointed president of the Institute for Humane Studies. Along with his brothers, Koch inherited his father’s privately held oil company in 1967…. Koch invited Hayek to serve as the institute’s “distinguished senior scholar” in preparation for its first conference on Austrian economics, to be held in June 1974.</p>
<p>Hayek initially declined Koch’s offer. In a letter to IHS secretary Kenneth Templeton Jr., dated June 16, 1973, Hayek explains that he underwent gall bladder surgery in Austria earlier that year, which only heightened his fear of “the problems (and costs) of falling ill away from home.” (Thanks to waves of progressive reforms, postwar Austria had near universal healthcare and robust social insurance plans that Hayek would have been eligible for.)<br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>IHS vice president George Pearson (who later became a top Koch Industries executive) responded three weeks later, conceding that it was all but impossible to arrange affordable private medical insurance for Hayek in the United States. However, thanks to research by Yale Brozen, a libertarian economist at the University of Chicago, Pearson happily reported that “social security was passed at the University of Chicago while you [Hayek] were there in 1951. You had an option of being in the program. If you so elected at that time, you may be entitled to coverage now.”</p>
<p>A few weeks later, the institute reported the good news: Professor Hayek had indeed opted into Social Security while he was teaching at Chicago…. He was eligible…. On August 10, 1973, Koch wrote a letter appealing to Hayek to accept a shorter stay at the IHS, hard-selling Hayek on Social Security’s retirement benefits, which Koch encouraged Hayek to draw on even outside America. He also assured Hayek that Medicare, which had been created in 1965 by the Social Security amendments as part of Lyndon Johnson’s Great Society programs, would cover his medical needs…. [T]aking on the unlikely role of Social Security Administration customer service rep, Koch adds, “In order to be eligible for medical coverage you must apply during the registration period which is anytime from January 1 to March 31. For your further information, I am enclosing a pamphlet on Social Security.”</p></blockquote>
