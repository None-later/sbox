<p>        &#8230; <br />
<blockquote>Few expect Washington to replicate the scope of the Bowles-Simpson plan. Though it is widely praised, its $4 trillion in 10-year savings includes major changes to Social Security opposed by liberals and an aggressive new tax code that would generate far more revenue than most conservatives could stomach.</p></blockquote>
<p>        &#8230; <br />
<blockquote>About half the new savings would come from reversing part of the massive tax cuts that, along with the collapse of tax collections during the recent recession, are a major cause of current budget problems. The rest would come from lower spending, including on Social Security and Medicare, forecast to be the biggest drivers of future borrowing.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>After four years of sheer obstructionism &#8212; behavior that was called out during the presidential campaign season &#8212; most Americans are pointedly aware of who is willing to further wreck the nation&#8217;s economy and who would like to rescue it.</p>
<p>Fifty-three percent of the nation believes that if a fiscal agreement isn&#8217;t reached by New Year&#8217;s Eve, Republicans in Congress are the ones to blame, reports a new Washington Post-Pew Research Center poll. It also reports that only 38 percent believe that the president and the Republican Congress will reach a deal.</p>
<p>If those pessimists are right, then in an effort to assure a long-term deficit reduction, a series of mandatory and draconian spending cuts will jump off in less than seven weeks, coupled with the expiration of a slew of tax cuts.</p></blockquote>

                                <h5>The GOP&#8217;s extortion demands: cut Social Security or we&#8217;ll shoot the country in the foot</h5>
<p>The GOP created the fiscal cliff beginning with the &#8220;temporary&#8221; tax cuts passed in 2001, 2003 and 2004 under the Bush administration, all as purportedly temporary provisions with sunset dates.  They hoped that the passage of the tax cuts would, as generally happens when people have more of something they like, lead people to demand making all of the cuts permanent.  The result would be a huge tax decrease for the wealthiest taxpayers, and a rather insignificant tax decrease for most Americans.</p>
<p>In many ways, their strategy worked.  Most Americans forget that they didn&#8217;t think they really had to have a cut in income taxes back in 2001, and they don&#8217;t want to pay more taxes than they are paying now, even a little bit more.   And the Great Recession means that for many Americans who are suffering deep financial injury still because of the housing and jobs crisis, every tax dollar saved is a step back to normalcy.<br />But the tax cuts pushed by the GOP joined together with the tremendous costs of the preemptive wars pushed by the GOP to create a veritable snowballing deficit. </p>
<p>Under Bush, we went from surplus in year one, to huge deficits the rest of the time (with much of the impact of the deficit hidden by the purportedly temporary nature of the provisions and the annual passage of an AMT patch that didn&#8217;t have to be included in the calculation of the deficit until the particular patch was passed).  Those two huge drivers of the deficit were treated by the GOP at the time as inconsequential, as GOP stars claimed that &#8220;deficits don&#8217;t matter.&#8221;  See <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/opinion/index.ssf/2012/07/dick_cheney_to_congressional_r.html">Dick Cheney to Congressional Republicans: don&#8217;t stop spending</a>, The Oregonian (July 18, 2012) (noting Cheney&#8217;s current advice to keep spending on the military and retelling the story of Cheney&#8217;s telling then Treasury secretary O&#8217;Neill that &#8220;Reagan proved that deficits don&#8217;t matter&#8221;).</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Part of the right&#8217;s goal, of course, was to use the increases in deficits that their tax cuts caused as a rationale for &#8220;starving the beast&#8221;&#8211;forcing the Democrats to accept cuts (they of course called them &#8220;reforms&#8221;) to the parts of governnment that the right doesn&#8217;t like.  That meant reduction to the benefits from, and privatization of, Social Security and Medicare and reduction of government employee pensions and maybe, in a far right dream world, the elimination of any federal role in basic research funding, disaster emergency responses, and education.  Meanwhile, the right would continue to push for increased spending on the parts of government it likes (military spending, for example&#8211;see Cheney&#8217;s July 2012 admonition to the GOP to keep spending on the military, above) and continued favorable tax subsidies for the wealthy and big corporations (carried interest, domestic manufacturing deduction, etc.) even if that continued to add to the deficit and the debt. </p>
<p>The GOP&#8217;s tune changed when the flagrant underregulation of the financialized economy (deregulation, of course, having been begun with Reagan and continued for decades now) resulted in the financial crisis that became the Great Recession and then a Democrat was elected president.  GOP lawmakers suddenly thought deficits were bad (when they were created by Democratic presidents to respond to crisis).  And debt&#8211;which had been spiralling upwards under the Bush regime with increases in debt ceiling hardly noticed&#8211;suddenly was a monster that must be contained.  And all of this could be used by those on the radicalized right every time the debt ceiling had to be increased to extort from those not on the right the right&#8217;s desired changes in social justice programs. </p>
<p>In other words, the radicalized GOP set the conditions in motion that allowed them to hold us hostage now, through their control of the House of Representatives, in an extortion campaign.  In that campaign,  they demand that they get the changes to Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid that they want (the so-called &#8220;reforms&#8221; to so-called &#8220;entitlement&#8221; programs that amount to the beginning of the unraveling of the New Deal that the right so detests) in exchange for their going along with increases to the debt ceiling that are necessary because of the irresponsible tax and spending policies that they pursued while in office or the measures that were necessary to shore up the financial system when it threatened collapse due to the deregulatory push that has gone on for forty years funded by and supported by the right (and some  Dems in the middle as well). </p>
<p>So guess what.  We shouldn&#8217;t be surprised at all to hear today that U.S. House Speaker John Boehner says the GOP rightwingers will maybe agree to some &#8220;revenue&#8221; increases so long as they get their extortion payments&#8211;concessions from liberals that will ultimately lead to the reduction and/or privatization of Social Security and Medicare and other government programs.  And of course this is double-speak anyway, since Boehner and his compatriots on the GOP right still ascribe to the frequently disproven  market fundamentalism that believes that deregulation and &#8220;simplification&#8221; (meaning tax cuts) leads to economic growth that automatically results in revenue increases even without tax changes intended to raise more tax monies. </p>
<p>As Tiron and Rubin note in the Bloomberg piece reporting on Boehner&#8217;s statements, his speech &#8220;sounded conciliatory and didn&#8217;t alter the Republican position on tax policy&#8221; but &#8220;marked the start of political positioning and negotiations over what to do about the so-called fiscal cliff of $607 billion in combined tax increases and spending cuts.&#8221;   He isn&#8217;t agreeing to tax increases: he just wants to be able to use the kind of  manipulative tweaking of the data to get the desired result called &#8220;dynamic scoring&#8221; that the GOP right has been pushing for decades as a way to &#8220;prove&#8221; that their deficit-creating tax cuts really aren&#8217;t costing anything!  See Roxana Tiron and Richard Rubin, <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-07/boehner-would-accept-new-revenue-under-right-conditions-.html">Boehner Would Accept New Revenue under &#8216;Right Conditions&#8217;</a>, Bloomberg.com (Nov. 7, 2012)</p>
<p>Boehner called for concessions, stating &#8220;The president must be willing to reduce spending and shore up entitlement programs that are the primary drivers of our debt.&#8221;  Id.</p>
<p><a href="http://reid.senate.gov/">Harry Reid</a> (Senate majority leader) said &#8220;We&#8217;re happy to deal with entitlements, but we&#8217;re not messing with Social Security.&#8221;  It&#8217;s hard to know for sure what that means&#8211;maybe they are willing to reduce Medicaid and Medicare benefits? Too bad he didn&#8217;t say that we need to expand Obamacare to make it Medicare for all, so that we can get control of health care costs while providing much needed support particularly to the elderly at the end of life.  But at least he did say something that should translate to &#8220;we are not going to change Social Security.&#8221;</p>
<p>So the game is on.  The GOP intends to continue pushing its same old medicine of tax cuts for the rich and entitlement cuts for the rest of us.  I hope the Democrats have gained a little bit of backbone from the election so that they will push for wiser spending on public infrastructure and wiser tax policies in areas from estate and capital gains taxes to corporate subsidies. </p>

                                <div>Three writers point to the need to maintain energy and attention to the Obama Grand Bargain.</div>

<div>Mark Weisbrot at The Guardian writes on <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/nov/07/barack-obama-economic-populism-carries-day">Barack Obama&#8217;s carefully crafted economic populism carries the day</a>:</div>

<blockquote><p>The media are a huge factor in most elections in the US, and outside of Fox News and the rightwing press, most of the major news outlets were more sympathetic to Obama than to Romney. They still helped Romney quite a bit, however, especially with swing voters, with <a href="http://www.cepr.net/beat-the-press/">poor reporting on key economic issues</a>. Most Americans didn&#8217;t know that the federal stimulus had <a href="http://www.frbsf.org/publications/economics/papers/2010/wp10-17bk.pdf">created an estimated 3m jobs</a>; in fact, they didn&#8217;t even distinguish the stimulus from the unpopular federal bank bailout. They didn&#8217;t understand <a href="http://www.cepr.net/index.php/op-eds-&#038;-columns/op-eds-&#038;-columns/obama-health-care-reform-is-a-step-forward-hopefully-toward-medicare-for-all">the benefits that people would derive</a> from Obama&#8217;s healthcare legislation. They didn&#8217;t know that they&#8217;d had their taxes cut under Obama. And millions believed the hype that federal deficit spending and the US public debt were major problems. (For the record, the US currently <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/publication/43288">pays less than 1% of GDP in net interest</a> annually on the federal debt – less than it has paid during the past 60 years.)<br />The confusion on economic issues was probably <a href="http://pewresearch.org/pubs/2364/very-important-registered-voters-issues-priorities-economy-jobs-terrorism-immigration-partisans-deficit-smaller-government-energy-obama-romney-reduce-best-way-swing-medicare">the most important influence</a> on swing voters, who supported Romney against their own economic interests, thinking that the economy might improve if he were elected. For this, and other misunderstandings, we can thank the major media, although we should also include the public relations blunders made by the Obama team. Perhaps the biggest strategic error was<a href="http://www.cepr.net/index.php/op-eds-&#038;-columns/op-eds-&#038;-columns/the-economics-of-social-security-in-the-presidential-race">President Obama&#8217;s refusal</a> to go after <a href="http://www.mittromney.com/issues/social-security">Romney&#8217;s proposal to cut social security</a>, thereby losing the majority of senior citizens&#8217; votes (a big vote in swing states like Virginia and Florida), which he could potentially have won by defending America&#8217;s most popular anti-poverty program.</p></blockquote>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />
<blockquote>Obama&#8217;s silence on social security is a bad omen for the future of his second administration, when – facing almost immediately the &#8220;fiscal cliff&#8221; – political, media, and business leaders will be <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1112/83197.html">pressing for a &#8220;grand bargain&#8221;</a> on budget issues that will screw the vast majority of Americans. It will take a lot of grassroots pressure to prevent the worst outcomes: likewise, to get us out of Afghanistan and to prevent another disastrous war, this time with Iran. Obama&#8217;s <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/robert-naiman/five-specific-questions-j_b_2020214.html">foreign policy has been mostly atrocious</a>and the never-ending <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/plan-for-hunting-terrorists-signals-us-intends-to-keep-adding-names-to-kill-lists/2012/10/23/4789b2ae-18b3-11e2-a55c-39408fbe6a4b_story.html">&#8220;war on terror&#8221; continues to expand</a>, while most Americans&#8217; living standards have been declining.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://therealnews.com/t2/index.php?option=com_content&#038;task=view&#038;id=31&#038;Itemid=74&#038;jumival=9057">Bill Black interview</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Bill BLACK: Yes. The president came into office talking about the possibility of this grand bargain—more than the possibility; this desire reach it. And then he tried to reach it in budget discussions with the Republicans. They refused.</p>
<p>He just a few days ago went and met with the editorial board of <i>The Des Moines Register</i>, the leading newspaper out in that portion of Iowa, and he had a discussion off the record, and emphasized that because it was off the record he could be more blunt, and said that his first course of business, and one that he believed he could get done very quickly should he be reelected, would be to strike a grand bargain. And he described the grand bargain, and there would be $2 in budget cuts for every dollar in increased taxes.<br /> So this grand bargain is: we will weight this much more heavily towards killing social programs, or at least cutting them back significantly and raising taxes on the rich.</p>
<p>Now, that&#8217;s got most of the attention from progressives, but note two other things that he was saying. One, he&#8217;s talking about austerity. He&#8217;s talking about following exactly the kind of model that Europe has followed that put them gratuitously back into recession, and indeed into a Great Depression. And as we&#8217;re doing this interview, it has just come out that European unemployment reached a new high in September, which is the latest month that they had data for. So this has cost millions of Europeans their jobs, and it&#8217;s Great Depression levels of unemployment in Spain and Greece, and growing in many other nations. So this is insane to follow this strategy.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/series/glenn-greenwald-security-liberty">Glenn Greenwald at The Guardian</a>  writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>So the delirium of liberals this morning is understandable: the night could scarcely have gone better for them. By all rights, they should expect to be a more powerful force in Washington. But what are they going to get from it? Will they wield more political power? Will their political values and agenda command more respect? Unless the disempowering pattern into which they have voluntarily locked themselves changes, the answer to those questions is almost certainly &#8220;no&#8221;.<br />Consider the very first controversial issue Obama is likely to manage, even before the glow of his victory dims, literally within the next couple of weeks. It is widely expected &#8211; <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1112/83197.html">including by liberals</a> &#8211; that Obama intends (again) to pursue a so-called &#8220;Grand Bargain&#8221; with the GOP: a deficit- and debt-cutting agreement whereby the GOP agrees to some very modest tax increases on the rich in exchange for substantial cuts to entitlement programs such as social security and Medicare, the crown legislative jewels of American liberalism.</p>
<p>Indeed, Obama <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/in-debt-talks-obama-offers-social-security-cuts/2011/07/06/gIQA2sFO1H_story.html">already sought</a> in his <a href="http://americablog.com/2012/03/obama-wanted-cuts-to-social-security-and-medicare-during-failed-grand-bargain-talks.html">first term</a> to implement <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/07/11/obama-medicare-eligibility-age_n_894833.html">sizable cuts</a> to those programs, but liberals were saved only by GOP recalcitrance to compromise on taxes. In light of their drubbing last night, they are likely to be marginally if not substantially more flexible, which means that such a deal is more possible than ever. </p></blockquote>

<blockquote>It is remarkable that social security hasn&#8217;t been a more issue in the presidential race. After all, Governor Romney has proposed a plan that would imply cuts of more than 40% for middle-class workers just <a href="http://www.mittromney.com/issues/social-security">entering the labor force </a>. Since social security is <a href="http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/%202011/07/21/cnnorc-poll-july-18-21-debt-ceiling/">hugely popular </a>across the political spectrum, it would seem that President Obama could gain an enormous advantage by clearly proclaiming his support for the program.</p>
<p>But President Obama has consistently refused to rise to the defense of social security. In fact, in the first debate, he explicitly took the issue off the table, telling the American people that there is not much difference between his <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rj-eskow/town-hall-debate_b_1965681.html">position</a> on social security and Romney&#8217;s.</p>
<p>On its face, this is difficult to understand. In addition to being good politics, there are also solid policy grounds for defending social security. The social security system is perhaps the greatest success story of any program in US history. By providing a core retirement income, it has lifted tens of millions of retirees and their families out of poverty. It also provides disability insurance to almost the entire workforce. The amount of fraud in the system is minimal, and the administrative costs are <a href="http://www.globalaging.org/pension/us/socialsec/myth.htm">less than </a>one 20th as large as the costs of private-sector insurers. <br /><a name="more"></a><br />In addition, the program is more necessary now than ever. The economic mismanagement of the last two decades has left the baby boomers ill-prepared for retirement – few have traditional pensions. The stock market crashes of the last 15 years <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-callahan/401k-a-perfect-failure_b_1574834.html">have left </a>401(k)s depleted, and the collapse of the housing bubble destroyed much of their housing equity, which has always been the main source of wealth for middle-income families.</p>
<p>It would be great if we had reason to believe that the generations that followed had better retirement prospects, but we don&#8217;t. Even in good times, the 401(k) system does more to enrich the financial industry than to provide a secure retirement income. Any reasonable projection indicates that social security will provide the bulk of retirement income for most middle-class retirees long into the future. In this context, the idea of cutting back benefits, even for younger workers, seems misguided…</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>At the top of the priority list: a promise to forge a bipartisan compromise that reduces rampant government borrowing and makes long-postponed decisions about taxes and spending. In the interview, Obama called a budget deal “one of the best things we can do for the economy.”<br />“We’re going to be in a position where I believe in the first six months we are going to solve that big piece of business,” Obama said. “It will probably be messy. It won’t be pleasant. But I am absolutely confident that we can get what is the equivalent of the grand bargain that essentially I’ve been offering to the Republicans for a very long time, which is $2.50 worth of cuts for every dollar in [taxes], and work to reduce the costs of our health-care programs.”<br />…<br /><a href="http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/members/S000033">Sen. Bernie Sanders</a> (I-Vt.) said he had expressed concerns privately to the White House that Obama appeared to be steering clear of firm promises to protect entitlement programs. “Unlike four years ago,” Sanders said, “the president has not been outspoken in saying he’s not going to cut Social Security.”</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Watching Wednesday night’s presidential debate, you’d have to be a crack political code reader to know what Obama was really saying about Social Security. It was quick. It was subtle. But it was one of the most telling moments of the debate.</p>
<p>First, let’s get a few things straight. Social Security is solvent. It’s America’s most successful retirement plan to date. It’s extremely popular <a href="http://www.iwpr.org/press-room/press-releases/survey-post-recession-americans2019-support-for-social-security-continues-across-party-lines">across party lines </a>. Social Security adds not a penny to the deficit. And, as Nancy Altman <a href="http://www.nextnewdeal.net/deficit-hawks-we-people-know-best-social-security">has argued </a>, it&#8217;s “the poster child for fiscal responsibility.” The program is prudently managed, cost-effective, and carefully monitored.</p>
<p>Obama could have mentioned these facts and cheered the success of a program that Democrats – and all Americans &#8212; should be proud of. Instead, the discussion went like this:</p>
<p>“Lehrer: Do you see a major difference between the two of you on Social Security?</p></blockquote>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />
<blockquote> Obama: You know, I suspect that, on Social Security, we&#8217;ve got a somewhat similar position. Social Security is structurally sound. It&#8217;s going to have to be tweaked the way it was by Ronald Reagan and Speaker &#8212; Democratic Speaker Tip O&#8217;Neill.”</p>
<p>Ladies and gentleman, that was the sound of your president offering to screw you on your retirement. This revealing exchange was followed by some politically strategic talk by both candidates about how current retirees shouldn’t be worried, because, as we all know, their votes are needed in the short term. But the rest of us? Be very, very worried.</p></blockquote>

<p>(Dan here&#8230;Dale Coberly replies to this article (<a href="http://www.economics21.org/commentary/it-becoming-too-late-fix-social-securitys-finances">Is it Becoming Too Late to Fix Social Security&#8217;s Finances?</a>) by Charles Blahous). </p>
<p>Blahous,</p>
<p>You do not seem to grasp how small &#8220;4% of the tax base&#8221; is,  or how very reasonable it would be to pay that 4% for a longer, richer retirement, out of an income that will be more than twice what it is today.</p>
<p>That might be a politically difficult concept where neither side is being honest.  The &#8220;right&#8221; want to cripple Social Security for essentially ideological reasons.  And the &#8220;left&#8221; wants &#8220;the rich&#8221; to pay for Social Security&#8230; for essentially ideological reasons.  But as you note, the essense of Social Security is that the workers pay for it themselves.</p>
<p>Moreover, that 4% can be reached over a period of nearly eighty years.  To do it without ever reaching short term actuarial insolvency would require about a one tenth of one percent increase in the tax (combined) each year starting very soon,  or a one tenth of one percent increase in the tax (for each the worker and his boss) starting in about 2018 and running through abut 2033&#8230;  or some combination.</p>
<p>Further increases of one tenth of one percent (each) would be needed at a decreasing frequency, such that by the end of the 75 year actuarial window, the rate increases would be about one tenth of one percent every ten years&#8230;  again, while wage are projected to be increasing over one full percent per year.</p>
<p>And again, this would be neither a burden nor unfair to the workers.  They would get the money back over a longer retirement, and at a higher standard of living in retirement than current workers.  Moreover they would have at least twice as much money in pocket AFTER paying the tax as they have today.</p>
<p>The problem may indeed be &#8220;political,&#8221;  because neither side is honest enough to recognize this simple solution.</p>

                                <p>Okay, more jargon. But important jargon because the policy proposals are starting from different baselines themselves defined by this jargon. So while some of the following is basic, it is equally a rhetorical (in the classical definition) baseline.</p>
<p>Under current Social Security law future benefits are set by a formula. For a given individual this formula starts from income history but if we take total benefit payouts in the aggregate we have cost totals primarily driven by employment numbers, Real Wage, and CPI. And this aggregate number represents 99% or so of the category that the Report Tables label as &#8220;Cost&#8221;. These projected future benefits are in turn offset by projected income deriving from one main and two minor sources, that is FICA payroll tax, tax on certain benefits, and interest on Trust Fund assets, with the totals being labeled in the Tables as &#8220;Income&#8221;. In an ideal world the trend of projected Income would exceed projected Cost in just the amount needed to maintain a specific, relative level of reserves. This state of affairs for any given year or set of years is called &#8220;actuarial balance&#8221; and if projected to continue beyond the 75 year actuarial window, and with an upward trend is called &#8220;sustainable solvency&#8221;.</p>
<p>As it turns out current mid-range projections of future employment, Real Wage, CPI, payroll income, tax on benefits, and interest on Trust Fund assets do not project &#8220;sustainable solvency&#8221;, instead there is a projected gap between total income and accumulated assets available to pay out future benefits and total projected costs. That is if we simply assume ALL mid-range projections, something that is labeled in the Reports &#8220;Intermediate Cost&#8221;  and follow current law that requires payment of full &#8220;scheduled benefits&#8221; as long as total income and assets allow those benefits to be &#8220;payable&#8221;, at some point the latter level falls below the former. The state in which &#8220;scheduled benefits&#8221; exceeds &#8220;payable&#8221;  can be called &#8220;insolvency&#8221;, or working up the shrillness index &#8220;crisis&#8221; or even &#8220;bankruptcy&#8221;.</p>
<p>But before we start hyperventilating it would be useful to slow down and actually examine the financial and legal implications for actual beneficiaries at this &#8220;crisis&#8221; point. Because one thing we know for sure the end result will NOT be &#8220;no check&#8221;. Maybe not the SAME check on the SAME day, but the system won&#8217;t grind to a complete halt. To see what is likely to happen under current law and realistic political projections you will need to follow under the fold.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />(Lucky you, a computer crash wiped out a bunch of text. So a shorter version.) The takeaway most readers of the Social Security Report would have is that at the point at which projected &#8220;Income&#8221; (which defines &#8220;payable benefit&#8221;) falls below &#8220;Cost&#8221; (which defines &#8220;scheduled benefit&#8221;) current law simply reduces the latter to the former overnight resulting in around an immediate 22-25% cut in benefit checks.</p>
<p>But this is where the two groups I will call fairly neutrally Social Security &#8220;Defenders&#8221; vs &#8220;Reformers&#8221; start talking past each other. While each sees this cut as tremendously disruptive &#8220;Defenders&#8221; see that disruption in the form of Gramma spending her remaining shopping dollars in the Catfood Aisle, while &#8220;Reformers&#8221; see armies of Greedy Geezers storming Capitol Hill in their Lexus&#8217;s demanding their God-given right to pay Country Club dues with their full scheduled Social Security check.</p>
<p>As such their definitions of &#8220;Fix&#8221; and even &#8220;Preserve&#8221; take very different forms.  I like to think of this in the logicians terms of &#8220;direction of fit&#8221;. &#8220;Defenders&#8221; want to &#8220;fix&#8221; Social Security by ensuring that &#8220;payable&#8221; is fitted to &#8220;scheduled&#8221; while reformers prefer fixes that will defuse the crisis by fitting &#8220;scheduled&#8221; to &#8220;payable&#8221;. Both sides would argue that their respective fixes avoid the dreaded &#8220;slash&#8221; in benefits in the interest of &#8220;preserving&#8221; Social Security, it is just that &#8220;Defenders&#8221; are preserving a particular projected standard of living while &#8220;Reformers&#8221; are seeking to preserve a certain political peace, in their terms an avoidance of &#8220;intergenerational warfare&#8221;.</p>
<p>And as a &#8220;Defender&#8221; I am even willing to concede that certain &#8220;Reformers&#8221; are actually sincere. Where I see a perfectly fixable case of &#8220;under funded&#8221; they see an equally fixable case of &#8220;over promised&#8221;.  Which is one of many reasons why the Social Security debate is not really one of numbers, but is really at root one of values and perceived equity. Which is not an argument for civility, just a suggestion that not all &#8220;Reformers&#8221; are liars or fools. Heartless sociopaths willing to use whatever tactics and number twisting they can to keep Greedy Geezers at bay? Sure. Fools? Well not ALL of them. And given a generous interpretation of whether &#8220;scheduled&#8221; or &#8220;payable&#8221; is the correct baseline to build your analysis even liar is too harsh. For some. Who simply consider themselves hard-headed realists.  </p>

<blockquote><p>Eric Laursen is an independent journalist who’s been covering political and financial news for more than a quarter-century. He’s been studying Social Security for the past 15 years, and just published a smart and exhaustive (800-page!) book called <a href="http://www.akpress.org/peoplespension.html">The People’s Pension: The War Against Social Security from Reagan to Obama</a> (AK Press, Spring 2012).</p></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>If you want to put the current struggle over Social Security’s future in context, read this book. Eric chronicles the history of Social Security from the 1930’s to the present, with a special focus on the ideological and political attacks on the system. He starts with the Reagan years and connects the dots to the current efforts to undermine Social Security from the right. (I also recommend highly Nancy Altman’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Battle-Social-Security-Vision-Gamble/dp/0471771724%3FSubscriptionId%3D0EP44N4Z8Y93MBZ1ZC82%26tag%3Ddianerehm-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0471771724">The Battle for Social Security</a>).<br /><strong>ALSO SEE:</strong> <em><a href="http://truth-out.org/opinion/item/10701-peoples-pension-author-social-security-cuts-would-hurt-ethnic-families-most">&#8220;People&#8217;s Pension&#8221; Author: Social Security Cuts Would Hurt Ethnic Families Most</a></em></p></blockquote>

<p>Social Security works:<br />
<blockquote><a href="http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2012/end-of-life-financial-study-0803.html">Study: Many Americans die with ‘virtually no financial assets’, by Peter Dizikes, MIT News Office</a>: It is a central worry of many Americans: not having enough money to live comfortably in old age. Now an innovative paper co-authored by an MIT economist shows that a large portion of America’s older population has very little savings in bank accounts, stocks and bonds, and dies “with virtually no financial assets” to their names.</p>
<p>Indeed, about 46 percent of senior citizens in the United States have less than $10,000 in financial assets when they die. Most of these people rely almost totally on Social Security payments as their only formal means of support, according to <a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w17824">the newly published study</a>, co-authored by James Poterba of MIT, Steven Venti of Dartmouth College, and David A. Wise of Harvard University.</p></blockquote>
