<p>Are the Special Treasuries that make up the Social Security Trust Funds real? Absolutely, quite apart from legal and historical arguments the DI Trust Fund will be cashing in some  $23 billion of them in 2010 along with taking some $9 billion [edit] in interest, their reality is affirmed every time a SS Disability check gets credited to a beneficiaries account each month. QED.</p>
<p>But does that mean that all of those Special Treasuries in the combined Trust Funds will get paid back? Or need to be paid back? Well no, if we fix Social Security in precisely  the right way, those Trust Funds get converted into a discounted interest only loan, and the principal simply rolls over forever. To understand why this should be we can start with the following from Steve Goss, the Chief Actuary of Social Security in his recent article for the Social Security Bulletin <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/ssb/v70n3/v70n3p111.html">The Future Financial Status of the Social Security Program</a><br />
<blockquote>However, the occurrence of a negative cash flow, when tax revenue alone is insufficient to pay full scheduled benefits, does not necessarily mean that the trust funds are moving toward exhaustion. <u>In fact, in a perfectly pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) financing approach, with the assets in the trust fund maintained consistently at the level of a &#8220;contingency reserve&#8221; targeted at one year&#8217;s cost for the program, the program might well be in a position of having negative cash flow on a permanent basis</u>. This would occur when the interest rate on the trust fund assets is greater than the rate of growth in program cost. In this case, interest on the trust fund assets would be more than enough to grow the assets as fast as program cost, leaving some of the interest available to augment current tax revenue to meet current cost. Under the trustees&#8217; current intermediate assumptions, the long-term average real interest rate is assumed at 2.9 percent, and real growth of OASDI program cost (growth in excess of price inflation) is projected to average about 1.6 percent from 2030 to 2080. Thus, if program modifications are made to maintain a consistent level of trust fund assets in the future, interest on those assets would generally augment current tax income in the payment of scheduled benefits.</p></blockquote>
<p> Emphasis mine. I&#8217;ll unpack this a little under the fold.<br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>The first thing needed to understand this is how the Trustees define Trust Fund solvency. For them &#8216;solvency&#8217; means &#8216;one year of cost equivalent in the Trust Fund at the end of each year&#8217;. So if we take the OAS (Old Age/Survivors) Trust Fund in isolation from the DI Trust Fund we get the following projection <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/2010/IV_SRest.html#280816">Table IV.A1.—Operations of the OASI Trust Fund, Calendar Years 2005-19</a> we can see that OAS TF Balances not only vastly exceed OAS Cost for 2011, they also project to continue to do so for the next ten years. Which is why the Trustees are able to report that OAS in isolation meets the test for &#8216;Short Term Actuarial Balance&#8217;. And if you scrolled down the page from that link to Table IV.A3 you would see the same thing is true for combined OASDI. On the other hand if you paused at Table IV.A2 you would see that is decidedly not the case for the DI Trust Fund, it projects to go to a 91% of cost reserve at year end 2014 and to total exhaustion in 2018. Not only does DI fail the ten year test for solvency, it has for some years. So it needs to be fixed and as it turns out we know what the cost of that fix would be over 25 years and over 75 years thus handily achieving short term (10 year) and long term (75) actuarial balance, it would require an increase in FICA devoted to DI of 0.30%.</p>
<p>But that is not the focus of the post. Instead I want to explore how &#8220;a perfectly pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) financing approach&#8221; is consistent with &#8220;negative cash flow on a permanent basis&#8221;. Well Steve explains it but in somewhat condensed fashion. If the U.S. enters a period that experiences an extended period of real growth then Social Security costs increase every year. That is on a nominal dollar basis increases in population, real wage, and inflation, however moderate, add to total program costs. This may or may not also mean an increase in GDP devoted to Social Security which could remain flat, but the year end balances needed to maintain solvency need to be bigger year over year. The following table shows us income excluding interest and cost for the 75 year projection period <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/2010/VI_OASDHI_dollars.html#176345">Table VI.F9.—OASDI and HI Annual Income Excluding Interest, Cost, and Balance in Current Dollars, Calendar Years 2010-85</a> and tells us that projected cost under Intermediate Cost projections will increase from $710 billion in 2010 to $27 TRILLION in 2085. Meaning that for the combined Trust Funds to be judged solvent there would need to be an equivalent $27 trillion in Special Treasuries to offset that.</p>
<p>Well under Intermediate Cost assumptions that is not going to happen, even after we add interest back in. If we roll back to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/2010/VI_OASDHI_dollars.html#150920">Table VI.F8.—Operations of the Combined OASI and DI Trust Funds, in Current Dollars, Calendar Years 2010-85</a> we see interest backfilling the gap and increasing TF balances up to 2027 or so, and then a more or less rapid collapse in balances due to Trust Fund redemption until the TF is exhausted in 2037, exposing SS to a 22-25% cost gap over the rest of the 75 year projection. Note that in this scenario the entirety of the combined Trust Fund principal has to be redeemed over a ten year period from 2027 to 2037 at an average rate of $400 billion a year plus the shrinking yet substantial interest charges. This is what the Wall Street boys really see as the crisis.</p>
<p>But if we look at Low Cost assumptions we see something totally different. Under LC Costs project to be $18 trillion in 2085 but all of that would be offset by $19 trillion of income EXCLUDING interest. This doesn&#8217;t mean the income tax payers get off totally scot free here, there is a period from 2026 to 2050 where a portion of interest accrued still has to be taken in cash, but not all of it, instead that retained portion of the interest simply transforms into Trust Fund principal and starts itself earning interest with the result that the Trust Fund balance goes to $119 trillion (Table F8) which equates to a TF Ratio of 1049, or ten times what is needed for solvency. Not only would this be unnecessary, it is actually problematic, and shows the perils of overfixing Social Security.</p>
<p>So where is the happy median? Well it is in what Steve Goss calls &#8216;sustainable solvency&#8217; which is a Trust Fund with a flat to rising TF ratio at the end of the 75 year period. But what this means in practice is that instead of seeing the TF peak in dollar terms and then go to exhaustion or to have the balance go to ten times what is necessary it would instead need to grow steadily to match the $20 trillion or so in costs for 2085 suggested by that balanced outcome. Which logically means that Trust Fund principal is NEVER cashed in, just rolled over. Moreover and less intuitively it means that income excluding interest  has to be maintained enough below cost to drain off enough accrued interest to keep the rest of that interest from exploding the year end balance. Which is how &#8220;a perfectly pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) financing approach&#8221; = &#8220;negative cash flow on a permanent basis&#8221;</p>
<p>So while the answer to the question are the Special Treasuries in the Trust Fund real obligations of the US Treasury, the answer is &#8216;absolutely&#8217;, shown not just with the current state of DI which is cashing them in as I type, but also because a steady-state Pay-Go requires at least some of the interest accruing to be paid in cash. But not all, a portion of that interest has to be retained and converted to principal to maintain a steady TF Ratio and so sustainable solvency.</p>
<p>Is the principal on what is in effect an interest only loan really a debt to Treasury or the Public it represents? Well that is more a question of language than anything, but the simple fact remains that small changes in revenue today while creating a permanent obligation in the form of cash interest transfers almost totally removes any need to redeem the principal in the Trust Fund over the next 75 years. For example if you examine the spreadsheet underpinning the <a target="_blank" href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=r49_nOHQG4QdHuwcbMGmP0Q">NW Plan for a Real Social Security Fix: 2009 OASDI Trigger</a> you will see the Trust Fund balance hitting its first peak of $4964 billion in 2026 but only redeeming $158 billion in principal until its new low of $4826 in 2035 after which it resumes its steady rise. Discount that ten year $158 billion for inflation and you see this would truly be a non-event</p>
<p>Okay in what way does this also make it &#8216;discounted&#8217;. Well simple enough, the interest retained to maintain sustainable solvency is not financed out of the then current economy, instead it comes in the form of newly created Special Treasuries. And since it is then part of the sustainable solvency principal that never has be be cashed in if normal growth continues the real cost to the economy is the difference between the Real Interest Rate of 2.9% and the Real Cost increase of 1.6%, or less than half of the rate on the face of the note.</p>
<p>Under the NW Plan we deliver 100% of benefits, achieve sustainable solvency, and relieve capital of the need to ever pay back the principal they borrowed, all at zero up front cost to the wealthy. All they have to do is to agree to pay heavily discounted to face of the note interest on the money they borrowed and continue to borrow though 2023.  Who exactly is sucking the tits of the milk cow in this scenario?</p>

                                <p><a target="_blank" href="http://econospeak.blogspot.com/2010/09/dr-doom-does-doo-doo.html">Prof Barkley Rosser</a> expresses irritation with suggestions of pay roll cuts as stimulus:</p>
<blockquote><p>In yesterday&#8217;s WaPo, accessible as one of Mark Thoma&#8217;s general links, http://www.economistsview.typepad.com , Nouriel Roubini sounded very reasonable for anyone addressing the utterly corrupt and degraded &#8220;catfish&#8221; deficit commission soldouts. He proposed a cut in payroll taxes, to be made revenue neutral by following through on the Bush-mandated end of his own tax cut for those earning more than a quarter of a million a year.</p></blockquote>
<p>Bruce Webb in comments lifted from Econospeak:</p>
<blockquote><p>The problem with Roubini and a bunch of left commentators is that they keep coming up with solutions to the wrong problem. Yes we should work to make the tax system more progressive. No we shouldn&#8217;t devote those extra revenues to Social Security.</p>
<p>One is the reason Dale brings up, Social Security was set up on an insurance model for very sound reasons.</p>
<p>Two is Rosser&#8217;s Equation. Although few people understand this CBO has calculated that 45% of future growth in Social Security costs is due to the formula that has its real benefits as measured in purchasing power growing over time. And as it turns out growing enough that even the projected 22% cut at Trust Fund Depletion still would leave a better real benefit than today. Yes we can and should take steps to shore up those benefits, but not at the cost of taking opportunities to use restored tax progressivity to address a whole bunch of other priorities more pressing than a nominal cut to benefits 27 years from now which may or may not be necessary anyway.</p>
<p>It kills me that in a world where the wealthy are fighting to the death to avoid a restoration of Clinton era top rates that people blithely suggest we can just slap on 4 or 6 or 12.4% on and dedicate it to Social Security. Which won&#8217;t need the money for years. Not only is this not productive, it simply feeds the narrative that somehow Social Security is the biggest problem facing us when in reality it should be far down the priority list.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />Plus addressing the biggest challenge we have today, which is high unemployment that threatens to become structural has the side effect of fixing Social Security along the way. There is nothing about SS that can&#8217;t be fixed with 5% unemployment and 1.5% real wage, achieve that and money rolls in the door to the Trust Funds. I think they call that &#8216;Win Win&#8217;.</p></blockquote>
<p>Prof. Barley Rosser lifted from comments as well:</p>
<blockquote><p>Let me say that I probably overdid it in terms of hyperbolically picking on Roubini, whom I mostly respect. It may have been frustration that someone like that was falling for something like this, although the analytics if one could have the politicians behaving are correct: temporarity cutting the fica tax while eliminating the Bush tax cuts for high income folks could be a revenue neutral way of providing some fiscal stimulus. But one could achieve the same result by simply further cuts in income taxes for lower income people.</p>
<p>There is a huge amount of politics behind this, clearly. One can go back to the last period of the Bush presidency when there was a push by Dem Kent Conrad, then Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee along with some high level people in the Bush adminstration to impose a simultaneous benefit cut with a tax increase on the social security system, it being thought this was the only way to sell a tax increase. That got squashed by Cheney, who maintained the &#8220;no tax increases&#8221; mantra, along with Grover Norquist et al. But the ghost of that, that somehow Social Security is the easy target for reducing the deficit continues to haunt us.</p></blockquote>

<p>(A contest with no prizes, AB doesn&#8217;t have fundraisers or sell t-shirts and is lucky if ad money keeps the servers on. And this is just a solo effort by me anyway.)</p>
<p>&#8216;Catfood Commission&#8217; or alternately &#8216;Cat Food Commission&#8217; apparently started as a lefty-blogger in-joke but has since caught on in a big way, to the point that it is moving the messaging on Social Security. For example below the fold you will find an invite to a counterprotest in DC that hit my in-box specifically using this theme. And note they don&#8217;t even have to explain the reference directly, this one went viral in a big way. So who gets credit?</p>
<p>Early contenders are Digby of Hullabaloo and Jane Hamsher of FireDogLake but they might have just picked it up from their commenters or bloggers. A preliminary search on &#8216;Catfood Commission&#8217; turns up this one from Lambert at CorrenteWire on June 16th, but already seems to be assumed to be familiar to the sites readership <a target="_blank" href="http://www.correntewire.com/cat_food_commission_strategic_default_rich">Cat Food Commission is strategic default by the rich</a>. I&#8217;ll be poking around and updating as I find earlier cites, others can put candidates in the comments. But somebody deserves credit for this one.</p>
<p>(Update 1) So far it looks like Jane may have conceptual credit, she drew the connection between the Peterson inspired Fiscal Responsibility Commission that was supposed to come out of the Fiscal Responsibility Summit all the way back in Feb 2009. <a target="_blank" href="http://firedoglake.com/2009/02/18/hedge-fund-billionaire-pete-peterson-key-speaker-at-obama-fiscal-responsibility-summit-will-tell-us-all-why-little-old-ladies-must-eat-cat-food-so-social-security-can-be-saved">Hedge Fund Billionaire Pete Peterson Key Speaker At Obama “Fiscal Responsibility Summit,” Will Tell Us All Why Little Old Ladies Must Eat Cat Food</a>. But I am still interested in finding the first citation of &#8216;Catfood Commission&#8217; specifically referring to the Obama Commission.</p>
<p>Update 2) A search at Digby shows she drew the same conceptual connection a few days after Jane but first seemed to use the label &#8216;Catfood Commission&#8217; in connection with the attempt to attach Conrad-Gregg to the Debt Limit Bill in this post from Nov 12, 2009 <a target="_blank" href="http://digbysblog.blogspot.com/2009/11/its-baaaack-by-digby-not-that-it-ever.html">It&#8217;s Baaaack</a><br />

<p>Want to make the move from wanking to wonking on Social Security finance and policy? Consider the following list.</p>
<p>First read an Annual Report, you don&#8217;t need to understand every number but you do need some grounding in the terms and concepts. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/2010/trTOC.html">2010 Trustees Report</a></p>
<p>Then fill out your knowledge with this really excellent explanation from current SSA Chief Actuary Steve Goss <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/ssb/v70n3/v70n3p111.html">The Future Financial Status of the Social Security Program</a></p>
<p>Now for a little something from supporters of traditional Social Security <a target="_blank" href="http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/035468.html">Baker and Weisbrot (1999): Social Security: the Phony Crisis</a></p>
<p>Read the comprehensive case AGAINST traditional Social Security <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cato.org/pubs/journal/cj3n2/cj3n2.html">Cato Journal (Fall 1983): Social Security: Continuing Crisis or Real Reform</a> (pay particular attention to Butler and Germanis&#8217;s &#8220;Leninist Strategy&#8221;)</p>
<p>For some real heavy lifting advanced students can read through the following sections of the Analytical Perspectives on the Budget (OMBs official explanation of the President&#8217;s Budget). <a target="_blank" href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2011/assets/concepts.pdf">Ch. 11 Budget Concepts and Budget Process (pdf)</a> (note in particular the Glossary starting on pg. 131). The following will give a good guide to the rest <a target="_blank" href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2011/assets/list.pdf">Analytical Perspectives: List of Tables and Charts</a>. The LOT starts on page vii and gives you a guide to chapter titles including Ch. 5 Long Term Budget Outlook, Ch. 6 Federal Borrowing and Debt, and Ch 27 Trust Funds and Federal Funds.</p>
<p>Then you can cross check OMB with the latest versions of these two annual documents from CBO: <a target="_blank" href="http://cboblog.cbo.gov/?p=1263">Long Term Budget Outlook (via CBO  Director&#8217;s blog)</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/104xx/doc10457/08-07-SocialSecurity_Update.pdf">CBO’s Long-Term Projections for <br />Social Security: 2009 Update</a> (2010 version is late this year).</p>
<p>Then to pull all this together with the current policy debate you can read the long version of CBO&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cbo.gov/doc.cfm?index=11580">Social Security Policy Options</a>. If you are short on time you can just read the Summary version, but the long version gives a very comprehensive explanation of Social Security overall, and taken with the Goss article above really fills out the picture.</p>
<p>And I would be remiss if I didn&#8217;t add this link from SSA.gov. The real meat starts about half way through <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/history/briefhistory3.html">Historical Background and Development of Social Security</a></p>
<p>No not all of this is the most thrilling read ever. On the other hand not a word of any of it is filtered through me. Heck that should make it worth it right there! Call it &#8216;Social Security Sans Webb&#8217;. Snark aside, those who work their way through even most of this will be heads and shoulders above 99% of commenters out there. And everyone feel free to make additions to the list in comments.</p>

<p>A curious feature of the battle over Social Security is that it is almost always a battle of adjectives and adverbs and not numbers, In particular almost everyone agrees that &#8216;Nothing&#8217; is not a plan, People are not always clear on the consequences of &#8216;Nothing&#8217; whether that be &#8216;massive&#8217; benefit cuts or &#8216;devastating&#8217; program cuts or just the Invisible Bond Vigilantes burning down our fiscal house but everyone just assumes its going to be bad. Real bad. Horribly really bad. Because only morons don&#8217;t understand that Something has to be done: benefit cuts or retirement age changes or cap increases or means testing but Something!!</p>
<p>Well call me Moron. Or maybe Guy That Has Read the Report and Wonders What the Shouting is About. Maybe that still adds up to Moron, but can we at least start with official numbers and methodology?</p>
<p>The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/2010/trTOC.html">2010 Report of the Trustees of Social Security </a>was released on August 5th, a little over four months late from the normal release date of Mar. 31. Is that late release important? Well no, there is probably a back story but in light of the actual reporting it is not of much significance, because the bottom line is as follows:<br />
<blockquote>For the short range (2010-2019), the Trustees measure financial adequacy by comparing projected assets at the beginning of each year to projected program cost for that year under the intermediate set of assumptions. A trust fund ratio of 100 percent or more — that is, assets at the beginning of each year at least equal to projected cost for the year — is a good indication of a trust fund’s ability to cover most short-term contingencies. The projected trust fund ratios for OASI alone, and for OASI and DI combined, under the intermediate assumptions exceed 100 percent throughout the short-range period and therefore OASI and OASDI satisfy the Trustees’ short-term test of financial adequacy. However</p></blockquote>
<p> We&#8217;ll get back to that &#8216;however&#8217; but the fact is that Social Security passes the ten year test for solvency, the same ten year test used by OMB and CBO and Congress to measure just about every other aspect of federal spending. So if the issue isn&#8217;t solvency of Social Security itself maybe it is the projected damage to the overall deficit. Well no, under the rules that govern Social Security any year in which Trust Fund balances are positive scores as equally positive for deficit calculations and if we examine the appropriate table <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/2010/IV_SRest.html#271967">Table IV.A3.—Operations of the Combined OASI and DI Trust Funds, Calendar Years 2005-19</a> we can see that the combined Trust Funds are scheduled to increase from $2.6 trillion to $3.3 trillion in 2015 (the target date for the Obama Deficit Commission) to $3.9 trillion in 2019 and the end of the projection period. Now opinions vary on whether we are in imminent risk of attack by the Invisible Bond Banshees, but offhand you wouldn&#8217;t think a ten year surplus of $1.3 trillion was actual banshee bait, so you can&#8217;t explain this away as deficit hysteria, using the standard window for judging these matters Social Security is doing just fine. So why are conservatives demanding that we impose cost controls NOW, NOW, NOW while progressives are countering with RAISE THE CAP. A LOT. YESTERDAY. Well unfortunately the answer is easy. The former crowed is studiously ignoring the numbers and most of the latter never actually looked at them to start with. Because once you engage with the numbers you too will see why &#8216;Nothing&#8217; is a perfectly fine plan for Social Security is the short run while our plan (natch) is perfect for the medium to long term. Which no doubt sounds like pure arrogance on our part. Well maybe, but it is informed arrogance, and I&#8217;ll try to share some of that information under the fold.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />So we have a situation where combined OASDI satisfies the Trustees test for &#8216;Short Term Actuarial Balance&#8217; and is projected to have a ten year surplus of $1.3 trillion so clearly we can exhale a little, the sky is not falling, not if you use official numbers, and whatever threat there may be is somewhere over that ten year horizon. Which brings us to our first important dividing point. Is a $3.9 trillion 2019 Trust Fund Balance in real terms an asset? Or a liability? Is it a fund we can draw on, or a debt we have to redeem? And the answer to all four questions is &#8220;Yes&#8221;. Which ones you would emphasize depends on where you sit.</p>
<p>(Okay first thing out of the box. The Special Treasuries that make up the Social Security Trust Funds are real as real, there is nothing phony about them, and if you think different YOU are the moron. Or a liar. Or worse. See you in comments because all the arguments to the contrary are just Cato and AEI bullshit. Full stop.)</p>
<p>Having settled that point for the moment, we can see that the projected $3.9 trillion in the 2019 Trust Fund is an asset from the prospective of current and future retirees, but a liability from the perspective of current workers and taxpayers (not the same thing), and that there is some substantial overlap. But not total overlap because the asset has been built up from one income stream, that of FICA payroll taxes while the payback has to come from another, that of income tax or borrowing from the public and the incidence of those taxes all inequally. For example returns on capital are not subject to FICA and so contributed nothing to the build up but are exposed to income tax and so are liable for some of the payback. Which fact frankly is the source of much of the tension here. And ultimately will raise the question of whether this whole kerfluffle is really about solvency? Or servicing costs? For the moment I want to keep the focus on solvency.</p>
<p>Okay so we have established that by official measures Social Security meets the ten year solvency test so problems on that front if any are somewhere over that horizon. To find out how large that problem might be we need to consult the following table from the 2010 Report. It shows the outlook for OASI (Old Age/Survivors) and DI (Disability) separately and combined into OASDI over a probability range from uniformly optimistic (Low Cost) to uniformly pessimistic (High Cost) economic and demographic projections. Since it is unlikely that all of the relevant variables would move in the same way there is a certain artificiality to Low Cost and High Cost but the Trustees have supplied reasonable tools to measure that uncertainty and we can be reliably certain that the probable outcome will be somewhere in the confidence interval. Those who want to check the analysis can be my guest: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/2010/trTOC.html">2010 Report: Sec VI.D and E</a>. In the meanwhile we will be looking at these numbers: <a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/TIJr4pc4c1I/AAAAAAAAAZo/hEd29JEtDn0/s1600/2010+IV.B4.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/TIJr4pc4c1I/AAAAAAAAAZo/hEd29JEtDn0/s400/2010+IV.B4.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />Having seen that the Trustees test for short term actuarial balance is measured over ten years,  we can see here that the test for long term balance is seventy five years, supplemented since 2003 with another test over the infinite horizon. And under Intermediate Cost (i.e. median) assumptions the actuarial deficit for combined OASDI is 1.92% of payroll. Meaning that an immediate boost in payroll tax of that amount would deliver us to 2084 having been able to pay 100% of scheduled benefits and with a full one year reserve in the Trust Fund. But there are a lot of &#8216;ifs&#8217; buried in that two decimal point precision, because the actual spread runs from +0.59% to -5.26% of payroll, meaning there is some chance that Social Security left alone would actually be OVER funded going forward with a larger chance of it being even more underfunded than that 1.92% suggests. Gosh darn it, who knew that the future was actually unknowable? So what if we reel it back a bit and look only 50 years out. Hmm a narrower range of +0.55% to -4.00% but still kind of wide. 25 years out? +1.12% to -1.86%.</p>
<p>So what does this blizzard of numbers tell us? Well a number of things. For one thing even under our most optimistic set of assumptions there is a dropoff after 25 years as Social Security drops from a 1.12% of payroll surplus down to 0.55%. That is Boomers do exist and will exert maximum impact on the system in the 2030s as trailing edge 1964&#8217;s hit 67 in 2031. Nothing short of product roll-out of Soylent Green is going to forestall that. On the other hand there is a measurable chance that Social Security left unchanged would STILL dodge that bullet and allow full payout of benefits with a small margin to spare, so there is no reason to over react and by the way no reason at all to pay attention to infinite future numbers. Already at 25 years we are look at a +/- 1.35%, subscribing to a package of benefit cuts/tax increases of 3.5% (the infinite future IC gap) being frankly nutty in light of the probability spread.</p>
<p>Adding all of this up is &#8216;Nothing&#8217; the perfect plan? Well no, there is a better than even chance that the demographic realities of the 2030s and early 2040s demand that &#8216;Something&#8217; be done. But what that &#8216;Something&#8217; is depends on how you frame that demand. If the real problem is an inability to deliver full benefits then the answer is to put in place plans to bolster the system if and when. On the other hand if the perceived problem is the DEMAND for full benefits to crowd out other spending priorities then the answer is to find some way to mitigate the shock of Trust Fund depletion and subsequent reset of benefits if and when.</p>
<p>Which brings us to the crux. It seems the main concern of the Catfood Commission is that greedy geezers will demand full benefits no matter what and that the answer is to start transitioning retirees from eating the occasional steak to  homemade Beef Stroganoff to Hamburger Helper to Fancy Feast to Kibble so that there is no trouble once the Trust Fund goes to exhaustion, the solution to being electrocuted on the Third Rail of American Politics is just to drain the juice out slowly. Because clearly their concern is not benefit cuts at Depletion as such, I don&#8217;t see any plans which aim to deliver some intermediate result BETTER than that you get from &#8216;Nothing&#8217;, all their &#8216;Somethings&#8217; require retiree give backs over the status quo. Which is why I say that &#8216;Nothing&#8217; is STILL a better plan than the choices we are being offered, and that is true even if we are thrown some scraps of &#8216;People Food&#8217; in the form of cap increases, in the end kibble with a little chum salmon on top is still dog and cat food (Alaskan natives keep the chinook/King and coho/Silver for themselves and unless pressed feed the chum/Dog to, well the dogs).</p>
<p>Many progressives out there believe that the answer to Social Security &#8216;crisis&#8217; is simple enough even a Moran (sic) like me should grasp it-just raise the cap. Which ignores a couple of realities. One there is ZERO chance that you will get any change in the cap that doesn&#8217;t come with giveaway&#8217;s on the benefit side. Zero, zip, nada. You need four Republican votes from the Deficit Commission for ANY deal and you can bet anything you like that they will extract something. If only because they have no real interest in fixing Social Security in any meaningful way, they don&#8217;t want it to be seen as a successful government program delivering real benefits to workers, that doesn&#8217;t serve their agenda even the tiniest bit, the right answer to any Social Security offer coming out of this Commission is 99.9% likely to be &#8220;No Deal!&#8221;, no matter how attractive the bait on the hook. Under the current environment the best plan on the policy table is the tried and true plan: &#8216;Nothing&#8217;.</p>
<p>Which leaves careful readers two objections. &#8220;Bruce you said &#8216;Nothing&#8217; was only the &#8216;2nd Best Plan&#8217; . And what about that &#8216;However&#8217; from the Trustees you said we would get back to&#8221;. Okay you got me. While &#8216;Nothing&#8217; is better than almost all the likely &#8216;Somethings&#8217; out there even the 25 year OASDI numbers suggest a bias towards some action to action even if it doesn&#8217;t have to be tomorrow. And if we break out OASI and DI we can see why the Trustees appended that &#8216;However&#8217;. Back to the 2010 Report.<br />
<blockquote>However, the DI Trust Fund fails the Trustees’ short-term test of financial adequacy. Its trust fund ratio is projected to fall below the 100 percent level by the beginning of 2013. After 2013, the DI trust fund ratio continues to decline until the trust fund is exhausted in 2018.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ouch. DI is currently bleeding and badly, in fact if we consult Table IV.B4 again we can see that its 25 year actuarial deficit is 0.30% and in fact accounts for ALL of the combined 25 year gap of 0.25% plus some. While &#8216;Nothing&#8217; is a perfectly defensible plan for Old Age/Survivors it just won&#8217;t do for Disability, there we need a &#8216;Something&#8217; and if anything we need it yesterday. Which brings us to a curious fact, there is a near perfect alignment betweeen the 25 year actuarial gap for combined OASDI and DI and the 75 year gap for DI in isolation: 0.25%, 0.30%, 0.30%. Meaning we can install a 75 year fix for DI which will also give us a 25 year fix for combined OASDI. Gosh if only someone had run some numbers and got us a &#8216;Something&#8217; we can believe in.

                                <p>by Bruce Webb</p>
<p>Regular readers of Angry Bear will be familiar with bond trader turned blogger Bruce Krasting and his, can we say non-standard conclusions about Social Security solvency. Well he is at it again today under the provocative title of <a target='_blank"' href="http://brucekrasting.blogspot.com/2010/09/sstf-steve-gosss-bombshell-what-could.html">SSTF &#8211; Steve Goss’s Bombshell – What Could it Mean?</a>. SSTF means Social Security Trust Fund, Steve Goss is the Chief Actuary of Social Security, and I am going to tell you what it could mean. Below the fold (because the answer is &#8216;not much&#8217; and I hate to waste the screen space.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />Those who choose can start with Krasting&#8217;s piece then return, or you can start with my deconstruction of the back story.</p>
<p>My version. Edward Schumacher-Matos, an Op-Ed columnist for the WaPo penned a column called <a target="_blank" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/02/AR2010090202673.html">How illegal immigrants are helping Social Security</a>. An interesting piece well worth reading, I have no bone to pick with Mr. Schumacher-Matos. He sets up the story with this in paragraphs 2 and 3.<br />
<blockquote>In response to a research inquiry for a book I am writing on the economics of immigration, Stephen C. Goss, the chief actuary of the Social Security Administration and someone who enjoys bipartisan support for his straightforwardness, said that by 2007, the Social Security trust fund had received a net benefit of somewhere between $120 billion and $240 billion from unauthorized immigrants.</p>
<p>That represented an astounding 5.4 percent to 10.7 percent of the trust fund&#8217;s total assets of $2.24 trillion that year. The cumulative contribution is surely higher now. Unauthorized immigrants paid a net contribution of $12 billion in 2007 alone, Goss said.</p></blockquote>
<p> First thing to note is that the initiative in on the part of the columnist who in the process of research asked a question of the Office of the Chief Actuary which has the final word on such things. And Steve answered using 2007 numbers. Why 2007? Well because the last time that Social Security took a deep look at this subject was during the preparation of the 2008 Report. And they found that the positive impact on long-term solvency from &#8216;other immigrants&#8217; (i.e. illegals) was much larger than previously estimated, enough to move the actuarial gap a positive 0.30%, a VERY big change in the Social Security context and enough to offset other changes so that the overall gap dropped from 1.95% in 2007 to 1.70% in 2008, good news for those of us who were bracing for bad news in 2009 and 2010. The technical discussion from the Report can be found here: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/IV_LRest.html#154458">2008 Report Sec IV.7: 7. Reasons for Change in Actuarial Balance From Last Report</a>. What was the import of this finding? Well it significantly altered the cost of a long-term fix. And as Schumacher-Matos points out might have this think a little deeper about the actual economic effects of illegals who are more often thought of as drags on social spending rather than subsidizers of middle class retirement. But it didn&#8217;t really have any impact on the Trust Funds in the short run, FICA taxes were collected on illegals performing work that in their absense would have largely been done by legal immigrants or citizens who themselves were paying taxes (and because of the wage suppression enabled by hiring illegals probably at a higher rate).</p>
<p>Well as far as I can see the story could stop  there. Columnist asks question of Chief Actuary, Chief Actuary supplies publicly available data mostly from the 2008 Social Security Report, columnist writes story pointing out the positive impact of immigration in this relatively narrow area of policy.</p>
<p>But that is not what Krasting sees. Oh no this is a &#8220;bombshell&#8221; dropped by Goss at the instigation of the Obama WH to advance the latter&#8217;s immigration agenda.<br />
<blockquote>SS has been collecting money from illegal aliens for years. They will keep the money they have collected and they will not pay out any benefits (except fraud) in the future. So this money is “free”. I have often wondered how big the numbers on this are. Now we know. The numbers are enormous. Without the Free Money coming in from illegal aliens SS would look much different than we &#8220;think&#8221; it does.</p></blockquote>
<p> Krasting maybe you should have asked. It is called the &#8216;Earnings Suspense File&#8217; and while I didn&#8217;t know the number off the top of my head reader Nancy Ortiz certainly did when asked awhile ago, and this thing called &#8216;Google&#8217; turns up all kinds of relevant results. This wasn&#8217;t the big secret you imply and its release was not remotely in the realm of a bombshell. But no matter, our hero presses on.<br />
<blockquote>The WaPo had an article on this today. They had hard numbers (sort of) in the article. I was absolutely stunned that the source of this information was Steve Goss, the chief actuary of the SSTF. Some thoughts/numbers:</p>
<p>-Steve Goss does not reveal information of this significance unless he has a political agenda of his own, or he was told to.</p></blockquote>
<p> Or unless he is asked by a columnist for a national newspaper of record for freely available public information for the purposes of writing a book. These aren&#8217;t state secrets, I have copies of the 2008 Report lying around somewhere and on my hard drive. Finding the resultant totals in the Trust Fund is not difficult. And this is where Krasting goes right off the rails.<br />
<blockquote>-This information is an unmitigated disaster for SS. It comes a month after the release to Congress of their annual report that suggested that things had actually improved for SS over the past 12 months. The report did not highlight the fact that over $300b of assets held by the Fund were in fact contributions from illegal aliens. As much as 13% of the Funds holdings are tainted. Without this funny money the Fund would today be running substantial deficits. That red ink would force major changes in both payouts and taxes. </p></blockquote>
<p> In what way is this money &#8216;tainted&#8217;? At least from Social Security&#8217;s standpoint. Social Security collects taxes from all kinds of people it knows will never qualify for benefits, just about everyone that works for wages pays FICA, and if you are a Briton who over the course of your career only worked 32 quarters or the equivalent of eight years in America, well then we take your money and say &#8216;Thanks&#8217;.  Same if you are a stay-at-home spouse who only occassionally have taken employment outside the house, that  five years you worked before the kids started coming along? Well that&#8217;s FICA under the bridge. If the case of illegals most if not all of the work would have been performed by legals or citizens, many of whom might equally not compile 40 quarters of eligibility. Would that money have been equally &#8216;tainted&#8217;?</p>
<p>Look we know that American employers have been exploiting illegals for their own financial benefit for decades. Now it turns out that that exploitation is also good for the bottom line for Social Security solvency and delays the time when income tax payers are going to have to start paying back the money they borrowed from the Trust Fund. And citizens and legal immigrants bear the cost in current wages not earned and future benefit reductions due to the crowding out of the labor market due to illegals. And for the long term health of labor maybe we need to press forward in an effort to transform illegals into legals either by naturalization or replacement so that every American worker gets every dime of Social Security they worked for. And yeah that might cost the system a few hundred billion over the next century or so. But somehow Krasting makes the jump from the inequity, if such it is, of retaining this income to claim that it is actually not income at all.<br />
<blockquote>-Goss provided a range of the cumulative impact to SS of $120-240b (as of 2007). He said that the overstatement was $12b in 2007. Those numbers do no not add up in my opinion.</p></blockquote>
<p> Danger Wil Robinson! Danger! Krasting math ahead. So BK  does his own calculations and dismisses the opinion of the Chief Actuary in favor of his own calculated number of $350 bn.<br />
<blockquote>I won’t (now) go into the longer-term impacts to SS of having overstated its surplus by $350b. That number is 13.5% of the assets of the Fund. I will say that this is a sea change event for how we look at SS. All prior analysis and all future expectations must now be revisited. I assure you that the results after excluding the illegal taxes will be will prove to be a major blow to the solvency of the Fund. It will change the debate on SS. It is that significant.</p></blockquote>
<p> In Krasting&#8217;s mind. But how is this even an &#8216;overstatement&#8217;? Whether you peg the total at $120 bn or $350 bn, it exists and is legally available to pay benefits going forwards.<br />
<blockquote>-We know that the actuaries at the Fund have been aware of the magnitude of this issue for a very long time. The question I have is, “What did they do about it?” We need to understand what this means in terms of anticipated future benefit payments. There are two possibilities:</p>
<p>(1) The Fund knew the money was from illegal workers but chose to close their eyes. For the purposes of calculating future liabilities they assumed that everyone, including the illegal workers, would someday get benefits. But they won’t. This would imply that the future liabilities of the Fund are much smaller than has been projected. This “good” news would have to be offset with the reality that the “true” assets of the fund are significantly overstated.</p>
<p>(2) The Fund knew all along that the benefits that are associated with these illegal receipts are never going to be paid and therefore it has reduced the liabilities associated with this to some degree. This would essentially make a fraud of all of the SS accounting. I doubt (hope) that this is not the case. To restate both assets and liabilities would create a very big credibility gap for SS. </p></blockquote>
<p> &#8220;What did they do about it?&#8221; Well they publicly reported the results of their new analysis in the 2008 Trustees Report and then adjusted the projected actuarial gap by  a massive (in context) 0.30% of payroll. The combined change of 0.25% of payroll (1.95% to 1.70%) dwarfed adjustments in previous Reports, (though matched in the other direction by the initial impact of ongoing recession with the 2009 Report). To equate the 2008 restatement  with &#8220;chose to close their eyes&#8221; is ridiculous, instead everything happened in the light of day. At least if you were paying attention all along. Krasting then finishes up by proposing a couple of scenarios about how the &#8220;$350 billion&#8221; over-statement could be handled, ignoring only two things:</p>
<p>One the $350 bn is his number and not anyone elses. And two it would see that the &#8216;restatement&#8217; was already done in 2008 with the adjustment in actuarial gap due to this new finding being 0.30% of payroll, which is a big number indeed when projected over the 75 year actuarial window. Sorry BK, those horses got out of the barn two and a half years ago.</p>

                                <p>by Bruce Webb</p>
<p>When I first started paying serious attention to Social Security reporting back in 1997 I was struck by its curious mix of precision and fluidity and how that mix moved from the latter to the former as you went from the data tables to the top line numbers and then on to whatever coverage the Report received by the media. That is by the time the numbers hit the New York Times everything was in declarative mode &#8220;The Trustees project the Trust Fund WILL go to Depletion in year X unless taxes are increased by 2.xy%&#8221;. But when you examine the actual Report in detail you find that &#8216;year X&#8217; and &#8216;2.xy%&#8217; are simply mid-points of a probability distribution. Worse when you examine the Reports on a year over year basis you find that that mid-point changes in ways that can whip the long-term probability tail significantly. Yet in the reporting there is always the unstated assumption that THIS year&#8217;s data set is closer to projecting the next 75 years than last year&#8217;s set. And there are pragmatic reasons for that, for one thing we have that extra year of historical data to work with and for another you have to start with something but the downside is that it installs a certain sense of fatalism, that the numbers are what they are and that we are all more or less helpless victims of them. Well the truth is a little different, there are reasons why the mid-point number falls where it does each year and why it changes year over year, and some of those reasons are subject to intervention, we can and do make changes in the present that move those future numbers.  </p>
<p>So between changes in policy and variations in the economic inputs the uncertainty going forward simply gets wider and wider both within OAS and DI projections and between them, by the time you get thirty and forty years out you are talking very wide probability bands. Yet the rules of the game are set in a way that we are more or less forced to work with the 75 year projection. Which is frankly a little silly particularly in the case of Social Security where the danger of a fix that is too big is actually greater than one which is too small, something I discussed in number 10 of the original Angry Bear SS series <a target="_blank" href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2008/05/bw-on-soc-sec-x-danger-of-low-cost.html">The Danger of Low Cost</a></p>
<p>The first step towards curing this schizophrenia is in recognizing that it is mostly induced. The economists who fuel the studies that drive the apparent need for Social Security &#8216;reform&#8217; are fully aware of the uncertainties but choose to ignore them because the longer time frames allow them to use scarier numbers to urge more drastic solutions. But we don&#8217;t have to be bound by that, instead we can sit down, examine the models and determine pragmatically when they begin to diverge enough to call for different initial policy choices. If I had to pick a number it would be fifteen years out. By that point each of the three models deployed by the Trustees has reached its ultimate numbers when expressed in percentage form, the Office of the Actuary not deceiving themselves into thinking they can model precise changes to things like productivity on a year to year basis after even year eight or nine. And the Reports give us enough numbers that we could choose 2025 as our planning horizon, but since after ten years the data is only reported at five year intervals going fifteen years out from 2011 or 2012 gets more problematic. On the other hand the Trustees do supply a convenient moving 25 year number, and one where there is already enough variation between the top and bottom of the models to justify drawing the line for planning purposes. See Table IV.B4 below the fold.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/TIJr4pc4c1I/AAAAAAAAAZo/hEd29JEtDn0/s1600/2010+IV.B4.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/TIJr4pc4c1I/AAAAAAAAAZo/hEd29JEtDn0/s400/2010+IV.B4.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />I think it is apparent why I would prefer fifteen year planning windows, already by 2034 the distribution is from -1.86% of payroll for High Cost to +1.12% for Low Cost. Also worth noting is that OAS in isolation is under Intermediate Cost in almost perfect balance over 25 years at +0.05%, additional evidence that a solid short to medium term plan of &#8216;Nothing&#8217; is still ideal for OAS. On the other hand even under the most optimistic model entertained by the Trustees DI barely would inch into positive territory, the chance of a 0.30% fix now sending it into overfunded territory before we could rebalance things being pretty remote indeed.</p>
<p>But in any event it is pretty crucial to get analysts and reporters to grasp that these models are not static and that successive Report years don&#8217;t necessarily get us closer to a full understanding, instead the inherent uncertainty of future economic developments will always swamp refinements of the methodology. While we can expect the Office of the Chief Actuary to do their best, we have to keep in mind that every pronouncement about the future outlook of Social Security needs to have a whole set of &#8220;if and only if&#8221;&#8216;s attached to it and the best we can do is to lob solutions somewhere near the center of the spread.</p>

                                <p>This is the title of a post of a diary at another site, one of no particular interest on its own because it just puts people on the wrong road.</p>
<p>A straight out analysis of the economic numbers underlying Social Security &#8216;crisis&#8217; shows pretty clearly that there is no &#8216;there&#8217; there. To the extent that there is a gap between future projected income and cost it is small, distant, based on pessimistic assumptions, and totally fixable even if we waited years to take the first step. You can show this on paper or in pixels and I have spent much of the last six years doing that here and there and mostly without numeric push-back, the counter-arguments tending to be thematic and not number based at all.</p>
<p>So why do they push this? Well simple, the Right cannot afford to have a Social Security system that is perceived to be working going forward. They can survive people liking Social Security as is, after all they can spin that as people just enjoying a Free Lunch via that ol&#8217; Backwards Transfer pushed by the nice folk at AEI, that just helps their overall &#8216;mushy headed liberal&#8217; narrative, a modern day Grasshopper and the Ant. What kills them is to find out that the Grasshopper actually has an actuarial sound insurance policy in his back pocket, and one guaranteed by the Federal government, such a realization might lead the rest of the ants to doubt the &#8216;Big Government is not the Solution, Big Government is the Problem&#8217; message being spread by the Ant Queen and her Drones.</p>
<p>In 1993 the anti-Social Security narrative revolved around Trust Fund Depletion, which was a real event which would have real consequences, if not as significant as people would have them (see &#8216;Rosser&#8217;s Equation&#8217; at a Google near you), but by the late 90&#8217;s Trust Fund Depletion had been pushed so far out in time even as the cost to address it steadily dropped that there grew the need for a new crisis narrative. And so &#8216;Phony IOU&#8217; was born. But otherwise nothing much had changed, the definition of &#8216;crisis&#8217; was malleable but the solution was always the same: we needed to Destroy Social Security in Order to Save It.</p>
<p>Typically people on the Left tend to assign three motives for the desire of the Right to &#8216;reform&#8217; Social Security. One is to get their hands on the assets in the Trust Funds. This is a total category mistake, those assets though real as real are not tappable in the way this narrative would require. A second is to get their hands on surpluses going forwards. Well this is the same mistake with a slightly different twist, cash surpluses which were as real as real could be in 1999 are existentially different today. And a third motive advanced was the fees that would be generated on private accounts. Well I don&#8217;t think this pencils out as well as people would think at least for the accounts of people in the lower 50% of income, if it were a pure scheme for extracting account fees they wouldn&#8217;t be pushing for universality, but instead for opt-out for higher-income workers.</p>
<p>Nope in my opinion the fundamental motive for opposing Social Security is not driven by greed as such but instead an ideology that depends crucially on the perception that Big Government is always and everywhere a failure, and that the bigger the counter-example the higher the risk to that overall paradigm. If Social Security was just headed for the cliff, its enemies would just stand back and watch it go, arguably this is where they were at in 1993. It is only when they see the coach driver beginning to get the team under control and steer it away from the cliff that they have to jump in and try to spook the horses again.</p>
<p>Which is why people asking why the actions of Social Security opponents don&#8217;t seem to be particularly helpful in guiding the stage coach away from the cliff are asking the wrong question, looked at in that way their actions don&#8217;t make sense at all. On the other hand if you flip it around a lot of things become clear, there being more than one definition of &#8216;fixing&#8217;.</p>

<p>Dean asks: <br />
<blockquote>1) How much higher are real wages projected to be in 2040 than today? In other words, how much richer do we expect the average worker to be 30 years from now?</p>
<p>2) How did the 2010 Trustees Report change the projections for 2040 wages compared with the 2009 report?</p>
<p>3) If we solve the projected shortfall in Social Security entirely by raising the payroll tax, what percent of the gain in real wages over the next 30 years would have to go to pay the tax?</p>
<p>4) What percent of real wage gains over the last 30 years was absorbed by the increase in Social Security payroll taxes?</p>
<p>5) What percent of the projected long-term budget shortfall is due to the inefficiencies of the US health care system?</p>
<p>6) How much wealth should we expect near retirees to have to support themselves in retirement?</p>
<p>7) What percent of older workers have jobs in which they can reasonably be expected to work at into their late 60s?</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>House Minority Leader John Boehner said in a statement marking the 75th anniversary that while the law has served the needs of millions of Americans seniors, the Social Security and Medicare Trustees have &#8220;repeatedly warned Congress and the American people that reforms are necessary or future benefits will be threatened.&#8221;<br />He added that Republicans are &#8220;committed to protecting Social Security and preserving this invaluable program for current and future generations of retirees.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Time to take a little closer looks at this framing in light of the numbers. Boehner here is defining &#8216;crisis&#8217; explicitly in terms of &#8220;threatened&#8221; &#8220;future benefits&#8221; and then commits his party to &#8220;protecting&#8221; and &#8220;preserving&#8221; Social Security. But how does his party propose to do this? Well by cutting benefits, either through an increase in retirement age or via a switch to some form of price indexing. Kind of like saving your foot by cutting off your leg.</p>
<p>We know what the Trustees say: 100% of scheduled benefits payable through 2037 and 78% after that declining to 75% at the end of the projection period. Meaning that any proposal based on a crisis defined by &#8220;threatened future benefits&#8221; that produces a worse result in 2037 and after is some mixture of ineffectiveness and bait and switch, particularly if if also cuts benefits BEFORE 2037, from the perspective of the future retiree no matter what the age that proposal represents a dead loss. For workers the simplest benchmark is &#8216;22%&#8217;, any &#8216;fix&#8217; in excess of that is just theft from workers serving to advance some other purpose. Those purposes might be worthwhile on their own, but it is up to proponents to make the case to a democratic majority why the tradeoff is actually either in the interest of the nation and/or the vast majority of that nation that participates in Social Security.</p>
<p>Opponents of Social Security have tried to get around this difficulty, (and the even bigger one represented by what I call &#8216;Rosser&#8217;s Equation&#8217;, that 22% &#8216;cut&#8217; is from a much larger baseline number than today) by using language that leads younger workers to believe that &#8216;benefits cut from a 160% baseline&#8217; somehow translates to &#8216;no check for me&#8217;. It doesn&#8217;t. As long as FICA continues to be collected and is not permanently diverted to PRAs or something else, benefits will be paid at some level. It is up to reformers who are currently defining &#8216;crisis&#8217; in terms of &#8216;benefit cuts&#8217; to put up or shut up. Can they produce a better result for the democratic majority? If not why should we listen? And make them bring numbers and not slogans.
