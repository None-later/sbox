                                <p>This post is by Coberly, and was written for inclusion in the upcoming <a href="http://www.facingup.org/">Facing Up</a> blog carnival on Social Security.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>The idea that Something Needs To Be Done About Social Security is rooted in three fundamental misunderstandings.  A misunderstanding about the very nature of Social Security, a misunderstanding about what the Trust Fund is, and a misunderstanding about the numbers:  how big they are and what they mean.</p>
<p>It’s as if your doctor, your boss, and your financial planner all came into your office and announced they had good news and they had bad news.  Your doctor says he is going to extend your life expectancy by six years.  Your boss says he is going to give you a 300 dollar per week raise. </p>
<p>“So what’s the bad news?”  </p>
<p>Your financial planner tells you that you are going to have to save an extra 20 dollars a week in order to pay for that extra six years in retirement.<br />Of course this is not usually the way the news is presented.  Instead a nice man in a suit tells you he is a “non partisan expert” and “SOCIAL SECURITY IS GOING BROKE! FLAT BUST! IT’S GOING TO BE A CRUSHING BURDEN ON YOUR CHILDREN!”</p>
<p>The source of this misunderstanding is that most people don’t read, can’t read, or deliberately misread the Social Security Trustees Report.   [The 2007 Annual Report of the Trustees of the Federal Old Age and Survivors Insurance and Federal Disability Insurance Trust Funds.  A web copy can be found <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR07/trTOC.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>Here are the facts: The Social Security Trustees report a projected deficit in Social Security finances of 4.7 Trillion Dollars over the next seventy five years [Trustees Report, page 2].  A good place to begin understanding what this means is to make a rough calculation of approximately what it might mean to you:  There are about 200 million taxpayers in America, so 4.7 Trillion divided by 200 million is 23,500 dollars per taxpayer, divided by 75 years is 313 dollars per taxpayer per year, or about six dollars a week.</p>
<p>This is just back of the envelope, but it should give you a sense of the scale of the problem:  not very big.  The Trustees do the hard arithmetic, using &#8220;present value” and all the right details about timing and interest rates, and&#8230;  tell you what the answer is: An immediate increase in the combined payroll tax of 1.95% would close the deficit [Trustees Report, p 3]. But that&#8217;s combined. What you would see is about 1% for you and 1% for your boss.  Average pay is about 37,000 dollars per year, or about 700 dollars per week.  1% of 700 dollars is 7 dollars per week.</p>
<p>However, the Trustees know we can&#8217;t start paying for the projected deficit right away because, well, because it hasn&#8217;t happened yet.  And paying more now would just increase the amount of the national debt&#8230;  those “worthless iou&#8217;s” in the Trust Fund are debt, after all.  So they dolefully point out [p 16 of the report] that if we wait until the money actually comes due, in about 2040, it would require an increase in the combined payroll tax of about 4% &#8230;  or 2% (about 14 dollars a week) for you, and 2% for your boss.  They don&#8217;t point out, but you can find it  if you are a careful reader, that by 2040, assuming, as they do [p 87], an increase in real income of 1.1% per year over that time, the average real wage will have increased by 300 dollars a week (to about 1000 dollars per week, or 50,000 per year)&#8230;.and of course the tax on the larger income will be bigger&#8230; about 20 dollars per week. So there&#8217;s your crisis:  30 years from now a 20 dollar per week increase in the tax on an income that is 300 dollars per week larger.</p>
<p>And that money, those extra 20 dollars per week, is not thrown into a government black hole:  You get it back, with enough effective interest to cover inflation (and more, depending on the rise in real wages) when you need it most.  The reason for the raise in the tax is that you are going to be living longer, spending a larger percent of your life retired, so you will need to save a larger percent of your income.  But that &#8220;larger&#8221; is 2%, not 50%, not 100%, not “the value of all the property in America” as Peter Peterson likes to say.</p>
<p>Another way to look at this:  The Trustees say that by 2041 under current tax rates they will only be able to meet 75% of promised benefits [p16].  This means taxes would have to be raised 33% to meet all promised benefits.  But that is 33% of a 6.2% tax. or about 2.1% of payroll.  2% of 700 dollars is 14 dollars per week.  But by then you will be making 1000 dollars/week.  2% of 1000 dollars is 20 dollars.</p>
<p>I am repeating this because I want to be sure you get it.  We are talking about a twenty dollar per week tax increase&#8230; on an income that is 300 dollars more per week than you have today&#8230; in order to pay for your own longer retirement. This is not a crisis.  It is not even a problem.</p>
<p>The Trustees suggest that instead of paying the 2% tax increase, we could cut benefits by 25% [p 16].  But benefits are about 1000 dollars per month.  Cutting them by 25% would leave you trying to get by on 750 dollars per month. No fun. <br />Ask your financial planner what makes more sense&#8230;  raising your tax by 60 dollars per month (using today’s values) out of an income of 3000 dollars per month, or cutting your benefits 250 dollars per month out of a pension of 1000 dollars per month?</p>
<p>Some say we should raise the retirement age.  That&#8217;s easy to say when you are young, or have a really good job.  But the fact is that most people, when they have a choice, choose to retire early rather than late, even if it means getting less money.  And it  conveniently ignores the fact that these old people WILL HAVE PAID FOR THEIR OWN RETIREMENT.</p>
<p>These are the choices, but the fast talking man in the suit isn&#8217;t going to give you a chance to think about them. Once you have got the SIZE of the problem fixed in your mind, you are ready to think about the other two fundamental misunderstandings.</p>
<p>The first of these is the Trust Fund.  The Trust Fund is NOT Social Security.  When Bush tells you that Social Security will be “broke, flat bust,” he is lying.   The current Trust Fund was created so the Baby Boomers could pay in advance for their own retirement.  The Trust Fund was always intended to run out of money&#8230; go &#8220;broke&#8221;&#8230;at about the time the last of the Boomers were dying off. It looks like it will have done its job by about 2040. When the Trust Fund is fully paid out, Social Security returns to pay as you go. It can never run out of money&#8230;as long as America stands, as long as the workers want a safe way to save for their own retirement.</p>
<p>In fact, the Trust Fund doesn&#8217;t matter very much.  The cost of paying it off will amount to a tax raise of ONE DOLLAR PER WEEK each year from 2016 to about 2036 [p 44 TableIV.B1.],  during a time when the average wage is increasing TEN dollars per week each year.</p>
<p>The last fundamental misunderstanding is the nature of Social Security itself.  Social Security is not welfare.  The rich do not pay for the poor.  The young do not pay for the old.  It is not “government money.”</p>
<p>There is a certain magic to pay as you go with wage indexing that only the Federal government can accomplish.  The government can guarantee you get your money back safe from inflation, safe from market gyrations, safe from illness or theft.  It can even insure you against failing to make enough money over a lifetime to have saved enough for basic needs in retirement. But no one pays any more into Social Security than they expect to get back.</p>
<p>Pay as you go is fundamentally no different from  putting your money into the bank or buying a stock.  The day you put your money in, it goes right out the back door to pay for someone else&#8217;s expenses.  And when you are ready to take your money out&#8230;  it has to come in the front door from someone else who is buying your stock, or buying your company&#8217;s products so the company can pay you dividends. </p>
<p>Under ANY retirement plan it is always “the young” that pay for “the old.”  The young do it because they know that it is a good deal for them:  one day they will be &#8220;the old.&#8221;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cbo.gov/publications/collections/health.cfm">CBO reports clearly</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Rising health care costs and their consequences for federal health insurance programs constitute the nation&#8217;s central fiscal challenge.<br />Sources of Growth in Projected Federal Spendingon Medicare and Medicaid (Percentage of GDP)</p>
<p>Health is a growing area of analysis for CBO, with work done across the agency. CBO&#8217;s health work is divided into two categories: (1) estimating the budgetary impact of federal health programs and (2) preparing studies on health policy issues. The Health unit in the <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/aboutcbo/organization/bad.htm">Budget Analysis Division</a> estimates budgetary impacts; it estimates the cost of proposed health legislation and prepares spending projections for federal health programs. The <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/aboutcbo/organization/hhrd.htm">Health and Human Resources Division</a> conducts studies of health issues, including Medicare, Medicaid, pharmaceuticals, public health, and private health markets; it also develops models that underlie cost estimates. The <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/aboutcbo/organization/nsd.htm">National Security Division</a> conducts studies of the health care provided by the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs. The <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/aboutcbo/organization/msd.htm">Microeconomic Studies Division</a> also analyzes health issues, especially those related to competition or market structure, including most recently prescription drug pricing and research and development in the pharmaceutical industry.<br />&#8230;<br />Although the aging of the population is frequently cited as the major factor contributing to the large projected increase in federal spending on Medicare and Medicaid, <strong>it accounts for only a modest fraction of the growth that CBO projects.</strong> The main factor is excess cost growth-or the extent to which the increase in health care spending exceeds the growth of the economy. The gains from higher spending are not clear, however.(bolding mine)</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.ombwatch.org/article/articleview/4091/1/515">OMBWatch</a> also has other wide ranging sources of data and opinion, including the President&#8217;s numbers.</p>
<p>The third rail of politics will continue to be so if this nonsense being sold as crisis of Social Security continues. It is a tired meme, but I am sure will rise again. Let us look elsewhere, such as the President&#8217;s drug program, artificially high costs generated from various cost centers, and such things as costs not equating to value <strong>within the continental US</strong>, much less internationally with outliar concerns.  </p>
<p>The debt will be paid, so let us get creative with other issues that need addressing far more than this strawman.</p>

For those that think Social Security is wrong, so be it, but it is there and is promised.</p>
<p>
<blockquote>Texans were already lining up to get help at the Social Security office in Pasadena, a suburb of Houston, at 8 a.m., an hour before the office opens. The glass-and-concrete building, which sits in a no-frills strip mall, is &#8220;known for its long waits,&#8221; says Angelica Obregón, who was leaning against her walker on this muggy September morning, eyeing a gray sky that threatened rain.<br />&#8220;People bring chairs, people bring umbrellas, people bring their breakfasts&#8230;because they have a long wait—a long wait,&#8221; says Obregón, 49, who has visited the office repeatedly about her Social Security disability case.<br />The Social Security Administration (SSA)—which touches the lives of virtually every American—was once touted as the preeminent can-do agency. But budget cuts, staff reductions and a growing list of new duties involving everything from Medicare to homeland security processing are taking a toll on the system that administers the nation&#8217;s retirement program, its 1,500 offices in neighborhoods across the country—and the people who rely on them.<br />&#8220;This is a train wreck unfolding right in front of us,&#8221; says Sylvester Schieber, chairman of the Social Security Advisory Board, an independent, bipartisan body whose members are appointed by the president and Congress to report on the agency.<br />&#8220;People will be alarmed,&#8221; Schieber says, &#8220;to learn this agency they think they&#8217;re going to depend on … doesn&#8217;t have the resources to deal with the cases coming its way.&#8221;<br />In small towns and big cities, delays and backlogs at the Social Security office can sometimes be the rule—whether it&#8217;s an hour wait to see a representative in Pasadena, Texas, or a 1,020-day wait for a judge to hear a Social Security disability insurance claim in Atlanta.<br />Calling a Social Security office can be as frustrating as lining up there. Today, an average of 51 percent of all calls to local offices get a busy signal, according to the SSA&#8217;s own study.<br />The Bloomington, Ind., office, for example, serves five counties and has one person answering the phones, says Vicki Ketchum, who was interviewed before she retired as the district manager last month. &#8220;People have told me they&#8217;ve called the office for two weeks and couldn&#8217;t get through,&#8221; she says, &#8220;so they packed up the car and drove up to two hours to get here. That&#8217;s not right.&#8221;<br />Most disturbing may be the backlog in claims for disability insurance. Largely driven by boomers in their 50s—the years when working men and women are most prone to develop illnesses and disabilities, according to the SSA—the number of workers who say they are too sick or disabled to continue to work has grown by a staggering 60 percent in the past few years. Today 750,000 of these vulnerable Americans are waiting an average of 520 days—and in some areas close to three years—for a hearing on their claims.<br />&#8220;The agency is struggling to balance its new responsibilities and its traditional work,&#8221; without added resources, Social Security Commissioner Michael Astrue told a congressional hearing in May.<br />In a more recent interview with the AARP Bulletin, Astrue said that he is &#8220;trying to be optimistic. We&#8217;re doing our best to stay as far ahead of the curve for as long as we can.&#8221;<br />&#8220;Right now,&#8221; he says, &#8220;in most parts of the country the level of service is quite high. But waiting times in some offices are more than what I or anyone else would like to see. And the disability backlog is simply unacceptable.&#8221;<br />Among the agency&#8217;s new responsibilities is determining the eligibility of applicants for Extra Help under Medicare Part D, the prescription drug benefit. Since SSA started taking applications in July 2005, 6.7 million people have applied. In the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, Congress assigned the SSA a whole raft of new homeland security regulations to enforce after 9/11, tightening or changing the rules for issuing or replacing Social Security cards.<br />In 2005, for example, offices were told women could not change their name on Social Security cards to a married name if they had only a foreign marriage certificate as proof, says Paul McGinley, a former operations supervisor in Knoxville, Tenn., who retired this year. &#8220;Fathers who had paid for big destination weddings for their daughters in Jamaica and places like that came down and gave us an earful. We fought that one almost every day for a year and a half until it was changed.&#8221;<br />Immigration-related legislation that Congress is considering would require employers to verify the employment eligibility of all new hires. That could significantly increase workloads at SSA, which already verifies huge numbers of Social Security numbers for employers—84 million in 2006.<br />As the workload has been increasing, the number of SSA employees has been shrinking. The agency has lost 4,000 workers in the last two years alone, and staffing is at its lowest level in 33 years.<br />&#8220;We&#8217;re not just treading water now, we&#8217;re sinking,&#8221; says Rick Warsinskey, who represents the agency&#8217;s managers and supervisors as president of the National Council of Social Security Management Associations.<br />SSA officials say the agency doesn&#8217;t have the funds to add to its staff, or even to replace all the employees who leave. In the last 10 years, the agency&#8217;s budget requests have been reduced first by the administration, which cut them to maintenance level, then by Congress, which cut them even further, &#8220;to the tune of $1 billion,&#8221; Astrue says. The agency&#8217;s periodic reevaluations of people receiving disability payments—to ensure continued eligibility—return $10 in savings for every $1 spent, but even they have been drastically cut back.<br />The chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., says his staff &#8220;hears the phrases &#8216;completely outrageous&#8217; and &#8216;entirely unacceptable&#8217; repeatedly from North Dakotans frustrated by their experiences with local Social Security offices.&#8221; His committee recommended a Social Security appropriation of $430 million more than the president&#8217;s budget request for the agency for 2008.<br />The final bill is expected to allocate only $100 million to $125 million more. That might allow the agency to maintain current staffing levels, but not increase them.<br />And yet this month the first of 78 million boomers, three months shy of turning 62, can begin applying for early retirement benefits they are eligible to receive next year. Astrue says that he&#8217;s banking heavily on more boomers using the agency&#8217;s website for a wide range of services. But even if they do, experts say, SSA staffers must review and process the applications—using an antiquated computer system.</p></blockquote>
<p>We seem to be seeing a pattern among agency service delivery systems. Is this part of infrastructure of services and systems for the commons, a broken promise, or lousy administration. </p>
<p>It does appear to be bi-partisan as the fear of being blamed for failure for Iraq is laid on the American people and immobilizes looking at other priorities and other services.</p>

You see – I took President Reagan at his word back in 1983 when he said that higher payroll tax that I’ve paid for almost a quarter of a century was designed to insure I would get my promised Social Security benefit, which is why I continue to separately report the Trust Fund surpluses and the General Fund deficits.  Just like there are Global Warming Deniers, there are Trust Fund Deniers.</p>
<p>So when anyone tout the alleged deficit progress by citing the unified deficit, it is time to chalk them up as a Trust Fund Denier.  A prime example is <a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2007/10/update-on-federal-budget.html">Greg Mankiw</a> who declares the current unified deficit to be not so bad with the real problems is that folks like me will soon be expecting Social Security retirement benefits to actually be paid.</p>

<blockquote><p>This is largely Dean Baker’s beat, but I’ve also been noticing what he’s noticing: sloppy doomsaying on Social Security seems to be making a comeback. During the great 2005 debate over privatization, I thought people like Dean and myself had managed to get across the points that there is no such program as Socialsecuritymedicareandmedicaid; that Social Security is in pretty good shape, so that projections of huge future spending on Socialsecuritymedicareandmedicaid are mainly about the Medicareandmedicaid part of it; and that in general, what we have is a health care crisis, with the costs of an aging population much smaller and more manageable. But now casual talk about the need to “fix” Social Security is creeping back into the discourse. Folks, Social Security is in pretty good shape; it’s not clear that there even is a long-run shortfall, and if there is it’s a much less pressing problem than many others. The only reason we hear so much about Social Security is that there are powerful political forces that want to kill it, for ideological reasons.</p></blockquote>
<p>Years ago when Lawrence Lindsey was spinning this issue, Paul had a thought that would make the General Fund not look so bad – have the payroll tax pay for Social Security benefits and the Defense Department too.  Paul was mocking Dr. Lindsey’s spinning of course, but is the current accounting gimmicks any worse?</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Over at <a href="http://econospeak.blogspot.com/2007/10/president-clintons-social-security.html">EconoSpeak</a>, I criticized the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/30/AR2007093001209.html">WaPo</a> coverage of something Hillary Clinton said about Social Security:</p>
<blockquote><p>she noted, the insolvency date has moved from 2055 to 2041.</p></blockquote>
<p>I do not trust anything the Washington Post says either about Social Security or about what the Senator has to try.  I do trust <a href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/beat_the_press_archive?month=10&#038;year=2007&#038;base_name=the_clintons_and_social_securi">Dean Baker</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>During the last debate for the Democratic presidential candidates Senator Clinton was asked about Social Security. In her response she made the obviously true statement that the key to dealing with the problem is to maintain a strong economy. (The issue is supporting retirees, if we have a strong economy we can do this, if the economy is in bad shape, then this is a problem regardless of what we do with Social Security).   She also made the somewhat confused assertion that the projected date for the SS Trust Fund&#8217;s depletion had been pushed back to 2055 under the Clinton I administration. (I think that she may have been referring to the first set of projections for SS put out by CBO, which put the date of depletion at 2052.) While the economy did experience healthy growth in the last four years of the Clinton administration, and the projected date of trust fund depletion actually was pushed back several years by the SS trustees, this was actually due to a cut in benefits, not more rapid economic growth.</p></blockquote>
<p>So where did the Washington Post get the 2041?  <a href="http://www.cbpp.org/4-24-07socsec.pdf">Robert Greenstein</a> has an explanation. As I wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>The year when the Trust Fund is expected to be exhausted is indeed 2041 but that compares to a prediction from the 1997 report that the predicted year of exhaustion was 2029. Also notice that the “year costs exceed tax revenue and interest” is predicted to be 2027 – well after the next President Clinton leaves office.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>Get this. The problem is that globalization is being threatened, all that good could be lost. The solution; Social Security.</p>
<p>In the July/August issue of Foreign Affairs (published by the Council of Foreign Relations) is an article: <a href="http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20070701faessay86403-p50/kenneth-f-scheve-matthew-j-slaughter/a-new-deal-for-globalization.html">A New Deal for Globalization </a>by Kenneth F. Scheve is Professor of Political Science at Yale University. Matthew J. Slaughter is Professor of Economics at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth.<br />Seems some people somewhere are getting concerned that their pet project might be getting derailed.<br />
<blockquote>“<strong>Advocates of engagement with the world economy are now warning of a protectionist drift in public policy.</strong> This drift is commonly blamed on narrow industry concerns or a failure to explain globalization&#8217;s benefits or the war on terrorism. These explanations miss a more basic point: U.S. policy is becoming more protectionist because the American public is becoming more protectionist, and this shift in attitudes is a result of stagnant or falling incomes.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The authors say they don&#8217;t know why the incomes are falling, that there are no clear answers:<br />
<blockquote>“Over the last several years, a striking new feature of the U.S. economy has emerged: real income growth has been extremely skewed, with relatively few high earners doing well while incomes for most workers have stagnated or, in many cases, fallen. Just what mix of forces is behind this trend is not yet clear, but regardless, the numbers are stark.”</p></blockquote>
<p>First &#8212; “new feature”? Did they not read about the early years of the rise of the industrialists and the division in income way back when? Or is it that they as others took for granted that those making the money via globalizing their operations were going to be nice to those who worked for them at home and share the spoils via wages. Now that would have been a “new feature”. Being nice that is. I know, maybe they just thought everyone could and would outsource their own labor.</p>
<p>Actually, they do know about the old days:</p>
<blockquote><p>“By some measures, inequality in the United States is greater today than at any time since the 1920s.”</p></blockquote>
<p>What&#8217;s the solution to rising protectionism talk? Well, first what is not going to work (read carefully all you who think it&#8217;s just a matter of the populace getting off their intellectually lazy butts):</p>
<blockquote><p>“They must also recognize that the two most commonly proposed responses &#8212; more investment in education and more trade adjustment assistance for dislocated workers &#8212; are nowhere near adequate. Significant payoffs from educational investment will take decades to be realized, and trade adjustment assistance is too small and too narrowly targeted on specific industries to have much effect.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, go to school, get a job is not it. Darn! The solution envelop please, (I&#8217;m so nervous):</p>
<blockquote><p>“The best way to avert the rise in protectionism is by instituting a New Deal for globalization &#8212; one that links engagement with the world economy to a substantial redistribution of income. In the United States, that would mean adopting a fundamentally more progressive federal tax system.”</p></blockquote>
<p>WHAT!!!!!!!!!!!! REDISTRIBUTION?</p>
<blockquote><p>“The notion of more aggressively redistributing income may sound radical, but ensuring that most American workers are benefiting is the best way of saving globalization from a protectionist backlash.”</p></blockquote>
<p>And they said they didn&#8217;t know why “income growth had been extremely skewed.” Well, if they didn&#8217;t know, then how is it they are channeling what was proposed before? They are even referring to it in it&#8217;s historically correct name: New Deal.</p>
<p>The article is very basic thinking and made me wonder why does it take 2 professors writing for 6 pages to state what I was taught under the lesson of morals: that is to share and share alike,<br />And then under the lesson of civics: that is social commons,<br />Then what I learned in history: Ford paying the help and Roosevelt&#8217;s New Deal. Why?</p>
<p>I think the answer is because then they could not write as if skewed income distribution is &#8220;a striking new feature&#8221; and thus suggest as an example of effecting redistribution by targeting the last remaining New Deal concept expressed in the program commonly called Social Security. They specifically rule out that other monster of a New Deal brain storm:</p>
<blockquote><p>“<strong>This does not, however, mean making the personal income tax more progressive, as is often suggested. U.S. taxation of personal income is already quite progressive.</strong> Instead, policymakers should remember that workers do not pay only income taxes; they also pay the FICA (Federal Insurance Contributions Act) payroll tax for social insurance. This tax offers the best way to redistribute income.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Well if that is not the ultimate bastardization of the purpose of Social Security. It&#8217;s now proposed to use it as an income redistribution machine.</p>
<p>Think I&#8217;m being to distrusting?</p>
<blockquote><p>“In many ways, today&#8217;s protectionist drift is similar to the challenges faced by the architect of the original New Deal. In August 1934, President Franklin Roosevelt declared:<br />&#8220;Those who would measure confidence in this country in the future must look first to the average citizen. . . .”</p></blockquote>
<p>See, they know the answer.  They know exactly what they are doing here. By the way esteemed professors, stupid is not written on our foreheads.</p>

                                <p>It is my pleasure to respond to the many interesting responses I have received to my posting on Angry Bear. I&#8217;m starting with responses to the 18 comments on the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/05/bob-hormats-here-tuesday-morning.html">initial announcement</a> of my visit. Tomorrow I will respond to the dozens of comments on my first post. Thanks for your patience &#8212; you are an active group and I&#8217;m trying to keep up.</p>
<p>Coberly is correct.  We should not cut Social Security to pay for a war.  My concern about the growing outlays from Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid is that if they continue on their current trajectories they will swamp all other programs in the budget — and lead to higher interest rates and higher taxes, and since the tax that pays for Social Security is the Payroll tax — which is very regressive –- it will hurt low and middle income wage earners. I favor cutting a lot of non-essential domestic programs before cutting Social Security and Medicare benefits, but I am afraid that at some point we will need to find a way of increasing inflows into such programs — preferably from high income earners, and curbing the growth benefits to upper income people to make these programs sustainable for those who really need them.</p>
<p>This would have to be done even if the Defense Budget were zero. But because it is not zero, and we still will have international and Homeland Security expenses well after the Iraq War, this is yet another reason to put these programs on a more sustainable basis. And I also agree with Coberly that Social Security is less than 5% percent of GDP now; in fact it has a surplus now. The issue comes toward the end of the next decade; my book <i>The Price of Liberty</i> describes this concern in its last chapter. I want to be sure there is money for our elderly and medically needy; that is essential. But I also think we need to make sure there is also money for our national security. That will require some better long-term planning than we are seeing today.</p>
<p>To Dale: Thanks for making the point about waste in military spending. This needs to be corrected, as does the earmarking of defense and homeland security projects. Correcting these things are both good economics and good for national security in that it will strengthen the credibility of the funds that the Defense Department and the Homeland Security Department do ask for. And as for an attack on entitlements, as I mentioned to Coberly, I do not attack entitlements.  I want to put them on a sustainable basis for those who need them. And to do so we need to look ahead. I am sorry I was not clearer on this. It should not be a zero sum game. All programs, military spending and entitlements need to be looked at to be sure that the funds are well spent; entitlements need to go to those who need them. And those who do not should do with a little less.</p>
<p>To Sammy: Good point.  I think that asking Americans to make sacrifices for any war does two things; one, it gives citizens a vested interest in the war, as was the case in World War II and it avoids hiding of the war, as was the case in Iraq and Vietnam. All I am asking for is an honest dialogue with the American people on what a war costs — so they understand that it cannot be financed by sleight of hand. That would enable Americans to make an informed decision as to whether they want to make sacrifices to support their troops — which most Americans will — and our leaders to have a more direct dialogue with Americans. Skirting the budget issue neither promotes an open dialogue nor enables Americans to determine what the war will actually cost them. Since no war is free, understanding the cost at the outset is good politics and good for a democracy.</p>
<p>To Patrick R. Sullivan: We do have bonds today, since much of this war is paid for by borrowing, but we do not have a candid presentation about how much of our current borrowing is war related, tax cut related, or for other things. In fact, it is for all of them. But because borrowing can be done relatively easily at relatively low rates it looks easier than borrowing for past wars.</p>
<p>To PGL: Very well put.  Better than I could have done myself. If we do not pay for our war, the cost is passed to the next generation.  And you are also right on Social Security; the Social Security Surplus is disguising the actual size of the deficit and making the war easier to finance because it disguises its cost and indeed the cost of running the entire government.  I describe this in greater detail in the last chapter of my book; the Concorde Coalition also highlights it.  I am concerned about deficit financing not only for financial reasons — although that will be a huge problem in the next decade when the costs of entitlement and discretionary spending and interest payments are added up and compared against the inflow of revenues — but because it is a horrible legacy for coming generations. In my book, I cite a wonderful quote from George Washington’s farewell address in which he warned against “ungenerously throwing upon future generations the debts we ourselves ought to bear.”  That goes for us too. </p>
<p>To Ken Melvin: I am not sure whether we are spending too much for these programs or not, but we should certainly take a hard look at them through the use of Congressional oversight — as in the case of the Truman Commission during World War II. My concern is that we are not spending some of the money smartly. And a lot of stuff is added by Congress for local constituency benefits which is not needed — or put into Homeland Security not on the basis if risk but for more political reasons.</p>
<p>To Sammy: I do care that some Social Security and other benefits go to people who don’t need them. Correcting that should be one part of the reform process.<br />Coberly asks some additional questions about the cost of future entitlement programs. All these are valid. The best way to get the answers is from the reports of the Trustees of Social Security and Medicare and from groups such as the Concord Coalition. These numbers are very similar — and these are the figures I cite in my book. One key point is that borrowing from the Social Security Trust Fund now finances a substantial portion of our budget deficit. This misleads Americans into thinking that the deficit is lower than it really is. But when the surplus turns to a deficit in the next decade that will change.</p>
<p>To Josh G.: I am not arguing to slash social programs to pay for the military. They should be put on a more sustainable basis for their own internal reasons of keeping faith with the people who will need them in coming decades. These numbers didn’t come from me; I got them from the people who run these programs. And, on another point, I think that terrorists do represent a threat — not only the ones in caves but the ones who are planning attacks here and on our allies.</p>
<p>To Lysistrada: I am not suggesting using the payroll tax to finance the military budget. Soon it will not even cover the costs of the Social Security System. Also, I do not believe and did not believe at the time that we needed a tax cut for people in the upper income bracket — and if one were to be passed I did not think it should last for ten years. And I have been all in favor of raising the minimum wage. But regarding FDR, he did cut programs for a lot of middle income people; many New Deal programs were cut during World War II. But I am not suggesting that now. I am not suggesting that any programs for low or middle income people should be cut; my discussion of Social Security and other reforms goes to the point of ensuring that they are around for coming generations for those who need them. And there are risks if they are not reformed; even with a zero defense budget that would be needed. Please read the reports of the people who run these programs and look at the numbers and look at the reports of the bipartisan Concord Coalition. And then let&#8217;s discuss this further.</p>
<p>Thank you all very much for your contributions.  More responses will be posted tomorrow.</p>
