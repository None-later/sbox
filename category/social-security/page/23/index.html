Low Cost until 2007 meant fully funded but not overfunded Social Security through the 75 year actuarial window. No matter what had happened in the year before, or even the several years before, the output never varies. In shape anyway, a close look shows that the ultimate Trust Fund Ratios differ, but for operational purposes we get the same result: Baby Bear and porridge just right.</p>

                                <p>by Bruce Webb (first three sentences edited since original post a few minutes ago)<br />The 2005 Report was a mild disappointment. The 2006 Report somewhat worse.  2007 showed some mild improvement but didn&#8217;t even get us back to 2005 numbers. Now the 2008 on the surface looked a lot brighter but most of that turned out to be the result of a one time change in assumptions about the relations between immigrant earnings and actual payouts (contrary to myth immigrants get a crappy deal from SS). And now the preliminary numbers for 2008 that will go into the 2009 Report are pretty sad and you have to be really, really on the Pollyanna side of life to believe that 2009 employment and wage numbers are going to be so robust as to make up all the difference by the 2010 Report. Really we don&#8217;t seem to have made much progress since the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR05/II_conclu.html#wp86802">2005 Report&#8217;s Conclusion</a> which projected Trust Fund depletion in 2041, a payout of 76% after that, and an actuarial deficit of 1.92%. </p>
<p>All of which might induce some to think that we need to rethink &#8216;Nothing&#8217; as a plan for Social Security. Well not so fast, instead we need to first need replicate the calculation I first suggested back in 2006 in my post <a target="_blank" href="http://bruceweb.blogspot.com/2006/05/cost-of-inactivity-nothing-as-plan-for.html">The Cost of Inactivity: &#8216;Nothing&#8217; as a Plan for Social Security</a>.</p>
<p>Plenty of numbers below the fold. Be sure to bring a calculator</p>
<p>I am not here to make the case against PRAs because really I don&#8217;t need to. There is a case to be made that if you had to transition to a system of Private Accounts the time to do it is when the markets are at a low. The problem is convincing anyone that we in fact are at a low or that the markets will ever recover in a way that offsets losses to date in any reasonable time frame. So I&#8217;ll leave that one for Andrew Biggs.</p>
<p>In 2005 we were 36 years from Trust Fund Depletion then set for 2041. Today we are 32 years from TF Depletion still set for 2041. If we don&#8217;t see progress then at some point we will need to make some decision. On the other hand we don&#8217;t need to rashly throw today&#8217;s dollars at a problem that may not happen at all, or happen in a smaller than currently projected form. On what should we base this decision? Well on something I like to call &#8216;arithmetic&#8217;.</p>
<p>The discussion starts with some simplifying assumptions. One is that we can act based only on our knowledge of the past year and our prediction for the next one or two years.( Which is fair enough, anyone who can predict with precision what numbers will look like in 2011 is practicing witchcraft). Two that we are going to treat wages in constant dollar terms and moreover three, assume flat real wages for our four test cases. And four that increases in payroll tax ultimately bear on wages even though in cash flow terms half comes from the employer.  Anyone who wants to present some more sophisticated calcs can do so in comments.</p>
<p>Okay take four individuals aged 25, 35, 45, and 55. The latter will reach full retirement age at 66, the others at 67, meaning that remaining work life is 42, 32, 22, and 11 years respectively. We will assume that each makes $50,000 a year and in constant dollar terms will continue at that wage rate. The payroll gap, meaning the amount FICA would have had to be increased immediately to restore 75 year actuarial balance, in the 2008 Report was 1.7%. That is other things being equal an increase in that amount starting a year ago would have &#8216;fixed&#8217; Social Security. Instead we did &#8216;Nothing&#8217;. Now avoiding a tax increase should have about the same effect as having an equivalent tax cut. So doing nothing left $850 dollars in all four pockets. Under our four assumptions how much would the payroll gap have to increase by the next Report to make  &#8216;Nothing&#8217; a bad bet? Well it varies by age of the subject.</p>
<p>Our 55 year old has 11 years until retirement. As long as the increased annual tax of a higher payroll gap is less than 850/11 he is better off with &#8216;Nothing&#8217; for 2008. Or $77. Which translates to .15% of payroll. So if the new number comes in anywhere higher than 1.85% he is on paper a loser. Can the number move .15%? Well yes but typically the movements come in at about a fifth of that.</p>
<p>Our 45 year old has 22 years until retirement. 850/22=$38.50. Or .075% of payroll meaning that his losing number is 1.78%</p>
<p>Our 35 year old has 32 years until retirement. 850/32=$26.50. Or .053% of payroll meaning that his losing number is 1.75%</p>
<p>Our 25 year old has 42 years until retirement. 850/42=$20.23. Or .047% of payroll meaning that his losing number is 1.74%</p>
<p>So would some of our players have turned out to be nominal losers by not paying $850 last year. Well maybe, even probably. But that serves to discount the current utility of that $850 over the last year or conversely the amount he could earn in interest over the 22 or 32 or 42 years of work life.</p>
<p>Now that is the result if you take the narrowest view. What if you get a little more historical? The gap in 2005 was projected to be 1.92% which assuming a constant dollar $50,000 wage means $960 dollars not taxed or a total of $4800 left in our players pockets since the heights of the There is No Crisis battle of 2005. How much would the gap have to go up in a single year to have made &#8216;Nothing&#8217; a bad cumulative bet? 9.6% in a single year loses everybody money. But anything less than an increase of .79% makes our 55 year old a winner over the rest of his career and even our 25 year old (who probably started working in 2005) is okay as long as the increase does not go up more than .22% or a total of 1.92%. Which is to say that doing &#8216;Nothing&#8217; since 2005 was a worst an even bet for even the youngest worker even if we simply get back to 2005 levels of payroll gap. And the numbers get kind of staggering if you back a little further out and look at 1997 and that 2.23% gap. Now you are looking at $13,800 in foregone taxes. It would take a huge jump in the payroll gap over the medium term to offset that.</p>
<p>As you start adding in real world variables the case only gets stronger. For example that 1.7% number in the 2008 Report assumed a specific performance for 2008: productivity 1.9%, real wage 1.3%, real GDP 2.3%, average unemployment 4.8%. The very failures that serve to make the payroll gap bigger for the next Report equally prove that a 1.7% increase a year ago would not have been enough to fix the problem anyhow. And this doesn&#8217;t even touch the effects of such a tax increase in what we now know was already an economy in recession.</p>
<p>Will there come a time when we are kicking our collective selves because we clung too long to &#8216;Nothing&#8217;? Well almost certainly not for me, I am just 15 years from full retirement. If you are 25 your mileage will vary. But in my view the case is still very strong for &#8216;Nothing&#8217; until or unless the Trust Funds fall out of Short Term Actuarial Balance (TF ratio less than 100 in any of the next 10 years), which is the legal test for solvency. Which under current projections is about 2028.</p>
<p>But for those who insist that &#8216;We can&#8217;t afford to wait&#8217; there are two responses, one polite, one maybe not so. Polite: &#8216;bet me&#8217;, (the less polite one alliterates). And then make them show their work on the back of their paper.</p>

                                <p>by Bruce Webb.  Sorry for two posts in a day. But the raw data is important.<br />OAS (Old Age Survivor) starting 2008 balance $2.023 trillion<br />Intermediate Cost projection for year end $2.216 trillion<br />Low Cost projection for year end  $2.221 trillion<br />Preliminary year end balance $2.203 trillion or up $180 billion for the year.</p>
<p>DI (Disability) starting 2008 balance $214.9 billion<br />Intermediate Cost projection for year end $218.7 billion<br />Low Cost projection for year end $221.3 billion<br />Preliminary year end balance $215.8 billion or up just under $1 billion</p>
<p>Total OASDI surplus for 2008: $180.9 billion<br />Intermediate Cost projection: $196.2 billion<br />Low Cost Projection: $204.0 billion</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll take a program that is spinning off $181 billion surpluses. But I have to say the glass is half empty here. We can expect this to translate to some deterioration in the dates for shortfall and depletion with the release of the Report this spring</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Parts of the blogosphere are in an uproar over some Q&#038;A the other day that some interpreted as Obama putting Social Security &#8216;reform&#8217; on the table. Well for reasons outlined by Barkley Rosser (and posted below by Dan) I don&#8217;t think we have much to worry about to begin with. But even if the Obama team takes a look at Social Security and even if they end up tinkering with it, we still don&#8217;t need to worry. Because there is a big difference between Social Security &#8216;Transformers&#8217; and Social Security &#8216;Fixers&#8217;. Obama is a Fixer.</p>
<p>SS Transformers want to fundamentally change the system, most often into some set of Personal Retirement Accounts (PRAs). The motives of Transformers vary, you have one group whose intellectual leader was Milton Friedman and which drew its original inspiration from some combination of Ayn Rand and F. Hayek. For these people Social Security was either fundamentally immoral (Friedman&#8217;s word) or a dangerous step down the road to serfdom/socialism. Then you have a second group centered on Wall Street that simply saw fees and commissions to be had from a transformed system and a third group whose main motivation seems to be avoiding future claims by Social Security on the General Fund. These latter want to stabilize Social Security at a more or less stable share of GDP under the slogan of &#8216;sustainable solvency&#8217;. Now all three groups generally share a belief in the superior efficiency of free markets, that is most may sincerely believe that on balance PRAs will give superior results over the very long term (once you get some transition/legacy costs out of the way), but it really wouldn&#8217;t matter. Each would transform Social Security no matter what the actual outlook for the system as currently configured. Which is why supporters of Social Security cannot allow Transformers to even get their nose under the tent. Because before you know it we have the whole PRA camel inside and no easy way to get him out.</p>
<p>But we can listen to Fixers. Even if like me we really don&#8217;t think there is anything to fix. And I&#8217;ll tell you why under the fold.<br /> This post was originally meant to be the conclusion of <a href="http://bruceweb.blogspot.com/2009/01/social-security-crisis-and-reform.html">Social Security: &#8216;Crisis&#8217; and &#8216;Reform&#8217;</a> a post that got so long and tedious that I decided to spare AB readers and instead put it up at the BruceWeb where only diehards and/or the unlucky will stumble on it. In it I discuss the two types of &#8216;crisis&#8217;, that is &#8216;crisis at depletion&#8217; or the date that the Trust Fund goes to zero and &#8216;crisis at shortfall&#8217;, the date that revenue from taxation falls behind cost.</p>
<p>Taking the latter first. &#8216;Crisis&#8217; at shortfall is totally bogus. It implicitly denies that the Trust Fund is a binding obligation and vastly exaggerates what it would take to <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/08/soc-sec-xxxvii-financing-shortfall.html">Finance Shortfall</a>. People who push this brand of &#8216;crisis&#8217; knowingly or not are simply pawns of the Transformers. Now unfortunately the Obama plan even as modified falls into this camp. It proposes a solution consisting of directing more money at Social Security in 2019 for a problem which legally and numerically doesn&#8217;t actually manifest itself until about 2030, if it manifests at all. So that is not so good.</p>
<p>On the other hand this proposed solution actually would address the more real &#8216;crisis at depletion&#8217;. Under current projections Social Security will only be able to pay out 78% of the scheduled benefit starting sometime in 2041. Now opinions vary about whether this is really a crisis given that the reduction would still give a real benefit about 25% better than similarly situated retirees get today, but if that cut can be made smaller and/or more distant and done so in a progressive way that doesn&#8217;t reduce opportunities to advance the larger agenda we at least ought to listen. Because a cap increase would serve to reduce the needed benefit cut and move it out in time. So that is not at all all bad. But in any event it is not Transformation.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t believe that Obama is a Transformer. For that matter I don&#8217;t think that anyone on his team, including Jeffrey Liebman (co-author of LMS-a Transforming plan), is committed to Transformation for its own sake. While your true Transformer will never be convinced by arguments from Solvency, that being at best a secondary consideration for them, a Fixer can be so convinced.</p>
<p>But, and this is the important point, as long as you can keep Fixers from incorporating aspects of Transformation into their plans then nothing they do can do much in the way of permanent harm to Social Security, because the end goal of the Fixer is to fix something, and that something can only be the projected benefit reduction at TF depletion. Now there are two ways of tackling that 22% cut. One you can put in place measures that mitigate it. For example you could adjust the schedule in ways that reduce the benefit somewhat in the medium term so as to pay out maybe 90% of the benefit over the long run and so avoid the discontinuity in 2041. Or you could raise the benefit cap in a way that accomplishes much of the same outcome. Or tinker with retirement age. Now personally I am on record opposing benefit cuts and changes in retirement age. And equally am leery at any suggestion that we target taxes in ways that move Social Security away from its insurance model and towards a welfare model. I believe in &#8216;Nothing&#8217;, the proven plan for Social Security. But Fixes are not as likely to be permanent as Transformations. Moreover the practicalities suggest that any proposed fixes will have to be phased in, it being a constant theme that we cannot and should not change the rules for people on the immediate verge of retirement. Even Transformers accept this as an operating political reality, you see this adopted in Butler and Germanis from 1983, in Bush&#8217;s speeches in 2004 and in the subsequent Commission Report.</p>
<p>We saw exactly this with the 1983 Reform, the tax increase was phased in as was the gradual increase in retirement age, (for example my age for full retirement was set at 66 years, four months even though that retirement was at the time forty years away). Meaning we should expect any package of fixes that might be proposed by Obama to be equally phased in and as such subject to change depending on actual outcomes.</p>
<p>For example Obama&#8217;s only defined proposal thus far is for a cap increase. But even that has been deferred to 2019, which is to say right around the time of projected shortfall. We can expect that if the numbers come in in a way that pushes the date of shortfall back then we should expect the date of the tax increase to be pushed back. If part of the package changes the benefit formula in ways that threaten to produce a worse result than the 78% we are faced with today, then the new formula can be scrapped in favor of the old one. If increases in retirement age beyond the ones already scheduled are seen to be unneeded they too can go on the scrap heap. And of course the same goes for tax increases. If for example someone proposed to phase in a .2% a year increase in FICA for ten years and it was clear by year five that we had overcorrected then really not much harm has been done, we can halt or roll back the increases</p>
<p>So we don&#8217;t really need to worry about the Fixers. Certainly we need to keep an eye on them and continually point out the actual data projections and critique the assumptions that underly them, but as long as we keep them from wandering over to Transformer territory all should be well in the long run.</p>

                                <p>by Bruce Webb<br />What does it take? A stake through the heart? A bullet through the brain? Baker and Krugman do some pushback.<br />Dean Baker in his post <a target="_blank" href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/beat_the_press_archive?month=01&#038;year=2009&#038;base_name=the_posts_jihad_against_social">The Post&#8217;s Jihad against Social Security</a> points to this article <a target="_blank" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/01/06/AR2009010602849.html">Obama Predicts Years of Deficits over $1 trillion</a> and notes that they don&#8217;t hesitate to single out the usual suspect. Is it the cost of the war? The cost of the bailout? The cost of the stimulus package? Nope apparently those are just short term problems. Instead as always the first stop for deficit reform is Social Security.<br />
<blockquote>WaPo: The mounting debt has raised an alarm on Capitol Hill, where some Republicans and moderate Democrats are pressing Obama to tackle the looming challenge of skyrocketing Medicare and Social Security spending, and to adopt tough new budget rules to prevent future deficits from ballooning.</p></blockquote>
<p> Which leads Dean to reply with some exasperation:<br />
<blockquote>The article includes a comment about &#8220;the looming challenge of skyrocketing Medicare and Social Security spending. &#8221; Of course Social Security spending is not projected to skyrocket. It is projected to increase gradually, and its costs are fully covered by its own tax stream until 2048, according to the Congressional Budget Office&#8217;s latest projections.</p></blockquote>
<p>In a related note Paul Krugman poses the question in a Jan 5 post <a target="_blank" href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/01/05/a-bullet-dodged/">A Bullet Dodged</a><br />
<blockquote>What would have happened if George W. Bush had actually succeeded in his plan to privatize Social Security?</p></blockquote>
<p> and suggests an answer &#8216;Ask the Italians&#8217; <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601109&#038;sid=aty4gEh9wups&#038;refer=home">Bloomberg News: Italian Pensions Sapped by Private Funds Bush Backed</a></p>
<p>In my view it is practically criminal for policy makers to be wasting a second talking about Social Security given the very real possiblity we are headed for a new Great Depression. And so equally criminal for opinion makers to be twisting current events to pursue this old vendetta. It is a shame that people like Baker and Krugman still have to keep a vigilant eye out for the zombies intent on eating the flesh of Social Security. Maybe we can make a deal. If the Right will simply stop taking every possible opportunity to take a bite at Social Security then I promise to shut up. And then maybe we can let Krugman and Baker continue the really important discussion.</p>

                                <p>How is Social Security holding up given the terrible employment numbers? Well not as bad as I had feared.</p>
<p>OAS::Opening balance//Projected year end balance-Intermediate Cost//Y-O-Y Increase//Year end balance-Low Cost//Y-O-Y increase-Low Cost<br />$2.023 trillion // $2.216 trillion //$193 billion// $2.221 trillion// $198 billion</p>
<p>DI::Opening balance//Projected year end balance-Intermediate Cost//Y-O-Y Increase//Year end balance-Low Cost//Y-O-Y increase-Low Cost<br />$214.9 billion//$218.7 billion//$3.8 billion//$221.3 billion// $6.4 billion.<br />Per IV.A2 the opening balance for DI was $214.9 billion, projected year end under IC $218.7 billion, under LC $221.3 billion</p>
<p>June 30th/Mid-year: OAS $2.140 trillion// DI $220 billion</p>
<p>Aug 31st/Two-thirds: OAS $2.164 trillion// DI $219 billion</p>
<p>Sept 30th/Q3: OAS $2.177 trillion//  DI $219 billion</p>
<p>Oct 30th/Five-sixths: OAS $2.187 trillion// DI $218 billion</p>
<p>Nov 30th/Eleven twelvths: OAS $2.197 trillion//DI $217.5 billion. So what does all this mean? Well nothing really. Mostly the outlook is unchanged, which is why I&#8217;ll keep the brief discussion below the fold.</p>
<p>The DI (Disability Insurance) Trust Fund is more or less holding its own with the balance in recent months dropping by less than a billion a month. A reasonable year end estimate for this fund would be something over $216 billion which would put it  below both Intermediate Costs projection of $219 billion and Low Cost&#8217;s projection of $221 billion. Not great news but maybe what you would expect in the face of an extended downturn, if you had managed to stay in the regular work force during the boom but really would qualify for Disability the 2007-2008 period might be the right time to make the transition. But spin it how I will, and putting on a happy smile through gritted teeth, there is little doubt that the 2009 Report will show some degradation in the outlook for DI. And this true even though the year over year balance is still positive.</p>
<p>As for OAS. Well it is still running a surplus, but then a good part of that is accrued interest. And the same will be true for December, the Treasury will still be crediting interest on the existing portfolio of bonds and so we can expect some uptick, but a fair estimate is that OAS is kind of on auto-pilot right now. Still we can expect about an additional $10 billion in the TF by years end taking the total balance up to maybe S2.207 compared to Intermediate Cost projections of  $2.216 trillion and Low Cost Projections of $2.221 trillion. So once again we will probably see a miniscule deterioration in outlook come the release of the new Report come March. But once again the net year over year effect is to show continued surpluses.</p>
<p>You have to wonder how many other multi-trillion dollar funds saw slightly less than expected but still positive returns over the last year.</p>
<p>Bottom line. Social Security is not immune to periods of economic crisis, how could it  be. But it is buffered by being tied to real wage on the one hand and CPI on the other and calculates its health from the top down rather than the bottom up. That is a change in unemployment for 4.5% to 6.9% computes to more than a 50% increase when examined from the bottom up. And if you are out of work that may be the right metric. But from the point of view of Social Security that just means a drop from 84.5% to 73.1%  of covered workers paying in, meaning that payroll tax based worker retirement can never take the hit that individual workers do in any given year.</p>

<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.gao.gov/financial/fy2008/08frusg.pdf">2008 Financial Report of the United States Government (Report)</a>  provides the President, Congress, and the American people a comprehensive view of the Federal Government’s finances, i.e., its financial position and condition, its revenues and costs, assets and liabilities, and other obligations and commitments. The Report also discusses important financial issues and significant conditions that may affect future operations.  This year&#8217;s Report gives particular emphasis to two key issues: The Government&#8217;s response in recent months to the financial market crisis, and the Government&#8217;s capacity to sustain the funding and pay the benefits of key social insurance programs, such as Social Security and Medicare.</p></blockquote>
<p> Andrew Biggs once again tips us off to the release of valuable new Reports at his blog <a href="http://andrewgbiggs.blogspot.com/">Notes on Social Security Reform</a>. As it turns out the link was a little off, but anyone interested in Social Security owes it to themselves to read what Andrew has to say on the topic, if only to get a corrective to what you get here from me and Dale Coberly.</p>
<p>I have yet to read the Report and at this point in the evening am not likely too, still less comment on it. But here you have the GAOs 194 pg statement on the financial health of the United States including but not limited to Social Security/Medicare. Among other things it helps to understand some of the terminology used in budget discussions. In short this document gives you the economic world as the Bush Administration would have you see it. I present it to you unfiltered.</p>
<p>See you in comments.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Projecting the long-term health of Social Security is of necessity subject to uncertainty, the known unknowns if you will. But you can if you like sample the short term health by consulting Treasury&#8217;s <a href="http://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/tfmp/tfmp.htm">Monthly Trust Fund Reports</a> which gives balances to the penny with a one month lag, and compare them to the various projections of the 2008 Report. If it appears that the balances are coming in ahead of standard Intermediate Cost projections you can conclude that the outlook is by that amount better than expected. If those balances are coming in ahead of (fully funded) Low Cost then you have a limited reason to claim there may be no shortfall at all. On the other hand if the numbers look to not quite making it to IC levels then you want to pay some attention.</p>
<p>So how is Social Security holding up in the face of a recession now officially a year old? Well, looks like we need to pay some attention.</p>
<p>The 2008 Report projected that the year end balance in the OAS (Old Age/Survivors) Trust Fund would be:<br />Intermediate Cost $2.216 trillion and Low Cost $2.221 trillion up from a starting balance of $2.023 trillion</p>
<p>Actual numbers:<br />June (half year) $2.140 trillion<br />Aug (2/3rd)    $2.164 trillion<br />Sept (Q3)        $2.177 trillion<br />Oct                  $2.187 trillion</p>
<p>In June OAS had a balance up $117 bn from starting, if July to Dec simply duplicated that we would have a year end balance of $2.257 trillion or significantly ahead of even Low Cost numbers. But even then anyone who was paying attention knew there was trouble ahead and as things are playing out we will be lucky to end up within $10 billion of Intermediate Cost and so $15 billion from Low Cost. Not the best news but in perspective it means that our portfolio would only increase by 95% of expectations. (Note that this still translates to a big surplus for 2008, just not as big as we hoped.)</p>
<p>How did DI (Disability Insurance) fare? Well this is a real interesting story. Projections:<br />Intermediate Cost $219 billion and Low Cost $221 billion up from a starting balance of $214 billion</p>
<p>Actual numbers:<br />June (half year) $220 billion<br />Aug (2/3rd)    $219 billion<br />Sept (Q3)        $219 billion<br />Oct                  $218 billion</p>
<p>At mid-year things were looking pretty good, already the balance was up by some $6 billion and already beating IC projections. Certainly adding another billion and so matching Low Cost by year&#8217;s end in principle was in reach. Except for those pesky numbers in the business pages. Not only is DI not adding to its balance in the second half of the year, it is losing a good part of the progress made in the first half.</p>
<p>What does all of this mean? Well on my reading it shows that Social Security is a pretty robust system. And this makes certain sense, an increase in unemployment that puts hundreds of thousands of people out of work (say from 5% to 6%) is from another perspective just over 1% of all covered hours (94%/95% = 1.1%). This doesn&#8217;t mean we want to keep throwing these employment numbers at Social Security for an extended period of time, though I have never had much reason to discuss the more pessimistic High Cost scenario it like Low Cost is &#8216;out there&#8217; and we are openly flirting with it right now. But even High Cost looks pretty good when your 401k is 40% plus off its peak.</p>

                                <p>What fresh hell is THIS?<br />When I first started studying Social Security in detail sometime late in 1997 I made what to me was kind of an amazing discovery. Social Security &#8216;crisis&#8217; then and now tended to be perceived and discussed within the deterministic frame of Boomer Retirement, kind of a &#8216;demography makes destiny&#8217; thing. Every Boomer who would ever exist was already on the face of the planet and we had reasonably good data about longevity improvements. Which seem to leave us with an open and shut case: more Boomer retirees living longer vs a declining pool of workers equals crisis down the road. Thus it made some sense to talk and think about Social Security in fixed terms of Boomers becoming eligible for retirement at known points in known numbers resulting in Social Security going &#8216;broke&#8217; (however defined) at specific points in the future. The result is that reporting on Social Security tended to use deterministic language like &#8216;will&#8217; as in &#8220;The Trustees tell us the Trust Fund will run short in 2034&#8221;. (And for those who point out &#8216;I thought the date was 2041&#8217;, well that is the point of this piece.)</p>
<p>But when you actually examine the numbers it became clear that in fact they were doubly contingent with any given Annual Report projecting a range of potential outcomes (your &#8216;intra-contingency&#8221;) while successive Reports could and did have a different range (your &#8216;inter-contingency&#8217;). In each case the objective seemingly fixed &#8216;will&#8217; starts blurring into the subjunctive &#8216;would (assuming contingencies A, B, and C)&#8217;.</p>
<p>Well what does this gobbly-goop mean in real terms? Well lets start from the following table from EPI. <a href="http://www.epi.org/content.cfm/issueguides_socialsecurity_changes">Changes in Trustees Projections Over Time</a> If we just look at the first two columns for 1996 and 1997 we are presented with just what we would expect from our deterministic model: dates of Trust Fund depletion remaining set between years with the cost of the fix going up. Open and shut case for crisis? Well not so fast.</p>
<p>First we can examine the <a href="http://bruceweb.blogspot.com/2006/05/cost-of-inactivity-nothing-as-plan-for.html">Cost of Inactivity</a> on an inter-termporal basis. Not doing anything in 1996 meant the cost of the fix went up from an immediate hike in FICA of 2.19% to fix SS  to an increase of 2.23% or a change of .03% of payroll. But the flip side of that is that not doing anything had the effect of LEAVING 2.19% of 1996 your payroll dollar in your and your employer&#8217;s pocket in 1996 for that year. If we simply ignore the effects of current utility of that dollar, of current year interest, and of current year inflation we can calculate that it would take 2.19/.03 or 73 years before &#8216;Nothing&#8217; became a nominally bad bet for 1996. If we add in the effects of utility, interest and inflation we can see that each makes &#8216;Nothing&#8217; just that much more a good bet. Let&#8217;s say that you made $30,000 in 1996. 2.19% of that is $657 which given the employee/employer split means $328.50 in take home pay (more if you take the classical position that the real incidence of the employer match falls on the employee). It doesn&#8217;t take a huge rate of real return to make a diversion of that $328 into some other investment pay off; calculated in terms of risk/reward a strategy of &#8216;Nothing&#8217; made sense in 1996. That is in retrospect. On the other hand it would have taken a real deterioration in outlook and a pretty big boost in payroll gap to make &#8216;Nothing&#8217; a losing bet in real terms.</p>
<p>If we examine the remaining columns in the table we can see that &#8216;Nothing&#8217; turned out to be a winning bet both in nominal and real terms each year from 1997 to 2004, in each year &#8216;Nothing&#8217; left money in your pocket while the Cost of Inactivity actually went down, &#8216;crisis&#8217; steadily got pushed out in time and shrunken in magnitude. Now certainly you wouldn&#8217;t &#8216;know&#8217; this in advance, on an inter-temporal basis the contingency is kind of out of your control and critics might just claim you got lucky. Well maybe, but in actuality the numbers fell out as they did. And there was pretty good reason to expect that they would.</p>
<p>Why? Well it is the intra-temporal contingency. As it turns out the Social Security Report does not project a single outcome, instead each provides a range of outcomes with their best guess giving a mid-point Intermediate Cost alternative with a more optimistic Low Cost marking one end of the probability range and a more pessimistic High Cost marking the other. Now one can, and I do, dispute that the Office of the Chief Actuary has actually properly presented the range and so argue that Intermediate Cost is in fact too pessimistic, but for our narrow purposes today we can lay that aside. Instead we can just examine the first year numbers in terms of the Cost of Inactivity. If we take our strategy of &#8216;Nothing&#8217; and actual numbers come in in line with Intermediate Cost we can expect a positive Cost of Inactivity which we can then if we choose discount for assumed real interest. On the other hand if the numbers come in better than Intermediate Cost the Cost of Inactivity shrinks even before any discounting. And if the numbers happen to come in near the top of the range the Cost of Inactivity actually goes negative, meaning dollars left in your pocket with no downside at all.</p>
<p>Now getting back to the numbers. When I read the 1997 Report I noticed two things. One was that the 1996 Low Cost projection resulted in a straight out fix of Social Security, doing &#8216;Nothing&#8217; would produce a fully-funded Social Security system with no changes in payroll tax, benefits or retirement age. And what kind of economic performance would be needed? As it runs out only a future that more or less mirrored 1996. If the future on average looked like the immediate past we would be home free. But we did not need to make a bet on Low Cost long term, we did not need a crystal ball to calculate the Cost of Inactivity for any given year, instead we only need to look at the current year numbers in the newspaper. If 1997 underperformed 1996 but came in better than Intermediate Cost we could expect the Cost of Inactivity to shrink and possibly go negative (i.e. leave dollars behind and a smaller projected gap going forward). By the time I saw the 1997 Report the year was mostly over and it didn&#8217;t take a lot of bravery to predict that year end would look better than IC projections. And so it proved, the 1998 Report showed a payroll gap down from 2.23% back to 2.19%. And ten more years of Nothing has brought the gap down to 1.70%.</p>
<p>Which is why I laugh in the faces of people who claim I am being naive in claiming that Social Security is Not Broke. They imagine that I am betting long on Low Cost when in reality I am betting short against Intermediate Cost. Now as it turns out it looks like 2008 will turn out to be a least a nominal loser for me, we will see with the release of the next Report in March. But I am still betting that the real Cost of Inactivity by adopting a strategy of Nothing will prove to be a winner over the medium term and probably over the long term, because while my bet may be short term nothing is keeping me from peeking at numbers for the out years and the Inter-temporal contingencies are pretty low hanging fruit.</p>
<p>In any event there is no &#8216;will&#8217; associated with any projection whether that be short or long term. Each Report year presents us with new dynamic models with new intra-temporal and inter-temporal data sets which can only be properly evaluated using concepts like &#8216;if&#8217; and &#8216;if and only if&#8217;. The standard deterministic &#8216;Baby Boomer demographics&#8217; model just doesn&#8217;t capture the contingencies. And talking points that may have been reasonable enough in 1996 are stale, stale, stale today. A fact that seems to elude a certain subset of commentators here.</p>

<p>PGL raises and answers this question over at Econospeak <a href="http://econospeak.blogspot.com/2008/11/healthcare-debate-so-this-is-why.html">Health Care Debate: So This is Why Conservatives Hate Social Security</a>. Or rather he allows Conservatives in the person of Michael Cannon at Cato admit the fundamental truth: successful government social programs fatally undercut future political success for the Right. Cannon: <a href="http://www.cato-at-liberty.org/2008/11/13/blocking-obamas-health-plan-is-key-to-the-gops-survival">Blocking Obama&#8217;s Health Plan is Key to the GOP&#8217;s Survival</a></p>
<p>PGL sums it up as follows:<br />
<blockquote>Truth be told – this is a major reason why conservatives want to undermine the Social Security program. Yes – they do try to tell us it’s some sort of Ponzi scheme, which of course, is just blatant dishonesty. But the real reason that they hate Social Security is that it is popular – as well as good policy from the perspective of those who care at least as much about the working class as the investor class.</p></blockquote>
<p> Another way of saying this is that the debate over Social Security is not and never really has been about the best way to insure retirement security for workers, opponents simply don&#8217;t care that their numbers don&#8217;t add up, when indeed they use numbers at all. Instead they approach the subject from two conjoined perspectives: one that Social Security (and Universal Health Care coverage) is Socialism and/or two that Social Security (and Universal Health Care) if perceived to be successful are political winners for the Democrats for possibly decades to come.</p>
<p>In practice it is hard to separate out the Hayekians who believe that all of this is just the first steps on the <a href="http://www.mises.org/books/TRTS/">Road to Serfdom</a> from the Rovians who believe that successful social programs are instead the Road to Political Oblivian for the Republican Party from the Sheep who simply know what they have been told. And of course these groups all to a degree cross-cut, it is difficult to reliably differentiate knave from fool. But no one who cares about Social Security or Universal Health Care coverage should assume that the opposition they encounter are solely motivated by data about program effectiveness and relative costs, that you are going to get through to these people by explaining how small the problem is in the case of Social Security or how honest cross-country cost/outcome numbers show that other developing countries get more bang for their health care buck, that is to make the simple mistake that political discourse on these topics is fundamentally Reality Based instead of being what it really is: driven by ideology on one hand and political outcomes on the other.</p>
<p>For many, many people the claim &#8220;There is no Crisis&#8221; is not the answer to a specific problem, instead it IS the problem. Without &#8216;Crisis&#8217; they got nothing. And the smarter, better informed ones know it (hence the whiff of panic floating around the halls of Cato).</p>
