<p>Yes. Both. But first a recap. The semi-final version of the basic NW Plan was introduced in this post: <a target="_blank" href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/05/nw-plan-for-real-social-security-fix.html">NW Plan for a Real Social Security Fix</a>. The spreadsheets linked to that post show that under current projections you can fix Social Security by implementing a 0.20% FICA increase in 2010, another of 0.10% in 2011, followed by a series of 0.20% increases in 2026-2036. The NW Plan doesn&#8217;t set those future increases in stone, instead they are tied to a specific trigger, the date that either fund that comprise Social Security falls out of the Trustees primary official test, that of Short Term Actuarial Balance. As it happens DI already failed that test last year which explains the immediate increases for 2010 and 2011. But OAS retains a significant degree of uncertainty. For example even though CBO starts from the same set of demographic assumptions as SSA, their different treatments of the economic numbers result in wide variations between their median outcomes. The CBO projections from Aug 2008 can be seen at the following post <a target="_blank" href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/05/probability-and-social-security.html">Probability and Social Security</a>. The most current SSA projections can be seen in the following figure:<br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SiLde2UaOkI/AAAAAAAAAPE/CiD4NEdmI-A/s1600-h/2009+Fig+IV.B3.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SiLde2UaOkI/AAAAAAAAAPE/CiD4NEdmI-A/s400/2009+Fig+IV.B3.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />(Update: the above figure is from the 2009 Report, the original post included the version from the 2008 (below). Sorry about that.)<br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/ShWTahfDs5I/AAAAAAAAAOU/b9o84WPcj7c/s1600-h/OAS+and+DI+long+term+ratios.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/ShWTahfDs5I/AAAAAAAAAOU/b9o84WPcj7c/s400/OAS+and+DI+long+term+ratios.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />The differences between CBO and SSA are explained in large part by different assumptions and methodology but are also effected by being different snapshots in time, SSA building in data for Q3 and Q4 of calender 2008 and Q1 2009 not available to CBO last summer.</p>
<p>So the Northwest Plan is being worked up as a Policy Plan to be presented to policy analysts and policy makers. But like all batttle plans it is unlikely to escape all effects of contact with the enemy, which in this case is the uncertainty of the projections. What the Northwest Plan does is to close both the Short Term and Long Term actuarial gap under the Trustees most current set of assumptions and definitions and provides a mechanism for adjusting the tax schedule each year in anticipation of events as yet fifteen to twenty years down the road. Rather than revisiting the issue every decade or two it provides for a permanent yet flexible fix that in turn allows us to focus if we wish on other measures that might move that future trigger point farther out in time.</p>
<p>For example if we examine the above graph we see that DI (light gray) has vastly more variation than OAS. Under the NW Plan the light gray line that current intersects with zero in 2025 instead would exit the 75 year window right at 180. But if we examine outcome I we see that line exiting the window at above 2000. Oddly it is politically hazardess for Social Security if its Trust Fund balances remain permanently north of a ratio of 300 or so. If over the next few years it looks like DI is on a course approaching outcome I we would want to divert a portion of the 2010 and 2011 increases, which are under the NW Plan devoted to DI, over to OAS. This in turn would serve to move the trigger point for OAS, perhaps imperceptably, perhaps noticeably. But we don&#8217;t have to rely on chance events, lowering future costs for DI is a matter of lowering the incidence of disability or of tightening eligibility. I&#8217;ll let Nancy Ortiz speak to the latter, from what I hear if anything the rules are too tight and the administration too disfunctional already. On the other hand it would be useful to focus on the differences between Intermediate Cost (II) assumptions on incidence and Low Cost (I) and then work on ways to achieve improved outcomes. For example it is possible that better enforcement of existing workplace safety law might directly serve to drive down disability generally and hence need for DI and in turn reducing DIs impact on OAS.</p>
<p>In this way the OAS trigger set by the NW Plan for 2026 can be an explicit target for economic policy. Once you change your model from the deterministic one typical of today, &#8220;Social Security will go to depletion in year X&#8221;, instead we should be thinking &#8220;What can we do in 2010 to push that trigger point back, or use it to increase benefits&#8221;. In that way the NW Plan frees us to approach Social Security pro-actively rather than passively.</p>
<p>The NW Plan provides a Social Security fix that is at the same time permanent, flexible in the face of events, and modifiable by direct action by policy. It is certainly worth a try.</p>
<p>But the title of the post also says it is a benchmark. How so? Answer below the fold.</p>
<p>On the merits &#8216;Nothing&#8217; has been shown to be a perfectly sound plan. That is instead of rasing taxes by $1/week as the NW Plan does we could reallocate current FICA between DI and OAS in a way that made their future shortfall and depletion dates congruent and then start trying to move the joint trigger point outwards via economic policy. This would mirror past practice. But &#8216;Nothing&#8217; is a tough sell, it implies that the people pushing it are in some sort of denial rather than what is the case, that examination of the data shows &#8216;Nothing&#8217; to be on net a historical proven plan since 1997. But rather than continually rebattling that war we propose the implementation of the NW Plan to at least serve as a benchmark.</p>
<p>Because the NW Plan is scorable, it has numbers that can be checked and against which conclusions can be drawn such as &#8220;Yes under Intermediate Cost assumptions the NW Plan would put Social Security into Short and Long Term Actuarial balance at a cost of X dollars in 2010, Y dollars in 2011 and Zetc dollars in years 2026 and following.&#8221;  Which then allows us to challenge any other plan to match up dollar for dollar. What does their plan cost in the form of foregone benefits or increased taxes in any future year? If it doesn&#8217;t actually provide better retirement benefits at a lower cost what are its offsetting advantages that would induce workers to take the deal? Put your numbers on the table and lets compare.</p>
<p>It is one of the striking features of the overall Social Security debate that future impacts for any given year are rarely if ever spelled out. Yes under Intermediate Cost assumptions cash income from taxation falls behind cost in 2017. What does that mean for 2017? or 2023? Yes if we do nothing on Social Security the system will only have projected resources to pay out 75% of benefits in 2037? What does that mean in real terms? Well you never know because the argument always moves form &#8216;Crisis&#8217; to &#8216;Benefit cuts&#8217; without anyone pausing to quantify the effects or reflect on alternatives.</p>
<p>Well the Northwest Plan is such an alternative. It provides 100% of the scheduled benefit while maintaining the Trust Funds in actuarial balance through the current 75 year window. Plus it offers a mechanism that allows Social Security to maintain that state over the Infinite Future if you like. Want to wipe $15.3 trillion dollars in unfunded liability off the U.S.&#8217;s books tomorrow? Enact the NW Plan.</p>
<p>Of course it will cost you a $1.50 a week by year two. Maybe that is a deal breaker, but at least people need to explain why that shoud be. Over to you all.</p>

I am not going to discuss them in depth but just point out that we trap ourselves when we say Oh-mi-God Social Security depletion moved back from 2041 to 2037!!&#8221; when the reality is that it is just the center point of the probability distribution that so moved. There is still a 50% chance that the result will be better than that and of course 50% that it will be worse. But we are free to act in such a way that moves that probability ban the other way. The Northwest Plan just being the simplest.</p>
<p>Of course there is also a 10% chance that Social Security if left alone actually ends up over-funded even if we do nothing at all. Meaning we should not freak out every time the mid-point of the distribution moves.</p>

<p>The following piece is so bad that I won&#8217;t even put any of it above the fold, nor will I waste my time critiquing it. But people should know that the battle over Social Security is not over, crap like this is routinely delivered via our major media voices.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/199167">Robert Samuelson in Newsweek: Let Them Go Bankrupt, Soon<br />Solving Social Security and Medicare</a></p>
<p>Have at it, I just don&#8217;t have the heart to take this stale argument on yet again. And if any of you Angry Bears has better plans for the weekend certainly don&#8217;t drop them for this. I just wanted to have him on record.</p>
<blockquote><p>When the trustees of Social Security and Medicare recently reported on the economic outlook for these programs, the news coverage was universally glum. The recession had made everything worse. Social Security, Medicare face insolvency sooner, headlined The Wall Street Journal. Actually, these reports were good news. Better would have been Social Security, Medicare risk bankruptcy in 2010.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s increasingly obvious that Congress and the president (regardless of which party is in power) will deal with the political stink bomb of an aging society only if forced. And the most plausible means of compulsion would be for Social Security and Medicare to go bankrupt: trust funds run dry; promised benefits exceed dedicated payroll taxes. The sooner this happens, the better. (cont)</p></blockquote>
<p> It only gets worse from there. One final note, if this sounds vaguely Leninist that is because it is.</p>

This is what the result of implementing DI and OAS Triggers immediately would look like. 100% of scheduled benefits, no increase in retirement age, ending Trust Fund ratio of 123. This should be considered a baseline for policy, it may be that we would want to target policy in ways that would reduce ultimate tax rates, and it may be that the economy just does that for us. But this is what a tax based fix looks like: a couple of years of adjustments initially, a decade of small adjustments after 2026, followed by long stretches when no changes need be made at all.</p>

                                <p>by Bruce Webb, data by Coberly</p>
<p>Coberly has now produced new spreadsheets updated in light of the new numbers of the 2009 Report. Copies of past and current spreadsheets are available at our Google Group <a target="_blank" href="http://groups.google.com/group/realsocialsecurityfix/edit/northwest-plan-for-a-real-social-security-fixthe?">RealSocialSecurityFix</a>&#8216;s Northwest Plan page. (It should be viewable by anyone). The new Trigger ones linked below.<br />(UPDATE: Hot off the press, the combined <a target="_blank" href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=r49_nOHQG4QdHuwcbMGmP0Q">OASDI Trigger Plan</a>. Coberly has simplified and improved the labeling and data presentation).</p>
<p>The newest version treats the DI (Disability Insurance) and OAS (Old Age/Survivors Insurance) individually instead as just part of a combined OASDI. This has a few advantages including the big one that it allows a smoothing and phasing of the tax increases in a way that the impact will be barely perceptible in any given year. Moreover it allows those increases to occur or not in relation to specific Triggers.</p>
<p>The Trustees of Social Security measure the health of two insurance programs by two tests: Short Term Actuarial Balance which is measured over a 10 year period and Long Term Actuarial Balance which is measured over a 75 year period. In 2003 they introduced a new measure which calculates that balance over the Infinite Future Horizon. Our view is that Infinite Future was purely a gimmick introduced to allow new huge scary numbers to be introduced, others including some big name economists who are out there defending Social Security disagree. In any event Coberly and I are not going to bother with it, as the numbers run if you fix the 75 year problem you mostly fix the 100 year problem and there is no real gap between year 100 and Infinity anyway. (If you take the actuarial balance for &#8216;Future Participants&#8217;, i.e. everyone under the age of 15 and people yet unborn, the ystem is in long term surplus of $1.2 trillion <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/2009/IV_LRest.html#267012">Table IV.B7.—Present Values of OASDI Cost Less Tax Revenue and Unfunded Obligations for Program Participants</a>)</p>
<p>The NW Plan is designed to kick in right as either DI or OAS fail the test of Short Term Actuarial Balance and phase in tax increases in a way that allows the Trust Fund to meet both the Short Term and Long Term tests. The plans are flexible in that the Trigger points and the size and phasing of the increases can be changed as new Report Years roll in. And rather than quarrell that SSA is too pessimistic or CBO too optimistic we propose to just run with SSA, if CBO turns out to more correct then all the better, you just tinker with the formula giving everyone years and years to plan. That is the NW Plan takes much of the drama out of Social Security.</p>
<p>As it turns out the Trigger point for DI already happened, it failed the Short Term test a year ago. Meaning that changes have to kick in right away. <a target="_blank" href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=rckNH41TQyi31ucuLmJ7jlg">DI Trigger: 2009 Report</a>. This means an increase in the DI portion of the FICA tax by <s>0.02%</s> 0.20% in 2010, another <s>0.01%</s> 0.10% in 2011, and another <s>0.01%</s> 0.10% in 2039 (updating to 2009 numbers caused a small change in the later two dates). For a median income household and assuming the employer/employee spllit this works out around $1 per week in year one.</p>
<p>OAS is a different story, although it too took a hit in 2009 the result was not to move the Trigger much. If the NW Plan had been in effect over the last couple of years none of the attempted hysteria around &#8216;Vanishing Surplus&#8217; would have happened, in reality events over the last year have only marginally effected the larger picture. <a target="_blank" href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=r0bnfpwYop3MiPPNXAEY-7w">OASI Trigger: 2009 Report</a>. Now it looks like restoring Social Security to Short and Long Term Actuarial Balance requires tax boosts of <s>0.02%</s> 0.20% per year (once again about a $1 a week for the median income household) for the ten years starting in 2026. Starting in 2036 those increases slow to only needing to change every four to ten years.</p>
<p>These numbers are subject to change with every Report Year, in fact that is one of the points. We don&#8217;t really now what 2012 is going to bring, CBO and OMB numbers start diverging broadly after that, if we were using CBO numbers for the Northwest Plan the cost of the fix would be roughly half of that shown in the spreadsheets. The NW Plan is designed to be a flexible planning tool that can respond to new data in real time. Or we could lock ourselves into policy based on assumptions about economic performance after the dawn of the 22nd century and on to the Infinite Future. A better choice for those people would be to relax and watch Star Trek. BTW if you want some Social Security Sci-Fi, follow me below the fold.</p>
<p>Because Low Cost is out there. Relatively few people pay attention to Low Cost and this even in the face of a series of years from 1997 to 2003 or so where the economy consistently returned better numbers than even Low Cost projected and so rapidily moved the date of Trust Fund Depletion back and shrank the payroll gap. The years since then have not been as kind to Low Cost but similarly show that Intermediate Cost remains too pessimistic over the long run. Which means that in addition to monitoring Short Term Actuarial Balance we also need to keep an eye on Long Term, simply to avoid over-funding Social Security.</p>
<p>Why is over-funding Social Security a problem? Well I outlined it in one of my first posts at AB, in fact I actually lifted that from a previous post at the Bruce Web prior to my having AB posting privileges. <a target="_blank" href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/05/bw-on-soc-sec-x-danger-of-low-cost.html">The Danger of Low Cost</a><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SADOtVr0TII/AAAAAAAAABQ/eeojMDCa8S0/s1600-h/Snapshot+2008-04-02+10-08-52.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SADOtVr0TII/AAAAAAAAABQ/eeojMDCa8S0/s320/Snapshot+2008-04-02+10-08-52.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />This figure is from the original post and so is from the 2008 Report, it is not much changed with the 2009 (see figure II.D6). In this figure a flat line represents a constant TF ratio, meaning that all income equals all costs with enough left over to maintain a constant reserve. But it not healthy for the country or for Social Security for that line to go flat at too high a level. Because that means that Social Security would be relying to a greater degree on interest earned on the Trust Fund. And while there is nothing phony about the excess FICA tax that has been paid since 1983, that was real money borrowed from workers that was put to use in the real economy hopefully in a way that increased productivity down the road. But whatever utility that spending had it is ultimately discounted by the interest being extracted from the future economy and this is particularly so if that interest is just left to compound endlessly. From 2006 <a target="_blank" href="http://bruceweb.blogspot.com/2006/01/interest-on-interest-threat.html">Interest on Interest: a Threat</a> If the Trust Fund settles out with a TF ratio of 500 this implies that 25% of Cost is being covered by General Fund transfers in the form of Interest. Well that still leaves Social Security 75% pay-go from current workers. But as the decades go on the people who originally paid in those extra taxes prior to shortfall in 2017 gradually die off leaving this unproductive albatross behind and ultimately retirees are to some degree getting a free ride based on sacrifices made by earlier generations. Indeed if the Trust Fund goes to 1000 then fully half of Cost could be met from Interest, making it into somewhat of a welfare plan.</p>
<p>So how do we escape this possible long term trap? Well I suggested a variety of approaches on my blog in 2005-2006 but they all boil down to targetting Long Term as well as Short Term. I called this the 100/100 Plan in the days before Coberly supplied numbers. Under DI Trigger the TF ratio drops as low as 107 in the mid 2030&#8217;s which triggers the third and final increase in 2039 which gradually increases the TF ratio to the 180s. This isn&#8217;t a bad spot, it leaves DI as a little over 90% pay-go, but you don&#8217;t want to see it go much higher. Meaning that at some point we might want to reverse the 2039 increase and then maybe roll back the 2011 and 2010 increases as well. Because the following is NOT a good outcome.<br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/ShWTahfDs5I/AAAAAAAAAOU/b9o84WPcj7c/s1600-h/OAS+and+DI+long+term+ratios.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/ShWTahfDs5I/AAAAAAAAAOU/b9o84WPcj7c/s400/OAS+and+DI+long+term+ratios.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />The pale grey line is DI and alternative II is Intermediate Cost. We want the II line to flatten, but we have no reason for it to continue to rise. Under Low Cost outcomes or anything approaching it we would by 2019 or so seriously considering cancelling the 2039 increase and then potentially rolling back earlier increases to target a 100-200 range for TF ratio. The black line is OASI. Under Intermediate Cost the Trigger point is set around the 2026-2028 date range. Under Low Cost the Trigger point is never reached and in fact we might even to decide to schedule some gradual tax decreases after 2017 to bring total income in line with cost and put the TF on a glide bath to 100/100.</p>
<p>So the Northwest Plan offers both a carrot and a stick. To the extent that Social Security projects not to diliver a 100% benefit it proposes some mild and phased in increases in tax. If workers are able to boost productivity and more importantly in a way that garners them a fairer share in that productivity than they got over the last eight years we can sweeten that with a possible payroll tax rate cut. Don&#8217;t want even a small increase in FICA rates in 2026? Demand better Real Wages in the meantime. There is more than one way to skin the cat of retirement security, the Northwest Plan is just a mechanism to keep the opposition from simply slashing future benefits just because they don&#8217;t want to pay back the money they borrowed.</p>

<p>Michael Lind wrote an interesting article for Salon that was picked up by the New America Foundation under the snappy title <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newamerica.net/publications/articles/2009/lets_cut_social_security_pay_banker_bailouts_13489">Let&#8217;s Cut Social Security to Pay for Banker Bailouts!</a>. In it he outlines arguments that will be familiar to followers of Angry Bear&#8217;s Social Security coverage, notably pointing out the &#8216;message&#8217; campaign outlined by Stuart Butler and Peter Germanis in 1983 with the publication of &#8216;Social Security Reform: Achieving a &#8216;Leninist&#8217; Strategy&#8217;, something discussed here last May.<a target="_blank" href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/05/bw-on-soc-sec-v-what-does-lenin-have-to.html">What does Lenin have to do with it?</a> Well this caused Andrew Biggs to strike back at what Biggs calls &#8220;lefty claptrap&#8221; in his own article <a target="_blank" href="http://www.american.com/archive/2009/may-2009/the-straw-men-of-social-security">The Strawmen of Social Security</a>. In the course of this he refers us to this SSA Actuarial Note with its own snappy title <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/NOTES/ran5/an2008-5.pdf">INTERNAL REAL RATES OF RETURN UNDER THE OASDI PROGRAM FOR HYPOTHETICAL WORKERS</a> He summarizes it as follows:<br />
<blockquote>First, fairness: Social Security’s treatment of different generations of Americans is declining, such that those who retire in the near future will receive much higher benefits relative to their taxes than those who retire later. For instance, this study from the Social Security Administration shows that a typical couple retiring today will receive around a 2.3 percent rate of return from Social Security, while a typical couple retiring in 2050 will receive around a 1.7 percent return. Compounded over a full career of paying taxes, these differences amount to a lot. By acting today, we can lower returns a little for near-retirees so we do not need to hit future retirees as hard.</p></blockquote>
<p> Is that a fair summary of the Note? Well no, that is in fact a strawman so flimsy that you don&#8217;t know if it will burn up or simply blow away. For example what the hell does &#8216;typical&#8217; mean in context?</p>
<p>To answer that we need to look at the data tables. Reproduced below the fold.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/ShGfSSSJClI/AAAAAAAAAOE/LmTfWbL-oxg/s1600-h/Actuarial+Note+Table+4-5.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/ShGfSSSJClI/AAAAAAAAAOE/LmTfWbL-oxg/s400/Actuarial+Note+Table+4-5.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/ShGfSWuC1SI/AAAAAAAAAOM/cbrtwHBgViE/s1600-h/Actuarial+Note+Table+6.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/ShGfSWuC1SI/AAAAAAAAAOM/cbrtwHBgViE/s400/Actuarial+Note+Table+6.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />So where is our typical couple? Well you won&#8217;t find them, in fact the whole point of the study was to see how Social Security performs for all couples across generations. And it turns out that depends a lot on where that couple is situated. For example for our hypothetical couple retiring today if either husband or wife have incomes classified as &#8216;low&#8217; or &#8216;very&#8217; low their Internal Real Rate of return ranges from 3.0 to 4.6%. In order to get a return at Biggs&#8217; level you would have to have a combination of &#8216;medium&#8217; and &#8216;medium&#8217;. Now while it is possible that medium + medium = median = mean and so &#8216;typical&#8217; is how Biggs read the situation. But aan examination of Table A shows that &#8216;medium&#8217; is defined as $38,651 meaning a household wage income of $77 thousand which is significantly above median household income. For Biggs it seems that &#8216;typical&#8217; means comfortably middle class (and yes, yes, yes I know people say you can&#8217;t live in LA or NY on less than $300,000, that doesn&#8217;t make them &#8216;typical&#8217;).</p>
<p>So when I look at these tables I take away a very different lesson.  Social Security has been a really good deal for those making under the median and a great deal for those nearer the bottom. On the other hand if you or your spouse or both have &#8216;high&#8217; incomes defined as $62 thousand a year it is a only kinda good deal. If you restrict yourself to this narrow measure. But as the authors of the actual note tell us (bolding mine):<br />
<blockquote>Because the Social Security program has operated on a largely pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) basis, the level of contributions of each generation of workers is not directly related to the benefits they will receive. Under a PAYGO plan, benefits are not based on the accumulation of individual contributions, as in a defined contribution plan, nor are annual contributions determined based on scheduled future benefits of current workers and beneficiaries, as in an advance-funded defined benefit plan. <br />Rather, the combined amount of contributions from workers and employers needed to fund the system is largely determined by the total amount of benefits to be paid for any year. Thus, internal rates of return for a PAYGO-financed benefit program are only theoretical indicators of the apparent value for contributions on an individual or cohort basis. On this <br />basis, with administrative expenses of less than 1 percent of total program cost, the real value of OASDI benefits is extraordinarily high. <br />Internal rate of return does not reflect the full value of insurance in reducing the risk for extreme outcomes, such as death or disability at very young ages or survival to very old ages. In addition, calculations of the internal rate of return from Social Security benefits are not fully adequate for making comparisons with private-sector plans, since many features of Social Security benefits are not typically available in private-sector plans. Examples include guaranteed cost-of-living adjustments <br />based on the Consumer Price Index, and benefits for life in the event of disability. However, internal rates of return are of value for exploring the relative value of benefits provided across generations and types of workers. </p></blockquote>
<p> Oh and that future &#8216;typical&#8217; couple retiring in 2050 who are only getting 1.7% per Biggs? Turns out that includes only those couples whose incomes BOTH score as &#8216;high&#8217;. If you both score &#8216;very low&#8217;? The new retired couple of today? 4.61%. The trampled on retirees of 2050? 4.54%. Man the intergenerational inequity just screams out here. Not.</p>
<p>So that funny smell is some combination of freshly picked cherries and straw burning up.</p>

<p>For those following along. Recent numbers from CBO and now from Social Security show that the DI (Disability Insurance) component of Social Security is officially broken, it failed the test for Short Term Actuarial Balance last year. And when combined with the OAS component brought Trust Fund depletion forward by four years from 2041 to 2037. But on inspection only about six months of that was the direct result of a revenue dip on the OAS (Old Age/Survivors) side, if the economy recovers along the lines projected by OMB OAS may well be fine long term. So we propose fixing DI, which is broken, and leaving OAS alone until it too trips a trigger for action. If it ever does.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=rwlhhEKv9PcVzR3mr2XL5yw">DI Trigger: Google Spreadsheet</a></p>
<p>0.2% increase in 2010 plus another 0.1% in 2012 plus another 0.1% in 2045 sends DI through the 75 year window with a Trust Fund Ratio of 159. Assuming the employer/employee split this means the average laborer earning $12.50/hour would have to come up with a whopping 50 cents a week to ensure that his disability benefits were no longer at risk.</p>

If Social Security really was in a serious crisis you would expect the right hand column to show steady increases, a policy of &#8216;Nothing&#8217; which deducts one year of potential revenue or cost savings from any given &#8216;fix&#8217; should make the gap for the next year wider. And we can see that pattern in the years from 1993 to 1997. When Krugman said Social Security was in trouble back in 1996 he was right. When people like Bush made the same claim in 2004 they were wrong, the earth had moved under their feet. When I first starting blog commenting back in the 2001-2002 period I was pretty damn confident that the economy would simply grow out of crisis.</p>
<p>Well eight years of Bushonomics has made me more wary but on the whole still hopeful, because after all we are still way improved from where we were in 1997. On the other hand you can&#8217;t deny that the current recession is not helping. Something that is even more apparent if you examine the DI (Disability Insurance) component of Social Security in isolation from the OASI (Old Age/Survivors) component. </p>
<p>Last Sunday Coberly and I released the first iteration of the <a target="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/05/northwest-plan-real-fix-for-social.html">Northwest Plan</a> which outline two different methods of fixing a combined OASDI program via payroll tax. One called &#8216;Tenth Now&#8217; starts a fix in 2010 and gradually raises payroll tax by 0.1% for 20 years and then freezes the rate until 2053. The other called &#8216;Trigger&#8217; instead targets the date that Social Security falls out of Short Term Actuarial Balance which under current projections is around 2028. &#8216;Trigger&#8217; which in reality is just a modified version of our previous plan of &#8216;Nothing&#8217; is a better policy option. But only if you combine OASI and DI into OASDI (as is usually done). But &#8216;Nothing&#8217; is not really a plan for DI which actually fell out of Short Term Balance last year and has been running cash deficits for two years before that. So as soon as Coberly gets done running the numbers we expect to release an actual policy proposal for a Real Social Security Fix which I am tentatively calling &#8216;DI Now/OAS Trigger. The DI Now component will set some small increases for DI in place, while the OAS Trigger will continue to target Short Term Actuarial Balance as the trigger point for action.</p>
<p>The Northwest Plan is not the last word but what it does is establish a basis for pricing other plans. With NW Plan numbers in hand we can reasonably ask say what the cost of avoiding an increase in retirement age would be, or what the cost of avoiding a switch from wage based indexing of initial benefits to price based indexing. What are workers actually being asked to sacrifice to avoid the NW Plan price? I think when workers get that answer they will opt to stick with traditional Social Security and ante up the quarter.</p>
<p>The initial version of the NW Plan is in the hands of some people at SSA, as soon as we have spreadsheets for DI Now/OAS Trigger using 2009 numbers that will get forwarded on as well. But the truth is that we can fix Social Security for literally pennies a day per worker and don&#8217;t need to pay attention to hysterical Henny Penny&#8217;s. Social Security is mostly not broken and the part that kinda is (DI) is fixable. And we have (or will shortly) numbers to prove it.</p>

<p>2009 Report Table IV.B7<br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SgrWTi5Wt3I/AAAAAAAAANc/qWn7RTNAMg8/s1600-h/2009+Table+IV.B7.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SgrWTi5Wt3I/AAAAAAAAANc/qWn7RTNAMg8/s400/2009+Table+IV.B7.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />There are some prominent commentators on Social Security who insist that its future Unfunded Liabilities are in large part the result of over-generosity to past participants, and particularly those who drew benefits from the program in the early years without fully contributing. And who when asked for proof point to Table IV.B7. And yes I do have Jim Glass among others in mind. To see why this is nonsense you can start by comparing the same table from three different years.</p>
<p>A typical retiree in 1980 would have been born in 1915 and entered working life by 1936 and so have been subject to payroll tax for his entire working life. He would also be 93 or 94 this year meaning that he and his predessors drawing benefits back from 1940 are overwhelmingly likely to be in what Social Security calls &#8216;past participants&#8217; or as we say &#8216;dead&#8217;. Meaning that whatever benefits they drew are now fixed in stone, nothing that can happen between 2008 and 2009 can possibly change that amount. Now we know that in actual dollars all benefits paid out until 1980 totalled $999.6 billion. Now you can play around and try to express that in 2009 dollars but what you can&#8217;t do is make the consequent value vary much, it is what it is.</p>
<p>In 2007 the Present Value of Unfunded Obligations for Past and Current Participants was $14.5 trillion<br />In 2008 the Present Value of Unfunded Obligations for Past and Current Participants was $15.2 trillion<br />In 2009 the Present Value of Unfunded Obligations for Past and Current Participants was $16.3 trillion</p>
<p>Why does this value grow so much from year to year? Well it is not because the Greatest Generation is magically padding their already collected retirement by close to a $trillion per year, Past Participants share NO part in the blame here. Instead the biggest culprit is inflation, with the 2009 Report 2008 and its costs are in the past and 2083 and its costs are added to the outlook. But other factors enter in as well as can be seen in Table II.D2 from this year&#8217;s Report.<br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SgrdlBkf5UI/AAAAAAAAAN0/nONzgoFIOFc/s1600-h/2009+Table+II.D2.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SgrdlBkf5UI/AAAAAAAAAN0/nONzgoFIOFc/s400/2009+Table+II.D2.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />Unfunded Liability moves in response to changes in assumptions about events in the FUTURE, it has NOTHING to do with benefits collected in the PAST. You can&#8217;t change mortality assumptions for people who are already dead. When we see that of the total -0.30% deterioration that -0.05 was the result of change of valuation period (swapping 2008 for 2083) and -0.11% was for changes in mortality and fertility assumptions while -0.15% was for changes in economic data (i.e. the current recession) it is clear that none of this has to do with some mythical overpayment to the Greatest Generation. I don&#8217;t know exactly why even people are smart as Orszag have fallen into this &#8216;legacy debt&#8217; concept, but certainly explanations about how this works numerically have not been convincing to date.</p>
