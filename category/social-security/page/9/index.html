                                <p>{Crossposted from dKos Social Security Defenders Group}</p>
<p>Social Security has been off the radar this week for obvious reasons, progressives being more focused on efforts of Republicans to win the War on Women via the Continuing Resolution. Plus while Paul Ryan&#8217;s original Roadmap proposed privatization of Social Security his Budget proposal for next year left it mostly aside (except for an obscure &#8216;trigger&#8217; mechanism for future cuts) in favor of a trillion dollar assault on Medicaid and a proposal to voucherize Medicare. Which only leaves one current assault vehicle, the pending bill to raise the Debt Limit which under current estimates needs to happen by mid May, and sure enough there are rumblings to this effect, no changes to Social Security, no votes to raise the Debt Limit from the Republicans.</p>
<p>So this seems an opportune time to explain the actual relation between Social Security and Public Debt and the paradoxical effects on debt from cuts to future benefits. Because all else held even all this does is increase real debt over the medium term (25 years) while reducing purely theoretical debt over the God help us Infinite Future Horizon. Conceptual unpacking in Extended.<a name="more"></a>As usual a good starting point for the serious student is the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2012/assets/concepts.pdf">Budget Concepts and Budge Process</a> (pdf) section of the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/Analytical_Perspectives">Analytical Perspectives of the Budget</a> (html index) released each year by OMB to illustrate the President&#8217;s budget both conceptually and historically.</p>
<p>But even beofre citing definitions I would like to direct Kossacks (and any visitors-welcome!) to a very handy web tool maintained by Treasury called <a href="http://www.treasurydirect.gov/NP/BPDLogin?application=np">Debt to the Penny</a> which true to its name will give you total federal debt to the penny at the end of any specified business day or over date ranges. For example as of close of business Thursday total &#8216;Public Debt&#8217; was $14,264,245,526,311.58. This figure is the sum of &#8216;Debt Held by the Public&#8217; at $9,652,195,544,012.12 and &#8216;Intragovernmental Holdings&#8217; at $4,612,049,982,299.46 (&#8216;debt to the penny&#8217; meaning what it says).</p>
<p>Now &#8216;Intragovernmental Holdings&#8217; is what OMB calls &#8216;Debt held by Government accounts&#8217; which in turn &#8220;means the debt the Treasury Department owes to accounts within the Federal Government. Most of it results from the surpluses of the Social Security and other trust funds, which are required by law to be invested in Federal securities.&#8221; So the commonly expressed opinion that Social Security Trust Funds are not counted in that total $14 trillion of debt cited in the MSM is dead wrong, they constitute $2.6 tn of that $4.6 tn of &#8216;Intragovernmental Holdings&#8217; or 18% of the total $14.3 tn in Public Debt. In fact Social Security is by far the biggest creditor the U.S. has, with Treasury holdings double those of the Fed and two and a half times that of our largest foreign lender the Chinese.</p>
<p>&#8216;Public Debt&#8217; is not precisely the same as &#8216;Debt Subject to the Limit&#8217; but for all practical purposes it is the same $14 tn plus, for those interested Treasury supplies the following in their FAQ<br />
<blockquote>What&#8217;s the difference between the Public Debt Outstanding and the Public Debt Subject to Limit?</p>
<p>The Public Debt Outstanding represents the face amount or principal amount of marketable and non-marketable securities currently outstanding. The Public Debt Subject to Limit is the maximum amount of money the Government is allowed to borrow without receiving additional authority from Congress. Furthermore, the Public Debt Subject to Limit is the Public Debt Outstanding adjusted for Unamortized Discount on Treasury Bills and Zero Coupon Treasury Bonds, Miscellaneous debt (very old debt), Debt held by the Federal Financing Bank and Guaranteed Debt</p></blockquote>
<p>.<br />With the conceptual background set, lets see how Social Security Trust Fund Operations interact with the Debt Limit.</p>
<p>And the answer is simple, though a little counter-intuitive. If Trust Fund principal balances go up in any given year due to a surplus of income over cost adding new offsetting Special Treasuries then so does &#8216;Intragovernmental Holdings&#8217; and so in turn &#8216;Public Debt&#8217;. On the other hand if in any year total cost exceeds total income including interest,  the flow of offsetting Special Treasuries is reversed, then Trust Fund principal goes down and in turn so does Public Debt. In between those two outcomes is a series of years where income EXCLUDING interest trails cost, but the accruing interest covers the gap, in which case the rate of principal increase is slowed and so the rate of growth of total Public Debt due to increased amounts of Intragovernmental Holdings.</p>
<p>Put all of that together and what do you get? Short term cuts in Social Security benefits absent any changes in revenue INCREASE the rate of principal accumulations of Intragovernmental Holdings and so ADD TO DEBT SUBJECT TO THE LIMIT. And the same is true for any benefit change starting before the projected date the Trust Funds hit their maximum, which right now is about $4.2 tn in 2023.</p>
<p>Which is why holding Social Security hostage to this year&#8217;s Debt Limit is simple bullshit. one has nothing to do with the other, and any attempts to start phasing in benefit changes via changes in the index (as B-S would starting in 2012) makes total Debt Subject to the Limit HIGHER and not lower. In fact far from giving our children and grandchildren a break it would absent other changes just time shift debt repayment forward in time while making the principal balances and hence ultimate payment amounts larger. It is all more Bait and Switch, just sophistry using ideas about seeming fiscal rectitude to screw over worker-retirees starting ten years out.</p>
<p>(But such a move would reduce &#8216;Unfunded Liabilities&#8217;, which opponents of SS wrongly equate to &#8216;Debt&#8217;. They aren&#8217;t but that will be the subject of a later post.)</p>

                                <p>op-ed by <strong>Dale Coberly</strong><br /><strong>Is It or Isn&#8217;t It</strong> <br />(And what is a &#8220;budget&#8221; anyway) </p>
<p>There have been a number of comments and counter-comments on the subject of the definition of &#8220;on budget.&#8221; </p>
<p>I may have contributed to this &#8220;debate&#8221; by referring to Social Security as &#8220;off budget.&#8221; I knew what I meant, and I thought I was using the words the way I had seen them used by &#8220;experts.&#8221; Then CoRev and MG found &#8220;definitions&#8221; that seemed to contradict my usage. It has seemed to me that these commenters didn&#8217;t really understand the definitions they were citing, but I think we both have been guilty of a kind of laziness and stubbornness that make it impossible to resolve the dispute. </p>
<p>I do not offer the following out of any claim to authority, but as an appeal to common sense. </p>
<p>(Dan here&#8230;Spirited debate warning&#8230;feint of heart need not enter. OTOH, stay on topic and try not to be repetitious.)<br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Words don&#8217;t &#8220;mean&#8221; anything. They point the way to shared ideas. Just as a picture of a horse is not a horse, nevertheless the picture can remind anyone who sees it of their own experiences with real horses, or movie horses, or story horses. Words are the same way, they point us to experiences we might, or might not, share with the person we are trying to communicate with. But sometimes the experiences are not so well shared as we thought. </p>
<p>There are two concepts here that need clarifying. &#8220;Social Security&#8221; and &#8220;budget.&#8221; </p>
<p>The first is the legal, historical, practical, and moral status of Social Security.<br />Even before looking at that, it needs to be understood that Congress can change the legal status of anything at any time. [Subject only to the Constitution. But the Supreme Court can change the Constitutional Status of anything at any time subject only to what it thinks the people will put up with before they lose faith that the law means anything at all &#8212; other than the whim of the current resident.] </p>
<p>We know that. We do not argue that Social Security IS, and always will be, X. We argue that it was created as X, has always operated as X, and we think it should continue to operate as X. X in this case is that Social Security is funded by a special tax dedicated to pay for the retirement and insurance benefits of the taxpayer himself according to a formula based on his own direct contributions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tax&#8221; is another word we need to be careful about: The SS tax is actually an insurance contribution. It is also a tax in that it is a non voluntary payment collected by a government, but it doesn&#8217;t act like a tax. It acts like an enforced savings &#8220;deposit,&#8221; which is dedicated to a fund which will be used to provide the taxpayer with essentially his own money (plus interest) back under certain well defined and all but certain conditions. Social Security taxes are legally separate from those taxes which are collected for the usual purposes of government, and they are accounted for separately. They may be LENT to the government, quite formally, with an obligation of the government to repay the loan with interest. But they are not &#8220;fungible&#8221; or so mixed with government funds that they lose their identity. They always carry a &#8220;tag&#8221; telling everyone where they came from and where they must return to. </p>
<p>&#8220;Budget&#8221; is the other term we need to clarify. We ought to have learned from ENRON and Arthur Anderson that accounting can be used to conceal facts as well as to provide an honest record of where money comes from, and how it is owed, and to whom. A budget is created by an entity for its own purposes and does not necessarily reflect a larger reality. Thus, if you are operating an agency of the government, and you have always been able to count on money borrowed from Social Security to pay for part of your activities, you might just enter that money on your books as revenue. And if you have no expectation, or responsibility, to repay it, you might leave it at that. </p>
<p>But if you do have a responsibility to repay it, and you don&#8217;t properly account for that, a time will come when you are &#8216;surprised&#8217; to learn that there is a call on the money you have spent and you are unprepared to repay. There may be an honest reason to keep books this way, or prepare a &#8220;budget&#8221; this way, but unless your purpose is dishonest&#8230; you wish to deceive or confuse your creditors, or auditors, you really need to enter the borrowed money on your books as borrowed money. that is, as a debt that you owe. </p>
<p>This is the case with Social Security. The government knows and legally acts as if it owes TO Social Security the money it has borrowed FROM Social Security. Whether or not it always notes that on any given &#8220;budget&#8221; does not change the legal&#8230; and moral&#8230; obligation. </p>
<p>My own feeling is that the decision to keep Social Security debt &#8220;off the books,&#8221; and to write the various &#8220;briefs&#8221; that we have seen quoted by CoRev and MG was a decision made more for the purpose of confusing the public&#8230; and the press&#8230; than for any good or honest reason&#8230; even that of convenience. </p>
<p>Sometimes they give themselves away, as when the author of a certain CBO &#8220;brief&#8221; attempted to convince us that Social Security was no different from any other tax because the money went into the Treasury just like other taxes. This would be like a bank telling you that your money was no different from Joe Smith&#8217;s because the same Teller took it in&#8230; and therefore the Bank can give it to Joe Smith if it wants, instead of to you.</p>
<p>Honest people can resolve these semantic confusions in a few minutes. When it&#8217;s harder than that you can suspect that at least one of the parties is not being honest. Try to look behind the word at the reality it is pointing at.</p>

                                <p>In order to make this timely I am cut and pasting a note from CEPR pointing to the efficacy of cutting spending in the Social Security through means testing.  The MSM and politicians have proposed this and raising the retirement age as answers to &#8216;the deficit&#8217; crisis, some commenters indicating a &#8216;tipping point&#8217; of disaster soon to come and saying Social Security needs to be a focus of this move to prevent disaster.</p>
<p>Such answers can be examined one by one in this particular forum since luckily the format can offer respite from the political power plays of the moment and posturing from &#8216;friend and foe&#8217; alike.  Since means testing is in the media, let&#8217;s look at the numbers.  Please read the 14 page document first, and then come back with comments.  I apologize for not commenting in particular on the topic but cannot today.</p>
<blockquote><p>Means testing, or reducing Social Security payments to affluent beneficiaries, has been touted as an effective way to reduce the cost of the program. A new report from the <a href="http://salsa.democracyinaction.org/dia/track.jsp?v=2&#038;c=nvTz3lUs%2FuMeXQcr93C%2B%2FKgHg0QIt0ep"><u>Center for Economic and Policy Research</u></a> (CEPR) examines the feasibility of several different means testing scenarios and finds the potential savings to be rather limited.
<p>“The majority of Social Security beneficiaries are lower- to middle- income people,” said <a href="http://salsa.democracyinaction.org/dia/track.jsp?v=2&#038;c=j4E2XVPaUKAo6H6aXlpxWqgHg0QIt0ep"><u>Dean Baker</u></a>, an author of the paper and a co-director at CEPR. “The number of beneficiaries who are by most standards considered affluent is too small to raise a significant amount of money via means testing.”</p>
<p>The report, “<a href="http://salsa.democracyinaction.org/dia/track.jsp?v=2&#038;c=4Dx9PX2Ta1EyOZQL9bYVcTCOyIZMetHM"><u>The Potential Savings to Social Security from Means Testing</u></a>,” first describes the distribution of Social Security benefits by income level. <a name="more"></a> The authors then look at the effects of phasing out benefits at rates of 10 and 20 percent of every dollar of non-Social Security income above $40,000 or $100,000 and find little in the way of potential savings to Social Security. The savings are even less when behavioral responses in the form of tax avoidance or tax evasion are factored in, since a means test would effectively be an increase in the marginal tax rate for wealthier seniors.    </p>
<p>The data show that over 75 percent of social security benefits go to individuals with non-Social Security income of less than $20,000 and 90 percent goes to those with non-Social Security income of less than $40,000 a year as of 2009. If means testing that phased out benefits at 10 percent were applied to those who make $100,000 a year and assuming no change in behavior, it would only save Social Security 0.74 percent of its outlays. At a 20 percent rate, this would only yield savings equal to1.33 percent of costs. If the phase out were dropped down to $40,000, hardly wealthy by any standard, the overall savings would just be 2.77 percent of costs at the 10 percent rate and only 4.65 percent of costs at the 20 percent rate. Accounting for behavioral responses would lead to even smaller savings, could cut these potential savings by half or more.   </p>
<p>Mean testing would also raise the cost of the program. The retirement program currently has very low costs. If the administrative expenses rose to the level of the disability portion of the Social Security program, the higher costs would likely exceed any savings from a means test.</p>
<p>On net, a means test would appear to be a dubious way to reduce the cost of Social Security.</p>

<div>More people need to <a href="http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/rss/media/2011/02/16/20110216_sanders.mp3">hear this</a> perspective regarding the economy and the budget debate if only to remind them that there is another perspective&#8230;if only to hear what it sounds like when a congress person is actually fighting and working for you. You, the one without enough money to influence congress. </div>
<div></div>
<div>From <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/politics/jan-june11/berniesanders_02-16.html?print#">the transcript</a>: </div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><div>JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, the president has talked about corporate &#8212; corporate tax reform. And he said, in two years, in &#8212; for 2012, he&#8217;s going to propose letting all those tax cuts expire that were allowed to continue in December.</div>
<div></div>
<div>You spent, what, eight-and-a-half-hours on the floor of the Senate in December in a &#8212; in a protest against that. <strong>Are you confident the president is going to let the tax cuts expire?</strong></div>
<div></div>
<div>SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: <strong>No, of course I&#8217;m not.</strong> I mean, that&#8217;s what the president said when he ran for president. And yet, when the Republicans stood up to him and said, we want to give more tax breaks, extend the Bush tax breaks, essentially, the president gave in.</div>
<div></div>
<div>When the Republicans said that, we want to lower the estate tax, Judy, which appeals &#8212; which only applies to the top three-tenths of 1 percent &#8212; these are not rich folks &#8212; these the very richest people in America &#8212; the president gave into that.</div>
<div></div>
<div>So, the president may tell us that he has this in mind, but I think the record is that he has not fought for those principles. The American people want him to fight for those principles.</div>
<div></div>
<div>And I think what this whole budget debate is about is do we stand up and say, no, we&#8217;re not going to cut programs for those who need it?</div>
<div></div>
<div>The other issue that I think we have to talk about is, in the president&#8217;s budget, he talks about Social Security. And he makes me a little bit nervous, because I think, as many of our listeners know, the Social Security trust fund today has a $2.6 trillion surplus.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Social Security can pay out every benefit owed to every eligible American for the next 27 years. Social Security, because it is funded by the payroll tax, hasn&#8217;t contributed one nickel to the deficit.</div>
</blockquote>
<div>See, there is another voice, and <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/view/2011/02/18-2">some are finally experiencing</a> the results of ignoring it. Remember this! Remember what a congress person sounds like when they are for real about working and fight for you. No more excuses you did not know. This is what <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUBKcO27ZfY">you will sound like</a> once you decide to influence congress.</div>

<p>Liberal attacks on Social Security are the unkindest cut of all.
<p>The Center for American Progress’s Matt Miller has <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/09/AR2011020903118_Comments.html">argued</a> that liberals can learn a valuable lesson from NY Governor Andrew Cuomo’s proposed budget. With his state facing a fiscal crisis, the Governor has proposed to cap growth of state spending on the Medicaid program. Miller has argued that we should follow his example and apply a similar cap to Social Security spending.</p>
<p>Briefly, New York’s Medicaid spending was slated to grow by 13%, much faster than the overall inflation rate. Governor Cuomo has proposed to ignore funding formulas and to limit growth to 6%. Miller wants liberals to follow that example by changing Social Security’s formula used to adjust benefits.</p>
<p> <a name="more"></a>
<p>Miller rightly notices that Social Security expenditures are also projected to grow faster than inflation. Of course, some of that is due to our aging society, with more retirees to support. But funding formulas for Social Security also contribute to growth of individual benefits beyond cost of living adjustments. In other words, Social Security expenditures in real terms (after inflation) increase faster than growth of the retired population, meaning that the benefits received in the future by a retiree will be higher in real terms than they are today.</p>
<p>Here’s why. In the 1970s it was recognized that if real living standards rise over time (due to growing productivity of workers), then Social Security retirement benefits would fall behind even if they are adjusted for inflation. Suppose you retired today at age 65 and were fortunate enough to live another 25 years to the ripe old age of 90. Let us say you retire at the typical benefit of $18,000 paid to one who has earned a medium wage pre-retirement. If that benefit is adjusted every year to account for inflation, when you die in 2036 you will still be able to buy the same consumer basket in your last year of life (assuming the COLA adjustments accurately reflect inflation — something that is not really true). But over that 25-year period you will watch as the average American living standard rises relative to your own. You will become relatively impoverished.</p>
<p>Over a period that long, it is likely that living standards will have increased substantially; over the course of US history they have typically doubled each generation. You will have fallen far behind in relative terms — from a not-so-comfortable living standard ($18,000 is by no means extravagant today) to a living standard that is half as good in relative terms.</p>
<p>For comparison purposes, based on current formulas, your Social Security retirement is projected to grow in real terms from that $18,000 now to $24,000 in 2030 and to $29,000 in 2050 (should you be so lucky to live to the age of 104!). Your living standard will grow by 60% as it keeps pace with the growth of American workers’ living standards. In relative terms, you do not fall behind. If everyone else is driving flying saucers to Venetian vacations, you’ll be able to do the same.</p>

<p>There are of course two objections. First, we do not know how much living standards will rise. It will depend on growth of labor productivity. But by linking growth of Social Security benefits to real wage growth we are ensuring that no matter how much productivity grows (whether it is zero or 400 percent), seniors will get their share.</p>
<p>Second, one could argue that in absolute terms, seniors are no worse off if we limit benefit growth to cover inflation. They’ll probably still live better in America than they would in India, after all.</p>
<p>But one thing we do know is that well-being depends more on relative comparisons than on absolute terms. Relative poverty is more detrimental to one’s physical, psychological, and emotional health than is absolute poverty. At first that might sound counterintuitive, but researchers from many disciplines have consistently found this to be true. It is relative poverty that isolates an individual, that reduces her ability to participate fully in society. So while it is commonplace to note that America’s poor are rich by Indian standards, that comparison is irrelevant.</p>
<p>Miller’s justification for elimination of the real living standard adjustment is based on two fallacies.</p>
<p>First, he argues that financing growth of Social Security benefits will “crowd out” all the other liberal priorities. The federal government simply will not be able to “afford” the costs of “guaranteeing great teachers for poor children, universal preschool, repairs for America’s crumbling roads and sewer” if we let living standards of seniors rise.</p>
<p>Second, he refers to growing numbers of retired baby boomers as the cause of the problem. It is a little publicized fact that when the intergenerational warriors trot out their “unfunded entitlements” that supposedly total tens of trillions of dollars, the shortfall is entirely due to the projected deficits in the long distant future after all baby boomers are dead and buried. The projected date of Armageddon, when Social Security first starts to run deficits (that is, when its total revenues fall short of its benefit payments) changes from year-to-year as assumptions change based on recent economic performance. But typically that date is sometime in the 2040s.</p>
<p>Think about it. The babyboomers will be closing in on the century mark by then. Yes, a few of them might make it. But most of us partied way too hard in the 1960s and 1970s. Heck, we were surprised to make it to the 1980s.</p>
<p>I do not have the space to go through all the reasons why the very long-term (75 years and beyond) projections of Social Security’s finances show growing budget deficits — but it mostly comes down to implausibly pessimistic and inconsistent assumptions about economic variables. In any case, it turns out that the projected financial shortfall amounts to about 2% of GDP per year after 2040 or so. In other words, if we find a way to shift 2% more of GDP annually toward Social Security’s funding over the next 30 years, the “looming financial crisis” disappears. By the way, we achieved a greater shift than that between 1960 and the 1990s. Only an ideologue could trump that up to a crisis.</p>
<p>But forget the finances. What really matters is growth of our nation’s ability to take care of the young, the workers, and the aged. Will we be able to produce enough goods and services to provide a rising living standard to all (supplemented by imports — if the rest of the world continues to prefer to “consume” green paper money over their own output, a topic for another day)? On all plausible projections the answer is a resounding “yes”. Indeed, even the pessimistic projections made by the Social Security Trustees shows rising living standards for all even as we age as a society.</p>
<p>That makes sense. The average worker in 1965 supported more dependents (young plus old) than workers are ever projected to support again. Why is that? Elementary: the parents of baby boomers supported 3.7 kids; the flip side of an aging society is that workers today and into the future are supporting more old people but fewer kids. It’s a tradeoff. We may not like it, but the alternatives are unpleasant: euthanasia for the elderly or very much higher birthrates. Far better to accept the aging society and to continue to ramp up productivity so that we can provide for them.</p>
<p>Indeed, it is precisely that productivity growth that drives the growth of real benefits that Miller wants to cut! If we don’t get rising productivity, we don’t get rising real benefits. Miller is focused on something that is not an issue, and has created a “solution” for something that is not a problem.</p>

<blockquote>WaPO: WHAT CRISIS?: It Ain&#8217;t Broke, So No Need To Fix It<br />Sunday, January 23, 2005; Page B02 By Mark Weisbrot and Dean Baker,</p>
<p>The latest Social Security trustees&#8217; report, whose numbers even the White House uses, predicts that the Social Security program can pay all promised benefits for the next 38 years &#8212; with no changes at all. The June 2004 estimate from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects that Social Security can pay all promised benefits without changes for even longer, until 2052. That&#8217;s nearly half a century.</p>
<p>And we are supposed to be worried about this? It brings to mind the image of Woody Allen as a nerdy young child in &#8220;Annie Hall,&#8221; becoming suddenly depressed because he has discovered that &#8220;the universe is expanding&#8221; and life on Earth is ultimately doomed.</p></blockquote>
<p> but before the doom Pie! And more from Mark and Dean under the fold.

<blockquote>Granted, 38 years is not an eternity. But even after 2042, the Social Security trustees say they will be able to pay an average benefit that is actually higher than what workers receive today &#8212; indefinitely. That&#8217;s in 2004 dollars &#8212; adjusted for inflation.</p>
<p>Social Security benefits are programmed to rise not only with price inflation, but also with wages. So Congress will at some point have to increase taxes or shave the benefits promised to future generations. But that&#8217;s no different from what&#8217;s been done before. In fact the projected shortfall for the next 75 years is smaller than shortfalls covered by adjustments in each of the following decades: the 1950s, &#8217;60s, &#8217;70s, and &#8217;80s. It is also about one-third the size of the tax cuts enacted during the Bush administration.</p>
<p>In other words, it&#8217;s a non-issue. Or should be. Yet most Americans seem terribly confused about the basic facts. During the third presidential debate last fall, moderator Bob Schieffer of CBS told the candidates that Social Security was &#8220;running out of money.&#8221; Neither candidate corrected him, and the press did not note the error.</p>
<p>Here are some of the obfuscations and accounting tricks &#8212; or misunderstandings &#8212; that have created false impressions about Social Security&#8217;s finances:</p>
<p>The disappearing trust fund: Some people say that Social Security will run into trouble in 2018. But this is like saying that Bill Gates will be strapped if he works only part time. He will still have $40 billion in assets, enough to keep him living well for a long time.</p>
<p>Similarly, the Social Security trust fund will have more than $3.7 trillion in today&#8217;s dollars in 2018. Combined with payroll tax revenues, that is enough to cover promised benefits until 2042, the trustees&#8217; report says.</p>
<p>&#8220;That money&#8217;s all been spent&#8221;: When anyone lends money to the federal government by buying a bond, the government spends it. But the government still pays interest and repays what it borrowed. That goes for the Social Security trust fund. Social Security has been running annual surpluses (now at more than $150 billion) since 1983. By law it must invest that surplus in U.S. Treasury obligations.</p>
<p>&#8220;But the trust fund is only holding I.O.U.&#8217;s &#8212; just pieces of paper!&#8221; Another canard: All bonds are I.O.U.&#8217;s. Those &#8220;pieces of paper&#8221; are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, which has never, ever defaulted on its bonds.</p>
<p>&#8220;The baby boomers&#8217; retirement will bankrupt Social Security.&#8221; Far from it. The first boomers actually begin retiring in 2008. Most of them will be dead before Social Security faces any financial difficulties.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are currently 3.3 workers paying into Social Security for every beneficiary; by 2035, there will be only 2.1.&#8221; True enough, but deceptive and not scary as it sounds. Productivity (output per hour) will grow substantially during the same period, so we won&#8217;t need nearly as many working people to support a larger retired population.</p>
<p>&#8220;If nothing is done, Social Security and Medicare will eat up 90 percent of our federal budget by 2050.&#8221; The trick here is throwing in Medicare, a separate program. The projected costs of Medicare are indeed out of control &#8212; a result of spiraling health care costs. This makes a strong case for health care reform, but that has nothing to do with Social Security.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that Social Security is more financially sound today than it has been throughout most of its 69-year history, according to Social Security trustees&#8217; numbers. If workers in 2050, who will be earning on average 68 percent more in real, inflation-adjusted dollars than they are today, have to pay 1 or 2 percent more of their income in taxes &#8212; as they have in the past &#8212; they won&#8217;t be able to complain much. They will still enjoy higher living standards than we do today. And Social Security will provide much larger real annual benefits for longer retirements when their turn comes.</p>
<p>The impending crisis of Social Security is a myth. Without it, however, Bush&#8217;s initiative to slash benefits and partially privatize the program wouldn&#8217;t have a prayer.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>by <strong>Dale Coberly</strong></p>
<p><strong>Eyes on the Prize <br />A Social Security summary.</strong>  </p>
<p>We have had twenty years and a billion dollars spent by Pete Peterson and friends telling the people that Social Security is going broke and will create huge deficits that will kill the economy and be a crushing burden to the young. Peterson has funded an army of &#8220;non partisan experts&#8221; who tell the media what to say and what not to say about Social Security. </p>
<p>On the other side we have had Bruce Webb&#8230; who does all the hard work&#8230; showing that the reports of Social Security going broke are based on assumptions that seem unlikely. Moreover he has shown that each year since we have been treated to the &#8220;we must fix (cut) Social Security NOW&#8221; , &#8220;doing nothing now&#8221; has actually reduced the cost of any ultimate fix. </p>
<p>We have had professer Rosser show that even under the pessimistic assumptions Social Security with no changes at all will still be able to pay a benefit that is larger in real value than what retirees get today. <br /><a name="more"></a> <br />And we have had Coberly show that even under the Trustees projections&#8230; the ones that produce the &#8220;Five Trillion Dollar Unfunded Deficit!&#8221; (or Fifteen Trillion if you want to add up the cost out to &#8220;the infinite horizon&#8221;), the actual cost to each worker would be a raise of less than a dollar per week from time to time over the next seventy five years, and then no further increases after that. </p>
<p>And we should not forget that CBO has published an &#8220;option number three&#8221; that shows the cost of one way of fixing Social Security would be a payroll tax increase of one half of one tenth of one percent per year. One half of one tenth of one percent of an average worker&#8217;s pay today is forty cents per week, and the boss pays half of that. </p>
<p>Then, we have the good people who want to &#8220;fix Social Security&#8221; by taxing the rich&#8230; either by raising the cap, or by dedicating the estate tax to pay for Social Security. These people do not know, or do not understand that this is exactly what FDR was careful NOT to do. He did not want Social Security to be &#8220;the dole&#8221; &#8220;so that no damn politician can take it away from them.&#8221; </p>
<p>And we have the really bad people who want to fix Social Security by raising the retirement age. &#8220;It&#8217;s the obvious solution,&#8221; they say. &#8221; After all, we are going to be living longer.&#8221; It never troubles them that if people can pay for their own retirement (with an extra forty cents per week per year) they may not want to work longer, or they may have other age related conditions that will not reduce their life expectancy but may make working painful. But people with jobs they like can&#8217;t imagine why working people might want to stop working for the boss and have a few years of freedom before they die. </p>
<p>And we have the strange people who tell us that paying BACK the money that Congress borrowed FROM Social Security&#8230; that is from the workers&#8217; savings&#8230; will cause the country to collapse: we need to stiff the workers so the bankers can keep their million dollar bonuses for the excellent way they have been managing the economy. </p>
<p>And we have recently had the President and Congress, who decided that since we are facing a &#8220;looming deficit&#8221; the smart thing to do was to cut taxes. This way they have given you your retirement money to spend now, because they know an extra ten dollars a week spent at Wal Mart will mean more to you than an extra year of retirement. </p>
<p>And we have the eternal obfuscators who will come into any discussion and do everything they can to distract your attention from the basic fact: </p>
<p>Social Security is YOUR money. It doesn&#8217;t cost &#8220;the government&#8221; a dime. Social Security is the ONLY way most workers have to save their own money, safe from inflation and market losses, so they can retire at a reasonable age. And the cost of keeping this insurance is so small no one would even notice it, if it wasn&#8217;t for the Big Liars finding ways to make it seem like it was a huge number, or an &#8220;unfair&#8221; windfall to old people at the expense of the &#8220;young&#8221; who will never, of course, ever get old themselves. </p>
<p>I have done the math. So has CBO. The cost of keeping your Social Security insurance, just in case you do get old without getting rich, looks like about a forty cents per week increase in the payroll tax each year, while incomes are expected to go up about ten dollars per week each year. </p>
<p>Try to keep that in mind when the man in the suit is selling you snake oil.</p>

This is noteworthy given the apparent acceptance by politicos that Social Security needs fixing at all.  Here is part of the transcript:</p>
<p>MR. GREGORY:  Social Security, how does it have to change?  What they put on the agenda is raising the retirement age, maybe means testing benefits.  Is it time for Social Security to fundamentally change if you&#8217;re going to deal with the debt problem?</p>
<p>SEN. REID:  One of the things that always troubles me is, when we start talking about the debt, the first thing people do is run to Social Security. Social Security is a program that works, and it&#8217;s going to be&#8211;it&#8217;s fully funded for the next 40 years.  Stop picking on Social Security.  There are a lot places we can go to&#8230;</p>
<p>MR. GREGORY:  Senator, you&#8217;re really saying the arithmetic on Social Security works?</p>
<p>SEN. REID:  I&#8217;m saying the arithmetic on Social Security works.  I have no doubt it does.  For the next&#8230;</p>
<p>MR. GREGORY:  It&#8217;s not in crisis?</p>
<p>SEN. REID:  No, it&#8217;s not in crisis.  This is, this is, this is something that&#8217;s perpetuated by people who don&#8217;t like government.  Social Security is fine.  Are there things we can do to improve Social Security?  Of course.  But don&#8217;t, don&#8217;t&#8230;</p>
<p>MR. GREGORY:  Means testing?  Raising the retirement age?</p>
<p>SEN. REID:  &#8230;don&#8217;t&#8211;I&#8217;m&#8230;</p>
<p>MR. GREGORY:  Do you agree with either of those?</p>
<p>SEN. REID:  I&#8217;m not going to go to any of those back-door methods to whack Social Security recipients.  I&#8217;m not going to do that.  We have a lot of things we can do with this debt that&#8217;s a problem.  But one of the places where I&#8217;m not going to be part of picking on is Social Security.<br />&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>

                                <p>for the longest time the earliest Annual Report of the Social Security Trustees readily available was that of the second Report in 1942 and that only in a fairly clumsy PDF format that doesn&#8217;t allow my browser to cut and paste (though I can from most PDFs). But the fine people (no snark) at ssa.gov/history made the 1941 Report available recently in HTML. And in the course of that dispel some myths about the origins of the Trust Fund which contrary to a certain strain of opinion was not a product of the 1983 legislation. Follow the link in the title or check out the excerpts under the fold. All from the actual text of the Report transmittal to Congress.</p>

<blockquote>The Federal old-age and survivors insurance trust fund was created pursuant to section 201 of the Social Security Act Amendments of 1939, approved August 10, 1939. This trust fund became effective on January 1, 1940, and superseded the old-age reserve account established under the Social Security Act of 1935. The trust fund is held by a Board of Trustees composed of the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Labor, and the Chairman of the Social Security Board, all ex officio. The trust fund so held is available for the payment of old-age annuities and survivors insurance benefits and the necessary expenditures incurred by the Social Security Board and the Treasury Department in the administration of the program. The Secretary of the Treasury is designated as the Managing Trustee.</p>
<p>Resources made available to the trust fund included the securities held by the Secretary of the Treasury for the old-age reserve account, accounts standing to the credit of the old-age reserve account on the books of the Treasury as of January 1, 1940, and interest on the investments. The appropriation to the trust fund for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1941, and for each fiscal year thereafter, are required by section 201 of the Social Security Act, as amended, to be equivalent to 100 percent of the taxes (including interest, penalties, and additions to taxes) received under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act and covered into the Treasury. Interest on and proceeds from the sale or redemption of any securities held by the trust fund are required to be credited to the fund.</p></blockquote>
<p>i.e. receipts from FICA and any interest on the Trust Funds are not fungeable, they are required to be credited to the Trust Fund. </p>
<blockquote><p>The old-age and survivors insurance trust fund provides a financial margin of safety for the system against the first impacts of unforeseen changes in the upward trend of disbursements as well as against these short-term fluctuations and contingencies. At the end of June 1940 approximately 50 million persons already held social security account numbers and about 42 million workers had made contributions toward benefits under the system. In the future, millions of additional workers will come under the program as they obtain jobs in covered employments. Most of the rights now being accumulated toward benefits by these contributors and insured workers will not mature for many years. Consequently, benefits under the program are expected to increase markedly over a long period. This results from the fact that larger numbers of workers will be eligible and will qualify for benefits and from the expectation that the proportion of the population in ages 65 and over, estimated at 7 per-cent in 1940, may eventually rise to perhaps 14 to 16 percent. Hence the essential assurance of future financial soundness of the system, with its rising rate of disbursement, rests on a graduated increase in contribution rates or provision of income from other sources, or both.</p></blockquote>
<p>It is a reserve fund. And increases in contribution rates were anticipated right from the beginning, the common belief that FDR promised that rates would never go up being simple after the fact bullshit. And the growth in beneficiary population over time equally anticipated.</p>
<blockquote><p>During the period January 1 to June 30, 1940, new investments amounting to $324.9 million were made for the fund and securities amounting to $22.0 million were redeemed as required to meet current withdrawals for benefit payments and administrative expenses. The new investments were in the form of special old-age and survivors insurance trust fund notes bearing 2.5 percent interest. As a result of these transactions the average interest rate on investments of the trust fund was 2.91 percent on June 30, 1940.</p>
<p>The assets of the old-age and survivors insurance trust fund as of June 30, 1940, were $1,744.7 million.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Trust Fund has ALWAYS been invested in Special Treasuries designated for that purpose.</p>

<p>Well the first line of attack is opening up. Lindsay Graham is threatening to hold up the Debt Limit Increase Bill, and so potentially throw this whole country and perhaps the world into default unless he gets cuts to Social Security.</p>
<p>This is insane on several levels, not least because the two things have nothing to do with each other to start with. To understand this we have to back off and examine four different categories of debt: Public Debt, Debt Held by the Public, Intragovernmental Holdings, and Debt Subject to the Limit. Total Public Debt and Debt Subject to the Limit are essentially the same dollar figures (an explanation of the difference here: <a target='_blank"' href="http://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/resources/faq/faq_publicdebt.htm#LimitDifferences">Limit Difference</a>), so when you compare the dollar total for the former from this link with the current limit as reported in the papers you can see how close we are: <a href="http://www.treasurydirect.gov/NP/BPDLogin?application=np">Debt to the Penny</a>. So yes something needs to be done, but how does Social Security fit in?</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t. As you can see &#8216;Public Debt&#8217; is the sum of &#8216;Debt Held by the Public&#8217; and &#8216;Intragovernmental Holdings&#8217; which latter includes the current $2.6 trillion Social Security Trust Funds. But cutting Social Security benefits in the short to medium term just makes Public Debt GO UP (or at under some formulations stay even).</p>
<p>If Social Security on a combined basis (OASDI) or for either component (OAS or DI) takes in more in taxes than it spends those surplus dollars plus interest on the existing Trust Fund get credited to the Funds in the forms of Special Treasuries. But those assets, though real as any other bond, also respesent obligations and so add to Debt Subject to the Limit. Meaning that any action that reduces the flow out in the form of benefit cuts/retirement age or increase the flow in via cap increases simply add to the bottom line and so make the country reach the Debt Limit FASTER. Now some big name economists say this isn&#8217;t really true, that instead the net effect is a wash. Well okay, I don&#8217;t buy it thinking they have confused an textbook accounting identity for a real world operation, but either way cutting Social Security benefit cuts DOES NOT HELP IN ANY WAY WITH THE DEBT LIMIT.</p>
<p>It is not clear whether Lindsay Graham understands that he is simply holding the world&#8217;s economy and the retirement benefits of millions of people in the future hostage to a simple hatred of the New Deal. But no one else should be fooled, cuts to Social Security and particularly phased in cuts in future decades have nothing to do with U.S. actual debt obligations in Spring 2010. It is pure blackmail.</p>
