                                <p>(Still cross posted from dKos. But since coberly and I have an extended colloquy there maybe not a bad place to start)<br /><a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2011/09/18/1017929/-House-rich-:-Why-Social-Security-cant-be-Raided-(Part-1)?detail=hide&#038;via=blog_787430">Part 1 </a>was kind of a set-up in both senses of the word in that it didn&#8217;t really deliver on the post title. But I think a necessary set-up and so lets resume.</p>
<p>When we left off we had Social Security after having a long period of positive cash flow from 1936 to 1956 and so a lot of pre-funding, leveling off in terms of Trust Fund Ratio through the 60&#8217;s, only to go into some decline in the 70s. And if we return to <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/2011/VI_A_cyoper_hist.html#208231">Table VI.A2.— Operations of the OASI Trust Fund, Calendar Years 1937-2010</a> we can see a system that was by any measure you like very sick by 1981, and much sicker than today. Whereas the year end balance for OAS in 2010 still represented 4 full years of 2011 cost (TF Ratio of 400) the corresponding balance in 1981 was less than a fifth of a year (TF Ratio of 18). Action was imperative and the motivation was not Reagan&#8217;s desire to tap into worker pocketbooks to fund tax cuts, as far as the Trust Fund was concerned it was the farthest thing from a piggy bank. Which gets us to our second set-up point: the Myth of the Reagan Raid. Onward and lowward (i.e. below the fold).<br /><a name="more"></a><br /><a name="more"></a><br />The Trustees measure the health of the Trust Funds in terms of Actuarial Balance. A Trust Fund in annual balance ends the year with a TF Ratio of 100 or above. But the Trustees have a longer horizon than just the next year, instead they consider the Trust Funds to be in Short Term Actuarial Balance if they project to have TF Ratios of 100 or more in each of the next 10 years, while they are deemed in Long Term Actuarial Balance is they project to have those levels of TF Ratio in each of the next 75 years.</p>
<p>Now the vast majority of Trust Fund assets since inception of the program have been in Special Issues of Treasuries at times with an admixture of regular Treasuries (but at no point I am aware of ever representing more than a fraction of total assets). The restriction to Treasuries is a direct consequence of language in the 1939 Amendments to the Social Security Act of 1935 mandating that all funds credited to the Trust Fund and not needed for short term benefit payments has to be held in &#8220;instruments fully guaranteed as to interest and principal by the federal government&#8221;. Meaning it would take a change in the law to have them in any other asset class, and except for short term payment purposes even in cash. While some people see something nefarious in this practice it has served the system well over the years, for example large balances built up over the 40s and 50s were successfully used to bridge gaps between income and costs through the 60s and especially the 70s. The historical record shows that every obligation was honored down to the next to the last penny (and for DI starting again in 2005). Because in the eyes of the U.S. Treasury those Special Issues are just as good as cash, in fact they pay interest on them just as the Federal Reserve does on reserves deposited with it by member banks.</p>
<p>Which brings us to the first point here. There can be no &#8216;raid&#8217; of Social Security in any year that has a TF Ratio less than 100. Instead the federal government via the Trustees has a positive legal obligation to buy Treasuries to build up that ratio back to a minimum of 100. And if we look at Table A2 again we see that Reagan inherited a Trust Fund that has fallen out of actuarial balance in 1971 (TF Ratio of 94) and never recovered. Indeed without a temporary loan of $17.5 billion from DI to OAS in 1982 checks might have been delayed for the first time ever. But between the loan and the fix installed in 1983 during the process that included the Greenspan Commission, the Trust Fund began to recover. But only just. In fact by the end of Reagan&#8217;s second term the TF Ratio was only up to 41 or less than half the target, if anything the argument would run that Reagan should have taxed workers even MORE so that the Trustees could buy even MORE Treasuries. Instead the fix was deliberately phased in with a ten year time table with remarkable success with the TFs finally get back over 100 in the course of 1993. Which in respect to Social Security takes both Reagan and Bush 1 off the hook, when examined dispassionately all they did was restore the Trust Funds to its minimum required reserve. Now as it turns out that reserve was mandated by law to be in the form of Treasuries which by definition meant cash going to Treasury, that is what buying a bond does, you give the government money, they spend it on what they want and give you a promise in return. There is nothing &#8216;Phony&#8217; about that process, not at all. And certainly no &#8216;raid&#8217;, instead we have the Trustees fulfilling their mandate to restore actuarial balance with any cash flowing to the General Fund being a simple byproduct of that legal requirement.</p>
<p>Okay that settled, back to the topic of the posts. Over the course of the mid to late 90s the solvency of the Trust Fund continued to improve by every measure: TF Ratio, year end balance, and increase in assets. But even then this risks exaggeration of actual cash flow, instead you get that by netting out interest which came only in the form of Special Issues and so were not financed out of the outside economy. In fact in Clinton&#8217;s last year 2000 the actual cash flow was $74 billion out of total SS Surplus of $132 billion. And for the most part it never got better than that, though assets in the OAS Trust Fund grew from $931 billion in that year to $2.4 trillion today (in both cases excluding DI) a growing piece of that was simply interest credited to the Trust Fund.</p>
<p>And here is the key point. That interest is an obligation to the General Fund, it cannot by its nature be borrowed. It can and does score as income for both Trust Fund and overall Budget accounting, for those purposes it is considered as real as real. But it can&#8217;t be tapped for any other purpose even in theory, in the metaphor expressed in the post Title it is home equity and not cash, and in this case not subject to refinance to extract that cash, which in any case wouldn&#8217;t serve to increase net wealth as such.</p>
<p>No it is only actual cash flow above and beyond cost that is available for &#8216;raiding&#8217; in any sense and examination of our table shows that cash flow stabilized and then dropped sharply after 2008 to the point that even though OAS returned a total $92 billion surplus in 2010 this represented negative cash flow for that program alone of $16 billion. And OAS is by far the healthier of the two OASDI programs, comparable numbers show that DI went cash flow negative in 2005 and actually started cashing in its principal in 2008. This contrasts to OAS whose total Income including Interest exceeds Cost at a rate that will keep its total balance growing until 2023 with assets sufficient to bridge its cost gap until 2038. On the other hand DI&#8217;s income imbalance is such that it projects to get totally out of assets by 2017. (Combine those two and you get the 2036 date reported for THE Trust Fund.)</p>
<p>You can&#8217;t raid Interest and even though cash flow for OAS was projected to go back positive briefly in 2013 it was never projected to be that much, to run out by 2017 anyway, and at this point probably won&#8217;t show up at all.</p>
<p>The history of Trust Fund operations from 1936 to 1982 shows us clearly that Trust Fund Assets are exactly that, assets available to the Trust Fund. But only in years of positive cash flow are those assets ever tappable for other purposes, (for example setting up personal accounts alongside Social Security on which fees can be charged by Wall Street). And the days of strong cash flows are over. Not a crisis, this outcome was fully projected in the 90s, and on balance things turned out better than expected on net. In 1997 the date of Trust Fund Depletion on a combined basis was set to be 2029, we actually gained 7 years of projected solvency since. So there was nothing wrong with the planning, this is the way the Trust Funds were designed to operate. As noted earlier balances built up from 1936 to 1956 were tapped starting in 1957 to bridge the Income Excluding Interest and Cost gap until funds ran short in 1982. And we are just repeating that process today with balances built up from 1983 through now started being tapped by DI in 2005 and OAS in 2010. The difference being that we still have a TF Ratio of 400 in 2010 compared to the 22 TF Ratio of 1982. The Trust Funds are real, they are just no longer stealable. The dollars flows were such starting in 1996 that raiding to fund private accounts almost penciled out, but that window slammed shut by 2004. (The plans floated by Bush in 2005 having seriously cooked the books to make the numbers run, subject for another post.)</p>
<p>Social Security: house rich, cash poor, and unable to be burglarized. Not because the walls are so secure, though they are pretty good, there just isn&#8217;t anything inside the house that you can actually sell to a fence.</p>

                                <p>(cross posted from Daily Kos Social Security Defenders Group)<br />There are three prevalent myths about the assets in Social Security Trust Funds, plural because there are two of them OAS-Old/Age Survivors and DI-Disability Insurance. The first myth, which comes mostly from the Right, is that those assets are just &#8216;Phony IOUs&#8217;. The second myth comes mostly from the Left and is just a version of &#8216;Phony IOU&#8217;, that the assets of the Trust Fund were real but were raided starting with Ronald Reagan. I and others have dealt with these two before and I mention them only to dismiss them for now, though happy to discuss the ideas in comments.</p>
<p>The third myth, and the topic of this post is the idea that the Trust Fund assets were and are real and are just a big juicy target of Wall Street, that is that they have not been raided YET. Well this like the first two is based on a profound misunderstanding of the nature and operations of the Trust Funds since their inception. But to clear up, or even begin to, requires some tedious plodding through the numbers and concepts, but for those that do I hope you will understand with I used the descriptor and made the claim in the post Title. Oh and did I say there would be numbers? Continued below the fold.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />The Trustees of Social Security sign off on a Annual Report of Social Security each year. I say &#8216;sign off&#8217; because the Report is not fundamentally their work product, although their top staff review and modify the ultimate conclusions the bulk of the Report is produced by the professional demographers and actuaries of the Social Security Office of the Chief Actuary, heretofore the OACT. Most people and about 99% of all reporters who even make an effort know the Report in the form of the <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TRSUM/index.html">Summary</a>. And indeed if you go the <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/pubs.html">Actuarial Publications</a> webpage this publication is the second to be served up. But the first is the full <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/2011/index.html">Annual Report of the Trustees</a> which adds just under 200 pages of data tables and explanatory text. And it is in those data tables that you begin to unravel the nature of the Trust Funds. </p>
<p>And this is where things get a little tedious. But necessary. The main table under discussion is <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/2011/VI_A_cyoper_hist.html#208231">Table VI.A2.— Operations of the OASI Trust Fund, Calendar Years 1937-2010 </a> Note first that this Table does not include the DI Trust Fund, those numbers and ones for combined OASDI are available down the page in Tables VI.A3 &#038; A4. This exclusion is necessary because DI has some complications of its own.</p>
<p>On inspection you will see by year Trust Fund operations reported under three categories: Income, Cost, and Assets. Assets are reported in three forms: Increase in Assets which is the annual surplus or deficit used for budget calculations, Amount at End of Year which is the total TF balance, and Trust Fund Ratio which is that balance expressed as a percentage of the next year&#8217;s cost with 100=1 year, in turn the official target. Income and Cost are reported as Totals and then sub-totals with all sources of Income less all incidence of Cost making up the Increase in Assets.</p>
<p>Income to the Trust Funds come in 4 forms, only three significant (at least prior to this year), Those three are Contributions or FICA tax collections, Tax on Benefits, and Interest. FICA taxes and Tax on Benefits represent actual cash money extracted from the economy while Interest in most years just comes as a credit from Treasury to the Trust Funds. This distinction will become very important later.</p>
<p>Cost equally comes in three forms being Benefit Payments which make up the vast bulk of expenditures, Administrative Costs and RRB Exchange. RRB is Railroad Retirement, a parallel and older retirement system to Social Security and one with reciprocal funding with Exchange being the net transfer. As you can see from the numbers not that important in current context. Administration too is insignificant, in fact for OAS it represents only 0.6% of cost as compared to the overall Admin cost of 0.9% for combined OASDI, since DI is a more expensive component proportionately though not absolutely. One of those &#8216;complications&#8217; alluded to above.</p>
<p>To the meat of the matter (or the tofu or brown rice as your diet would have it). If we examine 2010 for Increase in Assets we see a figure for positive $92.2 billion which as noted is the OAS surplus for budget calculations. &#8220;But, but, but the WaPo told me Social Security was in deficit for the first time since 1983!&#8221; Well they did and there are two reasonably valid, though ultimately confusing reasons. One they are focusing on cash flow only and not total Income and two they are reporting combined OAS+DI.</p>
<p>As to cash flow as noted above in most years in this Table interest simply comes to Social Security in the form of a credit. Only in those years where Income excluding Interest fails to exceed Cost does some or all of it come in the form of cash transfers. And only in those years when Income INCLUDING Interest trails cost is there an actual decrease in TF balances or in other words a cashing in of principal in the form of Special Treasuries. But back to cash flow. Determining it for any given year is simple, just subtract Interest from Increase in Assets. A positive remainder means cash flow in, a negative one cash flow out. And if we perform the exercise we see positive cash flow every year from 1936 to 1956. But also might note that this didn&#8217;t equate to gains in Trust Fund Ratios as such, while through the 40s those ratios ranged between 15 and 27 years of reserves in terms of the next year&#8217;s cost by 1956 this was down to under 4 years, and interestingly by this measure the same position we are in today.</p>
<p>Which brings up a point in passing. People who claim that the current &#8216;pre-funding&#8217; is unprecedented need to look at those numbers from the 40s. Instead of the popular picture of the first two generations of retirees/workers being pure parasites we see people who sent positive cash flow to the system ever year for twenty years and significantly pre-funded their own retirements.</p>
<p>And that pre-funding was needed. An examination of the numbers from 1956 to 1982 shows 14 years in which total balances shrank as Increase in Assets went negative but also additional years when actual cash flow was negative as well, for example 1971-1974 where Increase in Assets minus Interest also yields negative numbers. Meaning that Social Security was cash flow negative every year from 1971 to 1982. Again making hash of the argument that negative cash flows, as seen this year on a combined OASDI basis, are unprecedented. And also the accompanying claim that Social Security has &#8216;always&#8217; been Pay-Go. Well not unless you count interest and not even then in all cases.</p>
<p>But this is getting long. So I stuck &#8216;Part 1&#8217; in the title and will post this piece now with Part 2 coming right up. And in the interim maybe those interested can run through the numbers in the data tables.</p>

                                <p>By: Daniel Becker </p>
<p>In answer to the generic question regarding President Obama&#8217;s actions regarding the debt ceiling, I am re-posting this from 2/25/09.  In comments of the original I stated that cutting the deficit by 1/2 seemed to &#8220;optimistic&#8221; for me.<br />***************************</p>
<p>Ok, here are my basic issues with the substance of President Obama&#8217;s speech. First, may I remind everyone<br />that as of 11/08 I declared my divorce successful.  Has it become my mission accomplish moment?</p>
<p>I heard this:<br />
<blockquote>“And we will expand our commitment to charter schools. but as a father when I say that responsibility for our children&#8217;s education must begin at home.” </p></blockquote>
<p>And thought: 2 tier education system/vouchers, no thank you.  Education begins at home when home means one parent has the time to spend at home oppose to both working.</p>
<p>I heard this:<br />
<blockquote>“And we must also begin a conversation on how to do the same for Social Security, while creating tax-free universal savings accounts for all Americans.”</p></blockquote>
<p>And thought: Are you freak&#8217;n kidding me!  In this time of financial collapse we&#8217;re still going to talk about turning an insurance for the masses against the follies of finance into some form to include finance?  The entire reason we want to create jobs is because we have suddenly realized that the vast, vast majority do not earn their money from money.  Tax free?  Has he not heard of 401K, IRA and all it&#8217;s versions, HSA, higher education accounts?  Italy?</p>
<p>I heard this:<br />
<blockquote>“Yesterday, I held a fiscal summit where I pledged to cut the deficit in half by the end of my first term in office.”</p></blockquote>
<p>And thought: Yeah, how&#8217;d that work for the last administration who made such a declaration?  Did he have to say “in half”?  Has his advisors not taught him about the blip during the FDR recovery?  Only one way I can think of doing this: Raise taxes where the money is and whack the defense budget in half and I mean take a swipe at all moneys related to security.  Are we really $1 trillion dollars worth of paranoid?</p>

                                <p>Op ed by <strong>Nancy Ortiz</strong></p>
<p>Scott Hochberg&#8217;s article <a target="_blank" href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/07/making-e-verify-mandatory-perfect-storm.html">Making E-Verify Mandatory: The Perfect Storm for Crippling the Social Security Administration and Jeopardizing the Social Safety Net</a> discusses issues regarding the e-Verify system and a move in Congress to make it mandatory for everyone hired for a job in the US. He points out that eVerify is every bit as much a threat to SS and Medicare as any of the other benefit, COLA, or Medicare provider cuts now being discussed. I read Hochberg&#8217;s article with great interest and have a few additional points to add to his excellent analysis of this subject.  </p>
<p>When the Immigration Reform Act took effect in 1987, I was the manager of the SS office in Northern Santa Barbara County in strawberry, broccoli, lettuce and wine grape country. Thousands of migrant workers pass through the area at the height of the picking season between January and May. Many stay with or without authorization so that about 60% of the population is Hispanic and/or non-English speaking/non-US national. You will find similar demographics up and down the California Central Coast in agricultural areas, so there&#8217;s nothing unusual about this.<br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;ll spare you the war stories of actually implementing IRCA&#8217;s social security number provisions. This was the Bush I administration notable for its parsimony in budgeting for SSA operations. (How bad was it? How about no hiring, no overtime and no photocopy paper bad?) Farm workers in the area lined up with their new Immigration work visas in hand outside our office door at 6:00A and we interviewed Social Security Number applicants until 5:00P every day from 1987 til mid-1989. It was hard to get anything else done, but the normal operation got busier because of the recession that put maybe 15% of the workforce in our area out of work.</p>
<p>Alright, now it won&#8217;t take much imagination to imagine the same situation but worse, because now every worker  would be subject to e-verify. Not just the &#8220;obvious illegals,&#8221; every single one who applied for a job. Hochberg&#8217;s article summarizes the projected workload from this but SSA&#8217;s workforce is now 20 or more years older <br />and really, really ready to retire. And, of course, Congress is talking about cutting the whole federal civil service workforce 10% across the board while maintaining an indefinite hiring freeze and whacking every agencies&#8217; budget in its 2 Trillion to 4 Trillion dollar spending cuts. The President is ready to agree to at least 2 Trillion in cuts, but discussions are continuing.</p>
<p>Perhaps you can see now why making it illegal to work in the US without lawful admission was a bad, terrible, awful, rotten, really bad idea from the git-go. &#8220;All we would have to do to&#8221; avoid this debacle is revoke this provision and we could go back to doing business the way we did before 1987. The punitive notion of making<br />work without documents a &#8220;crime&#8221; has resulted in a flood of counterfeit and stolen documents. Field workers often buy many sets of documents (at high prices) before getting a set that will pass employers&#8217; inspection. Every town in California and other border states has document mills.  Sanctions against employers for hiring undocumented workers are virtually never imposed. Identity theft, impossible to prevent and prosecute effectively, is epidemic. And, on and on. All because of the notion that working in the US should be a crime.</p>
<p>If you remain unconvinced, let me remind you that the budget for SSA&#8217;s New New Computer Center was reduced about in this last round of spending cuts. This will make it impossible to meet an early construction deadline made necessary by the fragility of the existing computer system. This is estimated to result in causing SSA&#8217;s now aged and outdated computer processing and data storage systems to collapse<br />sometime between now and 2013. 2013 is supposedly the outside range of functionality assuming nothing catastrophic (such as a major power grid black out) happens between now and then. Otherwise, it can go at any time. Finally, I don&#8217;t need to remind you of the pending DIB appeals workload of approx. 700K cases still on hand.</p>
<p>But, in closing let me ask you&#8211;can you prove you are a US citizen or lawfully admitted alien with permission to work if I ask you right this minute? No, your drivers&#8217; license isn&#8217;t enough. Your SS card isn&#8217;t ID.  You may have a US Passport but it won&#8217;t resolve the matter unless it is current. Your current or former employer&#8217;s assurance isn&#8217;t enough either.</p>
<p>Prove to me who you are or you can&#8217;t work here any more. And, it says here on this little No Match notice that you aren&#8217;t who you say you are. So, what about it? Exactly who are you anyway, Mr. Working American?</p>

                                <p>In addition to the controversy over the ARRP position on Social Security, there are other issues affecting retirement that surface via immigration legislation.  Scott Hochberg has given Angry Bear permission to post his article from this weekend from Huffington Post. (hat tip coberly)</p>
<p>Making E-Verify Mandatory: The Perfect Storm for Crippling the Social Security Administration and Jeopardizing the Social Safety Net by Scott Hochberg</p>
<p>There has been much recent buzzing about <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/18/us/18aarp.html?_r=2"><u>AARP&#8217;s ambiguous, half-denied statements</u></a> about their (new?) willingness to cut Social Security benefits, and rightly so. As the largest membership organization of seniors in the country, AARP&#8217;s tactical gamble could be an unfortunate game-changer in any deficit deal negotiated behind closed doors in Washington.</p>
<p>But believe it or not, one of the biggest threats to Social Security this summer could come from an entirely different direction, from an initiative whose main target is not even related to social program spending. <a name="more"></a>  I&#8217;m talking about <a href="http://www.nilc.org/immsemplymnt/ircaempverif/e-verify-facts-about-2011-02-15.pdf"><u>E-Verify</u></a>, a proposed system for curbing the legal employment of every single undocumented worker in America. While seemingly immigration-related, a mandatory E-Verify program could cripple the Social Security Administration (SSA) by concurrently draining already-limited funding while imposing heavy burdens on one of the most efficient government programs in existence. Oh yes, and it would threaten the timely distribution of all new Social Security benefits.</p>
<p>For those not familiar with it, E-Verify is a tool designed to prevent the employment of undocumented workers in the United States. Employers run the personal information of new hires though the E-Verify electronic system, which is connected to the SSA master database of Americans with Social Security numbers. In its developmental stages, the program has been optional for employers, but new legislation proposed by <a href="http://lamarsmith.house.gov/News/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=246547"><u>Rep. Lamar Smith</u></a> (R-TX) would make it mandatory. This would be dubious policy for a number of reasons, and many diverse groups, from the pro-immigrant community to businesses and agricultural companies, have come out against it.</p>
<p>One key message of these groups that is often overlooked is that E-Verify would add significant responsibilities and workload to an agency that is already overworked and underfunded. The Social Security Administration is one of the most efficient government agencies, operating at less than 1 percent overhead costs. Forcing SSA to handle the administrative nightmare of E-Verify is worse than the usual conservative position of &#8220;starving the beast&#8221; &#8212; it is more like starving the beast and making it run a marathon while carrying a 50 lb. backpack. That&#8217;s because in addition to drastically increasing the responsibilities SSA would be faced with, the agency is already dealing with massive budget cuts that limit its administrative capacity. There are three compelling lines of argument against mandatory E-Verify:</p>
<p>1. Mandatory E-Verify would cost American workers their jobs and create confusion at SSA.</p>
<p>When E-Verify finds an inconsistency between a name and that person&#8217;s work authorization, it issues a &#8220;tentative nonconfirmation&#8221; (TNC), after which an employee has several days to contact SSA or DHS to correct the error or risk losing their job. Unfortunately, a significant number of these TNCs are <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/USCIS/E-Verify/E-Verify/Final%20E-Verify%20Report%2012-16-09_2.pdf"><u>issued in error</u></a>. (<a href="http://www.maldef.org/assets/pdf/e-verify_Trasvina_testimony_HRCommittee.pdf"><u>Errors are usually due</u></a> to clerical mistakes from inputting data, especially with hard-to-spell names or ones that have been hyphenated or changed, as well as errors by the workers themselves when filling out government forms.) In 2010, of the 16 million E-verify queries by employers, 128,000 (0.8 percent of the total) required the employee to go to SSA or call DHS to fix the problem. Of those 0.8 percent errors, 0.3 percent were discovered to be in error and were later corrected. But 0.5 percent &#8212; <i>over half of all errors</i> &#8212; were falsely issued &#8220;final nonconfirmations,&#8221; essentially forcing their employer to wrongly fire them. 0.3 percent may not sound like very many, but with a total American workforce of 154 million, that translates to <a href="http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2011/06/e_verify.html"><u><i>over 770,000 jobs lost</i></u></a>. (Tyler Moran, Policy Director of the National Immigration Law Center, has a thorough explanation of how many workers would be affected, and why it is so hard for workers to challenge the system.)</p>
<p>So what does this mean for SSA? It translates to an already overburdened staff that now has to deal with hundreds of thousands of extra calls and office visits, sometimes entailing a lengthy review process for individual cases. In 2008, when there were only 7 million E-Verify queries, <a href="http://www.socialsecurity.gov/oig/ADOBEPDF/A-03-09-19052.pdf"><u>88,000 people</u></a> called the 1-800 number or visited SSA due to E-Verify errors. If the program were mandatory, SSA would have to review 154 million records in the initial implementation period: if the rate of people calling SSA was the same as 2008, that would be nearly <i>2 million more calls</i> into the agency during that period alone.</p>
<p>2. SSA is already underfunded and overburdened, and cannot afford to take on the consuming and perpetual E-Verify project.</p>
<p>SSA has long been underfunded. Agency administrative expenses alone have been shorted 8 of the last 10 years (compared with the amount it requested of Congress to operate at full capacity). There was a particularly huge cut in 2011, almost a billion dollars below the required level, that was part of the last-minute compromise between Speaker Boehner and the Democrats a few months ago.</p>
<p>Because of those negotiations, SSA has already had to take several measures to limit its regular operations because it simply can&#8217;t afford them &#8212; many of which (ironically, although perhaps not unintentionally) will increase costs further. For one, last month the agency stopped sending out annual earnings statements to all workers under 65. (Leave aside the fact that they only <a href="http://newshour.tumblr.com/post/6076678767/social-security-administration-stops-sending-earnings"><u>cost SSA $30 million in 2011</u></a>, and help millions of Americans with their retirement planning while double-checking that SSA has the correct data for them.) The agency still expects that it will experience increased call volume from confused people wondering why they didn&#8217;t get their statements and hoping to confirm their information either in person or on the phone.</p>
<p>E-Verify proponents often claim, in response, that SSA would be funded to keep up with its new responsibilities. While that&#8217;s theoretically possible, it&#8217;s unlikely, given the Republicans&#8217; current impulse to cut every government program in sight. It&#8217;s easy to imagine a scenario whereby SSA is forced to cut <i>even more</i> of its regular operations in order to accommodate the new E-Verify agenda. Critical goals of the agency, such as reducing the <a href="http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d11125.pdf"><u>unacceptably long backlog for pending claims</u></a>, would have to be ignored further into the future. Or maybe it was the point all along to cripple the administration of Social Security benefits themselves and attack this <a href="http://strengthensocialsecurity.org/sites/default/files/SocialSecurity&#038;FutureofDemocraticParty_ShortFormREV_1.pdf"><u>extremely popular program</u></a> through the back door.</p>
<p>3. E-verify would remove millions of taxpayers from the pool that pays into Social Security, thus weakening the solvency of the Trust Fund.</p>
<p>As we&#8217;ve seen, the point of E-Verify is to remove illegal workers from legal employment, likely ending their tax contributions to Social Security and other federal revenue streams. This is a wasted opportunity, as any undocumented worker that pays taxes provides a net gain to the system (since they don&#8217;t collect benefits). As we all should know by now, undocumented workers are not going to leave the country when E-Verify comes knocking. They fill an important niche in our economy and are here to stay &#8212; the only difference is that more of them will be funneled into the underground economy, or miscategorized as (partially tax-exempt) independent contractors. One 2008 bill that would have made E-Verify mandatory without a pathway to legalization would have <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/91xx/doc9100/hr4088ltr.pdf"><u>decreased federal revenue by $22 billion</u></a> over 10 years.</p>
<p>Of the approximately 8 million undocumented workers, it is estimated that about two-thirds of them pay payroll taxes into the Social Security Trust Fund, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/02/AR2010090202673.html."><u>accounting for $12 billion in 2007</u></a>. (The Trust Fund is the total pot of surplus money paid into Social Security that is not immediately sent out as benefits, now totaling $2.7 trillion.) In sum, undocumented workers have contributed somewhere between $120 and $240 billion to the Trust Fund, accounting for 5.4 to 10.7 percent of its total assets. In addition, these workers tend to be younger than the average American, so the impact of their tax contributions will grow as the Baby Boomers retire and the percentage of seniors in America rises from 12 percent to 18 percent. According to the chief actuary of SSA, without the contributions of undocumented workers, the Trust Fund would run out of assets <i>six years earlier</i> than estimated in the 2010 Trustees Report. That&#8217;s staggering.</p>
<p>According to most experts, mandatory E-Verify wouldn&#8217;t affect those who already receive Social Security benefits, because current beneficiaries receive their checks through a mostly automatic process. But this much is sure: nearly everyone else would be affected. It is anyone&#8217;s guess how SSA would respond to being buried with new caseloads at a time when, <i>even pre-E-Verify</i>, &#8220;unprecedented workloads combined with declining budgets [have] damaged [the agency&#8217;s] service delivery,&#8221; according to the <a href="http://waysandmeans.house.gov/UploadedFiles/Moran_Embargoed_Testimony.pdf"><u>SSA Commissioner</u></a> himself. I&#8217;ll leave it to the immigration experts to suggest <a href="http://www.nilc.org/immsemplymnt/SSA_Related_Info/SSA-subcommittee-Moran-testimony-4-14-11.pdf"><u>how E-Verify needs to be improved</u></a> before making it mandatory &#8212; but for now at least, mandatory E-Verify is the surest way to threaten the social safety net with paralysis. Let&#8217;s hope that if E-Verify makes it through the Senate without comprehensive reform attached, Obama will roll out the veto on this one.</p>

                                <p>Guest post by <strong>Nancy Ortiz</strong> </p>
<p>(Rdan here&#8230;Nancy is a long time reader of Angry Bear and has worked within the Social Security system professionally)</p>
<p>One of the many fixes now being considered as a remedy for Social Security and Medicare&#8217;s projected shortfalls is means testing benefits. The rationale is that rich people shouldn&#8217;t get SS because &#8220;they don&#8217;t need it.&#8221; Many people who ought to know better believe this would save a great deal of money and help fix the 2037 benefit gap. Sorry, people. This idea isn&#8217;t worth the paper it&#8217;s rotten on (as Dorothy Parker once said about someone else&#8217;s screen play). The short and long of it is that it costs more to means test benefits than to pay SS benefits without regard to the beneficiary&#8217;s income and assets. <a name="more"></a>   <br />How do I know this is true? The Social Security Administration (SSA) administers two programs: the basic SS program and Supplemental Security Income (SSI), a means-tested federal public assistance program for poor aged, blind and disabled people. You have to have worked 40 quarters to receive SS, but no work is required for SSI. It is a &#8220;welfare&#8221; program, not a social insurance program. SSI began on Jan. 1, 1974. In the intervening years, SSA has had plenty of experience trying to run this complex and challenging program. It has learned that SSI costs at least 7 times more dollar for dollar to administer than its regular SS program.  <br />There are many reasons. The federal government establishes overall SSI eligibility and payment levels, but each state can pay optional amounts over and above those required by federal law. In effect, there are 50 different SSI programs across the country. Earlier this week, CBS ran an article online with an account of a House Ways and Means Committee hearing about SSA&#8217;s improper benefit payments. Here&#8217;s the link. <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/06/14/in_depth_us/main20071107.shtml">http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/06/14/in_depth_us/main20071107.shtml</a>    <br />SSA was third in the list of federal agencies making improper payments to its beneficiaries and recipients. The first two in order were DHHS (Medicare, Medicaid, and TANF with $71.4 billion ) and DOL (Unemployment benefits $17.5 billion). DOD is not mentioned in this article presumably because the amount of DOD&#8217;s improper payments cannot be determined. SSA&#8217;s total was $8 billion, including $4 billion in improper SSI  payments, out of a total of $650 billion in benefits paid for all programs.     <br />Congress has underfunded SSA since the 1980&#8217;s, sometimes more&#8211; sometimes less, but consistently for at least 30 years. The agency is  understaffed as a result. This has produced a 10% error rate in SSI payments as compared to a .05% error rate in SS benefits. This is because SSI is very labor intensive. The recipients are poor, often functionally or completely illiterate, and don&#8217;t speak English well or at all. Interviews are longer, the topics covered more complex, the documentation requirements much more extensive than in the SS program. Furthermore, you have to reinterview recipients frequently to be sure they&#8217;re still eligible. So, not only is it harder to process the claims to begin with but also you have to do the work all over again every year. If you don&#8217;t have the staff, you can&#8217;t do the work fast enough or accurately enough to produce a low error rate.     <br />SSA&#8217;s Inspector General summed up the state of SSA&#8217;s efforts to improve payment accuracy in his statement for the record at Ways and Means&#8217; hearing. See <a href="http://waysandmeans.house.gov/UploadedFiles/ocarrol222.pdf">http://waysandmeans.house.gov/UploadedFiles/ocarrol222.pdf</a>  SSA plans to spend $796M on quality control in 2011 and at least as much in 2012, budget permitting. This includes local office and end-of-line quality reviews, studies to determine causes of error, costs for computer matches in-house and out-of-house, Continuing Disability Reviews, redeterminations of eligibility, and the like. There are many more ways to reduce payment errors. But they cost more money than the ones listed above.     <br />In SSI or any other means-tested program today, all income and any assets, no matter how small in dollar or market value, have to be reported. Any change in stated income and assets must be reported, recorded and verified. If the parents of a disabled child work, for example, they have to report all changes in their income whenever they occur. People who enter or leave the household cause a change in the payment level. Gifts of money or determinable value can reduce payments. Ownership of real estate other than a principle residence also count against the asset limit of $2000.00 for an individual ($3000.00 for a couple). So, if the recipient is a tenant in common in real estate having a value over the limit, s/he is ineligible. This is common in intestate estates in which numerous relatives may have a share in unmarketable rural property. I could go on, but your eyes are already glazing over.   <br />The obvious response is to say that means testing SS could be designed in such a way as to get around these problems.  But, the fact is that the limits set on income and assets are absolute dollar limits not subject to waiver or tolerances. So, means testing means one thing and one thing only. You have to check and recheck everything that affects eligibility every year for every eligible person. And, that takes staff which costs money. About 50 million people receive SS and SSI benefits. I cannot even guess what it would cost to handle that many new eligibility determinations. We must look elsewhere to find a fix for the coming SS benefit gap. </p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Reuters reports that <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/43290858">the mainstream Republican Party has decided to <s>jump the shark</s> admit it is insane</a>:<br />
<blockquote>David Frum, a former speechwriter for President George W. Bush and a Republican advocate for raising the debt limit, said he holds regular question-and-answer sessions with Republican congressman over a beer.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have yet to meet one Republican who actually says a failure to raise the debt limit scares them,&#8221; Frum said. &#8220;It is deeply, deeply troubling the number of Republicans I now talk to &#8211; and I include the mainstream &#8211; who think a technical default is manageable.&#8221;</p>
<p>Many on Wall Street disagree.</p>
<p>They fear even the briefest default would cause a steep climb in interest rates worldwide and a tumbling U.S. dollar, which would tip a fragile economy back into recession and cause financial market upheaval on a scale not seen since the collapse of Lehman Bros.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let us be clear: a &#8220;technical default&#8221; is manageable. It is <em><strong>being managed right now</strong></em>. We&#8217;ve been in &#8220;technical default&#8221; since <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2011/04/will-the-us-really-default-in-may-if-the-debt-ceiling-isnt-raised/237719/">around May 15th</a>. Vendors are seeing payments delayed, contract signings are being put off, funding is being delayed. We can <a href="http://modeledbehavior.com/2011/02/04/failure-to-pay-us-soldiers-is-not-default/">not pay soldiers</a>, after all. They&#8217;re getting food and lodging in Afghanistan or Iraq or Libya anyway; they don&#8217;t need money.</p>
<p>Pat Toomey appears to believe that would be a good idea:<br />
<blockquote>Republican Senator Pat Toomey has even introduced legislation directing the U.S. Treasury to prioritize debt service over other payments if the debt limit is not raised. It has 22 Republican co-sponsors in the Senate and 98 in the House of Representatives, although no members of the Republican leadership have backed it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Good thing Toomey thinks those <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/china-us-debt-ceiling-2011-6">ungrateful Chinese bondholders</a> are important. But who are they more important than?</p>
<p>Short answer: Republican voters.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />Longer answer: Social Security recipients, who traditionally receive their checks and direct deposits on the 3rd of the month.</p>
<p>Which means the funding has to be available—to authorize scheduled ACH transfers, if nothing else—on the 2nd.</p>
<p>Which means— since for purposes of the &#8220;deficit,&#8221; Social Security is part of the &#8220;unified budget&#8221;—that Social Security&#8217;s EOD balance will decline on August 2nd, since there will be no coupon receipts or security redemptions that day.</p>
<p>In short, Toomey wants to pay bondholders and screw Social Security recipients. And he has at 110 Senators and Representatives who believe that is a good idea.</p>
<p>I want to see all 111 of them meet with all of their SocSec recipients on 3 August 2011 and tell them, &#8220;Well, we had to balance the suffering. And it was either you or the Chinese government. And they <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2011/06/httprobertreichorgpost6188608377.html">mean more to us than you do</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>UPDATE: Felix <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2011/06/08/will-geithner-prioritize-debt-repayment/">focuses on the same paragraph</a>, reaching half of the same conclusion. Take the next step, mate.</p>

<blockquote><p>House Republicans on Friday introduced legislation that would allow workers to partially opt out of Social Security immediately, and fully opt out after 15 years.</p>
<p>Rep. Pete Sessions (R-NY), who chairs the National Republican Congressional Committee, and several other Republicans introduced the Savings Account for Every American (SAFE) Act. Under the bill, workers would immediately have 6.2 percent of their wages sent to a &#8220;SAFE&#8221; account each year.</p>
<p>That would take the place of the 6.2 percent the workers now contributed to Social Security.</p>
<p>Another 6.2% is sent to Social Security by employers. Under the Sessions bill, employers would continue to make this matching contribution to Social Security, but after 15 years, employers could also send that amount to the employee&#8217;s SAFE account.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>[snip]</p>
<p>Under <a href="http://thehill.com/images/stories/blogs/flooraction/Jan2011/sessionssafe.pdf">the bill</a>, employees would be able to make tax free contributions to their SAFE account, and take tax-free distributions at retirement age. The bill would also allow employees to stay with the Social Security program if they wish.</p>

<p>The issue&#8211;the House&#8217;s adoption of the Ryan budget proposal and its clear agenda of overturning New Deal safety nets embodied in the current understanding of Medicaid, Social Security and Medicare.</p>
<p>Those at or near retirement are worried that the Ryan proposal will hurt everybody. The Ryan proposal comes with frequent disclaimers about protecting the already older population and needing to act now to protect our grandchildren, a clear effort to massage the message to appeal to current grandparents. See, e.g., <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/27/us/politics/27congress.html" target="_blank" _mce_href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/27/us/politics/27congress.html">House G.O.P.

Renee Ellmers&#8217;claim that &#8220;If you&#8217;re 55 and older, your Medicare and Social Security will not change&#8221;).<br /><a name="more"></a><br />But the Ryan proposal clearly envisions mechanisms that would likely lead to decimation of these programs&#8211;either through turning them into limited vouchers (Medicare proposal); turning the funds over to the states to use as they see fit (Medicaid proposal) or limiting benefits (Social Security proposal) in ways that will &#8211;probably sooner rather than later&#8211; hurt everybody.</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>These proposals take place in a context of expansive, concerted attacks on these &#8220;entitlement&#8221; programs, often failing to acknowledge the historic support for these programs or their foundation in the recognition that federal support is required to protect against the abject poverty and humiliating degradation that accompanied the Great Depression;</li>
<li>Benefits for elderly and sick Americans are cut to provide savings to offset some of the loss of revenues from tax cuts for Big Business and the wealthy, both of whom already pay relatively low taxes, in what hardly seems a bargain to the working poor, the elderly or in fact the overwhelming majority of Americans who are not in the top 15% income or wealth distribution. (This in spite of Ryan&#8217;s claim that there is no huge tax cut for big corporations and the wealthy&#8211;he asserts that the proposed 25% rate is &#8220;in exchange for losing their tax shelters&#8221;. See, e.g., CBS.com <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=7363939n&#038;tag=related;photovideo" target="_blank" _mce_href="http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=7363939n&#038;tag=related;photovideo">Evening News coverage of Paul Ryan holding Wis. town meetings</a>, at <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=7363939n&#038;tag=related;photovideo" _mce_href="http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=7363939n&#038;tag=related;photovideo">http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=7363939n&#038;tag=related;photovideo</a> )</li>
<li>In spite of the high cost for the vulnerable poor and elderly of these budget proposals, they don&#8217;t appear likely to achieve their proffered rationale of reducing debt and deficits&#8211;in fact, the CBO has said that the Ryan budget proposal will result in higher deficits and bigger debt burdens over the next decade.</li>
<p>
<li>It appears shortsighted to wring one&#8217;s hands about a &#8220;bankrupt country&#8221; while considering only one potential solution, especially when that solution is highly detrimental to the most vulnerable populations, and without considering the full facts regarding the amount of debt, the ability of the U.S. to weaken the dollar further to aid unemployment and debt payment, the ability of the U.S. to raise taxes judiciously rather then merely cutting spending, or the ability of the U.S. to let the tax law play out as it is currently slated to do (with the Bush tax cuts that were extended 2 more years over their originally intended short life due to sunset in 2012). As Jim Johnson, a former Ryan supporter who has &#8220;grown increasingly disgusted&#8221; with Ryan noted, &#8220;[Ryan] says Medicare is unsustainable. I&#8217;m thinking, &#8216;Yeah, it&#8217;s because medical costs are out of control.&#8217; &#8230;Why isn&#8217;t he attacking it at that level?&#8221; <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/04/26/ap/national/main20057685.shtml" target="_blank" _mce_href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/04/26/ap/national/main20057685.shtml">Congressional Republicans go home to mixed reviews</a>, CBS News.com</li>
<p>
<li>Any voucher system for health care will inevitably fail to cover increasing health care costs, resulting in rationing even the most basic health care by socio-economic class&#8211;the very problem that Medicare, Medicaid, and the limited health care reforms undertaken by the last Congress were intended to address. The Center for Budget and Policy Priorities concluded that <a href="http://www.cbpp.org/cms/index.cfm?fa=view&#038;id=3473">out-of-pocket medical costs would skyrocket for low-income seniors</a>; the Washington Post&#8217;s Fact Checker Glenn Kessler (in <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/post/gop-lawmakers-tout-medicare-reform-by-stretching-a-comparison-to-the-health-benefits-they-receive/2011/04/28/AFrRkM9E_blog.html">GOP Lawmakers tout Medicare reform by stretching a comparison to the health benefits they receive</a>, Apr. 29, 2011) notes that the CBO analysis concluded that the Ryan Medicare system would pay only 32% of health care costs by 2030, compared to 70-75% if traditional Medicare remained in place.</li>
<p>
<li>Addressing the problems in the U.S. health care system solely by market means that put the onus on health care recipients to seek cost-savings has failed miserably over the last forty years and cannot help but fail more spectacularly when the Medicaid backup is weakened and the nature of health care needs is such that one of the best antidotes to market problems (the only one permitted in radical market thinking that objects to regulatory safeguards)&#8211;informed consumers who can review options and select among competing providers&#8211;is simply not applicable. Car accident victims don&#8217;t shop for surgeons; cancer victims don&#8217;t know enough to select based on price; etc.</li>
<li>The Ryan proposal appears one-sided in its decision to cut spending on potentially vulnerable populations rather than to address the means through which health care is provided or to consider ways to control profit-taking in the health care system. The market ideology of the proposers leaves many options that might work better off the table (single payer; tax on excessive compensation; revamping the non-profit hospital system; attaching strings to the R&#038;D and other tax expenditures in the tax code; using the clout of a national system to negotiate better doctor and drug pricing for Medicare and Medicaid, etc.);</li>
<li>Many of those states that would acquire more control over the use of Medicaid funds are controlled now, as is the House, by people who have announced their intent to cut taxes on the wealthy and business while cutting or taxing pensions and health benefits for public employees and cutting funds available for Medicaid and other poverty-directed programs; it is not a difficult leap to see the interrelationship of these trends;</li>
<li>Plans to cut benefits for those who may enjoy them in the future pave the way in at least two ways for decisions shortly thereafter to cut benefits for those who currently enjoy them: first, by creating lowered expectations; second, by creating an unfair disparity that supports an &#8220;us against them&#8221; attitude between the current elderly and those who will get lesser benefits in the future. (Note that this resembles the way the right has encouraged an &#8220;us against them&#8221; attitude of <em>private workers</em>, who have been deprived of union benefits through the harsh anti-union tactics used by Big Business, against <em>public employees</em>, who have generally benefited in the past from more reasonable attitudes towards unions fostered in legislative bodies that have, in the past, understood the nature of the bargain that public employees make (which might be summarized as &#8216;work hard, get paid less than you could in the private sector, and accept later benefits in pensions and health care for lesser salary/percs now).</li>
</ul>

<p>Is is surprising that left-leaning activist groups like Move-On point to the Ryan budget proposal as a &#8220;naked, unapologetic attack on working Americans for the sake of Big Insurance and the riches of the rich&#8221; (quote from Move-On email on this matter)?</p>

                                <p>Guest post by <strong>Dale Coberly</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sixteen Men on a Dead Man&#8217;s Chest</strong> Yo Ho Ho<br />Social Security and the Facts of Life</p>
<p>Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) said on Sunday the &#8220;Gang of Six&#8221; senators is &#8220;very close&#8221; to a deal on deficit reduction, suggesting the plan would impact Social Security that most Democrats have said is off limits.<br />Asked by host Bob Schieffer to clarify that the group will take on Social Security, Warner said, &#8220;Part of this is just math: 16 workers for every one retiree 50 years ago, three workers for every retiree now.&#8221;</p>
<p>What we have learned in ten years of watching the Social Security &#8220;debate&#8221; is that when someone says &#8220;it&#8217;s just math,&#8221; he is lying.   Unless, of course, a United States Senator simply doesn&#8217;t know what he is talking about.</p>
<p>The &#8220;16 workers for every one retiree&#8221; is one of those true facts that doesn&#8217;t mean anything&#8230;  and is therefore used by liars to mean what they want it to mean.<br />The Senator does not read Angry Bear,  but in the hope that one of his friends will try to explain it to him, I offer the following simplified model.</p>
<p>Update: The Atlanta Fed <a target="_blank" href="http://macroblog.typepad.com/macroblog/2006/10/if_you_care_abo.html">Macroblog</a> from 2006 includes Dean Baker, pgl, Ken Houghton on this issue.  </p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />Imagine that the voters of America look around themselves and see a crisis where millions of people approaching retirement age have lost their savings by no fault of their own.  Perhaps a Great Depression or something like that.  There is no time for all these older workers to again save enough to retire on.  Workers who have already reached retirement age are receiving &#8220;welfare.&#8221;  But the voters don&#8217;t like the idea of a permanent &#8220;welfare establishment&#8221; as the &#8220;normal&#8221; way for workers to get through their retirement years.<br />So they decide to try a simple plan..  a retirement insurance system based on the idea of pay as you go.  And here is how it works.. worked.  Remember I said this is simplified.</p>
<p>Imagine that in the first year of the plan there are 40 million workers, one million in each age cohort&#8230; that is, one million aged 25, one million aged 26, &#8230; etc.  up to one million aged 64. So far there are NO retirees in the system.  If each worker pays a &#8220;tax&#8221; of one percent of his income, there will be enough money so that..</p>
<p>In the next year one million people become 65 and retire. And one million who were 24 last year become 25 and get jobs and start paying the tax. And of course each cohort moves up to the next year.</p>
<p>Now there are forty million workers and one million retirees, a ratio of forty workers for every one retiree .  And if each worker is paying 1% of his income into the system, there will be enough money to pay-as-you-go each retiree 40% of the average income of all the workers. The 40% is called &#8220;the replacement rate.&#8221; it will be roughly enough to replace 40% of the average lifetime monthly income of each of the retirees.. adjusted for the average increase in wages over 40 years. )<br />The next year, another million will retire, bringing the ratio of workers to retirees to 40 to 2, or 20 to 1 (remember that every cohort moves up a year, and one million new workers enter at age 25 replacing those who retire at age 65.  Now it will be necessary to raise the &#8220;tax&#8221; to 2%.</p>
<p>At this point the Senator Warners of the world get hysterical.. &#8220;A doubling of the tax. We&#8217;re all going to die!&#8221;  And the &#8220;non partisan experts&#8221; project that if this keeps up, in only 30 years the tax will be ONE MILLION PERCENT!.<br />But the workers say,  two percent isn&#8217;t so bad and it goes for a good cause.  So they keep paying as they go.</p>
<p>The next year the ratio of workers to retirees becomes 40 to 3 (13 to 1).  and the tax goes up to 3%.  Note that we have already passed the 16 to1 ratio without even noticing it.</p>
<p>The next year the ratio becomes 40 to 4, or 10 to 1, and the tax goes to 4%<br />And the next year the ratio becomes 40 to 5, or 8 to 1.  Or does it?  Well, sadly, no.  By this time some of the retired workers have begun to die off&#8230; so the number of retirees does not increase by the full million new retirees, but by some number like one million new retirees minus some hundred thousand older retirees who have died  And while the ratio of workers to retirees will continue to decline, it won&#8217;t continue to decline at the rate it did for the first few years.<br />In fact, if the life expectancy of retirees is about 12 years&#8230;  half of them will die by the age of 77&#8230;  the ratio of workers to retirees will stabilize at around 3 to 1.  ( The ratio of workers to retirees depends very much on the ratio of working years to retirement years for each worker. )</p>
<p>This will require a tax rate of about 12% in order to pay that replacement rate of 40% of a workers average lifetime adjusted income&#8230; or, which is the same thing, 40% of the current average income.  Note that sneaky &#8220;adjusted&#8221; income.  That is the secret of pay as you go.  By adjusting the income of retirees to reflect the inflation and rise in real standard of living that shows up in the wages of those paying the tax, the retirees get an automatic effective &#8220;interest&#8221; on their tax&#8230; which now looks exactly like &#8220;savings.&#8221; </p>
<p>Meanwhile the workers are putting away 12% of their income (or 6% depending on who you think would get the boss&#8217;s share if there were no SS tax), and this is exactly what they would have had to save out of their income for a basic &#8220;if all else fails&#8221; retirement.  This seemed like a good idea at the time&#8230; the people who were living then had seen what happens to &#8220;sure things on the stock market,&#8221;  and they wanted a little insurance &#8220;just in case,&#8221; and they were smart enough to know they had to pay for it.</p>
<p>Now, what Senator Warner is so sure is going to cause the sky to fall on our heads is the prediction that we are all going to live a little longer&#8230; as much as twenty years in retirement, bringing the ratio of workers to retirees down to 2:1.  Other things being equal, this would require that we save about 20% of our working income, if we are going to need about 40% of that income every month to see us through a long retirement.</p>
<p>Since we are making more than twice as much as our grandparents, you&#8217;d think we could afford this.  But let me make it a little clearer.  Suppose grandpa was making a thousand dollars a week real money and paying 120 dollars into his retirement fund, and expecting to live about 12 years after he retired.   Now suppose that great great grandson will expect to live about 20 years after he retires.  He will need to pay 20% to cover the expense of a longer life.  But he is making twice what grandpa made.  So out of his 2000 dollars per week, he needs to save 400 dollars in his retirement fund.  But that leaves him &#8220;only&#8221; 1600 dollars to live on.<br />Compared to the 880 dollars grandpa had to live on.  You can see the tragedy of this situation.  Great grandchild has to get along on less than twice what his grandpa did, and all so that he can afford to live almost twice as long in retirement.  </p>
<p>Oh the unfairness!  Oh the financial ruin!  </p>
<p>As I said, the above was a simplified explanation. The true fact is that in order to pay for their longer life expectancy, the workers would need to raise their own Social Security contribution by about forty cents per week per year&#8230; in today&#8217;s money.  Eventually, two generations from now, this would amount to a 2% increase on the tax for the worker, and 2% for the employer.  Out of an income that will be more than double what it is today.  Leaving the worker with twice as much money &#8220;after taxes&#8221; as he has today.  Plus he will get the money back, with interest, over a retirement that lasts almost twice as long as his grandparents&#8217;.</p>
