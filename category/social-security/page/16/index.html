                                <p>by Bruce Webb (UPDATE: Digby readers, I want to make it clear that I am not NewDealDemocrat, I just got permission to cross-post this important compilation from NDD.)</p>
<p>Blog friend NewDealDemocrat has a recommended diary up on dKos called <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2010/2/16/837014/-Mr.-President,-no-*Real*-Democrat-is-agnostic-about-Social-Security">Mr. President, No Real Democrat is agnostic about Social Security</a>. NewDeal gave me an advance look and authorized me to cross post it which I am doing below the fold. I don&#8217;t entirely endorse the conclusions but think this is an important reference work, NewDeal having tracked down just about every public statement ever made by Obama on Social Security. So this is more an archival post to be added to the Social Security series. Comment here if you like but I would urge everyone registered at dKos to put in a word over there.</p>
<p>And yes as New Deal warns this is very long.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />by NewDealDemocrat</p>
<p>Last week President Obama <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-02-11/obama-agnostic-on-deficit-cuts-won-t-prejudge-tax-increases.html">said</a> that he will be &#8220;agnostic&#8221; as to any changes, including Social Security benefit cuts, that his debt reduction commission recommends.  This is a far cry from his constant campaign rhetoric in which he promised to listen to all recommendations, but <em>his</em> plan was to raise the payroll cap on contributions.</p>
<p>This is a sad but necessary piece in which I lay out the evidence, which I believe is compelling, that Barack Obama&#8217;s own words and deeds reveal that his real agenda all along has been to use a commission or summit to cut Social Security benefits, and that the campaign rhetoric was just a sop to anesthetize opposition.  This for a program that, at worst, faces a shortfall 30 years from now, and that Obama himself called the cornerstone of the American social compact.</p>
<p><em>(Apologies, this is really long.  But to reveal the truth, a truth that has been hiding in plain sight right before our eyes all along, the full record must be laid out.)</em></p>
<p>Of his Social Security system, <a href="http://www.aei.org/article/29050">FDR bluntly called it</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>politics all the way through. We put those pay roll contributions there so as to give the contributors a legal, moral, and political right to collect their pensions and their unemployment benefits. With those taxes in there, no damn politician can ever scrap my social security program. Those taxes aren&#8217;t a matter of economics, they&#8217;re straight politics.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>So you would think that a Democratic President would be an ardent supporter of ensuring that workers received the benefits under the system that they had worked for and contributed to their entire lives.  Not so.  Last week President Obama said that<br />
<blockquote>a presidential commission on the budget needs to consider all options for reducing the deficit, including tax increases and cuts in spending on entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare.</p>
<p>“The whole point of it is to make sure that all ideas are on the table,” the president said in the interview with Bloomberg BusinessWeek, which will appear on newsstands Friday. <strong>“So what I want to do is to be completely agnostic, in terms of solutions.”</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>   When Barack Obama does not actually support a plan, he offers vague platitudes but nothing more.  Such was his &#8220;support&#8221; for crucial, progressive, popular ideas about Health Care Reform, supposedly his Administration&#8217;s signature piece of legislation.  In contrast, when Barack Obama has wanted to, he has been relentless and decisive, as he was in September 2008 when he quickly and crucially <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/09/21/obama-on-bailout-this-pla_n_128072.html">supported the Wall Street bailout</a>.  And just last month, the White House was quick to <a href="http://www.eschatonblog.com/2010/01/not-confused-about-everything.html">whip a wavering Senate into line</a> about reconfirming Fed Chair Ben Bernanke with a 50, not 60, vote threshold.  More on the significance of that at then end of this article.</p>
<p>    So we need to look past Obama&#8217;s always-perfect rhetoric to see they are just flaccid platitudes or if his actions show firm resolution.  When it comes to Social Security, a comparison of what Obama the candidate said and what Obama the President has done show that his pledges to simply increase payroll taxes fall into the category of platitudes, while changing the program, apparently in part by cutting benefits, is clearly a matter of firm resolve.  In essence, Obama&#8217;s reasurance that while he would &#8220;convene a meeting&#8221; to listen to all sides, what he actually would propose would be a small increase in taxes on those earning over $250,000 who could easily afford it, was all along just a sop or a stalking horse to induce voters to overlook what was hiding in plain sight, namely his desire for a &#8220;nonpartisan&#8221; or &#8220;bipartisan&#8221; comission that would recommend cuts in Social Security benefits.<br />    The evidence comes right out of Obama&#8217;s mouth, and when put together, in my opinion is compelling.</p>
<p><strong>I.  Obama the Candidate </strong></p>
<p>    Candidate Barack Obama created a small firestorm in November 2007 after he <a href="http://www.nationaljournal.com/onair/transcripts/071108_obama_barack.htm">adopted a RW meme</a> and said:<br />
<blockquote>Senator Clinton says that she&#8217;s concerned about Social Security but is not willing to say how she would solve the Social Security crisis</p></blockquote>
<p>and followed that up with <a href="http://blogs.cqpolitics.com/davidcorn/2007/10/obamas-social-security-crisis.html">a campaign ad</a> in Iowa (no longer online)<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;that focused on Social Security[, i]n [which] he [told] a group of Iowans, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to just put my finger out to the wind and see what the polls say. I want to bring the country together to solve a problem.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>This RW claim that Social Security was in &#8220;crisis&#8221; created quite a stir, with <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/16/opinion/16krugman.html">Prof. Paul Krugman</a> saying that<br />
<blockquote>
<p>Lately, Barack Obama has been saying that major action is needed to avert what he keeps calling a “crisis” in Social Security — most recently in an interview with The National Journal. Progressives who fought hard and successfully against the Bush administration’s attempt to panic America into privatizing the New Deal’s crown jewel are outraged, and rightly so.</p></blockquote>
<p>That controversy erupted here as well, prompting me to write a diary explaining <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2007/11/26/103428/73">The Truth about Social Security,</a> in which I pointed out that Social Security is not in &#8220;crisis&#8221;, and is not a &#8220;real problem,&#8221;  manageable or not, needs no &#8220;fix,&#8221; nor any intermeddling &#8220;Commission.&#8221;  As stated by the official projections by the Social Security trustees, the program will be solvent without so much as lifting a little finger by anyone old enough to read or write on this blog under the revenue projections which over the last 15 years have almost always proven the most accurate.</p>
<p>Obama soon backtracked, and <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,305680,00.html">adopted a much more mainstream democratic position</a>, that he maintained right up until he was elected President. Here is his actual speech in Iowa in which he first set forth his position on Social Security:</p>
<p>In this video (beginning at about 5:40), Obama point-blank states that:<br /> &#8211;  &#8220;Social Security is the cornerstone of the social compact in this country.&#8221;<br /> &#8211;  &#8220;We also know that the system has problems.&#8221; (later in the video, he says that the items listed below will make Social Security &#8220;solvent&#8221; indicating that it isn&#8217;t now)<br /> &#8211;  &#8220;The underlying system is sound. The actual problem is a projected cash shortfall that can be readily solved. But the longer we wait to solve the problem, the bigger it grows,&#8221; &#8220;The question is, how to solve this problem&#8221; (of the trust fund being depleted in 2040, after which SS turns into a pay as you go system..)<br /> &#8211;  &#8220;On issues as fundamental as how to protect Social Security, a candidate for president owes it to the American people to tell us where they stand,&#8221; because you&#8217;re not ready to lead if you can&#8217;t tell us where you&#8217;re going.&#8221;<br /> &#8211;  &#8220;I do not believe that we need to cut benefits or raise the retirement age.&#8221;<br /> &#8211;  &#8220;The best option, in my view, is to ask the highest income Americans to contribute a little bit more by raising the ceiling on what is currently  paid on the amount of earnings subject to the social security tax.&#8221;<br /> &#8211;  &#8220;We need to stop borrowing millions from the Social Security trust fund&#8221; in the federal budget.</p>
<p>A campaign site that is still up goes into great detail about <a href="http://www.ontheissues.org/economic/barack_obama_social_security.htm">candidate Obama&#8217;s position with regard to Social Security</a>.  He emphasized three things:<br />(1) the belief that in the long run, Social Security was not solvent.<br />(2) While he would &#8220;convene a meeting&#8221; to discuss any and all options, forming a commission is exactly the wrong way to deal with the issue, but opposed forming a &#8220;binding&#8221; commission.<br />(3) Rising the limit on payroll contributions into the trust fund, beginning with incomre in excess of $250,000 was the best way to rectify the problem.</p>
<p>Here are Candidate Barack Obama&#8217;s constant refrains on each of the above three items from that campaign site:</p>
<p>1.  Social Security has a &#8220;problem&#8221;<br />
<blockquote><strong>Good health care and tax reform will save entitlements</strong></p>
<p>Q: How should we fix Social Security and other entitlement programs?<br />OBAMA: If we get our tax policies right so that they’re good for the middle class, if we reverse the policies of the last eight years that got us into this fix in the first place and that Sen. McCain supported, then we are going to be in a position to deal with Social Security and deal with Medicare&#8230;.</p>
<p><em>Source: 2008 second presidential debate against John McCain Oct 7, 2008</em></p>
<p>Q: We all know that Social Security is running out of money&#8230;.</p>
<p>A: &#8230;. we’ve got to make sure that we preserve Social Security is to do the same thing that Ronald Reagan and Tip O’Neill were able to do back in 1983, which is come up with a bipartisan solution that puts Social Security on a firm footing for a long time.</p>
<p><em>Source: 2007 YouTube Democratic Primary debate, Charleston SC Jul 23, 2007</em></p></blockquote>
<p>2.  Obama supported a bipartisan solution to this &#8220;problem&#8221; including holding a meeting to explore all optionsL<br />
<blockquote>Q: Would you raise the cap for Social Security tax above the current level of the first $97,500 worth of income?<br />A: I think that lifting the cap is probably going to be the best option. <strong>Now we’ve got to have a process [like the one] back in 1983. We need another one.</strong> And I think I’ve said before everything should be on the table. My personal view is that lifting the cap is much preferable to the other options that are available. But &#8230;we should reject things that will weaken the system, including privatization, which essentially is going to put people’s retirement at the whim of the stock market.</p>
<p><em>Source: 2007 Democratic primary debate at Dartmouth College Sep 6, 2007</em></p>
<p><strong>Cutting benefits &#038; raising retirement age are wrong answers</strong></p>
<p>Q: You said earlier this year that everything should be on the table for Social Security, including looking at raising retirement age, indexing benefits, and then suddenly you said, “I’m taking them off the table.”</p>
<p>A: That’s not what I said. I said I will convene a meeting as president where we discuss all of the options that are available. I believe that cutting benefits is not the right answer; and that raising the retirement age is not the best option, particularly when we’ve got people who are still in manufacturing.</p>
<p>Q: But in May you said they would be on the table.</p>
<p>A: Well, I am going to be listening to any ideas that are presented, but <strong>I think that the best way to approach this is to adjust the cap on the payroll tax so that people like myself are paying a little bit more and the people who are in need are protected. That is the option that I will be pushing forward.</strong></p>
<p>Q: But the other options would be on the table?</p>
<p>A: Well, I will listen to all arguments and the best options.</p>

<p><em>Source: Campaign booklet, “Blueprint for Change”, p. 16-19 Feb 2, 2008</em></p></blockquote>
<p>(emphasis within paragraphs mine)<br />But he was against delegating the issue to any appointed commission:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Must capture new revenue; no new Social Security Comission</strong></p>
<p>OBAMA: We’re going to have to capture some revenue in order to stabilize the Social Security system. You can’t get something for nothing. And if we care about Social Security, which I do, and if we are firm in our commitment to make sure that it’s going to be there for the next generation, and not just for our generation, then we have an obligation to figure out how to stabilize the system. <strong>I think we should be honest in presenting our ideas in terms of how we’re going to do that and not just say that we’re going to form a commission</strong> and try to solve the problem some other way.</p>

<p>(emphasis mine)</p>
<p>3.  Obama supported making up the shortfall by raising the cap on payroll taxes.<br />
<blockquote><strong>Raise cap on payroll tax for 3% of earners over $102,000</strong></p>
<p>Q: The Republicans &#8230; say for all your promises not to raise taxes on the middle class, that, in fact, you want to raise the cap on the Social Security payroll tax, and you also want to increase capital gains.</p>
<p>A: In terms of raising the cap on the payroll tax, right now everybody who’s making $102,000 or less pays 100% of payroll tax on 100% of their income. There are about 3% to 4% of Americans who are above $102,000 in income every year&#8230;.<br /><em><br />Source: 2008 Fox News interview: presidential series Apr 27, 2008</em><br /><strong><br />Raise $97K cap on payroll tax exempting earnings under $250K</strong></p>
<p>OBAMA: What I have proposed is that we raise the cap on the payroll tax, because right now millionaires and billionaires don’t have to pay beyond $97,000 a year&#8230;.</p>
<p>Q: But that’s a tax on people under $250,000.</p>
<p>OBAMA: That’s why I would look at potentially exempting those who are in between. This is an option that I would strongly consider, because the alternatives, like raising the retirement age, or cutting benefits, or raising the payroll tax on everybody, including people making less than $97,000 a year&#8211;those are not good policy options<br /><em><br />Source: 2008 Philadelphia primary debate, on eve of PA primary Apr 16, 2008</em></p>
<p><strong><br />The wealthy should pay a bit more on the payroll tax</strong></p>
<p>Social Security is not in crisis; it is a fundamentally sound system, but it does have a problem, long-term. We’ve got 78 million baby boomers, who are going to be retiring over the next couple of decades. That means more retirees, fewer workers to support those retirees. We are going to have to do something about it. The best idea is to lift the cap on the payroll tax, potentially exempting middle-class folks, but making sure that the wealthy are paying more of their fair share, a little bit more.</p>
<p><em>Source: 2007 Democratic debate at Drexel University Oct 30, 2007</em></p>
<p>What we need to do is to raise the cap on the payroll tax so that wealthy individuals are paying a little bit more into the system, if we are going to deal with this problem specifically.</p>
<p><em>Source: 2008 Facebook/WMUR-NH Democratic primary debate Jan 6, 2006</em></p></blockquote>
<p>    In short, Candidate Obama articulated a problem, a process, a preferred result &#8212; raising the cap on payroll contributions &#8212; and a rejected one &#8212; benefit cuts.  His campaign reiterated all of those in a closing campaign video in October 2008 that is still posted online:</p>
<p>Then Candidate Obama was elected President.  As we will see, while his commitment to &#8220;pushing forward&#8221; an increase in payroll taxes disappeared, as did his vow not to cut benefits and his denunciation of any &#8220;binding commisssion,&#8221; his determination that Social Security had a &#8220;problem&#8221; that was defined exclusively as &#8220;rising costs&#8221; and the commitment to convene a meeting to push forward &#8220;all&#8221; (really just GOP and Blue Dog) options to change Social Security was resolute.</p>
<p><strong>II. Obama the President</strong></p>
<p>If his campaign positions were soothing, his words and actions as President, beginning with his very <a href="http://www.alternet.org/election08/121123/obama%27s_inauguration_speech:_a_call_for_responsibility_and_sacrifice_at_a_time_of_gathering_storms/?page=1">Inauguration speech</a>, were not:</p>
<blockquote><p>That we are in the midst of crisis is now well understood&#8230;.  Our economy is badly weakened, a consequence of greed and irresponsibility on the part of some, but also <strong>our collective failure to make hard choices and prepare the nation for a new age</strong>. Homes have been lost; jobs shed; businesses shuttered. Our health care is too costly; our schools fail too many; and each day brings further evidence that the ways we use energy strengthen our adversaries and threaten our planet.<br />&#8230;.</p>
<p>We remain the most prosperous, powerful nation on Earth. Our workers are no less productive than when this crisis began. Our minds are no less inventive, our goods and services no less needed than they were last week or last month or last year. Our capacity remains undiminished. But <strong>our time of standing pat, of protecting narrow interests and putting off unpleasant decisions &#8211; that time has surely passed</strong>. Starting today, we must pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off, and begin again the work of remaking America.</p></blockquote>
<p>(emphasis mine).<br />Those were jarring words in an otherwise uplifting speech.  If Obama was opposed to raising taxes on the middle/working classes, then what could &#8220;hard choices&#8221; and &#8220;unpleasant decisions&#8221; for average Americans possibly mean besides cutting back further on their safety net?  News accounts of Obama&#8217;s felicitations to conservatives who wanted to destroy Social Security that very same week strongly suggest that is <em>exactly</em> what he meant.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/134879.php">In a speech on January 8, 2009</a>,<br />
<blockquote>President-elect Barack Obama said overhauling entitlement programs such as Medicare and Social Security will be &#8220;a central part&#8221; of his administration&#8217;s efforts to curb federal spending, the New York Times reports. Obama said, &#8220;We are beginning consultations with members of Congress around how we expect to approach the deficit,&#8221; adding, &#8220;We expect that discussion around entitlements will be a part, a central part, of those plans.&#8221;  Obama said, &#8220;If we do nothing, then we will continue to see red ink as far as the eye can see.&#8221; </p></blockquote>
<p>Four days before his Inauguration, he reiterated this theme in a private meeting with the editorial board of the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/01/15/AR2009011504114.html">Washington Post</a> during which he<br />
<blockquote>pledged &#8230; to shape a new Social Security and Medicare &#8220;bargain&#8221; with the American people, saying that the nation&#8217;s long-term economic recovery cannot be attained unless the government finally gets control over its most costly entitlement programs.</p>
<p>That discussion will begin next month, Obama said, when he convenes a &#8220;fiscal responsibility summit&#8221; before delivering his first budget to Congress. He said his administration will begin confronting the issues of entitlement reform and long-term budget deficits soon after it jump-starts job growth and the stock market.</p></blockquote>
<p>And <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/23/us/politics/23social.html"> shortly after his Inauguration,</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Mr. Obama unexpectedly approached [South Carolina Republican Senator Lindsey] Graham when he was at the White House to meet with Rahm Emanuel, Mr. Obama’s chief of staff. Mr. Graham &#8230; said in an interview: “I know he’s sincere about wanting to do something about entitlements generally, health care and Social Security. And I want to help him.”</p>
<p>Despite Mr. Obama’s interest, his political and policy advisers are divided &#8230;  Within the administration, John D. Podesta &#8230; is among those arguing for action sooner rather than later. “What this crisis has proven,” he said, “is that we need to have a basic benefit that keeps people out of poverty, and that we need to work at both ends — toward fiscal sustainability and toward ensuring that people, particularly at the bottom, have an adequate benefit.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>The February 2009 &#8220;Fiscal Responsibility Summit&#8221;</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/thefix/white-house/obama-to-hold-fiscal-responsib.html">The above January 15 Washington Post article</a> crowed that<br />
<blockquote>President-elect Barack Obama will convene a &#8220;fiscal responsibility summit&#8221; in February designed to bring together a variety of voices on solving the long term problems with the economy and with a special focus on entitlements&#8230;.</p>
<p>Those invited to attend will include Senate Budget Chairman Kent Conrad (N.D.), ranking minority member Judd Gregg (N.H.), the conservative Democratic Blue Dog coalition and a host of outside groups with ideas on the matter, said the president-elect.</p></blockquote>
<p>Chief among those Blue Dogs was representative Jim Coooper of Tennessee, the only democrat who voted in favor of Bush&#8217;s plan to privatize Social Security.</p>
<p>Progressives?  Not on the list.  At least, <a href="http://firedoglake.com/2009/02/19/if-ezra-klein-really-wants-to-end-the-entitlement-scare-he-should-do-it/">not until the last minute</a>.  As of February 19:<br />
<blockquote>Yesterday numerous sources in the health care policy world confirmed that the administration told them (again off the record)  that Pete Peterson and Laura Tyson would be keynote speakers&#8230;.</p>
<p>On a conference call today arranged by Campaign for America’s Future that included Roger Hickey, Jamie Galbraith, Nancy Altman and Dean Baker, Roger said that several of them had been told they might be invited to the summit, but no formal invitation had been issued yet (though Pete Peterson has his invitation).</p></blockquote>
<p>If you didn&#8217;t already know, Pete Peterson is the billionaire whose crusade to destroy Social Security and Medicare knows no bounds, and has been <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2009/12/7/810692/-The-%28Very-Real%29-Plot-to-Loot-Your-Social-Security">well-documented</a>.</p>
<p>While progressives were shut out until the last moment, <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123457407865686565.html">prior to the &#8220;summit,&#8221;</a><br />
<blockquote>Obama met with 44 fiscally conservative &#8220;Blue Dog&#8221; Democrats this week and gave a nod to legislation that would set up commissions to deal with long-term deficit strains. The commissions would then present plans to Congress for an up-or-down vote.</p>
<p>&#8220;We feel like we&#8217;ve found a partner in the White House,&#8221; said Rep. Charlie Melancon (D., La.), a Blue Dog co-chairman.</p></blockquote>
<p>So much for &#8220;listening to all voices.&#8221;</p>
<p>In short, only a month into his Administration, Candidate Obama&#8217;s insistence on tax hikes as the method of long term Social Security budget balancing was replaced by President Obama&#8217;s embrace of the <a href="http://firedoglake.com/2009/02/12/obama-social-security-and-the-diamond-orszag-plan/">Diamond-Orszag plan</a>, and a willingness to enforce it by way of a binding commission.  That name should be familiar too, because David Orszag is Obama&#8217;s budget director, whose<br />
<blockquote>long-running project &#8230; has been replacing talk of an “entitlement crisis” with his argument that Social Security requires only modest tax hikes <strong>and benefit cuts</strong>.</p></blockquote>
<p> (emphasis mine)  Here is a quick partial summary of the &#8220;Diamond-Orszag plan&#8221;:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our plan makes the painful choices that are necessary—<strong>selecting a combination of benefit and revenue changes</strong> to restore long-term balance. In doing so, it focuses on three areas which contribute to the actuarial imbalance: improvements in life expectancy, increases in earnings inequality, and the burden of the legacy debt from Social Security’s early history.</p>
<p>&#8230;. For younger workers with average earnings, our proposal involves a gradual reduction in benefits from those scheduled under current law.  For example, the reduction in benefits for a 45-year old <strong>average</strong> earner is less than 1 percent; for a 35-year-old, less than 5 percent; and for a 25-year-old, less than 9 percent. <strong>Reductions are smaller for lower earners, and larger for higher ones</strong>. </p></blockquote>
<p> (emphasis mine)</p>
<p>Because of the alarm that reports of the nature of the summit created, <a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/44/2009/02/20/obama_fiscal_responsibility_su.html"> it was shrunk to a three hour forum</a>, but the Administrtion let it be known that it was not wavering in its goals:<br />
<blockquote>[T]he administration has tried to tamp down expectations, saying only that the gathering is an opening gambit in a long process toward financial solvency.</p></blockquote>
<p>Expectations were &#8220;tamped down&#8221; only because, as the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/23/us/politics/23social.html">New York Times</a> reported:<br />
<blockquote>Mr. Obama considered announcing the formation of a Social Security task force at a White House “fiscal responsibility summit”&#8230;. But several Democrats said that idea had been shelved, partly because of objections from House and Senate leaders&#8230;.</p>
<p>Liberal Democrats are already serving notice that they will be equally vehement in opposing any reductions in scheduled benefits for future retirees.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>The Obama Administration&#8217;s continuing targeting of Social Security</strong></p>
<p>If, because of the opposition of Liberal Democrats, particularly in the House, the &#8220;summit&#8221; went nowhere, the fervor for cutting Social Security benefits never died.  Four days later, in a speech before a <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/remarks-of-president-barack-obama-address-to-joint-session-of-congress/">Joint Session of Congress</a> Obama stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;To preserve our long-term fiscal health, we must also address the growing costs in Medicare and Social Security,&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p> Even more ominously, conservative NY Time columnist David Brooks reported that in early March, <strong>&#8220;four senior Administration officials&#8221;</strong> paid him a visit and <a href="http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2009/03/obamacon-pepto.html">assured him that</a><br />
<blockquote> the long-range debt is what matters, and on this subject President Obama is hawkish.</p>
<p>He is extremely committed to entitlement reform and is <strong>plotting politically feasible ways to reduce Social Security</strong> as well as health spending.</p></blockquote>
<p>(emphasis mine)</p>
<p>But it turns out that it wasn&#8217;t just &#8220;senior officials.&#8221;  We found out later via a column in <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/191393/">Newsweek</a> that<br />
<blockquote> after Krugman&#8217;s fellow Times op-ed columnist David Brooks wrote a critical column accusing Obama of overreaching, Brooks, a moderate Republican, was cajoled by <strong>three different aides and by the president himself</strong>, who just happened to drop by.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>In other words, one of those four &#8220;officials&#8221; who assured him that the Administration was looking at ways to &#8220;reduce Social Security&#8221; was none other than President Barack Obama himself.</strong></p>
<p>Given the relentless and extensive background briefings by Obama himself to the likes of Brooks and the WaPo&#8217;s editorial board, the latter&#8217;s constant bashing of Social Security denounced by economists <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dean-baker/the-washington-post-rip_b_410726.html">Dean Baker</a> and <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2009/07/yet-more-washington-post-crashed-and-burned-watch-anti-social-insurance-puritanism-edition.html">Berkeley Prof. Brad DeLong</a>, among others, does not come out of nowhere.  Simply put, the WaPo knows, because he has told them, that despite Candidate Obama&#8217;s reassurances, President Obama very much wants to cut Social Security.</p>
<p> For example, Obama had yet another meeting with the WaPo editiorial board in July 2009, as reported by <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE56M0OO20090723">Reuters </a>:<br />
<blockquote>President Barack Obama, under pressure over the ballooning U.S. budget deficit, said on Wednesday he is preparing to launch an effort to rein in the escalating costs of the Social Security retirement fund and other popular government programs.</p>
<p>In an interview with the Washington Post, Obama said a new commission may be needed to examine reforms for addressing the deficit and the huge programs that contribute to the flow of red ink.<br /><strong><br />&#8220;I think we&#8217;re in a position to be able to, either at the end of this year or early next year, start laying out a broader picture about how we are going to handle entitlements in a serious way,&#8221;</strong> Obama said.</p>
<p>&#8230;.&#8221;The debt and the deficit are deep concerns of mine,&#8221; With public opinion polls showing people are nervous about the size of the deficit, Obama added, &#8220;I am very worried about federal spending.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8230;.&#8221;Probably what you end up having to do in terms of structural reforms realistically is you probably have to set up some sort of commission or mechanism that reports back with the prospect of maybe locking in a pledge for action, post-election,&#8221; he told The Washington Post. &#8220;Everything is going to have to be on the table.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8230;.Obama said the reform effort &#8220;may start with Social Security because that&#8217;s, frankly, the easier one.&#8221; He also said tax reform should be considered.</p></blockquote>
<p>Once again, note the about face on binding commissions.  And instead of focusing on payroll tax increases for those earning over $100,000, Obama says that tax reform should <strong>&#8220;also&#8221; </strong> be considered, meaning that the primary &#8220;reform&#8221; is to be benefit cuts to &#8220;rein in costs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Obama was true to his word that the matter would be placed on the front burner again at the end of 2009 or beginning of 2010.  In November, <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1109/29471.html">Politico reported</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>President Barack Obama plans to announce in next year&#8217;s State of the Union address that he wants to focus extensively on cutting the federal deficit in 2010 – and will downplay other new domestic spending beyond jobs programs, according to top aides involved in the planning.<br />&#8230;.<br />White House budget director Peter Orszag said in a statement to POLITICO: “The President strongly believes that as the recovery strengthens and job growth returns, we will have to take the tough steps necessary to return our nation to a fiscally disciplined and sustainable path.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Remember I told you that we would return to the reappointment of Fed Chair Ben Bernanke?  If Barack Obama couldn&#8217;t be bothered to expend any political capital to ensure that all Americans got reasonable health care, he certainly was able to whip a wavering Senate in line over something he considered important, like <a href="http://news.firedoglake.com/2009/12/03/bernanke-yes-to-social-security-cuts-no-to-new-jobs-bill/">Bernanke&#8217;s reappointment</a>.  Bernanke&#8217;s Senate reconfirmation testimony was surely cleared or at least known in advance by the White House and included the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>Ben Bernanke &#8230; arget[ed] nothing less than Social Security:</p>
<p>&#8230;. “I think you can’t tackle the problem in the medium term without doing something about getting entitlements under control and reducing the costs, particularly of health care.”</p>
<p>Bernanke reminded Congress that it has the power to repeal Social Security and Medicare.  “It’s only mandatory until Congress says it’s not mandatory. And we have no option but to address those costs at some point or else we will have an unsustainable situation,” said Bernanke [&#8230;]</p>
<p>Sen. Jack Reed (D-R.I.) followed Bennett and pointed out that “there’s only really two ways you can deflect this deficit, and that’s either by cutting expenditures or raising income taxes or other forms of taxes.”</p>
<p><strong>Reed asked him if he could think of other ways, but Bernanke returned to entitlement money as the way to balance the budget.</p>
<p>“Willie Sutton robbed banks because that’s where the money is, as he put it,” Bernanke said. “The money in this case is in entitlements.”</strong></p></blockquote>
<p> (emphasis mine)</p>
<p>On January 24, 2010, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/24/us/politics/24debt.html">Obama explicitly endorsed the Conrad-Gregg deficit commision</a>, the recommendations of which would be binding.  When that failed, he used his State of the Union address to announce that he would <a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2010/01/obamas-state-of-the-union-address--6.html">appoint a deficit commission of his own</a> via Executive Order.</p>
<p>I ask you:  if you are looking for a &#8220;neutral, nonpartisan&#8221; figure to cite as support for imposing benefit cuts (or perhaps to even spearhead the Commission), then who better than the Chairman of the Federal Reserve?</p>
<p>One final note:  remember how Candidate Obama constantly proclaimed that an increase in the ceiling for payment of payroll taxes was the only change that Social Security needed?  I searched and searched for any statement by President Barack Obama that that was still his position.  After December 2008 there are no such statements to be found anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>In Conclusion, I submit to you</strong> that after this long litany of Obama&#8217;s own words and actions, there can no longer any doubt that Candidate Obama&#8217;s soothing words were a ruse, but that President Obama is relentlessly pushing forward what he said all along he would do:  create a commission to examine changes in Social Security, and then enact them.  It is not on process but on substance that Candidate Obama lied. Oh, sure, payroll tax increases might &#8220;also&#8221; be considered &#8212; tax increases that surely he will &#8216;push forward&#8217; with all of the vigor he &#8216;pushed forward&#8217; critical elements of Health Care Reform.</p>
<p>No <strong>real</strong> Democrat is &#8220;agnostic&#8221; about Social Security. As Obama himself solemnly swore, &#8220;On issues as fundamental as how to protect Social Security, a candidate for president&#8221; does indeed &#8220;owe it to the American people to tell us where they stand,&#8221; and on the ultimate substance of his stand Candidate Obama lied.  So  nobody should be surprised if millions of democratic voters become &#8220;agnostic&#8221; about the re-election of faux &#8220;democrats&#8221; who do what no Republican has been able to do &#8212; to wantonly gut the program which Candidate Obama rightly called &#8220;the cornerstone of the social compact in this country.&#8221;<br />_________________________<br />(New Deal sent me some updates which I attempted to get inserted correctly. But I&#8217;ll just put this in as his alternative conclusion)<br />That controversy erupted here as well, prompting me to write a diary explaining <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2007/11/26/103428/73">The Truth about Social Security,</a> in which I pointed out that Social Security is not in &#8220;crisis&#8221;, and is not a &#8220;real problem,&#8221;  manageable or not, needs no &#8220;fix,&#8221; nor any intermeddling &#8220;Commission.&#8221;  As stated by the official projections by the Social Security trustees at that time, the program will be solvent without so much as lifting a little finger for decades to come.  At worst, even after the &#8220;Great Recession&#8221;, the problem is several decades away and is hardly an urgent priority.  Even then, the core retirement program is not the issue; rather the deficits come from other programs such as Social Security disability.<br />&#8212;&#8212;<br />Two final notes:<br /> (1) Remember how Candidate Obama constantly proclaimed that an increase in the ceiling for payment of payroll taxes was the only change that Social Security needed?  I searched and searched for any statement by President Barack Obama that that was still his position.  After December 2008 there are no such statements to be found anywhere.<br /> (2) Even if Obama&#8217;s assumptions are correct and his plan restores &#8220;solvency&#8221; to Social Security, <strong>the GOP will not cease their campaign to destroy it.  They will loot it again the next time they are in power. And Barack Obama will have set the precedent for the &#8220;solution&#8221; of further benefit cuts.</strong></p>

                                <p>by Bruce Webb<br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/ShWTahfDs5I/AAAAAAAAAOU/b9o84WPcj7c/s1600-h/OAS+and+DI+long+term+ratios.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/ShWTahfDs5I/AAAAAAAAAOU/b9o84WPcj7c/s400/OAS+and+DI+long+term+ratios.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>This figure shows graphically the outcomes for the OAS (black line) and DI (gray line) under the three alternative scenarios Low Cost (I), Intermediate Cost (II), and High Cost (III) in the 2008 Report. Almost universally reporting on Social Security revolves around Intermediate Cost and if we examine its lines we see the standard reported outcomes, the DI Trust Fund going to depletion in 2023 and OAS in 2041. But that was then, the 2009 Report shortened up the intervals to 2017 and 2037 for Intermediate Cost, and the 2010 Report is certainly going to see DI in a state of near term collapse. Okay Intermediate Cost shows us a program in need of some fixes, immediately for DI, and in the medium term for OAS. Familiar story.</p>
<p>And High Cost tells the same story, only more so.</p>
<p>But Low Cost is different. Under Low Cost Social Security OASI is projected to be fully funded through the 75 year window and even have balances growing faster than costs after 2050 and Trust Fund Ratios never falling below 350. Would this be a good outcome. Well the fully funded part is nice, and a more or less flat tail after 2050 is nice, but a constant TF ratio above 350? Well no that is not a good thing, and the only thing worse would have Low Cost OAS look like Low Cost DI and rocketing through a TF ratio of 1000 on way to 2000. There is a point where the Trust Fund is literally too big for Social Security&#8217;s good. To understand why follow me below the fold.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />What would be the ideal shape and level for this graph. Well in shape it would look like Low Cost OAS, a near term bulge to build the TF to the point that interest on it meets the challenge pending from 2026 to 2050, and then flattening out. But at a lower level. This spreadsheet represents the NW Plan http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=r49_nOHQG4QdHuwcbMGmP0Q The column fourth from the Right is labeled Trust Fund Ratio and if graphed would show a perfect shape, a Trust Fund topping out with a ratio of 375 and then gradually adjusting down to ultimate levels between 123 and 130. But not that the total Trust Fund Balance only goes down during a ten year period and then by not enough to matter, under the NW Plan the principal in the Trust Fund never gets paid back. And that is a good thing.</p>
<p>So when supporters of Social Security claim that the tax increases starting in 1983 were designed to pre-pay Boomer Retirement they are right in spirit but wrong as to detail, in an ideally balance system those dollars are never called on directly. And by that same token it is wrong to say the Trust Fund was designed to run out, because it wasn&#8217;t, instead the expectation was that changes to either revenue or benefits would be made in a way that keeps that tail from dropping below 100. Meaning that the Trust Fund simply serves as a buffer for bad times, as it was between 1972 and real crisis in 1982 and as it is doing today.</p>
<p>But even given that a TF ratio of 100 is a designated minimum why is a flat 130 better than say the flat 400 seen under Low Cost OASI? Well because of the effort needed to keep a TF ratio flat. A flat TF ratio assumes that Benefits are requiring enough resources above FICA and Tax on Benefits to take up enough of Interest so that the TF grows only enough to mirror overall program growth. So if we assume ultimate interest earnings at 4% keeping a TF level steady at 400 reguires that some 12-15% of total program costs be paid by General Fund transfers and this over and above the 12.4% of payroll directly devoted to it. Which sets up three potentially contending groups. First you have beneficiaries who have an equitable claim that the Trust Fund is collectively an earned obligation to retired participants, even though most of the principal was actually contributed by previous generations. Second you have non-participants, particularly those with income from capital, who point out legitimately enough that they are picking up to 15% of program costs and getting nothing for it. In between you have current workers who are in effect paying twice, once in FICA and a second time in income taxes.</p>
<p>In contrast maintaining a TF ratio of 130 requires much less societal strain. Rather than an 85/15 split between payroll tax &#038; tax on benefits/debt service the split is 95/5 where that 5% is simply the cost of recession insurance.</p>
<p>Now some Social Democrats would claim that not only is 85/15 okay but they would take that to 50/50 or even 0/100. Well right on brothers and sisters! But quite apart from genuine philosophical beliefs in the virtues of thrift and self-reliance there are many practical and political strengths to having worker retirement financed by workers supplemented only by a small amount of interest on a reserve fund that prevents every downturn in employment from turning into outright class war. Instead Social Democrats could turn their attention to other societal goals like health care, paid leave, real wage increases, public education all of which directly or indirectly contribute to the general welfare, including that of wage workers.</p>
<p>Personally I would be okay with a ratio as high as 85/15 if that was driven simply by interest on an existing Trust Fund. Because once established a TF ratio of 400 is hard to drive down, the only way to do that is to artificially drive the second term up enough to actually start redeeming principal which in turn forces the whole system more in the direction of subsidized welfare. But levels much above 400 are actively dangerous.</p>
<p>If we return to the graph we see that Low Cost DI shoots up to a TF ratio of 2000 within the 75 year planning period. Under that scenario and at  assumed 5% the Trust Fund would be throwing off interest equal to program costs. This would have the effect of changing a worker financed &#8216;entitlement&#8217; program into a pure welfare program that increasingly would be justified simply on the basis of past contributions by past generations, at some point the concept of this being an earned benefit being totally lost. Now in the particular case of Disability this would not bother me much, I have no problem sticking a big part of the societal bill onto capitalists who may have created the conditions that led to that disability to start with, and besides I think the overall duty of society to aid the helpless is pretty clear to start with. But on purely practical and political grounds I would not like to see OAS going anywhere near the 1000 level, they system loses its insulation.</p>
<p>Which gets me back to my title. Social Security is under current assault under the belief that costs to finance payment of the interest owed are already too high. When pressed those opponents tend to reluctantly admit that they owe the money, it is just that it would societally harmful to do so. While I could and do argue that this is just nonsensical special pleading that the transfers at point of the greatest projected strain are no more than those of wars of choice, in the end the cost of paying down a $5 trillion debt is big while the projected cost a paying down a $2.5 trillion dollar debt is with subsequent interest effects less than half as high. Freezing the Trust Fund at its current levels would eliminate, at least it seems to me, this argument that not repaying the TF is not driven from ill-will but instead from practicality. Not that I believed in the argument to start with, just that I recognize its power. Hence my suggestion of a short term cut in FICA taxes sufficient to freeze the fund combined with a schedule of future increases to stabilize it.</p>
<p>Interestingly it looks like the economy is kind of doing my job for me. Under my formulation a vanishing Social Security surplus is not necessarily a bad thing, though certain that which is driving it, high unemployment, certainly is. Opponents are using this period of short term crisis to make long term changes to Social Security&#8217;s benefit formula, changes which ultimately worsen the situation by swelling the Trust Fund over the medium term. If we can just stave that off Social Security might emerge from this job recession actually better situated to achieve long-term health, freed from the burden of a burgeoning Trust Fund going forward.</p>

<p>AN IMMODEST PROPOSAL</p>
<p>Bruce Webb offered a modest proposal in a recent post to &#8220;fix&#8221; the Social Security &#8220;problem&#8221; by (essentially) cutting the payroll tax a few tenths of a percent to reduce the surplus and thereby reduce the debt by that much money borrowed from and owed TO Social Security.</p>
<p>What is wrong with Bruce&#8217;s proposal is that it takes more intelligence to understand than most people can bring to bear on the question, and would require more honesty from Congress than they have shown in two hundred years.</p>
<p>So here is an alternate proposal more suited to the intelligence and honesty of the times:</p>
<p>RAISE the payroll tax one tenth of one percent this year, and again next year, and the year after.  This would be, from some perspectives, slightly unfair to the workers who pay the tax&#8230; but not a huge amount of money&#8230; and it would increase the national debt.  But it would give congress some extra money to play with to spend on submarines and other things we need to win the war on terror.  And it would put Social Security into long term actuarial solvency beyond any question or doubt.</p>
<p>And that would make the extra cost worthwhile to the workers. They would have their Social Security guaranteed, and that guarantee is worth more than a few bucks a week.</p>
<p>What the Congress would do with the rising debt is anybody&#8217;s question.  But it is not a question that ever troubled them in the past,  when the enemies of Social Security weren&#8217;t using &#8220;the looming crisis in Social Security&#8221; as an argument for killing the workers ability to save for their own retirement.</p>
<p>Oh, the limit of the payroll tax increase proposed here would be a 2% increase for the worker and for his employer.  Phased in over twenty years, it wouldn&#8217;t hurt.  And it really would go to pay for the eventual retirement of the workers paying the tax.  Congress would never have to pay back the money in the trust fund, so that shouldn&#8217;t worry them.  Unless the sight of those phony iou&#8217;s climbing into the stratosphere made them nervous.<br />_________________________<br />by Dale Coberly</p>

                                <p>by Bruce Webb</p>
<p>A quick hit for Super Bowl Sunday.</p>
<p>Certain opponents of Social Security claim their goal is &#8216;sustainable solvency&#8217; which is in practice defined as reducing the flow of funds from the General Fund to Social Security over the long term. In a previous post I pointed out that straight benefit cuts do not have this effect, and rather paradoxically actually serve to increase such obligations over the long term. Which suggests that if we want to do more than shift Public Debt obligations around in time but actually seek to reduce them there is only one short term solution.</p>
<p>Cut FICA taxes. Give workers and their employers a mild tax break.</p>
<p>For example lets say we cut the current FICA tax by 0.2% of payroll and diverted 0.3% of what remained to the Disability Insurance component. The end result would be a 0.5% of payroll cut to OASI and a 0.3% boost to DI. The latter would immediately put DI very, very close to long term actuarial balance while the former would mean slowing the rate of growth of the OAS Trust Fund (which opponents believe is just a unfunded debt obligation and no asset at all). This in turn would reduce the ultimate peak point of Trust Fund balances by limiting total interest that would have accrued to the TF.</p>
<p>Over the short run this increases the needed draw on the General Fund in just the same way that pre-paying your mortgage does. But over the long run it saves the General Fund plenty. And the extra flow could be easily financed by a small wealth tax, or simply by tapping a little of the revenue gained from the expiring tax cuts.</p>
<p>If the Peter G Peterson&#8217;s of this world are REALLY believers in intergenerational equity and keeping debt on our children and grandchildren to a minimum they can do so by cutting taxes paid by workers now and doing an early repayment of the money they have been borrowing. Time for the billionaires to show whether they are seriously concerned about &#8216;fiscal responsibility&#8217; or simple welshers on their debt obligations, time for them to put up or shut up. Show that they are willing to actual share in the shared sacrifice they insist that workers should take.</p>
<p>Cut FICA and give workers a break for once.<br />___________________________________</p>
<p>This is more polemic than serious policy proposal, but it works. It fixes DI and simply brings forward the trigger for the mild increases in OAS that will still be needed a decade plus out. But the overall economic and political strain created by a bigger than necessary Trust Fund would be reduced and workers would get a small but real tax cut in the interim, so really it is kind of a win/win. For everyone but the billionaires. Which is why I don&#8217;t expect it to come to pass.</p>

<p>Well it looks like we are going to get a Deficit Commission and one way or another Social Security will be on the table. But what exactly does that mean for either Social Security or the total deficit picture? Before answering that lets review a couple of basics.</p>
<p>In talking deficit reduction we need to distinguish between &#8216;deficit&#8217; and &#8216;debt&#8217;. A &#8216;deficit&#8217; is basically an accounting convention, it is worthwhile to calculate various gaps between income and cost. But not everything labeled &#8216;income&#8217; actually represents cash extracted from the economy, in particular interest on Intragovernmental Holdings is not in fact financed by such dollars, although it is real as real in the long run, in the immediate term it is simply a bookkeeping entry. Which leads to some really odd results. In order to keep things straight the CBO maintains two different measures for deficits: &#8216;primary deficit&#8217; which measures actual cash flow and &#8216;deficit&#8217; which includes that interest. Now in general newspapers report the deficit and not the primary deficit, when we talk about an Obama $1.6 trillion deficit for FY2010 that figure silently includes interest on the Intragovernmental Holdings as a positive number, whereas a calculation of primary deficit wouldn&#8217;t include it at all.</p>
<p>Turning to &#8216;debt&#8217;. Last week Congress raised the debt ceiling from $12 trillion to close to $15 trillion. But this does not mean Treasury is free to borrow up to $3 trillion in cash prior to going back to Congress, because there are two different components of debt subject to the ceiling. You can check out both the total debt and its two components via a web application maintained by Treasury called <a target="_blank" href="http://www.treasurydirect.gov/NP/BPDLogin?application=np">Debt to the Penny</a> which would tell you that as of Monday &#8216;Debt held by the Public&#8217; was $7.849 trillion while &#8216;Intragovernmental Holdings&#8217; were $4.499 trillion for a total of &#8216;Public Debt&#8217; of $12.349 trillion, which is the number you normally see reported in the newspapers.</p>
<p>Mostly when people talk &#8216;deficit reduction&#8217; they do so not in the context of opening borrowing room in the current year or its effects on interest rates, those those are pretty important things indeed. Instead they tend to think of it in terms of debt reduction or perhaps just a slowing in the growth rate of Public Debt. And one way to accomplish that is to cut spending. Or so you would think, once you start factoring in the curious treatment of interest on Intragovernmental Holdings things start getting strange. Follow me below the fold if you dare.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />More than half of the $4.499 trillion in Intragovernmental Holdings are held by the two Social Security Trust Funds, in fact they have $2.5 trillion in Treasury obligations that score as part of Public Debt. But for the sake of this argument I want to simplify that a little:</p>
<p>Suppose you have a Trust Fund with a balance of $2 trillion in notes earning 5% a year which operates along side a benefits program with its own dedicated revenue stream that either will or will not pay all costs in any give year. Now imagine three different scenarios:</p>
<p>A1: the benefits program self-funds with non-interest income equalling cost<br />B1: the benefits program runs with an operating loss of $100 billion<br />C1: the benefits program runs with an operating surplus of $100 billion<br />What are the subsequent impacts on total Public Debt?</p>
<p>Under A1 there is no call on funds from Treasury nor is there any cash flow to it. But Treasury does have to create $100 billion in the form of new Special Treasuries to credit to the Trust Fund to account for interest. This $100 billion adds to Intragovernmental Holdings which in turn adds to Public Debt for a net increase in that debt of $100 billion.</p>
<p>Under B1 there is a call on $100 billion in funds from Treasury to meet costs. To meet that call Treasury has to borrow (or find revenue, same thing for our purposes) $100 billion in Debt held by the Public. In turn it offsets that by not giving any credit to the Trust Fund for accrued interest, instead &#8216;taking&#8217; it in exchange for that other dept. The end result is that $100 billion is added to Debt held by the Public and so to Public Debt while nothing is added to Intragovernmental Holdings with a net increase in total Public Debt of $100 billion, i.e. the same amount as A1.</p>
<p>Under C1 the operating surplus of $100 billion flows to Treasury and in principle pays down that same amount in Debt Held by the Public (or reduces borrowing by that amount, same thing) which reduces Debt Held by the Public and hence Public Debt by that amount. But under the rules in play Treasury is required to issue $100 billion in Special Treasuries to &#8216;pay&#8217; for that borrowing and another $100 billion in such Treasuries to account for the interest which increases Intragovernmental Holdings and so Public Debt by that amount for a total net increase in total Public Debt of $100 billion. Same as A1 and B1.</p>
<p>So for the specific purpose of calculating Public Debt A1=B1=C1. I suggest this result is pretty damn counter-intuitive but absent some mechanism I am missing that is how the numbers run.</p>
<p>Okay now say in the interest of deficit and debt reduction we cut our benefits program by $100 billion a year while leaving its revenue constant.</p>
<p>A2. The benefits program, previously revenue neutral, now provides a $100 billion cash surplus to Treasury reducing Debt Held by the Public by that amount. In turn Treasury issues $200 billion in Special Treasuries to account for the borrowing and the accrued interest. Net increase in the Public Debt is still $100 billion.<br />B2: The benefits program, previously running at a $100 billion loss, is no revenue neutral with no cash effect on Treasury meaning that Treasury only has to issue a Special Treasury for $100 billion meaning a net increase in Public Debt of $100 billion.<br />B3: The benefits program, previously running a $100 billion surplus now is running a $200 billion one, reducing Debt Held by the Public and hence Public Debt by that same amount. But Treasury has to issue $300 billion in Special Treasuries for a net increase in Public Debt of $100 billion.</p>
<p>Now this is getting kind of spooky, not only does A1=B1=C1 for the purposes of the number on the Debt Clock, they are also precisely equal to A2=B2=C2. That is no matter whether the current system is running cash surpluses, cash deficits or is cash neutral cutting $100 billion in spending doesn&#8217;t move the Debt Clock at all.</p>
<p>Does this mean there is no real world effect? Well of course not, between the six scenarios we have impacts on Debt Held by the Public from up $100 billion to down $200 billion depending on the before and after states, that is real money. But all it really is is a transfer from Social Security beneficiaries to holders of Debt Held by the Public, it is just robbing Grandma so as to make it easier to pay off the Chinese Central Bank.</p>
<p>Making the attempt to attach at least this component of Entitlements Reform to raising the Debt Ceiling kind of a sham. Because for the specific purpose of calculating total Public Debt subject to the limit it is a wash.</p>
<p>Now lets turn to Deficits. Under Unified Budget scoring any surplus to Social Security including accrued interest counts as a positive meaning a $100 billion annual cut in Benefits will yield a $1 trillion ten year score plus any additional interest effects on the Trust Funds which actually would be substantial. Because every $100 billion added to or not subtracted from the Trust Fund will be generating 5% compound interest. But those same interest dollars which score as a positive on a 10 year deficit total actually score as an equal increase in Public Debt. This too is pretty damn counterintuitive, we have the same factor driving deficit and debt in opposite directions.</p>
<p>And just to insert some final confusion what does $100 billion in cost cuts per annum do for our old friend Unfunded Liability. Well it wipes it out, the problem being that it is simply replaced by Public Debt in the form of Special Treasuries even as the dollars used to build that fund were spent long since. Given all this I can&#8217;t see why any worker would support cuts to Social Security, all that does it cut current obligations while replacing them with Public Debt in the future, a debt that we can&#8217;t expect the capitalists of the future to be any more willing to pay back than the capitalists of today. As long as the Social Security Trust Funds are throwing off enough interest dollars to cover the gap between  Income excluding Interest and Cost there is absolutely no reason why workers should simply sacrifice their own interests here. In this scenario all of the benefit simply flows to the bond market. Now theoretically there would be positive impacts on interest rates which might create some indirect benefits for consumers, and if we were experiencing Carter/Reagan double digit interest rates then maybe a case could be made. But under current conditions I just don&#8217;t see it.</p>
<p>Anyway the next time some one comes waving that $12 trillion figure as a reason to cut Social Security be sure to ask him to show his work, in this particular case cutting spending actually serves to increase debt. And weirdly enough so does increasing revenue. Such are the weirdities of Trust Fund accounting.<br />____________________________________________</p>
<p>Final bonus nugget. What would a perfectly balanced Social Security system look like?<br />One it would run a small cash flow deficit, Treasury would be transferring some money to SS each and every year.<br />Two still Social Security would overall score as being in surplus for Unified Budget purposes.<br />Three beyond whatever borrowing was needed for One, Social Security would be adding to Public Debt every year.</p>
<p>Yep a system that is cash flow negative, in permanent surplus AND adding to debt. Perfect! Wrap your head around that for awhile.</p>

<p>The following is the opening of a proposed post by financial blogger Bruce Krasting.<br />
<blockquote>SSTF – My Numbers (by Bruce Krasting)</p>
<p>A week ago I attempted to get a consensus estimate on some of the critical variables of the SSTF puzzle from the readers and contributors at Angry Bear.  I started that effort with what I thought would be the easiest component to estimate; interest rates. That effort failed. It seemed to me that no one reading my thoughts on this cared about interest rates and their impact on the Fund. That is thick headed. They are a central component.</p>
<p>Given that this audience showed no interest in participating in the development of a reasonable set of assumptions, I have used my own. Once assumptions are established and a methodology to use them is created a projection for future annual and monthly results can be established. The actual arithmetic is easy; the hard part is making the assumptions.</p></blockquote>
<p>Krasting&#8217;s full letter and a response thereto will be up on  my web-site shortly (I&#8217;ll update with the link). But as one of the &#8220;thick headed&#8221; ones in question I would like to examine a core assumption here, that interest rates ARE a critical variable. Because they really aren&#8217;t,  not at least over the time period Krasting is using. The following table is derived from Krasting&#8217;s numbers. The last column is his calculation for total surplus/deficit, the interest rates are his as well, making the accrued interest calculation one of simple multiplication. The unlabled column is simple subtraction and represents the net negative cash flow from operations in each of the years needed to offset the interest accruing.<br />Year   TF Bal             Int Rate    Interest                                     Surplus/deficit<br />2010 $2.5 trillion x 4.58% = $114 billion &#8211; $20 billion = $94 billion<br />2011 $2.6 trillion x 4.40% = $114 billion &#8211; $56 billion = $58 billion<br />2012 $2.6 trillion x 4.20% = $109 billion &#8211; $86 billion = $25 billion<br />2013 $2.6 trillion x 4.15% = $108 billion &#8211; $125 billion = -$7.2 billion</p>
<p>Krasting places 2013 at $2.7 trillion but that would not matter much, nor would keeping the interest rate steady at 4.58% instead of having it drift to 4.15%, anyway you slice it you have a TF that WILL throw off some $400 to $450 billion in interest between now and 2013. Under Krasting&#8217;s calculations by 2013 cash losses from operations will eat up not only that entire $110 billion or so in annual interest but enough more to actually start cutting into cash principal. Which is a big claim and one which will be discussed in the later post, but which has nothing to do with interest rates. And changes in interest rates of the order Krasting suggests can only move the number up or down a couple of percent from a median of say $425 billion.</p>
<p>Krasting is making the claim that a variable that can move total accrued interest dollar totals by $5 or 6 billion per year critically explains a projected change that would have total income move by $125 billion per year. That just doesn&#8217;t make any sense.</p>
<p>Interest is indeed a key variable in Social Security finance (though at least one Bear would dispute whether that makes it a critical variable). But what the simple arithmetic above shows changes in the interest RATE are not critical, instead they are quite literally marginal moving total Social Security financials on the order of +/- 1% per year.</p>
<p>Personally I have used 5% as a nominal interest rate in the past, largely because that is quite close to the average rate during the 1995 to 2005 period in which most of the Social Security debate took form (as shown in the following table<br />http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/2009/V_economic.html#205214).  And since that nominal rate came in at 4.8% in 2006 and 4.7% in 2007 felt pretty comfortable continuing to do so. If someone wants to insist on using something closer to 4.5% then fine. Because within the broader context of Social Security a 0.5% change in interest rate over a four year period just doesn&#8217;t move the macro numbers in any important way. Interest is important in the medium term, interest rates are important in the long term, but short term changes in those rates are simply not important at all.</p>
<p>The Angry Bears are often stubborn but rarely thick-headed when it comes to simple multiplication and addition. Of the six columns in the mini-table above the interesting ones are columns five and six and for those calculations the variations in column three literally effect numbers around the margin. They just are not a central component for calculating short term TF balances.</p>
<p>I have a good idea why Krasting thinks they HAVE to be critical, because tiny variations in interest rates are indeed critical in his particular area of finance. But Social Security is not an investment fund, it works on an entirely different principle. It intersects the investment world without actually being part of it, something I suggest Mr. Krasting is himself too thick headed to quite understand.</p>

                                <p>by Bruce Webb<br />(Update-something in this doesn&#8217;t look quite right. The over all argument is right but something is amiss down in the post. Bonus points if you find it before I do.)<br />(Update 2-found it. I think, see strike out and addition below. But there are a lot of numbers in play here.)</p>
<blockquote><p>Blogger/Reader BK: I know what the TF says and I know what the CBO says,and I think they are both wrong. We will top out the  Fund at a much lower number $2.8 T and it will come much sooner than anticipated. </p></blockquote>
<p>To see why this isn&#8217;t so and actually just can&#8217;t be we need to inspect the following table from the 2009 Report <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/2009/IV_SRest.html#271967">Table IV.A3.—Operations of the Combined OASI and DI Trust Funds, Calendar Years 2004-18</a>. The second column from the right shows the Combined Trust Funds projected to go from $2.4 trillion in 2008 to $4.0 trillion in 2018. What would it take to freeze it at $2.8 trillion? Discussion below the fold.<br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/S1mPhp5DLmI/AAAAAAAAAWA/rVZ-yazaRHo/s1600-h/2009+Table+IV.A.3+Operations+09-18.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/S1mPhp5DLmI/AAAAAAAAAWA/rVZ-yazaRHo/s400/2009+Table+IV.A.3+Operations+09-18.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><a name="more"></a><br />Well to freeze the Trust Fund at any given value obviously &#8216;Net Increase in Assets&#8217; for the year has to go to zero. And this can only happen if total &#8216;Cost&#8217; equals total &#8216;Income&#8217;. And this is where our reader goes off the rails.</p>
<p>For Social Security &#8216;Income&#8217; is the sum of &#8216;Contributions&#8217; (payroll tax), &#8216;Tax on Benefits&#8217;, and &#8216;Interest&#8217;, on the other hand &#8216;Cost&#8217; is the sum of &#8216;Benefits&#8217;, &#8216;Admin&#8217;, and RRB Interchange (another kind of benefits). All three cost components and the first two income components are in the form of cash flowing in and out of Treasury and so are a measure of current year cash-flow. The CBO calls this &#8216;primary surplus/deficit&#8217;. On the other hand interest does not come in the form of cash or checks, like the interest on your simple savings account it shows up as a credit, but like that interest payment does shows up on your balance. So in order to calculate &#8216;Increase in assets&#8217; we take &#8216;Primary surplus/deficit&#8217; and add interest which in 2008 gave us an increase in TF balance to $2.4 trillion.</p>
<p>The 2009 Report projected an &#8216;Increase in assets&#8217; of $137 billion for 2009, $138 bn for 2010, and $154 bn for 2011 for a total of $2.9 trillion. What would it take to get that end sum down to $2.8 trillion? Well it would mean that $100 billion in interest that would have been credited as an &#8216;Increase in assets&#8217; had to be go somewhere else and the ONLY place that can be is to offset a larger than expected primary deficit&#8217;. In this case in order to keep the TF Balance from going to $2.9 tn you need an ADDITIONAL $100 plus billion of primary deficit over those three years. Including of course last year.</p>
<p>How did we do last year? BK tried to figure that out from  monthly numbers from SSA. Well Nancy Ortiz and Some Guy explained why that was a bad idea, those spreadsheets are working tools subject to all kinds of variation. On the other hand the Treasury publishes Monthly Trust Fund Reports that are pretty much the final word, at least I have not found in the past any varation between their Dec 31 totals and the year end total printed in the Annual Report (due in the Spring). And luckily for us the December final was published yesterday. Since each Trust Fund is legally separate for Treasury Dept purposes there are two reports each month, one for OASI and one for DI .</p>
<p>The OAS Report ftp://ftp.publicdebt.treas.gov/dfi/tfmb/dfifo1209.pdf shows an ending balance of $2.318 trillion dollars. If we go to Table IV.A1 we see this is up from 2008 year end of $2.203 tn but fell short of anticipated $2.349 tn. And because of the way the math works ALL of that shortfall came on the receipts side. But unless those receipts fall so short that ALL interest has to be tapped to make up the difference then the TF balance will continue to go up.</p>
<p>Now the DI Report ftp://ftp.publicdebt.treas.gov/dfi/tfmb/dfifd1209.pdf shows an ending balance of $199 billion. If we go to Table IV.A2 we see that this is DOWN from $216 billion. On the other hand the DI TF was already projected to decrease to $206 billion, the end result was just $10 billion worse than expected. (Which is to say bad, DI needs fixing now.)</p>
<p>If we add these numbers together we would get a &#8216;Net increase in assets&#8217; for combined OASDI for 2009 of $108 billion to a total of $2.53 tn. And here is the key point our commenter missed in order for the INCREASE to be less, next year has to be WORSE than last year, in order for that increase to be ZERO next year has to be a LOT WORSE. Because not only would results have to be bad enough to gobble up an amount equal to the interest that made up the net increase but also any interest on that interest. In order to keep the Trust Fund to growing to $2.8 trillion we have to project an EXTRA $50 billion in decrease in &#8216;Net Increase&#8217;. Well that might well be, there is nothing implausible about reducing the RATE of growth of the TF balance by having only $225 billion in net increase in 2010 and 2011 instead of projected $275 billion, a year end TF balance of $2.8 trillion or less in 2011 would not at all be surprising.</p>
<p>On the other hand it would not on that account be frozen. Because a $2.8 trillion Trust Fund still throws off a certain amount of interest and in order for that to NOT give you a positive &#8216;Net Increase in Assets&#8217; then primary deficit has to come in at more than the total amount of interest earned that year. Meaning that not only would 2010 and 2011 have to be significantly worse in terms of revenue than 2009 but 2012 would have to be MUCH worse (the effect ultimately damps out).</p>
<p>In order for the Trust Fund to &#8216;top out&#8217; it needs to run systematic cash deficits in excess of $120 billion a year. Forever. Other wise the insidious effects of compound interest continue to work on the balances.</p>
<p>We are in a deep unemployment recession and the resulting decrease in payroll tax receipts has resulted in a decrease in the RATE of increase of Trust Fund Balances, but in order to get that rate to go to zero we would need to have an immediate decrease in payroll contributions of $8 billion plus a MONTH to eat up the roughly $100 billion plus of interest the current TF will earn this year. Which would mean a drop in around $775 billion in total payroll <s>(quick numbers, please check) which is more than triple the total of wages in covered employment. This literally can&#8217;t happen.</s> Yep too quick. The right numbers are found here: http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/2009/VI_OASDHI_dollars.html#133537 which shows taxable payroll right at $5.6 trillion, $775 billion is 14% of that meaning we would need maybe 25% unemployment to eat up that interest income in the short run.</p>
<p>Per the 2009 Report&#8217;s Intermediate Assumption the Combined Trust Funds were projected to peak at $4.3 trillion in 2027 and then descend fairly rapidly to zero in 2037. Under the more pessimistic High Cost Assumption the would peak at $3.4 trillion in 2018 en route to depletion in 2027. (On the other hand High Cost model had unemployment 8.5% for 2009, 9.3% 2010 and average 8% through 2016, and never better than 6.5% after that with Real Wage permanently under 1.0% (in other words a fricking catastrophic perma-recession)). Still there is a case to be made for a TF that tops out in 2018, the Trustees make it,</p>
<p>But there is no set of numbers that would have the Trust Fund top out at $2.8 trillion in the next two years, the momentum of the existing TF balance and the interest it accrues are simply too great to be entirely overcome by a shortfall in tax income over the short run.</p>

                                <p>by Bruce Webb</p>
<p>A bipartisan group of Senators is making a push to tie an increase in the debt ceiling to establishment of a Commission whose focus in on reducing the growth of entitlements. Now clearly Medicare spending growth at its current rate is not sustainable, which fact makes the current full-throated defense of that spending by Republicans fairly ironic, but  something should be done and in fact is being done via the current HCR proposals. But pointing to the Debt Clock is not a good reason to slash away at Medicare or Social Security, because those slashes actually make that Clock run the wrong way by increasing and not decreasing Public Debt.</p>
<p>Why cutting spending increases debt explained under the fold.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />When the Peter G Peterson people claim that Social Security and Medicare are in crisis they tend to use Unfunded Liability over the Infinite Future Horizon as the measure and so produce figures like $105 trillion. Which they then divide by current population to produce a debt per person figure as in every man, woman and child owes $33,000 or whatever. But this is to confuse two very different things. Because at the bound Unfunded Liability and Public Debt move in opposite directions.</p>
<p>In FY 2000, the last full FY of the Clinton Administration, the United States ran a Unified Budget surplus of $235 billion. Hurrah! But the Public Debt Clock showed an increase in debt of $18 billion. Oh noes! Why the disconnect? Because Trust Fund surpluses score as debt for the purpose of total Public Debt. If we go to the Treasury&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.treasurydirect.gov/NP/BPDLogin?application=np">Debt to the Penny</a> web application and insert a starting point of Sept 30, 1999 and an end date of Sept 29, 2000 we see that on the first day of that Fiscal Year Debt held by the Public, which included the Chinese Central Bank was $3.636 trillion. By the final day that was down to $3.405 trillion. This was unequivocal good news, not only did the US open up that much more borrowing room for FY 2001, it also cut $10 billion a year off of projected debt service going forward. But if we shift our eyes two columns to the right we see that total Public Debt went up from $5.656 trillion to $5.674 trillion. And the reason is simple, investing Social Security surpluses in Special Treasuries adds to Intragovernmental Holdings which with Debt Held by the Public makes up Public Debt.</p>
<p>All of which leads to some paradoxical results. Currently Social Security is running a moderate but shrinking cash surplus from excess FICA collections plus tax on benefits. That cash surplus (which CBO calls &#8216;Primary surplus&#8217;) plus the amount of accrued interest makes up the total Social Security Surplus which is then combined with a General Fund surplus/deficit to create a Unified Budget surplus/deficit, making large SS cash surpluses a good thing. On the other hand each of those dollars gets converted to an interest earning Treasury so adding a dollar to total Public Debt plus some 3-5% compounded interest so ticking the Debt Clock up. Under current revenue and spending models the Primary Surplus is set to dwindle and then disappear in 2017 at which point the Trust Fund would have to start taking a portion of its accrued interest in cash rather than Special Treasuries and so causing the rate of increase in Public Debt due to Social Security to slow down. Some six years later those same projections show that paying full scheduled benefits will require all accrued interest which so caps the Trust Fund balance and so the maximum amount of Public Debt due to Social Security. In succeeding years this draw down extends to TF principal and so starts reducing Public Debt until sometime after 2039 the Trust Fund is exhausted and no longer contributing to Public Debt at all.</p>
<p>But what happens if we convene an Entitlements Commission and simply adjusted the scheduled benefit so that current year tax revenues met current year outlays? Well two things. One unfunded liability goes to zero. Two Public Debt skyrockets at whatever rate the compounded interest mounts up. So when Senators point to the Debt Clock and proclaim that $12 trillion in Public Debt is a reason to cut Social Security they are wittingly or not confusing Unfunded Liability and Public Debt which for Social Security move in opposite directions.</p>
<p>There are reasons to fix Social Security by putting it on a glide path to Long Term Actuarial Balance, which is to say a system whose overall financing pays 100% of whatever scheduled benefits may be while maintaining a minimum of 1 year in projected reserves in each of the next 75 years, and in principle this could be done with minor tweaks on either the revenue or benefit side. Coberly has long proposed fixing it on the revenue side and so ran the numbers for what we call the Northwest Plan http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=r49_nOHQG4QdHuwcbMGmP0Q, I following Professor Rosser have been willing to entertain the risk of small benefit cuts because we believe that the current economic model of Intermediate Cost is too pessimistic, but either way the argument doesn&#8217;t turn on specific figures on the Debt Clock which for the purposes of this discussion are irrelevant.</p>
<p>Under the Northwest Plan the Social Security Trust Funds will have a combined balance of $33 trillion in 2085 which will score as such on the Debt Clock. And servicing the Trust Funds will require some transfers from the General Fund to keep that balance from compounding out of control, a transfer that will grow every year, but on balance by a more or less steady share of national income growth. Leaving Social Security with an Unfunded Liability of $0.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if every Senator pushing for an Entitlements Commission understands that at the bound Public Debt and Unfunded Liability move in opposite directions, that solutions aimed at the latter actually potentially exacerbate the former but certainly you would expect that a former Comptroller General of the United States would understand the budgeting mechanism. For him to point at the Debt Clock as a reason to move on Social Security is just special pleading and playing games with with incommensurate numbers. What we have is two big numbers that in different ways represent some sort of forwarded shifted liability. Which doesn&#8217;t mean we can wander from one to the other at will.<br />___________________<br />BTW the same argument holds to a limited degree for Medicare Part A (though not B &#038; D). Any act which extends the life of the HI Trust Fund equally serves to increase Public Debt relative to the baseline over that period. Kind of a &#8220;No good deed goes unpunished&#8221; deal.</p>

<div>In the course of an exchange between me and a fellow Bear, the question arose if social spending had a crowding out effect on other social spending. In particular if we have a small problem in Social Security and a big problem in providing health care would solving the first problem put the solution of the second in danger. I say probably yes, he suggests the answer is no because we get no such effect in military spending. Well feel free to weigh in on this in comments, but my reason for arguing the opposite was summed up by Maj. General Smedley Butler in 1933. <br />

<h2>Smedley Butler on Interventionism</h2>
<p><i>&#8212; Excerpt from a speech delivered in 1933, by Major General Smedley Butler, USMC.</i><br />
<blockquote>War is just a racket. A racket is best described, I believe, as something that is not what it seems to the majority of people. Only a small inside group knows what it is about. It is conducted for the benefit of the very few at the expense of the masses.<br />I believe in adequate defense at the coastline and nothing else. If a nation comes over here to fight, then we&#8217;ll fight. The trouble with America is that when the dollar only earns 6 percent over here, then it gets restless and goes overseas to get 100 percent. Then the flag follows the dollar and the soldiers follow the flag.<br />I wouldn&#8217;t go to war again as I have done to protect some lousy investment of the bankers. There are only two things we should fight for. One is the defense of our homes and the other is the Bill of Rights. War for any other reason is simply a racket.<br />There isn&#8217;t a trick in the racketeering bag that the military gang is blind to. It has its &#8220;finger men&#8221; to point out enemies, its &#8220;muscle men&#8221; to destroy enemies, its &#8220;brain men&#8221; to plan war preparations, and a &#8220;Big Boss&#8221; Super-Nationalistic-Capitalism.<br />It may seem odd for me, a military man to adopt such a comparison. Truthfulness compels me to. I spent thirty- three years and four months in active military service as a member of this country&#8217;s most agile military force, the Marine Corps. I served in all commissioned ranks from Second Lieutenant to Major-General. And during that period, I spent most of my time being a high class muscle- man for Big Business, for Wall Street and for the Bankers. In short, I was a racketeer, a gangster for capitalism.<br />I suspected I was just part of a racket at the time. Now I am sure of it. Like all the members of the military profession, I never had a thought of my own until I left the service. My mental faculties remained in suspended animation while I obeyed the orders of higher-ups. This is typical with everyone in the military service.<br />I helped make Mexico, especially Tampico, safe for American oil interests in 1914. I helped make Haiti and Cuba a decent place for the National City Bank boys to collect revenues in. I helped in the raping of half a dozen Central American republics for the benefits of Wall Street. The record of racketeering is long. I helped purify Nicaragua for the international banking house of Brown Brothers in 1909-1912 (where have I heard that name before?). I brought light to the Dominican Republic for American sugar interests in 1916. In China I helped to see to it that Standard Oil went its way unmolested.<br />During those years, I had, as the boys in the back room would say, a swell racket. Looking back on it, I feel that I could have given Al Capone a few hints. The best he could do was to operate his racket in three districts. I operated on three continents.</p></blockquote>
<p>The first question you should ask in any economic issue: &#8216;Cui bono&#8217;.</p>

<div>News that the Republicans are pushing two bills that would establish a &#8216;Bi-Partisan Commission&#8217; to &#8216;reform&#8217; Social Security and Medicare are stirring up a debate which mostly had run cold. And one myth is bubbling back to the surface, the one that claims that Reagan simply used the Greenspan Commission to generate &#8220;huge surpluses&#8221; for Social Security to fund tax cuts for the wealthy. Never happened. There were no huge Social Security surpluses under either Reagan or Bush I, instead the 1983 reform set in place a mechanism that would slowly rebuild the Trust Funds back to their mandated level. And it worked, in 1993 Clinton entered office with Social Security sitting with a Trust Fund ratio of just over 100 meaning that it met the Trustees&#8217; test for actuarial balance. But the overall outlook for Social Security actually deteriorated from 1993 to 1996 and the large surpluses that started in 1997 and accelerated through 2004 were neither planned for or anticipated by the 1981-83 Commission. They happened and on paper largely pre-funded Boomer retirement but this was not the product of any pre-existing plan. Inspect the numbers for yourselves.</div>
<div>http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/2009/VI_cyoper_history.html#159726</div>
<div></div>
<div>This myth is particularly dangerous because it plays into the movement conservative message that you can NEVER trust big government, maybe ESPECIALLY when it is in Republican hands. Every second spent bashing Reagan or Bush II over Social Security is a second devoted to selling the message that &#8216;Big Government is the Problem&#8217;. Yes for those of us who are accused of being infected with BDS or delight in mocking St. Ronnie all of this is good fun. But it is unproductive good fun if your intent is to keep Social Security out of the hands of the vultures. Reagan in 1981 and Bush in 2001 and 2005 DID try to kill Social Security. They failed, every penny is STILL exactly where it is supposed to be. Insisting that they some how succeeded in raiding the pantry just plays into opposition hands. Knock it off. If that is you want that retirement check.</div>
