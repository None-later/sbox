                                <p><a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2009/05/nw-plan-for-real-social-security-fix.html">The Northwest Plan for a Real Social Security Fix</a> was first introduced and revised in 2009. Obviously it was never adopted. Still the basic mechanism remains the same as does the rationale and working assumptions and in what follows I am going to assume a certain knowledge of the mechanics of Social Security finance and reporting. For those who get lost I can only suggest revisiting the 2009 version and all the posts surrounding it or just place your questions in comments.</p>
<p> The NW Plan can be described in a variety of ways but here I want to present it as the answer to a question: &#8220;Under the Social Security Trustees Intermediate Cost Alternative and given current law Scheduled Benefits and Cap Formula what would be the minimally disruptive revenue only fix to deliver those benefits with no changes in retirement age?&#8221;  Note the questions that are not being addressed: &#8220;Is Intermediate Cost a realistic mid-point projection?&#8221; &#8220;Are current Scheduled Benefits adequate? too generous? equitable?&#8221; &#8220;Why NOT adjust the Cap Formula?&#8221; While these are all important questions and ones the authors of the NW Plan have plenty of opinions on, they just are not the question at hand.</p>
<p>For the purposes of establishing a baseline for further discussion the NW Plan simply assumes IC and current law benefit and cap formulae, and also adopts the Trustees tests for &#8216;adequacy&#8217; &#8216;solvency&#8217; and &#8216;actuarial balance&#8217;.  For the Trustees Social Security is in actuarial balance if it is projected under IC assumptions to end each year of the short term window and the last year of the long term window with an asset reserve equal to 100% or more of the next year&#8217;s projected cost. The short term window is 10 years and so coincides with the standard budget window used by CBO and OMB. Which in turn means that anytime Social Security is in &#8216;short term actuarial balance&#8217; it properly has no NECESSARY role in budget talks. This BTW is doubly true if all proposed &#8216;fixes&#8217; start operating outside that window.</p>
<p> On the other hand the Trustees also take a longer view. Under their definition a &#8216;current participant&#8217; in Social Security is anyone 15 and older and their long term window is 75 years. Meaning long enough that anyone who could reasonably be contributing today has their retirement interests taken into consideration for the entire working and retirement lives of all but the longest lived of todays teenagers. Who of course are for older workers their grandchildren.  The NW Plan provides for ALL those cohorts. Details below.<br /><a name="more"></a>The NW Plan starts by examining the following <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/oact/tr/2012/VI_F3_OASDHI_dollars.html#208671">Table VI.F8.—Operations of the Combined OASI and DI Trust Funds, in Current Dollars, Calendar Years 2012-90 </a> and fixing the point at which combined OASDI projects to fail the Short Term Test. By interpolation TF Assets will fall below Total Cost around 2027. But since the Test covers all years to then Year Ten test FAILURE projects to occur in 2018 and the NW Plan adopts the former year as the action point. This even though the combination of revenues and reserves in 2018 would still be sufficient to pay full scheduled benefits for 15 more years. Because that would be small comfort for the over 40s among us.</p>
<p> The NW Plan takes this 2018 failure point and calculates a series of 0.1% FICA increases that would under IC assumptions keep 2027 and immediately following years in actuarial balance (Trust Fund ratios in excess of 100). And for good measure does the same for the entire long term window. Not because we have any real confidence in numbers outside the short to medium term but because once engaged on the exercise of addressing Short Term it is trivial to suggest numbers to address the largely theoretical gaps of the Long Term. One just has to take the numbers supplied by the Reports and mechanically insert some FICA rate changes.</p>
<p> In short the NW Plan imposes a permanent (actually 75 year) fix given best available information in the Plan year. On the other hand that best available information changes with each Report year. But here is the key, by accepting a diagnostic that places &#8216;failure&#8217; 13-15 years in advance of the real world consequences and starts the fix at the earlier date almost any conceivable change in outlook can be addressed by tweaking the FICA numbers at the tail, in almost all conceivable circumstances you have that 10-13 year lead time and an existing fix that at worst addresses the vast majority of the new projected gap. Which in most cases will not have actual incidence until 30 or 40 years down the road.  In posts to come I will be putting up results of the new NW Plan spreadsheet based on the 2012 Report (the latest available). This post on the other hand is designed to let some of the conceptual objections be aired before diving into the actual numbers and assumptions.</p>

He claims vindication of claims from four years ago that the Trust Funds would top out at a much lower level than then estimated. And there is some support to be had here. Also lots of numbers and data points. I&#8217;ll have my say in comments, over to you all.</p>

<p>DEAR PAUL KRUGMAN<br />Please Read This <br />about Social Security</p>
<p>Dear Paul Krugman,</p>
<p>There was an indication the other day that you read Angry Bear, at least sometimes. I hope you read this, because it is important, and you have a better forum than I have.</p>
<p>I think the following facts would be game changers in the so-called &#8220;debate&#8221; about Social Security, if they become widely known and understood.</p>
<p>Social Security has nothing to do with the deficit&#8230; <br />In spite of tortured logic like that of Chuck Blahous who admitted grudgingly that &#8220;technically&#8221; Social Security does not affect the budget, but &#8220;in reality&#8221; if Congress has to pay back the money it has borrowed from Social Security, that will have an effect on the budget. This amounts to blaming granny for lending me her life savings. After all, if she hadn&#8217;t lent it to me I wouldn&#8217;t have spent it. Therefore it&#8217;s her fault that I have to get a job or borrow money from someone else to pay her back.</p>
<p>&#8230; and therefore should not be part of the &#8220;deficit reduction&#8221; hysteria.<br />Again, in spite of logic so tortured it gives lies a bad name: The serious folks who are so very worried about the deficit sometimes admit that Social Security has nothing to do with the deficit, &#8220;but we need to cut Social Security to give confidence to the markets.” Because even though Social Security has nothing to do with the deficit, cutting it will show &#8220;the market&#8221; that we are serious about controlling our deficit.</p>
<p>Social Security is not going broke.<br />It can&#8217;t go broke. It is paid for by the workers who will get the benefits. As long as they understand the value of protecting part of their savings from inflation and market losses&#8230; insuring at least a minimally decent retirement&#8230; they will want to be allowed to continue to pay for their Social Security.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>The Trust Fund is NOT Social Security. It does not matter at all when it &#8220;runs out.&#8221;<br />The Trust Fund is normally a reserve of one year&#8217;s benefits designed to smooth the ebbs and flows of taxes versus benefits. It was allowed to grow following the 1983 increase in the payroll tax to about three times the normal size in order to allow the Boomers to help pay in advance for their own Social Security benefits beyond what would normally be paid by &#8220;pay as you go&#8221; financing. This corrected a potential &#8220;generational inequity.&#8221; This enlarged Trust Fund was always supposed to run out of money about the time the Boomer cohort no longer put unusual stress on the pay as you go system. So far it is on schedule to do exactly that. The precise date that the Trust Fund returns to the normal level is completely unimportant to Social Security.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Eight Trillion Dollar Actuarial Deficit&#8221; can be paid for by raising the payroll tax eighty cents per week each year.<br />This is a fact that can be established with certainty with real arithmetic (real arithmetic is not the “it&#8217;s just arithmetic” you hear about from journalists and congressmen who have no idea what they are talking about). Raising the payroll tax one half of one tenth of one percent per year&#8230; about forty cents per week in today&#8217;s terms &#8230; would entirely close the projected actuarial deficit over the 75 year actuarial window. Wages are projected by the same Trustees Report to rise about eight dollars per week each year over the same time period. So at the end of the day the workers will have twice as much money in their pockets AFTER paying for their Social Security, plus they will have guaranteed their own retirement at the normal retirement age with the present replacement rate&#8230; an amount that will also be twice in real value what today&#8217;s retirees get. Because of the recent recession, it would be better to raise the tax eighty cents per week each year over the next twenty years instead of at the slower rate. Eighty cents per week would still not be felt by the workers.<br />Social Security was designed&#8230;insisted upon by Roosevelt&#8230;to be worker paid: &#8220;So that no damn politician can take it away from them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Roosevelt did not count on the persistence of damn politicians, or the bad memories of workers, or the failure of the &#8220;defenders of Social Security&#8221; to honestly inform the workers. The workers will be glad to pay that eighty cents once they know about it, and understand it. The &#8220;defenders&#8221; of Social Security play into the hands of its enemies by calling for schemes to &#8220;make the rich pay for it.&#8221; Roosevelt knew that would be the death of Social Security. The rich will not pay for it. Or if they did, they would own it, and it would not be long before they would insist upon cutting it, turning it into welfare, and means testing it. And the workers would no longer be able to say&#8230; as they do now&#8230; “we paid for it ourselves.”</p>
<p>The &#8220;bi-partisan groups worried about the deficit&#8221;&#8230; which means folks paid by Peter Peterson to destroy Social Security by pretending Social Security is causing the deficit&#8230; tell very carefully crafted lies about Social Security. The people who style themselves defenders of Social Security waste their time deconstructing the little lies, while the Big Lie goes unanswered. One of those people apparently believes that &#8220;doing nothing&#8221; is the answer. He seems to believe that something will turn up that will extend the life of the Trust Fund and silence the calls for &#8220;fixing&#8221; Social Security. He could be right&#8230; the best &#8220;fix&#8221; for Social Security would be to raise the wages of workers. But this is not something we can realistically expect to accomplish in any reasonable time. And the Big Liars are not going to wait. Unless we can offer a realistic plan, that people can understand, to pay for the projected Social Security actuarial deficit, the Big Liars will push forward their &#8220;fixes&#8221; that are designed to destroy Social Security.</p>
<p>The Big Lie is that &#8220;Social Security is going broke, causing huge deficits that will burden our children.&#8221;</p>
<p>Social Security is not going broke. It has nothing to do with the deficit. The workers pay for it themselves. They can always pay for it themselves. If the costs of retirement rise as they are expected to, the cost of Social Security will rise&#8230;. about eighty cents per week per year. This is not a burden on the young. It is money they will get back with interest when they need it most. It is in fact the best deal that workers have ever had.</p>
<p>Tell the people.</p>

<blockquote><p>Mrs. Rustbelt, the sweet young lady I married, decided to investigate future benefits from Social Security, even though she is only &#8220;39.&#8221; I am her designated data entry clerk, so we sit down and establish an account and log-in for her. Near the end of the set-up process the software tells us she has to answer some multiple choice questions about her personal data. Ok.<br />I was stunned when the questions popped up. None of them had anything to do with Social Security, and were clearly mined from IRS and credit bureau data.  She had been profiled by SSA with data the SSA had no need to know. Anyone have any experience or insights on this?</p></blockquote>
<p>Rusty sent this note my way, so I thought Nancy Ortiz, a retired employee at SSA and expert in its workings,could provide some beginning answers in two e-mails slightly edited for readability:</p>
<p>From what I have read on the &#8220;Social Security News&#8221; blog, SSA recently set up an online benefit estimate program combining earnings information SSA routinely gets from IRS (from SF-941 payroll tax forms) and information gathered by <i>Experian, </i>one of the private big three credit rating companies. I&#8217;m not happy that the current SSA Commissioner has done this. SSA has never before used privately gathered information from any source. The deal is that the SS Act authorizes SSA to gather specific information for &#8220;program purposes only.&#8221; SSA shouldn&#8217;t gather or transmit to others any information it has without specific written authorization to do so (under the Privacy Act.) BUT, this administration or the previous one could have asked Congresss for a change in the law to permit this practice. It would almost certainly slip under the radar, as it did for me until I read about it on &#8220;SS News.&#8221;</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>I do not know whether this has passed muster as a regulatory change or actually refects a change in the law. So I&#8217;ll look around to see what other information I can come up with. In the past, Republican administrations have sought to sell SSA&#8217;s data to private industry without success. The problem with the current administration is that it is quite casual about who is running the shop over in Baltimore. So, until his term recently ended, the Commish was a Bush administration appointee who favored privatization. Alas, Obama&#8217;s people don&#8217;t really seem to care very much about things like this. SSA/SS just aren&#8217;t sexy enough to attract much interest. </p>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t find a recent article on SS News even though I remember one. The website doesn&#8217;t have a search function, so I couldn&#8217;t get anywhere on that site. However, the SSA site&#8217;s explanation is detailed. Unfortunately, it is not very encouraging to someone like me who opposes the use of any data from outside organizations without express authorization from the claimant/online user.</p>
<p>I would need more information in order to form a more complete view of any potential security risks to the online user and SSA itself. However, in general I think that SSA already has enough information on its own internal data bases to verify the identity of the online user. SSA says that Experian doesn&#8217;t keep any of the information the online user provides. SSA also denies it keeps any information used in the online estimate request. But, information floats around for a while inside and possibly outside of SSA. This is a risk I wouldn&#8217;t take were I running this project. The mere fact that Experian is a commercial enterprise which has every reason to retain or reuse information argues against it.</p>

                                <p>Reader mmcosker sends this e-mail pointing to <i>Why Social Security Can’t go Bankrupt: Rerun</i> at Forbe&#8217;s Magazine:</p>
<p>John T. Harvey&#8217;s Pragmatic Economics column at Forbes is one of the best. He is a Professor of Economics at Texas Christian University, and has a knack for breaking down politically charged &#8220;third rail&#8221; economic topics into terms that most anyone can understand. Below is just such a topic that deals with the myth that Social Security is broke &#8211; or even broken. Not entirely sure how widely read John is, as this article has 910 views.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why Social Security Can’t go Bankrupt: Rerun&#8221;</p>
<p><i>It is a logical impossibility for Social Security to go bankrupt. We can voluntarily choose to suspend or eliminate the program, but it could never fail because it “ran out of money.” This belief is the result of a common error: conceptualizing Social Security from the micro (individual) rather than the macro (economy-wide) perspective. It’s not a pension fund into which you put your money when you are young and from which you draw when you are old. It’s an immediate transfer from workers today to retirees today. That’s what it has always been and that’s what it has to be–there is no other possible way for it to work.</i></p>

<p> CBO: SS Scheduled vs Payable Benefits (Rosser&#8217;s Equation illustrated)</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-9bLHAYFroVQ/UN_ZjJm-YwI/AAAAAAAAAGc/2k_zd3cc_5c/s1600/2012+CBO+Ex+9+(Rosser's+Equation).tiff"><img border="0" height="228" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-9bLHAYFroVQ/UN_ZjJm-YwI/AAAAAAAAAGc/2k_zd3cc_5c/s1600/2012+CBO+Ex+9+(Rosser's+Equation).tiff" width="320"></a></p>
<p>&#8216;Rosser&#8217;s Equation&#8217; is something between an in-joke and tribute to Prof. Barkley Rosser, Jr of JMU, an economist friend of mine who pointed out a surprising result: real payable benefits after projected Trust Fund depletion and subsequent 25% cut will still be higher in actual basket of goods terms than those of current retirees. This is because the scheduled benefit formula delivers something like 160% of the current benefit and as Prof Rosser pointed out to me long ago 75% of 160%=120%.   </p>
<p>The above Exhibit 9 from CBO&#8217;s 2012 Long Term Projections for Social Security resolves Rosser&#8217;s equation for selected demographic cohorts and income quintiles. And the results show that the retiree born in 1947 who reached FRA (Full Retirement Age) in 2012 would see an initial benefit ranging from $10k to $25k and representing 100% of the schedule. On the other hand the retiree born in 1970 and who will reach FRA at age 67 in 2037, that is after TF Depletion would see initial benefits in 2012 dollars ranging from $12k to $33k.    </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Now there is no doubt that an overnight 25% cut in benefits at Trust Fund Depletion would represent huge sticker shock for then retirees. And there are very good reasons based in societal equity for scheduled benefits to rise at the real rate the formula delivers. As such we should make every effort to find ways of closing the gap between payable and scheduled from the bottom up rather than forcing scheduled down simply to avoid the shock of of cut. Because the risk is that the &#8216;cure&#8217; might deliver a worse result in real terms than the &#8216;crisis&#8217; left unaddressed.    </p>
<p>Which is why I have been maintaining for years that &#8216;Nothing&#8217; IS a Plan. Not as good a plan as it was when Prof Rosser and I started corresponding five plus years ago, circumstances have changed. Still it represents the &#8220;First Do No Harm&#8221; alternative, after all a check in 2040 20% better in real terms than an equivalently situated retiree gets today doesn&#8217;t exactly meet the definition of existential crisis for Social Security. </p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>On January 1, Congress approved a tax and spending bill to avert the  so-called &#8220;fiscal cliff&#8221; combination of tax hikes and spending cuts that  would have created deflationary pressure on the United States (though <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2012/12/31/fiscal_cliff_recession_would_it_really_happen.html">Yglesias questioned</a>  the conventional wisdom of whether it would necessarily cause a  recession). Let&#8217;s take a look at the deal in some detail, then proceed  to the gruesome details of what will happen around the Ides of March.</p>
<p>From <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2013/01/02/1384291/the-fiscal-cliff-deal-by-the-numbers/">Think Progress</a>, here are some of the more critical parts of the deal.</p>
<p>1)  The Bush tax cuts expire on only about 0.7% of households, those  earning more than $400,000 per year as an individual or $450,000 for a  couple. This brings in $600 billion over 10 years. Since rich people  don&#8217;t spend as much of their income as the poor and middle class do,  this is less deflationary than a tax increase on the middle class, <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/11/what-fiscal-cliff-means-for-middle-class.html">as I discussed</a> in November.</p>
<p>2)  With the expiration of the temporary 2% payroll tax cut, 77% of  households will see their taxes go up. Indeed, every single income group  will, on average, see their taxes increase, as shown below (via <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2013/01/02/credit_suisse_fiscal_cliff_deal_leaves_income_lower_for_everyone_especially.html">Matt Yglesias</a>): </p>
<div><img alt="1357144024996" src="http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/moneybox/2013/01/02/credit_suisse_fiscal_cliff_deal_leaves_income_lower_for_everyone_especially/1357144024996.jpg.CROP.article568-large.jpg" title="1357144024996" width="568"></div>
<p>Since this hits the middle class more directly,  the deflationary consequences are larger than they would be for an  increase in taxes on the rich. On the other hand, this strengthens the  long-run funding of Social Security, an issue I will return to shortly.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>3)  Unemployment insurance is extended for two million workers. This will  get spent and have a definitive stimulative effect on the economy.</p>
<p>However,  the second shoe of the fiscal cliff, the automatic cutbacks known as  the &#8220;sequester&#8221; was simply postponed for two months, which is the same  time that the Treasury Department will run out of creative ways to keep  the country from exceeding the debt ceiling, <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2012/12/31/news/economy/debt-ceiling/index.html">which it hit</a> on December 31.</p>
<p>Combining  these two negotiations, the debt ceiling and the sequester, will be an  extremely high-stakes battle where the middle class has a lot to lose.  The big problem here is that some Tea Party Republicans really do want  to use the debt ceiling to take the economy hostage and force cutbacks  in Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. Despite the fact that  Republicans lost the Presidency as well as both Senate and House seats  (with a majority of the votes cast for the House going to Democrats),  they see their <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2012/11/07/1159631/americans-voted-for-a-democratic-house-gerrymandering-the-supreme-court-gave-them-speaker-boehner/?mobile=nc">gerrymandered House majority</a> as giving them license to wreak havoc.</p>
<p>The consensus among most commentators (<a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/01/perspective-on-the-deal/">Krugman</a>, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/01/02/calm-down-liberals-the-white-house-got-a-good-deal-on-the-fiscal-cliff/">Klein</a>, and <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2013/01/02/white_house_lost_and_liberals_should_be_happy.html">Yglesias</a>,  for example) is that the fiscal cliff deal will work out okay as long  as the President does not cave in to the Republicans&#8217; threats over the  debt ceiling.  I agree as far as that goes. But, as Yglesias points out,  there is nothing great about what Klein says is the most likely  scenario, where the President gets $1 trillion in new tax revenue for $1  trillion in cuts over 10 years. That is still $2 trillion in austerity  measures at a time when unemployment is barely below 8%!</p>
<p>The  looming problem rarely mentioned, even in the context of the Republican  campaign against Social Security, is that my children&#8217;s generation (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_X">Generation X</a>,  if you will) faces a retirement crisis that many of my generation will  avoid, based on the end of pension plans. According to one <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/ssb/v69n3/v69n3p1.html">Social Security Administration report,</a>  the percentage of private-sector workers with a traditional  defined-benefit pension plan fell from 38% in 1980 to 20% in 2008. Over  the same period, private-sector workers who only received defined  contribution plans rose from 8% to 31%. Note that this means that 49% of  private-sector workers are not covered by any pension plan at all.  Moreover, while governments have more commonly provided defined-benefit  plans than private employers have, they are under attack in many states.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s  do the math. With 49% of private workers having no pension, and another  31% having an on-average less generous defined contribution pension,  how will seniors support themselves if Social Security is cut? Hint: It  won&#8217;t be pretty.</p>
<p>Get ready for a bumpy March.</p>

<p><a href="http://socialsecuritydefender.blogspot.com/2012/12/scheduled-vs-payable-benefits-three.html">Scheduled vs Payable Benefits: three definitions of Solvency</a></p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-RG1R_IqWysg/UOEZDIweP8I/AAAAAAAAAGs/zNlEhN2VAmI/s1600/CBO+2012+SS-Scheduled+vs+Payable.tiff"><img border="0" height="180" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-RG1R_IqWysg/UOEZDIweP8I/AAAAAAAAAGs/zNlEhN2VAmI/s1600/CBO+2012+SS-Scheduled+vs+Payable.tiff" width="320"></a><br />As usual click to embiggen.   </p>
<p>When it comes to Social Security there are three definitions of &#8216;Solvency&#8217;, one used by the &#8216;Actuary&#8217; another by the &#8216;Defender&#8217; and the third by the &#8216;Reformer&#8217;. And it is this difference that lays at the heart of the policy disagreements on how to achieve it. Something ostensibly all three seek.    </p>
<p>For the &#8216;Actuary&#8217; &#8216;Solvency&#8217; is mostly a value free concept. Social Security is solvent when all income from all sources equals all costs leaving Trust Fund assets equalling 100% of the next years projected cost. This is known as having a &#8216;Trust Fund Ratio&#8217; of 100. If the Trust Funds are projected to be solvent for the upcoming 10 year window Social Security is judged to be in &#8216;Short Term Actuarial Balance&#8217;. If the Trust Funds are projected to maintain that solvency, or at least end up with it without going into the hole over a 75 year period it is judged to be in &#8216;Long Term Actuarial Balance&#8217;. And since 2003 the Trustees added an additional measure of solvency measured over the &#8216;Infinite Future Horizon&#8217;.    </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Under current law Social Security has a &#8216;scheduled benefit&#8217; which is the arithmetic result of a formula calculated ultimately on the course of Real Wage increases over the worker&#8217;s lifetime. It also has a &#8216;payable benefit&#8217; based on a formula that is calculated by a combination of Real Wage setting the initial benefit, inflation setting the continuing benefit, and total wages driving the income. The details are not important for the present purpose, suffice it to say that &#8216;scheduled benefit&#8217; is the measure of Cost while &#8216;payable benefit&#8217; is the measure of Income minus Cost. And as such &#8216;involvency&#8217; represents that point here Cost exceeds Income to the extent that Trust Fund assets are driven below a TF Ratio of 100. Or in an alternative formulation when those assets are driven to zero. At which time we have a scenario as depicted in the above figure: a sudden reset of payable benefits from the schedule (where they were topped off by asset redemptions) to the new payable equal to then current income from taxation.    </p>
<p>In percentage terms that sudden reset amounts to right on 25% of then current scheduled benefits and it is that discontinuity that defines &#8216;solvency crisis&#8217;. But here is where &#8216;defenders&#8217; and &#8216;reformers&#8217; depart.    <br />For Social Security Defenders the crisis is one of a cut in benefits and the solution is putting in place policy that would maintain the scheduled benefit. For Social Security &#8216;reformers&#8217; the crisis is more political, the risk that a reset in benefits from &#8216;scheduled&#8217; to &#8216;payable&#8217; will result in demands that the schedule be maintained via transfers from outside the dedicated income stream of FICA and tax on benefits. As a result the proposed solutions to this same &#8216;solvency crisis&#8217; via benefit reset are diametrically opposed with defenders advocating measures to maintain current scheduled benefits while reformers see their task as reconciling future retirees to accepting then payable.    </p>
<p>The key here, and the stopping point for this post is that either the prescription of the defender in saving scheduled or the reformer in reconciling retirees with payable will, if accomplished by appropriate changes in current law, satisfy the actuary&#8217;s test for solvency. As will outcomes in between. From a purely technocratic standpoint any set of policies that has scheduled and payable share the same ultimate projected line with no discontinuity meets the &#8216;solvency&#8217; test. Meaning that each has &#8216;fixed&#8217; Social Security by &#8216;preserving&#8217; benefits in a &#8216;sustainable&#8217; fashion. Without at any point addressing the question of whether the resulting benefits actually meet any standard of societal inequity.    </p>
<p>Are cuts to scheduled actually the &#8216;Road to Catfood&#8217; or a &#8216;Concession to Reality&#8217;? Well interestingly neither question has anything to do which the metric of &#8216;Solvency&#8217;. The question, while of course of the utmost importance in real terms, is somewhat orthogonal to discussions revolving around &#8216;actuarial balance&#8217;. Because from the latter perspective the &#8216;crisis&#8217; IS the &#8216;discontinuity&#8217; and not the real world implications thereof.</p>
<p>And a &#8216;fix&#8217; is a &#8216;fix&#8217;.</p>

</p>
<blockquote><p>The House has signaled that it isn&#8217;t going to play ball today</p></blockquote>
<p>And I am no longer the only economist noting that the House&#8211;not for the first time&#8211;is forcing the Administration to do what it should have been ready to do all along.  In fact, Brad DeLong <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2012/12/tim-noah-kill-this-pre-2013-deal.html">cites Tim Noah</a>,* <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2012/12/scott-lemiuex-jonathan-chait-and-tim-noah-say-over-the-fiscal-cliff-we-should-go.html">Scott Lemieux and Jon Chait</a>(!), <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2012/12/and-ezra-klein-says-that-republicans-think-this-is-a-good-and-senate-democrats-think-this-is-a-bad-deal.html">Aging Ezra</a>, and <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2012/12/paul-krugman-and-noam-scheiber-obama-makes-another-strategic-mistake.html">Paul Krugman and Noam Schreiber</a>,** while <a href="http://jaredbernsteinblog.com/the-cliff-deal-in-the-offing/">Jared Bernstein</a>, last seen being willing to further reduce Senior Purchasing Power for a pair of dirty socks, puts it directly: </p>
</p>
<blockquote><p>The thing that worried me most in the endgame is that the [White House] would be so intent on a deal that they’d lock in too few revenues with no path back to the revenue well, and that they’d leave the debt ceiling hanging out there&#8230;.  Those fears will be realized unless the President really and truly refuses to negotiate on the debt ceiling and is willing to blow past those who would stage a strategic default.  If he is not, and if this cliff deal passes, then I fear the WH may have squandered its hard won leverage.</p></blockquote>
<p>That last is apparently politico-speak for &#8220;look who just s*at the bed.&#8221;  Thank G-d for House Republicans.  Otherwise, this Administration would have killed itself long ago.</p>
<p>*Wherein I mix Hebrew and Yiddish in comments.  This could become DeLong&#8217;s first entirely non-English comments thread&#8230;  **Sadly, I take this as more evidence that <em>Slouching Toward Prosperity</em> will not be published in my lifetime.</p>
