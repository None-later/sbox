<p><strong>DAMNED LIARS</strong></p>
<p><strong>AND SOCIAL SECURITY</strong></p>
<p>There are liars, damned liars, and “non partisan experts.” The non partisan experts are expert liars, “non partisan” because that’s the best lie of all. A damned liar need not be an expert, but he is usually pretty clever at mixing “true” facts, or at least “facts you can’t prove are not true,” with false implications that lead the people he wants to deceive into hurting themselves with false conclusions. Those false conclusions are ideally tied to other ideas that the mark really, really wants to believe, so he is never really able to let go of the lie he has been taught.</p>
<p>Robert J. Samuelson is not an expert, but he gets all his “facts” from them pre-twisted and designed to mislead. He published a pretty good example of the art of deception on Easter Sunday in the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/wouldroosevelt-recognize-todays-social-security/2012/04/08/gIQALChd4S_story.html" target="_blank">Washington Post</a>.</p>
<p>Good enough, in fact, that when I started to deconstruct the lies for this post, I soon saw that I was in for a long job.. one too long to expect readers to put up with. So I will have to content myself, and you, dear reader, with “pointing at” the truth and leave you to decide for yourself how far you want to go to understand it for yourself.</p>
<p>Samuelson begins by claiming that FDR would not approve of Social Security today because it has become &#8220;the dole&#8221; that Roosevelt tried to avoid. His argument is entirely fallacious. And, as it turns out, he is telling these lies in order to encourage us to change Social Security so that it BECOMES the dole. One can&#8217;t be sure that Samuelson recognizes this himself. A career of telling lies for money must do terrible things to a man&#8217;s brain.</p>
<p>Samuelson is very confused&#8230; or wants you to be confused&#8230; about the differences between &#8220;pay as you go&#8221; and “the dole” and &#8220;contributory&#8221; pension plans. </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>He gets the history of the development of the Social Security idea exactly backwards. For a clearer understanding of that history I recommend &#8220;The Battle to Save Social Security,&#8221; by Nancy Altman.</p>
<p>But rather than get lost in the mazes of Samuelson&#8217;s mind, I will attempt to describe the development of &#8220;pay as you go,&#8221; not as a &#8220;plan&#8221; but as a fact on the ground. Let us begin by examining one of Samuelson&#8217;s lies&#8230; a very familiar one:</p>
<p>But now, demographics are unfriendly. In 1960, there were five workers per recipient; today, there are three, and by 2025 the ratio will approach two. Roosevelt’s fear has materialized. Paying all benefits requires higher taxes, cuts in other programs or large deficits.<br />This is intended to deceive. The ratio of workers to retirees will not cause large deficits or cuts in other programs, or higher taxes. The reason the ratio has changed over the years is mostly due to the arithmetic of phasing in a pay as you go plan.</p>
<p>Suppose there is a great nation in which workers have been working and saving for their future retirement by putting some of their earnings into bank accounts or into stocks and bonds. Then suppose that a great catastrophe comes to that nation and wipes out the savings. The older workers have lost the most..they had the most savings to lose. But even younger workers can now understand that their own future savings will be at risk of being lost just as the older workers have lost theirs. <br />The workers come up with a way to &#8220;insure&#8221; their savings. They agree to join a retirement insurance pool with a &#8220;pay as you go&#8221; financing plan. Every worker will contribute a small part of his weekly pay to a fund that will pay for the &#8220;benefits&#8221; of those who retire.</p>
<p>Suppose there are forty million workers. A million aged 64, a million aged 63, and so on down to a million aged 26 and a million aged 25. The first year there are forty million workers and zero retirees. The ratio of workers to retirees is 40 to zero. The next year the million 64 year olds turn 65 and retire. The 25 year olds turn 26&#8230; and a million new workers turn 25 and begin paying the “tax.” Now there are forty million workers and one million retirees. The ratio of workers to retirees is now 40 to 1. The next year another million workers will retire, and a million new workers will come in at age 25. Now there will be forty million workers and two million retirees.. the ratio of workers to retirees is now 40 to 2. And so on. But not forever. Because eventually some of the retirees will die, and eventually the number of retirees who die will be equal to the number of people who retire each year, so the ratio of workers to retirees will stabilize according to the life expectancy of retirees. If that life expectancy is about 12 years, the ratio of workers to retirees will stabilize at about 3 to 1. Note here that the ratio of workers to retirees is the same as the ratio of working years to retirement years for each worker (on average).</p>
<p>The workers designing our retirement insurance plan know this. They know that the early retirees will collect more in benefits than they paid in. But they decide that this is fair; in fact it is exactly what is needed: Those who will retire soon are those who have lost the most savings in the recent disaster, and have the least time to recover by saving up enough under a &#8220;contributory&#8221; financing plan. The workers also know that those older workers contributed to the previous system: a combination of welfare and old fashioned “honor your father and your mother” care of their own parents. The workers also know the older workers cared for them when they were younger and built the infrastructure by which they are able to make money at all. They “paid for” their retirement, even though the money did not go into the current plan. The workers understand that by ‘grandfathering in” the older workers they are merely doing the fair and honorable thing of providing a transition from the previous, failed, plan to the new, better, plan.</p>
<p>The workers also know that the younger workers will not be hurt by “paying for” the older workers. The younger workers will eventually pay the full cost of their own retirement. They will not have to pay “more” because part of that money was used to pay for those who went before them. This is one of the beauties of “pay as you go” : As long as new workers will need the same insurance, they will join the pool and their contributions will pay directly for the retirement of the older workers. But the new workers won’t lose anything by that because their own retirement will be paid for by the newer workers coming into the system.</p>
<p>This is not a Ponzi scheme. The workers ALL get what they are paying for, and they will keep coming into the system as long as they need a way to insure their own retirement.<br />The current ratio is near 3 to 1 and is expected to go to near 2 to 1. But this is not a catastrophe. The current payroll tax is about 6%. If 3 workers paying 6% of their pay can &#8220;support&#8221; one retiree. Two workers would need to pay about 9% of their pay to support one retiree. Or, and this is a better way to think of it, each worker would need to pay 6% to pay for a life expectancy of 12 years. If he expects to live 20 years, he will need to pay about 9%. This may look expensive to you until you realize it is exactly the amount of money you would need to save for twenty years of retirement whether there was Social Security or not. While it’s true you “might” do better on the stock market, it is also true you might do a whole lot worse. And having less than you need is much, much more painful than having more than you need is pleasurable.</p>
<p>The numbers are actually a little better than this, and it will take a long time to reach that 2:1 ratio, if ever. And if you read the Trustees Report&#8230; if you read it very carefully&#8230; it shows that under their predictions&#8230; including the increase in life expectancy and the reduced ratio of workers to retirees&#8230;the payroll tax would only have to be raised to just over 8% for the worker. <br />Moreover the need for the raise will be so gradual that it can be met by raising the tax an average of one half of one tenth of one percent per year while wages are going up over a full percent per year. This means that a tax increase of about forty cents per week each year, while wages are going up about eight dollars per week each year, would enable workers to continue to pay for their own retirement, as they always have, and would have TWICE AS MUCH MONEY in their pockets AFTER paying for their longer retirement as they have today.</p>
<p>This preserves the INSURANCE nature of Social Security. It will add NOTHING to &#8220;the deficit,&#8221; and it means YOU will get to collect YOUR money when the time comes without welfare &#8220;means testing.” having to beg the rich man to pay for it, benefit cuts, or increase in the retirement age&#8230;which you will not like, whatever you think while you are young.</p>
<p>If you read the Samuelson editorial, it is important to keep in mind that what Samuelson means by “contributory” is you “invest” in stocks and hope for the best while you build up your savings&#8230; exactly the plan that failed and led to the need for Social Security in the first place. There is nothing wrong with investing, but Social Security provides you with insurance “in case” you don’t do as well as you hoped. As the ad says, “priceless.”</p>
<p>You also need to keep in mind that Social Security contributes NOTHING to the deficit. It is NOT welfare. It is paid for entirely by the workers who will get the benefits. Social Security has NOTHING to do with “why America’s budget problems are so intractable.” That problem is caused by deficit spending to pay for arms buildups, actual wars, and recessions caused by the big money gambling schemes&#8230; that Samuelson’s friends want you to play with them.</p>
<p>Samuelson seems confused about “pay as you go.” He does not understand money at all. He thinks that if “your money” is used to pay the benefits of someone already retired that you have “lost” your money. But this is no more true than you have lost your money because when you put it in the bank, the bank gives it to someone else to use while waiting for you to ask for it back.<br />Samuelson cites Sylvester Schieber. I have not read Schieber’s new book. But his “The Real Deal” was a collection of clever lies. Schieber qualifies as a “non partisan expert.”</p>
<p>Samuelson says “Americans believe (falsely) that their payroll taxes have been segregated to pay for their benefits&#8230;” This is a lie. There is nothing false about the segregation. It is the law. Your payroll taxes pay for your benefits. No other taxes pay for your benefits, and your taxes cannot be used for any other reason. They do not contribute to “the deficit” in any way.</p>
<p>Samuelson seems to think that the fact that you receive more in benefits than you paid for&#8230; “even assuming (again, fictitiously) that they had been invested” is an argument AGAINST Social Security. It looks to me like an argument FOR it. You get more in benefits than you paid in, because the benefits are paid for out of taxes on incomes that increase over time, even when the tax rate does not. This IS an investment. It is an investment in the growth of a “corporation” called The United States of America.</p>
<p>Samuelson is conflating Social Security with Medicare. The growth in medical costs predicted over the next century will require that the Medicare tax be increased, or that medical costs be brought down. But cutting Medicare will not lower medical costs, and it’s a pretty stupid idea to cut your insurance because you expect your medical costs to increase.</p>
<p>Finally, Samuelson, after saying that Roosevelt would hate Social Security today because it is “the dole,” a statement that is a lie, calls for us to ask “who among the elderly need benefits?” because he thinks we need to turn Social Security into a needs based welfare program&#8230; the “dole.”<br />As I said, when a man chooses to tell lies for a living, it must do terrible things to his brain.<br />Social Security is an “entitlement” because YOU HAVE PAID FOR IT. Don’t let the liars confuse you. It does not need to be “fixed.” All of the “fixes” on the table are stealth plans to destroy it. They want your money for their gambling games, and they hate the idea of workers having the security to EVER be able to say, “I have enough. Now I want to retire and do something with my remaining years better than working for the boss.”</p>

<p>AARP vs. Social Security?</p>
<p>Last week <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/16/social-security-cuts-aarp_n_1344934.html?ref=daily-brief">Huffington Post</a></p>
<p>reported that AARP was embarking on a</p>
<p>&#8220;Social Security and Medicare &#8220;listening tour&#8221; called <a href="http://www.aarp.org/politics-society/advocacy/info-03-2012/earned-a-say-events-tn1796.html">&#8220;You’ve Earned a Say and We’re Listening.&#8221;</a> Through &#8220;town halls, community conversations, bus tours and other events,&#8221; the influential organization promises to offer members a chance to speak out on the simmering debate over the future of Social Security and Medicare.</p>
<p>&#8220;The outreach is part of the group&#8217;s campaign to restore <a href="http://firedoglake.com/2011/06/30/supporting-social-security-benefit-cuts-whats-in-it-for-aarp/">trust it lost</a> during last year&#8217;s spending debate, when a top AARP official told the<i> Wall Street Journal</i> the organization was open to cuts to the entitlement programs. &#8220;The ship was sailing. I wanted to be at the wheel when that happens,&#8221; AARP policy chief John Rother said, <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304186404576389760955403414.html">according to <i>the Wall Street Journal</i></a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;But while AARP staffers fan out across the country to hear from members, the group&#8217;s CEO, Barry Rand, will be listening to a different cast of characters.</p>
<p><a href="http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/saloninvite.pdf"><u>An AARP invitation</u></a> to a secret &#8220;Relaxed and Robust Evening of &#8216;Salon Style&#8217; Conversation&#8221; to be held at a Capitol Hill home on March 27, obtained by The Huffington Post, indicates that the organization is still very much interested in a &#8220;grand-bargain&#8221; style deal that puts Social Security and Medicare cuts on the table.<br />&#8220;&#8221;AARP is not pursuing any closed door deals or grand bargains,&#8221; said an AARP spokeswoman. &#8220;Our main focus is hearing from our members, and all Americans, what they think about ways to strengthen Social Security and Medicare. That&#8217;s precisely why we&#8217;re launching &#8216;You&#8217;ve Earned a Say.&#8217; We are interested in hearing from all sides and having civil discourse on these issues.&#8221;</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>&#8220;The invite list for 2012 suggests that AARP is still very much open to cutting Social Security and Medicare, as a majority of this year&#8217;s expected &#8220;thought leaders&#8221; have thoughts that involve slashing Social Security.<br />&#8220;&#8221;They want to be at the table when a deal is cut,&#8221; said one person who declined to be named because he continues to work closely with AARP. The irony is that while AARP&#8217;s legislative team may be convinced that a deal is inevitable, a grand bargain actively opposed by AARP would be effectively impossible for Congress to pass.&#8221;</p>
<p>What this amounts to is that AARP, granny&#8217;s lawyer, sees granny being raped by a bunch of thugs. But instead off rushing in to help her, he waits to see how the struggle is going. If it looks like the rapists are going to win, he will rush in to help them. Just in case, you know, there might be something in it for him.<br />There were 3700 comments on Huff Post to this article. Most of them understood that AARP is not one of the good guys, and their &#8220;we want to hear from you&#8221; is just a cynical smokescreen..no more than a survey to see how effective the lies have been. But sadly, not one of the 3700 comments showed any real understanding of Social Security or the &#8220;crisis&#8221; surrounding it. They have all grown up hearing the lies, and no effective answer to those lies. Not surprising when the politicians and the press are effectively owned by the Liars, and the &#8220;liberals&#8221; who defend Social Security always start out by talking as if the lies were true.<br />Rather than attempt to counter the lies, I will just repeat the simple truth here one more time and hope that someone finds a way to tell the people:</p>
<p>Social Security has nothing to do with the deficit, and it never will. Social Security is not going broke, and it never can. Social Security is not paid for by &#8220;the government.&#8221; It is paid for by the workers who will get the benefits. </p>
<p>With no change whatsoever Social Security can continue to provide &#8220;adequate&#8221; benefits so workers can afford at least a basic retirement after about forty years of work&#8230; that is when they reach 62, though they can get a larger monthly benefit if they choose to retire later. </p>
<p>IF those same workers as a voting majority decide they want the &#8220;same replacement rate&#8221; (monthly benefit as a percent of of their average lifetime real working wages) &#8230; over a longer life expectancy in retirement&#8230; they can raise their own payroll tax one half of one tenth of one percent per year&#8230; or about forty cents per week each year in today&#8217;s terms while their wages are increasing over one full percent per year&#8230; or about eight dollars per week per year.</p>
<p>Pretty much everything else you hear about Social Security is Lies or nonsense. There is no need to raise the cap, cut benefits, raise the retirement age, means test, or tax the rich. At most just a tiny raise in what amounts to an insurance premium to cover the increased costs associated with living longer in a richer society.</p>

                                <div>The post garnered only one comment, from kharris, who complained that the post was incomprehensible and asked whether it was intended as facetious, and whether I could give a Cliff’s Notes version of it.  I can and did.  I wrote:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>[The] post was not intended as facetious, although I’m sure it will be taken that way by the few people who read it.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Basically, the 26 state attorneys general are claiming in that lawsuit that the part of the ACA that relies on a significant increase in Medicaid, funded mostly by the federal government but partly by the states, violates the Tenth Amendment, which the political right claims gives states autonomy amounting to sovereignty not much different than the sovereignty of foreign countries <i>vis-à-vis</i> the U.S. government.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Their claim is that while the state governments are legally entitled to withdraw from the Medicaid program, politically that’s not a feasible option, because Medicaid is a popular program.  This means that the ACA’s requirement that the states spend more in order to remain in the Medicaid program and receive the federal funds they currently receive, the states will have to spend more of their own money on Medicaid in order to meet the requirements of the ACA.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The states claim that this additional requirement is large enough to require states to have to substantially reduce the appropriations for other priorities, such as education, and that therefore the ACA’s Medicaid expansion basically controls the budget process of state legislatures, and in this way unconstitutionally infringes on state sovereignty under the Tenth Amendment.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Enter Romney, and the economic/budget plan he announced last Friday, in which he would cut taxes across the board by 20%, cut corporate taxes by even more (I think), eliminate the estate tax, increase defense spending, leave Medicare and Social Security untouched, and “return Medicaid to the states,” and “send” the other safety-net programs for the poor “to the states” as well.  In other words, he plans to end federal funding for Medicaid and all the other programs.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Which according to the states’ argument in the ACA litigation, would violate the states’ sovereignty under the Tenth Amendment.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>So, no, the original post was not intended as facetious.  The post was hard to understand, in part at least because the legal argument of the 26 states is ridiculous.  Yet the Supreme Court agreed to consider the states’ argument.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>But a more important point is this: The economic/budget plan that Romney announced last Friday in an attempt to gain Tea Party support in Michigan would cut taxes by 20% across the board, eliminate the estate taxes, cut corporate taxes still further, and balance the budget, if it does, by entirely removing federal funding of all safety-net programs for the poor and telling the states that they should pick up the slack. More than half the states are claiming to the Supreme Court that this would violate the Tenth Amendment, because at least one of these programs, Medicaid, is too popular for it to be politically feasible to end it. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The Supreme Court almost certainly won’t buy the argument, but what matters is that the states have <i>made</i> the argument.  And have made the point.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Also what matters, of course, is that someone who’s running for president on a claim to be exceptionally astute on business/economic/budget matters should have resisted the urge to put forward a budget proposal that bizarre and easily deconstructed by, well, almost anyone.</div>
<div>&#8212;&#8211;<br />*Ooops. Romney did discuss cutting Social Security benefits in that speech last Friday, by raising the retirement cap.  Seems I was almost as distracted by the empty stadium as most of the news media was, and missed that.  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/01/opinion/collins-a-big-days-coming.html">But Gail Collins noticed</a>, and noticed that rest of the news media didn’t notice.
<div>
</div>
<div></div>
<p>Collins also discusses the payroll tax cap.  And Seamus, of course. </p></div>

                            <div class="content">
                                <div>I caught a bit of Jennifer Granholm&#8217;s <a href="http://current.com/shows/the-war-room/videos/fired-up-gas-prices-are-soaring-but-who-should-take-the-blame">The War Room for 2/23/12.</a>  She was talking gasoline prices and had Ron Klain on for his ideas.  He is a past chief of staff for Gore and Biden as VP&#8217;s.  Mr. Klain also published <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-02-21/defusing-political-peril-of-surging-gas-prices-commentary-by-ron-klain.html">his thought at Bloomberg2/20/12</a>.    </div>
<div></div>
<div>This post is not about solving the rising gasoline costs.  This post is about the further screwing of the 99% by further reducing their security from the risk of life and living.   </div>
<div></div>
<div>Let&#8217;s cut to the chase: </div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><div>One idea might be a “pocketbook protection” plan, which would work as follows: If the average price of gas exceeds $4 a gallon, an additional, automatic payroll tax cut of 1 percent would kick in, as much as $50 per month, per person. The cut would stay in place for at least 90 days; it would disappear when the price fell below $4.00 per gallon.  </div>
<div></div>
<div>There are three advantages to this approach. First, because the plan is of limited duration and is capped at $50 a month, its cost is relatively modest &#8212; about $5 billion a month, or $20 billion total, assuming the usual four-month gas-price surge. Second, because it isn’t a reduction in gas taxes, it doesn’t weaken any incentives for fuel conservation or efficiency: All workers get $50 to soften the blow of higher gas prices, but the less fuel they use, the more money they save. And third, the relief provides the greatest relative help to lower-income workers who need gas to commute and feel the price pinch the hardest. </div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>I have to assume our Colberly&#8217;s head has just popped.  What Mr. Klain has proposed is the exact danger  many have warned about regarding the use of SS as a means to make up for what is a major functional problem of our current economy:<i> lack of share of income to the masses. </i>  </div>
<div></div>
<p><a name="more"></a>
<div>I have pointed out many times that we can not make up for the $1.1 to $1.4 trillion per year of income no longer in the hands of the 99% that is in the hands of the 1% with tax reductions.  It can not be done. With that fact, considering taxation reduction in any form as a method to address this specific issue is nothing more than the continuation of the false economy that financialization created as observed from the position of those in the labor part of the economy.  It quite literally is the government now using the mathematical gymnastics pioneered by Wall Street to trick the masses into believing that home equity was the same as earned income.  Getting a tax cut anywhere is not the same as receiving a greater share of the nation&#8217;s income.  It is money, by the way, that you are more than justified to receive because you helped to create it.  The rich used to have an opportunity to relearn this lesson every time there was a major strike, say the NY City trash collectors going on strike.    </div>
<div></div>
<div>People,  I hope we have learned that one&#8217;s home, your house has a more important roll to play in your life other than that of asset appreciation.  The home is one of the foundations used to reduce the risk of living, of having a life: shelter.  Social Security is another one of those life&#8217;s risk reducing foundations: longevity.  I have asked often here: How many times to do we have to relearn a lesson?</div>
<div></div>
<div> </div>
<div>Using SS as a means to offset the results created over the long term from bad policy is the polluting of a very good policy.  We can look at the housing crisis as another already experienced pollution.  The good policy was promoting home ownership.  The bad policy was setting up an economy that changed the perception of home ownership from a life risk reduction activity to an asset building activity.  Now that SS  has been used once as a solution to an unrelated problem and extended once in a manor that moves it further from the original purpose (reduction of risk of living), with Mr. Klain&#8217;s proposal, the use of SS as a back stop for non-related policy results has become an unquestioned and considered reasonable use.   </div>
<div></div>
<div>Mr. Klain&#8217;s proposal so exemplifies what our politico&#8217;s now consider acceptable for SS&#8217;s use that he even proposes to pay for it via a general funding solution: </div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><div>The plan could be almost entirely paid for with a modest, no-loopholes surcharge on corporate taxes on profit derived from the higher gas prices. The administration would be able to avoid pejorative terms such as “windfall” or “excess” profit tax, because the tax is neither confiscatory nor punitive. With higher gas prices, oil companies will make record profit &#8212; and a partial surcharge will still leave that profit at record high levels. In other words, the plan isn’t vulnerable to suggestions of creeping, soak-the-rich redistribution. It would leave in place all incentives for oil companies to increase production, do more research and development, and explore alternative fuels. But a modest surcharge would help fund at least a partial pocketbook protection program to make sure the cost of the oil companies’ gain isn’t excessive pain for the rest of us.  </div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>Just to be clear, that Mr. Klain proposes using SS for anything other than SS is the problem.  The only difference in such action compared to the housing crisis which was tied to the removal of specific banking regulation is that it took us 10 year or so to experience<a href="http://draft.blogger.com/goog_1597648086"> the warning of Senator Byron Dorgan.</a></div>
<p><a href="http://billmoyers.com/content/a-senators-prophetic-words-then-and-now/"></a>
<div></div>
<div>For those warning about the proverbial slippery slope phenomenon of using SS as a back stop for bad policy results leading to furthering the destruction of SS,  it&#8217;s only been about 3 years since this application of SS first became a reality.  This use is now acceptable.  Social Security has now officially been changed from a purpose specific funded program to an general revenue program.  The establishment is so comfortable within this frame of use for SS we get a proposal such as Mr. Klain&#8217;s.    We also have on the record a warning in the vein of Senator Dorgan&#8217;s <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/17/payroll-tax-cut-tom-harkin_n_1284334.html"> from Senator Harkin</a>:   </div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><div>&#8220;This Congress will be making a grave mistake &#8212; a grave mistake &#8212; and reinforcing a dangerous precedent,&#8221; Harkin said in a dramatic Senate floor speech late Thursday.</div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>Mr. Klain freely proposing another application of a SS tax cut is proof of the truth to Senator Harkin&#8217;s warning.  The precedent stands.  It is &#8220;codified&#8221;.    And, with this precedent the conservative/monied movement has neutralized another barrier protecting SS and it&#8217;s status as the end-all be-all of the New Deal: the Democratic Party.    </div>
<div></div>
<div>The Movement has also successfully completed the instillation of it&#8217;s virus known as Financialization into the nervous system of our government.  Social Security no longer thinks as the mind of one living in a labor economy; as the 99%.   It thinks as the mind of one living in a money from money economy; as the 1%.</div>

<p><strong>LES MISERABLES:   SOCIAL SECURITY</strong><br />Javert And Evil</p>
<p>From a message from the <em><strong>National Consumer Law Center</strong></em> (reference <a href="mailto:msaunders@nclc.org">msaunders@nclc.org</a>):  <br />
<blockquote><strong>&#8220;</strong>It’s perfectly fine for a person who failed to pay their child support to end up penniless and living in their car, and to die that way.<strong>”</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>– High Ranking U.S. Treasury Official, in response to a request for help with Treasury’s rules which allow 100% of Social Security benefits to be taken to pay for decades-old child support.  February 3, 2012.           As the result of the concurrence of two new Treasury rules, elderly and disabled Social Security recipients will soon lose all of their benefits to old child support orders.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>•   As of March, 2013, all recipients of federal benefits must receive benefits through electronic deposit, either through deposit directly into a bank account, or using the Treasury authorized Direct Express Card. (31 CFR § 208.4.) </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><strong>·</strong>  Treasury’s new garnishment rule, intended to protect benefits in bank accounts from garnishment allows child support orders to garnish all of the funds in the accounts. (31 CFR 221.4.)   </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>As a result,  65% of the recipient’s benefits will be withheld pursuant to administrative seizures and paid directly to the child support office.  <u>The remaining 35% will be deposited into the beneficiary’s bank account, where it will be seized in full through a bank garnishment.</u></p></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>Most SS recipients who owe child support are old and or disabled.  Their children are grown and the child  support is owed to the state.  The amounts of the orders have ballooned to tens of thousands because of annual 10 or 12% interest rates applied.<br /><a name="more"></a><strong>·</strong>    Although blind and elderly, Mr. W.  found a legal services lawyer in September 2010 when the Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE) ordered Treasury to take $217 from his Social Security check (which normally is $775).  Five weeks after the legal services lawyer filed papers, the OCSE stopped the garnishment as it was required to do under New York State law.  But in January 2011, the OCSE&#8217;s computer matched and froze Mr. W. &#8216;s bank account, depriving him of his entire Social Security payment.  Again the legal services lawyer interceded, and after several weeks, the OCSE returned Mr. W. &#8216;s Social Security.  But in July 2011, the OCSE&#8217;s computer froze Mr. W. &#8216;s account again.  South Brooklyn Legal Services fought to retrieve  his Social Security payment so Mr. W.  could pay his rent. </p></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><strong>·</strong>    Mr. R.  is sixty two years old, homebound, and lives entirely off of his $780 Social Security payment. In June 2011, the OCSE ordered the U.S. Treasury to garnish 65% of Mr. R.  Social Security check for child support arrears owed to his adult children.  This reduced his check to $273.  Unable to pay his rent or feed himself for an entire month, R.  protested to the OCSE.  After reviewing evidence in July 2011 showing Mr. R.  lived below the poverty line, the OCSE stopped the garnishment as New York law requires.  But the OCSE did not reprogram its computers.  On August 5, 2011, Mr. Richard&#8217;s bank account containing his restored, direct deposit Social Security check was matched and seized by the OCSE&#8217;s computer.  Although a legal services lawyer sent Mr. R.&#8217;s bank records to the OSCE, the account remains restrained.  So desperate remains Mr. R.  that he went by access-a-ride in his wheelchair to the local OSCE office in person, begging for money for rent.  An  indifferent bureaucrat told him to come back with an award letter form Social Security and perhaps he would do something.  Mr. R.  called Social Security and was told he would receive an award letter in seven to ten business days.  And because the Social Security Administration could not switch his electronic check to paper until 6 weeks later, his next month’s check sailed electronically into his frozen account where it was also unreachable to him.</p></blockquote>
<p>I have argued in this space that Social Security is the only way ordinary workers have to save their own money for retirement in a way that is protected from inflation and market losses. People of a Libertarian Persuasion have argued that the money is NOT safe from “the government.” In general that has not been the case&#8230;  only one person has lost his Social Security money because of “the government,”  and he was a deported communist. that is, someone we the people, though our government, are perfectly willing to cheat and cause great harm.  I have thought the government would not be able to cheat and harm the entire population of Social Security contributors and recipients.   </p>
<p>But “the government”  appears to be embarked on a course to give aid and comfort to those who say “you can’t trust the government.”   </p>
<p>Well, you can’t.  Unless WE have the decency to protect “the least of these” against the evil that can and does appear from time to time in “our government,” we can expect the time will come when we are among that select minority which the government can cheat and harm with impunity because “we the people” don’t give a damn.</p>
<p>It’s not Social Security that is at fault here.  It is us.   </p>
<p>Let it be understood that I am not arguing that folks should not be required to pay their child support.  But hitting someone old or disabled with a decades old bill, with accrued interest, that takes everything they have to live on, and saying, “It’s perfectly fine for a person who failed to pay their child support to end up penniless and living in their car, and to die that way,&#8221;  &#8230;is evil.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if this is part of an ongoing &#8220;conspiracy&#8221; to discredit Social Security, or if it is just the random evil that can occur at all times&#8230; in government or out of it.  But it is evil.  And we should stop it.</p>

<p><strong>SOCIAL SECURITY   More How They Lie To Us</strong></p>
<p>David Brooks says in a column headlined  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/10/opinion/brooks-where-are-the-liberals.html" target="_blank">Where Are the Liberals?</a></p>
<p>Americans don&#8217;t hate government, but  &#8220;believe the government has been captured by rent-seekers.&#8221;    <br />
<blockquote>This is the disease that corrodes government at all times and in all places. As George F. Will wrote in a column in Sunday’s Washington Post, as government grows, interest groups accumulate, seeking to capture its power and money. Some of these rent-seeking groups are corporate types. . . .   Others exercise their power transparently and democratically. As Will notes, in 2009, the net worth of households headed by senior citizens was 47 times the net worth of households led by people under 35. Yet seniors use their voting power to protect programs that redistribute even more money from the young to the old and affluent.   </p></blockquote>
<p>The lie is that this  is a dishonest segue from corporate rent seekers to the implication that &#8220;seniors&#8221; (as if they were all the same) are rent seekers, and that the normal wealth that &#8220;a generation&#8221; acquires after a lifetime of work is somehow unnatural and unfair, and worst of all, that somehow SS is redistributing money to the affluent.   </p>
<p>SS doesn&#8217;t redistribute money except from your young self to your old self, exactly as if you had saved it (and bought insurance against inflation and financial setbacks of various kinds),  it does not add to the wealth of the wealthy, it helps the elderly poor live in modest comfort&#8230; very modest comfort.   </p>
<p>Just to be clear, not all the elderly are rich.  Social Security is a way for people to protect themselves from being destitute in old age. It does not make them rich.  It does not take money from “the government.” It does not take money from the poor young to give to the elderly rich.  Workers simply save their own money in an insurance plan run by, but not paid for by, the government.  The plan protects their savings from inflation, market losses, and certain kinds of personal bad luck.  It is insurance.  At the end of the day part of the premium paid by those who end up not needing the insurance (they did not have the fire) is used to help out those who did have the fire.  As it turns out even those who don’t have the fire get all of their premium back plus enough interest to make up for inflation and provide a real return on their “investment” equal to the average growth of wages over the time they have been making their Social Security payments.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />And, just in case you missed it, working people normally start out relatively poor in “wealth”,  they work all their lives to acquire “wealth” so they will be able to retire when they need to or want to.  For Brooks, or George Will to imply that somehow this is robbing the young is not just a lie, it’s a damned lie.   </p>
<p>SS does not redistribute money from the young to the old&#8230; except in the sense of deferring some of your spending when you are young so that you will have something to live on when you are old.  Pay as you go is the mechanism that makes this possible without risk of losses due to inflation or bad investments.     </p>
<p>This is no different from what you would do if you saved it on your own&#8230; except for the guarantee.  It is no more “rent seeking” than any other investment. All investment assumes that when you need to start cashing in your assets there will be another generation of investors out there glad to buy your stocks, or at least buy the products of the company you own stock in.  If this be “rent seeking” then the whole idea of capitalism is based on rent seeking.   </p>
<p>Brooks and George Will know this.  They are highly paid liars, confidence men paid to talk you out of your life savings.</p>

<p><strong>SOCIAL SECURITY</strong><br /><strong>How They Lie To Us</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204531404577054290268238730.html%22%3En" target="_blank">The Wall Street Journal</a> in the article <i>Newtitlement State </i>is unhappy with Newt Gingrich’s plan to privatize Social Security. Not only does it know that “privatization” failed when Bush offered it to the country, but they understand that most elected Republicans have distanced themselves from private-account carveouts as well.  Rather than embracing them, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, whose election was one of the Tea Party&#8217;s biggest victories in 2010, said during his campaign.<br />
<blockquote>“Privatization of the accounts has come and gone. There are other alternatives, such as [raising] the retirement age, how you adjust payments in the future, &#8216;need&#8217; measures, et cetera.</p></blockquote>
<p>What this means is that “privatization” was never more than a political strategy to kill Social Security. It failed, and now we have a better plan to kill Social Security that won’t cost so much.  </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what the Journal said about Gingrich&#8217;s plan</p>
<blockquote><p>The irony of Social Security is that its slow-motion solvency crisis is relatively easy to resolve—and the political system is moving toward consensus, if haltingly&#8230;. Personal Social Security accounts are desirable, but that doesn&#8217;t mean it makes sense to reject compromises that reduce future liabilities. Yet Mr. Gingrich proposes no such changes in his plan, perhaps because they are politically unpopular. But such an abdication opens him up to charges that he&#8217;s not serious about reform and that he has no plan to pay for the transition costs of going to personal accounts (that is, when younger workers put their money in their own accounts, rather than funding current retirees).</p></blockquote>
<p>This is so subtle and so dishonest that I thought it would be worth the time to deconstruct it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Its slow-motion solvency crisis&#8221; &#8230; note that this assumes there is a solvency crisis. In fact there is not one. Social Security is not insolvent and can never be insolvent. With no changes whatsoever it can pay future benefits that are adequate by today’s standards, benefits which will be in fact greater in real value than today’s benefits.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />One danger here is that even the defenders of Social Security have got into the habit of pointing to the 2036 DEATH OF THE TRUST FUND as “not a crisis&#8230; it’s 25 years away.”</p>
<p>Well 25 years is coming soon enough that folks are starting to notice that it will happen before or during their own retirement. The defenders of SS need to learn that 2036 is not a crisis, not because it is so far away, but because it never meant anything in the first place.</p>
<p>At about that time the Trust Fund will have done its job: helped pay for the boomer retirement, and will run out of money just the way your Christmas Fund runs out of money on or about December 25. After that Social Security goes back to regular old pay as you go financing, the way it was designed to work. </p>
<p>Because IN THE MEANWHILE life expectancy has been increasing, the disappearance of the Trust Fund will not cause, but will unmask, the need to increase the tax rate to pay for that increased life expectancy IF the workers of that time want to keep a replacement rate that reflects the INCREASE in their standard of living since the last time the tax rate was set. If they decide they will want to do this, the easiest and fairest way to accomplish it would be to start this year with a raise of forty cents per week, and to increase the tax another forty cents per week each year&#8230; while their wages will be increasing about eight dollars per week each year.</p>
<p>“is relatively easy to resolve.” Yes, of course it is. A tiny increase in the tax rate would do it. An increase so small no one would even notice it. But that’s not what the Journal means. They mean it would be relatively easy to cut benefits, or raise the retirement age, or “means test”. All of these would destroy Social Security and cause misery to hundreds of millions of people over time, but they would be “relatively easy” to enact.</p>
<p>“the political system is moving toward consensus,” With a billion dollars of Peterson money behind the “consensus” the political system is indeed moving. But this does not mean that “consensus” means either that honest people are realizing this is the best way, or that the people&#8230; as opposed to the politicians&#8230; are in favor of this. But, as the Journal knows, slip in the word “consensus” and readers will feel, if not think, that “everyone knows&#8230;and so it must be so.”</p>
<p>“Personal Social Security accounts are desirable,” This is almost “subliminally” slipped in. You won’t remember where you heard it, but “personal accounts are desirable” will stick in your brain unexamined. ARE personal (not private, of course, personal) accounts desirable? Well no. But you aren’t going to get to see an honest debate about that. You will just “believe “ it when the time comes. Personal accounts are not INSURANCE, which is what Social Security is. A personal account is exactly what the people had before the great depression taught them a lesson that no one alive now remembers very well. The depression taught people that some kind of retirement insurance was necessary to prevent very widespread poverty among people too old to work, or too old to be hired. With a personal account you might get a little richer than you will from the same money put into Social Security, or you might get a lot poorer. There is no reason you can’t have a personal account in addition to your Social Security insurance&#8230; but they don’t want you to think that.</p>
<p>“that doesn&#8217;t mean it makes sense to reject compromises that reduce future liabilities.” But “future liabilities” means “future benefits.” And just what is being compromised? You are saving yourself a forty cent tax increase for the “compromise” of getting benefits cut about 200 dollars a month at a time in your life when that will really hurt, or having two years added to the time you HAVE to work for the boss, even though you paid, or could have paid, for your own retirement. Note that no one is stopping you from working extra years if you want to. SS is insurance. It’s there in case you can’t work longer. Or don’t want to work longer&#8230;. remember, you paid for it. </p>
<p>“ Yet Mr. Gingrich proposes no such changes in his plan, “ Note that “compromises” has become “changes.” Benefit cuts. means testing. work, if you can find work, until you drop.</p>
<p>“ perhaps because they are politically unpopular.”. Yes, it would be a shame if the people were to be allowed to have their opinion heard. Much less be informed about what their choices are. You see, the only way we can save the country is to lie to the people and take away their right to save for their own retirement.</p>
<p>“such an abdication opens him up to charges that he&#8217;s not serious about reform and that he has no plan to pay for the transition costs of going to personal accounts “ Ah, there’s the rub. After the failure of he Bush “personal accounts” plan, the enemies realized they could could kill Social Security without incurring the “costs of transition.” Simply cut benefits, raise the retirement age, impose means testing&#8230; so that the program will no longer work as insurance sufficient to allow people to retire. This would force them to try to beat inflation and the markets on their own&#8230; without &#8220;the government&#8221; incurring any transition cost. A win win&#8230; for the people who hate Social Security.</p>
<p>“that is, when younger workers put their money in their own accounts, rather than funding current retirees.” And here is the father of lies. With Social Security workers already “put their money in their own accounts.” It happens that “pay as you go” DIRECTLY funds “current retirees.” But that doesn’t mean the workers are paying for someone else’s greedy granny. They are paying for their own retirement. Workers who “invest” in stocks and bonds are “funding current retirees”&#8230; who live off stock and bond returns. The only difference is that with Social Security the workers are guaranteed that their own retirement will be paid for when they need it.</p>
<p> The United States of America has more assets than any stock or bond can claim to have. In the case of Social Security the &#8220;asset&#8221; is an infinite supply of new workers who need to save for their own retirement in the only plan that protects their savings from inflation and market losses, and certain kinds of personal misfortune. They no more..or less&#8230; &#8220;pay for&#8221; current retirees than an unending supply of new customers &#8220;pay for&#8221; the retirements of those who own the stocks and bonds issued by a corporatioin.</p>
<p>But you need to think. With SS you pay your insurance premium and a record of that payment is recorded in your name. When you come to retirement, the total of your contributions is automatically adjusted to equal the average growth in the economy, which includes both inflation and real growth in wages. Your benefit is calculated based on your adjusted contribution. It is “paid for” (directly) by the contributions of those still working&#8230; who will get the same good deal you are getting. But while they are “funding” the system, they are not “paying for” current retirees. The current retirees already paid for themselves. Current workers are paying for themselves.</p>
<p>Or they were until the enemies of Social Security came up with the truly brilliant plan of killing Social Security simply by giving the workers their savings back to fritter away. They promise to make up for your lost savings by borrowing the money and taxing the rich&#8230; turning Social Security into welfare as we knew it. Welfare is something they already know how to kill in the dark.</p>

<p>SOCIAL SECURITY AND BRAIN DAMAGE</p>
<p>Liberals Destroy Social Security While Claiming Victory</p>
<p>Republicans Cry “Please Not the Briar Patch, Br’er ‘Bama, please, please!”</p>
<p>Robert Kuttner, http://www.huffingtonpost.com/robert-kuttner/obama-social-security_b_1178904.html  tells us that Obama has won a great victory by getting the Republicans to extend the payroll tax cut; SS “will be made whole from transfers from general government revenues.  So far, so good.”</p>
<p>So far so bad.  The great glory of Social Security has been that it does not depend on “general government revenues.”  It is not a welfare program.  The workers pay for it themselves.  Therefore it contributes absolutely nothing to “The Deficit.”</p>
<p>Since  “liberals” frequently defend Social Security by pointing this out, you’d think that they could remember it long enough to avoid destroying the very foundation of Social Security.</p>
<p>But Kuttner tells us “there is no good reason why Social Security has to be funded entirely by payroll taxes.”</p>
<p>No reason, indeed, except that that is what Social Security IS.  Fund it from the general fund and it stops being Social Security.  It becomes welfare as we knew it. You can keep calling it Social Security but you will be fooling yourself.</p>
<p>Then Kuttner tells us, “the payroll tax&#8230;is one of our most regressive taxes&#8230;”</p>
<p>Except that it’s not a tax, and it’s not regressive.  </p>
<p>A tax is a “required payment FOR THE SUPPORT OF A GOVERNMENT.”</p>
<p>The payroll “tax” does not support any government; it is used to support the person who pays the tax.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>You can find reasons for calling the payroll tax a tax [it is a mandatory payment TO the government], but please contemplate this one fact:  SS does not support the government.  It supports the worker when he can no longer work.   I am sorry if the use of the word “tax” confuses you, especially when i deliberately say “the payroll tax is not a tax.” The point here is to get you to think.  Think about what Social Security IS, whatever words you want to use to refer to it.</p>
<p>As to being “regressive,”  a low income worker can expect to get an effective “real rate of return” on his Social Security investment of 10% or so;  a high income worker would expect about a 2% rate of return.  How “regressive” is that?</p>
<p>Again, if you have been taught to say, “regressive tax, regressive tax, awk, regressive tax” whenever you hear Social Security,  I can’t stop you.  I can only ask you to think about the harm you are doing.</p>
<p>You don’t call SS a “regressive tax” unless you are advocating changing it to a “progressive” tax by turning it into welfare paid for by “the rich.”</p>
<p>FDR, in spite of what Kuttner says, was smarter than that.  He knew what becomes of welfare programs, so he insisted SS be paid for by the workers themselves “so no damn politician can take it away from them.”</p>
<p>But Kuttner thinks that “making up the Social Security gap with a tax on millionaires is good policy. As long as the system is substantially financed by payroll taxes, the benefit still feels earned.”</p>
<p>How nice.  The poor can feel they earned their benefit, while the millionaires who are not getting the benefit will feel so good about paying for it that they won’t bother to try to cut the benefits, or means test them, or raise the retirement age&#8230;  because, you know, the rich are like that.  Kind and generous about paying taxes, as long as the poor “feel like” they are paying for it.</p>
<p>I could let Kuttner and other pppprogressives call SS whatever they want in the privacy of their own faculty clubs, but when SS is under attack for its life, it is reckless irresponsibility to call it “a regressive tax” and to entertain sucker dreams about getting “millionaires” to pay for it.</p>
<p>The Social Security “gap,” before Obama started playing with it, was forty cents per week.  Now that Obama has won his great victory over the Republicans the gap is sixteen dollars per week.</p>
<p>Since Obama has told the world that the Republicans won’t dare “impose such a huge tax raise on the middle class” we can be reasonably sure the Democrats won’t either.</p>
<p>So Social Security is now a welfare plan paid for by government deficits&#8230; just like Peterson always said&#8230; except it wasn’t true when Peterson said it.  Now, thanks to Obama and the Democrats and &#8220;progressives” like Kuttner, it is.</p>
<p>SS could still be resurrected, but that would take some skill and leadership&#8230; probably something like a “making work pay” tax cut to replace the “payroll tax holiday,” so that when the tax cut has to end, the &#8220;tax increase&#8221; won’t get blamed on Social Security.</p>
<p>But skill and leadership we do not have.</p>
<p>Write this down, so when your children are forced to live in the poor house in their old age, someone may read it and remember that once upon a time there was a way for workers to save their own money so they could retire at a reasonable age&#8230; with their money protected from inflation and market losses, and government deficits&#8230; by the ingenious idea of pay as you go financing.  This was called Social Security.  But it was destroyed by &#8220;the friends of the poor,&#8221; who thought they could force the rich to pay for it.</p>

<p>Payroll Tax Cut -Keystone vote up Saturday at 9 in Senate</p>
<p>Apparently, Senate leaders on Friday ironed out the difficulty between the GOP and the Democratic party.  The GOP got most everything it wanted, and the Dems got just barely more than nothing.  That&#8217;s the way &#8220;negotiating&#8221; seems to go in the Congress these days.  The right demands and demands and demands and gets most of it by obfuscating and obstructing. </p>
<p>This time the Dems were worried about not getting a spending bill.  So while the House passed a spending bill to carry the Federal Government through September 2012, the Senate caved on all the things they&#8217;d said they wouldn&#8217;t cave on&#8211;like the ridiculous provision for expedited approval of the Keystone Pipeline.  All to get just a 2-month extension of the payroll tax cut and expanded unemployment benefits&#8211;which the GOP knew it could not afford not to pass, no matter what.  And Obama has already flipped on his earlier looks-like-he&#8217;s-finally-figured-out-how-to-stand-tall position that he would veto any bill that carried the expedited Keystone approval provision.  See Steinhaur &#038; Pear, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/17/us/politics/boehner-ties-oil-pipeline-to-payroll-tax-bill.html">Senate Agrees to a Two-Month Extension of the Tax Cut</a>, New York Times (Dec. 16, 2011). <br /><a name="more"></a>The GOP continues to call the Keystone pipeline project a &#8220;job creator&#8221;, even though it will create no more than 50 permanent jobs, at a considerable environmental cost.  Schumer calls the Keystone provision a &#8220;Pyrrhic victory&#8221; for the GOP, because he says Obama will not approve it if pushed.  That&#8217;s not so clear to me.  Schumer also spins the cave-in as a victory for Dems! saying that the GOP won&#8217;t have the leverage of the need to pass a spending bill when this issue comes back.  See  Rubin et al, <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-12-16/u-s-senate-leaders-agree-on-two-month-payroll-tax-cut-extension.html">U.S. Senate Leaders Agree on Two-Month Payroll Cut </a>, Bloomberg.com (Dec. 16, 2011). <br />Again, past experience suggests this may be too rosy an assessment.  There were commentators who thought that surely the Congress would not pass further tax cuts after the 2001 tax cuts resulted in large deficits but instead we got the 2003 bill and the 2004 tax giveaway for corporations bill and many others, with the deficits mounting with each one.  One would have thought that the sunset of the various Bush tax cuts in 2010 would have been a perfect time for the Dems to develop a spine, but they didn&#8217;t.  And the Dems weren&#8217;t even able to pass a bill ending the carried interest subsidy for hedge fund managers, in spite of the Great Recession and the need to reign in financial institutions.<br />The Senate bill will apparently at least not include some of the bad stuff  that was in HR 3630 as passed by the House&#8211;it is &#8220;scaled back&#8221; so it looks like medicare premiums won&#8217;t rise for seniors, and  the GOP won&#8217;t win its attempt to end medicare&#8217;s coverage of outpatient rehabilitative therapy for stroke victims and medicare payments to doctors will not be affected.   Nor will it include the &#8220;extensions&#8221; of expiring tax provisions like the R&#038;D credit or the active financing exception for the financial  industries&#8217; deferral of its offshoreprofits.  Id.<br />The Senate bill will apparently be paid for by raising the guarantee fees for Freddie and Fannie, something that was included in HR 3630.  Id.  Vote is to take place at 9 am Saturday.<br />crossposted at <a href="http://www.blogger.com/Payroll%20Tax%20Cut%20-Keystone%20vote%20up%20Saturday%20at%209%20in%20Senate" target="_blank">ataxingmatter</a></p>

<p>Social Security&#8230;Hearts and Minds</p>
<p>   Tom Margenau wrote an essay about the payroll tax holiday in The National Memo <a href="http://nationalmemo.com/content/your-tax-holiday-gift-lump-coal" target="_blank">Is Your Tax Holiday Gift A Lump of Coal?</a>  His essay seemed to me to illustrate one of the problems with the Social Security &#8220;debate&#8221; as it has been constructed.</p>
<p>Margenau  describes himself as &#8220;not very good with numbers,&#8221; but someone who has been accused of being &#8220;a bleeding heart liberal.&#8221;  &#8220;But,&#8221; he says, &#8220;this is one liberal who gives the Republicans credit&#8230; at least they are willing to talk about it.&#8221;   The trouble with all this is that Margenau does not understand the numbers, so he is giving the Republicans credit for being willing to talk about a problem that does not exist.</p>
<p>This is exactly what &#8220;liberals&#8221; have been doing:  searching, searching for a way to ease their bleeding hearts by solving the huge, terrible problem that only looks huge when you don&#8217;t understand the numbers.</p>
<p>Margenau cites the famous &#8220;in less than 20 years there will be only two workers supporting each retiree.&#8221; And he proposes &#8220;relatively modest changes&#8230; bumping up the retirement age..&#8221;</p>
<p>You may read his full essay at the place cited.  Easiest for me to simply reprint here the reply I sent to him. <br /><a name="more"></a><br />
<blockquote>&#8220;Tom,  Your heart is in the right place, but you miss the critical point.  Social Security is not welfare.  It is critically important that it   is not welfare.  FDR understood this so he made it &#8220;worker paid&#8221;   insurance, &#8220;so no damn pollitician can take it away from them.&#8221;  Social Security was never in trouble. </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p> All that 3 to 1 and 2 to 1   worker to retiree ratio is lying nonsense meant to impose on people   whose math skills are not very good.  What it amounts to is that if people are going to live longer&#8230;  say   20 years after working 40 years, instead of 13 years after   working 40 years, they will need to save about one third more each   month for their own retirement.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p> This means raising the payroll tax   from 6% to about 8%.  And since the change in life expectancy is not   going to happen all at once, it means we can raise the payroll tax   one half of one tenth of one percent each year. </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p> This is an increase of 40 cents per week for the average worker   today.  And while the increase gets bigger over time, so do wages. So   the increase will never be felt as more of a burden than that 40   cents per week.  AND the workers will get the money back, with   interest, so they can look forward to a longer retirement with better   benefits than today&#8217;s retirees. </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p> The Republicans were not being more responsible&#8230; they were telling   a Big Lie.  They could get away with it because the average person is   innumerate, and the average liberal no longer understands the   important difference between Social Security and welfare.  It is probably too late, but it would help if the people who think SS   is important at least understood the facts and the basic principle.</p></blockquote>
<p>Margenau replied to me that &#8220;the worker to beneficiary ratio is not lying nonsense.  It is critically important.&#8221;  And indeed it is.  It is fundamental.  But it doesn&#8217;t mean what he thinks it means.  All it means is that if we are going to live longer we are going to have to save more for our retirement. The &#8220;more&#8221; is not burdensome.</p>
<p>But working an extra year could be hell for many people.   Meanwhile, Our President, and his Friends Across the Aisle have killed Social Security.  They did it by the breathtakingly bold and easy step of just taking away its funding by calling for a &#8220;payroll tax holiday.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Democrats &#8230;Democrats!&#8230; are now running on the issue of making the payroll tax holiday permanent &#8220;to avoid a huge tax increase on the middle class.&#8221;  The lying is sickening.  But the people will go for it.  And the Republicans will cry,  &#8220;Oh no, not the briar patch!  Don&#8217;t throw me in dat briar patch Br&#8217;er Obama.&#8221;</p>
<p>And laugh up their sleeves while the &#8220;progressives&#8221; think they have scored a huge win for the poor.   And the poor will never understand what happened until they go to retire and learn they&#8217;ve had another year added on to their sentence, or have to go to the welfare office to prove they need &#8220;benefits,&#8221;  and they better bring a note from their doctor saying they only have one more year to live.</p>
<p>The only way out of this would be a sudden demand by a hundred million working people to &#8220;raise our taxes!  give us back our Social Security!&#8221;</p>
