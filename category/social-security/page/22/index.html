<p>In comments there were requests for a clear unitary narrative summing up my view of Social Security. This is more difficult than it sounds because of the competing narrative is so simple and compelling: Boomer retirement hits Social Security, the latter itself goes &#8216;Boom&#8217;, lets do something now to mitigate the blow. Okay but how hard is the hit, what is the actual result, and can we clarify &#8216;something&#8217;? And what are the underlying assumptions? Suddenly the story gets not so simple.</p>
<p>And the same is true in reverse. If I set out to tell a simple story readers who have internalized those underlying assumptions in the course of perusing that competing narrative tend to stop you at every turn with questions starting out &#8220;Everyone knows &#8230;&#8221; In order to forestall this process your story-telling has to get more complicated. But I&#8217;m willing to give the no frills, no caveat version below the fold.</p>
<p>Social Security was set up in 1935 as two programs. One under Title 1 was a straight out government pension system paid out of the general fund. Title 1 was designed to phase out in favor of a Title 2 worker funded insurance plan. It is this Title 2 insurance plan that we know as Social Security today.</p>
<p>Like most insurance plans there is no direct connection between the dollar paid in and the benefit paid out, instead what you are buying is coverage, once your actual premium dollar is collected it belongs to the company, or in this case government, and you have to trust that the results of THEIR investment decisions and continued flow of premiums will be sufficient to pay out all claims. In Social Security lingo this is called Pay-Go with a group of active workers paying premiums and a group of retired workers collecting benefits.</p>
<p>Social Security is obviously non-profit so it can and does keep its premium as low as possible and still be able to pay out benefits. Those premiums are credited into two accounts at the Treasury Department: the Old Age/Survivors Trust Fund (OAS) and the Disability Insurance Trust Fund (DI). For reasons of convenience these are normally reported together as the OASDI Trust Fund, but legally they are quite separate and have different degrees of solvency. Currently OAS is more solvent than DI and overall is ten times larger, meaning that changes to it have a much greater effect on the health of the overall system.</p>
<p>Under the Act the Trustees are mandated to target Short Term and Long Term Actuarial Balance which is defined as having one year of reserves projected for the next 10 years or 75 years respectively. This is expressed in terms of a Trust Fund Ratio where 100=1 year. Currently DI is projected to drop below 100 sometime in 2017 en route to a total depletion date in 2025. Therefore it is in neither Short Term or Long Term Balance. OAS is projected to not drop below 100 until the late 2030s en route to depletion in 2042 meaning that it is in Short Term Balance but out of Long Term. The combined OASDI is, due to the larger size of OAS, roughly equivalent with Short Term Balance projected to fail in about 2029 when the 10th year (2038) projects to fall below 100 en route to a depletion in 2041. But for most purposes the Trustees deal with the combined OASDI numbers and talk about THE Social Security Trust Fund as do almost all commentators.</p>
<p>Social Security first had a TF ratio below 100 in 1971 and despite reform efforts in 1977 was on track for total depletion in 1983. We should note that Trust Fund Depletion does not equate to &#8216;No Check&#8217;, as long as FICA is collected there will be some payout. In fact there was no year before 1983 where interest on the Trust Fund accounted for more than 5% of total revenue. Still this was considered to be enough of a problem that the President and Congress appointed a 15 person commission known after its chairman as the Greenspan Commission. They studied the issue and set forth four different scenarios for the future. There was a more optimistic Low Cost model, a more pessimistic High Cost model and two Intermediate Cost ones. It was determined that a package of tax increases and changes in retirement age would under Intermediate Cost assumptions put the system back into Short Term Balance by the end of a ten year period and would ON AVERAGE do the same for the 75 year Long Term actuarial window.</p>
<p>The Greenspan Commission Plan worked, by 1993 the Trust Fund ratio was back above 100. This doesn&#8217;t mean everything was solved, the numbers still showed the TF going to depletion in around 2030 meaning that it would fall out of Short Term balance sometime late in the 2010s. Which left the people of 1993 the freedom to plan in leisure.<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/VI_cyoper_history.html#159726">Table VI.A4.—Historical Operations of the Combined OASI and DI Trust Funds, Calendar Years 1957-2007 [Amounts in billions]</a><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/VI_OASDHI_dollars.html#150920">Table VI.F8.—Operations of the Combined OASI and DI Trust Funds, in Current Dollars, Calendar Years 2008-85 [In billions]</a></p>
<p>As it turns out they had more time than they thought. Actual economic performance after 1996 came in at or better than the more optimistic Low Cost model projected. And given that Low Cost projected no Trust Fund Depletion at all, that is it would have Social Security be fully funded with no change in benefits, taxation or retirement age, it seemed that a plan of &#8216;Nothing&#8217; was fully justified or at least the adoption of &#8216;Watch and wait&#8217; was perfectly defensible. By 2004 the projected date of Trust Fund depletion had advanced from the 2029 of the 1997 Report to 2042, an improvement of 14 years in outlook over an 8 year span. Given that the &#8216;There is no Crisis&#8217; movement of early 2005 had little trouble turning back the privatizers.</p>
<p>In the years since not much has happened to shake our faith in maintaining a &#8216;Watch and wait&#8217; approach to Social Security. Although Trust Fund depletion stopped moving out in time and is now set for 2041 the combined Trust Fund will still be in short term actuarial balance until 2029 and at that point leaving us with 12 years to plan and implement a fix. People who argue &#8216;We can&#8217;t afford to wait&#8217; have been proven wrong every year since 1997. We can and should stay alert and monitor the numbers but nothing currently justifies changes in taxation, retirement age, or the benefit formula. Until or unless privatizers can make the case for &#8216;crisis&#8217; using real numbers rather than talking points they should be pushed back.</p>
<p>Well that is the simple story, or as simple as I can make it. There is a competing narrative marked by what I conceive to be myths. I attempted some myth busting this morning on my site <a target="_blank" href="http://bruceweb.blogspot.com/2009/02/social-security-2009-myth-busting.html">Social Security: 2009 Myth Busting edition</a>. No one has to read it but for those who are considering comments starting &#8220;Don&#8217;t you know&#8230;&#8221; well the odds are that I am familiar with your claim, have examined the evidence pro and con and have rightfully or wrongly dismissed it already. Though I will be happy to recapitulate my argument.</p>

<p>People in comments on some of the previous threads have what are on the surface reasonable questions. These questions fall in part into two categories. Some long time followers of the Angry Bear Social Security series ask &#8216;Why are you still talking about this, we get it already&#8217;. While newcomers ask (and not always nicely) &#8216;Why are you making this so complicated, I don&#8217;t get it, it doesn&#8217;t match what I know, meaning I suspect you are just making it up.&#8217; Well it is hard to satisfy both at the same time. So lets back up.</p>
<p>This series started when Dan invited me in May 2008 to present a comprehensive outline of my thinking and research on Social Security since 1997. I put forth the basic outline in posts 1-12 as listed on this index page at my blog <a target="_blank" href="http://bruceweb.blogspot.com/2008/05/social-security-posts-on-angry-bear.html">Social Security Posts on Angry Bear</a> About at this point I realized I was losing people so I put up a recap with <a target="_blank" href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/05/social-security-zero-basics-revisited.html">The Basics Revisited &#038; Three Myths</a>. The series continued in a more topical and less linear form alternating between discussion of then candidate Obama&#8217;s proposals to raise the cap and discussions about how and why the larger narrative on Social Security came to be. Was it really an economic argument about the best way to achieve retirement security? Or just a way of dismantling the centerpiece of the New Deal? Well I argued the latter, in my view all of this is driven by ideology.</p>
<p>In any event the series carried on (and further indexed on <a target="_blank" href="http://bruceweb.blogspot.com/2008/06/more-social-security-posts-from-angry.html">More Social Security Posts from Angry Bear</a>) through 33 where I basically ran out of new topics. Which didn&#8217;t stop the series instead it continued in more reactive form with me responding to other blog posts and new documents until I kind of wrapped up after 44 on August 16 with this from a post on my site:<br />
<blockquote>In May I was invited to post on Social Security at Angry Bear. It was pretty rewarding and I have to thank rdan for the opportunity.</p>
<p>The series terminates with no. 44 not because I really have nothing left to say but instead that proceeding further kind of requires that people had been following along all the way, newcomers being kind of lost. So on the odd chance that anyone would like to read the whole series they are indexed in Social Security Posts on Angry Bear and More Social Security Posts from Angry Bear</p></blockquote>
<p> Well it didn&#8217;t really terminate, instead there were 11 more posts in fall including some renewed discussion of &#8216;backwards transfer&#8217; and &#8216;unfunded liability&#8217; (which I argued were distortions meant to confuse the real issues) as seen indexed here <a target="_blank" href="http://bruceweb.blogspot.com/2009/01/even-more-posts-from-angry-bear-late.html">Even More Posts from Angry Bear</a> until I terminated the series AGAIN with the election. At this point it was blindingly clear that we were in major, major economic trouble and with Democrats in firm control surely no one would waste an instant talking about a program whose problems if any could well be addressed starting around 2029 (date not chosen at random).</p>
<p>Well I couldn&#8217;t have been more wrong because in January it became clear that the Social Security haters hadn&#8217;t given up. Instead they set out to make a new run which led me to put up this post on Jan. 19th <a target="_blank" href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/01/social-security-reform-undead-return.html">Social Security &#8216;Reform&#8217;: the Undead Return</a><br />
<blockquote>What does it take? A stake through the heart? A bullet through the brain? Baker and Krugman do some push-back.</p></blockquote>
<p>And after letting the maestros have their say wrapped up the post as follows:<br />
<blockquote>In my view it is practically criminal for policy makers to be wasting a second talking about Social Security given the very real possibility we are headed for a new Great Depression. And so equally criminal for opinion makers to be twisting current events to pursue this old vendetta. It is a shame that people like Baker and Krugman still have to keep a vigilant eye out for the zombies intent on eating the flesh of Social Security. Maybe we can make a deal. If the Right will simply stop taking every possible opportunity to take a bite at Social Security then I promise to shut up. And then maybe we can let Krugman and Baker continue the really important discussion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Social Security &#8216;reformers&#8217;! Report back to your graves!&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p> Well that deal stands, yet the undead still walk among us leading to this upcoming (Mar 2nd) article by Grieder in The Nation <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thenation.com/doc/20090302/greider?rel=hp_currently">Looting Social Security</a> which I linked to and commented on with <a target="_blank" href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/02/looting-social-security-basics.html">Looting Social Security: (the Basics Revisited, Again)</a> on Friday Feb 13th. Posts since then have simply been commentary on issues raised in comments.</p>
<p>So the answer to the question &#8216;Why are you still talking about this?&#8217; The answer is that the Right didn&#8217;t take my offered deal, instead they are still gnawing away. And &#8216;Why are you making this so complicated?&#8217; Well it is a complicated subject and I can&#8217;t always slow down to give remedial lessons to latecomers. It bores the people who have been following along. We welcome people who want to join the conversation, but realize that like in any seminar if you haven&#8217;t done the reading you should set quietly or put it in the form of a question. Because assuming the teacher is a dimwit who doesn&#8217;t know the simplest thing may well end up with you getting your knuckles rapped plus a reading assignment.</p>
<p>Those who want to avoid the knuckle rapping would be well advised to read post 1 in the series and the two linked &#8216;Basics Revisited&#8217; ones. Because you may not in fact know what you think you know on Social Security.</p>

                                <p>by Bruce Webb</p>
<p>In a variety of comments posts I have argued that the 1983 Social Security compromise was not intended specifically to prefund Boomer retirement using several pieces of evidence including this interview with the Executive Director of the Commission <a target="_blank" href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/06/soc-sec-xxvii-robert-myers-and.html">Robert Myers and Prefunding Social Security</a>. Now as it turns out current projections indeed show that Boomer retirement has largely been financed; whether we use SSA&#8217;s date of 2041 or CBO&#8217;s date of 2049 the very youngest Boomers will be 77 or 85 while leading edge Boomers will be, er, dead. Given that in point of fact Boomers carried their own load and did pre-fund their own retirement, why not just say that this was part of the plan all along if that helps us win the argument? Well, a couple of reasons come to mind, but the biggest one is that by using this line of argument you risk falling into a Glibertarian trap by building their assumptions in. To see how this works we need to tell the same story from two perspectives.</p>
<p>Supporters of traditional Social Security tell the story this way:<br />1) The 1983 compromise raised payroll tax to pay for Boomer Retirement<br />2) But starting with Reagan the federal government just borrowed the money to spend on other things.<br />3) Meaning that any attempt to delay or avoid paying it back by cutting benefits is simple theft from workers.</p>
<p>While the conclusion is true and seems to flow naturally from the premises, the premises are themselves fatally flawed as we begin to see from the same story told from the anti-Social Security Glibertarian perspective. Note the changes along the way.</p>
<p>1) The 1983 compromise raised payroll tax with promises to save the extra for Boomer retirement.<br />2) This was a lie, instead the federal government just borrowed the money to spend on other things.<br />3) Tax and spend democrats also made no efforts to restrain other spending putting us in a position where we will never be able to pay Social Security back, overall debt being too high.<br />4) Meaning that younger workers will never see a penny from Social Security, it all going to the selfish  Boomers who ran up the debt.<br />5) And only chumps would have believed it would happen any other way. Because Big Government is never the Solution.<br />6) This wouldn&#8217;t have happened if the money had instead been put in private accounts safe from the government.<br />7) Though it is too late for Gen-X to recoup the losses why throw good money after bad, instead we should salvage what we can be going to private accounts today. After all something is better than nothing.<br />8) And if this means screwing over the Boomers? Too bad, they got us into this mess. And older generations? Well heck they got more out than they ever put in. (ed. the Backwards Transfer argument)</p>
<p>Now each and everyone of the steps in the Glibertarian argument are subject to challenge. But the door was open to it as soon as supporters in their own step 2 start out with &#8216;But&#8217; which puts in play the argument that you just can&#8217;t trust government to keep its promises. And this extends it self to both parties because the borrowing continued through Congresses and White Houses controlled alternately by both Democrats and Republicans.</p>
<p>Not every supporter of Social Security holds Social Democratic views. Indeed we have commenters who are convinced we should leave Social Security alone that lean in what I consider Reactionary directions (using &#8216;Reaction&#8217; in its European sense) and wouldn&#8217;t be caught dead identifying themselves as Democrats.</p>
<p>But I am both a partisan Democrat and someone pushing an overall Social Democratic agenda and won&#8217;t accept the starting point of &#8216;both parties are equally guilty&#8217;. Because they are not. In my view President Reagan did immense damage to this country. On the other hand he turned out to be an excellent steward for Social Security. Also in my view the first President Bush started out in some wrong directions only to realize that his original judgement back in 1980 was correct: Supply Side economics is in fact Voodoo Economics. (His late term tax increase may have doomed his re-election but helped prime the pump for the Clinton economy, and liberals give him too little credit for at least moving back in the right direction.) He too was an excellent steward for Social Security and in fact handed it over to Clinton with a Trust Fund right where it was supposed to be. On December 31st 2000 the TF ratio was 97, by Inaugeration day it would have been so close to the legal mandate of 100 as to not matter.</p>
<p>The real goal of the 1983 Commission had nothing to do with the specific timing of Boomer retirement. Per the interview linked above its first priority was to address the near term, which  Social Security  scores over a ten year window, with a secondary priority to be able to say that they had also addressed the long term, which Social Security scores over a seventy-five year window. They had neither the time or the intent to address specific intervals between the ten and seventy-five year window. So I intend to reject both the traditional supporter narrative of &#8216;theft&#8217; and the Glibertarian equivalent &#8216;government is always the problem&#8217; and tell the story my way. Below the fold.</p>
<p>1) By the late seventies it was clear that Social Security was headed to near term insolvency. The trend was undeniable, the TF ratio dipped below 100 in 1971 and simply continued to shrink through the next decade.<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/VI_cyoper_history.html#159726">Table VI.A4.—Historical Operations of the Combined OASI and DI Trust Funds, Calendar Years 1957-2007 [Amounts in billions]</a><br />2) When Reagan took the oath Social Security&#8217;s reserves were below three months (TF ratio of 25) and steadily bleeding. If nothing was done it would mean cutting benefit checks sometime in 1983.<br />3) Something was done. Reagan who would have liked to transform Social Security into something else concluded he had no real hope of doing so near term and so cut a deal with Tip O&#8217;Neill to create a Bi-Partisan Commission.<br />4) The Commission with the help of the technical staff at SSA developed four economic models a High Cost, a Low Cost, and two Intermediate Cost. Under Low Cost the whole problem would go away, under Intermediate Cost the problem would be solved for the first 10 years and ON AVERAGE for the next 75.<br />5) Because the immediate crisis was not Boomer&#8217;s starting retirement 25 years out, instead it was the looming shortfall in the very next year that would cause current checks to Greatest Generation retirees to get cut. It was not a matter of pre-funding but of funding period. (This part simply not being understood today).<br />6) The tax increases were phased in with the final piece not to be in place until 1990. This allowed benefits to be paid near term while slowly building the Trust Fund back to its mandated target of 100.<br />7) Since a TF ratio of 100 was simply considered the minimum buffer for operational safety against a temporary downturn, the excess of revenue over cost was kept in a safe and predictable instrument sheltered from market movements which is to say interest earning, non-marketable Special Treasuries. While diversification into other asset classes could be considered it wouldn&#8217;t be prudent to do that with the first year of reserves because a temporary drop in employment and hence current revenues was likely to coincide with a market downturn and so be exactly the wrong time to be selling equities.<br />8) (And this is important) Given that a TF ratio of 100 was considered to be a minimum to protect CURRENT benefits any year the TF ratio remained under 100 the overall system could hardly even be considered to be in surplus and so was not really pre-funding anything, and certainly not events 25 and more years out.<br />9) Between Reagan and Bush Social Security was returned to a TF ratio of 100 within a ten year period and Clinton inherited a clean short term slate.<br />10) Although the short term problem was solved, newer more detailed Reports showed that when you broke out the 75 year long term window that there remained some mid-term problems. In particular the retirement of Boomers starting in 2008 projected to take the TF to depletion sometime around 2030.<br />11) And even though the economy after the mid-nineties started sending the Unified Budget to surplus, much of that was due to rapidly growing TF surpluses after 1996, the challenge of funding Social Security in 2030 had not gone away.<br />12) Meaning that Republican demands for tax cuts were at best premature, and remained so even after it looked like the General Fund side would itself go to surplus. Instead the prudent thing would be to pay down debt held by the public in anticipation of new borrowing needs starting in the mid 2010&#8217;s.<br />13) Leading to the calls to &#8216;Save Social Security First&#8217;.<br />14) Meaning Reagan, Bush and Clinton all did the right thing when it came to Social Security, the first two restoring it to actuarial balance using Special Treasuries as the natural and safe instrument, and the latter preserving Social Security from being the cover for a short sighted set of tax cuts that would simply make things more difficult down the road.<br />15) Something that Bush II simply ignored in his desire to reward his base, as he so charmingly explained at the Oct 2000 Al Smith dinner. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2000/10/18/politics/main242210.shtml">Dueling Jokes At Dinner Of NY Political Elite</a><br />
<blockquote>Bush gazed around the diamond-studded $800-a-plate crowd and commented on the wealth on display.<br />&#8220;This is an impressive crowd &#8211; the haves and the have-mores,&#8221; quipped the GOP standard-bearer. &#8220;Some people call you the elites; I call you my base.&#8221; </p></blockquote>
<p> Insert hollow laugh here. Because he meant it.</p>
<p>Okay my story is a little longer than the supporters nice little three step one. And has the virtue of being actually true. But its real virtue is that it wholy undercuts the Glibertarian narrative. Taking it point by point:<br />1. The tax increase was not designed to pay for Boomer retirement. Indeed that specific question didn&#8217;t come up.<br />2. Nobody lied about anything. Instead they set in place a ten-year plan to restore Short Term Actuarial Balance using the same instrument the Trust Fund had pretty much always used: interest earning Special Treasuries<br />3. The General Fund deficits of the eighties were not the sole responsibility of the Democrats. Indeed they generally passed spending bills calling for less spending than Reagan asked for, just differently allocated. Those deficits were caused by Reagan&#8217;s insistence on buying guns and giving the wealthy tax cuts at the same time.<br />4. Starting in 2041 Gen-Xers MAY start receiving benefits only 25% better than current retirees do, down from a 60% benefit under the schedule. The idea that Social Security &#8216;will not be there for me&#8217; and that this is the fault of Boomers being a combination of ignorance of the numbers and inability to read a calender. The Boomers not only covered the mid-eighties shortages looming over the Greatest Generations benefit checks, we also ended up (more or less by happy accident) covering the projected gaps in our own. Mainly because we grew the economy more than lazy ass Gen-X slackers are projected to do.<br />5. Sorry pal, when it comes to securing retirement security for workers and particularly workers earning below the median Social Security instead shows that Government often can be a huge part of the solution.<br />6. Sorry again, there is no realistic scenario under which government operated PRAs would be legally more protected than the current system of Pay-Go. Only people who have beliefs that labels like &#8216;private&#8217; have magical powers would think so. Even if the accounts were in total control of the individual (something that is in no actual privatization plan out there), government can always operate in a way that destroys wealth. Take a look at your 401k.<br />7. Dude you haven&#8217;t lost anything. And nobody has devised a PRA plan does not simply screw over earlier generations.<br />8. Though apparently you don&#8217;t care that come what may you will make out better than the Greatest Generation did. Instead you would rather whine that Ida Mae Fuller lived to be a hundred. Well I suggest the selfish one is the guy staring back at you out of the mirror.</p>
<p>So once you abandon the ideas that in 1983 the point was pre-funding Boomers and that Reagan, Bush I and Clinton did something wrong by putting excess revenues in Special Treasuries (and so spending the actual cash on other stuff)  the whole Glibertarian case falls apart. While leaving those ideas to stay allows them to <br />validate their &#8216;all governments are inherently made up of thieves and liars&#8217; narrative.</p>
<p>That is why the Pre-funding myth is dangerous. At least to those of us with a Social Democratic agenda. It tends to block any idea of funding specific public goods (like universal single coverage) with any dedicated tax stream and promotes the idea that all taxation is fungible.</p>

                                <p>by Bruce Webb</p>
<p>A couple of commenters here have inquired about how Social Security would fare in a time of extended recession. And the really short answer is &#8216;not too badly, mostly it self-adjusts&#8217;. But the questions reveal a profound misunderstanding of the real nature of the Trust Funds and their relation to Social Security solvency. So before talking about the self-adjustment we need to step back a bit and consider what the Trust Funds really are.</p>
<p>Most of the confusion comes from thinking that the Trust Funds are an investment instrument. Which confusion is compounded by the belief that this &#8216;investment instrument&#8217; was created in the course of the 1983 Reform as a temporary measure to at least in part handle the challenge of Boomer retirement. Neither is true.</p>
<p>Taking the latter point first. The Trust Fund was established with the original Social Security Act something that can be easily seen by the heading of the first  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/history/reports/trust/tf1941.html">Report to Congress</a> in 1941.<br />
<blockquote>Board of Trustees of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund,<br />Washington, D.C. January 3, 1941</p>
<p>We have the honor to transmit to you the First Report of the Board of Trustees of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund, in compliance with the provisions of section 201(b) of the Social Security Act, as amended.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Trust Funds have grown and shrunk over time when expressed as a ratio of reserve to cost and have always earned interest but were never, ever intended to be an investment instrument, not in 1936, not in 1983, and not now. Which makes arguments about ROI irrelevant in context, people are letting the earnings tail wag the Pay-Go dog. To get a better idea of what the function of the Trust Fund really is you need to follow me under the fold.</p>
<p>The Trust Funds are best thought of as two interest earning savings accounts. Each month they are automatically credited with receipts from taxation of wages and benefits, and each month they are debited for benefits paid out, and then are credited again for interest on the balance giving in turn a new balance. And really that is all the regular taxpayer beneficiary needs to know, the money is in the bank and guaranteed by the Federal Government just as your savings are in a FDIC bank. In normal times people need not worry about how the bank handles the money, even if it goes broke your holdings are insured. Well the same is true for Social Security, the Trust Funds operationally being just savings accounts insured by the government.</p>
<p>But of course these are not normal times and banks are failing at a rapid rate. Moreover those that still survive are choking on instruments routinely described as &#8216;toxic waste&#8217;. So it is no wonder people worry about the security of the instruments backing up the Trust Fund. Are the Special Treasuries that actually make the Trust Fund up real? And are they safe?</p>
<p>Well yes and yes. Largely because what is by many seen as a weakness is actually their strength. Special Treasuries are like regular Treasuries notes that have fixed face values and interest rates. Unlike regular Treasuries they are not marketable. Which leads some to claim they are not real &#8216;assets&#8217; at all. This is to get things backwards. Because the Social Security Trustees always hold these notes to maturity their value is always and exactly the face value and the yield is exactly equal to the stated interest rate. Which means that the existing portfolio is sheltered from fluctuations in the outside bond market. You could sum this up with the phrase &#8216;No market. No mark to market.&#8217; The Trust Funds as such cannot be wiped out absent the total collapse of Full Faith and Credit of the United States. Which maybe could happen but would leave us with much bigger things to worry about than future retirement security.</p>
<p>This doesn&#8217;t mean that the Trust Funds are totally immune to economic downturn. Each year a portion of the Trust Fund portfolio of Special Treasuries matures and if Social Security is in surplus immediately reinvested in new ones at current interest rates. If we examine the actual portfolio of in this case OAS (Old Age Survivors) we will see that bonds that matured in 2008 had interest rates ranging from 3.5% to 7.25% <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/VI_cyoper_history.html#152208">Table VI.A5.—Assets of the OASI Trust Fund, End of Calendar Years 2006 and 2007[In thousands]</a>. To the extent that these had to be replaced by new ones with lower rates than predicted when the year began then Social Security takes a mild future hit. But only on the difference in rates on the relatively small portion of the portfolio that matured last year, none of this has any effect on say the $27,311,591,000 in 2009 bonds that are still yielding 7.25%.</p>
<p>But even that is to obscure the story somewhat. In 2008 Social Security ran a cash surplus of about $80 billion dollars from the excess of receipts from taxation over cost. To which we would add about $100 billion in accrued interest for a total increase in the Trust Fund of $180.9 billion. This compares to a original projection of $196.2 billion. So we have $15.3 billion less in principal than expected plus some new additions to the portfolio with a somewhat less than expected yield on bonds issued over the course of the year. But $15.3 billion amounts to just 0.6% of the existing Trust Fund balance. Even if we do hit 9% unemployment for most of 2009 that would probably mean no more than roughly triple that amount less in projected year end balances. That is against an Intermediate Cost projection of $2.647 trillion we might end up with something closer to $2.59 trillion. Which is still a Trust Fund in overall surplus, something that is maybe not as likely for your 401k over the same period.</p>
<p>As long as Social Security is in cash surplus the variation in earnings on the Trust Fund balances is mostly irrelevant, it has some implications for solvency in around 2040 but really nothing for current recipients to worry about and not really much for people approaching retirement. Even an extended period of slow growth doesn&#8217;t change that fact much because Social Security still is what it almost always has been, a Pay-Go system.</p>
<p>Now as to self-adjustment. A normal recession is marked both by low inflation or even deflation and higher levels of unemployment. And the latter might well have an effect on real wage. But these interact in complex ways when it comes to judging solvency in a Pay-Go system.</p>
<p>Unemployment directly reduces revenues in exact proportion to wages not paid, that is 12.4% of payroll dollars not collected.</p>
<p>Flat real wages also reduces revenues when compared to baseline assumptions. But given that initial retirement benefits are set by real wage over the worker&#8217;s work life, flat real wages reduce future costs.</p>
<p>Low inflation reduces costs short term in that current benefits are adjusted annually for inflation. It also serves to lower costs long term because it lowers the benefit baseline that will exist at the end of the period of inflation. While it is possible that a sharp and continuing period of growth after recovery would add those costs back in, it might not. For example the strong improvement in Social Security outlook experienced in the late 1990s was the result of a fortuitous combination of high employment and low inflation that put revenues above projected baselines and costs below.</p>
<p>Under normal conditions the various formulas that set initial benefits to real wage and continuing benefits to inflation combine to deliver a pretty steady state outcome for Social Security when taken in terms of income replacement. Social Security recipients now and in the future see their fortunes mostly rising and falling as the economy does, benefitting from or suffering somewhat in much the same way their grandchildren do.</p>
<p>But let me finish with a caveat. The late 90s were great for Social Security-high employment and real wage increases combined with low inflation took an outlook that in 1996 still merited the word &#8216;crisis&#8217; or at least &#8216;pending problem&#8217; and mostly erased it for good. On the other hand the late 70s took a Social Security system that had been pretty stable for decades and almost put it into the ditch. This was due to stagflation where the combination of high inflation increasing costs and slow growth decreasing revenues put Social Security right on a path for Trust Fund depletion. If we enter a new period of stagflation triggered by something like another oil shock then all bets are off. But then again your equity investments will probably not be looking rosy either.</p>
<p>So Social Security can well weather even a prolonged recession. But neither it or us will fare well in a perma-depression. A lot depends on whether the various Obama plans for banks/stimulus/universal coverage/energy independence work. Which is where everyone should be focusing their attention and not on some time-wasting &#8216;Entitlements Summit&#8217;.</p>

                                <p>Mark Thoma at Economist&#8217;s View links us to the following article from William Grieder at The Nation.<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.thenation.com/doc/20090302/greider?rel=hp_currently">Looting Social Security</a><br />
<blockquote>Governing elites in Washington and Wall Street have devised a fiendishly clever &#8220;grand bargain&#8221; they want President Obama to embrace in the name of &#8220;fiscal responsibility.&#8221; The government, they argue, having spent billions on bailing out the banks, can recover its costs by looting the Social Security system. They are also targeting Medicare and Medicaid. The pitch sounds preposterous to millions of ordinary working people anxious about their economic security and worried about their retirement years. But an impressive armada is lined up to push the idea&#8211;Washington&#8217;s leading think tanks, the prestige media, tax-exempt foundations, skillful propagandists posing as economic experts and a self-righteous billionaire spending his fortune to save the nation from the elderly.</p></blockquote>
<p> The &#8220;self-righteous billionaire&#8221; is of course our old friend Peter. G. Peterson. How do they propose to do this? With the oldest trick in the book, get some corporate funded think tankers from the center, combine them with corporate funded think tankers from the right and call the effort &#8216;bi-partisan&#8217;.<br />
<blockquote>Peterson&#8217;s proposal would essentially dismantle the Social Security entitlement enacted in the New Deal, much as Bill Clinton repealed the right to welfare. Peterson has assembled influential allies for this radical step. They include a coalition of six major think tanks and four tax-exempt foundations.<br />Their report&#8211;<u>Taking Back Our Fiscal Future</u>, issued jointly by the Brookings Institution and the Heritage Foundation&#8211;recommends that Congress put long-term budget caps on Social Security and other entitlement spending, which would automatically trigger benefits cuts if needed to stay within the prescribed limits. The same antidemocratic mechanisms&#8211;a commission of technocrats and limited Congressional discretion&#8211;would shield politicians from popular blowback.<br />The authors of this plan are sixteen economists from Brookings and Heritage, joined by the American Enterprise Institute, the Concord Coalition, the New America Foundation, the Progressive Policy Institute and the Urban Institute. &#8220;Our group covers the ideological spectrum,&#8221; they claim. This too is a falsehood. All these organizations are corporate-friendly and dependent on big-money contributors. No liberal or labor thinkers need apply, though the group includes some formerly liberal economists like Robert Reischauer, Alice Rivlin and Isabel Sawhill.</p></blockquote>
<p>The report itself can be found here <a target="_blank" href="http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Files/rc/papers/2008/04_fiscal_future/04_fiscal_future.pdf">Taking Back our Fiscal Future</a> but really there is nothing new here, just a recitation of the standard talking points.</p>
<p>A commenter at my blog asked me if I could just put the case for &#8216;Nothing&#8217; as a plan for Social Security in a condensed form and I had to confess &#8216;Well no, in fact my effort to explain this has reached 66 posts&#8217; <a target="_blank" href="http://bruceweb.blogspot.com/2008/08/angry-bear-social-security-series.html">Angry Bear Social Security Series</a> but what the heck I&#8217;ll try to boil it down under the fold.<br />Bottom line: Social Security does not need to be fixed anytime in the next 18 years. We don&#8217;t need to increase retirement ages, we don&#8217;t need to lift the payroll cap (and I don&#8217;t care how progressive that sounds). Fundamentally it is not broken.</p>
<p>1. If you grant the critics every economic and demographic assumption the payroll gap is currently 1.7%. Don&#8217;t let them spook you with percentages of GDP or anything else, do the arithmetic. If we assume the employer/employee split holds the cost of a permanent fix for a household earning $50,000 is $425 per year. When you see any other plan proposed ask yourself if the combination of benefit cuts and tax increases is more or less than that. If it is more then why bother? (Hint generally it is much more with not much better results.)</p>
<p>2. Initial benefits under Social Security increase with real wage which prior to Bush II have tended to increase over time. Meaning Social Security is a mildly better deal each year when measured as a basket of goods (the income replacement percentage stays pretty constant). Under the current schedule the benefit in 2040, the last year when full benefits are projected to be paid, would be 160% of the 2009 benefit. In 2041 it would have to be reset to 78% of that. As Prof. Rosser of JMU pointed out to me long ago 78% of 160% is 125%. Well actually that is not precisely right, when he presented me with what I call Rosser&#8217;s Equation the projected cut was to 75% giving us 75% of 160% = 120%. In any event that is what &#8216;Crisis&#8217; is in numeric context, a real benefit 25% better than the one my Mom gets today.</p>
<p>3. The improvement from a 75% benefit to a 78% benefit simply tracks other metrics. In 1997 the Trust Fund was projected to go to depletion in 2029 and the fix was an immediate increase in payroll taxes of 2.23%. With the 2008 Report that date had been pushed back to 2041 and the gap down to <s>2.23%</s> 1.7% (h/t Arne) . I am sure there is an apt word for a problem that left unaddressed gets pushed back in time and whose cost to fix shrinks. That word is not crisis.</p>
<p>4. Under the various Social Security Acts the health of Social Security is measured in terms of Short Term and Long Term Actuarial Balance. Moreover the two components of OAS (Old Age Survivors) and DI (Disability Insurance) are officially tracked separately. Meaning when Dean Baker or me tell you Social Security is fully funded until 2041 (SSA) or 2049 (CBO) we are mildly fibbing. Because DI is scheduled to run out somewhat before OAS. But the Trustees talk in the same terms, they talk about the combined Trust Funds running out at some fixed date requiring an immediate cut. But that is not how the system actually works.</p>
<p>The Trust Funds are typically scored by Trust Fund Ratio which is simply the ratio of the TF balance to projected cost in any given year where 100=1 year. If the combined Trust Funds are projected to have TF ratios over 100 in each of the following 10 years they are deemed to be in Short Term Actuarial Balance. If the combined TFs are projected to have TF ratios over 100 in each of the following 75 years they are deemed to be in Long Term Actuarial Balance. Officially the Trustees are mandated to alert Congress when they TFs go out of Short Term Actuarial Balance so that they can consider adjusting the tax/benefit ratio. Which is to say it is unlikely that the Trust Funds will ever go to Depletion or that there would ever be a wrenching dislocation. Instead the country would have ten plus years to plan and adjust after the TFs fall out of balance.</p>
<p>As noted above the actual date of Trust Fund depletion and so the time that the TFs fall out of Short Term Balance has been steadily pushed back in time and in fact at a combined rate that suggests at least a strong possibility that it will never actually happen. In fact there is a reasonably plausible scenario provided by the Trustees that would have Social Security left unaddressed be much overfunded after mid-century. This scenario which is called Low Cost would have us soon debating whether the best policy was to cut FICA or increase benefits. Which needless to say is a conversation that 99.9% of the population doesn&#8217;t even dream possible.</p>
<p>So I suggest that there is a logical time to move on Social Security which is in fact dictated by current law. We can and should wait until the Trust Funds actually fall out of balance which is to say 9 years before the TF ratio is projected to fall below 100. Under current projections that date is set at about 2038 meaning we would need to start planning to adjust the system around 2029. Unless of course things continue to improve.</p>
<p>But there is exactly no reason to move on this in the near future. Because those that insist that &#8216;we can&#8217;t afford to wait&#8217; and &#8216;delay will only make the fix harder&#8217; are dead wrong. Because 12 years of delay have left us with a much smaller projected fix.<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/VI_OASDHI_dollars.html#150920">Table IV.B3.—Estimated Trust Fund Ratios, Calendar Years 2008-85[In percent]</a></p>

                                <p>A reader in comments asked why the Bears had not posted on Obama&#8217;s stimulus plan.</p>
<p>Well, speaking for myself, that was mostly because we didn&#8217;t have a plan and still don&#8217;t. What we have is the shifting outline of a plan subject to negotiation between the Admin and the Congress, leaving no solid starting point for analysis. But the two Houses have now produced fairly detailed individual plans that do provide such a starting point. In this post I want to examine the Senate&#8217;s proposed individual tax cuts. First outlining the plans and then posing a series of questions.</p>
<p>The tax cuts come in two forms. For workers we have a proposal for a $500 tax cut per worker, $1000 per couple for 2 years, to be delivered via a payroll tax holiday on the first $8100 for each worker. This represents the employee share of the tax (6.2% x $8100 = $496), so it would seem that the employer still pays his full share. Unemployed workers would get this in the form of a refundable tax cut delivered via the IRS. The total cost of this plan is $142 billion or $71 bn per year with probably 90% of that delivered via SSA and the remainder via IRS. But it also seems to assume a two-earner household.</p>
<p>Then the Senate added a one time $300 bonus for seniors, the disabled, and people receiving SSI. The AP article I am using doesn&#8217;t score this out but given that just under 50 million people were receiving Social Security retirement of disability in 2007 this should work out to $15 billion on the OASDI side plus some more for the SSI people.</p>
<p>Seems simple enough? Well not from where I am sitting, I see all kinds of red flags. Details below the fold.</p>
<p>Update: (rdan&#8230; <a href="http://econospeak.blogspot.com/2009/01/galbraith-part-2-on-can-obamanomics.html">Barkley Rosser</a> notes Jamie Galbaith&#8217;s interview on entitlements at Econospeak and also see <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/agenda/seniors_and_social_security/">Whitehouse.gov</a>)</p>
<p>Currently payroll taxes got  to pay for Social Security and Medicare Part A with any cash surpluses credited to the Trust Funds where in turn they draw interest against the time when the Trust Funds need to start being tapped. Which under Intermediate Cost assumptions is 2017. In 2008 the cash surplus for Social Security was right around $80 billion. Given current unemployment numbers we can expect 2009 to come in below that, perhaps $20-30 billion less. If that is right this proposal would more than wipe out the first year surplus ($57 bn plus $15 bn) and likely wipe out the 2010 as well ($57 bn). Unless the Trust Funds are somehow made whole you have blown a big hole in Social Security, because not only will it have lost the cash surplus, it also will lose out on all accrued interest on that, which with compounding adds up to a pretty big total hit to a program whose &#8216;crisis&#8217; is marked by a gap between projected revenue and projected costs after 2017.</p>
<p>This doesn&#8217;t bode well for the financial summit next month. Because it would seem that the initial response to &#8216;crisis&#8217; is to choke off revenue which in turn brings Trust Fund shortfall closer and deeper. Which would seem to grease the slide for a benefit cut based &#8216;solution&#8217;. Was Social Security a &#8216;Phony Crisis&#8217; as Dean Baker insisted in 1999? Well in certainly was and that was still mostly true in 2008. But it looks like someone is trying to make it real through the back door.</p>
<p>Now it is possible that the proposal does aim to make Social Security whole. But this raises some issues of its own. Social Security as currently configured has no way to hold cash, so a direct transfer from the Treasury is out of the question. The program could be changed in a way that allowed the Treasury to use cash to purchase outside assets and so credit those to the Trust Funds but this would require opening up Social Security itself to all kinds of malicious tinkering, and so probably should be avoided. Which leaves the standard option of Treasury simply crediting the TF with Special Treasuries in the amount of the diverted payroll tax. On paper this would make the TFs whole and avoid the loss of those years of interest. While less than ideal this would be for me an acceptable resolution to the problem created by the dollar diversion to stimulus. I just wish we were not going down this path at all.</p>
<p>Because we have gone from a situation where we had two big pools of revenue and cost that were legally separate. Under current law if Social Security ends up being overfunded going forward its choice would be between sweetening benefits or cutting taxes. If it turns out to be underfunded compared to the schedule it is legally on its own, under IC projections that means considering some package of tax increases/benefit cuts starting in around 2030. And from the perspective of workers that is a pretty reasonable bargain, Social Security not drawing on capital (except in the form of collecting interest on money lent to the General Fund) and so not owing anything to capital. Under this proposal that breaks down. Instead we have lower income workers having much to most of their federal tax burden eliminated for at least a two year period. Which is good for them in that sense, but ends up validating the Right talking point that poor people don&#8217;t pay taxes. In reality poor people pay all kinds of taxes directly and indirectly from sales taxes to property taxes funded via their rent payments. And until this proposal came along in the form of FICA payroll taxes to fund a combined insurance/pension plan. Now it looks like that dignity of largely paying for your own retirement is at least temporarily stripped away. I doubt many minimum wage workers would care, under current circumstances they are likely to need that $500 or $1000. And I for one wouldn&#8217;t expect them to resist the whole plan on principle. But generally speaking when I hear the words &#8216;payroll tax holiday&#8217; I am tempted to reach for my pistol. Because history shows that more often than not proposals that use that mechanism have a not-so-hidden agenda of undermining traditional Social Security simply for the sake of doing so.</p>
<p>But this isn&#8217;t the only issue. Who counts as unemployed under this proposal? What happens with one earner households? What if one earner in a two-earner household makes less than $8100? If every adult not currently in the work force is included than most of the administrative difficulties go away. On the other hand you have also given out free cash to every rich college student and to every poor drug addict and for that matter every rich college student Amsterdam hash and coke addict. But if you start drawing eligibility lines you could end up with an administrative and/or enforcement nightmare. For example what do you do with the stay-at-home spouse? The proposal suggests that each couple should get $1000 so clearly the intent is to include them in. Which suggests two possible solutions. One you could exempt FICA on the first $16,200 of income for the earner. Which would mean that employers were tasked with tracking employment status for all employee spouses so they would know when to start and stop the exemption. Oops. HR and accounting are not going to like that, you have added substantial compliance costs. Or you could just handle this on a mixed basis, with the earner&#8217;s $500 coming from FICA exemptions and the non-earner&#8217;s from a refundable credit. Which shifts the compliance costs over to the IRS.</p>
<p>I understand the attraction of payroll tax holidays. They directly reward work. Which is good. And they seem simple and easy to administer. Well everything is simple if you ignore the complexities. I want to hear more detail about how this works operationally before I buy in. Color me skeptical.</p>

                                <p>In recent days there has been a lot of gnashing of teeth among Social Security supporters at the prospect of even having Social Security on the table during next month&#8217;s economic summit. I gave a few reasons a couple days ago why we don&#8217;t need to let &#8216;fear itself&#8217; rule us <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/" target="_match">Obama and Social Security: why NOT to worry</a>. Today I want to add some reasons why this could work in total favor of the progressive agenda. And rather than recreate the wheel I am just going to repost something from my own blog from August 2005, which post had the same title as this one. Given the passage of time and the new economic situation I would today have to update a couple points, these are indicated in italics. Otherwise it has I think held up well. Full text below<br />
<blockquote>Time for Politics.</p>
<p>Social Security offers the opportunity to reverse a whole generation of political defensivism on the part of Democrats. We have the unique chance of changing the entire narrative.</p>
<p>Because Social Security &#8220;crisis&#8221; is not a matter of numbers, not really, it is a story in support of an ideology which can be boiled down to &#8220;Markets Good, Government Bad&#8221;. This story has been carefully crafted for seventy years and finally got its opportunity to be put in play in 1980 with the election of Ronald &#8220;Government is not the solution, government is the problem&#8221; Reagan.</p>
<p>As it turns out Reagan was forced to compromise on Social Security in 1983 and accept an increase in payroll tax. The response of the Social Security haters was then laid out in the Fall 1983 issue of the Cato Journal <a href="http://www.cato.org/pubs/journal/cj3n2/cj3n2.html">Social Security: Continuing Crisis or Real Reform?</a> Particularly illuminating is the article by Butler and Germanis &#8220;Achieving Social Security Reform: A “Leninist” Strategy&#8221;. They laid out a careful, long term strategy that would allow them to kill Social Security at the next crisis point, which point was projected to coincide with the retirement of the first Boomers, which would start as early as 2008. According to the story the impact of Boomer Retirement would send the whole edifice crashing leaving Private Accounts standing triumphant.</p>
<p>But history and the economy did not play nice. They conspired to return economic numbers that started to push shortfall and depletion back. This trend accelerated in the nineties and can be inspected here <a href="http://www.epinet.org/content.cfm/issueguides_socialsecurity_changes">Economics Policy Institute: Changes in Trustees Projections over time</a>. A Trust Fund that was projected to run dry in 2023 was over a period of years adjusted to a Trust Fund projected to run out in 2041, and that date was being pushed back more than 1.3 years per year.</p>
<p>Privatizers panicked. Their carefully generated narrative began to lose its punch. In 2041 the youngest Boomer (born in 1964) will be seventy four, the oldest (born in 1946) ninety-six. It would be pretty hard to argue that they in fact had not fully paid for their Social Security themselves. So privatizers began to tweak the numbers and move the goalposts. In doing so they had to cast doubt on the very existence of the Trust Fund. Hence the talk of &#8220;worthless IOUs&#8221;. But even this new story is losing its impact.</p>
<p>Because amazingly enough we may not even need to tap the Trust Fund principal, we may need at worst to tap a fraction of the interest due. Because we are soundly beating the productivity numbers required by Low Cost.<a href="http://bruceweb.blogspot.com/2004/11/what-is-low-cost-alternative-what-does.html">What is the Low Cost Alternative: What does it mean</a> and Low Cost predicts just that: a minor shortfall in income less interest against cost in 2023 which is more than offset by interest earned. Absent some future government proving themselves to be Crooks and Liars in abrograting Trust Fund bonds issued with the Full Trust and Credit of the United States beating Low Cost means we are home free.</p>
<p>But it might well be better than that. <i>The economy is returning productivity numbers close to double what Low Cost requires</i>, and minor changes in productivity in the early years have outsized impacts on the Trust Fund in the outyears. As it sits we may have a Trust Fund that is actually overfunded going forward. And that is our opportunity.</p>
<p>Imagine a <i>March 2006</i> Report that announces that not only will Social Security not be going broke, it will be a net lender forever. That shows that privatizers pushing &#8220;Crisis&#8221; were not just alarmists but outright liars trying to sabotage the legacy of Roosevelt. Do you think we could run with that? Do you think we could run ON that? Well I do.</p></blockquote>
<p>Because this is what I have been working for. I am tired of continually playing defense on Social Security. I want to take it right to the other guy. And we are not going to get there by trying to keep the ball out of play. We just need to open a nice big can of FDR WhoopAss and show the other guys that we got the numbers on this.</p>
<p>So lets get out of our defensive crouch and stop letting the other side run all over us on this. We have two choices here. We can channel Bush I &#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t be prudent&#8221; or go right back to our original inspiration &#8220;The only thing we have to fear is Fear itself&#8221;. I know where my preference is.</p>

                                <p>Or maybe I did. Given that Peter Orszag is incoming head of OMB and I am, well, me, odds are I am the one in error. But I can&#8217;t find it.  Maybe someone here can help. <br />This started as an exchange in comments on <a target="_blank" href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/01/is-obama-echoing-bush-on-social.html">Is Obama Echoing Bush</a> Andrew Biggs claims the following<br />
<blockquote>As for the backwards transfer, this is pretty standard stuff now. Google &#8220;social security&#8221; &#8220;legacy debt&#8221; and you&#8217;ll find info on it &#8212; written by Peter Orszag and Peter Diamond, who last I checked weren&#8217;t part of the right wing conspiracy. As it happens, I haven&#8217;t argued whether the backward transfer was fair or not, in part because it doesn&#8217;t make any difference &#8212; what&#8217;s done is done. What I will say is that had early generations only gotten out what they paid in, plus interest, the trust fund today would be worth around $20 trillion and we wouldn&#8217;t face the prospect of tax increases or benefit cuts in the future. I&#8217;ll let others judge whether that makes sense or not.</p></blockquote>
<p> and explains that with this<br />
<blockquote>The current effect on the trust fund is equal to the difference between early participants&#8217; taxes (plus interest to today) minus their benefits (plus interest to today) &#8212; in other words, the present value.</p></blockquote>
<p>For those who haven&#8217;t been following along &#8220;backwards transfer&#8221; is a reference to some posts here  from last August. <a target="_blank" href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/08/soc-sec-xxxvi-14-trillion-backward.html">$17 trillion Backwards Transfer</a> &#038; <a target="_blank" href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/08/soc-sec-xxxvii-backwards-transfers.html">Backwards Transfer: Biggs Responds</a> and the reference to Orszag and Diamond seems to be related to <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/" target="_blank">Saving Social Security: the Diamond-Orzsag Plan</a> The link is to the intro, if you download the PDF you will find the relevant passage as follows:<br />
<blockquote>Third, and finally, our plan addresses the burden of the legacy debt. Benefits paid to almost all current and past cohorts of beneficiaries exceeded what could have been financed with the revenue they contributed. This difference is what we call the legacy debt. Without this debt—that is, if earlier cohorts had received only the benefits that could be financed by their contributions plus interest, the trust fund’s assets today would be much greater. Those assets would earn interest, which could be used to finance benefits.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well none of this sounds quite right to me for reasons I&#8217;ll outline below the fold.</p>
<p>First how much was actually paid out to these earlier cohorts and when? Well I went back and took a look at the tables, in particular Table IV.A2 which tracks income and cost from program inception right up to introduction of DI in 1957 and then Table IV.A4 which shows combined OASDI from 1957 to 2007.   </p>
<p>Tracking just benefits paid:   <br />OAS 1941-1956 $25.6 billion   <br />OASDI 1957-1968 $181 billion   <br />OASDI 1969-1980 $793.1 billion   <br />OASDI 1981-1992 $2.476.5 trillion   <br />OASDI 1993-2000 $2.829.3 trillion   <br />OASDI 2001-2007 $6.330,9 trillion   <br /> For a grand total of $12.636.4 trillion. Of particular note in context is the total paid out from 1941 to 1980: $999.7 billion. Why is 1980 significant? Because that is the last year that a retiree could have started drawing benefits WITHOUT paying in his entire work career. That is someone 65 in 1980 would have been 21 in 1936. So we have this cohort of &#8216;deadbeats&#8217; (which BTW includes most of the &#8216;Greatest Generation&#8217;) dragging down almost exactly a trillion dollars in benefits. But all of those benefits had been paid for, at the end of 1980 the Trust Fund was in very poor shape but still had $26.5 billion in accumulated surplus. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/VI_cyoper_history.html#159726">Table VI.A4.—Historical Operations of the Combined OASI and DI Trust Funds, Calendar Years 1957-2007 [Amounts in billions]</a>. And if we fast forward to today the youngest survivor of this group would be 93 years old and us sitting on a total surplus of $2.4 trillion.</p>
<p>So how does a fully paid for $1 trillion dollars in benefits to 1980, plus an additional $11.6 trillion in benefits fully paid for by the end of 2008 leaving a surplus of $2.4 trillion work out to impose trillions of dollars of &#8216;legacy&#8217; debt, still less the $17 trillion amount suggested by Biggs? I don&#8217;t see that his formulation helps us any. Benefits paid in 1980 using 1980 dollars are off the books, calculating their present value doesn&#8217;t make much sense to me. In any event someone needs to show their work. Because from the initial discussion we know the source of the $17 trillion claim. It comes from misunderstanding the following table:<br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SXN3gs-Z-tI/AAAAAAAAAD4/E86pEavHb9Y/s1600-h/2008_IV.B7.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SXN3gs-Z-tI/AAAAAAAAAD4/E86pEavHb9Y/s320/2008_IV.B7.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />(<s>I&#8217;ll try to get a bigger version in comments. Or maybe someone can give me an assist and blow this up a little)</s>(Click on the image here or the image in the first comment for a larger version).<br />The problem arises from not quite getting the definitions of &#8216;past&#8217; &#8216;current&#8217; and &#8216;future&#8217; participants as used by the Trustees and if I had to pinpoint the source of the error it would be in the following passage (bolding mine)<br />
<blockquote>The first line of table IV.B7 shows that the present value of future cost less future taxes over the next 100 years for all current participants equals $17.4trillion. For this purpose, current participants are defined as individuals who attain age 15 or older in 2008. Subtracting the current value of the trust fund (the accumulated value of past OASDI taxes less cost) gives a closed group (excluding all future participants) unfunded obligation of $15.2trillion. This value represents the shortfall of lifetime contributions for all past and current participants relative to the lifetime costs associated with their generations. For a fully-advance-funded program this value would be equal to zero.</p></blockquote>
<p> This does not bear the meaning that Biggs, and perhaps Orszag and Diamond,  place on it. That A + B = $C trillion does not mean that A > 0. Still less that A = $17 trillion. Or even $15 trillion. Instead you have to understand these &#8216;unfunded liabilities&#8217; include all projected gaps between revenue and cost for everyone born before 1994 all of the way out to 2108. Moreover all but $4.3 trillion actually occurs AFTER the 75 year window<br />
<blockquote>The values in table IV.B6 indicate that extending the calculations beyond 2082 adds $9.3 ($13.6 &#8211; $4.3) trillion in present value to the amount of the unfunded obligation estimated through 2082. That is, over the infinite horizon, the OASDI open group unfunded obligation is projected to be $13.6trillion. The $9.3trillion increment reflects a significant financing gap projected for OASDI over the infinite future period after 2082. Of course, the degree of uncertainty associated with estimates beyond 2082 is substantial.</p></blockquote>
<p>(BW: no shit). On my reading Diamond-Orzsag propose to start charging us in 2023 for a &#8216;legacy debt&#8217; that mostly won&#8217;t be incurred until after 2082. Yet blaming it on past participants (i.e. dead people) getting trillions in extra benefits. Sorry I just don&#8217;t see how the numbers support that. Past participants clearly paid for everything they got, the Trust Funds never actually went to zero in their lifetimes (though it got close in 1983). And that portion of current participants who are already retired will have paid for almost all their benefits, given that a relatively small portion of such retirees are likely to be alive in 2041 or 2048. For that matter that portion of current participants within 15 years or so of retirement are mostly paid up.</p>
<p>Perhaps someone can come up with some explanation of why it makes sense calculating bills already paid off in then current dollars adding up to future liabilities. On a cash flow basis it seems nonsense, as long as your income rate exceeds your cost rate it is hard to see how you could realistically be said to be in any kind of debt situation. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/IV_LRest.html#304086">Table IV.B1.—Estimated Annual Income Rates, Cost Rates, and Balances, Calendar Years 1990-2085 [As a percentage of taxable payroll]</a> It is hard to believe that two sentences could lead to so much confusion, but it looks like the culprit is right here:<br />
<blockquote>This value represents the shortfall of lifetime contributions for all past and current participants relative to the lifetime costs associated with their generations. For a fully-advance-funded program this value would be equal to zero.</p></blockquote>
<p>Someone has simply put the fully loaded Gen-X cart in front of the Boomer horse and telling us it is our duty to push. Well no we have been pulling our share of the load all along.</p>

Each drawing his particular hope and fear from this WaPo article <a target="_blank" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/01/15/AR2009011504114.html?wprss=rss_business">Obama Pledges Entitlement Reform: President-Elect Says He&#8217;ll Reshape Social Security, Medicare Programs</a> Well I am STILL not worried because the two (Bush and Obama) are coming at this from very different starting points.</p>
<p>Obama&#8217;s position is outlined pretty clearly on the Obama 2008 website<br />
<blockquote>Obama and Biden are committed to ensuring Social Security is solvent and viable for the American people, now and in the future. Obama and Biden will be honest with the American people about the long-term solvency of Social Security and the ways we can address the shortfall. Obama and Biden will protect Social Security benefits for current and future beneficiaries alike. And they do not believe it is necessary or fair to hardworking seniors to raise the retirement age. Obama and Biden are strongly opposed to privatizing Social Security. As part of a bipartisan plan that would be phased in over many years, they will ask those making over $250,000 to contribute a bit more to Social Security to keep it sound.<br />Obama does not support uncapping the full payroll tax of 12.4 percent rate. Instead, he and Joe Biden are considering plans that would ask those making over $250,000 to pay in the range of 2 to 4 percent more in total (combined employer and employee).</p></blockquote>
<p>No increase in retirement age, no privatization. I just don&#8217;t see enough in this from the WaPo to suggest he has fundamentally moved away from his previously stated position.<br />
<blockquote>Five days before taking office, Obama was careful not to outline specific fixes for Social Security and Medicare, refusing to endorse either a new blue-ribbon commission or the concept of submitting an overhaul plan to Congress that would be subject only to an up-or-down vote, similar to the one used to reach agreement on the closure of military bases. But the president-elect exuded confidence that his economic team will succeed where others have not.</p>
<p>&#8220;Social Security, we can solve,&#8221; he said, waving his left hand. &#8220;The big problem is Medicare, which is unsustainable. . . . We can&#8217;t solve Medicare in isolation from the broader problems of the health-care system.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p> Which translates to me as &#8220;(SS) small problem down the road&#8221; vs &#8220;(Medicare) big issue needing action now&#8221;. That is on Social Security Obama is by temperament a Fixer. In contrast Bush started as a Transformer. To see the difference we need to start with the mission statement of the 2001 Commission. Which is below the fold.<br />A link to their full (13 MB PDF) report can be found on the home page of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.csss.gov/">President&#8217;s Commission to Strengthen Social Security</a> but pretty much all you need to know is outlined in the &#8216;Guiding Principles&#8217;<br />
<blockquote>Guiding Principles<br />The Commission was asked to make recommendations to modernize and restore fiscal soundness to Social Security, using six guiding principles:<br />•Modernization must not change Social Security benefits for retirees or near-retirees.<br />•The entire Social Security surplus must be dedicated only to Social Security.<br />•Social Security payroll taxes must not be increased.<br />•The government must not invest Social Security funds in the stock market.<br />•Modernization must preserve Social Security`s disability and survivors insurance programs.<br />•Modernization must include individually controlled, voluntary personal retirement accounts, which will augment Social Security.</p></blockquote>
<p>That is the Commission was not tasked with studying Social Security in the larger financial context of Medicare and the General Fund deficit. It wasn&#8217;t even tasked with studying Social Security in isolation and coming back with recommendations on how to fix it. Instead certain categories of fix are ruled out right from the start. No direct investment by Social Security in the stock market (which would capture the much touted equity premium). No increase in payroll taxes (sorry Coberly, the Commission was not even allowed to discuss it). Nope the Commission was given perfect freedom to come up with a plan. As long as the plan included individually controlled, voluntary personal retirement accounts. Meaning that when Bush was claiming in 2004 that &#8220;all options are on the table&#8221; he was pretty much fibbing. He knew what he wanted and what he wanted was Transformation.</p>
<p>Andrew Biggs can hear all the echoes he wants, I just am not convinced Obama has drank any kind of Kool-Aid here.</p>
