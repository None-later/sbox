                                <p>Near the end of each month the Treasury Dept releases Trust Fund Reports giving balances to the penny for the previous month. By comparing these balances to the projection in the Annual Reports we can get a rough idea of how Social Security is doing year to date. This year&#8217;s Report was released on October 2. Two caveats:<br />One, these numbers are not seasonally adjusted and I couldn&#8217;t tell you the relative impact on total wages of summer employment vs harvest vs holiday. Each are marked by the entry of temporary workers into the system.<br />Two, Social Security collects FICA on your total check right up to the point you hit the annual cap at which point they stop collecting at all. For example if you have a salary of $200,000 per year you would see full deductions for Jan to Jun, a small deduction for July and nothing thereafter. This should make for the earlier parts of the year seeing relatively higher collections than the latter. But once again I can&#8217;t quantify the effect.</p>
<p>So this is an imperfect tool. But it is what we have. So lets have some numbers. (Warning we have a kind of disappointing result, Social Security not liking an economy where U6 is sitting at 11% <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/03/the-track-record/">Krugman: The Track Record</a>.)</p>
<p>The web page for all the Trust Fund Reports (including Medicare HI, Highways etc) is <a href="http://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/tfmp/tfmp.htm">Trust Fund Monthly Reports</a> While generally Social Security is reported for convenience as having a single Trust Fund which will go to depletion (or not) in some future year (currently 2041), in reality there are two Trust Funds which are legally distinct and can have different levels of solvency and so different projected depletion dates. The larger by far (about 10 to 1) is the OAS (Old Age Survivors) TF. Its report can be found at <a href="ftp://ftp.publicdebt.treas.gov/dfi/tfmb/dfifo0608.pdf">OAS Monthly TF Report</a>. Its smaller companion the DI (Disability Insurance) TF can be found at <a href="ftp://ftp.publicdebt.treas.gov/dfi/tfmb/dfifd0608.pdf">DI Monthly TF Report</a> These can then be cross checked against the relevant tables in the 2008 Report:<br /><a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/IV_SRest.html#248224">Table IV.A1.—Operations of the OASI Trust Fund, Calendar Years 2003-17 [Amounts in billions]</a> and <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/IV_SRest.html#251965">Table IV.A2.—Operations of the DI Trust Fund, Calendar Years 2003-17 [Amounts in billions]</a><br />OAS::Opening balance//Projected year end balance-Intermediate Cost//Y-O-Y Increase//Year end balance-Low Cost//Y-O-Y increase-Low Cost<br />$2.023 trillion // $2.216 trillion //$193 billion// $2.221 trillion// $198 billion</p>
<p>DI::Opening balance//Projected year end balance-Intermediate Cost//Y-O-Y Increase//Year end balance-Low Cost//Y-O-Y increase-Low Cost<br />$214.9 billion//$218.7 billion//$3.8 billion//$221.3 billion// $6.4 billion.</p>
<p>June 30th/Mid-year: OAS $2.140 trillion// DI $220 billion</p>
<p>Aug 31st/Two-thirds: OAS $2.164 trillion// DI $219 billion</p>
<p>I had some calculations up but they all got garbled in my head so I deleted them. Bottom line 2008 is shaping up to be a kind of sucky year for Social Security. What was a decent picture for OAS mid-year now is kind of dim, it is unlikely that we will even hit Intermediate Cost projections. What was a really bright picture for DI is now less shiny, from June to August the balance actually shrank, if that continues at the same rate it too will fail to hit IC projections.</p>
<p>Which just goes to show the ultimate truth about Social Security, it prospers in good times, it shares the pain in bad as receipts react to covered employment and real wages. (We have a parallel here with the late seventies, a reform was put in in I believe 1977, it didn&#8217;t fare well when stagflation simultaneously choked off revenue while boosting cost. The result was a new crisis and a need for a bigger reform in 1983).</p>

                                <p>By Bruce</p>
<p>Andrew Biggs directs our attention to a new detailed PRA plan by Mark Warshawsky, a member of the Social Security Advisory Board: <a href="http://andrewgbiggs.blogspot.com/2008/09/ssa-actuaries-score-new-reform-proposal.html">Notes on SS Reform: Actuaries Score New Reform Proposal</a> The post does not link to the plan itself but instead to a detailed scoring of it by the Office of the Chief Actuary in a memo to be found here (PDF) <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/solvency/Warshawsky_20080917.pdf">Estimated Financial Effects of “A Reform Proposal to Make Social Security Financially Sound, Fairer, and More Progressive” by Mark Warshawsky</a></p>
<p>I just came across this and haven&#8217;t studied it in detail (and boy is there a bunch of detail) but like any plan it raises some standard questions.</p>
<p>1) Is the rate of return assumed on the PRAs actually reasonable under Intermediate Cost assumptions? (The No Economist Left Behind Challenge).</p>
<p>2) The plan assumes a direct transfer from the General Fund to supplement the PRAs starting in 2012 equivalent to .5% of payroll. Given that one current definition of &#8216;crisis&#8217; is &#8216;General Fund transfers starting in 2017 to pay partial interest&#8217;, adding an additional transfer amount starting even sooner seems to undercut the overall message. How do advocates of the plan address this?</p>
<p>3) The Warshawsky Plan assumes a whole range of cuts and adjustments to retirement age, tax on benefits, and to the benefit formula generally. Each is scored individually as seen in Table A (which follows the actual memo page 14). Any combination of those scored cuts and adjustments that add up to 1.7% of payroll would put current Social Security in Long Range Actuarial Balance. What happens if we just take this cafeteria style?</p>
<p>Provision 3 would modestly raise the cap for a net addition of .15% of payroll. Provision 4 would gradually expose all SS benefits to taxation for an additional .24% of payroll. Provision 6 would bring in all new State and Local government employess for a net addition of .22% of payroll. Provision 7 would increase early and full retirement ages for an addition of .56% of payroll. Provision 8 is a little obscure but it would seem to just reduce lifetime benefits for disabled workers for a net addition of .35% of payroll. For a total combination of 1.52%. I don&#8217;t really get provision 5 but it would give you an additional .65% of payroll for a new total of guaranteeed tax increases and benefit cuts of 2.17 of payroll. Which is to say .47% more than would be needed to simply fix the program as is. </p>
<p>Now Warshawsky sweetens the plan by reducing payroll tax by 1.0% (presumedly translating to a increase in worker pay of .5%) but offsets that with a new transfer from the General Fund of .5%. Now given the different incidence of Income tax and FICA this means a lower income worker would benefit more by the reduction of FICA by .5% from his first dollar than he would from some theoretical increase in income tax to fund that transfer from the GF. But enough to offset the guaranteed increases proposed?</p>
<p>No one really doubts that you could close the proposed 1.7% gap by some combination of tax increases and benefit cuts and Warshawsky&#8217;s plan does that up front. But in this scheme where do PRAs come in?</p>
<p>Answer under the fold.</p>
<p>This is where the water gets deep. The proposed FICA tax cuts in provisions 1 &#038; 2 total 1.26% of payroll. Hurrah for workers! But the guaranteed cuts in benefits in provisions 3 to 8 equate to 2.17% of payroll. Which means workers are .91% behind right from the get go. Plus you add in whatever their share of that additional .5% of GF transfer. Then you get the whopper, Warshawsky proposes to change the benefits for everyone by an ADDITIONAL 1.46% of payroll under provision 9, meaning the worker is guaranteed a combination of 2.37% plus of average cuts in the face of a gap now scored at 1.7%. But wait, some of that money was steered into private accounts, surely most people will make up the gap from the equity premium. Won&#8217;t they?</p>
<p>Well maybe. If the economy grows at a rate that allows for assumed returns and if you are willing to take higher levels of risk some people after 2029 or so get a better deal overall. But not everybody and not anything is guaranteed. The actuaries put it this way<br />
<blockquote>The personal account annuity replaces the smallest portion of the reduction in the scheduled benefit for the married couple with only one earner.  The annuity would fall somewhat short of covering the PIA reduction for one-earner couples retiring at 65 in about 2030 or earlier.  For single workers and two-earner couples retiring after 2039 with low career earnings, however, this approach would generally be expected to provide an overall increase in retirement income.</p></blockquote>
<p> Translation: Boomers and most Gen-Xers get less net than they would be leaving the system alone.</p>
<p>This is by no means a complete analysis of the plan, more like a skim, and for those with the chops I encourage you to dig in. But I just don&#8217;t see how the average worker really benefits under this plan given the risk involved. The benefit cuts are guaranteed, the gains from the PRAs are contingent. Plus we haven&#8217;t even examined the NELB component, can they really get these projected PRA yields at Intermediate Cost assumptions?</p>

                                <p>Time for this adopted Angry Bear to go into hibernation for the winter. Events out of Alaska and now out of Wall Street make it extremely unlikely that Social Security itself will return to the center of the policy table anytime soon. Rather than rallying to crush  one of the remaining cornerstone&#8217;s of the New Deal, Wall Street and the Market Absolutists will be lucky not to be Glass-Steagel&#8217;d.</p>
<p>Which doesn&#8217;t mean I won&#8217;t be sticking my snout in where I sniff something interesting, or that I am going to take my eye off the numbers. Right around Halloween the Treasury will release Trust Fund balances for Sept 30th which is to say the Q3 numbers. I&#8217;ll certainly check in with a comparison of those right to the penny balances with projections from the 2008 Report. And the same Report for year end balances is scheduled for release around Jan. 31. (People who want to play the home version of the Social Security game are urged to do so at <a href="http://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/tfmp/tfmp.htm">Treasury Direct: Trust Fund Monthly Reports</a>). And even more importantly the Annual Report of Social Security is due for release around March 31st of 2009. Which is about when I expect to come out of my den. But barring real surprises I propose to put this Social Security Bear to bed for the next six months or so.</p>
<p>(Of course if someone decides to poke this sleeping bear with a sharp stick they might be surprised at the reaction.)</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t imagine that this means the Right is not hell-bent on destroying Social Security, because they are. It is just that their plate is a little full right now. See you in Spring (or in Comments).</p>

                                <p>The newest buzzphrase in the Social Security world is &#8216;Intergenerational Equity&#8217;. It is indeed the theme of the new movie <a href="http://www.agorafinancial.com/iousa.html?gclid=CMrNleqo1JUCFQL8iAodDBMgiw">IOUSA</a> (to whose webpage I link) which itself is pretty much a documentary of the Concord Coaltion&#8217;s <a href="http://www.concordcoalition.org/act/fiscal-wake-tour">Fiscal Wake Up Tour</a>. (The fact that Concord was founded by Pete Peterson and rights to distribute the IOUSA film are in the hands of the <a href="http://www.pgpf.org/">PGPF: Peter G. Peterson Foundation</a> not being a coincidence at all.)</p>
<p>One of EconomistMom&#8217;s (who is a/the chief economist at Concord) first posts was entitled <a href="http://economistmom.com/2008/06/the-young-people-get-it/">The Young People Get It</a> which in turn was plugging the <a href="http://www.youthentitlementsummit.org/Welcome.html">Youth Entitlement Summit 2008</a> in turn sponsored by <a href="http://www.age-usa.org/">Americans for Generational Equity</a> an organization first founded in 2006 and funded by the usual group of conservative foundations.</p>
<p>The idea isn&#8217;t new exactly, in Googling around today I found this lengthy article from Sept 2003 that probably explains it better than I can (I have only read the first page so far) <a href="http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0CYZ/is_3_30/ai_109352146">Generational equity, generational interdependence, and the framing of the debate over social security reform</a>. But before I turn this one over to a discussion of that let me highlight one thing.</p>
<p>If you go to the IOUSA webpage and look for the first part of the description of the overall issue you find it framed as follows (bolding mine) :<br />
<blockquote>I.O.U.S.A. boldly examines the rapidly growing national debt and its consequences for the United States and its citizens. As the Baby Boomer generation prepares to retire, will there even be any Social Security benefits left to collect? Burdened with an ever-expanding government and military, increased international competition, overextended entitlement programs, and debts to foreign countries that are becoming impossible to honor, America must mend its spendthrift ways or face an economic disaster of epic proportions.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sure they go on to talk about military spending and foreign debt but the discussion ALWAYS starts and mostly ends with Social Security and equally ALWAYS with a dig at Baby Boomers.</p>
<p>Having run into this particular article I want to post this now as Part 1 and get some discussion going on the overall topic and then return to the theme of &#8216;Social Security Crisis = Selfish Boomers&#8217; in a latter post. Consider this homework for the would-be well-prepared student. Or contra-wise an episode of &#8216;Know your enemy&#8217;.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>In the last installment of this Social Security series we kind of dug into some of the details of unfunded liability, what it was and what it wasn&#8217;t and most importantly where the incidence occured: in the past or in the future. <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/08/backwards-transfer-is-back.html">Backwards Transfer is Back</a>. In the course of that I think it became pretty clear that none of that liability really was the consequence of overpayments to what Social Security calls &#8216;past participants&#8217; that instead it was all due to a gap between future cost and future income for &#8216;current participants&#8217;. But in the course of that discussion the role of &#8216;future participants&#8217; fell through the crack when instead the numbers have some surprising implications. But before getting to that I want to back up and consider Unfunded Liability more broadly.</p>
<p>Traditionally Social Security has judged solvency over the short term (10 years) and the long term (75 years). Which seems reasonable enough, 75 years being a period that will capture the retirement years of pretty much any current worker. The metrics of solvency were typically expressed as percentage of payroll or percentage of GDP. In 2003 the Reports introduced  new measures of solvency which expressed the gap between income and cost in Present Value dollars over the 75 year window and indeed over the Infinite Future. The first set of numbers just divides this into periods: first 75 years, 75 years to Infinite Future, and total and expresses it in dollars.<br />2003: $3.5 trillion, $7 trillion, $10.5 trillion<br />2004: $3.7 trillion, $6.7 trillion, $10.4 trillion<br />2005: $4.0 trillion, $7.1 trillion, $11.1 trillion<br />2006: $4.6 trillion, $8.6 trillion, $13.4 trillion<br />2007: $4.7 trillion, $8.9 trillion, $13.6 trillion<br />2008: $4.3 trillion, $8.3 trillion, $13.6 trillion<br />What do these numbers tell us? Well not much really. Generally you would expect the unfunded liability over the first seventy five years to increase simply because of normal population growth, we will have more people overall in year seventy-six than we do in year one, as we drop the latter and add the former we can expect an uptick in liability which right now is about .06% of payroll. The relatively small changes from 2003 to 2004 and 2006 to 2007 can be explained in this way. On the other hand the bigger movements from 2005 to 2006 or 2007 to 2008 turn out on examination to be the result of additional changes in assumptions, in the first case in assumed interest and in the latter changes in assumptions about immigration. But other than that the numbers don&#8217;t really give us much guidance except perhaps to wonder why the future numbers from year 76 on, representing as they do the Infinite Future are not even larger. To get insight into this we need to move to a more granular analysis. Which comes under the fold.</p>
<p>The Table numbers vary a little bit between reports with what was Tables IV.B7 and IV.B8 in earlier Reports become IV.B6 and IV.7 but all are titled <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/IV_LRest.html#267528">Present Values of OASDI Cost Less Tax Revenue and Unfunded Obligations for Program Participants[Present values as of January 1, 2008; dollar amounts in trillions]</a> People who read the last post may remember that the Trustees break down &#8220;Program Participants&#8217; in kind of an odd way:<br />&#8216;Past participants&#8217; would seem to be that group of people who formerly drew benefits but no longer do. In short the dead.<br />&#8216;Current participants&#8217; are defined as everyone fifteen and older and so include all current workers and current retirees.<br />&#8216;Future participants&#8217; are defined as everyone under fifteen plus those not yet born. The table assigns dollar figures to these groups as follows:<br />Row 1 = &#8220;Present value of future cost less future taxes for current participants&#8221; (Over the next 100 years)<br />Row 2 = &#8220;Less current trust fund&#8221;<br />Row 3 = &#8220;Equals unfunded obligation for past and current participants&#8221; (Note that in this case the contribution of past participants is likely positive overall)<br />Row 4 = &#8220;Plus present value of cost less tax for future participants for through the infinite future&#8221;<br />Row 5 = &#8220;Equals unfunded obligation for all participants through the infinite future&#8221;<br />This result can be expressed as an equation. So what does it look like over the same period as above? (Figures in trillions)<br />2003: $11.9 &#8211; $1.4 = $10.5  -$.0 = $10.5<br />2004: $12.7 &#8211; $1.5 = $11.2  -$.8 = $10.4<br />2005: $13.7 &#8211; $1.7 = $12.0  -$.9 = $11.1<br />2006: $15.1 &#8211; $1.9 = $13.3 + $.1 = $13.4<br />2007: $16.5 &#8211; $2.0 = $14.4 &#8211; $.8   = $13.6<br />2008: $17.4 &#8211; $2.2 = $15.2 &#8211; $1.5 = $13.6 (rounding is Trustees&#8217;)</p>
<p>What does this tell us? Well actually quite a bit. The increases in column one are mostly I think to be explained by current demographics, fewer people entering the workforce compared to the large cohort of Boomers leaving. And column two is just showing the effects of a Trust Fund in current surplus with column three being the simple sum. </p>
<p>But it is column four that is most interesting to me. Biggs looks at that and sees future participants paying more in taxes than they are projected to get in benefits. I suggest that is the wrong way to look at it, instead turn it around. In 2003 future participants, then defined as all people born after 1988, taken as a whole could expect their benefits to be fully funded by their taxes. Which is to say that long term Social Security is projected to return to pay-go with a surplus and that all of the problem is in fact confined to the next 100 years.</p>
<p>This has some profound implications for policy. Under current projections Social Security is set to pay out 78% of the scheduled benefit starting in 2041, an amount that will shrink to 75% at the end of the 75 year window. But at that point the very youngest of the &#8216;current participants&#8217; of 2008 will be 90 and the impact of that cohort will be fading rapidly and we can reasonably expect it will go to zero right at the end of the hundred year period. Meaning that any fixes we choose to put in over the next couple of decades could be reversed later on with no damage to the long, long term outlook for Social Security. In actual practice there is no way we could limit the impacts of any medium term fixes to the current batch of current participants, some of the earlier cohorts of future participants will no doubt be called to sacrifice along with existing current participants. But there is a light at the end of that long tunnel. And if over the next couple of decades we can beat the current economic projections and so reduce the growth of column one and three we can make that light brighter and brighter.</p>
<p>In the light of the above equations Social Security&#8217;s unfunded liability is more akin to a fixed term mortgage than an infinite burden. We can and should take some efforts to pay it down quicker while knowing that given regular payments it goes away some time in the next hundred years anyway. As the post title notes, that liability is effectively bookended.</p>

                                <p>Awhile back we had a series of posts about the causality of Social Security&#8217;s &#8216;unfunded liability&#8217; in response to a comment by Jim Glass over at Andrew Bigg&#8217;s. The first post was <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/08/soc-sec-xxxvi-14-trillion-backward.html">XXXVI: $17 Trillion Backwards Transfer</a>. Andrew answered back with <a href="http://andrewgbiggs.blogspot.com/2008/08/responding-to-angry-bear-where-does-17.html">Responding to Angry Bear: Where does the $17 trillion deficit come from?</a> to which I replied with <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/08/soc-sec-xxxvii-backwards-transfers.html">XXXVII: Backwards Transfer: Biggs Responds</a></p>
<p>Well clearly Andrew was not convinced because he is now back with some new charts with <a href="http://andrewgbiggs.blogspot.com/2008/08/more-on-how-future-deficit-is-caused-by.html">More on How Future Deficit is Caused by Over-Generosity to Past Participants</a>. I am still not convinced, he is trying to stick a $15 trillion dollar future tab on past extra benefits collected by a past group that only collected a portion of a total of $999.7 billion paid out by 1980. My response is over there. Feel free to add to it or contrawise explain to me in comments why I just am just not getting it.</p>
<p>If you want to start with the basic numbers they will be found in <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/IV_LRest.html#267012">Table IV.B7.—Present Values of OASDI Cost Less Tax Revenue and Unfunded Obligations for Program Participants[Present values as of January 1, 2008; dollar amounts in trillions]</a> and <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/IV_LRest.html#267528">Table IV.B6.—Unfunded OASDI Obligations for 1935 (Program Inception) Through the Infinite Horizon[Present values as of January 1, 2008; dollar amounts in trillions]</a> along with some definitions in the associated text. For extra credit you might consider what the implications of adopting the new <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/08/cbo-updated-long-term-projections-for.html">CBO: Updated Long Term Projections for Social Security</a> does in this context. Because by lowering the payroll gap going forward from 1.95% (Trustees 2007) to 1.06% (CBO 2008) you end up with trillions slashed off of future unfunded liability. Since this effect cannot in any way be attributed to new actions by past and mostly dead participants it seems to be hard to attribute those unfunded liability effects back to start with. There seems to be a fatal confusion of past and future going on here.</p>

                                <p>I spend a good deal of time talking about &#8216;Nothing&#8217; as a plan for Social Security. You can make an excellent numeric case for &#8216;Nothing&#8217; in the short run <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/05/bw-on-soc-sec-viii-calculating-cost-of.html">VIII: Calculating the Cost of Inactivity</a> and you can make a reasonable economic case for &#8216;Nothing&#8217; in the long run <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/05/bw-on-soc-sec-ii-shape-of-low-cost.html">II: The Shape of Low Cost</a>. For that matter you can make a pretty good case that even if the Trust Fund does run out at some time in the future that it may not be that big a deal. For example the CBO just released their most recent projection last week in <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/96xx/doc9649/08-20-SocialSecurityUpdate.pdf">Updated Long-Term Projections for Social Security</a> and tell us (bolding mine)<br />
<blockquote>CBO’s projections indicate that future Social Security beneficiaries will receive larger benefits in retirement— and will have paid higher payroll taxes—than current beneficiaries do, even after adjustments have been made for inflation and even if the scheduled payments are reduced because the trust funds are exhausted.</p></blockquote>
<p> This is because the schedule of benefits is set up so that initial benefits track the overall growth of real wages over your work life, in this case the rising tide DOES lift all boats.</p>
<p>But I have to admit that &#8216;Nothing&#8217; is not a particularly satisfying plan. It is all well and good to say &#8216;So what 78% (Trustees) or 84% (CBO) of the scheduled benefit is better in real terms than what my Mom gets today&#8217; but somehow that leaves something lacking. So I want to propose an action plan based on real numbers and set a time when we might want to move on Social Security in an effort to either eliminate the projected benefit cut or smooth and extend it out. Details and numbers under the fold.</p>
<p>I attempted to make the case in <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/08/soc-sec-xxxvii-financing-shortfall.html">XXXVIII: Financing Shortfall</a> that the doom and gloomers who insist that paying back the Trust Fund will require massive tax increases or huge program cuts or unsustainable borrowing are simply ignoring the numbers, in inflation adjusted terms they never approach typical Bush II level unified deficits:<br />
<blockquote> all these numbers represent transfers from the General Fund. Numbers are in billions.</p>
<p>Year:::::Current:::::Constant 2008 dollars<br />2017:::$24:::::::::::$19<br />2020:::$107:::::::::$77<br />2025:::$275:::::::::$172<br />2030:::$471:::::::::$257<br />2035:::$656:::::::::$313<br />2040:::$808:::::::::$335<br />2045:::$0::::::::::::$0</p></blockquote>
<p> Now there is no doubt that given reasonable control on the General Fund side that we could afford to finance these numbers. On the other hand we have other societal needs. So I suggest we pick a target figure of $200 billion in 2008 dollars as the limit for what we will willingly want to transfer from the General Fund (or roughly the one year cost of the current wars). Which suggests a target date for implementation right around 2026-2027. Which suggests firing up the policy shops around 2023 (my scheduled date for retirement, maybe I can land a consultant gig).</p>
<p>Now lets turn around and see what current law requires. The Trustees use two different official measures to track the health of Social Security. One is Long Term Actuarial Balance which is the gap between future income and future cost reported as the amount of payroll tax needed to deliver 100% of the scheduled benefit, or that amount expressed as a percentage of GDP,  or as a Trust Fund ratio all over a 75 year window. The official target is a TF ratio of 100 which is to say a TF balance equal to one year of projected cost in each of the next 75 years. The second measure is Short Term Actuarial Balance which is always reported in terms of TF ratio over a ten-year window. If the Trust Fund is projected to have a TF ratio of 100 or more in each of the next ten years then the overall system is deemed in Short Term Actuarial Balance. If the TF fund is projected to fail that test the Trustees are mandated to urge Congress to act to bring it back in. Which is to say that Short Term Actuarial Balance is the canary in the coal mine.</p>
<p>Currently the Trust Funds individually and combined are in Short Term Balance so under the law we can (and in my view should) wait and see what eventuates. But under current projections when would the system fail the actuarial test?<br /><a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/IV_LRest.html#316289">Table IV.B3.—Estimated Trust Fund Ratios, Calendar Years 2008-85[In percent]</a><br />Well a little interpolation shows us going below a TF ratio of 100 in 2036 meaning that if outcomes do in fact come in in line with Intermediate Cost that the Trust Funds will fall out of Short Term Actuarial Balance in 2027, year ten being the trigger.</p>
<p>So both from the financial-economic side and the legal-technical side we end up with an action date under IC projections of 2027.</p>
<p>Now this date is obviously fluid and has been moving out in time. (And if we examine Low Cost we see that the system never fails the test and in fact may need to have its taxes cut back a little to keep the TF ratio at least under 400 and ideally back towards a sustainable 100 over the long term.) But at least it is something to hang our hat on. When anybody asks &#8216;What is YOUR plan for Social Security&#8217; the answer is &#8216;We are targetting the official measure of Short Term Actuarial Balance. If it looks to be failing that test four years out we will start planning with an implementation date of the year the system falls out of actuarial balance. Meanwhile we will simply monitor the numbers as they come out.&#8217;</p>
<p>Sure a little wonkish but it would show that supporters of Social Security are not just working on a hope and a prayer but instead imposing realistic tests on the system. My personal belief is that the date the system is projected to fall out of actuarial balance will continue to recede, but belief doesn&#8217;t buy you much. On the other the numbers are speaking to us and they are telling us we need to do nothing about Social Security before 2027 and plan nothing before about 2023. Meanwhile we have plenty of serious problems in other areas to worry about.</p>

<p>Andrew Biggs in <a href="http://andrewgbiggs.blogspot.com/2008/08/treatment-of-uncertainty-in-new-cbo.html">Treatment of uncertainty in new CBO Social Security projections</a> directs our attention to the new release from the Congressional Budget Office. I don&#8217;t tend to focus on CBO projections precisely because they are more optimistic than the Trustees&#8217;, I don&#8217;t want to open the door to people claiming I was misrepresenting dates of depletion or something. But like Low Cost CBO is out there. First point:<br />
<blockquote>Today, Social Security’s revenues each year are greater than its outlays, but as the baby-boom generation (people born between 1946 and 1964) continues to age, growth in the number of Social Security beneficiaries will accelerate, and outlays will grow substantially faster than revenues. CBO projects that outlays will first exceed revenues in 2019 and that the Social Security trust funds will be exhausted in 2049.</p></blockquote>
<p> I would only point out that surviving Boomers will be 85 to 103 in 2049. Second point:<br />
<blockquote>In 2049— CBO’s projected date for the trust funds’ exhaustion—revenues will equal only 84 percent of scheduled outlays. Thus, payable benefits will be 16 percent lower than scheduled benefits. Beginning in about 2070, the gap between scheduled and payable benefits will begin to grow, and by 2082, CBO projects, payable benefits will be 19 percent less than scheduled benefits.</p></blockquote>
<p>CBO: 84% payout at depletion in 2049, 81% payout in 2070. SSA Trustees: 78% payout at depletion in 2041, 75% payout in 2082. Third point (bolding mine):<br />
<blockquote>CBO has projected that 2049 is the year in which the balance in the trust funds, and thus the trust fund ratio, will fall to zero. But, as shown in Figure 3, there is a 10 percent chance that the trust funds will be exhausted in 2034 or earlier and a greater than 10 percent chance that they will not be exhausted before 2082.</p></blockquote>
<p>Does CBO use rosier demographics to derive these numbers? No:<br />
<blockquote>A number of basic assumptions underlie all long-term projections of the Social Security program’s finances. To project overall trends in demographics and disability, CBO adopts the assumptions of the Social Security trustees—specifically, for this analysis, the assumptions in the 2008 trustees’ report on the aggregate fertility rate, the rate of decline in mortality, the level of immigration, and the rates of disability incidence and termination.</p></blockquote>
<p> What about economic assumptions?:<br />Real Wage 1.4%<br />Total Factor Productivity 1.3%<br />Labor Productivity 1.9%<br />Real Rate of Interest 3.0%<br />Inflation (CPI-W) 2.2%<br />Unemployment 4.8%</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have a lot to say here, I can only point at the numbers. And the story they tell does not add up to crisis. CBO does not present the outlook in terms of payroll tax gap (that I could see) but a back of the envelope calculation suggests that if backfilling a 22% gap requires an immediate 1.7% of payroll (2008 Trustees) that a 16% gap should require maybe 70% of that or about 1.2%. {see update} I&#8217;ll leave it to Coberly to add some precision and attach a dollar figure here. But all in all if the CBO is getting this right Social Security &#8216;crisis&#8217; is more like a tempest in a tea pot than anything.</p>
<p>Anyhow lots of graphs and tables for those of you who like such things.<br />UPDATE (h/t lord)<br /><a href="http://cboblog.cbo.gov/?p=158">CBO Director&#8217;s Blog: Long term projections for Social Security: innovations in presenting uncertainty</a><br />
<blockquote>Today we released a paper on updated long-term projection for Social Security. (Our last long-term projection for social security was included in the December 2007 Long-Term Budget Outlook.) As CBO has highlighted in previous reports, the number of Social Security beneficiaries will grow considerably as the baby boomers become eligible for retirement benefits. Absent legislative changes, spending for the program will therefore climb substantially and exceed the program’s revenues. CBO projects that the 75-year actuarial imbalance in the program amounts to 0.38 percent of GDP, or 1.06 percent of taxable payroll.</p></blockquote>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>In reviewing some of the final comments on <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/08/soc-sec-xli-why-not-assume-low-cost.html">XLI: Why not assume Low Cost</a> the following partial comment caught my eye: &#8220;We are not going to grow our way out of this. And it&#8217;s highly unlikely that we will tax our way out, either.&#8221; To which I would want to ask: &#8220;Who says? And can you give your answer in numeric form?&#8221;</p>
<p>In the mid to late 80&#8217;s the narrative of Social Security &#8216;crisis&#8217; rested on two assumptions. One is that General Fund deficits were structural and could not be eliminated long term. This was summed up in the phrase &#8216;Deficits as far as the eye can see&#8217;. The second assumption was that Boomer retirement would arrive as an irresistable force right as those structural GF deficits were becoming unsustainable. The combination of these two was supposed to set a timetable for fiscal trainwreck right around the late 2020&#8217;s. And really at the time the logic seemed pretty good, in fact good enough that the country was willing to accept some &#8216;voodoo economics&#8217; hoping that tax cuts now would create enough growth to at least mitigate the disaster.</p>
<p>Well one thing didn&#8217;t happen. Those tax cuts did not create growth that trickled down in any amount that would fund those retirement IRAs Cato was pushing as a replacement for Social Security (the Ferrara Plan). And then another thing did happen. Credit it to what or who you want a combination of tax increases, spending restraint and an investment climate served up a federal budget in surplus by 2000, not just in Social Security, which started running strong surpluses around 1998, but in the General Fund as well.</p>
<p>So those predictions so confidently made in the 1980&#8217;s turned out to be flat wrong, those people who said &#8220;We are not going to grow our way out of this. And it&#8217;s highly unlikely we will tax our way out, either&#8221; simply missed the boat. Which really is what inspired XLI. We know that outcomes at or better than Low Cost can happen, because in the period from 1998 to 2003 they did happen. Now as it turns out the 2003 tax cuts ushered in a productivity crash starting almost exactly 18 months after enactment (note I didn&#8217;t say &#8217;caused&#8217;, but the timing is pretty god damn ironic since that is when idiots like Gramm tell us the positive impact of tax cuts should start being observable) and so we did not see the continued improvements after 2003 that some of us were expecting. But the argument that we can never get off the floor seems pretty defeatest. (And yeah I now the argument from tech, and the argument from peak oil, I don&#8217;t find either compelling but will address them in comments if anyone wants.)</p>
<p>So the question really remains: are the economic results needed over the medium term to fully fund Social Security actually impossible? Or even unlikely? And why (and please use numbers)? Or you could flip the question around. What would the implications be for the total economy and more particularly the General Fund deficit if Low Cost happened? </p>
<p>Low Cost is about a lot more than funding Social Security. It goes right to a vision about the future of America. I know what Roubini&#8217;s answer would be to this question, but is there anyone else out there really believing that nothing we could do in the way of taxation and spending policy to get productivity and Real GDP off of the 1.7% and 2.3% floor now being assigned to them by IC?  I mean maybe we can&#8217;t get every half decade to act like the early sixties or the late nineties {ed}, but this notion that the future will never, ever be brighter than it was in 2003 no matter what we do goes beyond defeatism to anti-Americanism. (I thought it was us liberals that hated America and not the Chicago GSB).</p>
<p>I am not here to push Gore&#8217;s plan or Picken&#8217;s plan but if either one&#8217;s vision comes to reality in the next ten years we will be living in a whole new country. We have a Republican Party promising to put a Man on Mars in the next twenty years but they can&#8217;t or won&#8217;t promise 2.1% productivity and 3.3% Real GDP along the way?</p>
<p>Why oh why are economic conservatives running down America&#8217;s future by adopting Intermediate Cost economic assumptions? Or are they just pretending to accept those assumptions to sell Personal Account plans implicitly requiring better growth? Because as Dean Baker pointed out in his 2004 <a href="http://www.cepr.net/index.php/the-no-economist/policy-analyst-left-behind-test-for-social-security/">No Economist Left Behind</a> challenge, you don&#8217;t get to have both.</p>
<p>We know precisely what it would take to tax or grow our way out of at least the Social Security gap, the Trustees tell us in detail. And if we do have those outcomes we should see mirror effects in the General Fund, more GDP, more productivity, more labor participation all translate to more tax revenues. So the question really is for the defeatests: why assume Intermediate Cost? Plus what would be the implications of that for the markets anyway?</p>
