                                <p>I don&#8217;t claim to have studied Medicare in depth. They send me the Reports in the same envelope with the Social Security Reports and I browse through them, but that is pretty much it. So this post is more of a call for people more informed on aspects of Medicare to chip in. But I want to throw out some basics. For those who want to follow along the 2008 Report can be found <a href="http://www.treas.gov/offices/economic-policy/reports/medicare-report-2008.pdf">here</a>:</p>
<p>First while there is no such thing as MedicareMedicaidSocial Security and while I firmly believe that the deliberate lumping of them together as &#8216;entitlements&#8217; is mostly a weasel-word effort that allows attacks on SS via the backdoor, there is a certain structural overlap. All six Social Security Trustees serve on the seven member Medicare Trustees board where they are joined by the Administrator of the Centers for Medicare &#038; Medicaid Services. Which means when we score the outlook for Social Security we are also in part scoring the outlook for Medicare crisis because the Medicare Trustees not surprisingly adopt the Intermediate Cost assumptions of the Social Security Trustees, after all they are not schizoids. This has some implications which I will get to after laying down a couple more basics.</p>
<p>First Medicare is not a single program with a single funding source, instead it is made up of Medicare Parts A, B, C &#038; D.</p>
<p>Medicare Part A is Hospital Insurance and is paid for through payroll tax deductions, 3.01% in 2006. This tax differs from that of Social Security in one respect: it is not capped. But for the most part the better Social Security performs on the revenue side, the better Part A and its HI Trust Fund do, in short they track and overall we have seen the same progress in pushing out dates of Trust Fund Depletion. Somebody can fact check me on this but I believe that when Clinton entered office HI Trust Fund depletion was scheduled for 1999 or about seven years of cushion. By the 2007 Report that date had been pushed back to 2019, which was an increase of a full year over 2006. Why the improvement? Well the Trustees tell us it was &#8220;due to slightly higher projected payroll tax income and slightly lower benefits than previously estimated&#8221;. In other words their revenue model was too pessimistic, they used Intermediate Cost. Now the 2008 Report reports that Trust Fund Depletion is still scheduled for 2019 but several months earlier in the year than the 2007. Why the slight deterioration? &#8220;due to slightly lower projected payroll tax income and slightly higher projected benefits than previously estimated. For the 75-year projection period, the actuarial deficit is virtually the same as in last year’s report, at 3.54 rather than 3.55 percent of taxable payroll. &#8221; I don&#8217;t know the reason for the slightly higher projected benefits, but the reduced payroll tax income can be explained in three words: &#8216;crappy fourth quarter&#8217;. Social Security OAS was on track to beat revenue expectations right through September, then the floor fell out.</p>
<p>But the larger picture remains the same, if the economy outperforms Intermediate Cost then the Medicare HI Trust Fund gains more revenue and the outlook should improve. This is complicated somewhat by medical inflation, if most of your overall GDP growth is coming from increased medical costs then the net might end up negative. Which is where you readers come in, any thoughts on how this offsets?</p>
<p>Medicare Parts B, C, &#038; D are mostly funded via the General Fund suplemented by premiums from beneficiaries. Part B is Doctors, Part C is Medicare Advantage (private insurance alternative) and Part D is Drugs. As General Fund programs they are not particularly walled off in the way Part A is with results we saw playing out last week.</p>
<p>Opponents of Medicare don&#8217;t have much of an opening on the Part A side, not when its financial health has been improving even if the face of soaring medical costs overall. And you only have to pick up the paper or know someone who has been hosptialized for even invasive surgery. Chances are pretty good you get maybe one night and boom out you go.</p>
<p>Which leaves them left to attack B, C, &#038; D. Which leaves them in a quandary. Part D is a Bush initiative and hugely favorable to Big Pharma, while Part C is hugely favorable to private insurance companies. Which leaves Part B-Doctors. So how did they propose to do this? Follow me briefly below the fold.</p>
<p>It was rather diabolical really. Prior to the introduction of Part C &#038; D costs were roughly split between A &#038; B with A being the bigger brother of the two. And given their different roles and different funding schemes there was little reason to cross compare them. If a doctor getting paid under B was able to give in office care in a way that avoided hospitalization then A saves some money while the spending ratio shifts towards B. On the other hand if B is not taking Medicare patients you may have to wait for that stroke to kick in before being able to get hopitalized under A, at much higher cost thus sending the A/B ratio the other way. While I&#8217;ll defer to others on the cost specifics (S-T-R?) it would seem to the outside observer that keeping people out of the hospital (A) via preventive care (B) and simple generic medications for heart and chloesterol (D) would have to be cheaper than the alternative. On balance it would seem that long term the goal should be to get the overall ratio of medical resources to A down and to B &#038; D up. Which is where the 45% rule steps in.</p>
<p>The 45% rule came in with the same bill that introduced Parts C &#038; D, the Medicare Modernization Act. You can see MMA&#8217;s basic provisions at Wiki. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicare_Prescription_Drug,_Improvement,_and_Modernization_Act<br />But to see discussion of the 45% rule try this: http://www.ncpssm.org/news/archive/vp_45_percent_trigger/</p>
<p>What the 45% rule does is establish a trigger. As soon as the General Fund share of Medicare hits 45% then cuts to Part B are created immediately. Note not to Parts C &#038; D, both equally funded by the General Fund, that would take away from the Insurance Industry and Big Pharma. Nope lets pass the entire cost onto doctors.</p>
<p>Well that is just nutty. If this trigger were based on some overall share of GDP then it would make some sense but instead it is based on a ratio between the various components that is not directly related to overall deterioration or improvement in the health care system. If Doctor B takes on ten new Medicare patients and is able to keep three of them out of the hospital by prescribing a $1 a day generic supplied by Pharmacist D, who cares if Hospital Administrator A doesn&#8217;t get to bill medicare. We got three less people with heart attacks or strokes. Yet under the 45% rule the better preventive care gets the closer you get to the trigger. Counterproductive doesn&#8217;t begin to describe it. Unless of course your real goal is to force doctors to turn away Medicare patients to start with and so prove that this program is just another example of &#8216;Big Government is the Problem&#8217;.</p>
<p>Why do I say diabolical? Because they doubled down. First they set up a totally irrelevant ratio between A &#038; B and then saddled the B side with additional obligations in the way of C &#038; D and so practically guaranteeing the trigger. The system was set up to fail an artificial test and so pave the way for privatization under insurance company friendly Part C. Maybe others can see this in some other light, which I guess is what comments are for.</p>
<p>Health care mavens? (And don&#8217;t hesitate to comment or pose a question about Social Security, I just didn&#8217;t have a dedicated SS post prepared.)</p>

                                <p>I suspect few people know that the original Social Security Act set up not one but two retirement systems. Title 2 set up what we recognize as Social Security today, a worker funded retirement based on an insurance model. Title 1 set up something quite different. The history can be found on the SSA.gov website under <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/history/briefhistory3.html">Historical Background and Development of Social Security</a>.<br />
<blockquote>Following the outbreak of the Great Depression, poverty among the elderly grew dramatically. The best estimates are that in 1934 over half of the elderly in America lacked sufficient income to be self-supporting. Despite this, state welfare pensions for the elderly were practically non-existent before 1930. A spurt of pension legislation was passed in the years immediately prior to passage of the Social Security Act, so that 30 states had some form of old-age pension program by 1935. However, these programs were generally inadequate and ineffective. Only about 3% of the elderly were actually receiving benefits under these states plans, and the average benefit amount was about 65 cents a day.</p>
<p>There were many reasons for the low participation in state-run pension systems. Many elderly were reluctant to &#8220;go on welfare.&#8221; Restrictive eligibility criteria kept many poor seniors from qualifying. Some jurisdictions, while having state programs on the books, failed to actually implement them. Many of the state-passed pension laws provided for counties within the state to opt to participate in the pension program. As a result, in 1929 of the six states with operating pension laws on the books only 53 of the 264 counties eligible to adopt a pension plan actually did so. After 1929, the States began enacting laws without county options. By 1932 seventeen states had old age pension laws, although none were in the south, and 87% of the money available under these laws were expended in only three states (California, Massachusetts and New York).</p></blockquote>
<p> So our starting point is a hodge podge of underfunded and largely ineffective state old age plans. Title 1 established General Fund &#8216;Grants to States for Old-Age Assistance&#8217; or in other words a federal welfare system. Title 2 or Social Security as we know it was designed (and did) to phase out Title 1, but really didn&#8217;t start to do so until after 1950.<br />
<blockquote>The significance of the new social insurance program was that it sought to address the long-range problem of economic security for the aged through a contributory system in which the workers themselves contributed to their own future retirement benefit by making regular payments into a joint fund. It was thus distinct from the welfare benefits provided under Title I of the Act and from the various state &#8220;old-age pensions.&#8221; As President Roosevelt conceived of the Act, Title I was to be a temporary &#8220;relief&#8221; program that would eventually disappear as more people were able to obtain retirement income through the contributory system. </p></blockquote>
<p>. The key word is &#8220;eventually&#8221;, monthly benefits under Title 2 would not start until 1942 and for years would be swamped by benefits under Title 1.<br />
<blockquote>Because the program was still in its infancy, and because it was financed by low levels of payroll taxation, the absolute value of Social Security&#8217;s retirement benefits were very low. In fact, until 1951, the average value of the welfare benefits received under the old-age assistance provisions of the Act were higher than the retirement benefits received under Social Security. And there were more elderly Americans receiving old-age assistance than were receiving Social Security.</p></blockquote>
<p>. Okay what does all this have to do with covered worker ratio? Follow me below the fold.</p>
<p>(Reader Paul schooled me on the numbers. The overall point is sound but some of the arithmetic was off. So while I am busy fixing up the post please see Paul&#8217;s numbers in comments.)<br />It is common to hear people making claims that the ratio of workers to retirees went from an initial 16 to 1 at program inception down to 3 to 1 today enroute to 2 to 1 &#8216;soon&#8217;. Which sounds scary until you realize that no one was even eligible for benefits until 1942, the ratio before that point being literally infinite. Moreover all Americans were paying taxes to support Title 1, if we examined this from the standpoint of taxpayer to federally funded retiree you would end up with a much smaller initial ratio. Moreover the net effect of the phase in of Title 2 and the phaseout of Title 1 was to give all taxpayers an effective tax break with wage workers ultimately shouldering the entire burden for their own retirement. Not that people who earn their income from returns on capital showed much appreciation.</p>
<p>So much of that 16 to 1 transition to 3 to 1 was the result of a transformation from two programs with two sets of beneficiaries, one funded by all taxpayers and the other funded only by wage workers. That is we are not really talking fundamental demographic trends but instead designed policy outcomes. But the distortion doesn&#8217;t stop there.</p>
<p>If we examine <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/II_project.html#105643">Figure II.D3.—Number of Covered Workers Per OASDI Beneficiary</a> we do see a reduction in the ratio from the 3.2-3.4 level typical since 1974 to about 2.2% in 2030, Boomer demographics are in fact real. But this ignores a couple of points. First of all the ratio is not as often stated worker to retiree, with the implication that the idle old are parasitic on the working young, instead it is worker to BENEFICIARY which includes minor children of deceased workers, those childrens mothers, disabled workers, and surviving spouses of one income households. That is not all of this is about paying for greens fees for geezers in Phoenix. In fact in 2007 the total amount of Social Security paid to people other than the retired worker was just over <s>50%</s> 34%. <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/III_cyoper.html#129884">Table III.A5.—Distribution of Benefit Payments by Type of Beneficiary or Payment, Calendar Years 2006 and 2007 [Amounts in millions]</a>. If Social Security did not exist much of this burden would fall back on the overall taxpayer. (Or I suppose we could simply have orphans and paraplegics begging in the streets instead.)<br />{Reader Paul astutely notes that I am not including Aged Widows and Widowers with Retired Workers in figuring out how much of this is really going to seniors. Well in my thinking these people would fall in the category of people society would need to cover anyway. But it is a fair point and would drop that 34% down to 21%}</p>
<p>Which brings us to the second point. A lot of the narrative about Social Security is deliberately shaped around the intergenerational unfairness narrative with Boomers placed in the position of villain while our hero is played by long suffering young Gen-X worker/father. First that ignores the fact that under current projections most of Boomer retirement is in fact funded but second ignores the fact that it only describes a part of the actual demographics. To look at the bigger picture we would need to examine the numbers in <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/V_demographic.html#167717">Table V.A2.—Social Security Area Population as of July 1 and Dependency Ratios, Calendar Years 1950-2085</a>. If we do we see that the actual ratio of people 20-64, i.e. mostly workers, to people over 65, i.e. mostly retirees in 2007 was in fact .207 or 5 to 1 rather than the loosely cited 3 to 1. While this ratio does increase due to Boomer demographic realities it only goes to .357 by 2035, a point at which Gen-X themselves will be entering retirement. This isn&#8217;t to understate the realities, going from 5 to 1 working age to retirement age to 2.8 to 1 does require some adjustment. On the other hand if we shift focus and look at total dependency ratio, which includes children, and then examine it in historical perspective things look quite a bit different.</p>
<p>In 1965 total dependency ratio was at .905. In 2007 total dependency ratio is at .667. in 2030 it will be back up to .806. And the reason for the change is pretty obvious, all Boomers were children in 1965, all Boomers are working age in 2007, all Boomers will be retirement age in 2030. But if America didn&#8217;t break at the expense of feeding, clothing and educating us while we were children, it hardly will do so when it comes to feeding us when we are old.</p>
<p>In the end the old 16:1 worker to retiree going to 3:1 going to 2:1 narrative is an attempt to convince people that demography is running amuck when instead most of that is the result of phasing out one program (Title 1) in favor of another (Title 2), with the rest the result of a combination of a large birth cohort (Boomers) life cycling through followed by assumed increases in lifespans for Gen-X retirees. It is just not as dire as the scaremongers would have you want to think.</p>

                                <p>Lets take a trip in Mr. Wizard&#8217;s Way Back Machine all the way to the year 2000. At that point we see Social Security geek Webb jumping in excitement (being one of the few people in history to get excited over Social Security financials). What is the source of this rather odd behavior? Well it came from an examination of the following number series.<br />1996&#8212;2029<br />1997&#8212;2029<br />1998&#8212;2032<br />1999&#8212;2034<br />2000&#8212;2037<br />Now when the Report was released in March 2000 it was certainly plausible that the next January would see the swearing in of President Gore. At that point no one had really heard of hanging chads or Diebold. Anyway it was reasonable to consider the long term implications of these dates.</p>
<p>The first column is Report Year, the second column projected Trust Fund Depletion, at that point in time the standard measure for &#8216;Crisis&#8217;. Now you can look at this series as being an improvement of eight years over a four year period (March 1996 to March 2000) which gives you an improvement rate of 2 years per year, or you can push the envelope and date the improvement over three years (March 1997 to March 2000) which gives you a rate of 2 2/3 per year, but it really doesn&#8217;t matter for our purposes. Because an event that retreats out on average at even one year per year is an event that never comes, if that rate is doubled that event rapidly recedes over the event horizon. Okay lets imagine President Gore approaching the end of his second term in 2008 having overseen a similar improvement at the 2 year per year rate in Depletion date. This would put depletion in the year 2053. A little calculation and we can see that Boomers would be ranging in age from 89 to 107, a point in time in which the mortality tables suggest more than half of our youngest cohort (the birth class of 64) will be dead. The suggestion that Social Security &#8216;crisis&#8217;, at least as it was defined in 2000, as being caused by Boomer Retirement would be just as dead.</p>
<p>Okay remembering we are still in the year 2000, under a Democratic President committed to &#8216;Save Social Security First&#8217; and a Presidential Candidate committed to the same goal (though using the ultimately misleading metaphor of &#8216;Lock Box), what should have been the response to that number series? Well I&#8217;ll tell you, two questions should have been asked:</p>
<p>1) What caused the dates to change in the way they did? and<br />2) Can whatever caused the changes go on?</p>
<p>But I can tell you from experience that hardly anyone in a position of influence was asking that question, if fact if you separate out Dean Baker and Mark Weisbrot that number starts approaching zero. Which is why Baker and Weisbrot called their 1999 book <a href="http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/035468.html">Social Security: the Phony Crisis</a>. If you follow me below the fold I am going to make a stab at answering the question of why these questions were not asked and then offer some answers to both.</p>
<p>Well the kindest answer is that after all those numbers were not in fact in the bag and that we should just defer to the professional judgement of the staff of the Office of the Chief Actuary as signed off by the Trustees of Social Security. After all in 2037 the Boomers would be ranging in age from 73 to 91 and would still be projected to having a major though declining impact on Social Security.</p>
<p>A more cynical answer is that Social Security &#8216;crisis&#8217; was in 2000 an advantage to both the Democratic Administration and its Republican opposition. For Clinton &#038; Gore &#8216;crisis&#8217; was largely defensive. Their argument was that tax cuts in the face of this impending crunch were reckless, and that far better would be to maintain budget restraint and pay down debt held by the public (which is what &#8216;Lock Box&#8217; actually boils down to operationally). On the other hand for the Republicans crisis was an advantage in three ways. One it was a nice poster child for their overall &#8216;Big Government is the Problem&#8217; narrative. Two its existence allowed them to push their then 64 year dream of killing Social Security in play. The third advantage was a little more subtle. Under their Supply Side theory the only real way to finance Social Security long term was to grow the economy through tax cuts, in their topsy-turvy world cutting taxes for the rich was simply a means to help out future elderly poor. Unfortunately their theory ran into trouble when it encountered our reality.</p>
<p>In the event asking those questions was not particularly convenient for either side at the time. Of course in the end the Republicans won the near term battle, they got to keep &#8216;crisis&#8217; in play and get their tax cuts anyway. Alright! Back in the Way Back Machine and lets take a trip forward to Nov. 2004. How has our number series held up? Well pretty good.<br />2000&#8212;2037<br />2001&#8212;2038<br />2002&#8212;2041<br />2003&#8212;2042<br />2004&#8212;2042<br />The rate of improvement certainly had slowed down, but still we had a total of five years of improvement over a four year period, moreover we got those pesky Boomers a little bit older and more out of the way. In 2042 they would be 78 to 96 and generally shuffling off the Buffalo and points beyond.</p>
<p>By 2004 those questions should have been being asked loudly and often:<br />1) What caused the dates to change in the way they did? and<br />2) Can whatever caused the changes go on?<br />Instead BushCo simply maintained the same stance they did back before 2000, they needed Social Security &#8216;crisis&#8217; in order to achieve their agenda, and their response was to cover their ears and shout &#8220;Wah, wah, wah. We can&#8217;t hear you!!&#8221;. Which didn&#8217;t save them during the &#8216;There is no Crisis&#8217; fight of 2005. But also didn&#8217;t make them give up their long term goals.</p>
<p>So what are the answers to the questions? Well lets dispose of the first typical answer, the dates of depletion did not change year over year because of changes in demographic assumptions. Those assumptions remained relatively stable over the period of Report years in question. There is no doubt that demography is hugely important in determining the long term outlook, but it has little impact on year to year reporting because generally speaking the fertility and mortality numbers were already baked into the cake.</p>
<p>Nope in examining the Reports year over year to see what changed from say 1999 to 2000 to cause a three year improvement in a single ear and the answer is clear: the economy did much, much better than projected. Moreover as Prof. Rosser and I have demonstrated in the past, the response in the Reporting was odd. In the face of continual underestimates of current year performance the reaction of the actuaries was to actually lower their projections going forward in what for the world looked like a pure effort to maintain &#8216;crisis&#8217;. This was particularly notable in the 2003 and 2004 Reports (see Tables V.B1 and V.B2). In particular rather inexplicable carving away at second year numbers went along with a milder slicing of current year numbers. The result as I showed in my Nov. 2004 post <a href="http://bruceweb.blogspot.com/2004/11/what-is-low-cost-alternative-what-does.html">What is the Low Cost Alternative?</a>,  was Low Cost always returning the same operational result, Social Security funded but not over funded, a result which stayed constant through the 2007 Report year. (2008 shows Low Cost actually overfunding Social Security). So much for the first question: what changed? Economic growth numbers.</p>
<p>The answer to the second question is pretty easy, at least taken from when it was asked in 2000. Can this process continue? Absolutely because it did. The outlook for Social Security improved steadily from 2000 to 2003 because numbers on the whole came in better than expected. Now it is true that progress stalled in 2004 and actually went backwards in 2005 and 2006 only to improve again in 2007 and 2008 and we can if you like explore each of those Report years separately to see why that happened, but the general answer is that productivity stalled in such a way as to bring numbers more in line with Intermediate Cost than had been typical of the 1997 to 2003 period when outcomes closer or better than Low Cost. </p>
<p>(But all that goes to show you is that the idea that cutting taxes on the wealthy serves to boost investment and so productivity and so ultimately real wages for workers is not in fact supported by the actual numbers since the actual tax cut. But that would be to cut in on Spencer&#8217;s turf.)</p>
<p>Can productivity (or GDP or real wage or whatever interrelated measure you like) improve in ways that come in better than Intermediate Cost and so continue the longer range trend that would have Depletion (and so &#8216;crisis&#8217;) continue to move out in time. Well opinions vary. All I can say is that the people who were dismissive of Low Cost in the 1997 to 2003 period were all by the numbers proved to be wrong. When those same people insist that I just don&#8217;t get how ridiculous those assumptions are, I just have to ask &#8220;Well where were you when I was asking this question back in 2000?&#8221;</p>

                                <p>Well more than you might think.</p>
<p>If you examine the economic and demographic assumptions that together generate the standard Intermediate Cost alternative of the Social Security Trustees you see a picture of a future America that is kind of bleak. I mean I lived through the period from 1968 to 1983 and economically it was not much fun. We had war and assasinations and oil crises and three recessions and a constitutional crisis over impeachment. It wasn&#8217;t all doom and gloom, over that same rough time period the world transtioned from the baseline assumption that nuclear armeggedon was pretty much ultimately unavoidable to a place where that prospect seemed inconceivable. And as a kid who grew up with school &#8220;duck and cover&#8221; drills that was an unalloyed good, but still there was a widespread sense that in particular these kind of economic outcomes were outside the norm, that times had been better before and that times would be better again. In part this was just nostalgia for an America that for a lot of people really never was, after all &#8216;Happy Days&#8217; and &#8216;Back to the Future&#8217; were not exactly documentaries, but Reagan&#8217;s &#8216;Morning in America&#8217; had a real resonance to people, there was a real sense that the future could be better than the immediate past and even the imagined past of the fifties as seen through the lens of &#8216;Father Knows Best&#8217;.</p>
<p>But none of that optimism shows up in the Tables and Figures of the Social Security Reports. Instead they and commenters thereon insist that the future is simply going to mirror the outcomes of 1968-1983, indeed just the other day I had a commenter that insisted that Low Cost outcomes were impossible because they were inconsistent with the last forty years. Well that is what happens when you pick a starting point that manages to take in all of the worst post-war years and ignores everything that happened before. I will be unpacking some numbers below the fold but want to leave these doomsayers with a hopefully provocative question.</p>
<p>Why the hell are you betting against America? While we maybe well and truly entering permanent Roubini-land why are you doubling down based on that?</p>
<p>As I say it all starts with the numbers, and in particular the numbers as seen in Table V.B1: Principal Economic Assumptions, Table V.B2: Additional Economic Factors, and Table V.A1: Principal Demographic assumptions, all of which (and many more) to be found in <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/trLOT.html">2008 Social Security Report: List of Tables</a>. The Economic tables show outcomes in five year periods since 1960 and annually since 1997 and then turn around and project annual results for the following ten years  and then for multi-year periods (V.B1) or intervals (V.B2) after that. The Demographic table reports both by interval back to 1940 and then annually from 1995. Going forward Table V.A1 projects results with 5 year intervals.</p>
<p>Generally speaking the various models of the Trustees&#8217; Report assume that under all three alternatives (Low Cost, Intermediate Cost, and High Cost) results will settle out in the relatively short term at ultimate levels. Which is just another way of defining long term sustainability of the US economy under projections that are presumed to range from optimistic (Low Cost) to pessimistic (High Cost) with Intermediate serving as a median. So lets take a look at some of those numbers and contrast them with 2004, a year of good economic performance but not one that most people would remember as exceptional.</p>
<p>Productivity: 2004  2.4%;  High Cost ultimate 1.4%;  Intermediate Cost 1.7%; Low Cost 2.0%<br />Real Wage: 2004  1.8%; High Cost .6%; Intermediate Cost  1.1%; Low Cost 1.6%<br />Unemployment: 2004  5.5%; High Cost 6.5%; Intermediate Cost 5.5%; Low Cost 4.5%<br />Real GDP: 2004 3.6%; High Cost 1.2%; Intermediate Cost 2.1%; Low Cost 2.9%<br />Immigration: 2004 1.25 million; High Cost .77 million; Intermediate Cost 1.025 million; Low Cost 1.305 million</p>
<p>Now I know some people will want to jump in and start the standard defense of &#8216;Boomers!&#8217; and &#8216;Covered worker ratio!!&#8217;. And yeah I get that but these ultimate numbers are all for period beyond 2050 when the impact of the Boomers on the economy should be pretty much a fading memory (we will be 86 to 104 in 2050). Why on earth should we assume that even optimistic numbers for the second half of the twenty-first century will trail the numbers of the second half of the twentieth century so badly? I understand that conditions approaching perma-recession could happen, I am the farthest thing from a global warming denier or from not recognizing the food/fuel crisis going forwards. On the other hand I am not just ready to simply write America&#8217;s economic future off as a lost cause either.</p>
<p>I am not happy with the status of America today. Which doesn&#8217;t mean I have lost faith in its possibilities tommorrow. Which know it or not is exactly what embracers of Social Security &#8216;crisis&#8217; have done. Dudes and dudettes what caused you to lose your faith here? Criminy its the Fourth of July.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <blockquote><p>Even before the latest flooding, a group representing engineers said the United States needed to spend about $1 trillion more than it does now to bring infrastructure up to par with modern needs and standards.</p></blockquote>
<p> Wow. A trillion dollars is a lot of money. But as it happens we have in fact an identified revenue stream that is more or less coincidentally projected to run just about that amount in cash surpluses over the next decade, and more than double that if you include interest accrued on the existing fund balances. That is if we take a little look at the dollar figures in the following table: <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/IV_SRest.html#253691">Table IV.A3.—Operations of the Combined OASI and DI Trust Funds, Calendar Years 2003-17 1 [Amounts in billions]</a></p>
<p>So here is the deal. First I propose that we take all cash surpluses from FICA and invest them in interest earning state and local construction bonds. That alone gets you about $600-700 billion over the next decade (and all before Social Security is projected to run into a shortfall where cash income from tax falls behind cost). Assuming Intermediate Cost projections. Under Low Cost cash surpluses extend to 2023, and of course under outcomes better than IC but trailing LC you get dates in between. In any event we have a minimum ten year window to invest these already existing funds in infrastructure, and by reinvesting earnings on the muni bonds get pretty close to backfilling the whole gap. Because it gets better. Highway, bridge and school construction are all labor intensive undertakings, even more so when you take into account the wages of the people supplying the concrete and steel, to say nothing about the wages of the people who sell groceries and beer to the guys that spend their days working at the cement plant. Which is to say Social Security not only earns whatever return it gets directly on the bond, it also captures 12.4% of every contract dollar that ultimately goes to wages. Cha-ching!! I don&#8217;t know how you would calculate the Return On Investment on that combination. But I suspect you are creeping real close to double digit returns.</p>
<p>There is a risk that the budgeteers, being deprived of this source of cheap borrowing, would simply respond by cutting transportation spending from the General Fund. But not only is this response not likely, it wouldn&#8217;t really matter if it did happen. Why? Well follow me below the fold.</p>
<p>Why would a total spending offset be unlikely? Because Congressmen and Senators really, really like to take credit for infrastucture projects, that is how you get highways, bridges and airports named after you. If you set up a system where Social Security surpluses were invested evenly by Congressional District it would be hard for any individual Congressman to claim credit, after all it is just workers&#8217; money being reinvested creating jobs for workers. So I suspect some extra money would always be flowing, earmarks are not going away totally, transformed perhaps but not vanishing.</p>
<p>As to why spending offsets wouldn&#8217;t really matter so much if they happened. Well as long as the total effect isn&#8217;t negative, that is less net dollars going to these kind of projects, the total benefits far outweigh the foregone spending. But before we go there let me put stage two into play.</p>
<p>Along with using the current cash surpluses I would argue that the General Fund should take a proactive approach to the Trust Fund and invest an amount equal to the amount of the interest being accrued on the current Trust Funds into the Infrastructure Investment Fund. This would have the effect of freezing the Trust Fund in place at about $2.6 trillion (if we could get this done in <s>2029</s> 2009). Which is not a bad thing, not at all. Freezing the Trust Fund means freeing our children and grandchildren from trillions of dollars in future General Fund debt. Of course they will be on the hook for paying off the transportation and school bonds but at least they will be able to see what they were paying for in literally concrete terms.</p>
<p>Now it is worth noting that funding for the Infrastructure Fund doesn&#8217;t stop at the actual shortfall date when income from taxes trails costs, as long as the interest being earned on the Trust Fund exceeds the remaining gap the Infrastructure Fund would still be credited with the overage, under Intermediate Cost projections you would be getting some money from this mechanism all the way until 2023.</p>
<p>At which point we would need to make a decision. The easy answer would be to start drawing down on the assets of the Infrastructure Fund, that is rather than reivesting its earnings we could start using them in conjunction with Trust Fund redemptions to extend the period when the General Fund has to transfer cash. Or we could simply bite the bullet and pay for the entire gap between income from tax and cost by direct redemptions of the Special Treasuries. The net result would be that the Trust Fund would be reduced to its target of a 100 Trust Fund ratio even faster than projected. On the other hand this would give the Infrastructure Fund that many more years of compounding through reinvestment.</p>
<p>So what is the end game here? Well some fifteen to twenty years down the road we have us a Trust Fund holding its accepted minimum level of reserves, still presumedly held in Special Treasures. We also have a revenue stream via FICA and tax on benefits that was significantly augmented by additional wage dollars from the infrastructure investment in the meantime. Then we have an independent Infrastructure Fund that can be tapped to backfill any gap between then current income and then current cost.</p>
<p>I kind of like this picture. One it puts the intergenerational equity problem to rest for all time, current benefits would be paid out of a combination of current tax and current returns on real assets. Two it blows away the phony &#8216;Phony IOU&#8217; argument. Three it shuts up those who would blather about how returns on equities magically out earn returns on Treasuries, they simply will not be able to match the reliability of munis at equivalent rates of return (or go for it in comments). Four and most interesting perhaps it moves financing of Social Security into progressive directions without it being turned into welfare. Because states and localities have two major sources of income: property tax and sales tax. Want to live in that big ass house, really need that thirty foot speedboat, or sixty foot cruiser, or houseful of designer furniture, or that Bentley? Well know that some portion of your property tax and sales tax is going to repay bond dollars borrowed from wage workers. Instead of approaching Mr. Rich cap in hand for a handout, Mr. Worker ends up in the position of creditor.</p>
<p>All in all a lot better way of securing some infrastructure funding over at least the near term than trying to raise it through the Lotto.</p>

                                <p>For those of you not in the mood for numeric wonkery Biggs also points us to Furman&#8217;s response to Larry Lindsey&#8217;s <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB121391705573990175.html?mod=Letters">Obama Turns FDR Upside Down</a>. In an letter included in <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB121444593736705901.html?mod=googlenews_wsj">Obama&#8217;s Proposals for Social Security Considered</a> Furman gives us this:<br />
<blockquote>There is much to disagree with in Larry Lindsey&#8217;s June 20 op-ed, &#8220;Obama Turns FDR Upside Down.&#8221; Barack Obama&#8217;s proposal to extend the life of Social Security is fully consistent with the spirit of Social Security, just as the elimination of the payroll tax cap for Medicare has not undermined support for that program. Mr. Obama&#8217;s proposal would also help to restore long-run fiscal balance, contributing to a strong and growing economy. It is modeled on a proposal floated by Sen. Lindsey Graham &#8212; a proposal that John McCain publicly said he could support.</p>
<p>More important, Mr. Lindsey is wrong about Sen. Obama&#8217;s policy on the payroll tax. Mr. Obama has stated that he would like to extend solvency while protecting middle-class families and asking those making over $250,000 to pay their fair share. As president, he would work with Congress on a bipartisan basis to design the details of such a change, including the tax rate, how it is phased in over time, the linkage between these tax payments and benefits and other critical design elements of this plan. He has not proposed a 12.4-percentage point tax increase on earnings above $250,000.</p>

<p> My translation of this is &#8220;We don&#8217;t really have a Social Security plan. We just want to assure everyone that it is progressive, i.e. paid for by the wealthy&#8221;. Otherwise this is pretty thin gruel.</p>

                                <p>More homework for Coberly and Arne (and any others who want to join in).</p>
<p>Andrew Biggs <a href="http://andrewgbiggs.blogspot.com/2008/06/treasury-department-releases-social.html">alerts</a> us to the release of the Treasury Department&#8217;s <a href="http://www.treas.gov/press/releases/reports/ssissuebriefno.%205%20no%20cover.pdf">Issue Brief No. 5: Social Security Reform: Strategies for Progressive Benefit Adjustments</a></p>
<p>The proposal seems quite interesting. Rather than simply readjusting the benefit schedule by some blunt change in method of calculating CPI, this would adjust benefits with an eye on both the income and cost sides. The end result would be to adjust the benefit both in relation to actual changes in real wages and prices. This contrasts to the current model which rather locks you into a rigid set of projections from the outset.</p>
<p>The proposal seems to have two big advantages from my perspective. First it pretty much sidelines the Intermediate Cost/Low Cost probability discussion, if IC happens you get the result as shown in the Issue Brief, if something closer to LC happens you get a progressively better result by an automatic readjustment of the benefit formula in relation to actual real world results. And nothing in the model would prevent some slight adjustment up or down in FICA as circumstances warrented.</p>
<p>But the second advantage is even better. Whether we have a preference for a tax based solution, a benefit based solution, or some blend, once that preference is accepted all urgency bleeds out of &#8216;crisis&#8217;, it is then deemed fixed, and so any impulse to move to private accounts is made that much more difficult to sell.</p>
<p>Warning the Issue Brief is kind of wonkish, but for those who don&#8217;t mind putting on the green eyeshades worth reading and commenting on.</p>

                                <p>One thing we heard in the comments to <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/06/social-security-questionan-op-ed.html">Coberly&#8217;s bravura Social Security op-ed</a> was an opinion that the younger generation should be allowed to opt out of the program so that they can save their own way to retirement riches.  This had me thinking, what&#8217;s the data saying about recent behavior — after all, factors including the declining prevalence of private defined-benefit pensions would increase households&#8217; need for private savings.</p>
<p>So are they actually saving early and often (a good idea, BTW)?  Alas, the Fed&#8217;s <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/oss/oss2/scfindex.html">Survey of Consumer Finances</a> isn&#8217;t very fresh: we can expect 2007 survey results sometime next year.  Still, the 2004 results give us a bit of stock bust and housing bubble, and the ability to make some long-range comparisons.  Here&#8217;s the median net worth, holdings of financial and nonfinancial assets, and debt loads [*] for households headed by under-35s and 35-44 year olds, in thousands of 2004 dollars:</p>
<p>Ups and downs of the housing and stock markets being what they are, younger households in 2004 find themselves no more wealthy than their predecessors of nearly a generation ago, despite a a lot of risk transfer from institutions to individuals.  This certainly doesn&#8217;t make much of a prima facie case for removing the retirement safety net.</p>
<p>It&#8217;ll be very interesting to see the non-financial asset and debt data for &#8217;07.</p>
<p>[*] A quirk of the reporting is that the median asset holdings are reported for the subsets of households with assets.  Given the prevalence of asset holdings for these aggregates, the asset and debt figures are roughly the 55-60th percentile figures.</p>

                                <p>Andrew Biggs was Deputy Commissioner of Social Security until February, previously he was a top analyst at Cato&#8217;s Project for Social Security Privatization, currently he is doing something quite similar at AEI. He has a blog called <a href="http://andrewgbiggs.blogspot.com/">Notes on Social Security Reform</a> which deserves more traffic, not just because Andrew is a nice guy and polite host, but because I believe he is dead wrong. Very well informed and educated on the numbers, perhaps nobody better. But still wrong.</p>
<p>He left the following in comments on Soc Sec XXII, and raises the issue of how naive do you have to believe to put any credence in Low Cost outcomes. Well lets see:<br />
<blockquote>Sometimes when I talk to the Social Security actuaries about the problems with the low-cost projections, they reply that it&#8217;s not a big deal because no one actually believes there&#8217;s any real likelihood of them taking place. I&#8217;ll send them a link to this post to prove my point.</p>
<p>This topic came up at the AEI event on the tech panel report last Friday {edit to eliminate link not yet working-bcw} . Several members of the panel made the same point re the Low Cost Scenario, that&#8217;s it&#8217;s at such a low level of likelihood that it&#8217;s hard to interpret what it even means.</p></blockquote>
<p>Which I can only interpret as &#8216;Bruce is a dummy&#8217;. Well lets try saying that in numbers.<br />If we look at the Bush years few of them stand out, particularly in contrast to the 90s but one of the best was 2004. And if we look at the projections for Low Cost they basically settle out by 2012 and stay pretty much at those levels through the remainder of the 75 year window. What happens if we look at the respective numbers for Productivity, Real Wage and Real GDP for 2004, 2012, and ultimate?<br />(all numbers are drawn from Tables V.B1 and V.B2 of the 2008 Report <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/trLOT.html">List of Tables</a>)</p>
<p>Low Cost 2004/2012/ultimate</p>
<p>Productivity 2.4%/2.0%/2.0%<br />Real Wage   1.8%/1.2%/1.1%<br />GDP              3.6%/2.5%/2.1%<br />Naive number crunching below the fold.</p>
<p>Now 2004 was in retrospect not a bad year, but was it so over the top good so as never to be repeated, and indeed not even to be approached, ever?</p>
<p>If we take our first and second column we can contrast 2004 and 2012. In percentage terms what are we looking at:<br />Productivity 2.4% to 2.0% or 17% slowdown in growth rate<br />Real Wage 1.8% to 1.2% or 33% slowdown<br />GDP     3.6% to 2.5% or 31% slowdown</p>
<p>Now while these short term outcomes seem not unreasonable given the current housing/food/oil/credit crunch we are expected to accept that not only is this sharp slowdown permanent but that it is so over optimistic as to not even be worth discussing. Call me crazy but this seems outlandish to me, the argument that it will never, ever be economically better in America than it was in 2004, that in retrospect Bush economic policies in fact extracted the maximum possible growth out of the economy and then 25-30% more is absurd. Until or unless someone can make that case, preferedly using numbers.</p>
<p>Because it only gets worse when you look at Intermediate Cost, supposedly the median projection. Lets take our series 2004,  2012, ultimate  and use the same three variables:</p>
<p>Productivity 2.4%/1.8%/1.7% or 25% slowdown by 2012<br />Real Wage   1.8%/1.2%/1.1%  or 33% slowdown<br />GDP              3.6%/2.6%/2.1%  or 28% slowdown</p>
<p>Keep in mind that per the actuaries we are to accept this as the 50/50 mark, the chances being even that long term economic performance will be even worse.</p>
<p>Which raises some questions in my head. What is it structurally about the U.S. economy that suggests this is a reasonable median projection for the medium to long term? Is it simply out of the question to believe that some year in the future might be as good as 2004 was? Because as recently as 1999 the numbers were Productivity 2.4%, Real Wage 2.7%, Real GDP 4.4%, run those percentages against 2012 Intermediate and I want to start crying.</p>
<p>One final shot. It may be that there are arguments why this astonishing and permanent crash in growth rates is in fact a reasonable median, but all of those arguments simply undercut any basis for the notion that tax cuts on capital automatically translated to increased investment and so productivity. Because if you look at the time series the degradation starts hitting right at Q4 2005 or right at the point where tax cutters tell us we can expect to see the effects (18 months from enactment). If this is the miracle of tax cuts at work, they can keep it.</p>
<p>In any event it&#8217;s going to take a lot better data and arguments than I am seeing to convince me that these numbers simply represent the best that America can do.</p>

                                <p>Although a lot of people are aware that &#8216;Low Cost is Out There&#8217; it is difficult to impossible to find anyone who takes it seriously. Some experts simply dismiss it out of hand (Samwick), others point to the Stochastic Projections and simply deem it unlikely (Biggs), then again others reject it on grounds that run from legitimate ($130/barrel oil; $8 bushel corn futures) to ridiculous (fertility {a long story to explain why}). But the fact remains that unlikely does not mean impossible, we may very well see outcomes approaching Low Cost. And if we do the result will rock our world, because the Brave New World of Low Cost has real world implications that range well beyond retirement security.</p>
<p>So I propose we throw probability considerations to the wind and undertake a guided tour through LowCostLand. To switch literary references those that dare can follow me through the Looking Glass.</p>

<div></div>
<p>Figure II.D6 from the 2008 Report shows us the contrast between Intermediate Cost (II) and Low Cost (I) at a glance. The chart shows Trust Fund ratios over time under all three alternatives provided by the Trustees. Alternative II or IC shows the standard and familiar narrative, the growth in the Trust Fund ratio slows after 2014 stalls in 2017 and then shrinks more or less rapidly until the Trust Fund is exhausted in 2041. (We should note that the stall in the growth of the ratio does not immediately show as an absolute shinkage in the dollar balance, that actually continues to grow until 2023, the distinction between TF ratio and cash balance will be important later on). Alternative III or High Cost shows much the same picture only accelerated. But we are here to examine Alternative I, that of Low Cost.</p>
<p>Here we see the TF ratio continuing to increase all of the way to 2023 and  a level of 450, then a decline down to 390 by 2041, then about a fifteen year period of relative stability until around 2055 which is followed by a marked upward movement through the rest of the 75 year actuarial window. For the purposes of this post I intend to ignore the period past mid-century, it has interesting implications of its own, ones that I have already covered in my old post from 2006 <a href="http://bruceweb.blogspot.com/2006/01/interest-on-interest-threat.html">Interest on Interest: a Threat</a>. Instead I want to look at the medium term consequences of Low Cost between 2008 and 2041.</p>
<p>Okay, lets look at first order effects. If we flash forward to 2041 we see some pretty self-satisfied Boomers, (including that cranky old guy waving his cane in the air yelling &#8220;I told them rat bastards!! Right back in Ought Eight!!!&#8221; Don&#8217;t worry about old Mr. Webb, buy him a glass of beer and he quiets right down). Under Low Cost outcomes they ended up with 100% of scheduled benefits, in their case the equation runs 100% of 160% = 160%. Moreover their kids either already in retirement or nearing it also look to get full benefits without having to endure an increase in retirement age. And just as important the grandkids were able to pay for it all at the same 12.4% rate the Boomers paid. The question of intergenerational equity never ends up getting raised. At this point we could wrap up the fairy tale in traditional fashion with &#8220;And they all lived happily ever after&#8221;. But instead we are going to invoke that incredibly annoying TV pitch man Billy Whatisname and cry out &#8220;But wait!! There&#8217;s more!!!&#8221;.</p>
<p>Because there is. What happens if we translate that curve into dollars? The Trustees present future outcomes in both constant 2008 dollars and in then current dollars. To keep relative tax burdens steady I propose to use the former and so use <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/VI_OASDHI_dollars.html#140103">Table VI.F7.—Operations of the Combined OASI and DI Trust Funds, in Constant 2008 Dollars, Calendar Years 2008-85 [In billions]</a>. First thing to note is that Low Cost does not mean No Cost, that dip in the ratio between 2023 and 2041 represents transfers from the General Fund to Social Security. For example in 2025 the gap between Social Security tax revenue and Cost is $68 billion. Okay a substantial sum of money but only 24% of the actual interest earned that year. In 2035 we are looking at a bill of $159 billion or roughly the same as the amount we are apparently raising effortlessly for this years stimulus package and still only 48% of the interest accrued that year. But by 2045 the needed transfer is down to $104 billion. In 2055 down to $40 billion and finally in 2065 Low Cost has Social Security back with a cash surplus of $18 billion.</p>
<p>Which tells us what? Well a couple of things. First the fact that we never need to pay more than half of the interest owed in any given year means that the effective interest rate on the Special Treasuries is much lower than the nominal rate during the payback period from 2023 to 2060, in fact at that latter date we will be paying interest at a rate of .15% or about 40 times less than the nominal 5%. But it is the second fact that is the most mind-blowing. Under Low Cost there is never any need to pay back any of the principal. None, zip, nada. If you look at the numbers of Intermediate Cost you see the functional equivalent of a fully amortized loan, that is interest only to 2023 and then totally paid down by 2041. Under Low Cost that loan in translated into interest only from about 2027 to 2061, at ever dropping rates, and then can if we choose simply be written off. Now whether the people living in the years after mid-century choose to take this course or not is not under my control, I won&#8217;t be caring either way by that point, but that future outcome has some real world implications for the year 2008.</p>
<p>Back to Table VI.F7. When we talk about current and projected debt at levels around $9 trillion and rising we normally concede at some point that we will have to pay it all back, which leads people to cluck their tongues about the Present Value of all that debt. But at this point in time a full 24% of that outstanding debt is represented by the Special Treasuries in the Trust Fund, and that percentage is scheduled to rise sharply over time. Under Intermediate Cost assumptions Intragovernmental debt for Social Security rises to over $5.5 trillion in non-inflation adjusted dollars by 2023 (about $5 trillion in constant dollars) and all has to be paid off with additional cost for interest over an eighteen year period. And almost all of this debt repayment occurs within the current term of the 30 year bond. Which means that to one degree or another it is already being priced in with the expectation that Treasury will have to go hat in hand to the public (and the Chinese Central Bank) to borrow that $5 trillion plus interest. Unless if doesn&#8217;t have to, under Low Cost all that is required is a much smaller amount of borrowing to pay off only a portion of the interest owed on the Trust Funds.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll leave it to better arithmetic minds to calculate the discount. But a lot of our thinking about current accounts, the affordability of tax cuts, the strain represented by future medical costs is colored by the prospect of having to pay down trillions in debt to Social Security over the next three decades and still coming out with a benefit cut in 2041. Under Low Cost the need for that pay down almost vanishes, trillions and trillions of dollars we have mentally committed to Social Security simply moves to the other side of the ledger. In the Brave New World of Low Cost things are possible that we haven&#8217;t dared imagine.</p>
<p>Over to you.</p>
