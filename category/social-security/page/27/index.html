                                <p>Just a brief shot before going out the door.</p>
<p>In both the Obama and McCain camps there are separate but related discussion of &#8216;privatization&#8217; and charges that in particular McCain is lying, or that the people who claim that Bush never supported &#8216;privatization&#8217; are lunatics. But I fear that a rhetorical trap is being laid that we need to watch out for. Because it all goes to the precise definition of &#8216;privatization&#8217;.</p>
<p>You can argue that even a system of personal accounts whose investment choices are totally controlled by the end beneficiary is not &#8216;privatization&#8217; as long as those accounts remain under governmental custodial control, and particularly if the government also limits your ability to withdraw your funds at will. That is you can design a plan that guts Social Security&#8217;s current intra-generational insurance model as well as eliminating all progressivity in the benefits schedule and with a straight face claim you have not &#8216;privatized&#8217; it, even though the net result is equivalent to simply abolishing the program outright.</p>
<p>I issue this warning because I see signs in both the MSM and the comment threads that this is the impending talking point and we don&#8217;t want another &#8216;withering on the vine&#8217; moment.</p>
<p>For those who don&#8217;t remember Gingrich proposed some Medicare changes that ultimately would have gutted it. He unwittingly revealed as much by using the phrase &#8216;withering on the vine&#8217; to describe the process. When called on this he made the ridiculous claim that he wasn&#8217;t talking about Medicare but just about HCFA, the agency that administers it. This doesn&#8217;t make sense, as long as you have Medicare, somebody will be having to pay the bills, if not HCFA who? But not only did he get away with it, he turned around and claimed that Democrats were deliberately distorting his position. And the MSM lapped it up.</p>
<p>The way the gutting worked was that Gingrich deliberately confused &#8216;nominal&#8217; and &#8216;real&#8217; and blurred the difference between &#8216;dollars&#8217; and &#8216;cost&#8217;. He claimed that because under his proposal nominal dollars going to Medicare would still be increasing, it was a deliberate lie to suggest that he was &#8216;cutting Medicare&#8217;. Now anyone who stopped to think about what this means in a context of an increased pool of eligible beneficiaries and a pace of medical inflation well in advance of core inflation would realize that nominal dollar increases could still result in service cuts per beneficiary and so a degraded system (which could then be depicted as proof of Big Government is the problem). Describing this plan as &#8216;cuts&#8217; was perfectly fair. But apparently nobody stopped to think and ultimately Newt was able to transform the whole thing into a campaign talking point on the lines of &#8216;Democrats are lying about my Medicare proposal&#8217;.</p>
<p>Well that is what happens when you allow the opposition to define what &#8216;privatization&#8217; means or what &#8216;cuts&#8217; mean. Don&#8217;t let them sell the message that in this context there is no overlap between &#8216;private&#8217; and &#8216;personal&#8217;. Because while the concepts are not in fact identical, in the context of Social Security it is a distinction without a difference.</p>

                                <p>Well I want to get back to some of the basics. Much of the confusion around Social Security, and this is true as much for supporters as opponents, is a failure to understand what the Trust Fund actually is. This failure has led to such myths as &#8216;The Great Raids of Johnson/Reagan/etc&#8217;, the idea that something nefarious was going on, as well as the counterpart myth &#8216;Pre-funding&#8217;. This post aims to get people to see that Trust Fund in a new way and show that there really is nothing to see here, this accident scene turns out not to be an accident and in historical and numeric context not much of a scene to start with.</p>
<p>First and most important concept: the Trust Fund is not an investment fund, it is instead a reserve account maintained by the Treasury Department. In design and through much of its history it simply served as a buffer to protect retirees benefit checks from temporary fluctuations in revenue through such things as spikes in unemployment.</p>
<p>Second: while the Trust Fund balances are reported in total dollars ($2.2 trillion today) that is not really the best way to measure it, between inflation, changes in real wage, and increases in population it makes no sense to compare the balance today as opposed to fifteen years ago. Instead on a year to year basis the SSA examines the cost/income ratio and its trend. On a longer term basis it relies on the Trust Fund Ratio. The TF Ratio is the current balance expressed as a function of time where 100=1 year.</p>
<p>Third: before examine the numbers I want to introduce two concepts, that of Short Term Actuarial Balance and of Long Term Actuarial Balance. Short Term in Social Security terms means 10 years. If the projected Trust Fund Ratios are projected to be at or over 100 then Social Security is judged to be in Short Term Actuarial Balance, if not then the Trustees are supposed to urge Congress to do something about it, to that degree the ten year forecast is the official measure of &#8216;Crisis&#8217;. But the Trustees also keep an eye on Long Term Actuarial Balance which is the same test over 75 years. And now to the numbers:<br /><a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/VI_cyoper_history.html#159726">Table VI.A4.—Historical Operations of the Combined OASI and DI Trust Funds,Calendar Years 1957-2007 [Amounts in billions]</a><br />Discussion under the fold.</p>
<p>The three columns to pay attention to are the three far right ones under the heading assets. The first of the three measures cash flow to or from the bottom line in any given year, the second shows the resulting cumulative total, the third shows that total in terms of Trust Fund Ratio. If we examine the years from 1957 to 1965 we see a real Pay/Go system, with some years showing small surpluses while other years showing somewhat higher deficits with a result in cash terms of a roughly steady state balance. But if we examine the last column the picture darkens somewhat, we have a TF ratio that drops from a more than comfortable 298 in 1957 to 110 in 1965. Given that the official target is Short Term Actuarial Balance and a TF Ratio of 100, not a call for action but something to keep an eye on.</p>
<p>Now if we examine the period from 1966 to 1969 and so including the last months of the Johnson Administration we see a system in almost perfect balance, in all four years the system ran small but fairly consistent surpluses leading to a modest increase in total Trust Fund balance from $22-32 billion, but it is the last column that really tells the tale, the TF Ratio stays right around the level of Actuarial Balance with a low of 95 to a final of 103.</p>
<p>So time to bust Myth #1, that Johnson raided the Trust Fund to pay for Vietnam or the Great Society programs and created the Unified Budget to cover his tracks. Well sorry the actual numbers simply don&#8217;t support that, the $14 billion dollars added to the Trust Fund balance between the end of 1965 and the end of 1969 (with $5 billion of that coming in the last year and so mostly under Nixon&#8217;s first nine months) was much bigger money then than today, but it wasn&#8217;t enough to pay for the War nor for AFDC either. Instead Johnson and Congress did exactly what the law called for them to do, ensure that Social Security had a line of credit equal to around one year of expenses.</p>
<p>Line of Credit? What the hell, aren&#8217;t those assets Real as Real? If not why call them assets? Well the answer is to step back and think of the whole idea of dollar denominated assets. In the end the dollars you have in a bank account are in reality just a legal claim against the bank. If the dollars are in a savings account the bank will credit that account with a modest amount of interest, if the dollars are in a more volatile checking account (and so not as available in principle for the bank to lend) the bank may charge fees from small to extortionate, but really you don&#8217;t have any physical dollars in any of those accounts, just the right to exchange a portion of that balance for cash or services.</p>
<p>So in real world terms the Trust Fund balance is just a legal claim on the Treasury in exactly the same way as a savings account is a legal claim against the Bank, each in the end quaranteed by the Federal Government, in the case of the Trust Funds directly, in the case of the bank through various types of federal insurance. So why do we also track those balances in the form of Special Treasuries? Why not make the claim explicit and direct? Well I expect that the answer is partly Constitutional and partly just one of convenience. In Article 1 Section 9 (Limits on Congress) we are told: &#8220;No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law; and a regular Statement and Account of the Receipts and Expenditures of all public Money shall be published from time to time.&#8221; On the other hand the Treasury has the routine and regular authority to borrow money and issue debt instruments. Rather than entangle Social Security and Medicare in the Appropriations process, the Special Treasuries offer a convenient way to recast the whole thing as a series of borrowing and repayment.</p>
<p>Okay back to the numbers. Having introduced the concept that the Trust Fund is simply a reserve account to buffer short term variations in revenue, and that holding it in Special Treasuries is just a matter of convenience, what do the numbers show from 1970 to 1980, that is from Nixon to the election of Reagan? Well it sure as hell wasn&#8217;t a raid on the Trust Fund, instead surpluses dropped sharply and went to deficits in 1975, with the result that over this period the TF balance went from $38 billion to $27 billion even as annual cost went from $39 billion to $119 billion. And the arithmetic result in the TF ratio is stark, from 103 in 1970 to 25 in 1980. That is when Reagan took office the SSA had only three months of excess claims on Treasury in case of a revenue dip that sent Income below Cost. Now that is a system in crisis.</p>
<p>So time to bust myths 2 and 3. Because while you can indict Nixon, Ford, and Carter for letting the system decay, they did in fact honor the Trust Fund right down to the last, those Special Treasuries were paid off with General Fund transfers, they did in fact keep the checks flowing. So much for myth 2. As for myth 3, the Reagan raid on Social Security to pay for the Defense buildup. Nonsense. If fact laugh out loud nonsense. He was handed a lemonade and despite all entreaties from ideological opponents of Social Security did not let the system go to default, instead between him, the Commission, and Congress they implemented an interim patch designed to put the Trust Fund back on a path to Short Term Actuarial Balance, a task that was accomplished right in time to hand the system over to Clinton. Plus if you go back and actually look at the cash surpluses from 1982 to 1986 and so for most of Reagan&#8217;s remaining time in office you see a balance going only from $24 to $46 billion with half of that in the form of interest. Which left Reagan the opportunity to &#8216;loot&#8217; Social Security over that five year period of $11 billion or a $2.2 billion a year. Needless to say that was little more than a rounding error is then current defense budgets, the notion that Social Security funded a fleet of supercarriers vanishes into thin air.</p>
<p>If you look at the numbers.</p>
<p>One last myth, that of prefunding. When you think about Social Security in terms of a reserve fund whose measure of adequacy is a TF ratio of 100, you have to conclude that in any year that ratio remains below 100 you have not pre-funded anything, if anything your account is in arrears. So it is not true that Boomers started pre-paying for their retirement in 1984, instead they were simply maintaining Pay/Go while slowly building the Reserve, aka Trust Fund back to 100, a goal that was reached by 1993. It is true that a period of strong growth in the economy after that served to drastically improve actuarial balance, but even now the TF ratio is only at 341 and only projected to rise modestly over the next four years and then to decline after that. In real terms Boomers have only prefunded the next 3 years and 5 months, or more precisely 2 years and 5 months once you subtract out the mandated 1 year reserve,</p>
<p>Conclusion. The Trust Fund should not be seen as an investment fund because functionally that has not how it has operated historically and that is not how it is expected to operate projected forward. Under Intermediate Cost projections this period of strong surpluses is going to be temporary and talk about reallocating assets doesn&#8217;t make sense. (Different story under Low Cost but opponents of Social Security have to date not been willing to go there). In any event the history of Social Security from 1957 to at least 1993 can be summarized &#8220;Promises made, promises kept&#8221;. There simply was no dirty work done by anyone, not LBJ not Reagan not any of them. But the myths die hard on both the Left and the Right.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>I have said a number of times in posts and comments here that the numbers on Social Security are all extremely important, because paradoxically little of the debate about &#8216;crisis&#8217; is number driven at all. Instead I want to argue that it is fundamentally an attempt to tell a story to sell a particular set of policy proposals, that of &#8216;private&#8217; or &#8216;personal&#8217; (the terms overlap but are not synonomous) retirement accounts to ultimately replace Social Security.</p>
<p>In this case we have a number of top level &#8216;crisis&#8217; narratives with any number of sub-stories. But first we have to develop the characters who fall into five demographic cohorts. (The limiting birth dates for each may not line up precisely with those used by demographers, but my argument is only to a limited degree demographic to start with). So we have the Greatest Generation with birthdates from 1910 to 1928, the Depression/War Babies 1929 to 1945, the Baby Boomers, 1946 to 1964, Gen-X from 1965 to 1983, and the Millennials from 1984 to 2001. In our first story who is the villain and who the victim?</p>
<p>Well the villain is pretty clear, it is the Baby Boomers whose pending retirements are simply going to wreck the system (so the story goes).  The notion that Boomers are inherently selfish was not invented by privatizers, instead they latched onto a theme that had been developing since about 1964 when the first Boomers arrived on college campuses. Immediately and at an accelerating pace Boomers were swept up in a massive series of societal changes that in toto put paid to the middle class consensus as it had developed in the fifties. For the next twenty two years it was going to be our music, our fashion, our sensibility that would rule the day. Now certainly those sensiblities changed as we moved from tie dye and acid to cocaine and hot tubs in the seventies, but the overall message stayed the same: &#8216;Don&#8217;t trust anyone over 30&#8217; (until of course we started turning 30 in 1976). Did we deserve being called self-absorbed, I daresay we did. But did we deserve the label of &#8216;selfish&#8217;. Well not in the event. Because things didn&#8217;t and are not turning out as planned.</p>
<p>There are two top level narratives about Social Security &#8216;crisis&#8217;. One is &#8216;Crisis at Trust Fund Depletion&#8217;. The other is &#8216;Crisis at Social Security Shortfall&#8217;. Analysis and discussion under the fold.</p>
<p>The more traditional model of &#8216;crisis&#8217; is placed at Trust Fund Depletion which is to say that date at which the Treasury Department has fulfilled all its legal obligation to redeem Trust Fund security instruments. And that is an important point, privatizers like to talk about &#8216;Unfunded liability&#8217; over the Long Term 75 year window and now over the Infinite Horizon, and to be fair the Trustees also use it as a term of art. But to my best understanding it is not at all a &#8216;liability&#8217; in the legal sense. When and if first Pay/Go fails us requiring us to tap the interest and then that fails to keep up requiring us to repay principal well when we come to the end of the road that is where it stops. At that point Social Security is legally on its own to pay whatever it can out of current tax income. Now it may be that society as a whole will feel a social obligation to backfill benefits, and there may be political pressure to do so, and people may or may not be confident we can pick up the subsequent bill, but none of those are absolute obligations. Which leads us to our first three narratives: Crisis of the Naive, Crisis of the Concerned, and Crisis of the Cynical.</p>
<p>Crisis of the Naive. Certain advocates of privatization from the President on down have used reckless language like &#8216;bankrupt&#8217; and &#8216;flat broke&#8217; to describe Social Security after Depletion with the result that large numbers of Americans who still to this point probably command majorities have translated to &#8216;no check&#8217; and &#8216;Social Security won&#8217;t be there for me&#8217;. This is off course nonsense, as long as there exists a FICA payroll tax benefit checks can continue to be paid to some level, these people simply haven&#8217;t been given the conceptual tools to think this through, and privatizers are not exactly rushing to clear this fundamental issue up. So we can leave the Naive behind.</p>
<p>Crisis of the Concerned. These people probably understand the above point, but believe the needed cuts will be too deep and that we will have a moral requirement to make the scheduled benefit. Well color me unconvinced. The current schedule would deliver a benefit in 2041 that is 160% in real terms relative to ones similarly situated retirees get today. This is because initial benefits adjust to real wages and the fact is that taken as a whole this country has gotten wealthier over time. Will this process always continue? Well maybe not but right now the official line is that in 2041 the system will deliver 78% of the scheduled benefit, and given that 78% of 160% = 125% it is far from clear to me that this is necessarily a call to action. Particularly since most proposed &#8216;fixes&#8217; just phase those cuts in earlier and don&#8217;t materially advance the economic interest of the typical retiree at mid-century. Feel free to argue in comments why I should take benefit cuts from 2023 to 2041 that end up delivering the same result as taking full benefits and having a one time reset (past efforts at telling this story have not been at all convincing, but give it a shot.</p>
<p>Crisis of the Cynical. These people are just blowing smoke. They make the argument that our villainous Selfish Boomers will look at that 125% check and demand the full 160% be continued no matter what and enforce that demand with their superior numbers with the battle cry &#8216;Screw everyone else! I want mine! And I want it now!!&#8217;, and then the Cynics follow up on that by claiming the result would ruin the country. Well this just ignores the historical record. It was the Greatest Generation and the War Babies that allowed the Trust Fund to drop below 100 in 1971 and then go to zero levels in 1983. Boomers might at that point have been ruling the streets and most of the campuses but many of us were not even old enough to meet age requirements for Congress. We didn&#8217;t screw the pooch on this one, that would be the two cohorts before us. And when the time came we stepped up to the plate. By 1984 almost all Boomers were in the workforce and those who had followed the election knew the 1983 Reform was at best a partial fix, for us at least. But we did fix it for our parents lifetime. We may not have listened to them when we were growing up, but neither did we send them out to sea on an ice floe, no we paid in extra for most of our working lives with no guarantee we would get full benefits out. To call us &#8216;selfish&#8217; is kind of to miss the mark. Nor in the years since have I seen any real evidence that Boomers simply don&#8217;t give a shit about our children and grand children, yeah it is a good story line to sell to resentful Gen-Xers who think to themselves &#8216;My Uncle got to go to Woodstock and all I got was a T-Shirt with &#8216;Just say No&#8217; on the front and &#8216;Abstinence Only&#8217; on the back&#8217;, but it all rests on a misconception of what Social Security is actually promising. They still look to get a pretty good deal, it just might not be as great as planned (but still may-Low Cost is out there).</p>
<p>Two more points on the Cynical. The original narrative of circa 1997 worked out a lot better. At that point Trust Fund Depletion was scheduled for 2029 and indeed the outlook had been darkening. And this would have left Boomers ranging from 65 to 83, not only in our prime voting years but according to the mortality tables still likely to be around. To that degree the sub-story that had us storming Capitol Hill at least made some sense. Fast forward to 2008, now our ages at Depletion in 2041 would be 77 to 95 and the mortality tables suggest that time would not be on our side. The people likely to be in a position to raise a ruckus are going to be those same resentful Gen-Xers, the Boomers will have paid their own freight on this one.</p>
<p>Last point on the Cynical. As noted nothing requires us to backfill that 78% to 100% of the schedule, but pretending it would be a huge burden ignores the fact that the cost of paying off the last installment of Trust Fund obligations in 2040 and early 2041 is almost exactly that of continuing to fund it out of straight General Fund transfers. In either case the gap remains the same. If we do decide to backfill it we just keep borrowing at the rates we had done since about 2035, if we decide not to backfill it and take the 125% the result is a large (but not huge tax cut). Taken from the standpoint of the typical income taxpayer, crisis at depletion actually is the functional equivalent of paying off an amortized mortgage, a large annual obligation simply vanishes off the books.</p>
<p>So that is Crisis at Depletion, on examination it just melts away. Which is why privatizers in recent years pivoted to Crisis at Shortfall.</p>
<p>Crisis at Shortfall equally falls into multiple parts. The basic story is that the key point is not when the Trust Fund exhausts its legal claims on the General Fund, but when the General Fund has to start paying interest (2017) and then principal (2023) but it splits after that. One camp simply tries to tell the &#8216;phony IOU&#8217; story, and pushed pseudo-legal arguments that the government can&#8217;t owe debt to itself and the fact that the Special Treasuries being not negotiable makes some sort of difference. Well neither is true though people can take their best story telling shots in comments. Because when I talk with some of the top privatizers they freely admit the claims are valid and that they have never said otherwise. (Though I don&#8217;t see a lot of active effort to shut the bogus argument lines down.) Instead the more sophisticated Crisis at Shortfall people simply argue that however valid those obligations may be, actually honoring them in practice would require large tax increases and slashes in other government programs. Well nice appeal to liberal guilt there, but in point of fact the initial transfers are very small and don&#8217;t ramp up until sometime after 2027, which is plenty of time to start a planning process. The notion that we need to take action NOW! is a simple fairy tale told by some clever story tellers. Put the numbers in actual context and the narratives of crisis simply dissolve into fairy dust.</p>

The ability these guys have a slipping back and forth from nominal to real is never ending.</p>

<p>I am only a few pages into the 82 page Report but my initial response is that this is a very important deal. These people do seem to be actual independent observers fully willing to call them as the see them and  seem to have identified a lot of the weaknesses in methodology that we here at AB see (for example that Low Cost has all variables moving in the same direction). Arne might be particularly interested in that they are proposing a duplication of something he is working on, which is to say a combination of Low Cost economic assumptions with Intermediate Cost demographics, I am sure he will want to compare notes.</p>
<p>I am going to take my own advice and actually read the thing before commenting, but I suspect this will be required reading for any serious commentary. BTW this Report only comes around every four years, and it looks like a substantial departure from the 2003. My reaction will come in comments a little later or tomorrow.</p>

                                <p>by Bruce Webb</p>
<p>Andrew Biggs at his site Notes on Social Security Reform spotted and copied a remarkable article from the WSJ under the title <a href="http://andrewgbiggs.blogspot.com/2008/06/wsj-obama-social-security-plan-draws.html">Obama&#8217;s Social Security Plan Draws Critics, Even Dems</a>. Why remarkable? Because the people quoted actually seem to know what they are talking about, rather unusual for a MSM publication. Rather than copy it I urge people to pop over and if you like leave a comment with Andrew (who really needs more traffic and more critical comments).</p>
<p>Along with a general discussion of the reason the payroll cap exists to start with they throw out some numbers. One is that the 1983 Commission targeted 90% of wage income but that over time that amount had slipped to 84%. Indeed the LMS plan&#8217;s payroll cap increase explicitly targets that 90%. Which raises the question of why 90% and not 95% or 85%? Why in the face of an overall system imbalance does it fall only on wage earners in the narrow band between 84% and 90% pick up the whole tab, particularly when you note this only applies to wages and not capital. Either Retirement Security is a societal imperative, in which case capital should have a say, but also a bill, or it really is worker funded insurance and that certain higher (but not highest) have the unique responsibility for bailing it out, and under some plans don&#8217;t actually get any more out. Conceptually does this make sense?</p>
<p>Another number not mentioned explicitly is 78% which is to say the level of benefits projected to be paid out in 2042 under Intermediate Cost projections. Why given Rosser&#8217;s 78% of 160%= 125% when we look at this from the standpoint of real benefits what makes this a crisis? And one which I have to pay for but which leaves hedge fund managers off the hook?</p>
<p>Also raised is the idea of putting in a donut hole of between $102,000 &#038; $250,000 and only taxing wages above that level. Which just turns the first question on its head. Here instead of putting it all on the 84% to 90% people, they get leap frogged and people up stream get popped. Why? And again why not put some of the burden on the capital side?</p>
<p>I believe a cap increase is a bad idea for reasons discussed in this article, the existing cap provides a measure of political protection for the overal program. But if we have to increase it in ways that move Social Security from insurance to a transfer program why would we simply target these various narrow slices of wage workers to do it? I expanded on this last point in my comment at Biggs. That comment is duplicated under the fold.</p>
<p>(To Andy Biggs) A good article particularly when compared to most of what is published. But it largely left out the point that there is no incidence of FICA on income from capital gains and that there is a big difference between a 90% level of wages and a 90% level of income. If we have to move Social Security farther in the direction of a transfer program it is difficult to see why we would give the truly wealthy a free pass or limit the obligation to wage earners up to but not beyond 90%. Either it is worker paid insurance or it is a societal obligation to be shared by all. Insisting that a relatively narrow band of upper middle class wage earners pick up the entire tab is rather odd.</p>
<p>Because Hillary&#8217;s point was a little off. Since Social Security applies to individual rather than household income a cap increase will not hit much of the public sector at all, beyond some University Presidents and Football coaches and maybe a Police Commissioner here or there few public servants are dragging down significant amounts over the current cap. But what a cap increase is is a direct assault on the professional and managerial classes each of which is in position where they could likely manage or bargain for a change in the composition of their compensation packages to make more of it look like returns on capital rather than wages.</p>
<p>Center-right economists argue that people will react strongly even to small changes in top marginal rates. A cap increase would be a huge increase in top rates of either 6.2% or 12.4% (depending on where you fall down on where the incidence of the employer match really falls). From what I can see the best title for such a bill would be the Compensation Consultant and Tax Lawyer Relief Bill of 2009, because some of people are going to make out like bandits on this one, a group that maybe doesn&#8217;t include the Trustees. The proposal seems to ignore the idea of tax planning altogether. (I don&#8217;t believe in tax avoidance per se, which doesn&#8217;t mean I would consider setting up a partnership or corporation in a way that minimized my burden to necessarily rise to that level.) </p>
<p>(And it should be mentioned that the short term impact of a cap increase is potentially negative by swelling the interest owed on an even bigger Trust Fund. You have to be pretty naive to believe that Washington had the discipline to use these new dollars dollar for dollar to lower other borrowing, which would be the only way to offset this new interest obligation for future taxpayers.)</p>

                                <p>Well this is even less of an economics post than XV and in thinking on this the last couple days I realized I didn&#8217;t have a firm enough grip on the historical particulars to make it as definitive as I wanted. But still the concept is important and I could use some feedback so here goes.</p>
<p>When we talk about a Reactionary today we generally mean nothing more than &#8216;very Conservative&#8217;. But the term has a specific historical reference, it describes those who lined up behind the forces of Reaction in the years on either side of the nineteenth century. This Reaction was to specific events, notably the American and French Revolutions which were perceived, and rightly, as being systemic risks to the political, economic, and religious structure of society as it existed, not just to crowned monarchs (though Louis XVI showed that had to be taken into consideration), but to the aristocracy, the merchant and industrial class, and to the landowners. The key point to understand is that for the original Reactionaries &#8216;Democracy&#8217; was quite literally a dirty word, it was considered and called &#8216;Mob Rule&#8217;. Then further consider that the forces of Reaction did not at all believe that &#8216;All Men are Created Equal&#8217; and rejected all three parts of the French slogan &#8216;Liberte, Egalite, Fraternite&#8217;, at least as they pertained to the working class in relation to them. These Revolutions unleashed forces that put the whole concept of Privilege and Birth at risk, because once you start leveling things who knows where the stopping point is.</p>
<p>Which leads to the second point. In  nineteenth century  it was nearly impossible to draw any kind of clear lines between the drives for universal franchise, for the right to organize and bargain collectively, and for socialism. Indeed when the British Labour Party came into being at the end of the century it was organized specifically on all three lines.</p>
<p>Which leads to two questions. One was the classical economics stemming from Adam Smith shaped by the fact that its practitioners by and large lived in a society where exclusive privilege was a societal norm and where democracy was seen as an existential threat to that society? Two can the continued hostility to Social Security be explained as a simple continuation of a politics and an economics formed within a framework of Reaction?</p>
<p>Personally I think the answer to both questions is &#8216;Yes&#8217;. Orthodox economists tend to look at the world through the lens of a discipline formed in days when democracy and hence pragmatic greatest good solutions could not be distinguished from socialism and class warfare. If we accept this frame much of the mystery behind the denials of income inequality, resistance to minimum wage, denial that wages are set by power relations to begin with, and yes opposition to Social Security all can be explained as stemming from the same source, that of Reaction pushing back on perceived Socialism.</p>

                                <p>Properly speaking this is not an economics post. So most of it is below the fold.</p>
<p>I started a Social Security blog in Nov. 2004 in the wake of Bush&#8217;s announcement that he would expend his new political capital on Social Security &#8216;reform&#8217;. At that point in time I had been looking at these numbers for about seven years and had largely formed the conclusions I have been laying out in this series. In blunt terms I knew that &#8216;crisis&#8217; was in context bullshit, and I also knew along side Dean Baker that this was &#8220;well known to those who have looked at the numbers&#8221;. So this post is an attempt to answer two questions: one, &#8216;why do they persist anyway?&#8217; and two, a question I posed in one of my first posts &#8216;Who the hell am I to be lecturing economists on Social Security?&#8217; </p>
<p>As most readers know I am not an economist, I never took even an Intro course in Economics and the closest I got to the tools of the trade was Statistics 20, Introduction to Statistics for Non-Majors, and that 33 years ago. So who am I to take this subject on? Well the answer is that Social Security &#8216;crisis&#8217; is not at bottom an economic question to start with. Certainly all of the surface action suggests that the issue is retirement security and that the question revolves around whether or not that will be economically sustainable at some future point. But having poked around in the numbers for years I knew that really wasn&#8217;t the core issue, the results under Intermediate Cost were certainly acceptable, while results closer to Low Cost were at least plausible. Which raised the question &#8216;Why do they care?&#8217;. After all these people have no problem cutting heating oil subsidies for today&#8217;s seniors, with requiring kids to remain uninsured for a full year before they can transfer from a private plan to a new government alternative. Many of the same people who want to privatize Social Security to &#8216;save&#8217; it simultaneously advocate for abolishing the Department of Education. These are the farthest thing from bleeding heart liberals, yet they profess to be deeply concerned about retirement security for future generations, aye verily even unto the Infinite Future Horizon. But why? And just as importantly &#8216;Why now?&#8217;</p>
<p>Well I explored the question in a July 2005 post <a href="http://bruceweb.blogspot.com/2005/07/social-security-it-it-about-solvency.html">Social Security: is it about Solvency or about Ayn Rand?</a>. And the conclusion I came to was this:<br />
<blockquote>The numbers are important, if you are going to participate in the debate over the future of Social Security you need to understand them, you need to understand their implications, you need to be able to measure them against the numbers you read in the paper every day. Because oddly enough this debate is not about numbers and in most respects it never has been.</p></blockquote>
<p>The oppostion to Social Security has always been driven by the ideology, and that ideology can only be understood in historical perspective, and particularly in the millennia long struggle between the powerful and the people over the distribution of production. Which is where I come in, I was in fact a trained historian with a speciality in Medieval Europe but substantial side work in Classical Greece and Ancient Rome. And over the course of that study I learned a couple of fundamental truths, one the issues hadn&#8217;t changed much between the time of the Gracchi brothers (133 BC) and the Cato Institute of today, and two the historiography is almost always charged with the class struggle of the time. The modern study of Rome can hardly be separated from the economic ideology of those first historians. That is we see the Gracchi brothers and later Caesar through a historical lens fundamentally hostile to what were considered dangerous democratic and even socialistic impulses. It is worth noting the Cato the Censor, after whom the Cato Institute is named, was the sworn enemy of the Gracchi brothers&#8217; grandfather Scipio Africanus, and for same reasons, although Africanus like Caesar was the ultimate son of privilege, achieving all the highest offices, he dared to suggest that the interest of the people at large be considered.</p>
<p>Who knew that proposals for land distribution in 2nd century BC Rome or the history of the Statute of Laborers (1351) and successor acts in England would be relevant to the Social Security debate today? Well that is why we are here.</p>
<p>The powerful have always been alarmed and often to the point of physical violence at any scheme that remotely smacks of being redistribution and this impulse historically preceded by centuries the development of classical economic theory. If you examine the actual economic history that paralleled the development of the new theory you can clearly see that the former infused the latter, there is only one degree of separation between a nineteenth century liberal economist and a nineteenth century liberal manufacturer. When examined in the historical perspective of the centuries before and close to two centuries after you see an academic discipline shaped by the political class struggle of the day, although admittedly perhaps largely invisible to the actual theorists involved.</p>
<p>A successful Social Security system is a threat to the powerful in much the same way that the throughly aristocratic Gracchi brothers land distribution plans were. Because once you let the camel of &#8216;greatest good for greatest number&#8217; get its nose under the tent who knows where it will stop. Which of course was Hayek&#8217;s premise in Road to Serfdom, admit that government planning works in some cases, next thing you know you are in the gulag. (For those who think this too strong, try reading the authorized 18 panel cartoon version of <a href="http://www.mises.org/books/TRTS/">The Road to Serfdom</a> (hosted on Marek&#8217;s mothership mises.org).</p>
<p>The question of &#8216;Why now?&#8217; is itself explained by this 1998 article from our friends at Cato <a href="http://www.socialsecurity.org/pubs/ssps/ssp11es.html">The Myth of the 2.2% Solution</a>. On my reading they had simply panicked, people like Baker and well, Webb were pointing out some inconvenient numbers, which led the Cato folk to assert the following:<br />
<blockquote>The 2.2 percent figure assumes that the reform would take effect at the beginning of calendar year 1998. Thus it is already out of date. Each year Congress waits, the magnitude of the tax hike required to balance the Social Security trust funds rises.</p>
<p>The solution is not permanent. In fact, an additional tax hike would be required every year to keep the trust funds in balance over a full 75 years.</p>
<p>The 2.2 percent solution is based on the Social Security trustees’ &#8220;intermediate&#8221; projection. If we accept the trustees’ &#8220;high-cost&#8221; projection, whose key economic and demographic assumptions more closely reflect historical experience, the necessary tax hikes would be at least twice as large.</p>
<p>The 2.2 percent solution focuses only on the program’s solvency. But simply raising taxes (or cutting benefits), while it may balance the Social Security trust funds, does nothing to redress the program’s other underlying problems, most notably the declining rate of return for young workers.</p></blockquote>
<p> Only problem none of these are factually true. In fact in the years since the magnitude of the tax hike needed has gone down, the solution is permanent and requires no additonal tax hikes during the 75 year window, the high-cost projection doesn&#8217;t remotely reflect historical experience, and at best the declining rate of return is dubious, indeed the 78% of 160% = 125% equation suggests just the obvious.</p>
<p>In short they were and are panicking, the debate was slipping out of their control, and their only response was half-truths and lies to disquise their actual, ideological committment to the principles of Cato the Elder. Social Security is thus not an economic question at all, instead it is a case study in the centuries long struggle between democracy and reaction.</p>

                                <p>I know I promised to back off the pace but yesterday&#8217;s comment thread got temporarily derailed before the point could be made. In yesterday&#8217;s post I highlighted the cash flow in and out of the General Fund to redeem the Trust Fund <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/05/soc-sec-xiii-crisis-at-shortfall-or.html">&#8216;Crisis&#8217; at Shortfall</a> in an effort to show that in inflation adjusted dollars the payback was no big deal. Well wouldn&#8217;t benefit cuts or a cap increase make the problem even smaller? Well no, you just end up taking the problem out in time by a year or so and make the ultimate cost bigger. Take the numeric series from yesterday for Intermediate Cost or here today for Low Cost and apply the effects of either benefit cuts or tax increase. Once again the left column represents total surplus and so the increase in Trust Fund balance, while the right column represents current year cash flow to or from the General Fund (in constant 2008 dollars). Either a benefit cut or a tax increase will increase the dollars in both columns. A good thing? Well not really. Because the real dollars in the right column from either benefits not being paid in full or more revenue coming are just spent in the current year. If this actually reduced current year borrowing dollar for dollar it would be one thing, but there is no real world evidence that this actually happens. So boom that extra cash is spent. And the left column properly considered is actually an increase in interest earning debt. You are not doing your kids any favors by starving gramma, not if the result is extra payments in the form of future interest on an even bigger interim Trust Fund. The net effect is to move the date of Intermediate Cost shortfall out a bit, and depletion out maybe quite a bit all at the cost of larger needs for future General Fund transfers to pay for that compounding interest. So that is Intermediate Cost. What happens with Low Cost? Well first the numbers, discussion under the fold.</p>
<p>Low Cost Surpluses and Cash Flow to/from the General Fund<br />2010 $236, $106<br />2015 $267, $78<br />2020 $250, $8<br />2025 $217, -$68<br />2030 $170, -$122<br />2035 $169, -$160<br />2040 $205, -$143<br />2045 $273, -$104<br />2050 $358, -$66<br />2055 $455, -$40<br />2060 $567, $17<br />2065 $715, $18<br />2070 $801, $58</p>
<p>What is with the negative numbers? I thought Bruce was always telling us that Low Cost meant fully funded?</p>
<p>Well it does, if you use the Trustees&#8217; definitions of Income and Cost. For the Trustees, who as the name assume have to act as if the Trust Fund is real (after all they are the guardians), Income includes Interest. But if you step back and look at this in the total budget perspective you see that Interest is suddenly transformed from a source of Income to an open obligation on the General Fund. With the results you see above, starting in about 2023 a portion of the interest earned needs to be tapped to pay benefits. But whereas under IC this portion rapidly increases after 2017 and takes in all interest by 2023, under Low Cost the effect always remains partial. In the 2007 Report the result was a system in equilibrium, with approximately 25% of all cost being paid by transfers from the General Fund. Which raises our first problem, in last years Report this subsidy goes on forever, while the utility of the actual dollars borrowed fades as the decades go by. That is not really a good outcome. In the 2008 Report the effect is only worse. Because while the needed transfers grow until about 2035 (though never as high as IC) they start shrinking until in around 2056 the need vanishes completely as Income excluding Interest once again exceeds Cost.</p>
<p>Well the problem is that you now are stuck with a near useless $12 trillion Trust Fund merrily compounding away. But you can&#8217;t just abrogate it by explaining that almost all of it what just the effect of interest on interest and so in some sense disconnected from the real economy. Because the worker of 2056 is going to look at that string of negative numbers from 2023 to 2055 and likely think &#8216;Hell they were real enough when my income tax dollar was being tapped to pay some of that interest&#8217;. But redeeming the now useless Trust Fund to eliminate the future effects of those compound interest dollars requires lowering FICA taxes by enough to offset the total accrued interest plus some extra reductions in rates to allow some gradual paydown on principle. Which means you would have to boost your transfers from 2055&#8217;s $40 billion to at least $470 billion in 2056 simply to keep you in the same place financially. So instead of having to pick up 25% of the tab for a time limited span of 2017 to 2053, here you pay varying portions of the tab through 2055 ramping down to 1% and then get a sharp jump back to 25%, more if you want to take any serious crack at paying down the principle. In effect Low Cost either requires your grandkids simply to accept that they were taxed extra all those years, that now that we didn&#8217;t need the extra income they should just get over it. Or tell them yeah the money is real and we want $470 billion a year forever out of income tax. Just to add some spice to the soup the end result is that Low Income workers who pay little or no income tax get a huge tax cut. Because the only way to make the books balance is to cut FICA back dollar for dollar in relation to that General Fund transfer.</p>
<p>Put this in a matrix with lifetime Low, Medium and High Income Worker on one axis, and Entry age, Median age, and New retiree then start examining where the incidences hit. And who woulda thunk it, the people who get crushed are people earning around the payroll cap.</p>
<p>Okay in this scenario what is the effect of either a benefit cut or a cap increase? Well once again it keeps the numbers in both columns more positive for a longer period of time, that is instead of a negative number from 2023 to 2055 you get a smaller transfer for a shorter period of time. But all that means is an even bigger Trust Fund and more accrued interest at the point of crossover and so an even HIGHER need for General Fund transfers to keep the beast of Interest on Interest from eating you up.</p>
<p>In the cold light of day the &#8216;right&#8217; answer is to take it as you would if you found out that your insurance company made record profits because of lower than expected claims. As long as all your claims were honored, who cares? I&#8217;ll be 99 in 2056. But I have some nieces, nephews and great nieces who will be rapidly approaching retirement at that point. I don&#8217;t see how screwing over Great Gramma Alice and Great Uncle Bruce on their retirement bought them anything more than a huge political mess. That is why benefit cuts and cap increases backfire.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Social Security &#8216;crisis&#8217; is normally discussed in terms of Trust Fund Depletion. But given that this event has been pushed back to at least 2041 and boils down to a benefit in real terms 25% better than the one my Mom gets today (78% of 160% = 125%), and that some awareness of this leaked out during the &#8216;There is no crisis&#8217; campaign of 2005, opponents of Social Security had to retool and redefine crisis at Shortfall, which is to say the time that receipts from taxation fall behind Social Security cost and so require the General Fund to start paying back the money it borrowed. Since no serious argument can be made that the debt is not real, because after all they continue to borrow the current surplus presumedly in good faith, instead they pivot to &#8216;explain&#8217; that paying it back will put some intolerable strain on the overall budget and so require massive spending cuts or ruinous taxation increases. But as almost always they never actually put a price tag on this. So lets price Shortfall in inflation adjusted Constant Dollars. Source data here: <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/VI_OASDHI_dollars.html#140103">Table VI.F7.—Operations of the Combined OASI and DI Trust Funds, in Constant 2008 Dollars, Calendar Years 2008-85&#8243; [In billions]</a></p>
<p>Now generally when people talk about the Social Security surplus they include the accrued interest and talk about the General Fund borrowing $200 billion a year. And viewed from the standpoint of legacy debt this is fair enough, they are assuming future obligations for that amount. But that interest is not in fact financed, the only real cash extracted from the economy and so the only real dollars that can be used to pay for real current spending are the actual excess tax dollars over current costs.  Lots and lots of nummy numbers below the fold.</p>
<p>Between 2008 and 2017 the system is projected to run surpluses, but how much of that is actually cash? In this case the first column represents total surplus, the second cash flow (all under Intermediate Cost assumptions, dollars in billions)<br />2008 $196  $79 <br />2009 $208  $86<br />2010 $214  $84<br />2011 $216  $76<br />2012 $214  $66<br />2013 $209  $52<br />2014 $200  $35<br />2015 $190  $18<br />2016 $180  $2<br />2017 $164  -$19 {oops, had to edit from -$21, which is the net change from 2016 and not the actual transfer for 2017}<br />In light of this we can see how misplaced the hysteria really is. These are not particularly big dollars to start with and over the next ten years the General Fund will be gently weaned off what is in context a pretty meager flow, the idea that a transition from a $2 billion cash surplus in 2016 to a $19 billion dollar cash deficit in 2017 roiling the world credit markets or demanding huge slashes in spending or ruinous tax increase is in numeric context simple nonsense, particularly as here if you adjust the numbers for inflation. But doesn&#8217;t it just get worse going forwards? Well lets see. At this point the table shifts to five year periods meaning we have to interpolate for 2023, the date the total surplus is being tapped and principal has to be repaid. These figures represent total transfers from the General Fund, once again adjusted for inflation. {Oops had to edit, got 2017 and 2023 mixed up the first time around}.</p>
<p>2017    $19<br />2020    $77<br />2023  ~$150<br />2025    $172<br />2030    $258<br />2035    $313<br />2040    $335<br />2042    $0</p>
<p>In short financing Social Security through 2041 means deficits in real terms less than the typical ones run by this Bush Administration and in context much smaller than those run in Reagan/Bush I days. If we exercise even a little restraint on the General Fund side this gap is easily digestible, especially if we note that it is in principle temporary, there is no positive legal obligation for the General Fund to backfill any income/cost gap after 2041. Once you put the numbers in context any real content to &#8216;crisis&#8217; simply melts away. Which is why privatizers never put the numbers in context.</p>

That is we are not talking about three random academics writing some paper, instead these are policy players working at the highest levels, no matter who wins this fall one or more of them will be sitting at the table when Social Security policy is hammered out. So LMS matters. A lot.</p>
<p>But first lets define some terms and lay out some baseline numbers. Social Security &#8216;crisis&#8217; is normally associated with Trust Fund Depletion which is currently projected for 2041. Although people tend to refer to this event with reckless language like &#8216;broke&#8217;, &#8216;bankrupt&#8217; or &#8216;dead broke&#8217; which leads others to conclusions that &#8216;Social Security will not be there for me&#8217; or &#8216;no check&#8217;, ten seconds of informed thought tells us this is nonsense. As long at the payroll tax exists some level of benefits can be paid out and the Trustees tell us each year what that level is. With the 2008 Report the Trustees tell us that under Intermediate Cost assumptions that the benefit check will be cut sometime in 2041 to 78% of the scheduled benefit. Now given that the scheduled benefit would be 160% in real terms relative to the one a similarly situated retiree gets today and that 78% of 160% = 125% or a check 25% better in real terms than the one my Mom gets today some might question the whole notion of &#8216;crisis&#8217;. A topic that can be discussed in comments. But for now lets run with the number.</p>
<p>Okay so &#8216;crisis&#8217; is defined as 78%. What would a &#8216;fix&#8217; be. Well I am going to keep running with the Trustees here, they would define this is terms of Short Term and Long Term Actuarial Balance, meaning Social Security projected to end each year of the next ten or alternatively seventy-five years with a one year reserve. Which translates to 100% of the schedule. Moreover they tell us exactly what the cost of that fix would be if we chose to take a tax only approach. Per the 2008 Report that fix would require an immediate increase in the payroll tax of 1.7% which would take the FICA rate to 14.1%. We should note that when LMS was drafted the gap was 1.92%.</p>
<p>So now to LMS and Table 1 above, especially columns two and four where you have both halves of a couple surviving. One thing strikes you right away, LMS doesn&#8217;t actually promise you a fix as defined particularly for low earners, it only partially fills the gap. While some might be tempted to say &#8216;better something than nothing&#8217;, the devil is always in the details. A cost/benefit analysis of LMS lies below the fold.</p>
<p>Which takes us to Table 2 which scores the impact of LMS on the Trust Fund but which doesn&#8217;t tell the whole story. LMS at its core relies on PRAs (Personal Retirement Accounts) which are essentially government run IRAs that are considered to be outside the Trust Fund itself. If we take the totality of LMS what are the tax and benefit implications?</p>
<p>First LMS proposes a 1.5% across the board increase in payroll tax all of which gets put into the PRA. Additionally it proposes a partial lifting of the payroll cap for an additional 1.0% payroll equivalent. Which is to say that it proposes a 2.5% tax solution to a problem that had been scored at 1.92% and now is down to 1.7%. Given that we could achieve a &#8216;fix&#8217; as defined above for less than LMS it is clear that for the authors their &#8216;Reform&#8217; does not equate to our &#8216;fix&#8217;. But it gets even more interesting on the benefit side.</p>
<p>Along with the 2.5% total increase in payroll tax LMS also proposes a cut in the benefit from traditional Social Security benefit formula of 2.08% along with an increase in retirement age for an additional .68% for a total benefit cut of 2.7% once again much more than what we have described as &#8216;crisis&#8217; to begin with. So what we have is a tax increase that would more than &#8216;fix&#8217; &#8216;crisis&#8217; as we have defined these terms along with benefit cuts that would fix &#8216;crisis&#8217; in place. Which puts in place the dual questions &#8216;What does LMS actually accomplish?&#8217; and &#8216;Why should wage workers fund it to the equivalent of 5.2% of payroll (2.5% in taxes and 2.7% in cuts)?&#8217;</p>
<p>At this point serious students might want to follow the link and read the plan which is only nine pages. The first six and a half pages contain the pain. The putative gains start on page seven.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sustainable solvency is achieved&#8217;. The net result from LMS would be to put Social Security into a .22% payroll surplus when examined from the Social Security and hence General Fund side of the equation. That this comes at a cost of 5.2% total to workers when they could get a better outcome at 1.92% (then) or 1.7% (now) is apparently just the burden we owe to future generations. Because on examination it is clear that the authors of LMS have a quite different definition of &#8216;solvency&#8217; than say Coberly or I do. We like the fact that Social Security is a PayGo insurance plan with an intergenerational bargain of &#8216;you paid for my parents, I&#8217;ll pay for you, your kids can pay for me, and all with better real results as time goes on&#8217;. For the authors this situation is intolerable. Why? Well a fine topic for discussion in comments.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fiscally responsible plan&#8221; Here I think the authors let the cat out of the bag, note how they word the issue (bolding mine):<br />
<blockquote>The plan puts great emphasis on fiscal responsibility – borrowing less from general revenues than any other plan that has been scored by the Social Security actuaries in recent years.  Table 3 compares the LMS plan with other recent Social Security reform plan.  The first column compares general fund transfers to the OASDI Trust Funds.  This is one measure of how much a plan relies upon unspecified resources from outside of Social Security to bring the system into balance.  The LMS plan does not rely at all on general fund transfers, and instead uses changes to <br />benefits and revenues to bring Social Security into balance.</p></blockquote>
<p>. This is rather odd. Under current law there is no question of Social Security borrowing anything from the General Fund, the obligation is the other direction in the form of repaying the money borrowed from current Social Security surpluses. The LMS formulation builds in a tricky duality. First it asserts that the unfunded liability beyond 2041 is real enough that the government would fill compelled to backfill it with &#8216;borrowing, then it writes it off anyway by proposing even bigger cuts sooner. To me that seems special pleading.</p>
<p>&#8220;Many practical reforms are included&#8221;. All these reforms relate to administration of the plan and none actually to the issue of retirement security itself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Economically beneficial&#8221; On my reading of the text on page nine this translates to &#8216;exercising fiscal restraint on Congress&#8217;, a good idea in itself but one that is difficult to justify by placing the entire cost on wage workers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Balanced compromise&#8221;. I am not sure how a 5.2% bill for a problem scored at 1.92% is either balanced or any kind of a compromise, not at least from the perspective of workers. To me the whole thing looks like just trying to find the easiest path to screw over any concept of Social Democracy in favor for a everyman for himself philosophy typical of the Economic Right. In context &#8216;bi-partisan&#8217; here is defined as compromise between the conservatives and the DLC/centrist wing of the Democratic Party, the concept that the New Dealers should have some voice is dismissed out of hand.</p>
