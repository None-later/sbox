<p>by Bruce Webb<br />Following up on the publication of CBO&#8217;s Long Term Budget Outlook (see previous two of my posts) CBO yesterday published <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/115xx/doc11580/SummaryforWeb_SSOptions.pdf">Social Security Policy Options (Summary for Web)</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/115xx/doc11580/07-01-SSOptions_forWeb.pdf">Social Security Policy Options (Full 51 pg PDF)</a> scoring various revenue and spending cut measures that have been proposed for Social Security. The included Table shows various fixes scored as a percentage of 75 year GDP with the gap measured at -0.6%. Meaning that any fix scored at 0.6% or above backfills the entire gap, while fixes scored below that would have to be applied in combination. CBO does warn that certain fixes are interactive meaning that they are not simply additive, applying two might have either positive or negative effects on the total. I am going to publish this to get the ball rolling but will be updating both this post and comments over the next couple of hours.</p>
<p>BTW, the full version provides an excellent summary of Social Security overall, people not totally familiar with how the system operates (and some who think they are familiar but labor under certain misconceptions) might find it  useful to skim through the relevant sections.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />Well there is a lot here. First it is fairly common for people on the Left to insist that the easy solution is just to lift the cap. But as the table shows it matters a great deal how that is implemented, for example a fix along the lines suggested by Obama during the campaign of taxing income above $250,000 at 4-6% would close the gap between 0.1 and 0.15% or between a sixth and a quarter of what is needed. On the other hand simply eliminating the taxable minimum while allowing those extra taxes to contribute to benefits neatly fills the gap, while eliminating it and not allowing that to contribute provides a 0.9% fix which would leave room to enhance lower income worker benefits. But advocates need to be specific in what they are proposing, &#8216;lift the cap&#8217; on its own is too reductionist.</p>
<p>Second this table pretty much validates the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2009/05/northwest-plan-real-fix-for-social.html">Northwest Plan for a Real Social Security Fix</a>. While no option matches it exactly, option 2 is very close and in line with Coberly&#8217;s original proposal (pre-trigger): phase in a 2% increase by 0.1% per year, 0.05% each for employee and employer, for 20 years and the entire 0.6% gap is accounted for.</p>
<p>Third some of the benefit cut proposals being made end up being pretty punitive while still not doing the trick. For example means testing has to include 70% of all workers even to make up 5/6th  of the gap while raising the Full Retirement Age to 70 only fills half of it. At a minimum we owe it to workers to allow them to have a voice in whether they want to accept a phased in tax increase rather than what can add up  to dramatic changes in lifetime benefits.</p>
<p>The longer version of the document examines the specific effects of all 30 listed options.</p>

<p>Under CBO&#8217;s &#8216;Extended Baseline&#8217;, i.e. roughly Current Law the 75 year actuarial gap is up to 1.6% from 1.3% and the date of Trust Fund Exhaustion moved back from 2043 to 2039. Under the &#8216;Alternative Fiscal Scenario&#8217; the corresponding numbers are 2.1% and 2037 or right in line with the Social Security Trustees 2009 projections. Meaning that the NW Plan as currently  formulated would handle even CBO&#8217;s more pessimistic projection. The sky is not falling and contrary to some people&#8217;s calculations the Trust Funds will not go to zero by 2012.</p>
<p>And while the percentage of GDP that will go to Social Security is projected to increase from 4.8% to 6.2% under both alternatives this has to be (or at least morally should be) balanced against the fact that the percentage of people eligible for retirement will grow from 22% to 35%. Unless someone would care to make the argument that older people should  ipso facto get a smaller share of productivity per capita in the future than they do now this hardly seems unreasonable.</p>

<p>via Brad DeLong we learn that CBO is releasing its 2010 Long Term Budget Outlook on Wednesday at 9AM. Which is also the date that the 2010 Social Security Report is (over-)due to be released. Which means some head to head, apples to apples comparisons of economic projections over the 75 year window.</p>
<p>The Long Term Budget Outlook shouldn&#8217;t be confused with the more detailed (for my purposes) Long Term Social Security Projection typically put out by CBO in August, but there should still be plenty of material on Social Security and Medicare to discuss. Good times!</p>

<p>Those of us who follow the Obama Deficit Commission and its seeming hyper-focus on cutting Social Security were heartened last week by what turned into a veritable de-pantsing of Commission co-Chairman Alan Simpson in the course of an 8 minute video interview outside the (closed) doors of the Commission by Social Security Works Communications Director Alex Lawson. Alex&#8217;s video went viral and then some. Anyway you can read and hear my new buddy Alex speaking for himself: http://socialsecurity-works.org/author/alex-lawson/.</p>
<p>Plus Jane Hamsher and Firedoglake have been live streaming Alex&#8217;s and SSW&#8217;s film with the latest installment here: <a target="_blank" href="http://seminal.firedoglake.com/diary/56262">Livestreaming the Closed Door Fiscal Commission Pt. 5</a>. Not real lively on a minute to minute basis, unless  you are a big fan of tall polished wood doors, but I thought this little note from Jane was interesting.<br />
<blockquote>[Ed. Note: After Alex&#8217;s encounter with Alan Simpson, the committee has apparently moved the meeting location without notice. Alex is trying to find out where it is being held.]</p></blockquote>
<p> Well it looks like somebody struck a nerve. Congrats to Alex and to his bosses at SSW, Nancy Altman and Eric Kingson (plus Policy Director Lori Hanson), who along with Roger Hickey and his people at CAF are keeping the heat beating on that tin roof.</p>
<p>So to those who have been wondering when someone, anyone besides Baker and Krugman were going to call out the Social Security &#8216;Reformers&#8217; the answer is &#8220;right now&#8221;.</p>
<p>P.S. the original revised release date for the Annual Report of the Trustees of Social Security was for next Wednesday June 30th. There are rumors that that date might slip for reasons unstated (the Report by law is due April 1), but when it does come out you can fully expect Social Security Bears Bruce and Dale to come out of our caves and bring you the numbers, plus in due course an updated Northwest Plan for a Real Social Security Fix.</p>

<p>We learn why they hate social security:</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.ncpssm.org/entitledtoknow/?p=1099">NCPSSM e-mail</a> (update)<br />Apparently, these are the “good-old days” our nation’s fiscal hawks relish.  The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pgpf.org/">Peterson Foundation’s</a> David Walker co-hosted <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/15838368">CNBC’s Squawk Box</a> this morning (personally, we yearn for the good-old days when so-called “news” shows were hosted by journalists—not partisan advocates—but that’s another debate). </p>
<p>The discussion followed the classic Peterson Foundation <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thenation.com/article/looting-social-security-part-2">talking points</a>—government bad, &#8216;business&#8217; good—but ultimately led to a nostalgic reminiscence for the good old days when Americans faced debtors prisons and had no sense of “entitlement” (presumably to the Social Security and Medicare benefits workers already paid for their entire working lives):</p>
<blockquote><p>“The fact of the matter is we have to change how we do things. We are on an imprudent and unsustainable path in a number of ways. You talk about debtors prisons, we used to have debtors prisons, now bankruptcy is no taint. Bankruptcy is an exit strategy. Our society and our culture have changed. We need to get back to opportunity and move away from entitlement. We need to be able to provide reasonable risk but hold people accountable when they do imprudent things…it’s pretty fundamental.”…David Walker, Peterson Foundation, CNBC Jun 10, 2010</p></blockquote>

<p>High on the list of tasks mandated of the Obama Deficit Commission is to get the deficit down to 3% of GDP by 2015. Unfortunately for them they have set up a situation where they can&#8217;t move that number via cuts to Social Security, if anything such cuts more one of their metrics the wrong way. To understand why we need to revisit old friends including &#8216;Leninist Strategy&#8217;, &#8216;CSSS&#8217;, &#8216;deficit&#8217;, &#8216;debt&#8217; and &#8216;unfunded liability&#8217;.</p>
<p>It was well understood as far back as the publication of Butler and Germanis&#8217; <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cato.org/pubs/journal/cj3n2/cj3n2.html">Leninist Strategy (11th article here)</a> in 1983 that cutting benefits in the near term for existing retirees and even for newly approaching retirees was both politically deadly and deeply inequitable, these people simply didn&#8217;t have time to do alternative planning through Personal Retirement Accounts or anything else. This reality was explicitly recognized by Bush&#8217;s 2001 Commission to Strengthen Social Security where it was established as Guiding Principle no 1 of 6 <a target="_blank" href="http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/csss/index.htm">CSSS</a>. Now how long this grace period should be and whether it would be permanent for that class of retirees, or whether they would ultimately share in whatever index changes were adopted vary across plans. What doesn&#8217;t vary is the fact that no plan entirely based  on benefit cuts can move that 2015 target number.</p>
<p>The why and how of this below the fold.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />The first problem is that Social Security &#8216;reformers&#8217; continually confuse &#8216;deficit&#8217;, &#8216;debt&#8217; and &#8216;unfunded liability&#8217;. They implicitly assume that current year deficits sum into ten year debt increases which in turn equate to long-term unfunded liabilities. And if we were just talking about General Fund spending this would largely be so. But Social Security throws some wrinkles in.</p>
<p>Lets take the extreme case, one where benefit cuts happen right away from Day One. Well if big enough they would put Social Security back in cash-flow positive  territory (CBO&#8217;s &#8216;Primary Surplus&#8217;) and so score as a reduction in deficits compared to the baseline, so far so good. But by forestalling the need to pay a portion of the interest accruing on the Trust Fund in cash those cuts equally serve to pad the bottom line of Trust Fund balances, which for this purpose score as a part of total Public Debt. To make it worse interest not paid out in cash gets transformed into new principal which itself starts drawing interest and so boosting Trust Fund Balances compared to the baseline. Exactly how are you creating &#8216;intergenerational equity&#8217; and relieving your children and grand-children when the net effect of short term cuts is a boost in long-term debt. (I know this sounds goofy, but that  is the way the numbers run).</p>
<p>So the Commission is already in a trap, they can improve the short term deficit position by cutting benefits and in so doing also have positive effects on 75 year and Infinite Future actuarial gaps but only at the cost of actually increasing Public Debt over the medium term. But it gets worse, because they have already ruled out short term benefit cuts.</p>
<p>The strictest plan being floated right now is that of co-Chairman Alan Simpson. He would reduce the grace period so that it only cover people 60 and older. But this means that you simply don&#8217;t see any savings at all until people now aged 59 reach Full Retirement Age which in practice means 2017. Meaning you don&#8217;t move the number in the target year of 2015 AT ALL. And unless you quickly phase in those benefit cuts in a big way in 2017 you end up with no real impact on your standard CBO Ten Year score.</p>
<p>And the Ryan Roadmap makes this worse, he would exempt people 55 and older which means your very first savings come in 2022 and so outside the 10 Year scoring window altogether. And  then you have people like Bachmann vaguely  proposing to &#8216;wean&#8217; people under 50 off Social Security, which puts any savings off until 2027. Which is fine if your real goal is to eliminate Social Security over the long run, but not particularly compelling when you are trying to sell this as a deficit and debt reduction measure sparked by short term Obama spending. It literally does not compute.</p>
<p>The current public line being taken by most of the Commissioners is that they have to tackle Social Security to show the bond market that they are serious. But since it is doubtful they have the cojones to cut  benefits in the short term and even if they do won&#8217;t have the effect they need on either their Public Debt or Debt Held by the Public metrics, how is that supposed to reassure the bond markets of anything?</p>
<p>Now the Commission has a tiny exit hole. If they can keep the focus entirely on reducing the 75 year and Infinite Future actuarial gap and keep the public in the dark about the actual effect of their proposals on ten year deficits and twenty year debt levels they might escape the trap. But their political need in the here and now to make unpopular future cuts to Social Security somehow forced on them by current deficits makes it difficult for them to pull the bait and switch, over the last year the  informed public has been trained to look at the CBO score and in that regard the Commission has nothing.</p>

<p>Eric Laursen in his post <a target="_blank" href="http://peoplespension.infoshop.org/blogs-mu/2010/05/24/cato-premieres-its-latest-horror-show/#more-50">Cato Premieres its Latest Horror Show</a> points us to a new book forthcoming called &#8216;Social Security; A Fresh Look at Policy Alternatives&#8217; by senior Cato fellow Jagadeesh Gokhale. Gokhale along with his oft-time collaborator Kent Smetters seems to be the father of  &#8216;intergenerational equity&#8217; and lead advocate for measuring that over the &#8216;Infinite Future Horizon&#8217;.</p>
<p>Eric, backed up by people as varied as the American Academy of Actuaries and conservative economist Bruce Bartlett, does a nice job showing why Infinite Future is not a useful tool in this instance, a topic I have taken up from time to time and I urge people to read it. But what interested me is what it revealed about the curious timeline during which Infinite Future even became part of the Social Security Policy discussion. Details below the fold.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />The key paragraphs come right up front in Eric&#8217;s piece:<br />
<blockquote>In August 2003, Joe Lieberman, then in the early stages of launching a presidential bid, wrote a letter to Treasury Secretary John Snow in which he accused the administration of “stripping out” from its 2004 budget the findings of an internal Treasury paper that Snow’s predecessor Paul O’Neill had ordered up. Attempting to stake out a position as the toughest of the deficit hawks, Lieberman suggested that “this administration is trying to hide the true nature of our financial obligations from the American people in order to advance its agenda of cutting taxes indiscriminately.”</p>
<p>The paper was written by Gokhale, then at the Cleveland Fed, and Kent Smetters, then deputy assistant Treasury secretary for economic policy. Contrary of Lieberman’s claim, Smetters claimed it had been “for internal discussion only,” to try to help O’Neill “think about [the deficit] from an economic perspective.” There was no conspiracy to suppress it, he said; the administration considered including it in the budget but then decided against it. Gokhale and Smetters revised their paper and presented it four times in Washington in May 2003, including to the American Enterprise Institute. They then published it as an AEI monograph.</p></blockquote>
<p> This suggests without saying so that this &#8216;internal Treasury paper&#8217; was the work product of Sping 2003 and was suppressed during the preparation of the Budget that Fall. But this can&#8217;t be so, as Smetters and Gokhale pointed out in a July Op-Ed similar language had been included in the 2003 Social Security Report, itself signed off by newly installed Secretary Snow.</p>
<p>The 2003 Social Security Report was released on Mar 17, 2003, two weeks earlier than normal and coincidentally or not the week the invasion of Iraq was announced, to say that &#8216;nobody noticed&#8217; was a gross understatement. In any event it contained this curious (to me) language.<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;Even a 75-year period is not long enough to provide a complete picture of Social Security&#8217;s financial condition. Figures II.D6 and II.D7 show that the program&#8217;s financial condition continues to worsen at the end of the period. Some experts have noted that overemphasis on summary measures for a 75-year period can lead to incorrect perceptions and to policy prescriptions that do not move towards a sustainable system. In order to provide a more complete description of Social Security&#8217;s very long-run financial condition this year the Trustees present actuarial estimates over a time period that extends to the infinite horizon. These calculations show that extending the horizon indeed increases the unfunded obligation, indicating that much larger changes would be required to achieve solvency over the infinite future as compared to changes needed according to 75-year period measures.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Who were &#8216;some experts&#8217; and why was their advice privileged over say the statutory group of outside advisors <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssab.gov/About/Members.html">Social Security Advisory Board</a> (a group of which Gokhale is the newest advisor).</p>
<p>So whether or not Smetters and Gokhale are the &#8216;some experts&#8217;, clearly this idea was floating around early enough to be incorporated in a March Report, and if that &#8216;internal report&#8217; had been prepared for Secty O&#8217;Neill, it would have had to come into being sometime before O&#8217;Neill left office in Dec 31, 2002. Meaning likely over the course of 2002.</p>
<p>Which leaves the lingering question of &#8216;who had the authority to have this included in the Reports to be signed by the Trustees on March 17?&#8217; More importantly &#8216;why was this thought to be important or useful?&#8217;</p>
<p>Well a trip back to the timeline may be important. Although Bush didn&#8217;t run for office in 2000 heavily on the issue of Social Security clearly it was a high domestic priority, he had his CSSS <a target="_blank" href="http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/csss/index.htm">Commission to Strengthen Social Security</a> in place by June 2001, complete with charter and membership with a tight seven month deadline for reporting, by all indications he was ready to take this to the country in spring 2002. Well 9/11 changed his priorities, by the time the Report was released on Dec 21st we were engaged in Afghanistan, and the entirety of 2002 was eaten up building support for a War on Iraq, the time clearly wasn&#8217;t ripe to take on Social Security at the same time.</p>
<p>But this left the Report and its recommendations exposed, particularly CSSS Model 2 which was known to be the Administrations preferred plan (Model 1 &#038; 3 mostly being variations on a fundamental theme. And during 2002 the CSSS Model 2 and related plans were subject to attack by places like EPI and CEPR . Because of a different timeline altogether.</p>
<p>From 1997 to 2004 Social Security was under tremendous outside pressure, not because its financial condition was degrading in the face of inactivity, instead it was improving year over year. In 1997 the projected 75 year payroll gap was 2.23% of payroll, by 2001 it was down to 1.86%. In 1997 the date of Trust Fund depletion was set at 2030, by 2001 it was 2039 and on way to being pushed back to 2042 by Report Year 2003. At this point what Baker and Weisbrot had identified in their 1999 book as <a target="_blank" href="http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/035468.html">Social Security: the Phony Crisis</a> was looking pretty phony indeed. And the closer you looked at the internals the more phony it got.</p>
<p>The outlook for Social Security improved so dramatically from 1997 to 2002 for the very same reason that huge and growing Bush I deficits turned to small but growing Clinton General Fund surpluses and large and growing massive Clinton Social Security surpluses were turning into huge projected surpluses, we had just experienced an extended period of low inflation, high employment and significant Real Wage increases, all of which boosted revenues and cut projected cost. Moreover most of our economic elite, including most decidedly Fed Chair Alan Greenspan were insisting that this so-called Great Moderation was permanent, so much so that it justified huge tax cuts for the wealthy.</p>
<p>The problem is that the Great Moderation and Social Security Crisis were fundamentally at odds. Social Security Crisis in the yar 2000 relied on a relatively rapid and permanent slowdown in productivity and Real Wage over the next ten years. For example the 2002 Report (http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR02/trLOT.html), the closest in time to the Dec 2001 release of the CSSS Report projected that Real Wage would drop from 2.8% in 2001, itself well down from the highs of the late 90&#8217;s to 1.1% in 2007 and stay there permanently (Table IV.B1). Likewise the IC model projected that unemployment already up sharply in 2001 to 4.8% would never get better and instead settle out permanently at 5.5% and that real GDP which maybe took a short term hit with the 2001 recession (which could be blamed on the last Administration) would never get back to the 4% plus rates of Clinton&#8217;s second term but instead was destined within ten-years to shrink to sub 2% a year FOREVER. (Table IV.B2). To which numbers a reasonable observer might ask: &#8220;What the hell is going to happen to this much vaunted Great Moderation?&#8221; and &#8220;This is the fricking miracle of tax cuts? Permanent 5.5% unemployment, 1.8% Real GDP, and 1.6% productivity?&#8221;</p>
<p>Given the outsized promises being made about the effects of tax cuts during the 2001-2002 time frame (i.e. all positive for everyone, capital and labor alike), and the promises that even bigger tax cuts would not materially reduce surpluses going forward, how could the Bush men still maintain Social Security &#8216;crisis&#8217; with a straight face. Easy, you just redefine it as not being a crisis for this century, i.e. caused by Boomer retirement, but instead as a crisis for the NEXT century and the ones after that.</p>
<p>Thus the introduction of Infinite Future in time for the 2003 Report allowed the substitution of a 3.5% payroll gap for a 1.86% one and so gave cover for reform packages whose combination of benefit cuts and tax increases far exceeded the 75 year gap. For example the Liebman-MacGuineas-Samwick &#8216;Non-Partisan&#8217; Plan proposes a combined 5.2% fix to a problem then scored at 1.92% (75 year) or 3.5% (infinite future). With a little slight of hand the LMS authors were able to hide 1.5% of the fix in the fine print and convince people that the difference between 3.7% and 3.5% would easily be made up by having an inheritable asset, the so-called &#8216;Ownership Society&#8217;. On close examination that breaks down, most workers wouldn&#8217;t end up with any estate out of their PRAs (unless they were lucky enough to drop dead right after retirement), but either way that was a lot easier to sell than the starker 5.2% vs 1.92%.</p>
<p>Now I can&#8217;t prove motivation for the switch to Infinite Future, but it is pretty clear that the original plan for  the Bush Administration was to push the CSSS &#8216;Bi-Partisan&#8217; Model 2 plan through Congress in 2002 in much the same way they tried to push the Social Security Crisis Tour through in 2005, or regrettably how Obama is allowing the Rubinistas to jam through cuts via the &#8216;Bi-Partisan&#8217; Deficits Commission in 2011: assemble a theoretically &#8216;non-partisan&#8217; group of &#8216;experts&#8217;, use some baked-up and bogus economic models and projections and then create a sense of inevitability around the whole thing. The key is to keep your eye on the numbers and not let them work out of two sets of books, one to predict crisis, and another implicitly to present solutions.</p>
<p>(For some earlier takes on this you might want to consult the first series of: http://bruceweb.blogspot.com/2008/05/social-security-posts-on-angry-bear.html, particularly VI, VII, and XII and then maybe follow up with selected posts from the third series: http://bruceweb.blogspot.com/2009/01/even-more-posts-from-angry-bear-late.html)</p>
<p> The criticism came in mixed and matched form. First when compared to the productivity rates that were firmly being projected by Greenspan and used to argue for tax cuts, numbers in the out years seemed oddly muted. Where was this permanent productivity and GDP growth we were being promised? Second if the Trustees numbers were actually plausible how do you get the return on equities needed to fund PRAs (hence NELB and BDK)? All of which contributed to the biggest challenge of all: how do you put together a set of numbers that funds PRAs and Legacy costs all at a lower rate than a straight out tax fix would? Particularly when year over year the cost of that fix kept dropping?</p>

                                <p>by Bruce Webb</p>
<p>I have had occasion before to mention the &#8220;Leninist Strategy&#8221; for Social Security put forth in 1983 and followed by Social Security &#8216;reformers&#8217; ever since. The strategy has three main pillars:</p>
<p>One: reassure current retirees that their benefits won&#8217;t be cut<br />Two: convince younger workers that left unreformed Social Security just won&#8217;t be there for them<br />Three: blame the Boomers</p>
<p>Well time has moved on since 1983 and increasingly pillars One and Three are coming into collision and this combined with CBO scoring methodology has put the Deficits Commission into a bind. One which I will outline below the fold.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />A central tenet of the Cato endorsed &#8220;Leninist Strategy&#8221; for Social Security Reform outlined in Butler and Germanis (1983) http://www.cato.org/pubs/journal/cj3n2/cj3n2-11.pdf was that benefits for those in or approaching retirement should not be affected (p.549). This was billed as a matter of equity but was equally a bow to political reality. This tenet was maintained in the establishment of Bush&#8217;s CSSS (Commission to Strengthen Social Security) in 2001 as the first of the six Guiding Principles http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/csss/index.htm and most recently is a feature of the Ryan Roadmap which promises to hold at least initial benefits for workers 55 and older harmless.</p>
<p>Unfortunately this consistent upholding of Pillar One of the &#8220;Leninist Strategy&#8221; is undermining Pillar Three because workers 55 to 64 ARE Boomers and it is pretty hard to hold them responsible for &#8216;Crisis&#8217; and yet give them a free pass, the rhetorical underpinnings of the &#8220;Leninist Strategy&#8221; are simply aging themselves out of effectiveness.</p>
<p>Adding to this rhetorical challenge for the &#8216;reformers&#8217; is a methodological one deriving from CBO scoring. Traditionally  both CBO and OMB score proposals over a ten-year time period and only occasionally peak over that horizon. But if as the current Ryan Roadmap does <a target="_blank" href="http://www.roadmap.republicans.budget.house.gov/Issues/Issue/?IssueID=8521">Ryan Roadmap: Social Security</a> and promise  that it &#8220;Preserves the existing Social Security program for those 55 or older&#8221; you get a ten-year CBO deficit score of near-zero. And if you define &#8220;preserves&#8221; and &#8220;existing&#8221; as also covering the COLA adjustment you almost equally kill any score for the next ten-year period.</p>
<p>This problem was largely self-created, those pushing for this Commission relied on a deliberate confusion of the concepts of deficit, debt and unfunded liability to use relatively short term deficits to sell&#8217; solutions that realistically only address long-term debt and &#8216;liability&#8217;. In fact the official name of the Commission is <a target="_blank" href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/president-obama-establishes-bipartisan-national-commission-fiscal-responsibility-an">Bipartisan National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform</a> and its mission statement does not explicitly reference &#8216;deficit&#8217; at all. Yet a search on &#8216;Obama deficit commission&#8217; pulls up 10X the hits of &#8216;Obama fiscal responsibility commission&#8217; and most of the latter reference the former anyway. For better or worse the MSM has settled on &#8216;Deficit Commission&#8217;.</p>
<p>A couple of years ago hardly anyone outside the policy world knew or cared much about CBO scoring, but a year of Health Care Reform has accustomed people to use that score as a touchstone. Adhering to the &#8220;Leninist Strategy&#8221; and the Ryan Roadmap for Social Security will return a big fat Zero as a CBO score. On the flip side most of the &#8216;fixes&#8217; floating around out there give Boomers a mostly free pass. Which leaves the &#8216;Deficit&#8217; Commission a tough choice: get a good score by sticking it to Boomers right away, and so angering the single largest demographic cohort of Americas precisely when they are in the prime voting year? or take the zero and  try to sell Gen-X and the Millenials that taking huge future benefit cuts that do nothing to address short term deficits is just the price they have to pay for past excesses?</p>
<p>In my view Entitlements Crisis people over-played their hand. First they sat by while their allies in the Republican Party rather cynically used the savings from Medicare reforms in the HCR bill to be framed as &#8220;medicare cuts&#8221;, and second allowed the framing of the Fiscal Responsibility Commission to fall within &#8220;Obama deficits&#8221; when realistically they will have no short term effect. Not at least without significant short term political fallout. Should be interesting.</p>

                                <p>by Bruce Webb</p>
<p>This may be too wonkish for the Virtual Summit, so let me try it out here.</p>
<p>A lot of crosstalk on Social Security &#8216;crisis&#8217; is a result of three different definitions of &#8216;crisis&#8217; which I would sum up as follows:</p>
<p>Crisis one: Social Security promised benefits which may not be payable.<br />Crisis two: Social Security promised benefits which were not affordable.<br />Crisis three: Social Security promised benefits which should not have been promised.</p>
<p>Note the changes in tense and mood, changes which constrain the range of acceptable fix. Crisis one is probabalistic (&#8216;may&#8217;), it doesn&#8217;t necessarily commit to the proposition that those benefits actually can&#8217;t be payable, and implicitly assumes that such payments are desireable. Crisis two however is deterministic, in this frame the damage has been done, and implicitly argues that the only  question is what to do about it. Crisis three is moralistic, it claims that even the attempt to pay these benefits was a mistake, that the effort was flawed from the beginning.</p>
<p>Taking Crisis three first. From this standpoint, one associated with Rand, Friedman and the Austrians the only real question is how to transition away from Social Security as currently configured and the solutions proposed will tend to gravitate towards such things as private or personal accounts.</p>
<p>On the other hand Crisis two assumes that the damage has been done and its solutions will naturally tend to gravitate towards benefit cuts.</p>
<p>And finally Crisis one will see benefit cuts as the fallback position, given the probabilities maybe necessary but not something to be embraced, and is open to some sort of revenue enhancement.</p>
<p>As to ranges of fixes. A Crisis three person is not necessarily open to any kind of fix whether that fix is proposed on the cost or revenue side, that is just to perpetuate what with Friedman they believe to be an &#8220;immoral&#8221; system. On the other hand a Crisis two person will reflexively reject any tax based fix on the time honored principle of &#8220;Don&#8217;t throw good money after bad&#8221;. Only if you have a Crisis one mentality does, for example, the Northwest Plan even make sense, because Crisis three people refject the whole idea of a fix and Crisis two people regard the status quo as already broken.</p>
<p>Which is why supporters of traditional Social Security often just miss their marks entirely, they assume naively that their desired end of retirement security through social insurance at the promised level of benefits is simply accepted and that the only  question is the method when neither half of that end is necessarily accepted by the opposition. So when people like my friend Dale make an argument in the form of &#8220;We have a moral responsibility to support the subsistence of the elderly and the cost of doing that in a way that delivers 100% of the scheduled benefit is cheap&#8221; it simply falls on deaf ears, with Crisis three people replying to the former assertion &#8220;The hell we do&#8221; and Crisis two people asserting that the current cost is already too high.</p>
<p>This is why I get impatient with progressives and to some extent with Dale (who doesn&#8217;t consider himself a progressive in that sense), they insensibly assume that their desired end is even shared. &#8220;Just lift the payroll tax cap and the problem is fixed!&#8221; is not compelling to people who don&#8217;t want to fix it that problem in that frame. Their frames will lead them to a totally different range of fixes. Hence the crosstalk.</p>
