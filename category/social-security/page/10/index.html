                                <p>Bruce has made this point repeatedly.  Dr. Black <a href="http://www.eschatonblog.com/2011/01/social-security-will-never-be-in.html">puts it in more direct language</a>:<br />
<blockquote>[I]nevitably the Social Security Trustees will, perfectly justifiably, tweak a few assumptions about future economic activity so that there will be a DOOM scenario, an EVERYTHING&#8217;S AWESOME scenario, and a &#8220;uh oh maybe in about 40 years we will have a problem&#8221; scenario. And then Fred Hiatt will print another million ZOMG WE MUST DESTROY SOCIAL SECURITY NOW IN ORDER TO SAVE IT FORTY YEARS FROM NOW columns and some future president will marvel at those worthless IOUS and blah blah blah.</p>
<p>We know how this works.</p></blockquote>

<ol>
<li>Jason Furman should work on his c.v., and</li>
<li>Even as only Nixon could go to China (because only Nixon was enough of a bastard to sacrifice Tibet to Chou En-Lai), only the Obama Administration can turn the Social Safety Net into something the Republicans &#8220;saved&#8221; (by making it look like <a href="http://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://www.theoccidentalobserver.net/authors/Dresden.jpg&#038;imgrefurl=http://www.theoccidentalobserver.net/authors/Sunic-RaceIV.html&#038;h=326&#038;w=433&#038;sz=30&#038;tbnid=gWVHTMDiqBqv0M:&#038;tbnh=95&#038;tbnw=126&#038;prev=/images%3Fq%3Ddresden%2Bafter%2Bbombing&#038;zoom=1&#038;q=dresden+after+bombing&#038;hl=en&#038;usg=__6rrSDlo3mtcn4Q8ANGKD6QKWt4I=&#038;sa=X&#038;ei=cpkiTbXQAYWBlAea6tWLDA&#038;sqi=2&#038;ved=0CCkQ9QEwAw">Dresden</a>).</li>

<p>UPDATE: Tim Duy at his branch of Ecoonomist&#8217;s View <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/timduy/2011/01/what-is-rubins-legacy.html">piles on</a> (h/t <a href="http://www.interfluidity.com/">Steve Randy Waldman</a>&#8216;s Twitter feed, or maybe <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/">Felix Salmon</a>&#8216;s), giving the lie to whatever was left of the DeLong argument that being left of a cadre of Bob Rubins makes one a &#8220;liberal.&#8221;  Pull quote:<br />
<blockquote>The strong Dollar policy takes shape in 1995.  At that point, Rubin made it clear that the rest of the world was free to manipulate the value of the US Dollar to pursue their own mercantilist interests.  This should have been more obvious at the time given that China was last named a currency manipulator was 1994, but the immensity of that decision was lost as the tech boom engulfed America.</p>
<p>Moreover, Rubin adds insult to injury in the Asian Financial Crisis, by using the IMF as a club to enact far reaching reforms on nations seeking aid.  The lesson learned &#8211; never, ever run a current account deficit.  Accumulating massive reserves is the absolute only way to guarantee you can always tell the nice men from the IMF and the US Treasury to get off your front porch.</p></blockquote>
<p>Go <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/timduy/2011/01/what-is-rubins-legacy.html">Read the Whole Thing</a>.</p>
<p><em>Full Disclosure Update</em>: Bob Rubin&#8217;s son is a college classmate of mine.  Haven&#8217;t really seen him in the past not-quite-thirty years.</p>
<p>*I&#8217;m 99.44% certain those are assigned correctly. The Sensible one thinks that &#8220;attempt[ing] to push Clinton administration economic policy a little further to the left&#8221; was a Liberal position, while the Centrist is stupid enough not to believe people who have said for years that they intend to pick his pocket have something valuable to contribute to a discussion of his welfare, and does not remember that he lived through a decade when &#8220;the program [was] officially in balance.&#8221;</p>
<p>If H*ll exists as a form of reincarnation, my next life will be spent as a Centrist. If all my sins are venial and Purgatory awaits, I could live with being Sensible. At least until my neighbors <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2011/01/post-christmas-shopping-in-the-wc.html">couldn&#8217;t send their academically-achieving issue to college for purely monetary reasons</a>, after which point I would consider <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2011/01/welcome-to-the-teens.html">this post</a> to be rampant optimism.</p>

<p>There has been a recent mini-surge of op-eds claiming that the &#8216;assets&#8217; of the Trust Funds, all $2.6 trillion, are simply mythical. The most recent Scrooge to argue this line may have been Thomas McClanahan of the KC Star in this piece from Christmas: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.kansascity.com/2010/12/25/2541981/more-mythbusting-on-social-security.html#ixzz19cZufvLE">More mythbusting on Social Security ‘money’&#8221;</a> in which he informs us how mistaken we are:<br />
<blockquote>Many people believe the trust fund contains securities that have real economic value. So, a few days ago, I wrote an editorial titled “The myth of the trust fund.” </p></blockquote>
<p>and<br />
<blockquote>To turn trust fund bonds into real money, the government must do what it would have to do if the trust fund did not exist: borrow, cut spending somewhere else, or raise taxes. The trust fund bonds may be assets from the point of view of Social Security, but they’re a liability for the government as a whole, and for us as taxpayers</p></blockquote>
<p>Well the argument is at base nonsense on historical, political, legal and economic grounds, but it also suffers a logical hole big enough to run a Prison Bus through. Because if it is true in 2010 it was equally true in 1993 when the Trust Funds first got back to actuarial balance (per McClanahan another myth presumedly) and more to the point in 1983 when Reagan agreed to the tax increase via the Greenspan Commission. Which would logically make Dutch and the Maestro Greenspan pre-meditated thieves and liars.</p>
<p>And more to the point you would have to add almost everyone in the political, media and academic establishment who didn&#8217;t raise this seeming clear objection back in 1993, there being no logical point of separation whereby real assets suddenly turned into mythical ones. True some people have been arguing one version or another of phony IOU for years, but somehow that never got translated into proposals to cut FICA on wage earners, instead they happily collected the money while apparently per Mr. McClanahan never intending to pay it back, the Treasuries never being real to start with.</p>
<p>Sorry this argument cannot be made in good faith, not unless this guy had a Road to Damascus/Could Have Had a V-8 moment in the very recent past. A polite term for this is special pleading, though Conspiracy to Commit a few million Counts of Larceny fits pretty well.</p>
<p>Do the assets in the Trust Fund have economic value? Well since 2006 the DI Trust Fund has been taking first interest and starting last year principle in cash. And the &#8216;checks&#8217; are clearing, what more proof do you need that Special Treasuries have exchange value beyond the fact they are exchanged for value every workday of the year? Now there are arguments that would plausibly suggest that the strain of this redemption will create a problem at some future date, but those arguments should come with numbers and dates and percentages of GDP attached and not just be advanced via &#8216;Shazam! Its a Myth! Oh Foolish One!&#8217; No it is a proposal by liars to promote theft. (Which probably blows my opportunity for a party invitation Chez McClanahan).</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>I&#8217;m late to seeing this, and Bruce has probably already covered it, but Doug Elmendorg at the CBO <a href="http://cboblog.cbo.gov/?p=1726">inadvertently gives away the game</a> on the Administration&#8217;s approach to—let alone opinion of—the Social Security &#8220;Trust Fund&#8221;:<br />
<blockquote>The balances in trust funds have accrued because income associated with those programs has exceeded the expenses; when that happens, the surplus cash flow is used to finance the government’s ongoing activities, and the trust fund is credited with a corresponding amount of Treasury securities. Although trust funds have an important legal meaning, <em>in that they may constrain the amount a program can spend</em>, they are essentially an accounting mechanism and <em>have little relevance in an economic or budgetary sense</em>. The value of Treasury securities held by trust funds and other government accounts measures only some of the commitments the government has made, and it <strong><em>includes some amounts that may not represent future obligations at all</em></strong>. [emphases mine]</p></blockquote>
<p>Pay particular attention to that last; it&#8217;s the closest you&#8217;ll find to an acknowledgement from a government official that There is No Crisis.</p>
<p>As Bruce has noted, only by distorting the worst-case and median cases does the Administration produce scenarios under which the Social Security Trust Fund—if credited with its accruals <em><a href="http://www.ssa.gov/history/BudgetTreatment.html">as the Greenspan Commission intended</a></em> (see &#8220;Off-Budget&#8221; Again-&#8220;; h/t PGL <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2006/10/ssa-on-reporting-of-federal-budget.html">here</a>)—does not have the funds to pay its obligations in perpetuity.  (As Dean Baker once observed, if you take those scenarios and apply them to the equity markets, the case for privatization disappears even more quickly.)</p>
<p>Doug Elmendorf&#8217;s admission that there may well be a perpetual Social Security surplus, even if it is phrased as &#8220;some amounts that may not represent future obligations, stands in stark relief of <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2010/11/yes-the-entitlement-commission-was-an-unforced-error-by-the-obama-administration.html">the most notable &#8220;unforced error&#8221; of the Obama Administration</a>.</p>

                                <p>Had a long day of Social Security related blogginess so will just put up this to spark some discussion:</p>
<p>In Part One of this post I discussed the danger that the 2% &#8216;temporary&#8217; payroll tax cut might be a Trojan Horse destined never to expire in full or at all only to have any continuing backfill from the General Fund (by then surely to be described as a &#8216;subsidy&#8217;) subject to an ongoing series of &#8216;compromises&#8217; that gradually phase in benefit cuts rather than take the whole thing at one gulp.</p>
<p>In Part Two I want to discuss a quite different threat. In this scenario the employee share of the payroll tax is allowed to reset to it 6.2% but as a seeming sweetener taxpayers will be allowed or perhaps required to divert it into a Personal Savings Account with the explanation that it really wasn&#8217;t a tax increase at all! Nope the money is still &#8216;yours&#8217;, just tucked away for your own future use rather than being co-mingled in the Trust Funds where you don&#8217;t have an ownership interest at all, why the Supreme Court said so in <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/history/nestor.html">Flemming .v. Nestor</a>. Well a visit to the link shows that this doesn&#8217;t mean what opponents often take it to mean, but the idea that the PRAs would be in any fundamental sense different is illusory, but before getting to that I want to point out a curious coincidence (or not). The 2% payroll tax holiday is the same amount of diversion proposed in most straight PRA proposals out there. Cynical people might suggest that this number was not just plucked out of the air, or back computed to approximate the typical effect of the expiring Make Work Pay tax credit which it is replacing, but instead to put in place elements of say Obama advisor Jeff Liebman&#8217;s Liebman-MacGuineas-Samwick Non-Partisan Social Security Reform Plan or even the more recent <a href="http://crfb.org/sites/default/files/Galston-MacGuineas_Plan.pdf">Galston-MacGuineas Plan</a> which has a mandatory diversion of exactly this amount.</p>
<p>As I have said in other contexts, I don&#8217;t much believe in coincidences. This 2% cut is somewhat under-motivated in policy terms, there were other, simpler, and more targetted ways of putting dollars in workers&#8217; pockets. But as part of a co-ordinated plan to sell some sort of PRA carve out as part of a larger Social Security &#8216;reform&#8217; it makes all too much sense.</p>

                                <p>Update: Brad DeLong <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2010/12/cant-anybody-in-obamas-inner-circle-play-this-game.html">appears to confirm</a> that Obama&#8217;s inner circle would be best served by being placed in a circular firing squad, given live ammo, and being told to &#8220;do what is right.&#8221;</p>
<p>The plethora of disingenuous claims that Barack Obama &#8220;won&#8221; with the McConnell-Obama &#8220;compromise&#8221; are legend.  See, for instance, <a href="http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2010/12/obama-president-mcconnell-sucker.html">the idiocy of Andrew Sullivan</a> (of which Andrew Samwick is too generous when he describes it as &#8220;<a href="http://capitalgainsandgames.com/blog/andrew-samwick/2071/white-house-white-board-tax-deal">poor political tactics</a>&#8220;; see also <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2010/12/aimai-on-mcconnell-obama.html">Brad DeLong</a>), and <a href="http://rortybomb.wordpress.com/2010/12/13/re-examining-the-who-got-what-chart/">the Administration&#8217;s disingenuous &#8220;what &#8216;we&#8217; won&#8221; chart</a>.</p>
<p>The big question was how this is supposed to stimulate the economy. Those of us who argued that it would do damage noted that it was the first move.</p>
<p>Obama has so far played (<a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/12/can-either-james-kwak-or-mark-thoma.html">as I noted earlier</a>):  1 g4 e5 </p>
<p>Now, Mark Thoma discovers that he <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2010/12/cutting-social-security-to-prevent-cuts-in-social-security.html">really does intend 2 f3 and then will wait for the Republican&#8217;s next move</a>:<br />
<blockquote>The second part, now being teed up by the White House and key Senate Democrats, is a scheme for the president to embrace much of the Bowles-Simpson plan — including cuts in Social Security. This is to be unveiled, according to well-placed sources, in the president’s State of the Union address.</p></blockquote>
<p>followed soon by what may be the stupidest serious paragraph ever written by someone who isn&#8217;t Donald Luskin:<br />
<blockquote>White House strategists believe this can also give Obama “credit” for getting serious about deficit reduction — now more urgent with the nearly $900 billion increase in the deficit via the tax cut deal.</p></blockquote>
<p>We have always heard that the first Black President would be subject to an increased threat of assassination.  Only now do we discover that he intends to commit <em>seppuku</em>.</p>
<p>The optimistic version of his chances for re-election now appears to be the case presented by &#8220;Norman&#8221; in comments to my previous post (slightly edited for clarity):<br />
<blockquote>If &#8220;O&#8221; continues his so called compromise—giving in to whatever the right wants—doesn&#8217;t pull a LBJ and gets the nod in 2012, the Repubs nominate Sarah [Palin], then it&#8217;s quite possible he could win again. Only this time, the Republicans would be a deciding factor in the win. Why? Because they know he will cave on just about everything they ask for.</p></blockquote>
<p>The only quibble there may be the &#8220;just about.&#8221;</p>

                                <p>by Bruce Webb (cross posted at new dedicated (and partially funded) blog <a href="http://socialsecuritydefender.blogspot.com/">Social Security Defender</a>) </p>
<p>As part of the Tax Cut deal Obama cut with Republicans there was included a one-year cut of 2% of payroll out of the 6.2% employee share of the overall 12.4% of payroll sent to Social Security. This cut was ostensibly designed in a way that held harmless the Trust Funds, the dollars not being sent from paychecks instead being replaced by transfers from the General Fund. Plus the diversion is on paper only temporary. But in reality this deal not only should have raised red flags, it also should have blown reveille and set off the disaster warning klaxons. This deal represents a terrible danger to Social Security in at least two ways and is terrible policy besides. More below the fold.<br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>If the so-called Payroll Tax Holiday stood on its own, you could argue that it is mildly progressive in that for one year it reduced the taxes of everyone on their first $106,800 of income while paying for it out of taxes that are mostly incident on the top 50%. Unfortunately it effectively replaced the expiring Making Work Pay tax credit which directed all of its benefits to families making at most $70,000. The net result may be a tax hike for as many as one in three workers. The whole grim business is described in this Huff Post piece: <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/12/10/obamarepublican-deal-coul_n_795187.html">Obama-Republican Deal Could Mean Tax Hike For One In Three Workers</a> by the appropriately named Ryan Grim. From my point of view the fact that the tradeoff was suggested by Republicans is all you need to know, millionaires will get a tax cut ten times of that of a single person working at FPL in a minimum wage job.</p>
<p>However this particular issue, however important from an economic justice and income inequality standpoint is somewhat peripheral to Social Security itself. And there are plenty of people more qualified than me to comment on it, starting with Mr. Grim, so over to them on this one. Instead I want to discuss two threats posed to Social Security, one that just brings the funding shortfall much closer in time and is pretty well recognized, and a second that is more subtle but presents an existential threat to Social Security itself.</p>
<p>The first threat is fairly simply stated: in today&#8217;s Washington D.C. there is no such thing as a &#8216;temporary&#8217; tax cut. As long as Republicans have anything to say about it (and since they are effectively calling the shots even before they take control of even the House) there is no such thing as restoration of existing levels of taxation after a &#8216;tax holiday&#8217;, instead any such cuts will be presented as a tax increase, in this case a massive one. Because they can and will play games with percentages. That is while the cut is presented as &#8216;only&#8217; 2% and so to reasonable minds would seem a small part of the revenue flow, it represents 16% of the total revenue flow generated by FICA payroll tax and a whopping 32% of that taken out of workers&#8217; paychecks. Moreover taking the employee share simply back to 2010 levels means an increase from 4.2% to 6.2% or a whopping 47% TAX INCREASE. That is you can expect Obama to get headline credit for a 2% cut but get blamed for a near 50% increase even though it is the same dollars in question.</p>
<p>The anticipated rhetorical spin is only the start of the danger. Social Security Title 2 (what we know as Soc Sec today) has always been a closed system, to paraphrase Lincoln &#8216;of the worker, by the worker, and for the worker&#8217;, having taken nothing directly from capital it owed nothing to capital. Moreover because of the way that its dedicated taxation and later benefit levels were set up it was largely insulated from the Budget and Appropriations process. While opponents of Social Security could and did play games with the 1% of cost related to Administration, an amount that is exposed to those processes, that game playing didn&#8217;t put the whole system at risk (though it caused a lot of misery on the Disability Insurance side, where Admin has always been scandalously underfunded). But in 2011 a very substantial chunk of Social Security income will come from the General Fund. And while it is always possible that the next Congress will just ease that General Fund burden by letting the &#8216;holiday&#8217; lapse on schedule there is no guarantee that they wouldn&#8217;t simply leave the 4.2% rate in place while cutting the subsidy from the General Fund and so blowing around a $120 billion hole in the income stream for 2012 and every year after. With the net effect of bringing the projected date of Trust Fund depletion back dramatically from its current 2037 date, perhaps as early as 2020.</p>
<p>Of course this might appear just too raw and hypocritical for the Republicans, that after crying &#8216;crisis&#8217; they did what they could to precipitate it, but it opens the door for other chicanery. For example the Republicans could offer to leave the 4.2% rate in place, lower the replacement subsidy by 50% and &#8216;compromise&#8217; by cutting future benefits in a way that offsets the other 50%. And then just repeat this exercise every year in their typical framing of separating &#8220;spending we CAN&#8217;T afford&#8221; (which always seems to be social spending) from &#8220;spending we can&#8217;t NOT afford&#8221; (which seems to be everything military and any efforts to raise revenues).</p>
<p>Social Security has been protected throughout its history by the wall represented by a dedicated payroll tax and a Trust Fund whose reserves were drawn from that same stream. This Administration just breached that wall, apparently in the futile attempt to show &#8216;seriousness&#8217; and &#8216;bipartisanship&#8217; which in this case translates to &#8216;willingness to screw your own base&#8217;.</p>
<p>This payroll tax holiday was a terrible policy choice to start with, continuation of Making Work Pay or direct transfers from the General Fund to workers would have been more effective and better targeted stimulus than a tax cut that also flows to millionaires. But the danger is not restricted to the direct breach in the wall. Instead there is a lurking Trojan Horse. Subject of Part Two.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Update: Brad DeLong looks at the data and suggests that <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2010/12/james-kwak-on-the-obama-renaissance.html">the problem may be that the current President is as innumerate as the previous one</a>.</p>
<p>Mark Thoma <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2010/12/the-obama-renaissance.html">quotes James Kwak</a>:<br />
<blockquote>So no, I don’t think Obama is abandoning his principles for political advantage; I think these are his principles. And while I’m upset at him, I’m upset at him for being wrong on the policy level, not for abandoning anything or selling out&#8230;I always thought Obama was a moderate who looked like a progressive.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m with Kwak on that; it&#8217;s one of the reasons I supported the relatively-more-progressive Hillary through the primaries.*</p>
<p>Where I&#8217;m less sanguine is the base from which Mark let him start:<br />
<blockquote>Obama is certainly in a decent position politically, and I would bet on him to be reelected comfortably in 2012.</p></blockquote>
<p>In 1996, Bill Clinton had the advantage of Bob Dole—the 1996 equivalent of Newt Gingrich—being his opponent.  Dole had been a known quantity to voters for over a decade (&#8220;Do you want Grits and Fritz or a Ford Dole?&#8221;) who supported Clarence Thomas, talked about Hideo Nomo of the Brooklyn Dodgers, and fell off the front of a stage—and still <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1996">garnered more than 40% of the vote, losing the popular vote by only slightly more votes than Ross Perot won</a>.  And that was after the advantage of a virtually-uncontested primary, which Mr. Obama may not enjoy.**</p>
<p>Kwak later backtracks a bit:<br />
<blockquote>I think two years would be enough time for labor markets to recover if we could expect policy supporting employment along the way. But we are likely to get just the opposite, deficit cutting measures and other policies that work against employment and hence work against electoral success for the Democrats. <em>Toss in a compromise on Social Security that angers the Democratic base, a possibility that cannot be dismissed as Obama follows up on what appears to be a successful move to the center, and the future does not look as bright.</em> Obama may think he is playing the game well now, but the game is far from over.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is at least far more accurate than the declaration that Obama won when his opening g4 was followed by the Republican&#8217;s e5.  And Thoma follows up with his expectation of Obama&#8217;s next move being f3:<br />
<blockquote>That would put an end to any stimulus due to the tax compromise. <em>Stimulating the economy was never the intent of the GOP when they agreed to the tax compromise, it was all about the estate tax and tax cuts for the wealthy.</em> They will do what they can to decrease government spending over the next two years, starting in January, and if they are successful it will reverse any benefit the economy might have received from the compromise.</p></blockquote>
<p>Given that we all agree on the likely next two years, it would be nice to see an economic model from either Mark or James Kwak that justifies the expectation that Obama is in a position &#8220;to be reelected comfortably in 2012.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the very least, I want to offer to bet with Mr. Kwak, at even odds, with proceeds to go to the charity of the winner&#8217;s choice. Here&#8217;s <a href="http://www.shelterfromthestorm.ca/">my choice</a>.</p>
<p>*The other being that she would know from the start that she was hated, and be ready for bear at the outset. (As an aside: sorry, <a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/">Scott</a>, but hiring Mark Penn, while a mistake, is not a revelation of policy preferences. Or, if you want to argue it is, tell us what replacing Howard Dean and the 50-State Strategy with Tim Kaine and Suborning Democrats such as Sibelius and Napolitano into the Administration is.)</p>
<p>**I say this not only because I would like to see him challenged—his doing a Specter in 2011 is about the only hope for my grandchildren—but also because it makes sense to prepare the field for 2016 and beyond.  It would be dumber of the Democrats <em>not</em> to have someone challenge him in the primary, leaving only HRC and Joe Biden as probably 2016 candidates, than it would be to unite behind him in the hope that Republicans nominate someone who is unelectable a la Dole in 1996.</p>

<p><a href="http://strengthensocialsecurity.org/" target="_blank">Strengthen Social Security</a> a <a href="http://strengthensocialsecurity.org/about/coalition" target="_blank">coalition</a> of progressive organizations determined to protect and strengthen Social Security, coordinated and hosted by <a href="http://strengthensocialsecurity.org/social-security-works" target="_blank">Social Security Works</a> (or maybe by now SSW is hosted by SSSC) produced the above graph. I didn&#8217;t see it on their website and so grabbed it from Ezra Klein&#8217;s post (which does credit SSSC) <a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/ezra-klein/2010/11/the_future_of_social_security.html" target="_blank">The Future of Social Security in One Graph</a></p>
<p>This doesn&#8217;t tell the whole story, for one thing it shows wage indexed results which would seem to discount the actual gains in real benefits under the current schedule, and for another it would be interesting to see the results on the &#8220;if nothing is done&#8221; trendline if we added in the revenue effects alone of the other plans. But however you slice it clearly the goal of &#8216;reform&#8217; is not to deliver an appreciably better result for workers, at best they are being asked for a significant giveaway from the current schedule.</p>

<p>Well it is out and I have a copy. And no doubt in short order it will be up at the following web-page: http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/solvency/index.html but as of 10:43 AM PST it wasn&#8217;t. Because just like the SSA score of the Chairmen&#8217;s proposal there is a lag between release and web publication.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll extract some tables and publish them in a future post but the results are very similar to the Simpson-Bowles Plan with the bottom line being a 75 year improvement in actuarial balance of 2.48% in the face of a current imbalance of 2.01%, that is there is a certain amount of over-kill if the problem is considered simply as one of solvency. For now I will leave you with this simple graphic from the score.<br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/TOQlX_79WDI/AAAAAAAAAbU/5VXK3ipbzOI/s1600/Rivlin-Domenici%2BTF%2BRatio.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/TOQlX_79WDI/AAAAAAAAAbU/5VXK3ipbzOI/s400/Rivlin-Domenici%2BTF%2BRatio.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
