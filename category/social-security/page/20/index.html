<p>(Well it seems a little slow around the Bear Cave today, sorry if this seems like deja vu all over again.)</p>
<p>DI or Social Security Disability Insurance is maybe not in immediate crisis but it is not well. But then again it has been ailing for a long time and where the current recession has given the OAS (Old Age/Survivors) component of Social Security the sniffles, the already compromised immune system of DI has succumbed to pneumonia. Which doesn&#8217;t mean that both need to be rushed to the Emergency Room. Lets take a look at the Figures and Tables.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SdjW7gVkCkI/AAAAAAAAAJM/9FBvyBvicH8/s1600-h/OAS+and+DI+long+term+ratios.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SdjW7gVkCkI/AAAAAAAAAJM/9FBvyBvicH8/s400/OAS+and+DI+long+term+ratios.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />In this graph the dark line represents OAS and the gray line DI while Roman number I shows outcomes under the Low Cost alternative, II under the standard Intermediate Cost alternative, and III the High Cost all as seen from March 2008 in last year&#8217;s Social Security Report. In each case the lines track Trust Fund balances as a percentage of annual cost over time meaning that when they hit bottom Trust Fund assets are depleted, meaning that changes HAVE to be made on either the tax or benefit side for that particular program. But this is not one size fits all, the appropriate fix for DI may be much different that that for OAS, and certainly the urgency levels very.</p>
<p>For example under HIgh Cost DI was projected to go to Depletion in 2017, under Intermediate Cost in 2025, under Low Cost never, if fact it was projected to be vastly overfunded after 2025. But setting Low Cost aside we can see that under both High and Intermediate Cost that DI was in comparatively bad shape even before the depth of the current recession became apparent. If we turn around and examine this in dollar terms it looks like this:<br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/Sd47YnFeFkI/AAAAAAAAAJ0/uJdsOUs8cJA/s1600-h/2008+IV.A2.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/Sd47YnFeFkI/AAAAAAAAAJ0/uJdsOUs8cJA/s400/2008+IV.A2.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />In this table the combination of &#8216;Net contributions&#8217; and &#8216;Tax on benefits&#8217; represents Tax Revenues actually extracted from the current year economy while &#8216;Cost&#8217; represents dollars actually expended. If &#8216;Net contributions&#8217; and &#8216;Tax on benefits&#8217; exceeds &#8216;Total&#8217; Cost then dollars flow from Social Security to the General Fund, if they fall short then the flow goes the other way. Hassett and Biggs of AEI insist that this is the proper measure of &#8216;vanishing Surplus&#8217; and so marks the time for action. I on the other hand prefer to use the CBO definition of &#8216;Surplus&#8217; which includes interest earned on the Trust Fund balance. But squabbling over the terminology is to miss the point at hand, what AEI has done is conflate OAS and DI in an inappropriate way. Inappropriate at least when it comes to changing policy. Explanation below the fold.</p>
<p>In the normal course of events there is little harm in talking about THE Social Security Trust Fund, for most purposes that is how the Trustees discuss the matter, how CBO and OMB treat it for Unified Budget calculations, and how Dean Baker addresses  it. And this is pretty well explained by comparing the combined OASDI TF ratios  to the above figure separating OAS and DI out.<br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/R_PB6t4ggSI/AAAAAAAAAAM/JjA6Q-1kAOQ/s1600-h/Snapshot+2008-04-02+10-08-52.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/R_PB6t4ggSI/AAAAAAAAAAM/JjA6Q-1kAOQ/s320/Snapshot+2008-04-02+10-08-52.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />One you adjust for the difference in scale on the y-axis you can see that under Intermediate Cost that outcomes for combined OASDI are very little different from those of OAS taken alone with the former showing Trust Fund Depletion in 2041 while OAS alone showing it in 2042.  And the reason is pretty simple, OAS at around $2.2 trillion is around ten times the size of DI at around $220 billion, OAS is the dog compared to the DI tail, however vigorously the latter wags it doesn&#8217;t move the whole dog much.</p>
<p>Which is where the AEI folk go astray, they saw some tail movement in February and let the tail wag the dog, when in fact the dog was in reality not moving much at all. If we pull back a little and examine DI numbers in isolation we can see that the combination of &#8216;Net contributions&#8217; and &#8216;Tax on benefits&#8217; fell behind &#8216;Cost&#8217; early in 2006 as we saw $92 billion in tax revenues and $94.5 billion in cost over the year. The world didn&#8217;t come to an end, instead Treasury retired some maturing Special Treasuries and supplied GF cash to make up the difference. Since this didn&#8217;t require the entirety of the earned interest on the DI Trust Fund the TF balance still increased over the year by $8.2 billion. But per AEI definitions this is not a &#8216;surplus&#8217; instead DI has been in deficit for almost three years and well before the current recession was even underway. The recession did have the effect of making DI&#8217;s outlook deteriorate, but that was only to accelerate a trend already in progress.</p>
<p>The Trustees put it this way last March. Bolding mine.<br />
<blockquote>Assets of the DI Trust Fund were greater than 1 year’s expenditures at the beginning of 2008 and would remain above that level through the beginning of 2017. By the beginning of 2018, however, the trust fund ratio is projected to decline to 95 percent, indicating that assets would fall below the 100-per cent level sometime during 2017. Accordingly, the DI Trust Fund does not satisfy the Trustees’ short-range test of financial adequacy under both the intermediate and high cost assumptions. However, under the low cost assumptions the DI Trust Fund does meet the short-range test of financial adequacy, because assets remain above 1 year’s expenditures through the end of the short-range period,</p></blockquote>
<p>Meaning that the claim that the  current recession CAUSED the SS surplus however defined to &#8216;vanish&#8217; is pure bunk. Under CBO scoring both combined OASDI and OAS by itself are in surplus and will remain so until after 2019, in reality the dog barely stirred, the dates of OAS TF shortfall and depletion hardly moving. Even if we use AEI&#8217;s preferred definition of &#8216;Surplus&#8217; we see combined surpluses continuing to 2017 for OASDI and to 2019 for OAS alone which barely moves the outcome as seen on the graphs above.</p>
<p>On the other hand DI is kind of a sick puppy right now.<br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/Sd42phxrUZI/AAAAAAAAAJk/yYKGKACRrPY/s1600-h/OASDI+March+2009+CBO.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/Sd42phxrUZI/AAAAAAAAAJk/yYKGKACRrPY/s400/OASDI+March+2009+CBO.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br /> Where the Trustees projected a $3.3 billion cash deficit in 2008, reality returned a cash deficit of $8 billion. Where the Trustees showed a cash deficit of $4.6 billion for 2009, CBO now projects $20 billion. And where the Trustees projected that TF assets would stop growing and start shrinking in 2012 with TF Depletion in 2025, CBO reports that those assets started shrinking last year (I put it right around July per the TF Monthly Reports) and will go to Depletion in 2019, a six year difference from what the Trustees projected just a year ago.</p>
<p>So what is the proper policy response? We need to fix DI. And just DI and not let the opposition make the claim &#8216;Well since we are forced to fix DI we might as well fix OAS too.&#8217; Well no, it is not clear that OAS is even sick. Certainly the economy gave it a chill, a system that relies on a fixed percentage of wage income is obviously not immune to double digit unemployment, and we would want to keep an eye on that cold and mild fever, in medical terms OAS in &#8216;under observation&#8217;. But that doesn&#8217;t dictate the kind of radical surgery AEI is pushing.</p>
<p>How do you fix DI? Well there are only three ways. One you can just cut benefits to current recipients. But it is not like those checks are that generous to start with. Two you can restrict eligibility. But current approval rates and times for that approval are already scandalous. Or three you can raise taxes. Something the people at AEI normally resist. Which in my opinion is why nobody raised the DI issue back in 2006 when by AEI definitions it first went into deficits, because while you can get some political mileage by attacking Boomers for not having enough regard for intergenerational equity there is not much payoff attacking people in wheelchairs or on oxygen or with pacemakers.</p>
<p>So if we are not willing to cut benefits to DI recipients or to make eligibility even harder to qualify for we are left with taxation. Per the Trustees the cost of a permanent fix for DI over the 75 year actuarial window was 0.24%. If we just wanted to fix it totally for the 25 year period to 2033 and partially after that we could reduce the initial fix down to 0.15% of payroll. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/IV_LRest.html#274087">Table IV.B4.—Components of Summarized Income Rates and Cost Rates, Calendar Years 2008-82[As a percentage of taxable payroll]</a>. Meaning that for a median income family with total wages of $50,000 would mean $120/year or $75/year respectively. Or we could look at this Table and conclude &#8216;Hell we still got $216 billion in credit with the Treasury, why not just draw on it rather than raise taxes even a little bit in this recession.&#8217;<br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SdPHahTL2kI/AAAAAAAAAIE/7xF4w5SKqLk/s1600-h/DI-Feb.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SdPHahTL2kI/AAAAAAAAAIE/7xF4w5SKqLk/s400/DI-Feb.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />So yes DI is kind of sick, and probably we should undertake some longer term cure, but we certainly can wait until we see how and if the economy recovers. But the last thing we should do is let people fundamentally hostile to Social Security to start with to rush us into an overhaul of the whole system because of a one-time blip in monthly numbers that itself is mostly the result of incomplete context.

<p>(Update 4/13: several commenters pointed out that this claim is in fact wrong: &#8220;In this Report CBO has introduced a new term of art called &#8216;Primary Surplus&#8217;.&#8221;  &#8216;Primary surplus&#8217; is not a new term of art at all, it is instead one of five measures of &#8216;Budget Surplus/Deficit&#8221; as described in Table one in this paper by Boskin <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/group/siepr/cgi-bin/siepr/?q=system/files/shared/pubs/papers/briefs/policybrief_nov04.pd">Sense and Nonsense About Federal Deficits and Debt </a>  (h/t MG) But I suggest this from that paper validates my overall point (bolding mine).<br />
<blockquote>Table 1  Alternative Budget Surplus/Deficit Concepts  <br />   1. Unified nominal surplus/deficit = nominal revenues – nominal outlays; “headline” numbers </p></blockquote>
<p> In normal reporting aimed at the public &#8216;surplus&#8217; is I maintain NOT normally understood to be &#8216;primary surplus&#8217; but instead as &#8216;nominal surplus/deficit&#8217;.)</p>
<p>Commenter Arne came through and supplied the link to the CBO document that showed the Social Security surplus &#8216;vanishing&#8217;. I supply it and the corresponding data tables from the 2008 Social Security Report. Preliminary discussion below the fold.

<p>First point. The &#8216;Surplus&#8217; as normally used by the CBO did not in fact vanish. It did indeed take a projected hit of $70-80 billion a year but after 2011 comes in at upwards of $150 billion a year. Second point. The &#8216;OAS Surplus&#8217; didn&#8217;t disappear either. It takes a major hit over the near term but then builds again right through 2019. Third Point. Now the &#8216;DI Surplus&#8217; DOES disappear and this year. But an examination of Table IV.A2 shows that the Trustees projected this to happen in 2012 anyway. Meaning that people who tell you that a deficit event scheduled for 2017 has moved up to February 2009 are simply using apples and oranges. Instead we had an event limited to DI move up from 2012  to 2009.</p>
<p>Fourth point. In this Report CBO has introduced a new term of art called &#8216;Primary Surplus&#8217;. Despite what the guys from AEI tell you this is NOT the standard usage of &#8216;Surplus&#8217;. Instead it corresponds to what is known as the &#8216;Cash Surplus&#8217; or by the SSA as &#8216;Income excluding interest&#8217;. This is an important bend point for the Treasury in that it marks the point when OAS or DI no longer are net lenders but instead require cash transfers from the General Fund. But it is only an important point to anyone else if they have discounted the value of the existing Trust Funds and interest thereon to zero. Fifth point. Even if we considered &#8216;Primary Surplus&#8217; to be the key its date of vanishment  doesn&#8217;t move up from 2019 to 2009, instead on a combined basis is moved from 2019 to 2018. And OAS doesn&#8217;t move up at all on an annual basis, instead &#8216;Primary Surplus&#8217; vanishes somewhat earlier in calender year 2019 than previously projected.</p>
<p>So if we add points one to five together we get to a point best summarized as &#8216;Liar, liar! Pants on fire!&#8221; It doesn&#8217;t surprise me that Hassett, Biggs, and Montgomery managed not to provide a link to the source, on examination it just doesn&#8217;t support the thrust of their articles and post.</p>
<p>Is this recession good news for Social Security overall? Of course not, high levels of unemployment directly choke off revenues in ways that are not totally offset by the savings from low to negative inflation rates (CBO projects $500 billion in cost savings due to lower COLAs going forward). Is it a reason for immediately capitulating to Hassetts demands for a Bi-Partisan Commission along the lines of the 1983 one? Hell no. In 1982 the DI Trust Fund had a balance of $2.7 billion and a Trust Fund ratio of 17 meaning 62 days of reserves. OAS had at that point in time had a balance of $22 billion and a Trust Fund ratio equating to 55 days of reserve. Today DI is sitting at just under two years of reserve and OAS just under four years, to assert that we are in equivalent position to that of 1983 is somewhere between absurd and outright dishonest.</p>
<p>The lesson is clear. Always check their numbers, particularly when they don&#8217;t actually provide them.</p>
<p>BTW the numbers do suggest we need to do something about DI. Where SSA had it going to depletion in 2025 in the 2008 Report CBO has now moved that date up to 2019. And the cost of the fix will no doubt be more than the 0.24% of payroll projected by the 2008 Report. But even if that rate doubled the cost of the needed fix would amount to $10 a month from take home pay for a household earning $50,000. Don&#8217;t listen to the Henny Pennys running around the halls of AEI (or the newsroom of the Washington Post), the sky just ain&#8217;t falling.</p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="http://andrewgbiggs.blogspot.com/2009/04/new-poll-ncpssm-americans-support.html">New poll: NCPSSM: Americans Support Protecting Social Security Benefits</a>. Andrew Biggs links us to good news for those supporters of Social Security who oppose addressing the problem through benefit cuts. He comments on this and rightly points out that the poll is expressly limited to Boomers and current retirees, but still issues a caution to the benefit cuts first crowd.<br />
<blockquote>The National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare released the results of a new poll of Baby Boomers and older Americans regarding the future of Social Security. While the results show greater concern for Social Security&#8217;s future than the National Committee generally projects – 14 percent say it is in crisis and an additional 49 percent say it has major problems, while the National Committee tends to downplay the problem – nevertheless the results regarding policy solutions appear favorable to the left.</p>
<p>The survey asked, &#8220;Which of these four ways to insure the future of Social Security would you be most in favor of?&#8221;</p>
<p>Raise the earnings cap on wages subject to payroll taxes: 31%<br />Expand funding sources to include federal income and estate taxes: 27%<br />Raise the retirement age: 14%<br />Reduce benefits for future retirees: 6%<br />Don&#8217;t know or refused: 22%<br />While I would have phrased the questions differently – I have seen polls showing that progressive benefit reductions rank higher than all policy options other than increasing the wage cap – and would have included younger respondents, who are most likely to be affected by Social Security reform, these results do pose a challenge to those who would wish to fix Social Security finances entirely on the benefit end.</p></blockquote>
<p>I have put my comment to Biggs&#8217; post below the fold, but first let me make some observations. First Boomers by and large are not buying into benefit cut based solutions. At least not before some combination of raising the cap or using income or estate tax revenue which in practice means taxing people in the top two quintiles (58% vs 20%). Given that for at least the next two decades this combination of Boomers and their elders are a very powerful political force simply by their propensity to vote this presents an uphill challenge to reformers, there still being some juice in the Third Rail of American Politics. Second I suspect they would have been more open to this in the mid 90&#8217;s when the date of projected Trust Fund Depletion was getting ever closer and ultimately back to 2029, which is the point of maximum Boomer impact on Social Security. Now that TF Depletion has moved to 2041 a combination of using a calender and a calculator and the mortality tables shows that on this topic for this demographic the Fierce Urgency of Now has dissipated.</p>
<p>More importantly that move from TF depletion in 2029 to 2041 equally changes the calender for Gen-X, benefit cut proposals that originated when their impact would fall on Boomers starting retirement are losing their force as the heaviest incidence starts falling on Gen-X instead.</p>
<p>Bruce to Andrew:<br />
<blockquote>Yes I think the challenge for reformers is that they view &#8216;crisis&#8217;  amongst themselves as one of sustainability which is largely defined as minimizing claims on the General Fund going forward. This builds in the somewhat silent assumption that the response to TF Depletion in 2041 will be demands that benefits be kept at the current schedule come what may. Which requires the premise that retirees at that time will have the political clout to make that happen.</p>
<p>This narrative made perfect sense in the early 90s when it appeared that Trust Fund depletion would coincide with the period of peak impact of Boomers on the system. That is under projections that TF depletion would come around 2029 Boomers would be aged from 65 to 83. At that point the mortality tables suggest that half of the oldest Boomers would still be alive and voting with that percentage going up as you moved down through the cohort. This dovetailed with a prevailing popular image of the Boomers being naturally selfish, the &#8216;Me Generation&#8217; (subject of a bazillion magazine cover stories) and an understanding that seniors tend to vote at higher rates. The combination of selfishness and voting demographics was thought to be powerful enough to just swamp the Gen-Xers push back. Moreover this basic narrative was supplemented by one that holds that taxes will have to be increased at the time of TF shortfall or programs slashed  to pay for Boomer Retirement only to see Social Security go &#8216;bankrupt&#8217; or &#8216;flat broke&#8217; at TF depletion which younger workers have translated into &#8216;No check for me&#8217;.</p>
<p>And this isn&#8217;t just theoretical. I have been blog commenting on this since there first were political blogs and the sense of resentment from younger workers is palpable, they really do believe they are going to get screwed two ways, paying extra taxes first and then getting nothing latter.</p>
<p>Under this scenario a reform proposal that included some immediate package of benefit cuts and tax increases that could be phased in in time to make the Selfish Boomers share the pain while making sure that some benefits would be in place for Gen-X made sense. If we were still sitting in 1994 watching the solvency of the TF erode in the way it was.</p>
<p>But by 2000 the calculus had changed considerably. Instead of the TF projecting to go to depletion at the point of maximum Boomer impact on Social Security and the ballot box it was now set for 2037 when Boomers would be aged 73 to 91. Moreover this meant that just about half of Gen-X would be eligible for benefits themselves. Under these circumstances a policy of starting phased in benefit cuts in 2009 largely gives Boomers a pass (it being accepted dogma among reformers that people in retirement or approaching it should not have their retirement options curtailed when they don&#8217;t have an opportunity to build up their PRAs in time) while guaranteeing that Gen-X gets their baseline benefit cut. In effect they are being asked to gore their own ox. And this became even more true as TF depletion pushed out from 2037 to 2041 over Bush&#8217;s first term.</p>
<p>Now given that crisis at TF depletion is really just a matter of taking a smaller benefit in 2042 than some of these Gen-X retirees were getting in 2040, and that <s>timing and needed cut</s> <i>the timing and size of the needed cut</i> being contingent of actual economic performance, it might not be as bad as expected, selling an across the board guaranteed cut in benefits offset by whatever gains you would get from your PRA (after clawback) naturally gets harder to sell.</p>
<p>After all for workers making under the median &#8216;crisis&#8217; is defined as a future benefit cut. Arguments that lifting the cap wouldn&#8217;t backfill the entire gap lose their power when those workers realize that the rest of the gap will require benefit cuts anyway. Nor are they likely to be moved by arguments that crisis should be measured not by TF balances but instead by the time transfers from the General Fund need to start. After all the General Fund is mostly funded by a tax that many of them (and particularly those with children) don&#8217;t have to pay to start with.</p>
<p>So yes indeed the &#8216;benefit end&#8217; only people really do have a challenge. They have been hemmed in by the calender calculus.</p></blockquote>
<p>To which I would add that this largely explains why the reformers are still trying to make the argument that now is the time to move on creating a bi-partisan commission. Because the calender continues to work against them. It has pretty been the consensus among reformers right since 1983 that it would be unfair to cut benefits for people in retirement or approaching it because those people simply don&#8217;t have time to replace that income via a new Personal Retirement Account system. Instead benefit cuts should be restricted to those eight or more years from full retirement age and even then phased in. For example a change in calculating initial benefits from real wage to price increase doesn&#8217;t effect anyone actually drawing benefits, their check being adjusted to prices already. Similarly a shift from shifting from CPI to some measure taking into account a lower price for the typical basket of goods for seniors has a very modest effect over the first decade or two but starts to bite deep as the decades go on. And by that time most Boomers will have shuffled off to Buffalo and points beyond (or up and down depending on your belief system).</p>
<p>Every year that reformers fail to sell their message that we have to start with benefit cuts is a year when Gen-X is being invited to shoot themselves in the foot while giving Boomers a pass. In 2009 if Social Security is left alone &#8216;crisis&#8217; will be defined as a cut in benefits in 2041. If we define Gen-X as the eighteen year cohort of people born 1965 to 1983 (and it doesn&#8217;t matter what we call them) we are talking about people currently aged 26 to 44 who will be 58 to 76 in 2041. Meaning that a phased in benefit cut now or an increase in retirement guarantees at least half of them being absolute losers in their first years of retirement. Whereas an increase in taxes via a cap increase or a cross the board payroll tax increase simply means that people making over the median and particularly people earning over the cap have to divert funds from other retirement options. And the calculus only gets tighter as the years go on. Reformers who think they can just bide their time until some hypothetical Republican electoral sweep in 2012 or 2016 need to check their calenders. Gen-Xers then being all that closer to that key date of being 50, a point when people realistically can estimate their retirement outcomes and more mindful of what a repeat of a 2008-2010 event would have on their retirement fund.</p>

<p>Articles this week by Kevin Hassett and Lori Montgomery sought to make the claim that deficits scheduled for 2017 had been moved up to today as a reason to immediately convene a bi-partisan Commission to Reform Social Security (with &#8216;bi-partisan&#8217; meaning dominated by Blue Dog Dems and Conservative Republicans). Well first of all Social Security surpluses don&#8217;t disappear in 2017, at least &#8216;surplus&#8217; as defined by CBO and second of all it really doesn&#8217;t matter that cash surpluses (Income excluding Interest) are projected to fall behind cost in that year. Understanding why requires some understanding of how Social Security manages the Trust Funds. The following shows assets in the OASI Trust Fund at year end 2006 and 2007 (the latest data available). Click on the image to get an enlarged version.<br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SdjQj4NL9rI/AAAAAAAAAJE/SDfH8ZDHgDw/s1600-h/OASDI.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SdjQj4NL9rI/AAAAAAAAAJE/SDfH8ZDHgDw/s400/OASDI.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />Discussion below the fold.</p>
<p>Generally when talking about Social Security we talk about THE Social Security Trust Fund having a current balance of $2.4 trillion and a shortfall date of 2017, a depletion date of 2041 and a payroll gap of 1.7%. And this includes the Trustees, most of the Tables in the Annual Reports talking about the OASDI Trust Fund. But in law and in actual operation there is no such thing as an OASDI Trust Fund, instead there is an OASI Trust Fund for the Old Age/Survivors Insurance program and a totally separate DI Trust Fund for the Disability Insurance program. Which means among other things that each Trust Fund has different dates for shortfall and depletion and different payroll gaps. Moreover they have different degrees of uncertainty, the range of outcomes for DI being much wider than that of OAS. Plus DI is much smaller being about 10% of the size of OAS. All of this has some implications for policy, which I will describe in a later post.  (In fact until I took a closer look at the following figure I didn&#8217;t realize how big those implications were.)<br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SdjW7gVkCkI/AAAAAAAAAJM/9FBvyBvicH8/s1600-h/OAS+and+DI+long+term+ratios.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SdjW7gVkCkI/AAAAAAAAAJM/9FBvyBvicH8/s400/OAS+and+DI+long+term+ratios.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />But for now I want to concentrate on the assets in and the interest on the OAS Trust Fund. The Trustees explain it like this.<br />
<blockquote>Another source of income to the trust funds is interest received on investments held by the trust funds. That portion of each trust fund which is not required to meet the current cost of benefits and administration is invested, on a daily basis, primarily in interest-bearing obligations of the U.S. Government (including special public-debt obligations described below). Investments may also be made in obligations guaranteed as to both principal and interest by the United States, including certain Federally sponsored agency obligations that are designated in the laws authorizing their issuance as lawful investments for fiduciary and trust funds under the control and authority of the United States or any officer of the United States. These obligations may be acquired on original issue at the issue price or by purchase of outstanding obligations at their market price. <br />The Social Security Act authorizes the issuance of special public-debt obligations for purchase exclusively by the trust funds. The Act provides that the interest rate on new special obligations will be the average market yield, as of the last business day of a month, on all of the outstanding marketable U.S. obligations that are due or callable more than 4 years in the future. The rate so calculated is rounded to the nearest one-eighth of one percent and applies to new issues in the following month. Beginning January 1999, in calculating the average market yield rate for this purpose, the Treasury incorporates the yield to the call date when a callable bond’s market price is above par.<br />Although the special issues cannot be bought or sold in the open market, <u>they are nonetheless redeemable at any time at par value and thus bear no risk of fluctuations in principal value due to changes in market yield rates</u>. Just as in the case of marketable Treasury securities held by the public, all of the investments held by the trust funds are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government.</p></blockquote>
<p>The first thing to note is that the Trust Fund is not a unitary account subject to the current interest rate. Instead it is a portfolio of specific certificates and bonds with specific rates and maturity dates.  As noted by the Trustees the bonds are not affected by current interest rates, the $27 billion in 2009  bonds yielding 7.25% are going to add $1.95 billion to the Trust Fund no matter what happens to rates this year. Meaning the total portfolio is going to add interest to the TF of around $110 billion. At year end the OAS Trust Fund will have a net increase in assets over the year, that  people don&#8217;t want to call that increase a &#8216;surplus&#8217; is their problem.</p>
<p>This doesn&#8217;t mean that the Trust Funds are immune to changes in current interest rates, the higher yields of the bonds maturing in 2009 will be replaced by new lower yielding ones, but this only effects a fraction of the portfolio. If we examine the Table we can see that the $290 billion in new issues in 2007 have yields of 5.0%. About a third of that represented by new issues due to interest, a third on rolling over maturing bonds earning less than 5.0% (though not by much) and a third rolling over maturing bonds earning more than 5.0%, the total effect was a near wash. The 2008 Report will likely see a bigger effect and the 2009 even more on projected balances but those $290 billion in 2007 issues will continue to yield 5% until their respective maturity dates.</p>
<p>Which leads us to 2017. Currently the dollar amounts of cash surpluses (tax revenue over total cost) are dropping even faster than projected and on the OAS side may be down by half or more. Which may move the date that those cash surpluses vanish up from 2017, but if OMB and CBO are right not by much, and in any case the total increase in assets that year will be more than $200 billion and probably pretty close to the $243 billion projected by CBO last August. Now under current projection none of this increase will be the result of excess contributions from FICA which will fall $24 billion below the amount needed to cover projected cost. All of it will be due to interest earned on the portfolio, which has led some to argue that the response of Congress will just be to punt the ball down the field by cutting benefits rather than having to cut spending or increase borrowing or taxes on the General Fund side. But this ignores the fact that there will be specific bond issues maturing in 2017 including $77.3 billion yielding 5.250%. Now some in Congress will take a lead from Hassett and AEI and claim that we shouldn&#8217;t count interest on the Trust Fund as real, but they are going to have a lot harder time saying the same thing about the maturing principal. Now not all of that $77.3 billion was the result of excess FICA taxes, up to half of it comprised of interest earned on the portfolio at the time of the issue of the bond. Meaning they are put in the position of issuing new Special Treasuries to roll over that $77.3 billion, insisting they are still fully backed by Full Faith and Credit while denying they have the cash to even pay down some of the maturing principal.</p>
<p>Sitting here in 2009 and thinking about the Trust Fund as a unified whole where 2017 marks the time you start drawing on interest and having exhausted that start drawing on principal in 2023 is to ignore the operational reality of the Trust Fund. In actual practice a portion of that principal comes to maturity every year and has to be either redeemed or rolled over. If we examine the right hand (2007) column we can see that every dash represents a bond issue that has been retired and replaced by a new Special Treasury, in doing so the Treasury has shown it still stands behind Full Faith and Credit. But the instant it refuses to recognize a valid claim for repayment of the portion of the bond that represents actual excess contributions they have effectively abrogated the entire Trust Fund. You can play fancy games with accrued interest and insist that it shouldn&#8217;t count, but you have a lot harder time doing that with maturing principal.</p>
<p>Only if you regard the Trust Fund as an undifferentiated lump where no principal payment is due until 2023 is it possible to sell the idea that the date that Income excluding Interest falling behind Total Cost is significant. But in practice we redeem some of the principal every year even now. Back in the late eighties there was hardly a suggestion that Shortfall was a significant date, main because Trust Fund depletion was reasonably close and coming closer. And Trust Fund depletion had real fall-out, it presented the direct tradeoff of either just taking a benefit cut or increasing taxes. And when and if we get fifteen years from projected depletion we will be able to make a good faith argument that something needs to be done, the looming benefit cut coming not from a failure to stand behind Full Faith and Credit, indeed the whole concept of Trust Fund Depletion assumes that Full Faith operates all the way down just as it did in the late seventies.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/VI_cyoper_history.html#159726">Table VI.A4.—Historical Operations of the Combined OASI and DI Trust Funds, Calendar Years 1957-2007 [Amounts in billions]</a>. In 1971 Social Security went to Shortfall as tax revenues fell below cost. Our response? We honored the interest and maintained full benefits. In 1975 Social Security hit &#8216;peak&#8217; as all accrued interest was needed to pay benefits and we were no longer able to just roll over the principal. Our response? We honored the remaining interest and the principal and maintained the necessary transfers from the General Fund needed to pay benefit. Plus we put in place the Carter 1977 Amendment which pushed the problem out by 50 years. Unfortunately it didn&#8217;t totally work and by 1982 Trust Fund depletion was imminent. Which led to the 1983 Reform which required a combination of tax increases and benefit cuts. But at no point did anyone suggest that somehow the interest and principal in the Trust Funds were not a real and binding obligation.</p>
<p>2017 doesn&#8217;t matter because the people who insist it does are making a dishonest argument that implicitly claims that Full Faith and Credit is something selective and elective, and that Congress can effectively wave it away by legislative action, and claim that a Supreme Court ruling that people don&#8217;t have ownership rights to the Trust Funds supports that. Well I don&#8217;t think that is what the Court really had in mind. That Congress is free to change the benefit schedule in response to Trust Fund balances dropping below acceptable ratios (i.e. current law sets a trigger at a TF ratio of 100) does not mean they are free to simply change it out of an attempt to avoid payment when that TF ratio is projected to be at 385 by effectively denying that legally owed interest falls under Full Faith and Credit. That claim may survive encounter with the Courts, but I don&#8217;t think it survives its encounter with the ballot box. I just don&#8217;t see &#8220;Yes you have $4.4 trillion in the bank, and yes it is earning interest, but no you are not allowed to actually draw on it&#8221; as a winning argument in the 2018 mid-terms.</p>
<p>Basically AEI is hoping to pull a fast one before anyone notices what their plan actually does. </p>

<p>What is now the top line is total government debt.

<p>*The Greenspan Commission was clear on this, requiring that, as of 1993, the President&#8217;s Budget Proposal note both the real (i.e., ex-SocSec overpayment) deficit as well as the nominal one, precisely <em>because</em> they did not want the system to be gamed.</p>

<p>As Krugman would say: Wonkish. Last Wednesday I put up a post <a target="_blank" href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/04/new-tactics-in-old-war-vanishing-social.html">Vanishing the Social Security Surplus</a> which got some push back in comments by Andrew Biggs. So let me back up a little.</p>
<p>Social Security surplus is defined in two ways. One is &#8216;Income less Interest &#8211; Cost&#8217;. The other is more simply &#8216;Income &#8211; Cost&#8217;. I would argue that the standard definition is the latter and would support it two ways. First the Social Security Trustees implicitly define it as the second, for example we could examine Table Vi.C6 from the 2008 Report.<br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SdcFlv3w14I/AAAAAAAAAIM/o7zUtbpN2y4/s1600-h/2008-Table-VI.C6.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SdcFlv3w14I/AAAAAAAAAIM/o7zUtbpN2y4/s400/2008-Table-VI.C6.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />Note that there is no column corresponding to &#8216;Income less Interest &#8211; Cost&#8217;, you have to derive it. On the other hand there is a column equating to &#8216;Income &#8211; Cost&#8217; which is labeled &#8216;Net increase during the Year&#8217;. Now the Trustees don&#8217;t label this as &#8216;Surplus&#8217; but there is little doubt that most people think of it as such, generally the current Trust Fund balance of $2.4 trillion is thought of as an accumulation of &#8216;surpluses&#8217;. Indeed a lot of people on both sides of the debate insist that the government &#8216;borrowed&#8217; (or alternatively &#8216;stole&#8217; &#8216;spent&#8217; &#8216;diverted&#8217;) all of the Trust Fund balance to other uses over the years. As we will see this is not right but back to the point.</p>
<p>It is perfectly clear that CBO is not so reticent. They clearly equate Income &#8211; Cost as equalling &#8216;Surplus&#8217;. For example in their August 2008 Report <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/89xx/doc8917/01-23-2008_BudgetOutlook.pdf">The Budget and Economic Outlook: Fiscal Years 2008 to 2018</a> they put it as follows: <br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SdcM1ScoNWI/AAAAAAAAAIU/W4NGC0FgB5E/s1600-h/CBO-Aug-2008-Table-1.1.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SdcM1ScoNWI/AAAAAAAAAIU/W4NGC0FgB5E/s400/CBO-Aug-2008-Table-1.1.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />So total Unified Budget surplus/deficit is defined as the combination of on-budget surplus/deficit and off-budget surplus/deficit. And for all practical purposes  off-budget surplus equates to Social Security surplus. Meaning  there is a practical equation between &#8216;off-budget surplus&#8217; and &#8216;social security surplus&#8217; and &#8216;net increase during the year&#8217; and &#8216;income (including interest) &#8211; cost&#8217;. For budgeting purposes they are all the same.  And an examination of SSA&#8217;s Table  VI.C6 shows that by 2017 all of that surplus is comprised of interest on the Trust Fund.</p>
<p>Now in an article on Tuesday in the WaPo by Lori Montgomery titled called <a target="_blank" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/30/AR2009033003291.html">Recession Puts a Major Strain On Social Security Trust Fund</a> we get the following claim:<br />
<blockquote>Last August, the CBO predicted that surplus would exceed $80 billion this year and next, then rise to around $90 billion before slowly evaporating by 2020. But the rapidly deteriorating economy &#8212; particularly the loss of more than 4 million jobs &#8212; has driven those numbers much lower much faster, with the surplus expected to hit $16 billion this year and only $3 billion next year, then vanish entirely by 2017.</p></blockquote>
<p>Huh? CBO in August 2008 predicted a Socials Security surplus in 2009 of  $199 billion and in 2010 of $210 billion. And far from evaporating by 2020 showed a surplus of $253 billion in 2017.  SSA has somewhat lower numbers or 2017 at $213 billion and $169 billion by 2020 (Table VI.F8). How do we get from there to $80 billion for 2009 and &#8216;evaporating by 2020&#8217;? Answer is below the fold.<br />(Update. Coberly found the main cause of the problem. Like all 10-year Treasuries interest on the vast bulk of the Trust Fund that is invested in Special Treasuries is payable twice a year in June and December. So the actual monthly Fund Balance Sheet for any other month won&#8217;t show it since it is not yet actually in the Trust Fund, while on the overall SS Balance Sheet it shows up as a receivable and hence as an asset.)</p>
<p>Simple, you just take definition number one for &#8216;surplus&#8217; which is &#8216;income excluding interest &#8211; cost&#8217; and abandon the standard CBO definition of &#8216;income including interest&#8217;. In effect you just assume that the interest on the Trust Fund is just not real, which in turn requires assuming that the principal in the Trust Fund is not a real interest earning obligation of the United States government.</p>
<p>Note that there is no hint in the Montgomery&#8217;s piece that she is using a different definition of &#8216;surplus&#8217; than that in CBO&#8217;s Table 1-1. Plus in order to find the distinction she is stating here you have to go deep into the Report.<br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SdcgAOOJuYI/AAAAAAAAAIc/vqL4cy-KBUA/s1600-h/CBO-Aug-SS-Surpluses.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SdcgAOOJuYI/AAAAAAAAAIc/vqL4cy-KBUA/s400/CBO-Aug-SS-Surpluses.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />Given that this is page 121 and the usual standards of the WaPo you don&#8217;t have to be a genius to tell that this is the product of some feeding of Steno Lori by the usual suspects, in this case from AEI.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s have a subtotal. Using the standard definition of &#8216;surplus&#8217; as used by CBO and SSA, that is &#8216;total income excluding cost&#8217; it is clear that it didn&#8217;t vanish in February, the roughly $2.4 trillion TF balance earning interest at a nominal rate of 5.0% was returning around $120 billion which for a short month like February means something like $8 billion. From that accrued interest we would have to subtract any gap between revenue from taxation and cost for the month, amounts that are supplied by Andrew Biggs in his post <a target="_blank" href="http://andrewgbiggs.blogspot.com/2009/03/slowdown-slashes-social-security.html">Slowdown Slashes Social Security Surplus</a>. Biggs introduces us to a new tool from Social Security&#8217;s office of the Chief Actuary which gives us results by month <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/ProgData/allOps.html">Financial Data for a Selected Time Period</a>. If we punch in Feb 2009 we see OAS with a surplus of $525 million and Di with a deficit of $1.779 billion for a combined deficit of $1.255 billion hence &#8216;vanished surplus&#8217;. Now this number is basically legit in that if you go to the Treasury&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/tfmp/tfmp.htm">Monthly Trust Fund Report</a> and select the OAS January version you find the following results on page 3.<br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SdcrVQQU_GI/AAAAAAAAAIs/geMTwD5qPhc/s1600-h/Jan09-OAS+Balance.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SdcrVQQU_GI/AAAAAAAAAIs/geMTwD5qPhc/s400/Jan09-OAS+Balance.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />And similarly the February<br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SdcrVC_fCVI/AAAAAAAAAIk/0dsi-TEaHX8/s1600-h/Feb09-OAS+balance.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SdcrVC_fCVI/AAAAAAAAAIk/0dsi-TEaHX8/s400/Feb09-OAS+balance.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />So the number is legit, we have a TF balance for OAS up from $2,219.314 billion to $2,219.964 billion which is close enough to $525 million not to matter in context. But what are we to make of this?<br />January 2009<br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/Sdcv-_k958I/AAAAAAAAAI0/rfAod9kV8Yg/s1600-h/Jan09-Interest.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/Sdcv-_k958I/AAAAAAAAAI0/rfAod9kV8Yg/s400/Jan09-Interest.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />February 2009<br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/Sdcv_E9AbCI/AAAAAAAAAI8/7K9XU3Z5gXM/s1600-h/Feb09-Interest.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/Sdcv_E9AbCI/AAAAAAAAAI8/7K9XU3Z5gXM/s400/Feb09-Interest.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />In January the Trust Fund earned $20 million in interest for a total yearly total of $52.978 billion.<br />In February the Trust Fund earned $75 million in interest for a total yearly total of $53.053 billion<br />But we are talking a $2.2 trillion dollar Trust Fund at a nominal 5%, shouldn&#8217;t interest be more like $9 billion a month? Well yes it should. So lets take a look at page five from the same Reports.<br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SdPHaSpDOhI/AAAAAAAAAHs/_AeGGxs5dUs/s1600-h/OAS-Jan.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SdPHaSpDOhI/AAAAAAAAAHs/_AeGGxs5dUs/s400/OAS-Jan.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SdPHaVRwmGI/AAAAAAAAAH0/cZEddTniJBw/s1600-h/OAS-Feb.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SdPHaVRwmGI/AAAAAAAAAH0/cZEddTniJBw/s400/OAS-Feb.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />Whoah! January assets that totalled $2.193 trillion and moved up to February assets of $2.196 trillion on page 3 transform to assets totaling $2.228 for January on page 5 and $2.237 trillion for February. Somehow the approximately $525 million February  surplus for OAS cited by Biggs, admittedly based on totally official information from the Treasury, transforms to a $9 billion surplus between between page 3 and 5 of the same report. And if we repeated the exercise for DI we would see a deficit transform from $1.7 billion to $900 million.</p>
<p>Why the difference? Well it turns on a category called &#8220;Interest Receivable&#8221;. For whatever reason interest accrued on the Trust Fund in January and February of this year was not counted as an asset on page 3 of the monthly TF Report from Treasury or on the Web application of the Office of the Actuary. On the other hand it was so credited on page 5 of the monthly TF Report. Maybe someone with actual accounting skills can explain why we should claim with Biggs, Hassett and Montgomery why Social Security surpluses vanished in February even as assets increased by a net $8 billion dollars. To me that can only be done by claiming that the Trust Funds don&#8217;t really exist and that all excess contributions since 1983 and interest on them should be discounted to zero.</p>
<p>In other words &#8216;sorry suckers! we got the money and we are not paying it back!&#8217;.</p>
<p>(There are a lot of numbers here, if I have missed something please correct me in comments.)</p>

<p>Well the Republican Party and economic conservatives generally have made their position clear, they are openly using the current meltdown as an opportunity to kill Medicare and Social Security as they exist today. We saw this at the Stimulus Summit where the very first question by the Republicans, coming from Senate Minority Leader McConnell, was to ask Obama if he would commit to supporting the Conrad-Gregg plan for Social Security, a plan that starts from the position of crisis and only asks what kind of reform it needs (and if you guessed a combination of benefit cuts and a transition to PRAs you probably hit the mark). And in releasing the Republican counter-budget Ranking Member Ryan made eliminating Medicare for workers currently under the age of 55 in favor of an array of private insurance options a central part of the plan. I&#8217;ll leave the Medicare issue for Ezra and  the people at TPM <a target="_blank" href="http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2009/04/republicans-lets-privatize-medicare.php">Republicans: Let&#8217;s Privatize Medicare!</a> and focus on Social Security</p>
<p>It is no secret that Republican&#8217;s opposed the creation of Social Security in 1935 and the array of social programs established by the Great Society in 1964-65. Not only do many of them believe that Social Insurance is not a proper function of government, many believe it is unconstitutional, and some agree with Milton Friedman that such programs are immoral and a danger to freedom itself. But they also recognize that these programs are widely popular, attacking them directly having traditionally been seen as certain political death, Social Security and Medicare being seen as the Third Rail of American Politics.</p>
<p>The funding crisis that faced Social Security in the late seventies was seen by these people as their great opportunity. But they recognized that they couldn&#8217;t just shut down Social Security overnight they needed to supply a replacement mechanism and a transition plan. And so was born the IRA, the Individual Retirement Account and the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.socialsecurity.org/pubs/ssps/ssp8.html">Ferrara Plan</a>. (This version is from 1997 but the plan itself dates back to before 1983.) They missed their chance in 1983, and the bitterness is palpable, for example Butler and Germanis called it a &#8216;fiasco&#8217;. So they retooled and moved on adding other plans to the Ferrara Plan, all however having as a central element the ultimate elimination of Social Security in favor of Personal Retirement Accounts. The problem is that all plans share the same three challenges: first how do you finance the transition for older workers who do not have time to build a private retirement plan, second how do you provide an equivalent return for workers making under the median, and three how do you do all that at a cheaper cost than just fixing Social Security via a payroll tax increase of less than 2%?</p>
<p>Answer is below the fold.</p>
<p>Umm, well it turns out that you can&#8217;t meet all three challenges at the same time. The various plans tackle this problem in different ways but even after their changes in benefits by changing the indexing they end up with results as seen here.<br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/Sbf30JpcGYI/AAAAAAAAAG4/P13L3Ec682I/s1600-h/LMS_Table+2.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/Sbf30JpcGYI/AAAAAAAAAG4/P13L3Ec682I/s400/LMS_Table+2.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a> This table is from the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hks.harvard.edu/jeffreyliebman/lms_nonpartisan_plan_description.pdf">LMS Plan</a>. In each case you end up with substantial transfers from the General Fund, in some cases exceeding those needed to finance scheduled benefits in the system as designed. And remember this is after changing the benefit formula. That is if we examine LMS we see that while it proposes the least amount of transfer it also produces poorer results for lower income workers. When LMS was scored the payroll gap under traditional Social Security was 1.92%, in other words an immediate increase in FICA would have  been projected to deliver 100% of the scheduled benefits over the 75 year window. Whereas LMS proposed a package of tax increases and benefit cuts for workers under the cap of 4.2% with the following projected result.<br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/Sbf30exknaI/AAAAAAAAAHA/uWUVvI1Y_w4/s1600-h/LMS_Table1.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/Sbf30exknaI/AAAAAAAAAHA/uWUVvI1Y_w4/s400/LMS_Table1.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />The authors of LMS recognized the problem of selling a 4.2% solution to a problem scored at 1.92% that produced worse results for many lower earners and tried to mitigate the problem some.<br />
<blockquote>However, all three of us support the use of progressive matches to augment the personal accounts of low-income workers as long as a funding mechanism for the matches is identified.  Thus, we would support, for example, integrating a paid-for Saver’s Credit with Social Security PRAs so that low-earners would have their PRA contributions matched by the government.  We did not incorporate such a provision in our plan because changes to tax policy outside of Social Security are beyond the scope of our proposal.</p></blockquote>
<p>. Which translates to even higher transfers from the General Fund. And while it may not be charitable my suspicion is that they didn&#8217;t include such a proposal because they didn&#8217;t like how it scored.</p>
<p>So how do you sell a crappier result at a higher price? Particularly when your Party is out of power? You seize on every opportunity to claim that the current system is ultimately unsustainable and will have to be replaced by something, anything. Moreover since that will require sacrifices by everyone it is important that the plan be bi-partisan, which in practice is meant a compromise on ground pre-established by the Blue Dogs and the Republicans. Hence the demand by McConnell (with implicit threat of withholding support for Obama&#8217;s stimulus and budget plans, which of course they did anyway) that Obama embrace Conrad-Gregg. Which in practice means embracing some combination of benefit cuts and PRAs.</p>
<p>What is fatal to such a sales campaign is the prospect that people will listen to Coberly who will helpfully point out you can get a 100% result with less than 2% of payroll (or 1.06% per CBO&#8217;s August estimate) or that they will listen to Rosser/Webb who point out that economic growth needed to fully fund Social Security as is is not that high by historical standards and moreover would need to be at those levels to fund PRAs anyway. That is you need to keep people from looking at the numbers or at least undermine people&#8217;s faith in them.</p>
<p>Which explains the assault launched last week by Biggs, and this week by his colleague  Hassett with an assist from the WaPo. What do you do when people are hearing rumors that Social Security is fully funded until 2041 or 2049? Well you simply change the definition of what &#8216;funded&#8217; and &#8216;surplus&#8217; mean, and point out that using a particular version of a data set that February one-month numbers failed to meet your new test, imply that that will continue to be true forever and suggest that the only solution is to sign on in advance to a plan prepared by a bi-partisan group. Hence Hassett this week <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601039&#038;refer=columnist_hassett&#038;sid=asbiybVqsYC0">Recession Bites Into Social Security’s Surplus</a><br />
<blockquote>We have all been so busy whining about bonuses at American International Group Inc. and arguing about the so-called card- check legislation that we forgot to watch the Social Security surplus. While we were looking away, that surplus disappeared, eight years ahead of schedule.</p></blockquote>
<p>And what is to be done about this new, recession caused crisis?<br />
<blockquote>That means benefits payments will be under more stress than they have been in modern times. To the extent that the federal government continues to pump money into assorted bailouts and rescues, it will undermine its ability to support a retirement program that is now a drag on the overall picture.</p>
<p>The only responsible course is to do what reformers have been advocating for at least a decade, a step that worked in 1983: Establish a bipartisan commission to recommend fixes to Social Security, and implement them now. The myth that we can postpone reform because everything is just fine has been exposed as such. The time to act is now.</p></blockquote>
<p>If this sounds familiar to the language deployed in creating the President&#8217;s Commission in 2001 or Bush launching his actual assault on Social Security in November 2004 it is not an accident. Because Cato and people and organizations aligned with it have always had the same goal in good times and bad, in 1983, in 2001, in 2004 and now in 2009 they insist that the only answer is to transition Social Security to a system based on Private Retirement Accounts. In fact the original title of Cato&#8217;s program makes that abundantly clear, it was called the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cato.org/research/ss_prjct.html">PROJECT ON SOCIAL SECURITY PRIVATIZATION</a>. That was a little too open so they changed it to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.socialsecurity.org/">Project on Social Security Choice</a> but don&#8217;t be fooled, they are working backwards from their preferred solution.</p>
<p>These people wished that Social Security and Medicare had been strangled in their respective cradles, now that they are mature they want to weaken them progressively until they can be drowned in Grover Norquist&#8217;s bathtub. None of this is about improving retirement security, all of their plans start with guaranteed benefit cuts that in some cases exceed those of allowing Social Security to go to depletion, and many of them come at a higher cost to workers than just fixing the current system via payroll tax. No it is all about pissing on FDR&#8217;s grave and preventing Social Security from becoming the template for achieving universal health coverage. The people at Cato are committed to blocking any expansion of government that might increase transfers from the wealthy down the income scale, regardless of the overall social utility. Arguments that most European health care systems deliver better outcomes to more people at a lower cost leaves them cold, if it means higher taxes on the real upper income folk then no deal. On the other hand they have no objections to an LMS plan that increases taxes on people making up to the 90% income level (but no higher) while delivering crappier benefits to current and future generations of workers. So it really isn&#8217;t about overall tax levels or intergenerational equity, like everything else on the agenda of the economic right it all ultimately boils down to taxes on the wealthy and/or reversing the legacy of &#8216;class traitor&#8217; FDR.</p>
<p>Everytime you see someone from Cato or AEI argue that &#8216;The time to act is now&#8217; (as Hassett does) understand that the unstated sub-text is &#8216;before we lose this opportunity to set Social Security on a path to privatization&#8217;. The goal never changes, only the circumstances in which they have to operate.</p>

                                <p>by Bruce Webb</p>
<p>A new front was opened Monday in the war on Social Security. The first shot came from Kevin Hassett of AEI who wrote a piece for Bloomberg <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601039&#038;refer=columnist_hassett&#038;sid=asbiybVqsYC0">Recession Bites Into Social Security’s Surplus</a><br />
<blockquote>We have all been so busy whining about bonuses at American International Group Inc. and arguing about the so-called card- check legislation that we forgot to watch the Social Security surplus. While we were looking away, that surplus disappeared, eight years ahead of schedule.</p></blockquote>
<p>This was immediately picked up by the Washington Post stenographers in a piece from Lori Montgomery on Tuesday <a target="_blank" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/30/AR2009033003291.html">Recession Puts a Major Strain On Social Security Trust Fund: As Payroll Tax Revenue Falls, So Does Surplus</a><br />
<blockquote>With unemployment rising, the payroll tax revenue that finances Social Security benefits for nearly 51 million retirees and other recipients is falling, according to a report from the Congressional Budget Office. As a result, the trust fund&#8217;s annual surplus is forecast to all but vanish next year &#8212; nearly a decade ahead of schedule &#8212; and deprive the government of billions of dollars it had been counting on to help balance the nation&#8217;s books.</p></blockquote>
<p>If true this would be a totally &#8216;Holy Crap Batman!&#8217; moment, because per the 2008 Report Social Security ran a positive balance of $190 billion in 2007, was projected to run a $196 billion positive balance in 2008 and $212 billion in 2009 <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/IV_SRest.html#253691">Table IV.A3.—Operations of the Combined OASI and DI Trust Funds, Calendar Years 2003-17</a>. In fact it was still projected to be adding assets to the tune of $213 billion in 2017. How could all of that just vanish without anyone noticing?</p>
<p>Answer? It didn&#8217;t. Hassett is mostly just playing word games. If we back up and examine the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/VI_cyoper_history.html#159726">Historical Operations of the Combined OASI and DI Trust Funds, Calendar Years 1957-2007</a> we can see combined balances in the Trust Funds at the end of 1993 of  $378 billion dollars with a Trust Fund ratio of 107, which is to say just over one year of reserves. In the years since that balance has grown to $2.4 trillion and a TF ratio above 350. The increase in the fund balance is normally called the &#8216;Social Security surplus&#8217; and is scored as such when calculating the Unified Budget deficit or surplus. But in point of fact Social Security does not extract the full amount of the fund increase from the current year economy, a big part of the annual surplus is from accrued interest on the Trust Fund which in 2003 accounted for more than half of that surplus and the percentage is increasing all the time. So if we examine Table IV.B3 and look at the projections for 2017 we can see that of a total fund increase of $213 billion that $238 billion is the result of interest. Or in other words the amount of dollars extracted from the economy via FICA payroll tax and tax on benefits will be $25 billion less than is needed to pay then current benefits, an amount that will have to be made up by a PARTIAL payment of interest due on the Trust Fund.</p>
<p>Hassett has simply redefined this long known crossover point (known as Shortfall) as the time that &#8216;surpluses&#8217; vanish. And then piles on by claiming that February numbers show that it had actually moved right up to today. This is totally misleading and verging on outright lying. To see why follow me below the fold.</p>
<p>While commenters and the Trustees alike for most purposes treat the Trust Funds as a combined whole there are legally two different funds, OASI (Old Age/Survivors Insurance) and DI (Disability Insurance). DI is approximately 10% of the size of OAS and has in recent years been much the weaker of the two. While the combined funds are projected to reach Shortfall in 2017 when DI is examined in isolation we can see that it actually hit Shortfall in 2005. From that point on the difference between cost and income excluding interest has been made up by tapping the interest on the DI Trust Fund. Even before the current downturn DI cost was projected to run ahead of total income including interest in 2012. As it turns out that event happened sometime between June and August of 2008. In June the DI Trust Fund was sitting at $220 billion which was actually ahead of Intermediate Cost&#8217;s year end projection and close to that of Low Cost&#8217;s year-end of $221 billion. By August it had actually dropped to $219 billion and has continued to sink from there until in February it had fallen to $214 billion down a pretty shocking $1.8 billion for the month. Which led Andrew Biggs to post the numbers under the title <a target="_blank" href="http://andrewgbiggs.blogspot.com/2009/03/slowdown-slashes-social-security.html">Slowdown Slashes Social Security Surplus</a>. In fact the DI deficit overwhelmed the $525 million OAS surplus for the month to create a combined OASDI deficit of $1.25 billion and so leading Hassett and his faithful stenographer Montgomery to claim the sky was falling.</p>
<p>This is nonsense, they are simply counting on readers to not know these numbers or the breakdown of them between OAS and DI or how DI actually interacts with OAS. Certainly neither makes any effort to actually supply the numbers or the context, in fact Hassett who links to just about everything he references somehow manages to not link the the CBO and Social Security documents he is drawing from. So I guess it is up to me to supply that context.</p>
<p>There are plenty of people who would qualify for DI who remain in the workforce. Some just like their jobs, others make more income than their DI check would yield, and most of them are interested in boosting their ultimate OAS check. Because DI is not permanent, at full retirement age recipients are shifted over to OAS. This gives people who would qualify for DI an incentive to continuing working and making contributions to OAS. Until of course they lose their job and are faced with the choice of say trying to find new work as a wheelchair bound person over the age of 55 or taking DI as a form of early-early retirement. Well it looks like a large number of workers are letting their feet or perhaps their wheels do the talking. The result is a big yet temporary hit on the DI Trust Fund (temporary because I think we can readily assume that most of these people are approaching retirement years and will soon transition out of DI anyway). Moreover this hit on DI is offset somewhat by them probably getting a reduced check under OAS than if they had managed to stay in the work force. (And BTW that is also true for that group of workers who are old enough for early retirement, certainly if I were unemployed and 62 I would be filing (because you can always go back in the workforce and qualify for higher permanent benefits by paying back early retirement ones-and IIRC interest free)). Making the following statement from Hassett simply wrong.<br />
<blockquote>Permanent Changes</p>
<p>Second, many individuals who retire early or go on disability in this crisis may not return to the workforce once the recession ends, so the higher payments are probably with us forever.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hmm no, the hit to DI is temporary while the hit from increased levels of early retirement is offset actuarially by a lower permanent retirement check. Plus the followup is wrong as well.<br />
<blockquote>Finally, Social Security just increased everyone’s benefits by 5.8 percent to cover the increase in the cost of living last year, the biggest increase since 1982. That adjustment jacks up benefits payments permanently.</p></blockquote>
<p> Uh Kevin, a prolonged period of low inflation or deflation lowers benefits permanently compared the the baseline projection, that knife cuts both ways.</p>
<p>DI has long been in actuarial trouble per Intermediate Cost projections. As it turns out it was actually outperforming those projections by running bigger surpluses than anticipated in 2006, 2007 and the first half of 2008. But even with that it was pretty clear that something would need to be done for DI in the relative short run, the 2008 Report projected DI Trust Fund depletion for 2025 or sixteen years ahead of the combined depletion date of 2041. DI TF depletion may well move up some as a result of this downturn, and the longer and more severe the recession gets the more effect we can expect to see. But a potential crisis in DI is still not a reason to tamper with OAS. What we have here is just another use of crisis conflation, just as a real challenge to Medicare and Medicaid is used to sell &#8216;Entitlements Crisis&#8217; so is a problem with DI turned into a crisis for Social Security as a whole. These guys want to kill traditional Social Security and always have.</p>
<p>OASDI cash surpluses were already dropping but the overall surplus is continuing to rise and in fact will continue to do so even after cash transfers from the General Fund start redeeming part of the interest. Only when those transfers exceed the total amount of interest owed and principal starts being paid down can Social Security even plausibly be said to be in deficit. And even that is a little odd considering at that point the Trust Funds are projected to have a combined $5.7 trillion in assets. Though he won&#8217;t come out and say it Hassett&#8217;s argument implicitly denies that workers have a valid claim on the interest and principal in the Trust Funds, his talk of &#8216;vanishing surpluses&#8217; is just a gambit in an effort to abrogate the trillions of dollars in excess contributions plus legally accrued interest that is still adding to the balances in the combined Trust Funds.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t fall for this bait and switch attempt to steal our money. Social Security will still run a surplus in 2009 from the $110 billion in interest owed on the current balance plus the probably small OAS surplus. Fixing DI is something we could do but even if it runs deficits at February&#8217;s level it still has about ten years of available balances, there really is now rush. If we did decide to fix it we are faced with an long term actuarial gap projected at 0.24% of payroll in the 2008 Report, which translates to  $120/year for a median household earning $50,000. Hassett is just trying to make a mountain out of a mole hill.</p>

<p>What special holiday falls on March 31st? Yep is is Social Security Report Release Day. Now as I type it turns out that the Social Security Bunny (aka  Commissioner Michael Astrue) has not actually delivered his special SS Egg, and gosh who knows, given that we are still in transition from the old Administration and that three of six Trustees&#8217; spots are vacant SSRR Day may come late this year. </p>
<p>But just in case it comes today you can get your own copy from the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/index.html">Reports of the Trustees</a> website in either PDF or in paper via paid first class mail. Plus there is an HTML version to which (if file name conventions stay the same) I have linked from my blog <a target="_blank" href="http://bruceweb.blogspot.com/2009/03/2009-report-due-march-31st.html">2009 Report: Due March 31st</a></p>
<p>Update 2: A commenter reports that the release is probably going to come in mid-May. Which seems reasonable and hopefully will allow some adjustments for the bruising data that came in Q4 of last year and Q1 of this one and so get us a better data set. So I have moved the rest of this post below the fold.</p>
<p>The Report has been released as late as May 1st (that was mostly a matter of the Bush Administration trying to pressure the Senate into reconfirming the two Public Trustees for an unusual (maybe unprecedented) 2nd five year term in an apparent effort to keep privatization alive through the next President&#8217;s first term), but generally it is released without fanfare some time during the course of the day on March 31st.</p>
<p>The contents of the SSRR Day Basket may not be as yummy as those of the typical Easter Basket, if fact they are kind of dry. But I find them pretty tasty. Try it, you might like it.</p>
<p>If it comes before noon PST I&#8217;ll update this with numbers.</p>
<p>Update: there seems to be some advanced push back. Today the WaPo published this from Lori Montgomery <a target="_blank" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/30/AR2009033003291.html">Recession Puts a Major Strain On Social Security Trust Fund: As Payroll Tax Revenue Falls, So Does Surplus</a> which is just a rehash of a piece by Kevin Hassett of AEI for Bloomberg yesterday <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601039&#038;refer=columnist_hassett&#038;sid=asbiybVqsYC0">Recession Bites Into Social Security’s Surplus</a>. What they are doing is using a special definition of &#8216;surplus&#8217;. When Social Security surpluses are reported for Unified Budget purposes they include both any cash surplus from taxation plus interest earned on the Trust Fund. That is why people say Social Security was running $200 billion a year surpluses over the last few years. Hassett here is just using cash surpluses and moreover ignoring the fact that almost all the damage is a temporary hit on the DI Trust Fund. And the WaPo as always is just picking up the talking points and pushing them to the broader audience.</p>
<p>Dean Baker will not be pleased. He hasn&#8217;t posted at Beat the Press yet today, but I suspect Ms. Montgomery is in for a drubbing when he does.</p>

<p>Social Security is typically discussed in static terms, that is it &#8216;will&#8217; or &#8216;is projected&#8217; to get to this state or that at some fixed point in the future. This I think is an artifact of &#8216;crisis&#8217; being seen as the result of a known fixed event, namely Boomer Retirement.  And it is certainly true that what was until recently the largest demographic cohort in American history is scheduled to retire between now and 2031. That is we know the wave is going to crash the only question is how rough the surf is going to be when it does.</p>
<p>It is this sense of inevitability derived from a fixed or static event that has led us to decision making drawn from &#8216;will&#8217; rather than &#8216;if&#8217;. But in actuality Social Security is not fixed in stasis by the demographics, it is instead a dynamic system on any number of axes and should be studied as such in our search for proper policy choices.</p>
<p>One dynamic axis is that of Report time, in that the projected outcomes vary from Report year to Report year. If the crisis was really a static one fixed in place by the demographics you would expect that any year of inaction would make the ultimate gap between cost and income that much harder to fill and/or make the onset of the gap be sooner than projected. This is turn would lead naturally to assertions like &#8216;sooner is better than later&#8217; and &#8216;the longer we wait the greater the shock treatment needed&#8217;. And indeed this was the actual outcome of Report Years 1993 to 1996, Trust Fund depletion came ever closer in time and the cost of the fix needed continued to rise. But a funny thing happened starting in 1997, the arrow reversed and TF depletion started retreating back in time and the cost of an immediate fix started to shrink. Suddenly what had been a crisis fixed by demography became a dynamic system. Which should have changed the analytical question from &#8216;what should we do&#8217; to &#8216;why is it moving the way it does&#8217; and more importantly &#8216;can this go on&#8217;.</p>
<p>That analytical shift never seemed to happen, to the extent that anyone even noticed the reversal it tended to be seen just as variation around the known result of Boomer Retirement, because whatever the numbers showed Boomers were not getting any younger. But for those who chose to ask the &#8216;why&#8217; and &#8216;can&#8217; question the result was kind of stunning. Social Security was not static at all, its outlook changed depending on particular projections that varied dynamically not only within each Report but between them. 1997&#8217;s Intermediate Cost alternative was not necessarily identical to 2000&#8217;s  which in turn were not those of 2004. Once you break through the idea that you are fundamentally facing a static crisis fixed by the demography you end up open to some new analytical avenues.</p>
<p>One is just to examine the various projections in sequence, what caused the 1998 result to be so much better than the 1997, why did you get the deterioration between 2005 and 2006 Reports and the improvement between the 2007 and 2008? Are these movements just variations around a trend line firmly aimed at crisis or is the trend line pointing somewhere else? And the answers to these questions show that the SSA&#8217;s Office of the Chief Actuary is wrestling with a live system where the inputs never quite come in exactly as expected and the assumptions remain open for modification. For example there was a change in projected depletion date from 2034 to 2037 between the 1999 and 2000 Reports with a corresponding drop in cost of an immediate fix from 2.02% of payroll to 1.92%. On inspection the cause of this dramatic change was a big change in input from actual 1999 economic performance, future numbers were if anything moved in a more pessimistic direction. Which is to say that 10% of &#8216;Crisis&#8217; simply vanished and I might add never really came back. Further dynamic movements in inputs and assumptions have moved that date to 2041 and the payroll gap down to 1.7%. (And we can expect the marked slump in receipts first visible in early Fall to move those numbers at least slightly the other way).</p>
<p>More analysis of the dynamic (if not dynamic analysis) below the fold.</p>
<p>Once you break free of the stasis you are free to examine the dynamics of Social Security from several perspectives. One is the diagnostic, what caused the models to move in the first place? And is this improvement likely self-sustaining, i.e.will the patient simply get better on its own? Or is the improvement simply transitory with a reversion to full blown crisis ahead? Or perhaps the improvement is real but plateaued, just leaving us with a smaller problem perhaps requiring a different fix? Alternatively you could take a pro-active stance. Having learned that the models can move and having determined why they moved are there steps we could take to assist that movement?</p>
<p>All of these questions come almost automatically once you make the shift from a static projection of demographic crisis to a dynamic projection taking in all the moving parts and determining which ones are moving on their own and which need some exterior push. But it all starts with noticing that the system is moving at all.</p>
<p>Back in 2000 the answer to these questions was pretty easy. From 1997 to 2000 the Reports had significantly under estimated near term growth, moreover then wise men like Greenspan were busy assuring us that these growth rates were totally sustainable, that we could crank out 3% productivity forever. Which if true meant that there would be no Social Security crisis at all, if anything that meant the system was over-funded going forwards and the real discussion should be the amount of timing of FICA tax cuts. Well much of the bloom went off that particular rose when productivity crashed in Q4 2005 and with it stalled the steady improvement in outlook we had experienced right through the Spring of that year (which in retrospect explains the ease of the victory of the &#8216; There Is no Crisis&#8217; pushback on the Bush plan). And flashing forward to today is truly sobering, recent numbers show OAS having stalled and DI actually in retrograde. (Biggs has the February numbers in his post <a target="_blank" href="http://andrewgbiggs.blogspot.com/2009/03/slowdown-slashes-social-security.html">Slowdown Slashes Social Security Surplus</a> and they are not pretty). On the other hand the 2009 Report is due out next week and so will give us a new moving target to examine.</p>
<p>(And speaking of moving target it will be very interesting to compare the GDP projections in the Social Security Report to those in the Budget to those in the CBO analysis of the Budget. The 2008 Report had Intermediate Cost projecting 2.3% Real GDP by 2017 and never improving from there over the actuarial window, while Low Cost had Real GDP at 2.8% with ultimate 2.9% long term. My bet is that we will end up splitting the difference.)</p>
<p>Much of the typical argumentation around Social Security was formed in place via a snapshot of where the system was at the time, typically from the early 1990&#8217;s when the projected collision of &#8216;deficits as far as the eye can see&#8217; and Boomer retirement set up a fairly grim scenario. For example people often point out that Krugman was fairly pessimistic about Social Security in 1996. Well he had a right to be concerned the dynamics of SS from 1993 to 1996 were awful. But the earth moved under his feet by 1999 Baker and Weisbrot were fully justified in calling it a Phony Crisis, and this was still true in 2004. Given the totality of what we knew then and the Bush Administrations own projections of economic growth from his tax cuts there simply was no crisis at all. And there still isn&#8217;t, not really, even the big shock of the current recession/depression will probably be weathered fine by Social Security. But the situation is fluid, it is dynamic and needs to be discussed in those terms. We need to shelve the &#8216;will be&#8217; and embrace the &#8216;may be&#8217; and the &#8216;if so&#8217;.</p>
<p>(To anticipate some commenters. The current deficits projected for the next decade don&#8217;t create the same scenario as those of the late eighties, early nineties because the date of TF depletion has been time shifted forward in time in a way that is irreversible, it has now more or less been disconnected from the point of maximum Boomer strain on the system rather than coinciding with it as it used to project).</p>
