                                <p>I don&#8217;t want to pile on but I did think the new actuarial note was important enough to justify the XLII post.</p>
<p>I want here to front a discussion from the comments on <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/08/soc-sec-xli-why-not-assume-low-cost.html">XLI: Why not assume Low Cost?</a> where I think people are talking past each other. There seems to be some confusion between the concepts of &#8216;Solvency&#8217; and &#8216;predictions of solvency&#8217;.</p>
<p>If we use a starting point of the current year it is pretty clear that the range of outcome from Low Cost to High Cost is overwhelmingly determined by assumed demographics. This is shown pretty clearly in <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/IV_LRest.html#304086">Table IV.B1.—Estimated Annual Income Rates, Cost Rates, and Balances, Calendar Years 1990-2085 [As a percentage of taxable payroll]</a> where the difference in Income rate (the product of real wage/productivity) between Intermediate and Low Cost in 2040 is 11.38 to 11.27 or .11% of payroll while the difference in Cost rate is 14.71 to 12.79 or 1.98% of payroll. And it seems obvious that Cost is primarily driven by the demographics something we can confirm by consulting <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/VI_LRsensitivity.html#92699">Table VI.D2.—Sensitivity to Varying Death-Rate Assumptions[As a percentage of taxable payroll]</a> as opposed to the other component of Cost <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/VI_LRsensitivity.html#93319">Table VI.D5.—Sensitivity to Varying CPI-Increase Assumptions[As a percentage of taxable payroll]</a> where we can see clearly that mortality assumptions have twice the impact on outcomes than inflation assumptions do. So given that the range of outcomes shows that cost is more important than income and that cost is largely if not entirely driven by mortality one could conclude that game, set and match belong to Coberly.</p>
<p>Well not so fast. Though it appears that the range of outcomes is driven by demographics it is not at all clear that the mid-point is. In the Sensitivity tables the mid-point is defined by date of Trust Fund depletion. And year over year changes in this date simply cannot be explained by demography, we don&#8217;t typically get changes in outcomes or predictions big enough to move the needle. And we don&#8217;t have to guess at this, the Trustees supply us with a table that explains exactly what factors change to projected gap in payroll. For example 1999 showed a rather dramatic drop in payroll gap to 2.07% from 2.19% and a change in projected depletion from 2032 to 2034. Table I.B1 on page 5 of <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR99/tr99.pdf">1999 Report in PDF</a> shows us that changes in demographic assumptions resulted in a +.03 change in actuarial balance while the change due to economic assumptions swamped that five-fold with a +.15 change.</p>
<p>So it seems that the date of Trust Fund depletion is largely driven by productivity and GDP while the range of outcomes is determined mostly by demography. It all depends on whether your definition of &#8216;solvency&#8217; is focused on actual outcome or by timing. My particular focus is on timing, Coberly&#8217;s on outcome. It all boils down to potato vs potatoe. (And we don&#8217;t have to call the whole thing off).</p>

                                <p>In a really timely fashion the Office of the Chief Actuary released their Actuarial Note 2008.1 with the above title last month. It is well worth the read for anyone wanting to cut through the conceptual tangle raised in the recent posts on &#8216;Unfunded Liabilities&#8217; and &#8216;Backwards transfers&#8217;. In addition it provides us with some new useful terms of art. (h/t Andrew Biggs)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/NOTES/ran1/index.html">Actuarial Note 2008.1: Unfunded Obligation and Transition Cost</a>. (The Note itself is a frame within the page. Click on HTML and then July and the actual text pops up.) While the substitution of &#8216;obligation&#8217; for &#8216;liability&#8217; may seem like a minor point, it actually marks a major sea change in how we think about potential gaps between future Social Security cost and income. A list of new definitions lies below the fold. I&#8217;ll try to use these in consistent fashion going forward.</p>
<p>The whole thing is an important read for anyone seriously interested in understanding the actuarial position Social Security is in today and what it would take to transition it to a fully funded pension system along the lines of LMS. And the tables present a nice picture of how that actuarial position has changed over time not only in dollars but as a percentage of payroll and GDP.</p>
<p>Accrued benefit obligations—Future benefit obligations based on past earnings as of the valuation date. Thus, these accrued benefit obligations are relevant only to current participants as of the valuation date. The accrued benefit obligations are based on the primary insurance amount (PIA), the early retirement or delayed retirement factors, and other rules of payment. The accrued benefit obligations include:</p>
<p>1) Benefits scheduled to be paid for current (i) retired-worker beneficiaries and (ii) disabled-worker beneficiaries who continue to be disabled after the valuation date.</p>
<p>2) Retired worker benefits based on PIAs determined as of the valuation date for workers who have reached benefit eligibility age (62) and are not yet receiving benefits.</p>
<p>3) Benefits calculated on a proportional past-service-credit basis determined as of the valuation date for current active participants under age 62. These benefits require a computation of a PIA (PIADIB), as of the valuation date, as if the worker had just became eligible to receive a disabled-worker benefit. These benefits are then adjusted so they may be viewed as benefit levels of a worker aged 62. The adjustments are made depending on the type of worker, as illustrated below.4</p>
<p>a. For workers who survive to age 62 and are not disabled after the valuation date, PIADIB would be indexed to age 62 by the Social Security Average Wage Index, and would then be multiplied by the fraction</p>
<p>(age as of the valuation date &#8211; 22) / 40.</p>
<p>b. For workers who survive to age 62, are not disabled as of the valuation date, and become disabled before age 62, PIADIB would be indexed to the date of disability by the Social Security Average Wage Index, and would then be multiplied by the fraction</p>
<p>(age as of the valuation date &#8211; 22) / <br />(age as of the date of disability &#8211; 22).</p>
<p>c. For beneficiaries who are disability beneficiaries as of the valuation date, recover from disability before age 62, and survive to age 62, benefits would equal the disability benefit scheduled to be paid until recovery. After reaching age 62, benefits would be computed based on indexing the final disability benefit received before recovery (PIADIB-RECOV) to age 62 by the Social Security Average Wage Index, and would then be multiplied by the fraction</p>
<p>(age as of recovery from disability &#8211; 22)/40.</p>
<p>Benefits for auxiliary beneficiaries would be based on the primary worker&#8217;s benefits as described above.</p>
<p>Closed group transition cost—Computed like the open group unfunded obligation for a 100-year projection period with the exception that future participants are not included. Specifically, the future cost and future scheduled tax income for only current participants are included in the calculations along with the trust fund assets at the start of the period. The period is extended to 100 years past the valuation date in order to capture the lifetime of all the current participants included in the valuation.</p>
<p>Current participants—All individuals (generations) who are age 15 and older as of the valuation year. This includes all individuals who have been, are, or will be workers and/or beneficiaries. (As noted in Table 3, the age 15 varies for valuation dates before 1984.)</p>
<p>Future cost—The value of OASDI program benefits scheduled in current law and the cost of administering the program.</p>
<p>Future participants—Future workers and beneficiaries, who are under age 15 or not yet born, as of the valuation year. (As noted in Table 3, the age 15 varies for valuation periods before 1984.)</p>
<p>Future scheduled tax income—OASDI tax income scheduled in current law.</p>
<p>Maximum transition cost—The cost of meeting the accrued benefit obligations of the old form while continuing the Social Security program in a completely different form, with all payroll taxes for work after the valuation date credited to the new benefit form. The maximum transition cost is determined as of the valuation date for current and past participants only. It is computed as the difference between</p>
<p>(a) The present value of all future accrued benefit obligations payable on the old form; and</p>
<p>(b) The value of the assets on the valuation date plus the present value of revenue from taxation of future accrued benefit obligations payable on the old form.</p>
<p>The projection period ends 100 years past the valuation date in order to capture the lifetime of all the current participants included in the valuation.</p>
<p>Open group unfunded obligation—Determined as of the valuation date over a specified time period (such as over the long-range 75-year period), computed as the difference between:</p>
<p>(a) The present value of the future cost of the program between the valuation date and the end of the specified time period, and</p>
<p>(b) The sum of the assets in the trust fund as of the valuation date and the present value of the future scheduled tax income of the program between the valuation date and the end of the specified time period.</p>
<p>Future scheduled tax income and cost are projected using the intermediate assumptions for the indicated Trustees Report (the year of the Trustees Report corresponds with the year of the valuation date). All current participants, as well as future participants to the system, over the specified time period are included in the computations.</p>
<p>Past participants—Those who contributed money to the program or received benefits from the program and are no longer alive as of the valuation date.</p>
<p>Sustainable solvency—Indicates that the combined OASDI Trust Funds are expected to be able to pay all scheduled benefits on time over the 75-year projection period and to continue paying all benefits on time for the foreseeable future. Thus, the following two conditions are required to be met:</p>
<p>(a) The level of the trust funds at each point in time during the 75-year projection period is zero or positive, and</p>
<p>(b) The level of the trust funds, expressed as a percent of annual program cost, is stable or rising at the end of the 75-year period.</p>
<p>Valuation date—Beginning of the projection period or January 1 of the starting projection year. This date defines the point in time for determining present values.</p>
<p>Valuation year—First year of the projection period. This year is used to determine current and future participants.</p>

                                                                            <a href="./../index.html" class="post-category-44" title="social security"><div class="color-box"></div>social security</a>                                                                     </div>

                                <p>I have never gotten a satisfactory answer to this question. I have posed it to very prominant people on both sides of Social Security only to have it dismissed by the privatizer and answered by the SS supporter in a way that went over my head. But it is not crazy talk, between 1997 and 2004 outcomes at or better than Low Cost were routine. But perhaps I am getting ahead of myself. What is Low Cost anyway? Well one answer is that it is outcome I on the following figure:<br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/R_PB6t4ggSI/AAAAAAAAAAM/JjA6Q-1kAOQ/s1600-h/Snapshot+2008-04-02+10-08-52.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/R_PB6t4ggSI/AAAAAAAAAAM/JjA6Q-1kAOQ/s320/Snapshot+2008-04-02+10-08-52.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>This figure shows in graphic form the outcomes of Intermediate Cost (II) vs High Cost (III) vs Low Cost (I)
<div>
<p>First we need to make clear the difference between Trust Fund ratio and Trust Fund balance. The TF ratio expresses the balance as a function of time, with 100 equalling one year of projected cost. Since cost goes up every year it is possible for the two measures to move in opposite directions with balances increasing even as ratio starts declining. Which is why people are able to play such games with dates. For example if you examine <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/IV_LRest.html#316289">Table IV.B3.—Estimated Trust Fund Ratios, Calendar Years 2008-85[In percent]</a> you will see that under Intermediate Cost the TF ratio peaks in 2014 even as the TF balance keeps increasing until 2023 <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/VI_OASDHI_dollars.html#150920">Table VI.F8.—Operations of the Combined OASI and DI Trust Funds, in Current Dollars, Calendar Years 2008-85 [In billions]</a>. The much cited Shortfall date of 2017 falls in between and simply marks the point where interest starts having to be tapped.</p>
<p>Figure II.D6 graphically presents the story in terms of Trust Fund ratios. Outcome II shows the standard Intermediate Cost narrative with TF ratio stalling around 2014 then dropping fairly rapidly after 2017 enroute to a zero outcome in 2041. Outcome I though shows a much more dramatic picture. Here the TF ratio continues to climb until 2023 then starts a mild decline until the 2040s and then picks up again until it blasts through the 600 level at the end of the 75 year actuarial window. The picture is even more mindblowing when examined in non-inflation adjusted current dollars (Table VI.F8 above). People want to to wring your hands in anxiety because Intermediate Cost has a $4.3 trillion unfunded liability through the next 75 years. Yet should Low Cost come to be that liability translates in a Trust Fund with $110 trillion dollars in assets. That is a bet on Low Cost represents about a $115 trillion swing over Intermediate Cost, the stakes really could not be higher.</p>
<p>So why not just assume Low Cost and call it good, in fact more than good? Well my answer is to be found under the fold, yours I guess will just have to come in comments.</div>
<p>The answer begins with examination of three tables in the Social Security report:<br /><a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/V_demographic.html#205410">Table V.A1: Principal Demographic Assumptions</a><br /><a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/V_economic.html#188118">Table V.B1: Principal Economic Assumptions</a><br /><a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/V_economic.html#200328">Table V.B2: Additional Economic Factors</a><br />My position from 1997 to 2004 was that Intermediate Cost was ridiculously pessimistic particularly on the economic side but also on the demographic side. Its demographic model suggests that in the face of labor shortages going forward that this country will sharply slow not just illegal immigration but legal immigration as well, and not just in absolute numbers but in relative ones as well. If we were to take this seriously we would have to believe that the proportion of foreign born Americans was going to steadily shrink over time. And while I am sure there are xenophobes out there to whom this would come as really good news, it doesn&#8217;t make a lot of sense from an economic standpoing. If America needs more workers to maintain a good worker/retiree ratio it can get them where it always has: from overseas. On the other hand Low Cost has immigration in the future at numbers comparable to 2005 in absolute numbers but still shrinking in relative terms. If anything this still seems too cautious (a point brought out by the recent Report on Assumptions by the SSAB Technical Panel-see post XVIII).</p>
<p>One standard response is to point out that Low Cost fertility rates are too optimistic. And this is a fair point though one largely to be explained by the design of the model which has every variable of Low Cost working to the upside (see Technical Panel Report for their recommendation on this point). On the other hand an examination of Table V.A1 shows that the trend over the last decade has been to see small increases in this measure, a trend that seems to have accelerated last year <a href="http://www.nctimes.com/articles/2008/01/16/news/nation/11_50_091_15_08.txt">More U.S. babies born, fertility rate up, defying low-birth trend in Europe</a>. So combined with higher immigration (itself associated with higher fertility rates) I am going to just say that the case needs to be made for Intermediate Cost demographic projections.</p>
<p>But it is on the economic side that I see a smoking gun. Take any measure you like whether Productivity or Real Wage (Table V.B1) or Unemployment and Real GDP (Table V.B2) all of them show massive and permanent crashes from 1999 numbers to 2012. For example Real GDP growth is projected under Intermediate Cost to drop by 50% over that time and never recover. On the other hand the &#8216;optimistic&#8217; Low Cost still produces fully funded Social Security with a 33% drop in Real GDP growth over that same period. Take one final glance at Figure II.D6 above, examine some of the data Tables and then explain if you can why I shouldn&#8217;t just assume results closer to Low Cost than Intermediate Cost. {The original post suggested that total GDP would drop. h/t spencer}</p>

                                <p>In November of 2004 Dean Baker issued his &#8216;No Economist/Policy Analyst Left Behind&#8217; challenge. In it he asked people to show that they could produce the 6.5% return on stocks assumed by the Council of Economic Advisors under the actual economic projections of the Intermediate Cost alternative. (Oddly enough for an open and public challenge this has been moved behind a CEPR firewall. For those of you who have access the link is <a href="http://www.cepr.net/index.php/publications/reports/-the-no-economist/policy-analyst-left-behind-test-for-social-security/">here</a>) {Per D R in comments this was just a glitch that will be fixed shortly.}</p>
<p>Baker couldn&#8217;t make it work. He came up with something like 4.9% (the actual number being behind that firewall).</p>
<p>Then Krugman and Baker together took a shot at it with Krugman reporting results back as follows: <a href="http://onegoodmove.org/1gm/1gmarchive/2005/02/no_economist_le.html">No Economist Left Behind</a> (the link goes to a blog post from Feb 2005 and not to Krugman himself).<br />
<blockquote>The Social Security projections that say the trust fund will be exhausted by 2042 assume that economic growth will slow as baby boomers leave the work force. The actuaries predict that economic growth, which averaged 3.4 percent per year over the last 75 years, will average only 1.9 percent over the next 75 years.</p>
<p>In the long run, profits grow at the same rate as the economy. So to get that 6.5 percent rate of return, stock prices would have to keep rising faster than profits, decade after decade.</p>
<p>The price-earnings ratio &#8211; the value of a company&#8217;s stock, divided by its profits &#8211; is widely used to assess whether a stock is overvalued or undervalued. Historically, that ratio averaged about 14. Today it&#8217;s about 20. Where would it have to go to yield a 6.5 percent rate of return?</p>
<p>I asked Dean Baker, of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, to help me out with that calculation (there are some technical details I won&#8217;t get into). Here&#8217;s what we found: by 2050, the price-earnings ratio would have to rise to about 70. By 2060, it would have to be more than 100.</p></blockquote>
<p> And just to put another nail in the coffin Baker and Krugman joined together with DeLong to author <a href="http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/movable_type/bdk-bpea.pdf">Asset Returns and Economic Growth</a> otherwise known as &#8216;BDK&#8217;. Those inclined can read the whole thing. (Beware. What they call &#8216;Arithmetic&#8217; doesn&#8217;t look anything like your fifth grade math class. And what they call &#8216;Algebra&#8217; doesn&#8217;t match my 9th grade experience. But if you like lots of Greek letters and exponents feel free to take a shot at it.) In any event the baseline answer was &#8216;No&#8217;.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t always agree with every single opinion of Baker, DeLong or Krugman. But when they all have their Economist hat on and end up pulling the wagon in the same direction my inclination is to jump on the wagon and not stand in the way and get crushed under the wagon wheels.</p>
<p>The point is that it is pretty clear that most privatization or personal account plans implicitly build in a better set of economic assumptions than the one projected by the Trustees. The problem is that they generally refuse to acknowledge that the NELB challenge exists. Now it is a little unfair to make that charge against the <a href="http://www.socialsecurity.org/pubs/ssps/ssp8.html">Ferrara Plan</a>, because the version linked is dated a full seven years before the date of Dean&#8217;s challenge. But even so you would think the contradiction would be pretty obvious. On the other hand the <a href="http://www.hks.harvard.edu/jeffreyliebman/lms_nonpartisan_plan_description.pdf">Liebman, MacGuineas, Samwick Non-Partisan Social Security Reform Plan</a> was published in final form a whole year after NELB. Yet all we see is a vague appeal to an &#8216;Expected Yield on Mixed Portfolio&#8217;. Maybe there is some extended version that actually lays the numbers out and shows them meeting the NELB challenge, all I know is that after years of asking no one actually has been able to point me there.</p>
<p>In running a conventional business having one set of books to show the auditors and tax men and another to show to your investors is a recipe for a little stay in your nearest minimum security Club Fed. But in selling Social Security &#8216;reform&#8217; it seems to be business as usual.</p>
<p>Since I can&#8217;t get access to their numbers there is no way to confirm what I have suspected for years. Not only do these guys know that <a href="http://bruceweb.blogspot.com/2004/11/what-is-low-cost-alternative-what-does.html">Low Cost</a> is out there, they are counting on similar numbers to make their PRAs work. The idea being taking ordinary economic growth, growth that would fully fund Social Security anyway, and hijack the results to &#8216;prove&#8217; that private accounts are superior to traditional Social Security.</p>
<p>Hold their feet to the fire. Demand that they can meet NELB with numbers less than those of Low Cost. Otherwise it is all a game of bait and switch.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>In the course of the two posts on Backwards Transfers (XXXVI &#038; XXXVII) it became clear that even experts had a somewhat confused concept of the relation of past and future as it comes to Social Security finance. So this post will attempt to add some clarity.</p>
<p>Social Security is by design a Pay/Go system in which current premiums/taxes are used to pay out current benefits. Despite some hysterical hand-waving this is not a &#8216;pyramid scheme&#8217; or a &#8216;ponzi scheme&#8217;, it is an insurance plan functioning much like any other insurance plan. The major difference between the Social Security Administration and New York Life is that the United States government functions as its own re-insurer with Full Faith and Credit backed up by the inherent power to tax.</p>
<p>Like any insurance plan Social Security takes on future obligations, obligations that will have to be met using resources available in the year of benefit collection. These obligations create legal liabilities, the law requires that Social Security to the best of its ability payout future benefits per the current benefit schedule. Now under Pay/Go the assumption is that these future obligations will be met by a continuation of the taxation mechanism currently in place (FICA payroll plus tax on benefits) backed up by a reserve fund (the Trust Funds) which itself generates a moderate amount of income in the way of interest on the Special Treasuries.</p>
<p>Which leads me to pause for a moment and shout: SOCIAL SECURITY IS NOT THE TRUST FUND. The Trust Funds exist to smooth out short to medium term discrepancies between income from tax collected and cost from benefits paid out, they were not designed and do not serve as an investment fund a la CalPers.</p>
<p>Okay we have an insurance plan whose benefit payouts fundamentally depend on future tax collections. Are those payouts &#8216;liabilities&#8217;? Well yes. Are they &#8216;unfunded liabilities&#8217;? Well it depends on your definition of &#8216;unfunded&#8217;. When the Federal government enters into any contract whether for aircraft carriers or retirement security it rarely if ever actually has dollars tucked away to pay for the entire contract over its entire span, instead it relies on future income streams. In the case of Social Security that income stream primarily is a dedicated FICA tax. My argument or maybe just by bare assertion that those future benefits are funded liabilities for as long as we can project that total income and Trust Fund claims on the Treasury will meet cost. So what are &#8220;unfunded liabilities&#8217; in the context of a Pay/Go system? One answer (if not necessarilly THE answer) can be found under the fold.</p>
<p>My answer is that the term &#8216;unfunded liability&#8217; is limited to the gap between the scheduled benefit and projected income going forward. It has nothing to do with benefits paid to past beneficiaries, those obligations have been fully satisfied with ongoing Pay/Go collections. In this case the past is really the past and done is done. The notion that unfunded liability going forward is a result of extra payouts in the past is simply wrong, for one thing the current unfunded liability totals more than the totals of all benefits paid out to date (Infinite Future unfunded $13.6 trillion, past total benefits $12 trillion), for another those payments were funded. But lets go to the numbers:<br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SJndXD4mIXI/AAAAAAAAACY/Ct3ZiWV9HKE/s1600-h/IV.B6.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SJndXD4mIXI/AAAAAAAAACY/Ct3ZiWV9HKE/s320/IV.B6.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SJndXFkPGYI/AAAAAAAAACg/7Z8Frl0gneA/s1600-h/IV.B7.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SJndXFkPGYI/AAAAAAAAACg/7Z8Frl0gneA/s320/IV.B7.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />These may not be legible on your screen but the relevant links are: <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/IV_LRest.html#267528">IV.B6-Unfunded Obligations Through the Infinite Horizon</a> &#038; <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/IV_LRest.html#267012">IV.B7-Present Values of OASDI</a><br />The tables are laid out in different ways but what they deliver in toto is six values: total gap between future income and future cost for the 75 year, 100 year, and Infinite Future Horizon, and then those numbers discounted by the Trust Fund balance at year end 2007 ($2.2 trillion). So the following will lay out the gross and the net for all three periods:<br />75 year: $6.6 / $4.4 trillion<br />100 year: $17.1 / $15.2 trillion<br />Infinite: $15.8 / $13.6 trillion<br />What is the significance of these numbers? Well I think I will follow up in comments.</p>

                                <p>(Erroneously put up as XXXVII)<br />Prior to 2004 Social Security Crisis was explained with a simple narrative: Boomers retire placing enormous strain on system, Trust Funds go bankrupt in short order, checks stop. Result? Social Security won&#8217;t be there for me.</p>
<p>This storyline was always nonsense, as long as payroll tax is being collected benefits would be paid out at some level. And on examination of the numbers it was clear that the result would still be better in real terms than today. But these facts flew mostly under the radar, and given that no one was actually proposing anything concrete social security supporters by and large just kept their powder dry. Until Bush declared war in November 2004.</p>
<p>The result was the &#8216;There is No Crisis&#8217; battle of Spring &#038; Summer 2005 with the result being a near total rout of the crisismongers. They simply were not prepared with real numbers, instead they brought rhetorical rubber knives to an economic gunfight. Faced with the reality that Trust Fund depletion was not projected until 2041, well after the peak impact of Boomer retirement, and that depletion did not in fact equate to &#8216;bankrupt&#8217; or &#8216;flat broke&#8217; they retreated from Crisis at Depletion to Crisis at Shortfall.</p>
<p>Shortfall refers to that time when Social Security receipts from payroll tax and tax on benefit falls behind cost. We should note that this doesn&#8217;t mean that total Income falls behind Cost at shortfall, interest is still accrued on the Trust Fund balances, but shortfall does mark the point that cash transfers have to be made from the General Fund to pay a portion of Social Security benefits. Crisismongers generally present this as some massive fiscal shock requiring huge tax increases or massive benefit cuts leading commenters to ask questions like this:<br />
<blockquote>Movie Guy: &#8220;I&#8217;m interested in knowing, though, what we will say when it&#8217;s time for the U.S. Congress to pay back some of the borrowed monies during the next decade (based on current funding rates). Which discretionary programs will take the hit or will new taxes be applied to offset the Federal Budget shortfalls that may occur?&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Well the short answer is that it may not be necessary either to cut other discretionary programs or raise income taxes. To see why we have to start with the actual numbers in question. Which are to be found below the fold.</p>
<p>Social Security reports future numbers in two forms. Current dollars are the actual cash dollars needed in that future year. Constant dollars adjust that for inflation and so are the better measure for assessing relative impact. Crisismongers will always use current dollars because they are scarier, so I propose to use both.<br /><a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/VI_OASDHI_dollars.html#150920">Table VI.F8.—Operations of the Combined OASI and DI Trust Funds, in Current Dollars, Calendar Years 2008-85 [In billions]</a><br /><a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/VI_OASDHI_dollars.html#140103">Table VI.F7.—Operations of the Combined OASI and DI Trust Funds, in Constant 2008 Dollars, Calendar Years 2008-85 [In billions]</a><br />These tables give annual numbers for needed transfers to or from the General Fund for the first ten years and then in five year intervals after that. Coincidentally Shortfall is projected for year ten or 2017, meaning that all these numbers represent transfers from the General Fund. Numbers are in billions.</p>
<p>Year:::::Current:::::Constant<br />2017:::$24:::::::::::$19<br />2020:::$107:::::::::$77<br />2025:::$275:::::::::$172<br />2030:::$471:::::::::$257<br />2035:::$656:::::::::$313<br />2040:::$808:::::::::$335<br />2045:::$0::::::::::::$0</p>
<p>With war costs FY 2009 deficits are projected to be about $600 billion. So adjusted for inflation amounts of just over half of current year borrowing would be needed to pay for Social Security in the years after 2032. If we make serious attempts to control General Fund spending and most importantly get overall health care costs under control, the cost of Financing Shortfall is not some crippling blow requiring massive cuts in discretionary spending, it can be financed like we have been financing General Fund deficits all along-by borrowing. Now sure as shooting someone will jump up crying &#8216;Current account deficit!!&#8217;. Well that may or may not be a problem going forward, because we can listen to liberal Mr. Gore or ultraconservative Mr. Pickens and find agreement that we can cut the cost of imported oil drastically over the next ten years and so automatically improving the trade deficit at the same time.</p>
<p>In any event nothing in these numbers suggest that Social Security in and of itself is much of a fiscal challenge. Global warming, Peak Oil, Health Care: huge problems that need immediate attention. Social Security? Not so much.</p>
<p>Note too that these numbers use Intermediate Cost assumptions. Under Low Cost transfers don&#8217;t start until 2023 and are much smaller. If I get time will post those numbers in comments, but if we just take 2035 as a sample and use constant dollars we can see a needed transfer of $160 billion or just about half of IC&#8217;s $313 billion.</p>
<p>(But what is with those $0 figures for 2045? Well I&#8217;ll leave that as an exercise for the reader. My answer will come in comments.)</p>

Andrew responded with a new post attempting to rebut my argument. You can see the whole thing at <a href="http://andrewgbiggs.blogspot.com/2008/08/responding-to-angry-bear-where-does-17.html">Responding to Angry Bear: Where does $17 trillion come from</a> including my response to Biggs as well as one to Patrick R. Sullivan (if you were wondering where PRS was (and I wasn&#8217;t) the answer seems to be over at scrivener.net). But I want to put up the core of Andrew&#8217;s argument and my response.<br />
<blockquote>Ordinarily, we think about Social Security&#8217;s finances in cross-section – e.g., how do all taxes paid by all workers in a given year compare to all benefits owed to all retirees or disabled in that year? That&#8217;s obviously very relevant.</p>
<p>But another way of measuring things is by birth cohort: how did all the taxes paid by individuals born in a given year compare to all the benefits they have or will receive? This approach, best known as &#8220;generational accounting,&#8221; was first proposed by Gokhale, Auerbach and Kotlikoff (see this backgrounder by the Tax Policy Center) and has become a standard way of analyzing how the program treats individuals in different birth cohorts. It&#8217;s through a generational accounting approach that we can see where the long-term shortfall comes from.</p>
<p>So for each birth cohort taking part in Social Security, we can calculate (or, for future beneficiaries, project) how their total taxes will compare to their total benefits. If we discount all these values to 2008, add them up and then subtract the current value of the Social Security trust fund, we get the total infinite horizon shortfall for the program. Currently, that amount is projected at $13.6 trillion in present value.</p></blockquote>
<p>He then follows up with an argument from rate of return (for my counter see the comments there) and then concludes with the following:<br />
<blockquote>Now think about future retirees: even if we could pay full scheduled benefits – that is, even if the Low Cost projections came true and we had no solvency problem – future retirees will receive less in benefits than they paid in taxes.</p>
<p>I can sum up the argument in this way:</p>
<p>1.the infinite horizon shortfall is the sum of the net taxes or benefits paid by each cohort, from 1935 through the infinite future; and<br />2.the infinite horizon shortfall is calculated under scheduled benefits; and<br />3.we know that early cohorts received more in (benefits) than they paid in (taxes), and current/future retirees will receive less in benefits than they pay in taxes; therefore we can conclude:<br />4.that the infinite horizon shortfall is entirely attributable to the fact that early cohorts of retirees received far more in benefits than they paid in taxes.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well no. First of all he is making a jump from &#8216;rate of return&#8217; to &#8216;total return&#8217; that is not logically valid, that is 10% interest on a $1000 account gives you $100 whereas 4.5% interest on a $100,000 account gets you $4,500. But the confusion doesn&#8217;t stop there, we don&#8217;t &#8216;know&#8217; that three is true at all. Biggs simply has not yet made the case though he may think he has. But the real answer is to be found (as usual) in the numbers. My response, complete with juicy data is to be found under the fold. </p>
<p>{I edited Biggs&#8217; no. 3 to correct a clear error. His original had people receiving taxes and paying benefits, something he clearly didn&#8217;t intend}</p>
<p>I spent some time this morning with the Historical Tables (IV.A2 and IV.A4 specifically) and did the simple exercise of adding up actual benefits paid out.<br />OAS 1941-1956 $25.6 billion<br />OASDI 1957-1968 $181 billion<br />OASDI 1969-1980 $793.1 billion<br />OASDI 1981-1992 $2.476.5 trillion<br />OASDI 1993-2000 $2.829.3 trillion<br />OASDI 2001-2007 $6.330,9 trillion</p>
<p>For a grand total of $12.636.4 trillion. For Glass to state openly as he did here {at Biggs&#8217;} and at his website that<br />&#8220;If you look at this table {IV.B7} you&#8217;ll see that past/present participants have received $17.4 trillion more in benefits than they paid in taxes.&#8221; is simply not true, and the problem goes far beyond the tense problem in &#8220;have received&#8221;. Instead he simply skipped over the relevant Trustees&#8217; definition of &#8216;current participant&#8217; and ignored the 100 year time frame for costs that generate that $17.1 trillion. Of that amount fully $10.4 trillion falls in the period 2083 to 2108. Trying either to blame this on past beneficiaries or scaring current workers into thinking they actually have to come up with this amount above and beyond what they will actually receive in benefits is just nonsense, and if deliberate pernicious nonsense. No worker scheduled to retire by 2041 (interestingly almost exactly 67 years after the 1983 reform) is likely to collect benefits after 2083, meaning no one born before 1974 is going to be making a claim on that $10.4 trillion. Moreover no one born before 2016, which is to say no one currently born, is going to have to make any part of that post 2082 claim good.  That $10 billion plus time shifts away. It is a simple matter of using a long term calender.</p>
<p>So while the following is a perfectly good way of framing the problem: <br />&#8220;But another way of measuring things is by birth cohort: how did all the taxes paid by individuals born in a given year compare to all the benefits they have or will receive?&#8221; The answer is not to be found in Table IV.B7 and only in a limited way in IV.B6. Instead the answer is to take those birth cohorts seperately, and if you do you will see that each cohort from the Boomers on back to program inception left or is projected to leave the Trust Fund with a positive TF ratio. Given that it is hard to see where the inequity comes from, all of the unfunded liability and all of the revenue needed to backfill it or contrawise the benefit cuts fall on Gen-X and beyond. To project this future gap backwards approaches dishonesty.</p>
<p>As to the graph {seen via link to Biggs} I am not particularly impressed. A 21 year old in 1936 would not be eligible for full benefits until 1980 at which point everyone would be phased into the system. Almost all of the drop before that would seem to be attributable to people becoming eligible for retirement even though they had some to many years of non-contribution. The graph properly interpreted just shows what happens when the program is fully phased in, an event that didn&#8217;t happen until 44 years from program inception.</p>
<p>Too you would need to correct some of those earlier ROI to reflect the cost of paying <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/07/soc-sec-xxxi-what-is-title-1-how-does.html">Title 1</a> benefits out of the General Fund. The dollar value of taxes needed to pay those benefits should be added to actual contributions from payroll to get a real idea of what the real ratio of tax to benefits was. As Title 1 phased out current workers got a silent tax cut, all things being equal the cost of supplying benefits to then current beneficiaries got that much cheaper. (Of course that silent tax cut may have been totally offset by increases in payroll tax over the time period.)</p>
<p>But even after making those corrections I don&#8217;t think the following is correct:<br />&#8220;3. we know that early cohorts received more in (benefits) than they paid in (taxes), and current/future retirees will receive less in benefits than they pay in taxes; therefore we can conclude:<br />4. that the infinite horizon shortfall is entirely attributable to the fact that early cohorts of retirees received far more in benefits than they paid in taxes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well no. 4 does not follow from 3. Total benefits paid out from program inception to 1980 were only $999.6 billion. Even now the total of benefits paid out does not equal projected unfunded liability and was funded to boot. The unfunded liability to Infinite Future is entirely due to a gap in projected cost via projected revenue starting in 2041 and not due to past benefit payments at all. I am afraid I am still not able to accept the Biggs/Glass formulation.</p>

                                <p>Time to knock this one down before it gets started.</p>
<p>Over at Andrew Bigg&#8217;s blog he has a post up called <a href="http://andrewgbiggs.blogspot.com/2008/07/academy-of-actuaries-raise-retirement.html">Academy of Actuaries: Raise the Retirement Age</a>. I am not particularly concerned with the text quoted which actually amounts to some AP guy&#8217;s take on an advance copy of what the Academy will actually release. &#8216;Bankrupt&#8217; is as likely to have just come out of reporter Holland&#8217;s head than the actual text. What I am concerned about is a number and a concept that popped up in comments there.</p>
<p>First we have commenter Jim Glass defining the overall problem as follows:<br />
<blockquote>I&#8217;d for once like to see some group come out and specify the problems to be fixed first. Then relate its fix to those problems.</p>
<p>There are a bunch of problems, e.g.:<br />* Long term actuarial balance.<br />* Cash flow problems in the 2020s, when cash needed for the trust fund on top of all that for Medicare, Medicaid, etc., is very likley to cause program re-writes that make today&#8217;s long-term actuarial projections (and fixes) irrelevant.<br />* The economic loss forced on the young by the $17t &#8220;backward transfer&#8221;, that protends loss of future political support for SS.<br />* Spreading that loss to the young (inevitable as it is) equitably among generations.<br />* The decline in the &#8220;progressive social insurance&#8221; nature of SS due to the just-above points.</p></blockquote>
<p> Then Biggs comes along and states in part:<br />
<blockquote>Regarding whether it&#8217;s fair, as strange as it sounds, in one sense fairness isn&#8217;t really the issue. The future Social Security shortfall is a function of over-generosity to past participants and unfavorable demographic projections going forward </p></blockquote>
<p>. Note that Biggs does not dispute the $17 trillion &#8220;backward transfer&#8221; but instead implicitly allows it to be equated with &#8220;over-generosity to past particpants&#8221;. But I think I want to cry &#8216;bullshit&#8217; on the whole notion. A copy of my comment to that thread appears under the fold.</p>
<blockquote><p>Jim Glass could you clarify some of your comments? For example when I look at the following table I just don&#8217;t see any major &#8220;cash flow problem in the 2020s&#8221;. <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/VI_OASDHI_dollars.html#140103">Table VI.F7.—Operations of the Combined OASI and DI Trust Funds, in Constant 2008 Dollars, Calendar Years 2008-85 [In billions].</a> Instead I see a gap in 2025 of about $170 billion in 2008 dollars or not much more than the cost of the current stimulus package. The notion that a similar borrowing need in 2025 will bring the bond market to its knees could use some explication.</p>
<p>Plus I am a little confused about the &#8220;$17 t &#8220;backward transfer&#8221;&#8221;. First I have no idea where the $17 trillion figure comes from. Oops full stop.</p>
<p>I now see that the $17.4 trillion comes from Table IV.B7. But the methodology seems odd. <br />&#8220;The first line of table IV.B7 shows that the present value of future cost less future taxes over the next 100 years for all current participants equals $17.4 trillion. For this purpose, current participants are defined as individuals who attain age 15 or older in 2008.&#8221;<br />What? Why 100 years rather than the standard 75 years or alternately Infinite Future? Using the former we would be capturing all &#8220;current participants&#8221; whose life expectancies are 90 years or less which is to say almost everyone. But that would give us a PV of future cost over future tax of $6.5 trillion which if reduced by the 2007 year end value of the TF would give us a total unfunded liability of $4.3 trillion (per Table IV.B4). On the other hand if we extended this to Infinite Future we end up with PV of future cost over future tax of $15.8 trillion which reduced by the current TF balance gives a unfunded liability of $13.6 trillion. Instead we seem to have an arbitrary figure of 100 years which manages to tack $10.9 trillion in excess costs during the period 2083 to 2108. No &#8216;current participant&#8217; as defined will be contributing taxes in that period and the youngest person drawing benefits at its inception will be 90 years old. To call this a &#8216;backward transfer&#8217; is kind of bizaare. It is fair to say that no current beneficiary will be drawing a check in 2083 (62 plus 75 = 137). As for current contributers the youngest Boomer will be 119 in that year (2083-1964), the youngest Gen-X 101 (2083-1982). Sticking us for a near $11 trillion extra tab that doesn&#8217;t start coming due for 75 years seems kind of a stretch.</p>
<p>And Andrew seems to share this with his &#8220;over-generorisity to past participants&#8221;. Given that the Trust Funds never actually went to zero and are sitting at $2.3 trillion today clearly there was no over-generosity for those past participants who are now deceased, they paid their way and then some. And considering that SS income and the principal in the TF are currently scheduled to fund full benefits until 2041 it is hard to blame any current beneficiaries, the youngest (early retirement in 2008 at age 62) of them will be 100 in 2041.</p>
<p>So I am not buying into the premise. Plus I find it interesting that per Table IV.B7 the PV of cost less taxes for all future participants is actually a negative $1.5 trillion. Making it look like $17.4 trillion was simply picked as representing the scariest number possible. I&#8217;ll accept some responsibility for the $6.5 trillion gap between projected future cost over future income between now and 2082 (but I do want credit for the $2.3 trillion in the Trust Funds). And this even though I don&#8217;t expect to be around after 2041. But I simply see no reason to accept any responsibility for contingent outcomes over the period 2082 to 2108.</p></blockquote>
<p> It is bad enough that they were able to slip Infinite Future Horizon into this debate. To deliberately single out a particular 25 year period starting 75 years from now and taking its projected imbalance between income and cost as somehow being the responsibility of &#8216;past participants&#8217; is preposterous special pleading. Or someone can convince me otherwise in comments.</p>
<p>But in any event you can expect this &#8216;$17 trillion backward transfer&#8217; to start popping up everywhere and I wanted to give everyone a heads up.</p>

                                <p>It is almost impossible to figure out whether Social Security is tracking better or worse than projected using productivity or Real GDP, for one thing the data lags and moreover is subject to revision. But there is one measure that can be tracked with precision: Trust Fund cash balances which are reported to the penny by the Treasury Department with a one month lag. Which means that the June and hence mid-year Report is out. So how about some numbers?</p>
<p>The web page for all the Trust Fund Reports (including Medicare HI, Highways etc) is http://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/tfmp/tfmp.htm For my purposes I just want to look at OAS (Old Age Survivors) and DI (Disability) the Reports themselves are found at the links below.<br />OAS ftp://ftp.publicdebt.treas.gov/dfi/tfmb/dfifo0608.pdf<br />DI   ftp://ftp.publicdebt.treas.gov/dfi/tfmb/dfifd0608.pdf</p>
<p>Our starting point as always is the Report in this case <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/IV_SRest.html#248224">Table IV.A1.—Operations of the OASI Trust Fund, Calendar Years 2003-171 [Amounts in billions]</a> and <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/IV_SRest.html#251965">Table IV.A2.—Operations of the DI Trust Fund, Calendar Years 2003-171 [Amounts in billions]</a><br />Per IV.A1 the opening balance for OAS was $2.023 trillion, projected year end balance under Intermediate Cost $2.216, projected year end balance under Low Cost $2.221.<br />Per IV.A2 the opening balance for DI was $214 billion, projected year end under IC $218.7 billion, under LC $221.3 billion</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t even have to do the math, that same table shows that under IC the OAS balance was projected to increase by $192.4 billion, while under LC the number is $197.6. For DI the equivalent figures are IC $3.8 billion, LC $6.4 billion.</p>
<p>So what does Treasury tell us for a mid-year result?: OAS $2.140 trillion, DI $220 billion, for a total June 30 OASDI balance of $2.360 trillion.</p>
<p>Assuming for the moment that income generally comes in evenly between the first six months and the last six months (reasonable enough because it seems to divide seasonal effects pretty evenly (wage people, feel free to fill us in in comments)) how are we doing? Well OAS has gone up by $117 billion, DI up by $5 billion. Against a IC projection that would have OAS up by $96.2 billion and DI up by $1.9 billion against an LC projection that would have OAS up by $98.8 billion and DI up by $3.2 billion.</p>
<p>Well what does this mean? I am not sure, I was hoping you all could tell me. But it continues a pattern. Over the last decade DI has always lagged OAS in that its Trust Fund was projected to run out sooner, something that can be graphically in <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/IV_LRest.html#266183">Figure IV.B3.—Long-Range OASI and DI Trust Fund Ratios [Assets as a percentage of annual expenditures]</a>, in the 2008 Report its date of Trust Fund depletion is projected at 2025 under IC. On the other hand look at the result under LC (outcome I).</p>
<p>Conclusion one. DI is smashing through projections just as it did in 2007. While combined OASDI came in modestly ahead of projections that year, all of that was due to DI, the weak Q4 having burned OAS quite badly (it was on track to break projections right through Sept). Conclusion two. OAS delivered 59% of its projected increase by June 30th, DI 263% against IC projections. Under LC projections the numbers work out the same for OAS at 59% and DI at 142%.</p>
<p>Conclusion last. Social Security seems to be weathering the current storm pretty well. If like 2007 we have a really rocky Q4 then the outlook might darken somewhat but for now things are looking good. (Please place math corrections in comments, Because I don&#8217;t doubt the possibility. Which is why I give the original links.)</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Well open threads are good enough for Kos and Duncan and both Matt and Ezra have opened up Assignment Desk threads so I might as well jump on the bandwagon.</p>
<p>I just got finished updating my index for this series at <a href="http://bruceweb.blogspot.com/2008/06/more-social-security-posts-from-angry.html">More Social Security Posts from Angry Bear</a> and see that XXXIII was exactly a week ago. While I have been mulling some ideas nothing super compelling comes to mind. So here is your shot to get the discussion going or perhaps suggest ways I could get the discussion going. In the meanwhile I am going to list some useful Social Security resources below the fold.</p>
<p>First it all starts with the <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/index.html">Reports of the Trustees of Social Security</a> Recent Reports are available in PDF, HTML and paper formats (delivered with free first class postage paid), older Reports are available in a variety of formats back to 1941. The Reports are a little daunting at first, probably the best way to approach them is through the <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/trLOT.html">List of Tables</a> which allows you first to examine the numbers and then scroll up or down to read the relevant text. The key tables are V.B1 and V.B2 which give you the economic projections, V.A1 which gives you demographic projections, VI.A4 historical operations back to 1957, and VI.F7 and VI.F8 which give you projected results out to 2085. Familiarize yourself with these and you too can be a Social Security maven.</p>
<p>Second you want to pay some homage to the godfathers. In 1999 Dean Baker and Mark Weisbrot published the ur-text <a href="http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/035468.html">Social Security: the Phony Crisis</a> of which the introduction is online via this link. In all honesty I never read the whole thing, by the time it came out I had pretty much formed my own line of thinking, but if you want some actual professionally trained experts takes on this and an explanation of why the &#8216;crisis&#8217; is &#8216;phony&#8217; (not &#8216;wrongheaded&#8217; mind you, but &#8216;phony&#8217; as in &#8216;fake&#8217;), this is probably the place to start. (Though the link failed to load this morning).</p>
<p>Third I would take a look at the single most useful visual guide to what I have been trying to convey. <a href="http://www.epi.org/content.cfm/issueguides_socialsecurity_changes">EPI: Changes in Trustees Projections over time</a>. The dates and numbers of Social Security are not static they are instead quite dynamic or were from 1997 to 2004 which is the span covered by this table. The point being that &#8216;crisis&#8217; language that might have been justifiable in 1996 became wildly outdated by 2004. Yet the rhetoric didn&#8217;t change even though the major players all knew the score. Which BTW fully justifies Baker and Weisbrot&#8217;s title &#8216;Phony Crisis&#8217;. EPI shows you why in a glance.</p>
<p>And to finish it all off Lee A. Arnold put up a first version of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tts2uTWt6e8">Social Security (Ecolanguage)</a> in 2005 and put up a slightly modified version on YouTube in 2006. It is an excellent animation that explains the basics.</p>
<p>If you want to see where Coberly and I are coming from and where we are trying to take people to you could do worse than reviewing these four critical sources.</p>
