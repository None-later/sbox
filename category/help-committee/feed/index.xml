<p>Yeah well Marc Antony was not quite telling the truth, either. You could see this particular re-write of history coming a mile away and it is time to stop this one in its tracks. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/08/26/AR2009082603677.html?hpid=topnews">Both Parties Mourn Loss of Kennedy in Health-Care Debate</a><br />
<blockquote>Three GOP senators suggested in their remembrances of Kennedy that Democrats will need more than respectful conversation to gain bipartisan support for a health-care bill.  Sens. John McCain (Ariz.),  Orrin Hatch (Utah) and  Judd Gregg (N.H.) lamented Kennedy&#8217;s absence in the negotiations.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we may have made progress on this health-care issue if he had been there,&#8221; McCain told CNN. &#8220;He had this unique capability to sit people down at a table together &#8212; and I&#8217;ve been there on numerous occasions &#8212; and really negotiate, which means concessions. And so, he not only will be missed, but he has been missed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe if he had been active the last few months, we would have some sort of consensus agreement,&#8221; said Gregg, a passionate advocate of Medicare reform who has sat out Senate deliberations on perhaps the most extensive revisions ever to that program.</p>
<p>&#8220;We would have worked it out. We would have worked it out on a bipartisan basis,&#8221; Hatch, who co-authored numerous health-care bills with Kennedy over the years, said on CNN. &#8220;I&#8217;ll be happy to work in a bipartisan basis any day, any time . . . but it&#8217;s got to be on something that&#8217;s good and not just some partisan hack job.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>This is complete and utter bullshit, and a blatant attempt to rewrite the history of the last eight weeks. To see why follow me under the fold.</p>
<p>Kennedy did his part on health care, his Committee, Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions or HELP, passed its bill out of Committee on July 1st. My blog post on this was here: <a target="_blank" href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/07/kennedy-dodd-help-bill-with-cbo-scoring.html">Kennedy-Dodd HELP Bill w/CBO Scoring</a> For convenience lets throw the CBO tables in here:<br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/Sk4j_GCWeVI/AAAAAAAAAQk/KdreX0N_9SI/s1600-h/CBO+Dodd-Kennedy+pg1.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/Sk4j_GCWeVI/AAAAAAAAAQk/KdreX0N_9SI/s400/CBO+Dodd-Kennedy+pg1.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/Sk4j-wVFFVI/AAAAAAAAAQc/SSwNsabHHuM/s1600-h/CBO+Dodd-Kennedy+pg.+2.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/Sk4j-wVFFVI/AAAAAAAAAQc/SSwNsabHHuM/s400/CBO+Dodd-Kennedy+pg.+2.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>The response to the HELP bill was almost immediate. Max Baucus declared it DOA and announced that Senate Finance would re-write the ENTIRE bill including the parts not normally under the jurisdiction of his Committee. Moreover in doing so he formed what was originally a Gang of Seven that included four Republicans but froze out Kennedy ally Rockefeller who was actually was and is the Chairman of the Finance Sub-Committee on Health. The whole process was a big ol&#8217; F-U to Kennedy and everybody knew it.</p>
<p>Now Republicans are trying to claim that if only Kennedy had been around he would have been able to work out a compromise, apparently in the form of throwing away ever principle it had ever held by making &#8220;concessions&#8221; which in the context of how Senate Finance has been handling things means complete and total surrender to the Republicans and the Insurance Companies.</p>
<p>It is Bullshit. Full Stop. Kennedy already made tremendous concessions in the course of issuing the HELP Bill. It cost were scored out at a third less than the preliminary version sent for scoring to CBO, a severe trimming that was accomplished by covering a much smaller proportion of the population than that of the House Tri-Committee Bill. Whereas the latter bill is projected to cover 97% of the total LEGAL NON-ELDERLY population, Kennedy&#8217;s HELP Bill only scored as covering 90% of that same population and leaving 34 million uninsured. If anything Kennedy-Dodd bent over backwards to accomodate the fiscal concerns of the Blue Dogs and Republicans and STILL got spat in the face by Baucus  for their trouble.</p>
<p>Republicans are already, and predictably trying to re-write history to suggest that Kennedy &#8216;obviously&#8217; would of given up even more than he did. Well too bad, that was never going to happen, and certainly shouldn&#8217;t happen now. The answer for Democrats is to take the HELP Bill off the table, replace it with the much stronger Tri-Committee Bill and tell these hypocritical, crocodile tear crying Republicans to piss up a rope while Dems pass a real Kennedy-Dingel Bill.<br />______________________<br />By the way you will see reporting that Kennedy&#8217;s bill covered 97% of the population while costing $350 billion less than the Tri-Committee. This is apples and oranges reporting. If you examine the table above the Kennedy bill leaves 10% of legal American residents uninsured and 34 million people total, about twice what the House bill does as seen below.<br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SlzrP7hBJ1I/AAAAAAAAARU/BSFpq3Ud4fw/s1600-h/House+Health+pg.1.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SlzrP7hBJ1I/AAAAAAAAARU/BSFpq3Ud4fw/s400/House+Health+pg.1.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>

<p>Republican obstructionists to Obama&#8217;s agenda have developed a new tactic. Seemingly forgetful of how Republican majorties jammed through huge bills without letting Dems actually read them, they now insist that every Dem has to read every bit of every bill and more specifically the Health Care Bill. Well in reality that is not that much of a challenge. Behold a typical page of legislation:<br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SnSYCWDZlwI/AAAAAAAAAR0/c5YYwkaxCxw/s1600-h/HELP+Grab.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SnSYCWDZlwI/AAAAAAAAAR0/c5YYwkaxCxw/s400/HELP+Grab.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />If you click on the image to expand it you will see that is is is quite large print, is double spaced, and much indented. Moreover large parts of it are clear boiler plate, necessary to get the exact language in the subsequent U.S. Code correct, but mostly not necessary to get the sense correct. I don&#8217;t mean that you don&#8217;t need to read bill language carefully, but it is not like reading a 1000 page bill is the equivalent of reading War and Peace.</p>
<p>This sample is from the Senate HELP bill which is 175 pages long. Why is it so much shorter than the House version? Because it only covers the policy components of establishing the benefits package and administering the Exchange, the bulk of the bill is taken up with various tax provisions, important yes but not so much so that you cannot evaluate the policy options without them. Lets look at the text of HR3200 as introduced.<br />http://edlabor.house.gov/documents/111/pdf/publications/AAHCA-BillText-071409.pdf<br />On page 2 we see that the bill is divided into Division A &#8211; Affordable Health Care Choices and Division B &#8211; Medicare and Medicaid Improments. Division A takes up the first 215 pages while Division B takes up the remaining 803.</p>
<p>I am not saying that Division B is not important or that it doesn&#8217;t have some controversial pieces, but mostly it is tinkering with programs that already exist, the real policy innovations are in Division A. And if we look at that we see that it is divided into four Titles. Title 1 &#8211; Protections and Standards for Qualified Benefit Plans, Title 2 &#8211; Health Insurance Exchange and Related Provisions, Title 3 &#8211; Shared Responsibility, and Title 4 -Amendments to the Internal Revenue Code. Of the 215 pages Title 1 takes up pg. 5-71, Title 2 pg. 72-143, Title 3 pg. 143-167. Even at that much of the material is administrative or spelling out specific language  changes to current existing code.</p>
<p>The Republicans are going to try to make hay out of this &#8216;Have you read the bill&#8217; message and to laugh at Obama&#8217;s offer to take people through the bill &#8220;line by line&#8221; but there is nothing that laughable about it. Because most of the meat is concentrated in just a small number of sections in Division A, a couple of hours of briefing or browsing is probably enough to get the average Congressman up to speed on this legislation. In fact the biggest frustration is that while the pages are numbered there are no page keys to translated Section numbers to pages, but except for that this is not that difficult a read.</p>
<p>When people make the claim that no one can really understand a 1018 page bill realize that mostly you don&#8217;t need to deeply engage with more than maybe seventy or eighty double spaced, highly indented pages to get a pretty solid grasp of what the bill proposes.</p>
