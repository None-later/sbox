				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amity_Shlaes">Amity Shlaes</a>, the <a href="http://chronicle.com/blognetwork/edgeofthewest/2009/04/23/how-denialism-works/">disinformation bunny</a>, is still going.  In the latest issue of <i>Imprimus</i>, a publication of <a href="http://www.hillsdale.edu//">Hillsdale College</a>, is a transcript adapted from a recent talk she gave there during a conference on the Income Tax, sponsored by Hillsdale&#8217;s own <a href="http://www.hillsdale.edu/seminars/oncampus/cca/default.asp">Center for Constructive Alternatives</a> and the <a href="http://mises.org/media/categories/160/Lecture-Series">Ludwig von Mises Lecture Series</a>.  Right away, you know this is going to be good.  The Title of her contribution is <a href="http://www.hillsdale.edu/news/imprimis.asp"><u>Calvin Coolidge and the Moral Case for Economy</u></a>.  Of course, by economy, she means austerity.</p>
<p>There is so much wrong here it&#8217;s both impressive and depressing.  Rather than give her the full<a href="http://www.ginandtacos.com/index.php?s=fjm"> FJM treatment</a>,  which would take more time and energy than she deserves, I&#8217;ll just hit  on a couple of the lowlights.  Here is her opening paragraph.</p>
<blockquote><p>With  the Federal debt spiraling out of control, many Americans sense an  urgent need to find a political leader who is able to say &#8220;no&#8221; to  spending.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here we go. Her first sentence is an exercise in made-up right-wing talking point mythology.  I&#8217;ve already exploded the &#8216;<i>Obama is a profligate spender</i>&#8221; myth, <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/09/a-quick-look-at-federal-spending.html">here</a>, <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/09/why-spendinggdp-is-terrible-horrible-no.html">here</a>, and <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/09/yes-right-wing-lies-when-they-say-obama.html">here</a>. Further, we have just lived through three years when federal spending was close to flat line, as Graph 1 shows.   </p>
<p>
<div><a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fredgraph.png?g=gt5"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fredgraph.png?g=gt5" width="400"></a></div>
<div> Graph 1 &#8211; Flat Federal Spending Under Obama  </div>
<p>There   is only one comparable period in post WW II history, 1953-56, during  Eisenhower&#8217;s first term, as shown in Graph 2.   Still, over Ike&#8217;s full  term, spending grew by about 30%.</p>
<p>
<div><a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fredgraph.png?g=gwU"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fredgraph.png?g=gwU" width="400"></a></div>
<div> Graph 2  Not So Flat Spending Growth Under Eisenhower (&#8217;53-&#8217;60)</div>
<p>To  suggest that federal dept is now  &#8220;spiraling out of control&#8221; due to excessive spending is not merely  disingenuous.  It is a sign that either Shlaes has no earthly idea what  she&#8217;s talking about, which in an alleged journalist, is unforgivable, or  it&#8217;s a bare-faced lie, which is unforgivable for anybody.  And if many  Americans are feeling the urgent need to curtail government spending, it&#8217;s because  they have been lied to so repeatedly and often that <a href="http://maddowblog.msnbc.com/_news/2013/02/22/17056939-a-well-kept-fiscal-secret?lite">they have no idea what the truth is</a>.  As <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/10/attack-of-the-trust-fund-zombie/?gwh=AB363FEF15056F07526B7216D6409BAD">Krugman recently put it</a>: &#8220;<i>And I have to say, it’s extremely telling that conservative Republicans  don’t seem able to make their case without resorting, right from the  beginning, to obviously dumb fallacies</i>.&#8221;  The truth is that if we have a debt problem, it is due to <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2013/01/another-look-at-spending-and-revenues.html">a shortfall in revenues</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Yet they fear that finding such a leader is impossible.</p></blockquote>
<p>Its  not clear who made Shlaes the spokesperson for this sorry,  disenfranchised segment of the population, nor that this is indeed what  they fear.  Perhaps we should introduce Shlaes and the rest of these  Real Americans to the <i>real</i> President B. Hoover Obama.</p>
<blockquote><p>Conservatives long for another Ronald Reagan.</p></blockquote>
<p>This  is probably correct, though as Shlaes goes on to demonstrate,  conservatives in this way &#8211; and, alas, right-wingers almost always &#8211; are rather badly  disconnected from reality.</p>
<blockquote><p>He  was of course a tax cutter, reducing the top marginal rate from 70 to  28 percent.  But his tax cuts &#8211; which vindicated supply side economics  by vastly increasing federal revenue &#8211; were bought partly through a  bargain with Democrats who were eager to spend that revenue.</p></blockquote>
<p>Wrong again.  The reality is that <a href="http://jazzbumpa.blogspot.com/2010/02/taxes-and-revenues.html">Revenue growth under Reagan was the worst</a> of any 20th century President, post Eisenhower, except for the  unfortunate Bush, Sr. under who&#8217;s recession plagued regime Reagan&#8217;s buzzards came home to  roost. And was it really the Democrats who spent that anemic revenue  stream, or did it go to Reagan&#8217;s Star Wars fantasy?</p>
<blockquote><p>Reagan was no budget cutter.  In fact, the federal budget grew over a third during his administration.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here, she finally gets something right, if by &#8220;federal budget&#8221; she means Total Outlays, and by &#8220;over a third&#8221; <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/Historicals">she means over 80%</a>  [as measured from 1980 to 1988.]</p>
<p>Things get really egregious further on in the section titled &#8220;<i>The Purpose of Tax Cuts.</i>&#8221;   She informs us that President Coolidge and Treasury Secretary Andrew  Mellon campaigned to lower top rates from the 50&#8217;s to the 20&#8217;s.</p>
<blockquote><p>Mellon  and Coolidge did not win all they sought.  The top rate of the final  law was in the forties.  But even this reduction yielded results &#8211; more  money flowing into the treasury &#8211; suggesting that &#8220;scientific taxation&#8221;  worked.  By 1926, Coolidge was able to sign legislation that brought the  top marginal rate down to 25%, and do so retroactively.</p></blockquote>
<p>I  was surprised to learn that Coolidge and Mellon had anticipated the  Laffer curve by 6 decades.  Let&#8217;s have a look at how more money flowed  into the treasury. In 1922 and &#8217;23, with a <a href="http://www.ntu.org/tax-basics/history-of-federal-individual-1.html">top marginal rate of 56%</a>, <a href="http://www.usgovernmentrevenue.com/revenue_chart_1915_1930USb_13s1li011mcn_10f30f40f50f60f_Federal_Revenue_By_Type#copypaste">tax revenues were $2.23 and 1.69 billion respectively</a>.  [Per FRED, 1923 was a recession year]  In 1924, with a top rate of 46%,  total revenues were $1.79 billion.  This is what Shleas calls &#8220;more  money flowing into the treasury.&#8221;  Here&#8217;s a bigger picture look.  In 1920, when <a href="http://elsa.berkeley.edu/~saez/course/Labortaxes/taxableincome/taxableincome_attach.pdf">the top marginal rate was 73%</a>,  receipts were slightly over $4 billion.  In 1925, when the top marginal  rate  was 25%, receipts were $1.7 billion, less than half of the 1920 value,  and by 1929 had only increased to 2.23 billion.  Graph 3 shows revenues  per year [Coolidge&#8217;s term highlighted in red,] and belies Shlaes&#8217;  assertion.</p>
<p>
<div><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-bVkHKA53V6o/UUCqW6I4XXI/AAAAAAAACKU/I17GBhpSCSA/s1600/Tax+Revs+in+the+20s.jpg"><img border="0" height="287" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-bVkHKA53V6o/UUCqW6I4XXI/AAAAAAAACKU/I17GBhpSCSA/s400/Tax+Revs+in+the+20s.jpg" width="400"></a></div>
<div> Graph 3 Income Tax Revenues, 1915-1930</div>
<p>Graph  4 shows a scatter plot of this same data, with revenues as a function  of top marginal rate, Coolidge years are again highlighted in red.</p>
<p>
<div><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-gbkQnk_E22Y/UUCrXXHiWVI/AAAAAAAACKc/k2vQCm1w9Sk/s1600/Top+Rate+and+Revs+1915-30.jpg"><img border="0" height="285" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-gbkQnk_E22Y/UUCrXXHiWVI/AAAAAAAACKc/k2vQCm1w9Sk/s400/Top+Rate+and+Revs+1915-30.jpg" width="400"></a></div>
<div>Graph 4 Top Marginal Rate and Tax Revenues, 1915-1930</div>
<p>A  best fit straight line is included.  There&#8217;s lots of scatter, for a  variety of reasons, but the upward trend &#8211; the exact opposite of Shleas&#8217;  assertion, is obvious.</p>
<p>So here&#8217;s the reality.  A  decade of tax cutting and deregulation led  us into the Great Depression, the worst economic collapse of the 20th  century. [You might note that the following decades of high tax rates  and robust regulation were free of these horrible events.]  And what  happened most recently?  A decade of tax cuts and deregulation &#8211; the end  game of three decades of this supply-side approach &#8211; led to the  greatest economic collapse since the Great Depression.  Significantly,  the major deregulations of big finance, including the repeal of  Glass-Steagall came at the end of Clinton&#8217;s  term, less than a decade prior to the financial melt down.  Last Friday  on his radio show, Thom Hartmann pointed out that prior to the  regulations put in place in the 30&#8217;s, the U.S. had never gone for more  than 15 years without a major financial collapse.  So this result should  have been expected.</p>
<p>The  extraordinary thing isn&#8217;t that right wingers lie.  The simple reality  is that they can&#8217;t make their case without lying, because it has no  merit.  The extraordinary thing is that their lies are so easily rooted  out and refuted, in the era of free and easily accessible information,  but so few people will take the required few minutes to go ahead and do  it. Sadly, whenever the truth comes up against a cascade of lies, <a href="http://www.juliansanchez.com/2009/04/06/climate-change-and-argumentative-fallacies/">the liars have a significant tactical advantage</a>.  </p>
<p>Shlaes&#8217; presentation is just one more  manifestation of the right wing ploy of denying reality.   Sadly, it  works, because you really can fool a lot of the people a lot of the  time.</p>

(via Didby at Hullaaloo.)  I happen to agree, it would be nice if our president would get it straight, but&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/15061570">The Watson Institute presents Mark Blyth on Austerity</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/globalconv">The Global Conversation</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com/">Vimeo</a>.</p>
<p> Of course, my pet peeve is that no one is talking about our nation&#8217;s equity.  I am confident that the American family would get that part of financing as it relates to borrowing and investing.  Heck, how long was it before Amazon broke even yet they kept right on borrowing and growing?*  Or lets put it closer to home.  How many Americans purchased a home that was valued at and borrowed against for the purchase that was equal to their annual income?  What was the old rule&#8230;3 times the median income was the average home price?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While we are busy paying attention to the 550th edition of  Republican-caused fake crises (aka the sequester), a much more real  crisis is brewing in the Eurozone. Richard Field at <a href="http://tyillc.blogspot.com/2013/02/are-european-policymakers-about-to.html">Trust Your Instincts</a> flags a <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/02/25/eurozone-cyprus-options-idUSL6N0BPDXL20130225">Reuters report</a> that that Eurozone regulators are strongly considering a proposal to  make not just investors in Cyprus banks pay for part of their bailout,  but bank depositors as well.</p>
<p>Cyprus is a tax haven, and  deposits in the banks there come to some 70 billion euros, more than 3  1/2 times the tiny country&#8217;s 18 billion euro gross domestic product. One  proposal under consideration would be to hold all deposits over 100,000  euros in escrow &#8212; for up to 30 years! Another proposal, says Reuters,  would &#8220;impose a retroactive tax on all deposits over 100,000 euros&#8230;&#8221;  If either of these options looks like it is close to being approved, it  is likely to cause a run on banks in Cyprus. As Field argues, if one of  these plans is established, depositors will likely wonder if it could be  applied to other debtor countries like Spain or Italy, causing even  more turmoil. (Note: 100,000 euros is the maximum that can be covered by  deposit insurance programs similar to the FDIC in the U.S.)</p>
<p>While  European leaders seem to want to blunder into a new way of creating a  euro crisis, the evidence continues that their preferred austerity  policies are failing. The European Commission has announced that the  eurozone will remain in recession throughout 2013, according to a  separate report by <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/02/22/us-europe-economy-eurozone-idUSBRE91L0B620130222">Reuters</a>. Previously, the Commission had predicted that the recession would end this year. As <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/02/23/austerity-europe-2/">Paul Krugman shows</a>,  the countries that have had the severest austerity have had the largest  contractions in their economy. Based on International Monetary Fund  estimates of the policy change in a number of European countries, he  plots this against the change in their real gross domestic product from  2008 to 2012:</p>
<p><img alt="" height="297" src="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2013/02/23/opinion/022313krugman1/022313krugman1-blog480.png" width="480"><br />Source:  Paul Krugman (link above). Key: AUT-Austria; BEL-Belgium; DEU-Germany;  ESP-Spain; FIN-Finland; GRC-Greece; IRL-Ireland; ITA-Italy;  NLD-Netherlands; PRT-Portugal</p>
<p>So, for example, Greece has imposed austerity equal to about 15% of potential GDP, and seen its actual GDP shrink by about 18%.</p>
<p>Despite  the clear failure of austerity policies in the eurozone and Great  Britain (where 9 months of recession were followed by one quarter of  growth but a renewed slump in the last quarter of 2012, and <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2013/02/22/moodys-downgrades-uk/1940065/">Moody&#8217;s just downgraded</a> the country&#8217;s debt), Republicans are still trying to impose budget cuts on the country that we voted against in November. <a href="http://middleclasspoliticaleconomist.blogspot.com/2012/11/what-fiscal-cliff-means-for-middle-class.html">As I discussed then</a>,  the sequester&#8217;s discretionary budget cuts will be unambiguously bad for  the middle class. Now, Republicans are trying to convert the defense  cuts of the sequester into further slashing into middle class programs,  while President Obama has offered to convert Social Security&#8217;s inflation  adjustment to so-called &#8220;<a href="http://truth-out.org/news/item/14764-macho-men-social-security-and-the-chained-cpi">chained CPI</a>,&#8221;  which will slowly but relentlessly cut into benefits year after year  through the magic of compounding. According to Dean Baker at the link  above, the reduction would be about 0.3% per year, so benefits will be  3% lower after 10 years, 6% after 20 years, etc.</p>
<p>Considering how bad <a href="http://middleclasspoliticaleconomist.blogspot.com/2013/01/the-fiscal-cliff-and-coming-retirement.html">middle class retirement prospects</a> are already looking, the President&#8217;s offer would be disastrous for  millions if implemented. The right course of action is simple: cancel  the sequester, forget about cutting Social Security (which is not part  of the so-called debt problem anyway), and focus on jobs and growth. As  Paul Krugman <a href="http://books.wwnorton.com/books/detail.aspx?ID=4294971028">says</a>, &#8220;End this Depression Now!&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Saturday Mish wrote a <a href="http://globaleconomicanalysis.blogspot.com/2013/01/how-to-debate-paul-krugman-ask.html">really awful article</a> with those words in it&#8217;s title.</p>
<p>The article borrows these words and includes a quote from <a href="http://detlevschlichter.com/2012/05/how-to-debate-paul-krugman/">an even more awful article</a> by Austrian school economist and author <a href="http://detlevschlichter.com/about/">Detlev Schlichter</a>.  Part of that quote is presented here.<br />
<blockquote>What makes him [PK] so annoying is his unquestioning, reflexive and almost  childlike enthusiasm for state intervention, even in the face of its  obvious failure, and his apparent unwillingness to probe any deeper into  the real causes of our present economic problems or to show any  willingness to investigate the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of his  particular medicine.</p></blockquote>
<p>I want to  make something perfectly clear before we go any further.  It is fine to  disagree with Krugman, or me, or the Pope, or anyone else, as long as  you bring facts, data, and some basic skill in rational discourse.  What  is not fine is misrepresenting someone&#8217;s position and then holding the  misrepresentation up to ridicule.  That is both vile and stupid.</p>
<p>Back to the quote: does that sound anything like the Paul Krugman who puts his ideas <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/">out there for the world to see</a> on a daily basis?  What I see in Krugman is thoughtful analysis, and  deep probing into both the causes of our problems and the consequences  of economic policy decisions.  You don&#8217;t have to agree with his  assesments, but you cannot validly deny that he is making them.</p>
<p>When the opportunities smack me in the face like  this, I put on my <a href="http://jazzbumpa.blogspot.com/2010/01/deep-stupid-14.html"><u><i>Krugman Truth Squad</i> </u></a>hat.   Schlichter offers us a standard issue stale Austrian anti-Krugman  diatribe. You have to wonder if he has ever bothered to read anything  that Krugman has written.   His wordy, repetitive, rambling, semi-coherent, desperate-sounding  article &#8211; which I cannot recommend highly enough &#8211; is an impressive  exercise in partial-truths, distortions, make believe, and straw man  stuffing.  He then hints that we should go back to the gold standard and  totally unfettered free markets.</p>
<p>Schlichter lists Krugman&#8217;s alleged assumptions, condensed here:</p>
<blockquote><p>1)   Recessions, depressions and crises are the result of the unhampered market. <br />2)   The Great Depression was caused by uncontrolled markets.<br />3)    Recessions, depressions and crises are practically the result of one  problem: a lack of aggregate demand.  .  .  .   It is the role of  government to get people spending again. This is done  by printing money and causing inflation so that people spend. <br /> 4)   The Great Depression was solved by the government spending lots of money and the central bank printing lots of money.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let&#8217;s  pause here for a moment and set aside the redundancy.  I&#8217;m not sure  points 1 and 2 represent PK&#8217;s view with any degree of accuracy.   Certainly they are gross oversimplifications and neglect other factors.   But if they are true, then point 3 can&#8217;t be.  Let&#8217;s set that aside, as  well.  Points 3 and 4 are reasonably close to the truth, though if you  read the original, point 3 runs off the rails as it continues.  </p>
<p>From there it only gets worse.</p>
<blockquote><p>5)   This explains ALL economic problems.</p></blockquote>
<p>So,  according to Schlechter, Keynes taught, Krugman believes &#8211; and would  have us believe &#8211; that loose money policies and causing inflation are  the right policy measures not only for recessions, but for boom times,  and periods of inflation, hyper-inflation, stag-flation, or any other  problem you can think of.  Even I <a href="http://jazzbumpa.blogspot.com/2011/02/accidental-keynesians.html">know enough about Keynes</a> to call that out as false. </p>
<p>The  redundency continues to pile up.  I&#8217;ll extract one more point. [#&#8217;s  6,7, and 8 are repetitions of #4 with various degrees of elaboration and  snark.]</p>
<blockquote><p>7)   If after many rounds of money printing and deficit spending, there  is still a recession, then only one conclusion is permissible: There was  obviously not enough money printing and deficit spending. We need more  of it.</p></blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t claim to  know everything, but I&#8217;m not aware of any situation in recent history  that has played out like this, so it looks like a Schlichterian  fantasy.  In the post WW II era, the combination of loose money and  fiscal expansion has generally kept recessions rather short, leading to  V-shaped recoveries, and putting the brakes on too quickly has  occasionally led to a double dip.  England has recently experienced an <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/apr/25/uk-sinks-double-dip-recession-gdp">austerity-induced double dip recession</a>.   In the current U. S. doldrums, Krugman tells us fiscal frugality has  led to a slow and limping recovery.  This is credible since spending is  flat and GDP growth is anemic. [Graph 1]</p>

<div>Graph 1, Current Expenditures and GDP (log scale)</div>
<p>Has any modern major economy had a recession persist after &#8220;many rounds of money printing and deficit spending&#8221;?  Even in the Great Depression things <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/19/1933-and-all-that/">turned around pretty quickly</a> once New Deal policies were implemented.  But, as PK also tells us, recessions brought on by a financial crisis are <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/08/fact-checking-financial-recessions/">different from the typical post WW II recession</a>.</p>
<p>Schlichter doesn&#8217;t let up. Though this statement [emphasis added], &#8220;Krugman is the one who should be made to explain his policy  recommendations and who has to answer the criticism that <u><i>policies like  the ones he is recommending got us into this mess in the first place</i> </u>and  that <i><u>his policy ideas have been implemented for years to no effect</u></i>, at  least no positive effect.&#8221;  is hard to beat for sheer negation of reality [and for channeling Ron Paul],  the real capper is this: &#8220;Krugman is practicing Keynesianism as a religion.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is because of statements like this that I lose patience with people who use words like &#8220;<i>disingenuous</i>.&#8221; You can supply your own alternative vocabulary   Check Krugman&#8217;s Op-Eds and blog  posts, where he repeatedly demonstrates reality with <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/23/martin-wolf-hippie/">graphs and tables</a>, shows how <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/11/bleeding-europe/">austerity is failing right now</a> with real-world examples, and <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/30/is-our-austerians-learning/">admits it when he gets something wrong</a>.  When is the last time you saw a Krugman-hater do that?</p>
<p>Mish, to his eternal discredit, says of this nonsense: &#8221; Moreover, it appears to be 100% accurate.&#8221;</p>
<div>But, Mish continues, the real way to debate Krugman is demonstrated by Economist Hans Hermann-Hoppe in this one minute video.</div>
<p>This is genuinely awesome.   That an economist can be so thoroughly  wrong &#8211; wrong in general and wrong in every particular &#8211; about what  Keynesianism is and does, leaves me speechless, and that&#8217;s saying  something.</p>
<p>OK &#8211; almost speechless.  Any child can see  that the earth is flat and the sun revolves around it.  So let&#8217;s forget  the trivially unimportant technical  details and ask simple-minded, allegedly probing questions that in this  case are  totally unrelated not only to the policies Keynes and Krugman propose,  but to anything else in the real world, and then point and stare when  these questions cannot be answered &#8211; by anyone, while your minions nod  approvingly.</p>
<p>But would it work?  Mish concludes this way:</p>
<blockquote><p>Krugman would respond with incomprehensible gibberish &#8220;for wonks only&#8221;  as well as typical Keynesian nonsense about how paying people to dig  holes and other people to fill them up would start a chain reaction of  growth.</p></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>A child would see the answer was preposterous, but not a trained  economist, politician, or brainwashed academic. Paul Krugman, keynesian  economists in general, politicians wanting a free lunch, and most  academics are all incurable.</p></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>Nonetheless, Hans Hermann-Hoppe&#8217;s answer is indeed the correct one. By  asking questions a child will understand, some non-brainwashed people  will see Keynesian and Monetary stimulus for what they really are:  economic stupidity.</p></blockquote>
<p>In <a href="http://globaleconomicanalysis.blogspot.com/2013/01/libertarian-turned-keynesian-responds.html">a follow up article</a> [with a 5 point list that includes 2 naked assertion and 3  irrelevancies {seriously &#8211; Zimbabwe?!?}] Mish makes it clear that in his view monetary  and fiscal stimulus are BOTH stupid.   So, at this point it looks as if he &#8211;  with his straw man army and blatant intellectual nihilism &#8211;  and I have  devolved into a schoolyard game of calling each other <i>stupid</i>.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;m quite sure Mish is not stupid, and I&#8217;m fairly certain I&#8217;m not  either.  The real questions are these: who is paying attention to  reality, whose policies make things better or worse <i>in a given situation</i> [absolutism, anyone?] and whose concepts have had some predictive power  over the last several years.  [Here&#8217;s a hint:<a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2012/12/when-will-robert-murphy-conclude-that-he-just-does-not-know-what-he-is-doing.html"> it&#8217;s not the Austerians</a>.]</p>
<p>So, maybe a better way to phrase it is, &#8220;<a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/28/failures/"><u><i>Who is practicing their economics as a religion</i></u></a>?&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I watched NBC Nightly News with Brian Williams last night.  Big Mistake. </p>
<p>Big mistake. </p>
<p>Because now I’m really confused.  I was pretty darn sure until then that “raising the debt ceiling” meant allowing the Treasury Department to pay financial obligations already incurred, such as interest on bonds, Medicare payments, and contract obligations, and to allow continued payments for ongoing financial obligations such as Social Security payments, Veterans’ benefits, and salary payments to federal employees, some of whose jobs are sort of important.  (Think: air traffic controllers.)  I had thought that because I had followed the recurring-crisis news reports about it since 2011, when the first of the crises began.  And because Obama had actually explained it in his Jan. 14 press conference. </p>
<p>But now, well, I think I might have misunderstood, because after Williams reported that the Senate yesterday had approved the House bill to “suspend” the debt ceiling through May 19, he added, shaking his head in disapproval, something like: “This is Washington’s version of kicking the can down the road.  Our debt is now more than a trillion dollars.”</p>
<p>I suggest that next time Williams is onboard one of NBC’s corporate jets, he might read, say, Paul Krugman’s <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/01/opinion/krugman-looking-for-mister-goodpain.html?_r=0">column in today’s New York Times</a>.  It doesn’t explain the difference between the debt ceiling statute and budget-appropriations statutes, so Williams will continue to conflate the two until he digs deeper and reads earlier Krugman columns or other mainstream-media articles that did that.  But it does (yet again)&#8211;<a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2013/01/paul-ryan-says-taxes-should-be-raised.html">to borrow a phrase from Paul Ryan</a> in his Meet the Press interview aired last Sunday&#8211;debate the efficacy of Keynesian economics, and whether anti-Keynesian “austerity” measures reduce or instead increase national debt in real terms and, more important (although Williams apparently doesn’t know this), decrease or instead increase debt relative to GDP.</p>
<p>But if he is going to wait until he’s up there in the air in that Learjet to read the Krugman column, I hope the trip occurs before May 20.  </p>
<p>&#8212;-</p>
<p>UPDATE: Additional recommended reading for Brian Williams: Joe Scarborough, Paul Krugman and the economist-pundit divide on debt and deficits, Neil Irwin, Washington Post, yesterday. </p>
<p>Scarborough, though, at least knows what the debt ceiling law is, and that it isn’t the same as budget-appropriations legislation.  He does, after all, work for MSNBC, not, say, NBC News. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://notthetreasuryview.blogspot.co.uk/2012/06/macroeconomics-what-is-it-good-for.html">Jonathon Portes</a> on macroeconomics and the deficit:<br />
<blockquote>As we all know, since then both the US and UK have had deficits running at historically extremely high levels, and long-term interest rates at historic lows: as Krugman has repeatedly pointed out, the (IS-LM) textbook has been spot on.  Empirically (and theoretically) well-founded? Definitely.  As Simon Wren-Lewis points out <a href="http://mainlymacro.blogspot.co.uk/2012/06/teaching-macroeconomics-after-crisis.html">here</a>. Recent developments have in many ways been a vindication of the basic Keynesian model that lies at the heart of any undergraduate macro course.</p>
<p>The policy implications are of course not unambiguous &#8211; the conclusion isn&#8217;t &#8220;borrow as much as possible&#8221; &#8211; but the implication that, when you have excess (desired) private saving, government borrowing won&#8217;t push up long-term interest rates is obviously important. So score one for macro 101. Of course, there were economists, not just people like Ferguson, arguing the contrary in public; but generally not on the basis of a different analytical framework, with the result that their analysis was confused at best. See for example my debate with David Smith <a href="http://notthetreasuryview.blogspot.co.uk/2012/01/david-smith-finds-me-puzzling.html">here</a>, where David begins by explaining that low interest rates reflect &#8220;market confidence&#8221;, and ends up by saying that they reflect the &#8220;fragility of the banking system.&#8221;</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Of course, some countries &#8211; all, not coincidentally, members of the eurozone &#8211; that have high deficits have indeed seen interest rates soar. So a second, and equally policy-relevant, example is &#8220;what drives the possibility of a sovereign debt crisis?&#8221;.  Here the economic theory was set out very clearly by Paul De Grauwe, of the University of Leeuwen, for example <a href="http://www.voxeu.org/index.php?q=node/6484">here</a> (and versions of this paper were circulating as far back as mid-2010):</p></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>This separation of decisions [in a monetary union] – debt issuance on the one hand and monetary control on the other – creates a critical vulnerability; a loss of market confidence can unleash a self-fulfilling spiral that drives the country into default.  Suppose that investors begin to fear a default by, say, Spain. They sell Spanish government bonds and this raises the interest rate. If this goes far enough, the Spanish government will experience a liquidity crisis, i.e. it cannot obtain funds to roll over its debt at reasonable interest rates&#8230; </p></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>It doesn’t work like this for countries capable of issuing debt in their own currency. To see this, re-run the Spanish example for the UK. If investors began to fear that the UK government might default on its debt, they would sell their UK government bonds and this would drive up the interest rate. After selling these bonds, these investors would have pounds that most probably they would want to get rid of by selling them in the foreign-exchange market. The price of the pound would drop until somebody else would be willing to buy these pounds. The effect of this mechanism is that the pounds would remain bottled up in the UK money market to be invested in UK assets.</p></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>The economic theory underlying this verbal explanation is clear and convincing. And so is the empirical evidence.  Not only have Japan, the US and the UK all failed to experience self-fulfilling liquidity crises resulting from their very large deficits, so has<u><a href="http://mainlymacro.blogspot.co.uk/2011/12/there-but-for-austerity-go-us.html"> every other developed country</a> </u>that issues debt in its own currency.  </p></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>This contrasts, of course, with the eurozone experience; and it is precisely what theory predicts. It is quite rare that an economic theory &#8211; macroeconomic or microeconomic &#8211; is so clearly and comprehensively vindicated so quickly. Again, the policy implications are not that we (or the US) can or should expand our fiscal deficit without limit. But they are very clear that we should ignore the <a href="http://notthetreasuryview.blogspot.co.uk/2012/02/moodys-downgrade-both-osborne-and-balls.html">ratings agencies,</a>  and that <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-16340259">anybody</a> who is still arguing that the current path of fiscal consolidation &#8211; and the economic damage it has done &#8211; was necessary to preserve &#8220;market confidence&#8221; has chosen to ignore the evidence. </p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://econospeak.blogspot.com/2012/05/main-point.html">Peter Dorman</a> at <i>Econospeak</i> brings us another reminder about policy decisions on the economy.  Reposted from Econospeak:</p>
<p><strong>The Main Point</strong></p>
<p>Macroeconomics is complicated and political economy is devilish, so it is easy to get lost in the details.  From time to time, it’s good to come up for air—to remember what the fundamental issue is.  In a way, the debate over structural versus cyclical factors invites us to do just that.  </p>
<p>Suppose the current recession/depression is mainly structural.  Suppose it is due to an immense misallocation of capital and labor, a failure to foresee what our economy would really demand in the years ahead.  According to this story, we have trained too many masons and anthropologists and invested in too many building cranes and liberal arts colleges, and it will take years to shift our human and produced resources to more valuable pursuits.  (Actually, I think there continues to be an enormous misallocation of investment, but this will become apparent only when the threat of global warming is taken seriously.)  If the structuralist story is right, the ongoing slump is necessary and unavoidable and will end only when we have fashioned the resources for producing the right stuff.  </p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />If the cyclical story is predominately true, however, we have neither the wrong people nor the wrong capital stock.  We have all the ingredients it takes to have a vibrant economy that can fully employ our populations and generate a standard of living that surpasses what we had in the past and that keeps growing further.  But think about it: if we have the wherewithal to resume prosperity, what holds us back?  And why should rational people accept any excuses for policies that delay it?  </p>
<p>Repeat: we have everything we need, right now, to restart our economies.  All the unemployment, the hardship, the lost opportunities are unnecessary.  That’s the main point.  </p>
<p>The secondary point is about the why.  There are ultimately two reasons why economies like ours get stuck in a cyclical rut.  The first is that there is a reinforcing cycle of insufficient demand and insufficient investment.  This is where standard countercyclical policy comes in: through fiscal deficits the government increases demand on its own initiative, and through monetary easing an impetus is added to investment.  We are near the limit of what easing can do (diminishing returns to the QE’s), but not anywhere near the limit of fiscal expansion.  </p>
<p>The second reason arises in balance sheet recessions: too much private borrowing has taken place, debtors find it difficult to sustain debt service, and both debtors and creditors retrench.  In this case, which is ours, the essential problem is that fulfillment of claims on wealth—both credit claims and equity claims on debt-related assets—interferes with the conditions required for restarting growth.  In other words, the shadow of past wealth creation is depriving new wealth creation of sunlight.  While respecting wealth claims is desirable during normal times, since it supports long-term planning, there come episodes in which a choice must be made between the past and the future.  This is such a time.  Wealth claims need to be trimmed, quickly and sufficiently, in order to reduce leverage and permit economies to return to growth.  We shouldn’t forget the main point, which is that economic growth produces the stuff of which real wealth is made, while satisfying the claims inherited from yesterday only allocates this stuff.  (And in a slumping economy the claims can’t be honored anyway.)  </p>
<p>If you accept the cyclical story, and the evidence certainly weighs in its favor, you should not accept another month, much less year after year, of excuses for austerity.</p>

<blockquote><div>&#8230; and amid growing concern in Europe that austerity aimed at cutting ballooning deficits may also be choking growth.  </div>
<div>A dozen European Union leaders, including British Prime Minister David Cameron and Italian Premier Mario Monti, called Monday for an open-markets strategy to stimulate growth and jolt the region out of its economic doldrums.</div>
<div></div>
<div>&#8220;We meet in Brussels at a perilous moment for economies across Europe,&#8221; the leaders said. &#8220;Growth has stalled. Unemployment is rising. Citizens and businesses are facing their toughest conditions for years. &#8221;  </div>

<div>Of course their solution is &#8220;Free the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clash_of_the_Titans_%282010_film%29">Kraken!*</a>&#8220;: </div>

<div></div>
<div>How scared are they?  They are this frightened: </div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><div>&#8220;Implicit guarantees to always rescue banks, which distort the single market, should be reduced,&#8221; the letter said. &#8220;Banks, not taxpayers, should be responsible for bearing the costs of the risks they take.&#8221;  </div>

<div> It is a simple fact of life that business is more prone to hire if it is allowed to fire. The major risk to business investment, which is that of an ongoing workforce liability, is thereby removed.  </div>
<div></div>
<div>Vince Cable&#8217;s proposed shake-up of employment law is in truth of much more importance to the future of the UK economy than faffing around either with credit easing or squandering £12bn on a temporary tax cut. It&#8217;s vitally important that the task is not ducked.</div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>And yet, considering the 12&#8217;s concern about austerity to cut debt and banks taking the hit, there was this today: </div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><div>22.02 Here we go. Eurozone ministers agree on ways to cut Greek debt to 123/124pc of GDP by 2020, aiming to go close to 120pc. Eurozone in talks with representatives of private sector about finding further debt relief. Issue of ECB forgoing profits on its holdings of Greek bonds remains a sticking point.  </div>

<div></div>
<div>Coming soon to a theater near you!  The Son of Austerity.</div>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Greece and what is happening to it is not getting enough attention.  What is happening there, in my opinion is an example of the human race at it&#8217;s worse.  I do not see the implementation of austerity as an experiment.  I see it as just one more step by those in the world controlling banking to mold the world into its self image.</p>
<p>This <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/video/2012/02/15">is a link to</a> an 11 minute interview of <a href="http://michael-hudson.com/about/">Michael Hudson</a>:  Michael Hudson is President of The Institute for the Study of Long-Term  Economic Trends (ISLET), a Wall Street Financial Analyst, Distinguished  Research Professor of Economics at the University of Missouri, Kansas  City&#8230;  </p>
<p>In this interview, Prof. Hudson suggests that Greece is the test to see how far the world&#8217;s money people can push in preparations for further advancement within the EU.  Interestingly he notes, that in the US, because we privatized our utilities years ago, we are not seeing the same drive of austerity as we are seeing in Europe, including England.  Though we should not be complaisant.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>A good friend and I got into an email debate.  He sent me the latest message regarding how wonderful it is that Florida is going to be drug testing welfare recipients.  I responded that I&#8217;ll consider the policy when we start testing all the CEO&#8217;s who get welfare for their sector of the economy, the lawyers, judges and all country club members.   </div>
<div></div>
<div>I also noted welfare is not the problem  He noted it&#8217;s not “the” problem, but it is “a” problem and he knows this from talking to people.  I know of welfare too.  I have served on two nonprofit boards, one for substance abuse and the other The Providence Center.  My family adopted a family when I was in junior high.  We had foster children.  I was a day counselor for 2 weeks in the summer of &#8217;73 for 7 to 12 year olds from 3 of the most horrible housing developments in the city of Providence.  We had the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchman_Institute">“Institute”</a> literally right around the corner from where I lived.  My daughter is doing a year with <a href="http://www.nw.org/network/index.asp">NeighborWorks America</a>.  </div>
<div></div>
<div>Welfare is not the problem.  But, my friend is a very smart person and an engineer, so I needed some numbers.  Using <a href="http://www.usgovernmentdebt.us/year_spending_2008USbn_13bs1n_40#usgs302">this site</a> I checked out what the ratio of spending on Family and Children and Housing is to our GDP. I used GDP and not the overall budget because hey, we all worked to earn that money and it might as well be used for something that is heart warming.  The following numbers are total national spending (Fed, State, Local).</div>
<div></div>
<p><a name="more"></a>
<div>The year 1962 is the first year that there is spending listed for both Family and Children and Housing.  Prior to that only Housing is listed as having spending. For 1962, the combined total ratio was 0.0027.  That is 0.27% of our GDP was spend on families, children and housing.  I started with 1970 and went forward using the endings of the presidential terms starting with 1980.</div>
<div>1970:   0.0035</div>
<div>1980:   0.0092</div>
<div>1988:   0.0093</div>
<div>1992:   0.0134</div>
<div>2000:   0.0092</div>
<div>2008:   0.0097</div>
<div>2010:   0.0141</div>
<div></div>
<div>First of all, these are miniscule percentages of our GDP.  Second, it sure looks to me like the best way to solve the “welfare problem” is to solve the economic problem.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Of course, this means nothing if we don&#8217;t have other government spending patterns to compare too.  I mean, how do we know if welfare is “out of control” if we can&#8217;t compare it to other spending?  The same data set has two other categories: General Government and Other Spending.  You can click on each to see the sub categories.  But, just so you know General Government consists of Executive and Legislative organ, Financial and General services.  Other does not include: Pensions, Education, Health, Defense, Protection, Transportation or interest.  Other is just that: Other.  Here is how the numbers look.</div>
<div></div>
<div><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-P_hSs7IusGU/TziVaARYHFI/AAAAAAAAAR4/OaEyKcOa2n0/s1600/Welfare+chart+post+2-12-12.JPG" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-P_hSs7IusGU/TziVaARYHFI/AAAAAAAAAR4/OaEyKcOa2n0/s320/Welfare+chart+post+2-12-12.JPG" width="320"></a></div>
<div>  </div>
<div>This is how the numbers flow as log function.</div>
<div><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-q_Ww0EO90A8/TziVdkLMeTI/AAAAAAAAASA/vycHbhD4Ud0/s1600/Welfare+graph+post+2-12-12.JPG" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="245" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-q_Ww0EO90A8/TziVdkLMeTI/AAAAAAAAASA/vycHbhD4Ud0/s320/Welfare+graph+post+2-12-12.JPG" width="320"></a></div>
<div></div>
<p>  
<div>Call me stupid, but it looks to me like what we spend on welfare is not much more than what the  government is spending on just doing the government thingy, unless of course people can&#8217;t get a job.  Interestingly enough, the share of GDP spent on welfare in 1992 and 2010 is the same.  In fact, at the peak of unemployment of the 2001 recession which was 2003, we spent just 0.0098 on welfare.    </div>
<div></div>
<div>Here is another comparison.  In 2009 we spent $167 billion on Family/Children and Housing.  That year, we also spent $161 billion in the Other category of “Economic Affairs”.  I don&#8217;t know what that is, but if it has anything to do with what we are experiencing I don&#8217;t think we got our money&#8217;s worth.  This item went from -7.0 in 1997 to 7.8 in 2002 to 17.5 in 2005 to 1.3 in 2007 back to 17.7 in 2008.  It landed at -79.7 in 2010.  Hummmmmmmmm.  I think Glen Beck would like this category.  You know, who&#8217;s been playing with the money in the cookie jar?  In fact, why did we not know that a cookie jar exists?  </div>
<div></div>
<div>It doesn&#8217;t make me feel good to think that we spend about as much on the top office operations of this country as we spend on helping people.  Think about it.  What percentage of the “welfare problem” do</div>
<div></div>
<div>you believe is a problem? You know those drug addled lazy moochers who are preventing all us moral and hardworking folks from living the good life of our congress persons.  Be careful now.  This is a trick question.  See, it won&#8217;t take much of a “problem” subtracted from what we spend to find ourselves spending less to take care of families and their children than we spend on the top office operations in this nation.  That&#8217;s just plain being cheap.  Down right, out and out cheap SOB&#8217;s even if we leave in all of the &#8220;problem&#8221;.     </div>
