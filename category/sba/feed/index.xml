<p><a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2009/08/banks-turn-up-noses-at-lending-to-small.html" target="_blank">H/T Naked Capitalism</a> for this <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/13/business/smallbusiness/13small.html?_r=1&#038;ref=business" target="_blank">New York Times article</a> concerning the loan program established in May to help small businesses as part of the stimulus program.</p>
<p>
<blockquote>With $255 million, the program is prepared to make about 10,000 loans of up to $35,000 each. As of Monday, the agency reported that only 1,127 loans, totaling $36.8 million, had been extended.</p>
<p>While the agency maintains that the program is on track, some in the banking industry say the banks are moving slowly because they have little incentive. “There’s not a lot of profit motive in a $35,000 loan stretched over six years,” said Paul Merski, chief economist for the Independent Community Bankers of America, a trade association.</p>
<p>Bob Seiwert, of the Center for Commercial Lending and Business Banking at the American Bankers Association, says “stringent underwriting standards” will require as much work as larger loans, making these even less economical.</p></blockquote>
