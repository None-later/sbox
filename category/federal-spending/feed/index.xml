				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is more or less relevant to <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2013/01/john-boehner-says-defense-spending-is.html">Beverly&#8217;s post from earlier today</a>.</p>
<div>How many times have you heard Boehner, McConnell, Ryan or one of the legion of right-wing talking heads say, &#8220;<i>We don&#8217;t have a revenue problem, we have a spending problem</i>?&#8221;  I refuted that lie repeatedly in <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/09/yes-right-wing-lies-when-they-say-obama.html">this AB post</a> and at the included links.   But this is one of those zombie ideas that simply will not stay in the grave.  </div>
<p>Therefore,  some prominent voices have found it necessary to sing out again against  the lie. I will add my humble quavery baritone to the chorus.</p>
<p>Here in Graph 1 is <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2013/01/government-spending-down-obama-era">Kevin Drum demonstrating</a> how Real Government Expenditures per Capita have changed under the last three presidents.<br />
<blockquote>What  we have isn&#8217;t a spending problem. That&#8217;s under control. What we have is  a problem with Republicans not wanting to pay the bills they themselves  were largely responsible for running up.</p></blockquote>
<p>
<div><a href="http://www.motherjones.com/files/blog_government_expenditures_clinton_bush_obama.jpg"><img border="0" height="212" src="http://www.motherjones.com/files/blog_government_expenditures_clinton_bush_obama.jpg" width="400"></a></div>
<div> Graph 1, Real Government Expenditures per Capita</div>
<p>By  using real [inflation adjusted] and per capita numbers, Drum has  introduced a couple of denominators.  Real expenses per cap is a  rational way to display the data, but not the only way. So lest someone  cry out about that ol&#8217; devil denominator, let&#8217;s have a different look.</p>
<p>Via <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/23/martin-wolf-hippie/">Paul Krugman </a>we  get Graph 2 and Graph 3, from FRED, showing total Government  expenditures and Federal Government expenditures, respectively, on log  scales.</p>
<p>
<div><a href="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2013/01/23/opinion/012313krugman1/012313krugman1-blog480.png"><img border="0" height="315" src="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2013/01/23/opinion/012313krugman1/012313krugman1-blog480.png" width="400"></a></div>
<div>Graph 2. Government Total Expenditures</div>
<div><a href="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2013/01/23/opinion/012313krugman2/012313krugman2-blog480.png"><img border="0" height="315" src="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2013/01/23/opinion/012313krugman2/012313krugman2-blog480.png" width="400"></a></div>
<div>Graph 3, Federal Government Total Expenditures</div>
<p>
<blockquote>Yes, you can argue that spending was growing too fast under Bush,  although it’s funny how few deficit scolds saw fit to mention that at  the time. Or you can say that you just want less spending, although as  always people who say this tend to be short on specifics. But the  narrative that says that spending has surged under Obama is just wrong –  what we’ve actually seen is a slowdown at exactly the time when, for  macroeconomic reasons, we should have been spending more.</p></blockquote>
<p>Remember,  a log scale represents constant growth as a straight line, and zero  growth as a horizontal line.  So, in pure dollar numbers, spending  hasn&#8217;t quite declined, but it has stagnated to almost zero growth.   Hence Drum&#8217;s decline in inflation adjusted, per capita terms.</p>
<p>In  Graph 4, we get one more longer range look, using Krugman&#8217;s data  series, this time on a linear scale.  Also presented is the difference  between the two, which is the amount of spending by state and local  governments.</p>
<p>
<div><a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fredgraph.png?g=eRU"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fredgraph.png?g=eRU" width="400"></a></div>
<div> Graph 4, Government Spending at Different Levels</div>
<p> The  red line is total spending at all levels of governemnt, the blue line  is federal only, and the green line is the difference, state and local  spending.  Note that the green line flattens early in the recession</p>
<p>To  bring things full circle, Graph 5 shows Federal Government current  receipts.  Look at this and tell me we don&#8217;t have a revenue problem.</p>
<p>
<div><a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fredgraph.png?g=eS4"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fredgraph.png?g=eS4" width="400"></a></div>
<div>Graph 5, Federal Government Current Receipts</div>
<p>To  drive this point home, Graph 6 shows Federal Receipts as a fraction of  GDP.  The purpose of the ratio is to provide context, using GDP as a  proxy for the size of the economy.</p>
<p>
<div><a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fredgraph.png?g=eS7"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fredgraph.png?g=eS7" width="400"></a></div>
<div>Graph 6, Federal Receipts as a fraction of GDP</div>
<p>As you can see, revenues/GDP are in a historically low range.</p>
<p>Conclusions:<br />&#8211; Federal spending is flat in nominal dollar terms.<br />&#8211; Federal spending is declining when adjusted for inflation and population growth.<br />&#8211; Federal revenues are far below trend lines based on any historical reference you chose.<br />&#8211; Federal revenues as a fraction of GDP are historically low.<br />&#8211; The Republican claim that we have a spending problem not a revenue problem is simply a lie, on both counts.<br />&#8211; Disproportional spending growth has only occurred under two presidents: Republicans Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush.  </p>
<p>The simple fact is we have a revenue problem, not a spending problem.</p>
<p>Why do Republicans lie?</p>
<p>The truth is hostile to their agenda.  <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2013/01/paul-krugman-deficit-hawks-down.html">PK Explains</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over at <a href="http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2012/09/democrats-day-2.html">Plain Blog</a>, an anonymous wing nut made this off-topic comment.<br />
<blockquote>Now, yes, Bill Clinton and his 2000 federal spending level of 18% of GDP  doesn&#8217;t put him on the fringe, which makes it surprising that you  lefties are celebrating him, even as you hysterically condemn anybody  who resists the Left&#8217;s current  massive  spending levels, which are  nearly 50% greater than Clinton&#8217;s and are spending the nation into  debt  obvlivion.</p></blockquote>
<p>This once again raises the regressive canard that Obama has been a profligate and fiscally irresponsible spender.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s have a look.</p>
<p>Here is a graph of current expenditures that took place in the years of the current century.</p>
<p>
<div><a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fredgraph.png?g=agQ"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fredgraph.png?g=agQ" width="400"></a></div>
<p>First  observation is that anon&#8217;s math isn&#8217;t very good.  Current expenditures  are roughly 100% greater than when Clinton left office, not a mere 50%.</p>
<p>Second  observation is that the vast majority of that increase &#8211; from about  $1900 billion to about $3200 billion &#8211; took place under the previous  administration.</p>
<p>Third observation is that the bulk of  the Obama increase occurred during the recession &#8211; as it should &#8211; from a  bit under $3200 billion to a bit under $3600 billion.  Since then it&#8217;s  crept up to about $3800 billion, and has recently flat-lined.</p>
<p>A  more subtle point is that spending, like many time series data sets,  increases exponentially over time, following population growth.  So,  saying that a value at time B is some percentage greater than the value  at time A communicates essentially zero information.  Context matters. </p>
<p>Let&#8217;s look at expenditures in terms of year over year increase.</p>
<p>
<div><a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fredgraph.png?g=agZ"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fredgraph.png?g=agZ" width="400"></a></div>
<p>Yep, there was a big increase in 2009 and 2010, as social safety net programs kicked in.</p>
<p>Since  then, expenditure growth fell precipitously and now has actually gone  negative.  The last time that happened was in the Eisenhower  administration.  Clearly, Obama has not been profligate.  Would it be an  exaggeration to say he&#8217;s been miserly?</p>
<p>Bill Clinton  did a great job of exposing Republican lies in his speech at the  Democratic convention last night.  But really, it&#8217;s easy.  All you have  to do to refute a regressive is have a quick look at facts and data.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>by Kenneth Thomas</p>
<p>Hilarious twist on &#8220;You didn&#8217;t build that!&#8221; UPDATED</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.theatlanticwire.com/politics/2012/08/sher-valenzuela-didnt-build-her-own-website-and-why-it-may-haunt-gop/56227/">Atlantic Wire</a> (via @NoBigGovDuh) has a great story on the dishonesty of Mitt Romney&#8217;s &#8220;You didn&#8217;t build that&#8221; ads. It turns out that at the Republican convention on Tuesday night, they plan to ramp it up again with a speech by a small business owner from Delaware, Sher Valenzuela, telling everyone how she did build it, not government.    </p>
<p>Only one small problem. Actually, two.    </p>
<p>First, Valenzuela&#8217;s business, First State Manufacturing, &#8220;received more than $2 million in federal loans and more than $15 million in federal contracts over the years,&#8221; according to the article. This included Small Business Administration money very early on, as well as federal disaster relief loans after 9/11 and loans from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. So, beyond the fact that she obviously didn&#8217;t build the roads and bridges and other infrastructure&#8211;which the President was actually referring to in his speech Romney has so grossly twisted in his ads&#8211;she benefited mightily from more direct government aid. Even a month ago, we knew that lots of companies Romney promoted with this tagline <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2012/07/romney-didnt-build-that-fail">actually had gotten</a> direct government support, too.    </p>
<p>Second, a fast-thinking Redditor figured out that Valenzuela had not claimed <a href="http://www.firststatemanufacturing.com/">www.firststatemanufacturing.com</a>  for her website, and constructed his own parody of her there (h/t @NoBigGovDuh and Atlantic Wire). On the landing page we see Valenzuela displayed next to the words:    </p>
<p><img alt="" border="0" height="87" src="http://www.firststatemanufacturing.com/files/8913/4604/1899/sociallydisadvantagedregular.png" width="400"></p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>This refers to the company&#8217;s designation by Delaware in 2000 as a Disadvantaged Business Enterprise. As the &#8220;<a href="http://www.firststatemanufacturing.com//index.php?cID=118">About</a>&#8221; page concludes,<br />
<blockquote>First State Manufacturing is proud of our heritage, and thankful for the help that government has given us along the way. Not to mention the current help government provides! We believe that to say otherwise would be ungrateful, hypocritical, and unpatriotic.</p></blockquote>
<p>We&#8217;ll see on Tuesday night.  </p>
<p>(For the humor-challenged out there, remember, this is not her site and not her words. It&#8217;s a parody.)  </p>
<p>UPDATE: Here is something from Valenzuela&#8217;s <i>own website</i>: &#8220;<a href="http://www.firststatemfg.com/shopexd.asp?id=15">Get federal dollars by being a minority-owned business.</a>&#8221; Hypocrisy, anyone?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>A good friend and I got into an email debate.  He sent me the latest message regarding how wonderful it is that Florida is going to be drug testing welfare recipients.  I responded that I&#8217;ll consider the policy when we start testing all the CEO&#8217;s who get welfare for their sector of the economy, the lawyers, judges and all country club members.   </div>
<div></div>
<div>I also noted welfare is not the problem  He noted it&#8217;s not “the” problem, but it is “a” problem and he knows this from talking to people.  I know of welfare too.  I have served on two nonprofit boards, one for substance abuse and the other The Providence Center.  My family adopted a family when I was in junior high.  We had foster children.  I was a day counselor for 2 weeks in the summer of &#8217;73 for 7 to 12 year olds from 3 of the most horrible housing developments in the city of Providence.  We had the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchman_Institute">“Institute”</a> literally right around the corner from where I lived.  My daughter is doing a year with <a href="http://www.nw.org/network/index.asp">NeighborWorks America</a>.  </div>
<div></div>
<div>Welfare is not the problem.  But, my friend is a very smart person and an engineer, so I needed some numbers.  Using <a href="http://www.usgovernmentdebt.us/year_spending_2008USbn_13bs1n_40#usgs302">this site</a> I checked out what the ratio of spending on Family and Children and Housing is to our GDP. I used GDP and not the overall budget because hey, we all worked to earn that money and it might as well be used for something that is heart warming.  The following numbers are total national spending (Fed, State, Local).</div>
<div></div>
<p><a name="more"></a>
<div>The year 1962 is the first year that there is spending listed for both Family and Children and Housing.  Prior to that only Housing is listed as having spending. For 1962, the combined total ratio was 0.0027.  That is 0.27% of our GDP was spend on families, children and housing.  I started with 1970 and went forward using the endings of the presidential terms starting with 1980.</div>
<div>1970:   0.0035</div>
<div>1980:   0.0092</div>
<div>1988:   0.0093</div>
<div>1992:   0.0134</div>
<div>2000:   0.0092</div>
<div>2008:   0.0097</div>
<div>2010:   0.0141</div>
<div></div>
<div>First of all, these are miniscule percentages of our GDP.  Second, it sure looks to me like the best way to solve the “welfare problem” is to solve the economic problem.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Of course, this means nothing if we don&#8217;t have other government spending patterns to compare too.  I mean, how do we know if welfare is “out of control” if we can&#8217;t compare it to other spending?  The same data set has two other categories: General Government and Other Spending.  You can click on each to see the sub categories.  But, just so you know General Government consists of Executive and Legislative organ, Financial and General services.  Other does not include: Pensions, Education, Health, Defense, Protection, Transportation or interest.  Other is just that: Other.  Here is how the numbers look.</div>
<div></div>
<div><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-P_hSs7IusGU/TziVaARYHFI/AAAAAAAAAR4/OaEyKcOa2n0/s1600/Welfare+chart+post+2-12-12.JPG" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-P_hSs7IusGU/TziVaARYHFI/AAAAAAAAAR4/OaEyKcOa2n0/s320/Welfare+chart+post+2-12-12.JPG" width="320"></a></div>
<div>  </div>
<div>This is how the numbers flow as log function.</div>
<div><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-q_Ww0EO90A8/TziVdkLMeTI/AAAAAAAAASA/vycHbhD4Ud0/s1600/Welfare+graph+post+2-12-12.JPG" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="245" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-q_Ww0EO90A8/TziVdkLMeTI/AAAAAAAAASA/vycHbhD4Ud0/s320/Welfare+graph+post+2-12-12.JPG" width="320"></a></div>
<div></div>
<p>  
<div>Call me stupid, but it looks to me like what we spend on welfare is not much more than what the  government is spending on just doing the government thingy, unless of course people can&#8217;t get a job.  Interestingly enough, the share of GDP spent on welfare in 1992 and 2010 is the same.  In fact, at the peak of unemployment of the 2001 recession which was 2003, we spent just 0.0098 on welfare.    </div>
<div></div>
<div>Here is another comparison.  In 2009 we spent $167 billion on Family/Children and Housing.  That year, we also spent $161 billion in the Other category of “Economic Affairs”.  I don&#8217;t know what that is, but if it has anything to do with what we are experiencing I don&#8217;t think we got our money&#8217;s worth.  This item went from -7.0 in 1997 to 7.8 in 2002 to 17.5 in 2005 to 1.3 in 2007 back to 17.7 in 2008.  It landed at -79.7 in 2010.  Hummmmmmmmm.  I think Glen Beck would like this category.  You know, who&#8217;s been playing with the money in the cookie jar?  In fact, why did we not know that a cookie jar exists?  </div>
<div></div>
<div>It doesn&#8217;t make me feel good to think that we spend about as much on the top office operations of this country as we spend on helping people.  Think about it.  What percentage of the “welfare problem” do</div>
<div></div>
<div>you believe is a problem? You know those drug addled lazy moochers who are preventing all us moral and hardworking folks from living the good life of our congress persons.  Be careful now.  This is a trick question.  See, it won&#8217;t take much of a “problem” subtracted from what we spend to find ourselves spending less to take care of families and their children than we spend on the top office operations in this nation.  That&#8217;s just plain being cheap.  Down right, out and out cheap SOB&#8217;s even if we leave in all of the &#8220;problem&#8221;.     </div>

<br />If these words translate to actions in the Congress on emergency aid, I believe it is a significant departure from past policies.  And Virginia, Cantor&#8217;s home state, is predicted to be impacted.  We will know soon enough if political capital is spent on this idea.<br />
<br />
<blockquote>A spokesperson for House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-VA) said that if there is any damage caused by Hurricane Irene requiring federal disaster funding, the money would have to be balanced out by spending cuts elsewhere in government. </p>
<p>&#8220;We aren&#8217;t going to speculate on damage before it happens, period,&#8221; his spokesperson Laena Fallon told TalkingPointsMemo. &#8220;But, as you know, Eric has consistently said that additional funds for federal disaster relief ought to be offset with spending cuts.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Guest post by <strong>Steve Roth</strong></p>
<p><strong>Oh Yeah: Crowding Out Has Been a <em>Huge</em> Problem</strong></p>
<div>Cross-posted at <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/?p=3586">Asymptosis</a>size=&#8221;2&#8243;></p>
<p>Right-wing economists love to claim that government spending &#8220;crowds out&#8221; private spending, especially investment spending on fixed assets. It&#8217;s probably true at some level and in some situations.</p>
<p>But if it was true for postwar America, you&#8217;d expect to see some evidence in the historical data, right?</p>
<p>Not so much:</p>
<p><img title="Investment Shares" alt="" src="http://www.asymptosis.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Investment-Shares.png" width="600" height="449"></p>
<p>Note: Government includes all levels &#8212; federal, state, and local.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />The investment share of government, ex-defense, fell by 29% from the 60s to the 80s, while the share devoted to business increased 18% (28% from the 50s to the 80s) &#8212; the very period when the blossoming New Deal programs and Johnson&#8217;s Great Society were supposedly creating Leviathan, embodied.</p>
<p>Those changes in share percentages don&#8217;t really put across the magnitude of the change, though. Business investment started at a much higher level, so the absolute increase in business investment utterly dwarfs all the other changes.</p>
<p>Curiously (given the right-wing narrative) the business share flattened out once we started feeling the manifestly salutary effects of the Reaganomics world view. It actually declined slightly under Dubya and six years of unfettered Republican control. Go figure.</p>
<p>Defense investment has plummeted since the 50s (and &#8212; naturally &#8212; the 40s) &#8212; a 31% decline in its share from the 60s to the 80s, 58% from the 50s to the 80s, and <em>78% </em>from the 50s to the 00s.</p>
<p>(Note: &#8220;domestic&#8221; assets are those located in the U.S. &#8212; except that government assets include U.S. military installations, embassies, and consulates worldwide. So this rapid decline may represent a worldwide construction binge in the 50s and 60s which was largely completed by the 70s. Defense investment generally includes much higher proportions of spending on structures &#8212; this was especially true in the 50s and 60s &#8212; compared to business investment, which devotes much, and increasingly, more to equipment and software.)</p>
<p>Wondering what caused Tyler Cowen&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Great-Stagnation-Low-Hanging-Eventually-ebook/dp/B004H0M8QS">Great Stagnation</a> (the slowdown in economic growth since the mid-70s)? Here&#8217;s what looks like a <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/?p=3186">smoking gun</a>: Government investment spending as a percent of GDP fell off a cliff from the 50s/60s to the 80s &#8212; a 42% drop in sixteen years from &#8217;68 to &#8217;84, down 48% from &#8217;58 to &#8217;84. It’s been floating around that low level for the last 26 years.<br />Oh and for those who are curious, government <em>consumption </em>spending as a percent of GDP has been <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/?p=2982">flat</a> since the mid-70s.</p>
<p>The crowding-out theory of postwar America is in fact anachronistic by about six decades. When Simon Kuznets (who in the early thirties created the system of national accounts now used by every country in the world) published <em><a href="http://www.abebooks.com/servlet/SearchResults?kn=kuznets&#038;tn=Capital+American+economy">Capital in the American Economy</a></em> in 1961, reviewing trends from 1869 to 1955, he cited the proportional growth of government investment as the dominant trend in capital formation over the decades he was examining.</p>
<p>The postwar trend has been in exactly the opposite direction.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m just sayin&#8217;: stopped clocks are wrong most of the time.</div>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>AP&#8217;s Andrew Taylor <a target="_blank" href="http://www.aolnews.com/2011/04/09/obama-boehner-each-earn-wins-in-budget-pact/?ncid=webmail">describes</a> a part of the federal budget debate that needs clarification for the average voter and others regarding this current round of &#8216;negotiations&#8217;:</p>
<blockquote><p>Some $18 billion of the spending cuts involve cuts to so-called mandatory programs whose budgets run largely on autopilot. To the dismay of budget purists, these cuts often involve phantom savings allowed under the decidedly arcane rules of congressional budgeting. They include mopping up $2.5 billion in unused money from federal highway programs and $5 billion in fudged savings from capping payments from a Justice Department trust fund for crime victims</p>
<p>Both ideas officially &#8220;score&#8221; as savings that could be used to pay for spending elsewhere in the day-to-day budgets of domestic agencies. But they have little impact, if any, on the deficit.</p></blockquote>

<p>OMB Watch recommends six changes Congress and the Obama administration should make to <a href="http://www.usaspending.gov/">USAspending.gov</a>, the government&#8217;s spending website which is based off of one of their websites, <a href="http://www.fedspending.org/">FedSpending.org</a>. </p>
<blockquote><p>Making USAspending.gov better isn’t just about improving the quality of the current data, which Friday&#8217;s hearing focused on a great deal, it’s also about broadening the site’s scope. We need to bring in other data sources to improve, and help give context to, the spending data already on USAspending.gov. To that end, the testimony outlines a six-point plan for advancing federal spending transparency: 
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Treasury data: Use spending information directly from the nation’s checkbook, which would improve data quality </li>
<p>
<li>Tax expenditure data: Shed light on the more than $1 trillion in tax expenditures </li>
<p>
<li>Multi-tier sub-recipient reporting: Everyone who gets federal funds must report in, as opposed to the current two-tier system </li>
<p>
<li>Unique entity identification: Create a new system to link recipients to lobbying data, contractor performance information, etc. </li>
<p>
<li>Full text of contracts: Show detailed information on government projects, not just short summaries </li>
<p>
<li>Performance information: Provide meaningful data on which programs are effective</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
<p>OMB notes that in the House, <a href="http://www.ombwatch.org/node/11576">funds for such initiatives were slashed</a>: </p>
<p>
<p>In the midst of a fight about the budget deficit, Congress is poised to shut down federal websites that tell the public how the government spends our money. It&#8217;s ironic and disappointing. Websites like USAspending.gov and Data.gov have started to make government more transparent. But just when things are starting to get better, Congress wants to take us backward. Members of Congress love to talk about transparency, but the spending bill being negotiated right now would slash funding for vital transparency programs by 94 percent. Agencies are already making contingency plans to shut down the sites if their funding is cut so drastically. Congress is set to vote on the budget this week. Incredibly, Congress wants to cut the Electronic Government Fund even though it represents only 0.002 percent of the deficit. But this tiny slice of the budget pays big dividends: sites like USAspending.gov help citizens and government watchdogs spot wasteful spending and other abuses – and deter them from happening in the first place. We can&#8217;t afford to not know how our money is being spent. Meanwhile, Congress hasn&#8217;t held a single hearing to debate the destructive impact these cuts would have on government openness.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the context of <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/02/continuing-resolution-hr-1-links.html">Dan&#8217;s post below</a>, I just want to repeat <a href="http://capitalgainsandgames.com/blog/bruce-bartlett/2142/democratic-budgetary-passivity">what Bruce Bartlett said so accurately yesterday</a>:<br />
<blockquote>[H]ere&#8217;s what I would be doing if I were organizing opposition to the Republican budgetary disinformation campaign. First of all, I would be holding hearings five days a week in the Senate Appropriations Committee and every other Senate committee on the impact of proposed Republican budget cuts. Whose benefits are going to be cut? What programs will be shut down? What are the real world consequences of the Republicans&#8217; plans?</p>
<p><em>I have no idea and I have made an effort to try and find out.</em> But there are undoubtedly people who know at the Office of Management and Budget and the various departments of government that are filled with assistant secretaries eager to testify before a congressional committee and respond in detail to the implicit Republican argument that spending can be massively cut without hurting anyone.</p>
<p>Another thing I would be doing is commissioning reports by the Congressional Research Service, the Government Accountability Office, and the Congressional Budget Office to provide data and analysis on the impact of Republican plans. And believe me, any request from the chairman of the appropriations committee gets the very careful attention of those who run these organizations for obvious reasons.</p>
<p>The next obvious step is to get all of the various organizations that represent farmers, defense contractors, health providers and so on to do their own analyses based on their intimate knowledge of how spending cuts will affect them. These people will also be more than happy to testify before a congressional committee on short notice.</p>
<p>Within a couple of weeks I think it would be very easy to put flesh on the bones of the Republican plans and mobilize the millions of people who will be affected but probably have no idea at this time that this is the case because no one has told them. I think the political dynamics could change quickly. But someone needs to get the ball rolling, get the analyses started, organize the hearings and so on. Why this isn&#8217;t already being done, is a complete mystery to me. [emphasis mine]</p></blockquote>
<p>That no one has been willing or able to answer Mr. Bartlett&#8217;s question tells me all I need to know about who will be hurt by the cuts: the vast majority of the American people.  We&#8217;re not just talking the people who scheduled a trip to DC after their kid was fascinated by <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1078912/"><em>Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian</em></a>.  We&#8217;re talking the kids, their parents, and their neighbors.</p>
<p>The silence from the DSCC members is deafening. And, in more than one sense of the word, Depressing.</p>
