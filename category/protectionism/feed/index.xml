				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Of all the things being deconstructed regarding the debate last night, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/decision2012/2012-presidential-debate-president-obama-and-mitt-romneys-remarks-at-hofstra-university-on-oct-16-running-transcript/2012/10/16/be8bfb9a-17dd-11e2-9855-71f2b202721b_story_4.html" target="_blank">this is the one</a> that stood out for me:</div>

<blockquote><div>QUESTION: The outsourcing of American jobs overseas has taken a toll on our economy. What plans do you have to put back and keep jobs here in the United States?</div>
<div></div>
<div><i>Romney:&#8230;which will allow me as president to be able to put in place, if necessary, tariffs where I believe that they are taking unfair advantage of our manufacturers.  </i></div>
</blockquote>

It just floored me to hear Romney speak the word &#8220;tariff&#8221; when presenting his solution to the question.Â  What would Uncle Milton think of his school&#8217;s chosen one?</div>
