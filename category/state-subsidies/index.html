                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Louise Story&#8217;s <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/02/us/how-local-taxpayers-bankroll-corporations.html">series</a> in the <i>New York Times </i>this  week has created a substantial buzz about the issue of economic  development subsidies.This is a welcome development, because it&#8217;s an  issue that doesn&#8217;t get nearly enough attention in the highest profile  media. Story has, in addition, appeared on shows such as MSNBC&#8217;s  &#8220;Morning Joe&#8221; and NPR&#8217;s &#8220;Fresh Air,&#8221; bringing subsidies to an even wider  audience.</p>
<p>She crafted a number of stories that  highlighted the big picture issues: imbalance in bargaining power  between city governments and giant multinational corporations, the  blatant conflicts of interest on display in Texas subsidy procurement,  and a border war between Kansas and Missouri involving multimillion  dollar incentives to move existing facilities across the state line,  with no net benefit for the Kansas City metropolitan area, let alone for  the U.S. as a whole.</p>
<p>The last few days have given me  time to absorb the articles and the database Story created, as well as  surveying the commentary on the web from well-known experts on  subsidies. Several tentative conclusions seem in order.</p>
<p>First, as I pointed out in <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/12/nyt-80-billion-in-state-and-local.html">my last post</a>, and backed up by Timothy Bartik&#8217;s <a href="http://investinginkids.net/2012/12/04/all-business-incentives-are-not-created-equal/">detailed analysis of Michigan</a>,  5/8 of the national total is in the form of sales tax breaks, and  probably the overwhelming majority of those sales tax reductions should  not be considered subsidies. Here is what Bartik says about Michigan:<br />
<blockquote>For example, in my own state of Michigan, the New York <i>Times </i>database  identifies $6.65 billion in annual state and local business incentives.  Of this total, $4.83 billion is in “sales tax refund, exemptions, or  other sales tax discounts”.  Of this $4.83 billion, almost all of these  refunds come from two provisions of Michigan tax law. First, Michigan  does not apply the sales tax to most services, including business  services, which saves businesses $3.88 billion annually. Second, for  manufacturing, Michigan does not apply the sales tax to goods used as  inputs to the manufacturing process, which saves manufacturers about  $0.92 billion in sales tax.</p></blockquote>
<p>For those keeping score  at home, that means that $4.80 billion of the $4.83 billion in sales tax  breaks should not be considered subsidies, unless you consider  manufacturing &#8220;specific&#8221; enough that this aid constitutes a subsidy, in  which case only 80% of the sales tax breaks should be excluded from the  subsidy tally.</p>
<p>Second, changes of this magnitude mean that the <i>Times</i> estimates are not sufficiently accurate to use in a statistical analysis, as <a href="http://www.theatlanticcities.com/jobs-and-economy/2012/12/uselessness-economic-development-incentives/4081/#">Richard Florida</a>  attempts in The Atlantic Cities. Finding out if incentives affect  outcomes like wages, employment, or poverty is precisely the type of  analysis we would like to do, but the fragility of the data makes this  premature. The good news is that since the data on these state programs  are all in one place, it should be possible to get a better handle on  state incentives by cutting out those programs which should not be  considered subsidies. Different analysts will no doubt have different  judgments about what should be counted as a subsidy, but since the  database is so inclusive, it should be useful no matter what your  definition of subsidy is.</p>
<p>Third, there are some smaller  errors in the program database as well. The one I have identified so  far is that it counts net operating loss (NOL) tax provisions as  subsidies in Illinois and New Hampshire, but not in other states, even  though all states with a corporate income tax will have an NOL  provision. In any event, this should not be considered a subsidy at all,  but a part of a state&#8217;s basic macroeconomic framework. In addition,  Timothy Bartik pointed out to me in correspondence that the program  database does not include single sales factor apportionment (only  counting what percentage of a multi-state firm&#8217;s sales take place in a  given state, rather than standard three-factor apportionment that uses  percentages of payroll and property as well) as a subsidy, which it  should.</p>
<p>Fourth, the program database does not  distinguish between investment incentives (subsidies to affect the  location of investment) and subsidies more generally, which may or may  not require an investment to obtain them. This is an important  distinction I have tried to make clear by providing separate estimates  in <i>Investment Incentives and the Global Competition for Capital</i>:  $46.8 billion in incentives, and $65 or $70 billion in subsidies,  depending on whether or not you count non-specific accelerated  depreciation as a subsidy.</p>
<p>Finally, as Phil Mattera at Good Jobs First <a href="http://clawback.org/2012/12/06/summing-subsidies/">points out</a>,  the deals database misses a number of large awards, leaving out  Tennessee&#8217;s $450 million (present value) subsidy to Volkswagen and an  even bigger package for ThyssenKrupp in Alabama. It also underestimates  other awards, including Apple in North Carolina and Boeing in South  Carolina. I also found that it underestimated subsidies to Dell and  Google in North Carolina by omitting the local subsidy portion of the  awards, a problem Ms. Story is aware of, as I noted in my last post.</p>
<p>The <i>Times</i>  series has been great for the spotlight it has put on state and local  subsidies and the sometimes vulgar politics surrounding the process of  awarding them, and for compiling a great database of programs all in one  place. However, its interpretation of the sales tax breaks, which are  5/8 of the national total but largely not subsidies, confuses the issue  of total impact on state and local budgets and makes statistical  analysis premature. This will require some work to fix, but it appears  like most of the raw material is there to do it.</p>

<p> Welfare Spending: Medicare vs Corporate/Business Subsidies (or does the GOP really support WalMart&#8217;s behavior in Bangladesh?)</p>
<p> As most readers know, the federal government is currently in what passes for negotiations between the President&#8217;s Democratic Party Senate and House members and the GOP members that control the House. <br />The Tea Party and its right-wing rhetoric has of course had a radicalizing impact on the GOP positions, with members not only beholden to Grover Norquist and his anti-tax pledge (all strongly supported by various right-wing propaganda tanks like the Tax Foundation, Heritage, American Enterprise, and other organizations) but also to the anti-social welfare corporatists like David and Charles Koch, the Wal-Mart heirs, and other oligarchic families that constitute the top 1% of US income and wealth.  As a result of these two strong influences, the GOP now stands for
<ul>
<li>tax-cuts-no-matter-what (and for tax cuts that benefit the wealthy most of all, as reflected in the rigid position in favor of the &#8220;carried interest&#8221; scam used by private equity profits partners and the extraordinarily preferential rate for capital gains and dividends included in the &#8220;net capital gain&#8221; definition under section 1(h)(11)); and </li>
<li>so-called &#8220;entitlement reforms&#8221;, by which GOPers generally mean reduction in benefits and/or privatization of social welfare programs including Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.  (All of this is argued in terms of caring about &#8220;saving&#8221; the programs for the future, but the truth lies in the ways that the right proposes changes to the programs&#8211;not changes in costs related to profits taken out by Big Pharma and similar interests, but changes in benefits to ordinary Americans (such as raising the working age for eligibility even though those who work at the hardest labor need benefits earlier, not later, or lowering the cost-of-living-allowance adjustment to benefits for Medicare, even though seniors generally have a HIGHER cost of living because of their increased medical needs, including prescription drugs for diabetes, high blood pressure, and similar diseases particularly prevalent in the elderly population.)</li>
</ul>
<p>The sum of those positions stands for a corporatist philosophy of benefitting the oligarchy and their business enterprises at the expense of everyday Americans who work for a living.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>This is even more obvious when one looks at the same groups&#8217; position on government subsidies for business.  The New York Times recently ran an article on this issue, noting that governments typically pay out a lot of money to support profits of companies and receive very little benefit in terms of tax revenues received and jobs created!  Louise Story, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/02/us/how-local-taxpayers-bankroll-corporations.html">As companies seek tax deals, governments pay high price</a>, New York Times (Dec. 1, 2012).</p>
<p>Over at MauledAgain, one of my fellow tax professors Jim Maule has, like me, long criticized the hypocrisy of supporting tax breaks for private enterprise and opposing earned benefits programs for ordinary citizens and has repeatedly pointed out that the economics of the tax breaks for business don&#8217;t work out for anybody but the owners and managers of the businesses.  They certainly don&#8217;t work for taxpayers of the jurisdiction providing them.  As Jim notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>These tax breaks are nothing more than welfare payments to private enterprise. Opponents of social welfare spending defend these outlays with as much passion as they bring to their attempts to end government assistance for individuals in need of help.James Maule, <a href="http://www.mauledagain.blogspot.com/#9119804729524207183">The Hidden Government Spending Game</a>, MauledAgain (Dec. 5, 2012).</p></blockquote>
<p>Jim rebuts one of the sham arguments for corporate subsidies&#8211;that they are just &#8220;keeping what belongs to them.&#8221;  Those special subsidies to one private enterprise sector cause ripple effects throughout the economy&#8211;higher taxes to the other taxpayers to make up for the lost revenues, or cuts in important programs that can no longer be sustained without the revenues.  Prices and wages may change as well.  Id.<br />What I want to focus on is the hypocrisy of claiming an interest in ending &#8220;entitlements&#8221; but applying that philosophy only to programs that are intended to help ordinary citizens and not to those intended to beef up the profits of corporations or their managers and owners.  This is especially hypocritical for today&#8217;s right-wing, since they almost universally claim to ascribe to the view that competition is good and that businesses should fail when they cannot successfully compete. </p>
<p>Look at two cases involving WalMart, a multinational enterprise that fights unionization of its employees (and supports right-to-work laws that weaken worker rights) in every way imaginable.</p>
<p>1) In Champlain Illinois (personal experience), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walmart">WalMart</a> had a huge spralling complex on one side of the road.  It had gotten various tax support for the complex.  It decided to move across the road and down the block into another jurisdiction.  It got new tax subsidies there.  It abandonned the old building and left whatever environmental pollution there.  Who gained?  Mostly WalMart managers and owners.  Not the town and counties.  Not the employees.  Not even the consumers who shopped there, who had to deal with the blight of the abandonned building and the multiplication of vast expanses of ugly parking lots.</p>
<p>2) WalMart in Bangladesh.   WalMart delivers cheap goods because it outsources its clothing and other manufacturing needs to impoverished countries where workers can be paid almost nothing and get almost no protections.  In Bangladesh last month, a clothing factory burned, killing hundreds of workers.  It was a WalMart supplier. See  Natasha Leonard, <a href="http://www.salon.com/2012/11/26/wal_marts_connection_to_firetrap_bangladesh_factory_is_unclear/">WalMart&#8217;s Connection to Bangladesh Clothing Factory</a>, Salon.com (Nov. 26, 2012), where a critic noted that:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Wal-Mart is supporting, is incentivizing, an industry strategy in Bangladesh: extreme low wages, non-existent regulation, brutal suppression of any attempt by workers to act collectively to improve wages and conditions.&#8221; Id.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>This was a modern-day repeat of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle_Shirtwaist_Factory_fire">Triangle Shirt Factory</a> incident in the early nineteen hundreds in New York City:  workers unable to escape burned to death in factory rooms without fire exits and yet dangerously littered with lint and other debris that made their workplace a fire hazard.</p>
<p>WalMart, in fact, has led the fight against workers&#8217; rights and spending on safety at that factory and others.  See Natasha Leonard,  <a href="http://www.salon.com/2012/12/06/wal_mart_wouldnt_pay_for_bangladeshi_factory_safety_improvements/">WalMart wouldn&#8217;t pay for Bangladeshi factory safety improvements</a>, Salon.com (Dec. 6, 2012). </p></blockquote>
<p>These things are all tied together: hostility to workers rights to bargain collectively for some fair share of the productivity gains that their labor brings about, hostility to workers rights to a safe working place; hostitlity to workers rights to decent health care; hostility to ordinary people&#8217;s rights to a sustainable lifestyle; and hostility to any effort to make the oligarchic uber-rich pay a fair share of the costs of the infrastructure to sustain an economy and a people.</p>
<p>Tax policy, spending policy, policy towards workers, policy towards the wealthy uber-rich&#8211;these are all closely intertwined and must be considered of a piece.  Tax policy needs to establish reasonable levels of contributions based on a progressive income tax that takes into account the marginal utility of the dollar.  Spending policy needs to set priorities based on something other than the lobbying by special corporate and oligarch interests for tax-and-spending provisions that privilege themselves.    Policy towards labor rights and workplace safety need to recognize that the worker is disemplowered within the workplace and needs some legal support to provide a reasonable share of productivity gains&#8211;minimum wage laws, unionization laws, workers safety laws need to protect workers rights against the all-powerful employer.</p>
<p>If the right succeeds in continuing to pass right-to-work laws (Michigan&#8217;s lame duck GOP is trying to do that right now), if the oligarchs succeed in capturing all the profits from workers&#8217; labor&#8211;there will be social unrest on the scale of the Great Depression.  Everybody will suffer from that kind of austerity and class warfare policy.  Broad based economic growth that comes from workers sharing in the profits of their industry and those at the top not getting an unreasonable share of the productivity gains is better for all. </p>

<p>NYT: $80 Billion in State and Local Subsidies Annually (Updated)</p>
<p>In today&#8217;s <i>New York Times</i>, Louise Story <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/02/us/how-local-taxpayers-bankroll-corporations.html?emc=na&#038;_r=0">begins a series</a>, &#8220;The United States of Subsidies,&#8221; ten months in the making, with a story focusing on General Motors closures, the border war for investments between Kansas and Missouri in the Kansas City metropolitan area, and a new estimate of state and local incentives to business, $80 billion a year. Backing this up, and no doubt contributing to the long lead time, is a database of 150,000 state and local subsidy deals going back at least 20 years. Given its appearance in the country&#8217;s newspaper of record, the series is sure to elevate the issue of state and local subsidies to a prominence it has never known before.    </p>
<p>Since <a href="http://us.macmillan.com/investmentincentivesandtheglobalcompetitionforcapital/KennethPThomas">my 2011 estimate</a> was $70 billion per year in total subsidies to business, and $46.8 billion in location incentives, the <i>Times</i> figure represents a substantial increase if accurate. Ever since <a href="http://www.tax.com/taxcom/taxblog.nsf/Permalink/UBEN-8CSNLH">David Cay Johnston </a>reviewed my book when it first came out, he has argued that my $70 billion figure was probably an underestimate, and the new report would seem to back him up. Nevertheless, I will certainly be spending some time analyzing the database to see just what is in it. According to the story, $18 billion per year is accounted for by corporate income tax breaks, a whopping $52 billion by &#8220;sales tax relief,&#8221; and the other $10 billion unspecified but most likely property tax breaks. I have some questions about these numbers, however.\</p>
<p>First, it seems to me that property tax breaks likely exceed $10 billion a year. When <a href="http://middleclasspoliticaleconomist.blogspot.com/2012/02/california-birthplace-of-tif-axes-it.html">California axed tax increment financing</a> earlier this year, it was generating $8 billion in tax increment all by itself. Although California cities were by far the biggest user of TIF, municipalities in almost every other state still use it, as well as myriads of property tax abatements offered at the local level. Story is well aware of this. She writes:<br />
<blockquote>The cost of the awards is certainly far higher. A full accounting, The Times discovered, is not possible because the incentives are granted by thousands of government agencies and officials, and many do not know the value of all their awards.</p></blockquote>
<p>Thousands of local governments give subsidies, and these are overwhelmingly related to property tax. In my most recent estimate, <strike>there were several states</strike> in <u>Missouri</u><strike>which</strike> local subsidies exceeded state subsidies, <strike>including Missouri and Michigan</strike>, so my default assumption was that they were equal if I did not have adequate information on local incentives, as is usually the case due to the huge number of governments involved.   </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>On the other hand, there is some chance that the $52 billion in sales tax subsidies could be an overestimate; it all depends on what <i>The Times</i> includes in this category. My own thinking about sales tax has changed since I first created the subsidy estimates in <a href="http://books.google.com/books/about/Competing_for_Capital.html?id=cEt3Vn3H6sUC">my 2000 book</a>, <i>Competing for Capital</i>. My estimate for Minnesota, for example, included many hundreds of millions per year in sales tax exemptions for business services. Now, I tend to think of these tax breaks as methods to avoid tax cascading (paying the sales tax on a good more than once, by taxing the full value of every intermediate good) and not a subsidy at all. They have been removed from my estimate of total subsidies in my more recent work, which did not prevent my estimate for 2005 (published in 2011) from being $20 billion higher than that for 1995 (published in 2000). I do still count some sales tax breaks as subsidies, particularly those on plant and equipment, which apply to the initial investment rather than ongoing operations.  </p>
<p>While this may seem like a sterile academic argument, in fact it makes a big difference whether incentives are $50 billion a year or $80 billion a year, approximately 600,000 public sector jobs paying $50,000 annually. The larger the true figure, the more pressing is the case for subsidy reform. The inauguration of this new series of articles, plus the database, will help us put a better number on the value, a critical first step toward galvanizing public opinion to force politicians to rein in subsidies.  </p>
<p>I will be commenting more on this series over the course of this week.  </p>
<p>UPDATE: Text corrected to reflect that although I had specific data for local incentives in Michigan, the total of local incentives was somewhat lower than that of state incentives. In addition, it is clearly true that TIF in California exceeded state subsidies, so obviously so did the total of local subsidies. However, I did not know this at the time I made the estimate.  </p>

<p>McMahon&#8217;s WWE has taken $36.7 million in Connecticut subsidies</p>
<p>U.S. Senate candidate Linda McMahon&#8217;s World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) has received $36.7 million in Connecticut film tax credits in 20 separate deals since 2006, reports <a href="http://www.ctpost.com/news/article/WWE-received-37M-in-tax-credits-3964924.php?goback=.gde_3784451_member_177233674">CTPost.com</a> (thanks to Karin Richmond on the LinkedIn Public Incentives Forum). As in many states, what historically began as tax credits for motion pictures are now available for TV and online media as well, and it is in these two latter categories that the WWE received its subsidies. Also as is typical of other states, the Connecticut program has no job creation requirements, but is calculated simply as a percentage of &#8220;qualified expenditures,&#8221; with the rate being 30% in Connecticut. In fact, in WWE&#8217;s case, the company had laid off about 60 workers in 2009, yet continued to receive the credits.<br />    <br />Moreover, according to the <i>Sacramento Bee</i> blog, &#8220;<a href="http://www.cagesideseats.com/2012/10/25/3550828/linda-mcmahon-ran-wwe-sold-93-of-their-connecticut-film-tax-credits">Cageside Seats</a>,&#8221; WWE has so little state tax liability that it sells the vast majority of its tax credits via a broker, including 93% of the tax credits it earned in 2007-9. While selling tax credits is perfectly legal (in David Cay Johnston&#8217;s memorable phrase), it also increases the subsidies that states give, because they wind up giving subsidies to companies that did nothing to qualify for them under any subsidy program.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a>   <br />Nor is WWE alone in its sale of Connecticut tax credits. According to a 2010 article at the <a href="http://www.ctpost.com/local/article/State-s-film-tax-credits-a-boon-to-brokers-582545.php#page-1">CT Post</a>, &#8220;of the 80 productions that received credits, only nine applied them to state taxes.&#8221; The rest, presumably, sold their credits via brokers. The article also states that the national tax credit market had reached $500 million annually in 2010, from $50 million per year in 2005.<br />    <br />Robert Tannenwald of the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP) <a href="http://www.cbpp.org/cms/index.cfm?fa=view&#038;id=3326">has analyzed</a> state film subsidies and concluded they provide very little bang for the buck. This should not be surprising. Unlike most subsidies, film/TV/digital media subsidies do not go to an investment, but to operating costs. There is nothing left after the crew packs up. Tannenwald points out that even the early adopters of film subsidies (New Mexico and Louisiana), which appeared to have built up some in-state film capacity, are now finding it difficult to maintain their position as the number of states offering such incentives skyrocketed to over 40 by 2010. The increased competition has led states to bid up their reimbursement percentages, to over 40% in Alaska and Michigan. Moreover, it&#8217;s hard to have job creation requirements for jobs that are inherently temporary.<br />    <br />Tannenwald estimates that the 43 states that gave film tax credits in fiscal 2010 spent $1.5 billion. This is enough to hire back 30,000 state workers laid off since the recession began, at an average of $50,000 per year in salary and benefits.<br />    <br />Although not members of the Forbes 400, Linda and Vince McMahon follow their example in <a href="http://dirtdiggersdigest.org/archives/2494">collecting millions in subsidies</a> from government. This is <a href="http://www.cagesideseats.com/2012/10/25/3550828/linda-mcmahon-ran-wwe-sold-93-of-their-connecticut-film-tax-credits">particularly hypocritical</a> since as a Senate candidate McMahon has tried to portray herself as an opponent of &#8220;corporate welfare.&#8221;<br />    <br />Besides having little bang for the buck, film subsidy programs have been rocked by scandal in both Iowa and Louisiana, where the film commissioner was <a href="http://www.governing.com/topics/economic-dev/The-Value-of-Movie-Tax-Incentives.html">convicted of bribery</a> to accept inflated expense submissions. The Iowa Film Office director was <a href="http://wcfcourier.com/news/local/update-wheeler-acquitted-on-charges-convicted-on-in-iowa-film/article_76dd6886-d8b1-11e0-a472-001cc4c002e0.html">convicted of felonious misconduct</a>, but acquitted on eight other felony charges. A number of credit claimants in Iowa were convicted of felonies as well in other trials.<br />    <br />As I have argued before, investment incentives generally constitute a race to the bottom. However, film and related media subsidies have shown us a high-speed race to the bottom for amazingly little economic benefit. While a few states <a href="http://www.governing.com/topics/economic-dev/The-Value-of-Movie-Tax-Incentives.html">have cut back</a> on the subsidies due to the recession (and Iowa suspended its program for three years due to the scandal), only federal controls can truly address this problem. My <a href="http://econpapers.repec.org/article/cppissued/v_3a37_3ay_3a2011_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a343-357.htm">research in Canada</a> (paywalled) found the provinces there similarly unable to control their film subsidy wars. At this point, only only transparency in program costs, plus information on the low benefits and frequent scandals, is the only way to generate political pressure for reform.</p>
