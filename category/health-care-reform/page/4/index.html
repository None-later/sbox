<div>Prometheus and Bundled Payments</div>
<p>So, one of the more intriguing propositions in the midst of health reform is to reform payments. Make no mistake this has been tried before, and many physicians and hospital administrators remember the days of capitation and DRG’s with Medicare.</p>
<p>I attend a lot of health policy meetings and symposia, and the common theme on the priorities coming out of these meetings centers around bundled payments, and payment reform. The thought of course being, that as you change the payment system, other changes will be more palatable, and easier to enact. We’ve had some discussion of the ACO concept here, and make no mistake, bundled payments tied to outcome measurements will be one of the chief indicators of the ACO model success, and/or, it’s demise. </p>
<p>The problem is, that the current fee for service model is broken. Almost everyone knows this. It encourages fragmentation, volume over value, and quantity over quality. This is not sustainable, and is one of the main drivers in some respects of healthcare cost increases. </p>

<div>Prometheus happens to be one of the most studied, and well known of the new payment models (and yes, also a Titan who was condemned to watch his liver being eaten every day by an eagle). </div>
<p>Prometheus was first developed under a Robert Wood Johnson grant in 2006 in Rockford, Illinois, but has shown a great deal of promise for expansion. The initial premise behind it was to hold physicians and hospitals accountable for the care that they provide, but only for those outcomes that were within their control. They termed these PAC’s, or Potentially Avoidable Complications. </p>
<p>There has been some work that shows that these PAC’s may account for about 22% of all private sector expenditures. Reducing not only the occurrence of these incidents through incentives, but also through payment mechanisms has the potential to save a lot of money.</p>

<p>I posted in 7/2009 on the issue of fixing our healthcare system based on the Massachusetts model. The first was <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2009/07/massachusetts-is-fixing-fixed-health.html">Massachusetts is fixing the fixed healthcare system</a>.   The second was a followup to the first:  <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2009/07/fixing-fixing-health-care-deja-vu.html">Fixing the fixing. Healthcare Deja vu.</a></p>
<p>The issue was that we are dancing around. All the proposals to date have been nothing more than a relabeling of already tried organizational structuring within the private insurance model.  I ended the first article with a quote from a NEJM report and a my question:</p>
<blockquote><p>Despite these imprecisions, the difference in the costs of health care administration between the United States and Canada is clearly large and growing. <strong>Is $294.3 billion annually for U.S. health care administration money well spent?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Well, is it? Did they even ask?</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>I ended the second article with: </p>
<blockquote><p>We&#8217;re talking the same old approach to what really is a problem with the product. At least in the bad socialist health care programs they recognize that a for profit third party only adds cost and thus do not have to account for that part of our problem (it&#8217;s called savings). They just need to resolve the product quality issue. It is the only common issue to all nations. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m taking bets on the date of the new fix of the newly fixed, fixed system. </p></blockquote>
<p>Ok folks. The betting is closed. Time to lay the cards on the table. </p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />US News and World Report: <a href="http://www.pnhp.org/news/2011/march/mass-health-reform-hasnt-halted-medical-bankruptcies">Mass. Health Reform Hasn&#8217;t Halted Medical Bankruptcies</a> </p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Health costs in the state have risen sharply since reform was enacted. Even before the changes in health care laws, most medical bankruptcies in Massachusetts &#8212; as in other states &#8212; afflicted middle-class families with health insurance. High premium costs and gaps in coverage &#8212; co-payments, deductibles and uncovered services &#8212; often left insured families liable for substantial out-of-pocket costs. None of that changed. For example, under Massachusetts&#8217; reform, the least expensive individual coverage available to a 56-year-old Bostonian carries a premium of $5,616, a deductible of $2,000, and covers only 80 percent of the next $15,000 in costs for covered services,&#8221; the researchers wrote.</p></blockquote>
<p>The results from the actual published article in <a href="http://www.pnhp.org/sites/default/files/docs/2011/AJM_Mass-Reform-hasnt-stopped-med-bankruptcies.pdf">The American Journal of Medicine</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p>In 2009, illness or medical bills contributed to 52.9% of bankruptcies in Massachusetts. In contrast, in early 2007, medical bankruptcies accounted for 59.3% of personal bankruptcies in the state (P#.44 for comparison with 2009 proportion) and 62.1% nationally (P#.02). Because the total number of personal bankruptcy filings in Massachusetts increased by 51% between fiscal years 2007 and 2009(6) the absolute number of <strong>medical bankruptcies in the state actually increased by more than one third during that period, from 7504 to 10,093</strong>.</p></blockquote>
<p>The profile of the bankruptcies:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>Most of the recent Massachusetts debtors were female (Table 1). Their average age was 48.2 years, two thirds of them had attended college, and 70.5% owned a home or had owned one within the past 5 years. The average debtor household included 2.94 persons; in three quarters of them, at least 1 adult was employed at the time of bankruptcy filing.</p>
<p>In 2009, 45.6% of the entire sample (86.2% of the medically bankrupt) had high medical bills or specifically cited illness as a cause of their bankruptcy, proportions that did not vary by insurance</p>
<p>status. The remaining 13.8% of the medically bankrupt (7.3% of the entire sample) were classified as medically bankrupt because they had lost significant work-related income because of illness or had mortgaged a home to pay medical bills.</p>
<p>As would be expected in a state where medical insurance is mandatory, the overwhelming majority (89.0%) of debtors had health insurance for themselves and all of their dependents at the time of bankruptcy filing&#8230;</p>
<p>The 2009 coverage rates in Massachusetts were higher than those for Massachusetts debtors in 2007 (before the coverage mandate was enforced), when 84.1% had insurance at the time of filing and approximately one third (34.1%) had experienced a coverage gap. In both 2007 and 2009, Massachusetts debtors’ had higher coverage rates than in our 2007 national sample, in which only 69.7% of bankrupt families were insured at the time of filing and 37.4% had experienced a gap.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Medical Malpractice Reform: Truth in Advertising Needed (Part Three of Three</strong>)
<p>So in the first two articles we have addressed the historic effects of tort reform using Texas as an example, and subsequently we reviewed the effects of tort reform on so called “defensive medicine” practices, looking at both the effect of reform measures on physician/provider ordering patterns, as well as the possible effects on patient outcomes or mortality.    <br />Today, we are going to examine the last party in this carousel. The insurance agencies themselves. For starters, I wanted to examine if there was any sort of a relationship between malpractice premiums, and healthcare spending. So, using historic healthcare expenditure rates from the NHE database (CMS), I calculated the rate of healthcare growth, percentage wise, per year from 1995-2008. I then used an ISO database set to examine the growth in insurance premiums per year.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-l9vhc4U8ScE/TXaVTWtb8BI/AAAAAAAAAjs/QRh9R2vXTQE/s1600/viewer.png"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-l9vhc4U8ScE/TXaVTWtb8BI/AAAAAAAAAjs/QRh9R2vXTQE/s400/viewer.png" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>As we can plainly see, there is no correlation, but out of sense of thoroughness, I even ran a simple regression.  <a name="more"></a></p>
<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/9gZD3Dgg4cFxt0aG59Z9vY2Ow1di80Vjduouv3M-7jKIxYS0q2eW66B7bKkC-fUbvhGv5h4kfpCgYJYyAPKmHpW2c_ZogzvTwmM5AUgxRcQetUUtYk0" width="523" height="439"><br />But with an R-Squared of 0.021, there is simply little correlation there.     <br />So what causes these random spikes in medical malpractice premiums? Well, according to the AIR (Americans for Insurance Reform) these are due to the economic cycles of insurers and to drops in investment income.     <br />Lastly, I visited this article, <a href="http://www.centerjd.org/air/TrueRiskF.pdf">http://www.centerjd.org/air/TrueRiskF.pdf</a>, which found:</p>
<p>1.     Inflation-adjusted payouts per doctor not only failed to increase between 2001 and 2004, a time when doctors’ premiums skyrocketed, but they have been stable or falling throughout this entire decade.</p>
<p>2.    Medical malpractice insurance premiums rose much faster in the early years of this decade than was justified by insurance payouts.</p>
<p>3.    At no time were recent increases in premiums connected to actual payouts. Rather, they reflected the well-known cyclical phenomenon called a “hard” market. Property/casualty insurance industry “hard” markets have occurred three times in the past 30 years.</p>
<p>4.    During this same period, medical malpractice insurers vastly (and unnecessarily) increased reserves (used for future claims) despite no increase in payouts or any trend suggesting large future payouts. The reserve increases in the years 2001 to 2004 could have accounted for 60</p>
<p>percent of the price increases witnessed by doctors during the period.</p>
<p>But the real devil, the real devil is in the loss ratios…I’m assuming that we are all familiar with the MLR discussions that raged over the past two years discussing what should be an allowable loss ratio for health insurance. Malpractice also has it’s loss ratios, and oh boy, are they favorable to the insurance industry. 61.1% is the average, in 2007, for the average loss ratios for malpractice insurance companies.  To put this another way as per the article: In 2007, medical malpractice insurer profit based just on insurance transactions, that is,just on the premiums they took in, was 24.6%. This was more than double the amount on insurance transactions for the entire industry (11.0%).</p>
<p>If I were a physician who paid my own malpractice, I would be livid over these figures. It is not as though there is a huge advertising market for medical malpractice insurance. 38.9 cents on every dollar are kept as almost pure profit. Surely, administrative costs cannot account for this. Add to this, this last nugget: Inflation-adjusted payouts per doctor not only failed to increase between 2001 and 2004, a time when doctors’ premiums skyrocketed, but they have been stable or falling throughout this entire decade.</p>
<p>It seems, that right now would be a great time to own a malpractice insurance firm. Too bad, that it isn’t so great for everyone else in healthcare.</p>

                                <p>Some catching up on health care reform progress makes sense as we keep in mind these posts from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cepr.net/index.php/blogs/beat-the-press/does-robert-samuelson-worry-about-monsters-under-his-bed-at-night">Beat the Press</a> Dean Baker writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Second, the story of massive huge future budget deficits has little to do with aging. It is a story of a broken private health care system. If the United States paid the same amount per person for health care as any other wealthy country we would be looking at huge budget surpluses, not deficits. Of course we can&#8217;t lower our costs because of the enormous power of the health care industry.</p></blockquote>
<p>The big deal in national planning and in <a target="_blank" href="http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2011/02/payment-reform-agreement/">recent MA statements by planners</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wbur.org/2011/01/07/global-payments">Gov. Patrick</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.californiahealthline.org/think-tank/2010/is-california-ripe-for-global-payment-acos.aspx">others</a> is the &#8216;global payment method&#8217; (of which there are many proposals of programs) to replace fee for service billing.  Somehow a global payment system determined by a standard treatment sequence will cut an estimated amount of duplication and excess testing among a list of things.  Estimates range from 4% to 14% &#8216;savings&#8217; through a mechanism jointly approved by the Blue Cross insurers and hospital association is to accomplish this in MA, but no proposals are very concrete from my survey of MA articles.  Michael Halasy will hopefully write more on this topic from the inside.<br /><a name="more"></a><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.pfpsummit.com/overview.html">Pay for Performance Summit</a> will happen in March where the many proposals of &#8216;global payments&#8217; will be discussed among many items.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8230;the little observed fact that cutting Medicare will not cut your medical costs&#8230;just put you in the private market.  It seems a little stupid to be running around saying &#8220;medical costs are going up; we have to cut our insurance.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Medical Malpractice Reform: Truth in Advertising Needed</strong> (Part Two of Three)</p>
<p>So in the first article, we discussed the historical implications of tort reform by examining Texas. The take home message being that tort reform failed to curb health care spending, and/or control costs (outside of malpractice premiums which did fall). Proponents of tort reform claim that by enacting aggressive tort reform measures, so called defensive medicine practices could be reigned in. Estimates about the costs of defensive medicine vary, and I have seen estimates in the literature as low as 4%, and as high as 14% of total health care spending. As with most things, the truth is probably somewhere in the middle, with a realistic estimate of 8-9% likely being the real integer. Recently, several studies have attempted to assess two of the most important questions about this topic: </p>
<p>A: Does a reduction in defensive medicine practices occur with the implementation of tort reform measures? </p>
<p>And</p>
<p>B: If it does cause a reduction in defensive medicine practices, will this affect patient outcomes or mortality? <br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Three more recent studies are likely the most pertinent, and we will briefly review those. To start with, Currie and MacLeod (go ahead, I had the Highlander flashback too) (2006) reviewed national data on childbirths to examine whether or not a cap on non economic damages would change the types of procedures performed at childbirth. They found that nationally, in those states with tort reform, the rate of C-Sections increased, and the rate of preventable complications secondary to childbirth increased by 6%. They also found, that a change in the “deep pockets rule”, actually decreased them. The paper is <a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w12478">HERE</a> (gated article).</p>
<p>Then Sloan and Shadle in 2009 examined this same issue, using Medicare payments as an index. Their premise was, that if tort reform truly changed physician practices with regards to additional testing and/or defensive medicine, they would find a reduction in Medicare payment rates per beneficiary. They found that tort reform did not alter defensive medicine practices, with one exception. They did find that so called “indirect” reforms (mandatory periodic payments, Joint and Severability reform, and patient compensation funds) may reduce spending when applied to “any hospitalization”, but inexplicably, these indirect reforms did not affect any of the four diagnoses included in the study. Their paper is <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&#038;_udi=B6V8K-4V761XY-1&#038;_user=10&#038;_coverDate=03%2F31%2F2009&#038;_rdoc=1&#038;_fmt=high&#038;_orig=search&#038;_origin=search&#038;_sort=d&#038;_docanchor=&#038;view=c&#038;_acct=C000050221&#038;_version=1&#038;_urlVersion=0&#038;_userid=10&#038;md5=a4a3b91a125f2e631dcc3ff85b09888a&#038;searchtype=a">HERE</a>.</p>
<p>There have been others, and the final one we will discuss is the NBER report done in 2009 by Darius Lakdawalla and Seth Seabury, Working Paper No. 15383. Found <a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w15383.pdf">HERE</a> (gated article). Essentially, Lakdawalla and Seabury found that while targeted reforms may be effective, there could be an associated, and this is key… a 0.2% associated increase in mortality for every 10% reduction in medical malpractice liability costs. Why? Because defensive medicine practices DO FIND things. Any physician who has been in practice for any length of time, and who is being honest with you, will admit that they have done a test presuming it would be negative, and “perhaps the patient doesn&#8217;t need it”, only to be surprised by the results. We can argue whether or not 0.2% is a significant number, but even we look at the sickest 5% of Americans who are responsible for 47% of healthcare spending, than this group could have an increase of 30,000 deaths annually with a reduction of 10% spending on medical malpractice. I am not going to pass moral judgment on this fact. I will leave that up to the reader. The reason I bring this up, is that this is an important, and poignant discussion, but we need to be honest about the data that is out there now. Let’s have a discussion, but let it be an honest, and fact based one.</p>
<p>I tend to think that the Sloan and Shadle findings are important in the fact that I don’t think that physician practices are going to “magically” change overnight. The Texas evidence from the last article, would suggest that testing expenditures may actually increase. Yet, in the face of overwhelming evidence, proponents continue to cling to a disproven ideology regarding direct malpractice cost containment, IE; Non economic caps.</p>

                                <p>Guest post by <strong>Michael Halasy</strong>, Practicing Emergency Medicine PA, Health Policy Analyst, and Health Services Researcher</p>
<p>Medical Malpractice Reform: Truth in Advertising Needed (Part One of Three)</p>
</p>
<p>Medical malpractice liability reform (Tort Reform) has been a hotly contested item for years, as the GOP, with physician support, has continued to market this as a health reform measure that can contain costs.</p>
<p>I think to start, we need to examine results in states where tort reform has already been tried. We need look no further than Texas. </p>
<p>Politicians tried to claim that Texas was a success, Rep Bachmann stated ““The state of Texas did a wonderful job of lawsuit reform and actually saw medical costs come down. We know it works.” Others have touted the Texas experiment as a success..but empiric data is a powerful thing, and as we will see, contradicts this sentiment.</p>
<p>In 2003, they passed the most aggressive tort reform measures in the country by placing a 250,000 cap on malpractice awards. It is true that this reform, after 2003, lowered malpractice premiums. But malpractice settlements and awards have dropped even farther than premiums, suggesting that the main benefactors so far, have been insurance companies. (See Table 1).</p>
<p><a href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TVFQkoV430I/AAAAAAAAAiE/4bl1MtYMNAU/s1600-h/clip_image002%5B3%5D.gif"><img title="clip_image002" border="0" alt="clip_image002" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TVFQk2l4tcI/AAAAAAAAAiI/RiOFx5FyfNk/clip_image002_thumb.gif?imgmax=800" width="244" height="194"></a></p>
<p><a name="more"></a>
<p>Also, the same report found that Medicare spending per patient had doubled between 2003 and 2007, in contrast to the decline in Medicare spending that was noted prior to the laws enactment. (See Table 2)</p>
<p><a href="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TVFQlPQguLI/AAAAAAAAAiM/f3G3hFVkFdQ/s1600-h/clip_image004%5B3%5D.gif"><img title="clip_image004" border="0" alt="clip_image004" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TVFQlBRGeWI/AAAAAAAAAiQ/RyWggAlEifI/clip_image004_thumb.gif?imgmax=800" width="244" height="186"></a></p>
<p><a href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TVFQlQu1K0I/AAAAAAAAAiU/Q8PlkM2rcJw/s1600-h/clip_image006%5B3%5D.gif"><img title="clip_image006" border="0" alt="clip_image006" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TVFQlj6QVuI/AAAAAAAAAiY/fX5wRYeURrQ/clip_image006_thumb.gif?imgmax=800" width="244" height="12"></a></p>
<p>Additionally, one of the strongest arguments that tort reform supporters claim is a reduction in “defensive” medicine expenditures, or unnecessary testing… unfortunately, between 2003 and 2007 testing expenditures per Medicare enrollee grew at 50% greater than the national average…</p>
<p><a href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TVFQl1hqcQI/AAAAAAAAAic/XM_-d5Uy-3Q/s1600-h/clip_image008%5B3%5D.gif"><img title="clip_image008" border="0" alt="clip_image008" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TVFQlwZPBtI/AAAAAAAAAig/TJ9B660hgBs/clip_image008_thumb.gif?imgmax=800" width="244" height="194"></a></p>
<p>They also found that Texas has the highest rate of uninsured patients in the country, both prior to the law, and accelerating after the law was passed.</p>
<p><a href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TVFQmSgu54I/AAAAAAAAAik/jhs_ud8iJlM/s1600-h/clip_image010%5B3%5D.gif"><img title="clip_image010" border="0" alt="clip_image010" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TVFQmpEs6mI/AAAAAAAAAio/L0CClLl3NVw/clip_image010_thumb.gif?imgmax=800" width="244" height="164"></a></p>
<p>The additional physician presence has only increased because of an increasing population as well, and when it was analyzed, there was only an increase of 0.4 (correction&#8230;0.4%) physicians per capita after the law was passed. </p>
<p>These tables and data were all obtained and detailed in this study HERE, and there is much more information at the link. (enclosed link: <a href="http://www.citizen.org/documents/Texas_Liability_Limits.pdf">http://www.citizen.org/documents/Texas_Liability_Limits.pdf</a>). </p>
<p>The short version is that medical malpractice reform should be a topic for discussion, but we need to be honest about this. In this article we reviewed what actually happened in Texas after the most aggressive tort reform measures were created. Costs (outside of settlements, payments, and premiums did NOT go down), and healthcare spending was at best unaffected, and may have even increased. </p>
<p>The next article will focus on the effects of reducing defensive medicine practices on patient mortality. The final article will focus on the association between medical malpractice premiums and healthcare spending.</p>

                                <p>I wasn&#8217;t going to mention Melissa Mia Hall&#8217;s death here—this is economics and politics, not sf—but now it is clear that, as usual, <a href="http://thelipstickchronicles.typepad.com/the_lipstick_chronicles/2011/02/the-least-of-us.html">there is an overlap</a>:<br />
<blockquote>If she had seen the doctor, most likely he would have suspected more than a pulled muscle and would have ordered a life-saving EKG.</p>
<p>As Texas lawyer, writer and Melissa&#8217;s friend, Laurie Moore, wrote to me, &#8220;She would&#8217;ve had a huge doctor bill she couldn&#8217;t pay, and would probably have lost her house over it, but she would be alive instead of taking pain pills and dying in the night. &#8220;</p>
<p>In the end, Melissa didn&#8217;t die from an overdose, not even an accidental one; Melissa died of the very heart attack she feared&#8230;.</p>
<p>Melissa worked hard. She owned a home. She paid her taxes. She was trying to live a dream &#8211; the American Dream &#8211; that supposedly we as citizens are promised &#8211; the right to pursue life, liberty and happiness. For her, that couldn&#8217;t be achieved in a traditional job that came with the perks of health care.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is the quintessential &#8220;hard-working American&#8221; who gets talked about by The Teabaggers as if nothing ever goes wrong and <a href="http://slog.thestranger.com/slog/archives/2011/01/31/and-here-i-thought-the-purpose-of-the-oped-page-was-to-promote-debate-not-crush-it">they never need &#8220;government help</a>.&#8221; (link h/t <a href="http://www.eschatonblog.com/2011/01/rural-counties-are-sucking-us-dry.html">Dr. Black</a>) This is <a href="http://blogs.publishersweekly.com/blogs/genreville/?p=978">the woman of whom Peter Cannon (via Rose Fox)* said</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Melissa contributed hundreds of reviews to PW, in all different genres, as well as dozens of Q&#038;As. In recent years, ever reliable and diligent, she was reviewing three books a week for me&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>This isn&#8217;t someone who was getting &#8220;fails to perform&#8221; ratings or &#8220;stealing&#8221; a house. This is someone whose every effort was aimed at making money and paying bills to keep what little she had gained. She used her skills—human capital, painfully developed—and made rational decisions.</p>
<p>And the rational <em>ex ante</em> decision not to use the medicines she needed or to have to pay out of pocket for an exam that may well lead to more expenses that are beyond her liquidity constraints are, well, exactly what we teach as &#8220;correct&#8221; in Ph.D. micro- and macro- Economics courses.</p>
<p>So this isn&#8217;t a science fiction post, because no one who reads and writes science fiction would believe that a hard-working, conscientious person with great skills, a positive personality, and diligent attention to opportunities would die because they couldn&#8217;t afford to live.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an economics and politics post, one I wish I hadn&#8217;t had to write.</p>
<p>*Full disclosure: I&#8217;ve known Peter Cannon for years; he edited both myself and my wife at PW. (Full, full disclosure: he fired me, after having previously turned down my request to quit for a while. Both were good decisions on his part.) I&#8217;ve met Rose Fox several times and she edited my wife for a while when PW still paid something resembling minimum wage for the effort required.</p>

<p>Well, they&#8217;ve done it.  The House Republican majority pressed ahead with their repeal of health care reform, putting us (if their bill were to become law) right back in the mess of spiralling health care costs, tens of millions of uninsured Americans, and no handle at all on how to deal with it.  The vote was 245-189, with three purported Democrats joining the entire Republican House membership in voting for Big INsurance and against ordinary Americans.  See Herszenhorn, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/20/health/policy/20cong.html">House Votes to Repeal Obama Health Care Law</a>, New York Times, Jan. 19, 2011.  For background, see this &#8220;<a href="http://op.bna.com/hl.nsf/id/bbrk-8d9rvj/%24File/FredUptonJan2011.pdf">backgrounders&#8221;</a> (available on BNA) from the House Energy and Commerce Committee chaired by Republican Fred Upton (noting the priority for repealing &#8220;Obamacare&#8221;).</p>
<p>The health reform passed last year was far from perfect&#8211;partly because it was based on a Republican-generated model for health reform that relied too much on private sector self-policing, rather than setting up a single payer system or at least a public medicare-like option to compete with the private system we have now.  Our medical system without reform combines the worst of all possible worlds&#8211;very high cost (much more costly than those of our peers like Canada) and mediocre service (for all but the wealthiest oligarchic members of our society, who are empowered by their wealth and able to get just about anything they want).  So the Republicans have taken a less-than-perfect bill that at least provided medical care for 30 million uninsured Americans with a mandate for coverage that made that insurance affordable and at least addressed some of the painful examples of insurance company power to put their profits above reasonable medical coverage of their customers by eliminating the pre-existing condition provision (which could impact insurance coverage for about half of all Americans, according to a recent study discussed in the Times) and they have proposed simply saying no and putting us back at square one.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a> </p>
<p>If their proposal had offered a better way to achieve the much needed objective of providing universal insurance (or at least coverage for the 30 million aided by the reform legislation), then that might be something worth looking at.  But they haven&#8217;t bothered to do that.  And regretably, the &#8220;free market&#8221; alternatives that they pushed during the discussion of the existing bill don&#8217;t promise much.  We&#8217;ve had a free market in insurance for decades.  That&#8217;s why we have a problem.  INsurance is too lightly regulated, with companies able to pit state against state and get by with almost no regulation.  Insurers put profits first, and have become notorious for denying coverage for technical faults that shouldn&#8217;t result in denial of coverage or just delaying payments for so long that insureds end up suffering significant economic damage that the insurance plan was supposed to prevent.  They write policies intended to provide skimpy coverage for those who aren&#8217;t likely to need it, and shun people who are likely to need medical expense assistance since they are the ones that keep their profits from soaring even higher. </p>
<p>The Republicans&#8217; primary idea of &#8220;reform&#8221;?&#8211;allowing sales of insurance across state lines and enacting tort reform.  See, e.g., <a href="http://twitter.com/RepShimkus">tweets from Rep. Shimkus</a>, including <a href="http://twitter.com/RepShimkus/status/27787179107287041">this one </a>(Jan. 19, 2011) re &#8220;we will allow sale of insurance across state lines, allow sm biz to join together to purchase plans, enact meaningful tort reform.&#8221;</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s consider tort reform.  What David Hylton and others have shown is that there is really no need for tort reform.  Awards have actually not been skyrocketing, and the tort process works fairly well to provide a remedy that would otherwise be missing for medical malpractice&#8211;such as when the wrong arm or leg gets operated on or the wrong organ implanted, etc.  Hospitals have adopted better oversight because of tort cases that challenge them to greater competency.  Tort reform as preached by most Republicans amounts to a claim that any system that gives some measure of remedy and justice to ordinary victims is bad, because it cuts into the profits of insurers.  In other words, tort reform is a euphemism for politicians in the pockets of Big Medicine.</p>
<p>What about the idea of competing across state lines?  That&#8217;s the worst nonsolution imaginable&#8211;it removes the little bit of regulatory power that individual states have, lets companies troll for healthy customers by aiming their policies towards that clientele while rejecting those that they might have to pay for; and invites insurance companies to engage in the kind of &#8220;what favor will you do me&#8221; arbitrage that already has states sacrificing good policies to entice bad companies to &#8220;use&#8221; their subsidies.  Without strong federal regulation, it would be a health care disaster.  The idea is based on a ideological view of economics 101 that says that increasing competition will always improve the market place.  But that &#8220;law&#8221; of supply and demand doesn&#8217;t really work the way that economics 101 suggests in the first place, and it is even less of a reliable rule when we are talking about something like health care. </p>
<p>Let&#8217;s play the hypothetical game we love so well in law schools.  Imagine one state that requires hospitals and clinics to satisfy various requirements to operate and another that doesn&#8217;t.  Clinics that don&#8217;t have to satisfy requirements operate more cheaply.  And insurers that insure only patients who use those clinics can pay out less.  So that probably means you can get cheap insurance if you buy from a company that requires you to use those cheaper, unlicensed clinics.  Interested?  I doubt it. </p>
<p>These and many other issues would arise in a market where insurance companies could pit state against state to pick the regulatory regime that pleases them.  See, e.g., Ezra Klein, Selling Insurance across state lines: a terrible, no good, very bad health-care idea, Washinstong Post, Feb. 17, 2010 (noting what happened with the &#8220;freeing&#8221; of credit card banks do operate cross-border and concluding that such moves would not insure more Americans or save money but make insurance more expensive for the sick and maybe cheaper for the healthy&#8211;&#8220;a great proposal if you don&#8217;t ever plan to be sick and if you don&#8217;t mind finding out that your insurer doesn&#8217;t cover your illness&#8221;); <a href="http://www.individual-health-plans.com/blog/insurance-across-state-lines/">Why Buying Health Insurance Across State Lines Minght Not be a Good Idea</a>;  <a href="http://www.democraticunderground.com/discuss/duboard.php?az=view_all&#038;address=389x7767116">Allowing health insurers to sell across state lines is a BAD idea</a> on Democratic Underground (suggesting that our experience in opening up the credit card interest is a good warning, since credit card banks moved to the states that allowed the highest interest rates).  So insurance across state lines is likely to be a race to the bottom in health care coverage, with a race to the top in premium pricing for anyone who really may have a serious illness that needs to be covered.   The result would likely be cheap coverage for healthy individuals that mostly don&#8217;t need it and out-of-sight expensive coverage (but still probably unsatisfactory) for those who do.</p>
<p>In other words, the primary plan that the Republicans have offered so far as their panacea for &#8220;reforming&#8221; health care is one that is of great benefit to Big Insurance (allowing it to select the regulations it wants to abide with and make profits from healthy people while disregarding those who may really need insurance) and dastardly for <strong>all of us </strong>who will, inevitably, get sick or have an accident and need medical care.   Only a universal, national plan of some kind will satisfactorily address spiraling medical costs and growing medical needs.</p>
<p>Further, the Republicans have been utter hypocrites in the way they have dealt with this.  They say they oppose the bill at least in part because it will be costly.  Let&#8217;s evaluate that.  FactCheck.org shows that their claim that it will &#8220;add over $700 billion in red ink over the next decade&#8221; is simply &#8220;bogus.&#8221;  <a href="http://factcheck.org/2011/01/a-budget-busting-law/">A Budget-Busting Law</a>?, FactCheck.org, Jan. 19, 2011 (and the Democrats&#8217; claims are also exaggerated).  The Republicans conjure up $115 billion of administrative costs over the next ten years, but the CBO&#8211;our best arbiter on these issues&#8211;says those numbers are way too high and that the cost will be a modest 10-20 billion.  The Republicans claim that estimates that show costsavings are based on doublecounting, but the CBO is &#8220;simply not doing that&#8221;, according to FactCheck.  The Republicans have added in monies that they themselves want to spend to increase their claims about the law&#8217;s cost (as though that is bad)&#8211;even though they support that separate expenditure for the &#8220;medicare fix&#8221; for doctor payments and it is not even a part of the health reform law!  Id.</p>
<p>And they aren&#8217;t really serious about ensuring that we finally reform our health system to begin to address the costs.  If they don&#8217;t achieve repeal by the honest way, then they intend to exercise minority veto of the majority&#8217;s legislative preferences through trying to choke off money &#8211;both appropriations and the mandate that most employers provide a health insurance benefit for their workers.  As John Lewis noted &#8221; It is unbelievable that with so many people out of work and millions of people uninsured, the first act of this new Congress is to take health care away from people who just got coverage.&#8221;  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/20/health/policy/20cong.html">House Votes to Repeal Obama Health Care Law</a>, New York Times.</p>
<p>Further, they are being untrue to the basic principles of individual responsibility that they claim to support.  The individual mandate is a mechanism to ensure that people can&#8217;t choose not to buy insurance, using their funds for other needs, and then freeload off the system at the expense of all of the rest of us.  It is the only such mechanism that the Congress has been able to agree on in all of these post-war years when our peers in the developed world long ago found a way to achieve universal coverage at a decent cost.  Yet instead of decrying freeloading, the Republicans have decried the mandate as government intrusion.  That makes a good soundbite for the Fox-Hannity crowd, but it isn&#8217;t what&#8217;s going on.  And they aren&#8217;t offering any other solution to the problem.</p>
<p>You want to know what I think, really?  I am in one of these very pessimistic moods.  The Democrats weren&#8217;t able to use their majority wisely but wasted it trying to achieve &#8220;bipartisanship&#8221; rather than honing their message about how government can and does serve the people to help people separate the huge amount of pseudo-news chaff from the hearty grain of information that we need to have a sustainable democracy.  Now we&#8217;ve got the Republican minority calling the tunes in Congress&#8211;or at least making it even harder to do anything decent .  And as long as the Senate sticks to the stupid tradition of allowing a minority to veto any decision it doesn&#8217;t like through the filibuster rule, that will continue. </p>
<p>Because the reality is that the Republicans don&#8217;t want to address the real problems that face this country.  They just want to keep mouthing the same old shibboleths of &#8220;free market&#8221; and &#8220;competition&#8221; and &#8220;property rights&#8221; that they have used for so long to further the interests of the monied upper class, no matter what the result for the US economy and the public weal.  They want to oppose progressive policies (even ones that were proposed first by Republicans).  And they don&#8217;t give a damn about whether the 50 million uninsured Americans can get decent health care.  They don&#8217;t even give a damn about addressing long-term fiscal needs of the country.  They just want to fire workers (especially ones that are unionized) so that bosses and owners can take home even more of the profits, and let Business go on as usual.</p>

                                <p>From Open Congress Nov 15, 2009 <a target="_blank" href="http://www.opencongress.org/articles/view/1357-The-Most-Important-Health-Care-Reform-Provision-You-ve-Never-Heard-Of">The Most Important Health Care Reform Provision You&#8217;ve Never Heard Of</a><br />
<blockquote>For months, Bruce Webb has been tracking a provision in the House’s health care bills that has flown mostly under the radar. He calls it the “most important and most overlooked” aspect of the bills, and he may be right.<br />The provision in question is entitled “Ensuring Value and Lower Premiums.” In all of Congress’ health care bills it reads more or less like this:<br />&#8220;In General- Each health insurance issuer that offers health insurance coverage in the small or large group market shall provide that for any plan year in which the coverage has a medical loss ratio below a level specified by the Secretary (but not less than 85 percent), the issuer shall provide in a manner specified by the Secretary for rebates to enrollees of the amount by which the issuer’s medical loss ratio is less than the level so specified.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>In the end after much travail the Senate settled on a last minute 85/80 MLR between group and individual coverage, but the overall effect should be the same. And if anyone in the blogosphere beat me to this piece from July 28th, 2009 <a target="_blank" href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2009/07/hr3200-sec-116-golden-bullet-or-smoking.html">HR3200 Sec 116: Golden Bullet or Smoking Gun</a> I&#8217;d like to hear it. With effective MLR regulation HCR works, without it it doesn&#8217;t. Which may explain why AHIP was broadly supportive of the bill until the MLR provision was restored at the last minute. And have been howling ever since.<br />
<blockquote>This provision, if implemented correctly, almost totally strips the ability of insurance companies to combine cherry picking and premium increases to continue the huge profits they garner today. What it does is to establish a minimum &#8216;medical loss ratio&#8217; which in simpler terms means a set ratio of care actually paid for to premiums collected. If by whatever means whether that be gaming the risk pool so an to only insure people unlikely to make claims or by denying coverage to insurees on a case by case basis your medical loss ratio drops below an established level the insurance company has to rebate the difference. In practice this prevents insurance companies from just arbitrarily jacking up rates and simultaneously takes the profit out of cherry-picking the risk pool. In a word this Sec automatically limits profits by establishing indirect price controls. Which is not going to make the insurance industry happy.</p></blockquote>
<p>And no it didn&#8217;t. You read it here first. If you read it.</p>
