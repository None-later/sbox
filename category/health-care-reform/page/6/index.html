<p>Well me neither. I read through the Tri-Committee and HELP Bills and the Senate Finance Committee&#8217;s Chairman&#8217;s Mark and then both the Pelosi and Reid versions as introduced and followed as best I could the last minute revisions introduced by the Team of Ten but as I type I have yet to actually slog through the text as passed on Sunday night. I think I know what is in the bill and what was signed into law a few minutes ago but I don&#8217;t actually know. But I will. And you can too. And then maybe follow up with the proposed text of the reconciliation fix.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-h3590/show">H.R.3590 &#8211; Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act</a><br />Given that this is the same bill as was passed by the Senate on Dec 24th some of you may be ahead of me here. But this is the law as it stands this morning Tuesday March 23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.opencongress.org/house_reconciliation">Health Care Bill &#8211; H.R. 4872 &#8211; Reconciliation Act of 2010</a><br />Hmm, I didn&#8217;t realize until just now that the Reconciliation Bill was in the form of a Substitute, meaning that absent any changes mandated by the Parliamentarian or other amendments approved by the Senate this would be the actual final version of the law to be sometime later this month.</p>
<p>Links to our friends (or at least my friend) at Open Congress.org. I am going to take some time and read through the bill and settle out what I think I know from reading all the previous iterations and what we are really dealing with going forward: 300% of FPL or 400%, 11% max out of pocket or 12% or 8.5%? It has been a blizzard of changing numbers. But soon enough it will be what it will be, time to dig down into the data in the true Angry Bear spirit.</p>
<p>Bon appetit!! And consider this an open topical Health Care thread.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p><em>Note: This is “what I believe I said,” not“what I would have said” and is presented here solely to document the confluences that were, perhaps, clearer in my head than they were in the presentation itself.  As such, several references here are echoes of earlier pieces of the presentation. (Links to same will be updated as soon as possible.)<br /></em>
<p>To review, there are three standard methods of reducing a fiscal debt: default, inflate, and taxation and/or budget cutting.  I believe it is clear that default is not desirable; the historic examples of 1917 Russia and the State of Louisiana are clear indicators that issues persist long after the act itself, and the recent suffering of the Argentineans in 2002 and 2003 clearly shows that, even at the time, default is at best a problematic solution, more an amputation than a lancing.</p>
<p>The second, moderate inflation, has the collateral issue that some of the assumed benefits of an inflationary policy—especially an inflationary policy in an environment with a relatively low savings rate—do not accrue to the country whose currency is the dominant one in the world.  As I noted earlier, David Beckworth is doing some research in this area, and I look forward to seeing the results.It seems safe to assume that the benefits of inflation will not accrue in the way a model might predict, and therefore “solving” the problem with inflation will require a suboptimal level to achieve optimal policy.  The chance of having to repeat “the Volcker experiment” would not be small, while the likelihood of success would not be so large.</p>
<p>Budget cutting is an abiding idea. While I’m perfectly willing to stipulate that one might be able to cut around 1% of GDP from the US defense budget, and that some direct consumption—though much of this is a State and Local issue more than a Federal one—might be reducible, this appears unlikely to have more than a marginal effect. While we like—indeed, make a living from identifying—marginal effects, the magnitude of the issue at hand requires more.  Since we generally can stipulate that transfer payments are at worst neutral (or, by Jim Baker’s “supply-side/conspicuous consumption” theory presented earlier, likely beneficial to both the velocity of money and overall tax revenues), gains from there will, at best, not help the team.</p>

</p>
<p>This leaves taxation, and it is perfectly reasonable to assume that taxation can be increased. Except that, as you can see from the graphic I have left on the screen, we have a large deadweight loss in health care spending. We spend approximately 6% more, on a percent-of-GDP basis, than the next country, with no noticeable economic value-added.  Having that deadweight loss hanging over the economy limits options—possibly as much or more than being the dominant currency.  And since the basic premise of this panel appears to be that we would prefer that the US Dollar remain the dominant world currency—that is, becoming the 21st century equivalent of 20th century Britain not being a desired outcome—we are left to the reality that we cannot solve the budget crisis without reducing or eliminating much of the deadweight loss in the health-care system.</p>
<p>Were we to solve only half of the difference and transfer that amount to tax revenues, we would solve the budget deficit without adding any drag to the economy, effectively substituting tax revenues for cost overruns. We would, in short, have produced a better team: a better engine for growth and a greater potential for entrepreneurial opportunity, even if a groundskeeper becomes underutilized in the process.</p>
<p>The most viable alternative to addressing the deficit by addressing the deadweight loss in the health-care system appears to be to yield our place as the world’s Reserve currency of choice. There does not appear to be much of an appetite for that, even if there were a clear mechanism to do so.</p>
<p>As economists we look for the suboptimal.  In this case, we can identify the areas where the returns are low—defense spending—the areas where spending growth might be moderated—Government Direct Consumption, although that is a very nominal portion of the Federal budget—and areas where there are clear deadweight losses—health care spending.  Only the latter shows much promise as a direct, not just a marginal, way to address the problem.</p>

<p>Whence Teabaggery?</p>
<p>Opponents of Health Care Reform vow to keep up their efforts and sweep Republicans to victory in November. But where do they take their stand? Up to now they have been opposing potential legislation that existed mostly in their own imagination: Socialized Medicine, Obamacare, Government Bureaucrats between You and Your Doctor. But now that the die is cast, because in the bigger picture the reconciliation bill is just tinkering around the edges, what will actually change for the average Teabagger?</p>
<p>Will they have to get government approval to see a doctor? Well no. Will there be dramatic changes in their out of pocket expenses? Well no, if anything the change will be in the other direction. Will insurance or the hospital start denying them categories of care? Well no, same thing. The fact is that if you already have insurance, and from the looks of most of the Teabag crowd they already do, you will see zero change between now and November. At least negative change.</p>
<p>Will the passage of Obamacare put us on the path to Socialized Medicine? Well maybe, personally I believe that the changes in this bill will over the long-term drive change in that direction. But will anyone notice any big changes in the interim? Well no. And what changes they do notice will be positive, at least in the short run, because the sweeteners in the bill are front-loaded. More under the fold.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />I know a young bartender in a Chinese restaurant that has a congenital condition in her leg. Nothing particularly disabling but enough to prevent her from buying insurance in the private market, like almost everyone in the hospitality industry except workers in big hotels she is on her own, if she gets sick enough to need to see a doctor it means cash payment at the Walk-In Clinic or a trip 20 miles North to the only Free Clinic in our area. Now if she gets really sick she is lucky enough to live in a city where the two main hospitals are operated by the Sisters of Providence who have an excellent record of writing off the costs of hospital stays for those who can&#8217;t afford to pay, God Bless the Nuns, but unless that case of flu has progressed to pneumonia my bartender is relying on tips to pay off the doctor.</p>
<p>Well under this bill she has some near immediate options. It establishes a High Risk Pool plan which would allow her to buy insurance that would cover her congenital condition and any illness that would require hospitalization. Given her income level she might not be able to afford the unsubsidized premiums, but then she has family that would probably help if the interim, her Dad has a new job as a government lawyer in DC and could probably throw some dollars her way until the Exchange and its subsidies kick in, whereas right now she couldn&#8217;t get insurance coverage at any price. And she is not alone here, I am in that same category, insurance companies would simply laugh if I applied. Under this new bill and right away, if you apply for insurance through a private company and are denied, or are offered insurance at an unaffordable rate you will be eligible for the new High Risk Pool. Yes it will be expensive and no maybe you won&#8217;t be able to afford it normally but if it comes right down to it that insurance will be available. </p>
<p>I suppose there may be a teabagger or two who doesn&#8217;t know anyone in the position of my bartender friend or me, who doesn&#8217;t know someone working in a service job or at a store making too much to qualify for Medicaid but not enough to pay for insurance. Maybe some of these people have never walked past a collection jar on the counter raising funds for an otherwise unaffordable operation for some local kid, never heard an appeal for donations for a fellow church-goer, but somehow I doubt it, when you lower this to the concrete level it is not all about giving health care to brown people in the inner city, in fact many of those people have access to health care, it is about people they rub shoulders against every day.</p>
<p>The Republican Party is betting that its supporters will remain white-hot over an abstraction that will have little to zero impact on their own lives but will have huge positive impacts on people in their own communities. If you are middle class and insured you will probably see no changes at all in the next six months, on the other hand the waitress down at the cafe might be able to finally enroll in a health plan. Or you might finally be able to consider the possibility of an early retirement rather than holding onto your job waiting for Medicare to kick in. How long will Boehner and Beck, themselves wealthy white men with health care paid for, be able to whip people up over abstractions like &#8216;Obamacare&#8217; in the face of day to day reality?</p>

<blockquote>Since the enactment of Chapter 58, Massachusetts has increased the percentage of employers offering coverage to their employees. With the employer offer rate up 4% over two year, to 76%, we are climbing well above the national average of 60%. This increase occurred in spite of the recession. Most employees (80%) who are eligible for employer-sponsored insurance choose to enroll. There are large (and predictable) differences between small and large employers, with the small employers less likely to offer health insurance.</p></blockquote>

<p>Also I would like some links to current and historical numbers on Medical Loss Ratios. I found some claims from a commenter at Dean Baker&#8217;s Meet the Press (and past commenter here) that CMS (Medicare) numbers showed a MLR ratio for private insurance right at 88% and holding over the last few years. A little work on my own showed that MLR for for-profit private insurance ranged between 76% and 84% at around the same time. The difference can not be accounted for by profit alone, that would only explain about half of the difference. Unless of course those who were claiming &#8216;average&#8217; 3% profit margins were also including non-profits in the calculations. So lets have links aplenty in comments, with some commentary making clear whether those figures include non-profits in the calculation.</p>
<p>Best links &#038; commentary will be lifted and put under the fold. Plus when I find one a link to the current bill text (or commenters can help there as well).<br /><a name="more"></a><br />TBD</p>

<p>I just listened to the <a href="http://crooksandliars.com/john-amato/howard-dean-wendell-potter-mike-lux-hea">conference call</a> with Gov. Dean and Wendall Potter. <br />Toward the very end of the call, the issue of medical loss ratio regulation came up. Seems like a reasonable thing to regulate especially if we are going to get Chicago School of Economics style health care reform implemented via the Shock Doctrine method. (Yes, I&#8217;ve finally started that book and I&#8217;ve got to say, what is happening here with health care reform reads all too familiar.) </p>
<p>Unfortunately, according to Gov. Dean, the CBO keeps scoring MLR regulation as a hit (as in mafia take down) to the budget. Seem from CBO&#8217;s perspective, if you regulate that the MLR can be no less than somewhere around 90%, such a number placed on profit ability makes all of the nation&#8217;s health care a government budget item. Thus, something like $2.5 trillion gets added to the budget numbers.</p>
<p>Funny thing this CBO view. Basically this means that I (We the People) can mandate that I buy insurance, that I can only buy it from the private market, that I can write the rules of the market that I buy into, but I can&#8217;t tell a corporation that is granted a privilege by me to spend it&#8217;s money on the product it has been granted a privilege to provide?  </p>
<p>Maybe the CBO figures because I decided to help some people in buying the mandated insurance, that by regulating the MLR, I&#8217;m making that money a greater expense on the budget because now 90% is going to health care services and not 70%? I really can&#8217;t figure this one. Is the CBO really saying that I (and you) the government, can not assure that I&#8217;m going to get my money&#8217;s worth? How come this issue does not come up when the government negotiates drug prices for the VA? </p>
<p>I really think, after watching our congress deal with health care, finance reform, military, that we have a bigger problem in this nation regarding economics and who is the boss here than we are willing to admit. Hint: It&#8217;s We the People who is the government.  It just seems that we have definitely, completely entered the realm of reality where &#8220;the market&#8221; is the purpose and not the means.  We have been turned to existing to serve &#8220;the market&#8221;.  We have put &#8220;the market&#8221; before all our needs and desires for us as people.  This is primitive idolizing behavior.  This is sick.</p>
<p>I have to go plow now.</p>

                                <blockquote><p>I don&#8217;t pretend to know Joe Lieberman&#8217;s motivation, but it&#8217;s working to perfection if his goal is to divide Party leaders (Obama, Reid, etc.) from the Democratic progressive base. I don&#8217;t remember seeing this level of outrage from movement progressives before, and I wonder if the only possible way to quell it is to secure Snowe&#8217;s vote for reform and then remove Lieberman from his chairmanship. I&#8217;m not necessarily advocating that, but many people (including many on the Hill) believe that he is playing us for chumps (not waiting for the CBO score of the Medicare buy-in, opposing something he advocated a couple of months ago), and there need to be consequences. It&#8217;s not an easy decision, though, and I don&#8217;t envy Reid.</p></blockquote>
<p> Let me help this Hill staffer out, because I am suspecting Joe&#8217;s motivation is as clear as A B C, or more precisely M L R. More below the fold.<a name="more"></a> Why did buy-in become a deal breaker? Why did the CBO score no longer make a difference? Maybe because that was not the issue at all. Lets take a trip in the Way-Back Machine.</p>
<p>Back at the end of July I suggested that the most important section of the House version of the Health Care Bill had simply been overlooked and that its existence made apparent weaknesses of the bill go away and fully justified (from their perspective) insurance company resistance to the bill even as it delivered to them 30 million new customers. <a target="_blank" href->Sec 116: Golden Bullet or Smoking Gun</a>. Sec 116 set up a mandatory minimum Medical Loss Ratio (MLR) for each plan in the exchange and ultimately every plan in the country meaning that private insurance would have to learn to live on a diet. All of their in house expenses from advertising to executive salaries to profit would have to come out of a fixed ratio of premium dollar to actual payments to providers with that ratio set by the Health Choices Commissioner. It was pretty clear to me then that private insurers would see this as the smoking gun that would ultimately would force them to leave the health insurance market in search of weaker game to prey on (because once you remove the opportunity to make fat profits by denying care what the hell fun is there?) Making Sec 116 Target One.</p>
<p>My fears were realized. While the HELP version of the bill had a stricter version, it was nowhere to be seen in the Senate Finance Chairman&#8217;s Mark. And while both the House Speaker&#8217;s and Majority Leader&#8217;s versions of the bill had some of the relevant language in each case it no longer applied to plans offered through the Exchange but only as an interim cost control measure while the Exchange was being set up. <a target="_blank" href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/11/hr3962-as-passed-importance-of-close.html">HR 3962 as Passed: the Importance of Close Reading</a>. HR 3962 had alternate mechanisms to ensure profit controls, but they lacked the elegance and certainty of Sec 116, on this important issue the private insurers had won.</p>
<p>Well a funny thing happened on the way to Victory Lane. In the course of private insurance supporters attempts to eliminate any trace of a government competitor in the form of a public option something happened. At the last minute progressives apparently in the midst of caving to every demand inserted one provision. They brought back the slain Sec 116 with a vengence by insisting that they get in exchange for the PO a MLR of 90% which was about the same ratio as insurance companies were getting in 1996 but a good ten points higher than they get now, and much higher than their current target. After all Aetna just announced plans to drop 360,000 people from its roles explicitly to get their margins up by getting their MLR down. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/12/04/aetna-forcing-600000-plus_n_380130.html">Aetna Forcing 600,000-Plus To Lose Coverage In Effort To Raise Profits</a><br />
<blockquote>&#8220;The pricing we put in place for 2009 turned out to not really be what we needed to achieve the results and margins that we had historically been delivering,&#8221; said chairman and CEO Ron Williams. &#8220;We view 2010 as a repositioning year, a year that does not fully reflect the earnings potential of our business. Our pricing actions should have a noticeable effect beginning in the first quarter of 2010, with additional financial impact realized during the remaining three quarters of the year.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p> This was Dec 4th, an open admission that Aetna&#8217;s MLR was too high for stockholder comfort and that forcing 600,000 people off their rolls and so perhaps not being able to afford coverage anywhere being just the price they had to pay for profits.</p>
<p>News of a requirement that all companies had to meet an MLR of 90% must have come as quite the shock to CEO Williams and all his colleagues in the industry, it blew a huge hole in a business plan that relied on only insuring people who were unlikely to actually make claims and yet would be willing to pay higher premiums just in case. Yet it put them in a bind. How do you actively propose the bill simply on the basis that it would cut your profit margin? Simple. You just get your barking seals in Congress to claim that it is all a matter of principle, that an opt-in Medicare plan that you enthusiastically endorsed three months ago was now a deal-breaker, all without any of the letters R L or M dropping from your lips.</p>
<p>A lot of what is otherwise inexplicable about Lieberman and even Snowe&#8217;s current stance falls into place when you rearrange those letters into M-L-R. Don&#8217;t wait for the score, don&#8217;t insist on a full reading of the bill before passing judgement, insurance companies know all that they need to know for an all-out drive to kill the bill: &#8220;MLR 90%&#8221;.</p>

<p>Yes, that&#8217;s the same Joe Lieberman who told a Hartford newspaper that it was good idea three months ago.<br />
<blockquote>Sen. Evan Bayh (D., Ind.) said Democrats agreed that the dispute over Medicare shouldn&#8217;t hold up legislation that would extend coverage to tens of millions of Americans.</p></blockquote>
