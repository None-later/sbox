                                <p>The International Federation of Health Plans released its 2010 report today. (PDF <a href="http://www.ifhp.com/documents/IFHPPricereportfinal.pdf">here</a>.)</p>
<p>The good news is that the problem is clear: Americans pay too much <em>for the same services</em>.  The bad news is (1) we&#8217;ve known that for years and (2) the factions who are gaining these excessive rents want to keep their sinecures.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;ve said this <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/10/obamacare-is-working-thats-why-its.html">before</a>.  That it remains true is as true as &#8220;that which cannot go on will not go on.&#8221;</p>
<p>How it ends—its <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/10/eschatology.html">eschaton</a>, as it were—is what is being discussed.  Hint to doctors:  You are the farmers of the 2010s; you will lose either way. (Think 1994 all over again, this time with a vengeance.)</p>

                                <p>Brad DeLong notes <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2010/11/bad-news-for-health-care-cost-containment.html">an experiment subject (as is the wont of the Obama Administration to date) to regulatory capture</a>:<br />
<blockquote>In a surprising move, the Obama administration will extend special bonus payments meant to reward top-performing Medicare Advantage insurers to those that score only average ratings&#8230;.The law says bonuses, which start in 2012, would go to insurers that scored at least four out of five “stars” on a set of quality measurements. Instead, a “demonstration project” authorized by Medicare officials will extend bonus payments to plans that score at least three stars. Based on this year’s star ratings, the change means 62 percent of all Medicare Advantage insurers&#8230;will qualify for the quality bonuses, compared with only 14 percent of plans under the health law provisions.</p></blockquote>
<p>If those figures are accurate, then 48% (62-14) of all M.A. insurers are judged to provide &#8220;average&#8221; (three star) quality.</p>
<p>Perhaps more importantly, 38% (100-62) are judged to be substandard.  (The good news is that those M.A. insurers have <em>only</em> 16% of the market. The bad news is that they <em>have</em> 16% of the market.)</p>
<p>In the optimistic version, the new structure facilitates culling the worst of the herd while not damaging that plurality of users who are receiving &#8220;average&#8221; care.  </p>
<p>The pessimistic version is to suspect that those 16% who receive substandard care are in non-competitive markets, and will therefore end up, for the next three years, paying more for the privilege of being ill-served and then receive only marginal benefit from the HIEs.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m uncertain whether Dr. DeLong is a pessimist, or is just looking at the additional short-term spending and ignoring that the endgame is to have quality providers in the HIE, and punishing the bulk of the market for the ills of the few this early will make improvements later on less effective.</p>
<p>Then again, I&#8217;m uncertain whether I should trust that the Administration knows what it&#8217;s doing on its Signature Issue.  Which is, <a href="http://digbysblog.blogspot.com/2010/11/ooops-guess-whos-more-trusted-on-social.html">as Digby noted in another context</a>, rather more the problem for that Administration.</p>

                                <p>On Econbrowser last week: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.econbrowser.com/archives/2010/11/the_impact_of_h.html">The Impact of Health Insurance Reform in Massachusetts</a>
</p>
<blockquote><p>The use of emergency rooms for routine care fell, as did hospital admissions for treating preventable conditions, and the proportion of uninsured among hospital inpatients (by 36%), while there was no increase in the growth of hospital costs. From the <a href="http://www.nber.org/digest/nov10/w16012.html"><i>NBER Digest</i> article</a> summarizing <a href="http://papers.nber.org/papers/w16012">NBER working paper 16012</a> <a href="http://www.econ.yale.edu/~ak669/w16012Oct10.pdf">[ungated version]</a> by <a href="http://www.med.upenn.edu/ldichi/JonathanKolstad.shtml">Jonathan T. Kolstad</a> and <a href="http://www.econ.yale.edu/faculty1/kowalski.htm">Amanda E. Kowalski</a>: <a name="more"></a> </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>The national health care legislation passed in March 2010 requires U.S. citizens to obtain health insurance coverage. Modeled on legislation passed in Massachusetts in 2006, the new federal law contains many provisions that are similar to that state&#8217;s reform, including new requirements for employers and expansions in subsidized health insurance. </p>
<p>&#8230;Using hospital discharge data, they conclude that the Commonwealth&#8217;s health insurance reform reduced the number of uninsured among the inpatient hospital population by 36 percent. The reform increased coverage most among: young adults and the near elderly, men, people from the lowest-income zip codes, and people identified as black and Hispanic. </p>
<p>Insurance coverage through Medicaid, the state-run federal program designed for low-income people, expanded by approximately 30 percent among nonelderly residents of Massachusetts. &#8230;</p>
<p>Use of hospital emergency rooms for routine care also declined after 2006: the reform’s expanded insurance coverage resulted in a 2 percentage point decrease in the fraction of hospital admissions from the emergency room. The reduction in emergency admissions was particularly pronounced among people in low-income areas of the state. </p>
<p>Hospital admissions for treating preventable conditions also fell. The authors find a decrease of 2.7 percentage points in inpatient admissions attributable to preventable conditions. </p>
<p>The authors note that the Massachusetts mandate for individual insurance coverage widened access to outpatient treatment and thus management of preventable conditions. Despite finding other hospital impacts, this study finds no evidence that hospital cost growth increased following the reform.</p>

                                <p>There was a question on what ACO meant for health care practices and as part of reform of current practices.  Rusty sends two links he thinks might help:</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.healthreformwatch.com/2010/03/11/a-guide-to-accountable-care-organizations-and-their-role-in-the-senates-health-reform-bill/">A guide to Accountable Care Organizations&#8230;</a> from Health Reform Watch offers a glimpse:</p>
<blockquote><p>Specifically, their findings illustrate that there exists wide variations in the cost of care across the country, and profoundly, that the regions that spend more per patient do not necessarily obtain better outcomes. So what to do? Dr. Fisher believes he has found at least part of the answer: the Accountable Care Organization, known as an “ACO”.</p></blockquote>
<p>And this one <a target="_blank" href="http://www.physicianspractice.com/conference-insider/mgma2010/content/article/1462168/1705064">here</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Thinking of selling your practice and switching to a hospital-employment model? If so, you&#8217;re not alone. In fact, if you aren&#8217;t already working as a hospital employee, you&#8217;re in the minority: Hospital employment among doctors has jumped from 25 percent in 2002 to 50 percent in 2008, according to the MGMA, and is probably even higher today.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>There’s a reason for <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2010_10/026344.php" target="_blank">this</a>.
</p>
<p>After <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/10/fire-tim-geithner-then-be-one-term.html" target="_blank">the (wholly justified, understated) bitterness of my last post</a>, a moment of cheer:  An old friend of mine is in the process of losing his job.</p>
<p>Now, normally I wouldn’t celebrate anyone—let alone a friend—losing a job, but, you see, he sells medical insurance in Texas and Indiana.  And he’s been told that over the next three years, his income will be reduced, and basically eliminated entirely ca. 2015.</p>
<p>Translation on a macro level: insurance companies—far from acting as if they are “uncertain”—are cutting the commissions they are paying to agents in preparation for greater competition as the phases of the PPACA come into effect.</p>
<p>We have already seen variations on this: insurance companies that will no longer write policies for only parents, because their children have other options.  Insurance companies complaining about the “cost” of having to cover basic services—you know, the <em>preventive care</em> that would seem to be implied when you call your plan a “Health Maintenance Organization” and which is covered by State Medicaid plans such as NJ FamilyCares.</p>
<p> <a name="more"></a>
<p>The English translation of “the market won’t support it” is “we can’t compete with our current structure.”  It is a tale told by a capitalist since the beginning of double-entry accounting, with the steel industry being a recent example of American Rebirth.) Economists us the phrase “creative destruction” to explain it, even though there is very little creative and a lot of destruction (or, in significant cases, structural shifting) that goes on at the time.</p>
<p>“Bending the cost curve” means producing more consumer surplus. This is what competition does in economic models, primarily by cutting margins (“excess <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_rent" target="_blank">rent</a>”) and thereby making firms allocate capital and labor more efficiently.  When your margins are large—through monopoly power, including “monopolist competition”—<a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/consumer_surplus.asp" target="_blank">consumer surplus</a> is low. Since Steve Jobs is the sexiest human being in the world, Apple products sell for higher margins than other communication/computing devices do.  This may always be so—or maybe the world will shift to Android phones, a and the Apple of five years from now will look like the Apple of 15 years ago, taking cash from Microsoft in order to survive.</p>
<p>Health insurance is an area hasn’t had true competition—search costs are too high for most people.  (Indeed, the evil of employer-provided health insurance deductibility isn’t that it is a suboptimal allocation of resources so much as it is that that pre-tax money allows insurance companies to maintain higher margins without the consumer feeling the full cost of their loss.  It is a system that perpetuates excess rent being paid, effectively as a transfer from the government to the insurer.)  One of the first things health economists noted about Medicare Part D is that, while one had to “shop” to find an insurer, the effort required meant that very few people would then <em>switch</em>, even if the insurer later reaped excess rent.  When switching costs (consumer) are higher than menu costs (supplier), excess rent is virtually an inevitability.  (In this case, again, the American taxpayer is footing a large portion of the bill for a transfer to insurance companies.  It is impossible to believe, given the bill’s enactment process, that this was not considered a feature.)</p>
<p>So there are multiple areas where consumer surplus is low in the health insurance industry.  Which means that many people—including my friend—have been “earning” more than they are “producing”—some of the excess rent is distributed, after all.  And, for the next few years, they will be seeing their incomes decline while people believe (as Jon Stewart said to Barack Obama last night) that PPACA will not take effect until 2014.</p>
<p>And Obama’s reply (starting around 7:30) was spot-on:</p>

<p>So for the next few years, people such as my friend will see that the squeeze is hitting them, while the benefits haven’t reached all of the general populace.  (They have already reached <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/31/health/policy/31health.html" target="_blank">many children</a>—<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient_Protection_and_Affordable_Care_Act#Effective_September_23.2C_2010" target="_blank">including adult children who can’t find a job and can at least be insured by their parents</a>—and helped <a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/80beats/2010/03/22/health-care-reform-passed-so-what-does-it-mean/" target="_blank">many senior citizens who were being affected by the “donut hole</a>.”)</p>
<p>We saw this same sequence in the mid-1980s and early 1990s in the travel field—slowly at first, and then quickly as internet bookings and purchases determined solely by price became the rule. The survivors were the agencies with large corporate accounts and the ones that provided specialty (“niche”) services you couldn’t get from Travelocity and its competitors.</p>
<p>The travel agency market existed for one reason: in the old days, it cost an airline about 16 cents of every dollar to get a seat booked.  An agent who could be paid 8-11% per ticket—with incentives for volume—was a bargain.  It was, to use the economist’s favorite cliché, a win-win situation. And the benefits of tour and hotel bookings could truly be treated as marginal cost increases, with their own revenue stream generally more than enough to justify for even a small office.</p>
<p>But true competition—the decline in the incremental Search Costs presented to consumers by Travelocity and its competitors, followed quickly by direct booking availability directly with a specific airline—meant the end of that model, leading to industry consolidation, downsizings, and closings—just as the insurance agents are feeling the pressure now of the impending “exchanges.”</p>
<p>And, as then, my friend noted that there are still areas that will continue to be profitable for insurance agents in 2015.  For insurance, policy service for the elderly.  (Showers of gratitude from the insurance agents to the unfunded, deficit-exploding Medicare Part D shall continue.)  Everything else will see the agents’s livelihood affected as the insurance companies try to protect their own share of the turf.</p>

                                <p>When the question is asked whether the Obama Administration are fools or liars—and <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/MayorEmanuel" target="_blank">a certain Chicago mayoral candidate</a> is often nominated as both—you can be certain discussion of “the public option” will come up.</p>
<p>It doesn’t come up directly in today’s FT (page 4 of the print edition; no link; I get the paper edition, and <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2010/oct/17/newspaper-abcs-websites-internet-news" target="_blank">there’s no relationship between the two</a>*), but it certainly abides in the plan put forth by Paul Ryan (R-<a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/06/ryan-predictions/" target="_blank">Innumeracy</a>) to de-reform health care reform:</p>
<blockquote><p>Congressman Paul Ryan…says he believes an arcane budgetary procedure known as reconciliation could be a vital tool for his party to scale back funding for some of the administration’s policies. Under congressional rules, bills passed under reconciliation—which must be related to budgetary issues—need only 51 votes to pass in the Senate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s that self-same “arcane budgetary procedure ” that provided an opportunity to pass an initial health care reform bill with “<a href="http://news.firedoglake.com/2010/02/22/landrieu-open-to-reconciliation-two-more-for-public-option/" target="_blank">the</a> <a href="http://firedoglake.com/2009/09/25/howard-dean-reconciliation-will-cause-public-option-to-be-available-sooner/" target="_blank">public</a> <a href="http://fdlaction.firedoglake.com/2010/01/21/public-option-resurrected-from-near-death-thanks-to-special-election-reconciliation/" target="_blank">option</a>.” Strangely—feel free to Google for evidence—the Republican opposition to using reconciliation was varied and loud.  Now, it’s about to be their touchstone for dealing with health care budgeting.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2010/10/05/public_option" target="_blank">Glenn Greenwald</a> and <a href="http://news.firedoglake.com/2010/10/05/the-deal-with-the-hospital-industry-to-kill-the-public-option/" target="_blank">D-Day</a> have made the case that the Obama Administration were liars, not fools, when they declared they couldn’t pass the public option during the reconciliation process.  On the off chance we still believe they were only fools, it will be interesting—or, for some of us, horrifying—to see their reaction to an open declaration that the reconciliation process is fair game when used to reach Republican goals.</p>

                                <p>by Bruce Webb</p>
<p>There is a great deal of chatter these days about how Obama lost &#8216;Progressives&#8217;, what Robert Gibbs derisively called the &#8216;Professional Left&#8217; or the &#8216;Left of the Left&#8217;, and as an example you could read this from Peter Daou <a target="_blank" href="http://peterdaou.com/2010/09/liberal-bloggers-are-bringing-down-the-obama-presidency/">How a handful of liberal bloggers are bringing down the Obama presidency</a> and the following key graph:<br />
<blockquote>With each passing day, I’m beginning to realize that the crux of the problem for Obama is a handful of prominent progressive bloggers, among them Glenn Greenwald, John Aravosis, Digby, Marcy Wheeler and Jane Hamsher*.<br />Virtually all the liberal bloggers who have taken a critical stance toward the administration have one thing in common: they place principle above party. Their complaints are exactly the same complaints they lodged against the Bush administration. Contrary to the straw man posed by Obama supporters, they aren’t complaining about pie in the sky wishes but about tangible acts and omissions, from Gitmo to Afghanistan to the environment to gay rights to secrecy and executive power.</p></blockquote>
<p> But a couple of things stand out here. First this is an awfully self-referential list, Digby aside it is pretty much the core of the Purity Party who were never on-board the Obama bandwagon to start with. Again Digby partially aside, these people are the modern descendants of the New Left which formed itself explicitly against the Old Liberals and organized itself around topics and principles pretty peripheral to the New Dealers and New Frontier types, anti-colonialism, the Green movement, gay rights all would have been acknowledged as important in principle, but not central. In particular you could be a straight down the line ADA Liberal without endorsing extreme environmentalism or Liberation Theology or marriage equality, there was nothing odd about a midwestern urban Catholic union worker liberal who rejected them all. That is the co-option of Progressive/New Left/Purity Party term of the term &#8216;liberal&#8217; in the way Daou explicitly does here is to me off the mark, most of these people don&#8217;t meet the classic definition of &#8216;Liberal&#8217; to start with.</p>
<p>But there is I think no doubt that Obama came into office with both New Dealers and New Democrats in his corner even as the Progressives Hamsher et al were already leery, and that we can identify what  I am calling the Spitting (sic) moment that split the former two groups and mostly left the first group on the outside. And while the realities of politics today may never have allowed Obama to satisfy the FirePups entirely, the choice to alienate the New Dealers was freely made in the summer of 2009, Obama had a chance to reform the New Deal Coalition and even to drag Progressives along with him (as FDR did in the thirties,) but frankly he blew it, and badly. And the decision point was&#8212;-? To be discussed under the fold.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />First the preliminary action. In the immediate wake of the 2008 election House Democrats made an immense move, they outsted John Dingell as Chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Chairman and replaced him with Henry Waxman, the latter being thought better able to shape and put through the Obama environmental and energy policies, an area in which Dingell, diehard supporter of Detroit and its auto industry, had been a drag for decades. In return Dingell got thrown a big juicy bone, he retained ownership of his signature issue, one he had introduced legislation on for fifty plus years, and continuing a legacy his father had begun even earlier, Universal Health Care. Specifically he was tasked with being lead author of a bill to be considered by all three committees with jurisdiction: Energy and Commerce, Ways and Means, and Education and Labor. And in due course what would be known informally as the Tri-Committee Bill and by number HR3200 was introduced to all three Committees on July 14th <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2009/7/14/753349/-House-Tri-Committee-Healthcare-Reform-Bill-Introduced-Today">House Tri-Committee Healthcare Reform Bill Introduced Today</a></p>
<p>In the meantime the Senate HELP Committee at first under the daily leadership of Dingell&#8217;s comrade in arms Ted Kennedy (who had spent almost as many decades pushing health care as Dingell and who in the previous Congress(es) had introduced what was known as <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pnhp.org/news/2007/april/kennedydingell_medi.php">Kennedy Dingell: Medicare for All</a>) and then after Kennedy&#8217;s health slipped under the leadership of  his number two at HELP Chris Dodd worked away to put forth their own version <a target="_blank" href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2009/07/kennedy-dodd-help-bill-with-cbo-scoring.html">Affordable Health Choices Act</a>.</p>
<p>Before the end of the month HR3200 had been passed through the House Tri-Committees, although with some modifications to satisfy Blue Dogs on Energy and Commerce and AHCA had been approved by Senate HELP though watered down at the insistence of  Senate moderates with the following end result:<br />
<blockquote>House Tri-Committee: Ten year addition to budget $1.082 trillion. Total coverage non-elderly: 94%. Coverage for legal non-elderly: 97%<br />Senate HELP: Ten year addition to deficit: $597 billion. Total coverage non-elderly 88%. Coverage for legal non-elderly 90%.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now in comparing the two bills a few things stuck out. One although the bills were clearly the work product of Dingell on the House side and Kennedy on the Senate side neither final product had much resemblance to the previous Congress&#8217;s Kennedy-Dingell Medicare for All, instead both bills met Obama&#8217;s campaign promise that if Americans liked what they had, they could keep it, which meant preserving the role for private insurers in the system. Two each bill included a robust public option, also part of Obama&#8217;s platform. Three each already came pre-compromised with the moderates in both parties, particularly Senate HELP. And four, and most important, the HELP Bill was missing huge chunks. Where the Tri-Committees were able to work across jurisdictional lines, each presumedly taking the lead on the section under the jurisdiction of each of the three, Senate HELP did not have jurisdiction over either the Medicare or revenue components, both under the jurisdiction of Senate Finance. Which brings us to the decision point:</p>
<p>Senate Finance Committee Baucus bucked. Instead of merging the appropriate pieces of the Tri-Committee and HELP Bills and then appending his version of the Medicare and funding parts, he simply asserted ownership of the entire bill. Nope he would just  scrap EVERYTHING and craft his own version from scratch. What is more he would do this NOT under regular Committee order where the Senate Finance Sub-Committee on Health Care and its Chairman Rockefeller would have a major voice, but instead form a working group that would move direct to  a final deal on his terms. In effect he spit right in the face of both Dingell and Kennedy, tough shit that they had spent a combined 100 years on this and that Kennedy was clearly in his last months of life, this was going to be the Baucus Bill or maybe the Baucus-Grassley Bill. And with a third mouthful he spat right in the face of Rockefeller and by extension all Democratic progressives and liberals, this bill would be shaped by what was originally a Gang of Seven that included four Republicans and then when Hatch dropped out by a Gang of Six evenly split between the parties and expressly sidelining anyone to left of center. Instead HCR would be shaped by two Conservadems, one moderate Dem, two Conservative Republicans, and one moderate Dem. I discussed the make-up of the Gang of Six in this post from July 29, 2009 <a target="_blank" href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2009/07/was-it-gang-of-seven.html">Was it a Gang of Seven</a>. Note that it doesn&#8217;t just flout the concept of majority rule, and ignores the ideological makeup of the Democratic caucus, it systematically excludes the interests of large and/or coastal and/or urban States.</p>
<p>It was a straight out power grab by Baucus. And out of some bizarre desire for Senate Comity above all things (Reid) or an equally bizarre belief in accomplishing some mythical, mystical Post-Partisanship (Obama) the Majority Leader of the Senate and the President of the U.S. simply turned over the keys to the HCR  car to a guy representing less than 1/3rd of 1% of the American population. Which if it had worked would have been okay, although you can bet the final product would have been a lot crappier from a liberal perspective than either HR3200 or Senate HELP, but it didn&#8217;t, instead the Committee deadlocked for almost half a year forcing first Baucus and then Reid  to produce their own versions just in time to get bogged down by the Christmas Holidays. What had been at the introduction of the Tri-Committee Bill and Senate HELP a one month process to be finished prior to the August 2009 recess instead dragged into the next year and  with it sucked all of the enthusiasm out of the New Deal faction of the Democratic Party. A group who had spent much of that late Summer and Fall defending the Obama Administration against the Purity Party Progressives, surely in the end he wouldn&#8217;t just  sell us out!</p>
<p>But Obama did. And along the way showed additional contempt for Liberals by agreeing to a Catfood Commission almost  as loaded to the center-right and right as the Gang of Six, and seemingly devoted to tearing away the centerpiece of the New Deal in the name of Social Security &#8216;Reform&#8217; and &#8216;Fiscal Responsibility&#8217;. The only thing lacking was a &#8216;No Dogs, Irishmen or New Dealers&#8217; sign on the South Lawn. How do you get the New Dealers back on board? How do you close the Enthusiasm Gap among those who were among your biggest boosters and defenders during the HCR fiasco? How about stop pissing on FDR&#8217;s grave and telling us you are just watering the flowers?</p>

                                <p>I am late to the news, but so far reported on healthcare law implementation:</p>
<p>1. www.HealthCare.gov, a new online portal where anyone can go to find insurance options in their state, went live. It&#8217;s a very handy resource for information that used to be difficult to find. It&#8217;s available to help millions who need insurance find it, and as a resource for those who want to shop around for new options or find out their new benefits under the new law.</p>
<p>2. States are starting to create new insurance pools for hundreds of thousands of people with serious medical conditions who had previously been unable to get insurance. Federal grants to help with setup are on their way to states right now.</p>
<p>3. In June, 80,000 checks were mailed to seniors to help with prescription drug costs not covered by Medicare. </p>
<p>And of course, many of the key insurance reforms—allowing young adults to stay on their parents&#8217; insurance until age 26, and making it illegal to deny a child or baby insurance because of a &#8220;pre-existing condition&#8221;—have already started to take effect.</p>
<p>Now, many of the major reforms—the new health insurance exchanges, an end to pre-existing condition discrimination for adults, and more—have yet to go into effect.</p>

<p>NURSING HOME REGULATORY FIASCO – PART I</p>
<p>Nursing homes are subject to a two part interactive regulatory system (plus several others) used to calculate certain reimbursement levels.</p>
<p>The Minimum Data Set 2.0 (MDS) is a clinical reporting system that is supposed to improve care by having nurses do more paperwork (more on this in Part II).</p>
<p>Resource Utilization Groups III categorizes residents into 44 acuity groups. The two systems interact to calculate facility acuity levels (very oversimplified explanation).</p>
<p>On October 1, 2010 MDS 3.0 and RUGs IV are supposed to be put into place. Problem is, MDS 3.0 is ready for roll out, but RUGs IV is not. If no solution is found soon, the feds will have to rig some sort of half-assed patch to keep the system working. RUGs IV should be done in another year.</p>
<p>The feds now face writing tens of thousands of pages of regulations to implement Obamacare, yet cannot finish work started with several years of lead time. Ugly, very ugly.<br />_____________________________________________________</p>
<p>Rdan: The major question is:  Does Rusty still have any hair left?</p>

<p><strong>HEALTH CARE:</strong> Mrs. Rustbelt is Grouchy</p>
<p>Mrs. Rustbelt (aka the world&#8217;s great nurse) is a paragon of competence, compassion, service and self-sacrifice. When grandma is ill you want Mrs. R to be granny&#8217;s nurse. She routinely gets letters and call from families praising her work, and this is the only thing that makes her lose her composure.</p>
<p>But Mrs. Rustbelt is getting grouchy. Mrs. R is really tired of:</p>
<p>super morbidly obese patients<br />diabetic and overweight patients who ignore their diets <br />diabetic and overweight patients who refuse their meds <br />families who bring junk food to patients with dietary restrictions</p>
<p>She gets upset about nurse aides, who despite training and equipment, get inevitable back injuries. And don&#8217;t get her starting on smoking. </p>
<p>Apparently inserting a catheter into a female patient who is 5&#8242; 2&#8243; and 265 pounds is not a whole lot of fun.</p>
<p>If Americans want good health Americans have to start taking some responsibility.</p>
<p>The triple stacker bacon burger is not good  for you, get it?</p>
<p>(My lipid panel numbers are good, one advantage of being married to a nurse.)</p>
