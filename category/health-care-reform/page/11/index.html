<p>Max Baucus of Montana (pop 935,670- 89.2% white)<br />Kent Conrad of North Dakota (pop 636,677- 90.1% white)<br />Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico (pop 1,928,384- 42.8% white)<br />Michael B. Enzi of Wyoming (pop 509,294- 88.8% white)<br />Charles E. Grassley of Iowa (pop 2,966,334- 91.5% white)<br />Olympia Snowe of Maine (pop 1,321,505 &#8211; 96% white).</p>
<p>Most people following the Health Care debate are aware that progress is now under the effective control of six senators who in aggregate are clearly center-right, and from small mostly rural states as seen here (table lifted from Nathan Newman at TPM Cafe). And most of us are equally aware that the party split of what is being called the Baucus Committee is 3 Dem to 3 Repub while the overall makeup of the Senate would suggest a ratio of 3 to 2. All of which has implications of their own, it is a funny kind of democracy that freezes out the representatives of the vast majority of Americans and the whole political spectrum from the center leftward (though I don&#8217;t know a lot about Bingaman, I hardly think he is a Russ Feingold type, please comment.)</p>
<p>So please lets talk about all of this. I just want to throw in one last morsel. Last week it was widely reported that <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&#038;sid=aIRuMx8McFXI">Republican Hatch Leaves Bipartisan Health-Care Talks</a>, which as a supporter of health care reform with a public option I regarded at least as a small positive sign that the balance might have swung a little. But given what we are being told now about the makeup of the Baucus Committee this seems to mean that the original &#8216;Bi-Partisan Committee&#8217; was made up of FOUR REPUBLICANS and three democrats, and those latter three including a chairman hostile to progressive solutions and the author of the Social Security/Medicare gutting Conrad-Gregg legislation. What the hell is up with that?</p>
<p>I understand that it is hard to avoid people taking a least a little bow towards the Pete G. Peterson crowd, but given a 60-40 split turning over negotiations to a group split on paper 4-3 the other way, and given ideological predilections even farther than that is to turn the term &#8216;bi-partisan&#8217; from an inside joke to an outright laugh riot.</p>
<p>Am I missing something here? Was it somehow not a Republican majority Gang of Seven that appointed itself to be the mediators on this issue? And if so why is Harry Reid even listening? What kind of a Majority Leader just abdicates leadership to the other side on what might be the defining piece of legislation of the decade?</p>

<p>A reader commented that market share statistics do not reflect whether competition occurs in a health insurance market. To stress a point he stated competition occurs when companies >1, and many states have competition of >2 major players, which makes for a more competitive market than a monopoly allows.</p>
<p>Competition to me means that at the least there is/are &#8216;forces&#8217; in the market that somehow impact prices and quality of product or service, and in common usage implies lowering prices overall with some attention to quality. Many of us have cars in mind as a mental picture, and electronics.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://hcfan.3cdn.net/1b741c44183247e6ac_20m6i6nzc.pdf">Health Care for America Now</a> has put together information compiled by the American Medical Association on market share enjoyed by insurers by state, and on the DOJ interest in the increasing concentration of ownership, again using AMA figures going from 33% highly concentrated in year 2000 to 51% in year 2007 as median % of market share nationally (Blue Cross/Blue Shield mainly). The trend for increasing consolidation within each state is clear.</p>
<p>The Department of Justice disagrees that anything less than a monopoly makes for effective competition in the health insurance market, as does economic theory in the form of an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herfindahl_index">Herfindahl index</a>. In fact, <a href="http://www.unclaw.com/chin/teaching/antitrust/herfindahl.htm">since 1982</a> anti trust law has used this measure along with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_ratio">concentration ratio</a> of an industry as an indicator of the relative size of firms in relation to the industry as a whole in evaluating &#8216;competition&#8217;.</p>
<p>DOJ states that in the state-based system of health insurance currently practiced:<br />
<blockquote>If one company holds more than a 42 percent share of a market the U.S. Justice Department would consider that market “highly concentrated.” This means that an insurer, with impunity, could raise premiums and/or reduce the variety of plans or quality of services offered to customers.7</p>

<p>Without necessarily getting into health insurance competition only, since the competition meme is invoked often in many places, what are market rules that demonstrate whether competition is working or not? </p>
<p>Several thoughts occur, to fit the meme:</p>
<p>1.  Competition is defined as the way to lower prices and better product by many. Does this occur naturally, freely, when two companies share 75% of a market? Or if one company has 50% market share, with more players (as in MA)?</p>
<p>2.  When prices double for a product in 8 years, how is competition working to control costs?  How is this claim for competition proved? </p>
<p>I have in mind a different post on market share for health insurance companies, and the nature of health care for another. This could be a post to come to terms with readers notions of competition.</p>

                                <p>by divorced one like Bush</p>
<p>Responding to a couple of comments to my <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/07/massachusetts-is-fixing-fixed-health.html">post yesterday</a>, I want to present some history.  PARCA.  Patient Access to Responsible Care Act.  1997 by Alfonse D&#8217;Amato (R-N.Y.) and <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/hmo/etc/outlook.html">Rep. Charlie Norwood,</a> a Georgia Republican and licensed dentist who argues: &#8220;If we can protect trees and animals, why can&#8217;t we protect patients?&#8221;  (Well there is a long extinct animal!)</p>
<p>PARCA had <a href="http://www.reason.com/news/show/30524.html">this in it</a>: PARCA states, &#8220;<strong>No insurance issuer may discriminate&#8230;in any activity that has the effect of discriminating against an individual on the basis of </strong>race, national origin, gender, language, socioeconomic status, age, <strong>disability, health status or anticipated need for health services</strong>.&#8221;</p>
<p>The bill was defeated.  The bill was part of a response by consumers and providers to what managed care was doing in the late 90&#8217;s.  People were not happy at all.</p>
<p>From the <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/hmo/etc/outlook.html">Frontline article</a>:<br />
<blockquote>According to a recent survey by Robert Blendon at the Harvard School of Public Health, some 48% of Americans say they personally have experienced problems with HMOs&#8217; care, or have close friends or relatives who have run into such difficulties. Complaints include difficulty getting access to medical specialists, problems with emergency care, and excessive red tape when trying to file grievances or appeals.</p></blockquote>
<p>From: A report from <a href="http://www.familiesusa.org/resources/publications/reports/premium-pay-corporate-compensation-in-americas-hmos.html">Families USA</a>, April 1998: <br />
<blockquote>&#8230;almost three out of five Americans say that managed care plans make it harder for sick people to see medical specialists. Over half say managed care has decreased the quality of care for people who are sick. More than three out of five say managed care has reduced the amount of time doctors spend with patients. And 55 percent say they are at least &#8220;somewhat worried&#8221; that if they are sick their &#8220;health plan would be more concerned about saving money than about what is the best medical treatment.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Yet, with nothing really changed other than consolidation of the health insurance industry, we hear arguments that people are happy?  Bull!  Come on people, don&#8217;t you remember?</p>
<p>From Duke University, <a href="http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_health_politics_policy_and_law/v024/24.5rodwin.html">Marc A. Rodwin</a>: Backlash as Prelude to Managing Managed Care, is this summary of the then accepted pro managed care thoughts:<br />
<blockquote>Managed care organizations (MCOs) and the private sector, so the story goes, are not perfect, but the alternative&#8211;having legislatures manage health resources and bureaucracies make health care decisions&#8211;is even worse. Experts in the private sector should manage health care&#8230; Over the long run, however, the market will ensure that MCOs deliver high quality health care. Consumers will leave poorly performing MCOs for ones that respond to their concerns (Enthoven 1993). </p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://jada.ada.org/cgi/reprint/129/4/402.pdf">A summary</a> of the potential defeat of PARCA presents the arguments against it as this:<br />
<blockquote>Insurers and employers also are lining up to defeat the bill, claiming that its provisions could drive up the cost of insurance by 23 percent to 39 percent. The naysayers argue that if this bill became law, it would cause “thousands” of employers to stop offering insurance. They also maintain that the higher cost of premiums will force millions of lower-income workers to drop their insurance&#8230;  The insurance companies are obviously concerned <strong>because PARCA will hold them liable</strong>.</p></blockquote>
<p>Same story today.  Government bad, regulation not needed, don&#8217;t worry the market will fix it.  Mr. Rodwin&#8217;s closing statement:<br />
<blockquote>Backlash is unlikely to disappear until the industry matures and thoughtful regulatory authority protects the public, and the industry from itself. </p></blockquote>
<p>Prophetic?</p>
<p>We even were concerned in 1998 about CEO compensation for the insurers.  From the <a href="http://www.familiesusa.org/resources/publications/reports/premium-pay-corporate-compensation-in-americas-hmos.html">Families USA</a> 1998 report:<br />
<blockquote>In keeping with the industry&#8217;s accentuated focus on costs, this report analyzes a very different facet of managed care costs&#8211;namely, the costs associated with compensation for high-level HMO executives. The report examines 1996 executive compensation for the 20 for-profit, publicly traded companies that owned HMOs with enrollments over 100,000.7 These 20 companies owned 64 of the nation&#8217;s largest HMOs in 1996.<br />The 25 highest paid executives in the 20 companies studied made $153.8 million in annual compensation, excluding unexercised stock options, in 1996. The average compensation for these 25 executives was over $6.2 million per executive. The median compensation for these 25 executives was over $4.8 million.  <br />The 25 executives with the largest unexercised stock option packages in 1996 had stock options valued at$337.4 million. The average value of unexercised stock options for these 25 executives was $13.5 million. The median unexercised stock option package for these executives was over $7.2 million.<br />(<a href="http://www.measuringworth.com/uscompare/">Go here</a> to see what it&#8217;s worth today.)</p></blockquote>
<p>In fact, we are so having the same debate again, yet, still that, <a href="http://www.buckheissmann.at/us/pubs/Insider/printable.asp?ArticleID=7232&#038;Component=The+Insider&#038;page=1">I found this</a> regarding the 1998 congressional timing for the health care issue:<br />
<blockquote>All sides in the Senate debate have used the August recess to push their managed care proposals&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>We are soooooooo doing it again that we are right down to the same time of the year! AHHHHHHHHHHHH!</p>
<p>Which brings me to Save the Rustbelt&#8217;s comment <em>&#8220;&#8230;but it is not some conspiracy to drive up administrative costs.&#8221; </em> My point was not that there is a conspiracy regarding administrative costs, certainly not by Massachusetts.  It is that in order to fix what was fixed they are reaching for more of the same reasoning: Control the cost via administration of the costs.  It is the very reasoning that has allowed the insurance industry (just look at the sub corps that UHC owns) to develop an entirely new business that is only expending but is not delivering the product results as advertised as it <a href="http://www.pnhp.org/publications/nejmadmin.pdf">adds costs</a>.  And now, we will shift the cost by shifting the administrative model to the providers via a model that is questionable.  </p>
<p>This Massachusetts model of capitation via &#8220;accountable care organizations&#8221; (ACO) is really just a new twist on the staff model HMO.  Only now the insurer will collect the money and just pass it on according to the state fee schedule (yes it is still a fee schedule whether fee for service or fee for head count), and keep the difference.  If there is not state setting of premiums, then where is the cost savings to the purchaser of insurance.   If there is state setting of premiums, then why go through all this when we could just have a single payer system and cut out the profit and reduce the duplication of claims management to obtain our savings?</p>
<p>Also, to make this work, a patient will have to remain with the same &#8220;accountable care organization&#8221; at least through to the conclusion of their health problem. Being that the new fix is just a rehash of some old models, it is reasonable to assume that there will be some limiting of the consumer of health insurance to change ACO&#8217;s.  Bet it will be like the Medicare drug program; one year, which I believe is already part of the Massachusetts insurance program.  I doubt that locking a consumer into a program for 1 year is long enough for an ACO to have affected a change in the consumption of health care services by the consumer.  In fact, you will not know unless that consumer gets sick in such a way that there are lifetime residuals and then starts ACO shopping.  Will the consumer put up with having to be locked into the ACO for more than a year?  Consider that health care outcomes are looked at over 3 and 5 year periods to determine success.  Can you say &#8220;administration of cost&#8221;?  How will the consumer know which ACO is actually getting the product of health and healing correct for the least price without more administration?  How will the consumer come to appreciate value before actually having to purchase?</p>
<p>Which leads me to Vtcodger&#8217;s comment: <em>&#8220;About the best I can say for this idea is that it is new.&#8221; </em> I hope I am making clear that this is not new.  Nothing about the current discussion of the health care problem is new.  It is just the game of hot potato.  It is just a shifting of the costs down the line. (An approach we seem to have been using since &#8220;trickle down&#8221; theory was created.)  I do agree and it is why I believe capitation did not catch on and staff model HMO&#8217;s declined, when Vtcodger states: <em>&#8221; I don&#8217;t think that your average primary care physician wants to be an insurer&#8230;&#8221;.   </em></p>
<p>But, let me correct one assumption that like the myth of Reagan lives on regarding managed care.  Again Vtcodge: <em>Actually, HMO/PPOs etc did and do seem to work to some extent.  When they were first introduced, increases in health care costs did moderate for a while. </em></p>
<p>Yes, cost did seem to moderate.  But there were very specific reasons and it had little to do with manage care actually reducing the &#8220;unneeded tests and procedures&#8221;.  From the <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/hmo/etc/outlook.html">Frontline article</a>:<br />
<blockquote>In the mid-1990s, HMOs made some people think that they had vanquished medical inflation &#8212; as rates to big employers increased just 0.5% to 2% a year. But the managed care plans &#8220;paid dearly for competitive pricing in 1997,&#8221; says John Erb, a benefits consultant at William M. Mercer Inc. &#8220;Many lost money and margins were slim for most of the rest. </p></blockquote>
<p>It was the old business model to market share, cut your pricing and hope your competition folds first.  It&#8217;s the big box store model.  It worked.  In RI land we were reduced to BC and UHC.  Two years ago, UHC undercut BC to win the state contract.  Prices are up.</p>
<p>There was a report put out by Muse &#038; Associates for the pro PARCA coalition.  In it they noted two other reports when making a conclusion about costs.  Quoting from an article from my national association&#8217;s journal 4/98 (I have no link):<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;Private sector average premium costs, for HMOs, the most tightly controlled form of managed care, are 18.4 percent lower than traditional indemnity plans.  <br /> Other researchers have come up with estimates reassuringly similar to the Towers Perrin figure.  For example, the Lewin Group, in a 1997 report, estimated direct savings from managed care at 19 percent.<br /> So, Muse &#038; Associates are on sound footing in concluding: &#8220;Clearly, overall managed care savings could not exceed 20 percent.  The best evidence strongly suggests that 15 percent of the 20 percent savings comes from managed care organizations reducing provider prices&#8230;&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>We&#8217;re talking the same old approach to what really is a problem with the product.  At least in the bad socialist health care programs they recognize that a for profit third party only adds cost and thus do not have to account for that part of our problem (it&#8217;s called savings).  They just need to resolve the product quality issue.  It is the only common issue to all nations.  </p>
<p>I&#8217;m taking bets on the date of the new fix of the newly fixed, fixed system. </p>

<p>In this debate on how to finance health care, we are hearing about the costs to deliver health care and how to bring them down.   <a href="http://www.boston.com/yourtown/wellesley/articles/2009/07/17/pay_for_care_a_new_way_state_is_urged/">Mass is now proposing</a> a capitated payment system that will be government created.  It is the latest fix to a herald &#8220;fixed&#8221; problem.  Which begs the question, why do they need to fix it again, yet, still?</p>
<blockquote><p>The 10-member commission&#8230; voted unanimously to largely scrap the current system, in which insurers typically pay doctors and hospitals a negotiated fee for each individual procedure or visit. That arrangement is widely seen as leading to unneeded tests and procedures.<br />A state commission recommended yesterday that Massachusetts dramatically change how doctors and hospitals are paid&#8230;the group wants private insurers and the state and federal Medicaid program to pay providers a set payment for each patient that covers all that person’s care for an entire year and to make the radical shift within five years. Providers would have to work within a predetermined budget, forcing them to better coordinate patients’ care, which could improve quality and reduce costs.<br />The plan would require significant restructuring of the healthcare system, and some of its components would need legislative approval. Primary-care doctors, specialists, hospitals, and home healthcare agencies would have to form so-called accountable care organizations. Patients would choose a primary care doctor to coordinate their care, mostly within the organization. Insurers would pay the accountable care organization a flat yearly per-patient fee to be divided among the providers.</p></blockquote>
<p>Read the above again: <em>recommended&#8230;that Massachusetts dramatically change&#8230; to make the radical shift&#8230; The plan would require significant restructuring of the healthcare system, and some of its components would need legislative approval&#8230; to form so-called accountable care organizations.</em> </p>
<p><a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/06/deja-vu-health-care-reform-hillary-care.html">Deja vu? </a> </p>
<p>Dramatically?  Radical?  Significant?  Legislative approval?  An entirely new thingy called &#8220;accountable care organizations?  What?  IPA, HMO, PPO, POS, EPO, Self Directed, HSA, Capitated, IME, Primary Care, Fee-for-service, PCP, CAM, and for Massachusetts specifically; <a href="http://www.mahealthconnector.org/portal/site/connector/">Commonwealth Connector</a> just didn&#8217;t do it for you.  We need more?  &#8220;Doctor&#8221;, &#8220;insurer&#8221;, &#8220;patient&#8221;, &#8220;government&#8221; were not enough?    </p>
<p>I want to know,  just how much in administration cost will this new fix add?  Is this the old promise of managed care, that the savings will accumulate enough to pay for the cost of administration plus a profit?  Hasn&#8217;t worked yet.   </p>
<p>It may work I guess, if we just add enough superlatives in our sentences while we present the new and improved Model T.  Or maybe not.  From the journal, Medical Care:<a href="http://journals.lww.com/lww-medicalcare/Abstract/2003/02000/Managed_Health_Plan_Effects_on_the_Specialty.6.aspx"> Managed Health Plan Effects </a>on the Specialty Referral Process: <br />
<blockquote>Results. <strong>The percentages of office visits resulting in a referral were </strong>similar between the two gatekeeping groups and <strong>higher than the no gatekeeping group</strong>. Patients in plans with capitated PCP payment were more likely to be referred for discretionary indications than those in nongatekeeping plans (15.5% v 9.9%, P The frequency of referring physician coordination activities did not vary by health plan type. The proportion of patients in gatekeeping health plans within a practice was directly related to employing staff as referral coordinators, allowing nurses to refer without physician consultation, and permitting patients to request referrals by leaving recorded telephone messages.</p></blockquote>
<p>Massachusetts states: <em>That arrangement is widely seen as leading to unneeded tests and procedures.</em>  They were referring to the method of paying a doctor. Yet the study shows that the referral patterns don&#8217;t change with changing the method of payment.  Well, does Massachusetts think the unneeded tests and procedures are happening without referrals?</p>
<p>Pick the approach, it didn&#8217;t change the referral pattern and, systems were set up by those being managed to make the referral process more efficient.  So, either the patients need the referral  (thus tests and procedures) and none of these money managing approaches are going to ultimately stop it, or the PCP finds a way to keep the traffic moving through the office because the more patients served the more money collected.  (Deja vu)  It&#8217;s a solution to a head-count/ piece-work payment system that still does not get the doc to do the job of applying the knowledge of health and healing to a given person&#8217;s presentation.  (I&#8217;m accepting bets on how long it will be before we hear about the next fixing of the latest fixed Mass health care system.  Post your bet in comments.)</p>
<p>This gets us to the one area that has been rolled out many times, but is often excused off as not being reliable as to achieving real savings and thus why we really don&#8217;t want a government funded single payer solution (other than our pride of not thinking of it first):  Administration costs.  It is the old medicare is cheaper than private insurance because of administration cost argument.  </p>
<p>We&#8217;re hearing of the new plan being modeled on the Massachusetts system.  It&#8217;s not working as noted by the need to fix it again (though past experience with other states showed it would not work).  The fix is more administration costs on top of more administration costs.  If they keep going this way, soon a medicare modeled administration system&#8217;s costs will be comparable to the private insurer, thus defeating the need to fix health care. So lets just accept that health care costs a lot to administrate, stop wasting time trying to reduce the cost and let the private system stay?</p>
<p>NOT!</p>
<p>From this article: <a href="http://www.pnhp.org/publications/nejmadmin.pdf">Costs of Health Care Administration </a>in the United States and Canada, NEJM 2003, we learn that administrative costs have been rising faster in the US than in Canada. <br />
<blockquote>We investigated whether the ascendancy of computerization, managed care, and the adoption of more businesslike approaches to health care have decreased administrative costs.</p>
<p>For the United States and Canada, we calculated the administrative costs of health insurers, employers’ health benefit programs, hospitals, practitioners’ offices, nursing homes, and home care agencies in 1999. </p>
<p>In 1999, health administration costs totaled at least $294.3 billion in the United States, or $1,059 per capita, as compared with $307 per capita in Canada. After exclusions, administration accounted for 31.0 percent of health care expenditures in the United States and 16.7 percent of health care expenditures in Canada. Canada’s national health insurance program had overhead of 1.3 percent; the overhead among Canada’s private insurers was higher than that in the United States (13.2 percent vs. 11.7 percent). Providers’ administrative costs were far lower in Canada.</p>
<p>Between 1969 and 1999, the share of the U.S. health care labor force accounted for by administrative workers grew from 18.2 percent to 27.3 percent. In Canada, it grew from 16.0 percent in 1971 to 19.1 percent in 1996. (Both nations’ figures exclude insurance-industry personnel.)</p></blockquote>
<p> You know, I think maybe administration has become a growth industry for the health insurance industry?  Was this part of the plan to shift us to a service economy? <a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_ea3-LcbrX8A/SmYcnPZeVMI/AAAAAAAAANw/5u0eJeg-x-s/s1600-h/Health+Care+Admin+cost+chart.JPG"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_ea3-LcbrX8A/SmYcnPZeVMI/AAAAAAAAANw/5u0eJeg-x-s/s400/Health+Care+Admin+cost+chart.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a> <a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_ea3-LcbrX8A/SmYcbWTSVjI/AAAAAAAAANo/ueYsLMAamVM/s1600-h/Admin+%26+Clerical+Personnel+Labor+Force+chart.JPG"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_ea3-LcbrX8A/SmYcbWTSVjI/AAAAAAAAANo/ueYsLMAamVM/s400/Admin+%26+Clerical+Personnel+Labor+Force+chart.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a> <a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_ea3-LcbrX8A/SmYcMpFFyBI/AAAAAAAAANg/L61tTSaJfB0/s1600-h/Enrollee+vs+Employees+of+Ins+vs+Canada.JPG"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_ea3-LcbrX8A/SmYcMpFFyBI/AAAAAAAAANg/L61tTSaJfB0/s400/Enrollee+vs+Employees+of+Ins+vs+Canada.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a><br />Understand what the authors are saying here.  It&#8217;s not just administrative costs related to the job of getting the patient&#8217;s dollar to the provider (medicare vs private), it&#8217;s the overall costs to the entire health care system as a results of the &#8220;administrative&#8221; systems the private insurance industry has put in place to &#8220;save us money&#8221;.  No one is immune from paying these costs.  They are part of the premiums charged, fees withheld, claims refiled, etc.  All this administrative labor to control the costs, and yet the cost of health care keeps rising.  Well, if the insurance employees can&#8217;t stop the rising costs, then what are we paying them for?</p>
<p>This is starting to make me think that Bruce Webb&#8217;s &#8220;do nothing plan&#8221; for Social Security should be applied to fixing health care.   In this case the &#8220;do nothing&#8221; plan would be to get rid of the paper chase and achieve real savings.  That is, do nothing regarding active management of health care costs via administrative systems.  Don&#8217;t try to manage the doc&#8217;s, just let them do what they do and save money by eliminating all the systems that try to manage them.  Though, there is a way to manage the doc&#8217;s that would not cost us in administration: competition among provider types.  Let the various algorithms of applying the knowledge of health and healing compete.  Thus, <a href="http://www.jmptonline.org/article/S0161-4754(07)00076-0/abstract">research such as this</a> needs to be considered regardless of one&#8217;s opinion of the group studied.<br />
<blockquote>Clinical and cost utilization based on 70274 member-months over a 7-year period demonstrated decreases of 60.2% in-hospital admissions, 59.0% hospital days, 62.0% outpatient surgeries and procedures, and 85% pharmaceutical costs when compared with conventional medicine IPA performance for the same health maintenance organization product in the same geography and time frame.</p></blockquote>
<p> How about that, a reduction in &#8220;<em>unneeded test and procedures</em>&#8221; without adding administration costs.  Let the doc&#8217;s be but, use the clinical practice approach that actually cuts the &#8220;unneeded&#8221; because it is unneeded.  I think there is a lesson here?  Something along the lines of free market capitalism only the market is not the types of insurance competing for the patient, it&#8217;s the types of doctors that need to compete for the patient.</p>
<p>I got side tracked.  Lets stay with the one area for cost reductions: Administration.  The authors:<br />
<blockquote>Conclusions<br />The gap between U.S. and Canadian spending on health care administration has grown to $752 per capita. A large sum might be saved in the United States if administrative costs could be trimmed by implementing a Canadian-style health care system.</p>
<p>Despite these imprecisions, the difference in the costs of health care administration between the United States and Canada is clearly large and growing. <strong>Is $294.3 billion annually for U.S. health care administration money well spent</strong>?</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, is it?  Did they even ask?</p>

                                <p>OR; HR3200 Sec 102 revisited. by Bruce Webb</p>
<p>We first visited the health care reform meme sweeping the right wing of the Blogosphere  with this post <a target="_blank" href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/07/wingnut-102-how-hr3200-outlaws-private.html">HR3200 abolishes private health insurance</a>. This seemed at first to be a simple confusion of the limits of the following from Sec 102 of the legislation:<br />
<blockquote>1) LIMITATION ON NEW ENROLLMENT.— <br />(A) IN GENERAL.—Except as provided in this paragraph, the individual health insurance issuer offering such coverage does not enroll any individual in such coverage if the first effective date of coverage is on or after the first day of Y1.</p></blockquote>
<p>I pointed out that Sec 102 only refers to &#8216;Grandfathered&#8217; plans and not to &#8216;Qualified&#8217; plans eligible to be included in the new Exchanges. But regular commenter Movie Guy showed that the confusion might be on my part and the result of inadequate attention to Sec 123-144. As he put it in comments:<br />
<blockquote>Section 102 can&#8217;t be viewed in isolation.  Moreover, Section 102 can&#8217;t simply be compared to Section 101 as the magic answer.  There is far more involved than Webb&#8217;s explanations and opinions expressed in the comment posts on the open thread and this main post and related comments.  Aside from reading the entire bill, one would need to read some provisions in existing U.S. Code as cited by the bill.  This provides the broader picture.     </p>
<p>The problem with Section 102 is the clock.     </p>
<p>If this provision of the bill is also adopted by the U.S. Senate and a conference bill is passed and subsequently signed by the President, there will be a gap period that isn&#8217;t being addressed.  The cutoff dates are specific.  Yet, the Administration will not have a &#8220;Commissioner&#8221; until the individual is nominated and confirmed by the U.S. Senate.  The &#8220;Health Benefits Advisory Committee&#8221; will not be in place until the members are selected; the Committee has 18 months to make its initial recommendations.  Moreover, the Committee will be advising the Secretary of Health and Human Services.  And you can&#8217;t call the &#8220;Health Insurance Ombudsman&#8221; until the &#8220;Commissioner&#8221; appoints one.   Recommend reading some of the other sections, including Sections 123-144.     </p>
<p>During the interim period, who will be approving the plans acceptable for the &#8220;Health Insurance Exchange&#8221; under subtitle A of title II?  Based on what criteria?  Those are responsibilities identified for the &#8220;Commissioner&#8221;.     </p>
<p>If you lose your job on or after day 1 of the enacted legislation and your company insurance is terminated, what will you do until such time as the &#8220;Commissioner&#8221;, &#8220;Health Insurance Exchange&#8221;, Commissioner identified criteria, and accepted list of insurance providers are identified?  Who will be able to get new health insurance until that system is up and running?  Not Cobra.  That won&#8217;t be allowed.     </p>
<p>If you&#8217;re starting a business and need health insurance for yourself and a few employees during the gap period, what are your options for health insurance?     </p>
<p>That&#8217;s why Section 102 is insane. </p></blockquote>
<p> Well after wading through a lot of the text of the Bill I came to the conclusion that much of the problem was terminological. Bur rather than waste the research that got me to that point I will include it after the fold. If nothing else it clarifies the proposed timeline.<br />(UPDATE: in comments on the previous post MG has conceded that if my reading below is correct that his concerns have been largely addressed. But given that there are others out there with this same take, I am going to leave this post up as is.)</p>
<p>First from the Bill text:</p>
<p>p.32 DEADLINE.—The Health Benefits Advisory Committee shall recommend initial benefit standards to the Secretary not later than 1 year after the date of the enactment of this Act.  </p>
<p>p.35 (1) REVIEW OF RECOMMENDED STANDARDS.—  <br />Not later than 45 days after the date of receipt of benefit standards recommended under section 123 (including such standards as modified under paragraph (2)(B)), the Secretary shall review such standards and shall determine whether to propose  adoption of such standards as a package.   </p>
<p>p.36 (b) ADOPTION OF STANDARDS.—  (1) INITIAL STANDARDS.—Not later than 18 months after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall, through the rulemaking process consistent with subsection (a), adopt an initial set of benefit standards.   </p>
<p>p. 72 (a) ESTABLISHMENT.—There is established within the Health Choices Administration and under the direction of the Commissioner a Health Insurance Exchange in order to facilitate access of individuals and employers, through a transparent process, to a variety of choices of affordable, quality health insurance coverage, including a public health insurance option.  </p>
<p>p. 88-89 2) SOLICITING AND NEGOTIATING BIDS; CONTRACTS.—The Commissioner shall—  (A) solicit bids from QHBP offering entities for the offering of Exchange-participating health benefits plans;  (B) based upon a review of such bids, negotiate with such entities for the offering of such plans; and  (C) enter into contracts with such entities for the offering of such plans through the Health Insurance Exchange under terms (consistent with this title) negotiated between the Commissioner and such entities .</p>
<p>At risk of spoiling the punchline it is necessary to maintain a clear distinction between &#8220;date of the enactment of the Act&#8221; and day one of &#8220;Y 1&#8221;. Which latter is defined as follows:<br />(25) Y1, Y2, ETC..—The terms ‘‘Y1’’ , ‘‘Y2’’, ‘‘Y3’’, ‘‘Y4’’, ‘‘Y5’’, and similar subsequently numbered terms, mean 2013 and subsequent years, respectively.</p>
<p>Before returning to the point lets examine the implementation timeline (from comments)<br />
<blockquote>First unless the Blue Dogs get their way the current plan by the President and House Leadership is to get this bill enacted this year. So lets take the effective date as Jan. 1, 2010.  </p>
<p>Second the clock for the Health Benefits Advisory Committee is not 18 months it is one year and the clock starts not when the members are appointed but at the date of enacting of the bill. Meaning that standards will be in place by Jan 1, 2011.  </p>
<p>Third this gives the Senate a full year to confirm the Commissioner. Nor do I see that the appointment of the Ombudsman makes much difference here, his role seems relatively minor for implementation.  </p>
<p>Fourth, the Commissioner is limited to 45 days to review the standards once received and must have them through the Rule process within 18 months of enactment. Meaning that adopted standards would be in place no later than June 30, 2011.  </p>
<p>Fifth the general outlines of the standards are well established in the bill itself, and if the Advisory Committee develops its specific recommendations in a publicly accessible form (and note that insurance companies have representation on the Committee) insurance companies have almost two years to prepare themselves for contract negotiations in the summer of 2011.  </p>
<p>Sixth which gives the Commissioner and the companies another 18 months for contract approval and administrative implementation. </p></blockquote>
<p>So to repeat the question:<br />
<blockquote>If you lose your job on or after day 1 of the enacted legislation and your company insurance is terminated, what will you do until such time as the &#8220;Commissioner&#8221;, &#8220;Health Insurance Exchange&#8221;, Commissioner identified criteria, and accepted list of insurance providers are identified? Who will be able to get new health insurance until that system is up and running? </p></blockquote>
<p> Well on my reading if you lose your job and so your insurance between &#8220;day 1 of the enacted legislation&#8221; and &#8220;day 1 of Y 1&#8221; you can get insurance just where  you always would have if you lost your job between tomorrow and the date of enactment. As a matter of personal convenience you might ask if the company plans to participate in the Exchange after it goes into operation Jan 1. 2013 but I just am not seeing the inherent insanity some others do. Instead I see two fundamental mistakes. One the belief that the clocks start from the point that the Commissioner and Committee members are confirmed rather than the date the act is enacted. And the second a confusion between that date and Y 1 as referenced in Sec 102, i.e. 2013..</p>

                                <p>by Bruce Webb</p>
<p>Did you know that the House Tri-Committee Bill HR3200 openly and brazenly outlaws new private individual health insurance plans after Year 1 (now set for 2013)? Well me neither, mainly because it is only not true but in total context absurd. Not quite as absurd as the idea that the Moon landings were faked, that walking into a court with a gold fringed flag means you have lost all protections under the Constitution, that you can make yourself exempt from Federal Income tax by declaration, or any of the other engrained notions floating around Wingnuttia. But since somehow Flat Earthers, and Young Earthers and Birthers never go away it is worth examining this particular theory before it goes even more viral, I have already seen it on multiple sites.</p>
<p>What is the origin of this? Well it is from some seemingly clear language in the text of the bill, the entirety of which can be found here: <a target="_blank" href="http://edlabor.house.gov/documents/111/pdf/publications/AAHCA-BillText-071409.pdf">HR3200: America&#8217;s Affordable Health Choices Act</a>. This language is not hidden deep within the bill, which is what you would expect if something sneaky was going on (which should have given these guys pause for thought), nope it is right up front on page 16 of the bill, indeed it is in the second section of the bill&#8217;s Title 1, that is  &#8216;SEC. 102. PROTECTING THE CHOICE TO KEEP CURRENT COVERAGE&#8217;  The language itself:<br />
<blockquote>(1) LIMITATION ON NEW ENROLLMENT.— <br />(A) IN GENERAL.—Except as provided in this paragraph, the individual health insurance issuer offering such coverage does not enroll any individual in such coverage if the first effective date of coverage is on or after the first day of Y1.</p></blockquote>
<p> Which for some is the &#8220;insane&#8221; smoking gun, no new individual insurance after 2013. To understand why this is just a profound misreading of the bill (if you don&#8217;t already) you can follow me below the fold as I try to explain.</p>
<p>First thing to need to understand that Congressional language is a little tortured to start with. For one thing it is nested, that is you have to work your way up from the language of any given paragraph to the higher level organization and purpose. Second as here you always have to look out for language indicating exceptions.</p>
<p>The top level of this section is titled &#8216;Protecting the Choice to Keep Current Coverage&#8217; in keeping with Obama&#8217;s promise that if you like what you have you get to keep it. But this right is not totally unlimited, there are constraints that both keep employers from gaming the insurance pool and individual employees from evading the individual mandate by buying inadequate (but cheap) coverage. So the legislation sets out some terms and parameters. Right after the title we get sub-section (a) itself titled &#8216;Grandfathered Health Insurance Coverage Defined&#8217;. (Those of you not aware of the term &#8216;grandfathering&#8217; is the principle that a property right once exercised can not arbitrarily taken away and in some cases is inheritable). Sub-section (a) lays out three limitations (1) Limitation on New Enrollment, (2) Limitation on Change in Terms or Conditions, (3) Restrictions on Premium Increases all of which taken together has led our conspiracy bugs to believe they are hiding a plan to strangle the individual insurance market out in favor of a public plan (which then I guess is free to destroy Tokyo unchecked.)</p>
<p>To understand why this is not so, or at least not so in the sense opponents would like to take it you need to back up and see what Sec 102 was opposing Grandfathered coverage AGAINST. Meaning that to fully understand Sec 102 you need to understand Sec 101 and in particular the meaning of &#8216;Qualified Health Benefit Plan&#8217; as set out in Sec 101 (b). In order to offer new coverage under HR3200 private insurers simply need to offer a product that meets the new requirements. This is no different than requirements in past legislation that car manufacturers had to include such things as turn-signals, back up lights, seat belts in new model years, but in most cases grandfathered existing cars already on the road.</p>
<p>Backing up a little more. In order for a new plan for individual or group insurance to be offered it has to meet three tests under 101 (b):those of Sub-title B: Affordable Coverage, Sub-title C: Essential Benefits, and Sub-title D: Consumer Protection. If you meet those tests you are allowed to write new individual policies. Nothing is outlawed except the right to sell inadequate plans to new customers.</p>
<p>Now you don&#8217;t need to dig into the legislative language to see why this wingnut reading of Sec 102 had to be wrong. For example you could have just examined the CBO estimates of who would be covered by whom in the year 2019.<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SlzrP7hBJ1I/AAAAAAAAARU/BSFpq3Ud4fw/s1600-h/House+Health+pg.1.jpg">Insurance Coverage Specifications</a> and associated text. If CBO estimates that in 2019 30 million people will bet getting insurance through the exchange and only 9 million of them covered by the pubilc options, who is left to write the other 21 million mostly individual policies? Private insurance. How can they do that if Sec 102 of the bill plainly makes writing any such coverage after 2013 illegal? Well they couldn&#8217;t. Which should suggests that the &#8216;simple&#8217; reading of Sec. 102 that apparently sets up this paradox was not the correct reading, that in reading it that way that those readers just missed something. Something I suggest was Sec 101, the overall context of the unfolding debate, and CBO scoring.<br />__________________________________<br />While I am here. A good part of the progressive blogosphere is rending their clothes and gnashing their teeth because the current plans limit people with employer supplied insurance from resorting to the pubic plan. This too is a profound mis-understanding of the bill, though here from the other side.</p>
<p>For one thing current enrollees in employer plans are protected by the provisions of Sec 102 (b) which provides that they are not bound by a &#8216;unacceptable&#8217; plans as defined, moreover employers are only given a five year grace period after Y 1 to upgrade their current plan to qualified plan standards. Additionally there are restrictions which keep your employer paid plan from costing the individual employee more than 11% of gross pay and which allow employee opt-out from being stuck in a lower cost plan just to meet that test. In fact I am not seeing in Title II or Title III anything that would keep an employee from choosing individual insurance from the exchange after Year 2 whether that coverage be private or through the public option. Nor am I seeing any &#8216;firewall&#8217; keeping the employer out of the exchange, or in exchange for a fee amounting to 8% of payroll from simply dropping employer coverage at all.</p>
<p>Now it is more than possible that I am missing something here, and any help would be appreciated. But please if you can supply citations to the particular section of the bill containing the actual controlling language. Because while I can see restrictions that keep EMPLOYERS from shoving people against their will onto the public option, I am not seeing much to keep EMPLOYEES from freely choosing that.</p>
<p>Although even if there were such restrictions they would under some circumstances be defensible. What you don&#8217;t want is a situation where the employer sets up what is in effect two plans, one for favored employees and/or low cost insurance needs and another for less-favored employees and/or high cost insurance needs. There are some protections built in by salary, you can&#8217;t openly have two vastly divergent systems, but what you need is some protections against employers covertly and selectively pushing some people out the door. For example I would think it would be profoundly illegal to tie decisions on retention of probationary employees by the type of coverage they &#8216;freely&#8217; chose. But employers know how to pass hints that suggest that people over 50 or who have lots of kids have problems passing probation if they insist on being on the employer plan, hint, hint, nudge, nudge. On my reading the bill attempts as best it can to limit this, but realistically it is hard to remove game playing from any complex system.<br />___________________________<br />On a final note. Those who claim this plan is a blatant, open attempt to drive private insurance out of the market starting on Day 1 are totally off-base. On the other hand there are pretty good possibilities that that will be the effect by say year 20. Because the legislation is wittingly or not set up as a one-way valve, there are incentives in place to let some or all of your employees pass through that valve into the public option, while there is not much incentive to draw them back out. Which is the outcome that some of us dirty socialist DFHs are ultimately hoping for, Universal Single Payer through the back-door.</p>
<p>So people mis-reading Sec. 102 may well have identified the motive and the goal even as they mis-identify the actual mechanism.</p>

                                <p>By: Divorced one like Bush</p>
<p>This is a heads up.  <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,529561,00.html">Fox news</a> has a report out that there is a rise in private insurance activity in Canada.    The article suggests that it is because of all the wait time that people are tired of  do to a shortage of doctors and possibly the low fees.   And, that may be true, especially being there was a Quebec Supreme Court ruling on it.  </p>
<p>If you google the headline, you will find many a posting touting this article as a sort of proof that the Canadian system really is bad stuff.</p>
<p>But, and with Fox there is always a butt, what they do not tell you is that their article is based on a report in the <a href="http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=2582763">CMAJ</a> – JAMC article from 2008: <strong>Canada Health Act breaches are being ignored, pro-medicare groups charge</strong><br />
<blockquote>Private for-profit medical clinics are proliferating across the country, according to a detailed report by pro-medicare groups.<br />The number of such clinics has increased significantly over the past 5 years and there&#8217;s evidence &#8220;to suspect that 89 for-profit clinics in 5 provinces appear to be in breach of the Canada Health Act,&#8221; states the 169-page Eroding Public Medicare: Lessons and Consequences of For-Profit Health Care Across Canada report.<br />But federal and provincial officials &#8220;have fallen down in their responsibility to protect patients against extra billing and 2-tier care,&#8221; says report author Natalie Mehra, director of the Ontario Health Coalition.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Fox article quotes the same Natalie, but not those quotes.</p>
<p>The CMAJ article continues:<br />
<blockquote>Researchers also found evidence of physicians practising in hospitals but referring patients to their private for-profit businesses, where medically necessary services would be provided more quickly, for an out-of-pocket fee&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>So, some illegal stuff is going on (boom in private activity), the government was suppose to do something about it, but it didn&#8217;t.  Can you say “conservative, Milton Freedmon governance”?  </p>
<p>Continuing:<br />
<blockquote>In 1995, then-federal health minister Diane Marleau issued a policy interpretation letter calling on provinces to introduce “regulatory frameworks” to govern the operation of private clinics, and make illegal the “facility fees” charged by private clinics which provide publicly-insured services.</p></blockquote>
<p>Basically as I read the real article, the boom is actually starting to create what we have here in the USA.  A two class society regarding health care access with rising expenditures as doc&#8217;s have the market opportunity to charge more via cash deals.  Kind of a black market situation?  Is the solution to be more like us, or is the solution to solve the bottle neck of not enough doctors?  Or maybe the problem is that once you let people who can pay for them self do so (choice?), you begin the destruction of what was a system that treated everyone equally.  That is, for a basic human need such as health care, everyone is of the same stature. </p>
<p>We have a great opportunity here with Canada.  What happened in our banking system is what has happened to Canada&#8217;s health care funding system.  Same ideology implimented, same distruction for the benefit of the few.</p>
<p>We are seeing the effects of what happens when the ideology of individual freedom is made predominat in an economic system that assured equality regarding basic needs.  That is the key: Basic Needs.  Not wants, not money beyond autonomous consumption, but money at autonomous consumption.  It is libertarian economics vs Jefferson democracy economics.  Personal economic freedom for needs funnels down the benefits of human progress to  fewer people instead of expanding the benefits to every more people.</p>
<p>There was one letter responding to the CMAJ article.  <a href="http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=2670895">An open letter to the minister of health</a>Paul C. Hébert, MD MHSc, Editor-in-Chief<br />
<blockquote>After more than a decade, the health system has not fully recovered from the <strong>last round of federal cuts in the mid-1990s</strong>. The large reduction of about 10% in federal funding for health forced provincial governments to axe many health care programs, close some hospitals and reduce the number of beds in the remaining institutions, as well as slash training positions for physicians and other health care providers&#8230; Provincial governments have become much more autonomous and, in many instances, unwilling to adopt new programs and standards in the interest of all Canadians. The ongoing jurisdictional battle between federal and provincial governments, whether over First Nations health, public health, access to care and expensive medications or the setting of national standards, suggests that the federal government has little influence on Canada’s health systems. The ability of the provinces to offer private services1 and mount administrative barriers to portability of services without consequences is a constant reminder of this weakened federal authority&#8230;Canada’s health care systems seem to be moving further and further away from fulfilling the promise of the Canada Health Act. </p>
<p>The reason for limited progress is an erosion of national leadership in health. <strong>Successive federal governments have either decreased investments or, through inaction, allowed health to be a purely provincial matter.</strong> Despite the importance of health in the minds of the voting public, we remain very concerned that health has slipped entirely off the federal agenda.</p></blockquote>
<p>Get it?  What is actually happening in Canada is the results of the Grover Norquist training manual for conservative governance, the goal of which is the drowning of anything that suggests a social conscience.  </p>

<p>Note 1: Read these tables with care! Page 1 compares currently non-elderly insured to projected non-elderly insured. This is how you end up with 97% of Americans with insurance in 2019 even as that drops to only 90% for non-elderly American citizens. <s>21</s> 34 million uninsured still seems too high to me but as footnote &#8216;d&#8217; indicates this includes people eligible for but not enrolled in Medicaid.<br />&#8220;</p>

<p>So, American&#8217;s put an intellectual in the president&#8217;s seat.   It&#8217;s been called pragmatism.  We cheer the return of science and thus critical thinking to our politics.  Yet, here we are at the cusp of the next great societal character development issue since we figured out after the depression there was class war in the US and we get this:<br />&#8220;If you establish a public option at the forefront that goes head-to-head and competes with the private health insurance market &#8230; the public option will have significant price advantages,&#8221; she said.<br />Yes, Maine&#8217;s finest: Olympia Snowe as she argues against making the public option available at the get go.  </p>
<p>But, this concept is not new.  It dates back to 2006 when the <a href="http://www.cahi.org/cahi_contents/resources/pdf/CAHI_Medicare_Admin_Final_Publication.pdf">Council for Affordable Health Insurance</a> presented a 17 page report suggesting the same thing.  And!, now we have the <a href="http://www.heritage.org/research/healthcare/wm2505.cfm">Heritage foundation</a> dittoing the same report.  (More on that coming at AB by the other bloggers here.) </p>
<p>But, never fear, Sam&#8217;s got you covered.  He explains the appropriateness of Olympia&#8217;s thinking.</p>
