<p>Ok folks.  It&#8217;s real, this familiarity with the health care reform debate.  It is a real memory you are experiencing, that deja vu feeling.   Only, the reason it seems so much as deja vu is because what your  being told is the trigger of the deja vu is not the real memory.  Hillary Care is not the correct memory for the current debate and thus it &#8220;feels&#8221; like you have been there before: deja vu.  However, you really have been there before, and thus it is a real memory, not a similar feeling.  It was Nixon, 1971.  And, the experience of the mind games that are being tempted upon you are as real and cautioning a memory as having burned your hand on a hot pan, or caught a knief falling.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QkgUkM0o6Q">February 17, 1971</a></p>
<p>Ehrlichman: We have now narrowed down the vice president&#8217;s problems on this thing to one issue, and that is whether we should include these Health Maintenance Organizations like Edgar Kaiser&#8217;s Permanente thing.<br />Nixon: Now let me ask you&#8230;You know I&#8217;m not to keen on any of these damn medical programs.<br />Ehrlichman: This is a private enterprise one.<br />Nixon: Well that appeals to me.<br />Ehrlichman: Edgar Kaiser is running this Permanente deal for profit.  And the reason that he can, the reason he can do it&#8230;I had Edgar Kaiser come in, talk to me about this.  And I went into some depth.  <strong>All of the incentives are toward less medical care.  Because the less care they give them, the more money they make.</strong>  <br />Nixon: Fine<br />Ehrlichman: &#8230;and the incentives run the right way.<br />Nixon: Not bad.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=3311">February 18, 1971</a><br />Nixon&#8217;s Special Message to Congress proposing a National Health Strategy</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to start with his last paragraph:<br />
<blockquote>Nineteen months ago I said that America&#8217;s medical system faced a &#8220;massive crisis.&#8221; Since that statement was made, that crisis has deepened. All of us must now join together in a common effort to meet this crisis&#8211;each doing </p></blockquote>
<p>Going forward, I only excerpted the parts related to insurance because the truth now as then is that the real issue when this nation talks about health care reform, is that we are only talking about how the money will travel to pay for it.  Cost controls are always second and presented as a results of how the money will travel.  Improved outcomes are always third and a result of how the money will travel.  Tort reform equals how the money will travel.  More people having access?  Again a result of how the money will travel. </p>
<p>What follows are Nixon&#8217;s arguments for keeping a private system.  The points should all sound very familiar.  There are a few items however that might surprise you as to him being a republican compared to today&#8217;s “republican”.  In the end, it is still the republican (and now also DLC) ideology of free market rhetoric supporting a discussion of what I consider the false market in “health care reform”: The third party, the middleman.</p>
<p>This is long after the jump.  Please take the time to read Nixon&#8217;s words.  Reading such history first hand is the only means we have for growing a more mature social personality.</p>
<p>As you read, pay attention to the reasoning and expected results, then compare them to today.  Today, is the actual results.  The results are what we are living.</p>
<p>Recognize the sales pitch.  Recognize the appeal to humanistic needs as part of the pitch for the product. Nixon was not trying to sell a better America.  That was just jive talk to sell HMO&#8217;s.  Recognize such in today&#8217;s presentation.  </p>
<p>Continuing Nixon&#8217;s presentation:<br /><em>Our record, then, is not as good as it should be. Costs have skyrocketed but values have not kept pace. We are investing more of our nation&#8217;s resources in the health of our people but we are not getting a full return on our investment.</p>
<p>This new strategy should be built on four basic principles. <br />1. Assuring Equal Access<br />2. Balancing Supply and Demand.<br />3. Organizing for Efficiency.  There are two particularly useful ways of doing this: </p>
<p>A. Emphasizing Health Maintenance. In most cases our present medical system operates episodically&#8211;people come to  it in moments of distress&#8211;when they require its most expensive services. Yet both the <br />system, and those it serves would be better off if less expensive services could be delivered on a more <br />regular basis&#8230; In short, we should build a true &#8220;health&#8221; system-and not a &#8220;sickness&#8221; system alone. We should work to maintain health and not merely to restore it. <br />B. Preserving Cost Consciousness. As we determine just who should bear the various costs of health care, we should remember that only as people are aware of those costs will they be motivated to reduce them. When consumers pay virtually nothing for services and when, at the same time, those who provide services know that all their costs will also be met, then neither the consumer nor the provider has an incentive to use the system efficiently.</p>
<p>4. Building on Strengths. We should also avoid holding the whole of our health care system responsible for failures in some of its parts. There is a natural temptation in dealing with any complex problem to say: &#8220;Let us wipe the slate clean and start from scratch.&#8221; But to do this-to dismantle our entire health insurance system, for example&#8211;would be to ignore those important parts of the system which have provided useful service&#8230;</p>
<p>One of those strengths is the diversity of our system&#8211;and the range of choice it therefore provides to doctors and patients alike. I believe the public will always be better served by a pluralistic system than by a monolithic one, by a system which creates many effective centers of responsibility&#8211;both public and private&#8211;rather than one that concentrates authority in a single governmental source. </p>
<p>A. REORGANIZING THE DELIVERY OF SERVICE </p>
<p><strong>In recent years, a new method for delivering health services has achieved growing respect.</strong> This new approach has two essential attributes. It brings together a comprehensive range of medical services in a single organization so that a patient is assured of convenient access to all of them. And it provides needed services for a fixed contract fee which is paid in advance by all subscribers. </p>
<p>Such an organization can have a variety of forms and names and sponsors. One of the strengths of this new concept, in fact, is its great flexibility. <strong>The general term which has been applied to all of these units is &#8220;HMO&#8221;&#8211;&#8220;Health Maintenance Organization.&#8221; </strong><br />The most important advantage of Health Maintenance Organizations is that they increase the value of the services a consumer receives for each health dollar. <strong>This happens, first, because such organizations provide a strong financial incentive for better preventive care and for greater efficiency. </strong>A fixed-price contract for comprehensive care reverses this illogical incentive. <strong>Under this arrangement, income grows not with the number of days a person is sick but with the number of days he is well. HMO&#8217;s therefore have a strong financial interest in preventing illness,</strong> or, failing that, in treating it in its early stages, promoting a thorough recovery, and preventing any reoccurrence. Like doctors in ancient China, they are paid to keep their clients healthy. For them, economic interests work to re-enforce their professional interests.</p>
<p>&#8230;So is this administration. That is why we proposed legislation last March to enable Medicare recipients to join such programs. That is why I am now making the following additional recommendations: <br />2. To help new HMO&#8217;s get started-an expensive and complicated task&#8211;<strong>we should establish a new $23 million program of planning grants to aid potential sponsors&#8211;in both the private and public sector. </strong><br />At the same time, we should provide additional support to help sponsors raise the necessary capital, construct needed facilities, and sustain initial operating deficits until they achieve an enrollment which allows them to pay their own way. <strong>For this purpose, I propose a program of Federal loan guarantees which will enable private sponsors to raise some $300 million in private loans during the first year of the program. </strong></em>(In 2009 dollars that&#8217;s:  $1,594,443,347.32  using the Consumer Price Index, $1,270,112,394.52  using the GDP deflator, using value of consumer bundle, $1,572,128,637.06  using the unskilled wage, $2,589,331,122.17  using the nominal GDP per capita, $3,796,805,962.20  using the relative share of GDP)</p>
<p><em>F. A NATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE PARTNERS HIP <br />In my State of the Union Message, I pledged to present a program &#8220;to ensure that no American family will be prevented from obtaining basic medical care by inability to pay.&#8221; I am announcing that program today. <strong>It is a comprehensive national health insurance program, one in which the public and the private sectors would join in a new partnership to provide adequate health insurance for the American people. </strong></p>
<p>In the last twenty years, the segment of our population owning health insurance has grown from 50 percent to 87 percent and the portion of medical bills paid for by insurance has gone from 35 percent to 60 percent. But despite this impressive growth, there are still serious gaps in present health insurance coverage. Four such gaps deserve particular attention. </em>(Ok, well this has definitely been reversed.)<br /><em>First&#8211;too many health insurance policies focus on hospital and surgical costs and leave critical outpatient services uncovered&#8230; Because demand goes where the dollars are, the result is an unnecessary&#8211;and expensive&#8212; overutilization of acute care facilities. The average hospital stay today is a full day longer than it was eight years ago. </em>(Yup, fixed that one.)</p>
<p><em>A second problem is the failure of most private insurance policies to protect against the catastrophic costs of major illnesses and accidents. Only 40 percent of our people have catastrophic cost insurance of any sort and most of that insurance has upper limits of $10,000 or $15,000. This means that insurance often runs out while expenses are still mounting. <strong>For many of our families, the anguish of a serious illness is thus compounded by acute financial anxiety. Even the joy of recovery can often be clouded by the burden of debt&#8211;and even by the threat of bankruptcy. </strong><br />A third problem with much of our insurance at the present time is that it cannot be applied to membership in a Health Maintenance Organization&#8211;and thus effectively precludes such membership. No employee will pay to join such a plan, no matter how attractive it might seem to him, when deductions from his paycheck&#8211;along with contributions from his employer&#8211;are being used to purchase another health insurance policy. </p>
<p>The fourth deficiency we must correct in present insurance coverage is its failure to help the poor gain sufficient access to our medical system. Just one index of this failure is the fact that fifty percent of poor children are not even immunized against common childhood diseases. </em>(We are above 80% now.) <em>The disability rate for families below the poverty line is at least 50 percent higher than for families with incomes above $10,000. </p>
<p>Our National Health Insurance Partnership is designed to correct these inadequacies&#8211;not by destroying our present insurance system but by improving it. Rather than giving up on a system which has been developing impressively, we should work to bring about further growth which will fill in the gaps we have identified. To this end, I am recommending the following combination of public and private efforts. </p>
<p>1. I am proposing that a National Health Insurance Standards Act be adopted which <strong>will require employers to provide basic health insurance coverage for their employees.</strong>  </em>(Guess that answers the question of why we have an employment based system. Oops!  Hey, no Walmart then either.)</p>
<p><em>2. I am also proposing that a new Family Health Insurance Plan be established to meet the special needs of poor families who would not be covered by the proposed National Health Insurance Standards Act&#8211;those that are headed by unemployed, intermittently employed or self-employed persons. <br />Accordingly, I propose that the part of Medicaid which covers most welfare families be eliminated. <strong>The new Family Health Insurance Plan that takes its place would be fully financed and administered by the Federal Government.</strong> It would provide health insurance to all poor families with children headed by self-employed or unemployed persons whose income is below a certain level. For a family of four persons, the eligibility ceiling would be $5,000.  </em>(I&#8217;ll say it for Fox News: Democrat President Nixon today proposed&#8230;)</p>
<p><em>Our program would also require the establishment in each State of special insurance pools which would offer insurance at reasonable group rates to people who did not qualify for other programs: the self-employed, for example, and poor risk individuals who often cannot get insurance. </em>Did I hear something about co-ops?)</p>
<p><em><strong>I also urge the Congress to take further steps to improve Medicare. For one thing, beneficiaries should be allowed to use the program to join Health Maintenance Organizations.</strong> </em>(Well it took 30+ years, but they got that: Medicare Advantage.)</p>
<p><em>&#8230;To begin with, there simply is no need to eliminate an entire segment of our private economy and at the same time add a multibillion dollar responsibility to the Federal budget. <strong>Such a step should not be taken unless all other steps have failed.</strong> <br />More than that, such action would be dangerous. It would deny people the right to choose how they will pay for their health care. It would remove competition from the insurance system&#8211;and with it an incentive to experiment and innovate&#8230;There is a better way&#8211;a more practical, more effective, less expensive, and less dangerous way&#8211;to reform and renew our nation&#8217;s health system. </em></p>
<p>38 years since this speech.  A speech that has all the same talking points regarding a private, free market based system as we heard with Hillary Care and today.  We did the employer based HMO version of private insurance after the other version (BCBS employer based) did not work including the HMO medicare experiment in this decade.   We are worse off than ever by all reports from all parties.  It was not “ a better way&#8211;a more practical, more effective, less expensive, and less dangerous way&#8230;”.  It has failed.  People are in more danger today.  All other ways have failed: a no health insurance system, an employer based non-profit private system, an employer based for profit private system and privatizing a single payer, government run system.  The time has come.  We have met the exception that Nixon gave the nation.  We can now prove or disprove that there is such a creature as the “rational consumer”.</p>
<p>Ehrlichman: Edgar Kaiser is running this Permanente deal for profit.  And the reason that he can, the reason he can do it&#8230;I had Edgar Kaiser come in, talk to me about this.  And I went into some depth.  <strong>All of the incentives are toward less medical care.  Because the less care they give them, the more money they make. </strong> <br />Nixon: <strong>Fine</strong><br />Ehrlichman: <strong>&#8230;and the incentives run the right way.</strong><br />Nixon: <strong>Not bad.</strong></p>

<p>For your consideration here are some real numbers from a Medicare Advantage policy via United Health Care</p>
<p>Cat Scan billed  $1042.00<br />Not Covered      $ 831.68<br />That means the contracted charge for this service with UHC is $210.32.<br />Copay                $   42.06<br />UHC payment   $ 168.26</p>
<p>The &#8220;copay&#8221; is 20%.  </p>
<p>Same plan has a &#8220;Deductible/Copay&#8221; individual combined limit of $3800.00/yr.</p>
<p>Ok, lets look at this.  Eye Exam.  <br />This is for my dad in the nursing home.<br />Service code 92004  $217.00.  Medicare paid Zero.<br />Same code, 92004 via the doc my daughter saw was $160.  This was discounted to $40.00and my share was zero.</p>
<p>Here is the issue, rational consumer and all that, how can we expect to get costs under control if the billed amounts and the paid/contracted amounts are so far apart?  The consumer does not know the contracted rates, so the consumer can not purchase the insurance that pays the least.  Thus, the consumer can not be &#8220;rational&#8221; when choosing health care.  (Like we&#8217;re rational at anytime with this!)  Basically, there is nothing in our current approach to the issue that economic theory would suggest is viable.  Or maybe economic theory doesn&#8217;t apply?</p>
<p>At the same time, how do we know that these contracted prices are the correct price such that the market is &#8220;clearing&#8221; properly or in &#8220;equilibrium&#8221; of some sorts such that there is a reasonable profit for the providers and payers with reasonable cost for the consumer while producing the product of highest quality (as in it did not harm you and did actually help you)?  These prices could be distressed prices in that the provider accepts them so that they can capture some of the patients planning to make up the difference in cash patients or other higher contracted fees.  For the lawyers that read this blog, we are talking about &#8220;contracts of adhesion&#8221;.  That is a contract signed where one party has most of the power.  But then, what would you expect when you exempt a type of business from the anti-monopoly laws.  In the past they were public utilities.</p>
<p>This leads to the question of just how can congress and Obama believe (and it is a belief because all examples of what is being proposed have failed in the past, MA being the most recent) their &#8220;public plan&#8221; is going to ultimately produce the savings that will allow coverage of 50 million more people, better product quality and happy, smiling Americans?  After all, if the contracted rates are all over the map, then there will be massive cost shifting either by insured selection or subscriber (patient) deductible manipulation.  And, there will still be a need for all  the administration to &#8220;manage&#8221; the care which is in actuality a paper chase game.  </p>
<p>We talk about pricing.  Medicare wants to reduce the rates and that will just shift the burden onto the privates is the complaint.  Well, I got news for all of you.  The privates use the medicare fee schedules all the time and then start cutting from there.  So, this is a bogus complaint by the privates/non-profits.</p>
<p>I assure you, though you may disagree, there is no way to fix health care via market theory when the approach is to believe that the market is with the middle man; the insurers.  Private, public or non-profit, the problem with health care cost and all that leads to can not be found there because that is not the real market.  </p>
<p>How much more and for how long do we continue to pay the privates more via Medicare Advantage before congress gets this message that the issue can not be fixed by focusing on a false market?  <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/views04/1007-35.htm">From 2004</a>.  </p>
<p>Note <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/view/2009/06/14-3">this report</a> on Nick Skala presentation of June 4, 2009 in front of the &#8220;Progressive Caucus&#8221;.  <br />
<blockquote>“Bill Gould emailed me after reading my testimony and materials I was going to present to tell me that they were not acceptable and that there could be no comparison between single payer and the public option with side by side comparison,” Skala told Single Payer Action. “<strong>Darcy Burner</strong> told me that they would construe talking about the public option  — even comparing it to single payer — as an attack on the members of the Progressive Caucus.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Darcy Burner; the candidate that Blue America backed.  Head of the American Progressive Caucus Policy Foundation whose tag line is: <br />
<blockquote>organization whose mission is to bring together the collective wisdom of progressives inside and outside of Congress to promote <br />* the health and economic well-being of us all.</p></blockquote>
<p>Both are caucus&#8217; that should be aware that the people want a medicare like program.  The numbers are <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&#038;q=Polls+support+single+payer+system&#038;aq=f&#038;oq=&#038;aqi=">landslide size</a>.  The numbers should completely put to bed the meme of &#8220;not politically possible&#8221; if this nation actually worked it&#8217;s Constitution.  And, if there is a caucus that should be working the Constitution as the normal course of it&#8217;s function, it should be a caucus that titles it&#8217;s self &#8220;Progressive&#8221;.  Certainly a person who was a candidate for Blue America should get it!</p>
<p>Talking about a single payer system to the congress people who are part of a caucus FOUNDED by Senator Bernie Sanders, a &#8220;<a href="http://www.democracynow.org/2006/11/8/vermonts_bernie_sanders_becomes_first_socialist">self described socialist</a>&#8221; who is promoting single payer every chance he can, is to be construed as &#8220;an attack on the members&#8221;?  ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME!  What! Prgressive suddenly do not like to learn about stuff&#8230;factually?<br />
<blockquote>“During the presentation it was very nasty,” Skala said. “I got some very dirty looks from Darcy Burner. During the question period and once during the testimony, I was interrupted, told that the Progressive Caucus had taken a position on this issue and unless I had something positive to contribute, then there wasn’t really much point to answering my questions.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here is Nick Skala&#8217;s <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/view/2009/06/16-4">actual presentation</a>.</p>
<p>So, what does it say about a nation that states it is a democracy and yet the very organizations who should understand the implications of naming one self such, is unwilling to do the peoples bidding?  This is not hard folks.  A caucus&#8217; job is not to do what is politically simple, it is to make the perceived politically impossible a social reality based on that caucus&#8217; ideals.  Well, if your ideals are &#8220;progressive&#8221;, if you are a part of a group founded by a socialist, and 65 to 70%of the people want something that by all Fox News reports is progressive and socialist then: How much easier can it get?</p>

                                <p>by Divorced one like Bush</p>
<p>Time for some real numbers.  This example is also an example for people to understand the need for fixing our system of paying for health care.  Because, even in the senior years, the cost can bankrupt you.</p>
<p>My parents, 2008 adjusted gross income $43,291.  $19,745 is capital gains from a one time sale of land.  This land was taken by the state of RI via eminent domain law.  See, Fidelity didn&#8217;t have enough land (300 acres via a low rent to the state in exchange for some jobs) if Dow Chemical was going to put a plant there.  Dow never built.   The land was worth around $400K on the open commercial market.  They got $180K divided by 3.  The land was in the family for centuries.</p>
<p>$15,502 in SS not taxed.</p>
<p>My step-father is in the nursing home.  Mom is currently paying the bill because they own the house.  It&#8217;s around $6500/m.  He&#8217;s on a few meds.  9 to be exact.  </p>
<p>The Plan: No deductible.  $2700 in total drug costs (co-pay plus plan pay) covered before the &#8220;coverage gap&#8221;.  </p>
<p>Total expense as of 4/30: $2804.20.  Coverage Gap: $4350.   Amount toward the Gap: $1098.06  Balance of TrOOP (true out of pocket): $3251.94.</p>
<p>After the &#8220;Coverage Gap&#8221; he enters Catastrophic Coverage.  The cost is $2.40/generic, $6/brand name.</p>
<p>So, he&#8217;s in the nursing home.  He might be able to get off of 1 maybe 2 of these if we can get him home.  Still, the cost of his meds have been running $370/m.  Now that he has entered the &#8220;Coverage Gap&#8221; the cost will be $700/m.  That is 4.6 months of paying before the rest of the insurance kicks in sometime in September 2009.  </p>
<p>$43,291 &#8211; $19,745 (cap gains) + 15,502 (SS) = $39,048 to live on.  <br />$39,048 &#8211; 4350 (Coverage Gap) = 34,698.00 to live on.   </p>
<p>Of course, some things have changed since the &#8220;crash&#8221;.  $8149 of that $34, 698 was dividends.  They cashed out this year.  So, that leaves $26,549 to live on.  We could have waited the crash out, but see, dad&#8217;s in a nursing home.  Either the home takes it, or the economy takes it. Either way, it&#8217;s not there to generate money from money.</p>
<p>$26,549 &#8211; $5989 (property tax) &#8211; $3922 (utilities) &#8211; $3038 (Insurance) &#8211; $5230 (auto expenses) = $8370 to live on.<br />Last year there was $8328 in medical expenses EXCLUDING meds.  I don&#8217;t expect that much this year, but there could be at least half that.  Mom needs some stents for the renal arteries before her vascular system pops from the very high Bp.</p>
<p>Total medical, out of pocket expenses, 2008: $9484.  Potential this year: $8,000 to12,000 approximately not including the nursing home costs.  That is $26,680 to date.  Even if he is home, there will be cost for home care help.</p>
<p>What does someone do who is not in their position?  Of course, if the medical is as last year, they will be in the hole financially.</p>

<p>Both President Obama and Senator Max Baucus, key players in the health reform debate, have now indicated that one source of funding for health care reform on the table is a possible limitation in the exclusion from income of employer-provided insurance. See, e.g., Connolly, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/0602/AR2009060201491.html">President  Pivots on Taxing Benefits: Obama is Willing to Consider Move to Gain Health  Reform</a>, Washington Post, June 3, 2009.</p>
<p>The immediate reaction (seen in the comments section on the cited article) is rejection of this alternative. After all, many of us rely heavily on the fact that we have health insurance through work, and those of us in the lower income brackets probably would not be able to afford health insurance (at least, under the current privatized system) without that benefit. </p>
<p>But is the populist response the right one? We should not lose sight of the fact that the employer-provided insurance exclusion is the biggest tax expenditure in the Code that, like most tax expenditures, also tends to benefit most the highest income individuals. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities has put out a new report titled<a href="http://www.cbpp.org/cms/index.cfm?fa=view&#038;id=2832"> </a><a href="http://www.cbpp.org/cms/index.cfm?fa=view&#038;id=2832">Limiting the Tax  Exclusion for Employer-Sponsored Insurance Can Help Pay for Health Reform</a> that addresses this question directly. The Center notes that the tax expenditure is &#8220;poorly targeted&#8221; and benefits most the high income group who &#8220;least needs help paying for health insurance.&#8221; Lower-income taxpayers get less from the benefit because they may not have jobs, even if they have jobs they may choose to forego participation because of the cost of their share of the premium, and even if they participate, they get less of a benefit (in absolute dollar terms) because their tax rate is lower.</p>
<p> Here&#8217;s the graph showing the benefit relative to the income group.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_nZQOM7xKY6k/Si2WcIYLFfI/AAAAAAAAAAM/OE-iDeAhGiI/s1600-h/CBPP.+tax+break+for+ER+provided+insurance.+6a00d8341c4eab53ef011570b9d1d2970b-350wi.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_nZQOM7xKY6k/Si2WcIYLFfI/AAAAAAAAAAM/OE-iDeAhGiI/s400/CBPP.+tax+break+for+ER+provided+insurance.+6a00d8341c4eab53ef011570b9d1d2970b-350wi.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a>
<p>CBPP suggests that the exclusion can be reformed without eliminating the  value of employer-provided health insurance.  One of the concerns is that  employers will no longer provide the benefit if it becomes taxable, but a &#8220;play  or pay&#8221; requirement could discourage that option and mitigate its effects.  CBPP  suggests that concerns about a rigid cap that would apply in all cases can be  mitigated by adjusting the cap when a firm is relative small (so that more goes  to administrative costs) or has more older and sicker workers (so that more  health care costs must be covered) and for other, similar issues.  The paper  provides three specific alternatives for structuring the limitation in order to  promote the goal of universal health coverage.  </p>
