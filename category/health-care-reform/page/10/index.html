                                <p>By divorced one like Bush</p>
<p>It seems to go without saying, that if there is reform, there will be some type of assistance for those who need it.  Some numbers are bandied about as to the cutoff points.  The <a href="https://www.mahealthconnector.org/portal/site/connector/menuitem.0c5d8e0f63bf313ea6c05667d6468a0c/">Mass Connector</a> has it&#8217;s formula up that you can play with by punching in your own numbers and picking a Mass zip code.</p>
<p>However, I have noted in my very <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/04/this-is-continuation-of-looking-at.html">early posts</a> here at AB, that we seem to have slowly understated over time the amount of money actually required to be middle class in the US.  I looked at this further <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/03/im-converting-dollars-in-order-to-save.html">here</a>.  It&#8217;s not just the amount of money, it is the standard of living that has been down graded as we argue over implementing social policy.  The clearest standard is that it takes two earners to accomplish what one earner use to.  Now, with 47 million and rising, bankruptcy due to medical bills hitting 73% of all filings, having health care seems to no longer be a marker of having achieved middle class and thus the American Dream.</p>
<p>Such  thinking could be a problem if we truly want to solve our issue of access to health care services.  Mass knew that those at 350% to 450% of poverty would have difficulty buying insurance  in their system.  They may not view it as such, but this is an admission that our numbers regarding what income level is middle class (other than simple mean and median) are bogus.  We are lying to ourselves and when we lie to ourselves, we prevent ourselves from actually resolving the issue in question.  We&#8217;re faking ourselves out!  In doing so, we are further moving away from what was the accepted standard of living as representative of the American Dream.  In fact, it has occurred to me that the political approach of redefining what will be considered a successful campaign and thus problem solved regarding any social oriented piece of legislation by reducing the expectations or size of the problem to be resolved has only lead our standard of living and thus the American Dream being defined down. It&#8217;s one step removed from just plain ignoring the problem as if it does not exist.  Though ignoring a problem is at least not patronizing to those with the problem as is defining it down and declaring it solved.</p>
<p>This brings me to the defined poverty level.  A couple weeks ago I received an email as part of an ongoing health care debate that claimed to prove via a referenced article that there are not 47 million uninsured because 48% of those are earning 250% of poverty which is about $65K and thus choose not to purchase health insurance.  I suspected there was something wrong and thus went looking.</p>
<p>Well, it turns out that <a href="http://www.coverageforall.org/pdf/FHCE_FedPovertyLevel.pdf">250% of poverty</a> at $65K per year is for a family of 5! A gross income of  $65K for a family of 5 leaves nothing for purchasing health insurance.  It is also an income level that in Mass would have subsidies to help pay for health insurance.</p>
<p>I then thought: I wonder what the poverty level was in the old days.  You can find the data I used <a href="http://aspe.hhs.gov/poverty/09poverty.shtml">here</a>.<br />You can find the converting <a href="http://www.measuringworth.com/index.html">here</a>.  Then click on &#8220;Relative Values &#8211; US&#8221; in the left hand column.</p>
<p>The following chart looks at 5 decades (though I could not find exactly 1960 and 1970) and then compare them using CPI, Unskilled Labor, GDP per Capita and Share of GDP.  <br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_ea3-LcbrX8A/So7OhQGa6CI/AAAAAAAAAOA/mwBix13UzFQ/s1600-h/250+percent+poverty+Family+of+5+chart.JPG"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_ea3-LcbrX8A/So7OhQGa6CI/AAAAAAAAAOA/mwBix13UzFQ/s400/250+percent+poverty+Family+of+5+chart.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a> Certainly based on the CPI conversion, the numbers coming forward to today seem to be as they should.  But then, poverty levels are based on CPI.  However, looking at Unskilled labor, that family of 5 is getting under paid compared to the old days of 1962.  The family has been on a over all downward trend.  In the 70&#8217;s  it was a real roller coaster being down by &#8217;73, up by &#8217;75, heading down by &#8217;76, bottoming in 1978.   Even their poverty level based on GDP/cap and share of GDP bottomed.  Funky times indeed.  From the 1978 bottom this family had a steady gain but, it peaked in 1996.  This is the same year the income share to the 99%  fell below personal consumption.  </p>
<p>What I find most interesting is just how dramatic the change at 250% of poverty level for a family of 5 is based on the GDP share and per capita.  My interpretation is that a person at this level of income has continually become poorer even though the income that is considered 250% of poverty level has remained constant comparatively over the decades based on CPI.  I guess this bodes well for those who have finagled the CPI?  Most interesting, is 2007.  It is the only year where this family&#8217;s income was valued more than the share of GDP and GDP per capita values.  Frankly, I don&#8217;t know what to say about it.  It is no wonder people don&#8217;t know if they are coming or going regarding their financial condition.  Though a tendency toward the &#8220;going&#8221; feeling certainly can be understood.  Even the anger expressed at the town halls can be more readily appreciated in that the mind can only handle so many cycles of ups and downs before it finally starts to crack.  </p>
<p>It is this clash between the CPI and the GDP converters that is the fake out. If we continue to have such a dichotomy, then our efforts to assure &#8220;affordable health care&#8221; will be never ending because we are simply not being honest about how much it costs to be middle class and have the American Dream.  Nor should we expect the apparent lunacy to subside as longs one&#8217;s mind has to deal with the clash between what it is living verse what it is being told it is are living. </p>

                                <p>Ken Houghton notes the obvious corollary to Bruce Webb&#8217;s post on the 1st: if you don&#8217;t &#8220;<a target="_blank" href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/08/read-bill-movement.html">read the bill</a>,&#8221; the obstructionists will lie about it. UPDATE: And now corrects his misreading (see Bruce&#8217;s update below, following on Mitt Shook&#8217;s comment).</p>
<p>Milt Shook demonstrates in detail that, even if you do, people such as Alan Caruba of ChronWatch will lie about it anyway. That <a target="_blank" href="http://pleasecutthecrap.typepad.com/main/deconstructing-rw-lies-hcbill.html">this post</a> is even necessary is saddening.  And that he has to point out fundamentals such as<br />
<blockquote>[Annual Limitation] is on how much a patient will have to pay, not a limit on the health care the patient receives. Watch how many times these tools bring up the &#8220;rationing&#8221; canard. It&#8217;s almost as often as they mention ACORN. (I kid you not. Just wait.)</p></blockquote>
<p>or my favorite: that maintaining a market depends on people being able to make informed choices:<br />
<blockquote> [Alan Caruba at ChronWatch] Page 72:  All private healthcare plans must conform to government rules to participate in a Healthcare Exchange.</p>
<p>[<s>Caruba</s>Shook] This is a phenomenally stupid complaint from a right wing ideological perspective, and it lays bare the moral bankruptcy in their arguments against universal health care. These are the same people who are always touting competition and choice as the most important aspects of capitalism. The point of the insurance exchange is to give people an obvious and transparent choice of health insurance options. A private insurance company can participate and offer their wares alongside the public option, if they so choose. If they don&#8217;t want to participate, they&#8217;re free to conduct business as usual, and they won&#8217;t have to conform to any government rules. Well, except for the ones they must already conform with&#8230;.They&#8217;ve always had to conform to government rules to participate in Medicare, and I don&#8217;t see any of them dropping out of business for that. [italics mine; snark omitted]</p></blockquote>
<p>Go <a target="_blank" href="http://pleasecutthecrap.typepad.com/main/deconstructing-rw-lies-hcbill.html">Read the Whole Thing</a>.  And think about all the good things Alan Caruba could have been doing if he hadn&#8217;t had to waste time dealing with deliberate misreading and outright lies.</p>

<p>In a previous post Robert asks the penetrating question <a target="_blank" href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/08/kevin-drum-huh.html">Kevin Drum Huh?</a> only to conclude quickly that he Robert was wrong and Kevin was right. I don&#8217;t agree for reasons laid out in comments, I invite anyone to join the discussion. But in the course of that a commenter suggested the answer could be easily be found by reading several thousand pages of Senate and House procedures. While this seems kind of round-about to me as compared to just supplying the relevant cite, I decided to dive in and find some relevant cites myself. So those who would like to follow me into the Heart of Darkness (otherwise known as the Senate Floor), I have copied some interesting(?) selections below.</p>
<p>The following are from CRS, Congress&#8217;s official research service and can be regarded as authoritative. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.senate.gov/CRSReports/crs-publish.cfm?pid=%26%2A2D4Q%5CK3%0A">The Legislative Process on the Senate Floor: an Introduction</a></p>
<p>First lets take a look at the Committee system. Any bolding is mine.<br />pg. 6<br />
<blockquote>Committee Referrel and Rule 14<br />The Senate’s standing committees play an essential part in the legislative process, as they select the small percentage of the bills introduced each Congress which, in their judgment, deserve the attention of the Senate as a whole, and as they recommend amendments to these bills based on their expert knowledge and experience. Most bills are routinely referred to the committee with appropriate jurisdiction as soon as they are introduced. However, if a Senator plans to introduce a bill and believes that the committee to which it would be referred will be unsympathetic, Rule XIV, paragraph 4, permits the Senator to bypass the standing committee system altogether and have the bill placed directly on the Calendar of Business, with exactly the same formal status the bill would have if it had been the subject of extensive hearings and exhaustive mark-up meetings in committee. <br />By the same token, if a committee fails to act on a bill that was referred to it, while this may mean the bill will die for lack of action, the proposal it embodies may not. The Senator sponsoring the bill may introduce a new bill with exactly the same provisions as the first, and have the second bill placed directly on the Calendar. In either event, the committee that has been circumvented may oppose bringing the bill from the Calendar to the floor by unanimous consent or by motion, but now the fate of the bill can be decided by the Senate as a whole, not only by one of its committees. Senators generally view this use of Rule XIV as a last resort, both because it undermines the committee system as a whole and because they do not wish to encourage a practice that can be used against their own committees. In recent practice, the Majority Leader sometimes also uses this method to put a measure directly on the Calendar—often to expedite consideration of a complicated or high-profile bill that has been drafted outside of the committee process. </p></blockquote>
<p>So I see nothing that would prevent Reid or indeed any Senator from introducing a bill identical to a passed HR3200 and putting it on the Calender without it ever going to Committee, equally any Senator can effectively extract a bill from Committee by the same procedure. Now bringing bill to a vote is a motion subject to debate and so a filibuster, but it seems that under this Rule no single Committee or Senator can unilaterally bottle up any bill permanently.</p>
<p>Well if Baucus can&#8217;t keep the bill from actually getting on the calender rather than trying to kill the bill outright can&#8217;t he let it come to the floor and then kill it by a whole series of amendments each of which can be filibustered? Well it depends on how much hard ball Reid would be willing to play.<br />
<blockquote>The House of Representatives may bring a question to a vote if a simple majority agrees to a motion to order the previous question. When meeting in Committee of the Whole, a majority of <br />Representatives also can move to close debate on a pending amendment or sometimes on a bill and all amendments to it. No such motions are possible in the Senate. As a result, a majority of Senators does not have nearly the same control over the pace and timing of their deliberations as does a majority of the House. <br />There is one partial exception to this generalization. The Senate often disposes of an amendment by agreeing to a motion to lay the amendment on the table. When a Senator who has been recognized makes this motion, it cannot be debated (except by unanimous consent, of course). If the Senate agrees to this motion to table, the amendment is rejected; to table is to kill. On the other hand, if the Senate defeats the motion, debate on the amendment may resume; the Senate only has determined that it is not prepared at that time to reject the amendment. Thus, a tabling motion can be used to stop debate even if there still are Senators wishing to speak, but only by defeating the amendment at issue. Although the effect of the motion is essentially negative, it frequently is a test vote on Senate support for an amendment. If the motion fails, the Senate may agree to the amendment shortly thereafter. But this is a reflection of political reality, not a requirement of Senate rules or precedents.</p></blockquote>
<p>Reid or Rockefeller puts a duplicate of a passed HR3200 on the calender, Reid proposes bringing it to the floor, rather than kill the bill outright, Baucus enters a series of amendments. All Reid needs is 50 Senators to vote to table the amendment, and then again on the next amendment.</p>
<p>All I am seeing here is a failure of will on the part of Reid. He doesn&#8217;t have to cater to Baucus unless he chooses to.</p>

                                <p>by cactus</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t remember where I saw <a href="http://www.oecd.org/document/20/0,3343,en_2649_201185_43471316_1_1_1_1,00.html" target="_blank">this OECD study first</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Finland, the Netherlands and Sweden have the lowest prices for mobile phone calls among OECD countries, according to the latest OECD Communications Outlook. The highest were found in Canada, Spain and the United States.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But after listening to folks on the right talk about healthcare, I know the above study has a number of implications:</p>
<p>1. The US (together with Canada and Spain) has the best cell phone service in the world.<br />2. The US (together with Canada and Spain) produces the most innovation in cell phone service anywhere in the world. Americans have access to the most advanced cell phones and cell phone service in the world. Finland, the Netherlands, and Sweden no doubt produce the least amount of cell phone innovation.<br />3. There are an awful lot of Finns and Swedes coming to the US in order to make calls and buy cell phones with features that just aren&#8217;t available in their home countries.<br />4. It is vital that customers in the US (plus Canada and Spain) continue to pay the highest rates for cell phone usage. Otherwise, the innovation will cease everywhere in the world and we&#8217;ll all be forced to start yelling at each other instead of using cell phones.<br />5. The few problems there are with cell phone service in the US would disappear if the government stopped interfering. Let the cell phone companies decide for themselves what frequencies to use.<br />6. If for some reason the government decided to offer cell phone service, nobody would ever be allowed to make a call on the network owned by a private company or buy a cell phone from a private providers<br />7. If for some reason the government decided to offer cell phone service, even if it did not make it illegal to make calls on someone else&#8217;s network, it would immediately drive out all the private providers. This is evidence that private providers are more efficient than the government.<br />8. Should the government decide to enter the cell phone market, it will start rationing the amount of phone calls people are allowed to make. And the elderly will get mandatory counseling on how to stop making phone calls permanently.<br />9. In the current system, nobody is denied access to phone calls in an emergency simply because they can&#8217;t afford cell phone service. Why, say some poor person (or God forbid, an illegal immigrant!!) needs to call the police because someone is breaking into their hovel. All they have to do is sneak past the criminals and wander around until they stumble on a phone.<br />10. Since we&#8217;re on the subject of poor people and illegal immigrants &#8211; the reason cell phone service is so expensive in the US is because those folks insist on using pay phones.</p>
<p>What has the OECD study combined with the debate on healthcare taught you?<br />_____________________________________<br />by cactus</p>

<p>Taxes are always fun, and there&#8217;s a few other things going on.  But, really, let me quote the Internet&#8217;s best current stylist (meaning prose, not hair), Susan of Texas, in a post called, appropriately, &#8220;<a target="blank" href="http://agonyin8fits.blogspot.com/2009/08/tired.html">Tired</a>&#8220;:<br />
<blockquote>The multitude of stupid out there in the health care discussion is beyond belief and utterly debilitating. This nation is simply too stupid to survive and I can&#8217;t deal with any more today&#8230;.reason and evidence don&#8217;t matter any more&#8211;stupid will win the day.</p>
<p>I believe that the economy is far worse off than people want to admit and that we will be permanently poorer; at least, some of us will&#8230;.I don&#8217;t expect an apocalypse or a return to 1800s bucolic splendor; I think we&#8217;ll just gradually get poorer and poorer, while telling ourselves that everyone else in the world has it much worse whether it is true or not.</p></blockquote>
<p>Read the Whole Thing.  Not just because she said it, but also because that&#8217;s what the Canadians and Brits with whom I was speaking over the past few months are all expecting as well.</p>
<p>If the drugs I can&#8217;t afford in the States kick in, maybe I&#8217;ll explain to Scott how <a target="blank" href="http://lefarkins.blogspot.com/2009/08/self-inflicted-wounds.html">this post</a> demonstrates that Dick Cheney is a better politician than BarryO and Rahm Emanuel combined.  But you already know that, and Scott in his heart probably does to.</p>

<p><strong>The Doomsday Scenario</strong></p>
<p>So why are conservatives so excited about health care reform?</p>
<p>Many see the progressive left pushing a gradual move to the Doomsday Scenario, something like this:</p>
<p>1)      private health insurance is hyper-regulated, underwriting standards are eliminated, and premium costs rise astronomically</p>
<p>2)      employers, especially smaller employers, drop coverage and push employees to the “public plan”</p>
<p>3)      the resulting dislocation of coverage and expansion of the public plan becomes a rationale for single payer – “see, we told you so” by the left</p>
<p>Having read thousands of pages of reform material over the past 18 months, and having studied the various reform movements since the early 90s, I think the Doomsday Scenario is quite feasible, and certainly I wouldn’t put it past the progressive left.</p>
<p>In public President Obama emphatically denies any such scenario. However, if the Scenario were to evolve, would he revert to his earlier ideas on single payer?</p>
<p>My request is for an honest debate. If Obama really wants to move to single payer, he should say so, and let the real debate begin.</p>
<p>For now, expect fireworks (not excusing rude behavior by the way). <br />________________________________<br />by Tom aka Rusty</p>

                                <p>by Tom Bozzo</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, reader Pete emailed a link to <a href="http://realclearpolitics.blogs.time.com/2009/06/27/busting-the-administrative-cost-benefit-myth/">Real Clear Politics</a>, where Tom Bevan cited <a href="http://www.heritage.org/Research/HealthCare/wm2505.cfm">an analysis by Robert Book of the Heritage Foundation</a> that purports to show that Medicare administrative costs, widely claimed (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/26/opinion/26krugman.html?_r=1&#038;ref=opinion">e.g.</a>) to be far lower than comparable private sector costs when expressed as a fraction of expenditures, actually are higher when expressed on a per-beneficiary basis.  This got its share of big-league attention at the time, with <a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2009/07/does-medicare-have-lower-administrative.html">Greg Mankiw</a> linking, <a href="http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~cook/movabletype/archives/2009/07/does_medicare_a.html">Andrew Gelman</a> reporting the result with some skepticism, and <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/06/administrative-costs/">Paul Krugman</a> offering the always worthwhile advice never to trust Heritage Foundation analysis.  More recently, <a href="http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~cook/movabletype/archives/2009/07/more_on_medicar.html">Gelman posted</a> to the effect that Heritage is shopping Book&#8217;s administrative cost claim (among others) as part of a broadside against government-run health care.</p>
<p>What seems to have gotten less attention is that even using Book&#8217;s preferred comparison (i.e. administrative expense per beneficiary instead of administrative expense as a fraction of outlays), the claim is bunk.  This is because Book, referencing an <a href="http://www.manhattan-institute.org/html/mpr_05.htm">analysis by Benjamin Zycher</a> of the (also right-wing) Manhattan Institute, takes a reasonable proposition — that the federal government incurs some Medicare-related costs not explicitly included in the Medicare budget — and proceeds to allocates billions of dollars with little or no causal nexus to the Medicare program as Medicare administration costs.  Book and Zycher call the resulting total of the budgeted and allocated costs the Medicare administrative costs and get the result that Medicare administration costs more than private-sector insurance per beneficiary.  Unfortunately for them, the result does not withstand a sane allocation of the federal expenditures they consider.</p>
<p>Details and a couple of ironies below the fold.</p>
<p>Directly measured Medicare administrative costs are 38 percent lower than private sector costs on the per-beneficiary measure Book prefers.  Thus one must find a lot of unmeasured Medicare cost to make Medicare look relatively costly in administration.  Indeed, Zycher and Book manage to come up with an allocation of indirect costs amounting to roughly 80 percent of the directly reported Medicare administration expenses.</p>
<p>The sign that something is seriously amiss is the large assignment of costs from the &#8220;administration of justice&#8221; function.  For Fiscal 2005, Zycher locates $42.1 billion in such costs in the federal budget and assigns $7.2 billion of that to Medicare, representing 75 percent of the indirect cost assignment.  That&#8217;s the share of Medicare costs in nondefense discretionary spending, an allocation method (which happens to assign a quite high share of costs to Medicare) that Zycher defends on the grounds that military justice is administered via the defense budget.</p>
<p>Neither Zycher nor Book seem to have given much consideration to what the &#8220;administration of justice&#8221; money is actually spent on, and particularly that much if not most of it might be spent administering justice (at least notionally) on behalf of society as a whole and not just other federal programs.  But there is such a thing as the <a href="http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/eande.htm#cjee">Expenditure and Employment Statistics</a> from the U.S. DOJ&#8217;s Bureau of Justice Statistics.  For FY2005, DOJ statistics indicate that $40 billion was spent in three main categories as follows: &#8220;police protection&#8221; ($22.5 billion), &#8220;judicial and legal&#8221; ($10.9 billion), and &#8220;corrections&#8221; ($6.6 billion).  Those figures include both spending on federal government programs and transfers to state and local government.</p>
<p>So if you were to think that even two or three billion dollars a year was being spent policing the Medicare program and locking up Medicare fraud perpetrators, then it would have to be that the federal courts are jammed with Medicare cases and not, say, civil litigation, drug prosecutions, etc.  There is, though, evidence of the actual scale of Medicare fraud prevention expenses.  The FY2010 budget includes <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/opa/pr/2009/May/09-ag-491.html">$311 million</a> for Medicare &#8220;program integrity&#8221; activities, which is a 50 percent increase over FY09.  The interagency Medicare Fraud Strike Force program <a href="http://www.stopmedicarefraud.gov/strikeforcesfactsheet.pdf">filed 125 criminal cases</a> [PDF] from March &#8217;07 to July &#8217;09, leading to prison sentences for 122 people averaging 49 months.  DOJ&#8217;s share of the increase is $19 million for FY2010, according to the <a href="http://www.cms.hhs.gov/PerformanceBudget/Downloads/CMSFY09CJ.pdf">CMS budget justification</a> [PDF].  So we&#8217;re looking at on the order of tens of millions of dollars in expenditures for other agencies policing the program, not billions.</p>
<p>So almost all of the $7.2 billion should be taken away from the allocated indirect Medicare expenses.  Being generous to Book and Zycher and taking away only $6 billion reduces the per-beneficiary expense for FY 2005 from Book&#8217;s $509 to $356.  That compares to $453 for private sector insurance.  So without addressing any of the other questionable expense allocations, Medicare administrative expense per beneficiary is at least 21 percent lower than that of private insurance.</p>
<p>Zycher also allocates an array of &#8220;general government&#8221; expenses in proportion to Medicare&#8217;s share of total federal expenditures.  Among the main contributors here is the cost of running the legislative branch and administering the tax system.  From an economist&#8217;s (versus an accountant&#8217;s) perspective, it is questionable whether much of these properly represent marginal or incremental costs of Medicare (something which Book, a PhD alum of the Chicago economics program, could be expected to consider in a perfect world).  For that matter, a program such as Medicare may well require less than it&#8217;s expense share of certain expenses as it&#8217;s funded largely through a simpler-to-administer tax and may not require the amount of legislative attention as much smaller discretionary programs.</p>
<p>But that doesn&#8217;t really matter, since the general government costs a la Zycher are not enough in themselves to make Medicare administration more costly per beneficiary than private insurance.</p>
<p>As for the ironies, here are a couple.  First, the &#8220;direct&#8221; Medicare administrative expenditures include a portion of the subsidies provided to private insurers under the Medicare Advantage program — a bit of Bush-era corporate welfare that subsidizes the private sector so that it can compete with traditional Medicare.  Second, much of Medicare administration, for instance claims processing, is contracted out.  So much of the comparison is of private sector entities operating under different incentive systems. </p>
<p>Finally, Zycher argues that even the inclusion of indirect costs understates the true cost of Medicare as it does not factor in the the economic burden of funding Medicare through distortionary taxes.  There&#8217;s less to this than meets the eye, regardless of how distortionary you think a payroll tax of a few percent might be.  The problem is that such Medicare tax distortion as there may be is not incurred against an alternative world of complete markets and perfect competition.  Real insurers charge at least average incremental costs (and thus exert some market power in the sense of being able to charge prices above marginal cost), and in the current private system many losses are uninsured or uninsurable.  Insofar as universal public health care provision can (or would) address a number of the private sector market imperfections, it&#8217;s at least a matter for careful analysis which system has the bigger economic losses.</p>

<p>How many people in the &#8220;Read the Bill&#8221; movement will in fact read the bill? Well here is their chance.<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://energycommerce.house.gov/Press_111/20090714/aahca.pdf">HR3200: Energy and Commerce passed version</a></p>
<p>I would be interested in knowing how this bill saves $100 billion over the version reported out by Education and Labor <a target="_blank" href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/07/house-tri-committee-health-care-bill.html">House Tri-Committee Health Care Bill</a>. First thing of note is that the new Energy and Commerce version is the exact same page length as the older version suggesting that the changes were mostly in the formulas and not so much the structure.</p>
<p>CBO has not released a score, when it does I will update. </p>
<p>(Update: in comments Movie Guy suggest using some file path information that this is not in fact the final form of the bill. Well maybe, but it is the only one linked from the Energy and Commerce page that shows the activity undertaken on Friday the 31st. Which leaves the question of why all the amendments and the results of their votes are listed and not the bill as approved. <br />http://energycommerce.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&#038;view=article&#038;id=1722:hr-3200-americas-affordable-health-choices-act-of-2009-markup-day-5&#038;catid=141:full-committee&#038;Itemid=85<br />Anyone who can shed light on this please put something in comments.)</p>
