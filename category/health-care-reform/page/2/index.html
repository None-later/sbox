<p>Congress has passed a ten month patch of the sustainable growth rate (SGR) formula by which Medicare reimburses physicians. I have lost count, but I believe that is the 11th or 12th year since creation of the formula which has never been put into full effect, being always subject to a short-term patch.<br />    <br />If the cumulative impact of SGR were to go into effect the cuts in reimbursements would average about 30%.     </p>
<p>Clearly, we need a permanent fix. We need Medicare reform. Clearly, a fix or reform are not likely anytime soon.<br />     <br />Tom aka Rusty Rustbelt</p>

<p>Health Care Thoughts: Evidence Based Medicine</p>
<p>  Evidence based medicine is one of the center pieces of PPACA (Obamacare) and is generally viewed as THE enlightened way to practice medicine and to direct dollars more effectively.  Problem is, there is a &#8220;whose ox just got gored&#8221; issue.</p>
<p>  The American Psychiatric Association is currently revising guidelines for autism spectrum diagnoses, and early research indicates some high cognition youngsters may have their diagnosis dropped or altered. This could result in an alteration or loss of services (caveat: it is very early in the process).</p>
<p>  It has been suggested over the past couple of decades the diagnosis was expanded, perhaps past the bounds of science, as parents scrambled and pleaded for help.  Parents and educators are concerned. What parent can blame them? <br /><a name="more"></a>In 2009 new recommendations were published for breast cancer treatment and there was a firestorm of criticism. Breast cancer is an emotional topic (justifiably so).</p>
<p>We tend to associate less treatment with neglect or negligence.  </p>
<p>But, if we are to follow evidence based medicine then we have to go with evidence. Right?  Many difficult decisions lie ahead.  (My own physician has cut back testing at my annual physical based on new guidelines, so I have a personal stake in this.)</p>
<p>  PS: New guidelines on bone densiometry (osteoporosis test) are coming soon and will probably indicate less testing for women once a baseline is established.</p>

</p>
<blockquote><p>To describe the unifying theme running through these past variants, it is helpful to enumerate the major economic functions any health system must perform:
<ol>
<li>Producing health-care goods and services. </li>
<li>Financing health care, which involves extracting money from households (which ultimately pay for all of health care) and funneling it to the producers of health care, usually through the books of private or public health insurers. </li>
<li>Risk pooling by private or public insurers to protect individuals from the financial inroads of high medical bills through insurance policies. </li>
<li>In most modern societies, assuring that every member of society has timely access to a defined set of health-care benefits. </li>
<li>Purchasing medical treatments from the producers of health care, which includes determining the prices to be paid, claims processing for insured patients and controlling overall spending and the quality of that care with various forms of controls lumped together under the generic label “managed care.” </li>
<li>Regulating the behavior of the various participants in the system to preserve the integrity of health care markets and the safety of health-care products and services.</li>
</ol>
<p>Most of the debate over health policy in this country has been over two questions.</p>
<p>First, to what extent should healthier or wealthier members of society be asked to subsidize the health care received by their poorer or sicker fellow Americans? Second, influenced by the answer to the first question, who should perform the functions listed above: government, private nonprofit entities or for-profit entities?</p>

<p>American v. Brazilian Healthcare, a Continuing Series</p>
<p>I spoke to my sister on Skype last night.  She&#8217;s been in Natal, in Northeastern Brazil, for the past few months.   Last week, she noticed a couple small warts growing on her leg.  So she wandered down to a government run hospital and and had them removed.  The hospital was low on supplies, and the doctor asked her to contribute a box of Q-tips (since Q-tips would be needed in the procedure).  The total cost of the whole thing:  12 reais, or about $6.60 American, plus a box of Q-tips.  </p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t the first time I&#8217;ve had a post that dealt with my sister and the Brazilian health care system.  A few years ago I wrote about the time she had <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2007/12/american-medical-system-one-persons.html">emergency open heart surgery</a> in Brazil, and how it compared very favorably with her experience with (planned) open heart surgery in the US.  <br /><a name="more"></a><br />Now, on the subject of the US, my wife also has an interesting healthcare story to relate.  She got a letter from Aetna, her insurance provider, indicating they didn&#8217;t know why they were being asked to pay for services when she doesn&#8217;t have health insurance through them.  Interestingly enough, money is withdrawn from our bank account each month to pay for her health insurance, and a call to Aetna indicated that she did, in fact, have health insurance.  A number of phone calls back and forth between my wife, Aetna, and her doctor resolved the issue (I think) &#8211; the doctor is being paid, etc.  But it isn&#8217;t the first time this has happened, and it serves to follow up our family&#8217;s <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/09/health-insurance-american-style.html">earlier experience with health insurance</a>.  All told, I would estimate my wife and I have spent about 40 hours &#8211; that would be a workweek &#8211; dealing with health insurance since July.  </p>
<p>Brazil is a poor country, and I don&#8217;t think anyone has ever suggested that the Brazilian health system is the best in the world.  On the other hand, we often hear precisely that about the American system from certain circles, despite the astounding cost (which doesn&#8217;t seem to include the waste of time dealing with the paperwork or fighting with health insurance companies) and ho-hum outcomes.  I&#8217;m starting to think a lot of Americans are absolutely insane.  Lord knows it would explain a lot.</p>

                                <p>There is a amazing piece in Forbes that Tim Worstall (also at Forbes) notes reporting on scary news that is misleading:</p>
<blockquote><p>I’m very confused by this piece from fellow Forbes contributor <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/rickungar/2011/12/02/the-bomb-buried-in-obamacare-explodes-today-halleluja/">Rick Ungar</a>. He tells us that there’s a bomb buried in Obamacare (or more formally, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act) and that it’s just gone off. Further, that it will mean the end of private, for profit, health care insurance on any large scale: whatever remains will be just a luxury item for those who like to beat the queues as such insurance is in the UK where we have the NHS.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/">Angry Bear&#8217;s Bruce Webb</a> noted the MLR in the legislation on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2009/07/hr3200-sec-116-golden-bullet-or-smoking.html%22">July 28, 2009</a> (and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/01/mlr-provisions-kick-in-today.html">here </a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2009/12/medical-loss-ratio-revisited-cost-and.html">here</a>), among the first to offer analysis, but hardly a surprise now.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />Tim [edited for clarity] quotes Ungar and then refutes:
</p>
<blockquote><blockquote>That would be the provision of the law, called the medical loss ratio, that requires health insurance companies to spend 80% of the consumers’ premium dollars they collect—85% for large group insurers—on actual medical care rather than overhead, marketing expenses and profit. Failure on the part of insurers to meet this requirement will result in the insurers having to send their customers a rebate check representing the amount in which they underspend on actual medical care.
<p>This is the true ‘bomb’ contained in Obamacare and the one item that will have more impact on the future of how medical care is paid for in this country than anything we’ve seen in quite some time. Indeed, it is this aspect of the law that represents the true ‘death panel’ found in Obamacare—but not one that is going to lead to the death of American consumers. Rather, the medical loss ratio will, ultimately, lead to the death of large parts of the private, for-profit health insurance industry.</p>
<p>Why? Because there is absolutely no way for-profit health insurers are going to be able to learn how to get by and still make a profit while being forced to spend at least 80 percent of their receipts providing their customers with the coverage for which they paid.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What confuses me here is that in a competitive market it’s entirely normal for an insurer to have a loss ratio higher than 80%. There are plenty of entirely profitable and growing insurance companies that have loss ratios over 100%. So I cannot really understand why the law insisting on an MLR of 80% (or 85% in the large group market) is going to cause all for profit insurance companies to fall over.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now of course one wonders what is important in addition to this scarey announcement of a medical cost bomb? Issues of accounting for expenses, a more recent mlr formula that is more permissive, enforcement issues.  And even why the ratios may be central as a part of the legislation. Another post of course.</p>

<p>Accountable care organizations (ACOs) are the keystone of PPACA  (Obamacare) as far as restraining costs and improving quality.    <br />Early this year there was great excitement about ACOs in the provider community, but the publication of the (first phase) Medicare ACO rules threw cold water on everything.    <br />The rules were at best complicated and convoluted and providers ran for the hills. The administration tried calming the fleeing providers with fast track and modified programs, without much success.    <br />On October 20th the Obama administration published revised Medicare ACO rules. Most of us are still reading and analyzing, but the early response seems more favorable. A more detailed analysis will follow soon.    <br />The administration finally got smarter and announced modifications to antitrust policy so Obama&#8217;s DOJ would not be wrecking the work of Obama&#8217;s DHHS.    <br />Bad news though, employers and insurers see the possibility of intense ACO activity as anti-competitive.      <br />Tom aka Rusty Rustbelt</p>

<p>Super Committee and GME funding</p>
<p>SO, about that super committee. Surely you remember,  the gang of 12 that was created by the showdown over the debt ceiling this summer.  Well, they’re hard at work but among the proposals out there, is one that is causing some grave concerns. </p>
<p>As a health workforce researcher, I understand implicitly the difficulties that lie ahead and the underlying shortage of physicians that will worsen dramatically by 2025. Current estimates suggest a shortage of over a 130,000 physicians by that time.  Many, if not most, do not realize that physician training, at least the post graduate residency phase, is paid for by CMS (Center for Medicare Services). </p>
<p>Currently, as we all know, if the super committee does nothing, there will be an across the board 2% cut to all federal discretionary spending. Some of the other proposals are a little more concerning.  In 2010, direct GME expenses totaled 9.5 billion. IME or Indirect Medical Education expenses totaled an additional 6 billion. <br />IME represents an additional 5.5 % payment to teaching hospitals, as it is understood that they not only teach other health professionals, but that there may be extra costs associated with education. Current proposals are to cut that rate in half (first proposed by Simpson-Bowles) to 2.2%.  Among other proposals which include Home Health Co-Pays, SNF (skilled nursing facility) shared payments, raising Medicare eligibility to the age of 67, lies a proposal by the House Ways and Means Committee to cut GME funding by 15 billion over the next ten years, or a 15.7% cut. It is unknown at this time if the Committee will pursue this, but this is problematic.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />Adding to the problem is the current GME Cap placed in effect in 1997, when several organizations were predicting an oversupply of physicians.  This is not our current concern. This cap is problematic, and with the current budgetary concerns has no chance of changing. By 2015, we will have had over a 30% increase in medical school graduates from 2000. There is significant concern that also by 2015, we will not have enough GME residency slots for all US graduates, without even mentioning the several thousand US citizens who go to foreign medical schools every year. </p>
<p>States have already reduced the amount of money in the GME system, with only 41 states participating, and contributing a little over 3 billion annually. Nine additional states are now likely to opt out as well. </p>
<p>We need a serious look at discretionary spending, but this will only compound and weaken an already distressed healthcare system.  I hope that the Super Committee strongly considers this, and looks to other alternatives.</p>

<p>Free market mechanics and healthcare…</strong></p>
<p>Now, I hear something all the time in my work in the health policy realm, and that is that the “free market” could lower prices. </p>
<p>I even recently had someone approach me after I mentioned that the PPACA had resulted in an extra million people aged 18-25 having health coverage this year.  His statement? “That’s exactly the wrong direction, we need to have less people, far less people with health insurance.” I asked him his reasoning…of course, already knowing what his response would be. He reasoned that it would force people to compare prices, shop around, and would dramatically lower prices through the mythical, magical “free market”….</p>
<p>Of course, this ignores some rather real problems with this line of thinking.  For starters, healthcare does not behave like normal commodities for a variety of reasons. </p>
<p>To start with, healthcare does not lend itself to price comparisons, and comparison shopping. The high costs are often related to trauma and emergency care/hospitalizations. It is simply not practical to ask which hospital in the area offers the best rates on cardiac catheterizations while you are being rushed to the hospital in the midst of an MI.  <br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>This impracticality also lends itself to probably the biggest problem. That is irrational behavior.  Any of us who have taken even undergraduate economics remember the discussions of rational actors, and how prices were sensitive to rational behavior.  Much of health care involves emotionally charged, heated, and oftentimes difficult decisions. Most patients and families can hardly be expected to act in a rational fashion about receiving the news of a terrible diagnosis such as cancer.  Real world experience reveals this to be true. I wish I could count how many times I have presented various treatment options to patients, only to hear “Do whatever it takes”. </p>
<p>Hayek once wrote that spontaneous order was a result of market economies, and that it was “a more efficient allocation of societal resources than any design could achieve.” This of course, assumes rational behavior, and assumes that a market can be symmetric.</p>
<p>Because of this behavior, and because people view healthcare not as optional, but as a necessity, price elasticity scores generally trend around 0 or -1. This indicates an inelastic market. </p>
<p>Of course, the next time I have a 21 year old kid who comes in after a farm accident without insurance, and is badly injured, I’ll make sure to tell him that perhaps he should have shopped around.</p>

<p>&#8230;. to keep mom/dad alive.</p>
<p>Physicians and nurses often dread these conversations. Any of us who have been on the family side of this know how agonizing it can be.</p>
<p>And I know even mentioning this can cause a firestorm.</p>
<p>However, there are some unsettling issues raised by these conversations, issues that are a sort of third rail of health care (and no there are no proposed death panels).</p>
<p>First, does this attitude increase suffering? Many of the elderly have 4 &#8211; 10 major diagnosis (COPD, CHF, PAD, diabetes, a-fib, etc. etc.) and very little quality of life. Especially problematic is the ping-pong that often occurs between the hospital and the nursing home (families often see a transfer to the hospital as a magic bullet, physicians often give in).</p>
<p>Second, Medicare is paying for a great deal of hospital care that may have very little value.</p>
<p>No one wants the government making these decisions, but at some point the care is futile and often painful. Some patients and families deal with these issues well, others do not.</p>
<p>For my part, I have a health care POA, a living will, and everybody in the family knows the course of action I want in various situations. Ditto for Mrs. R. It is still tough though.</p>
