<p>There has been some discussion here and there about whether the HCR bills in place do enough for cost control. I think that this is the wrong question at the wrong time and points out a bigger issue in progressivism, that is what exactly is our project? Comment by me to this post by Ezra <a target="_blank" href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/ezra-klein/2009/12/siding_with_cost_control.html">Siding with Cost Control</a> under the fold. <a name="more"></a><br />
<blockquote>This is not a cost control bill and should never have been allowed to become one. This bill is by name and intent a bill focused on access and affordability which go hand in hand. The demand that the bill even be budget neutral was bad enough that it also had to hit selected and arbitrary spending targets was from a progressive perspective a regrettable compromise.</p>
<p>You have 50 million people with only limited access to what is by all measures an expensive service. You decide that almost everyone should have equal access to that service. But decide that on net it can&#8217;t actually cost any more than before, that all moneys need to come from within societal medical spending. Thank God we didn&#8217;t take that approach when it came time to establishing public education and libraries, when Massachusetts introduced public higher education did they insist on a surtax on Harvard tuition to pay for it?</p>
<p>Of course cost control is important and in the medium term absolutely vital, but particularly the Senate has been a little too eager to trade away access and affordability to achieve short term cost savings apparently indifferent to the fact that every additional percentage of the non-elderly population NOT covered is another 2 million people or so priced out of insurance.</p>
<p>I start from the position of Social Democratic Utilitarianism, decide where social and economic justice lies and then strive for the greatest good for greatest number solution that you can achieve through democratic means. But at least start from the goal and concede only what you have to. I mean who exactly signed us up for the Pretty Darned Good Society? Or the Near the Frontier? or the Modified Deal?</p>
<p>We have a 2074 page bill that does lots of stuff including some measures that I think will produce more cost control than people think. But somebody needs to keep an eye on the prize which is to deliver what other developed countries treat as a right, that is universal health care. If that ticks up the percentage of GDP spent on health care we can start working on cost from the other side of the equation, after we get the access issue settled.</p></blockquote>
<p> Of course it is both impossible and undesireable to simply divorce ends and means, there are a lot of things we would like to buy that simply are not affordable. For example I want an end to world hunger tomorrow, and I am sure there are little girls in public housing that desperately want a pony. Odds are neither of us are going to get our wish fulfilled immediately, or maybe ever. But that does not mean you don&#8217;t start from a goal.</p>
<p>And the opposition does this all the time. The modern Republican Party defines National Security as an absolute and is currently blasting any questioning of the cost of any particular component and still less any proposals that require that it be paid for to be nearly treasonous, even as they dismiss universal health coverage as some utopian dream never to be achieved. Yet when you put those two goals side by side universal health coverage is achievable in ways that universal national security is not and the stakes in terms of lives are much higher in the former case than the latter. Of course we want to prevent another 9/11, on the other hand in the eight years since about 15 people are reported to have died from lack of health insurance than died in that one-off event. EVERY YEAR. No we don&#8217;t have dramatic video footage of firemen rushing into  or people jumping off burning buildings but those people are just as dead.</p>
<p>The Republican Party has performed a neat trick, one that Neo-Liberals and &#8216;Realists&#8217; have fallen for completely. Divide spending into two categories: Spending we CAN&#8217;T afford. vs Spending we can&#8217;t NOT afford. And then stick all Great Society and New Deal programs in the first category, while placing all MIC (Military Industrial Complex) programs in the second. And then layer the first with &#8216;fiscal responsibility&#8217; and &#8216;intergenerational equity&#8217; and the latter with &#8216;patriotism&#8217; and &#8216;keeping our grandchildren safe&#8217; as if that kid was more exposed to a potential terrorist attack than illness and disease. I AM thinking of the children when I say they should have health care coverage and a quality education, yet those goals somehow get tossed on some utopian scrapheap.</p>
<p>The New Frontier and the Great Society were bold affirmations that we could do better, that we could reach for the Moon AND feed the children, yet somewhere along the way we fell hostage to the advice &#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t be prudent&#8221;. Well the hell with that.</p>

<p>What Has Been Accomplished; What Still Must Be Done</p>
<p>These days, many progressives are expressing deep disappointment with the health reform legislation now moving through Congress. Some suggest that some legislators made deals with lobbyists and let them write the bills. Others complain that both the subsidies and the penalties are too low. Still others don’t like the fact that states can “opt out” of the public insurance option, and decide not to offer Medicare E. Finally, many ask:<br />Why can’t everyone sign on for the public plan in 2013? Why do we have to wait until 2013? Why cn’t they roll out universal coverage next year?”</p>
<p>Normally, I would be among the first to critique the bills. By temperament and training, I’m both a skeptic and a critic. <br />But in this case, I think it is important to recognize that we cannot expect this first piece of health reform legislation to be anything but wildly imperfect. In fact, I’m impressed by the progress Washington has made in just ten months. I’ve been watching the struggle for health care reform since the early 1970s, and compared to what has happened over the past 39 years, this is mind -boggling. </p>
<p>I also believe that those who favor overhauling our health care system should send a strong signal to legislators: we support you for having come this far. We realize that you have three years to strengthen, change and refine the plan before rolling it out in 2013.</p>
<p>What Has Been Accomplished </p>
<p>What is astounding is that this Congress has made as much progress as it has. We may have a new administration in the White House, but we do not have a brand-new group on the Hill. The majority of our legislators are moderates; many are conservatives. Nevertheless, a sufficient number have found the will to stand up and back changes that would make health care affordable for millions of poor, working-class and middle-class Americans.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />For example, under the House bill,<a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1109/29046.html" target="_blank">a family of three making $32,000</a> a year would pay just $1,360 in annual premiums for good, comprehensive coverage; under the Senate Finance Committee bill, the same family would be asked to lay out only $2,013. Today, without reform, if that family tried to buy insurance, it would find that the average plan costs $13,500. For this household, the current legislation makes all of the difference.</p>
<p>Too often, the press suggests that such a family would be expected to pay $10,000 out-of-pocket to cover co-pays and deductibles. That just isn’t true. Even if the entire family were in an auto accident and racked up $200,000 in medical bills, at their income level, the House bill caps out-of-pocket expenses at $2,000 a year. Under the Senate Finance bill, the family would have to pay $4,000. Moreover, under both bills, there are no co-pays for primary care. Even private insurers cannot put a $25 dollar barrier between a family and preventive care. </p>
<p>Moving up the income ladder, a median-income household earning roughly $55,000 would pay premiums of $4,300 to $6,500—depending on whether the Senate Finance bill or the more generous House bill sets the terms. Without legislation, they too would face a $13,500 price tag &#8211;and that is if they could get a group rate. If they are buying insurance on their own, coverage could easily cost $16,000.</p>
<p>For self-employed workers, early retirees, and those who work for (or own) a small business; the legislation offers major savings. They will be able to buy coverage on the Insurance Exchange, where they would suddenly become part of a group—which makes their premiums much lower. Whether rich or poor, this is great news for anyone who works for himself, retired early (voluntarily or involuntarily), or is part of a small firm.</p>
<p>Granted, the legislation now on the table still doesn’t make insurance affordable for many Americans at the upper-edges of the middle-class–-or the upper-middle-class. They don’t qualify for subsidies. But, as I discuss below, the legislation does point the way to lowering their premiums. Before reform becomes a reality in 2013, I am convinced that this will happen, in part because it must. We can no longer ignore the waste, inefficiency and pure fraud in our health care system. There is absolutely no reason why we should pay so much more for health care than any other nation in the developed world.</p>
<p>And at least the current legislation protects these more affluent households from medical bankruptcy. No matter how much a family earns, they cannot be asked to pay more than $10,000, out of pocket, in a given year. For households that have savings and property to protect, this means that they don’t have to worry about being wiped out by a medical disaster. Even if you and your family are in that car accident that leads to $200,000 in doctors’ and hospitals bills, you will owe only $10,000. In that situation, doctors and hospitals will let you pay off your bills over time, because they know you can. You won’t be forced into bankruptcy court. This represents an enormous step forward.</p>
<p>In addition, under reform, private insurers will not be able to put a cap on how much they will pay out to you and your family, over the course of a year, or over a lifetime. If tragedy strikes and a child needs six or seven years of cancer treatments, your insurance will not “run out.” For some families, this one provision will mean the difference between being able to care for their child and financial ruin (coupled with the suspicion that, if they had just had more coverage, they might have been able to save their child.)</p>
<p>Moreover, in the very first year of reform, the public plan will offer less expensive, higher quality coverage to millions of Americans. Congressional Budget Office director Douglas Elmendorf disagrees. He has been spreading misinformation about the government plan. First he low-balls the number of Americans who will be eligible for the Insurance Exchange where they can choose between a public plan and private insurance. . He then asserts that only 20 percent of Exchange shoppers will choose the government plan while 80 percent will pick private insurance. Here Elmendorf pretends that he can read minds:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Elmendorf goes on to argue that despite the fact that its administrative costs will be far lower, the public plan will cost more than comprehensive private insurance. This theory is based on the unfounded assumption that very few people will select the public plan , coupled with speculation that the public plan will make no effort to control costs and utilization. This makes no sense; as reform legislation makes clear, part of the purpose of the public plan is to offer higher quality care for less. (In part two of his post, I will examine Elmendorf&#8217;s guesstimates in detail.)”</p></blockquote>
<p>For peculiar reasons that I don’t fully understand, progressives have been listening to Elmendorf’s numbers. They seem to forget his past: a student of the Dean of Conservative Economists. Elmendorf first made his mark in Washington by helping to quash the Clinton’s hopes for health care reform. <br />Finally, under the House and Senate reform bills, insurers will no longer be able to deny coverage, or charge a customer more, because of a pre-existing condition. If you have begun to take that idea for granted, keep in mind the Republican’s recent 11th hour proposal for reform “gives the insurance industry more leeway” as the Wall Street Journal put it yesterday (<a href="http://mediamatters.org/blog/200911030011" target="_blank">Media Matters for America blog</a> points out the disappearance of WSJ story; “GOP Health Bill Gives Insurers More Leeway” from the paper’s website sometime last night.) Under the Republican proposal, insurers would be able to take pre-existing conditions into consideration.</p>
<p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s “Fact Sheet” offers two examples illustrating just how easy it is for insurers to deny coverage today:</p>
<blockquote><p>Peggy Robertson: A Colorado mother of two who was denied health coverage because she had a c-section in 2006. The insurance company told her if she got “sterilized” she would be eligible for coverage.</p>
<p>Christina Turner: After being sexually assaulted in Florida, Christina Turner followed her doctor’s orders and took a month’s worth of anti-AIDS medication as a precautionary measure. She never developed an HIV infection. Months later, when shopping for new health insurance coverage, Ms. Turner was repeatedly denied coverage because of the precautionary treatment she received after being raped.</p></blockquote>
<p>In most states today, this could happen to anyone. I live in New York where we have community ratings and I don’t have to worry about pre-existing conditions. My employer provides excellent insurance, with no annual or lifetime caps, so the current reform legislation would probably have no immediate effect on my life. But, we all should recognize that the bills on the table would change the lives of millions of Americans, giving them the security that they don’t have today.</p>
<p>Progressives cannot let this opportunity slip through our fingers because we are so busy critiquing the legislation&#8211;and arguing with each other. <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB125727378900825913.html" target="_blank">Online WS Journal</a> reports that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has begun to warn that the Senate may not be able to complete the legislation by the end of this year.</p>
<p>Given all of the criticism he has faced, Reid could be losing heart. After all, Conservatives continue to argue that legislators like Reid will be punished at the polls. Congressmen who have been pushing for reform need our encouragement. Progressives should continue to make it clear that the majority of Americans want reform&#8211; and a public option&#8211; even if the legislation is far from perfect.</p>
<p>2010 is an election year. Fearful of losing, some Congressmen will begin to back away from change making it critical that broad reform legislation is passed this year. Over the next three years, it can be amended as the critical details are fleshed out. Anyone who thought that Congress would be able to overhaul a $2.6 trillion dollar industry with just one bill was, I submit, terribly naïve.</p>
<p>What Remains To Be Done In the Next Three Years </p>
<p>There is so much to be done and this is one reason why reform cannot be implemented until 2013:<br />&#8211; Congress must figure out how to regulate the private insurance industry. This will require enormous cunning. <br />&#8211; Reformers will have to find a way to stiffen the penalties for those who choose not to buy insurance, without alienating young, healthy voters. This is a job for a charismatic president. <br />&#8211; Legislators must map out how the Insurance Exchange will work. <br />&#8211; They also will need to come up with a formula that will adjust for risk if one plan winds up with a larger share of poor and sick customers. (Some fear that this will happen to the Public Plan, so this, too, is a crucial detail.) <br />&#8211; Finally, and perhaps most importantly, Medicare needs time to begin eliminating waste in the system—saving billions of health care dollars while simultaneously lifting the quality of care. In fact, while all eyes are focused on the legislation, Medicare already has begun putting its own house in order. </p>
<p>What many reformers don’t seem to understand is when the public plan begins to negotiate fees with providers in 2013, Medicare fees for some very expensive services will be significantly lower than they are today, while reimbursements to primary care doctors will be higher.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Medicare already has announced plans to cut fees for CT scans and MRIs next year, and has proposed trimming fees to cardiologist by 6 percent . Meanwhile, it would hike fees for primary care physicians by 4 percent. Congress has just 60 days to respond to the changes in reimbursements to doctors or they will automatically take effect January 1. Over the next three years, we can expect more changes in the fee schedule. And private insurers will follow Medicare’s lead.” </p></blockquote>
<p>As they have explained to the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC), they just want Medicare to provide political cover. In other words, in 2013 the public plan will be negotiating fees with providers in a very different, less expensive, and more rational context. <br />This is another reason why public plan premiums will be significantly lower than Congressional Budget Office (CBO) director Douglas Elmendorf suggests.</p>
<blockquote><p>Over the next three years, Medicare will be realigning financial incentives to reward preventive care and management of chronic diseases, while reducing payments for overly aggressive tests and treatments that have no proven benefit&#8211; and penalizing hospitals that don’t pay enough attention to medical errors. In the process, Medicare will be conserving health care dollars while protecting patients from needless risks. As President Obama has promised, Medicare cuts can make healthcare safer and more affordable for everyone—including the upper-middle class. Because most private insurers will mime Medicare’s efforts to reduce overpayment, the cost of care will come down for everyone.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Public Plan will incorporate Medicare’s reforms and it will have clout. Seven percent of Americans purchase their own insurance in the private sector market. Most of the seven percent are neither poor nor sick. If they were, they wouldn&#8217;t be able to buy insurance in the individual market.)( More than half of this group earn over $55,000. They will be able to go into the Exchange and sign up for the public plan. In addition, a large share of relatively young Americans (ages 25-34) are uninsured and relatively healthy. No one knows how many will choose the public plan; but since it will have much lower administrative costs than private sector plans, it will be less expensive and more attractive to younger Americans.</p>
<p>States will not opt out. It would be too difficult for politicians to try to explain to voters why they cannot have access to a government plan that will be able to offer comprehensive insurance for less.</p>
<p>In part 2 of this post, I will explain what Medicare is already doing to pave the way for a structural overhaul of our health care system, and why none of these cost-saving reforms need to be –or should be&#8211;spelled out in reform legislation.</p>

                                <p>Bob Somerby has been on a rant at <a target="_blank" href="http://dailyhowler.com/">The Daily Howler</a> that &#8220;liberals&#8221; do not understand the Stupak Amendment.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, claims he makes about Rachel Maddow and Keith Olbermann and their guests do not apply to Laurie Rubner.  At the Health Affairs blog, <a target="_blank" href="http://healthaffairs.org/blog/2009/11/16/health-reform-and-abortion-the-stupak-amendment-hurts-women/">Ms. Rubner is direct and to the point</a>:<br />
<blockquote>From the very beginning, a central tenet of health care reform was that no one would lose coverage they already have. That’s why so many women are outraged by the Stupak amendment to the health reform legislation recently passed by the House.  It goes against one of the fundamental tenets of health care reform: do not leave anyone worse off than they were before reform&#8230;.</p>
<p>The Stupak amendment extends the group of women ineligible for abortion coverage far beyond its current breadth. It is essentially a middle-class abortion ban. The exchange would offer coverage to many of the 17 million women ages 18–64 who are uninsured, along with the 5.7 million women who are now purchasing coverage in the individual market. In addition, small employers are also likely to purchase their health insurance through the exchange where they may find more affordable options. Because the majority of health insurance plans in the private insurance market currently include abortion, many women will lose coverage that they already have in an exchange where abortion coverage is not permitted.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Stupak Amendment is, among its other ills, <strong>not</strong> Pareto-optimal.</p>
<p>I wait—patiently, of course—for <a target="_blank" href="http://capitalgainsandgames.com/">Andrew Samwick</a> or <a target="_blank" href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/">Greg Mankiw</a> or even Sensible Centrist Economists such as <a target="_blank" href="http://delong.typepad.com/">Brad DeLong</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/">Mark Thoma</a> to denounce the Stupak Amendment as a violation of the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_welfare_theorem">First Welfare Theorem</a>.</p>

                                <p>Robert goes out on a limb and guesses that Lori Montgomery fell for (or is pushing) Republican spin in this article in the Washington Post<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/11/14/AR2009111402597.html?hpid=topnews">Report: Bill would reduce senior care<br />Medicare cuts approved by House may affect access to providers</a></p>
<blockquote><p>A plan to slash more than $500 billion from future Medicare spending &#8212; one of the biggest sources of funding for President Obama&#8217;s proposed overhaul of the nation&#8217;s health-care system &#8212; would sharply reduce benefits for some senior citizens and could jeopardize access to care for millions of others, according to a government evaluation released Saturday.</p>
<p>The report, requested by House Republicans, found that Medicare cuts contained in the health package approved by the House on Nov. 7 are likely to prove so costly to hospitals and nursing homes that they could stop taking Medicare altogether. </p>
<p>Congress could intervene to avoid such an outcome, but &#8220;so doing would likely result in significantly smaller actual savings&#8221; than is currently projected, according to the analysis by the chief actuary for the agency that administers Medicare and Medicaid.</p></blockquote>
<p>I have read <a target="_blank" href="http://republicans.waysandmeans.house.gov/UploadedFiles/OACT_Memorandum_on_Financial_Impact_of_H_R__3962__11-13-09_.pdf">the report </a>(warning pdf) &#8230; well actually up to the passage stressed by Republicans and Montgomery.  Montgomery&#8217;s article focuses on one paragraph deep in the report which begins &#8220;It is important to note that the estimated savings for one category of Medicare proposals may be unrealistic.&#8221;  That&#8217;s some serious digging.  </p>
<p>The paragraph goes on to discuss what seems to be new additional budgetary flimflam which is assuming that productivity in hospitals and nursing homes grows at the national average (measured productivity grows much more slowly and it doesn&#8217;t matter if  this is due to unmeasured improved quality of care).  That would be part of a large savings of $ 282 billion.  The report doesn&#8217;t describe what the savings would be if Medicare rates were adjusted to a reasonable forecast of productivity growth.</p>
<p>Now I had assumed that Medicare cuts other than eliminating the Medicare advantage boondoggle were reductions in money effectively given to hospitals (and nursing homes etc) so they could afford to take care of the uninsured.  Hospitals&#8217; budgets will be affected by increased health insurance coverage, both by the increases in the total fraction of people insured and the fraction of people with pre-existing conditions insured.  This means that the total effect on Hospitals&#8217; budgets can&#8217;t be calculated assuming only Medicare payment rates change.</p>
<p>Importantly, the Foster (the author) assumes that reduced Medicare payments will cause hospitals to choose to refuse Medicare patients and not drive Hospitals bankrupt.  It is true that relatively lower Medicare rates will cause more hospitals to refuse Medicare patients.  How many currently do?  I googled <br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.it/search?hl=en&#038;safe=off&#038;q=%22hospitals+which+refuse+medicare%22&#038;btnG=Search&#038;aq=f&#038;oq=">&#8220;hospitals which refuse medicare&#8221;</a> I got links to articles about physicians who refuse Medicare patients and <a target="_blank" href="http://forums.poz.com/index.php?topic=15113.0;wap2">this link</a> to someone who works at a hospital where they talked about refusing Medicare patients.</p>
<p>Medicare rates are already low.  There sure don&#8217;t seem to be many hospitals which refuse to treat Medicare patients.  </p>
<p>OK so I tried the past tense and googled <a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.it/search?hl=en&#038;source=hp&#038;q=%22hospital+did+not+accept+medicare%22&#038;btnG=Google+Search&#038;aq=f&#038;oq=">&#8220;hospital did not accept medicare&#8221;</a><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://forums.obgyn.net/womens-health/WHF.9808/0665.html">This link to someone who says an anonymous hospital told her in 1998 that they didn&#8217;t accept Medicare patients.</a></p>
<p>Quite frankly this doesn&#8217;t seem to be a huge problem.  The idea that it will get even bigger if Medicare rates fall further below other rates doesn&#8217;t seem to me to merit page 1 treatment.</p>
<p>I think Foster is saying that he believes that the new restrictions on Medicare compensation will be waived just as the existing restrictions are waived.  He can&#8217;t say that Congress is flimflamming so he has to explain how this might be a natural response to unforeseen events in the future. My current guess is that the event will be the perfectly foreseeable complaints from hospitals and nursing homes and that the forecast that Congress will waive the rule is the only forecast a responsible actuary can make.  </p>
<p>The Republican/Montgomery/www.washingtonpost.com headline guy spin that elderly people will be denied care if the bill passes is absurd.  If that&#8217;s the way things worked, the 1997 rule wouldn&#8217;t be waived year after year.</p>
<p>There don&#8217;t seem to be many reports of hospitals refusing Medicaid either.<br />No google hits for &#8220;hospital refuses medicaid&#8221; one for <a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.it/search?hl=en&#038;safe=off&#038;q=%22hospital+refused+medicaid%22&#038;btnG=Search&#038;aq=f&#038;oq=">&#8220;hospital refused medicaid&#8221;</a>  to <a href="http://209.85.135.132/search?q=cache:ERTPt2Vg9R8J:www.ncpa.org/email/State_HC_Reform_6-8-07.pdf+%22hospital+refused+medicaid%22&#038;cd=1&#038;hl=en&#038;ct=clnk&#038;gl=it&#038;lr=lang_en">a publication </a>of the National Center for Policy Analysis. Hmmm, where have I heard of that? <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/18/politics/18bartlett.html?_r=1"> It&#8217;s the so called think tank which fired Bruce Bartlett for heresy</a>.  </p>
<p>The document to which I link asserts that Veterans care is queue rationed and that the veterans administration does provide as high quality care as that available to people with private insurance.  Non ideological sources rate the veterans administration as the best care provider &#8212; number one.</p>
<p>I think that &#8220;Hospitals will refuse Medicare and/or Medicaid&#8221; is a serious policy concern on a level similar to the &#8220;tax cuts cause increased revenues.&#8221;  And here it is on the front page of www.washingtonpost.com.</p>
<p>Update:  Note I am writing about <strong>hospitals</strong> who refuse Medicare not doctors in private practice who refuse Medicare.  My googling and questions were on <strong>hospitals</strong> which refuse medicare and/or medicaid.  Of the first 7 comments, 5 discussed office based practices which refuse medicare.  By my count letters &#8220;hospital&#8221; appear in that order 18 (eighteen) times in the post (sometimes followed immediately by an s).  Somehow commenters seem to have overlooked all 18 (eighteen) of them.  </p>
<p>This is not a quibble. The provision of the bill which Foster suspects will not be actually applied concerns &#8220;institutional&#8221; providers of health care not physicians in private practice.  I quote from his report </p>
<blockquote><p>H.R. 3962 would introduce permanent annual productivity adjustments to price updates for <strong>institutional</strong> providers (such as acute car <strong>hospitals</strong>, skilled <strong>nursing facilities</strong>, and home health <strong>agencies</strong>) using a 10-year moving average of economy-wide productivity gains.  [skip] end participation in the program (possibly jeopardizing access to care for beneficiaries).  </p></blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s why I asked about Hospitals refusing medicare patients.  There is a big difference between squeezing the entities which can&#8217;t be squeezed and squeezing those which can be squeezed (provided they are getting a lot more money due to increased insurance coverage so they won&#8217;t go bankrupt).</p>

<p>Much of the criticism about the House Health Care Bill coming from the left revolves around the &#8216;fact&#8217; that it has no meaningful premium and so profit controls. Moreover most of those same people are promoting HR676 as an alternative. Frankly those people simply haven&#8217;t read either bill with attention to detail. And this includes a lot of people sporting the title &#8216;Dr.&#8217;</p>
<p>In both cases the key language comes right up front. In HR3962 it is as follows:<br />
<blockquote>SEC. 102. ENSURING VALUE AND LOWER PREMIUMS. <br />(a) GROUP HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE.—Title XXVII of the Public Health Service Act is amended by inserting after section 2713 the following new section: <br />‘‘SEC. 2714. ENSURING VALUE AND LOWER PREMIUMS. <br />‘‘(a) IN GENERAL.—Each health insurance issuer that offers health insurance coverage in the small or large group market shall provide that for any plan year in which the coverage has a medical loss ratio below a level specified by the Secretary (but not less than 85 percent), the issuer shall provide in a manner specified by the Secretary for rebates to enrollees of the amount by which the issuer’s medical loss ratio is less than the level so specified. </p></blockquote>
<p>That final sentence simply guts the insurance companies current business which involves widening the spread between premium dollars collected and medical care actually provided. This sentence sets a hard limit on raising premiums while managing the risk pool to exclude those actually being likely to make claims. The tighter you manage your enrollment the harder it is to actually hit your mandated MLR, and every time you raise premiums you have to demonstrate that you have increased payouts to that same degree. Or else you have to rebate the difference.</p>
<p>In the original House Tri-Committee Bill this language was included in Sec. 116 and a site search on that term will pull up a series of posts on this dating back to July. And I have diaried on this elsewhere, yet somehow almost everyone has simply missed the significance of this. Or maybe I have overstated the case. If so explain it to me in comments. I will post a parallel post on the paragraphs that show HR676 to be a ridiculous piece of legislation, a case of a wolfish socialization program hidden in a Medicare for All sheep&#8217;s clothing, but for the moment I don&#8217;t want to distract from this key provision.</p>

                                <p>by Divorced one like Bush</p>
<p>Bruce Webb put up a post titled &#8220;<a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/10/health-care-exchange-eligibility-vs.html">Health Care Exchange: Eligibility vs. Enrollment</a>&#8220;.  I have gained some clarification on the subject and have shared it with Bruce.  I have asked him to comment also.</p>
<p>There is a concern as to whether access to the Public Option (PO) was limited.  Bruce&#8217;s reading of the bill was that everyone has access to the PO based on section 411(3) which reads:<br />
<blockquote>3) CONTRIBUTION IN LIEU OF COVERAGE.— <br />Beginning with Y2, if an employee declines such offer but otherwise obtains coverage in an Exchange- participating health benefits plan (other than by reason of being covered by family coverage as a spouse or dependent of the primary insured), the employer shall make a timely contribution to the Health Insurance Exchange with respect to each such employee in accordance with section 413.</p></blockquote>
<p>Thus, the PO is not as restricted as people thought and in the future the possibility is that it could grow and be what people are saying it would be; a force for controlling costs, especially regarding insurance premiums.  Sounds good, no?</p>
<p>My reading was that section 411(3) was tied in some way to whether your employer was &#8220;exchange eligible&#8221; or not.  There are provisions that would allow all employers in the future to be exchange eligible but it is dependent on a report or two being produced and then the &#8220;commissioner&#8221; acting on the report or congress acting on the report.  To me, this leaves too much political wiggle room.  </p>
<p>I think we both assumed that exchange eligible or not, if the employee chose the PO, the employer would have to pay for the choice by paying into the exchange, the result being that the cost to the employee would be the same regardless of what decision said employee makes.</p>
<p>Well, Bruce was correct.  Everyone has the option to choose the PO.  Though there is a financial barrier.  A big financial barrier that in my opinion makes this bill crap.  I&#8217;ll post my thoughts more on this later.</p>
<p>I contacted my congress person&#8217;s office.  They put me in touch with their legislative person.  I asked this person (via email) which of us were correct.  </p>
<p>Turns out, as noted, Bruce is correct that everyone has the option for the PO.  However, if you make this choice in lieu of  accepting one of the employer provided options you, my friend are on your own.  You are on your own and will have to accept the total cost of the PO plan because the payment your employer makes into the exchange does not follow you.</p>
<p>The reason given for such a set up in the house bill is that there is concern that the employers would push their employees into the exchange.  The legislative person noted that HR 3962 specifically is attempting to discourage this.  </p>
<p>This is the essential two responses by the legislative person:<br />
<blockquote>Any individual (but not any employer) can participate in the Exchange and therefore could sign up for the public option.  BUT, to do so, they would have to dis-enroll in their qualifying coverage and meet the other requirements necessary to participate in the Exchange.  However, there is zero incentive for anyone to do this since they’d be responsible for 100% of the cost of the care they chose in the Exchange.  If they stuck with their employer sponsored or other qualifying care, the vast majority of the cost of coverage is picked up by someone other than the individual.  That’s why so few people are projected to enter into the public option.  Additionally, access to the Exchange, and the public option, IS restricted for employers.  Only the smallest businesses can use it at first, and later slightly larger businesses.  The Secretary can then choose to open it up to all employers if she feels the Exchange has the capacity to handle that.  The goal is to do so.  </p></blockquote>
<p>I then asked: <em>411(3) notes that the employer has to make a contribution to the exchange following the rules of section 413 if the employee chooses to get health care via such.  How does this square with your statement that the employee would be 100% responsible for the cost of the exchange coverage?  Is the employer contribution not tied to their employee&#8217;s choice?  That is, the employer is just simply being charged as a participate in the over all exchange pool to provide the exchange money and thus the payment is not an offset of the cost incurred by the employee to purchase coverage from the exchange?</em><br />There response:<br />
<blockquote> Exactly—money does not follow the person in the House bill.  The Senate Finance bill does attempt to have the money the money follow the person I believe, but that gets complicated and provides a potential incentive for employers to try and push employees into the Exchange, which is expressly discouraged in HR 3269.  </p></blockquote>

<p>A lot of progressives insist that there is a simple golden-bullet solution to the health care crisis. All we need to do is substitute the 30 page HR676 Single Payer/Medicare For All bill for the 1990 page HR3962. Which led me to ask &#8220;How can you possibly supply code language to overhaul the U.S. health care system in 30 pages?&#8221; Well you don&#8217;t, HR676 is in bluntest terms a political joke. I provide a lengthy breakdown in this post at the Bruce Web <a target="_blank" href="http://bruceweb.blogspot.com/2009/11/hr676-political-fools-gold.html">HR676: Political Fools&#8217; Gold</a> and in the interest of space provide a severely abbreviated version here.</p>
<p>Provisions of the bill:<br />Universal coverage for all residents including undocumented workers. (Sec 101)<br />No out of pocket expenses for anyone. (Sec 102 (c) )<br />Benefits include unlimited medical, dental, vision, perscription drugs, substance abuse treatment, long term care all at no direct cost to the end user. (Sec 102 (a) )<br />For profit medicine made illegal. Including dentistry, optometric services, pharmacies, out patient or in patient care. (Sec 103)<br />Investor owned medical facilities to be converted to non-profit status within one year with the government paying for &#8220;&#8221;reasonable financial losses incurred as a result of the conversion from for-profit to non-profit status. &#8221; (Sec 103)<br />Private insurance for any benefit covered in the bill made illegal. (Sec 104)<br />Providers must either be salaried or paid on a set national schedule regardless of geographic variations. (Sec 202)<br />Costs will be covered by unspecified income taxes on the upper 5%, a &#8220;modest&#8221; payroll tax, and some tax on stock and bond transactions. (Sec 211)<br />All costs for construction and renovation of medical facilities to be paid for by the government (Sec 202)<br />Indian Health Service to be eliminated after five years. (Sec 401)<br />VA Hospital system potentially to be eliminated after ten years. (Sec 401)</p>
<p>It is pretty common for commenters on the Left to say that no one is proposing a government takeover of medical care on the model of the British National Health System. And they are right. This proposal goes far beyond that. There is not a single hysteric charge by the Limbaugh/Beck/Bachmann crowd that would not be supported by the text of this bill. With one exception, it doesn&#8217;t actually provide for death panels. But in every other respect this is a proposal for a communist-style health care system.</p>
<p>Think that is too strong? Well check out the bill as it is presented by its biggest supporter Physicians for a National Health Program.  http://www.pnhp.org/publications/united_states_national_health_care_act_hr_676.php</p>
<p>Let me add my urging to theirs: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pnhp.org/docs/nhi_bill_final1.pdf">Read the Text of H.R.676</a></p>
<p>Don&#8217;t let anyone tell you that this is just a case of opening Medicare to everybody, this is a root and branch transformation of the entire medical delivery system. Under this bill Perle Vision Centers and &#8220;your neighborhood Walgreens&#8221; become illegal operations. As it does any group owned clinic including in all likelihood your dentist. I mean who could afford to finance establishment of a new medical facility out of pocket with no outside investors?</p>
<p>The answer to the question in the title of my post? Blatant posturing for effect. No serious person would put forth a policy that at one and the same time provides unlimited free medical care for illegal immigrants and phases out a dedicated health care system for disabled veterans. Christ the campaign ads write themselves.</p>

<p>Well I have been venturing around the blogosphere and it is grievously clear that most people did not take my advice and <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/10/read-bill.html">Read the Bill!</a>. Well it is not too late: http://docs.house.gov/rules/health/111_ahcaa.pdf (3.3 MB) Moreover CBO followed up with their preliminary analysis:<br />http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/106xx/doc10688/hr3962Rangel.pdf</p>
<p>The above image is Table 2 and it shows the before (current law) and after numbers. There is a substantial amount of confusion on this with some people adding where instead they should be subtracting and I&#8217;ll have to admit while I got the arithmetic operation I mislabeled the results elsewhere. So lets sort it out.</p>
<p>Under current, pre-reform law CBO projected that by 2019 there would be 54 million uninsured American residents, which figure includes undocumented workers. Since under current political conditions it is impossible to extend real reform to include &#8220;illegals&#8221; any solution will be by nature incomplete. In the case at hand CBO projects that the House bill would extend coverage to 36 million residents leaving 18 million without insurance. Of that 18 million a third or 6 million will be &#8220;illegals&#8221; leaving 12 million legal non-elderly residents without coverage (some people have tried to add 18 + 12 to get to 30, going the wrong way down One Way Math Street). This 12 million number will include both the so-called &#8216;invincibles&#8217; who would rather pay the fine than get coverage as well as people who are Medicaid eligible but for whatever reasons can&#8217;t manage the paperwork labyrinth. But generally if you are a legal resident of the U.S. who wants insurance you will be able to get it. (Affordability is another question, I think the bill contains adequate provisions for that, others will have differing opinions, we can fight that out in comments or on subsequent posts).</p>
<p>In percentages that adds up to 94% of the total non-elderly population up from 81% today, while it is 96% of the legal non-elderly population, up from 83% today. Not exactly the Universal Single Coverage that people like me would like, but still closing roughly 75%  of the gap. Not bad considering the somewhat artificial restraints of both keeping the bill&#8217;s cost under $900 billion AND making it deficit neutral over the ten year window.</p>
<p>(Minor note. People are still referring to &#8216;HR3200&#8217; but as you can see the bill number has changed to &#8216;HR3962&#8217;</p>

                                <p>by divorced one like Bush</p>
<p>While your reading this, think about the physics concept of two things occupying the same time and space.  Think about the similar idea that light is both a wave and a particle.  Think about the message we have been told that many very bright people (like physicist) went to Wall Street.</p>
<p>During my lunch break I was watching C-span, the Senate.   My Senator, Mr. Whitehouse was speaking on the need to move on the extension for unemployment insurance.  Two comments were made.  First, that 7000 people per day are falling off the unemployment rolls since October eighth.  </p>
<p>Seven thousand people per day!  Got to wonder how many of these have no health insurance and thus will become a member of the forty four thousand group that dies because of no health insurance.</p>
<p>This brings up the second comment Senator Whitehouse made as a means of putting a face, a person, people into the economic equations.  There is a woman, a mother of 2 children in their early teens who has been unemployed for 13 months.  She is recovering from a heart attack.</p>
<p>Now, you do not have to take my word for this, but it is rather well understood that stress is a cause of heart disease, though stress is not selective.  It can cause havoc with just about any system of the body and it usually effects more than just one simply do to the fact that our body&#8217;s systems do not function in isolation to all the others.</p>
<p>So just what do you think is going to happen to this mother and her family if she falls off the unemployment rolls?  Does she no longer cost our society?  For those who argue that people think the public option or the real solution, a single payer system means &#8220;free&#8221;, I ask: Do you theorize that this mother and her family will no longer be an effect on your personal income when her unemployment stops and thus their life is free to you?  </p>
<p>Do you/we understand that this woman is the realization of two things occupying the same space and time, yet appearing as two different entities in the &#8220;science&#8221; of economics?  This woman and her family will not be free to us!  This woman will cost us regardless.  It is not, I am sure, this woman or I who thinks her life should be free (as in no money needed).  It&#8217;s only those who think this woman costing them is an inefficiency who think her life should be free.  They mistake the loss of risk do to the accumulation of money as free from cost.  </p>
<p>We all cost each other in some way.  Our goal should be to make efficient, every one in our economic system.  We should, at this time after having so many experiences with recessions/depressions, understand that the only true efficiency of an economic system is the efficiency of people&#8217;s lives.  The only way to efficiency is to reduce risk collectively.  But, instead we are still chasing the efficiency of money as in not having the health care cost bust a budget (but Ok&#8217;ing the war) or equating unemployment as costing us while we bail out Wall Street. </p>
<p>With all the bright people we are told that went from physics/mathematics to Wall Street, people who understand the ability for something to appear the same, yet different, that one thing can occupy two places at once yet have two things occupy the same space and time, how can they/we not understand that an economy is not and can not be discussed, manipulated or changed without a basic acceptance that it is one living and breathing, energy producing and expending entity?  It&#8217;s efficiency, as in the conservation of energy law is found in people, not money.  An economy&#8217;s efficiency is calculated by the accumulated reduction of risk, not increase in money.  Counting, manipulating, playing with the money is like playing with the energy and ignoring the matter.</p>
<p>This woman  Senator Whitehouse talked about and her situation is the phenomenon realized of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_everything">Theory of Everything</a> which Einstein went to his death trying to solve .  Einstein was working in the wrong science.  Had he been in economics he would have succeed in proving this Theory I believe.  But, if not him, then certainly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Forbes_Nash,_Jr.">John Nash</a> should be able to recognize such.  It is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_equilibrium">his theory</a> that takes into consideration everyone&#8217;s decisions.  We&#8217;re talking integration.  Systems.  Ecosystems, physiologic systems, physics, economic systems all described in mathematics.  Math, the thing those people on Wall Street and the Chicago School (or is it the lake school?)are suppose to actually understand.</p>
<p>For our mother in this story who has heart disease, the  real cure is not going to be found in health care.  For her, solving the health care insurance problem is only a stop gap measure which does not maximize the efficiency of her life such that her cost to us is as close to free as it can be.  To accomplish such, she needs money in hand.  Only money in hand can allow her the ability to make the type of decisions that will reduce her risk and thus cost to us.  Simultaneously, solving just the money in hand will not solve her health issues.  She is one entity in different economic time/space.  We can accept such or, we can keep ignoring the realm in which the solution to the Theory of Everything is found and keep treating economics as physics: A science with a mathematical dichotomy between the small and large. </p>
