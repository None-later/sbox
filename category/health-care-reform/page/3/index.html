                                <p>As Rusty presents his short &#8216;thoughts&#8217; on the administrative end of the national healthcare reform process, I noticed some readers have taken the problems he notes as indicative that the whole process is flawed and destructive.  I do believe that is a wrong tack to take and will not serve to learn more of what is happening in the process. The US public has only begun to take note of the growing necessity of deciding not only public spending but the huge costs to the current private system.  Changes are happening in that area as well.</p>
<p>The steadily increasing complexity of insurance billing and particular contracts with groups is simply bypassed in macro discussions but has profound effects on delivery of services and costs.  We glibly point to general &#8216;benefits&#8217; sections of insurance as the &#8216;worth&#8217; of plans and that justify the &#8216;premium&#8217; schedules&#8230;.not the real contracts on the other side of service delivery. Many general public discussions ignore the trends in the private sector. The overall costs of the system itself as the &#8216;cost curve&#8217; bends downward without much general scrutiny will impact more than the handy medicaid and elderly targets in the political discourse..   </p>
<p><strong>Health Care Thoughts:  Regulations Gone Wild</strong></p>
<p>My favorite nurse has been attending in-services and doing some computer seminars on long-term care nursing. She is not happy.<br />
<br /><a name="more"></a><br />
<br />She sat down the other evening and put together a list of 15 major regulatory driven changes in procedures and/or documentation. In reviewing the list, she determined that 2 or maybe 3 of the changes will improve the quality of care or the safety of residents.</p>
<p>So what about the rest?</p>
<p>She doubts that changing a 16 step process for administering sterile eye drops to an 18 step process will have much value. If she uses the 16 step process in the presence of a state or federal surveyor the facility would be cited for inadequate care, even though the care is perfect.</p>
<p>And the triplicate procedures for verifying narcotics are ever expanding into four and five step processes repeated multiple times each day (the DEA, having won the war on drugs, has been hounding nursing  homes on paperwork).</p>
<p>Keep in mind a nursing home has much more extensive documentation rules that even an acute care hospital, with less staff. </p>
<p>When business and professional people complain about federal regulations, many academics and left leaning politicians pooh-pooh them as greedy whiners, but in the real world there are real impacts of regulations, not all positive.</p>

<p>The Obama administration has published draft rules for the formation and operation of Affordable Insurance Exchanges, a key element in the PPACA (Obamacare) plan to increase insurance coverage.</p>
<p>There is a 75 day comment and then more time to digest the comments before final rules are issued. Implementation is due by January 1, 2014.</p>

                                <p>Yes, it&#8217;s another &#8220;AB was right&#8221; post. Detractors of this blog in general and me in particular <em>could</em> stop reading now.</p>
<p>But they shouldn&#8217;t. Anyone who thought through the economics could have pointed out <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/06/mckinsey-thought-experiment-what-if.html">what I did on the 17th</a>:<br />
<blockquote>From [Republican Congressman John] Boehner&#8217;s site:<br />
<blockquote>At least 30 percent of employers would gain economically from dropping coverage even if they completely compensated employees for the change through other benefit offerings or higher salaries.</p></blockquote>
<p>This should be intuitive. If the company is paying $1,000 a month for my family&#8217;s health care along with my $800 a month, it can raise my paycheck by $1,000 a month—employee compensation is employee compensation—and cut back on its health care administration. If I&#8217;m not a health-care administrator, it&#8217;s win-win.</p>
<p>Any economist worth her salt should know that lower costs of employment increase overall employment (assuming there is not a demand-side problem).</p>
<p>If the McKinsey &#8220;study&#8221; were accurate—again, not the way to bet—we should expect overall employment to <em>increase</em>&#8230;.</p>
<p>The follow-on effects in that universe: more people joining the HIEs than expected, improvements in the measurement of &#8220;real&#8221; wage growth, greater transparency in the current health-insurance system, and arguably a larger contingency of workers demanding something closer to a single-payer solution, all improve efficiency and provide opportunity for economic expansion.</p></blockquote>
<p>Or what Jonathan Cohn <a href="http://www.tnr.com/blog/jonathan-cohn/90696/healthcare-mckinsey-obama">wrote for the Kaiser Health Network and <em>The New Republic</em> a week later</a>:<br />
<blockquote>But here’s the irony: Most people like the insurance they get from their employers, which is why you hear politicians from both parties constantly promising to keep that coverage in place. In the long run, though, workplace-based insurance is probably not an arrangement worth preserving&#8230;.</p>
<p>An ideal health care system would&#8230;liberate employers from the responsibility of administering health benefits for workers, allowing them to concentrate on other, more productive activities. Let the car companies make cars and the grocery stores sell groceries and the software firms design software. They don’t need to be running health insurance plans, too.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve left out Cohn&#8217;s historically-illiterate paragraph about the groups of private health insurance, since he omits the main reason it developed: wage controls during wartime left employers looking for other ways to attract and keep workers.* At least he comes to the correct conclusion:<br />
<blockquote>A single-payer system, with a combination of basic government insurance and private supplemental coverage, would be a much better alternative. So would a “competition” system that looks like what is currently in place in the Netherlands or Switzerland, or what Senator Ron Wyden, D-Ore., first proposed back in 2007. The Affordable Care Act could evolve into such a system, particularly if the new insurance exchanges work well and workers feel comfortable the insurance available there is as good as what they’d get from employers. But that transition would probably take a lot of time, no matter what corporate officials were telling the survey-takers at McKinsey.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s not just a lot of time. It&#8217;s a lot of opportunity cost and underutilized human capital. And we <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2011/06/how-much-human-capital-are-we-pissing-away.html">have enough of that already</a>,** no?</p>
<p>Good to see the Mainstream catching up with AB.</p>
<p>*As an alternative history, consider that, if that industry hadn&#8217;t begun to develop during <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2011/06/eleanor-roosevelt-liveblogs-world-war-ii-june-28-1941.html">the War After the War to End All Wars</a>, the U.S. might have followed the same path as the United Kingdom and <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/Pages/HomePage.aspx">founded the National Health Service</a>, instead of leaving the country, almost sixty-five years later, trying to pretend that Barack Obama is <a href="http://www.nupge.ca/news_2004/n30no04c.htm">Tommy Douglas</a>.</p>
<p>**Yes, I would have found a way to link to this piece just for the title.

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>I&#8217;m not going to do this with graphics (at least for now), but the finger exercise seems intuitive.</p>
<p>Assume—<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2011/06/08/getting-insurance-work">against</a> <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/06/17/mckinseygate/">all</a> <a href="http://health.newamerica.net/blogposts/2011/questioning_the_mckinsey_study_someone_should_ask_bowen_garrett-53161">evidence</a>—that the &#8220;once we educated them, 30% said they would stop offering health insurance to their lowest-paid employees&#8221; study is <em>accurate</em>.</p>
<p>How does that, <a href="http://www.speaker.gov/Blog/?postid=245058">as John Boehner declares</a>, cost America jobs?</p>
<p>From Boehner&#8217;s site:<br />
<blockquote>At least 30 percent of employers would gain economically from dropping coverage even if they completely compensated employees for the change through other benefit offerings or higher salaries.</p></blockquote>
<p>This should be intuitive. If the company is paying $1,000 a month for my family&#8217;s health care along with my $800 a month,* it can raise my paycheck by $1,000 a month—employee compensation is employee compensation—<em>and</em> cut back on its health care administration. If I&#8217;m not a health-care administrator, it&#8217;s win-win.**<br />
<blockquote><strong>Aside</strong>: Reality <em>will</em> interfere. If we make the Baumolian assumption that cost of health insurance will continue to grow faster than GDP—at a slower rate, probably, but still faster—I&#8217;ll give you odds that the labor share of revenues will decline, <em>cet. par.</em> over time. But we&#8217;re talking about jobs, not profits.***</p></blockquote>
<p>Any economist worth her salt should know that lower costs of employment increase overall employment (assuming there is not a demand-side problem).</p>
<p>If the McKinsey &#8220;study&#8221; were accurate—again, not the way to bet—we should expect overall employment to <em>increase</em>. As with the <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Earned+Income+Tax+Credit&#038;hl=en&#038;as_sdt=1%2C33">Earned Income Tax Credit</a>, the expansion of HIEs will benefit firms, allowing them to reallocate capital into more useful areas.</p>
<p>The follow-on effects in that universe: more people joining the HIEs than expected, improvements in the measurement of &#8220;real&#8221; wage growth, greater transparency in the current health-insurance system, and arguably a larger contingency of workers demanding something closer to a single-payer solution,**** all improve efficiency and provide opportunity for economic expansion.</p>
<p>Which is supposed to mean more jobs, not fewer.</p>
<p>If the McKinsey presentation accurately reflects what companies will do given the opportunity—think the <a href="http://www.thirdworldtraveler.com/Corporate_Welfare/WalMart_Welfare.html">Wal-Mart Effect</a> Writ Large—then the prospects for employment will be, if anything, increased.</p>
<p>Greater political pressure for cost-reduction that leads to single-payer becoming more politically viable is just lagniappe.</p>
<p>*Not the real numbers, of course.</p>
<p>**If I&#8217;m a Benefits Coordinator, I don&#8217;t lose my job, and I get to spend more time working on ensuring that the firm is competitive in other areas. If I were doing an economic model of this against employment, I would bet that the coefficient would be small but positive, so let&#8217;s be generous and assume it&#8217;s equivalent to zero, i.e., no effect on employment supply.</p>
<p>As an aside, this was in part the reasoning behind the Bear Stearns &#8220;bag of rubber bands, box of paper clips, go buy all your own supplies&#8221; thinking. It didn&#8217;t necessarily save on corporate expenses directly, but it meant not having to manage that area of inventory.</p>
<p>***If anything, the extra profits, <em>cet. par.</em>, facilitate business expansion and more hiring. That the multiplier effect will not be 1:1 simply reflects what a poor social investment private corporations are.</p>
<p>****More people forced to use the HIEs=> more people demanding similar plans across state lines => more demand for a larger uniform baseline (especially as families move from state to state) => more interest in cost controls => greater need to control Administrative expenses => disequilibrium in service demand and supply => demand for service efficiencies that result in either single-payer or, at worst, unified Servicer processing.</p>

<p>Potentially heading off the shortfall of Medicare funding is the passage of the ACA which is used by the Trustees to forecast a positive projection to Medicare. Before healthcare reform, Medicare HI would run short of funds in 2016. After its passage, the Medicare Trustees forecasted Medicare HI funding lasting to 2024 if Healthcare Reform program implemented. Why is such a delay in insolvency possible? Elmendorf&#8217;s (the same Elmendorf who helped kill Hillary-Care) Congressional Budget Office forecasted a $950 billion generated over the next decade from the passage of healthcare reform. Two areas account for most of the savings and the third area could not be measured:<br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<blockquote><p><em>Medicare will be shaving annual increases in payments to hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, home health agencies and other institutions by 1 percent a year for 10 years. The legislation explicitly exempts doctors, calling for reductions &#8216;in payment updates for most Medical goods and services other than physicians’ services.&#8217; The CBO estimates that this provision will save $196 billion.</p>
<p>Secondly, the ACA raises another $750 billion, primarily by collecting new fees from the health care industry (which can afford the fees because it will have so many new customers); cutting overpayments to private insurers that are not delivering value for Medicare dollars; raising Medicare taxes for those at the very top of the income ladder; and reducing subsidies to hospitals that will no longer be absorbing the cost of caring for 32 million uninsured.</p>
<p>Additionally, The Affordable Care Act <strong>paves the way for Medicare to cut spending further</strong>, by proposing deep structural reforms that could, &#8216;transform&#8217; U.S. health care &#8216;in both the way that it is delivered and the manner in which it is financed.&#8217; The legislation &#8216;takes important steps in this direction by initiating programs of research into innovative payment and service delivery models,&#8217; the Trustees explain &#8216;such as <strong>accountable care organizations, patient-centered ‘medical homes,’ </strong>improvement in care coordination for individuals with multiple chronic health conditions, improvement in coordination of post-acute care, payment bundling, ‘pay for performance,’ and <strong>assistance for individuals in making informed health choices.</strong></p>
<p>It is the third point which was not included in Elmendorf’s projection of savings. By overhauling the healthcare delivery model, the Affordable Care Act through Medicare will reduce the healthcare industry cost inflationary cycle by changing how healthcare is delivered to patients and directly impacting the fees paid today. Instead of rewarding for volume of services delivered, the approach is to reward for value &#8220;by encouraging integrated, coordinated care that leads to better outcomes at a lower price. These are unprecedented reforms that have never been tried on a national scale (but have been implemented by the VA) which the <strong>CBO did not try to estimate just how much these structural reforms might save. As</strong> often is the case, over the long term what cannot be counted may count the most. Note that <strong>money saved from this change in services rendered will be above and beyond the $950 billion the CBO did score</strong>. These are dollars that could be used to cover the 2024 shortfall.&#8221; </em></p></blockquote>
<p>Without such a change in the delivery of healthcare, the cost spiral will continue. In Phillip Longman&#8217;s &#8220;The Best Care Anywhere,&#8221; the success achieved in healthcare delivery at the VA has not been rivaled anywhere in the private sector. In a fee for services scenario, the change does come at a loss of profitability when the switch is made to one based on better outcomes at lower costs. Phillips gives one hospital&#8217;s experiment in the private sector with integrating quality into its healthcare delivery:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Indeed, any health-care provider in the private sector that holds itself out as providing high-quality care for chronic conditions risks financial ruin. That’s a lesson Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan learned after it opened a new diabetic center in March 1999. To publicize the new venture, Beth Israel convinced a former Miss America, Nicole Johnson Baker, herself a diabetic, to pose for promotional pictures wearing her insulin pump. She also posed next to a man dressed as a giant foot, a dark reminder of how poorly managed diabetes often leads to amputation.</p>
<p>To avoid amputation and other dire outcomes, such as blindness and renal failure, the new center adopted a model of diabetic care that rivaled the VA’s in its quality. Highly coordinated teams taught patients how to check their blood sugar levels, count calories, and find the discipline to exercise, all while undergoing prolonged and careful monitoring. Within months, the center succeeded in getting the blood sugar levels of 60 percent of its patients under control — a stunning result that brought it national attention.</p>
<p>But the idealists who conceived this program forgot the business they were in. Health insurers would pay only piddling amounts to cover the cost of a diabetic patient seeing a podiatrist, for example, though such care is essential to reducing the risk of amputation. And insurers would pay even less same time, as word of the center’s excellence in diabetic care spread, patient volume increased by 20 percent a month. Soon the center was running a large deficit, and Beth Israel administrators felt compelled to shut it down. Between 1999 and 2006, three similar centers in New York folded based on the same model of care, and for the same reason. Quality doesn’t pay.</p>
<p>Any change in today’s healthcare delivery reducing the patient/client base and their need for medical services takes from the bottom line. The ACA under Medicare&#8217;s tutelage takes on fee for services directly and looks to change it to greater quality and better outcomes. If anything, the experiment at Beth Israel was successful for the patient/client base.<br /></em></p></blockquote>
<p>Maggie goes on to pick apart the arguments of the doomsday predictors and naysayers. Holding payment adjustments to a 2% yearly increase over a decade, Medicare will bank on expected productivity gains at hospitals, skilled nursing care facilities, etc. Comments of withdrawal from Medicare by providers and doctors are hollow threats (as doctors are exempted) as > than 50% of hospital revenue comes from Medicare. What hospital is going to withdraw? But, what types of productivity gains are implied?</p>
<p>Having supplies and equipment available on demand at the point of usage for nurses. If this does not sound like making CNC tools resident to the Cell, I don&#8217;t know what does. This cuts down on wasted movement.</p>
<p>· Proper inventory control to prevent the over buying of equipment by hospitals. One example cited a $20 million purchase of smart heart pumps over time because the inventory could not be found. Sounds familiar to industry also.</p>
<p>· By having accurate inventories and supplies at the point of usage, a nurse&#8217;s time is freed up from looking for supplies that are lost or missed placed and farther away from the patient. In the end a nurse&#8217;s time is spent as direct labor in delivering a product to the customer rather than Overhead and indirect labor.</p>
<p>· Fixing the mistakes and errors (most are preventable) being made in hospitals today through error proofing. An Office of the Inspector General, Department of Health and Human Services study found 1 in 7 Medicare patients suffer at least 1 adverse effect from hospitalization. This equates to 1.6 million per year and of that number ~180,000 die. The checklists used by pilots today before take- off could help hospitals and staff lower the incidence of mistakes in hospitals. <a href="http://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-06-09-00090.pdf"><em>http://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-06-09-00090.pdf</em></a> “Adverse Events in Hospitals: National Incidence Amongst Medicare Beneficiaries”</p>
<p><a href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/-APXuIkcb2NI/TfVDDlGhuBI/AAAAAAAAApg/kSddq7axFs4/s1600-h/clip_image004%25255B3%25255D.jpg"><img title="clip_image004" border="0" alt="clip_image004" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/-mOrrtVpYeY0/TfVDDx5rDzI/AAAAAAAAApk/2hrTXdRUNKQ/clip_image004_thumb.jpg?imgmax=800" width="244" height="180"></a></p>
<p>Each of these productivity gains has an impact on the costs of operation within a hospital, a direct impact on the quality of the product rendered, and ultimately reducing the amount of time spent in the hospital. While a large part of medical expense is Labor, another part is the ineffective use of resource, assets, and inventory. Looking for the root causes in the end Medicare costs decrease as hospitals become more efficient.</p>

<p><strong>Health Care Thoughts: Accountable Care &#8220;Smackdown&#8221; Part II</strong></p>
<p>While the feds were developing regulations for Medicare ACOs, both the feds and the American Hospital Association were developing cost numbers for ACO start-ups.</p>
<p>Today the AHA published its preliminary numbers, listing 23 major competencies to form and operate a hospital-based ACO (the AHA has been generally supportive of reform efforts, seeing a grim future).</p>
<p>The AHA costs estimates ranged from  600% and 1400% higher than the DHHS-CMS estimates. Both estimates are preliminary, but that is a huge difference. In my opinion (without deep analysis) the federal estimates have the substance of cotton candy.</p>
<p>On the list of 23 competencies, some were for formation only but most for formation and operations (my own list was 13 major competencies for on-going operations). The ACO is a very complex business model.</p>
<p>If ACOs do not fly, the major objectives of PPACA (Obamacare) will be difficult if not impossible to achieve.</p>

<p><strong>Much Ado About Not Much</strong> </p>
<p>The big legal news today was the first appellate-court oral argument, this afternoon, on the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act.  The argument—arguments, actually; two separate cases were argued separately—were to a three-judge panel of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, the regional federal appeals court for several mid-Atlantic and southern states, including Virginia.  </p>
<p>In one of the two cases argued today, Virginia’s Tea Party attorney general, Ken Cuccinelli, had sued on behalf of the state, challenging the constitutionality of the ACA in total and, jointly and severally, the individual-mandate provision providing for a civil fine for failure to obtain health insurance.  (OK, the use of the phrase “jointly and severally” is an inside joke among lawyer types; joint and several liability is a personal-injury-law term that means that each defendant found guilty of participating in causing the injury is liable individually for the whole amount of the monetary award if the other defendants can’t pay their fair share.)   The lower-court judge held that individual-mandate provision, but not the rest of the statute, unconstitutional, so the state appealed.  In the other case argued today, Liberty University and a few individuals challenged the law as unconstitutional on several grounds, including that, according to the university, the law would allow for federal funding of abortions. <br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>In the State of Virginia case, a threshold issue is whether the state has legal “standing” to challenge the constitutionality of the statute, ostensibly on behalf of its residents, since the statute doesn’t affect the rights of the state itself.  In the Liberty U. case, the federal-funding-of-abortions grounds for constitutional challenge is a non-starter, but at least the U. has standing to sue, since it’s an employer and parts of the ACA do affect employers, and the individuals who are suing along with the U. have standing because they’re, well, individuals and therefore subject to the individual-mandate provision.. </p>
<p>Anyway … all three panel members, selected randomly from among the members of that court, are Dem appointees, one a Clinton appointee, the other two Obama appointees.  The reports about the arguments can be summed up as: the panel will find that Virginia has not standing to sue to challenge the constitutionality of the law, and that the entire law, including the individual-mandate provision, is constitutional as “necessary and proper” (a term in the Constitution) legislation under Congress’s power to regulate commerce, a power specified in the Constitution.  </p>
<p>One of the Obama appointees, Andre Davis, said that under the Commerce clause, Congress has broad power to regulate national markets—something that the Court has held unremittingly since the 1930s—including the health insurance market.  The other two judges, Clinton appointee Diana Gribbon Motz and Obama appointee James A. Wynn, Jr., pointed out that regulating commerce includes regulating the effects of people’s decisions, individually or collectively, on commerce—on markets—and so, for Commerce clause purposes, if not independently, then at least via the necessary-and-proper clause, there is no distinction between the power to regulate “activity” and the power to regulate “inactivity.”  This undercuts the crux of the challengers’ claim, which is that there is a constitutionally significant distinction between regulation of “activity” and regulation of “inactivity.”  The judges kept pressing the Liberty U. lawyer to delineate a line between activity and inactivity, and to state whether a decision not to do something amounts to an action.  </p>
<p>Apparently, he failed the activity test, at least as far as this panel is concerned.  </p>
<p>Within the next few weeks, there will be three other appellate arguments, in other regional appeals courts, on the constitutionality of the ACA.  </p>
<p>And all of these, and the opinions these panels will write, are sideshows.  Normally, the persuasive strength of an appellate opinion in a case that clearly will be decided ultimately by the Supreme Court could matter, by persuading a justice or two or, in a high-profile case, by persuading the public and therefore, indirectly, a justice of two.</p>
<p>But these cases—this issue—has the feel of Bush v. Gore, at least in that each of the justices almost certainly already knows how he or she will vote.  I’ve said here earlier, and I’ll repeat it, that I think the swing vote in this case is Scalia, not Kennedy, and that because Scalia has boxed himself in, in earlier, relatively recent opinions, on the basic commerce-clause/necessary-and-proper clause questions at issue in the ACA litigation, he will vote to uphold the statute as constitutional. </p>
<p>I’ve also said, though, that I’m probably wrong.</p>

<p><strong>No Assumptions for a Change</strong></p>
<p>Assumptions are often incorrect and the assumptions are incredibly inaccurate in primary care and in basic health access. When one starts with the assumption of more pay, then it is easy to rationalize more training or more complexity of care &#8211; even when there is little evidence other than assumption.</p>
<p>Primary care is often more difficult than specialty care. <br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>A major reason is that the design of health care in the United States destroys primary care delivery. Reasons for primary care to be challenging are the complexity of the patients, the lack of support staff, the lack of primary care trained support staff, the lack of experienced support staff, the broad scope of primary care, the lack of respect for primary care by those who clearly have little clue regarding primary care delivery, and participating in smaller operations that are neglected by the health care design. </p>
<p>The fragmentation of care with even more fragmentation on the way is a problem. The required context of care includes major care provided by Americans most left out of the designs for health and education – who often cannot access care other than the basics. </p>
<p>The reimbursement for primary care that is less than the rapidly increasing cost of delivering primary care forces primary care practitioners to do additional efforts outside of primary care to support their primary care practices.</p>
<p>The decision to pay more for care other than primary care is arbitrary. This design was set up beginning 100 years ago by those who envisioned domination of all of health care and who assumed their superiority. Even in the 1940s medical leaders still understood the challenges facing generalists – because some generalists still were in leadership positions and other leaders had been generalists prior to their specialization. Once the entire context of selection, training, and practice support was designed subspecialist, this understanding was lost and the current assumptions reigned unchallenged. </p>
<p>The subspecialty and academic forces reached their domination in the last decades, rebounded from the managed care reforms with even greater domination – and the United States has all of the cost, quality, and access consequences now that cripple our nation and its people.</p>
<p>There is supporting evidence for primary care complexity as greater at the current time. This includes the fact that two-thirds of primary care graduates (28,000 from six sources) depart primary care. All types are departing primary care with 55 – 85% of graduates after graduation other than family medicine graduates (who have fewest other options).  There is lower national health spending on primary care (5% is all there is) and the locations where primary care workforce is highest percentage also receives lowest health care spending at 5% for rural locations and 5% for underserved locations. Established<br />primary care practitioners have continued to depart primary care even during the 1990s periods of increasing policy support (PA, IM), </p>
<p>Few that are found in direct patient care primary care delivery from nurse, advanced nursing, nurse practitioner, PA, and IM training. Pediatric and medicine pediatric training both now yield less than a majority for primary care as well. In all of these types as well as in family medicine, a minority fraction of the training is spent on primary care. Primary care basics are taught, but it takes a lifetime of dedication to patients and to primary care delivery to even begin to comprehend primary care. Compare primary care and specialty care after a decade of care delivery. Who is worth more &#8211; my vote is for a dedicated primary care practitioner in a continuity location with a continuity team? Perhaps many if not most would contest this, but most comparisons are apples and oranges as primary care is so poorly understood.Training that yields primary care as a side effect of specialty care is also apples and oranges as the RN, NP, PA, MD, and DO primary care should be primary care in selection, in training, and in a lifetime of care delivered. </p>
<p>The US needs a foundation of primary care – a balance between primary care and other care. The designs must support this. Even 80% of physicians support more funding for primary care delivery (Leigh) but when asked to give up a few percentage points of reimbursement (that might not even impair pay), physician support melted away.  </p>
<p>Once again I would note that nations need designs for care that serve nearly all in a nation nearly all of the years of their life in nearly all locations not a design that serves few for a few years in a few locations. </p>
<p>And there is always a nice video to review such as We&#8217;re Number 37 in health outcomes (www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVgOl3cETb4), not to mention a health care design that cripples our economy, all levels of government from schools to federal, our children, and our children&#8217;s children. </p>
<p>The current design ensures more graduates from NP, PA, DO, and MD with each passing year as well as higher percentages entering non-primary care as well as higher percentages of primary care graduates entering non-primary care. What we have is more like fantasy as compared to assumption.</p>

                                <blockquote><p>&#8220;The practice of medicine was accepted to be a chancy way to make a living, and nobody expected a doctor to get rich, least of all the doctors themselves.&#8221;  &#8211; Lewis Thomas, <em>The Youngest Science, </em>p. 4 (Penguin, 1995 edition, quote via Google Books) </p></blockquote>
<p>Lost in the discussion of Paul Ryan’s “plan” is the group of entrepreneurs that will be most harmed economically by enacting it: doctors—most especially general practitioners.</p>
<p>I was speaking with <a href="http://www.economicprincipals.com/" target="_blank">David Warsh</a> last week at Kauffman, and pointed out what “everyone knows” but no one will say: U.S. doctors net about twice as much money as doctors in the rest of the civilized world. (As a ballpark, $200K in the U.S. and $100K elsewhere.)  And until you can solve some of that, you won’t really make much of a dent in the High Cost of Medicine.  David noted that solving that “isn’t going to happen.”</p>
<p> <a name="more"></a>
<p>Paul Ryan’s plan is a large step toward making it happen—just not in the way David (or I) would have expected it to happen.</p>
<p>Let’s sidebar the usually Capitation v. Fee-for-Service discussion, which will only have an effect at the margin.  Assume that doctors net, say, $25 per patient (net of paying for office staff, supplies, waste disposal, etc.).[1]  If they schedule four patients per hour ($100)[2] for eight hours a day ($800) five days a week ($4,000) for a fifty-week year ($200,000), they make their salary.</p>
<p>Note the assumptions I made: the per-patient return is certainly variable (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_cost">standard MC/MR curve</a>), so the real return is based on volume and where that volume falls on the MC curve.  So long as a doctor can schedule to see 160 people a week—8,000 visits a year—they are continually busy and receive optimal returns.</p>
<p>But the market is not perfect.  I am of an age where a few visits a year is strongly suggested.  Tom or Rebecca, by contrast, go in once (if at all) and otherwise when they are unhealthy.[3]  It seems intuitive that, given search costs (think labor markets), a doctor’s practice is marginally more profitable with more repeat patients. Customer retention is therefore of enhanced value in the current equilibrium.[4]</p>
<p>But shifting the burden of payment while not capping insurance margins is also an easy first-order solution: fewer insured people, certainly; higher margins, probably (positive, maybe not significant), shifting of funds toward the sector that reduce overall consumption, and—inevitably—fewer doctor visits for the older and most likely to need care.</p>
<p>Note [4] above becomes relevant on the supply side; the relationship is weaker if still positive.  But the discretionary spending is reduced; Fee-for-Service fades except in the “concierge” segment of the market.  Capitation becomes the rule, and the model that has become prevalent—insurance companies guaranteeing doctors a salary—become the rule.</p>
<p>But visits to the doctor have declined, due to those most in need having the least ability to pay and therefore dropping off the insurance rolls.</p>
<p>So the insurance company doesn’t expect the doctor to make 8,000 separate treatments a year.  Or they do, but find at the end of the year that they were mistaken. The next year they offer to pay based not on 32 patients a day, but rather 30. And, given the frictions in the market, the majority of doctors agree, preferring the certainty of $187,500 a year to the risk of treating the uninsured, who are now a <em>much </em>riskier group.</p>
<p>And then the multiplier effect comes in.  Recall that there are fixed costs as well; doctors’s returns mirror the standard MC/MR curve.  So the actual loss begins gradually, but becomes steeper as the years go by—convexity effects appear.</p>
<p>Eventually, doctors have to right-size their practice. The current trend toward Vertical Integration may mitigate effects in the short term. But eventually—probably within 15 years, though it may take 20—doctors will find that their salaries (“net capitation fees”) are significantly closer to those of their European and Canadian peers.</p>
<p>Coincident to its effect on the poor and the elderly, Paul Ryan’s plan will speed the convergence of doctors’s salaries in the world.  The aspiring doctor in the Harvard Class of 2037 may well look at Lewis Thomas’s thoughts of one hundred years previous and say, “Nothing ever changes.”</p>
<p>The question that remains today is “What will we tell the doctors?”</p>
<p>[1]When I looked a few years ago, my doctor was paid $41 for my $125 office visit from insurance, and I had a $15 copay.  If you can’t figure out how $56 gross can become $25 net, go into a heavy-service industry, such as restaurants or doctoring, and look at their cash flows.</p>
<p>[2]Note that there is no inherent need to conform to the schedule, assuming the patients are not time-constrained.  That is, one can spend longer with patients—more than eight hours in a day—and maintain quality of care at the expense of leisure time.  This is a fairly simple equation and is left for when this isn’t a blog post.</p>
<p>[3]Again, the equation to show when the marginally-unhealthy choose to visit the doctor is left as an exercise. All we need for blog post purposes is to know that the choice is dependent on several factors, including disposable income and out-of-pocket cost.</p>
<p>[4]This is in no small part, at the margin, due to the support of the current Medicare/Medicaid system.</p>
<p>[5]Contracts still require both parties to consent, and the 6.6% decline is the net result—one might assume that some insurance companies will reduce their margins to pay doctors more.  One might also assume a pony with a pointy thing sticking out of its forehead with equal likelihood. There may well be a chimera of hope—though the scenario only extends the timeframe instead of ending the process—but it will not be sustainable, though it may be iterative (which would further attenuate the process).</p>

                                <p>Guest post by <strong>Michael Halasy</strong> Practicing Emergency Medicine PA, Health Policy Analyst, and Health Services Researcher</p>
<p><strong>Interstate Health Insurance Sales</strong></p>
<p>One of the more common ideas often thrown around in health policy is the idea of allowing patients to purchase health insurance across state lines. The idea of course, is to allow patients access to potentially cheaper policies, and that by increasing competition, lower rates will ensue. </p>
<p>While this does not sound like the worst idea, there are several problems with this concept, the first, and most obvious, being regulatory. Insurance plans are regulated by each state, and each state has a mandatory minimum coverage. State regulators have legal authority to oversee all insurance matters within their state boundaries, but do not have the authority to oversee out of state plans. If a patient were to purchase insurance in a neighboring state, and then have a grievance or complaint against that company, the patients legal recourse might be very limited. Additionally, if they buy plans that do not meet the minimum coverage requirements of their own state, are there potential legal problems? <br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>The second issue with this, is that it will create an adverse risk pooling. Out of state insurers will almost certainly offer plans to healthy, young individuals. This will leave in state insurers with a potentially sicker risk pool. What this will do is lower premiums potentially for one group of patients, but concurrently raise rates for a sicker group. Risk pooling, and spreading the risk through a group of patients is the backbone of health insurance, this could possibly interfere with this.</p>
<p>The final issue is fragmentation. In a system that is already badly fragmented, increased fragmentation reduces the leverage of insurers. In a BNET article in 2009, it was noted that the city of Milwaukee, with multiple insurers, and no dominant health insurer on the landscape, demonstrated that on average, providers would not accept less than 200% of Medicare as their reimbursement. Nearby Chicago however, with a dominant BC/BS insurance market demonstrates that on average, providers accepted 112% of Medicare as their reimbursement. The reason is simple. Leverage. Who has it? The insurers? Or, the providers? </p>
<p>Finally, perhaps the biggest issue with Interstate Health Insurance sales is that it fails to address rising costs. It will create a cost shifting onto sicker patients, and lower premiums for younger, healthier patients….but only temporarily. It will not address the continued, unsustainable rise in healthcare costs, and could create a regulatory nightmare.</p>
