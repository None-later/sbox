<blockquote>Government bureaucrats don&#8217;t reduce costs.  Market competition reduces costs.  The challenge for health care reform is to get the market competition into the places where we want it &#8212; providers and insurers competing to deliver better services at lower prices &#8212; and out of the places where we don&#8217;t want it &#8212; insurers competing to insure only the lowest risks and providers gaming the government reimbursement systems to earn the highest profits.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>Government might possibly keep [one] safe and therefore the billions wasted are money well-spent. [One] graciously permits the government to police [one&#8217;s] bar-hopping, repair the roads [one] drives on, clean [one&#8217;s] water and deliver it to [one&#8217;s] door, remove [one&#8217;s] bodily waste, treat it, and release it far from [one&#8217;s] view.</p>
<p>The government hauls away [one&#8217;s] garbage, keeps [one&#8217;s] lights on, pumps natural gas into [one&#8217;s] water heater, <em>for far less money than it would cost if [one] had to do it on [one&#8217;s] own</em>. It keeps food manufacturers from poisoning [one], and inspects the restaurants [one] visits, the buildings [one] lives and works in, the cars that whizz by [one] on the freeway. It created the internet [one] works on, and much of the medication and vaccines [from which one] has benefited. It educated most of the people who fix [one&#8217;s] dishwasher, [one&#8217;s] car, [one&#8217;s] hair, [one&#8217;s] dog. All of that is perfectly okay. But health care for people drowning in rising premiums?&#8230;[T]here the benefits must stop, there the line must be drawn.[emphasis mine]</p></blockquote>

                                <p>by Bruce Webb</p>
<p>For the last two months much of the talk around Health Care Reform has been about the Gang of Six of the Senate Finance Commitee to the point that some people think the Gang and the Committee are one and the same. But this is not true at all, this week Chairman Baucus will release the Chairman&#8217;s Mark, shaped as it is by contributions from other members of the Gang, and will be faced with getting it through the full Finance Committee, itself largely shut out from the process to date. So for at least the moment the math changes, instead of crafting a bill that could potentially get 60 votes in the full Senate, Baucus is now face with pushing a bill out of the Committee with majority support, which in this case means 12 of 23 votes. The following names are in Committee seniority order with members of the Sub-Committee on Health Care marked with an &#8216;H&#8217; and members of the Gang of Six marked with a &#8216;G&#8217;</p>
<p>Democrats<br />MAX BAUCUS, MT (G)<br />JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER IV, WV (H-Sub-Committee Chair)<br />KENT CONRAD, ND (G)<br />JEFF BINGAMAN, NM (G) (H)<br />JOHN F. KERRY, MA (H)<br />BLANCHE L. LINCOLN, AR (H)<br />RON WYDEN, OR (H)<br />CHARLES E. SCHUMER, NY (H)<br />DEBBIE STABENOW, MI (H)<br />MARIA CANTWELL, WA (H)<br />BILL NELSON, FL (H)<br />ROBERT MENENDEZ, NJ (H)<br />THOMAS CARPER, DE (H)</p>
<p>Republicans<br />CHUCK GRASSLEY, IA (G)<br />ORRIN G. HATCH, UT (H-Ranking Member)<br />OLYMPIA J. SNOWE, ME (G) (H)<br />JON KYL, AZ (H)<br />JIM BUNNING, KY (H)<br />MIKE CRAPO, ID (H)<br />PAT ROBERTS, KS <br />JOHN ENSIGN, NV (H)<br />MIKE ENZI, WY (G) (H)<br />JOHN CORNYN, TX  (H)</p>
<p>First thing to note is that Health is a big Sub-Committee that includes all but four members of the full Committee which might explain why Baucus chose to take it to a smaller group. But inspection of the list shows a curious thing, the Gang of Six managed to include three out of the four members who are NOT on the Finance Health Sub-Committee and so would include those people not committed enough to Health Care to even request a seat.</p>
<p>Second thing is that while Sub-Committee Ranking Member Hatch was originally included in what was then a Gang of Seven, he dropped out early, and Sub-Committee Chair Jay Rockefeller, the person you would expect a priori to have the biggest interest in this topic, was frozen out altogether. Nor did the Gang respect seniority, as noted it jumped over the number two Democrat on the full Committee roster in Rockefeller but also dipped deep on the Republican bench to pick up Enzi.</p>
<p>Third is the arithmetic. In order to get marked up legislation out of Committee Chairman Baucus needs twelve of twenty-three votes. We know from news reports that he has no support from nine Republicans, although he continues negotiation with the Gang of Six both Grassley and Enzi are on record that they will not vote for the final version. Which means that even if he retains the support of remaining Republican Gang member Snowe he needs the support of ten of the remaining Democrats to get to the magic number of twelve to achieve a majority. Without Snowe he can only afford to lose a single Democrat. Which at this point means the side-lined Chair of the Finance Subcommittee who the New Republic reports came out firmly against the Baucus Plan on Tuesday afternoon <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tnr.com/blog/the-treatment/breaking-rockefeller-says-no-way-support-baucus-bill-present-form">Breaking: Rockefeller Says &#8220;No Way&#8221; on Baucus Framework</a><br />
<blockquote>I have sat besides Max Baucus for 22 years on the Finance Committee. &#8230; I&#8217;m probably one of his best friend among Democrats. But I cannot agree with him on this bill. &#8230; There is no way in present form I will vote for it. Therefore, I will not vote for it unless it changes during the amendment process by vast amounts.</p></blockquote>
<p>Conventional wisdom was that the bill that would supply the framework for the bill on the Senate floor was going to be that of the Finance Committee and that moreover that bill would be fundamentally the work product of Baucus&#8217;s Gang of Six. But while Baucus asserts that the work of the Gang will continue, the fate of the bill over the next week will be determined by who can get twelve votes.</p>
<p>In a battle between full Committee Chair Baucus and Health Sub-Committee Chair Rockefeller who holds the strongest hand? We&#8217;ll see. But Rockefeller only needs to hold Kerry and Wyden to keep Baucus from an outright win, and one would think at a minimum he can hold Schumer and Stabenow, each of whom&#8217;s states look to be big winners from near universal health care.</p>
<p>My inbox tells me the Baucus Plan was just released so I expect to be back with some links and discussion. In the meanwhile: any early thoughts?</p>
<p>(Update one) SWEET. The NYT has the PDF of the Chairman&#8217;s mark in a navigable form on their site.<br />http://documents.nytimes.com/baucus-proposal-to-overhaul-health-care#p=1</p>

                                <p>Via a former editor&#8217;s Twitter feed, the Simon Fraser Institute decides <a target="_blank" href="http://www.windsorstar.com/health/Dollar+cost+Medicare/1991517/story.html">to segment the costs of Canadian health care</a>.  For the good of the people, of course:<br />
<blockquote>It is critically important, however, that Canadians understand the true cost of Medicare. Armed with a more meaningful estimate, Canadians will be able to better assess whether or not they are receiving value for their health care dollars.</p></blockquote>
<p>And what do they calculate as the direct Canadian cost for <em>everything</em>—not just insurance, but insurance, treatment, drugs, etc.—on average?<br />
<blockquote>&#8211; $9,572 for the average 2 adult family</p>
<p>&#8211; $9,855 for the average 2 adult and 1 child family</p>
<p>&#8211; $10,191 for the average 2 adult and 2 child family</p></blockquote>
<p>The lowest quote I can find for <em>insurance alone</em> is $950/month, or $11,400/year. And that&#8217;s before any visits, or shots, or treatments.</p>
<p>Tell me again why we can&#8217;t afford a government option?  And why the Simon Fraser Institute is getting to shill fear in the Windsor Star?</p>
<p>There were reasons for moving back to the States, but health care certainly isn&#8217;t one of them.</p>

<blockquote>Apparently, the American swing voter tends to think, &#8220;If I’m going to get screwed over, I want it to be by someone who is aggressive as possible about it.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s pretty much the summary of it.</p>
<p>Hint to Rahm Emmanuel: when you run a candidate with &#8220;I&#8217;m going to fix Health Insurance by adding a Public Option&#8221; at the center of his platform and then make it worse, do not be surprised when the voters decide that your candidate and His Party are not worth the trouble of voting.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Dr. Black <a target="_blank" href="http://www.eschatonblog.com/2009/09/not-quite.html">disagrees</a>.  This is the sad part of being trained to believe Rational Expectations theory. As with other forms of Early Indoctrination, leaving the Alliance doesn&#8217;t mean you leave the no-longer-explored assumptions.</p>

<p>(Update Sept 9. This post generated some heated objections from one or more people who thought it libelous. I don&#8217;t agree but have been urged to make the following point:</p>
<p>My posts on AB represent my own opinions and judgements and do not necessarily represent those of any other front page posters or the siteowner. There is no pre-publication review process at AB currently, if a post seems to cross a line the responsibility is with the front page poster, in this case me)</p>
<p>The Gang of Six is on life-support. Baucus released something unilaterally yesterday which suggests he is asking for buy-in to the plan or not in advance of a meeting Tuesday between Reid, Pelosi and Obama and the Wednesday night speech to a joint session of Congress. But before we pull the plug on the Gang I want to take a little time to show how artificial it all was, because you can be certain people will be up in arms about how the &#8216;bipartisan process&#8217; was bull-rushed by Obama.</p>
<p>Our first hint of &#8216;bipartisanship&#8217; came when Baucus announced he could not work off the basis of the HELP Bill but would start from scratch in Finance. Now the other four Committees mostly worked on the bill as a whole but Baucus thought it better to have a working group that originally totaled seven. Now there were three ways of devising this group that would respect Senate seniority rules and the party split. In a 60-40 Senate the closest split of seven is 4 to 3.</p>
<p>Update:  This piece is an op-ed and not to be construed as &#8216;reporting&#8217; as suggested by a reader&#8230;it is one interpretation of events during a very controversial time&#8230;rdan</p>
<p>Baucus could have just appointed the top seven of the whole Committee, this would have left a Gang looking like this:<br />D: Baucus, Rockefeller, Conrad, Bingaman to R: Grassley, Hatch, Snowe</p>
<p>Or he could have just appointed the top seven of the Sub-Committee on Health Care which would have produced this:<br />D: Rockefeller, Bingaman, Kerry, Lincoln R: Hatch, Snowe, Ensign</p>
<p>Since it doesn&#8217;t make much sense to craft a group that excludes both your Committee Chair and Ranking Member, it would have been natural for Baucus to create a blended group of leadership plus the top five on the Health Sub-Committee:<br />D: Baucus, Rockefeller, Bingaman, Kerry R: Grassley, Hatch Snowe</p>
<p>Any of these lineups would seem to meet the criteria for bipartisanship. In each case you have two conservative R&#8217;s and one moderate, all with reputations for deal-making. One model one the D side breaks down as three centrists and one liberal, one models two and three you have two liberals and two centrists. There should have been no trouble finding a bill acceptable to five or six of them, that is you might lose Ensign at one end or Kerry or Rockefeller at the other, but what came out would represent a consensus reflective of the whole Senate.</p>
<p>But Baucus did not choose any route that reflected a 60 &#8211; 40 split or respected seniority at all, instead he went originally with this Gang of Seven:<br />D: Baucus, Conrad, Bingaman R:Grassley, Hatch, Snowe, Enzi</p>
<p>Now not only do we have a 3 to 4 split in favor of the minority, the ideological breakdown is three conservatives to four moderates. There is only one logical explanation for Baucus&#8217;s move. He simply decided to side-line the Chairman of the Finance Committee Sub-Committee on Health, i.e. Rockefeller and liberals generally.</p>
<p>There was nothing bi-partisan or pertaining to regular order in creation of the Gang of Seven, now reduced to a Gang of Six. It was a naked power grab that has now apparently gone bad. No one should regret the passing of the Gang that Couldn&#8217;t Legislate Straight, they were never really legitimate to start with.</p>

<p>HOLD THE PRESSES.</p>
<p>I am deleting this post. It is not clear that the document posted on the Finance Committee website actually reflects Baucus&#8217;s new proposal. Why they chose to put an older document up this morning is a mystery. Until I get it figured out this will have to be a Emily Letilla moment: &#8220;Never mind!&#8221;</p>

<p>The current line of attack on Health Care reform from Republicans is that it proposes to Rob Gramma to Pay Pedro. I am not going to address the care for illegals canard today but do want to probe just what HR3200 does for Medicare on net. Starting from the following two charts from the Kaiser Family Foundation.<br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SqJrhiZPYTI/AAAAAAAAAS4/YZceLrKhyQc/s1600-h/Kaiser+Saving.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SqJrhiZPYTI/AAAAAAAAAS4/YZceLrKhyQc/s400/Kaiser+Saving.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SqJriGMjU7I/AAAAAAAAATA/rJRa8c0Eza8/s1600-h/Kaiser+Spending.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SqJriGMjU7I/AAAAAAAAATA/rJRa8c0Eza8/s400/Kaiser+Spending.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.kff.org/healthreform/upload/7948.pdf">Summary of Key Medicare Provisions in HR3200</a><br />The first chart reports the number proposed to be saved by changes in Medicare and displays the only number you are likely to see cited by opponents: $538.5 billion in cuts. But the second chart shows something interesting, these cuts are offset by an additional $320.4 billion in spending. Meaning that the net cut to Medicare overall is $218.1 billion over ten years. Which matches closely with the one shown in CBO&#8217;s $219 bn score shown here:<br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SmHMyMZ-lqI/AAAAAAAAARc/DMc-x5-_vUs/s1600-h/CBO+Jun+17+Tri-Comm+score.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SmHMyMZ-lqI/AAAAAAAAARc/DMc-x5-_vUs/s400/CBO+Jun+17+Tri-Comm+score.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/104xx/doc10464/hr3200.pdf</p>
<p>Still $218 billion over ten years is still something. But lets look at the breakdown. Of the $538.5 billion in cuts $172 billion of it is the result of removing the 15% extra payment per enrollee granted to the private insurance companies offering Medicare Advantage. This extra payment, which made a mockery of the idea that private companies could provide a better product for the same price, was originally designed to subvert traditional Medicare and is no real loss. If we subtract that $172 billion from $218 billion we get a net spending cut to traditional Medicare of $46 billion over ten years representing only a small fraction of the cost to extend coverage to 97% of legal non-elderly Americas.</p>
<p>So why are Republicans pushing this point so hard? Are they really concerned about the specific tradeoffs represented by the above two charts (because wihin Medicare there are winners and losers)? I think not, instead all their crocodile tears about Gramma are disguising real tears at the prospect of the outcome shown in the third row of the CBO table: the $583 billion in extra taxes on the top 1.5% over the next ten years.</p>
<p>Rule no 1 in evaluating Republican proposals and counter-proposals: it&#8217;s about the taxes first and foremost. They don&#8217;t like paying for services for the working class. Period.</p>

<p>DC and the blogosphere are all over the resurrection of the Public Option Trigger, the idea that with the right legislation the insurance companies would just straighten up and fly right. Most of the Left is pretty cynical about the idea and rightly so given the insurance companies several decade pattern on driving down what they call their &#8216;medical cost ratio&#8217;, i.e. the amount of your premium dollar actually spent on paying providers for medical care. Where that ratio used to be 95% now it is down to 80%, meaning that insurance companies are taking four times the share of your premium dollar than in the past. The question is whether you could craft legislation that would control overall premium costs in a way that would not pull the trigger? Well I think you can and in fact it has already been done. If you excised the public option what would be left in the bill to control costs? To start with Secs 111-116.<br />
<blockquote>Subtitle B—Standards Guaranteeing Access to Affordable Coverage </p>
<p>SEC. 111. PROHIBITING PRE-EXISTING CONDITION EXCLUSIONS. <br />A qualified health benefits plan may not impose any pre-existing condition exclusion (as defined in section 2701(b)(1)(A) of the Public Health Service Act) or otherwise impose any limit or condition on the coverage under the plan with respect to an individual or dependent based on any health status-related factors (as defined in section 2791(d)(9) of the Public Health Service Act) in relation to the individual or dependent. <br />SEC. 112. GUARANTEED ISSUE AND RENEWAL FOR INSURED PLANS.<br />(snip-the title of Sec 112 tells the story. Plus no recision except for fraud, as defined by the govt and not the insurance co.)<br />SEC. 113. INSURANCE RATING RULES. <br />(a) IN GENERAL.—The premium rate charged for an insured qualified health benefits plan may not vary except as follows: <br />(1) LIMITED AGE VARIATION PERMITTED.—By age (within such age categories as the Commissioner shall specify) so long as the ratio of the highest such premium to the lowest such premium does not exceed the ratio of 2 to 1. <br />(2) BY AREA.—By premium rating area (as permitted by State insurance regulators or, in the case of Exchange-participating health benefits plans, as specified by the Commissioner in consultation with such regulators). <br />(3) BY FAMILY ENROLLMENT.—By family enrollment (such as variations within categories and compositions of families) so long as the ratio of the premium for family enrollment (or enrollments) to the premium for individual enrollment is uniform, as <br />specified under State law and consistent with rules of the Commissioner. <br />(snip-rest of section calls for a study)<br />SEC. 114. NONDISCRIMINATION IN BENEFITS; PARITY IN MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE DISORDER BENEFITS. (self-explanatory)<br />SEC. 115. ENSURING ADEQUACY OF PROVIDER NETWORKS.<br />SEC. 116. ENSURING VALUE AND LOWER PREMIUMS. <br />(a) IN GENERAL.—A qualified health benefits plan shall meet a medical loss ratio as defined by the Commissioner. For any plan year in which the qualified health benefits plan does not meet such medical loss ratio, QHBP offering entity shall provide in a manner specified by the Commissioner for rebates to enrollees of payment sufficient to meet such loss ratio. <br />(b) BUILDING ON INTERIM RULES.—In implementing subsection (a), the Commissioner shall build on the definition and methodology developed by the Secretary of Health and Human Services under the amendments made by section 161 for determining how to calculate the medical loss ratio. Such methodology shall be set at the highest level medical loss ratio possible that is designed to ensure adequate participation by QHBP offering entities, competition in the health insurance market in and out of the Health Insurance Exchange, and value for consumers so that their premiums are used for services.</p></blockquote>
<p>This if enforced as a pretty strong combination, insurance companies have to take all comers without regard to physical or mental condition, charge each individual or family in the area the same rate, with a small exception of a 2-1 ratio between young and old. Additionally they can&#8217;t rescind the policy for any reason except non-payment or fraud as defined by statute, nor can they refuse to renew it. And most importantly they have to stay within a set medical-loss ratio.</p>
<p>Now clearly the weak point here is that medical loss ratio. Companies will have an interest in making the case that it just HAS to be set lower in each future year, and you can hear the stories now from both directions, companies crying poor while critics point out not so poor that they can&#8217;t afford First Class air travel. So what would a Trigger look like in this mix? Well it seems that it would have to be tied to a certain irreducible medical loss ratio. So we could imagine that the typical acceptable medical loss ratio was set at 95% for Year 1 with a Trigger set at 85%. Each year the companies could try to argue that they need to get a lower ratio and maybe make their case. But each step down gets them closer to Triggering the Public Option and so forces them to strive for efficiencies on the business side not related to denying care outright.</p>
<p>The model works. On paper anyway. The devil is in getting the initial Medical Loss Ratio right and not letting the trigger point get too low. I would still push for a Public Option which allows direct inspection of and competition between Medical Loss Ratios between public and private plans rather than some process of renegotiating them each contract renewal period. But it is not crazy to entertain the idea of a Trigger mechanism.</p>

<p>Both sides of the Health Care debate are looking and or calculating at the effects on future elections, will including a public option play in Peoria? This I think is to misunderstand the timelines because for most people the initial passage of reform really doesn&#8217;t change anything for the next two election cycles either for better or for worse. Now it may change some future expectations about what will or will not be possible after the real Day 1 of Year 1 (as defined in the bill) but not much before. Let&#8217;s review the putative timeline.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s assume the Health Care bill passes this year with a Public Option and an effective date of Jan 1, 2010. What happens?</p>
<p>Jan 2010. Obama nominates a Health Choices Commissioner who chances are is going to be a technocrat whose name nobody outside health care wonkery will even recognize. The name goes to the Senate and is sent to Committee. (Snooze)</p>
<p>Jan to Mar 2010. Obama tasked with appointing members of the Health Benefits Advisory Committee with representatives of all stakeholders. (More napping by public)</p>
<p>Mar to Dec 2010. HBA Comm meets to hammer out the details of the Essential Benefits Package. Since the broader outlines are firmly set in the bill the only chances for something dramatic will revolve around provisions about abortion. For everyone not obsessed by Pro-Life issues not much to seize on.</p>
<p>Jan 2011. HBA Comm delivers recommendation to now confirmed Health Choices Commissioner. Public opens eyes and realizes that the 2010 mid-terms came and went.</p>
<p>June 2011. Deadline for the Commissioner to get guidelines through comment and publication requirements. Ho-hum.</p>
<p>July 2011 to Dec 2012. Contract negotiation between insurance companies and the Commissioner, near the end of this period private companies and the public option are marketing their plans but not actually having them in effect.</p>
<p>Jan 2013. Insurance Exchange opens it doors and individuals and employers start exercising options. Hey wait, we already had the Presidential election!</p>
<p>But through this whole process nothing really changes for anyone. If you have good insurance you will have it, if you have crappy insurance you will have that, if you don&#8217;t have insurance you will still be out of luck though maybe counting the days and saving the pennies so you can buy into an Exchange elgible plan. What I don&#8217;t see is any galvanizing event for voters. In this scenario the details of the plan will be old-hat by Nov 2010 and nobody will have been forced into anything. And this is pretty much still true by Nov. 2012, any dire change due to the plan will still be theoretical. So why should Congressmen be scared about constituent reaction? Do they really believe people will continue to be stirred up by a done deal? Right now people are being agitated or getting agitated by something quite unknown to them. Once it is in the form of legislation signed by the President and in the hands of appointed bureaucrats I see all the steam leaking out of the boiler. It&#8217;s not like the Death Panels convene the day after Obama signs the bill.</p>

<p>Now that Grassley and Enzi have shown where the wind was actually blowing on the &#8216;bi-partisan&#8217; &#8216;compromise&#8217; supposedly being worked out by the Senate Finance Committee&#8217;s Gang of Six it is time to hit the reset button and in the process clear up some confusion.</p>
<p>Generally the Press has been reporting on the Gang of Six as if it simply represented Regular Order, that when a bill gets referred to Committee it just gets assigned to a sub-group with absolute control and that nothing can proceed until that group agrees. Well that simply is not true at all. Equally some people at dKos have been asking why Senate Finance is split between parties when all other Committees reflect the overall rough balance between the parties. Well Senate Finance is not evenly split, nor all the relevant Sub-Committees.</p>
<p>Senate Finance has 23 members, 13 Democrats and 10 Republicans. <a target="_blank" href="http://finance.senate.gov/sitepages/committee.htm">Senate Finance Committee Members</a> It is further broken down into Sub-Committees of which the largest is the Sub-Committee on Health. which has 11 Democrats and 8 Republicans, meaning that you have almost total overlap. But three names that are missing are Baucus and Conrad on the Dem side and Grassley on the Rep side. <a target="_blank" href="http://finance.senate.gov/sitepages/subcommittees.htm">Finance Sub-Committees</a> Meaning that fully half of the Gang of Six are not even on the relevant Sub-Committee. Moreover the Chair of that Sub-Committee was excluded from the negotiations while the Ranking Member was originally included in what could have been called a Gang of Seven, one that had 3 Republicans from the Health Care Sub-Committee: Hatch, Snowe, and Enzi plus one not in Grassley for a total of 4 as against 1 Democrat from the Health Care Sub-Committee in Bingaman and two not in Baucus and Conrad for a total of 3.</p>
<p>The whole thing was a total perversion of Normal Order, which would either have had the full Committee mark up the bill or refer it to the Sub-Committee, instead Baucus simply insisted on doing an end-run in what was just a blatant power-grab. Moreover the first act of the Gang of Seven was to scrap the Kennedy-Dodd HELP Bill, which had drawn Nay votes from two members from the Gang already in the persons of Hatch and Enzi.</p>
<p>The Gang of Six has been treated as if they were a legitimate and normal part of how major legislation is done and that the Senate has no other choice than to just let the process run. This is just not true at all, the Gang has just as much cover and legitimacy as the Committee Chairman allows it to, and his authority is in turn is limited to how much scope Senate Leadership is willing to defer to it. Baucus claimed that the only way to get a deal that could pass the whole Senate was to rewrite the entire bill from the ground up with the help of Republican Senators who fought the Kennedy-Dodd bill to the end. They further have the gall to claim that Ted Kennedy would have wanted it this way. They stooped to putting words in his mouth before his body was even buried.</p>
<p>Time to give up the pretense here. Grassley in his letter and Enzi in his public statements made it clear that they saw their roles as blocking Health Care Reform. If Baucus doesn&#8217;t see that then he is being consciously blind. And given the way he simply by-passed the Health Care Sub-Committee to start with it is fair to conclude that he was willfully blind from the beginning. Under the Rules of the Senate a bill that has stalled in Committee can be in effect extracted from that Committee by any Senator invoking Rule 14 (link and explanation below the fold). The only thing that prevents that is some sense of courtesy and deference towards the Committee Chair, a deference that he has clearly abused throughout the process.</p>
<p>It is past time for Harry Reid to give Baucus the Johnson Treatment as depicted above. If he has it in him.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.senate.gov/CRSReports/crs-publish.cfm?pid=%26%2A2D4Q%5CK3%0A">The Legislative Process on the Senate Floor; an Introduction</a><br />
<blockquote>Committee Referral and Rule 14<br />The Senate’s standing committees play an essential part in the legislative process, as they select the small percentage of the bills introduced each Congress which, in their judgment, deserve the attention of the Senate as a whole, and as they recommend amendments to these bills based on their expert knowledge and experience. Most bills are routinely referred to the committee with appropriate jurisdiction as soon as they are introduced. However, if a Senator plans to introduce a bill and believes that the committee to which it would be referred will be unsympathetic, Rule XIV, paragraph 4, permits the Senator to bypass the standing committee system altogether and have the bill placed directly on the Calendar of Business, with exactly the same formal status the bill would have if it had been the subject of extensive hearings and exhaustive mark-up meetings in committee. <br />By the same token, if a committee fails to act on a bill that was referred to it, while this may mean the bill will die for lack of action, the proposal it embodies may not. The Senator sponsoring the bill may introduce a new bill with exactly the same provisions as the first, and have the second bill placed directly on the Calendar. In either event, the committee that has been circumvented may oppose bringing the bill from the Calendar to the floor by unanimous consent or by motion, but now the fate of the bill can be decided by the Senate as a whole, not only by one of its committees. Senators generally view this use of Rule XIV as a last resort, both because it undermines the committee system as a whole and because they do not wish to encourage a practice that can be used against their own committees. In recent practice, the Majority Leader sometimes also uses this method to put a measure directly on the Calendar—often to expedite consideration of a complicated or high-profile bill that has been drafted outside of the committee process. </p></blockquote>
