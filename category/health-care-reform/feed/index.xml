<p> Healthcare Reform; Socialism or Fascism?</p>
<p>Whole Foods CEO John Mackey in 2009 originally called President Obama&#8217;s healthcare plan a form of Socialism while writing an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>&#8220;The problem with socialism is that eventually you run out of other people&#8217;s money.&#8221;</i> <i>Margaret</i> <i>Thatcher&#8221;</i></p></blockquote>
<p>and added to Thatcher&#8217;s statement:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>&#8220;While we clearly need health-care reform, the last thing our country needs is a massive new health-care entitlement that will create hundreds of billions of dollars of new unfunded deficits and move us much closer to a government takeover of our health-care system,&#8221; he wrote.</i></p></blockquote>
<p>Mackey joins other CEO&#8217;s (Papa Johns, Olive Garden, Applebees, etc.) (<a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/12/raising-price-of-pizza-10-to-14-cents.html"><i>Raising the Cost of Pizza 10 to 14 cents</i></a>); who refuse to understand the need for healthcare reform, support a commercial healthcare insurance and industry solution even though both have done little to voluntarily rein in costs, are willing to penalize their employees for the PPACA, and ignore the results of doing nothing and associated increased costs. Since Hillarycare (1994), the industry has ignored increasing costs and has not provided solutions to mitigate them. As shown in Figure 1 annual healthcare cost has grown much faster than inflation. Figure 4 shows the increase in House hold expenditures since 1994 when Hillarycare was considered.<i></i></p>
<div><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-c-GJxlk8UzQ/UPrc-bnrVHI/AAAAAAAABbY/PtRATj7wSK0/s1600/hillarycare.PNG" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="263" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-c-GJxlk8UzQ/UPrc-bnrVHI/AAAAAAAABbY/PtRATj7wSK0/s400/hillarycare.PNG" width="400"></a></div>
<p><a href="http://www.americanprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/issues/2009/01/pdf/1994_health_memo.pdf"><i>&#8220;American Healthcare since 1994&#8221; Center for American Progress</i></a></p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Recently during an NPR interview, John Mackey changed his opinion calling the PPACA fascism instead of Socialism:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>&#8220;Technically speaking, it&#8217;s more like fascism. Socialism is where the government owns the means of production. In fascism, the government doesn&#8217;t own the means of production, but they do control it — and that&#8217;s what&#8217;s happening with our health care programs and these reforms.&#8221; </i><a href="http://www.newsmax.com/TheWire/whole-foods-obamacare-facist-socialist/2013/01/16/id/471765">Obamacare Is Fascist, Not Socialist</a></p></blockquote>
<p>In a short period after labeling the PPACA as fascism, John Mackey reconsiders his words after a public uproar and retracted his name-calling of President Obama as a fascist and the PPACA as fascism. All of this from a Liberal now turned Libertarian.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;<i>The term fascism today stirs up too much negative emotion with its horrific associations in the 20th century,&#8221; he said.</i> </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><i>&#8220;I believe that, if the goal is universal health care, our country would be far better served by combining free enterprise capitalism with a strong governmental safety net for our poorest citizens and those with preexisting conditions, helping everyone to be able to buy insurance. This is what Switzerland does and I think we would be much better off copying that system than where we are currently headed in the United States.</i>&#8221; <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/business/whole-foods-ceo-regrets-comparing-obamacare-fascism-1B8022914">Whole Foods CEO Regrets . . .&#8221;</a></p></blockquote>
<p>It has only been since the passage of the PPACA (see S&#038;P Healthcare Indices) has the healthcare industry begun to rein in costs as reflected in Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHPS through efficiencies. Much of this is due to the healthcare industry rapidly preparing for the 2014 final implementation of the PPACA. More will come after 2014.</p>
<p>You would think this would be enough? At the same time, the Republicans are calling for cuts to the three programs to lower deficit spending; the President is offering to consider modest cuts and shows willingness to sell-out the citizens to achieve his Grand Deal. Cuts in any of the programs will do nothing to lower healthcare industry cost as these programs are a reflection of the industry. In the end, such a Grand Deal will lay the burden of healthcare costs on the elderly, the poor and the children of this nation. The &#8220;I Made This&#8221; John Mackeys of the world who became rich as a result his customers buying from Whole Foods will absolve themselves of any social responsibility.</p>

<p>Raising the Price of Pizza 10 to 14 cents. . .</p>
<p> Will pizza and food prices really have to increase to cover healthcare costs for the mostly young employees of the Olive Garden&#8217;s, Denny&#8217;s, and Papa John&#8217;s restaurants? </p>
<p>A 10 to 14 cents increase per pizza is being proposed by Papa Johns&#8217; to pay for the PPACA. At the same time, Papa John&#8217;s is advertising a 2 million-pizza giveaway with the help of Peyton Manning <a href="file:///C:/Users/Owner/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/Temporary%20Internet%20Files/Content.IE5/XVMSONN6/#_top"><i>&#8220;Two Million Free Pizzas&#8221;</i></a> (must be a freebie?). Not sure myself how I might decide to account for the cost; but, here is a try; free pizza for 2 million NFL fans to increase sales, . . . cut employee hours to avoid the PPACA and keep the price, . . . raise prices 10 to 14 cents per pizza to have healthcare insurance for the restaurant staff, . . . or maybe a kind of half cheese/half sausage combo. . . healthcare and free pizzas with Peyton Manning promoting the social responsibility of Papa John&#8217;s? </p>
<p>Maggie Mahar at The Health Beat Blog <a href="http://www.healthbeatblog.com/2012/11/can-u-s-businesses-afford-obamacare-2/"><i>&#8220;Can US Businesses Afford Obamacare?&#8221;</i></a> points to an interesting article by John Padua of <i>Managed Care Matters </i>discussing who bears the healthcare reform cost if restaurant owners opt out<i> </i>while Forbes Caleb Melby runs the numbers and questions the increased costs suggested by Papa&#8217;s John&#8217;s CEO<i> </i><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/calebmelby/2012/11/12/breaking-down-centi-millionaire-papa-john-schnatters-obamacare-math/"><i>&#8220;Papa John&#8217;s Obamacare Math&#8221;</i></a><i> .</i><br /><i><br /></i> The issue(s): <i>The Affordable Care Act dictates that full-time employees (30 hours or more per week) at companies with more than 50 workers need to be provided health insurance. CEO John Schnatter has further claimed that some employers will cut employee hours to avoid providing them with healthcare. </i><br /><i></i><br />The Cost: <i>John Schnatter estimates that Obamacare will end up costing his company $5-8 million annually.</i><br /><i></i><br />The Price Increase: <i>10 to 14 cents per pizza</i><br /><strong><br /></strong> <strong>Checking John Schnatter’s Math: </strong><i>Last year, Papa John’s International captured $1.218 billion in revenue. Total operating expenses were $1.131 billion. If Schnatter’s math is accurate (Obamacare will cost his company $5-8 million more annually), then new regulation translates into a .4% to .7% expense increase. It is difficult to set that ratio against the proposed pie increase and across all sizes given size and topping differentials, but many of their large specialty pizzas run for $16. Remarkably, a 10-14 cent increase on a $16 pizza falls in a comparable range of .6% to .9%; but, the cost transference becomes less equitable if you are looking at medium pizzas which run closer to $12, meaning a .8% to 1.15% price increase.</i><br /><i><br /></i> <i>Lets say that Papa John’s sells exactly half medium/half large specialty pizzas. Averaging the ranges for both sizes, then averaging that product yields a .86% price increase — well outside the range of what Schnatter says Obamacare will cost him.</i><br /><i><br /></i> <i>So how much would prices go up, under these 50/50 conditions, if they were to fairly reflect the increased cost of doing business onset by Obamacare? Roughly 3.4 to 4.6 cents a pie.</i><br /><i></i></p>
<p>3.4 to 4.6 cents does not seem like such a huge increase to bear by either customer or the business and if the advertising is done right; it might prove more positive than giving away 2 million freebie pizzas during the NFL season . . . a little like Schooner Tuna in the movie &#8220;<i>Mr. Mom,</i>&#8216;<i>we are in this together for the long haul.'&#8221;</i> What customer would not buy into this?</p>
<p>The Issue(s): From the annals of I made this;<i> &#8220;Everyone is looking for a way &#8216;</i>not<i>&#8216; to provide insurance for their employees. It is essentially a huge tax on all us business people,&#8221; </i>declares <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/health/2012/11/15/1197431/dennys-obamacare/?mobile=nc"><i>Denny&#8217;s RREMC Franchise Owner CEO John Metz</i></a><i> </i>on Fox News. To offset costs further, John adds; &#8220;<strong><i>he also will slash most of the </i></strong><strong><i>staff’s time to fewer than 30 hours per week</i></strong>&#8221; to start January 2014.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Talk about giving a long notice for plant closures to employees. What happens if franchise owner sidesteps the insurance provision of the PPACA and cuts hours to fewer than 30? John Padua of <i>Managed Care Matters </i>says the cost falls back on the US citizenry, employees, and customers of these restaurants. </p>
<p><strong>&#8220;<i>If companies do not provide insurance for low-paid workers, we taxpayers have to.</i></strong><i> That is the way Obamacare works; folks with incomes below 400% of the FPL can get subsidized coverage. If restaurants cut workers’ hours so as not to insure employees, all of us taxpayers get to pay for their health insurance. These companies are avoiding their responsibility and increasing our tax burden. </i><i><a href="http://www.joepaduda.com/2012/11/the-cost-obamacare-14-cents-per-pizza/">&#8220;The Cost of Obamacare -14 cents per pizza&#8221;</a></i><i></i></p>
<p>The Cost: Maggie Mahar raises the question in her <i>&#8220;Can They Afford It???&#8221;</i> post. Metz employs 1,200 associates at his Denny&#8217;s RREMC franchise. Taking the extreme case of all 1200 employees going into the state exchange and being subsidized up to 400% of FPL; by slashing everyone&#8217;s hours to 28, Metz avoids the $2,000 penalty (~$2.34 million in total) for those going into the state exchange.</p>
<p>The Price Increase: 5% surcharge to all meals in 40 Denny&#8217;s in Georgia, Florida and Virginia. (note: I wonder how that will appear on the bill?)</p>
<p>Checking The Math: The CBO (which forever appears to be anti-healthcare reform) found in a recent study, 2014 comprehensive healthcare insurance could be had at $3,400 for an employee up to 30 years of age and single. Understanding we are not talking about writing off Metz&#8217;s employee expenses from his corporate income tax yet and knowing the PPACA requires an employer to pay 65% of the employee&#8217;s healthcare insurance, the $3,400 per person (down from a projected $6,700 without the PPACA) now becomes $2,210 per person. </p>
<p>Denny&#8217;s franchise owner Metz is angry with Obama, the PPACA, and his employees. Granted, the example is as much an extreme as Metz&#8217;s knee jerk reactions and posturing; but, it points to the overall fallacy in the too-much-healthcare- cost is a drag on my business argument. Both of these entrepreneurs did take grief for their stances. Denny&#8217;s CEO John Miller did call john Metz to discuss his stance and John Schnatter has been called out in various blogs and is the subject of multiple boycotts.</p>
<p>Much of this sounds like sour grapes starting with SCOTUS affirming the PPACA and is carryover from the re-election of Barack Obama to the Presidency. Some have protested the validity of the PPACA claiming it was immoral to force business owners to pay for employee healthcare insurance. In an email exchange, John Paduca answers:</p>
<p><i>&#8220;In response to your query as to when it became an employers’ responsibility to provide health insurance, that would have occurred when PPACA was passed, signed into law, and upheld by the Supreme Court. Laws run this country, not morals. If &#8216;morals&#8217; did, we never would have invaded Iraq or water-boarded prisoners or interned Japanese Americans or overturned legitimate governments in Africa and Central America or supported the Shah of Iran. &#8216;Morals&#8217; are personal; laws are societal.&#8221;</i><br /><i><br /></i> Maybe it is just Republicans having to cancel their airline tickets to Boston for the celebration on November 7th which has placed both Johns in a bad mood. Or could it be pent up anger with the very people who elected Barack to The White House for a second term? You know, those 47 percenters who might make up the bulk of the restaurant workers. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>by Tom aka Rusty Rustbelt</p>
<p>Health Care Thoughts: Reform Status According to Really Smart People</p>
<p>So after two days in rooms full of top notch front line experts, and two nights sleeping on a couch in a hospital waiting room, I offer a list of key take-aways.. This is reporting only, not advocacy. Some of my opinions may vary (not much). I avoid the nitty-grittiest of operational details. So&#8230;..</p>
<p>The amount and complexity of work to be done in the next 24 months is crushing and impossible &#8211; expect delays or sloppy rollouts.</p>
<p>Scale is everything, small providers will get crushed. Impacts on rural health care uncertain, so&#8230;</p>
<p>Consolidation and integration is the critical  path. Some bad outcomes likely.</p>
<p>The Obama administration is incapable of producing regulations and guidance papers on time (in Washington a little late is considered on time).</p>
<p>Providers are preparing cuts both permenant and &#8220;cliff&#8221; cuts.</p>
<p>The amount and complexity of IT work through the system is staggering.  Data is the new currency of health care.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Setting up the exchanges is a massive and messy task, even in the enthusiastic states. Letting the feds install &#8220;plug-and-play&#8221; may become a good option for many states.</p>
<p>Some large public companies are seriously considering dropping health insurance and paying the penalty  (stunned me). No decisions yet known.</p>
<p>Winners, sorta in sequence:</p>
<p>Health IT &#8211; vendor companies and geeks<br />Health lawyers &#8211; transaction and regulatory<br />Health executives &#8211; the &#8220;talent wars&#8221; are going full blast<br />Health CPAs, finance officers and consultants<br />Physician executives<br />Nursing executives<br />Bureaucrats and regulatory</p>
<p>Losers</p>
<p>Physicians &#8211; mostly (depends on many factors)<br />Nurses &#8211; hands on care givers<br />Therapist and ancillary providers<br />Hospital support staff</p>
<p>Getting a child ready for college? Push them towards&#8230;..</p>
<p>IT, health emphasis<br />Health care administration<br />Medical records administration / health informatics<br />Medical coding (good jobs with 2 year degree)<br />Accounting and finance, health emphasis<br />Actuarial science</p>
<p>Private health insurers may be really big winners (oops). Some private health insurers are building primary care networks and ACOs.</p>
<p>There are some intesresting and even exciting geriatric care innovations morphing out of the Obama administration, academia and providers.</p>
<p>The &#8220;old elderly&#8221; are using huge amounts of Medicare resources, innovations may cut usage with the same or better care.</p>
<p>Hospital capital spending is going wild as a market share play, just what we don&#8217;t need.</p>
<p>So, now to plug through a thousand or so pages on operational and regulatory details. Did I mention the Obama administration writes a lot of long and largely incomprehensible regulations and guidance statements?</p>
<p>Interesting times ahead.</p>

<blockquote><p>A remarkably important and persuasive paper that calls into question the need for “reforming” Medicare has not gotten the attention it warrants. “<a href="http://www.bancaditalia.it/studiricerche/convegni/atti/fiscal_sustainability/session_3/Follette%20Sheiner.pdf">An Examination of Health-Spending Growth In The United States: Past Trends And Future Prospects</a>” (hat tip nathan) by Glenn Follette and Louise Sheiner looks at the model used by the Congressional Budgetary Office to estimate long term health care cost increases. Bear in mind that this model is THE driver of virtually all forecasts of future budget deficits.<br />This paper, although written in typically anodyne economese, is devastating in the range and nature of its criticisms.</p></blockquote>
<p>The election for Senator in MA is close and takes a lot of time, so discussion of this topic has received short shrift till later, but reponses are in the works.  I have taken the liberty of lifting comments from that thread at <i>Naked Capitalism</i> from run75441, Yves, and reader river.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>run75441 says:<br />Yves:<br />I have mentioned this before and caught a lot of flak, Elmendorf was one of several who helped kill Hillarycare.<br /> <cite>Yves Smith</cite> says:

<p>And further question and answers here:</p>

After all of us experiencing this exact same thing play itself out in the housing market, I can only imagine how it would play itself out in healthcare. For the last few years, most of my raises have gone to healthcare cost increases, and I would expect that to continue, but after a while, we would switch to a catestrophic insurance program and just not use the services that they are providing. As the costs keep going up, more and more people would stop getting any insurance. Bankrupcies, and cost pressures on medical facilities will start to hit the practitioners (if all of the antelopes are starving, the lions will soon starve themselves).<br /><a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2012/11/fed-budgetary-experts-demolish-cbo-health-cost-model-the-lynchpin-of-budget-hysteria.html?replytocom=890411#respond">Reply</a>

The goal is to get both down to 1% through a series of cost initiatives led by Medicare. Obama has pledged to allow Medicare to begin negotiating healthcare industry services.<br />The MLR was put in place to control the amount of premiums spent on insurance administration. Within the MLR are risk factors based upon the youngest and healthiest insuree, 150% for smokers (too low), and up to 300% for the elderly. There is also a maximum you will pay as a percentage of income.<br />I had a discussion today with Maggie Mahar on the growing costs and the attached article. I am sure she would not mind my posting some of her thoughts:<br />“It seems to me that any attempt to forecast that far out is nuts. Wall Street analysts don’t try to predict a corporation’s finance out more than 3 years– maybe 5– and that’s just one corporations.<br />They’re talking about healthcare spending– a huge chunk of the economy.They also assume that the aging of America means higher spending.<br />A number of countries in Europe that have populations that are significantly older than ours have shown that just isn’t true. (I’m thinking of Germany &#038; Sweden in particular).<br />We’ve always been somewhat hysterical about “What will happen when the Baby Boomers Grow Old!!” We’ll handle it because we have to.<br />We already know that 1/3 of Medicare dollars are wasted. Cut even 2/3 of that waste, and problem solved. Getting away from fee for service, more efficient systems, refusing to pay for preventable errors, reducing what medicare pays for services we know are not terribly effective; greater use of nurse practitioners, less screening, . . . etc.”</li>

By way of background, it’s important to keep in mind that pretty much every place that professes simply to read research and translate into stuff journalists and the lay public can understand is generally called a “think tank” and they are Trojan horses for policy agendas. It is also worth noting that Leonard Davis founded Colonial Penn, a large insurance company. </p></blockquote>

They recently hired an Ad Age journalist to head up a group of writers who will translate econ mumbo jumbo for decision makers who need guidance and make health policy.<br />     You can read the blog piece which links to Penn’s announcement which should give you a picture of the kind of policy that goes on there. Nice work if you can get it, huh?</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Uwe E. Reinhardt offers his viewpoint on trends in US health spending.  Following are excerpts from two articles in the NYT&#8217;s <i>Economix  </i>concerning the costs of our system and how they are apportioned in the big picture, and the impact on family budgets.  Reading the charts is actually important.</p>
<p>There are trends in our health care system that are in place and that providers are responding to, making the regulation process only part of the bigger story. </p>
<p><a href="http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/25/the-fork-in-the-road-for-health-care/" target="_blank">The Fork in the Road for Health Care</a><br />
<blockquote>For 2012, the nationwide average of the total health spending for a typical family of four was estimated by Milliman to be $20,728. On a regional basis, that average varies from a low of $18,365 in Phoenix to $24,965 in Miami.</p>
<p>A just-released <a href="http://www.healthcostinstitute.org/2010report">study</a> by the <a href="http://www.healthcostinstitute.org/about">Health Care Cost Institute</a> shows that much of these spending increases are the result of rising prices and not of rising use. <a href="http://www.kaiserhealthnews.org/Stories/2012/May/21/higher-health-care-prices-hospitals.aspx">Reporting</a> on the study, Julie Appleby of Kaiser Health News notes,</p>
<blockquote><p>Higher prices charged by hospitals, outpatient centers and other providers drove up health-care spending at double the rate of inflation during the economic downturn – even as patients consumed less medical care over all. </p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />
<blockquote>The chart below shows the path of the Milliman Medical Index since the year 2000. Although the increase of “only” 6.9 percent between 2011 and 2012 was the lowest since Milliman started publishing the index 12 years ago, a 6.9 percent increase is nevertheless alarming in a period when gross domestic product per capita and the gross wages of employees rise at much lower rates.<br />… </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Although the family’s contribution of $8,584 is by no means trivial, it is less than half of the total average cost of a family’s health care cost. Most employees probably believe that “the company” – that is, its owners – absorbs the other 58 percent of the family’s total health spending. </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Economists have long argued that <a href="http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/05/22/is-employer-based-health-insurance-worth-saving/">this is an illusion</a> – that over the longer haul the bulk and possibly all of the ostensibly employer-paid health insurance premiums gets indirectly shifted back into the employee’s paycheck through lower increases in take-home pay. </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>To the extent that there is a limit to this cost shift – e.g., for low-wage or unionized employees — the backward shift takes the form of reduced employment or, alternatively, the employer’s decision not to offer employees health insurance at all. </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>This point on backward cost-shifting was driven home recently in <a href="http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/30/9/1630.full.pdf+html?sid=9515d36c-2263-4f8f-8621-567526900940">a paper</a> in Health Affairs by David Auerbach and Arthur Kellerman. The authors present data showing that a decade of health care cost growth in employer-based health insurance “has wiped out real income gains for an average U.S. family” from 1999 through 2009. Health care has come to chew up American household budgets like <a href="http://www.thepcmanwebsite.com/media/pacman_flash/">Pacman</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/20/is-u-s-health-spending-finally-under-control/" target="_blank">Is US health spending finally under control?</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Charts 1 and 2 show the growth of health spending from 1965 to 2010, broken down by source of payment. Chart 1 exhibits the time path of actual health spending, not adjusted for inflation. Chart 2 exhibits the percentage of total national health spending contributed by the various sources in the chart. In the charts the green area denotes out-of-pocket spending at the time health care is consumed, the red private health insurance, the gray Medicare, the yellow Medicaid and the blue “other third-party payments.”</p>
<p>Economists would explain such a trend as flows: as the fraction of G.D.P. devoted to health care increases, the added satisfaction, or utility, that people derive from added health care is likely to diminish relative to the added satisfaction derived from consuming more of other things. It could explain a gradual decline in the excess growth of health care spending.</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>by Kenneth Thomas</p>
<p>Romney to Replace Obamacare with&#8230;Essentially Nothing </p>
<p>Tommy Christopher (via @rcooley123) at Mediaite <a href="http://www.mediaite.com/online/the-devil-in-the-details-of-mitt-romneys-interview-with-times-mark-halperin/">has a good catch</a> on Mitt Romney&#8217;s health care proposals, from an interview Romney gave to <a href="http://thepage.time.com/2012/05/23/the-complete-romney-interview-transcript/">Mark Halperin</a> of Time magazine. Asked what would happen to people with pre-existing conditions after he were to repeal Obamacare, Romney said:<br />
<blockquote>If people have been continuously insured, and then they decide to change jobs or change locations, they should not be denied coverage if they go to a new place or have to get a new policy. So people continuously insured should be able to get new insurance.</p></blockquote>
<p>As Christopher points out, people who have been continuously insured already have this right, and have since 1996, under Title 1 of HIPAA. As he puts it, Romney &#8220;is selling you something you already owned.&#8221; And lest you think maybe Romney just misspoke, you can see the very same words in <a href="http://www.mittromney.com/issues/health-care">his platform</a>: &#8220;Prevent discrimination against individuals with pre-existing conditions who maintain continuous coverage.&#8221; So, on the critical question of pre-existing conditions, Romney is offering precisely nothing.  </p>
<p>That is hardly the end of Romney&#8217;s useless ideas on health care. His platform says we should return control over health insurance to the states. In principle, this could be workable; after all, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicare_%28Canada%29">in Canada</a> each province has its own health insurance plan. States are big enough entities to do this: if Prince Edward Island can have its own plan, so could Rhode Island. And there is diversity in the provincial plans: Quebec&#8217;s covers prescription medicine, while Ontario&#8217;s does not. But this only works because the federal government has strong conditions on what level of coverage the provinces can provide. Romney, on the other hand, says we should &#8220;Limit federal standards and requirements on both private insurance and Medicaid coverage.&#8221; This is a sure recipe for bad health insurance regulation at the state level.  </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Another plank in his health care platform is to &#8220;Empower individuals and small businesses to form purchasing pools.&#8221; This will not enable individuals or small businesses to have anywhere near as much bargaining power as the state insurance exchanges in the Affordable Care Act.  <br />Romney also says we should turn Medicaid into a block grant, giving states more flexibility. As <a href="http://theincidentaleconomist.com/wordpress/if-only-medicaid-had-some-flexibility/">Aaron Carroll</a> points out, states acquired a great deal of flexibility with Medicaid during the GW Bush Administration, but have not introduced any great innovations. Why Romney thinks that would change is anyone&#8217;s guess.<br />  <br />And of course, what would a Republican health care proposal be without the usual references to tort reform, &#8220;innovation grants to explore non-litigation alternatives to dispute resolution&#8221; (tort reform again), allowing insurance to be sold against state lines (which would weaken state&#8217;s ability to regulate; isn&#8217;t that where Romney said authority should be?) and getting rid of the tax deduction for employer-provided health care?  </p>
<p>So, instead of the Affordable Care Act, Romney promises to give us what we already have on pre-existing conditions, plus junk to give insurance companies even more control over the health care market than ever.  </p>

<p> Care Thoughts: Research on Defensive Medicine (Part 1)</p>
<p>(Background &#8211; I have been an executive in two orthopaedic centers, and write and lecture for orthopaedic practice executives.)</p>
<p>A <a href="http://news.vanderbilt.edu/2012/02/defensive-orthopaedic-medicine/" target="_blank">Vanderbilt research survey</a> of orthopaedic surgeons indicate that 24% of diagnostic testing is &#8220;defensive medicine.&#8221;   This does not surprise me, as I have been in the room when defensive medicine protocols have be decided. I have been involved in settling about two dozen malpractice suits against orthopedists (three had some merit, one was certainly malpractice). I also have done analysis for both sides in other malpractice actions.  </p>
<p>Orthopaedists treat patients who have intense pain from serious injuries and conditions, and many of those patients have high expectations for positive outcomes. Those outcomes are not always possible, despite near miraculous results in many cases.  But don&#8217;t they have insurance?  Yes, but the stress and costs of a malpractice suit grind on physicians, even when suits are ridiculous it is a very unpleasant experience.  An orthopaedist who does surgery without an MRI study puts him/herself in real jeopardy, and to be fair some lab and cardiology tests are required by accreditation standards.  </p>
