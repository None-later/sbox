<p><strong>Prices and Quantity for Whale Oil and Whale Bone</strong><br />Cross posted at the <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=317">Presimetrics blog</a>.</p>
<p>The following graph shows the price and quantity of Sperm whale oil (which is actually more of a wax).</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TUdTVLX1kaI/AAAAAAAAAho/tHUcq8MRqig/s1600/whale1.bmp"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TUdTVLX1kaI/AAAAAAAAAho/tHUcq8MRqig/s400/whale1.bmp" border="0" alt=""></a>Figure 1</p>
<p>The positive correlation is a bit of a problem, and the fact that Quantity seems to lead Price by about ten years is a bit more of a problem.</p>
<p>Now, that could be just an interesting artifact, except for this graph, which shows the price and quantity of whale oil (and this time I do mean oil).  </p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TUdTVZrqFKI/AAAAAAAAAhw/y0ilS3a4w4k/s1600/whale2.bmp"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TUdTVZrqFKI/AAAAAAAAAhw/y0ilS3a4w4k/s400/whale2.bmp" border="0" alt=""></a>Figure 2</p>
<p>Notice that the correlation is negative (sigh of relief) but once again, you get some information about prices from quantities produced decades earlier.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s whale bone.  Its worse.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TUdTVo_2nlI/AAAAAAAAAh4/bVej68icSQw/s1600/whale3.bmp"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TUdTVo_2nlI/AAAAAAAAAh4/bVej68icSQw/s400/whale3.bmp" border="0" alt=""></a>Figure 3.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s going on?</p>
<p>This post comes from something I&#8217;m playing with at work (I&#8217;m trying to understand how a few specific commodities might play out over a very long period of time) and is posted with the permission of my boss.  (Thanks Lauren!)  I don&#8217;t usually like to play with data that goes that far back as it isn&#8217;t always reliable but I figured this was fine for broad strokes purposes.</p>
<p>Price and quantity data from <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/">A History of the American Whale Fishery</a> by Walter Sheldon Tower, Tables IV and V.  Data was entered by hand so hopefully I didn&#8217;t screw up too much too badly.  CPI estimates from the <a href="http://www.minneapolisfed.org/community_education/teacher/calc/hist1800.cfm">Minnesota Fed</a>.</p>
<p>If you want my spreadsheet let me know &#8211; I&#8217;m at mike  period my last name (one m only) at gmail.com.</p>
