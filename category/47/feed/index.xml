<p>Romney <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/09/secret-video-romney-private-fundraiser">claims</a> that that the 47% of the people that don’t pay federal income tax are a lost cause. They are simply moochers and looters that “are dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims, who believe the government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you-name-it.” They’re part of the problem, in his mind, and there is nothing he can do to help them because they refuse to help themselves. </p>
<p>But as <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2012/09/nontaxpayers-are-overwhelmingly-the-eldery-and-students.html">Mark Thoma shows</a>, the vast majority of people that don’t pay federal income tax (which is only just a part of federal taxes) are either students or the elderly. The elderly, in particular, do not pay income or payroll taxes on the meager payout of Social Security. </p>
<p>This from <a href="http://www.hamiltonproject.org/papers/the_truth_about_taxes_just_about_everyone_pays_them/">the Hamilton Project</a>:</p>
<p><a href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/-j3ZC-zCWtDk/UFjA-aXt2iI/AAAAAAAABDI/DIRLukStMYk/s1600-h/clip_image001%25255B3%25255D.gif"><img alt="clip_image001" border="0" height="186" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/-Hk1-pCuIa4g/UFjA-3xiZxI/AAAAAAAABDQ/XNiNAYJy5n4/clip_image001_thumb.gif?imgmax=800" title="clip_image001" width="244"></a></p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>The irony of this, though, is that older Americans are the group most likely to vote for Republicans! Here are <a href="http://sailerfraud.blogspot.com/2010/11/2010-election-analysis-race-sex-age.html">exit poll data</a> from the 2010 election cycle:</p>
<p><a href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/-T7H8lZR-Xoo/UFjA_UyK7RI/AAAAAAAABDY/fgR73scM2n4/s1600-h/clip_image003%25255B3%25255D.jpg"><img alt="clip_image003" border="0" height="149" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/-uFu_BRZf_J0/UFjA_vKVZEI/AAAAAAAABDg/Hvvke-PTzH4/clip_image003_thumb.jpg?imgmax=800" title="clip_image003" width="244"></a></p>
<p>Will Romney’s attempt to characterize older folks as parasites turn them off of the GOP? I doubt it, but it’s a funny way to do outreach.</p>
