                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Sometimes, Blog Posts Write Themselves: Cleaning up a hard drive of old files, I ran across these two articles from the middle of last year.</p>
<p>First, the WSJ, arbiter of business sanity and purveyor of a positive meme whenever one is to be found, <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB118553827579780254.html?mod=googlenews_wsj">on 28 July 2007</a>—nine months after the general supply of securitizable mortgage loans went away, at least six months after even those with their own origination capacity realised the game was over, and about two weeks before Bear Stearns would issue bonds at the then-junk-bond-area yield of 245 over:<br />
<blockquote>The economy grew at an annual rate of 3.4% in the quarter, reversing the anemic 0.6% growth in the first quarter, the Commerce Department said. Increases in exports and government spending drove much of the improvement. A rise in commercial construction spending and building of inventories offset a drag from housing and sluggish consumer spending.</p>
<p>But the positive drivers aren&#8217;t expected to persist, and recent indicators cast a darkening shadow over the rest of the year. The latest readings for spending on plant and equipment, which grew at a tepid 2.3% pace in the quarter, are disappointing. Rising inventories of unsold homes, falling prices and tighter lending terms on subprime loans for marginal borrowers offer little hope that housing is stabilizing. The downturn in stocks crimps Americans&#8217; wealth, and turbulence in credit markets is sparking fears that loans will be costlier or harder to get&#8230;.</p>
<p>Some business executives expect things to get worse. &#8220;This idea that there&#8217;s been no spillover from housing into other segments is just faulty,&#8221; Mike Jackson, chief executive of auto dealer AutoNation Inc., said in a conference call. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s extreme economic distress out there right now. It&#8217;s one of the toughest environments I&#8217;ve ever seen since I&#8217;ve been in the business.&#8221;&#8230;</p>
<p>Some forecasters say the gloom is overdone. As long as businesses continue to hire, the jobless rate remains near its current low 4.5% and energy prices don&#8217;t go higher, they say overall consumer incomes should be strong enough to support a healthy level of consumer spending. In a favorable sign, the University of Michigan said Friday its consumer confidence index rose to 90.4 in July from 85.3 in June.</p>
<p>Corporate earnings outside of financial services remain robust, although companies have been worrying for months about higher input costs crimping profit margins. &#8220;The real risk for consumer spending is if for some reason companies slam on the brakes and stop hiring,&#8221; said Brian Bethune, an economist at Global Insight. &#8220;The employment market is still reasonably solid.&#8221;&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;The big picture is that you&#8217;ve got an inventory problem in both markets &#8212; you&#8217;ve got too many homes for sale and too many bonds for sale,&#8221; says Mr. Kiesel. &#8220;So prices need to adjust: You need lower house prices and much bigger credit spreads. It means the economy is going to slow.&#8221;</p>
<p>Downward revisions to growth from the first quarter of 2004 through the first quarter of 2007 added to concerns because they offer more evidence that the pace of productivity growth has slowed, and with it estimates of the speed at which the economy can grow without higher inflation. Economists at Bear Stearns, for instance, said that estimates of the economy&#8217;s potential growth rate are likely to fall below 2.5% a year.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let&#8217;s ignore for the moment the delusion that it was All About Subprime—even though some idiot on CBC was making exactly that claim Friday, trying to explain Why Canada is Different. (I&#8217;ll take <a href="http://worthwhile.typepad.com/worthwhile_canadian_initi/2008/12/why-are-forecasters-predicting-a-mild-recession-for-canada.html">Stephen Gordon&#8217;s analysis</a>, instead.) This is an attempt at being positive: in the wake of an annualized 3.4% growth rate, that should have been much easier. But the harbingers had landed by then.</p>
<p>Next, the guy who keeps getting slammed in comments here and elsewhere, often for no good reason (or, <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/11/waiting-for-delong-fish-cage-match.html">in the case of Stanley Fish</a>, in the throes of full hypocrisy).  Larry Summers about a month later, <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oe-summers27aug27,0,2195006.story?coll=la-opinion-rightrail">27 August 2007, in the LA Times</a>.  First, he gives the lie to the &#8220;once a century&#8221; meme:<br />
<blockquote>Over the last two decades, major financial disruptions have taken place roughly every three years &#8212; the 1987 stock market crash, the savings and loan collapse and credit crunch of the early 1990s, the 1994 Mexican peso devaluation, the Asian financial crises of 1997, the Russian default and Long Term Capital Management implosion of 1998, the bursting of the technology bubble in 2000, the disruptions of 9/11 and the 2002 post-Enron deflationary scare in the credit markets.</p>
<p>This record suggests that, by the beginning of 2007, the world was long overdue for a major financial disruption. And sure enough, the difficulties around sub-prime mortgages &#8220;went systemic&#8221; in the last month as the market seemed to doubt the creditworthiness of even the strongest institutions and rushed to buy Treasury debt.</p></blockquote>
<p>Soon, he gets to the heart of the matter:<br />
<blockquote>[A]s investors rush for the exits, the focus of risk analysis shifts from fundamentals to investor behavior. As some liquidate, prices fall, then others are forced to liquidate, driving prices down further. The anticipation of cascading liquidation leads to still more liquidation, creating price movements that seemed inconceivable only a few weeks before. Reduced credit feeds back negatively on the real economy.</p>
<p>Eventually &#8212; sometimes in a few months, as in the U.S. in 1987 and 1998; sometimes in a decade, as in Japan during the 1990s &#8212; there is enough liquidation and price adjustment to make extraordinary fear give way to ordinary greed, and the process of repair begins.</p>
<p>It is too soon to draw policy lessons from the current crisis or to determine exactly where in the cycle we are now. But it is not too soon to highlight the questions it points up. Three stand out.</p></blockquote>
<p>From that point on, the article goes downhill:<br />
<blockquote>First, the current crisis has been propelled by a loss of confidence in rating agencies, as large amounts of debt that had been very highly rated has instead headed toward default&#8230;.But there is no doubt that, as in previous financial crises, the rating agencies have dropped the ball.</p>
<p>In light of this, should bank capital standards, Federal Reserve discounting policy and countless investment guidelines still be based on credit ratings? What is the alternative? What if any legislative response is appropriate?</p></blockquote>
<p>It seems more likely to assume that rating agencies are lagging, not leading, indicators of credit crises, as investment products develop based on iterative variations of current products, whose risk profile is therefore (definitionally) somewhat less well defined, and (again definitionally) are likely to have thicker tails that will not be captured by standard modeling. (See <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/11/citibank-like-s-assumed-house-prices.html">Robert&#8217;s discussion here</a>.)</p>
<p>Summers continues:<br />
<blockquote>Second, how should policy respond to financial crises centered on nonfinancial institutions? A premise of our system is that banks accept much closer supervision from public authorities in return for privileged access to the Federal Reserve payments system and its &#8220;discount window,&#8221; which allows banks to borrow directly from the Federal Reserve. The problem this time is not that banks lack capital. It&#8217;s that the solvency of a range of non-banks is in question because of cascading liquidations and doubts about their fundamentals. In an old-fashioned phrase, central banks that seek to instill financial confidence by lending to banks or even by reducing their cost of borrowing may well be pushing on a string.</p></blockquote>
<p>With the admission of insolvency of the financial institutions still at least six months away, Summers was already discussing the limits of liquidity provision.</p>
<p>His third point is only slightly less prescient:<br />
<blockquote>Third, what is the right public role in supporting credit to the housing sector? The lesson learned from the S&#038;L debacle was that it is catastrophic to finance home ownership through insured institutions that borrow short term and then offer long-term fixed-rate mortgages. Now a system reliant on adjustable-rate mortgages and non-insured institutions has broken down.</p></blockquote>
<p>I might argue Summers took the wrong lesson from the S&#038;L crisis, which grew in large part from primarily Texas-based S&#038;Ls that loaned large amounts of money based on the idea that some barren desert land was valuable because it had oil under it. It does not seem coincident that the first wave of housing market collapses (ca. mid-to-late 2006) were all in similarly-desert areas—Phoenix, Lost Wages, the tracts of land near I-5 between LA and SF.  But at least he knew what not to do:<br />
<blockquote>[I]f there is ever a moment when [Fannie and Freddie] should expand their activities, it is now, when mortgage liquidity is drying up. No doubt, credit standards in the sub-prime market were way too low for way too long. But now, as borrowers face the reset of adjustable mortgages, it is not the time for authorities to get religion and encourage the denial of credit.</p></blockquote>
<p>The next time someone tells you that &#8220;no one predicted&#8221; this phase of the current crisis, point them to Larry Summers fifteen months ago.  Or even, in broad outline, the WSJ.</p>

                                <p>Look no further than some of the brain-dead idiocy suggested as part of <a href="http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/12/12/the-ideal-stimulus-package/">this NY Times poll of economists</a>.  Saddest quote of the day is from Andrew Samwick, who decided to be stupid the day the U.S. elected a non-Republican president:<br />
<blockquote>“If I had my druthers, the word ’stimulus’ would be expunged from public discussion, along with ‘bailout’ and ‘rescue.’ These words convey the idea that, because we have so mismanaged our economic and financial affairs, we are somehow able or entitled to conjure up additional funds out of thin air to fix our problems.</p></blockquote>
<p>Samwick does at least close his ranting with some sensible proposals, instead of the idiocy from Andrew Roth, who lies with impunity because the NYT is stupid enough to let him do so:<br />
<blockquote>“The best way to spend $500 billion would be to permanently eliminate the corporate income tax&#8230;.It would instantly increase asset valuations like 401(k)’s, I.R.A.’s, and homes, which have been hemorrhaging in value over the last several months.</p></blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s right.  The solution to the 30% decline in housing prices and that 40% decline in your 401(k) is bankrupting the country and letting your grandchildren pay for it.</p>

                                <p>Via <a href="http://www.portfolio.com/views/blogs/market-movers/2008/11/23/extra-credit-saturday-edition?tid=true">Felix</a>, we discover Joe Nocera at the NYT reporting that <a href="http://executivesuite.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/11/18/what-securitization-problem-the-fdic-weighs-in/">securitization professionals are not as stupid as they would have had us believe</a>:<br />
<blockquote>What [the FDIC] has discovered, said [Michael H. Krimminger, the F.D.I.C.’s special adviser to the chairman for policy], is that the contracts are rarely as constricting as investors and servicers have been portraying them. They do not allow principal reduction, for sure, but they almost never disallow interest rate reduction — or delaying principal payments for a short time. What’s more, Mr. Krimminger said, the servicer agreement simply says that the servicer’s job is to maximize the investment — which often means avoiding foreclosure.</p></blockquote>
<p>Buyers of a security want the best return they can get.  Foreclosure stops that cash flow, and bankruptcy procedures—at their best—impede those flows.</p>
<p>This is the rational position.  So what had Nocera written that caused Bair and Krimminger to call him?:<br />
<blockquote>I have quoted a number of experts and people in the securitization business who have told me repeatedly that it is nearly impossible to modify mortgages that are trapped in toxic mortgage-backed securities. The contracts, they say, don’t really have provisions for preventing foreclosures. And the servicers face terrible conflicts if they try to modify mortgages, because inevitable some of the bond investors will do better than others — depending on where they stand along the risk continuum — and under those same contracts, servicers are obliged to treat all investors alike. Finally, I’ve heard, servicers have been unwilling to lift a finger for homeowners because they have no financial incentive to do so — and they face the prospect of being sued by one of their investors if they do.</p></blockquote>
<p>Servicers have been unwilling to lift a finger, and as such are not following the fiduciary responsibility of ensuring investors an appropriate return.</p>
<p>And it takes the bloody Chair of the FDIC—not the Treasury Secretary, whose former firm made piles of money for him with such securitization procedures—to understand the situation and tell the truth.</p>
<p>Apparently, we have to wait for some large investor and/or hedge funds whose bonds have gone into the default to sue their servicer before someone outside of the FDIC understands that investors prefer receiving some money to none.</p>
<p>Update:  I see, via <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2008/11/why-sheila-bair.html">Mark Thoma</a>, that John Hempton is being stupid.  Is this a unique situation, or is he selling something?  It <a href="http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2008/11/tax-benefits-wells-and-wachovia.html">appears to be the latter</a>.</p>

                                <p>Back in the Good Old Days, Leveraged Buyouts (LBOs) all the rage. Not coincidentally, the phrase &#8220;underfunded pension liabilities&#8221; moved into the mainstream.</p>
<p>Long story short: when legislation is finally passed to make the &#8220;underfunded&#8221; portion a thing of the past (you can stop laughing any time), several large companies run by Captains of Industry—think Roger Smith and GM—complained that actually putting that funding on their balance sheet would cost <em>One <strong>Billion</strong> dollars</em> off their market cap.  So they were given twenty (20) years to Make It Right.</p>
<p>And Everyone Lived Happily Ever After.</p>
<p>Apparently, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/20/business/economy/20pension.html?_r=1&#038;hp=&#038;oref=slogin&#038;pagewanted=print">until today</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Stung by outsize investment losses, some of the nation’s biggest companies are pushing Congress to roll back rules requiring them to put more money into their pension funds, <em>just two years after President Bush signed a law meant to strengthen the pension system</em>.</p>
<p>The total value of company pension funds is thought to have fallen by more than $250 billion since last winter. With cash now in short supply for companies, they are asking Congress to <em>excuse them from having to replenish the required amounts</em>.</p>
<p>Lawmakers from both parties seem receptive to the idea, and there was talk of adding a pension relief provision to the broad fiscal stimulus package Congress considered for this week’s lame-duck session. [emphasis mine]</p></blockquote>
<p>The best line, of course, comes from an advocate of the Steal Short, Pauperize Long crowd:<br />
<blockquote>“Congress needs to make the funding less volatile,” said Representative Earl Pomeroy, Democrat of North Dakota, who has long been outspoken on pension issues. “I believe that taking this step will save thousands of jobs without costing the Treasury anything.”</p></blockquote>

                                <p>While I&#8217;m trying to decide <a href="http://calculatedrisk.blogspot.com/2008/11/report-bush-administration-will-not.html">whether unmanaged funds are preferrable to mismanaged ones</a>, and wondering whether any discussion of <a href="http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/years/2008/1117081cuban1.html">Mark Cuban</a> (I like the picture better than CNN&#8217;s) belong here,* the NYT decides to continue its determined destruction of its reputation.</p>
<p>Stanley Fish manages to forget—or, more accurately, ignore, since he <a href="http://fish.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/11/16/administrative-virtues-the-case-of-larry-summers/?8ty&#038;emc=ty">mentions it in the first paragraph and then never again</a>—that judging Larry Summers&#8217;s ability to be Secretary of the Treasury might be easier by looking at how he did as, say, Secretary of the Treasury, instead of just sliming his time at Harvard,** and then producing this penultimate paragraph:<br />
<blockquote>What has all this to do with Larry Summers as a potential Secretary of the Treasury in the Obama administration? It depends on how much of the job involves what are usually called “people skills,” the skills that bring men and women of diverse views together in a spirit of optimism and co-operation (two words Obama has often invoked). A cabinet secretary must interact with other secretaries, with the White House staff, with the vice president, with congressional committees, with leaders of industry, with the representatives of other sovereign states and with the media.</p></blockquote>
<p>Gosh. You think maybe Summers <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Summers#Public_official_and_educational_administrator">can do that</a>?</p>
<p>*Probably not for the specific issue.</p>
<p>**To be clear, since there was some confusion the last time I spoke nicely about Summers, he wouldn&#8217;t be my choice for Treasury Secretary.  But Jamie Galbraith, while a wonderful person with a good heart, doesn&#8217;t seem (from the two times I was in the same space as he at the AEA last year) to be an improvement in the people skills department, and <a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2008/11/galbriath-on-mainstream-economics.html">a certain NYT columnist</a> already dislikes him.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cbo.gov/aboutcbo/organization/od.htm">Peter Orszag</a> should be a contender, but doesn&#8217;t get named so it&#8217;s reasonable to assume he&#8217;s happy <a href="http://cboblog.cbo.gov/">where he is</a>.</p>
<p>Fish&#8217;s piece, however, is the <em>People</em> magazine version of Summers&#8217;s tenure at Harvard, both in that it obsesses on &#8220;personality conflicts&#8221; and doesn&#8217;t deal with any of the substantive reasons, if any (op cit. David Warsh), for Summers&#8217;s dismissal from Harvard.</p>
<p>But, unless you&#8217;re going to argue that, because they are later, his five years at Harvard are more related to Treasury than his time at Treasury (which ended when Clinton did) you&#8217;re only going to either create sympathy for the man you&#8217;re trying to demonize or make yourself look stupid. Whether these are mutually exclusive is left as an exercise to the reader.</p>

                                <p>Via <a href="http://www.eschatonblog.com/2008_11_16_archive.html#3847882183236518331">Dr. Black</a>, the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/17/business/17auto.html?hp=&#038;pagewanted=print">NYT quotes the Alabama Senator</a>:<br />
<blockquote>“Companies fail every day and others take their place. I think this is a road we should not go down,” said Mr. Shelby, the senior Republican on the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee.</p>
<p>“They’re not building the right products,” he said. “They’ve got good workers, but I don’t believe they’ve got good management. They don’t innovate. They’re a dinosaur in a sense.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The first sentence (&#8220;Companies fail every day and others take their place.&#8221;) is clearly true.  I believe we refer to this as &#8220;creative destruction&#8221; if we are feeling positive.</p>
<p>The second sentence (&#8220;I think this is a road we should not go down&#8221;) is clearly a lie, since they have gone down that road with AIG, The Hartford, and several other firms.</p>
<p>The next four sentences are subject to interpretation, but let us assume the first two (“They’re not building the right products,” he said. “They’ve got good workers, but I don’t believe they’ve got good management.&#8221;) are true, while leaving the third (&#8220;They don’t innovate.&#8221;) as an exercise for Tom* and the fourth as beyond the pale, even if you assume all of the above.</p>
<p>So we have, in the words of Richard Shelby:
<ol>
<li>Bad management, selecting</li>
<li>the wrong products, being made by</li>
<li>Good workers.</li>
</ol>
<p>So what is the solution Shelby proposes?</p>
<p>Defenestrate the workers. (Is anyone surprised that <a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2008/11/the-wisdom-of-b.html">Tyler Cowen</a>, <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/11/bruce-bartlett.html">Bruce Bartlett</a>, and <a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2008/11/cost-differences.html">Greg Mankiw</a> appear to endorse this idea?)</p>
<p>The strange thing is that if you follow Mankiw&#8217;s link into CATO-land, you find the &#8220;dinosaurs&#8221; argument <a href="http://www.autoobserver.com/2007/05/harbour-toyota-most-productive----by-a-hair.html">falling apart</a>:
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/SSE83bzN2EI/AAAAAAAAAOU/xvxnHEIFszY/s1600-h/Auto+Maker+Productivity.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/SSE83bzN2EI/AAAAAAAAAOU/xvxnHEIFszY/s400/Auto+Maker+Productivity.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />As the article accompanying this table notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Two significant factors jump out of the data: the gap among the six is narrowing – the narrowest margin since the study began in 1989; and the domestics, albeit they had the most improvement required, have made dramatic progress.</p>
<p>The gap in 2007 is a scant five labor hours, roughly, from No. 6 Ford to No. 1 Toyota. Harbour [Consulting] said that amounts to no more than a $250 to $300 per vehicle cost disadvantage to the domestics.</p></blockquote>
<p>So the workers are (in general) performing better and even the complete cf that is F is not severely underperforming the market (though its moves in the past five years have borne a rather bitter fruit, judging by the production numbers).</p>
<p>In short, the work is being done, and being done well.  It&#8217;s the management that has, for the past 25-plus years, misallocated funds to itself.  Looks as if it&#8217;s an industry that is a prime candidate for a bailout that puts a tight lease on the self-indulgent management.  What&#8217;s the phrase, &#8220;<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/politicsNews/idUSTRE4A66VT20081113">auto czar</a>&#8220;?</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s even ignoring any <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/16/opinion/16clark.html?pagewanted=print">national security considerations</a> (h/t <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2008/11/whats-good-for.html">Mark Thoma</a>):<br />
<blockquote>But in 1991, the Persian Gulf war demonstrated the awesome utility of American land power, and the Humvee (and its civilian version, the Hummer) became a star. Likewise, the ubiquitous homemade bombs of the current Iraq insurgency have led to the development of innovative armor-protected wheeled vehicles for American forces, as well as improvements in our fleets of Humvees, tanks, armored fighting vehicles, trucks and cargo carriers. </p>
<p>In a little more than a year, the Army has procured and fielded in Iraq more than a thousand so-called mine-resistant ambush-protected vehicles. The lives of hundreds of soldiers and marines have been saved, and their tasks made more achievable, by the efforts of the American automotive industry. And unlike in World War II, America didn’t have to divert much civilian capacity to meet these military needs. Without a vigorous automotive sector, those needs could not have been quickly met.</p></blockquote>
<p>I guess <a href="http://capitalgainsandgames.com/blog/andrew-samwick/630/big-three-quit-your-panhandling">Andrew Samwick&#8217;s &#8220;team-crafted in Indiana&#8221; Subaru</a>** really isn&#8217;t fungible with a Dodge Magnum or even a <a href="http://www.channel4.com/4car/di/road+test/driving+impression/1102/1">GM Daewoo Nubria</a>. </p>
<p>*I&#8217;m inclined to argue that they do innovate, but much of the evidence to which one might point is not in the U.S. market.  So let&#8217;s leave <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/11/gm-chrysler-in-canada-news-on-cbc.html">Stormy&#8217;s post</a>—specifically, &#8220;[Canadian Minister of Industry] Tony Clement is well aware that the auto industry must transform itself&#8221;—as the AB position-of-record, subject to new information.)</p>
<p>**At least Samwick and I agree on choice of car.</p>
