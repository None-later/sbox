<blockquote>What a load of bollocks.</p>
<p>The &#8220;principles of economics&#8221; that [N. Gregory] Mankiw champions, and the &#8220;More economic research (and teaching)&#8221; that [Doug] McTaggart et al are calling for, are the major reason why economists in general were oblivious to this crisis until well after it had broken out.</p>
<p>If they meant &#8220;Principles of Hyman Minsky’s Financial Instability Hypothesis&#8221;, or &#8220;More Post Keynesian and Evolutionary economic research&#8221;, there might be some validity to their claims. But what they really mean is &#8220;principles of neoclassical economics&#8221; and &#8220;More neoclassical economic research (and teaching)&#8221;—precisely the stuff that led to this crisis in the first place.

                                <p>Via <a target="_blank" href="http://www.eschatonblog.com/2009/05/stabilization.html">Dr. Black</a>, those RBC models <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/23/business/economy/23charts.html?hp">may be missing a variable or two</a>:<br />
<blockquote>In April, the rate in the United States rose to 8.9 percent. When the European figures are compiled, it seems likely that the American rate will be higher for the first time since Eurostat began compiling the numbers in 1993&#8230;.</p>
<p>First, it appears that the safety nets in many Western European economies made it easier for people to keep their jobs as the economy declined. In Germany, programs allow companies to get government help in paying workers, for example, keeping them employed. If the recession becomes severe enough and long enough, of course, it could turn out those programs do not so much avoid the pain as defer it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Because the alternatives are either direct government unemployment benefits on top of a decrease in GDP or a decline in social welfare with generational implications.<br />
<blockquote>Another factor may be the lack of an economic boom in many European countries, which has left them less vulnerable to recession-related cutbacks.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ah, pure RBC theory: the seeds of the next recession are sown in the economic growth that preceded it, even if that growth was somewhat enhanced by long-term liabilities:
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/Shb5wrAf9pI/AAAAAAAAASQ/Z2kPhmKbXb8/s1600-h/Fed+and+Hhold+Debt+since+2001.JPG"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/Shb5wrAf9pI/AAAAAAAAASQ/Z2kPhmKbXb8/s400/Fed+and+Hhold+Debt+since+2001.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Interesting, not unrelated, notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Then, the United States had an unemployment rate of 4.7 percent, lower than all but three of the 15 European Union countries — Denmark, the Netherlands and Ireland — and equal to that of a fourth, Luxembourg.</p>
<p>As the graphic shows, the March rate for the United States was higher than the rates of 11 of the 15. The exceptions were Portugal, which has the same rate, and Spain, Ireland and France.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Irish story was truly a country-wide &#8220;<a target="_blank" href="http://conservablogs.com/theconservativecrawfish/2007/05/01/matt-lauer-leaves-out-truth-in-irish-miracle/">miracle</a>,&#8221; now featuring both higher highs and lower lows than even the U.S.<br />
<blockquote>Spain and Ireland, two of the highest unemployment countries in Western Europe, suffered housing booms and busts that were comparable to the cycle in the United States.</p></blockquote>
<p>Spanish banks hit the news <a target="_blank" href="http://www.reuters.com/article/rbssFinancialServicesAndRealEstateNews/idUSLJ8401420090519">earlier this week</a>. U.S. banks are evermore heavily subsidized by the U.S. taxpayer (or that taxpayer&#8217;s debt; see above).  Or, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Conversations-Economists-Classical-Controversy-Macroeconomics/dp/0865981558/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&#038;s=books&#038;qid=1243020864&#038;sr=1-7">as Robert Lucas told Arjo Klamer in May of 1982</a>:<br />
<blockquote>But I don&#8217;t think unemployment is at the center of the story [of the Great Depression]. For those who do think it is the center, I can see why they don&#8217;t look to me for enlightment.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>I&#8217;m not really paying attention to (major league) baseball this year, so I should probably leave this to <a target="_blank" href="http://lefarkins.blogspot.com/">Scott</a>, but, as a query:</p>
<p>For all team that was supposed to have had a major improvement in its middle relief this year, the Yankees appear to have given up a large number (>=7) of runs in the middle and late innings this year.</p>
<p>Is Alan Greenspan the Yankee pitching coach, and assuring the von Steingrabbers that such &#8220;bubbles&#8221; are &#8216;Once in a Century&#8217; moments?</p>

                                <p>Ken Houghton lowers the level of discourse at AB by discussing the career of a porn star other than Adam West.</p>
<p>One of the primary tenets of economic theory is that corporations believe in nothing other than profits.  Well, it&#8217;s not quite that stark—we use phrases such as &#8220;utility maximization,&#8221; &#8220;cost minimization,&#8221; and the like—but the basic idea is that corporations, even more than individuals (silly humans!), have as their sole target maximizing profits.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;m a bit confused <a target="_blank" href="http://www.vancouversun.com/business/Interracial+porn+pioneer+Marilyn+Chambers+dead/1492289/story.html">by the Vancouver Sun&#8217;s poorly-edited* obituary for Marilyn Chambers</a>.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s put the timeline together:
<ol>
<li>Chambers &#8220;began her onscreen career as an Ivory Snow detergent model.&#8221;</p>
</li>
<li>Chambers made <a href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0068260/">Behind the Green Door</a>, released in 1972.
</li>
<li>The movie &#8220;prompted a run on boxes of Ivory Snow, which featured a photo of Chambers.&#8221;
<p>So far I follow this: actress tries a different role, reaches a whole new audience, and sales of her previous works soar. (Think Kristin Chenoweth <a target="_blank" href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0259145/">going from Broadway to television</a>. Or maybe not.)  What I don&#8217;t understand is the reaction:</p>
</li>
<li>[T]he scandal produced &#8220;a Marilyn Chambers clause in all modeling contracts, saying that you can never have posed topless or nude or been in any kind of adult film or Playboy or anything like that.&#8221;</li>
</ol>
<p>Let&#8217;s review. M<s>K</s>arilyn Chambers (h/t Tony C.) causes a major spike in sales of Ivory Snow detergent.  Better yet, some of those people probably aren&#8217;t even going to open the box, so they&#8217;re going to have to buy another detergent as well—<strong>and</strong>, even time they have to go shopping, they&#8217;re going to see that Ivory Snow detergent and, if they need detergent, they&#8217;ll have an identification with it.</p>
<p>UPDATE: Robert, <a href="http://www.haloscan.com/comments/angrybear/4640988825698905261/">in comments</a>, notes that this may be a rational act, if we assume normal market segmentation and a lack of loyalty on the part of the spurt of buying.</p>
<p>I believe this is what economists refer to as a &#8220;win-win&#8221; situation.</p>
<p>So why would the result be a &#8220;business decision&#8221; specifically banning the possibility  of developing such cross-marketing potential in the future?</p>
<p>*I say poorly edited because on things such as that the last sentence of paragraph three is &#8220;The L.A. County coroner is examining the cause of death, but a spokesman said foul play is not suspected.&#8221; and the closing of paragraph four is &#8220;The cause of death is under investigation but foul play was not suspected and an autopsy is pending,&#8221; which strikes as the equivalent of giving the reader a sense of deja vu through stereotomy glasses.</p>

<p>What is now the top line is total government debt.  The bottom line in Publicly-Held Government Debt.  <s>The lines become bold as of</s>There is now a dividing line at FY 1984, which began  <s>the year</s> after the Greenspan Commission put a regressive tax on low- and mid-level wage earners which was supposed to prefund their (our) retirement needs.</p>
<p>The difference between the two lines is the money that has been contributed to the Social Security Trust Fund in order to &#8220;save&#8221; it.*</p>
<p>*The Greenspan Commission was clear on this, requiring that, as of 1993, the President&#8217;s Budget Proposal note both the real (i.e., ex-SocSec overpayment) deficit as well as the nominal one, precisely <em>because</em> they did not want the system to be gamed.</p>

<blockquote>In certain ZIP codes in places like Homestead and Florida City, around 25 percent of the homes are in one stage of foreclosure or another. Countless others were built by developers and sit vacant in ghostly subdivisions, with not a buyer in sight.</p>
<p>In the days after Andrew, then-Dade County Emergency Management Director Kate Hale famously said on national TV: &#8221;Where the hell is the cavalry on this one?&#8221;</p>
<p>The same could be asked now, in this new disaster. People in south Miami-Dade &#8212; just like people in foreclosure-strewn cities across the nation &#8212; are wondering: How did we get here?</p></blockquote>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.miamiherald.com/sports/baseball/story/965187.html">Fantasy</a> (via <a target="_blank" href="http://sports-law.blogspot.com/2009/03/marlins-new-stadium-deal-worst-in.html">The Sports Law Blog</a>):<br />
<blockquote>The stadium did undergo some renovations in 1999 to make it more baseball-friendly, but the Marlins have been drawing low attendance figures. The Marlins averaged 16,688 fans last year, their third straight season averaging under 17,000 per home contest.</p></blockquote>
<p>As Marc Edelman notes at the link above:<br />
<blockquote>Last year, the Marlins team payroll was just $22 million&#8230;by far the lowest in the league. Rather than investing in their own team, Marlins President David Samson often used the threat of keeping a low payroll as part of his strategy in demanding public subsidies.</p></blockquote>
<p>Miami-Dsde officials, as those from Montreal know well, must be really stupid if they think Jeffrey Loria is going to invest in making the team competitive just because they just wrote him a Very Large Check.  Then again, maybe they figure one more vacant property won&#8217;t make a difference.</p>

<p>My effort immediately below to explain some general equilibrium theory in English didn&#8217;t work out so well.  Here I will attempt to give simple examples which show how rational individual choice and/or trade between rational consenting adults can make everyone worse off.</p>
<p>Models will all involve strange fruit trees, that is assets which generate goods without labor.  There will be only 2 periods.  In the first period (period 0) agents plant trees and maybe buy and sell them.  It is allowed to short an apple tree (that is to promise to deliver the apples even if you don&#8217;t own the tree).  </p>
<p>Then in period 1 the trees produce fruit.  The amount depends on the state of the world (that is say the weather).  People fulfill the terms of their financial agreements.  Then people trade fruit on the spot market.  Then people eat the fruit giving them their only pleasure in the whole model. Then they die.</p>
<p>If there are so many different kinds of trees that, for each state of the world, one can construct a portfolio which pays a positive amount in that state and only in that state, then markets are complete and the free market outcome is Pareto efficient.  Otherwise it is easy to come up with examples in which rational behavior in period 0 makes everyone worse off in expected value.</p>
<p>One Example after the jump (I will add more when my fingers stop aching).</p>
<p>drought resistent apple trees.  Here there are only 2 states : in state 1 it rains a lot on the apple orchards, in state 2 it rains little.  The only choice in period zero is that people with apple suitable land have to decide wether to grow drought resistant apple trees which get mold if it is wet or drought sensitive apple trees which do great if it is wet.  People who grow apples get sick of them and don&#8217;t want to eat them.  They just eat the other good (oranges).  There are always the same number of oranges.  Orange growers have utility which is cobb douglas in apples and oranges.</p>
<p>Now if all apple growers plant drought resistent apples they all face no risk.  If there are half as many apples, the relative price of apples doubles.  They always eat the same number of oranges (and no apples they don&#8217;t like apples).  If one apple grower plants any drought sensitive apples and their is a drought, he will suffer.  If apple growers are risk averse enough, all drought resistant apples will be an equilibrium.</p>
<p>The orange growers face risk.  They always eat the same number of oranges but eat different numbers of apples depending on whether there is a drought.</p>
<p>A Pareto improvement is possible.  If all the apple growers plant half and half drought resistent and drought sensitive apples, then they are still safe and so are the orange growers.  This is a Pareto improvement.</p>

                                <p>Robert Waldmann</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not kidding.  Someone in some thread said that he or she thought it would be great if I could give a simple intuitive explanation of <a target="_blank" href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&#038;lr=&#038;q=geanakoplos+polemarchakis&#038;btnG=Search">Geanakoplos and Polemarchakis (1985)</a>.  Also I would get an interesting perspective on the crisis if I could fly to the moon.</p>
<p>I will try after the jump.  The G&#038;P result is that, if markets are incomplete, unless there is an amazing coincidence, there exists a regulation of financial markets which makes everyone better off than laissez faire.  </p>
<p>This does not mean we should decide to regulate.  The fact that such a regulation exists, doesn&#8217;t mean that it will be implemented if we just convince people that laissez faire is not optimal. It doesn&#8217;t even mean that economists can figure out a Pareto improving regulation and the problem is that those rotten politicians won&#8217;t implement it.  Thus the result has only one practical application.  If someone says that econmic theory or common sense tell us that free interactions of rational people must be in the interests of those rational people &#8212; that person has just said that he doesn&#8217;t know what he is talking about.  This is not a judgment call. There is a mathematical proof.</p>
<p>Before the jump, I will just notice that there are many reasons why free market outcomes are presumably not Pareto efficient.  The list of sufficient conditions in the most general description of economies with Pareto efficient market outcomes is very long, and for each sufficient condition for optimality it is easy to construct examples where, if the condition doesn&#8217;t hold, regulation can be good for everyone.</p>
<p>The requirements are rational expectations, well defined property rights, price taking behavior (which is really stronger than saying no agent has market power), no nonpecuniary externalities which implies, among other things, that people have no sense of pity and don&#8217;t mind knowing that others are starving, symmetric information and, finally, complete markets.</p>
<p>After the jump I will consider only the implications of incomplete markets as the assumption of complete markets &#8212; that for every distinguishable state of the world there is an asset which pays a positive return in that state and only in that state &#8212; is so absurdly false that no one claims it is a good approximation.</p>
<p>OK so the problem is to explain how rational choice by price taking agents with well defined property rights and symmetric information whose happiness depends only on their consumption leisure and whose actions don&#8217;t cause externalities except via prices (from now on RCBPTETC)can make all these agents worse off than they would be if the rational choices were constrained by a regulator who knows know more than they do and who can&#8217;t introduce new assets (like social insurance) which weren&#8217;t available to the private agents (from now on a RWKNETC).</p>
<p>The problem is that the proof really is based on an argument like &#8220;we have N inequalities and more than N variables so, generically, we can find variables such that all N inequalities are satisfied.&#8221; This is not intuitive.  I was asked for examples, but I won&#8217;t get to them in this post.  I will try to give examples in the next post.</p>
<p>I will define my terms (search for EOD to skip this part)</p>
<p>1. Price Taking:  Agents decide what to do given prices, including prices of financial assets and their exactly accurate forecasts of future prices as a function of the state of nature.  They assume that they can buy or sell any amount at current prices and ignore any effect that their buying and selling might have on prices.  The bolded passage is necessary for Pareto efficiency in a one period model without uncertainty (a model without financial markets).  It is also key to proving that equilibrium with financial markets is almost certainly inefficient.  Oh note this is describing free markets.  If goods are rationed by the regulator, agents know that they are.</p>
<p>2. Symmetric information: agents may not know much but they have the same information.  This, along with rationality means that they have the same accurate belief about the probability that something will happen.  With asymmetric information, insurance markets which are good for everyone can fail to exist due to the adverse selection death spiral.  Forcing all people to participate in such markets can be good for everyone.</p>
<p>3. Well defined property rights:  IIRC An assumption in all proofs that the market outcome is inefficient is that agents have an endowment and can choose to consume exactly that endowment neither buying nor selling.  This is related to externalities.  If anyone is free to pollute the air, then the good &#8220;clean air&#8221; doesn&#8217;t belong to anyone in particular.  If fish in the sea belong to no one in particular, there will be overfishing &#8212; that is all people including fisherman might be helped by restrictions on catches.</p>
<p>4. Externalities include envy, shame at one&#8217;s unearned good fortune and pity.  If people mind knowing that other people are starving, a world without starvation is a public good.  I help you if I give food to the starving.  Even if I care as much about you as I do about the starving person, if I care more about myself, then we can all be made happier by taxing each other to end starvation (and the formerly starving would be much happier).  The sort of externality that is assumed not to exist in proofs of the Pareto efficiency of the market outcome is any interest in anything except my own consumption and leisure.  Note not that people aren&#8217;t selfless but that we are completely totally absolutely selfish.  </p>
<p>Becker showed that the results can be generalized if people are divided into non overlapping sets (called &#8220;families&#8221;) where people only care about other people in their own set and someone in each set cares enough that if you take from someone else in the set and give to them, they will choose to give it back.  This is still very strong. He assumed that families don&#8217;t overlap (wonder if Becker explained that to his in-laws).</p>
<p>5. The regulator doesn&#8217;t know anything that the private agents don&#8217;t know.  This seems clear.  If the regulator knows better, then she can force people to do things which are in their interests but they don&#8217;t know it.  This result will interest no one who observes the actual senate actually legislating.</p>
<p>6. This corresponds to the &#8220;constrained&#8221; in Geanokoplos and Polemarchakis title.  The point is that, if there are incomplete markets, except for an amazing coincidence, making the markets complete *and* lump sum taxes and transfers can make everyone better off.  It makes the challenge of finding a Pareto improvement harder in an important way as one way in which public intervention is widely believed to have made us better off is by introducing new kinds of insurance such as unemployment insurance.  That&#8217;s too easy for G and P.</p>
<p>7. Pareto efficient:  Look this is a very weak claim.  It doesn&#8217;t mean efficient in any normal sense of the word.  A Pareto improvement (making everyone better off) is interesting.  The result that no Pareto improvement is possible (Pareto efficiency) isn&#8217;t interesting at all.</p>
<p>8: except for amazing coincidences.  This is an effort at an Egnlish translation for &#8220;generically&#8221; which means &#8220;for an open and dense set of economies.&#8221;  The claim is be &#8221; if for some set of tastes technology and endowments the market outcome(s) isn&#8217;t (aren&#8217;t) constrained Pareto efficient, then there is a change in endowments so tiny that, after the change in endowments, the new economy has a market outcome which isn&#8217;t constrained Pareto efficient (or many outcomes which aren&#8217;t).&#8221;  That means the set of economies with constrained Pareto inefficient outcomes is open.  Also if there is an economy with a constrained Pareto efficient outcome, there is a tiny change (as tiny as you want) in endowments so that with the new endowments the outcome of the new economy is constrained Pareto inefficient (that&#8217;s the dense part).</p>
<p>EOD</p>
<p>OK the idea of the G&#038;P result.  First the model is a general equilibrium market with financial assets.  The idea is that there are 2 periods, period 0 and period 1.  IN period 0 agents trade financial assets which are all in zero net supply.  The state the world will be in in period 1 is not known but everyone knows the probability of any possible state.  Assets have payouts which depend on the state of the world.  After the uncertainty is resolved (that is in period 1) agents buy and sell goods on ordinary spot markets, then they consume, then the universe ends.  General equilibrium theorists claim that theis simple structure isn&#8217;t really as restrictive as it seems.</p>
<p>The point is that trades in the financial assets in period 0 will generally affect the prices in period 1 except in the case of amazing coincidences.  One such amazing coincidence if if everyone has identical homothetic preferences so aggregate excess demand is a function of the aggregate endowment and relative prices (so demand can be represented as demand by a representative consumer).  In this case only transfering wealth from one person to another (what financial assets do) can have no effect on spot prices in period 1.</p>
<p>So generically decisions made in period 0 will affect spot market prices in period 1.  This is a pecuniary externality.</p>
<p>Now if we just look at one state of the world in period 1, there will be no way to make everyone better off by messing around with trade on the spot market in period 1.  By then the economy has become a one period Walrasian economy with a Pareto efficient market outcome.  </p>
<p>If the regulator messes with trade in financial assets in period 0 then some people iwll be richer and some poorer in some realizations (say one called s) of the state of the world in period 1.  If these people have different tastes or if the distribution of wealth affects demand (as in some goods are luxuries) then this will affect spot prices in those states.  The change in spot prices will help people who are selling goods whose relative price goes up and hurt people whose are buying those goods.  That effect, the change in spot prices due to changes in trade in financial assets in period 1, will move the state s outcome from one Pareto efficient outcome to another.  It will help some people and hurt others.  </p>
<p>As always, it might increase the happiness of the people it helps by a tiny number of utils and hurt the people it hurts by a huge number of utils.  That is Pareto efficient is a very weak result.  To be more exact, choose one good and call it the numeraire.  the market outcome in state s will maximize the weighted sum of utility of all the agents with weights equal to the inverse of that agents marginal utility of consumption of the numeraire good in state s. </p>
<p>This means in each state a weighted sum of utility will be maximized but the weights will, in general, be different for different states (with low weight in state s on the utility of an agent who is poor in state s)</p>
<p>The key point is that we know that the indirect effects on utility of messing with financial markets through spot prices will be of different signs for different agents in each state, but we don&#8217;t know anything about the effect on expected utility. Each agent knows that she will be helped some times and hurt some times, but knows nothing about the probability weighted average effect on utility.</p>
<p>OK so to get to the result that messing with what people buy and sell on the financial market (making them hold different amounts of financial assets than they want to) can make them all better off it is necessary to have 2 things.</p>
<p>1. The relative weights on different agents are different in different states.  If there are complete markets, then the relative weights will always be the same (the weights are constants all multiplied by the same state specific factor for each agent).  So the market outcome is Pareto efficient.</p>
<p>2. There have to be enough assets that the arbitrary vectors of changes in welfare do to messing around with portfolios are numerous enough that a linear combination of such changes adds up to a vector with all positive elements &#8212; that is a Pareto improvement.</p>
<p>The theorem requires an assumption about the number of assets compared to the number of different types of agents.  Dimensions of messing with portfolios will be something like number of assets times number of agents minus 1 (because the assets are in zero net supply).  There are as many inequalities to satisfy to get a Pareto improvement as there are agents.  </p>
<p>Except for amazing coincidences, you can satisfy N inequalities if you have N unknowns so basically it is needed that the numbers of dimensions of meddling with portfolios is greater than the number of different types of agents.</p>

                                <p>Via <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2009/02/executive-pay.html">Mark Thoma</a>, Uwe Reinhardt* hits one out of the park on <a href="http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/02/06/supply-demand-and-executive-pay/">economist&#8217;s research abilities</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Evidently, in the mind of economists, Lone Ranger C.E.O.’s can make truly astronomical contributions to a firm’s market capitalization, ceteris paribus, which justifies high bid prices for them. Why Lone Ranger C.E.O.’s who have trashed their firm’s market capitalization should be sent off to pasture with hundred-million-dollar golden parachutes — which occurs with remarkable frequency — seems to be not much analyzed by economists. Perhaps other things did not remain equal. [emphasis mine]</p></blockquote>
<p>Or, as Warren Buffett famously observed (roughly): &#8220;If a good manager goes to a bad company, it is generally the reputation of the manager that is changed.&#8221;**  And even Michael Porter, who never saw a manager he didn&#8217;t like, <a href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article.cfm?articleid=1594">recently changed his tune</a>:<br />
<blockquote>When Porter started out studying strategy, he believed most strategic errors were caused by external factors, such as consumer trends or technological change. &#8220;But I have come to the realization after 25 to 30 years that many, if not most, strategic errors come from within. The company does it to itself.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Those of us who know that economists use thr phrase &#8220;technological change&#8221; because &#8220;magic&#8221; would get them laughed out of meetings can only say, &#8220;Gee, Really?&#8221;</p>
<p>Reinhardt also notes that Robert Frank cites the Gabaix/Lander &#8220;study&#8221; of executive compensation. Reinhardt notes:<br />
<blockquote>Readers may wonder about the survival of this theory, even among economists, as stock prices have begun to tumble sharply, starting in 2007.</p></blockquote>
<p>Since I don&#8217;t feel like retreading, here are links to <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/05/why-has-ceo-pay-increased-so-much.html">PGL here in 2007</a> and Tom at the Legacy Blog in <a href="http://atbozzo.blogspot.com/2006/05/news-flash-ceos-are-overpaid.html">2006</a>, <a href="http://atbozzo.blogspot.com/2007/05/from-archives-on-gabaix-and-landier-on.html">2007</a>, and <a href="http://atbozzo.blogspot.com/2008/04/bad-penny.html">2008</a>.</p>
<p>Reinhardt continues:<br />
<blockquote>Readers may also wonder why, in the United States, the ratio of total executive compensation (including bonuses and deferred compensation, pensions and perks) to the comparable figure earned by non-management employees rose from 50 in 1980 to 301 by 2003 for the 300 to 400 largest corporations (and to 500 in very large corporations), while that ratio typically has remained so much lower in Europe and in Asia. Are corporate executives in Europe and Asia so vastly inferior to their American counterparts, or is the supply of potential C.E.O.’s so much larger there as to drive down the ratio in, say, Japan, to as low a 3?</p></blockquote>
<p>Reinhardt promises to talk about the cl*st*rf*ck that is GE (last discussed by me <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/01/ratings-stocks-and-credibility.html">here</a>) in his next post.</p>
<p>Pass the popcorn.</p>
<p>*Note to Canadian readers:I&#8217;m told he&#8217;s the Bob Evans of Health Economists in the U.S.</p>
<p>**Of course, if Bob Nardelli trashes Home Depot and then goes to finish the trashing of Chrysler, he gets richer and it&#8217;s an outlier in the database (which has a growing number of outliers).</p>
