                                <p>I posted this <a href="http://lancemannion.typepad.com/lance_mannion/2008/10/bailing-furious.html">in comments</a> at <a href="http://lancemannion.typepad.com/lance_mannion/">Lance&#8217;s place</a>, but figure to run it up the flag here as well.</p>
<p>Speaking as one who supported Monday&#8217;s bill and generally opposes today&#8217;s, here&#8217;s the high-level list of reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>It wasn&#8217;t going to authorize the whole $700B, but about$250B, with renewal (or scrapping) to follow.  (That Henry Paulson was an idiot in his pitch, and that that pitch has been perpetuated to the detriment of sanity, was <a href="http://capitalgainsandgames.com/blog/stan-collender/555/what-we-have-here-failure-communicate">documented by Stan Collender</a>.)</li>
<li>Even a broken clock is right once or twice a day.  Yes, the administration cried &#8220;Wolf,&#8221; but the tense of your post is incorrect—banks are <em>already</em> not loaning to creditworthy entities.</li>
<li>What made it worse is that about two weeks ago, they decided not to loan <em>to each other</em>.  Or to do so only at (relatively) ridiculously high rates.</li>
<li>Subnote of the above:  My HELOC is currently somewhere between 3.75 and 4.75%.  Which means that I could borrow $25K or $50K or $100K on it, invest that money at LIBOR, and <em><strong>make a profit</strong></em>.  That&#8217;s the type of thing I mean when I say the markets are too out of kilter.  The market seems to believe that I am a better credit than, say, Citigroup.</li>
<li>They may be right.</li>
</ol>
<p>On the bill itself:
<ol>
<li>Krugman is right.  It&#8217;s not good—the current &#8220;pitch&#8221; is economically inaccurate; George W. Bush was more correct than Henry Paulson on what would work—but it was probably the best we were going to get as a bipartisan effort.</li>
<li>There were conditions in it that should have ensured, on balance, that the taxpayer ended up with a significant equity participation in the firms that were saved.  (Dodd&#8217;s addition: 1.25(Y-X) in company stock for every dollar lost between the purchase and the final sale, was inspired.)</li>
<li>There were restrictions—not so strong as I&#8217;d like, but restrictions at least—on the bailout monies going to the high-level execs who have mismanaged those firms for the past several years.</li>
<li>If it&#8217;s not a bipartisan effort, then the Republicans are going to hang it on the Democratic Party for the next 34 days, even though their people are the ones who said it was necessary.</li>
<li>Given (1) and (4), the alternative when the bill failed was one of two things: (a) take the <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/09/time-not-for-a.html">Brad DeLong approach</a> or (b) introduce a ill that <strong>looks like</strong> a bill that <a href="http://www.eschatonblog.com/2008_09_28_archive.html#4958501322080983185">Democrats would support</a>: fund infrastructure, extend unemployment benefits, put more money in the hands of people who are (to borrow a phrase) &#8220;liquidity constrained&#8221;—that is, the people who will <em>spend</em> it.  It will end up in the same place—on some bank&#8217;s balance sheet—and have at least done some good.  And then <strong>dare</strong> Republicans to veto—or run against—the bill.  (Fairness note: Domenici&#8217;s addition in the Senate fits well in that group.)</li>
<li>They didn&#8217;t do either of those.  They made it a bill that appeals more to the Republican money-base&#8217;s interest, and does even less for the credit crisis than the previous one did.</li>
<li>I realise the essence of the argument is &#8220;Wasting $400B or so of a $700B bill is all right, but wasting $500-550B of an $850B bill isn&#8217;t.&#8221;  But the original bill was, as Krugman noted, <em>marginally</em> acceptable.  The current one is well over the margin and into &#8220;unfunded giveaways that won&#8217;t support the economy or increase the velocity of money.&#8221;</li>
<li>That last point is essentially the argument of <a href="http://www.sabernomics.com/sabernomics/index.php/2008/10/a-smart-move-by-lohse-and-boras/">J. C. Bradbury in discussing Kyle Lohse&#8217;s new contract</a>: you could have a mediocre deal today, or a better one later.  Since it&#8217;s only going to get worse over the next few weeks, the chances of getting a better deal by waiting only go up. But apparently Hillary Clinton and Harry Reid decided not to go that way.</li>
</ol>
<p>Which, I would argue, is a mistake.</p>

<p>Claudia <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/09/delenda-est-republicano.html#722409">asks the question of the day of the previous post</a>:<br />
<blockquote>When you say &#8220;the coming harvest&#8221; are you speaking from a purely literal standpoint, or are you also speaking metaphorically?</p></blockquote>
<p>I was starting from the literal.  When you get to the consequences, then you get to think <a href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0533501/">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a>.</p>
<p>2slugbaits laid out <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/09/delenda-est-republicano.html#722388">exactly the scenario that makes early November too late</a>:<br />
<blockquote>The coming harvest may just rot in the fields. No liquidity, no market for the grain. And no loans to rent equipment to bring in the harvest.</p>
<p>I hope the Republican farmers in the red states are happy. Well, at least they&#8217;ll still have their shotguns&#8230;they may need them.</p></blockquote>
<p>I pointed this out to someone today, who started ranting about farm subsidies and how the farmers won&#8217;t suffer, so we&#8217;ll do this slowly, just in case:
<ol>
<li>Farm subsidies are an atrocious waste of money, and badly allocated.</li>
<li><em>However</em>, farm subsidies are either (a) payments made to farmers not to grow (keeping prices higher, and theoretically also ensuring the land isn&#8217;t depleted) or (b) additional payments <em>for crops that are harvested and delivered to market</em>.</li>
<li>Therefore, by and large, farm subsidies are irrelevant to the harvesting of crops. And that is the subject of the day.</li>
</ol>
<p>What often happens in farm country is that farmers plant, tend, and fertilize out of last year&#8217;s earnings.  By the time you get to the harvest, though, they tend to be tapped out.</p>
<p>Fortunately, they have several thousand dollars worth of crops in the fields.  So they go to the bank and say, &#8220;Lend me enough money to get through the harvest&#8221;—so I can pay workers and/or rent equipment, sort and allocate grain from chaff, get the crops to the market, and get paid for them—&#8221;and I&#8217;ll pay you back in November/December.&#8221;</p>
<p>Banks, knowing this is as close to a risk-free short-term loan as there is in commercial lending, generally loan the money.</p>
<p>But they won&#8217;t do it at any reasonable rate if they&#8217;re going to get hammered over the short-term.  Which means there will be farmers who can&#8217;t harvest, crops left in the fields, and higher food prices.</p>
<p>Anyone have any further questions about how Wall Street affects Main Street?</p>
<p>Come to think of it:</p>

                                <p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Not even <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122230374700773663.html?mod=djemEditorialPage">the Wall Street Journal editorial page</a> fell for McCain&#8217;s &#8220;reasoning&#8221;:<br />
<blockquote>So count us as mystified by Senator John McCain&#8217;s decision yesterday to suspend his campaign and call for a postponement in Friday&#8217;s first Presidential debate so that he and Barack Obama can work out a consensus bill to stabilize the financial system. This is supposed to be evidence of leadership?</p></blockquote>
<p>I was muddling through some papers this afternoon, so I missed everything after John &#8220;Coming to the Wry&#8221; McCain&#8217;s decision that, after he got schooled by a comedienne, he needed a excuse to skip tomorrow night&#8217;s scheduled debate. Fortunately, Brad DeLong <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/09/john-mccain-a-s.html">covered that part</a>, including <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/09/senator-durbin.html">the sane reaction to McCain&#8217;s &#8220;I will bring my superpowers to bear&#8221; statement</a>:<br />
<blockquote>It&#8217;s not economic leadership that Senator McCain would bring to these negotiations; it&#8217;s presidential politics – which is the last thing we need if we really want to solve the serious problems our nation faces.</p></blockquote>
<p>But the Word of the Day goes to <a href="http://www.portfolio.com/views/blogs/market-movers/2008/09/24/dont-panic">Felix Salmon</a>:<br />
<blockquote>I have a feeling I know what President Bush is going to say in his address to the nation tonight, but the single biggest message has already been sent, thanks to his decision to schedule the last-minute broadcast coming on the same day as John McCain announced he was suspending his presidential campaign to try to wrestle the bailout to the ground. The message is the same as the one sent by Hank Paulson over the weekend, when he asked for unprecedented power and unaccountability in structuring the bailout fund. And the message is not one that politicians should be sending:</p>
<p>Panic!</p></blockquote>
<p>After saying nice things about Chris Dodd and Barack Obama, who have stayed focussed, Salmon returned to McCain, and used a form of That Word again:<br />
<blockquote>McCain&#8217;s statement, in this context, was truly unhelpful. This is panicky, not constructive:<br />
<blockquote>It has become clear that no consensus has developed to support the Administration&#8217;s proposal. I do not believe that the plan on the table will pass as it currently stands, and we are running out of time.</p></blockquote>
<p>This strikes me as a profound misreading of the public&#8217;s mood, a bit like Rudy Giuliani&#8217;s decision to try to extend his second and final term as mayor on the grounds that only he was qualified to do the job. America does not want to elect a politician who can&#8217;t help construct a bailout package without abandoning a foreign-policy debate. Nor should it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, I played volleyball while Bush fiddled.  Fortunately, <a href="http://norris.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/24/bush-on-bailouts/">Floyd Norris</a> got paid to watch tonight&#8217;s performance:<br />
<blockquote>President Bush tonight gave a reasonably good explanation of how we got into this “financial crisis,” even if his list of causes was a little selective. His first cause was the willingness of foreigners to lend us money, a problem that we must hope will continue as the Treasury tries to borrow $700 billion to finance this bailout&#8230;.</p>
<p>If there are any decisions his administration made that helped to worsen the situation, he did not mention them&#8230;.</p>
<p>In boosting his plan, he took credit for the idea that there should be limits on executive pay, which his administration had opposed until today. It would have been nice if he had conceded that was a change, but you can’t have everything.</p></blockquote>
<p>Situation Normal, down to the &#8220;his lips are moving&#8221; moment:<br />
<blockquote>The most jarring part of the speech was his statement that his plan called for the government to buy troubled mortgage assets “at current low prices” and hold them until the value rises. In fact, the basis of the proposal is to buy assets at well above current market value — called fire-sale prices by Ben Bernanke — and thus recapitalize the financial system. They hope the market value will rise above what they pay, but that is not the same as buying at current low prices. Does he not understand that, or does he not want to acknowledge it?</p></blockquote>
<p>I love questions for which there is no wrong answer.</p>

<p>It was five degrees (C) warmer here this morning than the previous two days of taking the Eldest Daughter to her school bus.</p>
<p>Presumably, this is balanced out in part by record-low temperatures in Hell, as the WSJ editorial page (well, Thomas Frank, but still&#8230;) summarizes <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122221440058969313.html?mod=djemEditorialPage">the McCain Position</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Last week, Republican presidential candidate John McCain called for a commission to &#8220;find out what went wrong&#8221; on Wall Street. It was an excellent suggestion: Public inquiries into Wall Street practices served the country well in the 1930s.</p>
<p>And Mr. McCain has a special advantage to bring to any such investigation &#8212; many of the relevant witnesses are friends or colleagues of his. In fact, he can probably get to the bottom of the whole mess just by cross-examining the people riding on his campaign bus. So the candidate should take a deep breath, remind himself that the country comes first, pull the Straight Talk Express over at a rest stop, whistle up his media pals, and begin.</p></blockquote>

<p>I don&#8217;t believe David Leonhardt is an idiot, but that&#8217;s not based on <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/24/business/24leonhardt.html?ref=business&#038;pagewanted=print">the evidence at hand</a>:<br />
<blockquote>There are really only two [questions]: What steps are most likely to solve the immediate crisis? And how can the long-term cost to taxpayers be minimized?</p>
<p>Everything else — reducing executive pay on Wall Street, changing the bankruptcy laws, somehow slowing the descent of home prices — is either a detail or a distraction.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let me say this slowly, so even a NYT reporter can understand it: If you are taking an equity stake in a firm, one factor is how much cash the firm will have on hand.  Cash paid to executives is not cash on hand, nor can it be used to produce future capital, investments, and free cashflow, or even &#8220;the miracle of compound interest.&#8221;  So executive pay is very much a factor in equity calculations.</p>
<p>Changing the bankruptcy laws is more tangential, but let&#8217;s again explain this slowly. Mortgage-backed securities are, well, backed by <em>mortgages</em>.  Their value depends directly on those payments.  If it becomes easier to workout a mortgage in bankruptcy court, the holders of those MBSes are liable to (1) receive a higher value and (2) know sooner how severely their securities are impaired.  So changing the bankruptcy law will, again, make the value of the assets clearer sooner.  <em>Which is especially important if we&#8217;re all going to pretend that this thing is going away after two years.</em>*</p>
<p>Slowing the descent of home prices—well, that&#8217;s a second-order effect, so I&#8217;ll agree with him there.  Or at least let it ride.**</p>
<p>His next paragraph, however, is incomprehensible:<br />
<blockquote>Usually, it would be easy enough to dismiss these sideshows as the inevitable gear-grinding of democracy. This is an extraordinary time, though. The credit markets are nearly dysfunctional, leaving the economy at risk of falling into a downturn unlike any most of us have lived through, and the government is about to commit billions of dollars after only a week of political debate. There&#8217;s no time to waste. [emphasis mine]</p></blockquote>
<p>Let&#8217;s be clear: the government (meaning here the Executive Branch and the Federal Reserve, controlled and run by Republicans) has <em><strong>already</strong></em> committed billions of dollars over the past six months. <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/09/900-billion-for-you-citizennever.html">Maybe $900,000,000,000</a>. During the entire time of which, Mr. Paulson was (1) certain the crisis was over and (2) working on the <s>idiocy</s> plan that he presented.</p>
<p>Leonhardt&#8217;s very next sentence undermines his previous paragraph.<br />
<blockquote>The first thing to understand is that a bailout plan doesn’t have to cost anywhere close to $700 billion, so long as it’s designed well. [italics mine]</p></blockquote>
<p>This is the plan that included absolute authority for the Secretary of the Treasury, and of which the Secretary of the Treasury said, &#8220;No, I&#8217;m not asking for absolute authority,&#8221; right?  I would again invoke Daniel Davies&#8217;s Three Laws, but Leonhardt wants us to believe that this time will be different, if the plan is well-designed.***<br />
<blockquote>Figuring out how much to pay for the assets is the first problem. The drop in house prices and rise in foreclosures have made it clear that these securities are worth considerably less than banks expected. But there is enormous uncertainty about how much less.</p></blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s why we have a market, no?  (Clearly, the answer will be &#8220;no.&#8221;)<br />
<blockquote>Based on the underlying fundamentals (like the current foreclosure rate and the one forecast for the future), many of the securities appear to be worth something on the order of 75 percent of their original value. But thanks to the fear now gripping the market — not necessarily an irrational fear, given that most forecasts have proven far too sunny over the last year — very, very few of those securities are trading hands. Among those that have, the sales price has been roughly 25 percent of the value. [I italicized, but he blocked it off in the first place; the bold is mine]</p></blockquote>
<p>So the market has a price, but Mr. Leonhardt wants us to believe that these securities could be worth three times as much.</p>
<p>Assume I do.  What should I be willing to pay for those securities? And what would I offer for them?</p>
<p>Now assume several of us believe that.  What will be we do?  Well, I&#8217;ll offer the current market price, Tom will offer 25.5, Robert will go 26, and pretty soon we&#8217;ll own all we want somewhere around 65.****</p>
<p>So where are the hedge funds and investment managers and new Vulture Funds?  Who believes these securities are worth 75?  Surely, they are willing to bid 25, 26, even 30.  Mr. Leonhardt doesn&#8217;t tell us.  In fact, the people who know the market best—Barack Obama&#8217;s classmate, <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/09/trickle-down-in-action.html">Tom Marano</a>, for instance—are retrenching, even after the first $900,000,000,000 in liquidity has been added.<br />
<blockquote> Which price is the government going to pay?&#8230;[I]t probably can&#8217;t pay 25 cents. That might fail to fix the credit markets, because it would do relatively little to improve financial firms’ balance sheets. Firms might then remain unwilling to lend money to businesses and households, which is the whole problem the bailout is meant to solve.</p></blockquote>
<p>Oh, wait.  I thought that list of side considerations above were unimportant; now it turns out they&#8217;re &#8220;the whole problem the bailout is meant to solve.&#8221;<br />
<blockquote> The most obvious solution is to pay more than 25 cents on the dollar and then demand something in return for the premium — namely, a stake in any firm that participates in the bailout. Congressional Democrats have been pushing for such a provision this week, and it’s one of the most important things they have done.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, that&#8217;s nice to know.  Too bad it wasn&#8217;t in the original &#8220;well-designed&#8221; plan.  I guess David Leonhardt believed Dick Fuld when he said he, er, gave at the office, too.<br />
<blockquote>The government would then be accomplishing three things at once. First, it would take possession of the bad assets now causing a panic on Wall Street. Second, it would inject cash into the financial system and help shore up firms’ balance sheets (which some economists think is actually a bigger problem than the bad assets).</p></blockquote>
<p>There&#8217;s a link to Krugman&#8217;s column on Monday omitted here.  But let&#8217;s look at what Leonhardt has just done:
<ol>
<li>He has admitted they are &#8220;bad assets,&#8221; while before they were just underpriced.</li>
<li>He has declared that it would &#8220;inject cash into the financial system,&#8221; rather ignoring (again) the previous $900,000,000,000 than the Fed has &#8220;injected&#8221; in lieu of easing rates further.</li>
<li>He has invoked &#8220;balance sheets,&#8221; for discussion of which I refer you to <a href="http://macroblog.typepad.com/macroblog/2008/09/the-left-and-ri.html">David Altig</a> (h/t <a href="http://www.portfolio.com/views/blogs/market-movers/2008/09/22/financial-one-liner-of-the-day?tid=true">Felix</a>)</li>
</ol>
<p>But the best is yet to come.<br />
<blockquote>And, third, it would go a long way toward minimizing the ultimate cost to taxpayers.</p></blockquote>
<p>Overpayment is good because we&#8217;ll get more back.  And I thought only Health Economics had an upward-sloping demand curve.<br />
<blockquote>Why? The more that the government overpays for the assets, the larger the subsidy it’s providing to Wall Street — and the more it is pushing up the share prices of Wall Street firms. As Senator Jack Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island, notes, the equity stakes allow the government to recapture some of the subsidy down the road. It’s a self-correcting mechanism.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s a good thing Leonhardt opened his piece by noting that Congresscritters don&#8217;t know much about the financial markets, but, really, couldn&#8217;t we expect more from Economics writers?******<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;Hey, Jack, if you pay me three times what this asset is worth in the market, I&#8217;ll give you an extra fifty cents six years from now.&#8221;<br />&#8220;Sounds like a great deal to me, Lloyd. And that writer in the Times thinks so too.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>So far, we have established that Paulson presented a plan that, if it had been well-designed, would be great.  So who is at fault?  Why, Congress, of course:<br />
<blockquote>Instead of a laserlike focus on the big issues, though, Congress has been devoting a good chunk of energy to secondary matters. Some of the proposals, like changing bankruptcy rules to help some homeowners avoid foreclosure, are perfectly reasonable but just won’t do much to cure the credit markets. Others may not even meet that standard.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let&#8217;s try this again. Homeowners who avoid foreclosure can, unlike those who don&#8217;t, pay their mortgage. Which monies flow to (wait for it) Mortgage-Backed Securities.  Which then gain value and can be sold at a higher price.  So, if you really want to reduce the cost of the bailout, keeping people out of foreclosure seems as if it would help. A lot more than seeing a stock price appreciate later, as was suggested <s>in that well-designed plan</s> <em>by Chris Dodd, Barack Obama, and Congress</em>.</p>
<p>And then Leonhardt just outright jumps the shark:<br />
<blockquote>One of the fashionable ideas of the week, supported by both Democratic leaders in Congress and John McCain, is to limit the pay of top executives at any Wall Street firm that sells assets to the government. </p></blockquote>
<p>Not even CNN fell for that one completely, despite their <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/09/23/campaign.wrap/index.html">idiotic headline</a>:<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;Contrary to the lies told by the McCain campaign, it was John McCain who followed Sen. Obama&#8217;s lead in laying out principles that call for strict oversight and accountability, protecting taxpayers and cracking down on CEO pay. We only wish he had adopted those same principles over the last 26 years rather than cheerleading for the deregulation agenda that helped produce today&#8217;s crisis and repeatedly opposing limitations on the obscene compensation given to failed CEOs.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>And it doesn&#8217;t take a long use of The Google (well, I just went to Brad DeLong&#8217;s site) <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/09/barack-obama-pr.html">to find, from Sunday night</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Rescue requires mutual responsibility. As taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary steps to protect our financial system, it is only appropriate to expect those institutions that benefit to help protect American homeowners and the American economy. We cannot underwrite continued irresponsibility, where CEOs cash in and our regulators look the other way. We cannot abet and reward the unconscionable practices that triggered this crisis. We have to end them. [italic mine]</p></blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s rather clear, no?  Not to Leonhardt, who tries one last time:<br />
<blockquote>And in a frenzied week, any time spent on talking about C.E.O. pay is time not spent on designing the toughest possible bailout package.</p></blockquote>
<p>Give you a hint, David.  Pass a large portion of the firm&#8217;s revenues to Dick Fuld or Hank Greenberg or Vikram Pandit and there won&#8217;t be any effing stock appreciation for you to claim to have &#8220;reduced the cost&#8221; in the end. Even the Chamber of Commerce knows this.</p>
<p>*Brought to you by the administration that expected its Iraq Adventure to last six days, maybe six weeks at most.<br />**In the context, I&#8217;m inclined to argue, under that same &#8220;two year&#8221; timeframe, that they should want to accelerate the decline in prices.  As a current seller, I object, though.<br />***For starters, it was designed to be initiated and run by a man who is unlikely to be in that same position six months from now.  That this might be an elementary design flaw seems to have escaped Mr. Leonhardt.<br />****The extra ten is because we are not so stupid as Mr. Leonhardt, on whom someone pulled &#8220;75&#8221; out of his backside.  No, we bid 65 because we know there is substantial uncertainty in that &#8220;75,&#8221; and we pulled &#8220;65&#8221; out of our backside.*****<br />*****Robert is now trying to figure out a correlation matrix for this.<br />******Ben Stein and Robert Samuelson always excepted.</p>

<p>I had the same reaction to his &#8220;we have to do something&#8221; comments on Sunday <a href="http://www.eschatonblog.com/2008_09_21_archive.html#3312904511454422316">as Dr. Black</a>.  But we both, clearly, forgot the game that was being played.</p>
<p>Monday is a day of work, and <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/09/socialism-in-on.html">Dodd has clearly prepared well</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Sec. 1. Short title; table of contents.<br />Sec. 2. Authority to purchase troubled assets.<br />Sec. 3. Considerations.<br />Sec. 4. Oversight.<br />Sec. 5. Rights; management; sale of troubled assets.<br />Sec. 6. Maximum amount of authorized purchases.<br />Sec. 7. Funding.<br />Sec. 8. Limits on review.<br />Sec. 9.

<p>Dodd, having played along with the &#8220;this is urgent&#8221; call has now presented the &#8220;if this is so urgent, show us what it&#8217;s really worth to you&#8221; card.</p>
<p>All the players may not yet be ready to go all-in, but the stakes are getting higher, and the <a href="http://digbysblog.blogspot.com/2008/09/opening-for-maverick-by-digby-ed.html">planned abstention from the McCain campaign</a> may soon look as if it is lack of leadership.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;ll end on a sad note. As Brad DeLong said <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/09/paul-krugman-vi.html">in an earlier post</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Dodd looks like a plan I can get behind&#8211;a serious attempt to solve the problem, preserve accountability, and balance the equities. Too bad he isn&#8217;t the VP nominee.</p></blockquote>
<p>But someone who opposed the bastardisation of FISA would have energized the base, and we can&#8217;t have that in Democratic politics.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not been a Good Weekend for me to read Berkeley-based Economists. (Though DeLong is <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/09/if-i-were-runni.html">on fire, in a good way</a>, and has been since that initial post.)</p>
<p>Via <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2008/09/anatomy-of-a-cr.html">Mark Thoma</a>, <a href="http://dailystaregypt.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=16596">this</a> from Barry Eichengreen:<br />
<blockquote>In the United States, there were two key decisions. The first, in the 1970’s, deregulated commissions paid to stockbrokers. The second, in the 1990’s, removed the Glass-Steagall Act’s restrictions on mixing commercial and investment banking. In the days of fixed commissions, investment banks could make a comfortable living booking stock trades. Deregulation meant competition and thinner margins. Elimination of Glass-Steagall then allowed commercial banks to encroach on the investment banks’ other traditional preserves.</p>
<p>In response, investment banks branched into new businesses like originating and distributing complex derivative securities. They borrowed money and put it to work to sustain their profitability. This gave rise to the first causes of the crisis: the originate-and-distribute model of securitization and the extensive use of leverage.</p>
<p>It is important to note that these were unintended consequences of basically sensible policy decisions. </p></blockquote>
<p>Consequences?  Yes.  Unintended??? Not a chance in the world.</p>
<p>Now that <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/09/goldman-morgan-to-become-bank-holding.html">the final step has been taken</a>, can anyone deny that <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/03/john-mccain-phil-gramm-and-us-financial.html">Phil</a> <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/09/secretary-of-treasury-phil-gramm.html">Gramm</a>, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/08/24/jim-leach-obama-supporter_n_120976.html">Jim Leach</a>, and <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/va.general/browse_thread/thread/cd47fe4b558d1b92?pli=1">Tom Bliley</a> knew exactly what they were doing?</p>

                                <p>At a high level, <a href="http://norris.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/15/and-then-there-were-two/">Floyd Norris explains it all to you</a>.</p>
<p>UDATED, AND PULLED TO THE FORE: For the more detailed view (h/t <a href="http://bigpicture.typepad.com/comments/2008/09/regulatory-exem.html">Barry R.</a>), the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/21/nyregion/22sun.html?_r=1&#038;hp=&#038;oref=slogin&#038;pagewanted=print">soon to be late</a>, <a href="http://nielsenhayden.com/makinglight/archives/010545.html">not very lamented</a>, New York Sun <a href="http://www.nysun.com/business/ex-sec-official-blames-agency-for-blow-up/86130/?print=5279202221">presents the details</a>:<br />
<blockquote>The SEC allowed five firms — the three that have collapsed plus Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley — to more than double the leverage they were allowed to keep on their balance sheets and remove discounts that had been applied to the assets they had been required to keep to protect them from defaults.</p>
<p>Making matters worse, according to Mr. Pickard, who helped write the original rule in 1975 as director of the SEC&#8217;s trading and markets division, is a move by the SEC this month to further erode the restraints on surviving broker-dealers by withdrawing requirements that they maintain a certain level of rating from the ratings agencies.</p></blockquote>
<p>and the solution <strong>going forward</strong> (that is, after you give these guys $700 billion) will be an even weaker form:<br />
<blockquote>The SEC said it has no plans to re-examine the impact of the 2004 changes to the net capital rule, and last week, it put out a proposal to revise the rule once again. This time, it is looking to remove the requirement that broker dealers maintain a certain rating from the ratings agencies.</p></blockquote>
<p>Because nothing says &#8220;faith in the institution&#8221; like a non-investment grade rating.</p>
<p>*Title explanation: Mother Courage at the beginning of the play has two (2) children.  By the end, she has two less than that.  The play closes with her &#8220;silent scream&#8221; as she drags her cart along.</p>
<p>If you had only seen that final scene, you would think it is a tragedy <em>of</em> Mother Courage, not one caused by her. Working from memory: One of her children dies because she sends him(?) something that might be salable—in the middle of a battlefield.  The other is similarly sacrificed.  It is the reverse of the &#8220;because he&#8217;s an orphan&#8221; joke.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&#038;sid=aFsdjjZ3hSec&#038;refer=home">Documentation of a minor disruption</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Lehman won&#8217;t return &#8220;billions&#8221; of frozen prime-brokerage assets &#8220;in the short term,&#8221; said PricewaterhouseCoopers, administrator for the Lehman bankruptcy.</p></blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, several hedge funds are planning to sing the Bono phrase from &#8220;Do They Know It&#8217;s Xmastime?&#8221;* to their cohorts at Morgan Stanley:<br />
<blockquote>Hedge funds that account for less than 10 percent of Morgan Stanley&#8217;s prime-brokerage balances this week withdrew their money or told the firm they planned to, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter.</p></blockquote>
<p>And the really good news:<br />
<blockquote>The loss of all hedge-fund accounts wouldn&#8217;t materially affect the company&#8217;s access to reserves, said the person, who asked not to be identified because the information is confidential.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m not certain I would take that as encouraging.<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;Hedge funds tend to look at counterparty risk as they would an equity investment,&#8221; said Adam Sussman, director of research at TABB Group LLC, a New York-based adviser to financial-services companies. &#8220;If they&#8217;d bet against the stock, they&#8217;d also be likely to minimize their exposure to their prime brokerage and trading over-the-counter derivatives with them.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I believe Bloomberg just indicated that the hedge funds leaving Morgan Stanley are &#8220;voting with their feet.&#8221;<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;Foremost on people&#8217;s minds is ensuring that wherever they decide to put assets, they will be secure,&#8221; [BNP Paribas SA&#8217;s global head of hedge-fund relationships, Talbot Stark] said in an interview today.</p></blockquote>
<p>With <a href="http://norris.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/17/flight-to-quality/">Treasuries yielding 0.00%</a>—about the same as your mattress, except with no option value—&#8221;security&#8221; has become more important than (to borrow an old phrase from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankers_Trust">a deceased-but-no-longer-mourned firm</a>) Risk-Adjusted Return on Capital (RAROC).</p>
<p>And it appears that the Wizard of Id&#8217;s version of the Golden Rule** <a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/080918/wall_street.html">still applies</a>.  Even if it <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/18/how-wall-streets-quants-lied-to-their-computers/">really was their fault</a>:<br />
<blockquote>The people who ran the financial firms chose to program their risk-management systems with overly optimistic assumptions and to feed them oversimplified data. This kept them from sounding the alarm early enough.</p></blockquote>
<p>Maybe more on this later.</p>
<p>*&#8221;Well tonight thank G-d it&#8217;s them/Instead of you&#8221;<br />**&#8221;He who has the gold makes the rules&#8221;</p>
