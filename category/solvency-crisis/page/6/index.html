                                <p>While I applaud the cautious optimism of <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2010/02/employment-report.html">Spencer</a> and <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2010/02/back-to-zero.html">Tom</a>, I&#8217;m more inclined to quote <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2010/02/05/economists-react-jobs-report-has-more-good-than-bad/">Joseph Brusuelas</a>:<br />
<blockquote>[T]he January payrolls added a dollop of Zen like logic to a recovery that is shaping up like no other. An additional 111,000 workers entered the labor force, yet the unemployment rate fell to 9.7% while private sector employment continued to contract. Hours worked, demand for temporary workers and the hiring in the service sector all improved. However, without the benchmark revisions, the unemployment rate would have increased to 10.6% which better captures the condition of an economy that has seen 8.4 million workers displaced during the recession.</p></blockquote>
<p>The bump in manufacturing was more than balanced by the drop in the Service Sector, as more and more <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2010/01/i-got-your-real-state-of-union-right.html">flower shops</a> cut staff in the face of slack demand and <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/bcreg/20100205a.htm">unavailable credit</a>.</p>
<p>If the bank bailout was to bailout the banks—defibrillating them to kick-start the economy&#8217;s heart, as it were—then it appears to be time to admit that that program was too small. Or to stop the other programs that are making it <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2010/02/heavy-flow-not-ipad-post.html">more advantageous for banks to hold funds than lend them</a>.  Any way you look at it, the optimistic view that declining unemployment has started <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2010/02/05/dont-expect-the-unemployment-rate-decline-to-last/">doesn&#8217;t appear to be the way to bet</a>.

<p>Matthew Yglesias discusses the financial crisis and the idea of causation.  He shows that he was a philosophy major.  I&#8217;m delighted.  The question is whether the answer to the question &#8220;What caused the financial crisis?&#8221; is of the form &#8220;A, because if A had not been true, then there wouldn&#8217;t have been a financial crisis.&#8221;  Yglesias notes potential problems with that approach.  I critique after the jump.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>OK jumpers, here I admit that, while I am delighted to have philosophy applied to finance, I think that among other things Yglesias made up some pseudo problems.  He is commenting on an excerpt from a post by <a href="http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/2010/02/causes-of-the-crisis/">Barry Ritholtz</a></p>
<p>
<blockquote>Understand that this is a theoretical discussion based on counter-factuals — what is likely to have occurred if various elements leading up to the crisis were different. We are trying to discern the differences between primary and secondary factors, separating the causes from the exacerbators.</p>
<p>Whenever someone asserts as a cause an event or force relative to a particular outcome, you should always ask: “Is this a “BUT FOR cause of that outcome?” In terms of a specific result or outcome, “But for” this factor, how would the outcome have changed? Would the result have been the same or different?</p></blockquote>
<p>I will comment on the passage quoted by Yglesias (note I have not read the post).  <br />That little passage is vulnerable to a serious practical critique.  It relies a lot on the word &#8220;likely.&#8221;  Now one thing we have learned from the crisis is that it is a bad mistake to look at the most likely outcome and assume it is certain.  In practice, the sort of result we can get from trying to understand the causes of the crisis is that it probably wouldn&#8217;t have occurred without those causes.  That&#8217;s not good enough for financial regulation.</p>
<p>More to the point, we can figure out that a crisis in 2007-8-9 would have been unlikely but for the following factors, but we can&#8217;t conclude that without those factors another crisis is unlikely to ever occur.  Obviously different crises can have different causes.  If the same factors exacerbate crises with different causes, it might be better to address the exacerbators and not the causes of the current crisis.</p>
<p>This is not the criticism Yglesias makes.  I&#8217;m going to try to be relatively brief for now and focus on two issues.  First he notes that but for causation and legal liability are different.  He has examples in which people are, and should be, punished for damage they didn&#8217;t cause in the sense that it wouldn&#8217;t have happened but for their actions.  </p>
<p>Then he writes &#8220;One is that when something very large-scale and bad happens, we probably have a few different interests. One is in punishing perpetrators and one is in preventing recurrence.&#8221;  Huh ?!?! Matthew Yglesias and I are inclined to be consequentialists (in my case at least it means I was inclined to be a utilitarian &#8212; was exposed to convincing arguments against utilitarianism and watered down my beliefs to something vague enough to be unrefuted).  </p>
<p>I at least absolutely believe that the only possible justification for a punishment is to prevent a recurrence.  I definitely do not think that we have an legitimate interest in punishing perpetrators except to the extent that it prevents an occurrence.  I had thought that Yglesias agreed with me on this.  He certainly has repeatedly described himself as mostly consequentialist. </p>
<p>This implies that I oppose vengeance for the purpose of vengeance.  That, in turn, doesn&#8217;t imply much in practice.  I think one effective way to prevent a recurrence of the crisis would be to tar and feather 10% of bankers chosen at random as collective punishment.  I do not advocate this course of action, because tarring and feathering is torture and because there are costs of having terrified bankers which are even worse than the occasional financial crisis due to excessive risk taking.  </p>
<p>Then Yglesias comes up with an abstract example.  <br />
<blockquote>The second is that when something complicated happens, it&#8217;s plausible that you’ll see confusing webs of preemption that defy simple counterfactual analysis. Imagine that A, B, C, D, E, F, and G all happened. And suppose that to produce a crisis you need A, plus either B or C, plus any two of E, F, and G. If you try to do a “but-for” analysis on all seven factors, you’re going to reach the conclusion that “A caused the crisis” while B, C, D, E, F, and G all may have contributed in some way but didn&#8217;t actually cause it. But it&#8217;s not clear that that&#8217;s the right thing to say. And it&#8217;s definitely not clear that the correct policy response is to focus on A. Maybe A had lots of really beneficial effects, while B and C are both useless.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here he is probably making a correct analysis of how attempted &#8220;but for&#8221; causal analysis will mislead us.  However, the shorthand of referring to factors with letters is key.  This is one case in which language influences causal analysis (in a way in which id doesn&#8217;t influence logical inference).  Let&#8217;s say there is another language in which the same word is used with two English meanings B and C.  In Italian the same word &#8220;fare&#8221; means &#8220;to make&#8221; or &#8220;to do&#8221; and the same word &#8220;forza&#8221; means &#8220;strength&#8221; and &#8220;force.&#8221;  On the other hand there are two translations of &#8220;to be&#8221; &#8220;essere&#8221; and &#8220;stare&#8221; and of &#8220;to love&#8221;If they do the but for analysis they will conclude that both A and &#8220;B or C&#8221; are causes.   </p>
<p>This means that we can make a mistake if we take the division of entities into categories to be either a known truth or a harmless convenience.  Here Yglesias doesn&#8217;t say that understanding what caused something is unimportant.  He notes that it is hard.  I tend to share his belief that analysis of causation by English speaking lawyers and judges is invalid, because they take the English language as know to be right and true (unlike all other languages) or, more exactly, because they assume that the decision to reason in English is harmless, innocent and doesn&#8217;t matter.  </p>
<p>Philosophers know that arguments which seem valid are proven to rest on unexamined conventions.  They do this by inventing new words.  I agree with Yglesias that one problem with legal efforts to find causation is that they rely to much on plain English and are too suspicious of neologisms and jargon.  </p>
<p>I am not joking.</p>
<p>OK that was the punchline but we are after the jump so I go on.</p>
<p>In the simple case of A, B, C, D and E, where each can be true or false it is possible to construct the whole set of possibilities (there are 32) and say which imply a crisis.  This means that the same long boring report is written whether we think that &#8220;A or B&#8221; is an elementary category and saying &#8220;A but not B&#8221; a pointless quibble or if we think that &#8220;A&#8221; and &#8220;B&#8221; are elementary categories and &#8220;A or B&#8221; is derived from them.  </p>
<p>In the real world, it is absolutely impossible to get anywhere without risking having been lead there by the irrelevant history of the evolution of language.  The innocent language in which every possible state of the world has it&#8217;s own name has an infinite vocabulary and no one can learn it.  IIUC philosophers have long since given up on finding a language such that using that language can&#8217;t lead us astray.</p>
<p>Just to go on and on some of Yglesias&#8217;s other examples are interestingly irrelevant.</p>
<p>After the Ritholtz passage he continues<br />
<blockquote>I’m broadly sympathetic to that account, but it’s worth emphasizing that there are a lot of complications. Consider this example from L.A. Paul and Ned Hall, “Causation and Preemption”:<br />
<blockquote>Suzy and Billy, two friends, both throw rocks at a bottle. Suzy is quicker, and consequently it is her rock, and not Billy&#8217;s, that breaks the bottle. But Billy, though not as fast, is just as accurate: Had Suzy not thrown, or had her rock somehow been interrupted mid-flight, Billy&#8217;s rock would have broken the bottle moments later.</p></blockquote>
<p>So you can&#8217;t say that the &#8220;but for Suzy’s toss, the bottle wouldn&#8217;t have broken.&#8221; But I think a normal person would want to say that Suzy broke the bottle. There’s a lot of work done on this and other philosophical topics. But I would note that in a politics/policy context it often just depends on what we care about.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes and, in this case, what we care about is preventing a recurrence so, for our purposes, Billy&#8217;s and Suzy&#8217;s actions are the same.  They are like B and C in the abstract example.  </p>
<p>In plain English, &#8220;Sally broke the bottle&#8221; is true and &#8220;Bill broke the bottle&#8221;.  The example shows how we can&#8217;t completely describe the events usefully with two sentences of only 4 words each.  This is not a surprise. </p>
<p>OK this is the example which caused me to write this post. <br />
<blockquote>Imagine I&#8217;m in the elephant house at the zoo on a crowded day. A couple of elephants get loose and start stampeding through the crowd. I have a gun on me, and spot some dude I don’t like and decide to take advantage of the chaos by shooting him in the end. Eventually, it turns out that 80 percent of the people who were in the elephant house that day wind up dead as a result of the stampede. From a “but-for” perspective, it&#8217;s not clear that I actually caused the dude’s death. But from a legal perspective, it&#8217;s clear that I&#8217;m a murderer. The point of the statute is precisely to punish people who shoot other people in the head. But from a policy perspective, the bigger issue here is arguably elephant stampedes rather than guns at the zoo. At a minimum, elephant stampedes are killing more people.</p></blockquote>
<p>Again huh ?!?!? I would say that the purpose of the murder statute is to prevent murder and the purpose of preventing murder is to keep people alive.  To mean, punishing murderers is a means to an end not an end in itself.  So I think the character named &#8220;I&#8221; should be jailed.  We jail for 2 reasons and both have to do with intention and not &#8220;but for&#8221; causation.  We want to deter murderers.  Punishing someone for killing someone who would have died anyway but he didn&#8217;t know it works just as well.  Deterrence depends on what people think will happen to them and people generally don&#8217;t kill other people if they know the other person is about to get stomped by an elephant (some bloodthirsty person might and there is no point in deterring him but no harm either so punishing people for killing people who are going to die anyway is just as useful as a deterrent (also we are all going to die sooner or later)).</p>
<p>Another purpose of jail is to incapacitate.  We lock people up because the crime they have committed convinces us that they are likely to commit more crimes.  In theory if we could determine who would commit crimes in the future consequentalism tells us we should lock them up before they have committed a crime.  The rule that people are to be locked up only after they have committed a crime is needed, because the alternative is to grant some person or group arbitrary power to lock others up if they say they think the others will commit a crime. </p>
<p>Our forecast of future murder depends again on intent.</p>
<p>Now I will argue that I am really really fanatically consequentialist and have been for a long long time.  When I was in 4th grade, I said that the prison sentence for attempted murder should be longer than the prison sentence for murder.  My logic was based on incapacitation (I&#8217;m pretty sure I didn&#8217;t believe in deterrence at all then).  The prediction of future murders depends on the intent I argued (as I argued above).  Plus if the attempted murder is unsuccessful we know that there is someone that the defendant wants to kill.  If the murder had been successful, maybe the murderer would be satisfied.</p>
<p>This is very consequentialist thinking.  It totally freaked out my classmates and teacher. </p>
<p>Years later, I understood what was wrong with my reasoning.  I was assuming that we knew for sure that an act was an attempted murder.  In the real world, severe punishment for attempted murder would lead to locking up people whose aim was assault not murder.  Indeed the word lead me astray.  There are many degrees of intent from trying and seeing if it works to absolute determination to make it work.  The difference between a murder and an attempted murder may be partly chance, but it can also be partly based on determination.  </p>
<p>My proposal was like locking up people who will commit crimes but haven&#8217;t yet.  Under absurd assumptions about what we know, it makes consequentialist sense, but in the real world, we can&#8217;t know that much or trust people who claim to know that much.</p>

                                <p>Was 2009 a great year to be a bank? The headlines all say so. (The 140 U.S. banks that were closed by the FDIC last year may disagree some.)  But, as Isabelle Kaminska of Alphaville notes, <a href="http://ftalphaville.ft.com/blog/2010/02/04/140896/deutsche-bank-the-flow-rider/">very little of the gains posted for last year came from anything related to talent</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Deutsche Bank reported net income of €5bn for the year 2009 on Thursday, compared to a €3.9bn loss in 2008.</p>
<p>This, we would say, is a pretty impressive turnaround in anyone’s business&#8230;.</p>
<p>Deutsche attributes much of that growth to the successful re-orientation of its business towards customer business and liquid, ‘flow’ products. While it’s not broken out within the results, we’re willing to bet that a large slice of that re-orientation was therefore focused on managing flow emanating from the group’s ever growing synthetic exchange-traded-product and foreign exchange businesses — both of which happen to do very well when spreads are wide, and volatility is high.</p></blockquote>
<p>When I first started working in the investment side of the banking industry, 20-some years ago, the traders and marketers were especially careful to distinguish themselves from the &#8220;retail&#8221; side of banking.  Indeed, the retail bankers were described as &#8220;9-6-3&#8221; people: lend at 9%, take deposits at 6%, and be on the golf course by 3:00.</p>
<p>Now that that same type of effort is producing all those record profits, is it time to decide that the legendary &#8220;management skills&#8221; of Jimmy Cayne, Vikram Pandit, and Neutron Jack (who turned GE from a products company into a finance company) might not have been all that different from that of a polyester-suited small-town bank manager?</p>

                                <p>Brad DeLong and John Cochrane agree on something.  I must dissent.</p>
<p><a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2010/01/why-are-we-still-in-a-recession-the-shape-of-the-crisis-and-too-big-to-fail.html">Delong and Cochrane agree that</a> <br />
<blockquote>&#8220;The underlying decline in wealth from the housing bust was &#8230; around $400 billion. &#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Indeed, relative to the size of the economy the losses during the crash of the dot-com bubble were four times as large.</p></blockquote>
<p>I object that the two sums being compared are not comparable at all.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>OK so this was a comment on DeLong so when you see &#8220;you&#8221; read &#8220;DeLong&#8221;</p>
<p>Why do you compare the losses during the crash of the dot-com bubble to the $400 billion rather than to the $25 trillion ?</p>
<p>The losses during the crash of the housing bubble are, you claim, $25 trillion.  </p>
<p>Someone who has forgotten 2000 (or 1999 or 2001 or &#8230; well I clearly am that someone) would compare the $400 billion to the decline in the value of shares of corporations with names which ended .com.  I don&#8217;t think that was $ 1.2 trillion.</p>
<p>For some reason, you and Cochrane count the whole loss around that time as the dot.com shock and only losses on subprime mortgages this time. The former value of the former shares of Lehman isn&#8217;t in the sum which equals $ 400 billion.</p>
<p>I think that it is possible to distinguish the shock due to burst bubbles from the total consequences in a meaningful way.  I&#8217;d say the reasonable comparison is the total decline in share values then to the total decline in the value of housing now.  The current bubble loss would be about $ 6 trillion for the USA not $ 400 billion.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t make sense to compare total losses then to losses born by banks now and conclude that the losses born by banks now are smaller than total losses then, but a lot of damange was done because all of the losses born by banks now were born by banks.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d say that in the US alone, and ignoring commercial real estate, about $ 6 trillion in &#8220;wealth&#8221; <a href="http://understandingthemarket.com/?p=16">was revealed to be a fantasy</a>. </p>
<p>That&#8217;s gotta to hurt.  It hurt even more because investment banks shared the rubes delusions this time, but the delusion was huge and the so was the delusione (disappointment)</p>

<p>If the FRB of NY really believed that their only option was payment in full and not telling anyone about it, then Tim Geithner&#8217;s leadership abilities make <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2010/01/bernanke-part-2-of-2-leaders-lead-or.html">Ben Bernanke</a> look like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Allied_Commander">Dwight Eisenhower</a>.</p>
<p>BarryO is, apparently, finally trying to make clear the distinctions between TARP, TLGF, TALF, CPLF, Maiden Lane, Maiden Lane II, Maiden Lane III, etc. and the actual Stimulus Package.  A good place to start: One was a huge giveaway that has led to overreported profits and high taxpayer expenses.  The other was passed by Congress.</p>

                                <p>UPDATE: In this context, Dr. Black <a href="http://www.eschatonblog.com/2010/01/big-misses.html">catches Jamie Dimon</a> <a href="http://www.mcclatchydc.com/227/story/82270.html">expressing what is at best ignorance</a>:<br />
<blockquote>However, [Dimon] cautioned, until the market meltdown &#8220;you never saw losses in these products, because home prices were going up.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>All that research in 1984 and 1990 was for naught, apparently.</p>
<p>I’m still <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2010/01/taking-short-break.html" target="_blank">away</a> (things are better, but still not completely back to normal), but this is too good not to post:</p>
<blockquote><p>Unfortunately, many default models using original LTV [Loan-to-Value] have underestimated the level of delinquencies in recent years. Measurement of the amount of equity borrowers have in their home is the chief cause. Such mismeasurement is due to two factors: declining home prices and removal of equity via second mortgages or home equity lines of credit.</p></blockquote>
<p>Is this from:
<ol>
<li>2008-2010?</li>
<li>2004-2006?</li>
<li>1996?</li>
<li>officially 1996, but other textual evidence indicates it was written between 1989 and 1993?</li>
</ol>
<p>My answer is (4); the official one is (3), since it’s from the Third Edition of Frank J. Fabozzi’s <em>Bond Markets, Analysis and Strategies</em> (now in its <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Bond-Markets-Analysis-Strategies-7th/dp/0136078974/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&#038;s=books&#038;qid=1263400474&#038;sr=1-1" target="_blank">7th edition</a>).  But if anyone out there has the first or second edition and wants to check the chapter on Mortgage Loans, I’ll give odds the paragraph is virtually identical in the Second Edition.</p>
