<blockquote>Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson initially sold Congress in the fall of 2008 on emergency intervention to purchase “toxic assets,” but quickly reversed course in favor of direct capital injections. Those <em>favored</em> financial institutions revived more quickly than most thought possible and most of those injections have already been paid back. <em>However, most of the toxic assets remain on bank balance sheets, impeding new lending. </em>[emphases mine]</p></blockquote>
<p>At the end of the last post, I was ready to discuss “deadweight loss.” But a brief detour seems in order.</p>
<p>We used to talk a lot at this blog about DSGE models. Economists talk a lot about Equilibrium, even if they don’t fully understand it. At its core, saying “equilibrium” is saying “this is the best of all possible worlds.”  You can’t improve on equilibrium unless you choose a non-Pareto-optimal solution (i.e., a solution in which at least one person is affected negatively).</p>
<p>Equilibrium doesn’t mean you have achieved ideal social welfare. (Anyone who has looked at Game Theory for more than a minute can tell you that.)  But it does mean that things are “hitting on all cylinders.”  Or, more accurately, if the economy is <strong>not</strong> at equilibrium, the odds are better that people making choices will make mistakes.</p>
<p>Which is why I pointed to <a href="http://econospeak.blogspot.com/2010/01/1983-ponzi-game-prediction.html" target="_blank">Brenda Rosser</a> and especially this<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;The way out of this thing is a shift in the way we treat the LDC debt,&#8221; Coldwell argued. &#8220;The banks would have to take a big hit on their balance sheets, but then it&#8217;s over. If you give them a definitive hit, then they could say it&#8217;s behind us. If you get down to a crisis stage, the banks would accept that. They would have no choice.” &#8212; William Greider. &#8216;The Secrets of the Temple &#8211; How the Federal Reserve Runs the Country&#8217; Touchstone 1989. Page 549</p></blockquote>
<p>If the banks take that hit, we’re back at equilibrium.  If they don’t, they continue to make suboptimal choices.  Which brings us back to the graphic.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/Sz_3sgW14fI/AAAAAAAAAW8/dqY9ItVe21k/s1600-h/NonPerfLoansQtrly.JPG"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/Sz_3sgW14fI/AAAAAAAAAW8/dqY9ItVe21k/s400/NonPerfLoansQtrly.JPG"></a></p>
<p>There were several good suggestions for refinement in the comments, none of which can I do at the moment, since I’m working solely from FRED data. (General response: those acquisitions, especially WaMu, were made on terms that were agreeable to all acquiring parties. Which doesn’t mean those acquisitions may not be affecting the flow, but it’s likely more a question of acceleration than velocity, especially given the relative sizes of the institutions.)</p>
<p>But the FRED data is damning enough.  The risk management procedures at larger institutions were significantly worse than they were at smaller ones.  And the bigger they are, the worse they are becoming:</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/S0H8o5ZOg_I/AAAAAAAAAXE/Y14aM6VSJWg/s1600-h/NPLLargeBanks.JPG"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/S0H8o5ZOg_I/AAAAAAAAAXE/Y14aM6VSJWg/s400/NPLLargeBanks.JPG"></a></p>
<p>With several waves of doubt still to come, we are (choose one) (a) far from equilibrium or (b) still making suboptimal choices.</p>
<p>So let’s do a finger exercise.<br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Mortgages Outstanding approx. $11 trillion (Q4 2008)</p>
<p>Amount at risk (SWAG)25%</p>
<p>Expected Losses $2.75T</p>
<p>Fed Holdings (<a href="http://www.econbrowser.com/archives/2009/12/term_deposit_fa.html" target="_blank">TARP, TALF, CPLF, etc.</a>) approx. $2.2 T</p>
<p>Remaining Balance Sheet Exposuren approx. $550B</p>
<p>25% at risk seems about right.  Slightly over 10% of that $11T was Home Equity Loans, and the outstanding household debt at that time was <a href="http://mwhodges.home.att.net/nat-debt/debt-nat-a.htm#household" target="_blank">about 123% of national income</a> while <a href="http://mwhodges.home.att.net/family_a.htm#home_equity" target="_blank">equity was around 40%</a>.</p>
<p>But note that this assumes that all of the special facilities remain in place. For instance, per Hamilton’s graphic, the Fed now owns about $1T worth of MBSes. CR notes that this program “<a href="http://www.calculatedriskblog.com/2010/01/pimcos-mcculley-three-major-issues-for.html" target="_blank">is scheduled to be complete by the end of Q1</a>.”</p>
<p>Of course, there are some cures that would be worse than the disease.  Via alea’s Twitter feed, I see that either the headline writer or the speaker <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN0320287220100103" target="_blank">made a slip yesterday</a>:<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;There ought to be government-backed ABS,&#8221; said Fed economist Wayne Passmore in a presentation to the American Economic Association.</p></blockquote>
<p>Note that the quote is not (just) MBS but <strong>A</strong>BS—<em>asset</em>-backed securities, including credit-card receivables, car loans, basically any form of consumer (or other) debt that can be securitized.  The result of this would be that your tax dollars would pay a bank for your default on a credit card that charged you 30% interest, despite the risk-free rate being something near 0%—and almost always in the 5-8% range.</p>
<p>The reason we like equilibrium is that people who make mistakes do so because they are “being irrational.” When we’re not at equilibrium, we realize that they make irrational decisions all the time.  In what I hope will be the last of this series, we’ll look at irrational and rational decisions—and why irrationality may be the best survival strategy.</p>

                                <p>UPDATE: CR appears to agree with me, even as <a href="http://www.calculatedriskblog.com/2010/01/what-bernanke-didnt-say.html">he raises another point</a>:<br />
<blockquote> Bernanke used data from other countries to suggest monetary policy was not a huge contributor to the bubble &#8230; however, Bernanke didn&#8217;t discuss if non-traditional mortgage products contributed to housing bubbles in other countries. This would seem like a key missing part of the speech.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m willing to believe that my interpretation of <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20100103a.htm">this speech</a> is inaccurate, but here&#8217;s the evidence:<br />
<blockquote>Some observers have assigned monetary policy a central role in the crisis. Specifically, they claim that excessively easy monetary policy by the Federal Reserve in the first half of the decade helped cause a bubble in house prices in the United States, a bubble whose inevitable collapse proved a major source of the financial and economic stresses of the past two years. Proponents of this view typically argue for a substantially greater role for monetary policy in preventing and controlling bubbles in the prices of housing and other assets. In contrast, others have taken the position that policy was appropriate for the macroeconomic conditions that prevailed, and that it was neither a principal cause of the housing bubble nor the right tool for controlling the increase in house prices. Obviously, in light of the economic damage inflicted by the collapses of two asset price bubbles over the past decade, a great deal more than historical accuracy rides on the resolution of this debate.</p></blockquote>
<p>If I have to pick, I&#8217;ll take the latter group.  Easy money alone doesn&#8217;t cause a crisis. So when he says:<br />
<blockquote> Can accommodative monetary policies during this period reasonably account for the magnitude of the increase in house prices that we observed? If not, what does account for it?</p></blockquote>
<p>The first answer is clearly &#8220;No.&#8221; And the second answer is important.  Eventually, he answers it:<br />
<blockquote>I noted earlier that the most important source of lower initial monthly payments, which allowed more people to enter the housing market and bid for properties, was not the general level of short-term interest rates, but the increasing use of more exotic types of mortgages and the associated decline of underwriting standards. That conclusion suggests that the best response to the housing bubble would have been regulatory, not monetary. Stronger regulation and supervision aimed at problems with underwriting practices and lenders&#8217; risk management would have been a more effective and surgical approach to constraining the housing bubble than a general increase in interest rates. Moreover, regulators, supervisors, and the private sector could have more effectively addressed building risk concentrations and inadequate risk-management practices without necessarily having had to make a judgment about the sustainability of house price increases.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve and other agencies did make efforts to address poor mortgage underwriting practices. In 2005, we worked with other banking regulators to develop guidance for banks on nontraditional mortgages, notably interest-only and option-ARM products. In March 2007, we issued interagency guidance on subprime lending, which was finalized in June. After a series of hearings that began in June 2006, we used authority granted us under the Truth in Lending Act to issue rules that apply to all high-cost mortgage lenders, not just banks. However, these efforts came too late or were insufficient to stop the decline in underwriting standards and effectively constrain the housing bubble. [emphases mine]</p></blockquote>
<p>As Albert Brooks once noted, he &#8220;buried the lede.&#8221; Bernanke notes that the &#8220;nontraditional&#8221; products constituted around 1/3 of the market by 2003. (As many others have noted, those mortgages were not passed through/to FHA/Fannie/Freddie, either.)  Two years later, guidelines were being developed.</p>
<p>An institution that did not attempt to regulate claiming that it should be given more regulatory power is an invitation to disaster.  Or am I missing something?</p>

                                <p>Tyler Cowen <a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2009/12/why-hasnt-the-fed-been-targeting-two-or-three-percent-inflation.html">can count</a>:<br />
<blockquote>In sum, maybe three percent expected inflation conflicts with the desire to rapidly recapitalize banks through maintaining a wide interest rate spread.  Maybe we need that zero nominal short rate or at least the Fed thinks we do&#8230;.</p>
<p>I also regard this as a somewhat gruesome hypothesis.  It means that &#8220;Main Street&#8221; is paying for &#8220;Wall Street&#8221; (forgive me the use of those awful terms) in at least two ways: high unemployment and inability to earn much on one&#8217;s savings&#8230;.</p>
<p>The term structure also implies that the market is expecting rising short rates, so if the bank mess isn&#8217;t cleaned up soon, heaven forbid.  The spread, as a means of restoring bank profitability, won&#8217;t last forever.</p></blockquote>
<p>And Ryan Avent (via <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2009/12/links-for-2009-12-31.html">Brad DeLong</a>) points out <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2009/12/withdrawing_support_1">the next piece of that puzzle</a>:<br />
<blockquote>[T]he Fed&#8217;s commitment to undo its interventions is already having an effect. In expectation of more of these moves to come (as well as, perhaps, increases in interest rates) markets have been bidding up the dollar, which has busily appreciated during the month of December. That, in turn, will deprive the American economy of a potential source of demand—growth in consumption of American exports thanks to the effect of a weak dollar.</p>
<p>More bluntly, we&#8217;re seeing a move toward contractionary monetary policy at a time when unemployment is at 10%. Funny that.</p></blockquote>
<p>I can&#8217;t think of a scarier way to end the year.  Sorry about that.  Best wishes for 2010—we&#8217;re all going to need them.</p>

                                <p>The WSJ collects <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2009/12/29/economists-react-prices-have-further-to-fall/?utm_source=feedburner&#038;utm_medium=feed&#038;utm_campaign=Feed:+wsj/economics/feed+(WSJ.com:+Real+Time+Economics+Blog)&#038;utm_content=Google+Reader">reactions to the release of the latest Case-Shiller index</a>. Let&#8217;s look at two, just for fun:<br />
<blockquote>One in four mortgages are currently underwater. Foreclosure and delinquency rates, which hit a record high at the end of the third quarter of 2009, are therefore likely to continue to rise, perhaps sharply. In addition to this, the inventory of homes for sale remains near record highs. … Despite the recent positive reports on housing prices, we believe that prices have further to fall—about another 5%-10%. — Patrick Newport, IHS Global Insight&#8230;.</p>
<p>When the Case-Shiller index began increasing in the summer, there were concerns that exaggerated seasonal patterns were an important driver, as trends had briefly improved in the summer of 2008 as well. However, while some seasonality does appear to have been present, the fact that the Case-Shiller home price index is continuing to increase is good news. We still believe that home prices could fall a bit over the course of 2010, but the majority of the price adjustment has probably already occurred. — Abiel Reinhart, J.P. Morgan Chase</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m not cherry-picking here.  I could make fun of the excluded &#8220;the long-awaited U.S. housing market recovery is well upon us&#8221; all day, but I&#8217;ll leave that one to <a href="http://www.calculatedriskblog.com/">CR</a> (who, I now see, has already done a <a href="http://www.calculatedriskblog.com/2009/12/are-homes-now-cheap.html">Variation on the Theme</a>).</p>
<p>But let&#8217;s look at pieces of the two points, and see why I&#8217;m not sanguine (besides being long housing, that is):
<ol>
<li>One in four mortgages are currently underwater.  One in four = 25%.</li>
<li>&#8220;[W]e believe that prices have further to fall—about another 5%-10%.&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;[T]he Case-Shiller home price index is continuing to increase&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;Home prices could fall a bit over the course of 2010, but the majority of the price adjustment has probably already occurred.&#8221;</li>
</ol>
<p>Even if you take all of those at face value, you have to combine Bad Economics and Bad Policy to assume the worst is near over.</p>
<p>Details below the fold.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />Bad Economics:  If 25% of households are underwater right now, it would be foolish to assume that those people would <em>or should</em> stay in their house. (<a href="http://www.interfluidity.com/v2/364.html">Steve Randy Waldman made this point a while back</a>.)</p>
<p>This doesn&#8217;t mean that all 25% of those householders should move.  There are major transaction costs in moving, not the least of which is the cost of moving itself.  Renting will not be <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB126040517376983621.html">a better deal</a> for everyone, but more and more people are going to realize that <strong>not</strong> walking away will be A Bad Idea, damaging the future of their child and themselves long after any credit report impact will have dissipated.</p>
<p>And if prices are still 5-10% above where they will be, the decision will become that much more inevitable, especially in areas where employment is lagging.</p>
<p>Looking at the &#8220;bright spot&#8221;—the counterintuitive rise in the Case-Shiller Index—which looks <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2009/12/29/a-look-at-case-shiller-by-metro-area-december-update/">less firm</a> than one might gather from the commenters—we see that this is another Second Derivative Problem: the pace of the decline has slowed (7.3% YOY) and the gain (&#8220;a seasonally adjusted 0.4%&#8221;) comes primarily from two areas (Phoenix, which has the largest YOY decline in the Index, and SF), with only five other positive gains over the month, none greater than 0.4% (SD; New York City is flat).</p>
<p>There are green shoots there, but they are on rather fallow ground.</p>
<p>Bad Policy is made clear in the last point: &#8220;the majority of the price adjustment has probably already occurred.&#8221;</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s assume that statement is true.  We are, therefore, slightly away from equilibrium, but probably close enough.</p>
<p>But 25% of householders are underwater.  And probably 80% of those—one in five &#8220;homeowners&#8221;—would have their economic situation improved by walking away and renting.</p>
<p>The term that comes to mind is &#8220;deadweight loss.&#8221;  And let&#8217;s look at that in the next post.</p>

                                <p><strong>Geithner&#8217;s Baa Humbug to Job&#8217;s and Labor </strong><br />(h/t Run75441)</p>
<p>&#8220;Ebenezer: Since you ask me what I wish sir, that is my answer. I help to support the establishments I have named; those who are badly off must go there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Daniel Gross at Slate interviews Tim Geithner here: <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2239552/pagenum/all/#p2" target="_blank">“We Will Be Judged on How We Dealt with the Things that were Broken”</a>  Some rather revealing statements by Tim Geithner to Daniel Gross&#8217;s questions:</p>
<p>GROSS: There&#8217;s a perception that you regard your portfolio narrowly, as primarily focused on the health of Wall Street, with Main Street a distant second. <br />GEITHNER: &#8220;My first and essential responsibility was to fix and reform the financial system. That was necessarily going to be the principal part of what people saw. About half my time from the beginning has been spent on the design of the broader economic strategy. The idea that we did not do much for the broader challenges facing the country is completely unjustified. The Recovery Act itself was not just a sweeping, essential force for growth but included a bunch of targeted investments in education, energy, environment, health care that will have huge long-term benefits.&#8221;<br />(Run here: Geithner misses the point or makes the point that finance is the number one concern over Main Street, even though Main Street is financing the rescue of W$. The constituency doesn&#8217;t want charity in targeted investments in education, energy, education, and environment when it can pay for those investments itself if they are working. Main Street wants jobs? Main street is still waiting for that tsunami of job creation which is one of the broader challenges of any administration and no administration has put into play any package to stimuli it or companies to do more. Jobs are left to free market influences which is content with investing profits elsewhere other than job creating infrastructure.)</p>
<p>GROSS: So you don&#8217;t think the bailouts were too friendly to Wall Street? <br />GEITHNER: “The idea that the strategy was unfair and has principally benefited a small number of institutions in New York is a mischaracterization of the design and result of the strategy. I thought people would have understood this after the failure of Lehman Bros. But when you do too little and you leave the system with real fear that everything is going to fall apart, like any financial crisis, it hurts the poorest most. A just and fair strategy, even if it is politically hardest to explain and justify, is to use well-designed but massive force to stabilize the system.“</p>
<p>(Run here: Over at Naked Capitalism, they are debating whether Goldman Sachs drove the collapse of AIG by calling for the mark down of CDO by companies holding too many of them thereby forcing AIG to raise collateral after it was downgraded and eventually paying off on CDO that never were expected to payoff. While AIG is at fault for seeing too many pie in the sky dollars in risk and having too little collateral to cover it, one has to wonder why Goldman Sachs should have received 100% on the dollar on its CDS for its risk with AIG and not knowing how over leveraged AIG was at the time. Goldman Sachs certainly benefited by Geithner&#8217;s negotiated settlement of AIG&#8217;s liabilities at 100% on the dollar.)</p>
<p>GROSS: The biggest downside surprise? </p>
<p>GEITHNER: &#8220;The [high] level of unemployment relative to what was happening in the economy as a whole. I&#8217;m not an economist, but almost all forecasters missed that. And that&#8217;s hugely consequential, because it&#8217;s the prism through which most people view basic economic health.&#8221; </p>
<p>(Run here:He is kidding right? During every economic downturn, it has consistently been Main Street that has been shown the street from their jobs or homes.)</p>

                                <p>Good Thing We Have <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2009/12/18/2009-12-18_section_8_snafu_may_overfill_city_shelters.html">Deficit Hawks in Congress</a>:<br />
<blockquote>The tenants were all living low-rent under a program that&#8217;s beginning to expire &#8211; but had been promised they could still qualify for a federal Section 8 rent subsidy.</p>
<p>But this week, when many of them began to show up at New York City Housing Authority offices, which accepts the vouchers and administers the subsidy, they were told the program was kaput&#8230;.</p>
<p>NYCHA Chairman <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/nycha/html/news/pr_may09_13.shtml">John Rhea</a> Thursday blamed the move &#8211; which could push thousands into the city&#8217;s already crowded shelters &#8211; on Congress, a lower-than-usual attrition rate in the program and unprecedented demand&#8230;.</p>
<p>More than half the vouchers &#8211; 1,833 &#8211; had been given to families and individuals who were once homeless.</p>
<p>Rhea, a former investment banker who took over the agency this year, said Congress didn&#8217;t set aside enough money to run the program through the end of the year.</p>
<p>Congress took $58 million from the authority in May from funds that were earmarked for Section 8, Rhea said. [link to Rhea appointment added]</p></blockquote>
<p>Good to see responsible budgeting only means putting 3,000 families out on the streets just in time for the first big snowstorm of the year.</p>

                                <p>But Steve Randy Waldman already <a href="http://www.interfluidity.com/v2/384.html">did the heavy lifting</a>:<br />
<blockquote>several of the other officers had been stationed at the height of the housing bubble at facilities located near D.C. in Northern Virginia. They lived in very modest homes which were removed from their workplaces by substantial driving distances, but these homes were nevertheless particularly pricey for someone with a family and on a military salary. The humble homes ate significant chunks out of those salaries as the commutes did to the (already scarce) time these men had to spend with their families&#8230;.</p>
<p>While we were away, about halfway through our deployment, the crash began and something mysterious had gone horribly wrong with the machinery of America. The small equity positions these men has invested in their respective residences were wiped out in a matter of months. By the time they were close to returning to these homes the men were all badly underwater by over one hundred thousand dollars and, what was worse, the Army had reassigned them&#8230;.</p>
<p>Their instinct was that if they had borrowed money from a friend or a neighbor they would feel a deep, almost sacred, obligation to make good on their debt and pay it off in full plus interest as soon as they could manage it&#8230;.That was, after all, the “right thing to do” as they had been taught by their parents and grandparents.</p>
<p>But then the bailouts with taxpayer money started. The “too big to fail” talk began, and then the wave of foreclosures and layoffs and emerging scandals of the unjust excesses of the financial industry, and so on. And these men began to feel that from the personal scale of their little world, their family was also perhaps “too big to fail” by the forfeit of their hard-won life’s savings.</p>
<p>They also started to question how the bailouts could make sense without some of the benefits flowing to innocent and responsible men such as themselves&#8230;.</p></blockquote>

<p>It started with a finger exercise during my daughter’s swim team practice:</p>
<p>Just in case you thought I was picking on The Big C in <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/12/much-to-my-amazement.html">my previous post</a>, let us look at the other major financial institutions (Too Big to Fail, or TBTF, Banks) over the same time period.</p>
<p>The Remaining Investment Banks:</p>

<p>While Goldman Sachs—as with most of the other so-called Winners—shows a significant upturn and major gains since the beginning of 2009, Morgan Stanley’s appreciation has been rather less apparent.  However, both have returned only to approximately the price they held during the interregnum (after Bear Stearns fell but while Lehman Brothers ignored the warning and decided not to right the ship).</p>

<p>Both firms show an increase in stock performance beginning in Q1 of 2009.  Wells Fargo had a precipitous dive after LEH filed bankruptcy, but recovered in a similar amount of time.  JPMorganChase, having acquired Bear for either a song or too much money, remains below the level it reached during the interregnum, but solidly in the middle of its range since 2006. </p>

<p>As is apparent, Capital One’s stock decline was not precipitated by the proximate solvency crisis itself, but rather by the decline in earnings and profits, and deflation in wages, that was in full swing by early 2006.  While Bank of America does not have that preamble, it sees a similar decline in its stock price from the middle of 2007.  By the time the recession is officially declared, the trend has started. And while Bear’s fire sale to JPM causes a decline in bank stocks, it is not until LEH that BAC mirrors its competitors above.  More like MS than GS, BAC’s recovery to less than one-half of its pre-recession trading price suggests that the market is less confident than management that the firm’s major issues are behind it.</p>
<p>But one thing abides.  The market isn&#8217;t happy.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />Even as we might divide this squad into Winners (GS, JPM, WFC), Losers (C, MS), and Also-Rans (COF, BAC), six of those seven (exception: JPM) appear to be viewed by the market as no stronger than they were during the interregnum, the time when everyone was waiting to see if the other shoe would drop.</p>
<p>There are certainly other reasons the stock price might be down: insider selling at the firms is at record or near-record levels, and sooner or later people will figure out that <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/article/most-recent-insider-selling-buying-ratio-821">when insiders are selling at 82:1 levels is not the best time to buy</a>.  Their loans are down (post on that coming soon) while, as Linda <a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2009/12/is-goldman-really-a-bank-would-some-tax-increases-make-sense-right-away.html">notes at ataxingmatter</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>A recent study suggests that big banks in the TBTF category now enjoy a significant cost-of-funds spread compared to other banks.  That is, they can borrow money more cheaply, leading to greater ability to make profits, than can other banks, because of the implicit guarantee that the federal government will step in and save them because they are TBTF and pose a systemic risk.  That advantage may amount to as much as 48% of the TBTF banks&#8217; profits this year (or as &#8216;little&#8217; as 9%, on very conservative assumptions).   The government, by the way, gets nothing for this implicit guarantee&#8211;unlike a commercial guarantor, it is not being paid a regular premium for the service.</p></blockquote>
<p>So maybe investors believe that this advantage will go away.  (Or, as noted above, maybe investors have figured out that the Big Banks aren&#8217;t taking advantage of this opporunity, expecting that it will never go away.)</p>
<p>The one certainty is that, with all of their advantages (the refusal of the Administration <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/the-house-kills-mortgage-cram-down-amendment-2009-12">to support cramdowns for non-investment properties</a>, leading to perverted accounting that makes banks solvent and mortgageholders underwater at the same time on the same property; the continuing payment of interest on Reserves in a deflationary environment, which has created a perverse incentive for the TBTF Banks not to lend; charging their smaller competitors for the TBTF Banks&#8217;s failures <a href="http://www.journalstar.com/business/article_e6dcf326-dd17-5d43-8851-7e7bb90a0a59.html">by raising their FDIC contribution</a> and collecting <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/11/12/AR2009111210512_pf.html">three years of it upfront</a> after <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2009/03/11/now_needy_fdic_collected_little_in_premiums?mode=PF">not having saved for a rainy day</a>; having Administration economic policy run by Larry Summers, whose last foray into the financial markets was <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601109&#038;sid=aHQ2Xh55jI.Q&#038;pos=10">too embarassing even for him to explain</a> (h/t <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2009/12/18/those-harvard-swaps-even-more-of-a-fiasco-than-we-thought/">Felix</a>); Ben Bernanke having decided <a href="http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/archives/2009/12/with-inflation-low-and-unemployment-high-bernanke.php">that doing only half his job should be enough</a> (h/t <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2009/12/links-for-2009-12-18.html">Brad DeLong</a>); and the general delusion that the banks <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2009/12/we-are-live-at-the-week-i-did-not-run-for-office-to-be-helping-out-a-bunch-of-fat-cat-bankers.html">are necessary to <em>and helping with</em> a recovery</a>.  And that&#8217;s off the top of my head.</p>
<p>As The Epicurean Dealmaker observed last week vin <a href="http://epicureandealmaker.blogspot.com/2009/12/for-every-action.html">a post eeryone should read</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Chancellor [of the Exchequer Alistair] Darling could not have <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/6284fdba-e4c3-11de-96a2-00144feab49a.html">been clearer</a>:<br />
<blockquote>“I’m giving them a choice. They can use their profits to build up their capital base, but if they insist on paying substantial rewards, I’m determined to claw money back for the taxpayer,” he said.</p></blockquote>
<p>[H]e plans to do this by making banks choose between their employees and their shareholders&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>Economists have made this point repeatedly: the first priority of people who run a business should be their responsibility to their shareholders. (See Steve Randy Waldman&#8217;s post <a href="http://www.interfluidity.com/v2/364.html">yesterday for a clear explanation</a>.  And then see <a href="http://www.interfluidity.com/v2/384.html">the post he pulled from comments after that</a>, which saves me the trouble of hoisting from another person&#8217;s comments again for the real ramifications of TARP and the bailout.  Why do Megan McArdle and the Administration hate the troops?)</p>
<p>Paying large bonuses while the banks themselves remain near insolvency is bad for the shareholders.  Goldman Effing Sachs <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/deals/2009/12/10/goldmans-new-pay-plan-what-it-really-means/">realizes that</a>, even if they didn&#8217;t quite go far enough.</p>
<p>Why do I believe the state of the TBTF Banks ranges from near insolvency (C, MS) to on the edge of insolvency?  The market tells me so.</p>

                                <p><strong>UPDATE</strong>:  It gets even stranger. The bankrupt-since-October-200<strong>8</strong> Lehman Brothers <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/fbd6b1ec-ea9b-11de-a9f5-00144feab49a.html">is going to pay $50,000,000 in bonuses for <strong>this</strong> year</a>.

<p>It appears all of the &#8220;gosh, we really made a lot of money from bailing out rich bankers who socked it to their customers&#8221; rhetoric is having <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB126100573858094185.html?mod=WSJ_hps_LEFTWhatsNews">a small problem in the realization</a>:<br />

<p>The huge offering encountered a lukewarm reception on Wall Street, where investors were skeptical of the company&#8217;s earnings prospects&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>Gosh, golly, gee. Really?  I wonder if that&#8217;s a recent phenomenon:
