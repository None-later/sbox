                                <p>Let me link to just two posts.  <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2007/06/02/giuliani-taxes">Nico</a> catches Rudy G. attacking Senator Clinton on her call for fiscal responsibility.  It seems Rudy thinks the economy under President Bill Clinton did poorly.  </p>
<p>Of course, Rudy is just trying to keep up with the two heads of the Siamese triplet known as Rudy McRomney.  <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2007/06/fareed_zakaria__1.html">Brad DeLong</a> brings us some keen observations from Fareed Zakaria as to how Rudy McRomney is playing into Al Qaeda’s hands by their fear mongering.  Brad summarizes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Fareed Zakaria says that Mitt Romney and Rudy Giuliani and company are worse than George W. Bush &#8230; Fareed Zakaria says that Mitt Romney and Rudy Giuliani and company are playing into the hands of Osama bin Laden &#8230; In fact, Fareed Zakaria says that Mitt Romney and Rudy Giuliani and company are cynically trying to outdo each other in stupidity &#8211; that they know that they are sacrificing the national security in the hopes of improving their chances of becoming president &#8230; I think it&#8217;s clearly time for all patriotic Americans to join in one common task: to shut down the Republican Party. It&#8217;s liability and a danger we can no longer afford.</p></blockquote>
<p>The American people fell for George W. Bush’s free lunch promises in 2000 and were persuaded by his fear mongering during the 2002 and 2004 campaigns.  But we finally woke up in 2006.  Is the Siamese triplet known as Rudy McRomney really dumb enough to think we will fall for this garbage again?  If it is, it is not smart enough to be our next President.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>I had a post about <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/02/god-punishes-us-when-we-collectively.html">real gdp per capita</a>.  I’m going to repeat that with some updated information and a graph below, but I’m also going to address some of the concerns from our friends on the right.</p>
<p>So, first thing’s first… the data comes from the BEA’s <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/Index.asp">NIPA Table 7.1</a>.  Graphically, it looks like this:</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RmMDXCSzEGI/AAAAAAAAAOY/FqwsFpumlKE/s1600-h/b+cycle+and+presidents,+graph.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RmMDXCSzEGI/AAAAAAAAAOY/FqwsFpumlKE/s320/b+cycle+and+presidents,+graph.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>A summary of these results:</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RmMDSSSzEFI/AAAAAAAAAOQ/Cc2cWmLCQcg/s1600-h/b+cycle+and+presidents,+table+1.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RmMDSSSzEFI/AAAAAAAAAOQ/Cc2cWmLCQcg/s320/b+cycle+and+presidents,+table+1.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Now, as noted <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/06/comparing-presidents-new-meme-emerges.html">here</a>, our Republican friends object to this – they feel the results are misleading.  They’ve raised several objections…  the first was that Congress was to blame.  But <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/02/god-punishes-us-when-we-collectively_16.html">here</a> I note that growth is faster under Democratic Congresses than under Republican Congresses, no matter what the party has the Presidency.  Those results were not satisfactory, so it was decided that the fault lay with lags – the idea being that it takes 8 years of a Republican administration before growth really starts to kick in, and that Republican administrations suffer from following Democratic administrations.  This explanation too has a few problems, mostly related to Ronald Reagan.  One is that after eight years of Ronald Reagan, another Republican, GHW Bush, had an abysmal performance – worse than any Democrat in the sample.  Another is more philosophical…  Republicans seem to adore Reagan.  To assume that lags are important enough to explain the difference between Democrats and Republicans is to assume that Reagan’s performance is due to Nixon and Ford, or worse, Jimmy Carter.  Clearly that would never do.  Another explanation is that real growth is an aberration – pick another series and we would see that Republicans in general outperform.  But regular readers know that by now I’ve run through a lot of series, and that isn’t happening either.</p>
<p>Which leads to the new explanation…  the business cycle.  We have to remove the effect of recessions.  Even before looking at data, I find this explanation lacking for three reasons.  One is that it ignores the fact that all else being equal, an incompetent President will make an economy worse, and a competent one will make the economy better.  A good President might be able to shorten negative effects, a bad one would exacerbate the problem.  Put another way… the economy could be in a lousy place in the business cycle because the President put it there.  Thus, accounting for the business cycle goes some way toward excusing a President’s own incompetence.</p>
<p>The second reason is that Clinton’s lack of a recession is unusual.   Democrats suffer from the business cycle too.  In Carter’s case, the recession began during his term – he may well have been partly to blame for it.  In JFK’s case, the recession was inherited.  His actions may have determined in part whether its effects were more or less severe.</p>
<p>The third reason is that this reason strikes me as grasping at straws, after 3 other explanations failed to work.  I would note that this explanation was originally put forth by our resident troll, whom we share with Maxspeak, but only recently got taken up by some of our more honest conservative commentators.  And I note that in my opinion,  we (And Maxspeak) were shortchanged in the troll department.  The folks who assign trolls clearly sent us what can only be charitable described as one of the lesser trolls.  I doubt he even graduated from troll school, much less achieved certification. </p>
<p>But enough of that.  Let’s see what the data says…  I got data on the recessions from the official arbiter of recessions, the <a href="http://www.nber.org/cycles/cyclesmain.html">NBER</a>.  But is it enough just to not count recessions?  Put another way… if I’m going to pick a measure that is biased toward Republican Presidents, I might as well go all the way.  Well, GW and his people like to tell us how well things have gone since about August or September of 2003.  That’s seven (maybe seven plus change) quarters since the last recession ended in November 2001.  People don’t tend to think in terms of 7 quarters, so I rounded up to 8 – a full 2 years.  So… I decided not to count not just the recession, but also the 8 quarters following the recession, in keeping with what the GW administration apparently would suggest.</p>
<p>The table below summarizes the results of this study, and looks at the quarterly growth rate for each of the administrations during periods when the data could be counted.  (Note:  some administrations appear twice.  For instance, consider the Ike administration.  The first figure (Ike 1) is for the period before the first recession in Q2 of 1954.  The second figure (Ike 2) is for the period after the first recession plus 8 quarters, and before the second recession from Q3 of 1957 to Q2 of 1958).</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RmMFsiSzEII/AAAAAAAAAOo/TfyL83eQ4MM/s1600-h/b+cycle+and+presidents,+table+2.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RmMFsiSzEII/AAAAAAAAAOo/TfyL83eQ4MM/s320/b+cycle+and+presidents,+table+2.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>(Note &#8211; the growth rate shown in the table is quarterly, not annual this time around.)</p>
<p>So what does this show?  First, even though the Republican sample is more heavily cherry picked (Republican Presidents seem to provide the American public with alot more opportunity to enjoy the pleasures of being in and recovering from recessions), Republican administrations still tend to perform worse.  Clinton now looks a bit worse… but that’s because his entire term is now going up against four quarters of the Nixon administration, or 72% of the Reagan administration.  And Clinton’s entire term still beats a cherry-picked GW term.</p>
<p>Bringing up the top of the list is JFK/LBJ.  But number two is… Jimmy Carter.  And the bottom half are all… predictably… Republican administrations.</p>
<p>(I would note…  as mentioned many times in the past, real GDP per capita is not really the best measure of performance for growth.  Because government spending is a factor in GDP, the government can boost GDP in the short term by pushing up debt.  As we’ve seen <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/02/god-punishes-us-when-we-collectively_19.html">here</a>, once you account for debt, Democrats take up the three to spots.  If you’re wondering why I didn’t do this analysis using that data, its because I can’t find quarterly figures for the debt.  If anyone has them, please send them my way.)</p>
<p>Anyway, it really doesn’t seem like taking into account the business cycle is particularly useful for the Republican cause, even doing so in the way intended to favor Republicans the most.  And so at least until another excuse is developed and found lacking, we are left with one of the following two conclusions:  either Democrats simply have better policies, on the average, or God intervenes to make things go badly in Republican Presidencies.</p>

<p>Stossel wants to dismiss the concerns over movements towards freer trade by focusing on the direct effect of an exchange.  If Joe purchases something from Jose, both Joe and Jose benefit from the exchange.  But the critics of free trade are not denying this proposition.  To suggest they are is the old <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man">Straw Man</a> trick.  </p>
<p>Recently, a friend gave me a copy of Stossel’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Myths-Lies-Downright-Stupidity-Shovel-Why/dp/1401302548">Myths, Lies, and Downright Stupidity</a>, which shot down all sorts of straw man arguments.  The stupidity here is why would anyone read such nonsense from Mr. Stossel?  Now if Mr. Stossel wish to rebut the Stopler-Samuelson proposition, then maybe it’s time to read his “wisdom”.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>I am behind on everything (blame the day job) including the latest from <a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm">BLS</a>.  I realized this when I was trying to catch the latest from <a href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/beat_the_press_archive?month=06&#038;year=2007&#038;base_name=missing_the_may_jobs_story#016762">Dean Baker</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Admittedly this was a tough report to read &#8211; 157,000 jobs isn&#8217;t bad &#8211; but reporters should be doing their homework. There is good reason to believe that the establishment survey (the one showing 157,000 new jobs) is now overstating employment because its imputuation for job growth in new firms not captured in the survey … Finally, the household survey is certainly showing real signs of weakness. The employment to population ratio has fallen from 63.3 percent in March to just 63.0 percent in the April and May data. This corresponds to 600,000 fewer people having jobs. That doesn&#8217;t happen in a strong labor market.</p></blockquote>
<p>All true but during May 2007, the increase in household employment was also 157,000 which is the same figure in the payroll survey.  BLS also reports that the unemployment rate did not change, which isn’t a surprise given that the employment to population ratio stayed at 63% and the labor force participation rate stayed at 66%.  So while there was a fall in the employment prospects as reported in the household survey from March to April – last month was sort of neutral.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://macroblog.typepad.com/macroblog/2007/06/is_unemployment.html">David Altig</a> also noticed the recent drop in the labor force participation rate:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is certainly true that the participation rate has been heading down over the course of the year. In the longer view, however, the change looks pretty unexceptional. If you break things down by age, you see some pretty standard looking variation in the participation of prime-age workers  &#8230; and yet another pronounced slide in the participation rate of 16-19 year olds &#8230; That drop in the participation rate of teenagers accounts for about one-third of the decline in the overall participation rate.  What&#8217;s more, the participation rates of individuals over 55 have been essentially flat, a marked change from the last decade over which those rates steadily rose. Combined with the declining rate of the youngest group of workers, the tailing off of participation among AARP-aged workers is enough to explain the entire decline in the aggregate participation rate since the beginning of this year.</p></blockquote>
<p>David was reacting to this concern of <a href="http://bigpicture.typepad.com/comments/2007/06/the_return_of_n.html">Barry Ritzholtz</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p>Most of us think about the unemployment rate going down due to more people getting jobs. But there&#8217;s also another way the official unemployment rate can go down. It happens when the denominator &#8211; the bottom number of the fraction &#8211; goes down. And that is what has been occurring again recently. The Labor Pool has shrunk, making the unemployment rate look better than it actually is.</p></blockquote>
<p>That sounds like what Dean said – and it also reminds me of stuff I’ve written before.  David goes into the details as he often does and comes out a bit less concerned about the alleged weakness of the labor market.</p>

<blockquote><p>The democratic keynesian approach leads to greater investment while the republican supply side concept of giving tax breaks to the investor class has failed to generate greater investment.</p></blockquote>
<p>What do you think? Is this a big part of the mechanism driving the difference we observe between the performance of Dems and Reps?</p>

                                <p>Regular readers are aware I&#8217;ve been taking various series and breaking them out by Presidential administration, thus comparing how the various Presidents did according to measures like real growth rates, abortions, national debt, etc. So far, almost the series show Democrats doing better than Republicans. (A not complete list can be found <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/05/comparing-presidents-comparing-parties.html">here</a>.)</p>
<p>Which has led to some commentary from our friends on the right. At first, the idea was that it was one series or two, so no big deal. Sure, Dems did better on those few series I had looked at, but if only I looked at series X or series Y, things would average out. But now the number of series has grown, and includes series X and series Y and more, and the expected convergence has not arrived.</p>
<p>Which led to a new argument. It could all be explained by lags. Republicans suffered from following Democrats and their lousy policies, Democrats benefited by from following Republicans and their brilliant policies. But that was dispensed with <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/05/democrats-republicans-and-lags.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>And now, in the comments section, I&#8217;m seeing a new meme emerge. Its the business cycle. If only we measured things from the same point in the business cycle, the performance of Republican Presidents would look much better (or the Democrats would look worse).</p>
<p>Regular readers also know what that means. It means I&#8217;m going to look at that question next. With data. I&#8217;ll try to get to it Sunday or Monday, and have a post up next week some time. </p>
<p>So here&#8217;s my prediction. I could be wrong, but I don&#8217;t think the business cycle explains the difference. I think taking into account the business cycle makes things better for Republicans because their policies have consequences, namely recessions and slower growth. But even so, I suspect that taking recessions into account is just not going to erase the difference. I expect on average higher growth rates under Democrats. I expect Reagan will probably fall in among the Democrats once his worse years are taken into account. I expect all the bottom performers to be Republicans. All of them. </p>
<p>Who knows, I could be wrong. Perhaps it is the business cycle. I&#8217;ll know in a few days. Maybe I have to rethink everything I know. It won&#8217;t be the first time, if I&#8217;m wrong.</p>
<p>But maybe I&#8217;m right. And if I am, my guess is the reaction from our friends on the right, and least some of them, will not be acceptance. Instead, they will find a new reason why the difference between the performance of Democratic Presidents and Republican Presidents is spurious. It may take a while for that reason to emerge, though.</p>

<p>I forgot one of the previous memes&#8230; Congress.  That one went the by the wayside <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/02/god-punishes-us-when-we-collectively_16.html">here</a>.</p>

                            </p>
                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>I was tanking up the other day. The Caravan fortunately and not the truck (33 gallons) when I noticed that diesel was about $0.20 less than regular. That seemed unusual from my recollection and got me wondering. So, I found this site by our government titled <a href="http://www.eia.doe.gov/oil_gas/petroleum/info_glance/petroleum.html">Energy Information Administration</a>.</p>
<p>You can down load all sorts of spread sheets. I picked the ones that had pricing and gallons sold in total and by US refiners.</p>
<p>First the total sold.<br />The black line is gasoline, the red is diesel. Both are millions of gallons times 100.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_ea3-LcbrX8A/RmCzAJoP7JI/AAAAAAAAAD8/66MBowtPk_w/s1600-h/Total+US+gallons+sold.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_ea3-LcbrX8A/RmCzAJoP7JI/AAAAAAAAAD8/66MBowtPk_w/s320/Total+US+gallons+sold.jpg" border="0"></a><br />Rather slow rising trends here. Infact, our gasoline use has only risen 39.53% from March 1994 to a peak in June 2005 at 39.53. Diesel peaked at 14.33 in June 2006. An increase from March 1994 of 53.1%.</p>
<p>Next is US refiners output.<br />Again., black is gasoline, red diesel in million of gallons times 100.
<div></div>
<p>
<div><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_ea3-LcbrX8A/RmCy6ZoP7II/AAAAAAAAAD0/4wcxqxgYYsU/s1600-h/US+Refinery+output.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_ea3-LcbrX8A/RmCy6ZoP7II/AAAAAAAAAD0/4wcxqxgYYsU/s320/US+Refinery+output.jpg" border="0"></a><br />Notice the decrease? Interesting that diesel was declining first. Gasoline output peaks at 6.54 in the last quarter of 1998 and the same in June 2001. It comes close in June 2002 at 6.49. The grandaddy is June 2003 at 6.68. From there it&#8217;s down hill to levels below the June 1996; 5.74 in March of this year, 5.78 in June 1996. Diesel peaks at 2.44 in March 2001 and never sees past 2.0 after March 2002. The only other time we saw less than 2.0 was December of 1994.<br />Did we suddenly start loosing refineries? We were putting out more every year until “everything changed”. Hummmmmmmmmmm. </div>
<div></div>
<div>And now for the money. Gasoline is black, diesel is red.</div>
<div>
<div></div>
<div><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_ea3-LcbrX8A/RmCyxZoP7HI/AAAAAAAAADs/ALMqfBgR6TE/s1600-h/Gas+&#038;+Diesel+price.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_ea3-LcbrX8A/RmCyxZoP7HI/AAAAAAAAADs/ALMqfBgR6TE/s320/Gas+%26+Diesel+price.jpg" border="0"></a> </div>
<p>Here is the world crude oil price by year.<br />It does look like the gasoline and diesel price lines. Your thoughts?</p>

                                <p>To all of you who have responded to my posting on Angry Bear, many thanks. I have enjoyed the dialogue and the sparring.  All of us, I believe, have our country’s interests at heart even though we may come at these issues from different perspectives. My purpose in writing <i>The Price of Liberty</i> — which, as I have noted in several postings is a quote from Hamilton about Revolutionary War debt and not about the Iraq War — was to trace the history of wartime financing from the Revolution through the War on Terrorism to see what we can learn from the past and how we can do things better. I think even those who have taken issue with me about the current set of policy issues will enjoy the history contained in the book.  I hope that whatever you think, you will let me know your thoughts, your comments and your criticisms. I hope you at least find it interesting — even if there are parts of it you disagree with.</p>
<p>Thanks again to Angry Bear for hosting me as a guest blogger this week.</p>

<p>Some final responses to your individual comments:</p>
<p>To Coberly: I have never tried to combine entitlements with politically-inspired constituency projects. Social Security will only be self-financed for another decade. After that, it will go into deficit. I have been, and am, a strong supporter of Social Security. Who are the real supporters of the Social Security system? Those who want to reform it now with a few minor adjustments to put it on a sustainable basis or those who want simply to let it get so far out of balance that wrenching reforms are needed later on that cause more pain? By refusing to accept the fact that some reforms are needed to ensure that is sustainable, you may actually be weakening it.</p>
<p>To Ilsm: There still are major dangers out there. How much we spend to combat them is one issue. How smartly we spend it is another. These require a major national dialogue. </p>
<p>To Chris: Good point. The war is only a part of the overall military spending. I wasn’t attempting to separate them. But the incremental cost of the war is about 1% of the GDP. This is not cheap, since the war will be the second most expensive in American history by the end of this year. </p>
<p>To Ilsm (again): I completely agree with your focus on costs and benefits. We need that in the defense budget and across the board. Also, the defense budget wasn’t the only part of military spending during these wars. World War II saw a lot of spending to build military plants that was not in the defense budget. And 1953 was not the high point year of the Korean War. It ended that year. The D.O.D. budget now is about 4%, but the marginal last of the war is about 1%</p>
<p>To Dan: A serious global threat is posed by extremists who want to acquire and deploy weapons of mass destruction. </p>
<p>To Lysistratra: The U.S. doesn&#8217;t borrow quite that much on a net basis now since the <br />deficit is only about $150 billion. But as you and I both know, that is deceptive, since a large part of the deficit is covered by the Social Security surplus. </p>
<p>To Ilsm (again): I agree. The military should have a pay raise and it requires bringing the marginal tax rate up to where it was in 2001 or some cuts in pork-barrel spending. That is fair and equitable. <br />I agree that the key issues are what we get for our money. I was only using the GDP comparison to reflect the relative cost of the war as a portion of GDP. Even if the war were a far smaller portion of GDP, we still need to use the resources efficiently — and that applies to all programs. </p>
<p>To dmarek: You would be much more effective if you expressed substantive thoughts rather that spewed out invectives. Try it!!!</p>
<p>To cursed: Your comments on Israel are really puzzling — and not very thoughtful!</p>
<p>To Coberly (again): Just what do you recommend to put the Social Security system on a sustainable basis? Wishful thinking?</p>

                                <p>A very interesting article <a href="http://blog.wired.com/defense/2007/05/building_a_fort.html">on the new US embassy in Baghdad</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In reality, American embassies are increasingly cut off from those very countries in which the U.S. is supposed to be fostering better relations, and worse, create caricatures of the detached diplomat more interested in tennis than work. Even in Doha, a relative safe haven from terrorism, the embassy is many meters off the main road, and to enter, you pass through a security checkpoint staffed by Filipinos. Depending on your business at the embassy, you then go through another layer of security to enter the building. Even for embassy employees, entering the building was time consuming. For foreigners, it could be a good chunk of the afternoon.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong><br />
<blockquote>This begs the larger question: What&#8217;s the point of the modern well-staffed embassy (which includes many agencies beyond the State Department)? Or in other words, what is the relevance of U.S. diplomatic presence abroad? At least in Baghdad, the embassy appears on a one-way collision course with that very question.</p></blockquote>
<p>I grew up in South America so I&#8217;ve had experience with the US consular system. When I was a kid, sure, there were Marine guards in bullet-proof guard huts checking you out, but in effect, you could walk in off the street. What happens to the point of an embassy or consulate if the locals can&#8217;t get in at all, and the consular staff lives apart from and has no interaction with the locals?</p>

                                <p>Via <a href="http://newmarksdoor.typepad.com/mainblog/2007/05/marketing_guru_.html">Newmark&#8217;s Door</a>, an article on <a href="http://www.forbes.com/2007/05/17/jack-trout-marketing-oped-cx_jt_0518trout.html?partner=yahootix">an article on how to evaluate advertising</a>. What&#8217;s missing from it&#8230; how to evaluate the only thing that matters about advertising:  is it effective?  Which requires looking at numbers.  But its not hard to do.</p>
<p>My experience with advertising:</p>
<p>1.  Most people in advertising do everything possible not to actually measure the effectiveness of their advertising campaigns<br />2.  Most advertising campaigns do not pay for themselves<br />3.  Some advertising campaigns are tremendously effective</p>
<p>Recently I had to tell a potential client not to hire me, but rather that it was time to sell the business.  (Unrelated&#8230; the Ex-GF is now starting a new career as a business broker.  Regular readers may recall she was originally considering real estate, but since she has been an entrepreneur all her life, and has had to sell her own business, this seemed like a better fit.  I have not, however, recommend her services, or even suggest them, to that client, though I may do so if we have further discussions.)  What I could do for him, while lucrative for me, would not pay off.  When I went to see him, he told me he was also considering spending a substantial amount on a one year advertising campaign.  The ad company is highly regarded, and somewhat expensive.  I asked him how he knew they were worth it.  They had shown him material they had done for other clients, and in his opinion it made sense according to information (which he had also gotten from them).  Nowhere was there any attempt to measure, to put a dollar figure, on the benefits they provide.</p>
