<blockquote><p>June 22, 2007</p>
<p>BAGHDAD &#8212; Iraqi leaders beginning a weeklong China visit are hinting at reigniting a Saddam-era oil deal, though such a move is clouded by Iraq&#8217;s stalled oil law.</p>
<p>President Jalal Talabani this week is leading a delegation that includes the oil minister and four other cabinet members, the first Iraqi head of state visit to China since diplomatic ties were set up in 1958, China Daily reports. &#8220;We encourage Chinese enterprises to join the multinational competition for exploration of Iraqi oilfields,&#8221; said Mohammed Sabir Ismail, Iraq&#8217;s ambassador to China. </p>
<p>The visit will encompass a spectrum of economic meetings, but with Iraq oil sales making up 93 percent of the federal budget and in deep need of investment, the petroleum sector is likely to top the bill. Iraq produces only 2 million barrels per day (bpd) now, down from 2.6 million bpd before the war. The country is home to 115 billion barrels of proven reserves, the third largest in the world. </p>
<p>While Iraq&#8217;s oil sector was crippled by sanctions, Saddam Hussein also mismanaged the sector, overworking it and depriving it of needed maintenance. He did sign numerous oil deals with various countries, including China. The Wall Street Journal reports that Talabani will try to renew a $1.2 billion deal to explore an oilfield in Iraq&#8217;s southern Wasit province, first signed in 1997 with the China National Petroleum Corp. &#8220;I am looking forward to the visit and hope it will open a new phase of the bilateral relations between the two countries,&#8221; Talabani told the Xinhua news agency. Oil minister Hussain Al Shahristani said during an October 2006 visit to China that negotiations over the Ahdab oilfield were to begin. </p>
<p>A law governing Iraq&#8217;s oil, however, has been stuck for months in political wrangling over control of the oilfields. Any new contract depends on the oil law, which may not even be introduced to Iraq&#8217;s parliament until the end of July. Without the law to dictate investment guidelines, violence in the country has also deterred oil companies. But China, working in Nigeria&#8217;s militant-laden oil sector and genocidal Sudan, may be willing to take the risk to meet its growing demand for oil.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Comparative advantage might be decreasing for US firms.  If you were an Iraqi nationalist, would you hold up the oil law, and seek a freer market for your country?</p>

<blockquote><p>Greenspan&#8217;s revelation and the contracts (PSA oil contracts) need to be discussed openly. The question must be asked, &#8220;Is our military there for the sake of oil?&#8221;</p>
<p>I have been struck by the use of the word &#8220;victory&#8221; by the right wing, especially by its propaganda arm, Freedom&#8217;s Watch. Usually, &#8220;victory&#8221; is used in reference to a war between countries over territory, where there is a definable enemy. That is not the case in Iraq, where we have for four years had an occupation, not a &#8220;war,&#8221; and there has been no clear enemy. We have mostly been fighting Iraqis we were supposed to be rescuing. &#8220;Victory&#8221; makes no sense for such an occupation. And even Petraeus has said that only a political, not a military, settlement is possible. In what sense can keeping troops there for 9 or 10 years or longer, as Petraeus has suggested, be a &#8220;victory&#8221;?</p>
<p>What is most frightening is that they may mean what they say, that they may have a concept of &#8220;victory&#8221; that makes sense to them but not to the rest of the country. If the goal of the invasion and occupation of Iraq has been to guarantee access to Iraqi oil for the next 30 years, then any result guaranteeing oil profits for American oil companies would count as &#8220;victory.&#8221; Suppose the present killing and chaos were to continue, forcing us to keep our troops there indefinitely, but allowing the oil companies to prosper under our protection. That would be a &#8220;victory.&#8221; Or if the Iraqi army and police force were to develop in a few years and keep order there protecting American investments and workers, that too would be &#8220;victory.&#8221; If the country broke up into three distinct states or autonomous governments, that too would be &#8220;victory&#8221; as long as oil profits were guaranteed and Americans in the oil industry protected. And it doesn&#8217;t matter if a Republican president keeps the troops there or a Democratic president does. It is still an oil company &#8220;victory&#8221; &#8230;<br />&#8230;<br />Indeed, Kurdistan&#8217;s PSA contract last week with Hunt Oil suggests the latter form of &#8220;victory.&#8221; As Paul Krugman observed in the New York Times on September 14, &#8220;the chief executive and president of Hunt Oil, is a close political ally of Mr. Bush. More than that, Mr. Hunt is a member of the President&#8217;s Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, a key oversight body.&#8221; Hunt Oil seems to have had the first taste of &#8220;victory.&#8221;</p>
<p>If that is &#8220;victory,&#8221; what is &#8220;defeat&#8221; and who is being &#8220;defeated?&#8221; The troops who would have to stay to protect the oil investments would, person by person, suffer defeat — a defeat of the spirit and, for too many, of the body. And most of America would suffer a defeat, especially our taxpayers who have paid a trillion dollars that could have gone for health care for all, for excellent schools and college educations, for rebuilding Louisiana and Mississippi, for shoring up our infrastructure and bridges, and for protecting our environment. Victory for the oil companies, defeat for most of America.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.globalpolicy.org/security/oil/2005/crudedesigns.htm#summary">Global Policy Forum</a> offers an analysis:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our key findings are:</p>
<p>At an oil price of $40 per barrel, Iraq stands to lose between $74 billion and $194 billion over the lifetime of the proposed contracts (2), from only the first 12 oilfields to be developed. These estimates, based on conservative assumptions, represent between two and seven times the current Iraqi government budget.</p>
<p>Under the likely terms of the contracts, oil company rates of return from investing in Iraq would range from 42% to 162%, far in excess of usual industry minimum target of around 12% return on investment. </p></blockquote>
<p>Hormats, in his visit here, said protection of energy sources was the big idea for defense as well as whatever he thought terrorists were, which he did not define.</p>
<p>If the premise is only &#8216;half right&#8217; for Iraq, if true believers thought so many ideas actually came together for the sake of democracy, vital US interests, and humanitarian concerns as the other half of the goalposts, does it still justify the profits from the PSA&#8217;s for the 80 working oilfields and already discovered oil, and does it not poison the professed concern?</p>
<p>&#8220;Victory&#8221; is certainly a flexible idea, but it feels to me we are paying twice, first to be hijacked, second to be rescued.</p>
<p>Update:</p>
<p>Greenspan corrected in a follow-up interview. [Bob Woodward in Monday&#8217;s Washington Post] He was only saying that &#8220;taking out Saddam was essential&#8221; for &#8220;oil security&#8221; and the global economy.</p>
<p>I fail to see the difference given the way the things are working. Opportunity costs.</p>

                                <p>A couple weeks ago, I tried to <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/08/comparing-presidents-rankings-of.html">rank Presidents by growth rates</a>.  This week I try to produce a similar ranking by fiscal responsibility.  </p>
<p>I’m going to try to stick to the numbers as much as possible, but no doubt some people won’t like the numbers I pick.  Nevertheless, I think in principal we can all agree (until the numbers come in)… in a time of national debts, a President who shrinks government spending and manages to bring in more revenue is fiscally responsible.  One who bloats the government and brings in less revenue is fiscally responsible.  </p>
<p>We begin with size of government, just to get a feel for where an administration’s priorities sit.  One measure of government that the President has a fair amount of control over is the number of civilian federal employees per 100,000 people.  The data, which goes back only to 1962 (and thus doesn&#8217;t include Ike), is graphed at <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/06/comparing-presidents-size-of-government.html">this post</a> and summarized in the table below…</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RvcaCuthUeI/AAAAAAAAAtA/ge7M6s06Cy4/s1600-h/federal+executive+employees+per+100K+people+-+summary.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RvcaCuthUeI/AAAAAAAAAtA/ge7M6s06Cy4/s320/federal+executive+employees+per+100K+people+-+summary.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>As we see, Clinton posted the biggest drop, followed by Nixon/Ford, GHW, Carter and GW.  Only Reagan and JFK/LBJ posted increases.  In JFK/LBJ’s case, it was to fight a war.  In Reagan’s – I’m not entirely sure.  But he sure talked a good game about shrinking government, didn’t he?</p>
<p>But what about all expenditures?  Well, <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/08/comparing-presidents-receipts-outlays.html">this post looked at</a> (among other things) Federal Outlays as a percentage of GDP.  Yes, Congress has a big say in this figure, but the President is the one who submits the budget to Congress, often has the support of a majority of the members of Congress, and wields a veto pen.  The table below summarizes outlays as a percentage of GDP.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RvcaPuthUfI/AAAAAAAAAtI/YMhppJim9T0/s1600-h/outlays+as+a+percentage+of+GDP+-+summary.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RvcaPuthUfI/AAAAAAAAAtI/YMhppJim9T0/s320/outlays+as+a+percentage+of+GDP+-+summary.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />As we see in the graph above, Clinton was, by a very large margin, the biggest cutter of spending.  And if you think that was a function of the dot com boom, or Newt Gingrich, wander over to the original post and look at the graph… outlays began dropping dramatically the year the man took office, so unless the tech boom started in 1993, or Newt had a time machine, the spending cuts in the Clinton era appear to be due to… Bill Clinton.  The next biggest spending cutter was Ike, although by the end of his term the trend had reversed itself.  Reagan managed to cut spending as a percentage of GDP too… by 0.23% a year.  The rest of the Presidents increased spending.  Nixon/Ford was the least spendthrift of these, followed by Carter, then GHW, then GW and JFK/LBJ.  Of course, GW still has time to build on his spending record.  </p>
<p>But spending isn’t a big deal if it leads to more growth, or its matched by revenues being generated.  This <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/08/comparing-presidents-receipts-outlays.html">post referenced above</a> also shows what receipts as a percentage of GDP look like.  The table below summarizes the changes seen during each administration:</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RvcafuthUgI/AAAAAAAAAtQ/KaM7bscUxb0/s1600-h/receipts+as+a+percentage+of+GDP+-+summary.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RvcafuthUgI/AAAAAAAAAtQ/KaM7bscUxb0/s320/receipts+as+a+percentage+of+GDP+-+summary.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>As the table indicates…  Clinton increased revenues as a percentage of GDP.  (Once again, I invite readers to check out the graphs in the aforementioned post…  this trend began immediately upon his taking office – in other words, its due to Clinton’s tax hikes and other policies, not the Republican Revolution or the tech boom or any other event that came later.)  Carter came in second.  JFK/LBJ came in third, but they saw a slight decrease in tax revenues.  They were followed by Nixon/Ford, Reagan, Ike, and GHW.  Bringing up the very, very distant rear was GW.  (Didn’t GW tell us recently how his tax cuts raised tax revenues?)  </p>
<p>Another way to look at tax revenues is through real revenues per capita…  a graph and a summary table are available <a her="“http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/09/comparing-presidents-real-tax-receipts.html”">here</a>.</p>
<p>Which brings us to the overall measure of fiscal responsibility…  the surplus or deficit.  Together with the graphs of receipts and outlays, you can find a graph of the evolution of <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/08/comparing-presidents-receipts-outlays.html">the surplus or deficit as a percentage of GDP here</a>.  A summary table appears below:</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RvcarethUhI/AAAAAAAAAtY/h0ng0THMEyY/s1600-h/surplus+or+deficit+as+a+percentage+of+GDP+-+summary.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RvcarethUhI/AAAAAAAAAtY/h0ng0THMEyY/s320/surplus+or+deficit+as+a+percentage+of+GDP+-+summary.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>(Note – because the surplus jumps from positive to negative, an annualized growth could not be computed.  Instead, the graph shows the change in the surplus or deficit as a percentage of GDP divided by the years in the term.)</p>
<p>And to make it easy, here’s a ranking:</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rvca2ethUiI/AAAAAAAAAtg/TXToXu9IEzM/s1600-h/surplus+or+deficit+as+a+percentage+of+GDP+-+rankings.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rvca2ethUiI/AAAAAAAAAtg/TXToXu9IEzM/s320/surplus+or+deficit+as+a+percentage+of+GDP+-+rankings.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Clinton is the clear winner – tops in increasing revenue and cutting spending, followed distantly by History’s Greatest Monster.  Ike came in third.  These were the only three fiscally responsible administrations… all others increased the deficit.  Reagan did so by the least, followed by Nixon/Ford.  JFK/LBJ were next, but GHW was virtually tied.  Bringing up the rear…  GW.  </p>
<p>Of course, running a deficit is OK if its going to lead to rapid growth.  But that doesn’t seem to be the case.  JFK/LBJ ran up a big deficit and also produced <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/08/comparing-presidents-rankings-of.html">commendable growth rates</a>.  However, Clinton, topped both sets of rankings, and Carter also did a good job by both measures.  Ike did well on fiscal responsibility, not so much on growth.  Reagan and Nixon came in the middle of the pack by both measures, and the Bush Presidents were Bush leaguers either way.  (Clearly data on economic growth and data on fiscal responsibility has Bush Derangement Syndrome!!!  Fortunately the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are going swimmingly, Osama has been jailed, the dollar is strong and the poverty rate is dropping precipitously or GW’s approval rating would be about 30% and his legacy would be one of failure.)</p>

The summary is posted, but the links and data are worth the time:</p>
<blockquote><p>President Bush gave a false description of proposed legislation to expand the 10-year-old federal program to provide health insurance for children in low-income working families.</p>
<p>He said it &#8220;would result&#8221; in covering children in families with incomes up to $83,000 per year, which isn&#8217;t true. The Urban Institute estimated that 70 percent of children who would gain coverage are in families earning half that amount, and the bill contains no requirement for setting income eligibility caps any higher than what&#8217;s in the current law.</p>
<p>He also said the program was &#8220;meant to help poor children,&#8221; when in fact Congress stated that it was meant to expand insurance coverage beyond the poor and to cover millions of &#8220;low-income&#8221; children who were well above the poverty line. Under current law most states cover children at twice or even three times the official poverty level.</p>
<p>The president also says Congress&#8217; expansion is a step toward government-run health care for all. It&#8217;s true that some children and families with private insurance are expected to shift to the government program. But the Congressional Budget Office estimates that such a shift is relatively low considering the number of uninsured these bills would reach.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>The Ex-GF was just in the supermarket.  (This is a big chain, not a mom-and-pop.)  The woman ahead of her in the check-out line wanted to pay her bills with a few rolls of nickels.  The supermarket&#8217;s position was that they would not accept payment of this sort.  The Ex-GF, who can be a bit combative at times, butted in and noted that nickels qualify as legal tender.  </p>
<p>Question&#8230;  is it even legal to refuse to accept payment for goods and services received in United States currency?  (I imagine it would be awfully hard for most websites to accept currency.  I also think of times when I was in South America and merchants displayed a strong preference for the greenback over the domestic paper.)</p>

                                <p>The LA Times carries <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-fg-iraq22sep22,1,28804.story?ctrack=1&#038;cset=true">this story</a> this morning:</p>
<blockquote><p>The security company Blackwater USA was approved Friday to resume escorting American officials in Baghdad, just days after the fatal shooting of 11 Iraqis galvanized the Iraqi government over the company&#8217;s conduct and the immunity its employees enjoy from Iraqi law.</p>
<p>The decision by the U.S. Embassy came despite Prime Minister Nouri Maliki&#8217;s insistence that the State Department sack the company and his government&#8217;s demand that Blackwater and other such security firms be stripped of the immunity granted them in 2004 by L. Paul Bremer III, the administrator of the former U.S.-led Coalition Provisional Authority.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ah yes&#8230;  if the Soviet Union&#8217;s embassy to a Warsaw Pact country decided to do X in 1977 would it really matter what that country&#8217;s government or people wanted one whit?</p>
<p>But no doubt some sort of a statement would be made&#8230; something that made it sound like the locals were in charge.  Something like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;This morning, we resumed taking requests for movements. The idea was to have limited movements outside the Green Zone. Obviously this was a step taken in consultation with the Iraqi authorities,&#8221; said embassy spokeswoman Mirembe Nantongo.</p></blockquote>
<p>Notice the word &#8220;consultation.&#8221;  Because the Soviet, er, US embassy wants to pretend it isn&#8217;t calling the shots.  So they follow up by having one of the useful puppets within the &#8220;host&#8221; country&#8217;s government called up to make a statement to add some verisimilitude.  Unfortunately, the ham-handed commissars always need to add in one more dig &#8211; even when trying to add the illusion of self-determination, its important to make it clear who is calling the shots lest anyone forget:</p>
<blockquote><p>A senior Iraqi lawmaker, Sami Askari, said officials would be informed of Blackwater&#8217;s whereabouts, but Nantongo denied that the embassy would be providing them precise details of their missions.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now, whether you want to say things are going well in Iraq or not, and whether you believe the Surge is working or not, can we at least stop pretending the Iraqi government and the Iraqi people today have any more relevance or ability to make decisions than the government of Poland and the Polish people during the Brezhnev era?</p>

<p>Update&#8230; <a href="http://www.crooksandliars.com/2007/09/21/blackwater-back-to-work-in-iraq/">Crooks and Liars</a> links to <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070922/ap_on_go_co/us_blackwater_probe_8;_ylt=AgDaYxCSuHn7_RIHtdf89BQE1vAI">another Blackwater related story</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Federal prosecutors are investigating whether employees of the private security firm Blackwater USA illegally smuggled into Iraq weapons that may have been sold on the black market and ended up in the hands of a U.S.-designated terrorist organization, officials said Friday.</p>
<p>The U.S. Attorney&#8217;s Office in Raleigh, N.C., is handling the investigation with help from Pentagon and State Department auditors, who have concluded there is enough evidence to file charges, the officials told The Associated Press. Blackwater is based in Moyock, N.C.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;<br />
<blockquote>According to officials in Washington, the investigation grew from internal Pentagon and State Department inquiries into U.S. weapons that had gone missing in Iraq. It gained steam after Turkish authorities protested to the U.S. in July that they had seized American arms from the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, rebels.</p>
<p>The Turks provided serial numbers of the weapons to U.S. investigators, said a Turkish official.</p>
<p>The Pentagon said in late July it was looking into the Turkish complaints and a U.S. official said FBI agents had traveled to Turkey in recent months to look into cases of missing U.S. weapons in Iraq.</p>
<p>Investigators are determining whether the alleged Blackwater weapons match those taken from the PKK.</p>
<p>It was not clear if Blackwater employees suspected of selling to the black market knew the weapons they allegedly sold to middlemen might wind up with the PKK. If they did, possible charges against them could be more serious than theft or illegal weapons sales, officials said.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve got all sorts of warm-and-fuzzies for Blackwater right now&#8230;</p>

                                <p>Via <a href="http://www.thecarpetbaggerreport.com/archives/12962.html">Steve Benen</a>, two stories&#8230;</p>
<p>The first, from <a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/2007/09/us_resumes_blackwater_convoys.php">TPM</a>, indicates that Blackwater is up and running in Iraq again.  Apparently the Iraqi government doesn&#8217;t want them there and they&#8217;re not subject to Iraqi laws.  Maliki may be a corrupt thug, and certainly no Imre Nagy or Alexander Dubček, but I bet most Iraqis can guess what it must have felt like to be a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_Revolution_of_1956">Hungarian in 1956</a> or   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prague_Spring">a Czechoslovakian in the tail end of August 1968</a>.  </p>
<p>Then there&#8217;s <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/21/washington/21contract.html?ei=5088&#038;en=6ff5d60f1fe4df5e&#038;ex=1348027200&#038;adxnnl=1&#038;partner=rssnyt&#038;emc=rss&#038;adxnnlx=1190378989-WeJh6ZnO6%20aifp79s3osqQ">this story</a> in the NY Times:</p>
<blockquote><p>Military officials said Thursday that contracts worth $6 billion to provide essential supplies to American troops in Kuwait, Iraq and Afghanistan — including food, water and shelter — were under review by criminal investigators, double the amount the Pentagon had previously disclosed.</p>
<p>In addition, $88 billion in contracts and programs, including those for body armor for American soldiers and matériel for Iraqi and Afghan security forces, are being audited for financial irregularities, the officials said.</p></blockquote>
<p>Between providing arms to the enemy, incompetence, and corruption on a massive scale, its a wonder this war is being prosecuted as inexpensively as it is.  I gotta give GW props for that.</p>

                                <p>Reader John Thompson points to a post at <a href="http://agonist.org/ian_welsh/20070919/the_saudis_call_bernankes_bluff">The Agonist</a> discussing the fact that the Saudis, for the first time, are not cutting rates in lock step with the US.  Put another way&#8230; this is what you expect to see when the Saudis are preparing to break the peg between their currency and the US dollar.  (Which, incidentally, means oil would probably not be priced in dollars much longer either.)</p>
<p>The Agonist then goes on to suggest that the right thing for Bernanke to do, right now, is raise rates, not lower them.  Anyway, its a post worth reading.</p>
<p>I would only add&#8230; there&#8217;s nothing magical about the US dollar.  There used to be another de facto world currency &#8211; the pound sterling.  There was much pain in Britain for a long time after the pound sterling fell from grace.  Part of that caused by the fall from grace, part caused by the factors that led to that fall.  And as I said, there&#8217;s nothing magical about the US dollar.</p>
