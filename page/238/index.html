                                <p>What is the point of BING ?  Brad DeLong <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2011/01/how-is-microsoft-doing-this.html#tp">notes that Microsoft&#8217;s web operations are losing amazing amounts of money, and asks how that is even possible</a>.</p>
<p>Google notes that Bing sure <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5748843/google-caught-bing-stealing-its-search-results">seems to be using their product without attribution. <br /></a> They made up words and then constructed google searches which gave results when asked to search for those words.  Then they noted that Bing searches gave the same results, which, they claim exist as google search results and in no other way.  I think that Bing had better run like a furry Turkey and hide all but two of its tentacles in a crevasse.</p>
<p>update:  Shane Greenstein explains and criticizes.  &#8220;using&#8221; was obviously not the right word. The right word, of course, was &#8220;mimic,&#8221; because (among other reasons see below) it is what Bing does.  </p>
<p>Which brings me to the point of this post.  Bing may be losing money and it may or may not be cheating, but it sure contains cool Octopus videos.  </p>
<p>Many have seen <a href="http://www.geekologie.com/2011/01/what_were_you_doing_in_there_o.php">the Octopus in a bottle</a> (which briefly made page 1 that is www.msn.com).  </p>
<p>But the Octopus mimic is much cooler.</p>

<p>My view of the furry turkey on human legs is that the Octopus is pretending to be a detached sponge being carried on a current of water.  The human running looks like bouncing off the bottom and not like sliding along the bottom (like an octopus) or swimming through the water (like an octopus).  Or maybe predatory fish have senses of humour and are paralysed by laughter.  It&#8217;s hard to fully grasp the subtleties of the mimic octopus&#8217;s strategy.</p>
<p>My prediction RE the &#8220;three or four&#8221; divers debating what the saw is that one day the four will come up, take off their masks, and discuss what the octopus was mimicking. Then three of them will remember that only three divers went down and wonder which one is the Octopus mimicking a diver.</p>
<p>My title expresses my theory that, someday soon, when it is the best way to scare off a predator, the Octopus will sing the famous &#8220;Swang Song.&#8221;</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Paul Krugman <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/03/economic-growth-and-household-income/">notes</a> that average household income has grown markedly less than GDP per household since 1973.</p>
<p>He discusses the two most important factors.  The cost of employee benefits (health insurance) have increased more than wages and are not counted in personal income, and household income is top coded &#8212; the very highest incomes are recorded just as more than x  ($250,000 last I checked) so the increased income of the very rich does not appear in average household income.</p>
<p>I consider four other factors but don&#8217;t believe or don&#8217;t have much to say about three (all after the jump).  The one that interests me, causes me to invade Rebecca&#8217;s turf and may have caused me to demonstrate my ignorance of NIPA terminology is GDP vs Net DP, which means net of depreciation of capital.  GDP-NDP isn&#8217;t income and, therefore isn&#8217;t any household&#8217;s income.  </p>
<p>I tried to Fred and got <a href="https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?graph_id=36311&#038;category_id=0">this graph</a><br />  I think that (GDP-NDP)/GDP has increased about 2.5% of GDP since 1973 so about 2.8% of NDP.  Caveat Lector, I might be making a fool of myself. </p>
<p>The idea is that information equipment (computers) has become a larger and larger fraction of the capital stock and that it loses value very fast due to technological obselescence.</p>
<p>Three other possible explanations are discussed after the jump</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>1. Undistributed profits including the increase in assets of nonprofit corporations (like most hospitals). Part of GDP but anyone&#8217;s personal income. Doesn&#8217;t do the trick &#8212; hasn&#8217;t grown much.</p>
<p>2. Under-reported income. Capital income seems to be under-reported. I would guess mostly honest mistakes but maybe a bit of tax evasion times don&#8217;t trust that the BLS doesn&#8217;t talk to the IRS (it doesn&#8217;t squeel dear reader &#8212; answer honestly) . The share of capital has grown.  I think one could look at reported capital income compared to NIPA capital income minus reinvested profits, but I won&#8217;t try that right now.</p>
<p>3. GNP vs GDP we have gone way into debt. National income should be decreasing compared to GDP. But it isn&#8217;t (point of an informal debate Krugman had at NBER in 1988 with Summers when Krugman said &#8220;zero isn&#8217;t an especially important number.&#8221; Brad DeLong has blogged about the debate.</p>

                                <p>I wasn&#8217;t going to mention Melissa Mia Hall&#8217;s death here—this is economics and politics, not sf—but now it is clear that, as usual, <a href="http://thelipstickchronicles.typepad.com/the_lipstick_chronicles/2011/02/the-least-of-us.html">there is an overlap</a>:<br />
<blockquote>If she had seen the doctor, most likely he would have suspected more than a pulled muscle and would have ordered a life-saving EKG.</p>
<p>As Texas lawyer, writer and Melissa&#8217;s friend, Laurie Moore, wrote to me, &#8220;She would&#8217;ve had a huge doctor bill she couldn&#8217;t pay, and would probably have lost her house over it, but she would be alive instead of taking pain pills and dying in the night. &#8220;</p>
<p>In the end, Melissa didn&#8217;t die from an overdose, not even an accidental one; Melissa died of the very heart attack she feared&#8230;.</p>
<p>Melissa worked hard. She owned a home. She paid her taxes. She was trying to live a dream &#8211; the American Dream &#8211; that supposedly we as citizens are promised &#8211; the right to pursue life, liberty and happiness. For her, that couldn&#8217;t be achieved in a traditional job that came with the perks of health care.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is the quintessential &#8220;hard-working American&#8221; who gets talked about by The Teabaggers as if nothing ever goes wrong and <a href="http://slog.thestranger.com/slog/archives/2011/01/31/and-here-i-thought-the-purpose-of-the-oped-page-was-to-promote-debate-not-crush-it">they never need &#8220;government help</a>.&#8221; (link h/t <a href="http://www.eschatonblog.com/2011/01/rural-counties-are-sucking-us-dry.html">Dr. Black</a>) This is <a href="http://blogs.publishersweekly.com/blogs/genreville/?p=978">the woman of whom Peter Cannon (via Rose Fox)* said</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Melissa contributed hundreds of reviews to PW, in all different genres, as well as dozens of Q&#038;As. In recent years, ever reliable and diligent, she was reviewing three books a week for me&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>This isn&#8217;t someone who was getting &#8220;fails to perform&#8221; ratings or &#8220;stealing&#8221; a house. This is someone whose every effort was aimed at making money and paying bills to keep what little she had gained. She used her skills—human capital, painfully developed—and made rational decisions.</p>
<p>And the rational <em>ex ante</em> decision not to use the medicines she needed or to have to pay out of pocket for an exam that may well lead to more expenses that are beyond her liquidity constraints are, well, exactly what we teach as &#8220;correct&#8221; in Ph.D. micro- and macro- Economics courses.</p>
<p>So this isn&#8217;t a science fiction post, because no one who reads and writes science fiction would believe that a hard-working, conscientious person with great skills, a positive personality, and diligent attention to opportunities would die because they couldn&#8217;t afford to live.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an economics and politics post, one I wish I hadn&#8217;t had to write.</p>
<p>*Full disclosure: I&#8217;ve known Peter Cannon for years; he edited both myself and my wife at PW. (Full, full disclosure: he fired me, after having previously turned down my request to quit for a while. Both were good decisions on his part.) I&#8217;ve met Rose Fox several times and she edited my wife for a while when PW still paid something resembling minimum wage for the effort required.</p>

<p><strong>Roger Vinson, Sophism King</strong> </p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.pensapedia.com/wiki/Roger_Vinson">Federal District Judge Roger Vinson’s</a> <a target="_blank" href="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/national/20110131VINSON_HEALTH.pdf">opinion issued the other day</a> ruling the Healthcare Act an <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/01/us/01ruling.html?_r=1">unconstitutional overreach by Congress</a> is so replete with sophisms that it’s hard pick the most ridiculous of them. But my candidates are:</p>
<blockquote><p>“[W]hat if two of the purported “unique” factors &#8212; inevitable participation coupled with cost-shifting &#8212; are present? For example, virtually no one can opt out of the housing market (broadly defined) and a majority of people will at some point buy a home. The vast majority of those homes will be financed with a mortgage, a large number of which (particularly in difficult economic times, as we have seen most recently) will go into default, thereby cost-shifting billions of dollars to third parties and the federal government. Should Congress thus have power under the Commerce Clause to preemptively regulate and require individuals above a certain income level to purchase a home financed with a mortgage (and secured with mortgage guaranty insurance) in order to add stability to the housing and financial markets (and to guard against the possibility of future cost-shifting because of a defaulted mortgage), on the theory that most everyone is currently, or inevitably one day will be, active in the housing market?”</p></blockquote>
<p>And:<br /><a name="more"></a><br />
<blockquote>“It is difficult to imagine that a nation which began, at least in part, as the result of opposition to a British mandate giving the East India Company a monopoly and imposing a nominal tax on all tea sold in America would have set out to create a government with the power to force people to buy tea in the first place. If Congress can penalize a passive individual for failing to engage in commerce, the enumeration of powers in the Constitution would have been in vain for it would be /difficult to perceive any limitation on federal power’ [quoting from United States v. Lopez, a1995 Supreme Court opinion] and we would have a Constitution in name only.” </p></blockquote>
<p>Presumably the federal government’s attorneys will point out on appeal that a law requiring individuals above a certain income level to purchase a home financed with a mortgage (and secured with mortgage guaranty insurance) in order to add stability to the housing and financial markets (and to guard against the possibility of future cost-shifting because of a defaulted mortgage) would place the mandate on those who are unlikely to default, and that, by contrast, the Healthcare Act places the mandate on those who are likely to eventually use the healthcare system and shift the cost to the public.</p>
<p>The purpose of the mandate in the Healthcare Act is, in other words, the opposite of the purpose of the judge’s hypothetical wealthy-individuals-must-take-out-a-mortgage-to-buy-a-home statute.  </p>
<p>And, whether or not it is difficult to imagine that a nation which began, at least in part, as the result of opposition to a British mandate giving the East India Company a monopoly and imposing a nominal tax on all tea sold in America would have set out to create a government with the power to force people to buy tea in the first place, it is unlikely that the Framers would object to a law that required people to pay for their tea rather than shifting the purchase price to the public. It also is unlikely that the Framers would think people who do are passive individuals who are failing to engage in commerce. The use of the word “mandate” to describe Britain’s conferring of a monopoly and its imposition of a tea tax is cute, but all tax laws are mandates, as are many other laws.</p>
<p>I haven’t read § 1501(a)(1) of the Act, but based on this judge’s stream-of-consciousness analogies, his interpretive skills seem lacking enough for me to doubt the accuracy of his claim that that section grounds its appropriateness under the Commerce Clause on the law’s inclusion of the mandate. I suspect that that section of the statute actually claims for its authority under the Commerce Clause that individuals who do not have health insurance are not passive at all, because they are likely to eventually use the healthcare system and shift the cost to the public.</p>

                                <p>by <strong>Dale Coberly</strong></p>
<p><strong>Eyes on the Prize <br />A Social Security summary.</strong>  </p>
<p>We have had twenty years and a billion dollars spent by Pete Peterson and friends telling the people that Social Security is going broke and will create huge deficits that will kill the economy and be a crushing burden to the young. Peterson has funded an army of &#8220;non partisan experts&#8221; who tell the media what to say and what not to say about Social Security. </p>
<p>On the other side we have had Bruce Webb&#8230; who does all the hard work&#8230; showing that the reports of Social Security going broke are based on assumptions that seem unlikely. Moreover he has shown that each year since we have been treated to the &#8220;we must fix (cut) Social Security NOW&#8221; , &#8220;doing nothing now&#8221; has actually reduced the cost of any ultimate fix. </p>
<p>We have had professer Rosser show that even under the pessimistic assumptions Social Security with no changes at all will still be able to pay a benefit that is larger in real value than what retirees get today. <br /><a name="more"></a> <br />And we have had Coberly show that even under the Trustees projections&#8230; the ones that produce the &#8220;Five Trillion Dollar Unfunded Deficit!&#8221; (or Fifteen Trillion if you want to add up the cost out to &#8220;the infinite horizon&#8221;), the actual cost to each worker would be a raise of less than a dollar per week from time to time over the next seventy five years, and then no further increases after that. </p>
<p>And we should not forget that CBO has published an &#8220;option number three&#8221; that shows the cost of one way of fixing Social Security would be a payroll tax increase of one half of one tenth of one percent per year. One half of one tenth of one percent of an average worker&#8217;s pay today is forty cents per week, and the boss pays half of that. </p>
<p>Then, we have the good people who want to &#8220;fix Social Security&#8221; by taxing the rich&#8230; either by raising the cap, or by dedicating the estate tax to pay for Social Security. These people do not know, or do not understand that this is exactly what FDR was careful NOT to do. He did not want Social Security to be &#8220;the dole&#8221; &#8220;so that no damn politician can take it away from them.&#8221; </p>
<p>And we have the really bad people who want to fix Social Security by raising the retirement age. &#8220;It&#8217;s the obvious solution,&#8221; they say. &#8221; After all, we are going to be living longer.&#8221; It never troubles them that if people can pay for their own retirement (with an extra forty cents per week per year) they may not want to work longer, or they may have other age related conditions that will not reduce their life expectancy but may make working painful. But people with jobs they like can&#8217;t imagine why working people might want to stop working for the boss and have a few years of freedom before they die. </p>
<p>And we have the strange people who tell us that paying BACK the money that Congress borrowed FROM Social Security&#8230; that is from the workers&#8217; savings&#8230; will cause the country to collapse: we need to stiff the workers so the bankers can keep their million dollar bonuses for the excellent way they have been managing the economy. </p>
<p>And we have recently had the President and Congress, who decided that since we are facing a &#8220;looming deficit&#8221; the smart thing to do was to cut taxes. This way they have given you your retirement money to spend now, because they know an extra ten dollars a week spent at Wal Mart will mean more to you than an extra year of retirement. </p>
<p>And we have the eternal obfuscators who will come into any discussion and do everything they can to distract your attention from the basic fact: </p>
<p>Social Security is YOUR money. It doesn&#8217;t cost &#8220;the government&#8221; a dime. Social Security is the ONLY way most workers have to save their own money, safe from inflation and market losses, so they can retire at a reasonable age. And the cost of keeping this insurance is so small no one would even notice it, if it wasn&#8217;t for the Big Liars finding ways to make it seem like it was a huge number, or an &#8220;unfair&#8221; windfall to old people at the expense of the &#8220;young&#8221; who will never, of course, ever get old themselves. </p>
<p>I have done the math. So has CBO. The cost of keeping your Social Security insurance, just in case you do get old without getting rich, looks like about a forty cents per week increase in the payroll tax each year, while incomes are expected to go up about ten dollars per week each year. </p>
<p>Try to keep that in mind when the man in the suit is selling you snake oil.</p>

<p><strong>Prices and Quantity for Whale Oil and Whale Bone</strong><br />Cross posted at the <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=317">Presimetrics blog</a>.</p>
<p>The following graph shows the price and quantity of Sperm whale oil (which is actually more of a wax).</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TUdTVLX1kaI/AAAAAAAAAho/tHUcq8MRqig/s1600/whale1.bmp"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TUdTVLX1kaI/AAAAAAAAAho/tHUcq8MRqig/s400/whale1.bmp" border="0" alt=""></a>Figure 1</p>
<p>The positive correlation is a bit of a problem, and the fact that Quantity seems to lead Price by about ten years is a bit more of a problem.</p>
<p>Now, that could be just an interesting artifact, except for this graph, which shows the price and quantity of whale oil (and this time I do mean oil).  </p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TUdTVZrqFKI/AAAAAAAAAhw/y0ilS3a4w4k/s1600/whale2.bmp"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TUdTVZrqFKI/AAAAAAAAAhw/y0ilS3a4w4k/s400/whale2.bmp" border="0" alt=""></a>Figure 2</p>
<p>Notice that the correlation is negative (sigh of relief) but once again, you get some information about prices from quantities produced decades earlier.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s whale bone.  Its worse.</p>

<p>So what&#8217;s going on?</p>
<p>This post comes from something I&#8217;m playing with at work (I&#8217;m trying to understand how a few specific commodities might play out over a very long period of time) and is posted with the permission of my boss.  (Thanks Lauren!)  I don&#8217;t usually like to play with data that goes that far back as it isn&#8217;t always reliable but I figured this was fine for broad strokes purposes.</p>
<p>Price and quantity data from <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/">A History of the American Whale Fishery</a> by Walter Sheldon Tower, Tables IV and V.  Data was entered by hand so hopefully I didn&#8217;t screw up too much too badly.  CPI estimates from the <a href="http://www.minneapolisfed.org/community_education/teacher/calc/hist1800.cfm">Minnesota Fed</a>.</p>
<p>If you want my spreadsheet let me know &#8211; I&#8217;m at mike  period my last name (one m only) at gmail.com.</p>

<p>Reporting in so far from Mass., Rhode Island, Ohio, New York, Michigan, Illinois, on the snow storm surging across a third of the US.  No pictures yet. </p>
<p><strong>Dan B</strong>. says:</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve had enough.  Between plowing my office, the shop, the home and mom&#8217;s.  Then snow blowing the piles to make room for more.  Being, literally up to my hips in snow cleaning off the greenhouses and cancelling my office because I can not keep the hill of the driveway clean&#8230;<br />I&#8217;ve had enough.</p>
<p>After this current storm, I have a friend coming to the office with his Bobcat to clean out the 8 to 10&#8242; high mounds on both sides of the driveway at the bottom.  I have a unique situation such that the highway plows unload 2.5 lanes of snow that has been pushed for 200&#8242; the minute they hit my driveway.</p>
<p><strong>Spencer England</strong> says:</p>
<p>I’ve been in New England since 1974 and this is the first time I’ve ever hired anyone to do my driveway. Although after the blizzard of 1978 I did hire a crew to shovel<br />the snow off my roof. That one storm dropped five feet of snow. In the Boston area we are seeing building collapse already from the heavy snow on flat roofs even before this storm hits.  In one parking garage two guys were trapped in their car when the  roof collapsed on them. We already have five feet of snow and I am running out of room to but more.</p>
<p>Just did my deck shoveled before this storm for the first time this season. It was still relatively light snow, not ice and I could slide most of it under the railing rather than lifting it.. They expect the second snow this week to be a heavy wet one with freezing rain, etc<br /><a name="more"></a><br /><strong>Mike</strong> says:</p>
<p>I live sox blocks from the office and walk to work every day.  It was a very slow trudge today.  I suspect it will be worse tomorrow.  We also feed some feral cats and one dog which requires a drive.  It sucks in this weather but they gotta eat.</p>
<p><strong>Rebecca</strong> says:</p>
<p>I have to shovel a 2&#8242; by 10&#8242; sidewalk.</p>
<p><strong>Dan C.</strong> says:</p>
<p>Back in the day the private contractor who plows for the town had his young daughter with him, and Linda provided hot chocolate and coffee for the two (or me some other times) the next couple winters.  His daughter is in high school now, but he plows the area which includes our driveway and walk area.  At this point I am estatic for the favor.  I had to shovel a section of the roof for ice dams.</p>
<p>Of course the snow piles are over 8 feet by tonite.</p>
<p>No word from Linda or Ken, but my Chicago son says lots of snow for that city. I can hear Rusty grumbling from here!  As people check in I will add comments.  I expect Robert is doing fine with the weather in Italy.  Noni Mausa has the dogs out and sleds ready. </p>
<p><strong>Run75441</strong> says:</p>
<p> &#8230;work in Upstate New York in the snow belt and we are over 110 inches since December. We get plenty of snow. If you don&#8217;t like cross country skiing, downhill, or snowshoe-ing; you go dormant. Got snowshoes for Christmas as my oldest son kept my cross country skiis.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Just how easy is it to use <a href="https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/">FRED</a> ?  I will find out starting four minutes ago, I am trying to set up a FRED account and generate a graph of interest (CPI inflation and nominal wage inflation plotted on time).  </p>
<p>I have an account.</p>
<p>19 minutes in.  I have downloaded data.  Not the data I should have downloaded but that&#8217;s not FRED&#8217;s fault.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t blame FRED.  I can&#8217;t handle Excel.</p>
<p>OK here we are 58 minutes in.  I can handle FRED.  Unfortunately while I am a US citizen and, in theory, a macroeconomist, I don&#8217;t know anything about US macro time series (I haven&#8217;t dealth with them in over 20 years).  I don&#8217;t understand why the FRED employment cost index starts in 2001 or so.  I barbarically constructed something which has something to do with wages with the snappy name WASCUR-PAYEMS which is equal to the percent change since a year ago of WASCUR (Compensation of Employees: Wages &#038; Salary Accruals) minus the percent change since a year ago of PAYEMS (total non-farm payrolls, all employees).</p>
<p>I still don&#8217;t know how to embed the graph which is called <a href="https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?graph_id=36195&#038;category_id=0">Ned Meet Fred</a>.</p>
<p>I admit that WASCUR &#8211; PAYEMS is no good.  WASCUR doesn&#8217;t include fringe benefits.  Also it corresponds to quarterly pay not hourly pay, so fluctuations in hours worked per worker show up as if they were wage inflation.</p>
<p>Nonetheless my graph Ned Meets Fred does not fit my prediction (my record remains perfect).  WASCUR &#8211; PAYEMS does not look like the Atlanta Fed&#8217;s index of sticky prices.  It was highly correlated with the CPI in the late 40s back when unions were really strong,  not correlated in the 70s back when US nominal wage rigidity was justly famous, and is now correlate again. </p>
<p>This feeble effort to deal with US time series data offers something less than no support for <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/01/the-un-cola-era/">Paul Krugman&#8217;s Un-COLA hypothesis</a>.</p>
