<p>A common irony related to me in early 1990&#8217;s attributed to Norm Augustine,<br />former chairman of Lockheed Martin, one of the top 5 defense coroporations, edited for brevity and from memory:</p>
<p>&#8216;As we design more expensive stuff, eventually we will be able to afford just one airplane.  This super airplane will be available to the Navy one day a week, the Air Force one day a week and the marines one day every other week.</p>
<p>But we will have the best and most advanced airplane in the world&#8217;.</p>
<p>The come back is, more money for the airplane, we do not need to have health care for anyone.</p>
<p>three dots&#8230;</p>
<p>You have asked about one of several significant  myths about &#8220;national security&#8221; capacity.</p>
<p>That is that we:  &#8220;We don&#8217;t need the ships or planes now, but we have an &#8220;efficient&#8221; (Lemma: the industrial base is not efficient) defense industrial base, (which we do not) that creates needs to spend money on unneeded stuff to stay effcient (Lemma: the industrial base is not efficient), in case we ever need it.&#8221;  </p>
<p>A myth but it sells unneeded stuff.  Making the military budget a jobs and profit program.</p>
<p>Corrollary:  To keep the industrial base we choose the most expensive and wasteful way to fight: you have a hammer (US high tech industrail warfare state output) every enemy looks like a nail (Nazi).</p>
<p>The real issue is what do we need?  To decide this we need to define our enemies, their intentions, their capabilities and how we fix on the threat posed by<br />intentions and capabilities and how we counter them. </p>
<p>We have nukes for deterent and I am in favor of Mutual Assured Destruction.  It has prevented many silly forays.</p>
<p>The myth of maintaining a good (which we do not have now) industrial bases denies debate about real needs.</p>
<p>If we do not need any more nuclear subs then we will not need them if, exceptionally unlikely anyone will tilt at us in the nuclear sub realm, and diesels are<br />much more effective than the WW II ones who had to surface each night, the balloon goes up.</p>
<p>That myth is deliberate obfuscation, to get you to spend money on things not needed.</p>
<p>You ask:  &#8220;If it (a mix of Navy and Private Shipyards, the Navy Yard in Portsmouth, NH, the private in Norfolk, Va and maybe one on the west coast) stopped<br />building, it could lose the capability of building.&#8221;</p>
<p>The myth is we have any where near an efficient capability to build nuclear subs now.</p>
<p>The motive is transferring money collected mostly from payrolls taxpayers to the shipyards.</p>
<p>If it is a national priority to be able to make nuclear subs, and there is no vital need for the end item now, then the Navy yard in NH wins.  </p>
<p>That priority is then a national security issue and that becomes an inherently governmental function.</p>
<p>But, the myth of keeping the warfare state in work is common.</p>
<p>Suppose we did not have a nuclear submarine building capability?  What would it take to get one?  </p>
<p>When I was a less mature (read young, although I am still a kid) supply officer I did an inventory optimization study on useful things that had scarce resources and also a large amount of work to make those resources into a product.</p>
<p>It was the mid 1970&#8217;s I was stationed in (removed by cactus), lots of time and my new bride worked odd shift.</p>
<p>My youthful conclusion was you &#8216;stockpiled the hard to get things, and kept the machinery ready but you waited until actual need to put it all together.&#8217;</p>
<p>This avoided wasting the labor input as well as the costs to store the fully built thing.</p>
<p>Also if we build nuclear subs or anything else we have to add new technology as it comes up.  COntinuing work on unneeded stuff.  I think of wate here.</p>
<p>Now in the case of nuclear subs:  there is a class of wielder they worry about, but guess what.  The same guys weld and fix welds on nuclear plants.  I know one<br />person who has mesothieliomoa, the asbestos thing.</p>
<p>You do not need navy shipyards to keep wielders around who can meet spec for the reactors, nor the depth hulls.</p>
<p>You may look at during mobilization bringing these men and women to work in Portsmouth.</p>
<p>Finally, the Nuc reactor issue.  Do you know, that it costs 2 Billion dollars to rebuild the reactor on a Nimitz class aircraft carrier?</p>
<p>three dots&#8230;</p>
<p>There is a movement that gets shouted down that says nucs are no good at sea.</p>
<p>The great container ships and tankers which are tonnage far bigger than carriers do not use nuclear power.</p>
<p>Further, the issue with carriers is not boiler fuel it is being tied to oilers to bring up aviation fuel.</p>
<p>Being an Air Force guy, I can state, with no service bias, the truth that if air bases are nearby I can run 18 F-16s and deliver more bombs than a $10-15 billion<br />carrier Battle group, and the Navy cannot put one in a sea where the Air Force and Marines cannot cover them with land air.</p>
<p>So, do we need carriers?  No!  Do we need nuclear subs, no.</p>
<p>The illusion of keeping the industrial base just in case stops people short of asking about the basic need question.</p>
<p>Look at the F-22, not needed.  A week or two ago I was in a hotel on a business trip, talking to a retired AF pilot, now a contractor he agreed the F-22 was not needed.  I did not share my radical views and we had not met before.</p>
<p>What happened?  The need was non existent, the thing sold to keep money going to Lockheed, for the above mythology.  Now there is a huge amount of scrap and rework.</p>
<p>Aside from that:  congress limited the total costs to deliver the airplane to $38B in a constant year money.  The program started with 750 airplanes for that<br />ceiling cost.  Now the Air Force gets 180. </p>
<p>That kind of wonderful industrial base will kill the US Air Force.</p>
<p>Some reason to keep that industrial base going.</p>

                                <p>Forgive the lengthy post, but this one is going to cover a lot of turf.</p>
<p>Last week I had a few posts about the differences between elected Republicans and elected Democrats.  I noted that for whatever reason, we observe higher growth rates in real <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/02/god-punishes-us-when-we-collectively_14.html">real (GDP less increase in national debt) per capita</a> under Democratic Presidents than under Republican Presidents.  In fact, looking at complete administrations (i.e., assuming JFK &#038; LBJ form one administration, and Nixon &#038; Ford form another), all three Democratic administrations outperform all five Republican administrations.  I noted this discrepancy was true for Congress; <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/02/god-punishes-us-when-we-collectively_16.html">real per capita growth less increases in the debt was higher under Democratic Congresses than under Republican Congresses</a>.</p>
<p>I advanced a few <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/02/god-punishes-us-when-we-collectively_15.html">guesses</a> as to why this discrepancy might be observable which I hope to test as time permits, but I think perhaps the biggest one is simply that Democrats tend to pursue policies that are less likely to run up the debt.</p>
<p>Today I want to approach this from a different angle…  what else determines differences in growth in the various presidencies.  I’m going to start with a hypothesis…  just as fiscal policy (e.g., attitudes toward debt and taxation) matters, so does monetary policy.  But simply looking at a growing or shrinking money supply does not tell us whether monetary policy is expansionary or not.  After all, with more people, growth, or inflation, more money is needed just to maintain the same level of, well, lubrication in the economy.  Thus, I want to look at the change in the real Money Supply per capita; that is, the increase (or decrease) in the amount of M1 (or M2) per person above and beyond inflation.  (Sadly, that data is only available beginning in 1959, so Ike drops out of the analysis.)  </p>
<p>The table below shows the annualized percentage growth in real (GDP less debt) per capita, the annualized percentage change in real M1 per capita, and the annualized percentage change in real M2 per capita for the various administrations beginning in the sample.  It also shows the correlation between the growth rates in Money and the growth rate in the economy.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RdmjjYVHjoI/AAAAAAAAADE/18_SJltawB0/s1600-h/God+Punishes,+part+5,+table+1.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RdmjjYVHjoI/AAAAAAAAADE/18_SJltawB0/s320/God+Punishes,+part+5,+table+1.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>As noted in earlier posts, the growth rate in the economy is noticeably faster among all of the Democratic administrations than it is among all of the Republican administrations.  There doesn’t seem to be much of a correlation between economic growth rates and increases in the real money supply…</p>
<p>But, as noted in earlier posts, there is a difference between Democratic Presidents and Republican Presidents when it comes to fiscal policy, so perhaps monetary policy will affect the two groups differently.  Looking at Democratic Presidents by themselves…</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RdmjfoVHjnI/AAAAAAAAAC8/qRi6EFW7IOs/s1600-h/God+Punishes,+part+5,+table+2.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RdmjfoVHjnI/AAAAAAAAAC8/qRi6EFW7IOs/s320/God+Punishes,+part+5,+table+2.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>While there are only three observations, table 2 does seem to indicate that perhaps monetary policy is highly correlated with the difference between in growth rates in the economy observed in the three administrations.  The loosest monetary policy occurred during the JFK-LBJ years, when the fastest growth was observed.  Under Clinton, monetary policy was more mixed (real M1 per capita contracted, but real M2 per capita increased), and growth rate was a bit slower.  The slowest growth rates among Democratic Presidents was observed in the Carter administration, when monetary was contractionary by both measures.</p>
<p>What about under Republicans?</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RdmjboVHjmI/AAAAAAAAAC0/bkyRXQBGc1I/s1600-h/God+Punishes,+part+5,+table+3.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RdmjboVHjmI/AAAAAAAAAC0/bkyRXQBGc1I/s320/God+Punishes,+part+5,+table+3.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>As seen in Table 3 above, the correlation between monetary policy (especially M2) and growth is still quite high.  What throws a damper on things, not surprisingly, is GW’s incompetence.  While he is the beneficiary of a more favorable monetary policy than Nixon &#038; Ford were, growth rates under GW have nevertheless been lower than under the combined Nixon &#038; Ford administration.  Leaving GW out of the picture:</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RdmjYIVHjlI/AAAAAAAAACs/ifQZbkglMFc/s1600-h/God+Punishes,+part+5,+table+4.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RdmjYIVHjlI/AAAAAAAAACs/ifQZbkglMFc/s320/God+Punishes,+part+5,+table+4.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>The correlation between monetary policy and growth among Republican Presidents, leaving out GW, is very close to 1.  Reagan was the beneficiary of the most benevolent monetary policy, and he performed best.  Nixon &#038; Ford also had it pretty good (better than all but one Democratic administration, in fact), and growth was next highest.  GHW incurred the wrath of the mighty Greenspan, so his growth rates were the lowest.</p>
<p>So…  it seems that except for GW who has a penchant for under performing at everything, all else being equal, the more beneficial the monetary policy, the better the growth rate under Republican Presidents, and the better the growth rate under Democratic Presidents.  The table below shows how the Presidents rank according to growth rates and monetary policy.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RdmjUYVHjkI/AAAAAAAAACk/TFLEG2JMt0Y/s1600-h/God+Punishes,+part+5,+table+5.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RdmjUYVHjkI/AAAAAAAAACk/TFLEG2JMt0Y/s320/God+Punishes,+part+5,+table+5.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>From this we conclude… not only did Democrats do better than Republicans, they did so with less favorable monetary policy.  </p>
<p>As to why the Republicans had the Fed’s wind at their backs and the Democrats were dragged back by a Fed anchor… leaving aside Miller who served as Chairman of the Fed for less than a year and a half, it is easy to see the blatant partisanship of the Fed at work.  Martin was a Democrat, and he provided very favorable monetary policy toward JFK and LBJ.  Burns, Volcker both served in the executive under Republican administrations; presumably, they were Republicans.  And its fairly obvious Greenspan, as a Randian, was no Democrat.  </p>
<p>Wouldn’t it be nice if Republican Presidents followed more rational policies, and the Fed sided with American public rather than the Chairman’s favorite political party for once?  Imagine how much wealthier we’d all be by now.</p>

<p>Data</p>
<p>Debt came <a href="http://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/pd/histdebt/histdebt_histo4.htm">from from 1950 to 2005</a> can be obtained from the Treasury; this data set provides data from 1953 to 1985 for December 31st of each year, and for 1985 to 2005 for September 30th of each year.  Data for September 2006 was also obtained <a href="http://www.treasurydirect.gov/NP/NPGateway">from the Treasury</a>.   </p>
<p>Real GDP per capita and population came from <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/SS_Data/Section7All_xls.xls">BEA’s NIPA Table 7.1</a>.  However, to match the debt series, this time I used Q4 data through 1985, and Q3 data thereafter.</p>

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>In my earlier <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/02/amt-relief-what-does-white-house.html">AMT post</a>, I was puzzled by what <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=MmM1NDg3YmI0NmE1YWI2ODVmOTYxZDRmZTk0MGM0MTk=">Lawrence Kudlow</a> meant by this:<br />
<blockquote>Washington economist Alan Reynolds has a great idea. Instead of raising the top personal tax rate, why not abolish the 10 percent bottom tax rate? It’s scored as a $40 billion dollar revenue loss, even though no one pays it. $40 billion dollars is 80 percent of the estimated $50 billion cost of a one year AMT patch fix-up.</p></blockquote>
<p>Since Kudlow choose not to let us know where Reynolds made this suggestion or provide us with a link, I had to resort to Google and found <a href="http://www.townhall.com/columnists/AlanReynolds/2005/10/27/this_is_tax_reform">this</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Both plans would eliminate the 10 percent bracket, putting the lowest rate back up to 15 percent. That&#8217;s an efficient idea, since creating that lowest rate had very little bang for the buck.  Yet the very large amounts of extra revenue from raising the lowest tax rates are not to be devoted to reducing higher tax rates.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>You see Larry – writing clarity is not that hard.</em>  It’s clear that the “plans” put forth by The President&#8217;s Advisory Panel on Federal Tax Reform, headed by Connie Mack and John Breaux (Reynolds isn’t trying to take credit for this idea – even if Kudlow credits Reynolds with the idea) would INCREASE tax rates.  But Kudlow could not write that, he had to say that 10 percent rate would be abolished.  </p>
<p>For upper middle class types, eliminating AMT may be a bigger deal than raising the bottom bracket from 10% to 15%.  But a married couple with two children whose income is around $38,500.  Personal exemptions and the standard deduction come to about $23,500 so currently they pay 10% on the remaining $15,000 or $1500 in Federal income taxes.  This proposal would increase their income taxes to $2250.  But Kudlow claims <strong>“no one pays it”</strong>.  </p>
<p>Table A.1 of “Income, Poverty, and Health Insurance Coverage in the United States: 2005” from the <a href="http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/income.html">Census Bureau</a> indicates that 38.5% of American families had income equal to less than $35,000.  While some are so poor that they are exempt from all Federal income taxes, but may do pay this 10% rate.  Kudlow knows this as reducing this tax rate to 10% was one of the Republican’s argument for the 2001 tax cut.  But their intent never was to reduce the tax burden from the poor so now they wish to take this away.  But Kudlow wants his readers to believe that no one will be suffer higher taxes.  It is not the first time he has flat out lied to the National Review readers.  And I doubt this will be his last lie.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: William Polley has added a few comments.  One set of comments shows that I may have missed a couple of exemptions for my hypothetical family.  The other directs us to table 1 from <a href="http://www.irs.gov/taxstats/indtaxstats/article/0,,id=129270,00.html">this source</a>, which is entitled “Tax Classified by Marginal Tax Rate”.  A wealth of data, which shows that for 2003 that the number of returns filed was around 101.4 million.  The number of returns filed with a top marginal rate equal to 10% or less was around 26.4 million, which shows that are a lot of households that Kudlow put into his “no one” classification.  How can anyone not be aware of over 25% of American households?</p>

<blockquote>&#8220;This war is a serious situation. It involves the worst foreign policy mistake in the history of this country,&#8221; Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nevada, told CNN&#8217;s &#8220;Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer.&#8221; &#8220;So we should take everything seriously. We find ourselves in a very deep hole and we need to find a way to dig out of it.&#8221; Asked whether he considers it a worse blunder than Vietnam, Reid responded, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; Comparisons to Vietnam are nothing new, but a &#8220;worse than&#8221; designation from a top lawmaker is. Sen. Chuck Hagel, a Nebraska Republican who has been one of the war&#8217;s most outspoken critics, told Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice in January that President Bush&#8217;s plan to send 21,500 more troops to Iraq &#8220;represents the most dangerous foreign policy blunder in this country since Vietnam.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The story continues with the usual babbling from Bush’s press secretary &#8211; Tony Snow.  At one point, Snow thought he had countered Senator Reid by noting that 77 Senators voted for that October 2002 resolution.  I guess Mr. Snow does not realize that the 1964 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Tonkin_Resolution">Gulf of Tonkin</a> resolution in the Senate with a vote of 88 to 2 and in the House with a vote of 416 to 0.  <br />I guess I’ve given up on the hope that the President’s press secretary would tell the reporters the truth.  But why do we have to endure not only his lies but also his incredible stupidity?</p>

<blockquote><p>An Alternative View of the Future&#8230;</p>
<p>We all act as if we can predict the future. We marry; sign 30-year mortgages, 10-year commercial leases, 5-year car loans and 2-year magazine subscriptions.</p>
<p>There are some mighty assumptions necessary to make commitments like some of those acts described above &#8212; assumptions developed with very little thought, research or historical context. It is worth noting that we must be careful about the terms: “always” and “in the long run”. That is because US (and other) economic history is the story of very long CYCLES.</p>
<p>Along those lines, there is a lot we know about public and private balance sheets, credit-monetary expansion, and bubbles hiding in plain sight plus other future liabilities and demographics. These are powerful tools for thinking about the future. I believe that enough is known about our economy to safely state that – to some extent or another – we are living beyond our means.</p>
<p>So, when something is unsustainable – what happens when it stops? My back-of-the-envelope calculations tell me that a future of continuing growth and affluence is close to impossible.</p>
<p>The premise of the entity under construction is that virtually no one out there is thinking about what our future might be like under circumstances of a shrinking, challenged and troubled economy. It may be human nature to think about the future in terms of two decades of recent experience – but that may not be the most accurate methodology.</p>
<p>When thinking about the future &#8212; economics is key. What would a “futurist” working in 1927 think? All cars will soon be 12 or 16 cylinders? Based on an analysis of advancements in engine design &#8212; that might not have been the craziest idea in the world &#8212; BUT &#8212; economics and not technology had the final say.</p>
<p>I am looking to bring unique and REALISTIC ideas to planning for the future. And planning for the future is something everyone needs to do.</p>
<p>I am an inventor and entrepreneur – not an economist or mathematician &#8212; as there is no direct guidance as to what our society might be like under some of the circumstances we are discussing &#8212; thinking about that is an INVENTIVE process.</p>
<p>Currently, I am seeking to put together a collaborative of economists, mathematicians, social scientists, people knowledgeable about energy and climate, etc. – and other interesting thinkers.</p>
<p>If this subject interests you – please contact me and introduce yourself.</p>

<p>Feel free to contact him directly.  But perhaps we can stimulate some discussion here as well.  Do you feel that &#8220;a future of continuing growth and affluence is close to impossible&#8221;?  I&#8217;ll be honest&#8230; I&#8217;m not sure I do.  I suspect continuing growth and affluence may look very different in the future&#8230;  certainly, a 14th century peasant would not recognize the ability to download music over the net to be part of growth and affluence.  But also, not everyone truly benefits from growth and affluence.  Perhaps (and here I haven&#8217;t checked any numbers) the percentage of children who die under age 5 from malnoutrition is at a low point, but the numbers are still staggering.  And I get the impression that even while Middle Class America has more today than ever before, it is more worried that in the future it will be unable to meet its bills than ever before.  Anyway, I haven&#8217;t given this anywhere near the thought Edward Charles Ponzi Jr. has, but I (and no doubt he) would love to hear your thoughts.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Behind the door of Army Spec. Jeremy Duncan&#8217;s room, part of the wall is torn and hangs in the air, weighted down with black mold. When the wounded combat engineer stands in his shower and looks up, he can see the bathtub on the floor above through a rotted hole. The entire building, constructed between the world wars, often smells like greasy carry-out. Signs of neglect are everywhere: mouse droppings, belly-up cockroaches, stained carpets, cheap mattresses.</p>
<p>This is the world of Building 18, not the kind of place where Duncan expected to recover when he was evacuated to Walter Reed Army Medical Center from Iraq last February with a broken neck and a shredded left ear, nearly dead from blood loss. But the old lodge, just outside the gates of the hospital and five miles up the road from the White House, has housed hundreds of maimed soldiers recuperating from injuries suffered in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Fortunately, this is nothing another round of tax cuts can&#8217;t fix. Two rounds of tax cuts and the surge will work too.</p>

                                <p>As I was mulling over my tax return for 2006, it hit that I might get nailed by AMT.  <a href="http://users2.wsj.com/lmda/do/checkLogin?mg=wsj-users2&#038;url=http%3A%2F%2Fonline.wsj.com%2Farticle%2FSB117159389782010715.html%3Fmod%3Dtodays_us_page_one">Sarah Lueck</a> notes that Congress may be thinking of giving folks like me some relief in 2007:<br />
<blockquote>The new Democratic-controlled Congress is looking to rein in looming tax increases on the middle class, possibly covering the cost by raising taxes on upper-income households. And the Bush administration may not stand in the way. The possible bargain centers on the Alternative Minimum Tax, a kind of parallel income tax that hit 3.5 million U.S. taxpayers in the 2006 tax year. Congressional Democrats are eager to keep the AMT from ensnaring millions more middle-class taxpayers. They also must find a way to cover the estimated $50 billion cost of scaling back the tax this year.</p></blockquote>
<p>This send shocks waves threw the veins of <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=MmM1NDg3YmI0NmE1YWI2ODVmOTYxZDRmZTk0MGM0MTk=">Lawrence Kudlow</a> who reports on an email from an unnamed “senior White House official”:<br />
<blockquote>“Larry—just wanted to touch base with you on this story in the WSJ. I don’t know who those “officials” are, but let me be very clear: they are not representing the President’s views. The story is dead wrong. The President proposed a balanced budget while making tax relief permanent and is firmly committed to keeping marginal tax rates low. The President supports the proposal in his budget. President Bush has proven that he’s a tax cutter, not a tax raiser.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The phrase “the President proposed a balanced budget while making tax relief permanent AND is firmly committed to keeping marginal tax rates low” is a lie unless AND is replaced by OR.  But why couldn’t Kudlow tell us the name of his source?  Is tax policy classified material?  Kudlow continues with this oddly worded passage:<br />
<blockquote>why not abolish the 10 percent bottom tax rate? It’s scored as a $40 billion dollar revenue loss, even though no one pays it. $40 billion dollars is 80 percent of the estimated $50 billion cost of a one year AMT patch fix-up. If I may be so bold, with ka-gillions of revenues pouring into Treasury coffers, it looks to me like the Bush marginal rate tax cuts are paying for themselves.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let me try to follow Kudlow’s Krazy logic.  AMT relief will mean a loss of revenues, which he claims is $50 billion.  So Kudlow wants to pay for that by reducing revenues by another $40 billion.  Uh Larry: 50 plus 40 does not equal 10.  But no one pays taxes at the bottom rate?  They are no poor people in the United States?  Or is Kudlow trying to say the revenue-maximizing rate equal to zero?</p>
<p>Given how scatter-brained Kudlow’s thinking is, I may regret the following suggestion.  But couldn’t someone teach this bubbling fool how to write clearly?</p>

                                <p>If President Lincoln said the following:<br />
<blockquote>Congressmen who willfully take action during wartime that damage morale and undermine the military are saboteurs, and should be arrested, exiled or hanged</p></blockquote>
<p>We should demand his portrait be removed for the $5 bill.  But that’s why the face of <a href="http://www.factcheck.org/article415.html">J. Michael Waller</a> is not in my wallet.  Poor Congressman <a href="http://www.crooksandliars.com/2007/02/16/rep-young-r-ak-uses-fabricated-lincoln-quote-on-house-floor">Don Young</a> &#8211; C-Span runs how he was suckered by rightwingers such as Frank Gaffney.  </p>
<p>But <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican-American_War#Declaration_of_war">this</a> is interesting:<br />
<blockquote>Whigs in both the North and South generally opposed the war, while Democrats mostly supported it. Whig Abraham Lincoln contested the causes for the war and demanded to know the exact spot on which Thornton had been attacked and U.S. blood had been shed. He was quoted as saying &#8220;Show me the spot.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Hat tip to <a href="http://www.samefacts.com/archives/lying_in_politics_/2007/02/don_young_lets_hang_abraham_lincoln.php">Mark Kleiman</a> for the post “Don Young: Let’s Hang Abraham Lincoln”.</p>
<p>We should also remember that Republicans – including John McCain – felt free to oppose the decisions of the Commander-in-Chief when the President’s name was Bill Clinton.</p>

                                <p>The ex-Girlfriend and I were talking about a friend of hers that has a Video Store in downtown LA.  We both thought perhaps its time to, if not leave the business, find a way to diversify, what with this being the era of Netflix.  Clearly, he had in mind focusing on foreign &#038; indie films as his niche, but Netflix (like other online retailers) can play in the long tail as well.</p>
<p>Which leads to a few questions&#8230;</p>
<p>1.  What should someone who owns a video store diverisfy into?  Music seems like an obvious route, but in an era of i-Tunes that seems less rational than video.<br />2.  What should Netflix diversify into when broadband becomes fast or efficient enough to download movies almost as conveniently as i-Tunes will deliver music today?</p>

                                <p>A friend of the ex-Girlfriend’s is the North American distributor for what I am told is a well-known fashionable line of shoes.  I understand that for several years, she has been their top salesperson world-wide.  The company has always made their shoes in Spain, but this year, they decided to make shoes in China.</p>
<p>The ex-Girlfriend’s friend has a few problems with this.  First, it seems that the Chinese manufacturers have missed a number of deadlines.  The product has not shipped, sales calls have had to be cancelled or postponed, and retailers are getting irate.  The second is that “Made in Spain” or “Made in Italy” seems to have a certain cachet that “Made in China” does not among people willing to spend $200 + on shoes.  </p>
<p>Will all that change?  And how long will it take?</p>
<p>PS.  The series on Republican and Democrat Presidents will continue on Monday.  I’ve been looking at data and found something I think is very interesting.  Basically, I think I can explain why any given Democrat performed better or worse than other Democrats, and why any given Republican performed better or worse than other Republicans.  I want to mull on what I’ve found for a bit before I write it up.</p>
