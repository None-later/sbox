                                <p>Lifted from comments from this post <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/11/us-to-be-leading-producer-of-oil-what.html" target="_blank">US to be leading producer of oil</a> is Spencer England&#8217;s comment about structural change in the oil markets.  Obvious to some but bears repeating for a lot of us, as we discuss environmental issues or gasoline prices in the media more than structural economic impacts:</p>
<p>Spencer says:</p>
<p>The development of fracking and the tar sands means that the oil industry is undergoing a major structural change.</p>
<p>Use to be that one of the thing that made the oil industry very unique was that virtually all their costs were sunk or fixed costs and variable costs were relatively insignificant. Under this cost structure if prices fall it still pays to produce oil when prices fell as long as revenues covered the variable costs. So falling prices did not lead to falling output.</p>
<p>But now the marginal supply of oil is from tar sands or fracking where variable costs are very high. Moreover, the marginal costs of bringing in new oil from these sources is now in the $80 to $100 range.</p>
<p>So now, when prices fall, at the margin some producers will withdraw from the market and output will fall.</p>
<p>This is creating a fairly solid floor, the price for oil at about $80 &#8212; where oil bottomed last year and again this year.</p>
<p>Very few people are incorporating this structural change in the oil market into their analysis.</p>

                                <p>I have written several posts pointing to the role economics blogs play in the media, and am sorting out strengths and weakness to be addressed at Angry Bear in our own content.</p>
<p><a href="http://worthwhile.typepad.com/worthwhile_canadian_initi/2012/11/four-mc-curves-and-two-ppfs.html" target="_blank">Nick Rowe</a>  at Worthwhile Canadian Initiative posts <i>Four MC curves and two PPFs.  </i>The comments flesh out the ideas involved in a beginning econ class, and provide a bit of the human side of teaching economic concepts of marginal cost, average cost, real world and the smoothing from economics modeling aggregates.  Of course I read him and Frances regularly.</p>
<p> On the other hand, as Steven Colbert (representing common sentiment) responded to Warren Buffet&#8217;s explanation of his position on taxes and tax code the other night, &#8220;Why do I find this interesting and yet am so bored?&#8221;  I get this sort of reaction sometimes in my own circles, as people run to the exits .  It forces me to consider my own social skills as well as what to offer readers.  🙂</p>
<p> Our own Steve Roth is sorting out <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/11/modeling-wealth-income-and-saving.html" target="_blank">his own understanding of models</a> with Nick Rowe in a manner I find refreshing to the extent that  bloggers can add to our understanding in a back and forth manner without shouting out the truth of things.  Thanks guys.</p>

                                <p> I sometimes get the &#8216;eyes rolling&#8217; reaction from people in my social sphere when I insist that at least linking to  original documents is important, and that someone needs to follow up on what an author says someone else says (as a way to gain traction and authority status for their own writing, such as saying the non-partisan Tax Policy Centers says).  I won&#8217;t go into the idea of spin, which involves figuring out intent.  Mine is a caution for readers:</p>
<p>The post is lifted from a note from Daniel Becker in response to a query I sent to him&#8230;Dan is a small businessman in the way most of us think of as small business.  (The IRS has a different criterion  of ownership that allows a company like <i>Bechtal </i>at $31 billion to be considered a small business).</p>
<p>Dan Becker&#8217;s note:</p>
<p>The Washington Post article is   <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/obama-calls-for-small-business-tax-breaks/2012/11/27/83575192-389d-11e2-b01f-5f55b193f58f_story.html"><i>Obama calls for small business tax break</i>s</a>.   The article uses the  <a href="http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxtopics/2013-Temporary-Tax-Relief-to-Create-Jobs-and.cfm">Tax Policy Center</a> original under the title <i>Temporary Tax Relief to Create Jobs </i> as the source for the reporting.</p>
<p>The WP article notes:</p>
<p>&#8220;The last time the country had a similar proposal to the tax subsidy was during the Carter administration, according to the Tax Policy Center. Research by the Labor Department found that few firms knew about the tax policy, but those that did increased employment notably.&#8221;    </p>
<p>But from their source it actually notes:    <br />
<blockquote>&#8220;The last experience the United States had with a credit for incremental employment was with the new jobs credit enacted at the beginning of the Carter Administration in 1977. Evaluations of that credit <a href="http://taxvox.taxpolicycenter.org/sunley.pdf">and how it came about</a> found that most firms were either unaware of the credit or did not respond to it. <a href="http://ideas.repec.org/a/aea/aecrev/v69y1979i2p173-79.html">Research based on a Department of Labor survey</a> found that only 6 percent of firms who knew about the credit said that it prompted them to hire more workers. Firms that were aware of the credit, however, increased employment about 3 percent more than other firms. &#8221;   (bolding is Dan B.&#8217;s)</p></blockquote>
<p>WP had another smoothing over (under the fold):<br />      <br /><a name="more"></a><br />&#8220;An incremental jobs credit could be a cost-effective way of raising employment in the short run, the <a href="http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxtopics/2013-Temporary-Tax-Relief-to-Create-Jobs-and.cfm">nonpartisan center said in a report</a> this year. The effectiveness of any jobs subsidy depends . . . on how employers perceive its potential benefits when making hiring decisions.&#8221;</p>
<p>The actual statement:     <br />
<blockquote>In summary, the effect of this proposal on employment is very uncertain. In theory, an incremental jobs credit could be a cost-effective way of raising employment in the short run and some research suggests that the 1977 credit did increase jobs, although the evidence on that is far from conclusive.<br />The effectiveness of any jobs subsidy depends greatly on both the details of the proposal, still to be finalized, and on how employers perceive its potential benefits when making hiring decisions.</p></blockquote>

<p>(Editorial comment at end of note from Dan Becker&#8230;.Man! They still want to believe that cutting taxes is actually the same as if the 99% were now getting that $1 trillion of income that is now with the 1%. Just like they believe cutting taxes will increase revenues (sure if you convince the dictator to stop taking a full 90% of all that his people produce, but that&#8217;s not US).</p>

                                <p>Lifted from a note from Beverly Mann in response to a query of mine, as a note of interest:</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a link to a long Politico article on those cases and on the prospects of their success:</p>
<p><a href="http://dyn.politico.com/printstory.cfm?uuid=67901EA4-2955-4FD7-A52E-1E8CB0EA8E56">http://dyn.politico.com/printstory.cfm?uuid=67901EA4-2955-4FD7-A52E-1E8CB0EA8E56</a></p>
<p>Apparently it looks like the Supreme Court eventually will hear two or three of these cases, probably all at one time, and draw some line about which organizations and for-profit companies are entitled to be exempt from the contraception part of the mandate. But mainly, these lawsuits concern a federal statute called <em>The Religious Freedom Restoration Act</em>, which provides religious protections for these groups beyond what the Supreme Court has held that the First Amendment requires. That statute was passed in reaction to a Supreme Court opinion that defined the First Amendment&#8217;s Free Exercise clause more narrowly than a majority of Congress thought was appropriate.</p>
<p>The Politico article gives a pretty detailed rundown on this.</p>

<blockquote><p>A small number of blogs have a higher rank than before.  Sometimes, such as in the case of The Becker-Posner Blog, the number and quality of citations account for an increased rank. However, most of the blogs that are ranked higher than before have received citations from more influential blogs. This is the case with Angry Bear, a blog that has the same level of Popularity but has more than doubled its Influence in the last months.</p>
<p>In our analysis, the data covers the period May 2011- November 2012.</p></blockquote>

That such would happen shouldn&#8217;t be much of surprise to anyone who&#8217;s followed world oil production for any length of time; the Saudis, Russia and the US have been the world&#8217;s leading producers for at least 40 years.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p> Just compare <a href="http://www.indexmundi.com/energy.aspx?country=us&#038;product=oil&#038;graph=production">historical production for the US</a>, <a href="http://www.indexmundi.com/energy.aspx?country=ru&#038;product=oil&#038;graph=production">for Russia</a>, and <a href="http://www.indexmundi.com/energy.aspx?country=sa&#038;product=oil&#038;graph=production">for Saudi Arabia</a>).  <a href="http://www.financialsensearchive.com/editorials/hodges/2004/0404.html">Our problem has always been that we&#8217;ve consumed more than twice our production</a>, while the Saudis, with their smaller population and domestic usage, have been the world&#8217;s leading exporter and the one country seen as having reserves ample enough to backstop the markets. Apparently the IEA feels that even with enhanced recovery methods, <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&#038;rct=j&#038;q=&#038;esrc=s&#038;frm=1&#038;source=web&#038;cd=3&#038;cad=rja&#038;sqi=2&#038;ved=0CD8QFjAC&#038;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.econbrowser.com%2Farchives%2F2007%2F05%2Fnorthern_ghawar.html&#038;ei=A5-nUIDNHqqBygGqqYHwCA&#038;usg=AFQjCNGoQJx4HTJ10vxb7HvW_H7z2zg2ow">the </a>S<a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&#038;rct=j&#038;q=&#038;esrc=s&#038;frm=1&#038;source=web&#038;cd=3&#038;cad=rja&#038;sqi=2&#038;ved=0CD8QFjAC&#038;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.econbrowser.com%2Farchives%2F2007%2F05%2Fnorthern_ghawar.html&#038;ei=A5-nUIDNHqqBygGqqYHwCA&#038;usg=AFQjCNGoQJx4HTJ10vxb7HvW_H7z2zg2ow">audi&#8217;s cant squeeze much more out of their declining Ghawar oil field</a>, which <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&#038;rct=j&#038;q=&#038;esrc=s&#038;frm=1&#038;source=web&#038;cd=1&#038;cad=rja&#038;ved=0CDwQFjAA&#038;url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FOil_reserves_in_Saudi_Arabia&#038;ei=p2CpUKTJCOK-yQHl5ICwCQ&#038;usg=AFQjCNExCLe0t3QUUAWOz_e1f4McSNHnaQ">supplies 60% of their production</a>, and for the next few decades <a href="http://www.econbrowser.com/archives/2012/11/2012_world_ener.html">US production will increase due to our unconventional recovery techniques, notably fracking</a>.</p>
<p>But we should note is that even if this temporary switch in world production leaders were to come to pass (and there are<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/14/business/energy-environment/energy-independence-in-america-would-not-be-fully-independent.html"> plenty </a>of<a href="http://www.chron.com/business/article/Analysis-Despite-boost-in-oil-U-S-not-out-of-4033840.php"> skeptics</a>), this <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/view/507376/iea-says-us-oil-production-will-exceed-saudi-arabias/">near energy independence will not lower our costs of gasoline</a> for several reasons. The most obvious reason self sufficiency in energy wont lower prices is that <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2012/11/12/dont-expect-lower-oil-prices-even-as-u-s-output-surges/?mod=WSJBlog">crude oil is fungible and prices are determined by worldwide demand &#038; supply</a>. Moreover, the IEA figures include natural gas liquids in our expected production, <a href="http://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/A-Brief-Review-of-the-IEAs-2012-World-Energy-Outlook.html">which by 2011 had come to account for 28% our total unconventional production</a>, &#038; <a href="http://www.econbrowser.com/archives/2012/07/natural_gas_liq.html">you cant produce gasoline from natural gas liquids</a>. The other reason that domestic oil will of necessity stay high priced is the amount of continued investment that is needed to produce oil from shale.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nowandfutures.com/download/d4/TypicalBakkenWellProduction(north_dakota_govt).png">The adjacent graph</a>, which comes from <a href="https://www.dmr.nd.gov/oilgas/presentations/WBPC2011Activity.pdf">a report from the N.Dakota Dept of Resources</a> (pdf), shows the production over time from a typical well in the <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/rpt-column-bakken-set-rival-ghawar-john-kemp-130127071--sector.html">Bakken shale, which is now the most productive field in the US</a>. What you see here is that unlike conventional oil wells, where you might drill one well that produces decently for 40 years, the typical bakken well production falls by over 80% in just two years, because after the initial oil flow from the pulverized rock, the flow slows to a trickle.</p>
<p>So <a href="http://www.theoildrum.com/node/9506">to continue to produce oil from the bakken, or any other shale formation, you have to drill more &#038; more wells, smash more bedrock</a>, <a href="http://www.hcn.org/issues/44.13/the-bakken-oil-play-spurs-a-booming-business-in-water">truck in millions of gallons more of water</a> &#038; chemicals, all of which is an ongoing capital drain. And even though we are expanding our capacity to tap shale oil considerably, the <a href="http://earlywarn.blogspot.com/2012/10/us-oil-rig-boom-leveling-off.html">seven fold increase in oil drilling rigs in the US since 2009 has only produced about a 20% increase in oil production</a>&#8230;</p>

                                <p><strong>Update: </strong>More expansive discussion of this model with more graphics, <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/wealth-and-redistribution-revisited-does-enriching-the-rich-actually-make-us-all-richer.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>It has <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/why-prosperity-requires-a-welfare-state.html">long</a> seemed to me that redistribution is, for some reason, necessary for the emergence, continuance, and growth of large, prosperous, modern, high-productivity monetary economies. No such economy has ever emerged absent large quantities of ongoing redistribution. There are no exceptions; every such economy on earth engages in it on a large scale. <em>The Economist </em>recently devoted a whole <a href="http://www.economist.com/printedition/covers/2012-09-06/ap-e-eu-la-me-na-uk">special section</a> to the need for Asian countries — notably China — to develop such systems of social redistribution in order to make the move from “developing” to “advanced.”</p>
<p>That’s the big-picture empirics. What I’ve been missing, have been unable to find, and have been struggling to conceive, is a straightforward, intuitively convincing economic model (mathematical or at least arithmetic) to explain this fact theoretically.</p>
<p>Paul Krugman says that <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/24/a-meta-modeling-meditation/">thinking in terms of models will make you a better person</a>. I want to be a better person.</p>
<p>I think I may have finally created such a model. (I’m feeling better already.) It’s a <em>very</em> simple dynamic simulation model (set it up, plug in parameters, and watch it run over the years), and it’s purely monetary. It makes no attempt to model the real economy of production and trade in real goods. It makes no distinction between consumption and investment spending; there’s just spending. It doesn’t require a theory of value, or of capital, or of profits. It simply assumes that production and trade happen, and that they yield a surplus. You can imagine that surplus as consisting of new real assets, or being embodied in new financial assets that are representative of those real assets. It doesn’t really matter.</p>
<p>The model is based on one and only one behavioral assumption: declining marginal propensity to spend out of wealth. (Something I fiddled with previously, <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/gdp-prosperity-the-wealth-effect-and-marginal-propensity-to-consume.html">here</a>.) That in turn is based on the declining marginal utility of consumption (the millionth dollar spent yields less utility than the first). The assumption, which seems safe both empirically and theoretically:</p>
<p>Rich people spend a smaller portion of their wealth each year than poorer people.</p>
<p>In this model each person’s spending is replaced each year by income (with a surplus), but the spending is determined by the person’s wealth. It assumes that people expect the income to replace the spent wealth, but they’re not certain that it will, always. So they (especially those with low income/wealth) are facing a tradeoff between present spending and long-term economic security. Different wealth/income levels have different propensities to substitute one for the other.</p>
<p>This is basically looking at spending and income from the opposite direction of most such models. Here, spending drives aggregate income (all spending is income, when received), rather than spending being determined by income (which is how we tend to think about individuals).</p>
<p>The rest is just arithmetic.</p>
<p>Here’s the basic setup, with a population of 11 people. The spreadsheet is <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/income-spending-base.xls">here</a> (Google Doc version <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ani8neh17rLSdENMcUdQX1FKRHRCVnFyMURROWhreGc">here</a>); you can change of the numbers and see the results.</p>
<p>I’m assuming 0% inflation for simplicity.</p>
<p>One person has $1 million.</p>
<p>Ten people have $100K each: $1 million total.</p>
<p>The rich person spends 30% of their wealth annually ($300K to start).</p>
<p>The ten poorer people spend 80% of their wealth annually ($80K each, $800K total, to start).</p>
<p>Through work/production and gains from trade, each person gets 5% more income annually than they spend. I’ve black-boxed that whole surplus-creation process; it just happens. I’ve set it up so that income (including the surplus) is distributed to the population proportionally based on how much they spend. It’s a somewhat arbitrary choice (I had to make some choice), but since people’s incomes and expenditures do tend to correlate fairly closely, it doesn’t seem like a nutty one.</p>
<p>The additional money for this annual +5% would come from new bank lending and/or government deficit spending and/or Fed money printing and/or trade surpluses with other countries. Choose your monetary model/paradigm; in any case the surplus is monetized via trade and the financial system.</p>
<p>So no, Income ≠ Expenditure (or vice versa), unless you include purchases of new financial assets in “Expenditures.” Absent those purchases/receipts, Income is 5% greater than Expenditures. That’s what surplus from production/trade is all about, how it plays out in an economy that includes monetary savings.</p>
<p>Now add this: Some percentage of the rich person’s wealth is transferred to the poorer people every year (by the ebil gubmint man).</p>
<p>Does that wealth transfer make everyone wealthier, or poorer? Here’s the result with the numbers I set out above:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/total-wealth-income1.png"><img title="total wealth income" src="http://www.asymptosis.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/total-wealth-income1-480x328.png" alt="" width="480" height="328"></a></p>
<p>In this model, taking money from the rich and giving it to the poor make us more prosperous in aggregate, raises all boats, makes the pie bigger…you’ve heard all the metaphors.</p>
<p>Explanation below the fold.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a>
<p><img title="More..." src="http://www.asymptosis.com/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/wordpress/img/trans.gif" alt="">The arithmetic, and the theory, is simple:</p>
<p>1. Redistribution results in more spending (because of declining marginal propensity to spend from wealth)</p>
<p>2. More spending spurs more production</p>
<p>3. More production (and trade) produces more surplus</p>
<p>4. Surplus (monetized) is the source of monetary savings</p>
<p>5. Bonus: More savings (wealth) results in more spending. (Note the exponential curves.)</p>
<p>6. Repeat loop.</p>
<p>The result seems to be an apparently counterintuitive, but on consideration very obvious, conclusion:</p>
<p>Saving doesn’t cause saving. <em>Spending</em> causes saving.</p>
<p>The preceding is halfway tongue in cheek. It points out how problematic the word “saving” is in a monetary context. Saving some of this year’s corn crop is straightforward enough — eat less of it. Money makes it into a far more complicated concept, cause you can’t eat money.</p>
<p>I would say instead:</p>
<p>Spending causes <em>accumulation</em>, because it spurs production and trade, resulting in a surplus. That surplus is what allows for accumulation.</p>
<p>So we want more spending, and <em>less</em> so-called “saving.” Some people call it money hoarding, but that’s confusing too. The best synonym for monetary saving is “not spending.”</p>
<p>I’m with <a href="http://worthwhile.typepad.com/worthwhile_canadian_initi/2012/01/why-saving-should-be-banned.html">Nick</a>: we should stop using the word saving.</p>
<p>More monetary saving by individuals (the word works fine for individuals) — spending a smaller proportion of their wealth on real goods each year — results in less accumulation in aggregate.</p>
<p>Faithful readers will recognize that this purely monetary model sidesteps and obviates the need for the conceptual quagmire associated with S = I = Y – C — a construct which, in its effort to go in the opposite direction from mine and model a barter, real economy devoid of monetary savings, arguably makes it impossible or at least very difficult to think cogently about how monetary economies (i.e. all economies) work.</p>
<p>But how about sharesies? Is it fair? Here’s how it plays out:</p>

<p>At 1.5% redistribution in this model, the rich person’s income, spending, and wealth all stay the same over time (remember: no inflation here), while the poorer people’s income and wealth almost triple, and overall wealth and income more than doubles. Seem fair to you? Pareto devotees please comment.</p>
<p>I know exactly where everyone’s going with this: incentives and behavioral responses. And I have to admit that I did make one other behavioral assumption here: that there are no other behavioral responses.</p>
<p>Giving a bit less money to the rich person will give slightly less incentive to work. But at the same time it’s giving <em>ten poorer people far more incentive</em> to work. You do the math. (This all before we get into issues of substitution vs. income effects at different wealth and income levels, something I won’t even begin to address here.)</p>
<p>Whatever combination of behavioral effects one might posit, I would suggest that the burden of proof lies with the positor to demonstrate, empirically, that those effects are sufficient to overwhelm (or supplement?) the inexorable arithmetic of compounding that’s at play here.</p>
<p>Finally, note that this model doesn’t even touch on aggregate utility delivered under each regime. Since the spending of the poorer people is split among ten — each spending $80K/year to start — a larger proportion of that spending is on necessities like food, clothing, shelter, health care, and education. I think all economists will stipulate to the proposition that those purchases yield higher utility per dollar than a family’s purchase of a third car or a fourth TV. So the graph above greatly understates the higher aggregate utility provided by redistribution, and the table either understates the utility gains by the poorer people, or overstates the gains by the rich one. (It would be easy to add a somewhat arbitrary formula to represent that effect graphically, but I’ll leave it to your imagination.)</p>
<p>And: this utility effect would serve to multiply the incentive for poorer people discussed in the previous paragraph, giving the ten people even <em>more</em> incentive to work.</p>
<p>I’m rather taken with this spending + surplus = income dynamic approach to modeling. (But I would be, wouldn’t I?) I’d be delighted to see how others might analyze and display results using various parameters, and how they might adjust, improve, or dismantle the model. In particular: are there obvious, gaping flaws here?</p>

<p>The Media&#8217;s Role in Driving the &#8220;Fiscal Cliff&#8221; Imagery</p>
<p>The mainstream media has been fed a steady diet of releases from interested parties (like right-leaning propaganda tanks) about the need to adopt austerity measures, often cast as needing to save the country from out-of-control spending and unprecedented deficits and debt. </p>
<p>At the same time, the mainstream media has generally given up investigative journalism to engage in sports-like &#8220;he said-she said&#8221; journalism:  it treats most fiscal issues as a contest between left-leaning and right-leaning groups to be described by each side&#8217;s post position&#8211;i.e., as a merit-based race between equally valid positions.  Without the investigative wherewithal for in-depth research, there&#8217;s much less information about whether and how the facts may support one side and not the other. </p>
<p>We see it on climate change, where a scientific consensus is treated as just another opinion contrasted with the wishful opinions of anti-environmental corporatists.  We see it on evolution, where belief-based creationism is taught in schools alongside fact-supported scientific theory, with the two sides reported in the news as though they represent equally valid educational positions.   </p>
<p>It shouldn&#8217;t be surprising, therefore, that this approach surfaces in spades when it comes to the so-called &#8220;fiscal cliff&#8221;. </p>
<p>One is hard pressed to find articles that give credence to the position of progressives on Social Security (it is not bankrupt), Medicare (we can solve the long-term problem of financing of reasonable universal health care without cutting benefits by learning from the facts and experiences about controlling medical care costs through single-payer systems like those adopted in every other advanced nation), or even taxes.  The possibility of using the end-of-year changes as a fresh-start, &#8220;sweep the house clean&#8221; foundation for immediate action early in the new term is often ignored and, if mentioned, is generally given short shrift and inadequate explanation. </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s easy, though, to find forecasts of return to recession outcomes if the sequester and end of the Bush tax cuts are allowed to take place as currently enacted.<br />   <br />Take, for example, the rhetoric of Mark Johnson in a KTVB.com report, <a href="http://www.ktvb.com/news/The-Fiscal-Cliff-and-its-potential-effect-on-Idahoans-179899411.html">A Fiscal Cliff primer</a> (Nov. 18, 2012, updated Nov. 19).<br />If Congress cannot come up with an agreement on the Simpson-Bowles ratification, and then cannot come up [with] enough compromises to pass a plan of their own, and the President refuses to extend the current January 1st deadline, it&#8217;s over the cliff for Uncle Sam.<br />And, straight into the tax increases, unemployment jump, deep federal cuts and probable recession; A rough landing for the country and a scenario neither side wants.</p>
<p>The article adds to the crisis drumroll by quoting political scientist David Adler.<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;And all the progress that Idaho families made in getting out of the recession will have gone by the wayside if in fact America&#8217;s politicians in Washington are not able to put our fiscal house in order.&#8221; Id.</p></blockquote>
<p>In a similar vein, <strong>Jonathan Weisman in the New York Times</strong> reports today that &#8220;negotiators&#8221; have agreed on the parameters for a deal in which they will agree on fixed amounts of revenue to be raised (without tax rates increasing) and fixed amounts of cuts to social programs (and other federal programs like farm subsidies).  Jonathan Weisman, Seeking Ways to Raise Taxes but Leave Tax Rate as is: Negotiators Float Ideas to Appease Both Parties, New York Times (Nov. 23, 2012), at A12. </p>
<blockquote><p>The article contains a good bit of information (or speculation, it isn&#8217;t completely clear) about what &#8220;negotiators&#8221; are considering in order to &#8220;pacify&#8221; the Republicans without permitting tax rate increases.  There&#8217;s no specific source attribution other than to &#8220;&#8221;aides involved in the negotiations&#8221; and a &#8220;Republican aide involved in the current talks.&#8221;  Id.  Predictably, it also includes a description of the slated legislative changes as a &#8220;crisis&#8221; when the &#8220;&#8216;fiscal cliff&#8217; would squeeze hundreds of billions of dollars out of the fragile economy next year and, many economists say, send the country back into recession&#8221;.  Id. </p></blockquote>
<p>There&#8217;s not a single hint that it may not really be a &#8220;cliff&#8221;.  That it merely cuts back INCREASES in military spending.  That the sequester, with its cuts to the military, leaves the government with more options for funding NEEDED stimulus spending.  That Congress has all the power it needs to undo any truly harmful components of the sequester.  That Congress can instead consider targeted cuts to lower-income taxpayers to prevent a renewal downward recession trend.  That Congress can instead target spending cuts (and spending) on stimulation of the economy.  That Congress, in other words, has it in its power to help lower-income taxpayers pay for needed consumption and thus to create tax cuts and controlled spending cuts to benefit the lower and lower-middle income classes whose consumption is most needed to drive economic growth.</p>
<p>A little better is Evan Soltas, <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-19/a-gentler-slope-for-the-fiscal-cliff.html">A Gentler Slope for the &#8216;Fiscal Cliff&#8217;</a>, Bloomberg.com (Nov. 19, 2012), in which he admits the siren-call of the term to journalists.</p>
<p>The vivid imagery and false urgency of the [fiscal cliff] term transformed budget arcana into a national Wile E. Coyote moment. The words lent themselves to media overexposure and political opportunism. Despite efforts by <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/45755883/ns/msnbc-the_last_word/#49753971">Chris Hayes</a>, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2012/11/13/the-fiscal-cliff-the-austerity-crisis/">Ezra Klein</a> and<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2012/11/09/the-fiscal-cliff-is-an-austerity-crisis/"> Suzy Khimm</a> to rebrand it the “fiscal curb” or “austerity crisis” &#8212; either of which would be more consistent with reality &#8212; Bernanke&#8217;s original phrasing has held fast.  Id.<br />Soltas at least explores the benefit of avoiding drastic austerity measures and even considering an &#8220;alternate&#8221; path of increasing the tax take beyond the &#8220;historic&#8221; measures of 18-19% of GDP.  Remember, we are currently at all-time lows in the perecentage of GDP taken in federal taxes, due especially to the enormously preferential rates to the super-elite through taxation of capital gains, dividends and private equity compensation (that is, &#8220;carried interest&#8221;) at less than half the top rate on ordinary compensation.</p>
<p>A reasonable solution might be a combination of spending cuts and revenue increases which stabilizes both at 18 or 19 percent of gross domestic product. That would be in line with their 50-year historical average. Increases or decreases beyond this level demand larger arguments about the proper size and role of government.</p>
<p>Alternatively, one could contend that demographic shifts &#8212; namely, the growing elderly fraction of the population &#8212; or rising health care costs justify greater public resources without any moral claims about government’s proper size. There is merit to this argument, but it neglects the revenue side of the historical consensus on the taxes paid to the federal government.<br />The relevance of any &#8220;historical consensus&#8221; on the percent of GDP that should be paid to the federal government, however, is questionable.  The times are extraordinarily different, with the years of low tax intake from the Reagan tax cuts through the Bush tax cuts, coupled with the unprecedented problem of the Bush preemptive wars being fought without the historical use of wartime increases in tax cuts (especially on the rich) to pay for them.<br />Maybe one of the better articles is a pre-election discussion at Fidelity.com on the &#8220;<a href="https://www.fidelity.com/viewpoints/market-and-economic-insights/fiscal-cliffhanger">Fiscal Cliffhanger</a>&#8220;, Sept. 26, 2012.  Here at least there is a good graphic demonstrating just how significant the Bush-era tax cuts are in our deficit problem ($221 billion) and how little the cut to support for Medicare payments to providers is ($11 billion).  Perhaps this kind of graphic can get the upper-middle class Americans to consider their fair-share obligation. (That means couples, like most professionals such as myself, who make more than $100,000 a year but less than the $250,000 or more a year that Obama has taken as his targeted income level for reintroducting pre-Bush era taxes.)  Further, the article acknowledges that gridlock in the lame duck is quite possible, but goes on to note that there will likely be a resolution&#8211;with compromise on both sides&#8211;early in 2013.<br />Many progressives&#8211;in which group I include myself&#8211; do think that a clean sweep start to the new session could allow Congress to act more reasonably on our long-term fiscal needs without compromising measures needed to continue moving us out of the Bush recession.  <br />Once the Bush tax cuts are gone and the sequester starting to take effect, Congress could  enact piecemeal legislation.  It could pass new, better targeted tax cuts for the lower-middle and lower income distribution.  Hopefully Obama, now in office and not needing to protect his electoral future, will recognize the reasonableness of allowing some tax increases to take place in four-or five- years for those couples in the $100,000 to $250,000 taxable income set.  <br />Once the sequester is starting to roll in, Congress could move to reinstate public pension support.  It could consider long-term support for Medicare through gradual adoption of a single-payer, Medicare-for-all system that meets the real needs of the future rather than using an artificially created fiscal crisis to destroy the New Deal programs.  It could accept the sequester&#8217;s limited spending increases for the military.  It could even finally act to reduce the tax-and-spending subsidies for Big Banks (get rid of the active financing exception to Subpart F), Big Pharmacy and Big IT (legislate new international tax rules that undo the tax evasion that current  &#8220;affiliated sales&#8221; of intellectual property permits while reining in the ability of MNEs to locate their profits in offshore tax havens with sophisticated tax planning like the &#8220;Dutch sandwich&#8221; techniques), and Big Oil and Big Agribusiness (outright subsidies built into well-lobbied tax and spending provisions).   <br /><a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2012/11/media-role-in-driving-the-fiscal-cliff.html" title="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2012/11/media-role-in-driving-the-fiscal-cliff.html">http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2012/11/media-role-in-driving-the-fiscal-cliff.html</a></p>

                                <p>Nate Silver is all the rage, but when Dean Baker tweeted &#8220;Excellent <a data-query-source="hashtag_click" dir="ltr" href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23WAPO&#038;src=hash"><s>#</s>WAPO</a> article&#8221; </p>
<p>I had to read it.  To me the hero of the article is a meta analyst who used data collected by others to discover that Avandia causes increased risk of heart attacks.  Meta analysis, and the name is Nissen.</p>
<p>
<blockquote>To see whether his suspicions were warranted, [Steven E.] Nissen, with colleague Kathy Wolski, set out to assemble the data from every trial of Avandia that they could find. The more data they had, the more likely they could accurately gauge the risks. The drugmaker refused Nissen’s requests for data, but because of litigation brought by Eliot Spitzer, then New York’s attorney general, the company had been forced to make some of it public. In all, he discovered the summaries of 42 trials — 35 of them unpublished. Most of them had been sponsored by Glaxo.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>After analysis, the results were stark: Avandia raised the risks of heart attack by 43 percent and of death from heart problems by 64 percent.<br />[skip]<br />Nissen and Wolski submitted their findings to NEJM on May 2, 2007.<br />Normally, an article takes several months to get published, but Drazen put it on a fast track, publishing it on the NEJM Web site 19 days later, on May 21.</p></blockquote>
<p>It is also true that the reporter did a very thorough job on an important but complicated topic and that Journal editors are trying to deal with the problem (and not just by getting a manuscript out in 19 days see below)  and Eliot Spitzer is a hero in spite of trouble keeping his pants on.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>I read about the problem of pharmaceutical company money distorting science in an article written by two editors of the New England Journal of Medicing the already retired Arnold Relman and the then editor in chief Marcia Angell.  Angel is still actively warning of the danger and is quoted in the article. </p>
<p>Importantly the value of meta analysis is recognized and regulators and journal editors have made sure it is possible (and I learn are going further)</p>
<p>
<blockquote>Medical journals have also acted in concert. In 2004, [NEJM  Editor in Chief Jeffrey M.  Drazen and editors at other journals made it much harder for companies to hide unflattering experiments, requiring drugmakers to register a summary description of their trials in a public database.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>“The drug companies went nuts about requiring registration,” Drazen said. “They said, ‘That’s secret information.’ We said, ‘That’s bull&#8212;-.’ </p></blockquote>
<p>I like Drazen&#8217;s prose style too.  The point of this post was going to be that the Clinical Trials Register makes meta analysis possible and that data nerds should get on it. Only reading the article did I learn that Nissen and Wolski were way ahead of me (I also recall  an excellent meta analysis of anti depressant trials using data from the registry which I read in the NEJM &#8212; this is one of my actual fields of actual research).</p>
<p>Now I learn that even more data will be made available</p>
<p>
<blockquote>In the wake of controversies arising around Vioxx, Avandia and Celebrex, many in the medical world have sought ways to ensure that drug research is free of commercial bias.<br />One of the leading proposals would be to compel drug companies to release all of the data from trials of drugs that are on the market.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Over the summer, the European Medicines Agency — the continent’s counterpart to the FDA — said it will move toward requiring the release of all such data. Glaxo, too, has said it is preparing for such a release, though other companies have yet to follow suit.</p></blockquote>
<p>Data freeks take note.</p>
