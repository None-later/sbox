                                                                    </div>

                                <p><a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB121383441884986739.html">Karl Rove</a> noted two problems that he had with McCain’s proposals:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;[W]e should look at any incentives that we are giving,&#8221; Mr. McCain said in May, even as he talked up a gas tax &#8220;holiday&#8221; that would give drivers incentives to burn more gasoline.  This past Thursday, Mr. McCain came close to advocating a form of industrial policy</p></blockquote>
<p>To his credit, Greg Mankiw focused on the tribute to <a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2008/06/karl-rove-channels-schumpeter.html">Joseph Schumpeter</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Mr. McCain&#8217;s angry statement shows a lack of understanding of the insights of Joseph Schumpeter, the 20th century economist who explained that capitalism is inherently unstable because a &#8220;perennial gale of creative destruction&#8221; is brought on by entrepreneurs who create new goods, markets and processes. The entrepreneur is &#8220;the pivot on which everything turns,&#8221; Schumpeter argued, and &#8220;proceeds by competitively destroying old businesses.&#8221;  Most dramatic change comes from new businesses, not old ones. Buggy whip makers did not create the auto industry. Railroads didn&#8217;t create the airplane. Even when established industries help create new ones, old-line firms are often not as nimble as new ones. IBM helped give rise to personal computers, but didn&#8217;t see the importance of software and ceded that part of the business to young upstarts who founded Microsoft.  So why should Mr. McCain expect oil and gas companies to lead the way in developing alternative energy? As with past technological change, new enterprises will likely be the drivers of alternative energy innovation.</p></blockquote>
<p>Greg did not focus on how Rove went after Obama for the windfall profits tax and maybe with good reason.  Rove somehow confused windfall profits taxes with taxes on gross profits, which are two very different things.  Rove also mentioned some standard rightwing claim relating to operating profit margins:</p>
<blockquote><p>They make about 8.3 cents in gross profit per dollar of sales. Why doesn&#8217;t Mr. Obama slap a windfall profits tax on sectors of the economy that have fatter margins? Electronics make 14.5 cents per dollar and computer equipment makers take in 13.7 cents per dollar, according to the Census Bureau. Microsoft&#8217;s margin is 27.5 cents per dollar of sales.</p></blockquote>
<p>No, <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q/is?s=MSFT&#038;annual">Microsoft</a> has received gross margins closer to 80 percent.  Does Rove not know the difference between gross profits and operating profits?  </p>
<p>But let’s not let Senator Obama off too easily as <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/25324195">Larry Rohter</a> reports:</p>
<blockquote><p>Mr. McCain advocates eliminating the multibillion-dollar annual government subsidies that domestic ethanol has long enjoyed. As a free trade advocate, he also opposes the 54-cent-a-gallon tariff that the United States slaps on imports of ethanol made from sugar cane, which packs more of an energy punch than corn-based ethanol and is cheaper to produce.  “We made a series of mistakes by not adopting a sustainable energy policy, one of which is the subsidies for corn ethanol, which I warned in Iowa were going to destroy the market” and contribute to inflation, Mr. McCain said this month in an interview with a Brazilian newspaper, O Estado de São Paulo. “Besides, it is wrong,” he added, to tax Brazilian-made sugar cane ethanol, “which is much more efficient than corn ethanol.”  Mr. Obama, in contrast, favors the subsidies, some of which end up in the hands of the same oil companies he says should be subjected to a windfall profits tax. In the name of helping the United States build “energy independence,” he also supports the tariff, which some economists say may well be illegal under the World Trade Organization’s rules but which his advisers say is not.  Many economists, consumer advocates, environmental experts and tax groups have been critical of corn ethanol programs as a boondoggle that benefits agribusiness conglomerates more than small farmers. Those complaints have intensified recently as corn prices have risen sharply in tandem with oil prices and corn normally used for food stock has been diverted to ethanol production.  “If you want to take some of the pressure off this market, the obvious thing to do is lower that tariff and let some Brazilian ethanol come in,” said C. Ford Runge, an economist specializing in commodities and trade policy at the Center for International Food and Agricultural Policy at the University of Minnesota. “But one of the fundamental reasons biofuels policy is so out of whack with markets and reality is that interest group politics have been so dominant in the construction of the subsidies that support it.”</p></blockquote>
<p>While we can debate this difference, <a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/2008/06/obama_offers_plan_to_rein_in_o.php">Reuters</a> notes another Obama proposal that will certainly be debated among economists:</p>
<blockquote><p>U.S. presidential candidate Barack Obama on Sunday proposed new steps to tackle speculation in energy markets that some blame for runaway oil costs … Among other measures, the plan would require U.S. energy futures to trade on regulated exchanges, Obama&#8217;s campaign said in a statement.  The campaign also said Obama backed legislation that would direct the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to investigate proposals such as increasing margin requirements in the market.  The Illinois senator also wants to see more transparency and oversight of institutional investors in the commodities markets.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://econospeak.blogspot.com/2008/06/bumper-sticker-response-to-high-oil.html">Peter Dorman</a> writes what I was only thinking:</p>
<blockquote><p>The strategy of choice right now seems to be “blame the speculators”, and Obama has jumped on this bandwagon. Not a good idea, in my opinion, for two reasons. First, there’s not much evidence that speculators are the cause of this price runup. Second, high oil prices—in fact, much higher oil prices—are good. They will combat climate change, slow down the environmental destruction of sensitive drilling areas and conserve a nonrenewable resource for future generations.  So what’s the alternative? The problem is not that oil is expensive, since burning it is truly costly for the human race, whether we pay the monetary price or not. The problem is that the money ends up in the hands of governments and oil companies that get rich simply because they’ve captured the resource. In economic terms, it’s the problem of rents: vast sums of money are being transferred from us, the consumers, to those who control a commodity in high demand but limited supply. And the solution is to get the money back. This is another reason why we need a cap-and-rebate plan for carbon. Put a tight cap on carbon fuels. Auction all the permits. Give the money back to the people. By drastically lowering demand we also put a lid on the price of oil at the wellhead. In other words, rather than paying lots of money to Exxon and the Saudi royal family, we pay it back to ourselves. Either way, oil will be expensive, because it has to be. But the solution is to get the money back, so we can protect our standard of living in other ways that won’t imperil the planet.</p></blockquote>
<p>The economic rent argument is one for a well designed (sorry if this sounds like an oxymoron) windfall profits tax.  And I’d certainly wants to auction off rather than just give away pollution rights if our political leaders ever do muster the courage to do something along the line of a cap-and-trade or Pigou tax on carbons.  But this let’s lower gasoline prices populism of McCain et al. is just pandering.</p>

<blockquote>Owning a home also ties workers down. Even in the best of times, the costs and hassle of selling one home and buying another — one estimate put the average cost of a house move at more than $60,000 — tend to make workers reluctant to go where the jobs are.</p></blockquote>
<p>Do we liberals really want to be making the case that society would be better off on net if more of the citizenry were effectively rootless migrant workers?</p>
<p>This is an area where there&#8217;s <a href="http://ideas.repec.org/p/use/tkiwps/0401.html">at least some conflict</a> between the macro- and micro-level evidence, and the more theoretically compelling micro evidence is less supportive of the view that there&#8217;s harmful causality from homeownership to labor market macro-features.</p>
<p>(It doesn&#8217;t help that the $60K figure for the &#8220;one estimate&#8221; of a typical move cost comes across as highly bogus.  Commission on a ~$200K median house at 6% is around 12 grand.  I&#8217;d guess typical search, moving [i.e. shipping], and closing costs would be of a similar magnitude.  Other things equal, search and moving costs would be incurred in moves absent homeownership and aren&#8217;t appropriately included in a figure intended to express relocation costs specific to owning.  Likewise, commissions and closing costs for homeownership should be expressed net of rental transactions costs.)</p>

<p>The Greenhouse Effect. How it Works</p>
<p>From Anthony Watts site, we have this graphic describing the heat wave length absorbtion properties of the Green House Gases (GHG).</p>
<p><img alt="" src="http://wattsupwiththat.files.wordpress.com/2008/06/atmospheric_spectral_absorption.png" border="0"></p>
<p>Water vapor is a far more pervasive and heat absorbant (see the above chart) GHG than any of the other GHGs. That does not imply it is the most effective GHG supporting the green house effect.</p>
<p>The workings of GHGs are very complex and still not fully understood. What is known is that:<br />1. GHGs maintain the planets current temperature range.<br />2. GHGs make up only 1% of the Atmosphere. Earth’s atmosphere is primarily composed of nitrogen (78 percent) and oxygen (21 percent), which do not react well to infrared wavelengths.<br />3. The overall atmospheric make up of GHGs is: Water Vapor 0 &#8211; 4% (Varies by temperature and pressure), CO2 .035%, Methane .0002% and Ozone .000004%.<br />4. The Sun emits energy in all ranges of electromagnetic frequencies (EM, EMF), from sound to cosmic rays, including the ultraviolet, visible, and infrared spectrum from .2 to 70 μm.<br />5. GHG molecules intercept these waves in both directions as they enter the atmosphere and as they are reflected by the Planet. 70% reach the surface of the Earth and heat it; therefore, those waves intercepted as they enter the atmosphere help cool the planet&#8217;s surface.<br />6. In intercepting these waves they are heated. Heated molecules also immediately release some of this heat IN ALL DIRECTIONS. Some heat energy is thereby blocked; some transmitted back to space; some transmitted down to the planet, and some to adjoining molecules.<br />7. The Earth releases some of its heat, and can be seen in the long wave infrared spectrum. Some of this surface heat energy is intercpeted by the GHGs, some bypass them and escape back to space, some of the intercepted heat energy is sent back down to the surface.<br />8. The heat sent back to the planet by the GHG is the &#8220;greenhouse effect&#8221;, keeping our atmosphere a calculated ~30 centigrade warmer than it would be otherwise.</p>
<p>If you are having trouble visualizing this, try this:</p>
<p>Imagine a basketball gym 1% covered by those children&#8217;s windmills (GHG molecules) all spinning and various distances from the floor to the ceiling. In the gym is a huge set of fans (space) that suck much of the air out of the gym. Now turn on the fire extinguishing water system (the Sun). Some of those water droplets are intercepted by the spinning blades. Most are not intercepted and bounce off the floor. The spinning blades are hit from all directions. All the droplets that hit the spinning blades are thrown off in all directions. The tops of the blades are wet, the bottoms, the edges and the floor are all wet. And, a large part of the droplets are ejected by the fan. Turn off the water (night) and keep the fan running, and we see that some of the water is ejected via the fans and some is returned to the floor by the spinning blades of the windmills. The most effective at this are those windmills close to the floor. Repeat (days/months). Extend the length of time between on/off cycles of the water (seasons) and repeat.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a very simple description of how the Green House process works. To expand upon it and add some minor complexity we can change the colors and quantity of windmills to reflect a specific ratio for each gas making up GHGs. Each windmill would vary in size shape and speed to reflect the various green house properties of the GHGs.</p>
<p>You should have many questions. For instance what happened to all those water droplets/energy waves that didn&#8217;t make it to space? How many of the droplets were effected, how, and what was their states? How were the windmills/GHG molecules effected? What was the direct and indirect effects on the molecules? As we delve deeper into the subject we find even more intricacies. We&#8217;ve just scratched the surface of the complexities still unknown about the Green House process.</p>
<p>This only touches on the complexities of the greenhouse effect. And this is only one part of the whole; water is also the major part of the hydrosphere. And now you have a concept for how difficult it is to analyze even this relatively small but important part of the Planet&#8217;s climate.</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t stand baseball.  Nevertheless, it is clear to me that if someone were to claim that, say, left-handed batters who refuse to swing at the first two balls that come at their direction when they&#8217;re at bat are more likely to hit home-runs than other baseball players, within a very short period of time legions of people would collect statistics and check whether this claim was true or not.  Heck, even most news organizations would be capable of pulling off this feat.  Within a short period of time, a few believers would remain who insisted on attributing batting prowess to, er, &#8220;well-rested&#8221; left-handers, but most, fans would refuse to take such nonsense seriously.</p>
<p>And yet, similar claims whose veracity or lack of it are vastly more important &#8211; just about anything this administration has ever stated about tax rates and economic growth, for instance &#8211; which are no more difficult to check against data  seem to live on unimpeded.  Why?<br />&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-<br />This one by cactus</p>

<blockquote><p>Despite liberal condemnation of the Bush tax cuts, virtually no one embraces a complete return to their pre-cut level — including the Democratic majority in Congress and both pending presidential nominees. There is good reason.  Implicit in this rejection is the admission that they were too high to return to. While the media won&#8217;t say it now, and certainly wouldn&#8217;t then, those supposedly halcyon days of fiscal policy rested on historically high tax levels … The Congressional Budget Office studied effective rates from 1979 to 2005. It showed the 1993-2000 average for all quintiles at 22.6% — higher than any other single year outside 1993-2000. The 2001 tax cut decreased these effective rates across the board, as the accompanying chart shows.  A comparison of the distribution of the federal income tax burden is similarly illuminating. Using 2008 Internal Revenue Service statistics, the 2001 cuts shifted the income tax burden up the economic ladder.  In addition to its impact on taxpayers, the 1993-2000 years also had a historically high federal tax burden on the economy. Over the last 60 years, the federal tax burden has averaged 17.9% of GDP; the 1993-2000 period averaged 19.2% … In contrast, the 2001-07 period averaged 17.9% of GDP — equaling the 60-year average despite the 2000 economic slowdown that tipped into a recession following 9/11.</p></blockquote>
<p>We have called Greg Mankiw on reporting the tax to GDP ratio without mentioning the spending to GDP ratio before.  No serious economist would deny that the long-run tax burden is driven by how much the government spends but we see not one mention of government spending or Federal deficits in Young’s commentary.  We could look at the 60-year average for Federal spending relative to GDP, for example, which was 19.4%.  I would argue that would be misleading as Federal spending for the first 20 years of this period averaged only 16.6%.  Unless Young is advocating a return to periods where we had no Medicare and Medicaid and a much smaller Social Security commitment, looking at spending relative to GDP over the past 40 years is the most sensible comparison.  This average is 20.8%.  </p>
<p>So what is Young advocating here with this comparison – that we return to the deficit financing of the 1980’s and the past 7 years?  Such fiscal irresponsibility is not sustainable.  Maybe J. T. Young is not savvy enough to realize this but Greg Mankiw is.  So why does Greg continue to tout Federal tax burden numbers that ignore the large deferred tax components known in some circles as the Bush deficits?</p>

                                <p>In comments to <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/06/so-how-would-i-lower-gasoline-prices.html">PGL&#8217;s post</a>, Michael McKinlay writes:<br />

<p>I agree, with the proviso that the incremental electricity generation should be relatively net-carbon-free.  Which leads to El Presidente&#8217;s response:<br />
<blockquote>Electric cars are not a solution; they just introduce new inefficiencies by moving power over the grid after power is produced. And eliminate different inefficiencies by eliminating transport of gasoline to stations.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not a solution. Supporting electric cars as an energy &#8220;solution&#8221; is like throwing a sheet over a pile of garbage; the problem is still there, just a little bit harder to see.</p></blockquote>
<p>Our comments section works in that we get the correct responses.  First, Coberly notes:<br />
<blockquote>[O]verall, counting all losses, carbon efficiency of electric cars is twice that of gas cars for the same service levels.</p></blockquote>
<p>and Pierre adds:<br />
<blockquote>[Y]ou can get eletricity from pretty much anything even oil, this is the stupid way, or wind, water, wave, man and woman, sun, nuclear&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>The economics of the situation is that we shouldn&#8217;t necessarily care if we introduce &#8220;inefficiencies&#8221; through substitution of less-scarce resources for more-scarce resources.  The fundamental problem is not that energy is scarce per se — the <a href="http://nasascience.nasa.gov/heliophysics/sun">nearest working fusion reactor</a> provides us with astronomical amounts.  What is scarce is the ability to convert energy into useful work without leaning on natural processes that store millions of years&#8217; worth of solar energy in conveniently combustible forms.  Overcoming that scarcity (or not) is, to a considerable extent, a matter of policy.</p>

                                <p>Andrew Biggs was Deputy Commissioner of Social Security until February, previously he was a top analyst at Cato&#8217;s Project for Social Security Privatization, currently he is doing something quite similar at AEI. He has a blog called <a href="http://andrewgbiggs.blogspot.com/">Notes on Social Security Reform</a> which deserves more traffic, not just because Andrew is a nice guy and polite host, but because I believe he is dead wrong. Very well informed and educated on the numbers, perhaps nobody better. But still wrong.</p>
<p>He left the following in comments on Soc Sec XXII, and raises the issue of how naive do you have to believe to put any credence in Low Cost outcomes. Well lets see:<br />
<blockquote>Sometimes when I talk to the Social Security actuaries about the problems with the low-cost projections, they reply that it&#8217;s not a big deal because no one actually believes there&#8217;s any real likelihood of them taking place. I&#8217;ll send them a link to this post to prove my point.</p>
<p>This topic came up at the AEI event on the tech panel report last Friday {edit to eliminate link not yet working-bcw} . Several members of the panel made the same point re the Low Cost Scenario, that&#8217;s it&#8217;s at such a low level of likelihood that it&#8217;s hard to interpret what it even means.</p></blockquote>
<p>Which I can only interpret as &#8216;Bruce is a dummy&#8217;. Well lets try saying that in numbers.<br />If we look at the Bush years few of them stand out, particularly in contrast to the 90s but one of the best was 2004. And if we look at the projections for Low Cost they basically settle out by 2012 and stay pretty much at those levels through the remainder of the 75 year window. What happens if we look at the respective numbers for Productivity, Real Wage and Real GDP for 2004, 2012, and ultimate?<br />(all numbers are drawn from Tables V.B1 and V.B2 of the 2008 Report <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/trLOT.html">List of Tables</a>)</p>
<p>Low Cost 2004/2012/ultimate</p>
<p>Productivity 2.4%/2.0%/2.0%<br />Real Wage   1.8%/1.2%/1.1%<br />GDP              3.6%/2.5%/2.1%<br />Naive number crunching below the fold.</p>
<p>Now 2004 was in retrospect not a bad year, but was it so over the top good so as never to be repeated, and indeed not even to be approached, ever?</p>
<p>If we take our first and second column we can contrast 2004 and 2012. In percentage terms what are we looking at:<br />Productivity 2.4% to 2.0% or 17% slowdown in growth rate<br />Real Wage 1.8% to 1.2% or 33% slowdown<br />GDP     3.6% to 2.5% or 31% slowdown</p>
<p>Now while these short term outcomes seem not unreasonable given the current housing/food/oil/credit crunch we are expected to accept that not only is this sharp slowdown permanent but that it is so over optimistic as to not even be worth discussing. Call me crazy but this seems outlandish to me, the argument that it will never, ever be economically better in America than it was in 2004, that in retrospect Bush economic policies in fact extracted the maximum possible growth out of the economy and then 25-30% more is absurd. Until or unless someone can make that case, preferedly using numbers.</p>
<p>Because it only gets worse when you look at Intermediate Cost, supposedly the median projection. Lets take our series 2004,  2012, ultimate  and use the same three variables:</p>
<p>Productivity 2.4%/1.8%/1.7% or 25% slowdown by 2012<br />Real Wage   1.8%/1.2%/1.1%  or 33% slowdown<br />GDP              3.6%/2.6%/2.1%  or 28% slowdown</p>
<p>Keep in mind that per the actuaries we are to accept this as the 50/50 mark, the chances being even that long term economic performance will be even worse.</p>
<p>Which raises some questions in my head. What is it structurally about the U.S. economy that suggests this is a reasonable median projection for the medium to long term? Is it simply out of the question to believe that some year in the future might be as good as 2004 was? Because as recently as 1999 the numbers were Productivity 2.4%, Real Wage 2.7%, Real GDP 4.4%, run those percentages against 2012 Intermediate and I want to start crying.</p>
<p>One final shot. It may be that there are arguments why this astonishing and permanent crash in growth rates is in fact a reasonable median, but all of those arguments simply undercut any basis for the notion that tax cuts on capital automatically translated to increased investment and so productivity. Because if you look at the time series the degradation starts hitting right at Q4 2005 or right at the point where tax cutters tell us we can expect to see the effects (18 months from enactment). If this is the miracle of tax cuts at work, they can keep it.</p>
<p>In any event it&#8217;s going to take a lot better data and arguments than I am seeing to convince me that these numbers simply represent the best that America can do.</p>

                                <p>Recorded U.S. payroll employment as of May 2008 was 25.28 million than it was as of January 1994.  NAFTA was signed in January 1994.  Did NAFTA cause this employment increase?  Of course not as <a href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/beat_the_press_archive?month=06&#038;year=2008&#038;base_name=does_mccain_think_that_the_sep">Dean Baker</a> notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Barring wars or environmental disasters, or incredibly bad economic policies, economies always create jobs. The serious question is the rate of job creation. In the case of NAFTA, a deal which was designed in a way that would put downward pressure on the wages of non-college educated workers, a key question is the rate of growth of wages of these workers over the last 15 years.</p></blockquote>
<p>Only an idiot would claim NAFTA created 25 million new jobs in the U.S. or 4 million in Canada.  So why did John McCain this claim and why did the <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB121399193357792665.html?mod=hpp_us_whats_news">Wall Street Journal</a> publish this claim without any challenge?</p>
<p>Update:  <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/06/20/conservatives-and-evil-speculators">Paul Krugman</a> has another piece of McCain silliness – this time on oil prices:</p>
<blockquote><p>Aren’t conservatives supposed to believe in efficient markets, where competition is good for everyone?  But McCain is following the likes of Steve Forbes and many articles in places like the National Review, all claiming that oil prices are a bubble, soon to disappear — a claim they’ve been making for at least three years.  What’s going on?  I think that conservative belief that the market is always right is colliding with another, even more deeply held belief — that there are no limits, except for those imposed by tree-huggers.The idea that oil might really be getting hard to find, in spite of the magic of capitalism, is just unacceptable; so they insist that it’s all craziness in the futures markets.  It’s not just conservatives who are into blame-the-speculators mode, of course; but they’re the loudest voices. It’s really weird.</p></blockquote>
<p>Weird indeed.  But I would really hate to see another President who had the mistaken impression that Steve Forbes is an economist.</p>

<blockquote><p>“Some suggestions are that perhaps we would see an enhancement of wildlife expansion because of the warmth of the pipeline,” she said. […] The pipeline has now become a meeting ground and “coffee klatch” for the caribou, she said.</p></blockquote>
<p>Jonah Goldberg pulls out some cherry picked silliness:</p>
<blockquote><p>People don’t realize that at Prudhoe Bay, where they have been drilling for 30 years, the central Arctic caribou herd has increased fivefold since they started drilling up there.</p></blockquote>
<p>The silliness of this argument is discussed <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/08/28/MNGR4EDJGT1.DTL">here</a>.  Now didn’t Goldberg claim that the Nazis were <a href="http://liberalfascism.nationalreview.com/">liberals</a>?  Maybe this idiot thinks that those ovens in the concentration camps were there to provide warmth to the Jewish prisoners?</p>
