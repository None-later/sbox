<blockquote><strong>Construction spending hits new record</strong></p>
<p>WASHINGTON (Reuters) &#8211; U.S. construction spending jumped a surprisingly large 0.5 percent to a record high in March as home building also hit record levels, a government report showed Monday. </p>
<p>Construction outlays in March climbed to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $1.052 trillion from a revised $1.047 trillion in February, the Commerce Department said. Wall Street analysts polled by Briefing.com had expected a 0.3 percent gain. </p>
<p>Total private construction rose 0.5 percent to $816 billion from $811 billion the previous month while private residential construction climbed 0.3 percent to $585 billion from a revised $584 billion in February. Both figures were fresh record highs. </p>
<p>Construction spending has been toppling records every month since February 2004 while residential outlays have been hitting new monthly highs since November last year on persistently low mortgage lending rates.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>Regardless of how one felt about the Vietnam War – Jane Fonda’s decision to sit in the North Vietnamese anti-aircraft gunship was foolish and offensive.  Ms. Fonda has said so herself.  And yet, <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/comment/lehtinen200504290804.asp">Dexter Lehtinen</a> refuses to let go:</p>
<blockquote><p>You may have heard that Jane Fonda apologized to Vietnam veterans in her current book. That&#8217;s incorrect. She expressed “regret” for one photograph, but remains proud of her Radio Hanoi broadcasts, her efforts to achieve a Communist victory, and her attacks on American servicemen as war criminals. She never uses the word “apology”.</p></blockquote>
<p>Since I have not read her book (and have no attention of doing so), I have no idea what she wrote about this stupid move many years ago.  But I have seen her interviews and she has indeed apologized.  I wonder if Mr. Lehtinen will offer an apology for basically lying to his readers?</p>

                                <p>You may recall during Reagan’s first term when U.S. policymakers convinced the Japanese automobile manufacturers to limit their exports to the U.S.  <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4484777.stm">BBC</a> reports we may seen round two of VERs:  </p>
<blockquote><p>Toyota boss fears US trade fury </p>
<p>Japan&#8217;s carmakers should consider giving their US rivals a breathing space to avoid the risk of a political backlash, the boss of Toyota has said. Japanese carmakers have taken nearly one third of the US market. Last week, General Motors posted a quarterly loss of $1.1bn, and Ford&#8217;s profits fell. By contrast, Nissan had record profits, and Honda&#8217;s net profit rose 27%. &#8220;We need to give time for some American companies to take a breath,&#8221; said Toyota Motor chairman Hiroshi Okuda.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics and BEA’s NIPA <a href="http://www.bea.doc.gov/bea/dn/nipaweb/TableView.asp#Mid">Table 6.4D</a> show employment in the manufacturing of motor vehicles, bodies, trailers, and parts sector declining from 1.31 million in 2000 to 1.11 million in 2004.  While this decline is not as dramatic as the decline from 1978 to 1982, where <a href="http://www.bea.doc.gov/bea/dn/nipaweb/TableView.asp#Mid">Table 6.4B</a> shows employment in the manufacturing of motor vehicles and equipment sector declining from 1,008,000 to 752,000, so maybe this Administration can resist doing what it did to imports of steel, lumber from Canada, and fresh fish from Asia.  Then again, there is consideration for renewed restrictions on apparel from China.  </p>
<p>BEA also has a mini-GDP table for the <a href="http://www.bea.doc.gov/bea/dn/nipaweb/TableView.asp#Mid">motor vehicle sector</a> for the period from 1967 to 2004.  The following graph shows domestic production and consumption as shares of GDP as well as exports (X) and imports (M).  Production in the U.S. motor vehicle sector has been volatile mainly because of the variability of U.S. purchases of automobiles.  While U.S. motor vehicle producers export their products abroad, exports as a share of GDP have rarely been above 0.3%.  Imports of motor vehicles as a share of GDP, however, have grown to over 1.2% of GDP. Detroit’s decline a generation ago did not begin from foreign competition but rather a decline in U.S. consumption of motor vehicles – likely caused by a weak economy and high gasoline prices.  The decline in production was exacerbated by the massive appreciation of the dollar, which encouraged imports.  </p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/mvgdp.jpg"></p>
<p>During the late 1990’s the trade gap in the motor vehicle sector widened even as U.S. production grew because of the very strong U.S. demand for motor vehicles.  While U.S. production and employment in this sector have declined since 2000, the decline is from lower demand and not simply more imports. The motor vehicle sector typifies much of the U.S. economy: weak growth in production and a weak labor market mainly because of weal aggregate demand growth.  Import demand is not the primary cause, but if Detroit could find a way to attract more foreign buyers and hence more exports – this would help their profits as well as employment.</p>
<p>One last note: <a href="http://www.townhall.com/columnists/georgewill/gw20050501.shtml">George Will</a> double counts one element of employee compensation by saying GM and Ford have additional costs related to health care coverage.  Does Will understand that firms and workers negotiate on the overall compensation package that includes both wages and fringe benefits?  Maybe one can argue that GM and Ford management made a bad deal with the UAW on the compensation  package as <a href="http://www.markarkleiman.com/archives/_/2005/04/getting_what_they_had_coming.php">Mark Kleiman</a> did, but Will’s column makes no more sense to me than it does to <a href="http://www.pandagon.net/">Jesse Taylor</a>.</p>
<p><em>Footnote to a sidenote</em>: <a href="http://donsingleton.blogspot.com/2005/05/health-care-and-american-automobile.html">Don Singleton</a> says I may have been unfair to George Will.  Don also correctly notes that providing universal health care coverage would require tax increases.  Let me pose the following amended version of why I think Mr. Will is totally off the mark here.  U.S. company A and Japanese company B compete in the same sector.  B hires workers at $20 an hour and provides no fringe benefits.  A hires workers at $15 an hour paying them a fringe benefit package that includes non-health care items worth $5 an hour.  So far – we have similar compensation packages in terms of costs to the firm.  Let’s add health care costs in the following way: A provides health care costs worth $5 an hour, but B does not as workers are covered by the government.  Now Don’s point is that the Japanese government is providing for this health care by imposing taxes.  So if B has to pay $5 per employee-hour in taxes than A does not, what is the difference?  Yes, AB and Kash will likely note that health care costs more in the U.S. than in other nations.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>The OECD <a href="http://www.oecd.org/document/33/0,2340,en_2649_201185_34824801_1_1_1_1,00.html">published a new report</a> today entitled &#8220;Pensions at a Glance,&#8221; which compares national pension programs across developed nations.  Highlights from their press release:<br />
<blockquote>In most countries, earnings-related pension arrangements are designed to help older people maintain a reasonable standard of living. For people who have spent a full career on average earnings, the average gross replacement rate of earnings provided by a pension in OECD countries is 57% of pre-retirement earnings.</p>
<p>But this figure, too, varies substantially between countries: in Luxembourg, the replacement rate for a full-career worker on average earnings is 102%, meaning that the pension is actually higher than earnings before retirement. Austria, Hungary, Italy, Spain and Turkey also provide generous pensions to full-career workers on average earnings, with replacement rates in excess of 75%.</p>
<p>By contrast, Ireland, which has only basic and targeted pensions and no earnings-related scheme, has the lowest replacement rate at average earnings, at 30.6%. Mexico, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States are also among the least generous, with replacement rates at average earnings of between 36% and 38.6%.</p></blockquote>
<p>Right now, according to the study, the US ranks 25th out of 30 countries in pension generosity toward the average individual &#8211; or, put another way, the US is fifth from the top when it comes to stinginess toward retirees.  But clearly Bush is not happy with America&#8217;s fifth place position &#8211; his proposal will substantially reduce benefits for &#8220;average&#8221; Americans (defined as those who make around $36,500 per year right now), dropping the replacement rate toward the mid-20s, as a percent of pre-retirement income.  This excerpted table (trimmed to save space) from <a href="http://www.cbpp.org/4-29-05socsec.htm">the CBPP</a> illustrates:</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/cbpp1.jpg"></p>
<p>Bush&#8217;s proposed benefit cuts will put the US definitively in first place when it comes to giving the least to its retirees, blowing Ireland&#8217;s miserly 30.6% retirement benefits out of the water toward the end of the century.</p>
<p>Now, to be fair, many European countries have (like the US) promised retirement benefits that they may not be able to sustain with current tax rates.  So a true comparison in the year 2075 may have to include possible upcoming benefit cuts in those countries.  Nevertheless, the international context provided by the OECD report does give some good perspective on the fact that current retirement benefits in the US for average workers are not particularly generous by developed-country standards, and that Bush&#8217;s proposed cuts in benefits for those average workers are quite severe in both an absolute and relative sense.</p>

                                <p>The trade balance for March will be released on May 11th.  There are reasons to expect that the March deficit will set another record.</p>
<p>Even with the recent slowdown in the US economy, the global economy appears to be slowing even faster with <a href="http://quote.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000006&#038;sid=av.l1KL7Y1tw&#038;refer=home">Japan</a> and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/27/business/worldbusiness/27germany.html">Germany</a> both either in recession or close.  Therefore exports for March probably grew slower than imports.  </p>

<p>Another troubling sign, according to the NY Times, is that <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/02/business/worldbusiness/02trade.html">China&#8217;s Trade Surplus</a> with the West is still rising.  In addition, oil prices for March, according to the US Dept of Energy, were almost $10 per barrel higher than the February contract price of $36.85 per barrel.   That will add approximately $4.5 Billion to the March trade deficit, before seasonal adjustments.</p>
<p>The story remains the same: housing is hot, the trade deficit grows, and global imbalances worsen.  Dr. Setser <a href="http://www.roubiniglobal.com/setser/archives/2005/04/an_unbalanced_e.html">commented</a> on this trend:<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;&#8230; the more resources (capital and labor) that flow into housing and other non-tradables sector, the harder it will be to move resources out of those sectors and into the tradables sector when the US eventually is forced to adjust. &#8230;  Shifts across sectors are not frictionless.</p>
<p>Current growth by and large is coming from the sectors of the US economy (and sectors of the Chinese economy) that would need to slow in an orderly rebalancing story. My worry: the more dependent the US economy becomes on housing, and the more dependent the Chinese economy becomes on exports, the higher the risk the &#8220;landing&#8221; will be hard rather than soft.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>For those interested in different views of the global imbalances, Dr. Roubini offers &#8220;<a href="http://www.roubiniglobal.com/archives/2005/05/global_imbalanc.html">Global Imbalances</a>: A Contemporary Rashomon Tale with Five Interpretations&#8230;&#8221; </p>
<p>Different Topic: The FED will be the hot topic for the next couple of days: Will they raise rates?  Yes, another 25 bps.  Will they drop the &#8220;measured&#8221; pace language?  I am as curious as anyone.

                                <p>Today’s <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7698687">Meet The Press</a> had two prominent Republicans distancing themselves from the Pozen plan.  Senator Allen seemed sincere about his opposition to cutting benefits for the middle class.  When Andrew Card was presented with the size of these cuts, he told Tim Russert:</p>
<blockquote><p>Now, the plan that you put on the table is really not necessarily the president&#8217;s plan.</p></blockquote>
<p>While Russert did not challenge this statement, during his interview with Senators Allen and Dodd, he kept referring to it as the President’s plan.  </p>
<p>Robert Novak, however, endorsed this plan on <a href="http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0504/30/cg.01.html">Capital Gang</a> as he’s always been for means testing.  Robert Novak – self-styled champion of the little guy – also said that Pozen’s plan only cut the rate of growth of benefits.  Of course, it cuts it to zero, but does this self-styled expert in economics understand the difference between nominal increases and real increases?</p>

                                <p>OK, my apologies for the clownish way of spelling “contradict”, but if we read <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/kudlow/kudlow200504291526.asp">Larry’s latest</a>, you’ll realize he did not at all challenge <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/04/gdp-growth-first-quarter-2005-advance.html">Kash</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Three months ago the first government estimate of gross domestic product for the fourth quarter of 2004 came in at 3.1 percent at an annual rate. At the time, the market consensus expected 3.5 percent growth. Immediately, the mainstream media started talking about an economic slowdown. Turns out, that 3.1 percent was finally revised up to 3.8 percent … Well, history is repeating itself &#8211; even though, if you look under the GDP hood, you’ll find that the country’s economic engine is humming along … The core U.S. economy &#8211; subtracting out trade and government spending and keeping in consumer spending and business capital-goods investment &#8211; actually expanded at a 4.3 percent annual rate in the first quarter compared to a 4.8 percent pace in the fourth quarter and a 5.2 percent rate for the last year.</p></blockquote>
<p>The core economy?  Subtracting out net exports and government purchases?  But why did Kudlow mention last year and not 2005QI – unless he read Kash’s post noticing that investment growth slowed in this latest quarter, which was Kash’s point.  But I’m trying to figure out if Kudlow knows something we don’t, as he seems sure the revised GDP report will show a number greater than 3.1% and not less than 3.1%.</p>

                                <p>It’s time for “fair and balanced” so we’ll let <a href="http://www.socialsecuritychoice.com/">Donald Luskin </a> tell us why Bush’s proposal makes sense by noting two of his posts today.  In one, he noted a couple of privatization principles:  </p>
<blockquote><p>Replace The Empty Promises Being Made to Younger Workers With Real Money. Younger workers should have the option of putting a portion of their payroll taxes into a voluntary personal account which will allow them to build a nest egg that belongs to them. This money will give workers an opportunity to receive a higher rate of return than the current Social Security System can provide. </p>
<p>Voluntary Personal Accounts Should Include The Risk Free Option Of Investing In Treasury Bonds. Voluntary personal accounts should include an investment option that allows workers to invest in U.S. Treasury bonds, which have no risk. Workers who have reservations about investing in the markets will still be able to rely on a Social Security check that is equal to or higher than today&#8217;s retirees. </p></blockquote>
<p>In another, he links to the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/infocus/social-security">White House webcite</a> that states:</p>
<blockquote><p>Today, some opponents of fixing Social Security are suggesting that the President&#8217;s proposals would result in &#8220;benefit cuts.&#8221; This rhetoric recklessly disregards the facts about the President&#8217;s proposal:</p>
<p>Fact: Under the President&#8217;s proposal, benefits would grow relative to today&#8217;s levels. Future generations of seniors would receive benefits that are at least as high as seniors receive today (even after adjusting for inflation.) </p>
<p>Fact: The Pozen proposal referenced by the President would allow for faster overall long-term benefit growth than can be paid by current-law Social Security. </p>
<p>Fact: Under the Pozen proposal referenced by the President, lowest-income Americans would get the fastest benefit growth of all, significantly faster than inflation. </p>
<p>Fact: Under the Pozen proposal referenced by the President, medium-wage workers would also receive faster benefit growth than the current system can pay. </p>
<p>Fact: The current Social Security system can fund only 74% of promised benefits in 2041. The Social Security actuary&#8217;s analysis of the Pozen proposal finds that at the same time, each of &#8220;Low Earners,&#8221; &#8220;Medium Earners,&#8221; and &#8216;High Earners&#8221; would all receive benefits that are higher than the current system can pay. </p>
<p>Fact: All of the above figures exclude income from personal accounts. Social Security Administration figures show that expected benefit growth will be even greater for those who choose to participate in voluntary personal accounts.  </p></blockquote>
<p><strong>I report, you decide! </strong></p>
<p>Update: The rebuttal is already in – ably provided by <a href="http://www.cbpp.org/4-29-05socsec.htm">Jason Furman</a> (with hat tip to Brad DeLong).   For those of you who thought I’d have to comment &#8211; outsourcing to CBPP is the way to go!</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>As we congratulate Duncan Black for correctly calling that Bush would endorse the Pozen plan, let’s review how George Bush defined the Social Security <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/04/28/bush.transcript/index.html">problem</a>: <br />
<blockquote>Congress also needs to address the challenges facing Social Security. I&#8217;ve traveled the country to talk with the American people. They understand that Social Security is headed for serious financial trouble and they expect their leaders in Washington to address the problem … These changes have put Social Security on the path to bankruptcy.  When the baby boomers start retiring in three years, Social Security will start heading toward the red. In 2017, the system will start paying out more in benefits than it collects in payroll taxes. Every year after that, the shortfall will get worse, and by 2041 Social Security will be bankrupt … any reform of Social Security must replace the empty promises being made to younger workers with real assets, real money … I know some Americans have reservations about investing in the stock market, so I propose that one investment option consist entirely of treasury bonds, which are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government … I think if seniors feel like they&#8217;re not going to get their check, obviously nothing&#8217;s going to happen.</p></blockquote>
<p>Granny is too smart to think her checks will not be mailed.  What makes granny upset is how the White House is flat out lying to her smart granddaughter who is working hard in college.  Granny might even be smart enough to know that with no reforms, the kid’s Social Security checks will be only 80% of what is currently promised but that beats the 50% of what is currently promised that would come from the Pozen plan.  Let’s also imagine that the kid’s parents are both 45 years sold working hard at jobs paying $45 a hour.  The parents have paid a lot into the Trust Fund for 20 years and will continue to pay a lot into it over the next 20 years, but would receive a modest benefit cut relative to what is currently promised if the Pozen plan goes into effect.  OK, you conservatives don’t like the term “benefit cut”, so let’s say this plan is a backdoor tax increase on these productive parents but not as large as the backdoor employment tax increase on the kid.  Juan Williams this morning on NPR said some conservatives will call this welfare.  There are some disincentives to working, but as a liberal – we should not impose the burden of Bush’s fiscal irresponsibility on the poor as much as we should raise taxes on those who Robert Novak call members of the “productive class” – such as Paris Hilton.</p>
<p>Bush also explained why we need privatization:</p>
<blockquote><p>I feel strongly that there needs to be voluntary personal savings accounts as a part of the Social Security system. I mean, it&#8217;s got to be a part of the comprehensive package. And the reason I feel strongly about that is that we got a lot of debt out there, a lot of unfunded liabilities, and our workers need to be able to earn a better rate of return on their money to help deal with that debt.  Secondly, I like the idea of giving someone ownership.  Why should ownership be confined only to rich people? Why should people, you know, not be allowed to own and manage their own assets, who aren&#8217;t the so-called investor class? I think everybody ought to be given that right. Matter of fact, Congress felt so strongly that people ought to be able to own and manage their own accounts, they set one for themselves. And, you know, you&#8217;ve heard me say &#8211; I like to say this, if it&#8217;s good enough for the Congress, it ought to be good enough for the workers to give them that option. The government&#8217;s never saying, &#8220;You have to set up a personal account.&#8221; We&#8217;re saying, &#8220;You ought to have the right to set a personal savings account so you can earn a better rate of return on your own money than the government can.&#8221; And it&#8217;s that difference between the rate of return &#8211; between what the government gets on your money and what a conservative mix of bonds and stocks can get on your money &#8211; that will make an enormous difference in a person being able to build his or her own nest egg that the government cannot spend. Now, it&#8217;s very important for our fellow citizens to understand there is not a bank account here in Washington, D.C., where we take your payroll taxes and hold it for you and then give it back to you when you retire. Our system is called pay as you go. You pay into the system through your payroll taxes and the government spends it. It spends the money on the current retirees and with the money left over, it funds other government programs. And all that&#8217;s left behind is file cabinets full of IOUs. The reason I believe that this ought to work is not only should a worker get a better rate of return, not only should we encourage ownership, but I want people to have real assets in the system.</p></blockquote>
<p>So if I own a Treasury bond, that is a real asset but it is not a real asset when a Trust Fund owns a Treasury bond.  And suppose I recently purchased a <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h15/data/wf/tcm20y.txt">bond</a> paying a 4.8% nominal return.  Bush is saying this is somehow a better return than the Trust Fund gets – even though its bond also pays a nominal return equal to 4.8%.  That is some kind of fuzzy math akin to Bush’s fuzzy accounting where he claimed that my getting a better return on my 401(K) lowers government liabilities.  Incidentally, all individuals currently have the right to open private accounts assuming they have sufficient resources.  </p>
<p>But when Bush was suggesting the Trust Fund is pay as you go, David Altig might be surprised to hear that I think Bush had a point with the premise that the Trust Fund surplus funds other government programs.  After all, Bush is the one that made sure General Fund revenues were not sufficient to fund all of General Fund expenditures.  </p>
<p>Finally Bush explained why we must act now:</p>
<blockquote><p>Social Security is a big issue, and it&#8217;s an issue that we must address now. You see, the longer we wait, the more expensive the solution&#8217;s going to be for a younger generation of Americans. The Social Security trustees have estimated that every year we wait to solve the problem, to fix the hole in the safety net for younger Americans, costs about $600 billion.</p></blockquote>
<p>This canard is bizarre on several fronts as it uses a nominal interest rate applied to cash flow deficits in the future.  The Trust Fund is currently earning interest income and the real interest rate is about half the nominal interest rate.  Maybe it is true that the real present value of the unfunded liability is rising by about $300 billion a year, but Bush’s proposal insures no additional revenues for the Trust Fund and delays any significant reductions in outlays for another decade.  In the meantime, the real interest obligations for the overall Federal debt plus the non-interest deficit for the General Fund are almost $500 billion a year.  And the energy part of Bush’s appearance last night promised more pork barrel spending.  Maybe my retirement plan should have included buying <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=XOM&#038;d=t">this stock</a> a few years ago.</p>
