<blockquote><p>Hurting in opinion polls and haunted by charges of lavish personal spending, Democrat John Edwards took his presidential campaign on Monday to some of the most impoverished parts of the country.  With America&#8217;s poor the crux of his campaign, the former vice presidential candidate launched an eight-state tour in New Orleans, a city that exposed U.S. poverty to a global audience following Hurricane Katrina in August 2005. His focus on poverty challenges his top Democratic rivals, Sens. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, and enables Edwards to present himself as a leader with a cause bigger than his own ambition, analysts said.  &#8220;This is not a political strategy. This is a huge moral issue facing America&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Indeed it is.  Critics of Edwards might legitimately ask the question as to what government policy could do to address the poverty problem.  That is a fair question – and let’s have that debate.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>This <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/15/business/15gilded.html?ex=1342152000&#038;en=b93e1c0193b4182c&#038;ei=5090&#038;partner=rssuserland&#038;emc=rss">NY Times </a>piece is making a comparison to yesteryears when those mansions in Newport, RI were built. It starts with Sanford I. Weil of Citigroup and how he compares to Andrew Carnegie.</p>
<p>First, how does this period compare: <br />
<blockquote>Only twice before over the last century has 5 percent of the national income gone to families in the upper one-one-hundredth of a percent of the income distribution — currently, the almost 15,000 families with incomes of $9.5 million or more a year, according to an analysis of tax returns by the economists Emmanuel Saez at the University of California, Berkeley  and Thomas Piketty at the Paris School of Economics. (I have posted from their data in the past.) Such concentration at the very top occurred in 1915 and 1916, as the Gilded Age was ending, and again briefly in the late 1920s, before the stock market crash.</p></blockquote>
<p>Mr Weil view:<br />
<blockquote>“I once thought how lucky the Carnegies and the Rockefellers were because they made their money before there was an income tax,” “I want to give away my money rather than have somebody take it away,”</p></blockquote>
<p>We have Mr. Kenneth C. Griffin, who received more than $1 billion last year as chairman of a hedge fund, the Citadel Investment Group, declared:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The money is a byproduct of a passionate endeavor.”<br />“We have helped to create real social value in the U.S. economy,” he said. “We have invested money in countless companies over the years and they have helped countless people.” “The income distribution has to stand,” Mr. Griffin said, adding that by trying to alter it with a more progressive income tax, “you end up in problematic circumstances. In the current world, there will be people who will move from one tax area to another. I am proud to be an American. But if the tax became too high, as a matter of principle I would not be working this hard.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such positions are summed up with:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Carnegie made it abundantly clear that the centerpiece of his gospel of wealth philosophy was that individuals do not create wealth by themselves,” said David Nasaw, a historian at City University of New York. and the author of “Andrew Carnegie” (Penguin Press). “The creator of wealth in his view was the community, and individuals like himself were trustees of that wealth.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Really?  They are the Trustees?</p>
<p>Can it be anymore egocentric? Why yes they can:</p>
<blockquote><p>Lew Frankfort, chairman and chief executive of Coach the manufacturer and retailer of trendy upscale handbags, who was among the nation’s highest paid chief executives last year, recaps the argument. “The professional class that developed in business in the ’50s and ’60s,” he said, “was able as America grew at very steady rates to become industry leaders and move their organizations forward in most categories: steel, autos, housing, roads.”</p>
<p>That changed with the arrival of “the technological age,” in Mr. Frankfort’s view. Innovation became a requirement, in addition to good management skills — and innovation has played a role in Coach’s marketing success. “To be successful,” Mr. Frankfort said, “you now needed vision, lateral thinking, courage and an ability to see things, not the way they were but how they might be.” (Like this was not needed in the past?) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Please note, Mr. Frankfort is not emphasizing the manufacturing, he is emphasizing the marketing. </p>
<p>What would be the “problematic circumstances” of being more progressive in the tax structure? Why do they not want to pay the help that they acknowledged got them where they are? Even in the good old days of Carnegie, paying the help was not considered a charitable thing to do.</p>
<p>I have posted that things have changed. We make money differently today. The article notes: </p>
<blockquote><p>The Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 outlawed the mix, blaming conflicts of interest inherent in such a combination for helping to bring on the 1929 crash and the Depression. The pen displayed in Mr. Weill’s hallway is one of those Mr. Clinton used to revoke Glass-Steagall in 1999. He did so partly to accommodate the newly formed Citigroup, whose heft was necessary, Mr. Weill said, if the United States was to be a powerhouse in global financial markets.</p></blockquote>
<p>The article does offer counter opinions to this self aggrandizement. I&#8217;ll leave it to you to read the rest except for this which I think sums up the counter opinion (in a more polite manor than I would have): </p>
<blockquote><p>“I don’t see a relationship between the extremes of income now and the performance of the economy,” Paul A. Volcker, a former Federal Reserve Board chairman, said in an interview, challenging the contentions of the very rich that they are, more than others, the driving force of a robust economy. </p></blockquote>

                                <p>Here is a short piece by <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=ZmQ0NGFjY2Q2YmFmMDczYjIwMjA4OTdjMGFkODAxY2Y=">Byron York in the National Review Online&#8217;s Corner</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Going through the presidential candidates&#8217; financial reports, it&#8217;s interesting to see how top Democrats have controlled their spending — fiscal restraint! — while some top Republicans are either living beyond their means or are operating close to the edge. With the exception of Rudy Giuliani, it appears that the Republicans are not as good as Democrats at managing their money.</p>
<p>As of the end of the second quarter of 2007, Hillary Clinton took in $27 million, spent $12 million, and has $45 million in cash on hand, with a total debt of $3 million. Barack Obama took in $33 million, spent $16 million, and has $36 million in cash on hand and a total debt of $922,000. John Edwards took in $9 million, spent $6.3 million, and has $13.3 million in cash on hand with a total debt of $0.</p>
<p>We all know John McCain&#8217;s money problems. But Mitt Romney is burning money at a rate very close to 100 percent. Romney took in $21 million, spent $20.5 million, and has $12 million in cash on hand, with a total debt of $9 million. That debt, of course, represents Romney&#8217;s personal cash infusions into the campaign, without which he would have run a big deficit in the second quarter and would have ended the period with about $3 million in cash on hand. Giuliani took in $17.5 million, spent $11 million and has $18 million in cash on hand with a total debt of $0.</p></blockquote>
<p>York is clearly surprised that Rep candidates don&#8217;t seem to be fiscally responsible relative to Dem candidates.

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>This post is on the Civilian Labor Force level and how it changed over time. I will be using data from the BLS, in particular <a href="http://www.bls.gov/webapps/legacy/cpsatab1.htm">Table LNS11000000</a>. Because the data is produced monthly, I will be looking at the data for January of each year, as January is the month in which a President takes (and leaves) office.</p>
<p>A few comments before I go on. I recognize that the Civilian Labor Force is not especially affected by actions of the President, but I feel its important to look at this series because it may help explain some of the difference in economic performance between Presidents. For instance, one would assume that real GDP per capita might grow more quickly as the Civilian Labor force grows more quickly, in part because presumably that increases the ratio of potential workers in the economy, and in part because of network effects. </p>
<p>I also hasten to add… as pointed out by <a href="http://www.haloscan.com/comments/angrybear/1127154466917452793/#648637">reader I Kitov</a> on another thread, there are problems with this series. In particular, “the BLS used postcensal estimates before 2000 and intercensal estimates after 2000.” Now, I’m going to use this data anyway because I want to look at the employment to population ratio in a follow-up post, and the employment rate developed by the BLS is based in part on the same population estimates and I want to be able to look at the two series (civilian labor force and employment to population) together. One does what one can…</p>
<p>OK. So what does the seasonally adjusted civilian labor force look like? </p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rprg8LCZtZI/AAAAAAAAAcQ/95RIDMUVAMg/s1600-h/civilian+labor+force+graph.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rprg8LCZtZI/AAAAAAAAAcQ/95RIDMUVAMg/s320/civilian+labor+force+graph.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Eyeballing, it looks pretty steady. But is it? Here’s a summary…</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RptekbCZtbI/AAAAAAAAAcg/Y_onVoiL9uk/s1600-h/civilian+labor+force+table.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RptekbCZtbI/AAAAAAAAAcg/Y_onVoiL9uk/s320/civilian+labor+force+table.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>The slowest growth rate of the civilian force… under GHW. Second fastest under GW. Third under Ike. In terms of growth rate of <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/06/comparing-presidents-real-gdp-per.html">growth rate of real GDP per capita</a>, these three came out last, third last, and second last of all administrations beginning in 1952. So far, what we expect. But Carter and Reagan at the top of the Civilian Labor Force growth rates? they were 4 and 3 in terms of real GDP per capita. </p>
<p>I Kitov suggests in comments that perhaps the yearly average makes more sense&#8230; a one month figure could be heavily skewed by error. Table 2 below looks at that. (Hence, for Carter, the growth rate is the change from 1976, the year before he took office, to 1980, his last year in office.)</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RptegLCZtaI/AAAAAAAAAcY/PugbQaM_Ucc/s1600-h/civilian+labor+force+table+2.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RptegLCZtaI/AAAAAAAAAcY/PugbQaM_Ucc/s320/civilian+labor+force+table+2.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Offhand, results are even less suggestive of a relationship between a change in the number of civilian workers and a change in real GDP per capita. </p>
<p>FWIW, the correlation between the % change in real GDP per capita and the % change in the average size of the civilian labor force is only 0.2. And between % change in the average size of the civilian labor force and next year&#8217;s % change in real GDP, its -.11. (i.e., negative 011)</p>
<p>Clearly something is not right. My guess… it’s the folks that are employed, and the ratio of the employed to the total population that matter. I’ll try to post on these topics soon.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p>Update.</p>
<p>My Friday post seemed to be riddled with errors. Fortunately, readers caught those errors, and I made changes. Whatever the problem was Friday, there seems to be a residual of it still here today&#8230; I Kitov points out the ranking on the summary table as originally posted was misleading, and that led to changes in the verbage as well. Hopefully I&#8217;m now over these mistakes, or I have to spend a bit more time editing. Apologies.</p>

Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said … &#8220;I think the best thing we could do for our troops is let&#8217;em win,&#8221; Graham retorted.</p></blockquote>
<p>I thought the greatest politicization of military action was that decision on March 19, 2003 to invade Iraq so that Bush-Cheney would win the 2004 election.  But let’s review some of the highlights of Graham’s appearance to see if he has any earthly clue what “win” even means.  After a lot of hot air about some global war “supporting a form of moderation not known to the Mideast” where this surge is supposed to defeat Al Qaeda and Iran at the same time, Lindsey suggests that we Democrats advocate “making a mistake for the ages”.  No Senator – before March 19, 2003, neither Al Qaeda nor Iran were that powerful.  The mistake of the ages was made on March 19, 2003 and you supported it.  But here is Senator Graham painting the surge as working:</p>
<blockquote><p>As far as the stress of the military, it has been an enormously difficult war. And I was in Baghdad on July the Fourth of this year.  We had the highest re-enlistment &#8211; the largest re-enlistment ceremony in a wartime environment known to our country.  The one thing I can tell you about our troops, they are doing things we’ve never done before, because there’s more of them.  The surge is producing results.  The biggest result from these brave men and women’s new effort is that the Sunnis who’ve tasted al-Qaeda’s life in the Sunni part of Iraq, Anbar province &#8211; when he was running for the Senate, it was declared lost.  Well, it has, it has been recaptured.  And the people living in Anbar have chosen to align themselves with us, because al-Qaeda overplayed their hand.</p></blockquote>
<p>That’s odd as it was these Sunnis who we decided to kick out of power four years ago.  Maybe that’s why the Shia government is not all that happy that US forces have aligned with these Sunnis.  Something else is odd – if both the Shias and the Sunnis hate Al Qaeda, then why is this White House and Senator Graham saying that if we leave, Osama bin Laden takes reign of the Iraqi government?  </p>
<blockquote><p>Because it’s in our national security interest to make sure that al-Qaeda does not have a safe haven &#8230; General Petraeus says the number one enemy of America is al-Qaeda in Iraq, and Lee Hamilton in December said that our chief national security interest, in a sense, is al-Qaeda in Iraq. Let me tell you why we have to beat al-Qaeda in Iraq before anything else falls into place.  Number one, they’re an extremist group that have come to this country, Iraq, to destroy this effort at democracy.  And they were able to thrive under the old strategy.  They were able to occupy a territory in Anbar province.</p></blockquote>
<p>Look if we leave Iraq, Al Qaeda will have no friends there.  I suspect that they’ll find a way to sneak out the back door so as to avoid being slaughtered in an Iraqi civil war.  But if they can spook stupid American politicians like George W. Bush and Lindsey Graham into keeping our boots on the ground occupying a Muslim nation, they are winning and we are losing.  Is Lindsey Graham so stupid not to realize this – or is he as Jim Webb suggests just another rightwing political hack?  Either way – Americans would be fools to listen to him. </p>
<p>Of course, the real winner during the Senator&#8217;s &#8220;performance&#8221; was his repeating the two weeks line as in this strategy has been in place for only two weeks with enormous success.  Let&#8217;s recall that the timing of the Iraq invasion was on Bush&#8217;s own choosing and that we 52 months ago.  So what does the Senator thinks our soldiers were doing for the first 2600 weeks of this war &#8211; twiddling their thumbs?</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://mediamatters.org/items/200707150002">Media Matters</a> goes further down in the MTP show to find Robert Novak acting a bit sexist and racist at the same time:</p>
<blockquote><p>NOVAK: A lot of people don&#8217;t want him back, though, for a third term. And I think it&#8217;s very dangerous to call this a third term of Bill Clinton.</p></blockquote>
<p>Oh wow – Hillary will just step back and let her man do her job?  Novak continues:</p>
<blockquote><p>Republicans are very pessimistic about 2008. When you talk to them off the record, they don&#8217;t see how they can win this thing. And then they think for a minute, and only the Democratic Party, with everything in their favor, would say that, &#8220;OK, this is the year either to have a woman or an African-American to break precedent, to do things the country has never done before.&#8221; And it gives the Republicans hope.</p></blockquote>
<p>Oh Lordy mercy!  Can’t have a black man or some woman leading this country!  Of course, the number three candidate in our party is a white male.  But then John Edwards is one of those TRIAL LAWYERS, which makes Novak really go batty.  As Media Matters noted:</p>
<blockquote><p>Neither host Tim Russert nor any of Novak&#8217;s fellow panelists, Bloomberg News Washington managing editor Al Hunt, Republican strategist Mike Murphy, and Democratic strategist Bob Shrum &#8211; all of whom are, like Novak, white men &#8211; commented on or challenged Novak&#8217;s assertion.</p></blockquote>
<p>It does seem that when Jim Webb dressed down Lindsey Graham – that was the highlight of the show.  I’m glad I had to leave right after their interview.</p>

                                <p>Hat tip to <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2007/07/caccianli-i-cie.html">Brad DeLong</a> for this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Personally I see no need to omit Norway. I do see a need to plot the Norway point on the graph correctly. The revenues plotted on the vertical scale include oil excise taxes levied on corporations. The tax rates plotted on the horizontal scale do not&#8211;hence the Norway &#8220;tax rate&#8221; of 28% rather than the correct 52%.</p></blockquote>
<p>Really?  Yes &#8211; <a href="http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/Europe/Norway-TAXATION.html">really</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Corporate income taxes are levied at a flat rate of 28% (a combination of 21.25% national tax, and 6.75% municipal tax). Also, employers contribute up to 16.7% of paid wages to the Social Security Scheme. Companies involved in oil or gas pay a special oil tax of 50% in addition to the standard 28%. All income from capital is taxable at 28%, except dividends, which are taxed at 11%.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is a specific example of <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/07/effective-corporate-tax-rates-for.html">my general point</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The other thing is the comparison of C corporate profit taxes to GDP when corporate profits are not the only form of capital income. In 2006, US C corporate profits represented only 12.2% of US GDP but the share of capital income to GDP was much higher as there are several forms of capital income. And yes, interest income and S corporate profits are taxed – just differently. Our post had considered two aspects of the right-hand side variables: (1) are we measuring tax rates appropriately; and (2) are they other factors driving capital income and taxes from such income (such as oil revenues)? But the real issue is whether we should put any stock in looking at a subset of capital income when making cross-national comparisons?</p></blockquote>
<p>Since <a href="http://www.poorandstupid.com/2007_07_08_chronArchive.asp#7537668908152803874">Donald Luskin</a> and the <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB118428874152665452.html?mod=opinion&#038;ojcontent=otep">WSJ oped crew</a> tried to make a case for the Laffer curve that depended critically on the Norway data point – one would think they would have gotten this key data point correct.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://www.finfacts.com/irelandbusinessnews/publish/printer_1000article_10007581.shtml">This source</a> compares total taxes as a share of GDP across the OECD nations and this U.S. comes out at the lower end.  OK, Korea and Mexico have lower tax burdens but these two nations aren’t exactly beating us in per capita GDP.  Table B shows taxes on income and corporate profits and the source provides some interesting details including this one on Ireland:</p>
<blockquote><p>Table A shows that in 2005, Irish taxation as a percentage of GDP was 30.5% compared with 32.5% in 1995. However, because GDP includes the output of the multinational sector, which is very significant in Ireland (almost 90% of Irish exports are made by foreign-owned firms), it is more useful to use Gross National Product &#8211; the total value of final goods and services produced in a country plus income from Irish capital held abroad set-off against transfers of net earnings of multinationals &#8211; in effect net income outflows from Ireland. In Other OECD countries, there is only a marginal difference between GDP and GNP. We can see from Table C that the Irish tax burden has changed little since 1995. While personal taxes have fallen, indirect or stealth taxes have risen.</p></blockquote>
<p>I offer this as AB reader Sammy has been spewing some Celtic Tiger mythology here with checking out what <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/12/irish-economic-miracle-and-tax-policy.html">we wrote</a> way back when.  I have to admit I found this when Googling to see how Brad came up with the suggestion that the effective corporate tax rate in Norway was 52%.  If the tax rate on oil profits was 78% and the tax rate on other profits was 28%, the weighted average would be 52% only if oil profits were 48% of the total.  But it seems oil does represent 25% of GDP so this assumption about oil profits as a share of total profits being 48% is plausible.  After all, the share of value-added accruing to profits for the oil sector are likely quite high relative to the shares in the other sectors of Norway’s economy.</p>

<blockquote><p>Greg&#8217;s use of the word &#8220;only&#8221; in the sentence &#8220;The poorest fifth of the population, with average annual income of $15,400, pays only 4.5 percent&#8221; makes it seem as though he does not consider that amount to be much of a burden to the poor, not like a rich taxpayer who &#8220;forks-over&#8221; 31.1 percent of their income which seems to imply much more hardship. But remember, &#8220;Fairness is not an economic concept.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Mark continues by reminding us of his essay from a couple of years ago.  But I have a couple of other objections to what Greg wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>The C.B.O.’s most recent calculations of federal tax rates show a highly progressive system. (The numbers are based on 2004 data, but the tax code has not changed much since then.) &#8230; A question for any political candidate today is whether he or she agrees with the Bush tax ceiling. If not, how high above a third is he or she willing to go?</p></blockquote>
<p>It seems Greg left out two important items.  By focusing on Federal taxes, he has omitted state and local taxes.  Most people do pay these.  And by looking at 2004, he is forgetting that the budget is not exactly in balance.  Yes, the General Fund deficit was rather large so current tax obligations do not capture the cost of government as in all those deferred tax bills thanks to the Bush tax “cuts”.  </p>
<p>But one might try <a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2007/07/current-fiscal-picture.html">Greg did</a> that the unified deficit is not that large:</p>
<blockquote><p>At 1.5% of GDP, this year&#8217;s deficit is well below the 40-year average of 2.4% of GDP &#8230; Of course, there is still a looming long-run fiscal gap. The short-run fiscal picture, however, does not look historically anomalous.</p></blockquote>
<p>Greg leaves out the fact that we have a large Social Security surplus, which is the reason why he can argue that the “deficit” is not that large.  Implicit in the use of this figure is the proposition that those payroll “contributions” we are making are NOT to become our retirement benefits down the road.  As long as we are posing questions for political candidates, let’s pose this one for Mitt Romney (as Greg is one of his advisors): do you intend to slash Social Security benefits in the future as you continue to impose these employment taxes?  After all, you want to maintain the Bush tax “cuts” and still have a large defense department.</p>

<p>The latest nonsense from the WSJ on the alleged <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB118428874152665452.html?mod=opinion&#038;ojcontent=otep">Laffer curve</a> apparently also irked Bruce Bartlett who emailed me an OECD document of tax rates in various nations from 2000 to 2006.  I think Bruce was hoping someone could do a proper regression – but note <a href="http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/003185.html">Max</a> is having way too much fun with these regressions.  I decided to graph the changes in the alleged tax rates for Canada, Japan, Mexico, Switzerland, and the US (my selection of nations to include was sort of arbitrary but there will be a point in a moment).  </p>
<p>One may take from the graph that other nations are lowering their corporate tax rates but ours is stuck at 39.3%.  Canada’s was 44.6% in 2000 but it was only 36.1% in 2006.  Mexico’s was 35% in 2000 but it was only 32% in 2000.  Even high tax Japan has dropped its rate to 39.5%, and yet ours is at 39.3%. So the OECD seems to suggest.  But there seem to be several things missing here.</p>
<p>First – if you are wondering why the US rate is 39.3% rather than 35% &#8211; think state income taxes.  Of course, US corporations often don’t pay a 4.3% effective state tax rate as tax planning plays such as Delaware Intangible Holding Companies (can your say transfer pricing) allow opportunities to lower this effective tax rate.  At the Federal level, US corporations used to have that FISC/EIE game and now have a Section 199 game.  So if you tax director has you stuck with a 39.3% effective tax rate – fire him now.  </p>
<p>That Swiss rate of 21.3% might look low but it is not as low as the 12.5% Irish rate.  So why are so many US based companies shifting intangible profits to Switzerland rather than Ireland?  Could it be that the Swiss Federal rate is only 8.5%?  The alleged 21.3% rate contains a high local government rate.  Only thing is that a lot of companies are located in the Swiss equivalent of Delaware.  </p>
<p>Also note that the Mexican corporate profits tax is lower than the US rate.  So why do many companies try to source more income in the US and less in Mexico (can you say transfer pricing again).  It seems that the Mexican government imposes a tax on profits to pay for their version of Social Security.  </p>
<p>The WSJ’s amateurish graphs and all the regressions in the world are not that impressive unless one addresses two matters.  The first matter is the above concern regarding measuring effective tax rates.  But I think that <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2007/06/trompe_loeil.cfm">The Economist</a> hinted at a more important concern a while back:</p>
<blockquote><p>Why, no, there isn&#8217;t.  You could also choose to have enormous deposits of oil and natural gas! Seriously, I don&#8217;t understand how anyone is making that argument from that graph.  Throwing out Norway, where high GDP is due to fossil fuel reserves that cannot be achieved through any policy decision, there seems to be a downward sloping, although noisy, curve running from America and Ireland through Canada and the higher-spending European countries.  Even if you throw out America &#8211; even if you throw out Ireland &#8211; the relationship is pretty clear.</p></blockquote>
<p>This comment was directed at something <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2007/06/social-spending.html">Mark Thoma</a> wrote but if we toss out Norway as an outlier that has an alternative explanation of high tax revenues as a share of GDP.  <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2007_07/011682.php">Kevin Drum</a> notes what happens when one tosses out this outlier:</p>
<blockquote><p>Norway, with a corporate tax rate of about 29%, generates enormous amounts of corporate tax revenue. But then, since it&#8217;s the only way to get an upside-down U out of the data, the graph goes nearly vertical. Even the Journal&#8217;s editorial writers, normally a pretty barefaced bunch, were apparently too embarrassed about this economic singularity to follow the right side of their graph to its logical conclusion, but we can: at a rate of about 33% corporate taxes produce no revenue at all. An increase of a mere four percentage points destroys tax revenue entirely! Mirabile dictu!  A junior high school geometry student would be embarrassed to produce work like this.</p></blockquote>
<p>Or may the WSJ is telling us that as soon of the effective tax rate drops just below 30%, we will find lots of oil in them thar hills &#8211; <a href="http://www.fiftiesweb.com/tv/beverly-hillbillies.htm">black gold, Texas tea</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>:  A couple of more points about this WSJ nonsense.  The following statement is not quite right:</p>
<blockquote><p>All of which means that the U.S. now has the unflattering distinction of having the developed world&#8217;s highest corporate tax rate of 39.3% (35% federal plus a state average of 4.3%), according to the Tax Foundation.</p></blockquote>
<p>From what I have read from the Tax Foundation, they tend to agree with <a href="http://www.economist.com/countries/Japan/profile.cfm?folder=Profile-FactSheet">this</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The standard national corporate tax rate is 30%. Including local taxes, the effective standard corporate tax rate is 40.9%.</p></blockquote>
<p>Unless the WSJ oped writers do not consider Japan to be part of the developed world, their statement is false.  The other thing is the comparison of C corporate profit taxes to GDP when corporate profits are not the only form of capital income.  In 2006, US C corporate profits represented only 12.2% of US GDP but the share of capital income to GDP was much higher as there are several forms of capital income.  And yes, interest income and S corporate profits are taxed – just differently.  </p>
<p>Our post had considered two aspects of the right-hand side variables: (1) are we measuring tax rates appropriately; and (2) are they other factors driving capital income and taxes from such income (such as oil revenues)?  But the real issue is whether we should put any stock in looking at a subset of capital income when making cross-national comparisons?</p>
<p><strong>Update II</strong>: I need to point out that it was <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2007/07/yet-again-tax-c.html">Mark Thoma</a> who combined the Economist blog tossing out Norway to this supply-silliness and that the <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2007/07/it-is-outlandis.html">Economist blog</a> is being unfair to Mark.</p>

<blockquote><p>the Laffer Curve works in the real world just as predicted by Laffer&#8217;s original axiom &#8211; and that the US is exactly in the wrong place on it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Luskin wrote this yesterday at 8:05 AM.  A few hours later, <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2007/07/yet-again-tax-c.html">Mark Thoma</a> noted: </p>
<blockquote><p>The blue line is supposed to be the Laffer curve, but this is far from compelling. Since it looks like all that&#8217;s been done here is to draw a line through an outlier, Norway (an outlier that in other contexts we are told to ignore because it is an outlier, e.g. see below), and since this is clearly not the best fitting line to these data, here&#8217;s another possibility … I haven&#8217;t actually run the regression, but it looks clear to me that revenues rise with tax rates, and the fit also looks better than in the first graph. Toss out Norway, and the fit looks even better</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/003184.html">Max Sawicky</a> calls the WSJ graph the dumbest thing he has ever seen and adds:</p>
<blockquote><p>For fun I did a regression line for similar data (same year, same countries). I threw out those annoying communist outliers at the top (Luxembourg and Norway) &#8212; countries with high tax rates and revenues. (By the way, when you include them without forcing a zero intercept, there is no significant relationship between the corporate tax rate (combined, central and sub-central govs) and corp rev/GDP. Very slight negative relationship. Throw out the two outliers and the same non-result (insignificant positive relationship).</p></blockquote>
<p>That the Stupidest Man Alive fell for the dumbest thing Max has ever seen does not surprise <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2007/07/stupidest-man-a.html">Brad DeLong</a>.  Luskin says the Laffer curve works in “the real world”.  Does he have any clue what the real world actually is?</p>
