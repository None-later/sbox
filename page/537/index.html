                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/28/us/28ballot.html">NYT</a> reports on Question 1 proposing the repeal of the MA state income tax over two years.<br />
<blockquote>That view is exactly what most state and local officials in Massachusetts are afraid of. Amid the whirlwind presidential election, Massachusetts has a ballot contest of its own this November that could drastically alter — some would say cripple — state government.</p>
<p>At issue is Question 1, which would eliminate the state income tax. It would save the average taxpayer about $3,600 a year. Annual revenue from the tax is about $12.5 billion, roughly 45 percent of the state’s budget of about $28 billion.</p>
<p>“These are tough times for everyone as it is, and if Question 1 passes, things will become exponentially more difficult,” said Leslie A. Kirwan, the Massachusetts secretary of administration and finance.</p>
<p>Ms. Kirwan added that because some state programs cannot legally be cut, others would face cuts of 60 percent or more. The loss of billions of dollars from Question 1, she said, would devastate state services.</p>
<p>Gov. Deval Patrick, a Democrat, has called the ballot measure “just a dumb idea.”</p>
<p>And elected leaders across the state are worried.</p>
<p>“The knee-jerk reaction would be, ‘That’s a great idea because it means more money for me,’ ” said Brook Padgett, chairman of the Board of Selectmen in Grafton, a town of about 17,000 near Worcester, which he said would lose 25 percent of its budget because of state cuts. “It would affect everybody — schools, police, municipal services, snow plowing. I couldn’t begin to tell you what we would do.”</p>
<p>Although Massachusetts is still often tagged with its “Taxachusetts” reputation, its recent history is more nuanced.</p>
<p>In 2000, voters approved a phased rollback of the income tax rate from 5.75 percent to 5 percent. The Legislature froze the rate at 5.3 percent in 2002, permitting further reductions only if economic conditions allowed.</p>
<p>In 2002, a ballot measure to scrap the income tax received hardly any public attention. But to the shock of elected officials, it netted 45 percent of the vote statewide and a majority in nearly a third of towns.</p>
<p>Now, with the withering economy, opponents fear that Question 1 will have even more traction.</p>
<p>Health care workers, small-business owners and unions are especially concerned about that prospect. A new group, the Coalition for Our Communities, has raised $1.3 million, about $1 million of that from national teachers’ unions, and plans television advertisements and direct mail campaigns against the repeal.</p>
<p>Karen White, director of campaigns and elections for the National Education Association, which has given $750,000, said the “reckless proposal” would have “dire consequences that will put education at risk, health care at risk, public safety at risk.”</p>
<p>She added: “We’re prepared to commit more money if we need to. We’re going to do what we need to do to make sure that we win this one.”</p>
<p>The pro-repeal effort, which gathered 11,000 signatures to put the measure on the ballot, has much less money — about $25,000 left to spend, disclosure reports show.</p>
<p>“Politicians at the state and local level are overwhelmingly against us,” said Carla Howell, chairwoman of the Committee for Small Government, who ran for governor in 2002. “Everyday voters are much more inclined to end the income tax.”</p>
<p>Question 1 would cut the tax by half the first year and eliminate it the next year, and Ms. Howell said the state could compensate by cutting lucrative employee pensions, paring bureaucracies and spending wisely.</p></blockquote>
<p>Then again a local reader responds to a similar article in another paper:</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.newburyportnews.com/puopinion/local_story_290230816.html?keyword=secondarystory">Mass. income tax vs. N.H. property tax</a><br />To the editor:<br />In reply to the letter by Mike Tyson titled &#8220;Get rid of state income tax&#8221; (Oct. 14). Mr. Tyson asks how &#8220;our neighbors in New Hampshire survived so long without a state income tax?&#8221; Perhaps he should move there to find out. While there is no income tax, he might find a shock with property tax.<br />According to 2006 data from both New Hampshire and Massachusetts, Salisbury had a tax rate of $8.19 per $1,000 valuation. Seabrook, with the power plant as a large payer, had a rate of $12.62. But if he&#8217;d like to move further, we would find that Hampton has a rate of $19.31, HamptonFalls a rate of $19.60, Kensington with a rate of $17.12.<br />I remember talking to a person from Derry, N.H., who bought his house about the same t ime as we bought our house and for about the same amount. At the time (mid-&#8217;90s), he was paying four times as much in property tax as I was — an amount more than what I paid in both state income tax and property tax combined.<br />The bottom line: There is a bottom line and the money will need to come from somewhere.</p></blockquote>

<div>
<blockquote>Financial workers at Wall Street&#8217;s top banks are to receive pay deals worth more than $70bn (£40bn), a substantial proportion of which is expected to be paid in discretionary bonuses, for their work so far this year &#8211; despite plunging the global financial system into its worst crisis since the 1929 stock market crash, the Guardian has learned.</p>
<p>Staff at six banks including Goldman Sachs and Citigroup are in line to pick up the payouts despite being the beneficiaries of a $700bn bail-out from the US government that has already prompted criticism. The government&#8217;s cash has been poured in on the condition that excessive executive pay would be curbed.</p>
<p>Pay plans for bankers have been disclosed in recent corporate statements. Pressure on the US firms to review preparations for annual bonuses increased yesterday when Germany&#8217;s Deutsche Bank said many of its leading traders would join Josef Ackermann, its chief executive, in waiving millions of euros in annual payouts.</p>
<p>The sums that continue to be spent by Wall Street firms on payroll, payoffs and, most controversially, bonuses appear to bear no relation to the losses incurred by investors in the banks. Shares in Citigroup and Goldman Sachs have declined by more than 45% since the start of the year. Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley have fallen by more than 60%. JP MorganChase fell 6.4% and Lehman Brothers has collapsed.</p>
<p>At one point last week the Morgan Stanley $10.7bn pay pot for the year to date was greater than the entire stock market value of the business. In effect, staff, on receiving their remuneration, could club together and buy the bank.</p>
<p>In the first nine months of the year Citigroup, which employs thousands of staff in the UK, accrued $25.9bn for salaries and bonuses, an increase on the previous year of 4%. Earlier this week the bank accepted a $25bn investment by the US government as part of its bail-out plan.</p>
<p>At Goldman Sachs the figure was $11.4bn, Morgan Stanley $10.73bn, JP Morgan $6.53bn and Merrill Lynch $11.7bn. At Merrill, which was on the point of going bust last month before being taken over by Bank of America, the total accrued in the last quarter grew 76% to $3.49bn. At Morgan Stanley, the amount put aside for staff compensation also grew in the last quarter to the end of August by 3% to $3.7bn.</p>
<p>Days before it collapsed into bankruptcy protection a month ago Lehman Brothers revealed $6.12bn of staff pay plans in its corporate filings. These payouts, the bank insisted, were justified despite net revenue collapsing from $14.9bn to a net outgoing of $64m.</p>
<p>None of the banks the Guardian contacted wished to comment on the record about their pay plans. But behind the scenes, one source said: &#8220;For a normal person the salaries are very high and the bonuses seem even higher. But in this world you get a top bonus for top performance, a medium bonus for mediocre performance and a much smaller bonus if you don&#8217;t do so well.&#8221;</p>
<p>Many critics of investment banks have questioned why firms continue to siphon off billions of dollars of bank earnings into bonus pools rather than using the funds to shore up the capital position of the crisis-stricken institutions. One source said: &#8220;That&#8217;s a fair question &#8211; and it may well be that by the end of the year the banks start review the situation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Much of the anger about investment banking bonuses has focused on boardroom executives such as former Lehman boss Dick Fuld, who was paid $485m in salary, bonuses and options between 2000 and 2007.</p>
<p>Last year Merrill Lynch&#8217;s chairman Stan O&#8217;Neal retired after announcing losses of $8bn, taking a final pay deal worth $161m. Citigroup boss Chuck Prince left last year with a $38m in bonuses, shares and options after multibillion-dollar write-downs. In Britain, Bob Diamond, Barclays president, is one of the few investment bankers whose pay is public. Last year he received a salary of £250,000, but his total pay, including bonuses, reached £36m.</p></blockquote>

<p>A <strong>larger than expected decline </strong>in <a href="http://www.livenews.com.au/Articles/2008/09/30/Decline_in_building_approvals_bigger_than_expected">building approvals</a> reflects continued investor caution due to high interest rates, economists say. (Australia, 9/30/08. )</p>
<p>So, what does it say when we read headlines that start with “Larger than expected decline”?   Really.</p>
<p>What world, because it is a world phenomenon as shown with the Australia opening news line, are these people living in such that what they read in the data surprises them?   Should we not be concerned that those who are being relied on to manage our economy have not expected what they are now seeing?   Reading  many articles starting off with that phrase “Larger” or “bigger” or “greater” “than expected decline” does not bode well for all the analysis that has been relied on by the managers (would this include investors?) of our economy.   I mean, I posted here in comments some time ago that my flower shop has been seeing a steady decline since August 1996.   I noted when the first quarter reports for this year came out, based on my flower shop, that we would see some good numbers, but it would only be a burp of pent up desire to spend and should not be considered positive because of the major drop in April and May (usually one of the largest months for flowers).  </p>
<p>Do you remember the commentary on how the rising oil prices would not hurt the economy because it was still “relatively” cheap?   Was the talk that if oil got back down to $70/barrel then we would know the pricing was speculation?   Well?   What, are we not concerned now to know if the oil price rise was speculation or not?   Or is this another “larger than expected decline”?    </p>
<p>Yet, here we are reading commentary that, if we are honest and real, should be giving us great pause as congress formulates policy.   Such commentary of surprise as numbers are reported should be raising questions such as: Are we monitoring relevant data for our purpose?   Are our theories of what is significant regarding our economic intent valid?   Is the data an accurate description of what is happening in our economy?   And, the most basic: Why are we surprised?  Why were our expectations wrong?   Should we be looking for a different school of economic thought than the one that has dominated?   (Some time ago, here in RIland an economist from URI thought that tolls collected for the Newport Bridge was a good indicator for our state economy.   He found that he was correct.)  </p>
<p><strong>Is now the time to broaden the discussion or are we going to wait for more unexpected surprises?</strong></p>

                                <p>By Stormy</p>
<p>Last January, China passed a new contract labor law. Following its passage, the ACFTU (All-China Federation of Trade Unions) has been engaged in a serious membership drive. Because of a slowing world economy, the timing of both could not have been more inopportune. Nonetheless, looking more closely at each will give us some insight into how the Chinese economy is structured and governed.</p>
<p>Both the new law and the push towards more membership seem to be aimed at foreign firms.</p>
<p>Why the new contract law and the drive for more membership?</p>
<p>Between 1995 and 2006, Chinese workers became increasingly restless, resulting in mass demonstrations, wildcat strikes, and protests against super-exploitive foreign firms&#8230;such as Nike. That the new law invited public comment was in itself very unusual. The communist government had to do something; hence the law and the drive.</p>
<p>The Drive for New Membership</p>
<p>According to the <a href="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/bizchina/2008-10/08/content_7085922.htm">China Daily</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
<p>All foreign-funded companies in China will be unionized by the end of next year, an official [Wang Ying]with China&#8217;s top trade union body said Tuesday.</p>
<p>Wang Ying, a division chief of the grassroots organizations and capacity building department of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU), said more than 4,100 major foreign companies run by the Fortune 500 are doing business in China. </p>
<p>Currently, Maersk Logistics, Lotus, IKEA, TNT, Kodak, FedEx, Home Depot, Emerson, Canon, Sony and ABB have trade unions. </p>
<p>&#8220;Most of the foreign companies have been cooperative, as they know they must abide by China&#8217;s laws if they do business in China,&#8221; she said. </p>
<p>She said the ACFTU had also met &#8220;tremendous resistance&#8221; from some foreign firms, especially American companies. </p>
<p>&#8220;Some US companies, such as Wyeth, Microsoft, 3M, AstraZeneca and PwC, have been quite uncooperative and have used various means to delay the establishment of trade unions,&#8221; she said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, according to <a href="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2006-10/14/content_708193.htm">China Daily</a>,<br />
<blockquote>ACFTU Vice-President Xu Deming called on unions to learn from the experience and set up more branches in foreign companies, especially those that rank in the top 500 list.
</p>
<p>Notably, Xu slammed multinationals such as Foxconn, Kodak and Dell for their long time refusal to allow the establishment of trade unions, and called on unionists at all levels to make the establishment of branches at those companies bases in China &#8220;breakthrough goals.&#8221; </p>
<p>Sixty per cent of the more than 150,000 foreign invested companies in the country are expected to have their own trade unions by the end of this year, Xu predicted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Those 150,000 foreign firms parcel work among hundreds of thousands of subcontractors, most of them small indigenous companies. (I do not have to remind anyone that the Fortune 500 has a sizable presence in China; nor should I have to remind anyone that the number of foreign companies is considerable. ) That Xu &#8220;slammed&#8221; foreign firms is no accident.</p>
<p>The New Contract Labor Law</p>
<p>The law is somewhat flawed (does not allow the right to strike, for example). Chinese officials are walking a tightrope here. On the one hand, they had to do something. On the other hand, they had to be careful, lest they drove foreign firms away.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/12/business/worldbusiness/12yuan.html?em">New York Times</a>,<br />
<blockquote>The companies, many of which moved to China to lower manufacturing costs and some to avoid unions in their home countries as well, are now being asked to meet a Sept. 30 deadline to make their offices and factories union shops. </p></blockquote>
<p>(The Koreans were very forthright about being unhappy. Most firms were careful with their pronouncements, lest word get back home. Officialdom everywhere was politely circumspect.) What does the <a href="http://www.abanet.org/labor/annualconference/2007/materials/data/papers/v2/011.pdf">law</a> say? Here are some highlights:<br />
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Consulting with employers about labor rules and regulations regarding wage, hour, break, leave work safety and hygiene, insurance and benefits, training, work discipline, etc </li>
<li>Jointly coordinating with the local labor administration authorities and the employer to resolve any employment issues </li>
<li>Assisting and guiding workers in negotiating their employment contracts </li>
<li>Being advised and consulted with in connection with any mass lay-off </li>
<li>Demanding the employer rectify any legal violations or violations of a worker’s employment contract </li>
<li>Negotiating “collective contracts&#8221;</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I am not sure any of us would want the U.S. government to be our labor union, negotiating contracts with corporate America.</p>
<p>But be that as it may, I welcome the push and the law. Something had to be done. The questions ultimately will be not only a matter of enforcement but also the spirit in which collective contracts are negotiated.</p>
<p>As I have said repeatedly, China offered its vast, impoverished, and unprotected population as the manufacturing export center of the world, combining that offering with tax and environmental inducements.</p>
<p>I love the remark that the director of Tal Apparel made:<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;It&#8217;s quite understandable that Americans are annoyed, upset and fearful, but American production bases will not ever be able to compete with Asia,&#8221; Yip said, with the patience of someone coaching a slow child.
</p>
<p>&#8220;In the United States, you want to milk the cow. You don&#8217;t want to be the cow.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Tal Apparel is associated with such brand names as Nike, Calvin Klein, L.L. Bean, Brooks Brothers, etc. The average age of its seamstresses is 20.)</p>

<p>Greg Mankiw sends us to &#8220;<a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2008/10/whats-so-great-about-small-business.html">Wisdom from Michael Kinsley</a>.&#8221;  Which turns out to be <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2008-10-17/quit-helping-small-business/">this</a>:<br />
<blockquote>There is no need to encourage risk-taking entrepreneurship with special tax breaks. Risk takers will take risks, and if the risks work out they shouldn&#8217;t mind paying the same level of taxes as everyone else. If the risks don&#8217;t work out, they won&#8217;t have to.</p></blockquote>
<p>I agree completely with Kinsley, but am surprised that Mankiw does as well, especially as Kinsley correctly presents the issue in the process of another of his pox-on-Obama&#8217;s-house conclusions:<br />
<blockquote>Obama&#8230;proposes exempting the sale of small businesses from the capital gains tax, allowing small businesses to avoid the burdens his health care plan would place on big businesses, and so on.</p></blockquote>
<p>Michael Kinsley has argued that small businesses should pay capital gains taxes, and that they &#8220;shouldn&#8217;t mind paying the same level of taxes as everyone else.&#8221;  By extension, the preferential rate for capital gains should be eliminated.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s nice to see that Greg Mankiw calls this &#8220;Wisdom.&#8221;</p>

<p>The evil* <a href="http://www.26econ.com/">Aaron Shiff of 26econ.com</a> [edited to clarify that he is not—to my knowledge, at least—the Aaron in Coventry] discovered <a href="http://www.26econ.com/how-did-i-live-without-google/">Google Web History</a>.</p>
<p>Being a natural follower, I checked my own breakdown.  It appears I do a lot of Google searching during the two hours the children are Not Getting Ready for Bed:
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/SPoatm7qVFI/AAAAAAAAAKo/eTD-CUc-JwQ/s1600-h/Hourly+Google+Search+Activity.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/SPoatm7qVFI/AAAAAAAAAKo/eTD-CUc-JwQ/s400/Hourly+Google+Search+Activity.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />I have doubts about their methods (the top Clicks lists, in particular, do not match with what I&#8217;ve been doing in the past two years but seem rather to map my searches to Google&#8217;s search database), but it&#8217;s worth checking out, and will probably produce a thesis or three in the near future.</p>

<div>Yesterday Warren Buffett wrote about stocks now  being a bargain. It lead me to look at a measure of valuation I have  not calculated recently, the S&#038;P 500 PE on trend  EPS. We all know there are problems with the various  measures</div>
<div>of earnings used to calculate valuations and none  of them are perfect.  We could use operating EPS or  reported EPS,</div>
<div>some measure of projected earnings, or different  measures of trailing EPS.  Each has its own advantages  and/or drawbacks. I&#8217;ve used trend earnings to deal with these  problems at different times. It uses a sort of average of both operating and  reported EPS so it avoids the controversies  over which of those two  series to use. It also avoids the problem of basing valuations on  either peak or trough EPS that sometimes creates  distortions.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SPoKH-sVtlI/AAAAAAAAAjQ/RY9Gtjkt7Kk/s1600-h/Clipboard01.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SPoKH-sVtlI/AAAAAAAAAjQ/RY9Gtjkt7Kk/s320/Clipboard01.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a></div>
<div> </div>
<div>At Fridays S&#038;P 500 close of 940.55 the S&#038;P:  PE on trend EPS was 12.0.  This compares to an average  since 1960</div>
<div>of about 16 and is almost exactly where the market  bottomed in the 1970 bear market and after the 1987  crash.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>On this basis Buffett is right that the market is  cheap and looks like a long term buying opportunity. But note that at the 1974 bottom, this PE was 8.0  and it remained below 12 for years, when inflation and rates were  very high.</p>
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>So, you pays your money and takes your  chances.</p>
