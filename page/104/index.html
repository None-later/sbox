                                <p>The frequently brilliant Ashwin Parameswaran makes <a href="http://www.macroresilience.com/2012/06/04/the-case-against-monetary-stimulus-via-asset-purchases/">The Case Against Monetary Stimulus Via Asset Purchases</a>, and Nick Rowe <a href="http://worthwhile.typepad.com/worthwhile_canadian_initi/2012/06/does-monetary-policy-have-bad-distributional-consequences.html">responds</a>. Ashwin <a href="http://www.macroresilience.com/2012/06/07/monetary-policy-targets-and-the-need-for-market-intervention/">replies</a>, analyzing “monetary policy as a threat strategy.”
<p>Nick’s view (in Ashwin’s words):</p>
<blockquote><p>…a credible threat will cause market expectations to adjust and negate the need for any actual intervention in markets by the central bank.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ashwin counters this view [my slight tweaks]:</p>
<blockquote><p>…expectations[-setting] only work[s] when there is a clear and credible set of actions that serve as the bazooka(s) to enforce these expectations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think the key hinge here is the difference between the declarative, conditional, and subjunctive moods: the assumption that the actions <em>would</em> serve as a bazooka, <em>if</em>….</p>
<p>Nick seems to be assuming that the Fed’s promise is always credible — regardless of whether they have ever (or reliably) fired the bazooka in the past (followed up on their promises with OMO/QE actions/balance sheet changes) — because in theory the Fed <em>could</em> fire the bazooka, and (again, in theory) the bazooka <em>would</em> have the desired effect.</p>
<p>The promise <em>would</em> be credible <em>if: </em>1. the Fed has shown willingness to engage in those actions in the past in similar situations — by actually taking those actions — and 2. Those actions had the desired effect.</p>
<p>Nick’s view might make sense if the Fed were playing a one-round game. (They <em>could</em> do it, so market players have to assume that if necessary they can and will do it, and it will work.)</p>
<p>But it’s a repeated/ongoing game. I sed at Nick’s place:</p>
<p>It’s the <em>threat</em> that I will shoot you that causes you to turn over your wallet. Not the actual shooting. (The shooting can have the desired effect, but it’s unnecessary if the threat is credible.)</p>
<p>But you and I both know that I’m going to be stealing your wallet every day for the rest of our lives. If I don’t shoot you today when you refuse to hand it over, the threat won’t be credible tomorrow.</p>
<p>So yeah: the threat generally does the job. But the shooting can also do the job, and periodic actual shooting is necessary for the threat to do the job.</p>
<p>Nick replies:</p>
<blockquote><p>I threaten to go to the North of the herd of cattle, to drive them South. But if my threat is credible, and they head South, I actually follow the cattle south.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To which I replied:</p>
<blockquote><p>But if it’s a repeated game, if you never head north the threat isn’t credible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You have to head north <em>sometimes</em>.</p>
<p>(This is all ignoring the question of whether actual balance-sheet changes even <em>would</em> have the desired effect, which market players seem decidedly uncertain about.)</p>
<p>Max, <a href="http://www.macroresilience.com/2012/06/04/the-case-against-monetary-stimulus-via-asset-purchases/#comment-113969">replying</a> to me in the comments at Ashwin’s, seems to perfectly encapsulate Nick’s (some-variety-of-)monetarist position:</p>
<blockquote><div>Steve, raising the inflation target is an “action”.</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Try this:</p>
<p>The Fed promises to raise inflation or NGDP to X (target or relative-to-trend level), doing whatever is necessary in the future to achieve that target/level. They do nothing else — make no significant changes to their balance sheet.</p>
<p>What they’re saying:</p>
<p>“If we have not achieved that target/level at our meeting six months or two years from now, we promise that we will again promise to do whatever is necessary in the future to achieve that target/level.”</p>
<p>Max: when the Fed promises to make future promises, is that an “action”?</p>
<p>It’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtles_all_the_way_down#Origin">turtles all the way down</a>.</p>
<p>I hereby propose a new acronym to add to the lexicon of Fed and monetarist watchers: TATWD.</p>
<p>Nick takes his thinking to its logical conclusion (as he is quite admirably wont to do). Working with his north/south cattle metaphor, he says:</p>
<blockquote><p>if the conditional threat to buy assets is credible, the central bank would actually sell assets.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the Fed:</p>
<p>“We’re so confident in our ability to boost NGDP that were going to announce our intention to do so, and when we (inevitably) see the lead cow tending south, we’ll start selling in anticipation of our threat working perfectly. The rest of the herd, convinced by our displayed confidence, will turn and follow the leader.”</p>
<p>Does this seem likely?</p>
<p>Or:</p>
<p>“We’ll make our threat, and watch with satisfaction as the whole herd (inevitably) turns south. <em>Then</em> we’ll follow them by selling. We’ll never have to buy.”</p>
<p>As Market Monetarists will be the first to tell you (and as all will I think agree), the Fed is <em>extremely, even excessively reluctant</em> to turn north (more QE). The cattle — market players — know that.</p>
<p>If the Market Monetarists are right, Nick’s (and their) logic has a broken link: the cattle won’t believe the threat to go north because the cattle know that the Fed really, really doesn’t want to go north. (<a href="http://www.economist.com/comment/1449809#comment-1449809">My explanation of why they don’t want to.</a>)</p>
<p>Or, Nick’s logic is just obvious: if the economy gets better (the herd turns south) — for whatever reason(s) — the Fed will tighten by buying assets. No duh.</p>

<blockquote><p>Malcolm Gladwell is the <em>New Yorker’s </em>leading essayist and bestselling author. <em>Time</em> magazine named Gladwell one of the world’s 100 most influential people. His books sell copies in the millions, and he is in hot demand as one of the nation’s top public intellectual and pop gurus. Gladwell plays his role as a disinterested public intellectual like few others, right down to the frizzy hairdo and smock-y getups. His political aloofness, high-brow contrarianism and constant challenges to “popular wisdom” are all part of his shtick. </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>But beneath Malcolm Gladwell’s cleverly-crafted ambiguity, beneath the branded facade, one finds, with surprising ease, a common huckster on the take. I say “surprising ease” because it’s all out there on the public record.</p></blockquote>

<p>Wealthy Non-Taxpayers &#8212; From 60 to Thousands in 30 Years</p>
<p>Bruce Bartlett provides the numbers, but it&#8217;s so much easier to see in a chart.</p>
<div><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-WyShLkF8Ta4/T9CKO32awpI/AAAAAAAAA3k/gs5NFvPS6Fo/s1600/wealthy+non-taxpayers+1977-2009.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="181" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-WyShLkF8Ta4/T9CKO32awpI/AAAAAAAAA3k/gs5NFvPS6Fo/s320/wealthy+non-taxpayers+1977-2009.jpg" width="320"></a></div>
<p>Wealthy Non-Taxpayers 1977 to 2009, showing incomes over $200,000 per year.  Blue is percentage of total households over $200,000 paying no taxes, purple is numbers of high-income households paying no taxes. Numbers from chart here: <a href="http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/05/rich-nontaxpayers/">http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/05/rich-nontaxpayers/</a>, drawn    <br />from IRS data.</p>
<p>On this chart, the percentage appears relatively stable with a low of 0.066 to a high of 0.529 (66 per 100,000 to 529 per 100,000) but actually that’s an eightfold increase, mostly accruing after 2004.<br />The numbers of households, however, leap like a gazelle after 2004, reaching a high of 22,000 high income households paying no taxes, from a low of only 60 in 1977.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>I was just poking around FRED as I do when I can&#8217;t sleep and I discovered something which amazed me (I am often amazed by my ignorance).  Non mortgage delinguency rates are low.  In fact the delinquency rate on credit card loans of all commercial banks is the lowest on record (records only go back to 1991)</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-D4zDKo5vsos/T8_0LXyxXrI/AAAAAAAAAKI/GncAptmqT34/s1600/delinquent.JPG"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-D4zDKo5vsos/T8_0LXyxXrI/AAAAAAAAAKI/GncAptmqT34/s400/delinquent.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>The blue curve shows delinquency rates on credit card loans by commercial banks.  The red line shows the even lower (but not quite lowest ever) delinquency rate on business loans.  If I put delinquency rates for single family home mortgages or all real estate secured loans, the graph would be hard to read as they dwarf the rates I graphed (and are at record highs).</p>
<p>Similarly the volume of total consumer loans of all commercial banks (&#8220;Total Consumer Credit Outstanding (TOTALSL), Monthly, End of Period, Seasonally Adjusted&#8221; again in blue) and of commercial and industrial loans ( &#8220;Commercial And Industrial Loans, All Commercial Banks (ACILACB), Quarterly, Not Seasonally Adjusted&#8221;, again in red) has recovered sharply after the recession.  </p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-6il-oMO1pS4/T8_4tFFZyWI/AAAAAAAAAKY/yygLB0X7sVM/s1600/credit.JPG"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-6il-oMO1pS4/T8_4tFFZyWI/AAAAAAAAAKY/yygLB0X7sVM/s400/credit.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>The decline in commercial and industrial loans was only 1.5 times that of the 2001 recession, the series turned back up sooner and has been increasing more rapidly.  There is no correction for inflation, these graphs are in millions of dollars (the legend is especially pointless because for some reason consumer loans are given in billions by default and I had to change the scale by hand).  </p>
<p>The remaining financial market problem seems to me to be extremely concentrated in financing real estate transactions especially housing.</p>

<p>Variations on &#8220;Only Nixon Can Go to China&#8221;</p>
<p>This is not a short post. Be forewarned. </p>
<p>A few years ago, I co-authored a book called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Presimetrics-Facts-Presidents-Measure-Issues/dp/B005HKSK8M/ref=tmm_hrd_title_0?ie=UTF8&#038;qid=1337806400&#038;sr=1-1">Presimetrics</a> with Michael E. Kanell, a reporter for the Atlanta Journal Constitution. In the book, we tried to take an objective look at how Presidents performed on a wide range of issues &#8211; everything from abortion to the national debt. To achieve that objectivity, we did two things. The first was to always get data from the most objective source we could find. Thus, when looking at the murder rate, we obtained our data from the FBI. The second thing we did to try to maintain objectivity was to treat each series exactly the same way &#8211; looking at how the series changed from right before a President took office to right before he left office. </p>
<p>We got almost no press and the book didn&#8217;t do well &#8211; perhaps in part because we tried so hard to keep our opinions and biases in check. Additionally, the book had plenty in it to anger everyone, regardless of their political persuasion. (Yes, more often than not, the facts have a liberal bias&#8230; but on a few issues near and dear to liberal hearts, they don&#8217;t.)</p>
<p>Still, I learned a lot from working on the book. And while Presimetrics is about facts, I want to talk about something subjective. As the old saw goes, only Nixon can go to China. But there&#8217;s a corollary &#8211; once Nixon goes to China, everyone else can.</p>
<p>And there have been plenty of visits to China in the past few decades. Depending on your political views, you might like some and not others but whatever you might think of them, each of them has created a precedent.</p>
<p>Once the country got used to top marginal rates in the 90 percent range, only an economically liberal President could cut tax rates, particularly since the previous time the country had undergone significant tax cuts (from 75% in 1920 down to 24% in 1929) we had the mother of economic disasters. But once LBJ did cut the top tax rate from 90% to 70%, the door was opened and it took only a few decades for us to reach a point where top rates of 39% are described as socialism.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>The next Democrat in the Oval Office, Jimmy Carter, set other precedents that affect us today &#8211; perhaps the biggest of which was deregulation. Nixon himself visited at least one other China &#8211; there may have been politics behind it, but he created the EPA and made the environment a legitimate issue. The air is cleaner, and rivers aren&#8217;t on fire in Ohio any more as a result of that particular visit to China. </p>
<p>Sometimes going to China only applies to one party. The Republican Party used to be somewhat pacifist, or at least non-interventionist. The leading candidates for the Republican nomination for President in January1940 &#8211; Taft, Vandenberg &#038; Dewey &#8211; were all isolationists. Wilkie, the eventual nominee, was all over the map, but a big part of his campaign was accusing FDR of having a secret plan to get the US into WW2. </p>
<p>The first post-WW2 Republican President, Ike, sent advisers to Vietnam but little more. His military policy seemed to be maintaining the &#8220;status quo&#8221; to the point where he slapped down the British, French, and Israelis over the Suez. Ike also famously warned America of the threat posed by the military-industrial complex. The next Republican President, Nixon, pulled out of the Vietnam War. It wasn&#8217;t until Reagan invaded Grenada that it became kosher for Republicans to militarily intervene in other countries, but since then, Republican Presidents have given us Panama, Gulf War 1, Afghanistan, and Iraq. If the last two had been successful, you could bet American troops would be sitting in military bases in Iran today. <br />Here&#8217;s another single Party visit to China&#8230; after WW2, every single President until Gerald Ford presided over a decrease in the national debt as a share of GDP.</p>
<p>That changed with Ford&#8230; and every single Republican President beginning with Ford increased the national debt as a percentage of GDP. Each and every single one: Ford, Reagan, Bush 1 and Bush 2. A look at Romney&#8217;s economic plan makes it obvious he would fit right in. (If you have any doubts on that point, note that he&#8217;s already signed up both Greg Mankiw and Glenn Hubbard as &#8220;economic advisers&#8221; and then go back and check on their record.)</p>
<p>For a few reasons, increasing the debt wasn&#8217;t a precedent for Democrats &#8211; and both Carter and Clinton paid down debt, but now, with Obama laying a new course (it&#8217;s one thing to increase the debt, it&#8217;s a whole other story when that debt is expanded mostly by bailing out industries that have behaved irresponsibly), perhaps we can expect both parties to act like drunken sailors going forward. </p>
<p>Obama has been visiting other Chinas too. Despite LBJ&#8217;s tax cuts, in recent decades Democrats have concluded that tax cuts might not be good for the economy when tax rates are &#8220;too low.&#8221; (Not an unreasonable assumption &#8211; the top marginal tax rates fell from 75% to 24% between 1920 and 1929, and we all know how that turned out. Most of us also remember the last time top marginal rates dipped below 30%.) Obama has made it clear that he believes that low taxes are good for the economy, and the only reason he might consider raising the top marginal rate is because &#8220;we can&#8217;t afford it.&#8221; </p>
<p>Obama has also perfected a new political technique for Democrats &#8211; the pre-emptive surrender from a position of strength. The fact that he faces an argumentative Congress is not an excuse &#8211; he was doing it even when his own party controlled both houses of Congress! Besides, Clinton had an obstreperous Congress to deal with too, and he generally triangulated his way toward whatever he wanted. </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a China that Obama can go to that Bush 2 wanted to visit but couldn&#8217;t&#8230; &#8220;fixing&#8221; Social Security. Obama has already laid some of the ground work, what with the payroll tax cut as stimulus, the Social Security commission, and some other odd noises coming out of his mouth. Expect more reluctant progress &#8220;fixing&#8221; Social Security from a second Obama term than Romney would manage, despite Romney&#8217;s enthusiasm for that sort thing.</p>
<p>Which leads us to one more extension of the Nixon going to China rule&#8230; a visit to China doesn&#8217;t count if it gets immediately repudiated. The Bush 1 tax hikes were immediately repudiated by Republicans. Reagan almost did just that with the Department of Education (created by Jimmy Carter), but then he appointed the wrong flunky to oversee its destruction. </p>
<p>Obama, on the other hand, seems to have not refuted, but rather continued the new precedents set by GW Bush. Homeland Security, spying on Americans, security theater in airports, economic stimulus geared toward rescuing the worst offenders at whatever cost, refusal to hold anyone accountable for what would normally be considered criminal behavior during the financial meltdown, keeping tax rates low, etc., etc., etc., etc. Other than the low taxes, many of these policies would have been a stretch for Republicans pre-GW, but it is pretty clear that Romney wouldn&#8217;t reverse course on any of them. The Republican Party&#8217;s precedent has been established and confirmed. It won&#8217;t be changing. </p>
<p>On the other hand, in theory, Democrats can still go back to being in favor of balanced budgets, higher taxes, more spending on social issues, and accountability for white collar crime. The Democrats can still go back to favoring policies intended to benefit the little guy. (I note, as per Presimetrics, I note that intention doesn&#8217;t always make something true in reality and some of the recipes Democrats traditionally follow don&#8217;t work, just as some of the recipes Republicans traditionally follow don&#8217;t work.)<br />But these are all approaches that run counter to what Obama has been doing. If Obama&#8217;s policies aren&#8217;t repudiated quickly, they become precedent, carved in stone. From a practical perspective, the trip to China has to be untaken now, or not at all. </p>
<p>My conclusion from all of this is a very contrarian one: if you voted for Obama in 2008, you will be best-served voting against him in 2012. On the other hand, if you voted against Obama in 2008, you will be best-served voting for him 2012. And yes, I&#8217;m serious, though I don&#8217;t expect too many people to believe me. <br />&#8212;<br />This post was written in response to <a href = "./<a href=/index.html">this</a>.</p>

                                <p>Ah well&#8230;a whole generation of readers will mourn his passing. From an AP alert: </p>
<blockquote><p>Ray Bradbury, Master of Science Fiction, Dies at 91, A.P. Says</p>
<p>Ray Bradbury, a master of science fiction whose lyrical evocations of the future reflected both the optimism and the anxieties of his own postwar America, died on Tuesday in Southern California. He was 91.</p>
<p>By many estimations Mr. Bradbury was the writer most responsible for bringing modern science fiction into the literary mainstream. His name would appear near the top of any list of major science-fiction writers of the 20th century, beside those of Isaac Asimov, Arthur C. Clarke, Robert A. Heinlein and the Polish author Stanislaw Lem.</p>
<p>In Mr. Bradbury’s lifetime more than eight million copies of his books were sold in 36 languages. They included the short-story collections “The Martian Chronicles,” “The Illustrated Man” and “The Golden Apples of the Sun,” and the novels “Fahrenheit 451” and “Something Wicked This Way Comes.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Update:   Courtesy of reader rjs comes two notes on the power of fiction and culture:</p>
<p>Alyssa Rosenberg at <i>Think Progress</i> writes in general on fiction, and in particular the novel <i>Foundation</i> by   Isaac Asimov and its influence on Paul Krugman (who is also an economist):<br />
<blockquote>One of the things that irritates me most is people — progressives in particular, because conservatives tend to be more vigilant on this score — who dismiss culture as if it’s unimportant, or as if people aren’t influenced by it. And my favorite counterargument of the moment comes from Paul Krugman, <a href="http://www.wired.com/underwire/2012/05/paul-krugman-geeks-guide-galaxy/all/1">who went into economics</a> because he wanted to be Hari Seldon when he grew up&#8230;&#8230; (more below the fold)</p></blockquote>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />
<blockquote>Fiction is about defining the outer limits of possibility: you show a kid a world where economists can shape the fate of humanity, and he’ll embrace realistic possibilities for social science he might never have been attracted to in the first place. Show girls superheroines and master archers as well as princesses and maybe some activity will catch a spark. I sometimes write that a movie or television show feels surprising because I didn’t think it was something that could exist. What really ends excites me about those pieces of art is that they’re times when popular entertainment is matching what’s truly possible in the world, and occasionally exceeding it. It’s artistically and societally depressing when media rooted in imagination turns out images and societies that are vastly more crabbed than our world actually is.</p></blockquote>

<p>America is an Opportunity Society (Rep Paul Ryan WI)</p>
<p>“<i>I’m personally offended that they’re playing a high-stakes game of chicken with our national defense</i>,” fumed Weston Newton, chairman of the Beaufort County Council, after hearing Senator Graham’s dire warnings. . <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/47669971/ns/politics-the_new_york_times/" target="_blank">Lawmakers look for way out as defense cuts near</a>.</p>
<p>After agreeing to automatic cuts if a resolution to the deficit could not be agreed upon in the budgeting process, some members of the Senate now what a redo. Senator Graham goes to great lengths to stir the guns and/or butter pot of fear.</p>
<blockquote><p>· <i>The law exempts war costs and allows the administration to wall off personnel levels and military pay, about a third of the Pentagon budget. That means everything else — operations and maintenance, research and development, procurement, fuel, military construction — would face immediate cuts as deep as 13 percent,&#8221;</i> Mr. Harrison said.<br />· <i>&#8220;&#8216;</i>Our <i>ability to modernize will be basically gutted,&#8217; Senator Graham told National Guard officers in Greenville. &#8216;The Marine Corps will have to choose between its giant training camps in San Diego or Parris Island, he told community leaders in Beaufort, a stone’s throw from Parris Island.&#8221;</i><br />· &#8220;<i>&#8216;The C-17 fleet at Joint Base Charleston would be &#8216;devastated,&#8217; Senator Graham warned city leaders at the Charleston Chamber of Commerce. The cuts to the soldiers and airmen at Shaw Air Force Base would leave behind a &#8216;hollow force,&#8217; he intoned in a windowless room at the Quality Inn in Sumter.'&#8221;</i> </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>During the month of May, a House majority voted to shift the automatic cuts for Defense (resulting from the failure to approve a budget) to cuts of Domestic programs. The National Defense Authorization Act passed the House 218 to 199 in Reconciliation with Wisconsin Representative Paul Ryan (strictly a guns guy) sponsoring cuts in Medicaid ($50 billion), food programs for the poor ($36 billion), federal retirement funds ($80 billion), and capping malpractice lawsuits to save $49 billion. The Act also proposes to increase Defense spending $8 billion (enough to fix 40,000 $200,000 flawed mortgages</p></blockquote>

<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>While sequestered an agreement was not reached by the handpicked members of Congress who would never reach an agreement in a decade, the Budget Control Act with its default cuts now adds another $500 billion in cuts (over the next decade) on top of the agreed upon $487 billion in Defense spending cuts agreed to last Summer. In a &#8220;<i>Quelle Surprise</i>&#8221; moment, the DEMs appear to be showing some backbone and the Republicans are finding the Dems are serious about the burden of program cuts falling equally over all programs. </p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;<i>We will sit and stagnate with banks and use rockets, To oversee that it&#8217;s our bottom line that gets carried to the high seas.&#8221; </i>Shikari. Norquist would be proud of these pseudo budget cutters.<br />Falling back on the rhetoric of a built-in culture of dependency, Ryan fights back on the proposed cuts in domestic programs; &#8220;<i>Here&#8217;s the problem: These efforts aren&#8217;t working. One in six Americans today are in poverty</i>, <i>let&#8217;s get back to the idea of America as an opportunity society.&#8221; </i>It is not the two recessions in a decade, the cutting of jobs or globalization at issue, or the stagnation of income, which has led to an increasing portion of the Non-Institutional Civilian Population to reside in Not In Labor Force nor is it reductions in tax revenue; it is a culture of dependency as created by domestic programs. Another &#8220;<i>Quelle Surprise</i>&#8220;</p></blockquote>
<p>moment in politics! Moreover, if we cut food and healthcare we can force them to work. When did healthcare become that cheap and affordable while earning a minimum wage? Which do you do, cast the bones of the future, gamble with your health, and forgo healthcare to buy food or the alternative is to diet? Investing more money in the military, expanding our military presence, and cutting domestic programs; Rep. Paul Ryan believes will solve the economic problem much of the population faces today. </p>
<p>Maybe in the past, the US in its early product life cycle of growth had the resource and the potential to expand the military and invest in the domestic economy; but today, the resources are limited and continuing to invest so heavily in the military could result in an erosion of global economic position. In &#8220;<i>The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers</i>;&#8221; Paul Kennedy examines the growth of Defense (guns),<br /><a href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/-TyZcQk4kveg/T86__wwmNDI/AAAAAAAAA3A/lEogAUpNDlY/s1600-h/clip_image001%25255B3%25255D.gif"><img alt="clip_image001" border="0" height="59" hspace="12" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/-v03Wx7qxpno/T87AAc6vy_I/AAAAAAAAA3I/iTvmWuv1Gds/clip_image001_thumb.gif?imgmax=800" title="clip_image001" width="233"></a><a href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/-4ih_qZU4AGk/T87AA_mzqiI/AAAAAAAAA3Q/Ztta36rsniU/s1600-h/clip_image003%25255B3%25255D.jpg"><img alt="clip_image003" border="0" height="244" hspace="12" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/-AEWnM2RBdno/T87ACFepajI/AAAAAAAAA3Y/v0uSnKwmj68/clip_image003_thumb.jpg?imgmax=800" title="clip_image003" width="224">Rise and Fall</a></p>
<p>armaments, global commitments, etc. without an increasing and sustaining Domestic economy and Economic Investment (butter) concluding it has been a greater contributor to a nation&#8217;s demise as a world power and relegated to second or third tier status. Kennedy does so by reviewing the nations, which have been world powers since the 16th Century and compares those former world powers and circumstance in the end with the US. He analyzes the ability to engage in conflict(s) sustained or otherwise and increased military expenditures without adequate or increasing resource of energy, other natural resource, and domestic productivity. The US with a faltering economy, an unproductive large labor pool, and an emphasis on financial and Wall Street gambling may be no longer able to sustain the military and the military complex it has today. </p>
<blockquote><p>As Paul Kennedy suggests a continuation of such policy could &#8220;<i>lead to the downward spiral of slower growth, heavier taxes, deepening domestic splits over spending priorities, and weakening capacity to bear the burdens of defense</i></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><i> </i>Hmmmmm, does it sound familar?<i> </i>and adds<i>:</i></p></blockquote>
<p><i></i><br />
<blockquote><i>The task facing American statesmen over the next decades, therefore, is to recognize that broad trends are under way, and that there is a need to “manage” affairs so that the relative erosion of the United States’ position takes place slowly and smoothly, and is not accelerated by policies which bring merely short-term advantage but longer-term disadvantage.</i> <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Rise-and-Fall-of-the-Great-Powers/105706569463774#!/pages/" target="_blank">The-Rise-and-Fall-of-the-Great-Powers</a></p></blockquote>
<p>It may be time to rethink our present stance on military expenditures and focus on domestic investments which will revitalize the country and bring more of those people Paul Ryan targets back into the Civilian Work Force. When the automatic cuts go into play; they will not go realign military policy favoring domestic policy; but, the Paul Ryan&#8217;s of Congress would go a long way towards providing the &#8220;Opportunity Society&#8221; he is calling for by doing so. It is an opportunity much of Congress seems to be blind too in their quest to unseat Obama and follow the pledges to Norquist.</p>

                                <p>John Sides at The Monkey Cage makes what seems to be <a href="http://themonkeycage.org/blog/2012/06/04/independents-are-mostly-partisans-chapter-gazillion/">an incredibly important point</a>, at least for politico types. In the latest Pew report (<a href="http://www.people-press.org/files/legacy-pdf/06-04-12%20Values%20Release.pdf">PDF</a>) that everyone’s nattering about, we see a big rise in “independent” voters over the last decade (to 38%).
<p>But:</p>
<blockquote><p>only 12% of respondents did not identify with or lean toward a party</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And if you look at the leaners, they’re just as partisan as the fully-declared party supporters:</p>
<p><img title="leaners" src="http://themonkeycage.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/pewleaners.png" alt="" width="361" height="684"></p>
<p>So pretty much everyone who’s paying attention has taken sides.</p>
<p>Do with that what you will.</p>

<p>BEA just published the state real GDP data for 2011.  Since I have not done it in a while I thought it would be interesting to create the state real GDP per capita data for 2011.  There has not been much difference since the last time I did this exercise several years ago.  The last time I did  it Massachusetts<br />was 126% of the national average and Mississippi was 63% of the national average.  The long run trend of the poorest state tending to catch up with the wealthiest states has continued in force. Now, Massachusetts real per capita GDP  is only 187% of that in Mississippi vs the 200% it was several years ago..  But I can still point out that the Republican and/or right wingers continue to try to convince us that  that we would all be better off if we were more like Mississippi and less like Massachusetts.  Go figure.</p>
