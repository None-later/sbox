<p>For your reading and commenting pleasure. I would only note that much of the change between the CBO January baseline and today is just the result of scoring the intervening legislation and not due to any unexpected economic changes. But in any case here it is.</p>
<p>Update: here is a link to the Director&#8217;s Blog page announcing the report release (with excerpt)<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://cboblog.cbo.gov/?p=216">Preliminary Analysis of the President’s Budget</a><br />
<blockquote>Our current assessment of economic developments indicates that:<br />Although the economy is likely to continue to deteriorate for some time, the enactment of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act and very aggressive actions by the Federal Reserve and the Treasury are projected to help end the recession in the fall of 2009. In CBO’s forecast, on a fourth-quarter-to-fourth-quarter basis, real (inflation-adjusted) GDP falls by 1.5 percent in 2009 before growing by 4.1 percent in both 2010 and  2011.</p>
<p>For the next two years, CBO anticipates that economic output will average about 7 percent below its potential—the output that would be produced if the economy’s resources were fully employed. That shortfall is comparable with the one that occurred during the recession of 1981 and 1982 and will persist for significantly longer—making the current recession the most severe since World War II. In this forecast, the unemployment rate peaks at 9.4 percent in late 2009 and early 2010 and remains above 7.0 percent through the end of 2011. With a large and sustained output gap, inflation is expected to be very low during the next several years.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>As he presented his revised 2009 budget to parliament, Finance Minister Tendai Biti noted that &#8220;indirect taxes made up of customs and excise duty have contributed 88 percent of government revenue, which means that the government has been literally sustained by beer and cigarettes.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

                                <p>By Spencer,</p>
<p>Did you know that over the last six months the compound growth of the total CPI was -5.0%. Of course that is up from January when it was &#8211; 5.8%.</p>
<p>You have to go back to 1948 to find actual deflation like this,  when it bottomed at  -4.2%..</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/ScP1zwKSY_I/AAAAAAAAAts/l6xDnptIWuA/s1600-h/Clipboard03.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/ScP1zwKSY_I/AAAAAAAAAts/l6xDnptIWuA/s320/Clipboard03.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a><br />Of course much of the deflation  was due to the plunge in oil prices from almost $150.</p>
<p>But even if you exclude energy the six month change in the CPI excluding energy was only 1.2%, the lowest rate since 1964.</p>
<p>I wonder how many of those claiming that Fed policy will cause inflation are even aware that we are now suffering deflation are near deflation.</p>

<p>Those who ignore history are bound to repeat it. The otherwise estimable Ezra falls into the trap.<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/ezraklein_archive?month=03&#038;year=2009&#038;base_name=bipartisan_policy_making&#038;6">Bipartisan Policy Making</a> Hertzberg is wrong at so many levels and so many points that you hardly know where to start. I have bolded some of the really wrong-headed claims.<br />
<blockquote>Rick Hertzberg notices some Republicans calling for a payroll tax cut amidst the stimulus and proclaims it a Good Idea. It is a good idea! And I like the endgame, too:<br />
<blockquote>Liberals have been reticent, too. The payroll tax now provides a third of federal revenues. And, because it nominally funds Social Security and Medicare, some liberals regard its continuance as essential to the survival of those programs. That’s almost certainly wrong. Public pensions and medical care for the aged have become fixed, integral parts of American life. Their political support no longer depends on analogizing them to private insurance. Besides, the aging of the population, the collapse of defined-benefit private pensions, the volatility of 401(k)s, and pricey advances in medical technology mean that, no matter what efficiencies may be achieved, Social Security and Medicare will—and should—grow. Holding them hostage to ever-rising, job-killing payroll taxes is perverse.</p>
<p>If the economic crisis necessitates a second stimulus—and it probably will—then a payroll-tax holiday deserves a look. But it’s only half a good idea. A whole good idea would be to make a payroll-tax holiday the first step in an orderly transition to scrapping the payroll tax altogether and replacing the lost revenue with a package of levies on things that, unlike jobs, we want less rather than more of—things like pollution, carbon emissions, oil imports, inefficient use of energy and natural resources, and excessive consumption. The net tax burden on the economy would be unchanged, but the shift in relative price signals would nudge investment from resource-intensive enterprises toward labor-intensive ones. This wouldn’t be just a tax adjustment. It would be an environmental program, an anti-global-warming program, a youth-employment (and anti-crime) program, and an energy program.</p></blockquote>
<p>If we had a serious public sphere in which legislators actually wanted to solve problems and were genuinely committed to the public policy ideas they claim to support rather than the industries that fund their reelection, this is the sort of discussion we&#8217;d see.</p></blockquote>
<p>Just shoot me now. Or follow me below the fold while I explain why this is just wrong, wrong, wrong and worse muddle-headed.</p>
<p>Since Alf Landon and the presidential campaign of 1936 the Republican Party has always had the destruction of Social Security as close to openly at the center of their policy goals as they have dared to make it. And after 1965 that has been true of Medicare as well. Because the programs has been very politically popular they have rarely dared to make an open assault on either. That is why Newt had to backtrack on his &#8220;Wither on the vine&#8221; comment and lamely claim he was not talking about Medicare itself but only HCFA. His proposal which disguised real cuts to Medicare (after calculating in medical inflation and growing numbers of covered beneficiaries) by nominal increases in dollars spent was a clear attempt to cripple Medicare over time until it was weak enough to drown in Grover Norquist&#8217;s bathtub. This is what he intended and every observant people knew it, yet he got away with claiming that those nominal increases not only were not real cuts but that people who claimed different were simple liars (something the MSM accepted like gospel.)</p>
<p>And that is why Bush&#8217;s attempt to privatize Social Security ultimately fell apart. His attempts to sell it based on &#8220;Ownership society&#8221; and &#8220;Private control&#8221; and &#8220;Inheritability&#8221; for lower income workers didn&#8217;t hold up to examination. The semi-official Posen plan (floated but never explicitly endorsed) with its clawback and annuitization provisions was a crappy deal for workers, once you ran the numbers, something those in on the game on both sides knew from the beginning. I want to repeat a quote from Dean Baker&#8217;s Phony Crisis that I have put up before:<br />
<blockquote>We have a chance, said President Clinton, to “fix the roof while the sun is still shining.” He was talking about dealing with Social Security immediately, while the economy is growing and the federal budget is balanced. &#8211; &#8211; &#8211;</p>
<p>The roof analogy is illuminating, but we can make it more accurate. Imagine that it’s not going to rain for more than 30 years. And the rain, when it does arrive (and it might not), will be pretty light. And imagine that the average household will have a lot more income for roof repair by the time the rain approaches.</p>
<p>Now add this: most of the people who say they want to fix the roof actually want to knock holes in it.</p>
<p>This is the situation facing Social Security, and it is well known to those who have looked at the numbers.</p></blockquote>
<p> Moral: beware of Republicans bearing hammers. </p>
<p>Just as conservatives say about conservatism, Social Security can not fail, it can only be failed. And felled. And killed. If the Republicans can find a chink in its armor they will strike. Social Security&#8217;s historical defense has been the wall between FICA payroll tax and the General Fund. Certainly there is a gate in that wall that allows money to flow through in controlled fashion, but the key is control, you don&#8217;t want people willy-nilly busting holes in Social Security&#8217;s perimeter wall.</p>
<p>Even with the current barrier in place and Social Security safely supplied until 2041 or 2049 Republicans and Blue Dogs are arguing that we have no choice but to cut benefits by changing initial benefits from being adjusted for real wage to being adjusted for prices. Because in their world view there is no wall at all between the Trust Funds and the General Fund or for that matter between the Trust Funds themselves. They don&#8217;t see an OASI and a DI and a HI, no they see some OASDIHISSISMIPartBPartD monster. And one they want to kill. The notion that there is no danger to Social Security because Newt and Bush over-reached is dangerous nonsense, Hertzberg&#8217;s claim that &#8220;public pensions and medical care&#8221; no longer need the political protection afforded by the wall that keeps them positioned as insurance simply flies in the face of the 74 year history of periodic efforts to kill Social Security.</p>
<p>In these matters the Republican Party relies on two standard rhetorical moves. One they divide all government spending into two categories: money we can&#8217;t NOT afford, which includes pretty much anything military, and money we CAN&#8217;T afford, which is just about everything else. (It is why they can&#8217;t be concerned by weapons programs that continue to go billions of dollars over budget, because gosh those F-22s might be vital one day, but get all indignant at proposals to put $50 million towards the Arts or $1 million towards cricket control.) And two they insist that &#8220;temporary&#8221; tax cuts are actually in practice permanent and that allowing them to lapse is just a huge tax increase. We see this daily in their response to the prospect of Republican supported tax sunsets actually being allowed to occur on the schedule they themselves set. Anyone who doesn&#8217;t think that same logic won&#8217;t be applied to a &#8220;temporary&#8221; payroll tax holiday is in my view delusional.</p>
<p>Once Republicans are allowed to blow even the smallest hole through the payroll tax wall they will certainly point to decaying figures for TF solvency as &#8216;proof&#8217; that the Republican and Blue Dog plan for bleeding Social Security dry over time is just something we will have to do, because you can bet that Social Security will &#8216;regretfully&#8217; be placed in the category of &#8216;spending we CAN&#8217;T afford&#8217;. Because there will never come a time when lifting that &#8216;temporary payroll tax holiday&#8217; will not be presented as a job killer and a huge regressive tax on lower income workers. That kind of bait and switch is what they do.</p>
<p>Klein and Hertzberg are implicitly claiming they can outplay the Republicans here. As if these guys hadn&#8217;t been playing and planning this game for decades before these kids were born. And all with the naive belief that the answer to everything is to tax stuff you don&#8217;t like: &#8220;things like pollution, carbon emissions, oil imports, inefficient use of energy and natural resources, and excessive consumption&#8221;. Yep and you can pay for the whole thing simply by a combination of lifting payroll tax and rebates to lower income workers. All without any risk to the programs heretofore financed by that walled off revenue.</p>
<p>Given the historical record of Republican hostility to the establishment and continuation of Social Security and Medicare and indeed anything that smacks of Social Democracy (say things like paid FMLA) it is just a horribly risky gamble to tinker with the carefully constructed wall that is FICA as currently configured. (For example the payroll cap is an important buttress to that wall, it keeps an important and immensely influential population segment willing to support the wall as opposed to tearing it down.)</p>
<p>As currently configured Social Security fundamentally owes nothing to the people who control capital because to date it has drawn nothing from them. (At worst it required them to pay down the TF in the early sixties and the seventies, in effect repaying money borrowed in earlier decades.) Breaking down that wall or just punching holes in it in effect turns over part of the defense over to the people who historically have been intent on leveling the entire Social Security city. It is called a Trojan Horse, and those bearing this particular &#8216;gift&#8217; should not be assumed to be acting in good faith. Not given the historical record.</p>
<p>The tendency of these post-Reagan liberal market and consumption tax loving fan-boys to think they are smarter than FDR is dangerous. The people who designed Social Security knew what they were doing and things like financing it entirely through wages and keeping contributions capped are important features and not just bugs to be swatted away.</p>
<p>Revised moral: Beware of twenty-something liberals bearing fly-swatters before they enable the Republican/Blue Dog hammer bearers. The roof isn&#8217;t perfect, but it keeps the rain out. And that is not a bug.</p>

<p>Wasting the Plenty</p>
<p>Via <a href="http://www.eschatonblog.com/2009/03/uh-they-werent-paying-those-premiums.html">Atrios</a>, <a href="http://www.boston..com/news/nation/washington/articles/2009/03/11/now_needy_fdic_collected_little_in_premiums/?page=full?ref=fp1">this piece of bad news</a> from Michael Kranish at the Boston Globe:</p>
<blockquote><p>The federal agency that insures bank deposits, which is asking for emergency powers to borrow up to $500 billion to take over failed banks, is facing a potential major shortfall in part because it collected no insurance premiums from most banks from 1996 to 2006.</p>
<p>The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which insures deposits up to $250,000, tried for years to get congressional authority to collect the premiums in case of a looming crisis. But Congress believed that the fund was so well-capitalized &#8211; and that bank failures were so infrequent &#8211; that there was no need to collect the premiums for a decade, according to banking officials and analysts.</p></blockquote>
<p>The folks who happened to be running Congress during those years believed (and still believe, even if they aren&#8217;t running Congress any more) that cutting taxes leads to more tax revenue coming in.  Perhaps they also figured collecting less premiums would lead to more money in the FDIC&#8217;s pot?</p>
<p>The article goes on:</p>
<blockquote><p>Last week, FDIC chairwoman Sheila Bair wrote to Senate Banking Committee chairman Christopher Dodd, a Connecticut Democrat, that her agency could need more money because the existing fund &#8220;provides a thin margin of error&#8221; given the government&#8217;s responsibility &#8220;to cover unforeseen losses.&#8221; The March 5 letter, provided to the Globe, said the additional borrowing authority is necessary to &#8220;leave no doubt&#8221; that the FDIC can &#8220;fulfill the government&#8217;s commitment to protect insured depositors against loss.&#8221;<br />Bair said yesterday that the agency&#8217;s failure to collect premiums from most banks &#8220;was surprising to me and of concern.&#8221; As a Treasury Department official in 2001, she said, she testified on Capitol Hill about the need to impose the fees, but nothing happened. Congress did not grant the authority for the fees until 2006, just weeks before Bair took over the FDIC. She then used that authority to impose the fees over the objections of some within the banking industry.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is five years of very healthy good times in banking that could have been used to build up the reserve,&#8221; Bair, a former professor at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, said in an interview. &#8220;That is how we find ourselves where we are today. An important lesson going forward is we need to be building up these funds in good times so you can draw down upon them in bad times.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Truly, the Republican Congress took the teachings of St. Ronald to heart.<br />_________________________________<br />by cactus</p>

<p>Greenspan Protesteth Too Much <br />Raymond L. Richman</p>
<p>Alan Greenspan in his op-ed in the Wall Street Journal 3-11-09 entitled “The Fed Didn’t Cause the Housing Bubble” denies that the “easy money” policies of the Federal Reserve produced the U.S. housing bubble “that is at the core of today’s financial mess.” Instead, he argues, “The second, and far more credible, explanation agrees that it was indeed lower interest rates that spawned the speculative euphoria.” but the presumptive cause was the world wide decline in long-term interest rates, “the tectonic shift in the early 1990s by much of the developing world from heavy emphasis on central planning to increasingly dynamic, export-led market competition . . a surge in growth in China and a large number of other emerging market economies that led to an excess of global intended savings relative to intended capital investment … which propelled global long-term interest rates progressively lower between early 2000 and 2005.” There you are, the real estate bubble was the result of the play of free market forces and the U.S. Federal Reserve System was an innocent bystander. If you believe that, we have a bridge for you! </p>
<p>If the reader has read our book, Trading Away Our Future, he knows that Japan pursued an export-based strategy of developing herself at the expense of the American worker since the early 1950s under the aegis of its Ministry of Trade which used every dirty trick to limit imports and subsidize exports. Lee Iacocca describes his visit to Japan in the 1980s in which he protested the existing tariff on American automobiles. Japanese cars are better which is why the Japanese don’t buy American autos, he was told. If so, why did Japan need a tariff?</p>
<p>China modeled her development strategy after Japan. To our everlasting shame, we permitted both China and Japan, and other countries, to pursue this development strategy which should be called by its right name dollar mercantilism. When trade is in balance, the workers of all trading partners benefit. Balanced trade is like barter; each partner gives up a bundle of goods it can produce more cheaply for a bundle of goods more costly to produce. When countries maintain by artificial means a favorable balance of trade, they cause the loss of jobs in their trading partners. The chronic trade deficits have cost the jobs of over 7 million American industrial workers. (That is how many workers, more or less, that it would take to produce $700 billion worth of goods and bring trade into balance.)</p>
<p>Mr. Greenspan is enthusiastic about international trade. “Global market competition and integration in goods, services and finance have brought unprecedented gains in material well being.” He does not mention the trade deficits even once. The flow of savings to the U.S. “was a measure of our financial systems precrisis success.” Indeed, many called the flow of funds to the U.S. an example of the confidence foreigners had in our economy (or, perhaps, in their ability to take jobs from American workers with impunity).</p>
<p>Mr. Greenspan speaks in Keynesianese, using phrases made famous by Keynesians like “intended savings” and “intended investment”. China (and Japan) never intended to spend their savings on real capital from the U.S., trucks, tractors, factory and road-building equipment, etc. They deliberately invested their trade surpluses in financial assets like U.S. government bonds and later private securities which kept interest rates low and encouraged American consumers to keep importing. And, yes, to buy houses and finance the housing bubble!</p>
<p>What was the responsibility of the Federal Reserve System and why does Mr. Greenspan escape into technical jargon? The Fed is responsible for the money supply – not too hot, not too cold, just right. With foreign savings flooding the U.S. because our trade was seriously unbalanced, it had at least two options. First, it could restrict the inflow of foreign savings, or, second, urge Congress and Administration to ensure balanced trade. Warren Buffet proposed restricting imports to the amount we imported. Or, quick and simple, impose protective tariffs on all imports emanating from countries with which we are experiencing sizable chronic trade deficits.</p>
<p>Mr. Greenspan, indicates why he chose to do nothing about the damage the trade deficits were causing the American economy and the American worker. He makes no apology for being a free trader just as nearly all economists make no apology for being free traders. Is free trade an economic concept? Not really. It is an ideal toward which economists believe we should all subscribe. It is an ideology. </p>
<p>Do the Japanese and China, and OPEC believe in free trade? Maybe they, too, believe it as an ideal, but nothing in their trade practices shows that they believe it at all. Why should free trade be treated as though it actually exists? There is not a single example in any international trade textbook that shows the benefits of unilateral free trade. In every example that shows both parties benefiting from trade, trade is in balance at equilibrium.</p>
<p>Under the rules of the World Trade Organization, every country was admitted leaving in place all kinds of barriers to imports and subsidies to exports. There was no pretense at free trade, only an encouragement to reduce trade barriers. </p>
<p>Moreover, we have had experiences with the negative aspects of international flows of funds. In the late 90s, the flow of funds to the Asian Tigers bankrupted all of them. Now they all have barriers to financial flows. Perhaps Mr. Greenspan thought it could not happen to us; after all their debt was payable in dollars and the Fed can print as much as it wants. </p>
<p>Now we do not want to give the impression that our trading partners caused the severity of our current crisis. The defaulting subprime mortgages created a world-wide financial crisis and those were made right here in the United States. Indeed, numerous economists studied them and reported they posed no greater risk than “normal” loans. Indeed, they did not until they defaulted en masse and it is not over yet. Perhaps economists never learn (except us!). Elizabeth Duke, a member of the Board of Governors of the Fed, is still enthusiastic about the Community Reinvestment Act that started the no-prime fad. And Larry Summers, Pres. Obama’s chief economist, has never mentioned the trade deficits. They are likewise no problem to most economists, just to workers. </p>

<p>The bill passed by the House of Representatives which imposes a 90% tax on bonuses paid to people who earn over 250,000/year by firms which received TARP funds <a href="http://blogs.tnr.com/tnr/blogs/the_stash/archive/2009/03/19/house-passes-bonus-tax-hair-on-my-neck-stands-up.aspx">makes the hair on Noam Scheibers neck stand up.</a><br />He writes </p>
<blockquote><p>As for the consequences we can&#8217;t foresee, most of them relate to the precedent of taxing income retroactively, which seems to introduce a level of arbitrariness that can&#8217;t be good for economic growth. </p>
<p>My only hope is that there&#8217;s a hidden genius at work here&#8211;a kind of unintentional good cop/bad cop routine. That is, maybe the House&#8217;s efforts will get the AIG derivatives-meisters to cough up their bonuses, which will appease the public a bit and make the new law moot. </p></blockquote>

<p>I prefer an analogy based on the other side, not the problem of the cops who want to make suspects talk but the problem of the suspects who don&#8217;t want the other guy to squeal, that is, the prisoners dilemma.  After the jump I explain why I think the current situation is a prisoners dilemma.  Here I just note that calmly thinking of the future is not optimal behavior if one is in a prisoner&#8217;s dilemma, a reputation for vindictiveness is very useful in this case.  Thus my view of the long run effects of the event is very much the opposite of Scheiber&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Before the jump, I&#8217;d like to thank Wallace Gromit whose comments on <a href="http://www.haloscan.com/comments/angrybear/8806602307272905952/">an earlier post </a>mostly stimulated my thought.  Sad to say, I don&#8217;t know how to link to a comment (search the page for Wallace or Gromit) so I link to Scheiber&#8217;s somewhat inferior expression of the position.  After the jump I basically expand on this discussion</p>
<p>update:  After writing the post (honest) I read a comment by Wallace Gomit which perfectly expresses the view which I contest.  I quote from comments.</p>
<blockquote><p>me: I wonder why you think acting in anger would be counterproductive.  I think that in this case it will be very useful. [snip]  </p>
<p>Wallace Gomit: The reason that I think that acting in anger could be counterproductive is that I think the way that congress and the media is approaching this situation is 100% reactive.  Nobody is thinking through the consequences of their actions.  Due process is out the window. [snip]</p></blockquote>
<p>At first, I will focus only on the long run incentive effects of the tax including effects via expectations of future actions by Congress.  Only at the end will I argue that such a pragmatic approach to the issue is reasonable as there are no questions of constitutionality or human rights involved.</p>
<p>Scheiber reflexively makes an argument which is often very valid and the key to reasonable tax policy &#8220;which seems to introduce a level of arbitrariness that can&#8217;t be good for economic growth.&#8221;  Indeed.  After people have invested in any way, it would often increase average welfare to take the product of their efforts.  The problem is that people in the future would expect the products of their efforts to be taken and this would be a disaster.  Basically, ex poste we want to take from the rich, but doing so is breaking an implicit promise which is key to economic growth &#8212; thus it is like finking in a prisoners dilemma.</p>
<p>Similarly AIG managers had a choice between their interests and the public interests.  They could gamble under heads I win, tails I win too because having damanged the financial system I can threaten to damage it more unless I am given public money.  Or they could avoid such gambles.  They chose to gamble and hurt humanity a lot.  Thus, they have, in effect, finked in a prisoners dilemma.</p>
<p>The good outcome is bankers avoid bankruptcy even though they will have to bear little (or none) of the costs and we tax them at a reasonable rate and especially don&#8217;t change the tax code for a year in the middle of that year.</p>
<p>My view is that they finked and now Congress is finking back.</p>
<p>In a sense the rational thing is to let bygones be bygones and look to the future in which the money is tiny compared to the cost of the bailout and not worth the bother (this is not at all Scheiber&#8217;s argument).  The sense is that this would be a Nash equilibrium stategy in a supergame.  The folk theorem states that in infinitely repeated games just about anything can be rationalized.</p>
<p>However, it is easy to see if it is optimal to look to the future and consider only our own score in a finitely repeated prisoners dilemma.  The result is not optimal.  Instead a tit for tat player who mechanically punishes last period&#8217;s misbehavior by the other player by finking after the other player finks and who mechanically rewards last periods good behavior after the other player cooperates by cooperating will end up with a higher score than a player who rationally maximizes his score and doesn&#8217;t care about the past. </p>
<p>Thus a player who calmly and rationaly maximizes his score given the current situation ends up with a lower score than a player motivated by vindictiveness and gratitute (or a sense of shame over breaking an implicit promise).</p>
<p>This surprising result obtains, because the optimal strategy for a player who can pre-commit is not subgame perfect.  In macro this is called &#8220;dynamic inconsistency&#8221; for some reason.  A classic example of temptation to fink in public policy is the desire to soak the rich.  This is, I think, what Scheiber has in mind.</p>
<p>I think he is totally wrong.  In the optimal strategy with pre-commitment one does not pre-commit to always cooperating.  One pre-commits to tit for tat.</p>
<p>The executives of TARP assisted firms have clearly finked.  In a poll 57% of people described AIG bonuses as &#8220;outrageous.&#8221;  Thus the bill is seen to be tit for tat, a stategy better than &#8220;always cooperate&#8221; in a prisoners dilemma.</p>
<p>Here it is crucial that people sincerely honestly think that AIG-FP managers have finked.  Thus the effect on expectations of future taxes is &#8220;If we do something that most people think is outrageous, we will pay.&#8221; that is a good and useful lesson.</p>
<p>There might be a temptation to pretend that we think rich people have misbehaved so we can grab their money.  That would be finking when they haven&#8217;t finked.  The lesson would be costly.</p>
<p>The effects of the bill depend on whether it is perceived to be arbitrary &#8212; that is if people considering investments of money or effort think that the House pretended to be playing tit for tat when the House was just finking.  I think there can be no doubt about perceptions here.  Even people who think that managers of TARP assisted firms didn&#8217;t fink know that most of the public is outraged.  They also know this happens rarely and only for particular reasons which, even if you don&#8217;t agree with them, you must recognise are comprehensible and thus predictable (and I repeat rare).</p>
<p>Scheiber argues that soaking the bankers is fun but not optimal strategy in a repeated game.  I think he is completely exactly wrong on precisely that point.  A precommitment to always cooperating is a terrible strategy in a prisoner&#8217;s dilemma, yet that is the strategy that Scheiber advocates.</p>
<p>OK so what about rights ? One might argue that retroactive taxes are wrong not becaues they are bad for growth but because they violate human rights which include property rights.  Personally I don&#8217;t believe that human rights include property rights and think that we should let the rich remain rich only for pragmatic repeated game reasons.  This is a question in pure ethics and can&#8217;t be solved by argument or evidence.</p>
<p>Now some people who did their jobs very well will be taxed heavily.  This means that the incentive effects will not be exactly optimal.  The best should not be the enemy of the good.  In questions of rights it is not acceptable to violate some people&#8217;s rights in cases where other people have earned a punishment.  However, the bill is a tax not a punishment.  I think we don&#8217;t have the right to pay less than 90% income taxes, so consideration of targetting the tax should be pragmatic and concern the balance of the incentive effects. </p>
<p>What about the Constitution ? Is this a &#8220;bill of attainder&#8221; or &#8220;ex poste facto law&#8221; ?  Well the Constitution is not what it used to be &#8212; it has been amended.  In particular the 16th amendment gives congress the power to tax income.  </p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.amendmentxvi.html">Amendment XVI</a>The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived, without apportionment among the several states, and without regard to any census or enumeration. </p></blockquote>
<p>It does not say that income earned before the tax bill passes is protected.  It does not say that all income must be taxed at the same rate (notice no one argued that the bill to reduce taxation of dividend income was unconstitutional &#8212; no one has ever argued that the 16th amendment implicitely reads &#8220;&#8230; taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived all at the same rate, without regard &#8230;&#8221; (I think I&#8217;m the only person who has considered this possibility).</p>
<p>Changes in taxes which apply to the current year are quite common and clearly constitutional.</p>
<p>There is no problem. </p>
<p>Finally the bill would take money from rich people (only applies ot people with incomes over $ 250,000).  This would normally be desirable except for the terrible incentive effects.  In this case I think the incentive effects are good.  In particular I think, as argued at length above, the incentive effects via expected future changes in the tax code are good.  So what&#8217;s the problem ?</p>

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>The House has just passed a bill taxing Bonuses of employees (and consultants I hope) who earn over $ 250,000/year of TARP recipients at a rate of 90%.</p>
<p>I think this is an excellent bill.  My reasoning is simple.</p>
<p>If I were to  ignore incentive effects,  I would support a 90% tax on income over 250,000 for egalitarian reasons.  Generally I oppose such rates as they would have bad incentive effects.  I think in this case, the tax has good incentive effects as the general lesson people will take are that if you gamble and lose a lot of money for shareholders and the US treasury you will suffer.</p>
<p>more after the jump.</p>
<p>It is certainly true that some people who did their job well will pay the high tax.  However, the incentive effect depends on the expected future tax as a function of actions and the average actions of people taxed at this rate were destructive and should be discouraged.</p>
<p>Now, I certainly don&#8217;t approve of something like jailing a group of people because the average person in the group has committed at least one felony.  That would violate human rights.  However, I don&#8217;t think that people have any natural right to income over $250,000.  Allowing people to keep more money than that is, for me, always a pragmatic decision. </p>
<p>Other people believe in natural property rights, that people have a right to some share of their income and more should be taken in fines or taxes only if it is proven in court that they broke the law.  The US constitution is, at the moment, inconsistent with this view as it gives congress the right to tax income from any source derived (the 16th amendment).  Before the 16th amendment, the US Constitution established (or in the minds of the other people who disagree with me recognised) property rights.  Now , according to my reading of the constitution, these rights are essentially cancelled (no guess as to how the current Supreme Court would judge, as Bush v Gore showed (and that before O&#8217;Conner was replaced by Alito) they are willing to do whatever it takes to get what they want).  </p>
<p>update:  A long comment I posted at Ezra Klein&#8217;s blog. I&#8217;ve made a promise to myself to not dump comments here, but this is in &#8220;there&#8217;s more&#8221; so I decided it was OK.  If this choice implies negative externalities, it would be optimal for you to get angry with me and punish me even if the punishment were not pleasant to you &#8212; a commitment to punish increases your welfare even if it forces you to undertake the painful task of writing sever comments (which you don&#8217;t enjoy doing). Therefore acting from anger sometimes leads to better outcomes than acting with a level head.</p>
<p>I think that punishing the financiers who created the mess is a wise policy.  There is a fancy name for this argument in economics &#8220;moral hazard,&#8221; but it is really very simple.  </p>
<p>Many people made mistakes which were very costly for the world.  It would be better if in the future, people in similar positions were very afraid of making such mistakes.  This is just internalizing externalities &#8212; trust in banking is like breathable air a public good.</p>
<p>Now some of the tax will fall on people who made no such mistakes.  That part of the incentive effects will be undesirable, but we are talking about taxing rich people (the bill only applies to incomes over $ 250,000) which is desirable for distributional reasons.</p>
<p>In this case, I think the overall incentive effect will be good.  The lesson financiers will take away is &#8220;if we mess up the financial system, we will suffer.&#8221;  This is a good lesson to teach, on balance a good shift in incentives.</p>
<p>Acting from anger is not always a mistake.  Consider the prisoners dilemma.  A tit for tat player (who is honest and vindictive automatically rewarding good behavior and punishing bad behavior of the other player) wins a higher score than a rational player.  It seems odd, but this is a common result in game theory, the optimal strategy is not sub game consistent (involves bluffs which can be called if the player is rational) so a precommitment to irrational vindictiveness is optimal if possible.</p>
<p>Last of all, I think it is perfectly normal for changes in the tax code to have retroactive effects.  According to the US constitution (16th amendment) taxation is not like a fine, it is not legally a punishment which can&#8217;t be retroactive.</p>
<p>No one objected to retroactive tax cuts for the non rich (at least no one I heard or read). In times of financial need, retroactive tax increases are normal.  I&#8217;d say a reasonable evaluation of the House Bill should be strictly utilitarian and consequentialist.  In no way does it remove or infringe rights that people in the US have had in the past hundred years.</p>

                                <p>Lawrence Wilkerson <a target="_blank" href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090319/ap_on_re_la_am_ca/cb_guantanamo_wrongly_held/print">tells the truth and shames the Devil</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Many detainees locked up at Guantanamo were innocent men swept up by U.S. forces unable to distinguish enemies from noncombatants, a former Bush administration official said Thursday. &#8220;There are still innocent people there,&#8221; Lawrence B. Wilkerson, a Republican who was chief of staff to then-Secretary of State Colin Powell, told The Associated Press. &#8220;Some have been there six or seven years.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wilkerson, who first made the assertions in an Internet posting on Tuesday, told the AP he learned from briefings and by communicating with military commanders that the U.S. soon realized many Guantanamo detainees were innocent but nevertheless held them in hopes they could provide information for a &#8220;mosaic&#8221; of intelligence.</p>
<p>&#8220;It did not matter if a detainee were innocent. Indeed, because he lived in Afghanistan and was captured on or near the battle area, he must know something of importance,&#8221; Wilkerson wrote in the blog. He said intelligence analysts hoped to gather &#8220;sufficient information about a village, a region, or a group of individuals, that dots could be connected and terrorists or their plots could be identified.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Nice to know there was a reason.  Read the whole thing, especially<br />
<blockquote>In <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thewashingtonnote.com/archives/2009/03/some_truths_abo/">his posting for The Washington Note blog</a>, Wilkerson wrote that &#8220;U.S. leadership became aware of this lack of proper vetting very early on and, thus, of the reality that many of the detainees were innocent of any substantial wrongdoing, had little intelligence value, and should be immediately released.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I believe that counts as malice aforethought.  Can we please take back The Ancestral Party now?</p>

<p>In a post at his site <a target="_blank" href="http://andrewgbiggs.blogspot.com/2009/03/survey-half-of-workers-would-opt-out-of.html">Andrew Biggs</a> points us to a NewMajority.com piece by him <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newmajority.com/ShowScroll.aspx?ID=13d1525d-a025-4465-842c-e2d536f008fd">Survey: Half of workers would opt out of Social Security if they could</a> which in turn points to a survey sponsored by Sun Life Financial <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sunlife-usa.com/unretirementindex/results.cfm">Results show that almost half (48%) would prefer to stop paying into the Social Security</a></p>
<p>The results broke down by ages as follows:<br />30-39: 59%<br />40-49: 52% (Men 57%, Women 44%)<br />50-59: 44%<br />60+: 34%<br />All: 48% as being willing to drop out of Social Security even if they had to forfeit benefits earned to date.</p>
<p>Which lead Biggs to ask in comments: <i> What does it say when even people who benefit from Social Security have so little faith in it, particularly when the main purpose of the program is to make people feel secure?</i> to which my reply was<br />
<blockquote>Well some people really do believe &#8220;Things go better with Coke&#8221;. Because Coke paid good money to market that message.</p>
<p>The results of the survey tell me something I have known for a long time, the efforts outlined in Butler and Germanis (Cato J. 1983) worked brilliantly. The plan as outlined had three parts which I would summarize as follows:<br />1. Reassure those in or approaching retirement<br />2. Convince younger workers that Social Security just won&#8217;t be there for them<br />3. Present them with a plausible alternative based on the argument &#8216;something is better than nothing&#8217;</p>
<p>This plan was perhaps one of the best marketing campaigns in history with the results seen in the survey. Those who have been exposed to the message promulgated by what is now known as the &#8220;Cato Project (on) Social Security Choice&#8221; aided and abetted by various enterprises sponsored by Pete G. Peterson such as Concord and the movie I.O.U.S.A combined with an active outreach to younger workers via such things as the Fiscal Responsibility Wakeup Tour over the 25 years (since the publication of Butler and Germanis) have largely succumbed to the message strategy. Naturally people will want to opt out if they don&#8217;t believe they will get anything out or can get better returns on their own.</p>
<p>So congratulations are due to all concerned. But all that polling really shows is the success of the marketing campaign. In my experience extraordinarily few of the doubters really have any conception of the actual numbers in play. Mainly because they never seem to be part of the message being delivered. Except of course when they see numbers aggregated over the Infinite Future Horizon for both Social Security and Medicare.</p>
<p>&#8220;What does it say when even people who benefit from Social Security have so little faith in it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Well it suggests to me that Cato got its money worth in some of its past hires.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ll explain that last piece of snark and discuss some implications of this below the fold.</p>
<p>In the Summer of 1983, smarting under what they called the &#8220;fiasco of the last 18 months&#8221;, i.e. the Greenspan Commission and subsequent 1983 Reform, the Cato Institute convened a conference in Washington DC and subsequently published the papers in their Fall 1983 Cato Journal under the title <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cato.org/pubs/journal/cj3n2/cj3n2.html">Social Security: Continuing Crisis or Real Reform</a>. One of those articles had the intriguing title of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cato.org/pubs/journal/cj3n2/cj3n2-11.pdf">Social Security Reform: Achieving a &#8216;Leninist&#8217; Strategy</a>. In that article was laid out the long term plan alluded to in my comment quoted above, which plan focused in large part on convincing younger workers that Social Security just wouldn&#8217;t be there for them. Cato not only accepted that plan it institutionalized it in what was then known as the Project on Social Security Privatization but now known as the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.socialsecurity.org/about/index.html">Project on Social Security Choice</a>. (Note the domain name: http://www.socialsecurity.org/about/index.html &#8211; they have staked a claim to Social Security itself)<br />One thing to note is that &#8216;privatization&#8217; has essentially been scrubbed out of the &#8216;About&#8217; page and in fact it now states<br />
<blockquote>On August 14, 1995, the Cato Institute launched its Project on Social Security Choice, the largest undertaking in the organization&#8217;s history. The objective of the project is to formulate a viable blueprint allowing individuals the opportunity of owning their own retirement account. The project publishes books, studies, and articles and holds conferences. The Cato Institute&#8217;s experts examine the problems facing the current system, the methods that can be used to move towards a system of personal retirement accounts, and the effects that a new system would have on workers.</p></blockquote>
<p> Subsequently it was shown that &#8216;privatization&#8217; and &#8216;privatizing&#8217; didn&#8217;t poll well and so were dropped. As in &#8220;We have always been at war with Oceanea&#8221;. They were a little more open on the actual launch <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cato.org/research/ss_prjct.html">Project on Social Security Privatization</a><br />
<blockquote>On August 14, 1995, the 60th anniversary of Social Security, Cato held a press conference to inaugurate its Project on Social Security Privatization. That event was televised by C-SPAN and covered by ABC’s Good Morning America. The objective of Cato’s Project on Social Security Privatization is to formulate and recommend a viable ‘blueprint’ for privatizing the U.S. Social Security system. The Project is directed by Cato’s director of health and welfare studies, Michael Tanner, and is co-chaired by José Piñera, Chile’s former labor minister and architect of that country’s private pension system, and William Shipman, principal at State Street Global Advisors.</p></blockquote>
<p>How successful was the Project? Well in the early days pretty good. In fact by 1996 they were able to put up this result <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cato.org/pubs/ssps/ssp5es.html">Public Opinion and Social Security Privatization (by Michael Tanner, Project Director)</a> (bolding mine)<br />
<blockquote>Although Social Security remains one of the most popular government programs, most Americans understand that the system faces serious future financial problems and would support privatization of the retirement system, according to the results of a poll conducted by Public Opinion Strategies on behalf of the Cato Project on Social Security Privatization.</p>
<p>Among the poll&#8217;s findings:<br />More than 88 percent of Americans believe that Social Security either is in trouble today or will be in trouble within the next 20 years. Fully 60 percent of all Americans under age 65 believe Social Security will not be there for them when they retire.<br />As a result, more than two-thirds (69 percent) believe that Social Security will require &#8220;major&#8221; or &#8220;radical&#8221; change within the next 20 years. Among younger voters, approximately half believe that major or radical change is needed today. The support for change cuts across ideological and party lines.<br />Voters reject most traditional Social Security reforms such as raising the retirement age, raising payroll taxes, or reducing benefits.<br />Approximately two-thirds of voters would support privatization of Social Security, transforming the program into a privatized mandatory savings program. More than three-quarters of younger voters support privatization.</p></blockquote>
<p> Which explains my snark about Cato&#8217;s &#8220;past hires&#8221;. Starting with Butler and Germanis in 1983 and institutionalizing with the Project in 1995 the Cato Institute set out on a long range plan to undermine traditional Social Security by convincing younger workers that it just wouldn&#8217;t exist AT ALL. This was and is fundamentally dishonest, as long as FICA exists Social Security can pay out some level of benefits. An honest discussion would focus on the exact amount of the shortfall and the full range of possible solutions in that context. That discussion didn&#8217;t happen because the paid professionals at Cato deliberately set out to prevent it. A hint as to the next step comes in the sidebar of the Project&#8217;s &#8216;About&#8217; page. (bolding mine)<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;The largely Cato Institute-staffed presidential commission owes its existence to the Cato Institute itself. For the last quarter of a century, the Washington, D.C.-based libertarian think tank has been campaigning for the privatization of Social Security.&#8221;<br />&#8211; William O&#8217;Rourke, Chicago Sun Times, August 28, 2001</p></blockquote>
<p>Per O&#8217;Rourke it would seem that the original Butler and Germanis plan was first institutionalized under Cato with the Project and then elevated to official status with the 2001 Commission, itself staffed by those hired professionals from Cato. And who beside Director Tanner would those people be. Well those who follow this series will be familiar with at least one name. From the Cato <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cato.org/people/biggs.html">people</a> page.<br />
<blockquote>Andrew Biggs is a former Social Security analyst and Assistant Director of the Cato Institute&#8217;s Project on Social Security Choice. Prior to joining Cato he was Director of Research at the Congressional Institute in Washington, D.C. (where he remains a Fellow), and a staff member for the House Banking and Financial Services Committee. He holds a Bachelor&#8217;s degree from the Queen&#8217;s University of Belfast, Master&#8217;s from Cambridge University and Ph.D. from the London School of Economics and Political Science.<br />In 2001 Biggs served as a staff member for the President’s Commission to Strengthen Social Security, and in 2002 he was appointed by the Bush administration as a delegate to the National Summit on Retirement Savings and addressed the United Nations International Conference on Financing for Development.</p></blockquote>
<p>So when Biggs asked &#8220;&#8221;What does it say when even people who benefit from Social Security have so little faith in it?&#8221;</p>
<p>and I replied: &#8220;Well it suggests to me that Cato got its money worth in some of its past hires.&#8221;  I really meant &#8220;Heckuva job, Andy!&#8221;</p>
<p>People who make the argument that Social Security should be privatized because so many people under 50 are skeptical that it will even be there have the cart ahead of the horse. The real question is why those people are so skeptical to begin with? And to me the answer is pretty clear, Cato set out in 1983 to sell privatization via what I can only describe as a systematic propaganda plan aptly described by Butler and Germanis as a &#8221; &#8216;Leninist&#8217; Strategy&#8221;. It worked. Because I have a 1996 poll and a 2009 survey to prove it. A final note from Butler and Germanis<br />
<blockquote>There are two main elements to this strategy. <br />The first element consists of a campaign to achieve small legislative changes that embellish the present IRA system, making it in practice a small-scale private Social Security system that can supplement the federal system. As part of this campaign, the natural constituency for an enlarged IRA system must be identified and welded into a coalition for political change. If these objectives are achieved, we will meet the next financial crisis in Social Security with a private alternative ready in the wings—an alternative with which the public is familiar and comfortable, and one that has the backing of a powerful political force. </p>
<p>The second main element in our reform strategy involves what one might crudely call guerrilla warthre against both the current Social Security system and the coalition that supports it. An economic education campaign, assisted by modest changes in the law, must be undertaken to demonstrate the weaknesses of the existing system and to allow it to be compared accurately (and therefore unfavorably) with the private alternative. In addition, methods of neutralizing, buying out, or winning over key segments of the Social Security coalition must be explored and formulated into legislative initiatives, <br />The objective of this element of the strategy complements the first. The aim is to weaken political support for the present system when the next financial crisis appears. This two-pronged strategy will now be considered in more detail.</p></blockquote>
<p> Hmm, &#8220;an economic education campaign&#8221;. Gosh there is another word for what is being proposed here, one on the tip of my tongue, I think it starts with a &#8216;p&#8217; and is associated with a certain <a target="_blank" href="http://www.psywarrior.com/Goebbels.html">Herr G</a>. Even paranoids have real enemies. Mine are at the Cato Institute and strolling around the offices of the PGP Foundation.</p>
