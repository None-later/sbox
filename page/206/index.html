<p><strong>Predicting Recessions, The Great Stagnation, and Will There Be a Double Dip?</strong></p>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot of talk about a double dip recession these days.  I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s a precise definition of a double dip recession, but I think if there was it would be something like this:  &#8220;a recession, followed by a recovery which doesn&#8217;t last very long, leading into another recession.&#8221;    Given the official end of the recession occurred in June of 2009, if the current slow down is (or results in) a recession which gets labeled a double dip, that would imply a double dip recession is one that occurs no more than about two years after the previous recession ended.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>By that standard, there&#8217;s only been one double recession in the last few decades &#8211; a recession began in July &#8217;81, 12 months after the previous one ended.   Before that, you have to go back to the supposedly &#8220;Roaring&#8221; 1920s, when you&#8217;ll find quite a few recessions coming back to back to back.  You&#8217;ll also find multiple and large tax cuts, I might add.  A cool graph of tax rates and recessions from 1920 to 1940 can be found <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/04/1920s-depression-glenn-beck-thomas.html">here</a>.  Its really cool because the data just refuses to match up with what they&#8217;ve been teaching in econ classes for the past three decades.</p>
<p>Now, I was curious &#8211; how do you tell when you&#8217;re in a recession?  (Long time readers may recall my frustration, having called both the start and end of the Great Recession <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/09/predicting-start-and-end-of-great.html">in complete anonymity when I had a book to sell!</a>.  I guess the pay is better in being always wrong.  The book, by the way, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Presimetrics-Presidents-Measure-Issues-ebook/dp/B0041IXRWA/ref=tmm_kin_title_0?ie=UTF8&#038;m=AG56TWVU5XWC2">is still for sale</a> and still provides a very different way of looking at the world that matches up with data very nicely.)  </p>
<p>In this post, I want to stick to some of the traditional views.  Basically, if you corner enough economists, you might get them to tell you recessions begin if there&#8217;s a big drop in private consumption, private investment, or gov&#8217;t spending.  I hasten to add &#8211; that&#8217;s mostly investment in stuff, not in stocks and bonds.   (Not all economists would agree with each of these items, I might add.   So, let&#8217;s cut to the data and see what it shows.  Data on real (inflation adjusted) private consumption and investment, and government spending is available from the BEA&#8217;s <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/TableView.asp?SelectedTable=6&#038;ViewSeries=NO&#038;Java=no&#038;Request3Place=N&#038;3Place=N&#038;FromView=YES&#038;Freq=Year&#038;FirstYear=1929&#038;LastYear=2011&#038;3Place=N&#038;Update=Update&#038;JavaB">NIPA Table 1.16</a>.  Quarterly data goes back to 1947, and annual data goes back to 1929.  (And please, please, please, don&#8217;t write to me about using some data set of suspect provenience developed decades after the fact.  I don&#8217;t make up numbers, and I don&#8217;t use anyone else&#8217;s made up numbers either except when I&#8217;m pointing out problems with such data sets.)   Recession dates come from the <a href="http://www.nber.org/cycles.html">NBER</a>. </p>
<p>Now, for every recession beginning with the one that started in October of &#8217;48, I looked at the change over four quarters in real personal consumption, real private investment, and real gov&#8217;t spending through the quarter in which the recession began.  For the recessions that began in May &#8217;37 and February &#8217;45, quarterly data wasn&#8217;t available, so I looked at the one year change in real personal consumption, real private investment, and real gov&#8217;t spending through the year when the recession began .  The recession of 1929 was ignored because data began that year &#8211; hence, the one year change through 1929 is not available.  </p>
<p>The table below indicates with an X if there was a drop in any of these three factors for any given recession.  </p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-PPMC1yThA7s/Te2CxHdeVII/AAAAAAAAAok/JpU9l8iU52s/s1600/Figure_1stagnation.bmp"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-PPMC1yThA7s/Te2CxHdeVII/AAAAAAAAAok/JpU9l8iU52s/s320/Figure_1stagnation.bmp" border="0" alt=""></a>Figure 1.</p>
<p>As the table shows, five of the eight recessions between 1937 and 1973 were preceded by a cut in real gov&#8217;t spending.  None of the recessions after 1973 were preceded by a government spending cut.   On the other hand, cuts in private investment also preceded two recessions that occurred before 1973, and all but one (four out of five) of the recessions that came after that date.  </p>
<p>So&#8230;  before 1973, cuts in gov&#8217;t may have been responsible for some recessions, and reduced investment may have been responsible for most recessions since the 1970s.  (If that break sounds familiar, it is more less where Tyler Cowen puts the start of his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Great-Stagnation-Low-Hanging-Eventually-ebook/dp/B004H0M8QS/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&#038;qid=1307228647&#038;sr=8-2">Great Stagnation</a>, though as I&#8217;ve pointed out, Cowen&#8217;s philosophy doesn&#8217;t allow him to understand <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/02/another-look-at-keynesianism-and-great.html">what</a> <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/02/critique-of-tyler-cowen-great.html">happened</a> to cause that Great Stagnation.  My guess is this can be added to that list.)  </p>
<p>In recent decades, big drops in private investment have often been portents of recessions.  And if you&#8217;re wondering&#8230;  according to the May update of Table 1.1.6 (link above), private investment (in 2005 dollars) reached a post-recession high of 1.855 trillion in the third quarter of 2010.  It fell to 1.761  trillion in the fourth quarter of 2010, and 1.813 trillion in the first quarter of 2011.  We won&#8217;t know for a while what happened in the second quarter of 2011, but&#8230;  things are a bit shaky.  Ironically,  at this point in time, one thing that might shellac private investment is a big reduction in gov&#8217;t spending.  Right now I think there&#8217;s a good chance we&#8217;re just going to skate along on feeble growth rather than an outright second recession, but its going to be near miss at best.  Public confidence is really poor, and its easy to see how private investment might fall even further if the gov&#8217;t takes its ball and goes home.  (As regular readers know, I&#8217;m a big deficit hawk so it hurts to write that, though I&#8217;d hope to see the gov&#8217;t spending to be done more rationally than it has been since the whole mess started in 2008.)  Of course, it also would help if <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/12/simple-explanation-for-strange-paradox.html">proper incentives were provided</a>.</p>

<p>An <a href="http://baselinescenario.com/2011/06/03/why-are-the-french-so-determined-to-run-the-imf-%E2%80%93-and-what-will-it-cost-you/">excellent post by Simon Johnson.</a>  </p>
<blockquote><p>The managing director of the IMF is the impresario of any bailout.  The big decisions must be negotiated with all significant stakeholders but this still leaves enormous scope for discretion.</p>
<p>If Ms. Lagarde becomes managing director she can directly influence the terms of IMF involvement – and based on her negotiating position to date within the eurozone, we can presume she will lean towards more money, easier terms, and above all no losses for the banks that made foolish loans.<br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Increasingly it looks like the eurozone leadership, under French guidance, will go for the Full Bailout option, in which all Greek debt is bought up by the IMF, by the European Central Bank, and by other eurozone entities.  This debt will be held to maturity – and any creditor who did not yet sell will be made whole (those who already sold at a loss are out of luck).</p>
<p>This course of action will be expensive, in terms of nominal outlays and in real risk-adjusted terms, because whatever terms Greece gets must also be offered to Ireland and Portugal.  The IMF may need to raise more capital or – more likely – tap its credit lines from member governments.</p></blockquote>
<p>Also&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>The French want to sway decision-making at the IMF in order to use US, Japanese, and poorer countries’ money to conceal from their own electorate that the eurozone structure has led all its members into serious fiscal jeopardy – some borrowed heavily, while others let their banks lend irresponsibly and thus created a large contingent liability. </p>
<p>The best way to hide the true cost is to have other people’s taxpayers foot the bill, preferably with the least possible transparency.  There is a lot at stake for eurozone politicians.  Ms. Lagarde will run the IMF.</p></blockquote>
<p>The George Bush/Barack Obama bail-out policy writ larger&#8230;</p>

<p>Congressional Progressive Caucus People&#8217;s Budget beats Ryan&#8217;s corporatist budget by a long shot, but doesn&#8217;t get media coverage</p>
<p>FAIR has a good point on the way the media have covered the US budget debates.</p>
<p>Fact is, the radical right wing budget proposed by radical right Ryan gets lots of coverage. FAIR noted that he was on Meet the Press 4/10, Face the Nation 4/17, ABC&#8217;sThis Week 5/1, PBS News Hour (one on one) 5/1, ABC Good Morning America 4/13, and he&#8217;s been profiled personally, showing that he has learned the key to Reagan&#8217;s success&#8211;you can say the most absurd things that are ultimately extraordinarily dangerous for ordinary people, and get ordinary people to think you are great, just by smiling and coming across as &#8220;genuine&#8221; and acting like you believe the lies you are spreading.  Be a good actor, that is, and you can move the corporatist agenda forward at huge cost to ordinary Americans, because they will (regrettably) trust in your (fake) genuineness that you will do right by them.  The budget plan has been covered in nightly news shows many times&#8211;though not with the kind of piercing analysis that would expose its corporatist bones for what it is.  Instead, in the segments I&#8217;ve watched, it is almost always treated as though it is what it claims to be, an attempt to put the US on sound fiscal footing.  That&#8217;s simply bullshit.  It&#8217;s an attempt to eliminate the New Deal and move the US back to the pre-New Deal period when regulators were weak-kneed and Business could pretty much do whatever it wanted, and the military would serve Big Business interests around the globe.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />Fact is, a very reasonable budget proposed by the Congressional Progressive Caucus, <a target="_blank" href="http://cpc.grijalva.house.gov/index.cfm?sectionid=70">&#8220;The People&#8217;s Budget&#8221;</a>, that is based on sound economics, has gotten almost no coverage at all.  What does it do?  It increases tax on the wealthy (after a decade of their enjoying super-rich tax cuts), cuts military spending (after decades of enormous investments in the military, with the base budget for Defense doubling between 2000 and 2009 under George W. Bush), and imposes on a tax on Wall Street speculation (the kind of speculation that got us into a Great Recession that the rich have eased through and ordinary Americans are still suffering enormously from).  The Budget proposes investments in public infrastructure that would spur economic growth, create jobs and ensure that the US does not continue to move towards third-world status in terms of its infrastructure.  It includes a new public health insurance option as part of the national exchanges for health care plans, providing economies of scale and lower premiums. It also preserves Social Security benefits by raising the taxable amount of income. </p>
<blockquote><p>Under the current system, income above a taxable maximum is not subject to any Social Security tax, meaning that high-income individuals pay less as a share of their income than everyone else. As income inequality has widened, a greater share of income has fallen outside of the taxable maximum, with the percent of earnings covered by the program slipping from 91% in 1983 to just 83% in 2009.</p></blockquote>
<p>See the Economic Policy Institute for a technical analysis of the proposals, <a target="_blank" href="http://epi.3cdn.net/55d8ba5873e5bd097e_avm6b8rb1.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p>Why is it that media covers the obscene Ryan plan and ignores the reasonable Progressive Caucus proposal?  Probably because the radical right budget proposed by Ryan satisfies all the points of the corporatist agenda&#8211;cutting funds to support Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, the social programs that blunt the edge of brute capitalism while keeping the gravy train going for the military-industrial-financial complex.  Also, the Ryan budget is built on the same ideas of reagonomics that get touted as wonder workers even while they have wreaked economies from ours to Argentinas.  Free marketarianism doesn&#8217;t work, never has, never will&#8211;it is brute capitalism that allows big business, and especially multinational corporations, to exploit little people at will while the few elite at the top (managers and owners) reap all the benefits.l That&#8217;s the Ryan budget in short.  Instead of restoring the taxes on the wealthy to where they were before the George W. Bush regime in which economic idiocy reigned supreme along with neoliberal warmongering thinking that led us into two huge neverending wars that feed the military-industrial business machine, the Ryan budget would cut programs that make the difference between a decent life and a miserable one for aged and sick and poor Americans, while handing big business every gift it asks for.</p>
<p>And maybe because the corporate owners of corporate media are support the corporatist agenda to keep ordinary people from having real information about options that are in their interest, so that it will be easier to pass legislation (and issue court rulings) that favor multinational corporations over people.</p>

<p>Ask physicians and nurses about their biggest clinical problems and non-compliant patients will likely be near the top of the list.</p>
<p>And why should we care? Because non-compliant patients are huge cost drivers.</p>
<p>Ezekiel Emanuel (MD, PhD, NIH) estimates that one-third of U.S. health care costs are driven by diabetes, and we know a lot about controlling diabetes, but it is very dependent on the patient being compliant with diet and medications. We don&#8217;t do so well on this.</p>
<p>Is there something about Americans that make us less compliant than we should be? Is our consumer culture a bad place to promote health? Is there not enough information? Are we stressed into non-compliance?</p>
<p>Whatever the reason, it is very costly for all of us.</p>

<li><a href="http://underbelly-buce.blogspot.com/">Buce</a> has been on fire recently, so I&#8217;ll probably have to do a post about why <a href="http://underbelly-buce.blogspot.com/2011/05/can-taxpayers-thank-eliot-spitzer-for.html">this post</a> is so off-target, though his conclusion is correct (short version: he&#8217;s been misled).</p>
</li>
<li>If I&#8217;m reading this morning&#8217;s <a href="http://www.smartbrief.com/servlet/encodeServlet?issueid=B7FCF69E-7215-4E6D-AC62-53F6A3532773&#038;sid=4da1e808-6b9f-4d1d-bfb8-caea93b4c6d8">SIFMA Brief</a> correctly, Moody&#8217;s—whose rating skills Robert has discussed at length—(1) may downgrade US debt <a href="http://r.smartbrief.com/resp/cVvhCcmoBhBZAweeXXqh">if we spend too much </a>and (2) will downgrade US banks <a href="http://r.smartbrief.com/resp/cVvhCcmoBhBZAweltoih">unless we spend too much on them</a>.  Oh, and the banks object to regulation because it would <a href="http://r.smartbrief.com/resp/cVvhCcmoBhBZAweBelfW">&#8220;artificially&#8221; reduce asset values</a> (presumably, many of the same ones Moody&#8217;s wants protected).
</li>
<li>Relatedly, James Salt (probably h/t Felix) notes that &#8220;generous&#8221; UK banks are <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/jim-saft/2011/06/02/beware-generous-uk-banks/">playing reporting games</a>.  (The US version is to deny the rework and leave the asset marked at unsustainable levels.)
</li>
<li>That <a href="http://holykaw.alltop.com/school-superintendent-requests-school-be-turn">this is spot-on</a> would make me sadder if I thought we still lived in anything resembling a meritocracy, or even a developing economy.
</li>
<li>If we needed further evidence of that, the state with the best secondary eduction system in the country is pushing forward with <a href="http://schoolfinance101.wordpress.com/2011/06/03/the-offensively-defensive-ideology-of-charter-schooling/">privatize-the-gains</a>.
</li>
<li>I&#8217;m more and more convinced that China &#8220;is different,&#8221; but very much not certain the differences will make an ultimate difference.  Daniel Gross <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/blogs/daily-ticker/bear-china-shop-163217166.html">is inclined to think not</a>.  More on this as I finally finish my review of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Boombustology-Spotting-Financial-Bubbles-Before/dp/0470879467/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&#038;s=books&#038;qid=1305207274&#038;sr=1-1"><em>BoomBustOlogy</em></a>, which you should expect to see some time before the apocalypse.
</li>
<li>I assume everyone has already seen <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/group/scspi/cgi-bin/facts.php">this</a>.  Just in case, <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/group/scspi/cgi-bin/facts.php">check out the facts</a>, stylised or not.
</li>
<li>Oh, and Felix is wrong <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2011/05/31/the-stocks-housing-disconnect/">here</a>.  But that&#8217;s a post that will probably never be written by me.  Someone else want to send it in?</li>

<p>I am not a Libertarian Because I Believe in Freedom and Property Rights, And I&#8217;d Like to Minimize Government Coercion, Part 2</p>
<p>This is a follow-up to my <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/05/i-am-not-libertarian-because-i-believe.html">previous post</a> on libertarian philosophy, the aftermath of which was a surprising amount of, well, let&#8217;s just call it assorted vigorously uncomplementary communication.  (Shows what I get for making myself easy to find, eh?)  But I also got some more interesting comments from libertarians which have led me to think further, and perhaps they can help me refine my thoughts.  </p>
<p>To quote something I noted in the last post below the fold: </p>
<p><a name="more"></a> </p>
<blockquote><p>In the end, the question is &#8211; who will be coerced, how many will be coerced, and how bad will the coercion be? I tend to come down on the side that the coerced party should be the one that is the first to try to coerce others, and that the coerced party should be as small as possible, and that the coercion should be the least bit possible.</p></blockquote>
<p>By that I mean the following&#8230;  when people in an apartment complex listen to loud music, or they let their lawn get overgrown with weeds, or they don&#8217;t vaccinate their children, or they dump toxic waste in a river that passes through their property, or engage in any number of other of activities, there can be very large negative externalities created.  This is because the loud music doesn&#8217;t stop at their property line, and the weeds emit seeds or shelter vermin that move beyond their property line, and stuff dumped in a river keeps going past their property line, etc.  </p>
<p>Now, just about every activity produces some externalities, positive and negative.  Externalities are a byproduct of human activity and progress, and we don&#8217;t want to eliminate the good with the bad.  Nothing gets produced without some amount of pollution and/or destruction.   That means unless we want to live in caves, some amount of externalities have to be tolerated in society.  The question comes down to how much, generated by whom, who decides, and is there some form of compensation for those who suffer the consequences?</p>
<p>Decades ago, Ronald Coase provided an answer.  (A comment to non-economists:  the paper, perhaps the reason he won a Nobel Prize, is surprisingly readable and I recommend it.  A pdf version is <a href="http://www.sfu.ca/~allen/CoaseJLE1960.pdf">here</a>.  Its been a decade since I looked at it last, I think I&#8217;ll reread it myself!)  Essentially, he said that the problem is reciprocal &#8211; my right to prevent you from emitting toxic fumes impinges on your right to emit them.  As long as the property rights are well defined, and it is easy for the various parties to negotiate, you end up with the same (efficient) outcome no matter who has the right to decide what goes into the air.  The reason:  the various parties will negotiate amongst themselves.  </p>
<p>But there are some problems, aside from who decides the property rights.  Coase identified one &#8211; that is is often difficult for parties to negotiate; one nightclub has a lot of incentive to generate loud music and might be able to figure out how much that generates in revenue, whereas folks two blocks away might still have their sleep disturbed by some sub-sonic thumping, but they might have a harder time realizing they were harmed or putting a dollar figure on that harm.  Besides, how do you get everyone together who was harmed to negotiate?</p>
<p>There are other problems&#8230;  my son is too young to be vaccinated for many diseases.  The anti-vaxx movement is killing herd immunity.  If my son gets the measles before he is old enough to get the MMR vaccine, will I know who caused it?  In the unlikely even that I do know, in what world will my son be adequately compensated?  </p>
<p>But there is one other problem Coase did not consider.  I frankly don&#8217;t care if someone is listening to mind-numbing bass on their sound system down the block.  I only care if I (and to be socially minded) or someone else is forced to listen to that bass. My guess is that in most instances, the person generating the mind-numbing bass doesn&#8217;t care whether other people are listening to it either.  And while it is possible for the party generating the music to ensure that the music (mostly) stays on his/her property, it is very difficult for a very large number of neighbors scattered over a wider area to protect against the broad range of all possible negative externalities that might seep onto their property, any one of which might start up at any time.  </p>
<p>In the end, someone has to decide how much a person can do on his/her property taking into account what externalities are generated.  And unless you want a free-for-all or people are sufficiently distant from each other that none of the negative externalities generated is very large, that someone is the government.  </p>
<p>From what I can tell, this is the crux of the problem as far as most libertarians are concerned.  Given their distrust of the government, they want people to be left alone.  And that leads a free-for-all.  Galt&#8217;s Gulch may even begin as a well-ordered place, but it very quickly either develops order, or becomes an anarchy and eventually gets abandoned.  If you don&#8217;t believe it, there are countless examples across the American West.  Less familiar to Americans, the same pattern can be seen with settlements all across Latin America.  Pick any random town in the middle of, let&#8217;s just say, the state of Goias in Brazil.  (A nice place to visit, by the way, though I haven&#8217;t been there in twenty five years.)  The history of that random town is probably the same regardless of which one you pick.  Some settlers left a bigger settlement somewhere on the coast of Brazil, either because they were looking for gold or wanted to set up a ranch.  At first there were no rules, but those settlements that are still around today are called towns and cities, have plenty of rules, and a government to enforce them.  I can&#8217;t think of a functioning place that manages to remain like Galt&#8217;s Gulch after a couple of generations.</p>

                                <p>A post of mine on May 17 titled <a target="_blank" href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/">The Difference Between Defending DOMA and Defending Neo-Nazis and the ACA</a> discussed a post on the Blog of Legal Times that summarized part of a lengthy article published that day on Daily Report Online.  These websites and their respective hard-copy publications, Legal Times, based in New Jersey, and Daily Report, based in Atlanta, are part of American Law Media, which publishes The National Law Journal and several local law journals around the country.  The Daily Report Online article is titled “Inside K&#038;S&#8217;s DOMA debacle.”  </p>
<p>K&#038;S is Atlanta-based mega law firm King &#038; Spalding.  DOMA is the Defense of Marriage Act. King &#038; Spalding’s debacle is that … well … read my earlier post.</p>
<p>Or, better yet, read the full Daily Report Online article, by Daily Report reporter Meredith Hobbs.  The Blog of Legal Times article, which, as I said, summarized only part of the article—a small part, it turns out—provided an, um, password-protected link to the source article, useful for all you folks who subscribe to the Daily Report.

<p>Wednesday, May 11, 2011<br />Inside K&#038;S&#8217;s DOMA debacle<br />Firm&#8217;s Washington chief says review process wasn&#8217;t followed due to an &#8216;unfortunate misunderstanding&#8217;<br />By Meredith Hobbs, Staff Reporter</p>
<p>Following a barrage of criticism over King &#038; Spalding&#8217;s withdrawal from defending the Defense of Marriage Act two weeks ago, the Washington office managing partner broke the firm&#8217;s official silence and made a statement to the Daily Report accepting responsibility for the &#8220;unfortunate misunderstanding&#8221; and &#8220;breakdown in communications&#8221; that led former partner Paul D. Clement to contract with the U.S. House of Representatives to defend the law.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />Other than a short statement on April 25 by firm chairman Robert D. Hays Jr. calling the vetting process inadequate, the statement by J. Sedwick &#8220;Wick&#8221; Sollers gives the first insight that the firm has offered publicly into how it came to defend DOMA, only to withdraw from the case 11 days later. </p>
<p>Sollers&#8217; full statement read: &#8220;Although our chairman Robert Hays has issued a short statement saying he assumed ultimate responsibility for any mistakes that were made, I want to make sure the record is clear that I was the member of firm management in primary contact with Paul Clement regarding this matter. As I have reflected on this, despite the fact that our standard client/matter review process was not followed, it was reasonable for him to believe that the firm would accept the matter. This was an unfortunate misunderstanding with a friend whom I personally recruited to the firm and strongly supported. I am deeply disappointed by Paul&#8217;s departure and regret the breakdown in communications.&#8221; </p>
<p>Although the statement from Sollers indicated that Clement was given some form of encouragement to take the case, it maintained Hays&#8217; position that the vetting process was inadequate. Sollers&#8217; statement doesn&#8217;t conflict with a blistering public letter of resignation addressed to Hays that Clement released to the media on April 25.</p>
<p>Clement took the highly unusual step in his letter of publicly criticizing his former firm for &#8220;abandoning&#8221; a client because of public pressure, but he offered no details on what he viewed as the firm&#8217;s support for taking the case.</p>
<p>In that letter, Clement said, &#8220;I would have never undertaken this matter unless I believed I had the full backing of the firm. I recognized from the outset that this statute implicates very sensitive issues that prompt strong views on both sides.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When it comes to lawyers, the surest way to be on the wrong side of history is to abandon a client in the face of hostile criticism,&#8221; he wrote, adding that &#8220;efforts to delegitimize any representation for one side of a legal controversy are a profound threat to the rule of law.&#8221;</p>
<p>The gap between Hays&#8217; statement that the matter was inadequately vetted and Clement&#8217;s that he believed the firm was backing it stirred up a firestorm in the media. </p>
<p>Editorial writers castigated King &#038; Spalding for withdrawing from the controversial case, and the firm has faced vehement criticism outside the legal community, first from gay rights supporters and now from anti-gay rights groups.</p>
<p>The Daily Report&#8217;s conversations with two lawyers within the firm who spoke on condition that they not be named because King &#038; Spalding has prohibited its people from talking publicly about the controversy, as well as a third person familiar with the situation, said that the DOMA matter was not submitted to the firm&#8217;s business review committee. They say the firm is being criticized for dropping a case it never properly accepted.</p>
<p>Clement has not spoken publicly about the matter since releasing his resignation letter. He did not respond to several calls and emails from the Daily Report over the past week and after receiving Sollers&#8217; statement.</p>
<p>The firm&#8217;s only previous statement on the DOMA matter was that of Hays announcing the firm&#8217;s withdrawal from the engagement April 25, just a week after it became public that Clement had agreed to represent the U.S. House. &#8220;In reviewing this assignment further, I determined that the process used for vetting this engagement was inadequate,&#8221; Hays said, adding that he took responsibility for any mistakes.</p>
<p>King &#038; Spalding had not done any work on the case when it disengaged; there are no filings in Windsor v. U.S., one of the suits challenging the law, from when Clement filed the April 18 motion to intervene through April 25, when the chair of the firm&#8217;s business review committee, New York partner Richard A. Cirillo, filed a motion for King &#038; Spalding to withdraw.</p>
<p>Clement left King &#038; Spalding for a small Washington boutique, Bancroft, the same day to stay on the DOMA matter.</p>
<p>The sources who spoke to the Daily Report said that the DOMA matter was never vetted by the firm&#8217;s business review committee before Clement signed a contract obligating the firm. They said the committee, composed of five partners from different offices, immediately began reviewing the case Tuesday, April 19—the day after the firm learned of the contract—and rejected it the next day.</p>
<p>&#8220;The firm did not back out. We never agreed to take it,&#8221; said one of the King &#038; Spalding lawyers.</p>
<p>Clement signed the engagement contract to handle the DOMA matter on April 14, but his involvement did not become public until April 18, when he filed a motion to intervene in Windsor v. U.S. in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.</p>
<p>The judge in the case had given Congress until April 18 to intervene after the U.S. Department of Justice in late February announced it would not defend challenges to Section 3 of DOMA, defining marriage for federal purposes as a union between a man and a woman, because it violates the equal protection clause of the Constitution.</p>
<p>The sources said the firm&#8217;s partners were taken by surprise when the news broke that Clement had taken the DOMA engagement. By the next day, the sources said, some partners had learned that the case had not been submitted for vetting to the firm&#8217;s business review committee. All matters at King &#038; Spalding must be approved by this committee, they said, adding it was discovered that there was no matter file for the DOMA case in the firm&#8217;s system.</p>
<p>Only the business review committee can create a matter file, said the sources. Without one, an engagement effectively does not exist, since there is no way to bill hours to it. The sources said nobody at the firm has the authority to override the decisions of the business review committee.</p>
<p>King &#038; Spalding, like other large firms, is managed by practice groups, not offices. Partners submit a potential matter to the business review committee with approval from the practice group leader. A conflicts check must be performed and, if a case checks out, the business review committee facilitates further vetting, said one of the sources.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any matter that is controversial in any way or where there is a discounted rate goes through the business review committee,&#8221; said one of the sources, noting that the DOMA engagement was both controversial and had a discounted rate.</p>
<p>The contract that Clement signed with the House—which was made public by House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi—specified a blended rate of $520 per hour for Clement and two other partners, with a ceiling of $500,000 over a two-year period. Clement&#8217;s customary rate has been reported at $800 per hour. At least 12 suits have been filed challenging Section 3 of DOMA.</p>
<p>All of the King &#038; Spalding sources said that there was adamant opposition to the DOMA case from within the firm. One of the sources said there has never been such opposition by the firm&#8217;s partners to an engagement: &#8220;never in these numbers and vehemence to this magnitude.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It sticks a finger in the eye of people,&#8221; said one of the sources, referring to the firm&#8217;s gay lawyers and staff. An associate of the firm is president of Georgia&#8217;s gay legal group, the Stonewall Bar Association, while a King &#038; Spalding partner is on Stonewall&#8217;s board.</p>
<p>One source said the case also did not fit the firm&#8217;s business mission. &#8220;King &#038; Spalding is a corporate law firm—not a constitutional firm. This is not the kind of case the firm generally takes.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was also opposition to a clause in the contract gagging the firm&#8217;s people from any advocacy around DOMA, said the sources, who added that the clause was likely illegal in California, where the firm has two offices.</p>
<p>Democrats on the Committee on House Administration, which reviews outside counsel contracts, said the majority Republicans on their committee kept Clement&#8217;s contract secret from them. But a King &#038; Spalding source said the client&#8217;s possible concerns over confidentiality would not have prompted anyone at the firm to bypass the review committee.</p>
<p>&#8220;The idea that the business review committee cannot keep client confidentiality a secret is absurd,&#8221; the source said.</p>
<p>According to news reports, Clement&#8217;s new contract with the House is the same as his old one—for the same rate and fee and with the same ban on advocacy around DOMA by firm employees. But the muzzling clause now is for seven lawyers and staff at a Washington boutique where members share a conservative ideology, according to their website biographies, rather than for more than 800 lawyers, plus staff, with disparate political and social outlooks in 17 offices in the U.S., Europe, the Middle East and Asia.</p>

Payroll employment was little changed at 54,000.  This is considerably weaker than over the last few months and is in line with other data that suggest the economy has weakened significantly.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-EHeRhTj7xNM/TejgTZpHi_I/AAAAAAAABpM/SDcMr9l5OZ4/s1600/Clipboard0%2B1enp.bmp"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-EHeRhTj7xNM/TejgTZpHi_I/AAAAAAAABpM/SDcMr9l5OZ4/s320/Clipboard0%2B1enp.bmp" alt="" border="0"></a>The household survey reported that employment rose by 105,000 while the civilian labor force grew by some 272,000.   Consequently the unemployment rate ticked back up to 9.1% from 9,0%.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-DPgwoetpTAs/Teje3jGo1uI/AAAAAAAABo8/igpXj3e6KbI/s1600/Clipboard01%2Bunemp%2Brate.bmp"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-DPgwoetpTAs/Teje3jGo1uI/AAAAAAAABo8/igpXj3e6KbI/s320/Clipboard01%2Bunemp%2Brate.bmp" alt="" border="0"></a><br />Even with the uptick in the unemployment rate my fed policy index is still calling for a fed funds rate of 1.0%. This implies that the Fed should not renew QE II as the current easing ends.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-I-rGeygj7Cc/TejfI6qWfwI/AAAAAAAABpE/nMIvw8_o_bE/s1600/Clipboard01%2Bfed%2Bindex.bmp"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-I-rGeygj7Cc/TejfI6qWfwI/AAAAAAAABpE/nMIvw8_o_bE/s320/Clipboard01%2Bfed%2Bindex.bmp" alt="" border="0"></a><br />The workweek was unchanged at 34.4 hours.  So with the small gain in employment aggregate hours worked was only up 0.1%</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ha4-2q-D26g/TejeGKO_bZI/AAAAAAAABok/0826CpSWlPc/s1600/Clipboard01%2Bhours.bmp"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ha4-2q-D26g/TejeGKO_bZI/AAAAAAAABok/0826CpSWlPc/s320/Clipboard01%2Bhours.bmp" alt="" border="0"></a>Average hourly earnings rose by 0.3%, but the year over year gain in average hourly earnings is only 1.8% &#8212; a near record low.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-8nIeSLyo5us/TejeY7BKJPI/AAAAAAAABos/530ctzodeNI/s1600/Clipboard01%2Bavg%2Bwage.bmp"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-8nIeSLyo5us/TejeY7BKJPI/AAAAAAAABos/530ctzodeNI/s320/Clipboard01%2Bavg%2Bwage.bmp" alt="" border="0"></a><br />With weak hourly earnings and only a 0.1% gain in hours worked average weekly wages are only up 2.7 % from a year ago.   With the CPI at 3.1% as of April it should be no surprise that the economy is weak.</p>

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p> The stock market is  adjusting to weaker 2011 <br />economic and earnings growth.  Business executives,<br />analysts and economists have yet to reduce their 2011 <br />estimates,  So the important question is how much of the lower<br />growth is already discounted.  The consensus had been for<br />double digit earnings gains in 2011.  But now it appears that<br />earnings growth will be less than nominal GDP growth &#8212;<br />the low single digits.</p>
<p>The revised first quarter GDP deflator of 1.9% appears to  be <br />weaker  than what other measures of inflation are reporting. </p>
<p>It is low.  Within  the  report the deflators for both gross domestic purchases <br />and the personal consumption  expenditures ( PCE) rose at a 3.8% rate.  </p>
<p>The low GDP deflator stems  from the way GDP is calculated. <br />GDP subtracts imports from final demand to indirectly  estimate <br />production.  When you buy an imported car it is reported in  PCE. <br />But  GDP measures production, not consumption.  To go from <br />consumption to production  that imported car has to be backed out  <br />of the data by subtracting imports.  So  subtracting imports is the right way  <br />to calculate GDP. </p>
<p>But when  import prices surge  &#8212; in the last quarter they rose at a 21.8% rate &#8212; <br />this methodology tends to  distort the GDP deflator and causes it to understate <br />inflation.  It happens every  time oil prices spike. </p>
<p>So the reported low 1.9% inflation rate should be taken with a  grain of salt <br />and viewed as a data distortion. </p>
<p>If the inflation rate is  really 3.8%, not I.9 % it strongly implies that the dominant<br />cause of the  economic and stock market weakness is higher inflation, <br />not supply chain  disruptions. </p>
<p>This analysis strongly reinforces my  belief that as long  as wage gains are as <br />weak as they are,  the economy can not sustain higher  inflation.  If and when <br />inflation accelerates it generates weaker economic growth, not  a self reinforcing <br />inflationary spiral.  </p>
<p>Moreover, unit labor cost is now rising faster than the non-farm business deflator.<br />Last year strong productivity and falling labor cost meant that firms could absorb<br />higher commodity  prices and still report strong earnings growth.  That is no longer<br />true. Firms now need to try to pass these cost increases through and the revised first<br />quarter data implies that business executives, economists and analysts are still<br />too optimistic about firms ability to raise prices.</p>
