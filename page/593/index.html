                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Well open threads are good enough for Kos and Duncan and both Matt and Ezra have opened up Assignment Desk threads so I might as well jump on the bandwagon.</p>
<p>I just got finished updating my index for this series at <a href="http://bruceweb.blogspot.com/2008/06/more-social-security-posts-from-angry.html">More Social Security Posts from Angry Bear</a> and see that XXXIII was exactly a week ago. While I have been mulling some ideas nothing super compelling comes to mind. So here is your shot to get the discussion going or perhaps suggest ways I could get the discussion going. In the meanwhile I am going to list some useful Social Security resources below the fold.</p>
<p>First it all starts with the <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/index.html">Reports of the Trustees of Social Security</a> Recent Reports are available in PDF, HTML and paper formats (delivered with free first class postage paid), older Reports are available in a variety of formats back to 1941. The Reports are a little daunting at first, probably the best way to approach them is through the <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/trLOT.html">List of Tables</a> which allows you first to examine the numbers and then scroll up or down to read the relevant text. The key tables are V.B1 and V.B2 which give you the economic projections, V.A1 which gives you demographic projections, VI.A4 historical operations back to 1957, and VI.F7 and VI.F8 which give you projected results out to 2085. Familiarize yourself with these and you too can be a Social Security maven.</p>
<p>Second you want to pay some homage to the godfathers. In 1999 Dean Baker and Mark Weisbrot published the ur-text <a href="http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/035468.html">Social Security: the Phony Crisis</a> of which the introduction is online via this link. In all honesty I never read the whole thing, by the time it came out I had pretty much formed my own line of thinking, but if you want some actual professionally trained experts takes on this and an explanation of why the &#8216;crisis&#8217; is &#8216;phony&#8217; (not &#8216;wrongheaded&#8217; mind you, but &#8216;phony&#8217; as in &#8216;fake&#8217;), this is probably the place to start. (Though the link failed to load this morning).</p>
<p>Third I would take a look at the single most useful visual guide to what I have been trying to convey. <a href="http://www.epi.org/content.cfm/issueguides_socialsecurity_changes">EPI: Changes in Trustees Projections over time</a>. The dates and numbers of Social Security are not static they are instead quite dynamic or were from 1997 to 2004 which is the span covered by this table. The point being that &#8216;crisis&#8217; language that might have been justifiable in 1996 became wildly outdated by 2004. Yet the rhetoric didn&#8217;t change even though the major players all knew the score. Which BTW fully justifies Baker and Weisbrot&#8217;s title &#8216;Phony Crisis&#8217;. EPI shows you why in a glance.</p>
<p>And to finish it all off Lee A. Arnold put up a first version of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tts2uTWt6e8">Social Security (Ecolanguage)</a> in 2005 and put up a slightly modified version on YouTube in 2006. It is an excellent animation that explains the basics.</p>
<p>If you want to see where Coberly and I are coming from and where we are trying to take people to you could do worse than reviewing these four critical sources.</p>

<blockquote><p>From the department of not a communist country: </p>
<p>             Cuba is to put more state-controlled farm land into private hands, <br />             in a move to increase the island&#8217;s lagging food production.</p>
<p>             Private farmers who do well will be able to increase their holdings by <br />             up to 99 acres (40 hectares) for a 10-year period that can be renewed.</p>
<p>             Until now, private farmers have only been able to run small areas of <br />             land.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>President (Raul) Castro, who took over from his ailing brother Fidel in February, considers reducing costly food imports as a matter of national security.</p>
<p>Since the 1959 revolution, some Cubans have been allowed to run small family farms. But most agriculture has been placed in the hands of large, state-owned enterprises.</p>
<p>&#8230;these (enterprises) have proved highly inefficient &#8211; half the land is unused and today Cuba imports more than half its needs. Rising world food prices will cost the country an extra $1bn this year.</p>
<p>The presidential decree was published in the country&#8217;s Communist Party newspaper, Granma. <br />This is good news. I think it was me who argued that the reason communism was so successful in Cuba was because it wasn&#8217;t communism. Of course, there is nothing in this that suggests long-overdue democratic reforms &#8211; but it does allow some level of economic freedom. I guess Raul Castro weighed up the advantages of increasing food production with the disadvantages of allowing a spread of market capitalism and worked out that food triumphed blind ideology.</p>
<p>The history of communism is very useful for us all to remember. Blind adherence to ideological dogma was based upon the assumption that Marx, Engels and Lenin were 100% correct in what they said, thus elevating them to demigods and their writings as inerrant and pure. But, as time went by, it became obvious that adherence to ideology did not result in the outcomes that were needed, namely a growing standard of living for all segments of society. Cuba, like China, has chosen the path of measured economic reform while maintaining a strong, authoritative government.</p>
<p>Raul Castro has obviously discovered that there is something good to be learned from capitalism. We who live in market-friendly capitalist economies also need to learn that there is something good to be learned from communism.</p></blockquote>

                                <p><a href="http://econ4obama.blogspot.com/2008/07/more-reflections-on-tax-duel.html">Don Pedro</a> lets loose what he really thinks about the supposed fair and balanced coverage of the fiscal policies of McCain v. Obama.  I’ll let others judge whether his general commentary hits a home run or is just biased in favor of Obama, but two statements reflect precisely a couple of things I’ve been saying since I began blogging:</p>
<blockquote><p>The only way he could make these promises add up would to largely dismantle Medicare and Social Security, while continuing to collect the payroll tax dedicated to the programs. It is inconceivable that Americans would stand for this.</p></blockquote>
<p>Under George W. Bush, we have opened up a large and persistent General Fund deficit that is unsustainable unless it is subsidized by raiding the “lock box”.  Bush’s supposed desire to save Social Security is in reality an attempt to drastically lower Social Security benefits without corresponding reductions in payroll “contributions”, which in reality is a backdoor employment tax increase designed to maintain the reductions in taxes on capital income.  Some of the debate on the Social Security gets around to conceding this fundamental point, but much of it is designed to disguise what is really going on.  But hey – bank robbers do not generally call in advance.  </p>
<p>Don Pedro continues by suggesting this fiscal fraud will fail, which would mean McCain’s proposed fiscal policies will be even more of a long-run fiasco than those of Bush’s.  He then adds this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Let&#8217;s say we pretend that McCain didn&#8217;t promise to balance the budget&#8211;then his program would be if anything a net negative for growth over the long term. While some research suggests that lower taxes paired with lower spending promotes growth (although this depends on particular circumstances, etc.), there is NO evidence for the proposition that tax cuts financed by debt promote growth.</p></blockquote>
<p>“Giving people their money back so they can consume more” as George W. Bush has suggested means less national savings, which crowds out investment.  The Reagan fiscal expansion had this effect.  The Bush43 fiscal expansion had this effect.  Let’s not pretend that a McCain fiscal fiasco would be any different.</p>

<p>Shorter <a href="http://meganmcardle.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/07/gored.php">McMegan</a>:<br />
<blockquote>I once heard these terms of art from the electricity industry.  No quizzes!</p>
<p>P.S., Al Gore is fat.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p>Update: Hoisted from comments&#8230;</p>
<p>Kolohe:<br />
<blockquote>A quick point for the negative team &#8211; the required* additions to the power grid, (i.e. new hv power lines, speficially 765 kV ones) will not really get started, much less be able to come on line in less than 10 years due to the (legitimate) length of the permitting process and (illegitimate) lawsuits brought by NIMBY&#8217;ers and uncomprimising environmentalists.</p>
<p>*required because the re-located power generating facilities (e.g. boone&#8217;s wind farm) do not currently have the capacity that electrical export regions (applachia, tenn/ohio valleys) currently do. See page 8 of this <a href="http://www.aep.com/about/i765project/docs/WindTransmissionVisionWhitePaper.pdf">pdf</a> &#8211; recently linked by the daily kos when discussing the 20% wind strategy &#8211; for one (industry) revised power distribution plan.</p></blockquote>
<p>gibbon1:<br />
<blockquote>Pretty much, Al Gore suggests collective action to build the infrastructure needed to handle solar and wind. The Liberations hear &#8216;collective action&#8217; which is &#8216;bad&#8217; and decide Al Gore is &#8216;one of those&#8217; and then proceed to make fun of him.</p>
<p>Me I made it half way through the comments and nary a mention of return on investment.</p></blockquote>
<p>CoRev:<br />
<blockquote>The issue with his proposal is maintaining a viable baseload. Wind and solar do not produce at any near peak capacity for days on end and when that happens where you gonna get your power? Who is going to maintain investment in that level of backup? maintain that level at peak? Actually test that level? And on and on.</p>
<p>So for the new sources to work we need nearly 100% of the old to back it up.</p></blockquote>
<p>ilsm:<br />
<blockquote>If only it were as hard for the US to waste a trillion in warfare state waste securing China&#8217;s oil flow as to fight the NIMBY world order.</p></blockquote>
<p>CoRev would do well to read the <a href="http://europe.theoildrum.com/node/4316">detailed post by Jerome a Paris</a> at The Oil Drum on a program to meet a substantial fraction of the Gore challenge via wind.  The key distinction is substitution of generation vs. generating capacity — a distinction also seemingly lost on McArdle.  Intermittent renewables provide the latter, which is what primarily matters for decarbonization, quite well.  That does require a fair amount of grid reinforcement, which will be a challenge for current opponents of long-distance transmission projects (who on the environmentalist side are often motivated by concern that they&#8217;re being asked to foot bills to import power from dirty-coal plants).</p>
<p>As for cost, I&#8217;ve been living the cost decreases for wind generation.  At the beginning of the year, the green-power premium we&#8217;d been paying dropped from 2.7 cents/kWh to 1 cent.  Net of an increase in the base dirty-power rates, we still saw a price decrease of more than 1 cent/kWh on our electric bill.  So the green electricity is not ruinously expensive by any means, and the premium plus the production tax credit comes to about $30/ton of CO2 reduction.</p>

<p>He wants a committee to decide reimbursement rates.</p>
<p>This made me think about an <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2008/07/tough-times-pro.html">idea I got from Mark Thoma</a></p>
<p>Mark Thoma <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2008/07/smart-cost-shar.html?cid=123811540#comment-123811540">linked </a>to the even more verbose version of this at my other blog.  He has an interesting comment thread.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;preventative care &#8230; ought to be encouraged, and one way to help with this is &#8230; to forge an unbreakable lifetime relationship between the insurance company and the consumer so that expected lifetime costs are important to the insurance carrier. </p></blockquote>
<p>I strongly suspect (with no evidence) that Thoma&#8217;s thoughts were influenced by <br />an empirical result that very small financial incentives to doctors based on their patients&#8217; blood  glucose caused big changes in those outcomes <a href="http://www.cmwf.org/usr_doc/beaulieu_bcs_diabetesdiseasemanagement_610.pdf">(pdf warning).<br /></a> which will save huge amounts of money for medicare but small amounts of money for the HMO&#8217;s that introduced the incentives. </p>
<p>I think the best we can do is to charge medical costs not just to the current insurance plan but also, in part, to the one that covered the patients in the past (to give the an incentive to keep their clients healthy).  </p>
<p>If insurance companies saw obese people with horrible eating habits who watch TV all day as a profit opportunity, the USA would be a healthier place. </p>
<p>Just think, sleazy insurance agent hangs around bars and then calls his boss to say &#8220;Right in front of my eyes, I have a guy who must way 300.  He&#8217;s on his 4th whiskey, has emptied 2 bowls of bear nuts in the past five minutes and he&#8217;s chain smoking camels, we got to move fast before our competitors sign him&#8221;.</p>
<p>[line above updated for punctuation and to add details plus a homonym to celebrate the fact that <a href="http://matthewyglesias.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/07/impractical_scheme_of_the_day.php">Matthew Yglesias linked</a> to <a href="http://rjwaldmann.blogspot.com/2008/07/ezra-klein-writes-about-smart-cost.html">this post</a> (the homonym was honestly accidental.  In fact, there were not one but to honest homonyms &#8212; I typed &#8220;too add details&#8221; two before correcting it, witch just goes to show how thrilled eye am.]</p>
<p>To try to explain better</p>
<p>My plan is the Edwards plan plus insurance companies pay for care of former clients based on alpha(cost of the treatment)*(years with that company)/(age at time of care) where alpha is well below one and for the care of current clients minus the part paid by former insurers.  They get paid a constant which depends only on the region where they are located times the same alpha factors.</p>
<p>Thus they have an incentive to keep their clients healthy (which they can pass on to doctors).</p>
<p>Plus they get paid based on progress on preventive measures (patients who quit smoking, got blood pressure from x down to y, lost weight from obese to not obese etch)funded with a tax on insurance companies per patient so on average they get zero.</p>
<p>This means they would be more willing to sign fat lazy smokers as there is lots of room for improvement compared to things as they are.</p>

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Earlier today in discussing auto prices I&#8217;m afraid I did not explain myself very well.<br />Let me use actual data and see if I can do better.</p>
<p>Because the CPI is quality adjusted what it is showing is the price of buying an earlier model  car, if you could.  In the chart above I set the base at 1975 so the CPI is saying that from 1974 to 2007 the price of buying a 1974 car rose from 100 in 1974 to 216.2 in 2007, or 116%.</p>
<p>Over this time the average transaction price for a new car rose from $4,859 in 1975 to $23,336.<br />This is a 371% increase &#8212; the index rose from 100 to 471.  I could not quickly find the data to update the suggested retail price data.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SIoNJq8LMrI/AAAAAAAAAUU/WKsIQFfPU4M/s1600-h/Clipboard01.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SIoNJq8LMrI/AAAAAAAAAUU/WKsIQFfPU4M/s320/Clipboard01.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a><br />The difference between a 116% price increase and the 371% increase is what you actually have to spend to buy a new car.  By using the CPI data Carpe Diem was implying that the average consumer was getting a real raise because the CPI data shows that auto and light truck quality adjusted prices fell in the 1990s.  To a certain extent this is true.  But in other ways it is not true<br />because the consumer is unable to buy an earlier model car.  What the consumer has to buy is the car that is offered in the market place today and the actual price the consumer faces is the average transaction price.  Part of the differences is what the consumer has to buy in the market place that is not counted in the CPI as a quality improvement.  For example the standard radio in an auto use to be a simple AM  radio.  Now it is a AM-FM radio.  Another example is that today&#8217;s autos are much more durable.  A quarter century ago about the only car on the market that was still in very good shape after 100,000 miles was a Volvo.  But it was an expensive car.<br />Now, essentially every car can reasonably be expected to still be a good car after 100,000 miles.<br />But this change is quality is not incorporated into the CPI quality adjustment.</p>
<p>The Carpe Diem argument that because the CPI for new cars had fallen over the past decade the consumer has gotten a real raise is only partially true because the consumer can not go into the market place and buy the earlier model car.  What consumers have to actually spend is the average transaction price whether they want to or not. So going back to the data on the chart above, the average sum the average consumer spent on a new car rose 371%, but out of this increase some 116% represented quality improvements, so the real price increase was 155%.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still afraid I made the correct point here, but maybe the discussion can clear it up.</p>
<p>P.S.  In rethinking this the difference between the 116% in the CPI for autos and 371% increase in the average transaction price is how much of a quality improvement in cars the BLS estimates happened.  The BLS says the average 2007 car is 255% better in quality than the 1975 car.</p>

                                <p>In partial response to <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/07/new-place-new-stories.html">Cactus&#8217;s post</a>, <a href="http://meganmcardle.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/07/this_post_by_cactus_doesnt.php">Megan McArdle</a> offers the &#8220;look at those low air fares&#8221; defense of airline deregulation, going so far as to suggest:<br />
<blockquote>I think it&#8217;s telling that complaints about deregulation of the airlines come almost entirely from three groups of people:</p>
<p>1)  People who have no idea what they are talking about<br />2)  Affluent people<br />3)  People who fly a lot for work  </p></blockquote>
<p>The story being that (2) and (3) aren&#8217;t price-sensitive and other critics of deregulation are just know-nothings or whiners (or both).</p>
<p>Not so fast.</p>
<p>The conceptually correct comparison is <i>not</i> with 1978 airfares, but rather with whatever current airfares would be under a reasonable forecast of airfares absent deregulation but with whatever other changes would have happened anyway.  Recall, Robert William Fogel was given his share of the Bank of Sweden prize in significant part for cementing this &#8220;counterfactual&#8221; (or <i>ceteris paribus</i>) analysis as the standard methodology of economic history.</p>
<p>This is a non-trivial matter for airfares as deregulation was implemented during an oil price spike, and its subsequent golden age to roughly 9/11/01 was a period marked by a very long decline in the real price of oil — not to mention cost-reducing technological change from sources such as cockpit automation and the deployment of high-bypass-ratio turbofans to the single-aisle airliners that are the workhorses of the U.S. domestic fleet.  So not all of the secular airfare decline (or what&#8217;s left of it) is properly attributed to deregulation.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.esri.go.jp/jp/archive/bun/bun150/bun143a-e.pdf">One source</a> [PDF] suggests that deregulation accounted for around 60% of the observed fare-level decline to 1993 using the old CAB pricing formula as the benchmark, and that 30% of flyers paid higher fares under deregulation.  Don&#8217;t get me wrong, this isn&#8217;t bad, and the liberal in me can&#8217;t help but say that taking money from airline investors and corporate travel budgets and turning it into air transportation for the middle- to upper-middle classes beats many other deregulatory outcomes (at until the system blows up).  Still, it isn&#8217;t Pareto-improving, and by the standards of, say, repeal of the upper-income Bush tax cuts, the disaffected class is pretty big, though.  We aren&#8217;t just talking about the &#8220;affluent&#8221; and ultra-frequent flyers.</p>
<p>Moreover, would-be Fogels looking for an icon-smashing result that may also be true could try to figure out whether <i>modern</i> systems of rate regulation would perform better than the late CAB.  So once we consider what Barry Ritholtz amusingly calls &#8220;<a href="http://bigpicture.typepad.com/comments/2008/07/hedonics---or-d.html">dedonics</a>&#8221; (*) issues like service levels and qualities, the need to keep the industry somewhat stable until alternative modes of fast intercity travel are (re)developed, and so on, I submit that the true benefits of deregulation are at least a matter for careful study.</p>
<p>(*) It&#8217;s amusing even though it isn&#8217;t true that all quality adjustments in CPI are for quality improvements.</p>

I hope some of our friends see the irony of such claims about Social Security if they dislike these statements.</p>
<blockquote><p>The CBO has released a report detailing the effects of indexing the the AMT to inflation (i.e. &#8220;patching&#8221; it so that fewer households would pay it than otherwise anticipated) and extending the 2001-2003 Bush tax cuts without offsetting the revenue loss. </p>
<p>If the Bush tax cuts are allowed to expire and if the AMT continues its ever-deepening reach into the middle class, the federal debt held by the public will increase from today&#8217;s 37 percent of GDP to 115 percent in 2050. If AMT is indexed for inflation to limit its impact on the middle class, that debt figure becomes 115 percent in 2050. If the AMT is indexed for inflation and the Bush tax cuts are extended, federal debt held by the public jumps to 190 percent in 2050.<br /> (Source: Congressional Budget Office) </p>
<p>Deficit financing of these tax cuts has a pernicious effect, reducing per capita income by 13 percent in 2050. But, &#8220;[b]eyond 2073, projected deficits under those tax policies would become so large and unsustainable that CBO&#8217;s model cannot calculate their effects.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>What economics would you teach kids?</p>
<p><a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/07/econ-ed-for-kids.html">Rdan points</a> to a ‘National Budget Simulation’ program that is apparently part of Massachusetts economics education for grades 4-12. I was surprised when I clicked on the link because the federal budget seems like a really strange place to start economics education.</p>
<p>It seems important to start economics education with the economics concepts that kids can actually use in their lives. If I had control over what economics some kids learned in school, I think this would be my list:</p>
<p>Opportunity cost<br />Gains from trade<br />Incentives<br />Importance of trade offs<br />Emphasis on the idea that everything has value (time, money, lack of garbage, etc.)<br />At a more advanced level</p>
<p>Marginal thinking<br />Efficiency of markets<br />Interest rates, Net Present Value<br />Consumption smoothing<br />I also think it would be useful to teach Utility and Expected Utility, but I don’t think it is possible to get to those topics.</p>
<p>Arnold Kling had post on a similar topic a while back.</p>
<p>As a side note, I think I would like to replace most of pre-calculus with basic probability theory from a Bayesian perspective with some heuristics and biases thrown in. Probability theory is a useful abrstraction for all sorts of problems, and it would also make that optional statistics class a lot less difficult if you could teach it from a bayesian perspective.</p></blockquote>
<p>I was a little surprised myself to see the link, and pleased. I was planning to write a post on kids and must have left the link on &#8216;scheduled&#8217; and jsalvati delightfully picked it up. He and a friend are undergraduates who started <a href="http://goodmorningeconomics.wordpress.com/">Good Morning Economics</a>.</p>
<p>As jsalvati noted, <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2007/07/high_school_cur_1.html">Arnold Kling at EconLog</a> wrote that after eliminating things from the high school curriculum:</p>
<blockquote><p>With all that said, here is what I wish every high school student would learn about economics:</p>
<p>&#8211;the concept of opportunity cost<br />&#8211;how economic incentives affect behavior<br />&#8211;the gains from trade<br />&#8211;how prices allocate resources<br />&#8211;how entrepreneurs introduce innovation</p>
<p>If every citizen understood those things, the level of debate over economic policy could be much higher.</p></blockquote>
<p>The link is to a section of <a href="http://www.doe.mass.edu/mailings/2008/cm012508.html">Thinkfinity MA</a> series sponsored by Verizon. I will be a part of of a state based team that provides <a href="http://www.thinkfinity.org/home.aspx">an opportunity</a> to develop curriculum materials for kids elementary to high school.</p>
<p>I am on a &#8220;validation of resources team&#8221; scheduled for this Aug. 7 to find out what is expected and to meet both state educators (curriculum and technology sectors) and those doing the validating.</p>
<p>As I gather information I will update and link to other sites that are interesting.</p>

<blockquote><p>Then considering that average hourly earnings have increased by almolst [sic] 40% over the last ten years, the real prices of those products have fallen by an even greater amount, a HUGE amount. In other words, there are many, many products like computers, cameras, new cars, clothing, TVs, appliances, electronics, software, etc. that are significantly cheaper today than ten years ago, especially after adjusting for increases in earnings.</p></blockquote>
<p>The increase in nominal earnings over the past decade was 38.6% while the reported increase in the CPI was 33.5% so by this data, real earnings have increased by only 3.8% over the past decade.  This is not a HUGE increase.  Unless you don’t eat consume a lot of electronic products and have figured out how to drive that new car without buying gasoline.</p>
