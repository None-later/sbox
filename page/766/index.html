                                <p><a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/horsesmouth/2007/11/flashback_hilla.php">Greg Sargent</a> notes that Tim Russert’s being doing gotcha to Hillary Clinton for a long time:</p>
<blockquote><p>Since the Dem debate a few days ago a lot of people have understandably been taking shots at Tim Russert for his often small-minded &#8220;gotcha&#8221; questions and his constant references to Bill Clinton. Some Hillary backers are seething about Russert; indeed, in a conference call with big donors, Hillary pollster Mark Penn and other supporters repeatedly gripe about Russert&#8217;s approach, with one supporter saying that he &#8220;should be shot.&#8221; It&#8217;s worth noting, however, that there&#8217;s a long history here. Russert has been trying to catch out Hillary with &#8220;gotcha&#8221; questions about Bill and other things for years now &#8211; in fact, his efforts to do this date all the way back to Hillary&#8217;s first Senate campaign in 2000. And then, as now, the Hillary folks were mighty pissed off with him. The bad blood goes way back.</p></blockquote>
<p>At first I thought that the suggestion that Russert be shot was extreme.  But Russert has been an embarrassment to journalism for way too long.  This has nothing to do with the candidacy of Hillary Clinton.  It has everything to do with the pathetic path that some in journalism have been taking over the past several years.  Maybe the execution of the hacks might make us look like some terrorism regime, but something needs to be done to restore real journalism in this nation.  If Russert never did another NBC event again – NBC would be much better off.  Then again – firing the hack would be a perfectly legitimate thing to do. </p>
<p>While we are on the subject of the media, <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/10/29/a-test-case-for-the-media">Paul Krugman</a> notes that the dishonesty of Rudy Giuliani presents a test case for the media:</p>
<blockquote><p>OK, Rudy Giuliani has just released an ad claiming that the survival rate from prostate cancer is much higher in America than in Britain, thus proving the failure of socialized medicine. The problem is that his claim is just plain false. In fact, mortality rates from prostate cancer are almost the same in America and Britain. So, will this get as much attention as, say, the Edwards haircut or the Hillary laugh? Will it get any coverage at all? Bear in mind that health care is the central domestic issue of this election &#8211; and Rudy has just showed that he doesn’t know a thing about it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Or maybe Rudy does know that his claim is false but he assumes that reporters like Tim Russert will not call him on his dishonesty.  Worked twice for George W. Bush and Dick Cheney!</p>

<blockquote><p>On September 6, 2007, Senators Charles Grassley (R-IA), the ranking member of the Committee on Finance, and Herb Kohl (D-WI), chairman of the Special Committee on Aging, introduced the Physician Payments Sunshine Act — so named because it aims to &#8220;shine a much needed ray of sunlight on a situation that contributes to the exorbitant cost of health care,&#8221; according to cosponsor Senator Charles Schumer (D-NY). The bill would require manufacturers of pharmaceuticals and medical devices with annual revenues of more than $100 million to disclose the amount of money they give to physicians — whether in the form of a free dinner or vacation or a consulting fee. &#8220;This bill is about letting the sun shine in so that the public can know,&#8221; says Grassley.<br />The move was stimulated in part by activity in Minnesota and Vermont, which have made the reporting of such relationships mandatory — Minnesota in 1993 and Vermont in 2003. Three additional states (Maine, West Virginia, and California) and the District of Columbia have now enacted similar disclosure laws, and many other states are considering doing so. Although beliefs vary widely about the overall usefulness of the data collected under state mandates, the movement toward increased transparency is gaining steam.</p></blockquote>
<p>Some transactions are proprietary, some are not. A more benign form of government interference is a call for more transparency&#8230;the payments are not forbidden, just announced. Let the public decide and the doctor explain.</p>

<blockquote><p>An American military lawyer and veteran of dozens of secret Guantanamo tribunals has made a devastating attack on the legal process for determining whether Guantanamo prisoners are &#8220;enemy combatants&#8221;.<br />The whistle blower, an army major inside the military court system which the United States has established at Guantanamo Bay, has described the detention of one prisoner, a hospital administrator from Sudan, as &#8220;unconscionable&#8221;.<br />His critique will be the centrepiece of a hearing on 5 December before the US Supreme Court when another attempt is made to shut the prison down. So nervous is the Bush administration of the latest attack – and another Supreme Court ruling against it – that it is preparing a whole new system of military courts to deal with those still imprisoned.<br />The whistle blower&#8217;s testimony is the most serious attack to date on the military panels, which were meant to give a fig- leaf of legitimacy to the interrogation and detention policies at Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay. The major has taken part in 49 status review panels.<br />&#8230;..<br />The army major has said that in the rare circumstances in which it was decided that the detainees were no longer enemy combatants, senior commanders ordered another panel to reverse the decision. The major also described &#8220;acrimony&#8221; during a &#8220;heated conference&#8221; call from Admiral McGarragh, who reports to the Secretary of the US Navy,<br />&#8230;<br />Two other military lawyers have also gone public. In June, Army Lt-Col Stephen Abraham, a 26-year veteran in US military intelligence, became the first insider to publicly fault the proceedings. In May last year, Lt-Com Matthew Diaz was sentenced to six months in prison and dismissed from the military after he sent the names of all 551 men at the prison to a human rights group.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whistle blower&#8217;s in the Federal system put themselves in serious jeopardy when they go public and are named. The Protection Act has about 3-4% win rate in the special court for what looked to be serious allegations, the Guantanamo issue being a small part of the statistics.</p>
<p>I do not think BDS would be enough motivation to come forward, since you are sure to be punished in a bi-partisan manner eventually when the spotlight is turned off. Most do not write books, and end their careers in their departments. (Except for the celebrities of the genre).</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>I had a post recently in which I wondered aloud&#8230; are the reduced casualties we&#8217;re seeing in Iraq a sign the Surge is working, or a sign that ethnic/sectarian cleansing is working?  I noted a simple test&#8230; if reduced violence is due to US policy, moving those who fled back to their homes won&#8217;t cause a renewed spike in violence&#8230;</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a story in today&#8217;s <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/middleeast/la-fg-violence1nov01,0,7149617.story?coll=la-home-center">LA Times</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Iraq&#8217;s civilian body count in October was less than half that at its height in January, reflecting both the tactical successes of this year&#8217;s U.S. troop buildup and the lasting impact of waves of sectarian death squad killings, car bombings and neighborhood purges.</p>
<p>October also marked the lowest monthly death toll for American troops, 36 fatalities, since March 2006, when 31 were killed, according to icasualties.org.</p>
<p>American commanders credit the buildup, which reached full strength in June, with slowing sectarian bloodshed.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>But others say that the picture is more complicated than that because those seeking to cleanse their neighborhoods of rival religious sects have largely succeeded. The civilian death toll plummeted nationwide in the last two months; the toll was 2,076 in January but 884 in September and 758 in October, according to the Iraqi Health Ministry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everyone in our neighborhood is Sunni, even the birds flying above us are Sunni,&#8221; said Mohammed Azzawi, a resident of the once mixed district of Ghazaliya.</p>
<p>A year ago, his street was a battleground between Shiite and Sunni militants. Now it is segregated between its Shiite northern tip and its Sunni south.</p>
<p>Moreover, American forces have felt it necessary to make tacit deals with groups that have been involved in the sectarian cleansing, and many Baghdad residents who have not been killed have fled. The number of people displaced internally in Iraq has risen to 2.25 million, and an additional 2 million have left the country.</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly the presence of [U.S.] soldiers in insecure neighborhoods in Baghdad could stabilize the neighborhood, resulting in less violence and fewer people fleeing the neighborhood,&#8221; said Dana Graber Ladek, Iraqi case officer for the International Organization for Migration. &#8220;In addition, as neighborhoods become homogeneous, violence is likely to decrease and fewer people are likely to flee these areas.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Over four million people fled, out of a population of less than 30 million.  And then there are those who died.</p>
<p>And this is what success looks like:</p>
<blockquote><p>American military leaders say that Iraq and its capital, where much of the sectarian violence has taken place, are significantly safer than during the height of Shiite-Sunni warfare last year &#8212; although even at its reduced level, the violence takes a toll of nearly 200 deaths a week.</p></blockquote>
<p>And this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Baghdad&#8217;s Rashid district, for example, was once an area with a majority Sunni population. After years of violence, its population is about 70% Shiite.</p>
<p>Securing the area has meant coming to an understanding with the same militia responsible for expelling the Sunnis, American officials acknowledge.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the reality of western Rashid,&#8221; said Army Lt. Col. Patrick Frank, whose battalion is responsible for the area. &#8220;Everyone we deal with is&#8221; a member of the Mahdi Army, he said.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>The Mahdi Army has turned the west Baghdad neighborhood of Hurriya into a haven for Shiites driven out of nearby Sunni areas like Adil during last year&#8217;s sectarian cleansing. The local militia had also expelled its own Sunni population. Now the Mahdi Army rules the area in cooperation with the U.S.-sponsored neighborhood council.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you hear of stealing cooking gas, tanks, cars or motorcycles in the Shiite areas? There is none. It never happens. It is very rare. This is because of the Mahdi Army,&#8221; said resident Hazim Muhsin.</p>
<p>And in the largely Sunni enclave of Ghazaliya, residents say the protection they receive from American troops has made a world of difference. Where Shiites were forcibly and bloodily evicted, Sunni men now stay outside till 10 or 11 p.m., sitting in lawn chairs. The light spills outside from a barber shop open late. One night, a string of cars from a wedding party drives down the street, passengers honking their horns.</p>
<p>&#8220;I expect to live in Ghazaliya the rest of my life. This is our home,&#8221; Azzawi said. &#8220;Now that it is pure Sunni, it is better for us.</p></blockquote>
<p>You know, if we had dropped a few nukes on Baghdad and it was nothing but paved glass, there would be a lot of people touting the reduced violence as a success story.</p>

<p>Over-education. <br />In the very chaotic system we have in the U.S. of matching people to careers, there is inevitably some element of mismatch.  There is concurrently a mantra that more education is better, if not a panacea, and of course, globalization is supposed to mean workers in the United States will move to being Knowledge Workers.  With this in mind, consider the implications of a <a href="http://ideas.repec.org/p/dgr/umaror/2005009.html">Dutch study</a> which, if I am to interpret it correctly, concludes that you are a happier and better worker if you are in a job for which you are undereducated for, than if in one for which you are overeducated.</p>
<p>The study summarizes,<br />
<blockquote>This adds to the relevance of preventing overeducation, and shows that being employed above one&#8217;s level of education contributes to workers&#8217; cognitive resilience.</p></blockquote>
<p>I was alerted to this study by the observations at <a href="http://www.portfolio.com/views/blogs/odd-numbers/2007/08/16/the-limits-of-education">Limits of Education</a>.</p>

<p>Reading <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/asection/la-oe-richards29oct29,1,1278901.story?ctrack=3&#038;cset=true">The Adoption vs. Abortion Myth</a> this morning, pointed to from <a href="http://www.salon.com/mwt/broadsheet/2007/10/31/adoption_and_abortion/index.html">Salon&#8217;s Broadsheet</a>.  Evidently it is widely accepted that there is no correlation between abortion and relinquishing-up-for-adoption rates.  I was out of the loop on this one.  I had no idea.</p>
<p>I will admit to being a bit biased toward wanting there to be a correlation, because, from a philosophical and political standpoint, it is very convenient.  I have had some very sincere and earnest discussions with Fundamentalists, and this &#8220;3rd way&#8221; (pushing for more Adoption rather than outlawing Abortion) seemed to be something we could agree upon.  Last I heard, this was also Hillary Clinton&#8217;s angle. </p>
<p>So, I&#8217;m wanting some in-depth analysis of whether there is a correlation. </p>
<p>I would love to hear some Economists analyze the HHS figures, with some introspection perhaps into issues with data collection.  I do know that there is a strong drop in the number of adoptions after the Roe v. Wade decision in the early &#8217;70&#8217;s, although it then seems to level out.  The data is probably fraught with issues of collection problems due to &#8220;black market&#8221; and other institutional changes, especially when comparing pre-1973 data to post-1973.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also the matter of looking at other country&#8217;s data.</p>

                                <p>The Census has data on <a href="http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/histinc/h01ar.html"> real median income from 1967 to 2006</a> by quintile.  It shows the income level of the first four quintiles, and the bottom of the top 5% of income earners.  Here’s what it looks like for selected years:</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RykwYx0ThOI/AAAAAAAAAz4/VaLgpAYJo_A/s1600-h/real+income+table+1.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RykwYx0ThOI/AAAAAAAAAz4/VaLgpAYJo_A/s320/real+income+table+1.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Here’s what the annualized growth rates look like.  I’ve taken the liberty of color coding the negatives gray.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RykxCx0ThPI/AAAAAAAAA0A/h6ieDCTm3yY/s1600-h/real+income+table+2.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RykxCx0ThPI/AAAAAAAAA0A/h6ieDCTm3yY/s320/real+income+table+2.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>The data seems to have some serious Bush Derangement Syndrome&#8230; the Old Bush comes in dead last in every category, and the New Improved Bush comes second from the bottom in every category.  One might also notice that all the negative growth seems to coincide with a Bush in the White House.  The data also goes some way toward showing why much of the American public isn&#8217;t all that pleased with the economy despite all the good news touted on the National Review.</p>

<p>Update&#8230;  </p>
<p>1.  The &#8220;real median income&#8221; is provided in 2006 prices.<br />2.  Note that there are two tables on the Census page.  The top one shows the same data in nominal prices.</p>

<blockquote><p>Still, fewer people are planning on celebrating Halloween in 2007, according to the National Retail Federation survey. Around 59 percent will celebrate Halloween this year, compared to the nearly 64 percent that celebrated last year. Rist said that the drop-off occurs due to tightening economic conditions. However, those celebrating plan on spending more than they did last year, an average of around $65 per person, driving retail spending up to $5.07 billion from last year&#8217;s $4.95 billion.“The folks that are continuing to participate are going to spend more,” Rist said.</p>
<p>What are consumers spending the most on? Their creativity. The average person, according to the National Retail Federation&#8217;s poll of 8,877 consumers nationwide is expected is expected to spend $23.33 on Halloween costumes this year, though 18- to 24-year-olds plan to be the most festive, spending $34.06 on costumes. Industry-wide, that&#8217;s around $1.8 billion. Candy is second, with consumers shelling out nearly $1.57 billion on sugary treats. 95 percent of consumers say they expect to purchase candy.</p></blockquote>
<p>I hope that we are doing more creativity than the article indicates.  New costumes seem to be highly muscled Spidey or Batman sorts of things, or the new slutty look.  Maybe only in the burbs?</p>
<p>When in middle school, my two boys would build a haunted house in the cellar with different themes (ghoulish dungeon, horrible science experiments, movie themes)with maybe six friends weeks in the making, then families would come by to see, bringing some food along.  Then the trick or treating and Unicef collecting (which appears to be out of favor).</p>
<p>It was also a time when several dads walked around, left in the dust and dark, for a couple hours of real conversation.  Rare indeed for dads in my experience.</p>
<p>To put a real scare into kids this year I am handing out twinkies, moonpies to old folk.  Happy halloween.</p>

                                <p>Over at <a href="http://econospeak.blogspot.com/2007/10/behind-2007q3-preliminary-gdp-growth.html">EconoSpeak</a>, I briefly discussed the latest news about GDP growth and a few details.  Yesterday morning, I had to endure a stupid tirade from our <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2007/10/20071030.html">Liar-in-Chief</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p>They have not been able to send a single annual appropriations bill to my desk … Spending is skyrocketing under their leadership &#8211; at least proposed spending is skyrocketing under their leadership.</p></blockquote>
<p>BEA does not count proposed spending.  To say spending bills have not passed but spending is skyrocketing is beyond stupid – even for the village idiot we call President.  Sorry for the shrill tone but George Bush lied in so many ways – how wait, let’s have <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21562052">Keith Olbermann</a> step up to the microphone:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our fifth story on the COUNTDOWN, the president‘s petulance against Congress, against Democrats, against anybody else he sees thwarting his own id devolving last week‘s buffoonish door slamming to a level meriting the use of the word tantrum.  He has today accused his critics of wasting his time &#8230; And by agreement, Mr. Bush means do it his way.  By fiscally responsible he means, spend $200 billion and no questions asked on just the coming year in Iraq</p></blockquote>
<p>Keith had a lot more splicing and dicing of Bush’s lies but the real star goes to Dana Milbank:</p>
<blockquote><p>Certainly on the merits, it sounds a bit absurd, yes, that the spending bills haven‘t been passed and largely because the Republicans have block them from being passed.</p></blockquote>
<p>The House passes a bill, the Democrats in the Senate get a few moderate Republicans to support it, but then Mitch McConnell filibusters on behalf of the White House.  For the President to blame Congress for the delays is classic Bush BS.  But I think Keith Olbermann nailed it when he suggested that Bush wanted more war spending and less spending on health insurance for the working poor.  Permit me to expand on this comment with some real world numbers from the BEA:</p>
<blockquote><p>Government purchases grew by 3.7 percent at annualized rate almost entirely because of defense spending growth. One has to wonder why our neocon President had his temper tantrum yesterday morning.</p></blockquote>
<p>Comparing 2007QIII figures to 2007QI figures – all in nominal terms on an annualized basis we see that nondefense Federal purchases grew from $311.7 billion to $316.6 billion, while defense purchases grew from $634.8 billion to $672.6 billion.  The former represents a 1.6 percent nominal increase over six months or an annualized real increase less than 1 percent.  The latter represents a 6 percent nominal increase over six months or an annualized real increase greater than 9 percent.  Facts don’t lie even if our President does.</p>
