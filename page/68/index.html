                                <p>I am aware of the internet tradition called the <a href="http://kfmonkey.blogspot.it/2005/10/lunch-discussions-145-crazification.html">27% Crazification Factor</a> which is <a href="https://www.google.it/search?q=27%25+crazification+factor&#038;rlz=1C1FDUM_enIT485IT485&#038;aq=f&#038;sugexp=chrome,mod=9&#038;sourceid=chrome&#038;ie=UTF-8">undead and wel</a>l</p>
<p>But can we get a solid lower bound on the sane (OK really well informed) factor ?  For example, there was the <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/nytdocs/docs/192/192.pdf#page=23">February 2010  New York Times CBS News poll in which 12% of respondents correctly noted that Obama and the Democrats had (at the time) decreased taxes for most Americans</a></p>
<p>Now we have <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/weeklypolling/2012/9/20">a DailyKos SEIU PPP poll</a> in which a grand total of 11% of respondents report that they paid no Federal Income tax on 2011 income. </p>
<div><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-KhQfUFAsCrk/UGIn9HXfMrI/AAAAAAAAAPU/wj-LIZIqTWA/s1600/sane11.JPG" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="138" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-KhQfUFAsCrk/UGIn9HXfMrI/AAAAAAAAAPU/wj-LIZIqTWA/s640/sane11.JPG" width="640"></a></div>
<p>OK more than 53% of people paid positive income tax (it&#8217;s 47% of tax paying units without positive liability and they are more than proportionally single member families students and widows and a smaller number of widowers).  So in addition to the roughly (but less than) 36% who are just wrong there are somewhat more than 53% who correctly answered &#8220;yes&#8221; and might *might* have answered correctly even if the correct answer had been no. </p>
<p>OK OK this is a poll of likely voters so  47 percenter impoverished. But still 11 % !!!*</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>But that&#8217;s not the fun part.  The fun part is that Romney does better among the small subset of 47 percenters who actually know they are 47 percenters than he does among those who think they paid income taxes.</p>

<p>Wow look at that.  Behind 3% among self identified members of the group he calls deadbeats and behind 5% among self identified tax payers. </p>
<p>*I, by the way, am a 47% because of the foreign earned income exclusion although I pay huge amounts of Italian income tax by US standards (but almost all of my income comes from Italian taxpayers so I can&#8217;t complain).</p>

                                <p>Matt Yglesias, servitor to our corporate overlords, suggests that the  reduced capital gains tax rate paid by rentiers like Willard Romney is  really a very, very good thing.  <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2012/09/21/mitt_romney_s_effective_tax_rate_is_very_low_most_economists_think_it_should_be_.html">To wit</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The  main reason Romney&#8217;s effective rate is so low is that the American tax  code contains a lot of preferences for investment income over labor  income. <br />.   .   .   <br />But  this is definitely an issue where the conservative position is in line  with what most experts think is the right course, and Democrats are  outside the mainstream. <br />.  .  . <br />That&#8217;s  the theory, at any rate. It&#8217;s a pretty solid theory, it&#8217;s in most of  the textbooks I&#8217;ve seen, and it shapes public policy in basically every  country I&#8217;m familiar with. Even researchers like Thomas Piketty and  Emmanuel Saez (see &#8220;A Theory of Optimal Capital Taxation&#8221;) who dissent  from the standard no taxation of investment income position think  capital income should be taxed more lightly than labor income.  Empirically, it&#8217;s a bit difficult to verify that variations in capital  gains tax rates and the like really are making a material difference to  investment levels. But then again the data is noisy.</p></blockquote>
<p>Scott Lemieux at LGM <a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2012/09/the-unpersuasive-case-for-not-taxing-capital-income">demurs</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Sure,  if you 1)accept the premise that reducing or eliminating capital gains  taxes will result in productive infrastructure investments rather than  worthless accounting tricks, 2)ignore the economic benefits created by  consumption, 3)assume that significant numbers of people will forgo  money for doing nothing just because the profits will be taxed , and  4)ignore the fact that in most jurisdictions consumption is also “double  taxed,” then reducing capital gains taxes looks good.   But since all  of these assumptions are (to put it mildly) highly contestable, it’s  just question-begging.</p></blockquote>
<p>My  response to Matt is that in my jaundiced opinion, you might as well  consult The Necronomicon of Abdul Alhazred as an economics textbook for  an issue like this; and that in a world that has on the one hand  Krugman, Thoma and Delong, and on the other Fama, Cochran and Cowan, a  consensus among experts is about as likely as lions lying down with  lambs for some purpose other than a quick snack.</p>
<p>To Scott I say, why assume or ignore anything when that oh-so-noisy data is readily available?</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Graph  1 shows the capital gains tax rate and year-over-year growth in gross  domestic private investment (GPDI,) each presented as a percent.  If  Matt and what he calls &#8220;the mainstream&#8221; are right, then there should be a  negative correlation between the tax rate and investment growth, since  higher taxes would be a disincentive to investment.</p>

<p>Instead,  what we find is that over time, as the capital gains top rate has gone  down, so has GPDI.  This is indicated by the downward slope of the best  fit straight lines through each data set.  The best fit lines are based  on the data through 2008, so the huge 2009 negative in GPDI is not  represented.</p>
<p>One way to handle noisy data is to  superimpose a moving average.  The dark heavy line that snakes up to a  top in 1978 is an 8-Yr moving average.  This top corresponds exactly  with the last year of the 40% Cap Gains Tax rate.  The purple horizontal  line is the period average of GPDI YoY growth from 1954 through 2011.    Note that until 1986, the 8 Yr line is mostly above the long average  line, and since 1986 it is mostly below.</p>
<p>This is not  because the bottoms in the GPDI data set are lower since 1986.  A quick  look shows that, except for the 2009 plunge, they are not.  It is  because the peaks are lower.  The table gives a count of extreme data  points for GPDI growth, before and after 1982, the year the Cap Gains  rate was reduced to 20%.</p>

<p>Even  at a detail level, it appears that a higher tax rate corresponds with a  higher rate of investment growth, as both curves peak in 1978.</p>
<p>Graph 2 provides a close-up view of 1985 through 2005.</p>
<p>
<div><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-8KT7mIf1Klo/UGHi4wvWP0I/AAAAAAAAB9k/GHnzKhEs8PY/s1600/Cap+Gains+and+GDPI+2.jpg"><img border="0" height="287" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-8KT7mIf1Klo/UGHi4wvWP0I/AAAAAAAAB9k/GHnzKhEs8PY/s400/Cap+Gains+and+GDPI+2.jpg" width="400"></a></div>
<div>Graph 2  C G Tax Rate and GPDI, 1985 &#8211; 2005</div>
<p>When  the Cap Gains tax rate was increased from 20 to 28% in 1987, the rate  of investment growth increased from 1.4 to 5.2%, and stayed at about  that level until it was derailed by the 1990-91 recession.  Then from  1992 through 2000, 8 of 9 years had GPDI growth above the long average  (purple line,) an unprecedented occurrence.  Granted, the last three of  these years were at the lower C G Tax rate of 21.19%, instituted in  1998.  But also note that this decrease did absolutely nothing to spur  increased investment.</p>
<p>Cutting across the data in a  different way, Graph 3 presents a scatter plot of the C G Tax Rate and  YoY GPDI growth, each presented as an 8 Yr average.</p>
<div><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_MmgjO9HFoU/UGHp1nzNlSI/AAAAAAAAB94/OXqbBGbXzg0/s1600/Cap+Gains+and+GDPI++3.jpg"><img border="0" height="286" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_MmgjO9HFoU/UGHp1nzNlSI/AAAAAAAAB94/OXqbBGbXzg0/s400/Cap+Gains+and+GDPI++3.jpg" width="400"></a></div>
<div>Graph 3 Scatter Plot of GPDI Growth vs C G Tax Rate, Smoothed</div>
<p>Even  with smoothing, there&#8217;s a lot of scatter.  No surprise, since many  other factors can affect investment: business cycle, commodity price  shocks, wars, etc.  I&#8217;m tempted to say the obvious relationship is that a  higher C G Tax rate leads to higher investment, but I don&#8217;t want to get  into a correlation-is-not-causation brouhaha.  So I&#8217;ll simply say that  the idea that lowering C G taxes leads to increased investment &#8211; and  therefore increased economic growth &#8211; is not only unsupported by the  data, it is refuted by the data, and therefore contrary to fact. </p>
<p>So, once again, we find a mainstream economic idea that is only valid in some imagined alternate reality.</p>
<p>Capital Gains Rate data can be found <a href="http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxfacts/displayafact.cfm?Docid=161">here</a> (Returns With Positive Net Capital Gains Table, 1954-2008) and <a href="http://www.ctj.org/pdf/regcg.pdf">here</a>.   There are a few slight discrepancies between these sources, mostly in  transition years.  I have used the maximum tax rate, column farthest to  the right in either table.<br />Gross Domestic Private Investment is FRED series <a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?g=b2e">GPDI</a>.</p>

                                <p>Jason Shafrin over at the Healthcare Economist <a href="http://healthcare-economist.com/2012/09/20/hospital-consolidation-prices-and-quality/" target="_blank">point</a>s to this recent <a href="http://www.rwjf.org/content/rwjf/en/research-publications/find-rwjf-research/2012/06/the-impact-of-hospital-consolidation.html" target="_blank">paper</a> over at the RWJF. Interestingly the authors find that hospital consolidation increases prices and could decrease quality. Something that many of us have considered in the past.</p>
<p>In concentrated markets, the effects were even more pronounced with price increases over 20% noted.</p>
<p>Competition was noted to increase quality under an &#8220;administered&#8221; pricing system, ala the NHS in the UK. The evidence for competition increasing quality in a market system was much more mixed.</p>
<p>I have thought this for some time, and have even wrote about the concepts of leverage in the past. For example, I have cited a BNET article before. When one examines the the health markets in Milwaukee and Chicago, which are both midwestern cities, and geographically close to each other, one finds higher prices in Milwaukee, with providers not accepting less than 200% of Medicare. Which does not seem intuitive, as there is far more market competition in the health insurance industry there. In Chicago, one insurer, BC-BS, is rather dominant and prices are lower, with providers accepting 112% of Medicare on average. It would seem to make sense that increasing the leverage of the hospitals and providers through the mechanism of consolidation will increase prices. The same thing happens in Milwaukee, which has no dominant insurer, and therefore is unable to exert leverage over the hospital systems in Milwaukee.</p>
<p>The ACO models as proscribed by the ACA will increase consolidation. By developing an accountable model of care delivery, providers will attempt to consolidate to increase quality and minimize risk exposure in the sense of decreasing reimbursements.</p>
<p>The problem with the RWJF paper, as it rightly notes, is that the study does not really examine integrated health care systems. When you look at consolidation with true vertical and horizontal integration, it is my belief that quality improves even in the absence of competition. True integration in the case of Mayo Clinic and Kaiser also lowers prices.</p>
<p>In essence, I don&#8217;t think the problem is consolidation&#8230;..I think the problem is consolidation in the absence of integration.</p>

                                <p>The always-brilliant J. W. Mason’s <a href="http://jacobinmag.com/2012/09/in-defense-of-david-graebers-debt/">response</a> to what in my opinion is a quite befuddled Mike Beggs <a href="http://jacobinmag.com/2012/08/debt-the-first-500-pages/">review</a> in <em>Jacobin </em>of David Graeber’s <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=GYhajCQU8XIC&#038;printsec=frontcover&#038;dq=graeber+debt&#038;source=bl&#038;ots=A3CWfoHGFS&#038;sig=WY8Jc54swZhd9R6GqmKATbpG8IY&#038;hl=en&#038;sa=X&#038;ei=irtcUKSxCqiXiALdxoCQDA&#038;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&#038;q&#038;f=false"><em>Debt: The First Five Thousand Years</em></a> prompts me to tackle a subject that I’ve been worrying at for a long time: Money. </p>
<p>I’ve been worrying at it despite (or because of) endless reading spanning centuries of money thinkers, reading that has brought me to the conclusion that economists don’t have an even-vaguely coherent or agreed-upon definition of what money is. No: saying that it “serves three purposes” — store of value, means of exchange, and unit of account — does not a definition make. Not even close. In my opinion, that fumbling tripartite stab at something vaguely definition-like actually takes us farther from, and obfuscates, any useful definition.</p>
<p>It’s not uncommon to find leading economists of all stripes — even deep money thinkers like Randall Wray — using vague, quasi-technical terms like “moneyness” and “money-like.” They don’t seem to have a tight technical definition that they can rely upon others to understand and use synonymously. cf., Decades, centuries of inconclusive argument on the proper definition(s) of “the money supply,” and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_supply#Empirical_measures_in_the_United_States_Federal_Reserve_System">various definitions thereof</a>.</p>
<p>What is arguably the most important word in economics remains undefined or at best variously and inconsistently defined — and used.</p>
<p>We find this “money confusion” in the center of J. W.’s response, where he addresses the theoretical (and historical) tangles surrounding commodity, fiat, and credit money — a quagmire he illuminates nicely, but doesn’t manage to untangle. He continues (emphasis mine):<br />
<blockquote>“It is odd,” Mike says, “that Graeber claims that ‘you can no more touch a dollar or a deutschmark than you can touch an hour or a cubic centimeter’ – because there actually are things called dollars you can touch, carry around in your wallet, and spend.” And, “however far credit may stretch money, it still depends on a monetary base: people ultimately expect to get paid in some form or other.” And, most decisively, “What circulates [as money] need not be a physical thing, but it is a thing in the sense that it cannot be in two places at once: when a payment is made, a quantity is deleted from one account and added to another. That the thing that is accepted in payment may be a third party’s liability does not change this fundamental point.” These are all, quite simply, statements of Friedman’s quantity theory of money, refuted by generations of Post Keynesian economists but still carrying on its zombie existence in the textbooks.<br />Open your wallet again: Yes, you see things called dollars, but most likely you also see a piece of pallastic labeled Visa or Mastercard. This is money too — you can buy almost anything with t that you can buy with the bills. When you do so, new monetary liabilities are created on the spot, linking you to your bank and your bank to the vendor. Nothing is deleted from anywhere. You do, of course, have a credit limit, but that depends on what you’re buying an who you are buying it from, and it can rise or fall for all sorts of reasons without changes in anyone else’s. This is the fundamental difference between fiat and commodity money, on the one hand, and credit money on the other. There is a fixed quantity of the former but not of the latter. Now if the maximum volume of credit that could be created by banks was closely linked to their holdings of gold or state tokens, it wouldn’t make a difference; and thanks to various regulatory and other constraints, this was more or less true for much of the 19th and 20th centuries. But it is not true today. <strong>The idea of money as a “thing” that you “carry around” is fundamentally wrong as a description of today’s monetary system.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>This fundamental wrongness (if it is indeed wrong) is inscribed right at the top of the Wikipedia <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money">article</a> on money, and in almost every economist’s understanding of the concept (bold mine):<br />
<blockquote>Money is any <strong>object</strong> or record that is generally accepted as payment  for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goods_and_services" title="Goods and services">goods and services</a> and repayment of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debts" title="Debts">debts</a>…</p></blockquote>
<p>And the Money Supply <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_supply">entry</a> explicitly acknowledges the definitional problem:<br />
<blockquote>There are several ways to define “money,”</p></blockquote>
<p>I don’t think Graeber is completely right in his characterizations of money, Beggs completely doesn’t get it, and Mason doesn’t go go far enough. Despite common usage, that idea of money as a “thing” that you can carry around is not a useful technical economic definition for discussing <em>any</em> monetary system. It doesn’t allow us to think about money or money economies coherently.</p>
<p>Imagine if physicists didn’t have a solid definition of energy — if they meant slightly (or wildly) different things when they referred to it, sometimes hewing to some vernacular usage, sometimes silently assuming various technical definitions. Or if one was never sure which definition they were using in any given discussion. Or if two physicists arguing were frequently using different implicit definitions, and often weren’t even aware of it. Or if they shifted their own (implicit) definitions within the course of a discussion, often even within a single sentence?</p>
<p>Physics discussions would be in the same kind of eternally inconclusive mess that economics is in, and has been in for centuries.</p>
<p>I want to suggest a definition in which a dollar bill is <em>not money</em>. It’s a definition that I’m finding to be conceptually useful, tractable, and applicable to much of the good economic thought that has emerged over the centuries (emerging, amazingly, even in the absence of such a definition). Neither is a gold coin money, and neither is a balance in your checking account. Economists have been unable to disentangle themselves from that common, vernacular usage. What they (we) need is a term of art, a technical term that is clearly defined and uniformly deployed. As with many terms of art, such a definition is likely to bear little or at best only a glancing resemblance to everyday usage.</p>
<p>So if a dollar bill isn’t money, what is it? It’s a <em>financial asset</em>, as are gold coins, bank deposits, bonds, stocks, collateralized debt obligations, and so on and so forth, <em>all of which</em> embody or represent money. Ditto bank reserves. (This last is important because reserves are — for sensible reasons, within the definitional vacuum that economics inhabits — excluded from almost all definitions of the money supply. Nevertheless, they’re financial assets that embody money, in a complicated institutional way. They have very special properties, different from other financial assets.)</p>
<p>So what is money? Let’s take a look at the physics definition of energy, and see if it might be a useful guide. Here from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy">Wikipedia</a> (which at least has the virtue of not being widely disagreed with; otherwise it would be rewritten):<br />
<blockquote>In physics, energy … is an indirectly observed quantity that is often understood as the ability of a physical system to do work on other physical systems.</p></blockquote>
<p>That’s a pretty heady conceptual definition. Does something similar work with money? Try this:</p>
<div>In economics, money is a quantity that is often understood as value that can be exchanged for real-world goods and services.</p>

<p>Or a simpler version: money is <em>exchange value.</em><br /><em><br /></em>Like energy, under this definition money cannot exist except as manifested in some embodiment — for energy, a gallon of gas, fields/waves/particles propagating through the void, or a boulder at the top of a hill; for money, some financial asset. Absent such an embodiment, energy and money do not even, cannot even, exist. (Though exchange value obviously can.)</p>
<p>Money in this definition does not exist except as it is embodied in financial assets. But that doesn’t mean that financial assets — even dollar bills – <em>are</em> money.</p>
<p>If you’ve got a battery in your pocket, do you say you’re carrying “energy”? You could, but you don’t because you know that you’re carrying a battery that <em>embodies</em> or <em>contains</em> or <em>holds</em> energy. You understand the conceptual distinction between the battery and the energy.</p>
<p>But when you have a dollar bill in your pocket, you <em>do</em> say, “I have money in my pocket.” You don’t make the distinction — that the bill and the money are <em>conceptually different things</em>.</p>
<p>Ditto with bank deposits: they are legally enforceable claims. They’re not “money” (in this definition). And other financial assets: we commonly say “how much money” do you have? What we really mean is “what is the net value of your financial assets?”</p>
<p>Let’s go back to the key word in the physics definition of energy, and in my definition of money: “quantity.” What does <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantity">Wikipedia</a> tell us about that word?<br />
<blockquote><strong>Quantity is a property</strong> that can exist as a magnitude or multitude. Quantities can be compared in terms of “more”, “less” or “equal”, or by assigning a numerical value in terms of a unit of measurement. Quantity is among the basic classes of things along with quality, substance, change, and relation. Being a fundamental term, quantity is used to refer to any type of quantitative properties or attributes of things. Some quantities are such by their inner nature (as number), while others are functioning as states (properties, dimensions, attributes) of things such as heavy and light, long and short, broad and narrow, small and great, or much and little.</p></blockquote>
<p>So by this definition, money is a quantitative property. A property of what? I would say: financial assets. Those assets have other properties as well: exchangeability (in different markets), confidence, volatility, etc. All those properties are mutually interrelated in ways that I will not delve into here, and those other properties all affect the quantitative property — money — that is embodied in all financial assets.<br />It seems to me that economists’ failure to make that conceptual distinction between money and financial assets makes it impossible to discuss the economics of a money-based economy coherently, or understand such an economy properly. They end up talking about things like “the demand for money” and “the market for money” (instead of “the markets for different financial assets”) — which are at best vague and at worst meaningless phrases under this definition — when what they really mean, what they really need to discuss, is shifting preferences/demand for different types of financial assets that have different properties – <em>all</em> of which assets embody “money.” (Also: the forces driving changing substitution preferences among these different asset classes and properties of different asset classes — substitution being the <em>sine qua non</em> of demand curves.)</p>
<p><em>By this definition</em>:
<div><strong>Money is not a store of value.</strong> Financial assets are stores of value, with the value quantity designated in terms of money, which in turn is designated in terms of a particular unit of currency.</div>
<div><strong>Money is not a medium of exchange.</strong> Physical currency is a medium of exchange, as are the legal obligations that we refer to as bank balances. Within the financial industry there are many other units of exchange. Though it’s rare for them to be exchanged directly for real-world goods and services, they can be exchanged for things (bank balances) that can be so exchanged, so it’s quite reasonable to view them as embodying “money.”</div>
<div><strong>Money is not a unit of account.</strong> Currencies are units of account. (“Currencies” in the conceptual rather than physical or particular sense of that term — “the dollar,” not “dollar[ bill]s.”)</div>
<p>I’m proposing a very abstract, term-of-art definition here, one that is far removed from most understandings of “money.” But look at the physics definition of energy, above. Does it have the kind of simple, intuitive clarity that we feel when we say “I’m full of energy today” or “I have money in my pocket”? Not even close. The definition is actually quite hard to understand. Nevertheless, it seems to have served its purpose very well over the centuries.</p>
<p>I have a lot more I’d like to say on this subject — for instance on the egregiously sloppy and criminally vague usages of the term “capital” throughout economics writing — but I want to stop here and see if my gentle readers find any value in this thinking, whether they can contribute to my muddled and ever-groping understanding of how (money) economies work.

<blockquote>
<p>I agree with Chye-Ching <a href="http://www.offthechartsblog.org/new-study-no-evidence-that-high-end-tax-cuts-help-the-economy/">Huang</a>, who agrees with the Congressional Research <a href="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/news/business/0915taxesandeconomy.pdf">Service</a>, Len <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/leonardburman/2012/03/15/capital-gains-tax-rates-and-economic-growth-or-not/">Burman</a>, and <a href="http://jaredbernsteinblog.com/more-on-cap-gains-and-investment/">me</a>: over the long, historical record of <strong>special tax treatment for investment incomes and tax cuts to the top marginal tax rates, one simply doesn’t find significant correlations with greater investment, savings, productivity, or income growth.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Everything he cites here is about U.S. tax and growth rates — a single sample point though a long-term one — all of which is subject to the big secular thing: growth was faster pre-Reagan, and Dems were in power pre-Reagan, so the numbers just represent that secular decline (the great innovation stagnation?), not the effect of policies. It’s amazing that Republicans never make this argument, which is pretty tough to counter. But that’s mainly because they don’t even know, much less acknowledge, that growth has declined since Reagan took office. This argument ignores the boom and surplus under Clinton, of course (of course that boom was attributable to New Gingrich), but <em>besides that</em> it’s a tough argument to disprove.</p>
<p>The far more convincing demonstration, in my opinion, is <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/u-s-versus-europe-whos-winning-now.html">this</a>: comparing the U.S. to Europe over forty years.</p>
<p>Roughly the same population.</p>
<p>Roughly the same level of prosperity.</p>
<p>One taxing 40% of GDP, the other taxing <30%.</p>
<p>Difference in growth rates: nonexistent.</p>

<p>Every State&#8217;s State/Local Tax System Taxes the Poor More than the Wealthy&#8211;And All Exceed Federal Taxes</p>
<p> A <a href="http://www.itep.org/pdf/poverty2012report.pdf">new report</a> from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (ITEP) shows that in every state in the country, the bottom 20% of households pay more of their income in state and local taxes than does the top 1%. Washington state was the worst, where the bottom 20% pay a whopping 17.3% of their income in state and local taxes. This was followed by Florida at 13.5% and Illinois at 13.0%. Though the report hints at an exception, a reading of their appendix shows that the only one is the District of Columbia.<br />    <br />As the report points out, such high taxation increases the burden of poverty on the people who, by definition, can least afford it. Moreover, this runs counter to the federal tax system, which in its overall effect (see table below) is progressive. On average, the top 1% pay federal taxes equal to 30% of their income, compared to 1.1% for the lowest 20%.<br />    <br /><img alt="undefined" border="0" height="467" hspace="0" src="http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/background/distribution/images/progressive.gif" width="513"><br />Source: <a href="http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/background/distribution/progressive-taxes.cfm">Tax Policy Center</a>    </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Between these two reports, we can see that the bottom 20% of taxpayers pays a much higher portion of their income in state and local taxes than they do in federal taxes. ITEP therefore recommends four major policies to make state and local taxation less regressive.    </p>
<p>1) Enact a refundable earned income tax credit for state income tax;    <br />2) Enact property tax circuit-breaker caps for all low-income taxpayers, including renters;    <br />3) Enact other refundable income tax credits for childless households below the poverty level;    <br />4) Enact or increase child tax credits, and make them refundable.    </p>
<p>Of course, it should go without needing to be said, but to make federal tax more progressive (think of Mitt Romney and his tax rate below the average 15.1% paid by those in the third income quintile), we should tax capital gains and carried interest the same as ordinary income.</p>

                                <p>Bill McBride at <a href="http://www.calculatedriskblog.com/">Calculated Risk</a> does his usual excellent job of reporting economic data;</p>
<p>He just reported the state unemployment rates and published a chart comparing the current rate with each state&#8217;s peak rate.</p>
<p>One very significant point that popps up in this chart is that Michigan and Ohio appear to have had the greatest improvement in their unemployment rates since their unemployment rates peaked.  I think this is an important thing to consider when we evaluate the impact of the auto bailout and why Obama appears to be leading in the Presidential polls in those two states. </p>
