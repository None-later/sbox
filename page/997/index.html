                                                                    </div>

                                <p>The <a href="http://www.taxfoundation.org/publications/show/1321.html">Tax Foundation</a> says yes:<br />
<blockquote>When the federal statutory corporate income tax rate of 35 percent is added to the weighted average of state corporate income taxes, the resulting rate of 39.3 percent means that corporations in the United States are currently at an international competitive disadvantage. In fact, as recent research has indicated, the top combined state and federal statutory corporate income tax in the U.S. is higher than any other country in the OECD.</p></blockquote>
<p>Tax Analysts quotes one of the authors as saying the following:<br />
<blockquote>Many who propose taxing energy companies more heavily than other firms, with a windfall tax, believe that these firms somehow escape normal taxpaying requirements, leaving other industries to carry a heavier load. </p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, this statement is not what many of us who suggested a windfall tax said.  It is also interesting that the authors focused on integrated oil and gas producers such as Chevron Texaco, Conoco Phillips, and Exxon Mobil as opposed to companies such as Unocal that are predominantly in the business of extracting and selling crude oil.  Even for the integrated producers, the accountants allow an expense for depreciation and depletion, which <a href="http://www.econbrowser.com/archives/2005/10/oil_company_pro.html#more">James Hamilton</a> describes thusly:<br />
<blockquote>For one thing, oil companies face a significant degree of depletion of existing oil fields and depreciation on previous capital investments, meaning huge investments are required just to maintain the status quo. Standard accounting conventions recognize this by subtracting depreciation and depletion as an operating expense, with the presumption being that the investment that would be necessary in order to maintain current production would be counted as a regular business expense rather than something one needs to pay for out of profits.</p></blockquote>
<p>For Unocal in its last full fiscal year, this allowance was almost $1 billion reducing profits before taxes to $1.83 billion.  But my point about accounting profits was less these deductions for items that are not current cash outflows as much as the failure to distinguish between accounting profit and economic profit.  Companies such as Unocal earn a significant amount of economic rent when the price of oil rises well above the cost of production. </p>
<p>Dr. Hamilton has taken an interest in the exploration and production of oil from <a href="http://www.econbrowser.com/archives/2005/12/oil_sands.html#more">oil sands</a>. In his <a href="http://www.econbrowser.com/archives/2006/01/are_the_oil_com.html">Are the oil companies earning enough profits yet?</a>, he proposes a couple of approaches to the fact that the cost of producing oil from these sources is substantial:<br />
<blockquote>Plan A is to have our elected government officials make a wise decision about what&#8217;s the best source of energy for the years ahead, find the tax dollars to pay for it all, and make sure it all gets produced and delivered on schedule.  Plan B is to imagine that the desire to make a profit is so powerful that companies would be willing to invest billions of dollars trying to make oil out of sand.</p></blockquote>
<p>While Plan A may sound like socialism to some, I’m interested.  Plan B asks us to rely on the free market, which makes sense to me.  Of course, the pure free market solution with a single tax rate on accounting income – regardless of whether it is economic rent or the return to capital – means that those lucky enough to already have substantial reserves of oil that is cheap to produce will receive very high profits even after the traditional income taxes that the Tax Foundation thinks are too high.</p>

                                <p>The brave, brave men and women of the Republican party have decided that <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/02/01/AR2006020100329.html">federal spending must be cut</a>, and they have courageously decided that those who have it too easy in this country, those who need to make the sacrifices for the greater good are the poor, the elderly, single mothers, and students:<br />
<blockquote>The House yesterday narrowly approved a contentious budget-cutting package that would save nearly $40 billion over five years by imposing substantial changes on programs including Medicaid, welfare, child support and student lending.</p></blockquote>
<p>Note that this effort has nothing to do with reducing the budget deficit, since Congressional Republicans also hope to pass additional tax cuts this week that will increase the deficit by more than these ignoble, shameful spending cuts would have reduced it.  </p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_comment/edwards200602010908.asp">Chris Edwards</a> picks on the Girlie-man Governor from my state for his claim that state governments are spending too much:<br />
<blockquote>State tax revenues jumped 8.7 percent in 2004 and about 8 percent in 2005. About three-quarters of state governments had tax-revenue growth of 6 percent or more in 2005. What will the states do with their overflowing coffers? During the revenue boom of the 1990s, states allowed their budgets to bloat as they expanded programs such as Medicaid to unsustainable levels. When the recession hit in 2001 and revenues stagnated, state officials moaned that they were innocent victims of a fiscal crisis. They responded by hiking taxes and clamoring for more aid from Washington.  Only a few years into the current boom, some states are already making the same mistake of overspending. In California, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has proposed a budget increase for fiscal 2007 of 8.4 percent, which follows a 9.7 percent increase in 2006. This is the same governor who, in 2003, said, “if you spend, spend, spend, then you have tax, tax, tax, but all of a sudden you say, ‘Where are the jobs?’ Gone, gone, gone.” In seeking reelection this year, Schwarzenegger has found a new interest in “spend, spend, spend.” The governor of Maryland is taking the same approach as he seeks reelection. Robert Ehrlich has proposed a huge budget increase for fiscal 2007 of 11.4 percent, which follows a 7.6 percent increase in 2006. Otherwise sensible policymakers &#8211; such as these governors &#8211; apparently think that there is no harm in allowing spending to rise rapidly during booms, as long as tax rates aren’t increased.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’ve been known to blast my governor for his promises to spend more, tax less, and reduce the budget deficit as well.  But let’s check the data as far as how the share of GDP that goes to state and local government purchases has evolved since 1990, which is represented by the blue line of our graph.  State &#038; local purchases were 11.6% of GDP in 2000 – just as they were in 1990.  This ratio did increase to 12.2% by 2003 but declined in 2004.  Edwards, however, is referring to overall government spending, which includes transfer payments.  Overall state &#038; local spending, which is represented by the purple line, increased to 13.5% of GDP as of 2001 and was still 13.5% of GDP in 2005.  </p>

<p>I’m delighted that we have partially recovered from the 2001 recession and that tax revenues are creeping back up.  In California, we still have large deficits as our governor refuses to either reduce spending or to raise tax rates.  But to suggest that state deficits in general are due to runaway spending is to show how one is either ignorant of the facts or all too willing to misrepresent the issues.  So much for my attempts to be kind to the National Review.</p>

                                <p>Peter Gosselin and Joel Havemann of the <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-health1feb01,0,6880489.story?coll=la-headlines-nation">LA Times</a> do a good job today picking through the bits and pieces of the White House&#8217;s policy proposals regarding health care, and putting them together:<br />
<blockquote>WASHINGTON &#8211; President Bush wants to bring to healthcare the same &#8220;ownership society&#8221; approach that gained him little political traction during last year&#8217;s Social Security debate but remains central to his self-help view of America.</p>
<p>By proposing new tax breaks for the health savings accounts he won congressional approval for three years ago, analysts said, Bush hopes to nudge the nation away from the employer-sponsored health insurance on which most working Americans depend. Instead, Bush wants to use sweeping new tax incentives to encourage workers to set aside their own money to cover routine medical expenses and get individually purchased insurance plans to meet larger costs.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, Bush&#8217;s vision ignores the fact that there are fundamental market failures (e.g. <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/04/asymmetric-information.html">asymmetric information</a>) inherent in the market for health care, and that these market inefficiencies make it likely that market-based solutions to the US&#8217;s health care problems will be not deliver an efficient outcome.</p>

Had anyone listened to Tim Russert on the Today Show, they might have another view.  Russert claimed that the fact that the number of folks on retirement may double in the next several years means we have to either double the payroll tax rate or drastically reduce benefits.  I guess Russert never heard of the concept of pre-funding.  Now you might argue that the massive General Fund deficit means all those Trust Fund reserves have been squandered by the fiscal irresponsibility of this White House.  In fact, this White House makes this very argument in defense of its Social Security deform proposals.  </p>
<p>So do we need another Presidential commission on this issue?  Not if they are going to misrepresent the issues like the last one appointed by this President.  Kash is correct that economists have studied this issue and put forth a menu of reasonable solutions.  The problem is that certain politicians are being less than honest about this issue, while certain reporters (e.g., Mr. Russert) act as if they know what they are talking about when clearly they do not.  <a href="http://www.google.com/custom?q=social+security&#038;sa=Google+Search&#038;cof=AH%3Acenter%3BAWFID%3Ac32a032061318778%3B&#038;domains=dailyhowler.com&#038;sitesearch=dailyhowler.com">Bob Somerby</a>, however, has been on the task for demanding better coverage of this issue even since <a href="http://www.dailyhowler.com/h041098_1.shtml">April 1998</a>.  Since Bob is especially hard on Mr. Russert, it may be the case that Mr. Russert refuses to read his columns.  Until he does so – can we request that NBC cease to ask Mr. Russert about his incredibly ill-informed opinions on this important issue?</p>

                                <p>There was something familiar to me about this part of Bush&#8217;s <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/31/AR2006013101468.html">SOTU address</a> last night:<br />
<blockquote>[T]onight I ask you to join me in creating a commission to examine the full impact of baby boom retirements on Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.</p>
<p>This commission should include members of Congress of both parties and offer bipartisan solutions. We need to put aside partisan politics and work together and get this problem solved.</p></blockquote>
<p>Oh yah, now I remember what this reminded me of: Ross Perot in 1992!  From the 1992 Presidential Debates:<br />
<blockquote>Q: how would you specifically use the powers of the presidency to get more people back into good jobs immediately?</p>
<p>PEROT: Step one, the American people send me up there, the day after election, I&#8217;ll get with congressional&#8211;we won&#8217;t even wait till inauguration, and I&#8217;ll ask the president to help and I&#8217;ll ask his staff to help me. And we will start putting together teams to put together&#8211;to take all the plans that exist and do something with them. Please understand. There are great plans lying all over Washington nobody ever executes.</p>
<p>&#8230;<br />Q: I would like from each of you a specific response as to what you intend to do for retirees relative to [Social Security and Medicare] &#8211; not generalities but specifics, because I think they&#8217;re very disturbing issues.</p>
<p>PEROT: On the broad issue here, when you&#8217;re trying to solve a problem, you get the best plans. You have a raging debate about those plans. Then out of that debate, with leadership, comes consensus.</p>
<p>&#8230;<br />Q: I want you to tell me how you&#8217;re going to be able to get the Republicans and Democrats in Congress to work together better than these two gentlemen.</p>
<p>PEROT: Oh, I&#8217;m sorry. Well, I&#8217;ve listened to both sides, and if they would talk to one another instead of throwing rocks, I think we could get a lot done.  I&#8217;d say rather than just yelling at one another, why don&#8217;t we find out where we&#8217;re apart, try to get together, get the bill passed and give the people the benefits and not play party politics right now&#8230; That&#8217;s the way I would do it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Bush seems to be proposing the Perot solution to these problems: we just need to put partisanship aside, work together, have a commission study it, and the problem will be solved!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m just curious about one thing.  What exactly will we learn from the President&#8217;s new commission about the impact of the baby boomers&#8217; retirement on Social Security and Medicare that we don&#8217;t already know from these reports:
<ul>
<li>&#8220;<a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TRSUM/trsummary.html">Status of the Social Security and Medicare Programs</a>&#8220;, Office of the Actuary, Social Security Administration.</p>
</li>
<li>&#8220;<a href="http://www.cms.hhs.gov/ReportsTrustFunds/01_Overview.asp">The Medicare Trustees Report</a>&#8220;, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
</li>
<li>&#8220;<a href="http://www.treas.gov/offices/economic-policy/social_security.html">Social Security and Medicare Trust Funds and the Federal Budget</a>&#8220;, Office of Economic Policy, Dept. of Treasury.
</li>

</ul>
<p>&#8230;among numerous, numerous others.</p>
<p>When will it actually be time to put forward some new solutions to these well-documented problems?</p>

                                <p>Keeping with my New Year’s resolution, let me say BRAVO to <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/ponnuru/ponnuru200601310806.asp">Ramesh Ponnuru</a> for this:<br />
<blockquote>But conservatives are almost certainly overestimating how much good “earmark reform” can do &#8230; Critics of Alaska’s “bridges to nowhere” have pointed out that it makes no sense for the Congress to fund such dubious projects at the expense of, say, fixing the levees in the Gulf coast. But merely eliminating the earmarks for those bridges didn’t solve that problem. Most federal highway funding is allotted to each state according to a complicated formula. Getting rid of the earmarks didn’t reduce federal spending, or even reduce Alaska’s allotment &#8230; Are there reforms short of outlawing earmarks that could be worthwhile? Sure. Requiring congressmen to disclose which projects they are responsible for funding is one. But don’t expect this reform to save a lot of money &#8230; Riedl thinks that an addiction to pork changes what those incumbents want. “Pork changes your entire approach to your job.” He estimates that adjusting for inflation, federal spending has gone up 29 percent since 1995 while federal spending on earmarks has gone up 164 percent. (They’re still, by his estimate, less than two percent of the budget.)</p></blockquote>
<p>To be fair to Mr. Ponnuru, I’ve selected the portions of his op-ed that concede the cutting earmarks will have at best a very modest effect on overall spending.  There is a lot more to his piece worth reading besides his recognition that reducing earmarks or even reducing pork will not solve the massive Federal budget problem by itself.  I just hope the NRO Financial types pay attention to the fact that Mr. Ponnuru actually understands the simple arithmetic of the Federal budget.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>As a follow up to my last post about <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/01/us-health-care-system-administrative.html">administrative costs in the US health care system</a>, let me take a moment to address the following hypothetical question: what could we really expect if the US moved from its current system to a single-payer system?  </p>
<p>Theoretically, there&#8217;s no clear answer to this question.  On the one hand, it&#8217;s possible that people in the US would consume more health care services than they already do if they didn&#8217;t have to fight private insurance companies over every payment, which could cause health care spending to rise.  In addition, millions of people in the US who currently lack health insurance would be insured, possibly encouraging them to consume more health care services.</p>
<p>However, one could reasonably argue that some of the additional health care services consumed (particularly by those who are currently uninsured) would be more preventative in nature, thus reducing health care costs for problems that are more seriously developed.  A study by the <a href="http://www.iom.edu/CMS/3809/4660/12313/12327.aspx">Institute of Medicine</a> estimates that providing health insurance to the uninsured would save perhaps $130bn by replacing expensive hospital visits by the uninsured with far cheaper treatments  at earlier stages of illness.  (See Paul Krugman&#8217;s discussion about <a href="http://www.nwanews.com/bcdr/Editorial/30187/">diabetes</a> for another example.)  </p>
<p>Furthermore, the administrative costs that I discussed earlier would plausibly be reduced dramatically, perhaps by hundreds of billions of dollars per year.  These types of savings would have to balanced against the increased consumption of health care services.</p>
<p>Since there are theoretical forces that would make a single-payer health system both more expensive and less expensive, the best we can do is look at examples from other countries to try to gauge which force would be larger.  Much has been written about how health care spending in countries with nationally-provided health insurance is <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/04/health-care-in-us-and-world-part-i-how.html">lower than in the US</a>, though their <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/04/performance-of-us-health-care-system.html">health outcomes are as good or better</a> than in the US.  Note as well that <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/04/waiting-for-health-care.html">waiting times</a> are not necessarily any higher in countries with single-payer health care.</p>
<p>As another useful data point we can examine the case of Taiwan, a country that replaced a collection of different insurance schemes with a <a href="http://www.pacificbridgemedical.com/publications/html/TaiwanMay98.htm">National Health Insurance</a> program in 1995.  The percent of Taiwanese with health insurance rose from about 60% in 1994 to 96% a few years later.  It turns out that in Taiwan&#8217;s case, the forces that would increase costs roughly balanced the forces that would decrease costs.  A study in <a href="http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/phcf/Papers/does%20universal%20health%20insurance%20make%20health%20care%20unaffordable.pdf"><em>Health Affairs</em></a> reported the following:<br />
<blockquote>Our data show that Taiwan was able to adopt the NHI without using measurably more resources than what it would have spent without the program. It seems that the additional resources that had to be spent to cover the uninsured were largely offset by the savings resulting from reduced overcharges, duplication and overuse of health services and tests, transaction costs, and other costs.</p></blockquote>
<p>These pieces of evidence suggest that a single-payer health insurance plan does not typically raise health care spending in the aggregate.  If anything, the evidence suggests that single-payer systems are cheaper than the US&#8217;s system.  While this is not conclusive evidence for what might happen if the US were to adopt a single-payer plan, it does seem to place the burden of proof on those who would argue that such a plan would increase medical spending in the US.</p>
<p>However, the reasons to adopt a single-payer system are not only, or even primarily, economic.  The moral case for nationally-provided health insurance is at least as important, albeit one without data for me to measure or graph. </p>

                                <p>Why are health care costs <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/04/real-crisis.html">so high in the US</a>?  Some possible explanations include medical malpractice insurance, improving (but also more expensive) <a href="http://www.annals.org/cgi/content/abstract/142/11/932">medical technology</a>, the desire by people to simply <a href="http://macroblog.typepad.com/macroblog/2006/01/we_are_richer_t.html">spend more of their income</a> on health care services as their income rises, and large and increasing administrative costs.</p>
<p>If he addresses the question of high medical spending at all in his State of the Union address tonight, Bush is likely to focus solely on the medical liability insurance explanation (though I’m willing to be pleasantly surprised on this).  His proposed solution to this problem is tort reform.  Unfortunately, <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2004/09/bushs-solution-to-rising-health-care.html">as I’ve written about previously</a>, non-partisan estimates suggest that tort reform is likely to produce only a small decline in health care costs, of perhaps $6 billion per year, out of total medical care spending of $1,878 billion in 2004.  That&#8217;s not much of an impact.</p>
<p>So let’s consider a more substantial contributor to the US’s extraordinary health care spending: administrative costs.   </p>
<p><strong>How Big is the Bureaucratic Burden?</strong></p>
<p>We have a couple of estimates of how high administrative costs are &#8211; i.e., expenses incurred by the health care system to do things other than to provide health care services.  One prominent study that appeared in the <a href="http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/abstract/349/8/768"><em>New England Journal of Medicine</em></a> in 2003 estimated that the cost of administering the US’s health care system was about $300bn in 1999.  A more recent study in the <a href="http://www.pnhp.org/news/IJHS_State_Paper.pdf"><em>International Journal of Health Services</em></a> found that in 2003, administration costs in the US health care system ate up about $400bn, or about 25% of total health care spending.</p>
<p>By comparison, national health care systems incur administrative costs of a few percent of total health expenditures: according to the <em>NEJM</em> study Canada&#8217;s national health insurance system spends just 1.3% on overhead, and the <a href="http://www.cms.hhs.gov/MedicareProgramRatesStats/downloads/MedicareMedicaidSummaries2005.pdf">US&#8217;s Medicare and Medicaid programs</a> have administrative costs of between 2-5%.  </p>
<p>In addition to being large in an absolute sense, administrative costs have been rising faster than other health care costs in recent years.  <a href="http://http://www.cms.hhs.gov/NationalHealthExpendData/02_NationalHealthAccountsHistorical.asp#TopOfPage">The Medicare and Medicaid Actuary&#8217;s Office</a> estimates that the direct administrative costs of private health insurance plans (including profits) rose from about $40bn in the late 1990s to about $95bn in 2004.  The following chart shows these costs represented in dollar terms and as a percent of total private health insurance payments.</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/admin_costs3.jpg"></p>
<p>Note that these estimates only measure the direct costs paid by the insurance plans themselves, however, and exclude the bureaucratic burdens faced by doctors, hospitals, etc. to deal with insurance paperwork.  The <em>NEJM</em> study estimated that hospitals and doctors devote roughly one-fourth of their resources to dealing with insurance paperwork (no time series of these costs exists, unfortunately).  Indirect administration costs in the US health care system are roughly four times the direct administrative expenses incurred by the insurance companies themselves.</p>
<p>All in all, the <em>IJHS</em> study concluded that the US health care system could probably eliminate 75% of its administrative costs by switching to a single-payer system (see <a href="http://www.physiciansproposal.org/embargoed/angell.html">this document</a> for one good example of what such a system might look like).  The excessive bureaucratic burden (i.e. over what it could have with a single-payer system) of the US&#8217;s health care system seems to be in the neighborhood of $300bn per year.  <em>That&#8217;s</em> some real money.  And it&#8217;s growing, not shrinking.</p>
<p><strong>What Explains the Excessive Expenses?</strong></p>
<p>Economic theory provides several fairly clear and convincing explanations for why private health insurance plans spend so much money on administration, including economies of scale (or lack thereof), burden-shifting, and selection.</p>
<p>First of all, private health insurance plans are far smaller than national health insurance plans, and thus have much less ability to reap economies of scale.  For the same reason, the relative administrative costs of the Medicare system have steadily been falling over time.  </p>
<p>Secondly, private health insurance plans have a strong financial incentive to try to shift as much of the costs of each insurance claim on to individuals, providers, and other health insurance providers.  It therefore makes sense for them to devote substantial resources to the task of trying to avoid paying claims that are brought to them.  One example of this effect is how insurance companies go over claims with a fine-toothed comb to try to deny them whenever possible.  A national government-run insurance plan would have no such incentive, since there would be no one to try to shift the burden to.</p>
<p>Finally, private plans also have a strong financial incentive to try to exclude high-cost individuals from their plans.  It therefore makes sense for them to devote a lot of resources toward vetting potential enrollees and screening out those that they guess will have large claims.  Again, a national insurance plan has no such incentive, because by definition it is set up to insure <em>everyone</em>.</p>
<p>These are just some of the ways in which the market for health care is rife with what economists call &#8220;market imperfections&#8221; and &#8220;market failures&#8221;.  And as every economist learns in their first year in graduate school, when there are market failures and imperfections, the private market outcome is not likely to be the most efficient outcome, and government intervention (or even provision of the good) will probably produce far better results.  Unfortunately, the evidence from the US&#8217;s health care system seems to suggest that economic theory is exactly right in this case.</p>
