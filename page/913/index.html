                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Credit goes to <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,244124,00.html">Faux News</a> for a fair and balanced story:<br />
<blockquote>Continuing its march through an agenda of popular legislative initiatives, the Democratic-led House is considering cutting interest rates on some college student loans in half.  The House was scheduled to vote Wednesday on the measure, which would help an estimated 5.5 million students who get need-based federal loans. The government pays the interest that accrues on those loans while students are in college. Students pick up the payments after they leave school. The rates would drop from 6.8 percent to 3.4 percent in stages over a five-year period under the House proposal. That would cost nearly $6 billion</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.prospect.org/deanbaker/2007/01/budget_reporting_at_npr_one_ye.html#015138">Dean Baker</a> notes that this $6 billion is over a 10-year period:<br />
<blockquote>Well, CBO typically makes budget projections over a 10-year horizon. If this was a 10-year projection (I have no idea), then the projected annual cost is $600 million or approximately 0.02 percent of projected spending over this period.</p></blockquote>
<p>The White House opposes this subsidy.  So NOW they get the fiscal responsibility religion!  But let’s be fair.  Subsidizing student loans is not a free lunch as it will SOMEDAY mean SOMEONE will have to pay more taxes.  Of course, this White House is not saying when or whom.  The efficiency question is whether deviating from market determined borrowing rates to encourage more people to attend college is a good idea.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=OTFkZGNkNWNmYTJkOTViN2JmMWY3YTQwYmYzODUzODQ=">Richard Vedder</a> and <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=ZDJiNzk3ZGUzZWQ2ZWE5Y2FlZmUzYWIyMjI5MzA3MzQ=">Brian Riedl</a> oppose this subsidy.  Someone might fact check this from Riedl:<br />
<blockquote>Despite persistent claims of cuts, student financial aid spending since 2001 has surged by a staggering 400 percent &#8211; from $9.6 billion to $48 billion, according to the Office of Management and Budget. This makes the Office of Federal Student Aid the fastest-growing agency in the entire federal government. Much of this increase has come from an unanticipated surge in the number of college graduates consolidating their student loans (which will lead to large federal subsidies to banks). However, the student aid budget is projected to level off at approximately $25 billion &#8211; nearly triple the 2001 level. Congress’s focus on interest rates is curious because current rates are quite low by historical standards. This school year, the variable student-loan interest rate &#8211; which was set to jump to over 7 percent &#8211; was replaced with a fixed 6.8-percent rate that is lower than in all but six of the past 42 years.</p></blockquote>
<p>Market determined rates decline and people borrow more?  What a shocker!  Riedl also argues that student aid has led to an outward shift of the demand curve:<br />
<blockquote>Yet these unending student aid increases haven’t made college more affordable. The average college tuition, adjusted for inflation, has leaped 86 percent for public colleges and 52 percent for private colleges since the 1991-92 school year. Paradoxically, many economists now believe that student-aid hikes actually contribute to tuition increases. Colleges, like businesses, charge as much as their customers are able to pay. So when student aid increases, colleges raise tuition accordingly to capture the additional aid.</p></blockquote>
<p>Finally Riedl turns liberal asking why do we subsidize those who will one day be rich:<br />
<blockquote>Given that a college degree raises the average individual’s lifetime earnings by over $1 million, $114 per month is clearly an affordable payment on a very profitable educational investment. Perhaps it’s not in our best interest to tax society at large to further subsidize the 24 percent with college degrees and higher lifetime earnings. America faces substantial budgetary challenges: the war on terror and new homeland security costs must be funded, and projections show worsening budget deficits every year. The coming retirement of 77 million baby boomers will send Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid costs to levels that could require a doubling of all income taxes. In this context, responsible lawmakers should step back and examine whether a new subsidy for college graduates is really a top priority.</p></blockquote>
<p>Odd – Riedl doesn’t mention all that DoD spending but he does mention other entitlement spending which he advocates cutting substantially.  Vedder concedes college is expensive, but he echoes the claim that the rising cost of education is coming from an outward shift of the demand curve fueled by government subsidies.  The Riedl-Vedder argument seems to stem from an implicit assumption that the supply curve is vertical as if the incidence of this subsidy accrues to the colleges and their faculty.</p>

                                <p>Another quick thought about Iraq.  Many on the left insist the problem with Iraq is that you can’t win colonial wars – hence, Iraq was always destined to be a quagmire.  But what’s the difference between a colonial war and one country taking over another country?  Why was the German takeover of Poland not a colonial war, why was that successful (and would have been in the long run, barring outside interference)?  Or the US takeover of Panama (both of them)?  Or any number of other examples?  And why was Saddam able to hold Iraq and keep the borders secure, but the US isn’t able to do it?</p>
<p>My guess… simplistic… is that its easier to keep order than to regain it.  Lose control once and its hard to get it back.  I think Iraq was lost in the early days, when the administration showed no interest in keeping order (except at the oil ministry).  I think they still had a chance, had they managed to get every Iraqi working.  (Idle hands are the devil’s workshop.)  Even in Afghanistan, the administration didn’t screw up quite this badly – they maintained some semblance of order, if only by giving power to a bunch of bloodthirsty warlords, drug dealers, and religious fanatics.  In Iraq, the US military took over, and then our leaders decided it was a good idea to step aside and let the whirlwind begin.</p>

Quoting Mr. Bogg:</p>
<p>&#8220;You see, the devil is in the details. Galt (McArdle) was wrong about well, everything. On the other hand, you and I were right about where this was headed but we failed to dot our i&#8217;s and cross our t&#8217;s meaning that we were just as wrong as Megan even though we were right.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jane Galt is very smart, and she often brings a perspective that I&#8217;ll admit is somewhat alien to me.  But on this, I have to side with TBogg.  I wasn&#8217;t blogging at the time, so I can&#8217;t prove it by quoting myself, but I figured GW was going to make a hash of it &#8211; I was already concerned about Afghanistan, given that the administration had chosen to side with such worthies as Rasheed Dostum and the fundamentalist warlord in Herat.  My best guess was that Iraq would be another Afghanistan&#8230; each major city run by some corrupt, violent, and/or fundamentalist warlord or drug dealer. </p>
<p>But some people actually did dot the i&#8217;s and cross the t&#8217;s to use TBogg&#8217;s phrase.  It took me a minute and a half to find this <a href="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4196/is_20020925/ai_n10820824">article by Nicolas Kristof</a> from September 2002 using Google.  It begins:</p>
<p>&#8220;Najaf, Iraq &#8212; As soon as American troops are rolling through Saddam Hussein&#8217;s palaces, the odds are that this holy Shiite city 100 miles south of Baghdad will erupt in a fury of killing, torture, rape and chaos.</p>
<p>The Shiite Muslims who make up 60% of Iraq &#8212; but who have never held power &#8212; will rampage through the narrow streets here. Remembering the whispers from the bazaar about how Hussein&#8217;s minions burned the beard off the face of a great Shiite leader named Muhammad Bakr al-Sadr, then raped and killed his sister in front of him, and finally executed him by driving nails through his head, the rebels will tear apart anyone associated with the ruling Baath Party.</p>
<p>In one Shiite city after another, expect battles between rebels and army units, periodic calls for an Iranian-style theocracy and perhaps a drift toward civil war. For the last few days, I&#8217;ve been traveling in these Shiite cities &#8212; Karbala, Najaf and Basra &#8212; and the tension in the bazaars is thicker than the dust behind the donkey carts.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, Kristof had the benefit of actually wandering into Iraq.  But even he wasn&#8217;t right about everything&#8230; he frets about a Turkish invasion of Kurdish territory, for instance.</p>
<p>However, he did point out some details that should have been evident to the administration, if it hadn&#8217;t been peddling the &#8220;no history of ethnic strife in Iraq&#8221; line:</p>
<p>&#8220;More broadly, if the United States brings democracy to Iraq, it will mean seizing power from the 17% Sunni minority who dominate the army and government and giving it to the 60% Shiite majority. The upshot could be greater influence for Iran, a fellow Shiite country with close ties to Iraq&#8217;s Shiite cities.&#8221;</p>
<p>He closed with:  &#8220;If we invade Iraq, it must be with eyes wide open. The most ticklish challenge ahead is not overthrowing Hussein but managing the resulting upheaval for a decade afterward.&#8221;</p>
<p>Maybe I should read Kristof a bit more often, as to me, four years and change later, he looks more spot on than what the President was telling us last week.</p>
<p>Update&#8230; I screwed up a link again.  Corrected the first link.  Sorry.</p>

                                <p>I wish someone would teach <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/15/AR2007011501085.html">Lori Montgomery and Nell Henderson</a> how to write a story about either fiscal policy or Social Security. “Unexpected gusher of tax revenue” and exploding entitlement spending.  It’s like those silly scenes from the series <a href="http://www.fiftiesweb.com/tv/batman.htm">Batman</a> with <strong>SPLAT</strong> and <strong>POW</strong>.  It’s not like they aren’t getting the right advice from the economist bloggers. </p>
<p><a href="http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/002784.html">Max Sawicky</a> and <a href="http://www.prospect.org/deanbaker/2007/01/the_social_security_and_medica_1.html#015123">Dean Baker</a> object to their discussion of the Social Security Trust Fund.  As Dean notes:<br />
<blockquote>The article also includes the inaccurate claim that the Social Security trust fund is projected to &#8220;dry up completely&#8221; by 2017. Actually, the fund is projected to hold more than $4 trillion in U.S. government bonds by that date. President Bush&#8217;s Social Security trustees project that the fund will hold sufficient assets to pay all benefits through the year 2040. The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office projects that it will be able to pay all benefits until 2046 (and 80 percent of scheduled benefits in future years). The paper should at least be able to accurately report the Social Security projections.</p></blockquote>
<p>Max has a cool graph that should make these easy for Lori and Nell.  </p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2007/01/why_oh_why_cant_6.html">Brad DeLong</a> objects to the title and lead paragraph, which suggest President Bush is trying to balance the budget.  Brad notes the comments from Cato’s Chris Edwards come too late in the article:<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;I get the impression they&#8217;re trying to beef up his reputation for fiscal responsibility, not by doing heavy lifting and actually targeting programs like farm subsidies, but through rhetoric and projections and changes in rules and things that are easy for a president to propose,&#8221; said Chris Edwards, tax director at the Cato Institute</p></blockquote>
<p>I might say bravo to Chris but as long as President Bush refuses to allow for any reversals of his tax “cuts”, the kind of spending cuts that even the Cato crowd is talking about are not going to lead to fiscal responsibility.  </p>
<p>The 1960’s Batman series was incredibly silly in my view but at least we knew it was fiction.  Does the Washington Post realize how silly the writings of Lori Montgomery and Nell Henderson appear to their informed readers? </p>
<p>We should note that <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2007/01/robert_lucas_de.html">Mark Thoma</a> takes us back 25 years reminding us of what <a href="http://select.nytimes.com/auth/login?URI=http://select.nytimes.com/search/restricted/article&#038;OQ=_rQ3D1Q26resQ3DF40E16FE385F0C7B8EDDA10894D9484D81&#038;OP=66fdd313Q2FQ25Q26!lQ25B)3!Q5CQ5DxQ25Q7D3Q22Q5C..BMQ253B.eQ3C3!Q7D3!Q5DRQ3CQ7DQ5C.Q25Q5Ce3)Q7Do!2.Q5CfQ23z3xo">Robert Lucas</a> said about Reagan’s tax “cuts”:  <br />
<blockquote>Today, I wish to apply this point of view to the economic policies of the Reagan Administration. The main elements of these policies are well known. Government expenditures are being reduced, with a seriousness that marks an obviously genuine change of direction. Tax rates are simultaneously being reduced, to levels that will surely increase the deficit, even taking the expenditure cuts into account. The Federal Reserve is being enjoined to keep the growth rates of monetary aggregates to levels consistent with perhaps a 4 percent to 5 percent annual price inflation, come what may. Future tax cuts have already been legislated, and future expenditure cuts are also promised, sufficient to bring the budget in balance by the end of the President&#8217;s current term. The arithmetic of this combination of actions and promises works out, mainly because the sizes of the future expenditure cuts have been left unspecified. They will, it is claimed, be as big as necessary to release tax revenues large enough to service the debt created by the tax cuts, to bring the budget into balance by the end of his term, and to let the Federal Reserve resolutely refuse to &#8221;monetize&#8221; this debt with an inflationary increase of money.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’ve taken only a portion of the second Lucas 1981 op-ed that Mark kindly reminds us of.  There is so much more wisdom to gather from these two op-eds.  But notice in particular that the Reagan crowd promised to cut spending in line with its tax cuts.  Lucas wasn’t buying this promise back then.  And it turns out neither was the Volcker Federal Reserve.  The Reagan Administration never delivered on these promised spending cuts so the next two Presidents had to reverse at least some of the tax “cuts”.  So why we to trust George W. Bush to deliver on fiscal responsibility? Maybe we can ask the Joker or the Riddler.</p>

                                <p>I wish to revisit <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/01/republicans-complain-minimum-wage.html">this issue</a> in two ways.  The first is the politics – followed by a discussion of wages under laissez faire versus minimum wages when there are only a couple of employers on the island.  </p>
<p>I was wondering why a bunch of conservative Republicans were advocating a higher minimum wage for <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/01/republicans-complain-minimum-wage.html">American Samoa</a>.  It turns out that this is not about some new found concern for the working poor but simply payback to Nancy Pelosi and George Miller for positions like <a href="http://www.house.gov/georgemiller/marianasupdate.html">this</a>: <br />
<blockquote>Several news articles today reveal deeper and more serious potential violations in the relationship between lobbyist Jack Abramoff and his associates and Congress, including Majority Leader Tom Delay. This story is about a lot more than ‘congressional travel,’ although that is still part of it. Congressman George Miller reiterated today his earlier call for a thorough congressional investigation into activities related to its jurisdiction over the U.S. Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands – part of the United States. Miller said the activities involving the Islands and the lobbyists and Congress are beginning to look more like ‘criminal activity.’ Miller, the former chairman of the House Resources Committee and a long-time advocate of immigration and labor reform in Islands, issued the following statement today. “Even after years of trying to bring reform to the U.S. Marianas Islands, I am shocked by the new revelations of corrupt practices, including several important news stories today. It is equally disturbing to read the justifications: the Marianas sweatshops, and their protectors in past CNMI governments, ‘got what they paid for.’ “Let’s remember what they paid for: a protection racket that sheltered a sweatshop industry that systematically exploited tens of thousands of impoverished foreign workers &#8211; mostly Asian women &#8211; who were little better than indentured servants; a sweatshop industry that earned some of the heaviest fines in U.S. history for violating labor laws; an industry repeatedly cited by the Departments of Justice, Interior and other federal agencies. They were defending a corrupt immigration system that regularly approved visas for non-existent jobs, resulting in hundreds of women being forced into the sex trade, including prostitution.  “They killed my reform bills year after year. And even when an immigration reform by Senator Frank Murkowski, a Republican, was approved by the full Senate, they blocked it repeatedly in the House. Abramoff took credit and was paid handsomely for that, too. “This corrupt system existed because the CNMI slipped under federal labor and immigration laws. Abramoff, his lobbying colleagues, and some powerful friends in Congress are proud they prevented bipartisan reforms from being implemented.</p></blockquote>
<p>Liberal pundit <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/05/09/real.delay">Mark Shields</a> also piled on:<br />
<blockquote>DeLay traveled with his family and staff over New Year&#8217;s of 1997 on an Abramoff scholarship endowed by his client, the government of the territory, to the Marianas, where golf and snorkeling were enjoyed. DeLay fully approved of the working and living conditions. The Texan&#8217;s salute to the owners and Abramoff&#8217;s government clients was recorded by ABC-TV News: &#8220;You are a shining light for what is happening to the Republican Party, and you represent everything that is good about what we are trying to do in America and leading the world in the free-market system&#8221;. Later, DeLay would tell The Washington Post&#8217;s Juliet Eilperin that the low-wage, anti-union conditions of the Marianas constituted &#8220;a perfect petri dish of capitalism. It&#8217;s like my Galapagos Island.&#8221; Contrast that with what then-Sen. Murkowski told me in a 1998 interview: &#8220;The last time we heard a justification that economic advances would be jeopardized if workers were treated properly was shortly before Appomattox.&#8221; The &#8220;Made in the USA&#8221; label means standards of quality and standards of conduct. But more important than how a product is made is how the people who make that product are treated &#8211; as human beings with innate dignity &#8211; who are free to organize and entitled to a living wage. Did somebody say something about moral values?</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.alternet.org/story/13140">Steve Pizzo</a> wrote:<br />
<blockquote>As Tom DeLay preached his pro-business/anti-regulation theology in the US, his model of perfection was far from the mainland. The U.S. protectorate of the Northern Mariana Islands &#8211; 14 islands in the North Pacific &#8211; have become something of a free-enterprise petting zoo for DeLay and those he wishes to convert to his way of thinking. At the end of World War II, the U.S. acquired the islands, which are located off the coast of booming Asia. To encourage development and self-sufficiency Congress exempted the islands from the very kinds of U.S. business regulations and oversight DeLay despised. Even today the island&#8217;s minimum wage is only $3.05. Other work and safety regulations either do not apply at all or are rarely enforced. In short, the Marianas embodied many of the key ideals DeLay and other House Republicans were pushing in their 1994 Contract With America. For Asian sweatshop operators, the Marianas became the Promised Land incarnate. Since the islands were officially U.S. territory, garment factories there were able to tag their products with the coveted &#8220;Made in the USA&#8221; label. No rules, no regulators, no inspectors, no health and safety laws. What more could a sweatshop operator ask for? The opportunity was quickly recognized by Asian sweatshop operators like Hong Kong&#8217;s Tan Holdings, run by garment mogul Willie Tan. Deep in the lush jungles, far from the island&#8217;s white beaches and luxury hotels, garment factories quickly set up shop. They staffed their factories with workers from China and the Philippines with promises of work in the US. But, workers soon discovered that the work contracts they signed consigned them to near-indentured servitude deep in the Marianas steamy jungles. Wages were low, hours were long. The companies docked workers&#8217; pay for housing, food, medical treatments and other charges. The low wages and high deductions made it nearly impossible for workers to save enough money to return home.  None of this was a secret back home in the U.S. In 1998, ABC, CNN, the BBC and the New York Times each confirmed reports of forced labor, sex slaves and domestic forced servitude among the Marianas&#8217; so-called &#8220;guest workers.  According to the US Department of Labor, the indigenous US population of Marianas have an unemployment rate that hovers continuously around 14%. The unemployment rate of the island&#8217;s 40,000 so-called guest workers on the other hand is only 5%. Human rights groups, long up in arms over the work conditions on the islands, charged that sweatshop operators did not appreciate it when their female employees got pregnant. Numerous allegations of forced abortions surfaced over the years. The protests began to reach the ears of Congress. Rep. George Miller, (D-Ca) and others began to demand that US labor and environmental laws be applied to the Marianas. Tom DeLay and his friend Jack Abramoff swung into action and fashioned a vigorous and largely successful counter-attack.  Denying the reports that workers were being mistreated, Abramoff said the Marianas&#8217; unregulated environment was in fact a success story and a model for economic development. He said that efforts to regulate the islands&#8217; garment factories by some members of Congress like Miller were nothing less than immoral. &#8220;These are immoral laws designed to destroy the economic lives of a people,&#8221; Abramoff said. He went on to compare the proposed laws with the Nuremberg laws that restricted German Jews under the Nazis.  The Marianas became a pedal-to-the-metal cause for DeLay and another cash cow for Abramoff. Abramoff and his team, which now included DeLay&#8217;s former chief of staff Bill Jarrell, swung into action. They arranged junkets to the islands for scores of Republicans on The Hill. DeLay himself spent New Years Day 1998 in the Marianas with his wife and daughter and his then Chief of Staff, Ed Buckham. Another of Abramoff&#8217;s Mariana lobbyists was Patrick Pizzella who, believe it or not, is now serving in the Bush Administration as assistant secretary of Labor. It was Pizzella&#8217;s job to organize Abramoff&#8217;s political junkets to the islands.</p></blockquote>
<p>These 15 islands in the North Pacific Ocean &#8211; about three-quarters of the way from Hawaii to the Philippines – are home to about 82,000 people with a labor force consisting of almost 45,000 indigenous workers and almost 29,000 guest workers.  As the <a href="https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/cq.html#Econ">CIA World FactBook</a> notes, per capita income is $12,500 per year and:</p>
<blockquote><p>The economy benefits substantially from financial assistance from the US. The rate of funding has declined as locally generated government revenues have grown. The key tourist industry employs about 50% of the work force and accounts for roughly one-fourth of GDP. Japanese tourists predominate. Annual tourist entries have exceeded one-half million in recent years, but financial difficulties in Japan have caused a temporary slowdown. The agricultural sector is made up of cattle ranches and small farms producing coconuts, breadfruit, tomatoes, and melons. Garment production is by far the most important industry with the employment of 17,500 mostly Chinese workers and sizable shipments to the US under duty and quota exemptions.</p></blockquote>
<p>Besides aid from the U.S. government, the economy relies heavily on tourism from Japan and the garment sector.  GOP members of Congress succeeded keep regulation out of this economy stating it was “a shining light for what is happening in the Republican Party, and you represent everything that is good about what we’re trying to do in America in leading the world in the free-market system.”  He also called the islands ““perfect Petri dish of capitalism”.  The islands enjoy free trade with the U.S. and a minimum wage of $3.05 an hour.  Other worker protections tend to be low, which prompts many liberals to argue its garments can be labeled &#8220;Made in USA&#8221; without having to comply with all U.S. labor laws.  This lack of labor regulation is invites controversy. The inapplicability of Federal labor regulations has resulted in some extreme labor practices, not common elsewhere in the United States. Some of these labor practices include forcing workers to have abortions. </p>
<p>So what is the agenda of these conservative Republicans?  Is to extend the $7.25 per hour minimum wage to American Samoa or to preserve the free market approach to the Northern Mariana Islands?  On the other hand, noting certain abuses of firms or former members of Congress do not imply increasing the minimum wage from $3.05 an hour to $7.25 an hour will be an appropriate policy for these islands.  </p>
<p>But let’s look at the possibility that the employers on either one of these islands are exercising monopsony power (even though I know a certain AB reader will likely scream that I’m a hack for even considering such a possibility).  As the comments to my previous post noted (thanks Cactus), the model suggests that the spread between the wage rate under monopsony versus the competitive market wage rate depends on the elasticity of supply.  Let’s assume for a second that the competitive market rate equals $5 an hour and the elasticity of supply is 1.5.  Then the laissez faire wage rate with monopsony behavior would be $3 an hour.  For both of these island economies, the current minimum wage is just above $3 an hour.  Under my admittedly hypothetical example, raising the minimum wage from the current level to any level equal to or less than $5 would increase employment.  But raising the minimum wage beyond $5 would create excess supply.  One might argue that migration of workers from other nations to the Northern Mariana Islands has made the labor supply curve more elastic.  By then – has this migration taken place under full information – or were these guest workers duped by false promises?</p>

                                <p>Permit me to turn a bit free market – dare I say – rightwing.  Yesterday afternoon, I had to endure some local radio host being really populist as he tore into the oil companies.  He was whining that gasoline prices have not fallen in line with the decline in oil prices.  This claim struck me as very odd so I checked the monthly data from July 2006 to November 2006 and saw that the retail price of a gallon of gasoline had declined by $0.75 a gallon or 25%.  The component attributable to oil fell by only $0.27, which turns out to be a 17% decline.  The component attributable to the refinery margin fell by $0.46, which turns out to be a 58%.  OK, the components attributable to the distributor margin and taxes fell by a mere $0.02.  But I would suggest our populist radio host check the <a href="http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/oog/info/gdu/gaspump.html">data</a> data before he decides to attack the oil companies.  Or maybe he can join Robert Novak in some cable news debate show.  Remind me when it is on – so I don’t have to watch.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: AB reader K Harris points us to an interesting article by <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/energy/2007-01-15-gas-prices-usat_x.htm">Barbara Hagenbaugh</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Gasoline prices dropped over the holiday weekend and are likely headed lower. But drivers who expect gas prices to fall as sharply as oil prices in recent weeks will likely be disappointed. That&#8217;s because gas stations aren&#8217;t seeing their fuel costs drop as swiftly as oil prices. And studies have shown retail gas prices &#8220;rise much more quickly when oil prices rise, and they fall much more slowly when oil prices fall,&#8221; says Stephen Brown, director of energy economics at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.</p></blockquote>
<p>So that fellow on the radio was not as crazy as I thought according to Stephen Brown. Maybe I need to take a look at these studies.</p>

                                <p>The other day, the girlfriend and her buddy Autumn were talking and I was doing some work on my laptop at the other end of the room.  Autumn, who does catering, was explaining why she won’t accept jobs as a wedding planner, “Because then you have to deal with bridezilla.”  </p>
<p>Male readers instinctively understand that this was when I joined the conversation, albeit passively.  I’m glad I did, as from there, the conversation deteriorated further, rapidly sinking into the wedding-topic abyss.  The ladies discussed how it seems that men never do any of the planning in weddings.  Brides-to-be and married women seem mostly unanimous that they did all the work, and the groom just shows up.  </p>
<p>I was thinking that there are several reasons why the bride-to-be-does all the work:</p>
<p>1.  Guys simply don’t care about the details that women will obsess about.  Ask a guy about a table setting, and he’ll say, “OK.”  Change the table setting, ask him about it again, and he’ll say, “OK.”  And if there’s no table setting, that’s OK too.  We do, however, concern ourselves with the table.  Ask us about the table and we’ll break out a level, maybe some WD-40, and check the table’s structural integrity.  If anything is wrong with the table, we’ll fix it.  A guy knows what is important is whether the table will serve its function, namely keeping things off the floor, and now how it is decorated.</p>
<p>2.  Given that guys don’t care about table settings unless they are extremely obnoxious (e.g., pink or lavender, involve doilies, are excessively scented), and even then, we all can live with pretty much anything for an afternoon, asking a guy to make decisions about those things simply means that those decisions will later be over-ridden by someone who cares at a later point.  Presumably whining and/or yelling and/or much condescension will be involved.  So a wise man stays out of it.</p>
<p>I would also note, to those who still wonder why there are so many bridezillas and so few groomzillas… I’m sure there a few groomzillas out there.  But I think most of them must be in Massachusetts.  (Insert requisite Seinfeldism, “Not that there’s anything wrong with it.”)  Furthermore, I would think even among gay men, and even among the subset of gay men that are effeminate, there are very few groomzillas.  Am I wrong about this?</p>
<p>(BTW… the girlfriend has approved of this post.)</p>

                                <p>I had a post the other day commenting on <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/01/william-kristol-on-surge.html">William Kristol&#8217;s statements about the surge in Iraq</a>.</p>
<p>I noted that while I sincerely hoped the President did somethign right for once, given all the lives at stake, &#8220;[i]n six months, it will be evident to almost everything that GW has failed again.  In two years, it will be evident even to Kristol.&#8221;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I may have been optimistic.  Steven Benen discusses <a href="http://www.thecarpetbaggerreport.com/archives/9620.html">problems arising</a> even before the surge begins.  </p>
<p>At some point, if Kristol and the rest of the Weekly Standard/National Review crowd truly were patriotic, they&#8217;d shut the hell up, because clearly their suggestions have so far been worse than useless, they&#8217;ve been dangerous.  And at some point, if GW and Cheney and their entire administration really are patriotic, they&#8217;d they have the decency to resign and let someone else have a go at it, since they&#8217;re clearly way outside their depth.  </p>
<p>(And they&#8217;re not just outside their depth on the war in Iraq.  A competent President might actually do something about the debt too.)</p>
<p>Correction&#8230; I wrote this in too much of a hurry the first time, and got the name of Kristol&#8217;s magazine wrong.  Apologies.</p>

<blockquote>On the basis of this analysis I will vote against supplementary American involvement in Iraq.</p></blockquote>
<p>They are in shock because it was written by William F. Buckley.  Key to his analysis is the following:<br />
<blockquote>If success in Iraq would bring an end to the movement of which Iraq is now the apex, the answer would clearly be yes. Has the president persuasively argued that it would do so? No. He has said that &#8220;failure in Iraq would be a disaster for the United States.&#8221; He hasn&#8217;t said why. Great countries do lose great engagements. We did in Vietnam and Korea, and the Soviets did in Afghanistan.</p></blockquote>
<p>In 1970, conservative Paul Harvey shocked fellow conservatives by telling President Nixon he was wrong on Vietnam.  This ranks up there with that 1970 speech.</p>
