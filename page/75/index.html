                                <p>The August employment report shows the economy continuing with its very sluggish pace. Although the unemployment rate fell it was due more to a contracting labor force rather than expanding employment. The household survey showed a drop of some 119,000 while the payroll or headline data increased only 96,000 &#8212; private rose 103,000 while government employment fell 7,000.</p>

                                <p>Over at <a href="http://plainblogaboutpolitics.blogspot.com/2012/09/democrats-day-2.html">Plain Blog</a>, an anonymous wing nut made this off-topic comment.<br />
<blockquote>Now, yes, Bill Clinton and his 2000 federal spending level of 18% of GDP  doesn&#8217;t put him on the fringe, which makes it surprising that you  lefties are celebrating him, even as you hysterically condemn anybody  who resists the Left&#8217;s current  massive  spending levels, which are  nearly 50% greater than Clinton&#8217;s and are spending the nation into  debt  obvlivion.</p></blockquote>
<p>This once again raises the regressive canard that Obama has been a profligate and fiscally irresponsible spender.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s have a look.</p>
<p>Here is a graph of current expenditures that took place in the years of the current century.</p>
<p>
<div><a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fredgraph.png?g=agQ"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fredgraph.png?g=agQ" width="400"></a></div>
<p>First  observation is that anon&#8217;s math isn&#8217;t very good.  Current expenditures  are roughly 100% greater than when Clinton left office, not a mere 50%.</p>
<p>Second  observation is that the vast majority of that increase &#8211; from about  $1900 billion to about $3200 billion &#8211; took place under the previous  administration.</p>
<p>Third observation is that the bulk of  the Obama increase occurred during the recession &#8211; as it should &#8211; from a  bit under $3200 billion to a bit under $3600 billion.  Since then it&#8217;s  crept up to about $3800 billion, and has recently flat-lined.</p>
<p>A  more subtle point is that spending, like many time series data sets,  increases exponentially over time, following population growth.  So,  saying that a value at time B is some percentage greater than the value  at time A communicates essentially zero information.  Context matters. </p>
<p>Let&#8217;s look at expenditures in terms of year over year increase.</p>
<p>
<div><a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fredgraph.png?g=agZ"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fredgraph.png?g=agZ" width="400"></a></div>
<p>Yep, there was a big increase in 2009 and 2010, as social safety net programs kicked in.</p>
<p>Since  then, expenditure growth fell precipitously and now has actually gone  negative.  The last time that happened was in the Eisenhower  administration.  Clearly, Obama has not been profligate.  Would it be an  exaggeration to say he&#8217;s been miserly?</p>
<p>Bill Clinton  did a great job of exposing Republican lies in his speech at the  Democratic convention last night.  But really, it&#8217;s easy.  All you have  to do to refute a regressive is have a quick look at facts and data.</p>

                                <p>Joe Gagnon has a nice blog which allows comments only by e-mail.  He has <a href="http://www.piie.com/blogs/realtime/?p=3094">a proposal in two parts</a></p>
<p>
<blockquote>Next week the Fed should promise to hold the prime mortgage rate below 3 percent for at least 12 months. It can do this by unlimited purchases of agency mortgage-backed securities. By giving people a fixed time period to take advantage of the lowest mortgage rates in history, the Fed could meaningfully boost the housing market just when buyers are beginning to believe that prices are starting to head up. The Administration could capitalize on this opportunity by forcing the housing agencies and jawboning the banks to stop applying excessively high credit standards for prime mortgages.<br />To maximize the potential benefits of sound monetary policy, the Fed should seriously consider the proposals of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/30/business/economy/ben-bernanke-needs-a-volcker-moment.html" target="_blank">Christina Romer</a> and <a href="http://kansascityfed.org/publicat/sympos/2012/mw.pdf?sm=jh083112-4" target="_blank">Michael Woodford</a> to target a fixed path of nominal GDP, the broadest measure of economic activity in dollar terms. The path should be based on a year of normal conditions, such as 2007, and should increase at a rate of 4.5 percent, which would allow for average growth of 2.5 percent and average inflation of 2 percent. Because we are far below such a path right now, it would take a few years of growth above 2.5 percent and/or inflation above 2 percent to return to normal. This policy would allay market fears of premature Fed tightening while being consistent with the Fed’s stated long-run inflation goal of 2 percent.  </p></blockquote>
<p>Dear Joe Gagnon
<div></div>
<div>Absolutely.  I&#8217;d note that Bernanke&#8217;s cost 3) higher expected inflation is an important benefit, since it implies lower real interest rates if nominal interest rates are at the lower bound.</div>
<div></div>
<div>I think that &#8220;trading among private agents could dry up, degrading liquidity and price discovery &#8221; really means that profits of financial intermediaries might be reduced.  I&#8217;m sure Bernanke doesn&#8217;t care about them, but the argument that a high volume of trade is socially useful as asset prices are closer to fundamental values if trading volume is high doesn&#8217;t pass the laugh test.  This is casually assumed, because almost all experts say it is so.  Almost all experts are financiers.  They know that a high volume of trading is key to their profits (not just fees, the traders who think they are sophisticated know they need noise traders in order to profit from their sophistication).  </div>
<div></div>
<div>With admirable modesty and a firm devotion to avoiding pointless quarrels among people who mostly agree, you merely note that you think that the Romer/Woodford nominal GDP targeting proposal would be a useful addition to your proposal.  You don&#8217;t argue that it would be necessary for unlimited purchases of agency MBS aiming to hit a prime mortgage rate target to have a huge effect on the economy.  You don&#8217;t concede that their proposal would have any major impact on the economy all by itself.  But you won&#8217;t quite say that you think that nominal GDP targeting is barking up the wrong tree (with my intercontinental ESP I am sure you think that &#8212; in any case I do).</div>
<div></div>
<div>I guess this is the right approach.  If the debate is current policy vs the Romer/Woodford/Gagnon proposal then each of the two very different parts of the proposal have a better chance. Emphasizing disagreements among people who basically agree is a good way to organize a circular firing squad.   </div>
<div></div>
<div>I have edited my third paragraph to remove a false assertion on a point of fact.  Woodford definitely supports purchases of agency MBS.  He has written this repeatedly.  I&#8217;m sure Romer agrees too.  Bernanke definitely suggested (as definitely as a Fed chairman can) that he thinks that MBS purchases should be part of any further QE which he might decide is a good idea maybe.  So I&#8217;d say you (you four including Bernanke I&#8217;d bet) don&#8217;t mostly agree but agree completely except for a bit of different emphasis.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Still I fear the dread worst of both worlds compromise.  It seems to me very likely that the FOMC will reach a near as possible consensus for QE III of the sort closest to normal monetary policy &#8212; that is based on much larger than usual purchases of much longer maturity than usual Treasuries, but still on money for treasuries open market operations.  It seems to me that this must be what happened when they decided to design QE II to be about as ineffective as possible (I am thinking of the choice of 7 year notes rather than MBS and not about the $600 B ceiling or the assurance that they weren&#8217;t aiming for higher inflation).</div>
<div></div>
<div>Quite frankly, I think you are too modest for the country&#8217;s own good.  Please blow your own horn more</div>
<div></div>
<div>Sincerely yours Robert Waldmann</div>

<p>Omigod Sept 4 2012 really is opposites day.  Ezra Klein made an incorrect claim of fact about health care financing.  He wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>But I’m not going to make that argument. I’m on-record saying that trust-fund accounting is by and large a ridiculous way to look at the federal government’s finances, but both parties do it, and so Ryan isn’t committing any foul here. And within the trust-fund accounting rules, Obama is using his Medicare cuts to pay for the Affordable Care Act and Ryan is using his Medicare cuts to finance the Medicare program in the future.</p></blockquote>
<p>My amazed comment follows.    </p>
<p>I agree that trust fund accounting is absurd, but your trust fund accounting is totally wrong.  The balance of the Medicare plan A trust fund would be identical under the ACA and the Ryan budget.  There is just no difference at all.  The ACA did not take any money out of the Medicare trust fund to pay for anything.  That&#8217;s why it extended the forecast time till the fund is empty by 8 years.   </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>The ACA spending increases are, by trust fund accounting (which I agree is nonsense) separate from the Medicare spending cuts (and the Medicare tax increases).  The effect on the deficit is the sum.  The Medicaid expansion and the subsidies for insurance bought on exchanges are not at all funded by any money which would otherwise be in the Medicare plan A trust fund.   </p>
<p>Amazingly uber wonk Ezra Klein is just wrong on a health care financing fact (a meaningless one I agree but you are just wrong).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ustaxcourt.gov/InOpHistoric/BartlettMemo.TCM.WPD.pdf">Bartlett v. Commissioner</a>, T.C. Memo. 2012-254 (Sept. 4, 2012):  <br />
<blockquote>Petitioner admits that her income was misreported and that her taxable income was underreported. She maintains that she reported all of her income and that the mistakes made were &#8220;honest mistakes&#8221; resulting from her lack of familiarity with the TurboTax program. Petitioner claims she used the audit portion of the TurboTax program, believing the audit portion would catch any mistakes she otherwise might make. &#8230;<br />It is apparent that a portion of the information petitioner entered into the TurboTax program was incorrect; hence the mistakes made (which resulted in the underpayment) were made by petitioner, not TurboTax. TurboTax is only as good as the information entered into its software program. See <a href="http://www.ustaxcourt.gov/InOpHistoric/Bunney.TC.WPD.pdf">Bunney v. Commissioner</a>, 114 T.C. 259, 267 (2000). Simply put: garbage in, garbage out.</p></blockquote>

<p>(Dan here&#8230;Dale Coberly replies to this article (<a href="http://www.economics21.org/commentary/it-becoming-too-late-fix-social-securitys-finances">Is it Becoming Too Late to Fix Social Security&#8217;s Finances?</a>) by Charles Blahous). </p>
<p>Blahous,</p>
<p>You do not seem to grasp how small &#8220;4% of the tax base&#8221; is,  or how very reasonable it would be to pay that 4% for a longer, richer retirement, out of an income that will be more than twice what it is today.</p>
<p>That might be a politically difficult concept where neither side is being honest.  The &#8220;right&#8221; want to cripple Social Security for essentially ideological reasons.  And the &#8220;left&#8221; wants &#8220;the rich&#8221; to pay for Social Security&#8230; for essentially ideological reasons.  But as you note, the essense of Social Security is that the workers pay for it themselves.</p>
<p>Moreover, that 4% can be reached over a period of nearly eighty years.  To do it without ever reaching short term actuarial insolvency would require about a one tenth of one percent increase in the tax (combined) each year starting very soon,  or a one tenth of one percent increase in the tax (for each the worker and his boss) starting in about 2018 and running through abut 2033&#8230;  or some combination.</p>
<p>Further increases of one tenth of one percent (each) would be needed at a decreasing frequency, such that by the end of the 75 year actuarial window, the rate increases would be about one tenth of one percent every ten years&#8230;  again, while wage are projected to be increasing over one full percent per year.</p>
<p>And again, this would be neither a burden nor unfair to the workers.  They would get the money back over a longer retirement, and at a higher standard of living in retirement than current workers.  Moreover they would have at least twice as much money in pocket AFTER paying the tax as they have today.</p>
<p>The problem may indeed be &#8220;political,&#8221;  because neither side is honest enough to recognize this simple solution.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>I am generally skeptical about the importance of further QE in the USA, but I am definitely not skeptical about the effectiveness of the the leaked European Central Bank plan to purchase unlimited amounts of European Government debt.  The reason is that there are government bonds over here which terrify investors.  That means that the amount which private investors must hold should have a fairly large effect on the price (different European government bonds are not at all close substitutes).</p>
<p>The leaked plan is a compromise between the sane and the German (two of my best friends are German) .  Importantly the ECB will not place an upper limit on yields on bonds, that is promise to buy any amount if the price falls below some level. </p>
<p>The purchased bonds must be fairly short term bonds (the aim seems to be to make the intervention as ineffective as possible).  <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-05/ecb-plan-said-to-pledge-unlimited-sterilized-bond-buying.html">Jana Randow and Jeff Black&#8217;s Bloomberg report</a> that up to three year bonds will be bought.  Again this is based on leaks.  Alarmingly Il Corriere della Sera reports both this claim and the dramatically contrasting claim (from a source identified only as &#8220;German speaking&#8221;) that the bonds will be of duration only up to 1 year.  That would be almost pointless.    I can&#8217;t get the corriere link (I read the article in the dead tree version and search ilcorriere is horrible).  The key passage is &#8220;Draghi ha citato l&#8217;esempio di titoli circolante sul mercato secondario con scadenze &#8216;fino a tre anni&#8217; secondo alcune fonti, o &#8216;al di sotto di un anno&#8217;, secondo altre che parlano Tedesco.&#8221; that is &#8220;Draghi gave an example of bonds on the secondary market with maturity &#8220;up to three years&#8221; according to some source, or &#8216;less than one year&#8221; according to other sources who speak German.&#8221;</p>
<p>In comparison QE II consisted of purchases of 7 year notes and Twist of (sterilized) purchases of 30 year bonds.  My view is that QEII was totally pointless (didn&#8217;t even statisticall significantly affect the price of 7 year bonds) and Twist was at least better than QEII.  So 3 years is not long enough.  On the other hand, Spanish, Italian, Irish, Portoguese and especially Greek (PIIGS) bonds are not at all like US Treasuries.  They are not close substitutes for money at alllll (I personally will absolutely not exchange any of my money for any such bond with maturity over 3 months).</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think that it is important at all that the intervention will be allegedly sterilized.  That would normally mean that the ECB sells bonds of another type when it buys PIIGS bonds so the money supply doesn&#8217;t increase.  Jana Randow and Jeff Black at Bloomberg report</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;At the moment, the ECB mops up the impact of its mothballed bond-purchase program by offering banks weekly term deposits that currently return 0.01 percent.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p> I assume that these deposits don&#8217;t count for reserve requirements (which I doubt are binding in noted contrast to capital requirements for some (mostly Spanish) banks).  Aside from that they are very close substitutes for money.  I consider this fake sterilization. </p>
<p>To me the big issue is the 1 year vs 3 year war of leaks.</p>

<p>As the Republicans Take Tampa, Consider What a GOP Victory Would Mean for Women’s Health</p>
<p>For decades, Republicans have opposed abortion. This, we know, and so it comes as no surprise that <a href="http://crooksandliars.com/nicole-belle/mitt-romney-calls-roe-v-wade-one-dark">Mitt Romney, the Party’s presidential candidate, has called “Roe vs. Wade“ one of the darkest moments in Supreme Court history.” <strong></strong></a></p>
<p>But what some call the “war against women” is escalating. This year, the Republican platform calls for a constitutional amendment that would make abortion illegal.</p>
<p>In 1976, the GOP blueprint acknowledged that “the question of abortion is one of the most difficult and controversial of our time,” and the Party called for “a continuance of the public dialogue on abortion,” which it called a “moral and personal issue.” Just eight years ago, the preamble to the Republican platform declared: “we respect and accept that members of our party have deeply held and sometimes differing views.” But today, there is no such language in a platform that calls for “a human life amendment to the Constitution,” and declares that “abortion is detrimental to women’s health and well-being.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile Alabama, Arizona, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Nebraska, North Carolina, Oklahoma, and Ohio all have passed legislation outlawing abortion after 20 weeks, even though, as the Center for American Progress’ Emillie Openchowski points out “<a href="http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/women/news/2012/08/23/33841/abortion-is-the-battle-but-womens-health-is-the-war">complications are sometimes discovered after this point in a pregnancy that could cause serious harm to the woman</a>. In those states, a woman would be forced to continue the pregnancy, no matter the risk to her health.” This is frightening.</p>
<p>While Republicans parade women across their Tampa stage– and avoid talking about what they have quietly embedded in the Party platform–it seems a good time to consider what a Republican victory would mean for women’s health.</p>

<h4><strong>Turning Back the Clock: Contraception</strong></h4>
<h4>Susan Faludi’s Pulitzer-prize winning 1991 book, <em>Backlash,</em> is subtitled: “The Undeclared War Against American Women.” Twenty-one years later, it seems the war is out in the open . As a recent <em>New York Times</em> editorial observes: “Having won on abortion, social conservatives are turning to birth control.”</h4>
<p>The Affordable Care Act (ACA) promises women <a href="http://mediamatters.org/research/2012/07/19/conservative-media-cover-up-support-for-contrac/187250">access to contraception without co-pays, an idea which enjoys widespread popular support–at least among women. Nationwide 80% of women voters support the idea, according to a June survey by Hart Research Associates</a>. An earlier Hart poll revealed that 77% of Catholic women and 72% Republican women approved of free birth control. By contrast, just <a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/ppgnw/birth-control-matters-32835.htm">sixty percent of all men embrace the proposal</a>. Still, that’s a majority.</p>
<p>Who, then, actually <em>opposes</em> making birth control available to all women, regardless of income?<br />The extreme conservatives who now run the Republican Party have made their feelings clear. In February, House Speaker John Boehner, stood on the House floor, and promised to overturn any rule requiring employers to pay for birth control for their workers:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nationaljournal.com/domesticpolicy/as-contraception-rule-goes-into-effect-unusual-silence-from-republicans-20120801">“It must not stand and it will not stand,” delcared Boehner,</a> who believes that bosses who object to birth control should not be forced to cover contraception. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky, along with Senators Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H.; Roy Blunt, R-Mo.; Marco Rubio;, R-Fla.; and John Thune,quickly joined in, arguing that this provision is a threat to religious freedom.</p>
<p>The right-wingers who now control the GOP seem to view contraception as a “women’s issue” that should be decided by men. Thus, at <a href="http://www.dccc.org/pages/wherearethewomen">a House Oversight Committee hearing, House Republicans convened a panel on denying access to birth control coverage with five men– and <em>no</em> women.</a></p>
<p>As for Republican presidential candidate <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/health/2012/08/26/745521/romney-touts-romneycare-im-the-guy-that-got-healthcare-for-all-the-women-and-men-in-my-state">Mitt Romney, in a <em>Fox </em>interview just last Sunday, he said: “of course women have a right to use contraception”– if they can afford it. </a></p>
<p>In March Romney told a Town Hall meeting that <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/03/20/1075916/-Romney-to-Women-You-Want-Birth-Control-Vote-for-the-Other-Guy">if “a woman wants access to free birth control” she “should vote for the other guy,” </a>adding, “there are a lot of things that we have in our society that we may like,” but that government should not be paying for.” This suggests that “the Pill” is a luxury, like a $75 blouse.<br />Romney also has endorsed the “<a href="costhttp://thinkprogress.org/health/2012/03/01/435290/romney-says-he-would-oppose-blunt-bill-if-it-prevented-people-from-getting-contraception/">Blunt amendment” that would let any employer drop health insurance coverage for contraception </a>and other health services on religious or moral grounds.</p>
<p>Here we are not just talking about Catholic colleges and hospitals. President Obama is making special provisions to accommodate their concerns. But the Republican “<a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/jul/31/obama-administration-sen-dems-tout-health-benefits">Blunt amendment” would go further, to include private companies such as Hercules Industries, a Denver-based heating and air conditioning company</a>.</p>
<p>Co-owner Andy Newland objects to birth control, and in July, the company obtained an injunction from a federal court, allowing it to delay complying with the law until three months after the case is decided.<br /><strong><br /></strong><strong>The Cost of Contraception</strong><br /><a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/02/08/1062855/--Anybody-can-afford-birth-control-says-clueless-Greg-Gutfield-of-Fox-News">According to Fox News’ Greg Gutfield, “Anybody can afford birth control.” </a>In July, he asked his audience, “How much more affordable can you make it? . . I mean, do we–should we start up like a ‘buy the pill’ campaign? Like ‘feed the children’ where we make sure we all adopt one woman and pay for her pills?”<br />Gutfield is, of course, wrong about the cost. In recent years, <a href="http://ww.plannedparenthood.org/ppgnw/birth-control-matters-32835.htm">birth control has become extremely expensive for low-income women</a>, even if they are insured. Co-payments for pills typically range between $15 and $50 per month, and for other contraceptive devices, such as IUDs, co-pays and other out-of-pocket expenses can reach into the hundreds of dollars.</p>
<p>“Since the average American woman wants to have two children,” Planned Parenthood points out, “she‘ll spend approximately five years pregnant, postpartum, or trying to have children, but 30 years trying to prevent pregnancy. <a href="http://ww.plannedparenthood.org/ppgnw/birth-control-matters-32835.htm">That can add up to thousands of dollars spent on prescription birth control.” </a><br />Little wonder that, according to a recent survey, more than one-third of American women voters have struggled with the cost of prescription birth control at some point in their lives, and, as a result, have used birth control inconsistently. Planned Parenthood reports that “this number rises dramatically among younger women, with more than half (55 percent) mentioning a time when they could not afford to use birth control consistently.”</p>
<p>Thus, “<a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/ppgnw/birth-control-matters-32835.htm">In the U.S., half of all pregnancies are unintended</a>.” Inevitably, a great many uniplanned pregnancies end in abortion. “If we are serious about reducing the unacceptably high rate of unintended pregnancies in this country, we need to get at the root cause and take practical steps to increase access to affordable birth control,” Planned Parenthood observes. <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Without the Affordable Care Act– What Women Would Lose</strong><br />The <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/28/platform-abortion_n_1837571.html">GOP platform states that a Republican President would use his waiver authority “on his first day in office” to halt progress in carrying out the Affordable Care Act</a>. Romney has pledged to repeal health reform during his first 100 days in the White House.</p>
<p>This means that <a href="http://www.healthinsurance.org/blog/2012/04/28/health-reform-a-huge-victory-for-women/">insurers selling policies in the individual market would be able to continue charging a women at least 30 percent more than they would charge a man for exactly the same policy–</a>even if the coverage did not include maternity benefits.</p>
<p>Women also would lose free access to a list of preventive services that the ACA requires that insurers offer without co-pays, and without applying deductibles.</p>
<p>For women, the essential preventive services include: free screening for cervical and breast cancer; breastfeeding support, supplies, and counseling; well-women visits, prenatal care, screening and counseling for sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV; screening for gestational diabetes; and screening and counseling for domestic partner violence.</p>
<p><strong>Planned Parenthood and Title X </strong><br />Mitt Romney has pledged that he will “get rid of” Planned Parenthood, an organization that operates nearly 800 health centers throughout the United States, offering sexual and reproductive health care for the nearly three million women and men who visit these centers each years. While helping women avoid unintended pregnancies, <a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/about-us/who-we-are/planned-parenthood-glance-5552.htm">Planned Parenthood also provides roughly 770,000 Pap tests and nearly 750,000 breast exams annually</a>, along with more than four million tests and treatments for sexually transmitted infections. At sometime in their lives, one in five American women have found help at Planned Parenthood.<br />During his Sunday interview on Fox, Mitt Romney reiterated his desire to defund the organization, arguing that taxpayer dollars should not fund abortion.</p>
<p>Here is <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2011/04/08/157196/jon-kyl-90-percent-planned-parenthood-abortion">the truth: abortion constitutes only 3 percent of Planned Parenthood’s services </a>and abortion is covered by private funds. Federal dollars are not used.</p>
<p>Mitt Romney’s fiscal plan also proposes eliminating Title X—the main federal family-planning program supported by President Nixon and then-Congressman George Bush Sr. at its creation in 1970. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/08/us/texas-womens-clinics-retreat-as-finances-are-cut.html">Title X does not pay for abortions, but it prevents abortions and unintended pregnancies by the hundreds of thousands each year</a>. It also pays for cancer screening and some abstinence counseling for teenagers.<br />In Texas Republican Governor Rick Perry already has rejected Title X money, assuring that countless poor women in his state will be denied access to all reproductive health care, from birth-control pills to Pap smears.</p>
<p><strong>Misogyny: The Elephant in the Room </strong><br />That both Bush and Nixon supported Title X serves as a reminder of how much the Republican party has changed. As <em>New York Magazine’s</em> Frank Rich points out in a marvelous piece titled “Stag Party”: <a href="http://www.healthbeatblog.com/2012/08/as-the-republicans-take-tampa-consider-what-a-gop-victory-would-mean-for-womens-health/.http://nymag.com/news/frank-rich/gop-women-problem-2012-4/">“For much of its history, misogyny was not the style of the party of Lincoln</a>. For most of the twentieth century, the GOP was ahead of the curve in bestowing women’s rights</p>
<p>Today, many Americans under 40 have no idea how different the GOP (not the mention the country as a whole) was 25 or 30 years ago.</p>
<p>Rich takes us back, reminding us that Republican presidential candidate Barry Goldwater (who in 1964 was considered ultra-conservative) was married to a woman who had been “inspired by birth control pioneer Margaret Sanger.” Thus, Peggy Goldwater “would help build one of the nation’s largest Planned Parenthood affiliates.”</p>
<p><a href="http://www.healthbeatblog.com/2012/08/as-the-republicans-take-tampa-consider-what-a-gop-victory-would-mean-for-womens-health/.http://nymag.com/news/frank-rich/gop-women-problem-2012-4/">Barry Goldwater favored abortion rights</a>. “‘I think the average woman feels, My God, that’s my business,’ and that’s the way we should keep it,” he said late in his career.<br />Rich goes on to reveal that “Prescott Bush, the Connecticut senator who sired a presidential dynasty, was another Sanger enthusiast and treasurer for the first national Planned Parenthood fund-raising campaign. His son, <a href="http://www.healthbeatblog.com/2012/08/as-the-republicans-take-tampa-consider-what-a-gop-victory-would-mean-for-womens-health/.http://nymag.com/news/frank-rich/gop-women-problem-2012-4/">George when a congressman in the sixties, was an ardent birth-control advocate and the principal Republican author of the trailblazing Family Planning Act of 1970. </a>”</p>
<p>“Capitol Hill colleagues jokingly nicknamed him ‘Rubbers.’”</p>
<p>Even Richard Nixon, that much misunderstood liberal Republican, favored the Equal Rights Amendment and in 1972 signed the Equal Employment Opportunity Act to strengthen the policing of workplace discrimination.”</p>
<p>But Nixon was nothing if not a study in anguished contradictions<a href="http://www.healthbeatblog.com/2012/08/as-the-republicans-take-tampa-consider-what-a-gop-victory-would-mean-for-womens-health/.http://nymag.com/news/frank-rich/gop-women-problem-2012-4/">. “At the tail end of the Nixon presidency,” Rich notes, “the GOP started backing away from its traditional beneficence on women’s issues</a>.” In a telling shift, “Nixon vetoed a bipartisan bill enabling child care for the millions of mothers then rapidly joining the workforce.”</p>
<p>Looking back, the timing makes sense. Both Watergate and Nixon’s “enemies’ list” foreshadowed the deepening parenoia that would lead to a purge with the Republican party itself.<br />Granted, it would be two decades before the GOP’s “Big Tent” collapsed. The liberal and moderate Republicans who I had admired in the 1970s and 1980s (Nelson Rockefeller, Lowell Weicker, and Charles Mathias, to name a few) would disappear. But it was not until the 1990 that the long knives came out, and moderates began to be sliced out of the party. Some gave up and retired.</p>
<p>Why did Nixon kill the childcare bill? Rich explains: “His veto was accompanied by a jarring statement that child care would threaten American families by encouraging women to work,” <a href="http://www.healthbeatblog.com/2012/08/as-the-republicans-take-tampa-consider-what-a-gop-victory-would-mean-for-womens-health/.http://nymag.com/news/frank-rich/gop-women-problem-2012-4/">The inspiration for this unexpected reactionary broadside came . . . from political strategists eager to exploit the growing backlash against the sixties feminist movement.”</a></p>
<p><strong>Backlash–As Male “Influence and Power” Declines </strong><br /><strong><br /></strong>What we are seeing in the GOP today is a continuation of the pay-back that Susan Faludi described in her 1991 book, <em>Backlash</em><strong><em>.</em> </strong><br /><strong><em><br /></em></strong>Conservatives like to claim that “The War Against Women” is a metaphor manufactured by Democrats as they prepared for the 2012 election. This simply is not true. Long ago, women such as Faludi saw that herd of elephants coming our way.</p>
<p>In fact, as Rich points out, in 1996 “Tanya Melich, the daughter of a state senator in ultraconservative Utah” who grew up “to be a stalwart New York Republican and a 1992 Bush convention delegate, wrote a book titled <em>The Republican War Against Women</em>. “These days,” he writes, “her eyewitness account of her party’s transformation seems more pertinent and prescient than ever.”</p>
<p>The anger that Republicans direct toward women that can be traced to the “women’s movement” of the 1960s. Men feared that women would take their jobs. Husbands were threatened; once their wives had some financial independence, they might decide to strike out on their own. Fathers realized that the “Pill” would give their daughters sexual freedom: marriage could become a choice, not a necessity.</p>
<p>Worst of all, as women gained power, both in the workplace and in government, this could mean that men would find themselves having to answer to the likes of Elizabeth Warren. (In 2009, when Warren, who is now running to recapture Ted Kennedy’s Senate seat for the Democrats, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pz7ruJw6byQ">questioned Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner about 13 billion dollars Goldman Sachs got out the back door of AIG –“Do you know where the money went?”</a> — her tough, probing questions made jaws drop– including Geithner’s. Geithner would later express opposition to her possible nomination to head the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.)</p>
<p>In <em>Backlash</em>, Faludi quotes Seymour Martin Lipset and Earl Raab, two political scientists who have explored the “politics of backlash”: “The reaction” is driven by “groups which are declining in a felt sense of importance, influence and power,” they explain, “Unlike classic conservatives” Faludi adds, “these ‘pseudo conservatives,’ as Theodore Adorno dubbed them…are not so much defending a prevailing order as resurrecting an outmoded or imagined one.”</p>
<p>She also quotes the historian Richard Hofstadter: “‘America has largely been taken away from them and their kind, though they are determined to try to repossess it and to prevent the final destructive act of subversion.’”</p>
<p>In other words, they are afraid, and when people are “on the run,” some turn mean.<br />Conservative white men know that the demographics are against them. Before long, they will be outnumbered, and in future years, more and more African Americans, Latinos, Asians and women of all races will be in positions of power.</p>
<p>Let me be clear: I am not talking about majority of white men. My husband, his brother, my son, his father (my ex-husband), and a great many men who I know either personally or professionally do not fit this mold.<br />But, without question, some white conservative men saw Barack Obama’s election in 2008 as a sign that the country “was being taken away from them.” To Mitch McConnell, Obama’s re-election would constitute what Hofstadter terms “the final destructive act of subversion.”</p>
<p>In a sense, those who feared the rise of feminism in the 1960s were right. The women’s movement would never be snuffed out. Instead, it became part of our culture. Today many fewer women call themselves “feminists.” The vast majority of younger women simply assume that they have a right to work, to assume positions of power in the larger world, to control what happens to their bodies. This is the legacy of the Sixties.<br />
<h4><strong>The Violence against Women Act </strong></h4>
<p>Women also take it for granted that they have a right to protection against the rage that sometimes threatens them–and their children– in their own homes.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, this year, House Republicans felt free to block renewal and expansion of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), a 20 -year-old law that offers shelter and counseling to women who have been beaten or sexually assaulted by spouses or partners.</p>
<p>In the past, renewal was not even in question. But today, “<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/27/us/politics/senate-votes-to-renew-violence-against-women-act.html">Some conservative groups view the Violence Against Women Act as “a slush fund for feminist causes that harms men unfairly and encourages the dissolution of marriages</a>,” the <em>New York Times</em> reported .</p>
<p>Last week, I wrote about <a href="http://www.healthinsurance.org/blog/2012/08/26/what-would-a-gop-victory-mean-for-womens-health/">how and why Republicans were able to block the VAWA on HealthInsurance.Org</a>. Conseratives claim that Democrats “politicized” the issue by turning it into a fight over illegal immigrants, Gays and Lesbians. I do not buy that argument. Nor did all seven Republican women in the Senate. They voted to renew the bill.</p>
<p>That post also explains why it is so important that, in November, women–and men who like women–come out to vote. The turnout, not just in the Presidential contest, but in many Congressional races, will determine who takes over Washington.</p>

                                <p>Okay, more jargon. But important jargon because the policy proposals are starting from different baselines themselves defined by this jargon. So while some of the following is basic, it is equally a rhetorical (in the classical definition) baseline.</p>
<p>Under current Social Security law future benefits are set by a formula. For a given individual this formula starts from income history but if we take total benefit payouts in the aggregate we have cost totals primarily driven by employment numbers, Real Wage, and CPI. And this aggregate number represents 99% or so of the category that the Report Tables label as &#8220;Cost&#8221;. These projected future benefits are in turn offset by projected income deriving from one main and two minor sources, that is FICA payroll tax, tax on certain benefits, and interest on Trust Fund assets, with the totals being labeled in the Tables as &#8220;Income&#8221;. In an ideal world the trend of projected Income would exceed projected Cost in just the amount needed to maintain a specific, relative level of reserves. This state of affairs for any given year or set of years is called &#8220;actuarial balance&#8221; and if projected to continue beyond the 75 year actuarial window, and with an upward trend is called &#8220;sustainable solvency&#8221;.</p>
<p>As it turns out current mid-range projections of future employment, Real Wage, CPI, payroll income, tax on benefits, and interest on Trust Fund assets do not project &#8220;sustainable solvency&#8221;, instead there is a projected gap between total income and accumulated assets available to pay out future benefits and total projected costs. That is if we simply assume ALL mid-range projections, something that is labeled in the Reports &#8220;Intermediate Cost&#8221;  and follow current law that requires payment of full &#8220;scheduled benefits&#8221; as long as total income and assets allow those benefits to be &#8220;payable&#8221;, at some point the latter level falls below the former. The state in which &#8220;scheduled benefits&#8221; exceeds &#8220;payable&#8221;  can be called &#8220;insolvency&#8221;, or working up the shrillness index &#8220;crisis&#8221; or even &#8220;bankruptcy&#8221;.</p>
<p>But before we start hyperventilating it would be useful to slow down and actually examine the financial and legal implications for actual beneficiaries at this &#8220;crisis&#8221; point. Because one thing we know for sure the end result will NOT be &#8220;no check&#8221;. Maybe not the SAME check on the SAME day, but the system won&#8217;t grind to a complete halt. To see what is likely to happen under current law and realistic political projections you will need to follow under the fold.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />(Lucky you, a computer crash wiped out a bunch of text. So a shorter version.) The takeaway most readers of the Social Security Report would have is that at the point at which projected &#8220;Income&#8221; (which defines &#8220;payable benefit&#8221;) falls below &#8220;Cost&#8221; (which defines &#8220;scheduled benefit&#8221;) current law simply reduces the latter to the former overnight resulting in around an immediate 22-25% cut in benefit checks.</p>
<p>But this is where the two groups I will call fairly neutrally Social Security &#8220;Defenders&#8221; vs &#8220;Reformers&#8221; start talking past each other. While each sees this cut as tremendously disruptive &#8220;Defenders&#8221; see that disruption in the form of Gramma spending her remaining shopping dollars in the Catfood Aisle, while &#8220;Reformers&#8221; see armies of Greedy Geezers storming Capitol Hill in their Lexus&#8217;s demanding their God-given right to pay Country Club dues with their full scheduled Social Security check.</p>
<p>As such their definitions of &#8220;Fix&#8221; and even &#8220;Preserve&#8221; take very different forms.  I like to think of this in the logicians terms of &#8220;direction of fit&#8221;. &#8220;Defenders&#8221; want to &#8220;fix&#8221; Social Security by ensuring that &#8220;payable&#8221; is fitted to &#8220;scheduled&#8221; while reformers prefer fixes that will defuse the crisis by fitting &#8220;scheduled&#8221; to &#8220;payable&#8221;. Both sides would argue that their respective fixes avoid the dreaded &#8220;slash&#8221; in benefits in the interest of &#8220;preserving&#8221; Social Security, it is just that &#8220;Defenders&#8221; are preserving a particular projected standard of living while &#8220;Reformers&#8221; are seeking to preserve a certain political peace, in their terms an avoidance of &#8220;intergenerational warfare&#8221;.</p>
<p>And as a &#8220;Defender&#8221; I am even willing to concede that certain &#8220;Reformers&#8221; are actually sincere. Where I see a perfectly fixable case of &#8220;under funded&#8221; they see an equally fixable case of &#8220;over promised&#8221;.  Which is one of many reasons why the Social Security debate is not really one of numbers, but is really at root one of values and perceived equity. Which is not an argument for civility, just a suggestion that not all &#8220;Reformers&#8221; are liars or fools. Heartless sociopaths willing to use whatever tactics and number twisting they can to keep Greedy Geezers at bay? Sure. Fools? Well not ALL of them. And given a generous interpretation of whether &#8220;scheduled&#8221; or &#8220;payable&#8221; is the correct baseline to build your analysis even liar is too harsh. For some. Who simply consider themselves hard-headed realists.  </p>
