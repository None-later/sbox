                                <p><a href="http://www.haloscan.com/comments/angrybear/5569640321105000046/#726787">mmckinl</a> mentioned the new AIG deal. </p>
<p>Naked Capitalism has a post by Yves Smith regarding the new and improved AIG plan titled: <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2008/11/aig-looting-continues.html">The looting continues </a>(Bannana republic watch).  It reviews a WSJ article and notes that AIG is getting a rate cut  (5.5 point reduction) with more money for a longer term (5 years instead of 2, is this to protect the money class through this first term liberal hippie commune period?) and we are buying junk at $0.50 on the dollar thus potentially setting up a windfall for those who already bought crap for less.  The author&#8217;s position is also that WSJ is doing their usual water toting for the money from money class.</p>
<p>In the end the author quotes a 1994 article by Nobel prize winner George Akerlof and Paul Romer : Looting: The economic underworld of bankruptcy for profit. </p>
<blockquote><p>Our theoretical analysis shows that an economic underground can come to life if firms have an incentive to go broke for profit at society&#8217;s expense (to loot) instead of to go for broke (to gamble on success). Bankruptcy for profit will occur if poor accounting, lax regulation, or low penalties for abuse give owners an incentive to pay themselves more than their firms are worth and then default on their debt obligations.</p></blockquote>
<p>I would ask: Is AIG the linchpin to assuring the financialization of our economy is extended well beyond Bush&#8217;s and prior neo-liberal economic policy hawks (DLC, Blue Dogs, Clinton) legacy?</p>

<p>There will be an upcoming series on &#8220;What our economy is supposed to do for us&#8221; as part of the question of describing our economy.  The public discussion appears to be minimized to date for the majority.</p>
<p>Another series has started debating the predominant role of trade and trade policy in the current economic difficulties for the US in particular and the world overall.  This question is being ignored or minimized in economic blogs one reader states.  Look for more on the topic.</p>

<p>Healthcare &#8211; the American System at its Finest</p>
<p>I get back pain every so often. To keep it at bay, I do sit-ups every day, and try to keep my weight down.  I also do back and stomach exercises at the gym.  But every so often, its not enough and I end up going to a chiropractor.  I have a session or two, and they set me up so I don&#8217;t have to come back for a few years. For what its worth, the insurance company has never paid for any of these chiropractor visits, though they&#8217;ve worked.</p>
<p>Now, a month or so ago I had horrible back pain&#8230; and after a day or two of walking around like Cornelius from the original Planet of the Apes, I decide its time see a chiropractor.  Having recently moved, I looked around for a new chiropractor.  One always has to be careful &#8211; there are a heck of a lot of charlatans who call themselves chiropractors.  (Not as many as there are that call themselves economists, I might add, but that&#8217;s a different story.)</p>
<p>My wife gets a recommendation from someone she met, and off we both (she too gets episodic pain and by coincidence was having some then too) go to see Dr. M_____ as Poe would put it.  Very quickly, my charlatan sensors go off.  When they had me watch a DVD, my keen charlatan-sensors went off, and I told my wife it was time to get up and go.  She had me stay put.</p>
<p>Long story short… there was much mumbo-jumbo, and then another Doctor, not Dr. M___, shows up and has us take X-rays.  He tells us we have to come back on Saturday to have the X-rays read.</p>
<p>That evening, I told my wife these guys are charlatans for sure.  My wife is not cynical enough for her own good, and on Saturday she dragged me back to the <strike>vet</strike>.  Long-story short – the other Doctor points out all sorts of back problems, tells us physical therapy will take a few months (we have to come in daily for a few weeks, and then three times a week for a few more months), and gives us a lot big words.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;m thinking – OK, I ain&#8217;t coming back, but maybe he&#8217;ll &#8220;lay hands&#8221; on me, so to speak, now.  Instead, he hustled us into a big room with assorted machines.  We (my wife and I) each spent six minutes lying on this auto-massager, and another six minutes on this thing that was essentially a bag of water sloshing around.  Meanwhile, a number of the regulars were coming and going, getting their six minutes in and (I guess) going home.  We did get a short massage – I&#8217;m pretty sure that was less than six minutes.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;ve never been back.  And I&#8217;m still walking like Cornelius.  Now, for a few interesting facts:</p>
<p>1.  The insurance company covered most of the cost of the visit.  (Remember, no insurance company has ever paid for a chiropractors visit for me before!  And the previous ones I&#8217;ve seen were clearly not charlatans as they got the job done.) </p>
<p>2.  Looking at the bill, I can tell you that for the privilege of letting me sit in front of a DVD, the insurance company got charged over $300.  There wasn&#8217;t even any popcorn, but I was offered water, and no doubt there would have been an extra charge for internal aqua cleansing therapy had I taken them up on the offer.  Lying on a massage chair type thingie qualified as rather expensive physical therapy.  On the bright side, there was no charge for breathing the air – the insurance company drives a hard bargain.</p>
<p>3.  On a hunch, my wife called up the place and, when she found herself speaking to a receptionist whose voice she didn&#8217;t recognize, asked what it would cost to have a consultation.  She claimed not to have insurance… and was quoted a price just a smidge less than our co-pay.  So having insurance doesn&#8217;t really make any difference, except to Dr. M____&#8217;s billing machine. </p>
<p>And by the way – before anyone tells me I should call my insurance company about this mess, who do you think will get stuck with the whole bill if the insurance company does come to its senses? </p>
<p>So to anyone who wants to tell me the American medical system works, I guess agree more or less.  Mostly less.  See, the system does work very well for Dr. M____. The insurance companies are doing well too – what other business is there in which such hapless creatures can make so much money with a business model best described as &#8220;being ripped off by crooks?&#8221;  However, it isn&#8217;t working for those who provide quality service, nor for those who need it, whether they are willing and able to pay or not.<br />________________________________<br />by cactus</p>

                                <p>by Divorced one like Bush<br />(successfully I might add)</p>
<p>I had the following quotes sitting around for awhile.  Like May of 07.  Being that we have a &#8220;crisis&#8221; with our economy (I have a hard time with the word crisis being used, it implies suddenness, unseen), a new governing philosophy in place and we really, really, really have to broaden our discussion, I feel this is the time to post some thoughts on GDP.  It goes along with asking what I think is the most important, &#8220;In the beginning&#8221;, big bang question to ask now that we have been a &#8220;great social experiment&#8221; for TWO HUNDRED and THIRTY TWO years: <strong>What do we want our economy to do for us?</strong></p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s about time we ask this question, No?  The &#8220;for us&#8221; is the important subject of the question.</p>
<blockquote><p>But even if we act to erase material poverty, there is another greater task, it is to confront the poverty of satisfaction &#8211; purpose and dignity &#8211; that afflicts us all.  Too much and for too long, we seemed to have surrendered personal excellence and community values in the mere accumulation of material things.  Our Gross National Product, now, is over $800 billion dollars a year, but that Gross National Product &#8211; if we judge the United States of America by that &#8211; that Gross National Product counts air pollution and cigarette advertising, and ambulances to clear our highways of carnage.  It counts special locks for our doors and the jails for the people who break them.  It counts the destruction of the redwood and the loss of our natural wonder in chaotic sprawl.  It counts napalm and counts nuclear warheads and armored cars for the police to fight the riots in our cities.  It counts Whitman&#8217;s rifle and Speck&#8217;s knife.  And the television programs which glorify violence in order to sell toys to our children.  Yet the gross national product does not allow for the health of our children, the quality of their education or the joy of their play.  It does not include the beauty of our poetry or the strength of our marriages, the intelligence of our public debate or the integrity of our public officials.  It measures neither our wit nor our courage, neither our wisdom nor our learning, neither our compassion nor our devotion to our country, it measures everything in short, except that which makes life worthwhile.  And it can tell us everything about America except why we are proud that we are Americans.<br /><a href="http://www.jfklibrary.org/Historical+Resources/Archives/Reference+Desk/Speeches/RFK/RFKSpeech68Mar18UKansas.htm">Robert Kennedy, University of Kansas. 3/18/68</a></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Unfortunately GDP figures are generally used without the caveat that they represent an income that cannot be sustained. Current calculations ignore the degradation of the natural resource base and view the sale of non-renewable resources entirely as income. A better way must be found to measure the prosperity and progress of mankind” <br />Barber Conable,<br />former President of the World Bank, 1989</p></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>Simon Kuznets &#8211; GDP&#8217;s creator &#8211; in his very first report to the US Congress in 1934 said[2]:<br />&#8230;the welfare of a nation can scarcely be inferred from a measure of national income. If the GDP is up, why is America down? Distinctions must be kept in mind between quantity and quality of growth, between costs and returns, and between the short and long run. Goals for more growth should specify more growth of what and for what.</p></blockquote>

<p>Hat tip <a href="http://balancedscorecard.blogspot.com/">Balanced Scorecard</a> reader CCZ for this post at his/her website with this link to <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/3363293/Chinas-toy-makers-face-bleak-Christmas-as-factories-shut-down.html">Telegraph</a> in the UK.</p>
<blockquote><p>The workers of Dongguan are used to Christmas coming early. Summer and autumn are normally the busiest months for those who toil seven days a week in the toy factories in this city in Guangdong Province, the heartland of China&#8217;s manufacturing industry. China is the world&#8217;s largest producer and exporter of toys, so long hours of overtime are needed to ensure that Christmas presents for children in Britain and elsewhere reach shops by November.This festive season, though, many of Santa&#8217;s real-life Elves have no jobs at all.
<p>Since the beginning of 2008, over half of the toy exporters in Guangdong &#8211; some 3,900 firms &#8211; have gone out of business, according to customs officials.</p>
<p>The economic boom that has drawn millions of workers from all over China to this southern province near Hong Kong is over, as companies suffer the effects of the recession gripping the West. Now, anger amongst the unemployed is on the rise, raising the spectre of social order breaking down in what was once China&#8217;s most prosperous region.</p>
<p>Even before the global financial meltdown, China&#8217;s manufacturers were being squeezed by rising production and transportation costs, as well as the strengthening Chinese currency, the Yuan. But it is only in the last few weeks that the scale of the crisis has become apparent. Two weeks ago the Smart Union toy company, which made toys for the US giants Disney and Mattel, including Barbie dolls, abruptly shut down its factories in Dongguan. The Hong Kong owners and senior managers vanished, leaving 7,000 people without jobs.</p></blockquote>
<p>Update:  Divorced One Like Bush adds &#8220;Smart Union is a licensed manufacturer. Disney and Mattel were just the middle man.&#8221;</p>

<p>The handyman in me got to thinking as we discuss trade policy and issues.  Drills made a good start, in that a way into a man&#8217;s heart is a good drill, and something to relate to not so complex as a car.<br />
<blockquote>&#8230;may actually cost you to move manufacturing of a product overseas. In the chart above, part costs represent 72% of a product, overhead is 24%, and labor only 4%.</p></blockquote>

The handyman part of me  found it interesting that &#8216;returns&#8217;and replacement costs for product can be accounted for in another budget area not under &#8216;cost&#8217; per unit, and other anomalies.</p>
<p>Areas impacted can be major, such as design limitations because of where the product is manufactured, &#8216;cheap labor&#8217; as a simple fact of cost savings overall not put in perspective, &#8220;lean manufacturing&#8217; limitations, and precision ordering and inventory control limitations around transport and container issues (as an example)are discussed.</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s rare to see an OEM in the U.S. today questioning the presumed logic of lower-cost manufacturing in China. “Can’t beat those labor rates,” they say. “My competitors are all doing it, and I have to stay competitive.” The fervor is a bit similar to those in the stock market shortly before the dot-com bubble burst.</p>
<p>A few voices have risen above the cacophony, however, pointing out that perhaps this lemming-like exodus to China has not been fully examined from a cost perspective. Business analysts such as Boston Consulting Group and Aberdeen Group are uncovering both the risks of outsourcing and the limited view most U.S. manufacturers have about what it costs them to produce their products.</p></blockquote>
<p>I am not an expert or even particularly knowledgeable on the manufacture of this product line, but have used many different drills from many places of manufacture, with many experiences about cost and quality.  Here is a counter argument. Makes for a good Sunday consideration.</p>

<p>asked Felix Salmon a question in a comment at <a href="http://www.portfolio.com/views/blogs/market-movers/">Market Movers</a>.</p>
<p>He just responded by AIM (hey does that mean I&#8217;m on Felix Salmon&#8217;s AIM friends list ? sure does and all I had to do was download and install AIM).</p>
<p>felixsalmon (8:31:29 PM): But I&#8217;m interested in a comment you left on my blog:<br />felixsalmon (8:31:35 PM): &#8220;Now as to CDS abuse, tell me a non abuse involving way in which the notional value of CDS is so much greater than the value of all insured D ? If something like that happened with another kind of insurance, wouldn&#8217;t you consider it abuse?&#8221;<br />felixsalmon (8:32:18 PM): I think I can answer that quite easily: I enter into a position, and then I unwind it by entering into an equal and opposite position<br />felixsalmon (8:32:28 PM): and since I&#8217;m a trader, I do that many times a day.<br />felixsalmon (8:32:45 PM): Pretty soon, notional is through the roof, even with no net exposure at all<br />robert.waldmann@gmail.com (8:33:02 PM): yes that seems to be an answer (and indeed quite easy).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&#038;sid=aKr.oY2YKc2g">Bloomberg</a> now suing in court under the Freedom of Information Act for aggregate information concerning types of collateral being  used for collateral with the $1.5 trillion authorized by Congress.  The books from Treasury are being kept by the Fed, so regular rules of FOIA are in a deeply grey area.</p>
<p>Does the President have any control over disclosure rules??</p>
<p>[Update from Ken:  Am I the only one who thinks that if Tim Geithner goes along with the Administration&#8217;s &#8220;no aggregates&#8221; postion,* combined with <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2008/11/culture-of-risk.html">his hiring of Michael Alix to help supervise banks</a>, it would disqualify him from being a reasonable candidate for Treasury Secretary?]</p>
<p>Update:  used for collateral replaces bought in second paragraph</p>
<p>Update II: clarification of what Geithner should not be advocating, as noted by Walker in comments.</p>

                                <p>By Stormy</p>
<p>Forty-year <a href="http://www.bankrate.com/brm/news/mtg/20000316.asp">mortgages</a>; even <a href="http://www.mortgagenewsdaily.com/5162006_50_Year_Mortgage.asp">fifty-year mortgages</a>? Just as we moved from one income-earner per family to two-income earners, now we have shifted once again: we may be moving from the home being the retirement nest egg to the home no longer being the retirement nest egg.</p>
<p>In fact, there will be no nest egg at all.</p>
<p>As we have clutched the American dream ever tighter, we seem to be drifting further and further from it.</p>
<p>And what is the root cause? Jobs, jobs, jobs. Trade, trade, trade. Once a good factory job brought a good income, a home, and prospects for a decent retirement.</p>
<p>What we are watching is the rapid crumbling of the credit edifice, that edifice we built as we ignored the rising trade deficit, as we watched the manufacturing sector move offshore to cheap labor in third world countries, as we substituted debt for production, financial wizardry for honest labor.</p>
<p>We were told to welcome the cheaper goods as we bought some of them with credit cards.</p>
<p>I have had a number of battles with those that thought the loss of manufacturing was due primarily to technology.</p>
<p>I would like to take up that cudgel once more, for the last time, asking a very simple question: <i>Should not superior U.S. technology have led to a trade surplus?</i></p>
<p>After all, as long as a country can efficiently produce, it makes no difference how many workers it takes. Our trade surplus should have soared.</p>
<p>As long ago as <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9801E6D61730F934A2575BC0A9659C8B63">2003</a>, the New York Times ran a piece that said:</p>
<blockquote><p>More than half of the manufactured goods that Americans buy are made abroad, up from 31 percent in 1987. If we continue on our path of ceasing to make merchandise that others want to buy from us, the danger is that these imports will be unaffordable for our descendants. </p>
<p>The proportion of the work force employed in manufacturing has fallen to 11 percent from 30 percent in the mid-1960&#8217;s. Two of the 19 percentage points disappeared in just the last 28 months. On another level, manufacturing&#8217;s share of real gross domestic product &#8212; representing all the goods and services produced in the United States &#8212; has edged down, even including in the count the output of foreign manufacturers operating here. The share of real G.D.P. has dropped to between 16 and 17 percent, from 18 to 19 percent in the 1950&#8217;s.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The above remarks were made in 2003. Many of us said then that the party would end when the consumer had spent his last dollar, figuratively speaking.</p>
<p>Well, the party is over.</p>
<p>Obama is correct when he says that the upward climb will be long and hard. He apparently wants to create &#8220;green collar jobs,&#8221; a wise choice. It is the next revolution.</p>
<p>I just hope that, unlike what we did with Apple and Intel, we do not allow these new companies to seek cheaper employment elsewhere. We better begin to look at our trade policies, otherwise we will return to the same sinking boat.</p>
