                                                                    </div>

                                <p>We are below full employment, real wages are falling, national savings is very low, and as Kash and AB note, projected deficits are as far as the eye can see.  So what is the game plan for Bush’s second term – tax simplification as noted in his speech on 9/2: “The American people deserve and our economic future demands a simpler, fairer, pro-growth system. In a new term, I will lead a bipartisan effort to reform and simplify the federal tax code”. So what is the great game plan released by the White House?  To appoint a commission to look into this “recommendation”:</p>
<blockquote><p>President Bush Provides Leadership on Tax Reform</p>
<p>America has a growing, dynamic, and changing economy &#8211; but our tax code has not kept up with the times. The current tax code is a maze of special interest loopholes that causes America&#8217;s taxpayers to spend more than six billion hours every year on paperwork and other headaches. President Bush believes that America&#8217;s taxpayers deserve, and our future economic prosperity demands, a simpler, fairer, pro-growth system &#8211; and he has pledged to lead a bipartisan effort to reform and simplify the tax code.<br />
<br />The time that people spend complying with an overly complex tax code is a burden and a waste of resources that has been growing over time. </p>
<p>The Internal Revenue Code contains more than a million words. </p>
<p>The number of pages in the Internal Revenue Code and regulations has more than doubled over the past twenty years. Today&#8217;s &#8220;short&#8221; income tax form takes more than 11 hours to prepare &#8211; about the same as the long form did a decade ago. </p>
<p>It takes 12 pages of instructions to calculate the Earned Income Tax credit &#8211; a basic element of income-support for the working poor. </p>
<p>By 2010, more than one in five taxpayers will be forced to calculate their income taxes twice -once for the regular income tax and once for the Alternative Minimum Tax &#8211; and then pay the greater amount. </p>
<p>President Bush&#8217;s Action to Promote Tax Reform</p>
<p>President Bush announced that he is making tax reform a key priority. </p>
<p>The President will begin this effort by creating, by Executive Order, a bipartisan panel to advise the Treasury Secretary on options to fundamentally reform the tax code to make it simpler, fairer, and pro-growth. </p>
<p>The President&#8217;s goals are to make the tax code simpler and to increase long-run economic growth and job creation. Taxes should be applied fairly, and reform should recognize the importance of homeownership and charity in our American society. </p>
<p>Background: The Bipartisan Advisory Panel on Tax Reform</p>
<p>The President will create a Bipartisan Advisory Panel on Tax Reform: </p>
<p>The President will appoint experts, economists, and economically knowledgeable and experienced people of both parties.<br />
<br />The panel will be charged with holding public hearings and seeking input from Members of Congress. </p>
<p>The Panel will consult and debate and will provide its advice and a report to the Secretary of the Treasury as early as possible in 2005. This advice will inform the Secretary in his efforts to make recommendations to the President. </p>
<p>The Panel will be asked to answer certain questions. </p>
<p>Principle: The tax code should be simpler.  How can tax reform reduce the administrative burden on taxpayers?<br />
<br />Should tax reform modify the current system or replace the system with a new one?<br />
<br />How should the transition from the old to the new system be handled? </p>
<p>Principle: The tax code should be fairer.<br />
<br />What tax loopholes need to be closed to eliminate tax evasion and ensure that everyone pays his or her fair share?<br />
<br />How can we ensure that the benefits of tax reform are spread widely among Americans?<br />
<br />What is the best way to make the tax system progressive, an attribute that is fundamental to fairness in taxation?<br />
<br />To what extent should the tax system be used to achieve goals other than raising revenue?<br />
<br />How should the tax system deal with different family structures? </p>
<p>Principle: The tax code should promote economic growth and job creation.<br />
<br />How can the tax system increase economic growth and job creation?<br />
<br />How can the tax system better encourage work effort, saving, and investment?<br />
<br />How can we make American workers and firms more competitive?<br />
<br />The Panel will be asked to present revenue-neutral reform options to the Secretary of the Treasury, at least one of which should be a reform of the current individual income tax system. </p></blockquote>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>The Bush administration has repeatedly vowed to acheive the very meager budgetary goal of &#8220;<a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2003-12-13-bush-budget_x.htm">halving the deficit</a>&#8221; in 5 years.  Bush himself made such a promise in his <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2004/01/20040120-7.html">state of the union address</a> in January.</p>
<p>Today the CBO released its <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/57xx/doc5773/08-24-BudgetUpdate.pdf">mid-year update</a> on the budget outlook for the next ten years.  Here are the CBO&#8217;s estimates of the US budget deficit:</p>
<p>2004: $422bn, or 3.6% of GDP<br />
<br />2009: $312bn, or 2.1% of GDP</p>
<p>Halving the deficit in 5 years was a miserable, puny, girlie-man goal.  Yet the Bush admininstration can&#8217;t even meet this goal, according to the CBO&#8217;s projections.</p>
<p>The worst part, however, is that the CBO&#8217;s projections of the deficit are certainly far too low.  The CBO estimate assumes:
<ul>
<li>the tax cuts set to expire in 2005 are not renewed and do actually expire.<br />
</li>
<li>there is no additional spending in Iraq or Afghanistan after 2005.<br />
</li>
<li>The AMT is not reformed in any way, so that tens of millions of households must pay it by the end of the decade.</li>
</ul>
<p>A <a href="http://www.cbpp.org/6-4-04bud.htm">more realistic estimate</a> should add $100 to $200 bn to the budget deficit every year from now into the future.</p>
<p>Note one last thing: the projections that the CBO has made for the deficits for the period 2004-09 have gotten steadily worse, even over the past year.  This past year, you might recall, is a period in which &#8220;<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2004/09/20040904.html">America&#8217;s economy is strong and growing stronger</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>CBO projected total deficits, 2004-09:<br />
<br />As of January 2003: $40 bn<br />
<br />As of August 2003: $1,616 bn<br />
<br />As of January 2004: $1,921 bn<br />
<br />As of September 2004: $2,006 bn</p>
<p>What&#8217;s the Bush administration&#8217;s excuse for the projected deficits getting steadily worse?  I&#8217;m curious.</p>

                                <p>&#8230; Political Total War, not total war in Iraq, that is. Let&#8217;s look at the facts:<br />

<ul>
<li>While the degree of the bounce is <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2004_09/004630.php">contentious</a>, Bush got <a href="http://www.emergingdemocraticmajorityweblog.com/donkeyrising/archives/000637.php">a real bounce</a> in August (see also, <a href="http://www.pollingreport.com/wh04gen.htm">here</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>The month of August, between the Swift Boat BS and the convention (Bush&#8217;s speech aside) was <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2004/09/politics-of-hate-v-politics-of-hope.html">extremely negative</a>, and conducted with <a href="http://swiftvets.eriposte.com/">little</a> <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A57627-2004Sep2.html">regard</a> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/03/politics/campaign/03facts.html">for</a> <a href="http://slate.msn.com/id/2106119">truth</a>. Expect <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/2004/complete/la-na-money3sep03,1,3981827.story?coll=la-elect2004-complete">more of the same</a>.
</li>
<li>Voters&#8217; high-minded claims notwithstanding, negative attacks work. Witness the just-completed Republican Senate primary in Florida, which pitted the very conservative Bill McCollum against the previously somewhat conservative Mel Martinez. The winner would move on to compete against Betty Castor for the Senate slot opened by Bob Graham&#8217;s impending retirement. <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A62523-2004Sep4.html">Let&#8217;s watch</a>:<br />
<br />
<blockquote>&#8230; a political storm is roiling Florida&#8217;s U.S. Senate race, fueled by       hard-hitting accusations that Republican nominee Mel R. Martinez leveled against his chief rival in the closing days of this past Tuesday&#8217;s GOP primary.</p>
<p>The attacks infuriated some prominent Republicans, and Democrats hope the discord will help their nominee, Betty Castor, win the closely watched contest to succeed retiring Sen. Bob Graham (D).</p>
<p>President Bush handpicked Martinez &#8230; considered more centrist than early GOP front-runner Bill McCollum. McCollum, a solidly conservative former House member, lost the 2000 Senate race to Democrat Bill Nelson, and many Republicans felt they needed a more moderate nominee this year.</p>
<p>But Martinez&#8217;s campaign was hardly moderate in its homestretch assault on McCollum. First, it arranged a conference call by conservative religious leaders who challenged McCollum&#8217;s integrity because of his support of embryonic stem cell research and a hate crimes bill. Enraged, former Republican senator Connie Mack wrote to more than 15,000 state GOP activists, saying Martinez&#8217;s campaign &#8220;sunk to a new low in Florida politics&#8221; by launching a &#8220;mean-spirited, desperate and personal attack&#8221; that would &#8220;only hurt our party and doom us in November.&#8221;</p>
<p>A few days later, the Martinez campaign labeled McCollum &#8220;the new darling of the extreme homosexuals&#8221; because he had supported including protections for gays in a failed federal hate-crimes bill. Editorial pages condemned the comment, and the St. Petersburg Times withdrew its endorsement of Martinez.<br />
</p></blockquote>
<p>Did it work? Yes:<br />
<br />
<blockquote>Martinez, who had trailed in several polls, won the primary with 45 percent of the vote to McCollum&#8217;s 31 percent. Martinez and his allies in the GOP establishment immediately tried to heal the hurts.<br />

<p>That&#8217;s right, by going negative, Martinez went from behind in the polls to defeating McCollum by a 3:2 margin.</p>
<p>How negative was this successful campaign? McCollum won&#8217;t even endorse his former rival:<br />
<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;I intend to reach out to [McCollum] in a way that will erase the problems that have existed,&#8221; Martinez said the day after the election. &#8220;I&#8217;ll do right by Bill; he&#8217;s a good man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8230; An unplacated McCollum, however, refused to endorse Martinez, at least until they meet sometime this week.<br />

</ul>
<p>So let&#8217;s suppose that full-on attacks are very effective, as recent (and <a href="http://www.geocities.com/genebrooks/atwater.html">distant</a>) <a href="http://www.democrats.org/specialreports/gop_negative/sc.html">evidence strongly suggests</a>. Moreover, supporting documentation is not even required. Given these conditions, what would total political war against Bush look like? Here&#8217;s a start:<br />

<ul>
<li>A commercial juxtaposing the President reading from My Pet Goat with the towers burning. Voiceover: &#8220;While America was under attack, here&#8217;s what your president was doing.&#8221; End with headlines describing the President spending 9/11 hiding out in air bases and locations other than DC. For good measure, add that &#8220;Osama bin Laden remains at large.&#8221;</p>
</li>
<li>A commercial about Bush&#8217;s failure to serve. Start with this quote from The Dallas Morning News, Feb. 25, 1990:<br />
<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;I was not prepared to shoot my eardrum out with a shotgun in order to get a deferment. Nor was I willing to go to Canada. So I chose to better myself by learning how to fly airplanes.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Then cut to Lt. Colonel Bill Burkett <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/">alleging that he witnessed</a> Bush&#8217;s National Guard records being scrubbed, and point out that Bush has never accounted for <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/politics/president/bush/articles/2004/09/05/bushs_national_guard_file_missing_records/">his whereabouts </a>during 1972 and 1973, nor why <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/politicselections/nation/president/2004-08-23-bush-service_x.htm">he stopped flying</a>. Then end with Linda Allison:<br />
<br />
<blockquote>Before there was Karl Rove, Lee Atwater or even James Baker, the Bush family&#8217;s political guru was a gregarious newspaper owner and campaign consultant from Midland, Texas, named Jimmy Allison. In the spring of 1972, George H.W. Bush phoned his friend and asked a favor: Could Allison find a place on the Senate campaign he was managing in Alabama for his troublesome eldest son, the 25-year-old George W. Bush?</p>
<p>&#8220;The impression I had was that Georgie was raising a lot of hell in Houston, getting in trouble and embarrassing the family, and they just really wanted to get him out of Houston and under Jimmy&#8217;s wing,&#8221; Allison&#8217;s widow, Linda, told me. &#8220;And Jimmy said, &#8216;Sure.&#8217; He was so loyal.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8230; Asked if she&#8217;d ever seen Bush in a uniform, Allison said: &#8220;Good lord, no. I had no idea that the National Guard was involved in his life in any way.&#8221;<br />
</p></blockquote>
</li>
<li>And as long as unfounded and unsupported attacks are fair game, don&#8217;t forget the <a href="http://www.democrats.com/display.cfm?id=159">Bush Abortion story</a>. There&#8217;s no evidence, but hey, the Swift Boat Veterans not only lack evidence, their story contradicts all available documentary evidence! And don&#8217;t forget Clinton&#8217;s love-child!</li>
<p>
<li>And don&#8217;t forget that Bush <a href="http://www.bushwatch.com/bushcoke.htm">won&#8217;t say when he stopped using cocaine</a>. Sure, this is nearly on the level of &#8220;When did you stop beating your wife?&#8221;, but that&#8217;s where this campaign is heading. Perhaps more accurately, that&#8217;s where the Bush side of this campaign already is. This would surely be less egregious than <a href="http://www.arktimes.com/020698coverstory.htm">Falwell and Robertson pushing the Clinton Chronicles video</a>, complete with tales of Clinton running a drug ring out of the Mena, Arkansas airport.</p>
</li>
<li>I&#8217;m not sure whether it would resonate, but there&#8217;s also fodder in the fairly well-documented story of <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/campaigns/wh2000/stories/bush073099.htm">Bush&#8217;s string of business failures</a>, complete with bailouts by friends of his father, throughout the 1980s.
</li>
<li>Bring back <a href="http://archive.salon.com/health/log/2000/01/20/harry_and_louise/">Henry and Louise</a> to talk about eating dog food after their <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-medicare4sep04,1,6389530.story?coll=la-home-headlines">Medicare premiums increase 17%</a>. (Since this is true, documented, and contemporary, it may not even count as negative.)
</li>
<li>And I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m missing some; this is just a quick look at what a negative campaign would look like.<br />
</li>
</ul>
<p>Who would pay for and run these ads? Certainly not the Kerry campaign. And, except in very mild versions, not the DNC. Probably not even MoveOn, which spin notwithstanding, is not even remotely in Swift Boat Veterans territory in terms of extremism or detachment from the truth. No, Democrats will need some truly Shadowy groups, brand new 527s that spring up, launch ads and push polls in key states, and then fade away. I&#8217;m not sure who would pay for them, but there is an ever-growing number of angry Democrats out there, so the money is surely out there.</p>
<p>Am I really advocating this? Not yet; this is something I really don&#8217;t want to see. But as soon as any of <a href="http://www.newsmax.com/adv/kerry_mag/">this stuff shows up</a> in the big media outlets, Rush and Hannity, TV or radio ads, or in push polls, I&#8217;ll change my mind. And I think it&#8217;s much more likely than not that I will change my mind; an issues-based campaign simply does not work in Bush&#8217;s favor. Median income is somewhere between down and flat, jobs are down, the 1000th US death in Iraq will likely sweep the news between now and the election, Medicare premiums are going up, seniors don&#8217;t like the prescription drug benefit, the deficit is sky high, Osama remains at large, and so on &#8230;</p>
<p>I suppose there&#8217;s some hope that inter-campaign collusion could stave this off. Something along the lines of &#8220;We&#8217;ll run ads (indirectly, of course) on X if, and only if, you guys run ads on Y&#8221;, where X might be ads based on distorting Kerry&#8217;s Winter Soldier testimony and Y might be ads based on Bush&#8217;s missing year.  Of course, this assumes that the campaigns are able to direct, or at least veto, third party ads by their supporters, which I believe they can.</p>
<p>Another problem with an arrangement like this is that if one candidate is clearly behind in the polls, he has little to lose from breaking the covenant. Similarly, if the race is close, then each side will have an incentive to break the agreement just before the election. Anticipating this, neither side will expect it to hold, so there&#8217;s little reason to abide by such an agreement in the first place. (It&#8217;s basically a repeated Prisoners&#8217; Dilemma with a finite and known time horizon.)</p>
<p>AB</p>
<p>ADDENDUM: As he often does, Digby puts my state of mind <a href="http://www.digbysblog.blogspot.com/2004_08_29_digbysblog_archive.html#109433232743958616">into words rather nicely</a>:<br />
<br />
<blockquote>I reluctantly concluded that the only effective response was probably to engage in the same kind of smear and hope it becomes a zero sum game. And, in the process, we would be forced to drive our politics further and further into a fetid sewer. I find the prospect of that deeply depressing which is what distinguishes me from a Republican. They do not have that emotional reaction. Indeed, they are energized by the prospect. It&#8217;s a problem.</p>
<p>Still, the stakes are so high that we have no choice but to try to win today by any means necessary and begin the hard work of repairing our politics &#8212; and honestly, our culture &#8212; after we have wrested power from those who have brought us to this place.</p></blockquote>

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>

                                <p>This Labor Day weekend is a good time to discuss two ways of viewing the state of the U.S. labor market.  The President’s reaction to the August employment report was to suggest that the fall in the unemployment rate was a sign of an improving labor market.  But the unemployment rate is simply one minus the ratio of employment as measured by the Household Survey (E) relative to the measured civilian labor force (F).  With E rising by a mere 21,000, the reason that the unemployment rate fell is simply that F fell, which was due to a fall in the civilian labor force participation rate from 66.2% to 66.0%.  This civilian labor force participation rate is the ratio of F to the civilian adult population (P).  [All data taken from the <a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2">FRED</a> database from the St. Louis Federal Reserve, which provides some near graphs.]</p>
<p>Several economists have suggested that the ratio of employment to the civilian adult population (let EP = E/P) is a better measure of the strength of the labor market.   EP was 64.4% when Bush took office but fell to 62.2% by August 2003.  For many months, EP remained virtually constant even as the Employment Survey was showing moderately strong employment growth.  Some have suggested that employment growth has barely kept pace with population growth, but we noted earlier that the Household Survey was showing less growth for 2004 than the Employment Survey.  We also noted, however, the jump in the Household Survey measure in July offset this tendency.  So the 62.4% EP ratio reported as of August 2004 can be reasonably compared to the 62.2% figure a year ago to note that there has been a very modest improvement in the labor market situation.  I shall also suggest that this measure is a better measure than the unemployment rate because of the decline in F/P, which was 67.2% as of January 2001 but only 66.0% as of August 2004.  (We noted <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2004/08/employment-delong-v-mankiw.html">here</a> how Brad DeLong challenged the notion that the drop in civilian labor force participation was voluntary).</p>
<p>If the natural EP ratio is 64.4%, then the 62.2% EP ratio as of August 2003 suggests we should have had 142.651 million employed as P was 221.507 million.  Since E was only 137.693 million, this measure suggests unemployment was 4.958 million.  The 62.4% EP ratio last month suggests we should have had 144.048 million employed as P was 223.667 million.  Since E was only 139.681 million, this measure suggests unemployment was 4.367 million, that is, a mere 12% reduction.</p>
<p>Some Bush apologists are arguing we should not try to get back to an employment market where EP = 64.4%, which is odd since the Bush Administration still argues the economy was weakening when it took office.  But EP’s peak in early 2000 was only 64.7%.  Noting that EP reached 63.9% in July 1997 and continued to rise staying above this level through April 2004, it is reasonable to argue that the natural rate of EP is at least 64%.  If the natural EP ratio is 64%, then the 62.2% EP ratio as of August 2003 suggests we should have had 141.764 million employed.  This estimate suggests unemployment was 4.071 million.  The 62.4% EP ratio last month suggests we should have had 143.153 million employed.  This estimate suggests unemployment has fallen to 3.472 million, that is, a 15% reduction over the last year.  </p>
<p>Unless one argues that there has been a reduction in American’s desire to work since 2001, any reasonable measure of the natural EP rate suggests two things: (1) we are still far below full employment; and (2) the recovery over the last year has lowered the employment gap by an amount between 12% and 15%.<br /></p>

                                <p>As has been pointed out here in several posts over the past few months (e.g., see <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2004/09/household-income-rising-or-falling.html">here</a>, <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2004/08/rising-health-costs-short-run-job-loss.html">here</a>, and <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2004/08/health-insurance-problem.html">here</a>), the rapidly rising cost of health care in the US is a large and growing problem.  In <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A57466-2004Sep2.html">his speech</a> the other night, Bush reiterated his plan to get the rising cost of health care in the US under control:</p>
<blockquote><p>To make health care more affordable and accessible, we must pass medical liability reform now.</p></blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s his plan.  He will try to contain rising health care costs by limiting the awards that people can receive from malpractice lawsuits.(*) </p>
<p>What effect is that likely to have on health care costs in this country?  According to a <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/showdoc.cfm?index=4968&#038;sequence=0">CBO briefing on the subject</a>, the total cost of malpractice lawsuits in the US was about $24 billion in 2002, up from about $21 billion in 2000.  Their estimates are that significant tort reform may be able to cut these costs by 25 to 30 percent, thereby reducing some of this country&#8217;s health care costs by $6 or $7 billion per year.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the total cost of health care in the US was about $1,557 billion in 2003, an increase of about $110 billion from 2002.  If tort reform had been passed earlier this year, and every dollar saved from reduced malpractice suits was passed on to consumers, then the effect on the country&#8217;s health care bill would (with luck) have been to reduce it from perhaps $1,670bn in 2004 all the way down to $1,663bn.  Instead of a 7.2% increase in health care costs, we would have been faced with a 6.8% increase in health care costs this year.  Of course, this would only be a one-time savings, and would have little or no impact on the growth of our health care costs in subsequent years.  </p>
<p>Such figures suggest that tort reform would effectively do <strong><em>absolutely nothing</em></strong> to reduce health care costs in this country.</p>
<p>What about possible gains through the reduction in &#8220;defensive medicine,&#8221; which is the possibility that physicians may be ordering unnecessary procedures due to fear of malpractice lawsuits?  Some partisan groups (e.g. the Bush White House) have argued that such reductions in health care expenditures would be so large that they would reduce health care costs by around 3 percent.  Even if such large estimates were correct, this means that there would be a one-time slowdown in the growth of health care costs from 7% p.a. to 4% p.a., with the rate rising back to 7% p.a. thereafter.  Not exactly a major change in the country&#8217;s health care bill.</p>
<p>But such large estimates are not correct.  The best non-partisan estimate of the effects on defensive medicine again comes from the CBO report.  That report agrees that a few studies have shown some reduction in a few specific medical procedures when state-by-state tort reform has been enacted.  However, the CBO then says that it &#8220;found no evidence that restrictions on tort liability reduce [overall] medical spending.&#8221;  The CBO&#8217;s best guess right now is that there would be little to no savings due to a reduction in defensive medicine.  </p>
<p>In a nutshell, medical liability tort reform is a red herring.  Malpractice lawsuits have an insignificant impact on the nation&#8217;s overall health care spending, and curbing them will do virtually nothing to change the cost of health care in this country.  Bush has no interest in <a href="http://www.johnkerry.com/issues/health_care/health_care.html">policies that would have a real impact</a> on health care costs.  His solution is no solution.</p>
<p>Kash </p>
<p>(*) To be fair, Bush also has floated a couple of health care policy proposals that would shift the burden of health care costs from some people to others; but this is his only proposal designed to actually try to limit the overall cost of health care.<br /></p>

Bush&#8217;s audience of thousands in West Allis, Wis., booed. Bush did nothing to stop them.</p></blockquote>
<p>In fairness, Kevin provides the sound clip in an update and admits the boos were not that loud.  But I had told a colleague who simply said “They’re Robots”.  Since we know Bush-Cheney pre-screens audiences to get just the right responses during his speeches, could it be – Stepford Voters?  </p>
<p>Incidentally, Mr. President: we wish you a speedy recovery!<br /></p>

                                <p><em>The Effects of Replacing Most Federal Taxes with a National Sales Tax A State-by-State Distributional Analysis </em>by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy <a href="http://www.itepnet.org/sale0904.pdf">begins</a> by quoting President Bush:</p>
<blockquote><p>You know, I’m not exactly sure how big the national sales tax is going to have to be, but it’s the kind of interesting idea that we ought to explore seriously.</p></blockquote>
<p>This paper does and notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>H.R. 25 confusingly advertises its sales tax rate as 23 percent, but that’s rather disingenuous. On a $100 purchase, for example, sales-tax proponents tell us that the tax would be $30, which most people would accurately call a 30 percent rate.</p></blockquote>
<p>This paper also argues that a more realistic estimate of the necessary tax rate would be between 50% and 60%.  The main purpose of the paper, however, is to examine the distributional implications of the sales tax with this highlight:</p>
<blockquote><p>In virtually every state in the union, the bottom 80 percent of taxpayers would face much higher taxes under a sales tax. Nationwide, these tax increases would average about $3,200 a year. Put another way, on average the 80 percent of Americans in the middle- and lower income ranges would pay 51 percent more in sales taxes than they now pay in the federal taxes that the proposed national sales tax would replace. In contrast, the best-off one percent of all taxpayers nationwide would get average tax reductions of about $225,000 each per year.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>Since Sec. Snow and Sec. Chao preferred the Household Survey numbers last month, let’s oblige them this month too.  This measure has employment rising by only 21,000.  President Bush is currently touting the fall in the unemployment rate.  But he forget to tell the audience that the reason this rate fell is that the reported civilian labor force fell by 152,000.  Finally, the employment to population rate fell from 62.5% in July to 62.4% in August.  One has to wonder if Sec. Snow and Sec. Chao will mention these numbers this month.<br /></p>

<blockquote><p>Nonfarm payroll employment rose by 144,000 in August, and the unemployment rate was little changed at 5.4 percent, the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the U.S. Department of Labor reported today.  Over the month, job growth occurred in several service-providing industries.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is a decent employment report, in line with expectations, but nothing great.  Some new jobs were created, but just barely enough to keep up with population growth.  The result will be that Bush&#8217;s legacy at the time of the election will be a total net loss of roughly 1 million jobs during his presidency.  A remarkable acheivement.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p><strong>Postcards from Old Europe &#8211; Out of Balance</strong></p>
<p>The economic news flow in the last couple of weeks was dominated by the price of oil. Other data releases were mostly relegated to the minor leagues ore duly reported and then ignored.</p>
<p>Take the June trade deficit which was reported at the beginning of August. Jaded watchers of the economy registered that it was worse again and then went on with their business. Andy Warhol would probably have said that any economic indicator can be a star for 15 minutes. </p>
<p>The fact that the trade deficit for June had reached a new record of around $56bn just didn&#8217;t grab the market&#8217;s attention for long. Was this justified? Some might argue that it was &#8211; and is &#8211; justified. Aren&#8217;t terrorism, the high price of oil and the US election much more pressing concerns than a number from the governments ledger?</p>
<p>Well maybe. The short term is dominated by the issues mentioned above, but I&#8217;m convinced that the trade deficit (and the budgetary one as well for that matter) will pose rather large challenges for policy makers in the medium term.</p>
<p>Many people&#8217;s knee-jerk reaction to the deficit number was that the $9bn monthly deterioration of the trade balance could surely be ascribed to the higher price of oil. This is not true. The higher price of oil added just around $1.7bn to the import bill. Imports of other goods rose by $3bn &#8211; a rather large number but by no means astounding. The real culprit here is the implosion in exports. Exports of goods were weaker across the board with capital goods decreasing the most. The Department of Commerce writes<br />
<blockquote>The May to June change in exports of goods reflected decreases in capital goods ($2.6 billion); industrial supplies and materials ($1.3 billion); foods, feeds, and beverages($0.3 billion); automotive vehicles, parts, and engines ($0.3 billion); and consumer goods ($0.1 billion). An increase occurred in other goods ($0.3 billion).</p></blockquote>
<p>It is obvious that a further reduction in exports will turbocharge the growth of the deficit if imports do not fall.</p>
<p>The problem is that imports do not at all look as if they are going to do us that favor. The last time imports dropped was during the recession in 2001. It subsequently took them just one year after the recession&#8217;s end to power past the previous high reached in 2000. Imports in real terms have been rising at a rate of almost 12% over the past years.</p>
<p>Exports are something different altogether &#8211; they were also impacted by the recession and still haven&#8217;t reached the level seen in the year 2000. The rate of (real) export growth comes in at somewhere around 9%. To sum it up: imports are growing at a higher rate than exports and imports are much higher in nominal value.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t really want to imagine what will happen to the deficit if exports now start to weaken. Something will have to give and I suspect that that something will be the US currency. The dollar has been weakening vs. the currencies of its major trading partners over the past couple of years. The only problem is that this hasn&#8217;t led to a reduction in imports or a higher rate of exports.</p>
<p>One reason that a falling dollar hasn&#8217;t impacted imports is that it hasn&#8217;t done all that much to import prices. Foreign producers have preferred to take a hit in their profit margins instead of raising prices to counter the effects of a weakening dollar. </p>
<p>The other side of the equation is the fact that foreigners &#8211; and especially foreign central banks &#8211; have been willing to invest cold hard cash in the US. This capital inflow has taken the pressure off of the US currency over the past months. If the US starts looking like its rate of growth is going to slow, foreigners might find that investing in the US isn&#8217;t such a good proposition after all.</p>
<p>Slowing growth might also present the next administration with a logical policy choice: a weak currency. The simple fact of the matter is that imports are still &#8220;too cheap&#8221; to change consumer&#8217;s spending habits while exports are still too expensive to entice foreigners into buying them. I wouldn&#8217;t put it past an incoming administration to strong-arm foreign central banks into reducing their pace of currency intervention whilst simultaneously talking down the dollar. </p>
