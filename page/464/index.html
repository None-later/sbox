                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>This is a *demand side* argument in favor of Fama&#8217;s claim that deficit spending crowds out private spending one for one.</p>
<p>My<a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/03/its-dirty-rotten-job-but-someones-got.html"> earlier effort</a> was to argue that the aggregate supply curve can be vertical (real aggregate supply is not affected by nominal aggregate dmeand) even when there is involuntary unemployment.  I think I get bonus points for appealing to Stiglitz in defence of Fama, but now I want to go alllll the way.</p>
<p>So I will assume that the aggregate supply curve is horizontal (increased demand causes increased supply and has no effect on the price level).</p>
<p>Now it is clear that we have, at least, a communication problem here.  Fama does finance not macro and no one can argue that he used standard Macro notation in all of his blog posts.  In his first post <a href="http://www.dimensional.com/famafrench/2009/01/bailouts-and-stimulus-plans.html">[link needed]</a> he presented an argument using the symbols S and I.  He treated S as a state variable.  In standard notation S is a flow variable &#8212; disposable income minus consumption.  It is, therefore, not predetermined. It can jump.  Depending on when you consider people to have earned income it is either very very high at 2 am or very very low on weekends.  </p>
<p>Ooops.  Now Brad DeLong had a theory that the problem was I and that Fama didn&#8217;t know that unsold goods count in I as inventory investment.  Most people thought Fama was confusing S with the accumulated wealth (confusingly called savings leading to a standard warning in all introductory undergraduate macro texts which I have read).</p>
<p>Then a commenter at Brad&#8217;s blog <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2009/01/eugene-fama-rederives-the-treasury-view-a-guestpost-from-montagu-norman.html">[link needed (first comment or search for pedro)]</a> came up with another theory.  Fama wasn&#8217;t talking about S he was talking about M.  He was asserting that the velocity of money is constant.  Indeed, Fama&#8217;s <a href="http://www.dimensional.com/famafrench/2009/01/bailouts-and-stimulus-plans---addendum-12809.html">follow up post </a>definitely referred to a stock (&#8220;the same funds&#8221;) and might be interpreted as a reference to M1, M2 or something.  So maybe Fama thought that velocity &#8212; the ratio of nominal GNP to the money stock &#8212; is constant. </p>
<p>The problem is that we have data on money and that ratio is not constant.  It pretended to be a constant (really a predictable declining exponential trend) until Milton Friedman won the Nobel Prize (for unrelated work) then it began changing unpredictably.  It is currently falling like a stone.  Asserting that monetary velocity is constant is admitting that one hasn&#8217;t read or hasn&#8217;t understood a Newspaper at least since the crisis began.</p>
<p>Now I think only two kinds of people are interested in these issues 1) people who enjoy the humiliation and suffering of others and want to see Fama and his disciples squirm and 2) gluttons for punishment.  I say enough with S&#038;M.</p>
<p>The point is that Fama did not specify what stock he was talking about when he wrote <a href="http://www.dimensional.com/famafrench/2009/01/bailouts-and-stimulus-plans---addendum-12809.html">&#8220;the same funds&#8221;</a>.  Money is not the only nominal stock in the economy.  In fact, it has been argued that the quantity with stable velocity (just means a stable ratio between it and nominal GNP) is not money but &#8220;Total Credit.&#8221;  Now that has declined for sure.  It is not blindingly obvious how government spending would cause it to increase.  If the velocity of total credit is constant, then there will be crowding out.  No one has proven, in response to Fama, that this ratio (nominal GNP)/(total credit) is not constant.  Nor has anyone explained why it should depend on safe short term nominal interest rates (most credit is for sure not safe these days).</p>
<p>Now the best part.  The author of the total credit theory is Friedman, not Milton, Benjamin Friedman.  He is the saltiest of salt water economists.  I think that he and he alone is the focus of the most intense disdain of the fresh water school (what&#8217;s in a name and think about what you think of Robert Samuelson).</p>
<p>Oh what joy it was to use Stiglitz to defend Fama, but to appeal to Benjamin Friedman to heal the self inflicted wounds of the Chicago school is very heaven.</p>

                                <p>Tom Bozzo</p>
<p>In this round-up of &#8220;experts&#8221; (Cramer?!) on whether to &#8220;<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/06/AR2009030602955.html">soak the Rich</a>&#8221; at the WaPo (the title of which, given the actual Obama budget plans, reminds one that mainstream discourse has really lost sight of the true rich-soaking possibilities), what really bugged me was this from Laura D&#8217;Andrea Tyson selling spending restraint in the Obama budget:<br />
<blockquote>It is a shibboleth among critics that President Obama&#8217;s budget relies almost exclusively on tax increases on the wealthy to fund increases in government spending, yet this not an accurate representation of the facts&#8230;</p>
<p>It reduces non-defense discretionary spending to 3.6 percent of GDP, compared with an average of 3.8 percent between 1969 and 2008. [emphasis added]</p></blockquote>
<p>This begs the question of why the level of non-defense discretionary spending from an era of mostly Republican presidents and lately Republican Congresses should be considered adequate.  Indeed, there seem to be more <a href="http://www.asce.org/reportcard/2009/">public investment funding shortfalls</a> than funds so far committed to them.</p>
<p>Now a clever and socially useful direction signaled in the stimulus package is to address transition problems upfront for, e.g., sensible climate policy so the future implicit or explicit taxes aren&#8217;t seen as quite so much of a hold-up for those unfortunate enough to have taken extra advantage of the legacy policy of free emissions.  Properly executed, that can help keep the well-intentioned but wobbly on board with programs that need all the support that can be mustered to overcome entrenched interests.  The risk is getting no more than the appearance of transformation, which would represent at a minimum a lost opportunity — especially given that it may be dawning on the public that not everything in the U.S. is optimally arranged.</p>
<p>Perhaps some of the administration&#8217;s policies can be implemented as tax expenditures to direct private-sector activity in accordance with public policy, and I suppose (but don&#8217;t know) that might not be included in the 3.6 percent.  Some areas may be so starved for funding that they&#8217;re regarded as hard to get off the ground quickly, though that&#8217;s not so much of an issue over the longer planning horizons of the regular budget.  It seems unavoidable that seriously unscrewing up the transportation and energy networks, the publicly-funded education system, and so on will at some point require some serious funding beyond the couple percent of GDP of extra stimulus spending.  The administration might as well figure out what they really want and make a case for it, since as we&#8217;ve seen from the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/03/on-economic-advice-john-mccain-is.html">Kevin Hassetts</a> among other right-wing, uh, luminaries, they&#8217;re going to be tarred as dirty commies by the right whatever they do.</p>

<p>Citigroup (nyse: C &#8211; news &#8211; people ) Chief Executive Vikram Pandit released a memo on Tuesday saying that the bank had been profitable in the first two months of 2009, and that was confident about its capital strength. (See &#8220;Pandit Paints Rosy Picture.”) </p></blockquote>
<p>Investors still believe in corporate profit statements.</p>
<p>Pandit is a pundit (I think that pandit is the correct spelling anyway).</p>
<p>Geithner said he was doing a good job and so investors were convinced.</p>
<p>To be Frank, the fact that Barney can move stock prices almost reconciles me to investor insanity.</p>
<p>If the US economy survives, we will owe it to Atlantic City and the Mohegans (reports of whose tragic end were greatly exaggerated and also their name was misspelled) who are offering these maniacs a way to gamble without destroying the economy.</p>

<p>Andrew Biggs <a target="_blank" href="http://andrewgbiggs.blogspot.com/2009/03/charleston-post-courier-opposition-not.html">references</a> an editorial from the  Charleston SC Post and Courier <a target="_blank" href="http://www.charleston.net/news/2009/mar/10/advance_entitlement_reform74401/">Advance Entitlements Reform</a><br />
<blockquote>However, President Obama&#8217;s major entitlement-reform offensive strikes on the Medicare front. He proposed, in his speech to Congress, to deliver &#8220;quality, affordable health care for every American&#8221; while also bringing runaway costs under control. That challenging goal contradicts the president&#8217;s contention, in the same speech, that he doesn&#8217;t believe in &#8220;bigger government.&#8221;</p>
<p>But just as Democrats, including then-Sen. Obama, shouldn&#8217;t have rejected President George W. Bush&#8217;s Social Security reform proposals without offering coherent counterproposals, Republicans who oppose President Obama&#8217;s health-care ideas should offer tangible counterproposals on Medicare reform, too.</p></blockquote>
<p> And then Biggs comments as follows<br />
<blockquote>In 2005, there was little public or media pressure on Democrats to put their own Social Security reform plan on the table; it was sufficient that they merely oppose President Bush&#8217;s plan. I suspect the same won&#8217;t be true for Obama&#8217;s health proposals, so those who wish to take a different path on health care shouldn&#8217;t be complacent that opposition is enough.</p></blockquote>
<p>The second assertion is perfectly sound, every serious person agrees that the current track of medical inflation is unsustainable, either we need to restrict coverage even more or find some other way to control costs in a way that allows us to maintain or hopefully expand coverage, doing &#8220;Nothing&#8221; not being a credible alternative. But the same is not true for Social Security, the situations are just not as symmetrical as Biggs would have us believe. Before explaining why I want to include the two paragraphs immediately following from the Post and Courier editorial.<br />
<blockquote>The status quo will lock Medicare on a track toward a balance-sheet train wreck. Medicare trustees warned last year that the system, on its present course, would run out of money by 2019.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, such familiar alarms about Medicare — and Social Security — have long fallen on deaf ears, perpetuating delays in dealing with their problems. With each buck-passing postponement of the hard choices required to achieve long-term solvency, the tasks get more expensive, and thus more likely to send politicians running for cover.</p></blockquote>
<p>Oops. There are a couple of errors operating here. To see what they are you can follow me below the fold. </p>
<p>As to Medicare. First of all Medicare is not a monolith, its various Parts draw their funding from different sources. That is Part B-Doctors and Part D-Drugs draw their funding from the General Fund and as such cannot &#8220;run out of money&#8221; anymore than the Defense Department can. The decision of whether to finance visits to the doctor&#8217;s office vs buying F-22s is a policy choice and not on a inevitable track to anywhere, still less a &#8220;balance-sheet wreck&#8221;. So that is error number one.</p>
<p>Error number two is a little more subtle. Medicare Part A-Hospital, which makes up just over half of overall Medicare is indeed funded by payroll taxes whose surpluses and deficits are credited to the HI (Hospital Insurance) Trust Fund. And that Trust Fund is indeed slated for depletion in 2019. Does that mean that Part A will &#8220;run out of money&#8221;. Well no, not in the sense that the editorial implies. To see why we need to step back and look at the language of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cms.hhs.gov/ReportsTrustFunds/downloads/tr2008.pdf">2008 Medicare Report</a> itself.<br />
<blockquote>Under the intermediate assumptions the HI trust fund is projected to be exhausted in 2019, the same year as in last year’s report but at an earlier point within the year, due to slightly lower projected payroll tax income and slightly higher projected benefits than previously estimated. For the 75-year projection period, the actuarial deficit is virtually the same as in last year’s report, at 3.54 rather than 3.55 percent of taxable payroll.</p></blockquote>
<p>If we unpack this a little we see that not much harm was done by doing &#8220;Nothing&#8221; in 2007, you got a little slippage in the date of Trust Fund Depletion offset somewhat by a tiny bit of improvement in the actual actuarial deficit. In contrast lets look at the equivalent passage in the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cms.hhs.gov/ReportsTrustFunds/downloads/tr2007.pdf">2007 Medicare Report</a><br />
<blockquote>Under the intermediate assumptions the HI trust fund is projected to be exhausted in 2019, 1 year later than in last year’s report, due to slightly higher projected payroll tax income and slightly lower projected benefits than previously estimated. For the 75-year projection period, the actuarial deficit is little different from that in last year’s report, at 3.55 rather than 3.51 percent of taxable payroll.</p></blockquote>
<p>That is if you had just jumped from the 2006 Report to the 2008 you would have seen HI Trust Fund Depletion pushed back by a year even as the actuarial gap increased from 3.51% to 3.54%. This isn&#8217;t an argument for doing &#8220;Nothing&#8221; for Medicare but it renders this from the editorial as being somewhat over heated: <i>With each buck-passing postponement of the hard choices required to achieve long-term solvency, the tasks get more expensive</i>. Well maybe yes and maybe no. Because as we can see the process is not linear, better payroll receipts can push the depletion date back, worse ones can move it up, but in the end Medicare Part A can never run OUT of money in the absolute sense, it can only run SHORT of money. The distinction may seem academic but it is the difference between maybe needing to ration care and cutting off Medicare altogether. The Post and Courier is shouting apocalypse while reality is stating problem. This is particularly so when the proposed solution to some projected shortfall necessitating rationing in 2019 is just to start rationing care today, that just defines the problem as the solution.</p>
<p>Still the editorial&#8217;s overall point on Medicare is sound, the Republicans really just can&#8217;t be the party of &#8216;No&#8217; on Health Care. But the same is not true of Democrats on Social Security. When Biggs states the following he is establishing a false parallel.<br />
<blockquote>In 2005, there was little public or media pressure on Democrats to put their own Social Security reform plan on the table; it was sufficient that they merely oppose President Bush&#8217;s plan.</p></blockquote>
<p>First of all there was some media pressure, it is just that the push-back came in the form of &#8216;There is no crisis&#8217; on the sensible grounds that there was a big difference between a problem that probably would manifest itself by 2018 or so (Medicare) and certainly would do so before mid-century (Health Care generally) and a problem that might manifest itself by 2041 and was in any event on a much smaller scale (Social Security). To lift my own comment from Biggs (additions in italics).<br />
<blockquote>Democrats had a coherent counterproposal. It just was too simple to be comprehended by the Post and Courier.</p>
<p>Take 1.89%. <i>Payroll gap per 2004 Report</i> Add four years of &#8216;Nothing&#8217;. Result? 1.7% <i>Payroll gap per 2008 Report</i><br />http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR04/II_conclu.html#wp86802</p>
<p>Now you can take other starting and ending points. For example I could take 2004 and 2006 and get the results 1.89% and 2.02%. Or I could change measures and use 2004 and 2008 to yield 2042 and 2041. And then if you like do some elaborate calculations to calculate the savings or loss in current dollars of not implementing a fix in 2004.</p>
<p>No one has to agree with Dean Baker that this is just a Phony Crisis promulgated by people &#8220;who say they want to fix the roof (but) actually want to knock holes in it&#8221;. And there may be some force in the argument that unfunded liability over the Infinite Future Horizon creates serious issues of inter-generational inequity that will need to be addressed at some point or another. (Personally I am with Dean and think the latter argument is hooey.)</p>
<p>But wherever you land on the fundamental question the twin assertions of &#8220;We can&#8217;t afford to wait&#8221; and &#8220;The cost will only get greater if we delay&#8221; just are not supported by the historical record from 1997 to 2008. Now oddly they were supported by that record from 1993 to 1996 and retrospectively they may end up being supported by the record from 2008-2011. But from the actual standpoint of March 2009 there just isn&#8217;t a whole bunch of the &#8220;Fierce urgency of Now&#8221; operating.</p>
<p>The 2006 Report was quite the disappointment, the outlook as a percentage of payroll having darkened significantly since 2004. Did this mean the &#8220;There is no Crisis&#8221; people of spring 2005 had egg on their face? Well not really because you could calculate with some precision the <a target="_blank" href="http://bruceweb.blogspot.com/2006/05/cost-of-inactivity-nothing-as-plan-for.html">Cost of Inactivity</a> between any two time points. And knock on wood for all &#8216;current participants&#8217; in all years and for all &#8216;future participants&#8217; in every year but 2006 the cost of sticking with the Democratic plan of &#8220;Nothing&#8221; as a plan for Social Security has been negative, that is workers have been left dollars ahead.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing&#8221; is not a particularly compelling plan, it doesn&#8217;t fit neatly within the conventions of reporting on policy. Which doesn&#8217;t mean it has not proved to be a numerically sound plan. Since 1997.</p></blockquote>
<p>That is there is no such thing as SocialSecurityMedicareMedicaid and it is not at all hypocritical for Democrats to have refused to endorse some type of reform for Social Security in 2005 while demanding Republicans get off the stump on Medicare in 2009. You simply get a fiercer urgency from 2019 than you do from 2041 (or 2049).</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing&#8221;. The numerically proven plan for Social Security since 1997.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing&#8221;. The &#8216;so far we have dodged the bullet&#8217; plan for Medicare. 2019 is not a drop dead point for Medicare, it doesn&#8217;t actually effect Parts B and D in the first place and only effects Part A in minor ways to start with (the actuarial gap being just under 1% of payroll at that point), we have the time to get Medicare the right &#8220;Something&#8221; and should. But that doesn&#8217;t mean Democrats have any obligation to budge on Social Security.</p>

<p>The <a target="_blank" href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/review/current/">St. Louis Fed</a> includes the review on monetary policy.  Figure 1 shows &#8216;currency in circulation&#8217; to be basically flat at this time, which indicates much of the new money is in excess reserves and has not entered the broader money supply.  This also begins to address in a clear way the concerns and the talk of future inflation.(h/t Movie Guy)</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/review/09/03/Gavin.pdf">More money: Understanding the increases in the monetary base</a></p>
<blockquote><p>The financial crisis that began in the summer of 2007 took a turn for the worse in September 2008. Until then, Federal Reserve actions taken to improve the functioning financial markets did not affect the monetary base. The unusual lending and purchase of private debt was offset by the sale of Treasury securities so that the total size of the balance sheet of the Fed remained relatively<br />unchanged. </p>
<p>In September, however, the Fed stopped selling securities as it made massive purchases of private debt and issued hundreds of billions of dollars in short-term loans. The result was a doubling of the size of the monetary base in the final four months of 2008. This article discusses the details of the programs that the Fed has initiated since the crisis began, shows which programs have grown as the monetary base grew, and discusses some factors that will determine whether this rapid increase in the monetary base will lead to rapid inflation.</p>
<p>[snip]</p>
<p>A logical question might be why depository institutions would choose to hold $800 billion in excess reserves that are earning so little. Two answers are important, one at the level of the individual bank and one at an aggregate level.</p></blockquote>
<p>Update:  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.debtdeflation.com/blogs/2009/01/31/therovingcavaliersofcredit/#_ftn6">Steven Keen</a> and cross posted at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/">Naked Capitalism</a> does yoeman&#8217;s work on the issues.</p>
<p>
<blockquote>First, for the individual bank, the risk-free rate of ¼ percent must be the bank’s perception of its bestinvestment opportunity. Note that on January 28, 2009, the interest rate on the 3-month Treasury bill was less than ¼ percent. The other is that,perhaps because of market conditions—the dramatic decline in the price of bank stocks and the fall in the market value of assets—the bank finds itself undercapitalized. In such conditions, the bank is likely to hold relatively more safe assets while it builds capital by cutting costs, raising fee income, and hoping for a recovery in both the economy and its stock price. </p>
<p>Second, the banking system as a whole cannot create or destroy bank deposits at the Fed. Only the Fed (and technically, the Treasury) can create or destroy bank reserves. If one bank makes a loan and the funds are deposited in another bank, then the ownership of the deposits at the Fed would change, but the total bank deposits at the Fed would remain the same. In theory, the banking system reduces excess reserves—but only by expanding loans and the money supply in a way that increases required reserves by an equivalent amount. </p>
<p>The key is that the Fed will have to drain reserves when the economy begins to recover if it is to prevent a rapid acceleration of inflation. That necessity drives the current discussion of exit strategies.8 The ease with which the Fed can reduce the size of its balance sheet in the future depends on many factors, including the term of its loan portfolio, the quality of assets that it holds outright, and the market’s appetite for repurchasing these financial instruments. The authorization for the ultimate size of new programs varies and has grown since the beginning of the crisis. Table 2 lists each new program and the upper limit authorized as of January 28, 2009. Of course, in some cases the limits will be determined by the available assets and/or by the demand for the program. (Note that there are zero assets in the MMIFF, which has an authorization of $540 billion.) </p>
<p>When the time comes to shrink the monetary base, the Fed could allow the lending programs to expire as loans mature and sell the assets that it holds outright. If the crisis is over, the assets should be priced in the market and the Fed should<br />expect to recover most of its investment in such assets.</p>
<p>Inflation does not appear to be a risk in the current environment: The economy is in recession. Inflation is falling and is not expected to return before the recession ends. If inflation resumes but the economy does not recover, policymakers will face a difficult choice. Monitoring the size and composition of the monetary base as the economy recovers will help us understand what actions are needed (and should be taken)by the Fed and the Congress to prevent a return of high inflation.</p></blockquote>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.reuters.com/article/gc04/idUSTRE5286OM20090309">Reuters</a> points to a key concern:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Inflation does not appear to be a risk in the current environment: the economy is in recession. Inflation is falling and is not expected to return before the recession ends,&#8221; according to an essay in the March/April edition of Review magazine, published by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.</p>
<p>&#8220;If inflation resumes but the economy does not recover, policy-makers will face a difficult choice. Monitoring the size and composition of the monetary base will help us understand what actions are needed,&#8221; the study said.</p>
<p>Emergency measures to flood credit markets with cash to stop them freezing in panic over bank losses doubled the size of the Fed&#8217;s balance sheet and boosted the monetary base to around $1.7 trillion.</p>
<p>Fed officials agree they need an exit strategy to soak this money back up once the recession ends. They don&#8217;t think it is an inflation risk right now because banks are still too scared to lend the extra money out in a way that would boost the broader money supply and lead to higher prices.</p></blockquote>

<p>Movie Guy, in comments, provides a beginning glimpse at trends in the realms of retirement funding:</p>
<p>Retirement funds in danger for millions of Americans  <br />By Mike Bryan  <br />6 March 2009  <br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.wsws.org/articles/2009/mar2009/reti-m06.shtml">WSWS</a>  </p>
<blockquote><p>EXCERPT:  </p>
<p>Between October 9, 2007, and October 9, 2008, equity assets in retirement plans dropped by about $4 trillion in value, according to the CRR study. State and local government defined benefit plans dropped by about $1 trillion, private employer defined benefit plans dropped by about $900 billion, private employer defined contribution plans dropped about $1.1 trillion, Individual Retirement Accounts dropped about $800 billion, and federal government thrift plans dropped about $100 billion.  </p>
<p>These dramatic shortfalls create particular problems for private employer defined benefit plans. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 contains guidelines by which a plan sponsor must eliminate any shortfall between promised benefits and assets. The CRR study estimates that &#8220;firms are going to have to increase contributions by about $90 billion in 2009.&#8221; Mercer, a global consulting firm, places the underfunding of corporate pension plans at $409 billion.  </p>
<p>&#8220;This challenge raises the question of firms laying off workers, freezing their pensions, or going bankrupt,&#8221; states the CRR (Center for Retirement Research at Boston College) study. </p></blockquote>

<p>Update:</p>
<p>Comments did not elaborate on this post  first about pensions not meeting current obligations for the soon to retire (in the decade or so), and for younger workers whose 401ks will suffer tremendously if this remains an L shaped recession (or a slow and flat recovery over time), wages remain flat as in the last decade, and inflation takes off in the future.  How does one present different scenarios?</p>

<p>Two quotes about liquidity.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/2009/03/on_friday_i_mentioned_how.php">An anonymous TPM reader <br /></a><br />
<blockquote>it is in everyone&#8217;s interest that markets be as liquid as possible. One of the factors increasing the risk of downward-spiraling markets is illiquidity &#8211; i.e., the possibility that assets may be difficult or impossible to sell when necessary either because there is no ready market or because of barriers to sale such as the lack of common standardization (and subsequent need for costly negotiation and legal review) that ISDA has helped remedy. </p>
<p></p></blockquote>
<p>(notice this is a super top secret e-mail as Marshall always suppresses readers&#8217; names.  Anonymous didn&#8217;t want even Marshall to know.)</p>
<p><a href="http://bestamericanbanks.com/01-american/06-bank-one-jp-morgan-chase.htm">John Maynard Keynes</a></p>
<blockquote><p>The spectacle of modern investment markets has sometimes moved me towards the conclusion that to make the purchase of an investment permanent and indissoluble, like a marriage, except by reason of death or other grave cause, might be a useful remedy for our contemporary evils. For this would force the investor to direct his mind to the long-term prospects and to those only. But a little consideration of this expedient brings us up against a dilemma, and shows us how the liquidity of investment markets often facilitates, though it sometimes impedes, the course of new investment. For the fact that each individual investor flatters himself that his commitment is &#8216;liquid&#8217; (though this cannot be true for all investors collectively) calms his nerves and makes him more willing to run a risk. If individual purchases of investments were rendered illiquid, this might seriously impede new investment, so long as alternative ways in which to hold his savings are available to the individual. This is the dilemma. So long as it is open to the individual to employ his wealth in hoarding or lending money, the alternative of purchasing actual capital assets cannot be rendered sufficiently attractive (especially to the man who does not manage the capital assets and knows very little about them), except by organising markets wherein these assets can be realised for money.</p>
<p>(Keynes 1936:161) </p></blockquote>
<p>(hey look at that url.  I swear it was the first google hit for the quote).</p>
<p>There does seem to be a certain divergence of views here.  Keynes reluctantly concludes that common stock should be made 100% illiquid by making it like a marriage (and a marriage in 1936 was not like a marriage in 2009).  Anonymous assumes that more liquidity is always better.</p>
<p>Note that anonymous assumes that positions which someone wants to liquidate just magically appear.  It&#8217;s not as if liquidity causes people to take huge leveraged positions because the fact that each individual investor flatter[ed] himself that his commitment is &#8216;liquid&#8217; (though this cannot be true for all investors collectively) calm[ed] his nerves and ma[de] him [too] willing to run a risk.</p>
<p>The case for liquidity is rather undermined by Keynes&#8217; parenthetical observation.  The fact is, no matter how liquid assets are, if everyone tries to liquidate them, everyone will take a bath.  Anonymous&#8217;s failure to notice this *after the fact* helps explain how liquidity managed to destroy the financial system.</p>

                                <p>Robert Waldmann</p>
<p>The word &#8220;liquidity&#8221; is slippery, since there is not a single solid agreed definition.</p>
<p>&#8220;Liquidity&#8221; refers to different things each of which is very important.  I have long been fighting the suspicion that confusion of the various meanings influences the policy debate.  I have lost the fight and now express the suspicion.</p>
<p>Briefly, I think that &#8220;liquidity&#8221; equivocations lead people to argue that high trading volume is unambiguously good.  I don&#8217;t think that people who know the various meanings of &#8220;liquidity&#8221; are confused, but I do think that they have vested interests.</p>
<p>A semantic screed after the jump.</p>
<p>The core agreed meaning is that an asset is liquid if you can buy something with it right here right now.  Cash is definitely liquid.  Other assets, such as the balances of checking accounts, are very similar to cash.  Such balances are counted in estimates of total &#8220;liquidity&#8221; here a synonym for &#8220;money.&#8221;  So the first financial definition of &#8220;liquidity&#8221; is</p>
<p>1) Liquidity n. the amount of liquid assets or &#8220;money supply&#8221;.</p>
<p>This meaning is no longer current.  It is the meaning of &#8220;liquidity&#8221; as used by Von Heyek and Von Mises.  Excess liquidity is an excessive money supply.  This old definition caused someone on the web somewhere to suggest that I was getting in touch with my inner Austrian when I wrote an earlier version of this post.  I didn&#8217;t like that.  But it isn&#8217;t a serious problem.</p>
<p>However, assets which are definitely not counted as money are called different things from not at all liquid (an entailed Feudal estate which could not be sold) to liquid (say a T-bill).  This is a different meaning of the word liquidity giving the second financial defnition of &#8220;liquidity&#8221; is derived from the definition of &#8220;liquid&#8221;</p>
<p>2) Liquidity   A property of an asset which indicates that it can be converted into money quickly and with low transaction costs.  </p>
<p>This implies that if an asset is illiquid a rational person would not be willing to buy it intending to sell it again in the near future.</p>
<p>So liquidity is the notional property that corresponds to the adjective &#8220;liquid&#8221; which refers to assets and how quickly and cheaply one can convert them into money (liquidity is to liquid as redness is to red).  According to this definition, money is perfectly liquid.  Some other assets are very liquid.</p>
<p>This is based on the verb &#8220;Liquidate.&#8221;  I think liquidate has a fairly clear meaning.  It means &#8220;sell.&#8221;  When one liquidates an asset one trades it for money, that is one &#8220;sells&#8221; it.  I have no idea why people use a 3 syllable word when there is a perfectly good one syllable word.  So a luquid asset is salable and has a lot of salableness.</p>
<p>But, you see delay and transactions costs aren&#8217;t the only problems for a seller.  </p>
<p>People selling things are very unhappy when their market price has suddenly fallen.  What if I can sell my asset right now, but I am extremely displeased by the price I am offered ?  Is it less liquid ?  Certainly not according to definition 2.  Certainly according to people who say that the problem with financial markets is a loss of liquidity.  This gives third definition</p>
<p>3) Liquidity the property of a price being as high as sellers think it should be.</p>
<p>This is clearly a magic pony definition.  No asset has ever had that property.  However, lots of people who have lost lots of other people&#8217;s money blame insufficient liquidity.</p>
<p>Between the problem of transactions costs (I&#8217;m thinking brokers&#8217; fees and Tobin taxes and stuff) and the problem that the price of what I own is lower than I would like, there is the problem of market thickness.  This is a huge issue for traders who take huge <strike> leveraged </strike> hedged positions.  The problem is that the answer to the question &#8220;can I sell or &#8220;liquidate&#8221; my holdings of asset A quickly and get close to their value at the current market price ? &#8221; depends on the answer to the question &#8220;how much do you want to sell ?&#8221;  It turns out that demand curves for financial assets aren&#8217;t flat.  Now it has been argued that, in theory, they should be.  However, they aren&#8217;t.</p>
<p>For it to be possible to sell a lot of an asset quickly at its current price it is necessary that trading volume be high so that many are bidding and asking at near the current price.  This gives a second definition of liquid (implying a third definition of liquidity).</p>
<p>4) Liquidity.  A property of an asset which indicates that a large amount of it can be converted into money quickly at a price close to its current price.</p>
<p>Now the fourth kind of liquidity is only desirable to investors who make large trades.  I rather doubt that Warren Buffet much cares about this kind of liquidity.  He doesn&#8217;t make large trades often.  I&#8217;d guess that when he wants a lot of something, he buys it slowly and quitly (up to 5% of it, that is,  he&#8217;s a law abiding man).  Notice also a certain circularity between this kind of liquidity and high trading volume.  If people want to buy and sell large amounts of assts, they want other people to be willing to sell and buy large amounts of assets.</p>
<p>For some reason people in finance have decided to call markets in which assets are liquid, liquid markets.  Thus liquidity is a property of a market and not of an asset.</p>
<p>5) Liquidity A property of a market in which assets are traded and large amounts of those assets can be sold and bought quickly at the current market price.</p>
<p>I prefer to call this property of markets &#8220;thickness.&#8221;  Roughly a market is thick if there is high trading volume, a lot of buying and selling (that&#8217;s not all there is too it, since market orders add more liquidity than orders with reservation prices but I mean I&#8217;ve been struggling with one word for paragraphs give me a break).</p>
<p>Last I heard no one had managed to explain how financial markets can be liquid according to this definition of liquid (corresponding to the 5th definition of liquidity) without assuming that there are irrational investors called &#8220;noise or liquidity traders&#8221; who trade for no good reason.  It sure sounds to me that the natural desire of traders for this kind of liquidity is a desire to have many sheep to fleece.  Basically, it is good for them that many people are willing to buy at the current price, and many willing to sell, because they can bet against such fools and win.  </p>
<p>I do not think that it should be an objective of public policy to make sure that professional traders have access to many fools so they can separate them from their money.</p>
<p>Finally ? there is a definition close to the first.  We all know what someone means when they say &#8220;I have a cash flow problem,&#8221; they mean &#8220;I&#8217;m broke but I don&#8217;t want to admit it.&#8221;  However, in theory, solvent firms (and individuals) can have cash flow problems.  If they don&#8217;t have enough cash to cover their liabilities, but do own assets which will generate revenue whose present value (at some reasonable interest rate) is equal to the present value of their liabilities, they are called &#8220;illiquid but not insolvent.&#8221;  They are said to have &#8220;a liquidity problem.&#8221;  This is a fourth definition of liquidity </p>
<p>6) Liquidity N.  fancy word for &#8220;cash flow&#8221;.</p>
<p>Somehow its about a flow not a stock, but its about having cash on hand.<br />The adjective &#8220;liquid&#8221; now refers to the entity not the asset or the market.  An entity is liquid if it can cover its current liabilities.  The alternatives are liquid and &#8220;out of cash right now.&#8221;</p>
<p>To be illiquid but not insolvent one must have illiquid assets.  Typically these assets are things that can&#8217;t be bought and sold (&#8220;good will&#8221; and/or &#8220;wishful thinking&#8221;) or highly complicated assets which the firm with a cash flow problem swears are valuable but no one else has a clue.</p>
<p>I hope the final definition of liquidity is as the first name of mr liquidity constrained.  An entity is liquidity constrained if it wants to borrow and no one wants to lend to it.</p>
<p>Now it is useful to understand &#8220;liquidity&#8221; these days because it has a lot to do with the financial crisis.  For one thing, many people say the crisis is a liquidity crisis, that is, they say either that</p>
<p>a) the problem is that people have stopped buying and selling assets making them illiquid.  This creates problems for firms which were planning to sell such assets in order to pay liabilities.  For some reason all huge banks were planning to do that around now.</p>
<p>b) the problem is that assets have become illiquid *and* fear causes many market participants to want to liquidate them.  The combinantion of a desire to sell and low liquidity implies a low price (according to def. 4 and especially 3).  </p>
<p>c)  Banks have to mark assets to market and satisfy prudential regulations.  They have lost money so they have less capital (assets minus debt).  Thus they have to liquidate assets and repay debt.  Therefore they have to sell assets, but, those assets have become illiquid so they are in trouble.</p>
<p>d) Banks have a cash flow problem.  They will be fine really.  They just need a loan.</p>
<p>e) Banks are liquidity constrained.  No one but the US Treasury is stupid enough to lend them money.</p>
<p>Now it is clear that if the problems were d or e, we would like more liquidity.</p>
<p>If the problems are a through c, maybe the problem is that assets which should never have been liquid were liquid.  The argument that definition 3 liquidity (high trading volume) is definitely good, assumes that leveraged positions fall out of the sky.  It is only the fact that traders knew they could unwind their positions (liquidate their assets and cover their short positions) that made traders willing to hold such huge long positions.  However, they can&#8217;t all liquidate their position.</p>
<p>Liquidity is very dangerous if everyone thinks that he is smarter than everyone else.  If all traders think that they will be the first to sell when the bubble bursts, they can destroy the financial system (look what they did).</p>
<p>Definition 3 liquidity is definitely good so long as everyone is rational.  It is also impossible if everyone is rational (as far as market micro structure theorists can understand).</p>
<p>The argument that high trading volume must be good is a case of Schizzo finance.  It is assumed that markets are efficient and all traders are rational.  Therefore something which makes it possible for them to trade in some way must be good at least for them.  It is also assumed that the optimal trading strategy isn&#8217;t to buy and hold the market.  That basically requires the assumption that someone is irrational and markets are inefficient.</p>
<p>I think the logic of the financial sector has long been &#8220;We&#8217;re smart and there are plenty of dumb investors out there.  The rules should be designed to make it easy for us to separate them from their money.&#8221;  That is not  a pleasant attitude, but, to our great misfortune, they were wrong.  They managed to lose huge amounts of money making important institutions at least illiquid and probably insolvent.</p>
<p>Oh and don&#8217;t tell me that the many definitions of liquidity don&#8217;t have anything to do with a sector which makes money by confusing people and wants to make sure legislators don&#8217;t understand that this is their business plan.</p>
