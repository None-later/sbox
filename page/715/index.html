<p>This seems an opportune time for Angrybears to gird up their loins financially.  For those who have not already succumbed to the lures of the “greater fool” theory of housing markets, please be aware that in declining economies the clever may turn to other schemes to part you from your cash.  Ponzi operators such as hedge funds, private equity funds, Nigerian con artists with “special opportunites” and other wickedly complex characters will importune you to “invest” for quick returns.  Pyramid scheme operators will urge you to “invest in yourself and your future” with the promise of riches and income streams in perpetuity by recruiting friends and neighbors to buy and sell inventories of overpriced crap.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponzi_scheme">Wikipedia’s definition of a Ponzi scheme and a pyramid scheme</a> distinguish them from financial “bubbles” thusly:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8211; A pyramid scheme is a form of fraud similar in some ways to a Ponzi scheme, relying as it does on a disbelief in financial reality, including the hope of an extremely high rate of return. However, several characteristics distinguish pyramid schemes from Ponzi schemes:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8211; In a Ponzi scheme, the schemer acts as a “hub” for the victims, interacting with all of them directly. In a pyramid scheme, those who recruit additional participants benefit directly (in fact, failure to recruit typically means no investment return).</p>
<p>&#8211; A Ponzi scheme claims to rely on some esoteric investment approach, insider connections, etc., and often attracts well-to-do investors; pyramid schemes explicitly claim that new money will be the source of payout for the initial investments.</p>
<p>&#8211; A pyramid scheme is bound to collapse a lot faster, simply because of the demand for exponential increases in participants to sustain it. By contrast, Ponzi schemes can survive simply by getting most participants to &#8220;reinvest&#8221; their money, with a relatively small number of new participants.</p>
<p>&#8211; A bubble. A bubble relies on suspension of belief and an expectation of large profits, but it is not the same as a Ponzi scheme. A bubble involves ever-rising (and unsustainable) prices in an open market (be that shares of a stock, housing prices, the price of tulip bulbs, or anything else). As long as buyers are willing to pay ever-increasing prices, sellers can get out with a profit. And there doesn&#8217;t need to be a schemer behind a bubble. (In fact, a bubble can arise without any fraud at all &#8211; for example, housing prices in a local market that rise sharply but eventually drop sharply because of overbuilding.) Bubbles are often said to be based on &#8220;greater fool&#8221; theory.</p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Armed with this knowledge and alert to these potential pitfalls, I would only add that the operators of such schemes have identifiable <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/%E2%80%9D" http:>personality characteristics.</a>  From investigator Bill Branscum we learn:</p>
<blockquote><p>His system makes it possible for him to pay incredible rates of return. The elaborate office, exquisitely tailored suits, involvement with the church, and generosity toward charitable organizations are all classic window dressing.  . . Ponzi or Pyramid &#8211; either way, the con artists who perpetrate these scams are swindlers with sociopathic personalities who view everyone around them as bit part players in their own personal play. These people are devious beyond comprehension. Uninhibited by anything akin to conscience or remorse, they have no mercy and feel nobody&#8217;s pain.   Charm and charisma can conceal a lot. It is hard to imagine that one of the most likeable people you ever met in your life, totally trusted by those you respect and admire, would destroy everything you worked your entire life to build while looking you in the eye and smiling in your face all the while.</p></blockquote>
<p>Oh my!!  Is there any way to protect yourself from these smooth operators?  Yes.  Become a <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/">psychopath</a>.  That’s your best shot, according to a study.</p>
<blockquote><p>Wanted: psychopaths to play the stock market.  The US team found that people with certain brain injuries which suppress their emotions could make the best stock market traders. They took a selection of 41 people of normal IQ, 15 of whom had suffered lesions on the areas of the brain that affect emotions, and made them play a simple investment game.  Those with brain damage significantly out performed those without, the researchers from Stanford Graduate School of Business, Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Iowa found.</p></blockquote>
<p>Good luck, suckers.  ☺ OldVet  (and with advance apologies to the eponymously named fellow Angrybear, ECP, Jr.)</p>

                                <p><a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/01/economy.html">Cactus</a> lets us know that the BEA is saying real GDP growth for the past year has been anemic.  But what about the last seven years as a whole?  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/28/washington/28bush.html?hp">Sheryl Gay Stolberg</a> recently played Steno Sue with this GOP spin:</p>
<blockquote><p>Mr. Bush has spent years presiding over an economic climate of growth that would be the envy of most presidents. Yet much to the consternation of his political advisers, he has had trouble getting credit for it, in large part because Americans were consumed by the war in Iraq.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let’s see – real GDP as of 2007QIV was only 18.1% more than it was as of 2000QIV, which translates into an average annual growth rate of only 2.4%.  As <a href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/beat_the_press_archive?month=01&#038;year=2008&#038;base_name=why_would_presidents_envy_bad">Dean Baker</a> notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Here the ranking of the presidential terms since 1960 by average annual GDP growth:</p>
<p>Kennedy-Johnson &#8212; 5.2%<br />Clinton &#8212; 3.6%<br />Reagan &#8212; 3.4%<br />Carter &#8212; 3.4%<br />Nixon-Ford &#8212; 2.7%<br />Bush II &#8211;2.6%<br />Bush I &#8211;1.9%</p>
<p>President Bush&#8217;s growth record is better than his father&#8217;s, but it is worse than the record of every other president in the last half century. It&#8217;s not clear why they would be envious. It is also not clear what his political advisers have to complain about.</p></blockquote>
<p>While the cheerleaders of Bush II often tout his record as one of tremendous economic growth, the facts indicate otherwise.  And when presented with such facts, the cheerleaders usually find some way to blame Clinton.</p>

<blockquote><p>The economy nearly stalled in the fourth quarter with a growth rate of just 0.6 percent, capping its worst year since 2002.</p>
<p>The Commerce Department&#8217;s report on the gross domestic product, released Wednesday, showed an economy that had deteriorated considerably during the October-to-December quarter as worsening problems in the housing market and harder-to-get credit made individuals and businesses more cautious in their spending. Fears of a recession have grown, even as inflation remained elevated.</p>
<p>For all of 2007, the economy grew by just 2.2 percent, the weakest performance in five years, when the country was struggling to recover from the 2001 recession. The housing collapse dealt the economy its biggest blow last year. Builders slashed spending on housing projects by 16.9 percent on an annualized basis, the most in 25 years.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, not surprising to those of us who have been paying attention.  Some of us were noting at the time that the economy was slowing and that the economy might slide into a recession some time this year.</p>
<p>Then there were some people who were <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=NzEyOTljNTVmYTM3YTVjMjg3YjdkODhhMTdlODcyYWQ=">looking backward</a> and concluding things were just peachy.</p>

I suggest that those who skim the surface of statistics about who pays not assume their point is made and a moral laid on the table by simply quoting 1% pays X.</p>
<blockquote><p>Age: While the zero-tax tax filers tend to be young, two-thirds (or 8.8 million) of the non-filers are older than age 55. By contrast, only 10.7 percent of the larger population of zero-tax filers are older than age 55. As Table 2 shows, when zero-tax filers and non-filers are combined, more than half of all households that will pay no income taxes are either younger than age 25 or older than age 55.<br />&#8230;<br />This year, a record 44 million tax returns – one-third of all returns filed – will have no income tax liability because of the available credits and deductions in the tax code. This is a 50 percent increase in the number of zero-tax filers in just four years. In addition to these zero-tax filers is 14 million individuals or households who do not earn enough to file a tax return. Overall, some 58 million taxable households are outside of the income tax system.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Today, generic drugs account for 63% of all U.S. prescriptions for drugs (see Figure 1). Since generic drugs sell at substantially lower prices than their brand-name counterparts, they save consumers and purchasers of prescription drugs tens of billions of dollars per year. Moreover, their expanded role has been linked to an attenuation of overall price increases for prescription drugs. Between 2007 and 2010, roughly 110 drugs will lose their patent protection — including well-known products such as Norvasc (amlodipine), Imitrex (sumatriptan), Fosamax (alendronate), and Risperdal (risperidone). Estimates suggest that these 110 drugs are currently responsible for $50 billion a year in sales — so competition from generic drugs could generate large additional savings.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.fda.gov/cder/orange/obreadme.htm">The FDA Orange Book</a> has a listing of brands and generics.</p>
<p><a href="http://counsellingresource.com/medications/discount-drugs/generics.html">This website</a> carries a lot of good information.</p>
<blockquote><p>However, it should be noted that current <a oncontextmenu="return false;" href="http://counsellingresource.com/medications/discount-drugs/generics.html#" target="_new">regulations</a> permit a variation of approximately 20% either way in the bioavailability of the active ingredient. (The specifics of the permitted variation in bioavailability hinge on the FDA&#8217;s technical definition of bioequivalence, which requires that there be no statistically significant difference in bioavailability. For the FDA&#8217;s definition, see the agency&#8217;s <a href="http://www.fda.gov/cder/guidance/5356fnl.pdf">Guidance for Industry</a> document, which sets out guidance on confidence intervals for test to reference comparisons across different types of medications, as well as the FDA&#8217;s <a href="http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/waisidx_00/21cfr320_00.html">Code of Federal Regulations 320</a> document on bioavailability and bioequivalence requirements. Also see this 1999 <a href="http://www.fdli.org/" rel="external" gozrp="0" mny3a="0">Food and Drug Law Institute</a> overview of the <a href="http://www.fdli.org/pubs/Journal%20Online/54_2/art2.pdf" gozrp="0" mny3a="0">Hatch-Waxman Act of 1984</a>.) In one study (<a href="http://counsellingresource.com/bibliography/index.html#Borgheini_2003" gozrp="0" mny3a="0">Borgheini 2003</a>), a full 31% variation was found in the blood plasma levels of a particular medication after a patient switched from a branded to a generic product. (Why does this happen? It may be accounted for by differences in the manufacturing process yielding different particle sizes that are absorbed at different rates, as well as other factors.)<br />&#8230;<br />This does NOT necessarily mean that purchasing generic medications in preference to branded counterparts is a bad idea &#8212; in fact, in most cases it is probably still a very good idea! &#8212; but this does mean that the issue is not quite as clear cut as it might otherwise seem as a medical issue, if not price for the end user.</p></blockquote>
<p>The FDA describes it stats creation thusly:</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.fda.gov/cder/ob/docs/preface/ecpreface.htm#Therapeutic%20Equivalence-Related%20Terms">The statistical methodology</a> for analyzing these bioequivalence studies is called the two one-sided test procedure. Two situations are tested with this statistical methodology. The first of the two one-sided tests determines whether a generic product (test), when substituted for a brand-name product (reference) is significantly less bioavailable. The second of the two one-sided tests determines whether a brand-name product when substituted for a generic product is significantly less bioavailable. Based on the opinions of FDA medical experts, a difference of greater than 20% for each of the above tests was determined to be significant, and therefore, undesirable for all drug products. Numerically, this is expressed as a limit of test-product average/reference-product average of 80% for the first statistical test and a limit of reference-product average/test-product average of 80% for the second statistical test. By convention, all data is expressed as a ratio of the average response (AUC and Cmax) for test/reference, so the limit expressed in the second statistical test is 125% (reciprocal of 80%).</p>
<p>For statistical reasons, all data is log-transformed prior to conducting statistical testing. In practice, these statistical tests are carried out using an analysis of variance procedure (ANOVA) and calculating a 90% confidence interval for each pharmacokinetic parameter (Cmax and AUC). The confidence interval for both pharmacokinetic parameters, AUC and Cmax, must be entirely within the 80% to 125% boundaries cited above. Because the mean of the study data lies in the center of the 90% confidence interval, the mean of the data is usually close to 100% (a test/reference ratio of 1). Different statistical criteria are sometimes used when bioequivalence is demonstrated through comparative clinical trials pharmacodynamic studies, or comparative in-vitro methodology.</p></blockquote>
<p>Generic drug manufacturing is the predominate method of saving money in the market for pharmaceutical drugs. As the market changes we have to consider trends.</p>
<p>1. Many insurance companies mandate the use of the generic form of a drug, with the user picking up the cost of using a brand name. Hence it appears to be a quick remedy and will continue to be a force in this market.</p>
<p>2. When manufactured in the US, quality control was excellent. Any run in production that did not meet specs was sold overseas. That did not mean it was a bad run necessarily, but did not meet specs. I do not know what was done with product that simply was medically sub-par.</p>
<p>3. Currently there are few drugs manufactured in the US anymore, generic or brand name. There are more than a couple dozen countries that have manufacturing facilities in their jurisdiction.</p>
<p>4. For different reasons sometimes generic drugs are not the equivalent to the brand name for a patient. In MA generic drugs are mandatory unless specifically requested by the doctor, and in MA have tripled in co-pay from Dec 2007, and will continue to rise.</p>
<p>The FDA has turned to hiring private inspectors that are certified by them in the country of origin to inspect manufacturing plants. The same is true for medical devises, where few are made in the US.</p>

                                <p>OldVet&#8217;s <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/01/oldvet-jingle-mail-revisited.html">post</a> yesterday notes that borrowers and lenders used to know each other personally.  However, over time, the lenders have shifted from the local banker to big impersonal multinationals that are less likely to have a personal relationship with the borrowers, and make their business decisions accordingly.  Not surprisingly, borrowers are starting to make decisions on the same basis.</p>
<p>This repeats a phenomenon we&#8217;ve seen elsewhere in the economy &#8211; businesses started treating employees as replaceable commodities, firing at will, and then, surprise, surprise, some years later, discovered that employees no longer had much loyalty to them either.  And I wonder what this means in the long run.  In the short run, when businesses first begin to treat their customers or borrowers or employees as opponents, they had an advantage over their customers or borrowers or employees and even their other competitors who hadn&#8217;t yet begun acting in the same way. </p>
<p>This is because their customers or borrowers or employees didn&#8217;t expect them to be acting in this way, and continued treating them as if the old paradigm, the &#8220;we&#8217;re all in this together&#8221; approach, still applied.  When one side plays dirty and the other doesn&#8217;t even realize the other side is playing dirty, the side that plays dirty wins.  In economic parlance, the dirty side extracts the other side&#8217;s surplus.  We see that in the shift in the distribution of income from Joe Sixpack to the corporate profits over the past few decades.</p>
<p>But what happens when the other side starts playing the same way?  Well, the big guys still have some advantage over the little guys, but there are enough big guys that they can be made to dance sometimes too.  The ability to extract some surplus from the customers or borrowers or employees starts to go away as they begin to treat the big guys the same way the big guys treat them &#8211; as opponents to be taken advantage of if the opportunity presents itself.  And maybe you start to see a slow shift back to a distribution of income similar to the one of days past.  Not all the way back &#8211; the big guys have too many advantages for that, but there are a lot of pissed off little people.</p>
<p>But there is another change that we can expect in this world of &#8220;capitalism&#8221; big business has created, and its not a good one for anyone.  That change is the shrinking of the proverbial pie.  See, when two sides know and trust each other, it isn&#8217;t necessary to waste resources preparing for all the galaxy of contingencies made up of all the possible ways each side can be screwed by the other.   And there many such ways, from pushing for changes in the law (think bankruptcy reform) to outright fraud.  </p>
<p>The big boys &#8211; the big banks and the big corporations &#8211; have demonstrated over and over that the individuals with whom they deal, be they customers or borrowers or employees, are nothing more than numbers, unworthy of compassion or loyalty or justice if it interferes in any way with profit.  And over time, the customers and borrowers have started reciprocating.   The cooperation between the two sides that used to exist, the cooperation between the two sides that used to create value &#8211; is dying.  And we will all be poorer as a result.</p>

<p>”Jingle Mail Revisited: it’s happening.”</p>
<p>I ran across an <a href="http://globaleconomicanalysis.blogspot.com/2008/01/business-of-walking-away.html">article</a>  today that gave me pause.  It was on the subject of housing and homeowners going into foreclosure.  I noticed it because it jarred with how I’d always seen my obligations to pay debts that I’d incurred, no matter what.  I had watched the “60 Minutes” the night before, which was cited in the article.  A key part in the television piece was between a reporter named Kroft and a real estate agent named Moran.  It’s followed by a comment by Mr. Shedlock:</p>
<p>Kroft observes to real estate agent Kevin Moran. &#8220;There was a time, I think, when people felt really bad about not paying off a debt.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah, I think in those days, loans were made by your local banker or building and loan associations or savings and loan,&#8221; Moran replies. &#8220;They were guys you saw in the grocery store. They were on the little league team with you, the PTA, the school. And I think as mortgages became securitized and Wall Street became involved, they became very transactional and there was no relationship built with the borrower and the lender. And I think that makes it easier for someone to see it as an anonymous party at the other end of the transaction and just walk away from it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just a business decision,&#8221; Kroft says.</p>
<p>Shedlock’s response:  </p>
<blockquote><p>Implicit in this segment is that families are not entitled to make &#8220;business decisions.&#8221; But you know who is entitled? Why, businesses of course. When businesses laid off 1.5 million workers in 2007, it was purely a &#8220;business decision.&#8221; When Wall Street banks &#8220;wrote down&#8221; more than $100 billion in losses in 2007, it was purely a &#8220;business decision.&#8221;  Look for families to become more comfortable making &#8220;business decisions&#8221; of their own in 2008.</p></blockquote>
<p>Bruised nostalgic attitudes aside, I can also note the complete disregard with which banks treat borrowers in good times, and the business environment in modern America which treats workers like disposable dishrags.  The social bonds which tied businesses to communities are customers to bankers and people to their contracts are fraying rapidly.  Hard times and desperation bring dormant conflicts into sharp relief.  And if a business can call what it does a “business decision” then why cannot a flesh and blood American do the same?</p>

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>

                                <p>The foreclosure crisis for some cities like Cleveland is a tsunami of 16,000 homes. Some communities have a foreclosed house or two on every block. There a lot of links to other cities as well if you google.</p>
<p>What I see that has not been discussed is what happens when the problem becomes large enough to tip some sort of balance in an area, and what happens to normal procedures and ownership rules in such situations. No one here has mentioned what other costs get pushed onto the public sector that private markets will probably avoid as best they can.</p>
<p>1.Such costs are the extra costs of police and fire protections for the property.<br />2.Upkeep of the property is abandoned by the borrower, and then if the house either becomes unprofitable due to damage/repair considerations or simple loss of value, the bank abandons the property as a write-off. (In some areas the plumbing is stripped out for copper, along with windows etc and resold in extraordinary times)<br />3. Taxes cannot be collected either way&#8230;liens are less effective for such a house for anyone, bank or city.<br />4. The act of forclosure is stalled because actual owners of the mortgage can be hard to determine. (12 months in some places)<br />5. The impact of having an abandoned house on the block that is not protected or kept up lowers the value of all the other houses nearby as well and lowers the tax rate collections eventually.<br />6. Demolition is paid by the city.</p>
<p>When such issues hit a city, who bails them out. City pockets often are less deep than some of the big guys.</p>
<p>Hence, Cleveland has some credibility when it questions what ownership actually is for a house. The borrower has the title, but the mortgage holder has power to evict. This is also a &#8216;controlling interest&#8217; and as a &#8216;right of control&#8217; that defines ownership for a borrower may be applied to the mortgage holder given enough pain. While unlikely to win, when does it become big enough to need a change in law?</p>
<p>You do not own the house until the mortgage is paid. You have &#8216;rights of use&#8217;. Under extraordinary circumstances, who does own the house?</p>
<p>Update: <a href="http://rawstory.com/news/afp/US_home_foreclosures_surge_01292008.html">Foreclosure proceedings jump and new house sales plummet</a>.</p>
<p>Update 2: <a href="http://www.blogger.com/%3Ca">Calculated Risk&#8217;s Tanta</a> writes a defining post on the ins and outs of &#8216;walking away&#8217; from a loan.</p>

<blockquote><p>OODA Loop Theory [OODA is an acronym that stands for a rapid, repeated cycle of Orient, Observe, Decide, Act.]</p>
<p>Go and read about the OODA Loop, and come to understand how he applied it to high-speed aerial combat, and then how he applied it to ground combat (his work was embraced by the US Marine Corps), and then how he briefed the Secretary of Defense on his theory just before Desert Storm, and how that theory was successfully applied to the initial knock-out punch thrown at Saddam in Kuwait.</p>
<p>And when you come to a higher understanding about the OODA Loop, and how it uses information gleaned from the opponent and the environment and thrust into the decision-making loop rapidly so that you may stay one step ahead of your opponent, then I want you to remember that Dick Cheney was briefed on it.</p>
<p>And then I want you to ponder, for a minute, the use of Total Information Awareness campaigns, data-mining, and various intelligence-gathering methods available to the US government; these are the sources for information that are pumped into the complex loop.</p>
<p>And then I want you to remember that Cheney was briefed&#8230;</p>
<p>And then I want you to consider how this OODA loop has likely been used for domestic political purposes&#8230;.</p>
<p>And then I want you to consider, given the explosive theories suggested by Ruppert and Singh relative to the war games, and the use of very sophisticated software (PROMIS and PTECH), how the OODA loop may have played a role on 9/11.</p>
<p>I went out this weekend and bought the biography of Boyd (Boyd: The Fighter Pilot Who Changed The Art of War, Robert Coram, Back Bay Books/Little, Brown &#038; Co., 2002, ISBN 0-316-79688-3). I&#8217;d read it previously and have dozens of articles in my PC related to it. </p>
<p>&#8230;.</p>
<p>The OODA loop appears to be a relatively simple cycle. However, given the multiple feedback loops, it is actually very complex. The best practitioner learns to simplify it and apply it instinctively and intuitively&#8230;literally, to fly by the seat of their pants&#8230;</p>
<p>From Boyd: The Fighter Pilot Who Changed the Art of War, Robert Coram, Back Bay Books, Little Brown &#038; Co., Boston 2002, p. 335-6:</p>
<p>“Understanding the OODA Loop is difficult. First, even though it is called a “loop”, it is not. A drawing of the Loop shows thirty arrows connecting the various ingredients, which means hundreds of possible “loops” can be derived….Even Boyd’s Acolytes do not always agree with what Boyd meant by the OODA Loop… The OODA Loop briefing contains 185 slides. “</p>
<p>The OODA loop is based on Boyd’s earlier thesis entitled “Destruction and Creation”, which links Godel’s Proof, Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle, and the second law of thermodynamics.</p>
<p>“…Boyd spent four years researching and writing and then distilling his [thesis] down to eleven pages; the result has the specific gravity approaching that of uranium. It is thick and heavy and ponderous, filled with caveats and qualifiers and arcane references that span theories never before connected. To read [it] is to fully appreciate the term “heavy sledding”. [Page 323]<br />&#8212;<br />You can download the pdf of Boyd’s “Destruction &#038; Creation”<br /><a href="here:/">here</a>.<br />&#8212;<br />An important part of the thesis is an elaboration on the idea that a relationship exists between the observer and what is being observed. This idea is not original, but the author presents a new explanation of how we perceive physical reality. Several people can look at the same process or same event and each might see it in an entirely different fashion. A crowd streaming into a college football stadium is seen in significantly different ways by a fraternity member, a TV cameraman, the beer distributor, the security officer, and the college president. Furthermore, each process of observation changes what is being observed. The people in the football stadium, knowing that they are being recorded by a TV camera, might wave or shout or begin a spontaneous demonstration. The same crowd, knowing that security officers are monitoring them, might become subdued, or perhaps confrontational. If we are aware of the changes that take place during a dynamic interaction, we can and must reassess and recalculate our own relationship with that which we are observing; the process not only shapes what is being observed, but feedback reshapes the observer&#8217;s outlook. The TV cameraman searches out people who are not waving. Security officers become more vigilant because they know people in the crowd are disguising their behavior. A cycle begins, and it is repeated over and over again.<br />&#8212;<br />The OODA loop is used to create “the fog of war”.<br />&#8212;<br />“The act of observation is, of course, filtered. We usually see what we expect to see, not what is actually taking place. And what we do manage to observe is colored or tinted by our past experience. Once we actually observe something, our brain attempts to orient itself to the new information. Does it match our past experience, or our cultural background, or our genetic make-up? If not, is it powerful enough to significantly change our view of the world? One way or another, it becomes part of our new reality.”<br />Source: <a href="http://isobe.typepad.com/sketchpad/">ISOBE</a></p>
<p>And our past experience, in a media-driven world, is colored by the images, stories, headlines, pronouncements and “leaks” given to us repetitively and programmatically.</p>
<p>Suggestion is a powerful tool. Keep that in mind when you listen to a car salesman.</p>

<p>He could shoot anyone down in simulated aerial combat simulations, an had done so for real as well. If this is the model, plus cell structure in departments of government, much can be accomplished. A bureaucracy operates in a very different way. And the good or bad intentions one expects from normal people has little room in this scheme.</p>
