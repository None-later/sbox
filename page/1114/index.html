<p>UPDATE: A quick check of <a href="http://www.sbgi.net/about/directors.shtml">Sinclair&#8217;s board</a> reveals 4 inside and 4 outside directors, with the insiders including the CEO  David &#8220;<a href="http://atrios.blogspot.com/2004/10/sinclair.html">Solicitation Arrest</a>&#8221; Smith. So this board seems unlikely to overturn Smith&#8217;s decision, and there&#8217;s not really time for (or likelihood of) any shareholder action. However, a large institutional investor could raise a stink. <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2004/10/9/20260/9513">Apparently</a>, <a href="http://www.troweprice.com/corporate/0,,,00.html">T.

                                <p>The transcript of Wolf’s interview with the Treasury Secretary can be found <a href="http://www.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0410/10/le.01.html">here</a>.  After Wolf noted the fall in employment per the Payroll Survey, Snow first makes excuses and then offers:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you look at, Wolf, and this is important to make &#8211; a point to make. If you look at the broader survey of work, the most inclusive survey of jobs in America, the household survey, we&#8217;ve picked up 3.2 million jobs since the president took office. Now, that&#8217;s the survey that&#8217;s used to put &#8212; to make the estimate on unemployment. It&#8217;s the survey that includes all jobs. It&#8217;s the survey that is more reliable in dealing with new businesses being established and with the self-employed… American standard of living is higher today than it&#8217;s ever been. More Americans own their own homes than ever before. Real disposable income is the highest in the history of the country. Looking at the household survey, more Americans are working than ever before.</p></blockquote>
<p>Wolf turns to the deficit and Snow offers:</p>
<blockquote><p>Well, Wolf, let me say on that, first of all, the president wasn&#8217;t handed a huge surplus…Deficits matter. Current deficits are too large. The president is committed to bringing the deficit down, and we will. We will bring it down to a level that&#8217;s only half of what it was when the president made the commitment here a year ago…The deficit now is lower by about $100 billion than it was estimated to be a year ago. That&#8217;s because, with the tax cuts, the economy is growing and expanding at a much faster rate.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, at least he did not claim that deficits do not matter.  Gene Sperling was on later and said:</p>
<blockquote><p>And, Wolf, I&#8217;ve got to respond to one thing Secretary Snow said, because sometimes there&#8217;s something that&#8217;s just wrong. He said we didn&#8217;t know about &#8212; we didn&#8217;t inherit a $6.5 trillion surplus. I encourage viewers to go check this. In February of 2001, the Bush administration put out their numbers when they were in charge. And you know what they said the surplus was going to be over next 10 years? $5.6 trillion. So he&#8217;s wrong about that. That was their projection. And now we&#8217;ve had almost a $10 trillion deterioration, the worse deterioration in history, under President Bush&#8217;s watch.</p></blockquote>
<p>Another reason to elect John Kerry as President: so we can have a Treasury Secretary that tells the truth.<br /></p>

                                <p>Bush apologists used to note that the current unemployment rate is near the average during the Clinton years, which forgets that unemployment fell during Clinton’s Administration and has increased under the current Administration.  Now they are comparing to the current 5.4% unemployment rate to the average rate since 1948, which has been 5.6%.  This comparison is misleading for three reasons.  One is that the average unemployment rate may overstate the natural rate especially during a time frame with nine recessions.  The second reason is that the natural rate changes over time. Page 92 of the <em>Economic Report of the President 2000 </em><a href="http://www.gpoaccess.gov/usbudget/fy01/pdf/2000_erp.pdf">notes</a>::</p>
<blockquote><p>The short-term NAIRU, which has been centered around 5¾ percent over the postwar period and in the mid-1990s, probably fell into the 4 to 4½ percent range through the combination of the temporary help and Internet innovations to the labor market, the productivity surprise, falling relative import prices, and perhaps other factors. It is very difficult to quantify the long-term effects of the temporary help and Internet innovations to the labor market. For the purpose of its conservative forecast, the Administration estimates that they account for roughly a 0.5-percentage-point permanent reduction in the NAIRU from its historical average, to a range centered around 5.2 percent. In contrast, the effects of the productivity surprise and falling relative import prices are temporary and are expected to erode over the next several years. As a consequence, in the Administration’s conservative projection, the unemployment rate edges up to 5.2 percent by 2003 and remains at that level thereafter.</p></blockquote>
<p>Given the continuing productivity increases, the natural rate may still be less than 5%.  </p>
<p>The third reason has to do with the decline in civilian force labor participation rate from 67% to 66% during the jobless recovery.  When I argued that the employment-population ratio is a better measure of the state of the labor market, Brad DeLong <a href="http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/movable_type/2004-2_archives/000126.html">argued</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Taking 64% as the natural employment-to-population ratio-and thus as a goal for macroeconomic policy-seems to me to make sense. The failure of inflation to pick up faster after mid-1997 is a powerful argument that the natural employment-to-population ratio is not less than 64%.  And the calculation that we have 3.5 million people out of jobs who ought-in a well-performing economy-be working seems a good estimate to me.</p></blockquote>
<p>If the natural employment-to-population ratio is 64%, then the actual employment-to-population ratio currently at 62.3% is far below the natural rate.  </p>
<p>In the upcoming Presidential debate, let’s listen to both candidates.  I suspect Bush will tout his pseudo-optimism that all is just fine since he has no genuine plans for restoring full employment.  Kerry will likely portray the real optimism that we can do better.  I’m sure most Americans will be listening for him to say what policy steps he intends to implement to insure that we do.<br /></p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Kevin Drum wrote a post about Bush&#8217;s statement during the debate that he has <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2004_10/004884.php">restrained spending growth</a>.  As Kevin points out, his statement turns up into down and black into white.</p>
<p>However, Bush didn&#8217;t pull his figures out of thin air.  The exact phrasing of his statement was &#8220;Non-homeland, non-defense discretionary spending was raising [sic] at 15 percent a year when I got into office.  And today it&#8217;s less than 1 percent, because we&#8217;re working together to try to bring this deficit under control.&#8221;  The data supporting his statement is contained in <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budgetcharts/pdf/SecurityRestraint.pdf">this OMB graph</a>.  According to the graph, Bush&#8217;s statement was (almost) correct.</p>
<p>What explains the difference between the OMB graph and Kevin Drum&#8217;s figures?  Part of the answer is the difference between budget authority and budget outlays (spending).  As <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&#038;node=&#038;contentId=A30791-2003Dec25&#038;notFound=true">this Washington Post piece</a> describes, the Bush administration has been able to use that difference to their advantage:</p>
<blockquote><p>[Critics] say [that] Republicans in Washington &#8212; anxious about the unhappiness of their conservative supporters &#8212; are manipulating the authorizing numbers, making them all but irrelevant. Authorized spending rose 15.3 percent in 2003 in large part because of a $79 billion emergency &#8220;supplemental&#8221; spending bill passed shortly after the invasion of Iraq, Riedl said. But only half of that money was spent last year, allowing Congress to rein in authorized spending levels this year. </p>
<p>&#8220;It was probably unnecessary to go that high in 2003 budget authority,&#8221; Riedl said, &#8220;but the White House understands that if they threw a lot into the supplemental, they would relieve pressure on their 2004 budget.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The following table illustrates.  The White House and Congress have indeed increased the budget authority for non-defense, non-homeland security (NDNHS) discretionary spending at a decreasing rate.  But actual spending (the table only shows discretionary spending) has continued to grow rapidly.  </p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/bush_spending.jpg"><br />Source: <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2005/05msr.pdf"><em>FY 2005 Mid-Session Review of the US Budget</em></a>, tables 8 and 14.</p>
<p>How is that possible?  I don&#8217;t know the details of where the extra money is coming from, but whenever spending is greater than outlays it is likely that the money was authorized in earlier years but hadn&#8217;t previously been spent.  As the table shows, the gap between spending authorized by Congress and the actual spending done by the Bush administration has grown steadily in recent years.  Thus while spending has grown far faster than Bush suggested the other night, authorization has indeed grown at a slow rate in recent years.  There may well be budgetary implications of this growing authorization-spending gap, but I will leave that as a topic for future research and discussion.</p>
<p>Note that even accounting for this difference between authorization and spending, it remains somewhat unclear where Bush&#8217;s budget office came up with the totals for NDNHS authorizations that they use.  Tad DeHaven of the Cato Institute wrote a piece about this subject in the <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/script/printpage.asp?ref=/nrof_comment/dehaven200312190904.asp"><em>National Review</em>.</a>  Try as he might, he wasn&#8217;t able to replicate the Bush administration&#8217;s numbers.</p>
<p>However, it does seem that much of the discrepancy between the well-documented growth in government under the Bush administration and Bush&#8217;s assertion that he has been slowing the rate of growth in government is probably accounted for by the distinction between budget authority and spending.  Of course, that&#8217;s a distinction that is not clear to most people, including Bush himself &#8212; he claimed that he had held down spending, not authorization.  So even by his own budget figures his statement was not quite right.  </p>
<p>But more fundamentally, the real comparison should look at what Bush has done over his entire term, not just what he proposed for 2005.  And by that measure, the growth in government spending by Bush has been extremely high no matter how you look at it.</p>

                                <p>Was it just me, or did Bush come across as pretty angry and defensive?  A couple of times, it seemed to me that he was so agressive with his answers that he was almost yelling at the poor person asking the question.  Did anyone else have that impression?</p>
<p>However, while Kerry was speaking Bush did manage to contain his scowls and grimaces (though he chuckled sarcastically a couple of times).  Instead, his face looked as if it had received a recent botox treatment.  Bush did, however, manage to carry over his whiny tone of voice from the first debate.</p>
<p>As far as determining the winner goes, this bit from <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5445086/">MSNBC&#8217;s blog</a> has my favorite analysis:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Scorer&#8217;s Table, having taken two hours to let the Blogosphere complete its due diligence (and to permit the scorer to retreat to a corner of the room, don cold compresses, and moan quietly), can now quote the truth from &#8220;Factcheck.Org&#8221;: &#8220;President Bush himself would have qualified as a &#8216;small business owner&#8217; under the Republican definition, based on his 2001 federal income tax returns. He reported $84 of business income from his part ownership of a timber-growing enterprise.&#8221; Brooks Jackson&#8217;s marvelous site noted that the timber interest was listed under &#8220;royalties&#8221; in his 2002 and 2003 returns, indicating The Texas Thunderbolt still has an interest in said concern.</p>
<p>The point awarded to Mr. Bush in the thirteenth round is hereby withdrawn and awarded to Mr. Kerry, for the latter&#8217;s enterprising hoisting of his opponent on said opponent&#8217;s own petard.</p>
<p>Mr. Bush is also penalized three points for a truth foul.<br />
<br />Mr. Bush is further penalized two points for getting snarky while in the act of being factually incorrect.</p>
<p>The thirteenth round, originally scored 2-0 for Mr. Bush, now reverts to a 1-1 draw, and the rounds awarded total now changes from 12 Kerry, 4 Bush, 3 Drawn, to 12 Kerry, 3 Bush, 4 Drawn.</p>
<p>The final points scoring is now adjusted from Kerry 15, Bush 12, to Kerry 16, Bush 6.  The Scorer thus designates the outcome as a Kerry victory outside the margin for statistical error. </p>
<p>The scorer&#8217;s table reproaches President Bush for not knowing when he has wood.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>With today&#8217;s new employment numbers we can now take a fairly complete look at the overall performance of the economy during Bush&#8217;s entire term in office.  This is a stretch of nearly four years, which (as I mentioned in <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2004/10/summarizing-bushs-job-creation-record.html">my earlier post</a>) is probably a long enough period of time to allow the economic policies set by the president to actually impact the economy.  Greg Mankiw, chair of Bush&#8217;s CEA, agrees.  From this year&#8217;s <em>Economic Report of the President</em> (p. 101): &#8220;The Administration&#8217;s policies have been a key force shaping recent economic developments.&#8221;</p>
<p>Note that I won&#8217;t even get into Bush&#8217;s management of the federal budget in this post, even though that represents what is probably his biggest failure of economic leadership.  If you want some good budget analysis, you can visit any number of old Angry Bear posts, like <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2004/01/causes-of-budget-deficit-reckoning-in.html">this one</a> or <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2004/09/more-broken-promises.html">this one</a>.  But for today, let&#8217;s focus on how the economy has grown under Bush&#8217;s economic leadership.</p>
<p>Specifically, let&#8217;s compare Bush&#8217;s economic record with that of previous presidents.  The following table gives us the total changes (note that I have not annualized these rates of change) in a few important economic variables over the first 3 1/2 years of each president&#8217;s term since 1968: employment, GDP, compensation (the broadest measure of the income that workers receive), after-tax income, and government spending.</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/bush_comparison.jpg"></p>
<p>Many presidents faced recessions: all of the terms shaded in the table contained a recession, or 6 of the last 9 presidential terms in office.  Nixon#1, Bush Sr., and arguably the Reagan terms (if you count his intensification of the Cold War) experienced wars.  Nixon #2 and Carter experienced dramatic and unprecedented supply shocks, with the oil crises of the 1970s.  </p>
<p>Yet despite the difficulties faced by other presidents, Bush Jr.&#8217;s term in office has set records in almost every economic dimension (except for GDP growth, which has been average):
<ul>
<li>Bush Jr.&#8217;s term saw the absolute worst job creation, both in the private-sector and in the economy as a whole.<br />
</li>
<li>Bush Jr.&#8217;s term has yielded the absolute worst growth in employee compensation.<br />
</li>
<li>Bush Jr.&#8217;s term has produced gains in after-tax income that, while not the absolute worst, are the third worst of the last 9 presidential terms.  This despite what Bush has billed as &#8220;the largest tax cuts in history.&#8221;<br />
</li>
<li>Bush Jr.&#8217;s term has also produced the fastest growth in discretionary government spending of all 9 presidential terms.<br />
</li>
<li>Related to that, note as well that  Bush Jr.&#8217;s term is one of only a few (the Nixon terms and the Bush Sr. term being the others) that have seen government employment grow faster than private-sector employment. (You can see this from the difference between the two measures of employment growth.)  This growth in government makes the poor economic performance in the other categories even more remarkable.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bush has been running for reelection based on his record as a wartime president, and on his foreign policy record.  Even though his foreign policy has been deeply flawed, and even though this is becoming more apparent day by day, looking at data like this makes it clear why: running on his economic record would have been a sure-fire losing proposition.</p>

<p>UPDATE: I added a column for after-tax personal income, which I had apparently accidentally deleted from the table.</p>

                                <p>Maybe the only way for Bush to spin the employment report is to mention that the unemployment rate stayed at 5.4%.  But this is because the civilian labor force fell by 221,000 as the household survey of employment fell by 201,000.  The labor force participation rate fell to 65.9 percent and the employment-to-population ratio fell to 62.3%.  By contrast, the employment-to-population ratio was 64.4% when Bush took office.<br /></p>

                            </p>
                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>

                                <p>We now have the final employment figures that both sides can use down the home stretch of the campaign.  The Bush campaign can truthfully state that 1.71 million new jobs have been created in the last year (or 1.78 million new jobs since August 2003). </p>
<p>But when hearing such numbers, always remember to <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2004/09/context.html">apply context</a>: it remains true the Bush’s best year of job creation can’t measure up to Clinton’s worst year.</p>
<p>For their part, the Kerry campaign can truthfully assert that the US economy currently has lost a net of 821,000 total jobs since Bush was inaugurated, and 1.63 million private-sector jobs. (Yes, the Bush economy has been pretty good at creating more government jobs.)</p>
<p>The current recovery continues to set records for poor job creation.  Incorporating today’s new data, the following graph shows the total number of private-sector jobs during the current recession and recovery, and compares it to the last recession and recovery in 1990-94 – a recovery that was often called the “jobless recovery”.  (Interesting how in some cases it takes a decade for irony to become apparent.)  </p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/jobless_recovery.jpg"><br />(Note: Employment during each period is expressed as an index, with the employment level of 6 months before the official start of the recession set to be 100.  So the graph starts 6 months before each recession started.)</p>
<p>I’ve said it before, but it’s worth repeating: Bush was not responsible for the recession, in my opinion.  However, he is a least somewhat responsible for the type of economic recovery we’ve had.  Good economic policies would have led to good job creation over the past two years. But Bush’s sole and repetitive economic policy idea of cutting taxes, primarily on wealthy individuals, obviously does not fit that criterion.</p>

<blockquote><p>Nonfarm payroll employment continued to trend upward in September, increasing by 96,000, and the unemployment rate was unchanged at 5.4 percent, the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the U.S. Department of Labor reported today.  Over the prior 3 months, payroll employment rose by 103,000 on average. In September, modest job gains occurred in a few service-providing industries.</p></blockquote>
<p>As the stories I referenced yesterday indicated, expectations were for employment growth of roughly 150,000 &#8212; though even that would have been rather weak job growth for this stage in the economic recovery.  Note as well that employment growth in the private sector was only 59,000 jobs (the rest of the new jobs were government jobs), and that last month&#8217;s initial estimate of 144,000 new jobs was revised down to 128,000.  </p>
<p>Today&#8217;s numbers will not be welcomed by the Bush campaign.</p>

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Governor George W. Bush during the 2000 campaign promised that 5 million new jobs would be created over his 4-years in office if he were to become President. That would have represented about a 1% per year increase in employment, which is about how fast labor supply increases each year.</p>
<p>The Payroll Survey numbers from BLS show that employment may have fallen by over 910,000 from January 2001 to August 2004. Tomorrow, we shall learn the September 2004 employment numbers. Some have already started speculating that employment growth may be as little as 100,000. Kash noted earlier the White House “job memo” that the Payroll figures are underestimating recent job growth by an amount near 300,000. At the end of the day, however, the Payroll Survey will very likely suggest that employment has fallen under George Bush.</p>
<p>Of course, we know how this White House loves to cite the Household Survey figures whenever it suits their spin. I would not be surprised if President Bush tries to argue that this figure rose from 137.8 million as of January 2001 to 139.7 million as of August 2004 – or whatever figure is reported tomorrow morning. Of course, the BLS table does have the following footnote, which the White House often forgets to mention:</p>
<blockquote><p>Data affected by changes in population controls in January 2000, January 2003 and January 2004.</p></blockquote>
