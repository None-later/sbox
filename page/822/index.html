                                <p>The post had to be heavily modified.  Every so often I make a mistake.  Its both a pro and con of trying to be open and transparent&#8230;  sometimes you get egg on your face, but at least you learn something.  Reader Spencer indicated there was a problem with Table 1.  So I redid it.  And there was an error.  Which caused me to change the rest of the post&#8230;  apologies</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p>This post is on inflation and the real fed funds rate and how both moved over time, focusing in particular on the various Presidential administrations since Ike. The inflation is just the percentage change in the <a href="ftp://ftp.bls.gov/pub/special.requests/cpi/cpiai.txt">CPI</a> &#8211; since the data is provided monthly, I elected to go from January to January, as that is the month in which new Presidents are inaugurated. The real fed funds rate is just the <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h15/data/Monthly/H15_FF_O.txt">Fed Funds Rate</a> (again, for January) less the rate of inflation for the year. </p>
<p>Now, it should be noted that the President does not control inflation or the Fed Funds rate – both are controlled by the Federal Reserve. That is not to say the Fed doesn’t react to what the President is doing… a President might in effect provoke the Fed into inflicting inflation on the economy by engaging in particularly silly fiscal policy. For example, if the President institutes a particularly inane set of tax cuts plus finds a way to drive up the deficit in a way virtually designed not to provide much fiscal stimulus, the Fed might be forced to react by making money very, very cheap for a long time. But enough about the GW administration… let’s look at the graphs.</p>
<p>Here’s a graph of the inflation..</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RpkrGbCZtWI/AAAAAAAAAb4/2Tup3ces9Mc/s1600-h/inflation,+graph,+second+try.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RpkrGbCZtWI/AAAAAAAAAb4/2Tup3ces9Mc/s320/inflation,+graph,+second+try.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a summary.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RpjfHLCZtVI/AAAAAAAAAbw/D7dW1mj9xxM/s1600-h/inflation,+table+2,+updated.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RpjfHLCZtVI/AAAAAAAAAbw/D7dW1mj9xxM/s320/inflation,+table+2,+updated.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;<br />updated comment</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve had several people comment on this with questions.  Clearly I have done a poor job of explaining the series&#8230;. and apparently I truncated the table (relative to how I normally present it&#8230; I&#8217;ve expanded the table).  Apologies.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the deal&#8230;  January to January when Ike took office was 0.38%.  When he left office it was 1.71%.  Thus, the Fed allowed inflation to increase by a relatively large amount from the time he started in his job to when he left.  This is not to say inflation was high&#8230; merely that it grew by quite a bit.</p>
<p>Sorry if this hasn&#8217;t been clear. </p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p>Here’s a graph of the real fed funds rate.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RpkrYbCZtXI/AAAAAAAAAcA/wHStr5FwlLY/s1600-h/ffr+graph,+second+try.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RpkrYbCZtXI/AAAAAAAAAcA/wHStr5FwlLY/s320/ffr+graph,+second+try.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>There’s no summary of the real fed funds rate… since it goes from positive to negative and vice versa in some terms, the percentage change is not a meaningful term. Sorry.</p>
<p>Anyway, what do we get from this?</p>
<p>So what happened under Nixon/Ford and GW? Well, in the former instance, the economy was in trouble with the oil embargo, and with the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system, the Fed found itself in waters that had been uncharted for a long time. Mistakes happen. With GW… the tax cuts in 2001 and 2002 and 2003 were not of the sort designed to provide any real fiscal stimulus after the slight downturn in March 2001, and as the downturn seemed to extend and extend (recall &#8211; GW likes to count changes from August of 2003), the Fed stepped in with a series of rate cuts.</p>
<p>Does any of this matter? Who knows? But a quick look at the correlation between inflation and real median income…</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rpdn3rCZtPI/AAAAAAAAAbA/_U2mgAxXdmE/s1600-h/inflation+and+ffr,+table+3.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rpdn3rCZtPI/AAAAAAAAAbA/_U2mgAxXdmE/s320/inflation+and+ffr,+table+3.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>As always, correlations are simplistic&#8230; ignoring the cross-effects of multiple factors but&#8230;. Inflation and percentage change in real median income are negatively correlated (-0.6). Inflation in any given year doesn’t seem to have a big effect on income the next year… but its possible with more granular data we can show that higher real median income actually affects the inflation rate. Now… recall from a post a while back that JFK/LBJ and Clinton were the two administrations during which <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/05/real-median-income-by-presidential.html">real median grew the fastest</a>.  The JFK/LBJ median income growth is certainly surprising in this context.</p>
<p>I’ll try to do see how all this ties in with home ownership at some later point.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p>Another update&#8230;  this seems to be the most &#8220;everything that can go wrong will go wrong&#8221; post I&#8217;ve ever written.  Courtesy of reader dxc&#8230; the original graphs had no labels except 0s on the Y axis.  Its been corrected (I hope!).</p>

<blockquote><p>Tax revenue raised from penalties and taxes designed to discourage certain societal behaviour is problematic. Government has learned to rely upon these revenue streams in order to fund certain government activities (like law enforcement). This allows the toleration of some level of illegal, unhealthy and/or dangerous behaviour in society in order to fund government spending. Raising these taxes and penalties is therefore problematic as it both reduces a potential revenue stream while raising political issues with voters who see such rises as merely revenue raising. If this revenue is directed towards the central bank for money destruction, instead of government treasuries for spending, then these penalties can be raised with less political fallout.</p></blockquote>

<p>This blog has a lot of commentary on the US economy, most of it is pessimistic.  It is always interesting to read what our &#8220;competitors&#8221; in the world economy think about the US.  <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/anatole_kaletsky/article2062059.ece">This </a> article is titled <em><strong>&#8220;Is the puny dollar a sign of America&#8217;s Decline?&#8221;</strong></em></p>
<blockquote><p>Yesterday, the pound and the euro hit their highest levels in a generation against the US dollar. The dollar, meanwhile, collapsed to a record low against an average of all the world&#8217;s major currencies. It is tempting to interpret the flight from the dollar in financial markets as the clearest, most objective, indicator of America&#8217;s relative decline.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Europe has long been derided as an ageing, sclerotic continent, doomed to irrelevance in a world dominated by America and Asia. But could it actually be America, not Europe, that is failing to compete in the globalised world economy and is now threatened with long-term decline?</p></blockquote>
<p>From this standard doom and gloom opening, the author Anatole Koletsky, (see bio with the article) comes to some non-standard conclusions.</p>
<blockquote><p>Sadly, for those of us who live in Britain and Europe and would like to believe that the strength of our currencies reflects our superlative economic prospects, the answer is an emphatic no. </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;..since the deregulation of currencies and financial markets in the 1980s and 1990s, currency strength has conveyed almost no information about the health of a national economy and none at all about a country&#8217;s competitive position in global trade. For example, anyone who believes that the falling dollar reflects America&#8217;s huge trade deficit and foreign borrowing should consider that the one leading currency even weaker in the past three years than the dollar has been the yen; yet Japan has the world&#8217;s biggest trade surplus and is the greatest creditor nation the world has ever seen.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>To the extent that any relationship has existed between currencies and economic performance, it has usually been the wrong way round rising currencies usually preceded periods of economic decline, while weakening currencies have presaged economic strength.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Americans, meanwhile, will enjoy the benefits of a super-cheap currency, which will more than offset falling property prices and problems with a small minority of mortgage loans. American politicians, for all their faults, instinctively understand this, which is why they have generally welcomed a falling dollar and have been pressuring China and Japan to let the dollar weaken against the yen and the renmimbi not just, as at present, against the euro and the pound</p></blockquote>
<p>Fascinating stuff.  Some good correlations that back up his contentions.  Remember this is a competitor.</p>

<blockquote><p>For many economists, questioning free-market orthodoxy is akin to expressing a belief in intelligent design at a Darwin convention: Those who doubt the naturally beneficial workings of the market are considered either deluded or crazy … “There is much too much ideology,” said Alan S. Blinder … Economics, he added, is “often a triumph of theory over fact.” Mr. Blinder helped kindle the discussion by publicly warning in speeches and articles this year that as many as 30 million to 40 million Americans could lose their jobs to lower-paid workers abroad. Just by raising doubts about the unmitigated benefits of free trade, he made headlines and had colleagues rubbing their eyes in astonishment &#8230; “What I’ve learned is anyone who says anything even obliquely that sounds hostile to free trade is treated as an apostate,” Mr. Blinder said.</p></blockquote>
<p>Dr. Blinder recently published his concerns over offshoring in <a href="http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20060301faessay85209/alan-s-blinder/offshoring-the-next-industrial-revolution.html">Foreign Affairs</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In February 2004, when N. Gregory Mankiw, a Harvard professor then serving as chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, caused a national uproar with a &#8220;textbook&#8221; statement about trade, economists rushed to his defense. Mankiw was commenting on the phenomenon that has been clumsily dubbed &#8220;offshoring&#8221; (or &#8220;offshore outsourcing&#8221;) &#8211; the migration of jobs, but not the people who perform them, from rich countries to poor ones. Offshoring, Mankiw said, is only &#8220;the latest manifestation of the gains from trade that economists have talked about at least since Adam Smith &#8230; Although there are no reliable national data, fragmentary studies indicate that well under a million service-sector jobs in the United States have been lost to offshoring to date … That said, we should not view the coming wave of offshoring as an impending catastrophe. Nor should we try to stop it. The normal gains from trade mean that the world as a whole cannot lose from increases in productivity, and the United States and other industrial countries have not only weathered but also benefited from comparable changes in the past. But in order to do so again, the governments and societies of the developed world must face up to the massive, complex, and multifaceted challenges that offshoring will bring. National data systems, trade policies, educational systems, social welfare programs, and politics all must adapt to new realities. Unfortunately, none of this is happening now.</p></blockquote>
<p>While this seems fair enough, <a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2007/07/how-to-be-apostate.html">Greg Mankiw</a> launches four objections:</p>
<blockquote><p>1. Alan&#8217;s views are a challenge to the economic mainstream.</p>
<p>2. Alan did not present his new views in a refereed academic publication but instead in Foreign Affairs, a publication aimed at the broad policy community, and then in the Washington Post.</p>
<p>3. Alan&#8217;s new views are conveniently consistent with the political party with which Alan is affiliated.</p>
<p>4. Alan&#8217;s arguments are not persuasive. </p>
<p>It is as if I wrote an article saying that the broad-based income tax cuts raise tax revenue and then published it in the Club for Growth Newsletter with a summary on the editorial page of the Wall Street Journal. My fellow economists would look upon me as an apostate, and they would be right.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’ll let others be the judge on #4, which is a fair area to debate.  But is Greg saying that a member of my party who is also an economist is not allowed to raise distributional issues?  Fine – then the converse should hold &#8211; every Republican economist must start by discussing the distributional issues of trade policy. And while one has to concede that Foreign Affairs is not the Journal of Political Economy, to compare it to a dishonest rag like the Club for Growth Newsletter is really insulting.  But let me stop and just turn the phone over the Alan Blinder (his comment at Greg’s place):</p>
<blockquote><p>I never blog, and may never again. But this one is over the top, Greg. &#8220;Anonymous&#8221; who posted at 2:28 has it exactly right:</p>
<p>1. Out of the mainstream? Both my friend and former student and I teach introductory economics to some pretty smart students. With me, the first lesson on international trade is that (and why) there are gains from trade. (I love Ricardo!) The second is that trade always creates both winners and losers, though the nation as a whole gains. Don&#8217;t Harvard students hear the second?</p>
<p>2. This is silly. As Greg knows well, refereed journals don&#8217;t publish &#8220;think pieces&#8221; such as mine in Foreign Affairs. And yes, I was tryng to reach non-economists. They are, after all, 99.999% of the human race. (I believe Greg also writes occasionally for nonprofessional audiences&#8211;though not in Econometrica.)</p>
<p>3. Consistent with my party&#8217;s views? That&#8217;s not what many in my party think.</p>
<p>4. Not persuasive? Well, persuasiveness is in the mind of the beholder. I clearly haven&#8217;t persuaded Greg. But, then again, I never persuaded Milton Friedman to stop watching M2.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>This post is on spending on homeownership rates and how they changed over time. And yes, I’ll look at how it changed by administration. Why not? Presidents like to take credit for it. Consider.</p>
<p>Here’s stuff on the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/infocus/homeownership/">White House web site</a>. Here’s a speech by GW at HUD <a href="http://www.hud.gov/news/speeches/presremarks.cfm">talking about some of his plans</a>. And <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2004/03/bush-takes-credit-for-home-ownership.html/">here’s</a> a vintage Angry Bear piece… Kash catches GW crediting an insignificant amount of tax incentives for increased homeownership increases. But there are many reasons a President might affect homeownerhsip. As noted in GW’s speeches, the President funds programs that help people buy homes. There’s HUD. There are tax incentives. And of course, the effect of the economy.</p>
<p>Data goes back to 1965 and comes from <a href="http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/housing/hvs/historic/histt14.html">the Census</a>. Given the data is quarterly and not annual, I’m going with Q1 of the year figures. Thus, I’m crediting each President with the first quarter of the year they leave office… hence, Clinton’s figures go from Q1 1993 to Q1 2001, and the percentage change I’m using is the percentage change over that time.</p>
<p>Here’s what it looks like.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RpYXlbCZtKI/AAAAAAAAAaY/zguwT2iHGDY/s1600-h/Homeownership+rate,+graph.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RpYXlbCZtKI/AAAAAAAAAaY/zguwT2iHGDY/s320/Homeownership+rate,+graph.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>And a summary.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RpYYRrCZtMI/AAAAAAAAAao/xjC6MWEEfX8/s1600-h/Homeownership+rate,+table.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RpYYRrCZtMI/AAAAAAAAAao/xjC6MWEEfX8/s320/Homeownership+rate,+table.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>The three Dem admins are one, two, and three. (FWIW, the a means test indicates that the average increase in the change in homeownership is different between Dem and Rep administrations with a P Value of 0.031.  (Note correction&#8230; earlier I had posted .021)) GW comes in fourth, but with rising interest rates, he may yet drop. </p>
<p>And GW has been the beneficiary of extremely low real interest rates, which should only boost home ownership rates. On the other hand, Reagan suffered from high real interest rates as the Fed continued to worry about inflation returning even toward the end of his administration.</p>
<p>But do real interest rates determine the whole thing? Well, no. Under GHW, real interest rates fell&#8230; but so did home ownership. Under Clinton, real rates rose, and were higher for most years than all other administrations except Reagan. LBJ/JFK seems to be in the middle of the pack for real interest rates. </p>
<p>So clearly, other things matter too. </p>
<p>I guess this post suggests some further posts&#8230;. funding on housing programs, and real interest rates. I&#8217;ll try to get to those soon.</p>

<p>In comments, reader Spencer notes&#8230;  </p>
<blockquote><p>At Census they have ownership rates back to 1900 although it is not as frequent.</p>
<p>What this data shows is that the homeownership rate was very steady in the low 40% from 1900 to 1940. But from 1940 to 1980 it rose steadily from the around 40% level to around 65% level you show in the chart.</p>
<p>If you look at the longer term trend since 1940 the recent rise appears in a different perspective. What it would show is that the rate of increase in homeowners ship rise from 1995 to 2005 <br />is about the sames as was experienced from 1940 to 1980 &#8212; about a half a percentage point each year.</p></blockquote>
<p>I also add&#8230; part of the reason for sustained high real interest rates under Reagan not mentioned earlier was the rapid run-up of the national debt.  So Reagan wasn&#8217;t entirely a victim of circumstance&#8230; this was partly self-inflicted.</p>

                                <p>Is CNN trying to out Fox Faux News for stupidest commentary on cable?  Dr. Sanjay Gupta might come across as a nice guy who knows something about his specialty, which clearly is not health care economics.  <a href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/beat_the_press_archive?month=07&#038;year=2007&#038;base_name=michael_gupta_says_medicare_is">Dean Baker</a> notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>CNN’s health care analyst is now telling people that Medicare is going bankrupt.  What does this mean? Medicare’s costs are projected to exceed its revenue and drain the surplus from its trust fund in a bit over a decade, but this has been true at several points in the past. Did Congress tell tens of millions of beneficiaries to get lost? No, Congress appropriated the money needed to keep the program going &#8230; If Dr. Gupta meant to imply that Medicare, as a government program is uniquely inefficient, then he is way off the mark.</p></blockquote>
<p>The other day &#8211; Dr. Gupta got into it with Michael Moore when the former tried to claim that other countries spend more on health care when one adds in what the public sector ponies up.  <a href="http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/003176.html">Max Sawicky</a> brings us what Mr. Moore had to say – and why Mr. Moore got this one right too.  If Dr. Gupta wants to play a neurosurgeon on TV – fine.  But let’s stop pretending he’s an expert on everything that is health related.</p>

A few key excerpts from the NY Times article follow:</p>
<blockquote><p>The figures suggested that incremental adjustments by the Beijing authorities in the value of the currency, the yuan, had so far done little to alter a trade picture that has angered American lawmakers and some business groups in Washington &#8230; But the hefty surplus, which increased 27 percent from June 2006, also reflected slowing growth in imports. Imports in June expanded at a relatively modest 14 percent compared with the year before.  The yuan has been allowed to appreciate by a little over 9 percent since China broke the currency’s fixed tie to the United States dollar two years ago. The Bush administration and members of Congress have pressed Beijing to allow the yuan to rise much faster, with some arguing that it be allowed to appreciate by a third or more against the dollar … Mr. Rothman said the value of the yuan was not the most important factor in the Chinese trade picture. American exports to China have increased 188 percent since 2001, a much faster pace of growth than the United States has had with any other major trading partner, despite what some economists argue is the yuan’s artificially low purchasing power.</p></blockquote>
<p>Dean is not happy with Andy Rothman:</p>
<blockquote><p>Andy Rothman, a business economist located in Shanghai, asserted that the value of the yuan was not a big factor in the trade deficit that the United States has with China. In other words, if the dollar fell by 20-30 percent against the yuan, and the relative price of Chinese imports to the United States rose by a similar amount, (and the price of U.S. exports to China would fall by a comparable amount), Mr. Rothman believes that there would be little impact on trade.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2007/07/dean-bakers-ire.html">Brad DeLong</a> follows up:</p>
<blockquote><p>What is Milton Friedman&#8217;s first rule? That demand curves and supply curves are never vertical, and never horizontal. Demand curves slope down. Supply curves slope up. Quantities matter for determining what prices are. Prices matter for determining what quantities are.</p></blockquote>
<p>But what was Mr. Rothman really saying?  I think the key here is that the Chinese government has allowed the yuan to appreciate by less than 10 percent.  Consider the contention of many that the yuan was overvalued by as much as 40 percent so this process of managed floating has allowed only a partial movement along the demand curve for yuan.  Other events could have shifted the demand curve by more than enough to offset this.  </p>
<p>I like the way that Brad frames this in terms of “Milton Friedman&#8217;s first rule”, which strikes me as a market-clearing approach.  In other words – if the demand curve shifted upwards, then under a floating exchange rate regime the yuan would appreciate by perhaps quite a bit.  But when I push this free floating view of international markets as an endorsement of U.S. fiscal restraint (aka the dollar will devalue which should encourage more net exports), folks remind me of the reality that the yuan is not allowed to freely float.  So maybe Mr. Rothman’s point is that changes in relative prices have not mattered much because the Chinese has not allowed the market to determine the exchange rate.  In other words – if they adopted free floating, how much would the yuan appreciate and how much of an effect on trade flows would this have?  If that was Mr. Rothman’s point, the coverage of his comments in the NY Times article did not convey this very clearly.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: With a hat tip to AB reader Juan, let’s take a look at a discussion by <a href="http://www.feer.com/articles1/2007/0707/free/p014.html">Jonathan Anderson</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>For those who closely follow the mainland economy, the last few years have provided another interesting spectacle. Remember that the yuan has been strengthening gradually against the dollar, by 2% in 2005, another 4% in 2006 and at a 6% year-on-year pace so far this year. At the same time, Chinese rural migrant wages, which were rising leisurely at 3% to 4% per year at the beginning of the decade, are now shooting up by 10% or even 15% annually as factories come to terms with a dwindling supply of young, single farm workers.  This double-edged sword of an appreciating currency and rising labor costs should have imposed palpable damage on China’s traditional export sectors: toys, clothing, furniture, appliances and electronics processing. However, according to industrial earnings and profit statistics, overall light manufacturing margins have been as steady as a rock, with no signs of pressure so far. Why? Because exporters simply passed on the costs to overseas buyers. In a world where individual country figures rarely tally on pricing trends, one of the startling facts is that Chinese, Hong Kong, U.S., Japanese and European data all agree that mainland export prices have started to rise in the past three years. From 1995 to 2003, dollar prices in traditional manufacturing industries like clothing and toys were falling on the order of 3% to 4% per year. Since 2004, however, those same prices have been rising by 3% to 4% per year, a very visible turnaround from the previous picture. Exactly the same is true for it electronics. According to partner country data, Chinese electronics prices used to fall by 6% to 10% per year in dollar terms. Now they are barely falling at all &#8211; and mainland data actually show a sharp increase in prices since the beginning of the year.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, China’s productivity has been improving in certain sectors.  At first, their wages were not keeping pace but now with wages rising and the modest amount of yuan appreciation, what had been a steadily falling relative price for Chinese made goods had flat lined if not start reversing itself.  Mr. Anderson makes a case for revaluation without trashing the notion that fixed exchange rates might prove beneficial in certain situations.  In all, an interesting read.</p>
