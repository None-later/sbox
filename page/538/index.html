                                <p>By Stormy</p>
<p>The big picture is always important. Today&#8217;s <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601068&#038;sid=aL2e1lkzqiXE&#038;refer=home">report</a> of the dramatic fall of the factory index is incredibly bad news, a significant part of the that big picture:<br />
<blockquote>The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia&#8217;s general economic index plunged to minus 37.5 this month, less than forecast and the lowest reading since October 1990, from 3.8 in September, the bank said today. Negative readings signal contraction. The index averaged 5.1 last year.</p></blockquote>
<p>How we respond to this fact has to be seen in a global context. We have watched one bubble burst; we are now about to confront the explosion of a negative bubble, a kind of black hole that we have been cultivating for some time: our manufacturing sector. The easy explanation is not always the correct one. Many will blame the present deep recession on just the financial crisis.</p>
<p>That is not the full story.</p>
<p>For over a decade, we have watched our manufacturing flee elsewhere; watched our largest companies outsource and offshore&#8211;with barely a peep from many economists. We have added jobs to government, health care, and service industries; manufacturing jobs have dwindled. Even many of our important service industries&#8211;in IT, medicine, and accounting&#8211;, we have outsourced, off-shored in the name of efficiency. Even Research and Development is leaving these shores.</p>
<p><i>In short, the engine for our real recovery lies littered around us, rusted, broken, unattended, and ignored.</i> I am not going to wage my usual complaint about the WTO or our trade policies, or push once again for fair, not free, trade. Nor will I complain that globalization was too rapid, too poorly structured. It is too late for all that. What&#8217;s done is done.</p>
<p>What I want to do is to adumbrate the directions in which the U.S. and the world seem to be going. Then I want to offer what I see as the only hope.</p>
<p>The U.S. is in for a long downward slide. The fixes that are being proposed will be temporary, at best. To some extent, Europe and other developed countries will be tied to U.S. fortunes; many have sowed the same seeds that the U.S. has. But there is hope&#8211;and it may seem an unusual one to those who have understood me. That hope is China, hope that China moves as quickly as possible from an export platform to a more consumer based economy, hope that China is wise enough not to continue those policies that have drawn foreign company after company into its fold. (Those countries that can feed China&#8217;s thirst for raw materials will do well.)</p>
<p>The Short-term Fix</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/17/opinion/17krugman.html?_r=1&#038;hp&#038;oref=slogin">Krugman</a> clearly states how the U.S. will respond: &#8220;Lets Get Fiscal.&#8221; Massive government spending will be the policy, regardless of U.S. indebtedness&#8211;spending to support ailing communities whose tax bases have collapsed, spending to increase unemployment insurance for our service-oriented economy and to what is left of our manufacturing industry, spending on our infrastructure to provide jobs, spending to help students no longer will be able to afford an education, spending to help those pushed over the edge by one medical crisis.</p>
<p>Can we do otherwise? No. But understand this is our last fix.</p>
<p>After it is over, we will have to pay the bill; we will have to return to that place where all ladders start. It will be a long climb. We will have to protect our people from predators, both at home and abroad; we will have to give them a safe place to work, free of medical worries, free of worries that an education is too expensive. We will have to construct policies that allow our people to compete fairly among the nations of the world. No more platitudes about being competitive; no more platitudes about freedom and democracy; no more celebrations that we are the best. Clearly, we are not gathering any laurels lately.</p>
<p>Competitiveness is not just one man working hard; it is a society structured so that all hard work counts.</p>
<p>Hard work, hard planning, hard thinking will be in order. We will have to see beyond one minute, one day, or one year. We will actually have to have some kind of vision for our future. Our government will be our collective instrument, not the whims and greed of a few important individuals. We may finally understand that democracy is hard, hard work, not the celebration of this or that personality. Then and only then will we begin that long climb upward.</p>
<p>China: Policies and Growth</p>
<p>With a population of over 1.3 billion people and with an impoverished third world economy, China&#8217;s sudden entrance onto the world stage was an enormous counterweight to the industrialized nations. No country has ever had such an impact on the world, not even Japan as it climbed from the devastation of World War II. How is China doing <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601068&#038;refer=home&#038;sid=a2RXhtO4qIlc">now</a>, a mere seven years after its entry into the WTO?</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Reserves: an astounding $1.7 trillion&#8211;and growing</li>
<li>GDP growth: 9.7% with projected growth around 8% next year. (IMF predicts 9.3%.)</li>
<li>Currency exchange rate: 6.8360. Recently lowered (to protect some industries)</li>
<li>Inflation rate: 4.6% (Down .3% from last month)</li>
</ul>
<p>While its growth will slow, China seems to be weathering the storm.</p>
<p>How did China, a barely industrialized, impoverished nation achieve all this? Quite simply, it played perfectly its one great trump card: its 1.3 billion people. It then fashioned its playing field to exploit that advantage, by offering juicy inducements to foreign firms.</p>
<p>
<ol>
<li>It instituted a two-tier tax rate, giving the advantage to foreign firms. Foreign firms were taxed at 15%; indigenous firms, at 30%) In key industries, foreign firms were given a tax holiday if they promised to stay for ten years.</li>
<li>It instituted no immediate provisions to protect its labor force from substandard working conditions, unscrupulous employers, or substandard pay.</li>
<li>It used tax rebates to leverage exports on selected items. In short, no taxation for exported consumer goods. For a more complete discussion of how export tax rebates work, see data <a href="http://www.globalsources.com/TNTLIST/2005/0805/DZRA_TAXREBATEMAIN.HTM">here</a> and discussion <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/09/corporate-taxation-piece-of-large.html">here</a> and <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/05/china-tax-rebates-on-exports.html">here</a>.</li>
<li>It pegged its currency to the dollar in order to further leverage its exports.</li>
<li>It ignored environmental degradation. (Most environmental regulations can be viewed as a hidden tax, advantaging companies that produce the pollution as well as those non-polluting companies who make use of the products that the polluting companies provide: Energy, for example.)</li>
<li>It subsidized the cost of oil, thereby making energy cheaper for all.</li>
</ol>
<p>In short, China combined labor, tax, and environmental arbitrage together with its immense and impoverished population to build an unrivaled export platform, an export platform that fed the Western consumer with goods produced in many instances by foreign firms from industrialized nations. The next stage&#8211;already in motion&#8211;is to cultivate its own companies. Flushed now with cash, China is in an excellent position to do so.</p>
<p>The Hope</p>
<p>As I said above, the hope is that the world&#8211;and China especially&#8211;takes a breather and reconsiders how the game has been played. There is too much at stake. We simply cannot afford the kind of arbitrage to which I have pointed. It is too dangerous for all. We have to hope that China moves from being primarily an export platform to a consumer-based society. We have to hope that China vigorously begins to levy all those hidden environmental taxes, which in turn will raise the price of goods as well as clean the environment. We have to hope that China rapidly protects its labor force from predation, that it allows real bargaining between employer and employee. We have to hope that export rebates disappear entirely. We have to hope that China provides its people with the kind of social net that some more advanced countries provide. We have to see hope that China understands that an all-too rapid climb to becoming frontier nation can have disastrous global consequences. And when all of this is done, we have to hope that then&#8211;and only then, we are ready to compete fairly in the marketplace of ideas and products.</p>

<p>Why is Obama being treated so well by the right wing?  No, seriously.  I mean it. </p>
<p>Remember when Clinton was President and the right treated us to all sorts of stories about black helicopters, foreign military bases on US soil, and how Clinton was gonna turn us all over to the UN or the Chinese for indentured servitude or some such nonsense?  But, not all the rumors started after Clinton became President.  If memory serves, they began telling us about his drug-dealing and how he had left a string of bodies behind in Mena, Arkansas, long before he got into the White House.  Compared to being cold-blooded drug-dealing murderer, being a closet Muslim who pals around with someone who was once a low-budget terrorist is small potatoes. </p>
<p>So what&#8217;s the deal?   Its not like these folks have gotten more reasonable or more sane since 1992.  My theory is this &#8211; quite frankly, Obama looks <strike>kinda</strike> like a weenie.  Even the boys on talk radio can&#8217;t, with a straight face, tell a story about Obama killing people (especially when McCain looks like he would chew the head off a puppy if it piddled within thirty feet of his shoe) and even the most deranged right wing bloggers (with the possible exception of <a href="http://gatewaypundit.blogspot.com/">this one</a>) wouldn&#8217;t be able to make themselves believe it if they heard it. </p>
<p>That&#8217;s my theory.  What&#8217;s yours?<br />___________________________________<br />by cactus</p>

<p>Well, because no one took me up on my offer to present third party positions, I thought I might take the opportunity to present some of Nader&#8217;s positions. Compare either of the mainstream candidates&#8217; position to his:</p>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Single payer health care plan that replaces for-profit, investor-owned health care and removes the private health insurance industry (full Medicare for all)</li>
<li>Tax wealth more than work. This position needs elaboration:<br />
<blockquote>The complexity and distortions of the federal tax code produces distributions of tax incidence and payroll tax burdens that are skewed in favor of the wealthy and the corporations further garnished by tax shelters, insufficient enforcement, and other avoidances.<br />Corporate tax contributions as a percent of the overall federal revenue stream have been declining for fifty years and now stand at 7.4% despite massive record profits. A fundamental reappraisal of our tax laws should start with a principle that taxes should apply first to behavior and conditions we favor least and pinch basic necessities least, such as the clearly addictive industries (alcohol and tobacco), pollution, speculation, gambling, extreme luxuries, instead of taxing work or instead of the 5% to 7% sales tax food, furniture, clothing or books.</p></blockquote>
</li>
<li>Fair Trade that Protects the Environment, Labor Rights and Consumer Needs<br />
<blockquote>NAFTA and the WTO make commercial trade supreme over environmental, labor, and consumer standards and need to be replaced with open agreements that pull up rather than pull down these standards. These forms of secret autocratic governance and their detailed rules are corporate-managed trade that puts short-term corporate profits as the priority. While global trade is a fact of life, trade policies must be open, democratic, and not strip-mine environmental, social and labor standards. </p></blockquote>
<p></li>
<li>End corporate personhood.<br />
<blockquote>In 1886 the Supreme Court, in the case of Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad, was interpreted to have ruled that corporations were “persons”—before women were considered persons under the 19th amendment to have the right to vote.<br />Ever since, corporations have enjoyed most of the same constitutional rights granted to real people.<br />But corporations are not humans. They don’t vote. They don’t have children. They don’t die in Iraq. </p></blockquote>
<p></li>
</ol>
<p>These are but a few of Nader&#8217;s positions.</p>

                                <p>Via <a href="http://www.kathryncramer.com/kathryn_cramer/">Kathryn</a> (who previously pointed us to <a href="http://www.kathryncramer.com/kathryn_cramer/2008/09/using-mathemati.html">a similar exercise for the U.S. election</a>), Theo Gray <a href="http://blog.wolfram.com/2008/10/16/stock-market-returns-by-presidential-party/">expands on the work of Tommy McCall</a> (as published in the NYT under the title &#8220;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2008/10/14/opinion/20081014_OPCHART.html?ei=5070&#038;emc">Bulls, Bears, Donkeys, and Elephants</a>,&#8221; which was <a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2008/10/republicans-democrats-and-stock-market.html">glibly dismissed</a> by Greg Mankiw*).</p>
<p>While his conclusion will be <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/10/now-might-be-a.html">heartening to Brad DeLong</a>:<br />
<blockquote>And one more thing, notice the little gray figure labeled &#8220;Current value under Both&#8221;. That’s the figure if you had just left your money in the market the whole time regardless of party affiliation. Notice that it’s much bigger than either the Republican or the Democratic figure. Not a bit bigger, much bigger, so much bigger that if you check the box to graph the &#8220;both&#8221; curve (basically the index value itself) we have to let it go right off the scale in order to make the other two lines visible at all.</p>
<p>Play with the policy delay slider and you can see the Democratic and the Republican curves fighting it out in the noise at the bottom of the graph while the steady-as-she-goes full-time investment curve towers over them laughing at their silly antics. It doesn’t matter who is in charge, the market is saying, in the long run it’s going to be OK.</p></blockquote>
<p>the whole thing is worth reading, especially as Mr. Gray has sent the model up so that you can &#8220;playing with it&#8221; yourself.**</p>
<p>*We might justly ask Mr. Mankiw to then justify several of his Very Public Statements about the value to the market provided by the Current Administration when he worked for them.  But that is for another time.</p>
<p>**I hope to do the playing maybe this weekend, by which time I might expand the details of <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/10/want-reason-why-income-was-fairly-flat.html">this post</a>. Meanwhile, I note that <a href="http://theskinnybrownman.blogspot.com/2008/10/facts.html">The Skinny Brown Man</a> has made an interesting start by putting it into a much larger context.</p>

<p>Industrial production fell 2.8%in September.  But about 2 and a quarter percentage points of that was due to hurricanes.  If you back the hurricane impact out,  September output would be about where the X is on the chart.  This implies that manufacturing output is continuing to demonstrate roughly the same type of declines it has all year &#8212; neither accelerating nor improving.  This data and the employment data imply that the economy is continuing to act as if it is in a moderate recession. But on the other hand there are no signs that the bottom is approaching. We could just continue to see this same type of moderate declines for a long time.</p>

                            </p>
                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>

                                <p>So titles Bernd Debusman in his piece, in of all places, <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSTRE49E5Q620081015">Reuters.</a> That Reuters should run such an article reveals just how precarious the present situation is.</p>
<p>After pointing out that the present contagion is U.S. inspired, that there are now calls for an international conference Bretton Woods style, that nationalizing banks is no longer off the table, Bernd points out that one of the ten central tenets of communism is &#8220;Centralization of credit in the hands of the state &#8230;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bernd then gets to the heart of the matter:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>
<p>But as far as the United States is concerned, the events of the past few weeks represent a momentous break with decades of a free market philosophy that abhorred government intervention in (and regulation of) financial markets. </p>
<p>&#8220;There is little question that making the government a major investor in American banks raises thorny questions &#8230; about the role of the public sector in private markets,&#8221; Sen. Charles Schumer, a member of the Senate finance and banking committees, wrote in the Wall Street Journal the day the government announced it was planning to take equity stakes worth up to $250 billion in American banks. </p>
<p>It will take time for questions about the public sector in private markets to be answered. But it looks likely that some things will never be quite the same, no matter who wins the presidential election on November 4. </p>
<p>For one, the control center of the financial market has already begun shifting from New York to Washington. </p>
<p>The &#8220;big government&#8221; that free marketeers identified as something evil is almost certain to make a comeback, although spending on America&#8217;s crumbling infrastructure, its inefficient health care system, and environmental programs will be limited by the Everest-sized public debt. The U.S. national debt has increased by an average of $3.34 billion a day over the past year and now stands at more than $10 trillion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That debt is not going away&#8211;and it will put a serious crimp of any attempt to solve U.S. problems that have festered for years. And something else is not going away.</p>
<p>
<blockquote>Both in the United States and in Europe, officials have stressed that government intervention in the banks will be temporary but whether they will be able to stuff that genie back into the bottle remains to be seen. And &#8220;temporary&#8221; has not been defined.</p></blockquote>
<p>So, is the plan to return to business as usual as quickly as possible, i.e., sell those shares back to the private sector? The beast is not dead, only snarling angrily at its present predicament.</p>
<p>Here is one very uncomfortable fact, the income gap:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;There is a tremendous opportunity now to narrow the income gap,&#8221; says Sam Pizzigati of the Institute for Policy Studies, a Washington think tank.<br />That gap resembles the top-to-bottom income distribution just before the Great Depression, according to the Washington Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. </p>
<p>Then as now, the top 1 percent of households accounted for around one fifth of the national income. In 1980, their share was 8 percent.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At some point we will have to address the problem of how wealth is distributed.</p>
<p>At some point, we will have to define more clearly a great many relationships.</p>
<p>
<blockquote>History shows that deep financial crises have helped spur public policy reforms and those pending include legislation that would make it easier for American workers to join labor unions. At present, 7.5 percent of private sector workers are union members, the lowest percentage in the industrialized world.</p></blockquote>

[&#8230;]&#8221; </a> Consider that on the same day our government moved to take over collapsing banks, the U.S. Census Bureau released data that 16 percent of Americans under 65 are uninsured, and in some areas, like south Florida, the number is as high as 30 percent. The news isn&#8217;t so great for those with insurance either. Another report out today in the Wall Street Journal, noted that employers are expected to increase co-pays, deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs to workers by more than 10 percent next year. This comes at a time when one in five Americans already self-rations care for which they are &#8220;insured&#8221; by skipping medications, doctors visits, vaccinations, and other needed care.&#8221; And then the insurer weasels out of paying what they&#8217;ve already promised.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>Lifted from comments from <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/10/always-tax-cuts-for-rich.html">Tax cuts for rich</a>&#8230;.<a href="http://www.haloscan.com/comments/angrybear/8796986027875257598/#724213">Movie Guy</a> says:</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll skip the usual political commentary and comparison of supposed high office politician &#8220;plans&#8221; and focus on what is really happening based on my understanding. </p>
<p> The events of the past thirty days or so have resulted in significant withdrawals from the stock market including massive withdrawals from money market and mutual funds. While most of those funds may have been shifted to Treasuries, CDs, and other instruments offering relatively safe investments, it doesn&#8217;t take much forward thinking to understand that people from all walks of life are concerned about their financial futures. </p>
<p> How serious is this situation? A friend who is a heavy hitting stock market player with a solid track record made a statement last week that caught my attention: &#8220;If the DOW drops to 4,500 or 5,000, most of the 401K investments will have been virtually wiped out.&#8221; If that is the case, what will people do then? </p>
<p> Instead of the usual political banter, I have to question why the seriousness of the ongoing economic collapse and related stock market implosion aren&#8217;t being discussed in more meaningful terms on all economic blogs. </p>
<p> I see no reason to listen to any politican or hack who recommends staying invested in this stock market with existing portfolio packages unless one has the stomach and intention to suffer through what may be a very long hike up the investment trail. </p>
<p> Meanwhile, people have bills to pay while trying to figure out new budgets and future plans. And those tasks may become immense as the developing situations unfold. </p>
<p> Maybe we should talking about these issues&#8230; <br /> ____________________________<br />Lifted from comments Movie Guy</p>
