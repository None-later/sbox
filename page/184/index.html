                                <p>(cross posted from Daily Kos Social Security Defenders Group)<br />There are three prevalent myths about the assets in Social Security Trust Funds, plural because there are two of them OAS-Old/Age Survivors and DI-Disability Insurance. The first myth, which comes mostly from the Right, is that those assets are just &#8216;Phony IOUs&#8217;. The second myth comes mostly from the Left and is just a version of &#8216;Phony IOU&#8217;, that the assets of the Trust Fund were real but were raided starting with Ronald Reagan. I and others have dealt with these two before and I mention them only to dismiss them for now, though happy to discuss the ideas in comments.</p>
<p>The third myth, and the topic of this post is the idea that the Trust Fund assets were and are real and are just a big juicy target of Wall Street, that is that they have not been raided YET. Well this like the first two is based on a profound misunderstanding of the nature and operations of the Trust Funds since their inception. But to clear up, or even begin to, requires some tedious plodding through the numbers and concepts, but for those that do I hope you will understand with I used the descriptor and made the claim in the post Title. Oh and did I say there would be numbers? Continued below the fold.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />The Trustees of Social Security sign off on a Annual Report of Social Security each year. I say &#8216;sign off&#8217; because the Report is not fundamentally their work product, although their top staff review and modify the ultimate conclusions the bulk of the Report is produced by the professional demographers and actuaries of the Social Security Office of the Chief Actuary, heretofore the OACT. Most people and about 99% of all reporters who even make an effort know the Report in the form of the <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TRSUM/index.html">Summary</a>. And indeed if you go the <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/pubs.html">Actuarial Publications</a> webpage this publication is the second to be served up. But the first is the full <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/2011/index.html">Annual Report of the Trustees</a> which adds just under 200 pages of data tables and explanatory text. And it is in those data tables that you begin to unravel the nature of the Trust Funds. </p>
<p>And this is where things get a little tedious. But necessary. The main table under discussion is <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/2011/VI_A_cyoper_hist.html#208231">Table VI.A2.— Operations of the OASI Trust Fund, Calendar Years 1937-2010 </a> Note first that this Table does not include the DI Trust Fund, those numbers and ones for combined OASDI are available down the page in Tables VI.A3 &#038; A4. This exclusion is necessary because DI has some complications of its own.</p>
<p>On inspection you will see by year Trust Fund operations reported under three categories: Income, Cost, and Assets. Assets are reported in three forms: Increase in Assets which is the annual surplus or deficit used for budget calculations, Amount at End of Year which is the total TF balance, and Trust Fund Ratio which is that balance expressed as a percentage of the next year&#8217;s cost with 100=1 year, in turn the official target. Income and Cost are reported as Totals and then sub-totals with all sources of Income less all incidence of Cost making up the Increase in Assets.</p>
<p>Income to the Trust Funds come in 4 forms, only three significant (at least prior to this year), Those three are Contributions or FICA tax collections, Tax on Benefits, and Interest. FICA taxes and Tax on Benefits represent actual cash money extracted from the economy while Interest in most years just comes as a credit from Treasury to the Trust Funds. This distinction will become very important later.</p>
<p>Cost equally comes in three forms being Benefit Payments which make up the vast bulk of expenditures, Administrative Costs and RRB Exchange. RRB is Railroad Retirement, a parallel and older retirement system to Social Security and one with reciprocal funding with Exchange being the net transfer. As you can see from the numbers not that important in current context. Administration too is insignificant, in fact for OAS it represents only 0.6% of cost as compared to the overall Admin cost of 0.9% for combined OASDI, since DI is a more expensive component proportionately though not absolutely. One of those &#8216;complications&#8217; alluded to above.</p>
<p>To the meat of the matter (or the tofu or brown rice as your diet would have it). If we examine 2010 for Increase in Assets we see a figure for positive $92.2 billion which as noted is the OAS surplus for budget calculations. &#8220;But, but, but the WaPo told me Social Security was in deficit for the first time since 1983!&#8221; Well they did and there are two reasonably valid, though ultimately confusing reasons. One they are focusing on cash flow only and not total Income and two they are reporting combined OAS+DI.</p>
<p>As to cash flow as noted above in most years in this Table interest simply comes to Social Security in the form of a credit. Only in those years where Income excluding Interest fails to exceed Cost does some or all of it come in the form of cash transfers. And only in those years when Income INCLUDING Interest trails cost is there an actual decrease in TF balances or in other words a cashing in of principal in the form of Special Treasuries. But back to cash flow. Determining it for any given year is simple, just subtract Interest from Increase in Assets. A positive remainder means cash flow in, a negative one cash flow out. And if we perform the exercise we see positive cash flow every year from 1936 to 1956. But also might note that this didn&#8217;t equate to gains in Trust Fund Ratios as such, while through the 40s those ratios ranged between 15 and 27 years of reserves in terms of the next year&#8217;s cost by 1956 this was down to under 4 years, and interestingly by this measure the same position we are in today.</p>
<p>Which brings up a point in passing. People who claim that the current &#8216;pre-funding&#8217; is unprecedented need to look at those numbers from the 40s. Instead of the popular picture of the first two generations of retirees/workers being pure parasites we see people who sent positive cash flow to the system ever year for twenty years and significantly pre-funded their own retirements.</p>
<p>And that pre-funding was needed. An examination of the numbers from 1956 to 1982 shows 14 years in which total balances shrank as Increase in Assets went negative but also additional years when actual cash flow was negative as well, for example 1971-1974 where Increase in Assets minus Interest also yields negative numbers. Meaning that Social Security was cash flow negative every year from 1971 to 1982. Again making hash of the argument that negative cash flows, as seen this year on a combined OASDI basis, are unprecedented. And also the accompanying claim that Social Security has &#8216;always&#8217; been Pay-Go. Well not unless you count interest and not even then in all cases.</p>
<p>But this is getting long. So I stuck &#8216;Part 1&#8217; in the title and will post this piece now with Part 2 coming right up. And in the interim maybe those interested can run through the numbers in the data tables.</p>

                                <p> By Daniel Becker
<div>This is a bit of an interlude in my writing regarding the income tax of yore. Though, this does involve taxation. This is also a continuation in my postings regarding real world small business experiences. Yes, you are going to get to read about a real situation that involves a real small business and tax policy.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Before I mislead anyone, the taxes of concern are not about income taxation. Your business has to actually have an income for that tax to matter. I&#8217;m not talking personal income. I&#8217;m not talking capital gains taxes. Darn few honest to goodness small businesses ever have to worry about that in their daily activities. Maybe in the end you will have some capital gains after you pay yourself back all the personal money you put into your small business. I&#8217;m not talking payroll taxes cuts. Yeah, on what was a $100,000 payroll you gain maybe a couple thousand dollars, but on what was a ½ million business that is now 55% of what it was with payroll adjusted to match, it means little. I mean, that business is sure going to be hiring new people with that!</div>
<div></div>
<div> Oh, just in case you think I&#8217;m off the mark, consider <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/145946/small-businesses-hiring-fewer-workers-needed.aspx">this poll from 11/10</a>.   In the poll, 90% hired what was needed or fewer than needed. The catch: Only 1% hired because of the a new tax break. 41% were to replace an employee. When asked why they hired fewer than needed: 79% worried that sales or revenue would not justify more employees. However, 13% did hire because business was better. The lucky ones. So go ahead, keep giving me tax cuts, blah, blah, blah and all that monetary relief because that US Chamber of Commerce sure represents my thoughts and desires. NOT! Idiots!</div>
<div></div>
<div>Some perspective <a href="http://web.sba.gov/faqs/faqindex.cfm?areaID=24">on small business.</a> </div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><p>“In 2009,there were 27.5 million businesses in the United States, according to Office of Advocacy estimates.The lastest available Census data show that there were 6.0 million firms with employees in 2007 and 21.4 million without employees in 2008. “</p></blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>I know it is soothing to croon over the days when the Dodge Brothers, Ford, Colt, Walton and Gates were small and became major examples for their time of the American Dream of economic power. But really, the truth is most small business were and are people earning a living on their own vs working for Microsoft (the definition of part time abuse) or Walmart or GM, or GE or Boeing&#8230; They were huge numbers of small local retail. All gone. Small local banks? Going. Small local agriculture (RI used to have a state fair), forget about it.  Look around.</div>
<div></div>
<div>So lets get to the heart of it. First a bright spot. The flower shop had it&#8217;s first month this year that was better than last year. August. No, I&#8217;m not assuming this is a trend and here is why.</div>
<p><a name="more"></a>
<div>The city of Woonsocket has lost it&#8217;s Walmart to the town of North Smithfield, it&#8217;s neighbor. Major tax hit to the city. N. Smithfield got the Walmart because it decided that building a 650K sq ft shopping development would offset their rising taxes. I mean really, when in the last 30 years have we seen big business pay enough in taxes such that they actually were paying for their presence? Cut, cut, cut has been their chant. So, I can expect my property and inventory taxes to rise unless something replaces that Walmart. Say the state stepping up. Which tends to happen via the state giving less to the towns like North Smithfield.</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>I wrote about this type of tax chasing in <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2007/03/divorced-one-like-bush-on-property.html">one of my first posts</a>. </div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><p>“You know what is missing in this discussion (a discussion happening in every town USA)? The question: Compared to what? What are we basing the above statements on? Is it simply that we have less money after the bills are paid? Well, from 1955 to 1998, GDP rose by a factor of 20. Tax burden as a percent of income rose by a factor of 26.7. But income for a family of 4, 2 people working (sound familiar) only rose by a factor of 11.5. From 1976 to 2001 the top 1 % share of income went from 8.6 % to 21%. Yes, we have less money at the end of the day. Unfortunately, not benefiting from the national wealth as we had in 1955 (when the tax burden was 18% of your pay and would be today if all was equal) is a national policy issue.”</p></blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>This is the issue of small business. See, we are all just trying to earn an income. Just like the person who works for the multinational. The income is much less because business sales are down. So, how should I plan for the pending tax rise? Do not just give me an answer that involves further big business moving into the area, because as I showed in the post on property taxes and development, it&#8217;s not so simple as welcoming Mr and Mrs. big business into the neighborhood. </div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><p>“But, for my purposes Smithfield (an abutting town) presented the most interesting data. They had a new retail development go in, but ½ the size of that proposed for my town. It&#8217;s citizens have seen since 1999 in sequence a 9.8, 4, re-val, 5.5 and 8.7 percent rise in the tax rate. It&#8217;s commercial development has been only 10% industrial. My town only had a 6.4% total rise in the same time span.”</p></blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>Oh save me great god of the mega corporations from the evils of local taxation. Yeah, I didn&#8217;t think praying would work.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Next up involves a CVS move. CVS is headquartered in Woonsocket. It obviously has some new hot shot who has a better way. They are looking to own their stores and not lease. They are consolidating 2 stores into one bigger store on new property. Yes, about ½ the property was zoned commercial, the other ½ was residential (real houses on it) turned commercial. This is important, because the CVS consolidation will leave 2 existing commercial spaces empty. We&#8217;ll add them to the Walmart space and potentially the Lowe&#8217;s space as it is suppose to be moving to the new North Smithfield development which is built on what was 126 acres of woods. </div>
<div></div>
<div>Sticking with Woonsocket, the location of my flower shop, the city has managed to add to its commercial property stock while turning a good portion of it into none productive commercial property stock. How soon do you think those empty places will fill up? Don&#8217;t hold your breath.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Some more good news. I managed to cut a major expense for the shop just this June to the tune of $379/month. We were in a unique position in that they kind of needed us. It&#8217;s not going to happen again. $4548 per year. Nice. It&#8217;s the heating expense for a year assuming the speculators don&#8217;t get active again. Yep, get rid of those government regulations as they sure are doing me harm. NOT!</div>
<div></div>
<div>The plaza that one of the CVS stores is moving out of is a customer of ours. We do seasonal decorating for them. It is about $3900/yr. Well, we&#8217;re not decorating with mums this fall and Christmas looks to be out too. How much you wanna bet spring next year and for some years to come is out? Gonna bet enough to do Washington a favor and higher someone?</div>
<div></div>
<div>Are you seeing where all this is going? I saved us some big coin. I&#8217;m loosing the same amount. Now, this is not the first hit from a CVS decision. Some other person there decided to make it simple for them to pay for their flower needs by going with Pro Flowers instead of feeding the 4 local florists which they had done for decades. They think they are getting a 20% discount from Pro Flowers. Little  </div>
<div>do they understand the flower business. Not the first time mega corps thought they new more than the little guy. It represented about 2.4% of our business at the time. May not sound like a lot, but when you consider the extra business generated by CVS using one&#8217;s shop to send flowers, it becomes significant. </div>
<div></div>
<div>Let&#8217;s add a third issue. Refi. Time to take advantage of the low rates. The purpose is to improve, that is reduce your monthly cash outlays. But as any real small businesses owner learns, there is no such thing as a fixed rate. We have paid off 22.2% of the loan that combined the original purchase of the business and property with the rehab that needed to be done in 2004. We have about 36% of the tax appraised value in equity of the property. </div>
<div></div>
<div>Here&#8217;s the concern, do you take a 20 yr loan with a rate of between 5 to 5.5% to be reset in 5 years or do you take 6 to 6.5% to be reset in 10 yrs? Do I bet that in 5 years business is better because the economy is better which could also mean all that projected inflation do to the Fed monetary policy and at least protect my self for 10 yrs? Or do I bet that nothing will be much better and try to preserve my cash flow (in a small business it&#8217;s always about cash flow, accrual be damn) and go for the 5% figuring the Fed money flood won&#8217;t roost for at least another 5 yrs? Oh, the refi cost are going to run you about $4000. There goes that big saving from my hard nosed negotiations again. </div>
<div></div>
<div>Your facing tax increases beyond the usual but, not because the public employees are paid too much. Your running out of area&#8217;s to cut. Major corporation moves are working against you just as off shoring is working against the middle class, the very class of your concern as you are in it and draw your income from it. And all the policy talk being pushed has little to do with the issues that you are facing because the number one issue you are facing is <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/01/i-got-your-real-state-of-union-right.html">a lack of a middle class</a>. </div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>Have you heard of the “hourglass strategy”? Look it up. Ah, no it&#8217;s not a strategy you can use, but is one that will work against you.</div>

<p>I am very suspicious of proposals that the Fed do more to save the economy which do not specify what.  They seem to be based on the idea that expanding Fed liabilities would be useful no matter what assets the Fed buys.  I am convinced that Fed purchases are useful if and only if the Fed purchases assets which private investors fear.  I think the QEII experiment supports this view.</p>
<p>Investors fear Greek government bonds.  The Fed certainly has the legal authority to buy foreign treasury securities.  It can save Greece any day it pleases.  This would be good for the USA, because it reduces the risk of another world financial crisis.</p>
<p>There is no chance that the Fed will do this.  I don&#8217;t know why ?</p>

                                <p>by <strong><a href="http://presimetrics.com/">Mike Kimel</a></strong></p>
<p>Following a merger, a few months ago I took a severance package from my most recent employer.  Put another way, I became unemployed.  I started looking for another job but without much luck. In the last few weeks, I&#8217;ve also started doing some consulting work with two clients.  Its been sporadic but lucrative, and I&#8217;m trying to figure out how to ramp that up quickly.  Having been a consultant before for eight years, I know the tough thing is always maintaining a strong enough stable of clients.  (FYI, the work I&#8217;ve been doing has been economic analysis, business analytics, and litigation support.  If you or anyone needs that sort of a skillset, drop me a line at &#8220;mike&#8221; period &#8220;kimel&#8221; at &#8220;gmail.com.&#8221;)  Fortunately, in addition to the consulting, we have some other income coming in and a fair amount saved up, so I don&#8217;t need to get 100 mph immediately.</p>
<p>One of the drawbacks of being unemployed or an independent consultant involves health insurance.  When I left my employer, I became eligible for COBRA.  Here&#8217;s my ongoing COBRA story.  I&#8217;m going to change all names to protect the guilty and innocent alike.  Call my former employer A, the COBRA administrator they use B, and my insurance company C.</p>
<p>A few weeks after I took the severance, A informed B that I was no longer with the company and thus eligible for COBRA.  I had been checking B&#8217;s website religiously because I&#8217;m kind of paranoid about lacking health insurance.  So one day, I logged on and found that I was eligible.  But there was a small problem &#8211; somewhere along the line, I had lost my dependents.  So I called B, B called A, some other stuff happened in the background, a day or two went by, and when I logged in, lo and behold, my wife was now listed as a dependent.  But there was a small problem &#8211; I also happen to have a (at the time) thirteen month old son.  So I called B, B called A, some other stuff happened in the background, a day or two went by, and when I logged in, lo and behold, my son was now listed as a dependent.   But there was a small problem &#8211; neither of my dependents was listed as having been on my insurance policies when I was employed, thus making them ineligible for COBRA coverage.  So I called B, B called A, some other stuff happened in the background, and when I logged in, lo and behold, my wife was listed as having been on my health insurance.  But there was a small problem &#8211; my son was not listed as having had health insurance, making him ineligible for COBRA.  So I called B, B called A, some other stuff happened in the background, and when I logged in, lo and behold,  both my dependents were listed as having been on my health insurance policy when I was employed.  But there was a small problem &#8211; it seems that the records provided indicated that I had two spouses and no son.  One of my two spouses, interestingly enough, had the same name, birthday and gender as my now non-existent son.  The records, in other words, indicated that I personally was violating a nontrivial number of laws. So I called B, B called A, some other stuff happened in the background, and when I logged in, lo and behold, well, I couldn&#8217;t find the mistake in the records.  So I signed up for COBRA, and I put us on direct payment from my bank account.</p>
<p>All&#8217;s well that ends well, no matter how much time is wasted.  But I did mention that my insurance company, C, was going to be a part of the story, right?  Today a letter comes in the mail.  My wife had gone to a dermatologist.  The dermatologist submitted the bill to C.  C informed the dermatologist that we no longer had coverage.  </p>
<p>So I called B.  It was a lovely conversation.  I was informed that, yes, they have been withdrawing money from my account, and yes, I am paid in full, but nevertheless, C&#8217;s records do show us having no coverage.  I was told B is calling C.  I was told that in 24 to 48 hours I need to call C to see if they listed us as having the insurance coverage for which I have been paying.  At some later point my wife or I will also have to call the dermatologist.  Call me cynical, but I expect this is going to take a lot of time and interfere with my ability to generate income.  </p>
<p>As an aside, in the past few weeks we&#8217;ve started looking at new insurance options. Interestingly enough, it seems that if everyone in the family is generally healthy, COBRA is generally not the best option.</p>

<p>&#8230;. to keep mom/dad alive.</p>
<p>Physicians and nurses often dread these conversations. Any of us who have been on the family side of this know how agonizing it can be.</p>
<p>And I know even mentioning this can cause a firestorm.</p>
<p>However, there are some unsettling issues raised by these conversations, issues that are a sort of third rail of health care (and no there are no proposed death panels).</p>
<p>First, does this attitude increase suffering? Many of the elderly have 4 &#8211; 10 major diagnosis (COPD, CHF, PAD, diabetes, a-fib, etc. etc.) and very little quality of life. Especially problematic is the ping-pong that often occurs between the hospital and the nursing home (families often see a transfer to the hospital as a magic bullet, physicians often give in).</p>
<p>Second, Medicare is paying for a great deal of hospital care that may have very little value.</p>
<p>No one wants the government making these decisions, but at some point the care is futile and often painful. Some patients and families deal with these issues well, others do not.</p>
<p>For my part, I have a health care POA, a living will, and everybody in the family knows the course of action I want in various situations. Ditto for Mrs. R. It is still tough though.</p>

On a year-over-year basis real average hourly and weekly earnings are down -2.4%.</p>
<p>With real wages falling so steeply no wonder the retail sales report was weaker than expected.<br />I continue to stick with my position that with wage growth so weak the economy can not sustain accelerating inflation.  Higher inflation will lead to a weaker economy, not an inflationary spiral.</p>

<p><strong>Speaking Engagement</strong></p>
<p>If anyone is in the Akron, Ohio area and has any interest, I will be giving a guest lecture at David Cohen&#8217;s American Presidency class on Monday Sept. 19. The class runs from 12:05-12:55 in Leigh Hall 510.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be talking about <strong><em>Presimetrics</em></strong>, the book I co-authored with Michael Kanell.  I&#8217;ve prepared a few slides which I&#8217;ll make into a post after the lecture.</p>

<p>I present some basic statistics to highlight the problem in Europe. In short, there exists a deleterious positive feedback loop between overly leveraged banks and their sovereigns in key markets.</p>
<p>Exhibit 1: European Banks are overly levered. Spanning 2006 through the latest data point, key European banking systems &#8211; France, Germany, and Italy &#8211; increased leverage.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-po8bdUAaJt0/Tm6X9RXpxJI/AAAAAAAAD7o/60EU56tICYY/s1600/bank_leverage.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-po8bdUAaJt0/Tm6X9RXpxJI/AAAAAAAAD7o/60EU56tICYY/s400/bank_leverage.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>The chart above illustrates the ratio of bank assets to capital (see the <a href="http://fsi.imf.org/">IMF&#8217;s Financial Soundness Indicators</a> for the data and description of &#8216;capital&#8217;). The countries are ranked by largest % drop in bank leverage spanning the period 2006 to current (Greece, Austria, and Belgium) to the largest % surge in leverage spanning the same period (France, Italy, and the UK). Note: the 2006 data is taken from the <a href="http://www.imf.org/External/Pubs/FT/GFSR/2007/02/pdf/statappx.pdf">2007 IMF Global Financial Stability Report</a>.</p>
<p>The level of leverage is not strictly comparable across countries due to differences in national accounting, taxation, and supervisory regimes. However, while the US banks have delevered over the period, the big European banks &#8211; Germany, Italy, and France &#8211; have increased leverage. Assets need to be written down.<br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Exhibit 2. While leverage is too high, asset quality is dropping. The banks are increasing exposure to government loans and securities relative to traditional loans.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-VYxTd40z7os/Tm6Y_IwXJGI/AAAAAAAAD7w/kbjlZxYz3Tk/s1600/asset_quality_chart.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-VYxTd40z7os/Tm6Y_IwXJGI/AAAAAAAAD7w/kbjlZxYz3Tk/s400/asset_quality_chart.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>The chart illustrates the nominal stock of loans held on the bank balance sheets of the Monetary Financial Institutions in Europe. The data are <a href="http://sdw.ecb.europa.eu/browse.do?node=2116074">from the ECB</a>. Loans to governments and holdings of government securities are increasing more swiftly than traditional lending.</p>
<p>Exhibit 3. The asset quality of that rising stock of loans to the government sector is deteriorating&#8230;quickly. Italian and Spanish 10yr bonds are 1.5% and 1.2% higher, respectively, since the beginning of 2010, while German 10-yr yields are 1.5% lower.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-hpfo0_BAgWk/Tm6d8tDEF8I/AAAAAAAAD8A/UCK3jWTFe3M/s1600/bond_yields_chart.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-hpfo0_BAgWk/Tm6d8tDEF8I/AAAAAAAAD8A/UCK3jWTFe3M/s400/bond_yields_chart.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a> The chart illustrates the 10-yr bonds across the euro area bond markets. The latest data point (today around 12pm) is listed in the legend.</p>
<p>Bond investors are clearly differentiating between the riskier bonds &#8211; Spain, Portugal, and Belgium &#8211; from the &#8216;core&#8217; &#8211; Germany, Netherlands, Austria, Finland, and yes, France. Whether or not bond markets are right to regard Finland or France as &#8216;core&#8217; is a different matter entirely. But the point is clear: bond markets are in crisis mode, and there&#8217;s a stark segmentation in yields across the region.</p>
<p>Cross border exposure dictates that some of these highly levered banking systems are exposed to the same government securities currently trading at distressed levels. A case in point is France with outsized exposure to Italy and Greece (see <a href="http://www.bis.org/statistics/consstats.htm">Table 9B</a>).
