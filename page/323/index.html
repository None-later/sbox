<p><strong>Recessions, Part 3: The Aftermath</strong><br />This post looks at the length &#038; severity of a recession and compares those factors to the length &#038; speed of the previous recession. Data on the length of the recession, in months, comes from the <a href="http://www.nber.org/cycles/cyclesmain.html">NBER</a>, and data on real GDP per capita (the measure of growth and shrinkage used in this post) comes from <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/TableView.asp?SelectedTable=264&#038;Freq=Qtr&#038;FirstYear=2008&#038;LastYear=2010">the BEA</a>. As noted in the second post in the series (link below), real GDP per capita data &#8220;is available annually from 1929 to 1946 and quarterly thereafter. I did no smoothing &#8211; that is to say&#8230; for an event that occurred in January, February, or March of 2001, as an example, I used figures for Q1 of 2001.&#8221;</p>
<p>With that, let&#8217;s go. Figure 1 below shows the annualized shrinkage during a recession v. the length of the following expansion (in months).</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/S-lK8zhMQvI/AAAAAAAAAHs/026Lc2INiaU/s1600/mike1.bmp"><img border="0" alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/S-lK8zhMQvI/AAAAAAAAAHs/026Lc2INiaU/s320/mike1.bmp"></a><br />Figure 1.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />No obvious relationship, right. But check out Figure 2, which shows the annualized shrinkage during a recession v. the speed of the following expansion.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/S-lK9AjGqZI/AAAAAAAAAH0/qfi8ATZ4wec/s1600/mike2.bmp"><img border="0" alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/S-lK9AjGqZI/AAAAAAAAAH0/qfi8ATZ4wec/s320/mike2.bmp"></a><br />Figure 2.</p>
<p>Well&#8230;. this seems a bit less unambiguous&#8230; in general, the faster the drop, the faster the growth that follows. In general.</p>
<p>Does that suggest rapid growth for us now, what with the Great Recession and all? Actually, no. On an annualized basis, the Great Recession produced only the seventh fastest decline among the 14 recessions that begin with the monster of 1929. What made the Great Recession so awful was its length &#8211; it was the longest downturn since the Great Depression. Interestingly, of the only two that were comparable in length &#8211; one came a few years after big decreases to the marginal tax rate (the recession that began in &#8217;73) and one came the year big cuts to the marginal rate were announced (the recession that began in &#8217;81). It would appear that the only big decrease in marginal tax rates that didn&#8217;t have a very lengthy recession hanging around them happened in 1964. Nobody is saying recessions are caused by tax cuts&#8230; but one wonders why tax cutting goodness isn&#8217;t a bit better at eliminating the problem.</p>
<p>But I digress&#8230; so back to the grind. The next graph shows the length of recessions v. the length of the following expansions.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/S-lK9VTR8II/AAAAAAAAAH8/sgA1fpdrSIM/s1600/mike3.bmp"><img border="0" alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/S-lK9VTR8II/AAAAAAAAAH8/sgA1fpdrSIM/s320/mike3.bmp"></a><br />Figure 3</p>
<p>Again&#8230; no clear relationship.</p>
<p>But, there seems a relationship between the length of a recession and the rate of growth during the subsequent recovery.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/S-lK94hTRLI/AAAAAAAAAIE/BA5yK90v114/s1600/mike4.bmp"><img border="0" alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/S-lK94hTRLI/AAAAAAAAAIE/BA5yK90v114/s320/mike4.bmp"></a><br />Figure 4</p>
<p>It seems that in general, longer recessions are associated with faster recoveries. And this does, hopefully, portend good things for the current expansion. No guarantee, of course, but we can all keep our fingers crossed.</p>
<p>Kind of as an aside, in the last post on this topic, reader K Harris asked whether any of this recession analysis can shed any light on the Great Moderation. And to be honest, I&#8217;m not sure. Assuming the GM began after the early 80s recession, and ran until the start of the most recent disaster, it was a period with two short, relatively mild recessions. During the expansions, growth was pretty good in stretches (pieces of the Reagan and Clinton administrations) and frankly, pretty lousy (most of the Bush and Bush administrations). I wonder whether perhaps the automatic stabilizers and Fed policy (Reagan and Bush 2 were the beneficiaries of some serious real M1 per capita growth) helped prevent periods in which there wasn&#8217;t much of an expansion from dipping into recessions. I dunno. Thoughts?</p>

                                <p><a href="http://econospeak.blogspot.com/2010/05/european-economics-at-crossroads.html">Barkley Rosser announces his new book</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I am pleased to announce the publication of my book with David Colander and Richard Holt, <em>European Economics at a Crossroads</em>, being issued in both hardcover and paper back simultaneously from Edward Elgar. Several years in the producing, this book is the sequel to our 2004, <em>The Changing Face of Economics: Conversations with Cutting Edge Economists</em>, which created a bit of a stir by arguing for the possible existence of &#8220;non-orthodox mainstream&#8221; economists, with someone like George Akerlof being an example of this peculiar breed. We also argued strongly for viewing the economics profession and intellectual development as being a complex adaptive process.</p></blockquote>
<p>Prof. Rosser also had  <a target="_blank" href="http://econospeak.blogspot.com/2010/05/europe-must-rewrite-social-contract-as.html">this to say about Europe and reporting</a> Tues. May 11 at Econospeak:</p>
<blockquote><p>Yep, there it is, the subheadline under &#8220;A new reality for the old world&#8221; for an upper left-hand corner, front page story by Howard Schneider on the front page of today&#8217;s Washington Post. Wow. Except that this is one of the most distorted and off-the-wall headlines to appear in such a place in a long time, with the obvious agenda of wanting to say the same for the US (time for that deficit commission to cut social security anyone?).</p>
<p>What is true is that for a country (e.g only Greece so far) to borrow from the newly established fund, put up by EU countries and the IMF and backed by the ECB, with a further backing by the US Fed, which has reopened its closed-down currency swap lines, it must engage in serious budget deficit reduction. Quite likely that will involve both spending cuts and tax increases, as have been voted for now by the Greek parliament, despite the riots in the streets by opponents of this.</p>
<p>However, let us be clear. First of all, this is not at all a statement or policy about &#8220;Europe&#8221; as a whole at all, much less social contracts in general. As of 2006 Greece had a lower percentage of GDP going to social spending (24.2%) than the EU average (26.9%). Countries with the highest percentages include some that have much less severe budget deficit problems, e.g. Germany, Sweden, France, Austria, the Netherlands. This is a problem of tax collections and corruption and underground economies, not of an out-of-control &#8220;social contract.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/">Coal Combustion Residuals</a>, often referred to as coal ash, are currently considered exempt wastes under an amendment to RCRA, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.    They are residues from the combustion of coal in power plants and captured by pollution control technologies, like scrubbers. Potential environmental concerns from coal ash pertain to pollution from impoundment and landfills leaching into ground water and structural failures of impoundments, like that which occurred at the Tennessee Valley Authority’s plant in Kingston, Tennessee. The need for national management criteria was emphasized by the December 2008 spill of CCRs from a surface impoundment near Kingston, TN. The tragic spill flooded more than 300 acres of land with CCRs and flowed into the Emory and Clinch rivers.<br />EPA is proposing to regulate for the first time coal ash to address the risks from the disposal of the wastes generated by electric utilities and independent power producers.  EPA is considering two possible options for the management of coal ash for public comment. Both options fall under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). Under the first proposal, EPA would list these residuals as special wastes subject to regulation under subtitle C of RCRA, when destined for disposal in landfills or surface impoundments. Under the second proposal, EPA would regulate coal ash under subtitle D of RCRA, the section for non-hazardous wastes.     The Agency considers each proposal to have its advantages and disadvantages, and includes benefits which should be considered in the public comment period.   </p>

                                <p>“Liquidity” is another magic word.  I like it rather less than <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/05/friction-non-socratic-dialogue.html">“friction.”  </a>In the debate on financial regulatory reform opponents of tight regulations use the word liquidity as a magic spell which, they hope, will make all inconvenient evidence and arguments go away (no links my claim is like saying the Sun emits light).   The word is used with different meanings.  Sometimes it refers to something which is definitely good, sometimes it refers to the effects of structured finance.  This is an equivocation.</p>
<p>It wasn’t always this way.  Like “friction,” “liquidity” has been used for purposes other than special pleading and obfuscation.   I don’t know the history of the word, so I will start with a definition (which may not be the oldest definition) and explain how the word lost all useful meaning through over use.   As with “friction”  I think a good practical rule is to demand that anyone who makes an argument including the word “liquidity” be asked to rephrase it without using that word.  </p>
<p>Long long post after the jump.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>First money is liquid.  Money is any asset which can be used to buy anything or pay and debt right now.  Other assets are more or less liquid depending on how quickly they can be converted into money and how much that operation costs.   One definition of liquidity (the only one which I accept) is the cost of a round trip money to the asset to money divided by the price of the asset.   </p>
<p>When we describe the liquidity of an asset as a property of the asset, we are making a very strong totally false assumption.  We assume that the proportional cost of the round trip is constant and does not depend on the amount of the asset purchased then sold.  Of course this is nonsense.   For extremely small purchases, the cost of a round trip is very high.  Much more importantly the round trip costs of extremely large purchases can be much higher than the round trip costs of medium size purchases.  An extremely large buy order drives prices up and an extremely large sell order drives prices down.  It is this problem and no other which is being discussed basically every time a financier uses the word liquidity.    They call an asset liquid when huge positions can be taken and unwound with low round trip costs.   This sort of liquidity – large transaction liquidity – is not directly valuable to me or to 99.9% of people.  </p>
<p>The main point of this post is to object to the equation of round trip costs for medium size round trips and huge round trips.   However, the abuse of language is much worse.  A third meaning of liquidity is the money supply.  This is the sense in which Central banks are said to inject and remove liquidity via open market operations.  Here “liquidity” means “liquid assets.”  I don’t think this abuse of English is dangerous.  It is just very mildly irritating.</p>
<p>However, and much more importantly, “liquidity”  is also used to mean free cash flow.  It is in this sense that people distinguish between an illiquid firm (which can be profitably rescued with a loan) and an insolvent firm (which can’t).   The claim is that the problem for an illiquid firm is that its assets can’t be converted into money.</p>
<p>This is clearly a false statement.   Nowadays all assets can be sold.  Even in the past, firms could issue new shares.   The problem for an illiquid firm (with this 4th meaning of liquidity) is that no one wants to buy its assets.  The claim of the manager that her firm is illiquid is a claim that the asset prices are different from fundamental values.</p>
<p>The assets can be sold (as shares of the firm if need be) but people would not pay enough to cover the firm’s liabilities.   This is not because the instrument called the public offering of shares doesn’t exist.  It is because they don’t believe the assets are worth that much.  The claim of illiquidity not insolvency always is the claim that investors are wrong about fundamental values.   It hasn’t been a statement about available financial instruments since the invention of the joint stock limited liability company.   </p>
<p>It doesn’t matter if the firm’s effort to liquidate its assets would drive prices down or if prices are already low.  What matters is that the firm can’t get enough money for its assets to pay its debts.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this post, the point is that, other things equal, we would like firms to have a huge free cash flow.  Using “liquidity” to refer to free cash flow gives the word positive connotations.  The implicit suggestion is that market institutions such that huge round trips have low proportional costs will improve the cash flow of all firms.   This suggestion comes close to being an explicit argument when the same person describes the recent crisis as a liquidity crisis and says that tighter regulations will reduce liquidity.</p>
<p>A fifth meaning of “liquidity” is “market thickness”  or “trading volume.”  I’m fairly sure the word originally described assets.  Now it is often used to modify markets so thick markets are called “liquid markets.”  This is actually fairly important, since market thickness is key to making the round trip costs of taking and unwinding a large position low.   If I own 100 shares of IBM, the amount of money I can get for them depends almost not at all on trading volume the day I sell.   A minuscule fraction of current market volume would be enough that I don’t drive the price down by dumping 100 shares.</p>
<p>The identification of round trip costs for huge and medium round trips leads many people to consider high trading volume socially desirable.   Just try to imagine an explanation of why high trading volume is useful to someone who buys corporate bonds to save for her retirement or pay her children’s college tuition or buy a house.  It is just assumed that market participants frequently take and unwind huge positions.   The implicit assumption is that we should regulate so that the properties of the market please active traders.   Most people do not believe that active traders are socially useful.  The ambiguity of the word liquidity enables them to argue that the market should be designed for their convenience without their having to defend their claim to be socially useful.</p>
<p>Now an analogy – poker.   The thing that smart professional poker players want most is not so smart poker players (fish, suckers etc).  They want people who bet incorrectly so that they can take our money (they haven’t gotten any from me).  Now, what about the smart traders who want liquid markets?  Their view of the way markets should be is that, when they decide that an asset is underpriced, they can buy a whole lot of it at that too low price and, when they decide that an asset is overpriced, they can sell a whole lot of it at that too high price.   I can see why they think this is good for them (I think they are often wrong, because they don’t have rational expectations).  I can’t see why we should feel obliged to supply them with plenty of fish.</p>
<p>OK an example.  &#8220;The RMBS based CDO market became very illiquid in 2008.&#8221;  This sounds like a safe claim.  The fact is that the volume of trading of RMBS CDOs collapsed so the market became thin.  A market can be thin if everyone agrees on the fundamental value of assets and is pleased with their current portfolio.   This was not the case in 2008.  Many firms were very eager to get the CDOs off their books and no one had a clue what they were worth.  A market can be thin as it is perceived to be very risky so everyone likes to hold zero of the asset.   This was not the case in 2008.  Net holdings of RMBS base CDOs were not zero.  Many firms and individuals owned them and felt that they were bearing risk.  They would have liked to reduce their holdings.  </p>
<p>I think it is clear why the market was thin.  The market clearing price was much lower than it had recently been.   Very few  wanted to buy at any price higher than this market clearing price, but the owners of the CDOs weren’t willing to sell at the market price, because then they would have had to book the losses.  The market seized up, because it was necessary for it to seize up to neutralize mark to market accounting.  Here as in the case of the allegedly illiquid firm the problem isn’t that the assets were illiquid, the problem was that their market price was so low that firms couldn’t cover their liabilities by selling the assets.</p>
<p>Having no respect at all for the efficient markets hypothesis, I am perfectly prepared to believe that this was an irrational panic and that many firms could profitably be saved by an emergency loan.  It is not very bold to type that now, but at the time, I thought that the cost of a well designed TARP to the Treasury would be huge and negative – that the US Treasury had a huge gigantic profit opportunity.   </p>
<p>This opportunity was largely wasted.  My understanding is that the Treasury now guesses that it plus the Fed will make money saving banks (I count making good AIG fp obligations part of saving the banks).  Not enough to cover the losses from saving GM Chrystler, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac but quite enough to make it impossible for any semi-sane person to take the EMH seriously (of course I think no semi-sane person ever took the EMH seriously and I strongly suspect that Eugene Fama is semi-sane).</p>
<p>Well here we are finally at the end of an overlong post.  My conclusion is that the debate on financial reform is seriously endangered because of a gross equivocation.  It is insinuated that so long as trading volume is high, all firms will have an excellent cash flow.  It is almost stated that extremely high trading volume is useful to savers and small investors.  It is assumed that the problem in 2008 was that markets stopped working in a way pleasing to active traders who think that they can beat the market.</p>

                                <p>by Linda Beale<br />crossposted at <a target="_blank" href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/">Ataxingmatter</a></p>
<p><strong>Carried Interest: prospects?</strong></p>
<p>At the ABA Tax Section meeting in Washington last weekend, there was surprisingly little talk about the carried interest proposal.  Carried interest, for those who don&#8217;t work often in the partnership area, is the way that managers of real estate, hedge, and equity partnerships receive a generous payment for managing the fund&#8211;usually a &#8220;2 and 20&#8221; 2% of the assets under management annually and 20% of profits fee for services.  The 20% is claimed to be gains from asset dispositions rather than services (providing a preferential rate in some cases, as well as no payroll taxation) and often has been deferred through offshoring.</p>
<p>Various tax experts have called for taxing both the fee and carried interest as ordinary compensation subject to payroll taxes and always taxable at ordinary rates.  That proposal has been suggested in Congress at various times as a revenue raiser, but it has not yet been enacted as part of a bill, since the Senate has not included the House-passed version.  The Real Estate Roundtable has lobbied strenuously against the carried interest provision in past years and successfully joined with private equity, hedge fund, and venture capital firms to defeat the idea.</p>
<p>There is talk now of including it in the jobs bill that Congress hopes to pass before the end of May.  See Real Estate Group PUshes to Soften &#8216;Carried Interest&#8217; Tax Rise, Bloomberg, May 8, 2010.  Naturally, lobbyists are busy trying to eliminate or modify the provision.  The head of the Real Estate Roundtable noted that the group is arguing for a &#8220;blended&#8221; tax rate that would provide a rate between the capital gains preference and ordinary rates, or a provision that would apply the capital gains rates for gains from investments that the partnership holds for at least 2 years.  A spokesperson for the National Venture Capital Association siad that &#8220;we&#8217;re not accepting this as a fait accompli&#8230;we have not waived from our position.&#8221;  Id.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />The argument for taxing the carried interest of &#8220;profits&#8221; partners as compensation income, however, is strong: there is little justification for further complicating the Code with blended rates or a new long-term holding period for the capital gains rate.  These managers should pay tax at ordinary rates and should also be liable for the ordinary payroll taxes on their full compensation income.  Sure, they won&#8217;t like it and they &#8220;won&#8217;t waiver&#8221; from trying to push the Senate to ensure their cozy deal.  But that is not a satisfactory argument for failing to make this change which is required for fairness&#8217; sake.</p>

We have a &#8216;war on drugs&#8217; and a &#8216;war on terrorism&#8217;.  Both involve specific policies and specific agencies, not the aid of Captain America and Ironman who are restrained good guy superheroes to keep us safe.</p>
<p>Please tell me&#8230;why are Miranda rights the focus here as a key issue?  That appears to be inaccurate as a trigger issue.  And why is any notion of indefinite detention of a US citizen on the table except as an massive expansion of bigger government?</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://lieberman.senate.gov/assets/pdf/TEA_full.pdf">Mr. LIEBERMAN (for himself and Mr. BROWN</a> of Massachusetts) introduced<br />the following bill; which was read twice and referred to the Committee:</p>
<p>Lieberman seized on renewed fears of a terrorist attack to announce his latest legislative gambit: the &#8220;Terrorism Expatriation Act&#8221; &#8212; or &#8220;TEA&#8221; &#8212; which would revoke the citizenship of any American &#8220;who is found to be involved with a foreign terrorist organization as designated by the State Department.&#8221;</p>
<p>The measure came less than two months after Lieberman&#8217;s introduction, with Sen. John McCain, of another radical bill: The &#8220;Enemy Belligerent, Interrogation, Detention, and Prosecution Act of 2010,&#8221; which would grant the president the power to order the arrest, interrogation, and imprisonment of anyone &#8212; including a U.S. citizen &#8212; indefinitely, on the sole suspicion that he or she is affiliated with terrorism, and on the president&#8217;s sole authority as commander in chief. Lieberman&#8217;s new bill is an offshoot of the same principle, circumventing the Constitutional guarantees of due process for U.S. citizens by conveniently </p>
<p>
<blockquote>Two key Republicans and New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg were at odds today over how far the federal government should go to withhold the legal rights of U.S. citizens suspected of plotting terrorist acts.</p>
<p>Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said he wants to devise a law that would help law enforcement officials detain and interrogate citizens suspected of helping terrorist organizations or carrying out a terrorist act.</p>
<p>Graham said he would envision creating a special court similar to that of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court for electronic surveillance. Law enforcement officials could appear before a judge of the special court to get permission to withhold rights from a citizen while they are interrogated.</p>
<p>Graham said he believed the constitutionality of such a system would be upheld.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t imagine the Supreme Court of the United States saying that the homeland is not part of the battlefield,&#8221; Graham said, speaking during a Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee hearing.</p>
<p>House Homeland Security ranking member Peter King, who testified at the hearing, said he agreed with Graham. &#8220;We have to expect more attacks from those already in this country,&#8221; King said.</p>
<p>He said he wanted to create a separate category of citizens who are deemed enemy combatants.</p>
<p>Graham and King said they were particularly concerned that law enforcement officials might give Miranda rights to a citizen before all the possible intelligence can be collected about terrorist plots believed to be linked to that person.</p></blockquote>
<p>Eric Holder appears to be considering some sort of expansion of exceptions to the Miranda rule, eventhough I have seen no examples in the media where such an expansion of the rule was needed.  I have read opinion is mixed in the lower federal courts.</p>

<p><strong>Self-defeating Regulations</strong></p>
<p>The Obama administration has made a major commitment to the installation and use of electronics in U.S. medical records.</p>
<p>Obama sees electronic medical records (EMRs) linked into electronic health record (EHRs) networks as a major factor in controlling costs and improving quality in the U.S. health care system.</p>
<p>The administration put money behind the thinking, ARRA ’09 (commonly known as the stimulus act) includes significant funds for physician groups and hospitals to purchase and implement EMRs in the next several years. There are penalties for providers not on board within five (5) years.</p>
<p>In order to qualify providers have to buy “certified” systems and engage in “meaningful use” of those systems. (Most providers will select the Medicare track, others (pediatricians) will select the Medicaid option).</p>
<p>And therein lies a huge problem.</p>
<p>The statute directed the various bureaucracies to write implementing regulations for the certification and meaningful use of EMRs and EHRs. The recently published draft regulations are (not surprisingly) long and wildly complex. Make that very long and very wildly complex.</p>
<p> I have been asked by a major health care association to prepare a monograph as a guide for physician groups working to meet these standards, so have been wading through nearly a thousand pages of new regulatory matter.</p>
<p>Keep in mind we currently have a plethora of medical record systems ranging from purely handwritten to dictated and transcribed to partial EMRs to full blown EMRs.</p>
<p>My preliminary conclusion:<br />1) many physician practices, especially those with 5 physicians or less, will not be able to comply<br />2) those practices able to comply will probably not get a positive return on investment (ROI) even with federal funds (practice disruption, training time, system support, etc. are all expensive)<br />3) some hospitals will be able to fully comply, some partially, some will struggle</p>
<p>(Conspiracy theorists may conclude the Obama administration is trying to drive physicians into larger groups, hospital based MSOs and/or Integrated delivery systems.)</p>
<p>My overall conclusion, the program is so complex and the requirements so complicated the overall objectives of the program will not be achieved. Many billions will be spent for some progress, but not the progress desired by the administration.</p>

Larry Bartels&#8217; key graph mapping income growth by quintile, 1948-2005 (from page 33 of Unequal Democracy) is perhaps the best demonstration of that. Even the rich get richer, faster, under Democratic presidents.</p>
<p>The poor and the middle class get far richer: All those findings came as a surprise to me when I first saw the data. I&#8217;d pretty much accepted the Republican &#8220;party of growth&#8221; party line, after hearing it repeated thousands of times over several decades.</p>
<p><img border="0" alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/S-GCW0yAxTI/AAAAAAAAAFk/3UqQjASANjE/s320/steve1.png"></p>
<p>It turns out that at least for American presidents, it just isn&#8217;t true. Not even close. Even though the data&#8217;s been sliced, diced, and analyzed every which way from Sunday, with consistent results, critics still try to second-guess it. Many or most of these objections are spurious &#8212; statistically illiterate, logically flawed, or just plain self-contradictory special pleading. But at least one repeated question does bear examination: What about Congress? Don&#8217;t they supposedly control the purse-strings?</p>
<p>Here are some questions &#8212; some of which may seem to have &#8220;obvious&#8221; answers, though we really can&#8217;t know until we look systematically:<br />1. Do Democrats and Republicans in the different branches deliver systematically different results in spending, revenues, and deficits (and more tenuously, second-order effects like real GDP per capita)?<br />2. What are those party differences? Are they large differences?<br />3. Do those difference themselves differ depending on whether the parties are in control of the Senate, the House, and/or the Presidency? IOW, do Dems/Pubs act differently in the House than they do in the Senate or the presidency?<br />4. Which branches have the greatest effects on different economic measures?<br />5. In which branches do Democratic and Republican results differ the most? Does that vary depending on the economic measure you&#8217;re looking at?<br />6. Do certain party combinations in the Senate/House/Presidency show systematically different results in spending, revenues, etc.? Is there any sign of an optimal or dystopic combination?<br />7. Do there seem to be systematic differences between mixed and monolithic control of the branches?<br />8. Directly addressing the objections mentioned above: does an analysis of congressional results undercut, disprove, or otherwise alter the conclusions from the research on presidential outcomes linked above?<br /><a name="more"></a><br />To look into these questions I built a spreadsheet for the years 1961-2009, based on one built by my friend Steve, who tagged all the years for which party controlled each branch. (Thanks, Steve!) The spreadsheet (with data sources cited) is here.*<br />(Rdan here..to see the spreadshheet as intended, use the link. Blogger refused to translate for me)<br />I chose to start in &#8217;61 not only because the period basically spans my sentient life (self-serving bias?), but because <strong>1.</strong> it&#8217;s a reasonably long period (49 years), and <strong>2.</strong> by then the wild economic swings following the Depression and World War II had settled down. If anyone wants to extend the period backward, it&#8217;s an easy matter to add the data from the sources cited in the spreadsheet. You can jump down to the resulting graphs, or even the summary, but some discussion is in order first.</p>
<p><strong>Details </strong></p>
<p><strong>The central issue here: there are many different ways to look at this data</strong>. I&#8217;ve chosen ones that I think will give the most inclusive, comprehensive, and comprehensible insights into the questions above, revealing both the big picture and the sometimes messy, contradictory, and ambiguous results. <strong>Given the nature of the data, it simply can&#8217;t answer some of the questions above.</strong> I detail my choices here. I encourage others to use the spreadsheet to create different views &#8212; hopefully widely representative ones, eschewing intentional (or even unconscious) cherry-picking. My choices were driven by just plain curiosity about the &#8220;facts on the ground.&#8221; I had some notions of what I might find (Dems tax and spend? Pubs borrow and spend?), but given how wrong I was on presidents and economic growth, I wanted to see the numbers. I encourage others to operate from similar principles. For each year, I entered the change in spending, revenues, debt, and real GDP per capita. Then I built &#8220;lags,&#8221; so we can look at results in ensuing years. (This assuming that it takes some time to implement then see the effects of policy changes; it doesn&#8217;t happen instantly.) Here&#8217;s the upper left corner of the spreadsheet. The &#8220;change&#8221; percentages are from a simple calc: (year2-year1)/year1.</p>
<p>CHANGES IN:</p>
<p><strong>SPENDING AS % OF GDP<br /></strong>year senate house president dominant congress Mix spend0 spend1 spend2 spend3<br />1961 D D D D DD DDD 1.51% -1.31% -0.23% -0.21%<br />1962 D D D D DD DDD -1.31% -0.23% -0.21% -1.54%<br />1963 D D D D DD DDD -0.23% -0.21% -1.54% 0.49%<br />1964 D D D D DD DDD -0.21% -1.54% 0.49% 2.35%<br />1965 D D D D DD DDD -1.54% 0.49% 2.35% 0.67%<br />1966 D D D D DD DDD 0.49% 2.35% 0.67% -0.39%<br />1967 D D D D DD DDD 2.35% 0.67% -0.39% 0.92%<br />1968 D D D D DD DDD 0.67% -0.39% 0.92% 0.49%<br />1969 D D R D DD DDR -0.39% 0.92% 0.49% -0.13%<br />1970 D D R D DD DDR 0.92% 0.49% -0.13% -1.58%<br />1971 D D R D DD DDR 0.49% -0.13% -1.58% 0.45%</p>
<p>As an example of lagging, the &#8220;spend1&#8221; data is simply shifted up one year, meaning that the parties controlling the Senate, House, and Presidency get &#8220;credit&#8221; (or blame) for changes that happen a year later. Ditto for the two-, three-, and four-year lags. Note that lagging by an additional year means there&#8217;s one less year (at the end) to evaluate. We can&#8217;t look at a three-year lag for 2008, for instance, because 2011 hasn&#8217;t happened yet. Since we&#8217;re averaging over a 49-year period, it&#8217;s to be hoped that loss of those later years will not corrupt the results excessively. (This gets more problematic when you start slicing up the data; more on that below.)</p>
<p>Since I don&#8217;t use any of the zero-year-lag results (I think for obvious reasons, mentioned above, which necessitate the use of lags in the first place), the graphs below don&#8217;t tell us anything about Obama&#8217;s results in 2009. Previous years&#8217; regimes are analyzed based on the economic changes in 2009, but we have no lagging data on ensuing economic changes with which to analyze 2009. (If anyone wants to add projected data for 2010 and beyond, feel free. Just be sure to tell your readers.) Yes, this means that the Pub presidents get blamed for 2009, but so does the Democratic congress in &#8217;07 and &#8217;08. Carter gets blamed for some rocky years under Reagan in &#8217;81 and &#8217;82. And etc., throughout the table. <strong>This is why we need to look at multiple lags and many years</strong>; it serves to average out all the allocations that might seem &#8220;unfair&#8221; in the particular.</p>
<p>Another method would look at the total (summed or averaged) changes over one-, two-, three-, and four-year ensuing periods. As you&#8217;ll see in the graphs below, I chose to summarize similarly by averaging the multiple lag results. I encourage others to try the other methods. I can only display so many graphs here. As I mentioned above, the analysis gets problematic quite quickly when you start slicing the data into smaller pieces. Our short, 49-year sample quickly rears its head. Smaller, shorter slices, for instance, might only reflect where they happen to land in the business cycle. And slices concentrated at the beginning or end of the period might be distorted by long, secular trends (geopolitical, cultural, technological) that have nothing to do with party control &#8212; Matthew Arnold&#8217;s &#8220;ebb and flow of human misery.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the number of years since &#8217;61 for different regime combinations (Senate/House/President): RRD 6<br />RDR 6<br />RRR 6<br />DDD 15<br />DDR 16</p>
<p>A comparison of DDD to DDR looks like the most promising in this set of slices because they&#8217;re both lengthy and scattered through the 49-year period. Since the only difference is in presidential control, that comparison may have special applicability to the presidency question that launched this investigation, #8. The smaller slices will be much more subject to business cycles and secular trends. For instance, we&#8217;ve got three six-year, single-president slices. RDR is a single span from &#8217;81-&#8217;86, when Volcker and Reagan, with a mixed Congress, were trying to pull us out of the biggest recession since World War II (and succeeding) and a 40-year cold war (eventually succeeding). It seems foolish to draw any grand, sweeping conclusions from that single and arguably anomalous slice. Likewise: RRD is 1995 to 2000 (Clinton), and RRR is 2001 to 2006 (Bush II) &#8212; the first a massive boom (bubble?), the other a recession and tepid recovery. Hard to make useful comparisons. DDD and DDR, by comparison, reflect sixteen- and fifteen-year slices scattered from the beginning to the end of the period. Anyone can feel free to write narratives based on comparing all these slices.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve presented them in the graphs below. But with the exception of DDD and DDR comparisons, I would suggest that those spins will be statistically spurious. You&#8217;re just telling stories about single presidencies, which is exactly what we&#8217;re trying to overcome here. Here are the Senate/House combos:</p>
<p>DD 31<br />RD 6<br />RR 12</p>
<p>In those 49 years we&#8217;ve never had a Democratic Senate and Republican House. And in only six years have we had mixed Congressional control (those six Reagan years). These two facts, especially combined, make it largely impossible to throw any real light on question #7 (mixed versus monolithic control) with this analysis. DD is a large and scattered sample with both R and D presidents. RR is a single span late in the period &#8212; 1995-2006 &#8212; so it&#8217;s more subject to distortion by longer-term trends, but it&#8217;s half under Clinton, half under Bush II. RR and DD comparisons might yield insights. Larry Bartels ran into these same difficulties when trying to add the effects of the legislature to his regressions. He uses different phrasing in his explanation, which I&#8217;ll let you peruse in a footnote.* If you&#8217;re so inclined, you can also slice the data in the spreadsheet by the &#8220;dominant&#8221; party &#8212; the one controlling two out of three branches. I didn&#8217;t find much of interest there, but go to town. Again, I can only display so many graphs without it all becoming meaningless spaghetti.</p>
<p><strong>The Graphs </strong><br />One more bit of explanation &#8212; of the graphs themselves &#8212; is necessary here. I&#8217;ve made the assumption that parties can have a somewhat immediate effect on taxes, spending, and debt. So for those measures I&#8217;ve given the average of only the one- and two-year lags. I&#8217;ve shown all four bars, though, so you can see the numbers and, if you think it&#8217;s useful, eyeball-average them. For changes in real GDP per capita &#8212; which is a second-order effect and hence (in [my] theory at least) takes longer to appear &#8212; I&#8217;ve given the average of all four lags. You can produce any other calculations or presentations you want using the spreadsheet. The highlighted averages are generally in the vertical position indicating their values, except where I&#8217;ve had to move them to avoid obscuring information. That said, here we go.</p>
<p><strong>Taxes</strong></p>
<p>Revenues as a percent of GDP. This means there&#8217;s no need to correct for inflation, with the inherent uncertainties of that correction. Short story, everybody cuts taxes except Democratic presidents.</p>
<p><strong>President </strong></p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/S-F_n18p1uI/AAAAAAAAAFU/nMuS-AbgTms/s1600/steve2.png"><img border="0" alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/S-F_n18p1uI/AAAAAAAAAFU/nMuS-AbgTms/s320/steve2.png"></a></p>
<p>Democratic presidents raise taxes. Republican presidents lower them. Alert the media. (<strong>This graph shows nicely why I don&#8217;t pay much attention to three- and four-year lags for changes in revenues, spending, and debt</strong>.)</p>
<p><strong>Senate </strong></p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/S-F_nbIX83I/AAAAAAAAAFM/Bi0ZtEofEWw/s1600/steve3.png"><img border="0" alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/S-F_nbIX83I/AAAAAAAAAFM/Bi0ZtEofEWw/s320/steve3.png"></a><br />Surprise: Dem senators are tax cutters &#8212; just not as much as Pubs. For both parties, the effects are dwarfed by presidential differences.</p>
<p><strong>House</strong><br /><img border="0" alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/S-F_myFGSGI/AAAAAAAAAFE/RjE91oje-Co/s320/steve4.png"><br />Pretty much the same as the Senate, except that Dem House members cut taxes more than Republicans.</p>
<p><strong>Congress </strong><br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/S-dJQTf2-mI/AAAAAAAAAGU/pa3qMQeTOAg/s1600/steve5.png"><img border="0" alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/S-dJQTf2-mI/AAAAAAAAAGU/pa3qMQeTOAg/s320/steve5.png"></a></p>
<p>DDs and RRs are remarkably similar, with small magnitudes.</p>
<p><strong>Combined</strong><br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/S-dJjpRr3jI/AAAAAAAAAGc/ijq6XJ_d8zA/s1600/steve6.png"><img border="0" alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/S-dJjpRr3jI/AAAAAAAAAGc/ijq6XJ_d8zA/s320/steve6.png"></a></p>
<p>The DDD and DDR results are quite similar to the presidential results, above.</p>
<p><strong>Spending</strong></p>
<p>Again, as a percent of GDP so we needn&#8217;t correct for inflation. Republican presidents and Democratic senators are the big spenders, followed by Democratic house members. Democratic presidents are as frugal as Republican legislators.</p>
<p><strong>President</strong><img border="0" alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/S-F_Yh-QYNI/AAAAAAAAAEs/S0J3DrldOPw/s320/steve7.png"><br />Republican presidents raise spending significantly faster than Democrats.</p>
<p><strong>Senate</strong></p>

The data reads darned consistently here, and unlike with taxation, the magnitudes are similar to presidential changes.</p>
<p><strong>House</strong></p>

<p><strong>Congress</strong></p>

<p><strong>President</p>

<p><strong>Real GDP per Capita</p>
<p></strong>This measure is, necessarily, corrected for inflation. Changes in real personal income, a la Bartels, would arguably be a good alternative or additional measure.<strong></p>

<p><strong>Summary</p>
<p></strong>Here&#8217;s a summary of all the average changes. (Remember: revenues, spending, and debt changes are averaged over the one- and two-year lags. Real GDP per capita changes are averaged over all four lags.)</p>

<p>Conclusions</p>
<p></strong>Here&#8217;s my narrative. You can call it spin, but I hope you&#8217;ll at least agree that it&#8217;s not contradicted by the facts as they&#8217;re analyzed here. Feel free to copy and paste these graphs (credit please), or create your own, and write your own story. 1. On revenues and spending, presidential effects appear to overwhelm congressional effects. This is not surprising when you consider the presidential drives behind Reagan and Bush II&#8217;s tax cuts and defense buildups, Johnson&#8217;s Great Society plus Vietnam, Clinton&#8217;s tax increases, etc. 2. Everyone increases spending (Republican legislators just barely) &#8212; Democrats significantly more than Republicans. 3. Only Democratic presidents have the political courage to raise taxes. (Given this, their ability to get elected at all says a lot for their popularity.) 4. Of Republicans, only House members hold the line on debt, due to tiny changes in both revenues and spending. 5. Democratic presidents are the only ones to reduce the debt &#8212; and they do so in a big way. (See #3.) 6. Overall, Democratic control is associated with greater growth in real GDP per capita. (In the Senate, Pubs and Dems are essentially the same.) To do the arithmetic for you: if Republican presidents had managed equal increases during their 28 years in power, GDP/capita would be approximately 15% higher than it is today &#8212; $53K per person per year, as opposed to $46K. And if Larry Bartels&#8217; graph is any indication, far more of that (greater) GDP would be flowing through the hands of the middle class. That&#8217;s my story and I&#8217;m sticking to it (unless you convince me otherwise).</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212; * You&#8217;ll need to know, or learn to use, Excel&#8217;s pivot tables &#8212; which you should do in any case cause they kick ass. I&#8217;ve given brief instructions in the spreadsheet. The graphs require some slightly sophisticated hand-tuning (data sources, label displays, axes, etc.) depending on what you&#8217;re trying to show. ** From Unequal Democracy, page 34 (screen grab so I don&#8217;t have to type it in):</p>

<p>John Q. Policymaker is driving a minivan. Maynard Keynes is in the passenger seat, Ed Prescott and Robert Lucas are in the second row of seats and Eugene Fama and John Cochrane are in the back seats.</p>
<p>John Q: We are heading for a cliff !<br />Maynard: slam on the brakes.</p>
<p>Prescott: I don&#8217;t see how brakes work. Alan Greenspan has had fewer traffic accidents, since he stopped using brakes. I know some people still teach about friction in third rate departments, but they aren&#8217;t really advancing the science. You&#8217;ll go just as fast whether you slam on the brake or not. In modern bicycle theory it is assumed that there is no friction so the concept of &#8220;braking&#8221; is meaningless.</p>
<p>Maynard: Don&#8217;t listen to him. Slam on the brake pedal. We&#8217;re all about to die.</p>
<p>John C: Yes this is a stressful situation and in stressful situations it is tempting to turn to the fairy tales of our childhood.</p>
<p>Maynard: It&#8217;s not a fairy tale. It&#8217;s a brake. It&#8217;s worked before. </p>
<p>John C and Eugene in unison: Brakes are supposed to work because the disk spins under the brake shoes. If the disk is spinning we are going forward. Therefore brakes can&#8217;t slow us down. There is a logical contradiction between saying we should brake and that we shouldn&#8217;t keep going forward.</p>
<p>John Q: You guys in the back seats, don&#8217;t just tell me Maynard is wrong. Tell me what to do to avoid going over the cliff.</p>
<p>Robert L: Serious analysis is a difficult process and requires a step by step approach, starting with simple frictionless models. We expect to have a useful model in roughly thirty years.</p>
<p>Robert W: If you think I&#8217;m exaggerating explain exactly what is overstated in the above dialogue.</p>
