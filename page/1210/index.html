<p>AB here, checking in from a working vacation. Kash and I should be back to normal posting on Wednesday, though Fester is welcome to keep posting through the week (and thanks to Fester for filling in and make sure to add Fester&#8217;s Place to your regular reads.)</p>
<p>One interesting bit of news: Angry Bear was <a href="http://wampum.wabanaki.net/archives/000665.html">nominated for a Koufax Award</a> in the &#8220;Best Blog&#8221; category. Looking at the nominees, Angry Bear is clearly not going to win (though it is, of course, an honor just to be nominated.) In fact, I&#8217;ll be voting for another blog, though deciding which one is very tough. On the other hand, it would be nice to not come in last, or perhaps even to be a finalist, so vote early and vote often (you vote via comments to the post or emails to Dwight or MB of Wampum. Actually, given that comments are votes, Anne could nearly singlehandedly propel us to the top &#8212; j/k Anne.)</p>
<p>AB</p>

                                <p>Free Advice for Clark</p>
<p><i>DISCLAIMER: FESTER IS A DEAN SUPPORTER, so take this piece as you wish</i></p>
<p><a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/week_2004_01_04.html#002365">Josh Marshall</a> in his pre-New Hampshire travelling post lays out a pretty good and fair analysis of the primary horse race.  There is an interesting question of Clark&#8217;s return on investment in New Hampshire and the question of where Kerry&#8217;s Iowa expectations actually are.  The most important assumption that Josh is not explicitly stating is that it will drop down to a Dean-Clark race real fast, and this is an assumption that I agree with.</p>
<p>Now Josh after a long series of good thoughts has an interesting question:</p>
<blockquote><p>One final thought: an interesting strategic question.<br />
<br />Would Clark gain more from a solid Iowa victory for Dean which effectively ended Gephardt&#8217;s and Kerry&#8217;s candidacies (thus forcing a two-man race by default) or by one of the other candidates breaking out, thus knocking Dean significantly off his stride?<br />
</p></blockquote>
<p>If I am the Clark campaign manager, then I would be praying for an expectations victory for Kerry in Iowa or more preferably an outright victory by Gephardt in Iowa.  I have several reasons for this opinion.  First, an outright victory by Dean in Iowa will bring with it massive amounts of free and most likely very complementary press.  Dean already receives fairly good press on a very consistent basis, and Clark <a href="http://www.interestingtimes.blogspot.com/2003_12_28_interestingtimes_archive.html#107307041188690767">struggles</a> at times to maintain or increase his press share.  More Dean good press will most likely translate into more Dean voters as it has been shown that Dean has some of the best net favorability ratings out there.  As people get to know him, they like him, and then they vote for him.  It is a virtous cycle for Dean, and it is one that Clark can not afford to allow to continue.</p>
<p>Secondly, if I was the Clark campaign strategist, I would want Kerry and Gephardt in the race for as long as possible for two reasons.  First, I am worried about money.  Dean had another record setting quarter, while Clark had a damm good one, but still raised only 67% of Dean&#8217;s take.  Even with matching funds, Clark is most likely poorer than Dean even when we forget about the significant <a href="http://skepticalnotion.blogspot.com/2003_12_28_skepticalnotion_archive.html#107273164556256082">cash on hand</a> advantage that Dean possesses.  However if Kerry and Gephardt can stay in the race until at least Feb. 3, 2004, the combined anti-Dean warchests will be larger than the Dean warchest.  Another reason why I would want Dean to be knocked off stride is that the more candidates involved in attacking Dean the more angles that can be logically attacked.  It makes no sense for Clark to attack Dean from the left on trade policies as their published positions both indicate that they buy into the Washington Consensus, however it makes plenty of sense for Gephardt to do so.  This may not switch votes from Dean to Clark, but it may depress voter turnout.</p>
<p>Finally, looking at the most recent <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2004/1/3/0624/18603">national poll</a> for the hypothetical national primary, we see that Dean is trouncing Clark.  Clark is doing the best among the other eight non-Dean candidates, but Dean has a signifcant edge.  There is little evidence that there is a coherent and <u>large</u> popular Anti-Dean sentiment.  Clark&#8217;s best chance is to string the race out for as long as possible until he gets to favorable territory in the South and hope that Dean stumbles.  If the race collapses to Dean v. Clark by Feb. 1, Dean will have fewer opportunties to screw up while he is killing the clock.  However if Dean is facing pressure from several angles, then the odds, in my opinion, of a true <i>gaffe</i> will increase which would give Clark some maneuvering room.</p>

                                <p><h8>Weakening the Reserves, Again</h8></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.post-gazette.com/localnews/20040104homelocal2p2.asp">Pittsburgh Post-Gazette</a> is reporting that a Western Pennsylvania based Reserve MP Company has returned home and is fundamentally demobilized as of yesterday.  Congratulations and welcome back home.  I hope that these men and women will be able to transition back into civilian life reasonable successfully and that they can get the follow-up care that some may need.</p>
<p>However the interesting thing that I saw was in the last two paragraphs:</p>
<blockquote><p>Military service isn&#8217;t over for all members of the 307th. Several soldiers have volunteered to return to Fort Dix to help train the troops of B Battery, 107th Field Artillery, a Pennsylvania National Guard unit based in Shadyside.</p>
<p>B Battery, which was activated Dec. 18, will be leaving for Iraq in February or March, where the troops will function as military police.<br />
</p></blockquote>
<p>The military police function is still extremely needed and valuable in Iraq.  However the US Army has run through pretty much its entire military police component either through deployments to Iraq or Afganistan, security at Guatanamo and typical force protection missions.  Artillery units are expected to provide their own local security and guard their own road convoys, but they are not military police, they are not infantry.  It is a striking indication of how thin the Army is stretched that Reserve and National Guard artillery units are needed to act as light infantry/MPs in Iraq.</p>
<p>This policy will continue for a signficant amount of time because the Army is running out of troops who are willing to enlist.  The US Army has instituted a <a href="http://www.gazettenet.com/story.cfm?id_no=1030081">comprehensive stop-loss</a> order for every unit that is scheduled to deploy to Iraq in the next five months.  This article states that over 16,000 National Guardsmen have been retained on active duty although they want to retire.  </p>
<p>As this <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/nation/washington/articles/2003/11/23/army_reserve_battling_an_exodus/">Boston Globe</a> article demonstrates, the Reserves are already facing a recruitment shortfall. This shortfall was <i>&#8220;was largely the result of a larger than expected exodus of career reservists, a loss of valuable skills because such staff members are responsible for training junior officers and operating complex weapons systems.&#8221;</i> There is also a significant recruiting problems, with a 13% underachievement of National Guards new enlistments.  </p>
<p>The stop-loss will temporarily stop the arterial bleeding but once it is lifted there are plenty of anctedotes which suggests a large exodus will commence from both the Active and Reserve components.  This will cripple the US Army and force it to either hollow itself out, discard missions or continue in a death spiral of longer deployments, shorter recuperation and reconstitution times and increased uncertainity which will drive more soldiers out of the Army.  It will also lead to more situations where units which have a vital warfighting mission such as heavy artillery support will be crosstrained for only a couple of weeks in a totally different field and thrown into the mess.  </p>
<p>So why again are Republicans good on national defense?</p>

                                <p><h8>Economic uncertainty for the Average Joe</h8></p>
<p>Although we are seeing the economy starting to have as Brad dealing puts it &#8220;<a href="http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/movable_type/2003_archives/002974.html">some unambiguously good unemployment news</a> as new claims dropped below 350,000 for the first time in over two years, the economy is still weak for the average American.  <a href="http://wampum.wabanaki.net/archives/000659.html">MB at Wampum</a> notes that the average hourly wage for the American worker has fundamentally ceased to increase. Since November of 2002 hourly wages for non-exempt workers have been stuck in a 4 cent band in 1982 dollars.  There is no new purchasing power being distributed to workers.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.epinet.org/content.cfm/webfeatures_snapshots">Economic Policy Institute</a> has a good graph that illustrates this point and they correctly note that wage growth, in the long run should roughly correlate to productivity growth and economic growth in general.  However we have seen two good years of productivity growth and no corresponding wage growth.  This is definitely a long and variable lag.</p>
<p>What new jobs are being created are not as good as that jobs that are being lost.  Another <a href="http://www.epinet.org/content.cfm/webfeatures_snapshots_archive_12172003">EPI quickshot</a> demonstrates that the growing industries in this economy have lower wages than the declining industries which are losing jobs.  This is a probable explanation as to why median income has been <a href="http://www.cbpp.org/9-26-03pov-fact.htm">falling</a> for two years now.  </p>
<p>The average Joe Six-Pack is not seeing an economic recovery.  Instead he is seeing an increase in his debt service obligations, no increase in his real wages, increased housing costs and a decrease in his overall standard of living.  <a href="http://www.itstheeconomy.blogspot.com/2003_12_28_itstheeconomy_archive.html#107280737568523600">Savings</a> are depleted and the risk factor of being unemployed is extremely high still.  One or two good reports such as the <a href="http://www.forbes.com/markets/newswire/2004/01/02/rtr1196117.html">ISM survey</a> do not remove this uncertainty and risk from the average Joe&#8217;s mind.</p>

                                <p><h8>Pittsburgh&#8217;s Woes</h8><br />
<br /><a href="http://www.atrios.blogspot.com/2003_12_28_atrios_archive.html#107305581233485313">Atrios</a> has a good summary of the problems that the city of Pittsburgh faces for the next year.  I have gone into <a href="http://festersplace.blogspot.com/2003_09_14_festersplace_archive.html#106357777666966601">long details</a> about the basic problems that the city faces in previous posts.  However I will recap the basic problems and provide a quick update on what is going on.  Basically the city is facing a massive structural deficit and it has very little maneuvering room for legal, financial and political reasons.  The city has the basic infrastructure of a city twice its population and it is decaying which drives up maitenance costs.  Additionally local political wills and realities means that we can not rightsize the city government services effectively.  Finally the city has rung up a massive amount of debt in an attempt to &#8220;grow&#8221; our way out of the looming fiscal crisis by offering the $50,000 a year plus suburbanite crowd a good reason to visit the city.</p>
<p>The solution space is fairly limited.  New taxes have been proffered on a variety of items and targets.  Beer, payroll preperation, wages, deed transfers etc. have all had new taxes proposed.  None of these proposals have been approved as of yet.  Most of these proposals will require changes in state law, and the Republican dominated Assembly will not approve of actions that result in commuter taxes.  The primary plan in action right now has been for the city to apply for and be declared a &#8220;<a href="http://www.philly.com/mld/inquirer/news/local/7594823.htm"><i>distressed</i></a> city under the 1987 law ACT 47 which is the municipal bankruptcy law for the state.  Act 47 status has been granted to the city and it will allow for better bargaining power with city union contracts, technical assistance from the state and the ability to levy commuter taxes. </p>
<p>Mayor Murphy has for two years in a row proposed budgets that do not even come close to reality and rely on invisible sources of funding to even come close to balance.  Last year it was pour taxes and wage taxes, now it is a commuter tax that is not yet approved and vocation tax increases.  Last year&#8217;s gap was partially filled by closing down the city&#8217;s Parks and Recreation programs and stretching out some payments.  Additionally approximately 100 cops were either laid-off or chose early retirement.</p>
<p>City Council voted <a href="http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/04001/257085.stm">the 2004 Murphy budget</a> down and approved a budget that relies on a couple new taxes, including an increaes in the parking tax and some spending cuts.  However the City Council budget is still assuming that there will be several significant increases in revenue that I do not believe are realistic.  The City is expecting that the Sports and Exhibition Authority which owns the new football and baseball stadiums as well as the new convention center will be able to increase the payment in lieu of taxes.  However the SEA (disclosure: I have a good friend working with the SEA) is currently running at a <a href="http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/business/7608351.htm">substantial deficit</a> for this year.  The Council budget also is assuming significant first year costs savings as they propose service consolidations with the county.  I have doubts about that.</p>
<p>Fundamentally the city is stuck at the moment.  It can not balance its budgets by cuts as too much of the expenditures are legally guaranteed at the moment.  It will gain some flexibility in the next two years as the majority of the municipal employee union contracts will expire, but there are few cost savings currently available that would not devestate city services.  New taxes are needed in the short to medium term in order but the state government is reluctant to allow the city to raise the needed revenue from suburban commuters.  Local consolidation with the county will not proceed although service sharing will increase.</p>
<p>The city is screwed.  The best solution for this year is to buy time with a series of additional one-off revenue enhancements such as debt refinancing, selling the city&#8217;s asphalt plant and rejiggering the pension plan yet again.  All of these measures increase the long term cost to the city but will probably occur as the city has few to no other options left.</p>

                                <p>Winning the War on Terorrism</p>
<p>There are many plans to win the war on terorrism.  Some are completely <a href="http://www.adamyoshida.com/">insane</a>, others are <a href="http://38.144.96.23/tacitus/archives/001171.html#001171">pretty decent.</a>  Now some non-bloggers, and people with actual influence and power are proposing plans to <a href="http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2003_12_31_stevegilliard_archive.html#107285248641862054">invade the rest of the world</a> sometime in the second Bush term (there is a good reason why I am working to beat that SOB)  But none of these strategies are victory strategies in the war on terrorism.  Some are victory or at least non-loss strategies for Iraq, and I refer to Tactitus&#8217; plans, others are completely insane in general but they are not comprehensive in nature.  </p>
<p>I can not offer a comprehensive plan, however <a href="http://www.juancole.com/2004_01_01_juancole_archive.html#107303118882421594">Juan Cole</a> has a great short list of objectives that we need to seek in order to leave 2004 more secure than 2003.  I hope that I do justice to his thoughts as I condense them.</p>
<p><i>5)  Stabilize Pakistan because they have nukes and a strong militant population and political base.  Additionally a stable Pakistan can be leverage in the creation of a continental market which should improve living standards for most people and reduce the frustration experienced.  </i></p>
<p>I would think that one policy that the US can immediately take to improve Pakistan&#8217;s stability is to remove the import tariffs</p>
<p><i>4) Stabilize Afganistan &#8212; &#8217;nuff said, be willing to spend the money, political capital and the troops needed to create a reasonably strong and unified central government.  Remove power from the clans and tribal warlords</i></p>
<p>Now here is the problem with the opportunity cost of Iraq, where can the US get the manpower and cultural expertise since it is all deployed to Iraq right now</p>
<p><i>3) Stabilize a united Iraq so that there is not a three way civil war if there is a loss federal structure of government.  The Sunni Arabs have few oil resources but plenty of military experience.  They can cause trouble if they are cut off from the one present source of Iraq wealth.</i></p>
<p>Now where do we get the troops and the political will to stabilize the situation versus helping the Bush re-election campaign.</p>
<p><i> 2. The US must capture Osama Bin Laden, Saad Bin Laden, Ayman al-Zawahiri, Saif al-Adil, and other top al-Qaeda leaders, of both the older and the younger generations. This task was far more important for the immediate security of those of us who live in the US than conquering Iraq, and it was highly irresponsible to undertake the latter before accomplishing the former.</i></p>
<p><i> 1) Lean heavily on Isreal to prevent the Bantustanation of the Palestinian people.  The US is not seen as a fair broker in the Middle East and this is one of the prime grievances of the entire Arab world.  No PR campaign will work unless there are a series of concrete and politically painful actions on the part of the US political establishment to signal that the US will become a fair broker instead of an Isreali lackey.</i></p>
<p>I agree with Juan&#8217;s plans and objectives, however I have a problem of implementation.  These plans sound competent, well-thought and plausible.  The Bush Administration will not go for that.</p>

                                <p>Kurdish Sell-out Watch Continues</p>
<p><a href="http://www.juancole.com/2003_12_01_juancole_archive.html#107277237245622450">Juan Cole</a> has a long analytical post that is examing the Kurdish position on self-governance.  Basically the Kurds are willing to be a part of Iraq as long as they have an extremely high level of autonomy.  If I am understanding these articles, I would imagine that they are seeking a deal similiar to the Dayton Accords where there is a national government composed of the three major ethnic groups but a high degree of regional/ethnic indepedence.  A major Shi&#8217;ite party, counting the votes, is opposing any weak form of federal government.  </p>
<p>The threatening thing that I saw in this post by Juan is the implicit threat that the the Kurdish peshmerga which have aided the US Army in maintaining a reasonable degree of civil order in the north, may decide to undertake active combat operations against both American and potentially Turkish targets.  That is one thing that we do not need as <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2003/12/28/182633/63">Kos</a> points out, we have lost another twenty nine soldiers in the past two weeks and that these casualties are not in the Kurdish areas.</p>
<p>So bad news may be on the horizon.</p>

                                <p>Desperately Poor Countries<br />

<p>Brad DeLong recently took a lot of heat in his comments for <a href="http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/movable_type/2003_archives/002953.html">this statement</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I wonder about Bob Herbert: is he smart enough to have, when he looked in the mirror this morning, thought, &#8220;I see a man who is trying to keep India a desperately poor country?&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Brad&#8217;s acerbic comment was inspired by <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/26/opinion/26HERB.html">this piece</a> in which Mr. Herbert writes about the problem of the &#8220;off-shoring&#8221; of white collar jobs. Not only is Brad right that opposing such off-shoring is tantamount to wishing poverty upon India, if IBM doesn&#8217;t outsource thusly then some other firm will, putting IBM at a competitive disadvantage, leading to job losses at IBM. But I want to focus on the &#8220;desperately poor&#8221; part of the issue, rather than the comparative advantage part of the issue. </p>
<p>Via Anne in comments, I see an NYT editorial today, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/30/opinion/30TUE1.html"><em>Harvesting Poverty: The Unkept Promise</em></a>. It speaks poignantly about the cost that protectionism in the US, EU, and Japan imposes on Third World nations (in addition to raising the price of food in the developed world &#8212; a cost borne primarily by the poor):</p>
<blockquote><p>The club of rich nations that wrote the rules of global trade has been aggressive in dismantling barriers when it comes to industrial goods and services, in which they hold a comparative advantage. But they refuse to do the same when it comes to agriculture. Politically powerful farm lobbies in Japan, Europe and the United States are not willing to face global competition on fair terms. So agriculture remains the hypocritical asterisk to our fervent free-trade and free-enterprise creed.</p>
<p>&#8230; Worse, the developed world funnels nearly $1 billion a day in subsidies to its own farmers, encouraging overproduction, which drives down commodity prices. Poor nations&#8217; farmers find they cannot compete with subsidized products, even within their own countries. In recent years, American farmers have been able to dump cotton, wheat, rice, corn and other products on world markets at prices that do not begin to cover their cost of production, all courtesy of the taxpayers.</p>
<p>&#8230; The World Bank estimates that an end to trade-distorting farm subsidies and tariffs could expand global wealth by as much as a half-trillion dollars and lift 150 million people out of poverty by 2015.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ll say it again. U.S. farm subsidies and import tariffs are truly bad policy and the bulk of the subsidies go to large farms, not the ma and pa farms of our idyllic but distant past. They make food more expensive in the U.S. while adding to Third World impoverishment. Finally, if I can&#8217;t count on them to back free trade, then what are Republicans good for? </p>

                                <p>Ephedra Ban<br />

<p>Today, the FDA today <a href="http://www.reuters.com/newsArticle.jhtml?type=businessNews&#038;storyID=4058063">banned Ephedra</a>, a substance that has no documented beneficial effects and some documented side effects:</p>
<blockquote><p>Manufacturers of the supplement insist their product is safe when taken as directed. But FDA and Health and Human Services Department officials have been saying for months that they would like to ban ephedra and were building their case so there could be little dissent.</p></blockquote>
<p>One interesting thing about the ban is that it&#8217;s an admission by the administration that self-regulation by industry participants doesn&#8217;t always work &#8212; though such self-regulation remains the preferred choice in the environmental arena. </p>
<p>A second interesting factor is that Ephedra became so widespread in the first place due to Orrin Hatch&#8217;s fervid support of the &#8220;Homeopathic&#8221; or &#8220;Herbal&#8221; industry, which eventually <a href="http://home.comcast.net/~bkrentzman/sup.vitamin.alt/supplements/3.utah.herb.bus.html">lead to passage</a> of the <em>1994 Dietary Supplement Health Education Act</em>, which exempted herbal supplement makers from proving the efficacy of their products. No double-blind testing needed. (*)</p>
<p>AB</p>
<p>(*) Bob Park <a href="http://www.aps.org/WN/WN02/wn082302.html">explains the virtues</a> of double-blind testing:</p>
<blockquote><p>The most important discovery in the history of medicine was the randomized double-blind test. It allows us to find out what works and what doesn&#8217;t. So far, herbals are in the &#8220;doesn’t&#8221; category: St. John’s Wort doesn’t relieve depression, but it does interfere with some cancer drugs; echinacea doesn’t ward off colds and flu; ephedra causes frequent injuries and even death; and this week we learn that ginkgo biloba doesn’t enhance memory in people over 60.</p></blockquote>
