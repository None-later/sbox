                                                                    </div>

                                <p>IN a comment to a post a while ago, someone asked me to explain the phrase &#8220;money metric welfare&#8221; and why I hate it so much.  It is, in fact, the element of economic theory which I like least, at that is saying something.</p>
<p>A good explanation is given by a <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2009/04/hoisted-from-the-archives-a-non-socratic-dialogue-on-social-welfare-functions.html">non Socratic dialogue </a>reposted by Brad DeLong.  He calls it &#8220;The Market&#8217;s Social Welfare Function.&#8221;  This means he assumes the standard assumptions sufficient to make market outcomes Pareto efficient, rationality, perfect competition, market clearing, no externalities, symmetric information and complete markets.</p>
<p>My effort at explanation after the jump.</p>
<p>The idea is to choose a starting point A then evaluate changes from that starting point to a new point B in terms of the dollar (or numeraire) good value of the change to each individual and then add up these amounts.  The advantage is that this gives a number so that if the number is positive one might have some reason to claim that B is better than A.  The disadvantage is that no one who understands what is going on can seriously believe that claim.</p>
<p>The points A and B are social outcomes &#8212; complete descriptions of the world from now until forever.  The sort of change one might assess would be say taxing CO2 emissions and dividing the proceeds equally among all citizens.  </p>
<p>For each person one can imagine calculating (or eliciting) an equivilant variation EV_i an amount of cash such that the individual is indifferent between the reform (moving to state B) and receiving EV_i in cash.  The is the money metric benefit of the reform.  Obviously EV_i can be negative.  If so the absolute value of EV_i is the amount of money metric cost to i of the reform.</p>
<p>Then the total money metric effect of the reform EV is the sum over all citizens i of EV_i.</p>
<p>It is clear that the choice of the initial state A is critical to this calculation.  It is just not true that if the EV of a change from A to B is negative, then the EV of a change from B to A is positive.  The choice of the initial state A is critical and always made very casually when attempting to calculate EVs.</p>
<p>EV is not a change in a function which depends only on preferences and technology.  Only once an initial state is chosen is there anything like a social welfare function.  We can say that state A gives the maximum money metric utility for initial state A if the EV for the change to all possible other states is negative.</p>
<p>We can understand EV by comparing it to another hypothetical function.  Imagine that everyone has a utility function which describes how happy they are as a function of outcomes. EV_i says they are equally happy in state A and in (state B plus they get EV_i in cash).  </p>
<p>If we thought that utility functions exist, a natural social welfare function would be just add up the utility functions to get to total happiness.   This corresponds very closely (but not exactly) to the voice of my personal concience (I am very nearly a hard core add em up utilitarian).  It does not correspond at all to money metric welfare.</p>
<p>If, as mentioned above, state A gives maximimum money metric welfare (for initial state A) then A maximizes a weighted sum of utility functions.  The weights are the inverses of the marginal utlity of cash (the increase in happiness due to one more cent say).  This implies a huge weight on the happiness of a rich person compared to the weight on the happiness of a poor person.  It has no moral appeal.</p>
<p>One reason it is of some theoretical interest to economists is that if state A gives maximimum money metric welfare (for initial state A) then state A is Pareto efficient, that is, it is impossible to make everyone better off by changing to B.  If such a Pareto improvement were possible, every EV_i would be positive so the sum would be positive .  Also the free market outcome must be such a state such a state given the standard assumptions of rationality, perfect competition, market clearing, no externalities, symmetric information and complete markets, which imply that the result would be of no practical relevance (since all the assumptions are false statements about the real world) even if &#8220;money metric welfare&#8221; meant &#8220;welfare.&#8221;</p>
<p>One way of seeing this is to consider a change which has nothing to do with money or private consumption.   Say we are deciding about whether to paint the Washington Monument pink (the paint and labor are both free by assumption).  I&#8217;d guess this has a negative EV, but, in principle some people might like that. </p>
<p>Now let&#8217;s imagine a national lottery with a prize of say 100 billion (not optional) and use the state before the painting but after the lottery ticket is picked as our initial state A.  If the winner is one of hte few people who wants a pink Washington moneument, it is entirely possible that painting it pink will have a positive EV.  Someone with over 100 billion will be willing to spend billions on a whim and most people don&#8217;t care much.  On the other hand, if the winner is someone who doesn&#8217;t want it pink, then the EV of painting it will be negative. </p>
<p>OK the right thing for society to do, the social welfare maximizing color of the Washington monument, can&#8217;t really depend on the blind chance of a lottery can it ?  <br />I don&#8217;t think so, and so I consider the concept of money metric utility idiotic.<br />No one defends the claim that EV is social welfare.  </p>
<p>Many people, however, pull a sneaky trick.  They argue that social welfare and the right choice to make etc are inherently normative choices, statements about our values as well as about facts.  EV sure isn&#8217;t a statement of anyone&#8217;s values (unless that person has deep respect for the God of chance).  Therefore it is a positive statement.</p>
<p>So we can separate statements of fact and value as statements about EV and other statements about how things are good or bad.  We can call EV efficiency and note that we also care about equity.  All of this is based on the fact that a change can have positive EV even though it only helps a few super rich people and hurts everyone else.</p>
<p>OK just because something isn&#8217;t the function we should maximize and the guide to right choice that doesn&#8217;t mean it is a measure of efficiency.  I can make as many arbitrary functions as I want all of which have any desirable property which EV with initial state A has.  </p>
<p>The argument is, as always, look at this, it is not what we wish we had.  Therefore it is a useful approximation to what we wish we had.  I assert the argument is really just that, that I have left out nothing and been totally fair to the advocates of EV.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I think very few people have ever been convinced. </p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Ken Houghton&#8217;s Loyal Reader directed my attention to <a target="_blank" href="http://blogs.wsj.com/deals/2009/04/13/what-is-the-difference-between-a-ponzi-scheme-and-an-investment-bank/">this WSJ blog entry</a>, commenting on, and attempting to provide cover for, the management and actions of The Old Firm.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sympathetic to the general argument—Ace Greenberg&#8217;s naming of Jimmy Cayne to succeed him was incredibly bad judgment that had real consequences, but not malice aforethought—but the WSJ&#8217;s attempt to defend upper management rather goes off the rails.*</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s look at some of the analytical parts of the article:<br />
<blockquote>Investment banks were certainly imprudent in leveraging themselves 33 to 1; but they also announced it publicly in their quarterly statements.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Certainly imprudent&#8221; is having unprotected sex with someone who clearly has open genital and/or oral herpes sores.  33x is larger even than the Cox-allowed 30x leverage (which was imprudent in the first place). &#8220;Thirty times leverage; it&#8217;s not just imprudent, it&#8217;s the law.&#8221;</p>
<p>UPDATE:  My Loyal Reader e-mails:<br />
<blockquote>Cohan writes that only at the end of a quarter was Bear around 40:1 and most of the rest of the time it was at 50 or 55:1&#8230;.JPMorgan Chase at the time of the takeover calculated that out of $300 billion Bear Stearns counted as assets, $220 billion could be considered &#8220;toxic&#8221;.</p></blockquote>
<p>So even Moore&#8217;s 33:1 is known to be optimistic. And having more than 73% of your &#8220;assets&#8221; rated as &#8220;toxic&#8221; isn&#8217;t prudent management: it&#8217;s doubling-down while <a target="blank" href="http://itmightbedangerous.blogspot.com/2008/06/draft-review-about-process.html">hitting on 17</a>.</p>
<p>We all know that the Prudent Investor definition has been redefined beyond reality, but it&#8217;s difficult to believe anyone would consider BSC&#8217;s practices to compile with reasonable Standards and Practices.<br />
<blockquote>Shareholders, in turn, never complained as long as the banks were making money in 2006 and 2007. It was only when the music stopped and the economy turned bad that shareholders started to blame the banks for shifty dealings.</p></blockquote>
<p>And it was only when Madoff admitted there were no more assets that &#8220;shareholders&#8221; complained.  Are we supposed to take some affirmative defense from this, or is Heidi Moore just clueless? (You can chose &#8220;and&#8221; if you want.)<br />
<blockquote>Meanwhile, regulators are said to still be curious about what caused the “bear raids” that took down Bear Stearns and Lehman and threatened Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs.</p></blockquote>
<p>They&#8217;re welcome to be curious, but the minute Alan Schwartz went on CNBC and said, &#8220;We think we&#8217;re solvent&#8221; is the minute anyone with any brains and capital went massively short Bear.  And they were late to the party, since anyone in the market with any brains and knowledge of MBS ramifications—think the guy at Solly who called Michael Lewis and said &#8220;Buy potatoes&#8221; as Chernobyl was happening—knew exactly who was going to be Most Likely to Pay Off if you bought (again, common knowledge) some proverbially-undervalued far OOTM put options.</p>
<p>In fairness, Cohan appears to believe this is a smoking gun.  But we&#8217;ve heard those rumours since before the bankruptcy, and Bear Stearns is not Iceland.  If Cohan&#8217;s correct in his assertion on Stewart&#8217;s show that the people who bought all those OOTM put options were hedge funds that had previously used BSC for their Clearing Agent, then they voted with their feet in the face of reality.</p>
<p>And the rest of the market isn&#8217;t dumb.  They could see who was buying, and what their previous relationship with Bear had been.  And they would see Alan Schwartz and realise this is not the man who is going to make it between the Scylla and Charybdis.  And they would take that—along with things such as Goldman&#8217;s immediate affirmation when the rumours starting about Lehmann and Bear that Lehmann would continue to be a respected competitor and trading partner—and be able to add.</p>
<p>As the Beatles said, &#8220;One and one and one is three/Got to go short Bear cause he&#8217;s so hard to see.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the WSJ wants you to think that going even beyond Christopher &#8220;I never saw a regulation I planned to enforce&#8221; Cox&#8217;s SEC-permitted leverage ratios is not a violation of the law, and that hedge funds who see incompetence and near-bankruptcy do not act on that information.</p>
<p>The coolest thing about the Stewart/Cohan interview was when Cohan said &#8220;creative destruction&#8221; and Stewart immediately came back with Schumpeter by name. Maybe this is why Heidi Moore&#8217;s piece opens by calling Stewart &#8220;our nation’s foremost financial commentator.&#8221; (Take that, Paul Krugman!)  But the attempts to argue that The Old Firm was substantively different from a Ponzi scheme are going to need a better case made than she does.</p>
<p>Capitalism deserves a better defense.</p>
<p>*They specifically miss connecting the dots on where there was clear fraud committed by management—and I suspect Cohan did as well, since no one who talks about the book seems to mention it. <strong>UPDATE</strong>: I&#8217;m now told he did deal with it, but sloughed it off. So expect <a target="blank" href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/">Yves</a> or <a target="blank" href="http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/">Barry</a> or <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/">Felix</a> (blogroll update candidate, btw) or <a target="blank" href="http://paul.kedrosky.com/">Paul</a> (maybe even <a target="blank" href="http://globaleconomicanalysis.blogspot.com/">Mish</a>, who has the mindset for the job)—someone who pays a lot more day-to-day attention to the market than I can right now—to jump on this one in the near future.</p>

                                <p>by Bruce Webb</p>
<p>Commenter and  blogger Arne (whose largely SS Blog is found <a target="_blank" href="http://adastra1960.blogspot.com/">here</a>) asked in comments whether it was time to move beyond &#8220;Nothing&#8221; and propose to policy makers some alternative plans to address future discontinuities. Which is a very sensible question, because if and when the Social Security Trust Funds (DI and then later OAS) approach depletion, we have to do &#8220;Something&#8221;. Because as former Deputy Commissioner of SS Biggs helpfully explained it turns out that current law does not allow the Commissioner of SS to either unilaterally change benefit levels, nor does he have the legal authority to borrow. Which means that the combined 22% cut in benefits in 2041 (SSA) would show up as delayed checks for Disabled beneficiaries as DI goes deplete around 2019 (CBO) and for OAS beneficiaries around 2049 (CBO). In all likelihood &#8220;Something&#8221; will have to be done whether that be the plan advanced by Arne, the quite similar plan advanced by <a target="_blank" href="http://bruceweb.blogspot.com/2009/02/coberly-on-social-security-at-angry.html">Coberly</a>, or several varieties of my plan, or <a target="_blank" href="http://www.brookings.edu/views/papers/orszag/200504security.pdf">Diamond-Orszag</a>, or <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hks.harvard.edu/jeffreyliebman/lms_nonpartisan_plan_description.pdf">Liebman-MacGuineas-Samwick</a> or any other plan people might like to suggest.</p>
<p>But my answer to Arne&#8217;s question is &#8220;Not yet&#8221;. To understand why we have to consider what &#8220;bi-partisan compromise&#8221; on Social Security has meant in the recent past and today. Links and discussion below the fold.</p>
<p>I take as our starting place President Bush&#8217;s 2001 <a target="_blank" href="http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/csss/index.htm">Commission to Strengthen Social Security</a>. The Commission&#8217;s web-site lays out its task as follows (bolding mine): <br />
<blockquote>On May 2, President Bush announced establishment of a bipartisan, 16-member Commission &#8220;to study and report … specific recommendations to preserve Social Security for seniors while building wealth for younger Americans.&#8221;<br />Guiding Principles<br />The Commission was asked to make recommendations to modernize and restore fiscal soundness to Social Security, using six guiding principles:</p>
<p>Modernization must not change Social Security benefits for retirees or near-retirees.<br />The entire Social Security surplus must be dedicated only to Social Security.<br />Social Security payroll taxes must not be increased.<br />The government must not invest Social Security funds in the stock market.<br />Modernization must preserve Social Security`s disability and survivors insurance programs.<br />Modernization must include individually controlled, voluntary personal retirement accounts, which will augment Social Security.</p></blockquote>
<p>Meaning that &#8216;bi-partisan&#8217; in context means &#8216;Democrats who agree in advance on a no-tax/PRA solution&#8217;. Which in turn means that none of Coberly&#8217;s, Arne&#8217;s, mine, or even D-O or LMS plans would meet the initial cut, all of whom include or are open to some increase in payroll tax and only LMS explicitly including PRA&#8217;s. When Bush in 2004 and 2005 claimed &#8216;all options are on the table&#8217; he really meant &#8216;all options bracketed by the three models included in the CSSS Final Report <a target="_blank" href="http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/csss/reports/Final_report.pdf">Strengthening Social Security and Creating Personal Wealth for All Americans</a>&#8216;. Meaning that &#8216;dialogue&#8217; was implicitly defined as &#8216;after first capitulating to my principles&#8217;.</p>
<p>Which is why &#8220;Nothing&#8221; remained my preferred plan right through to January 20th, 2009, there was no way the Bush Administration would agree to any &#8220;Something&#8221; I would accept. Indeed their starting position required rejecting a plan co-written by a top Bush administration economist whose portfolio included Social Security (Samwick of LMS). On my analysis LMS is a horribly worker-unfriendly plan that shifts most burdens for &#8216;fixing&#8217; Social Security &#8216;crisis&#8217; from capital entirely to wage workers and doesn&#8217;t &#8216;fix&#8217; the &#8216;crisis&#8217; as normally framed: benefit cuts at depletion in 2041 (SSA). LMS compromises on Bush&#8217;s six principles by proposing taxes on wage workers and wage workers only. To describe it as the authors do as a &#8220;bi-partisan compromise&#8221; is from a progressive standpoint ludicrous:<br />
<blockquote>The three of us – former aides to President Clinton, Senator McCain, and President Bush – did an experiment to see if we could develop a reform plan that we could all support. The Liebman-MacGuineas-Samwick (LMS) plan demonstrates the types of compromises that can help policy makers from across the political spectrum agree on a Social Security reform plan.</p></blockquote>
<p> But all of those &#8216;compromises&#8217; end up being in the form of worker concessions, and almost all the benefits ultimately flow to capital. As I put this is post no. 5 in my AB SS series (May 12, 2008 <a target="_blank" href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/05/bw-on-soc-sec-vi-lms-and-infinite.html">LMS and the Infinite Future</a><br />
<blockquote>Which is well and good except that in this case &#8216;spectrum&#8217; seems to span everything from (barely) left-center to right. This is bipartisan in the Lieberman sense, lets agree to slightly moderate a conservative position and call it good. Second coming of FDR it decidedly isn&#8217;t. But back to the authors. Prof Jeffrey Liebman (of Harvard&#8217;s Kennedy School of Government) is particularly interesting in that as well as being a former Clintonista he is currently one of the top three economists on Obama&#8217;s economic team. When Social Security policy is being discussed in what I hope is an Obama Administration he is more than likely to be sitting at the table, something I view with a certain unease.</p></blockquote>
<p>An unease I maintain today eleventh months later. Barkley Rosser advised me to discount Liebman on the basis that the real danger to Social Security is coming from Larry Summers. Which may be, on the other hand Liebman subsequent to that advice from Barkley landed as one of Orzsag&#8217;s top level deputies as the Executive Associate Director at OMB. Indeed while the OMB org chart show the Executive Associate Director at the same level as the four regular Associate Directors the language of the Press Release shows him to be maybe the First among Equals<br />
<blockquote>Today, President-elect Barack Obama announced the following key posts at the Office of Management and Budget (OMB): Jeffrey Liebman, Executive Associate Director; Steve Kosiak, Associate Director for Defense and International Affairs; Robert Gordon, Associate Director for Education, Income Maintenance and Labor; Xavier de Souza Briggs, Associate Director for General Government Programs; Preeta Bansal, OMB General Counsel and Senior Policy Advisor; and Kenneth Baer, Associate Director for Communications and Strategic Planning.</p></blockquote>
<p> Which is why I am not yet ready to abandon my current policy preference of &#8220;Nothing&#8221; at least for any purposes outside the confines of the Econoblogs at least not yet. As it is we have the co-author of a not-so-bad Social Security plan (Diamond-Orzsag) at the OMB and the co-author of an awful SS plan (Liebman of LMS) serving as his deputy, and no clear defender of traditional SS in the Administration except Jared Bernstein and maybe Jason Furman. Against that we have calls from Hassett and Biggs at AEI and their apparent stenographers Montgomery and Hiatt at the WaPo insisting that the answer to to agree to a &#8216;bi-partisan commission&#8217;. </p>
<p>HIatt made the case as follows: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/04/10/AR2009041002155.html">Fixing the Budget In the Worst (But Only) Way</a><br />
<blockquote>But in the department of doggedness, nobody can outdo Wolf, a Republican who has represented parts of Northern Virginia for 28 years. For the past several years, what he has been most persistent about is the need for a bipartisan commission to stave off looming fiscal disaster. He introduces legislation, writes letters, makes calls. Above all he pleads his case: Nothing else is going to work.</p>
<p>For just as long, I&#8217;ve been reluctant to admit that Wolf might be right. There are two big problems with the type of commission he&#8217;s proposing, which would present Congress with one take-it-or-leave-it grand solution. It can produce lowest-common-denominator-type answers. And it makes sense only if you&#8217;re willing to admit that the regular political system cannot do what it is supposed to do. Which, lately, has been seeming like a safer and safer bet.</p>
<p>The model for the Wolf idea is the method Congress has used to close military bases since 1988. Recognizing that the Pentagon operated too many facilities but that no legislator would vote to close a base in his or her own district, Congress set up a Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission (BRAC), which came up with a rational downsizing plan. Congress had to vote for the whole list or nothing at all; there could be no special pleading.</p></blockquote>
<p>Why is the regular political system not functioning? Could it have anything to do with the fact that Republicans have united in opposition to any plan of Obama&#8217;s that spends any money on domestic programs in favor of a solution that freezes all domestic programs across the board, claims that a $34 billion in increased defence spending equates to &#8216;slashing&#8217; that budget and proposes that the answer is just to agree on abolishing corporate taxes and continuing lower taxes on the wealthy? Well no, it is Obama&#8217;s refusal to adopt Bushonomic economic policy that worked so marvelously up to now. Which is how the Washington Post defines &#8216;bi-partisanship&#8217;. What is Hiatt&#8217;s preferred solution for breaking this deadlock? Simple. We just sign on to Wolf&#8217;s proposal.<br />
<blockquote>Now comes the movement to bring the rationale behind BRAC to the budget. Wolf&#8217;s bill is co-sponsored by Rep. Jim Cooper (D-Tenn.); comparable legislation in the Senate is backed by the chairman and the ranking minority member of the Budget Committee, Kent Conrad (D-N.D.) and Judd Gregg (R-N.H.). The idea got a boost 10 days ago from another panel of Wise Men (and a couple of Wise Women) in a report called <a target="http://www.thepresidency.org/pubs/Saving_Americas_Future_report.pdf">Saving America&#8217;s Future</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;In light of the demonstrated inability of the existing political process&#8221; to address the country&#8217;s fiscal problems, the panel said, Congress should create a Fiscal Future Commission modeled on, yes, BRAC. The authors include a former NATO ambassador, David Abshire; a former Lockheed Martin CEO, Norman Augustine; a Democratic former governor, Roy Romer; former attorney general Edwin Meese; former senators Sam Nunn and Chuck Hagel; and many more.</p>
<p>The idea makes most sense for something like saving Social Security, <i>where there&#8217;s a large consensus at the political center on what needs to be done</i> (change the inflation index for benefits a bit, raise the age limit a bit, tax income at a slightly higher level) but no political will to do it. But the Fiscal Future Commission would fix not only all entitlement programs but also &#8220;reorient government spending programs and tax preferences.&#8221; And it would do so &#8220;free of the pressure and influence of interest groups and partisan elements.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p> Taking the last point first, lets take a look at the names of those &#8216;Wise Men (and Women). <a target="_blank" href="http://bruceweb.blogspot.com/2009/04/fred-hiatts-wise-men.html">Fred Hiatt&#8217;s Wise Men</a>. Short version: four generals and admirals, a handful of retired Congressional defense hawks,  a former Secty of the Army, six former Republican cabinet level officials, two college Presidents with strong ties to Wall Street, plus for the heck of it a civil liberties defending Obama supporter. But basically a group that ranges all the way from the Center to the right. Oh and yes a certain <a target="_blank" href="http://bruceweb.blogspot.com/2009/04/fred-hiatts-wise-men.html">C. Fred Bergsten</a>. Who&#8217;s he? &#8220;C. Fred Bergsten has been director of the Peterson Institute for International Economics since its creation in 1981.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yep nothing like loading up your lineup with a bunch of defense hawks and Bush cabinet members and a Pete G. Peterson guy to get you free from &#8220;the pressure and influence of interest groups and partisan element&#8221;. This is just another case of Peterson trying to make a move.</p>
<p>Then note that Hiatt presents us with a solution that could have been (and likely was) written by Pete G. himself and presents it as a &#8220;large consensus at the political center&#8221;.</p>
<p>So the answer to Budget &#8216;crisis&#8217; is to propose a compromise on bi-partisan lines between Obama top level officials open to  SS benefit cuts (e.g. Orszag and Liebman) and Congressional conservative Republicans (Gregg) and Blue Dog Democrats (Cooper and Conrad) who agree that Social Security is unsustainable with backing from a Pete G. Peterson front group masquerading as the Sensible Centrist Wise Men and so form a &#8220;Bi-Partisan Commission&#8221; to present an &#8220;Up or Down&#8221; solution on the BRAC model. Well no thanks, not only am I not willing to get fooled again, I wasn&#8217;t much fooled the first few times around.</p>
<p>Meaning I am not yet ready to move off a position of &#8220;Nothing&#8221;. Not at least until we get to the point of being able to lift the rock of Social Security &#8216;reform&#8217; via a Fiscal Future Commission  without finding Pete G. Peterson or his minions scurrying around trying to undermine Social Security.</p>
<p>We can and should debate the merits of various Social Security plans, whether that be D-O or LMS or Arne&#8217;s. But let us not fool ourselves that the current environment supports a true &#8216;Bi-Partisan Commission on Social Security&#8217; that would allow Arne&#8217;s or Coberly&#8217;s or certainly my plans to be debated in good faith. Because the sellers of crisis led by Cato, AEI, Concord and the various PGP organizations have sold all Republicans and most if not all of the Blue Dog and DLC Democrats on the notion that &#8220;Something has to be done, and sooner better than later, about Social Security&#8221;. &#8220;Nothing&#8221; is not a perfect plan but currently is a hell of a lot better than all the &#8220;Somethings&#8221; actually out there in the policy arena.</p>
<p>It is often said that the &#8220;Best Defense is a Good Offense&#8221;. Well not always, not if you are leaving a secure position and running right up hill in the face of the guns, you can ask how that worked for General Pickett at Cemetary Ridge or for  Lord Cardigan at Balaclava, and that even though the opposition was fighting according to the rules, something that really can&#8217;t be said to be happening in the continuing seventy plus guerilla war to kill Social Security using all necessary means.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know of a single Democratic policy maker on either the Congressional or Administration side that has openly come out and embraced a Social Security solution that relies on some combination of taxes and targeted growth policy that would deliver a Coberly or Arne outcome of fully funded benfits without abandonment of the current insurance model. At best we have plans that attempt to address the projected gap in a purportedly progressive way via a cap increase. Until we can get people to understand that &#8220;Nothing&#8221; is better than the existing proposed &#8220;Somethings&#8221; then I am a little hesitant to open a door to those who reject &#8220;Nothing&#8221; out of hand, and whose starting position is just as hard as Bush&#8217;s insistence that PRAs and no taxes have to be included in the governing guidelines. The other side of this has consistently asserted that we have to fight this fight on their conceptual ground under their rules of engagement which ALWAYS start from a presumption of benefit cuts as the &#8216;sensible centrist&#8217; thing to do. I am not willing to accept that as a point of departure.</p>
<p>In the current environment &#8216;Bi-partisanship&#8217; equates to &#8216;We are all Blue Dogs now!&#8217;. Well no, this Yellow Dog Democrat may vote for a Blue Dog in the interest of a Democratic majority if given no other choice. But I have no intent of changing coats and just turning my back on the New Deal in the ways the Blues demand.</p>

<p>Megan McArdle Knows Galileo Was Waaay Over-rated</p>
<p>As many long-time readers know, I&#8217;m working (with a co-author) on a book that looks at a bunch of different series &#8211; from abortion to crime to the unwed motherhood &#8211; and how they evolved over the administrations from Ike to GW.  Since both I and my co-author have a special interest in economics, about half the book covers economic topics &#8211; from economic growth to the national debt.  FWIW, I hope to have an announcement about the book soon as I just signed a contract and dropped it off at the mail. </p>
<p>One thing we&#8217;ve found &#8211; and this also should be no surprise to long-time readers &#8211; is that Democrats generally outperform Republicans on economic issues.  So I was interested in this quote by Megan McArdle a couple weeks ago:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>But I expect that four years from now, we&#8217;ll still be having the same conversations with proponents of &#8220;cancer clusters&#8221; and Democrats convinced that they can scientifically prove that Democrats are better for GDP by doing ham-fisted regressions of Democratic presidencies with a few tightly correlated economic variables.  What&#8217;s the mechanism?  What makes electric power lines cause cancer, but not the earth&#8217;s vastly more powerful magnetic field?  What policies did Harry Truman and Bill Clinton have in common (but not with Richard Nixon) that caused this marvelous confluence?  Well, maybe we don&#8217;t know the mechanism exactly, but never you mind:  just look at that bee-yoo-ti-ful correlation!</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve been swamped, so I kind of forgot about it, until until I saw that quote <a href="http://newmarksdoor.typepad.com/mainblog/2009/04/department-of-awful-statistics.html">referenced approvingly</a> elsewhere.   Anyway, I don&#8217;t know the first thing about cancer clusters, so I won&#8217;t comment on that at all, but I do know something about that other issue.</p>
<p>FWIW, in our book, we do discuss the mechanism, but only in passing.  Our book&#8217;s purpose is to provide an over-view of what actually happened so explanations of &#8220;why&#8221; &#8211; while there &#8211; are necessarily limited.  There&#8217;s only so much that can be covered without making a book that is four volumes long that nobody will read.   Still, we do try to explain why economic performance skews the way it does.  </p>
<p>For what its worth, and I don&#8217;t want to think too far ahead because I&#8217;m swamped, but I have in a mind a second book that is about nothing but the mechanism.  <br />(cactus says turn the page)</p>
<p>But in my opinion,  macroeconomics is not a science, and won&#8217;t be for a long time, precisely because many practitioners  spend too much time on the mechanism and not on observing what happened.   For example, the &#8220;supply side&#8221; story, mechanism and all, makes perfect sense.  Its simple.  Its elegant.   In fact, its beautiful.  I like it.  But it doesn&#8217;t match the data in the US.  And most of the supply side success stories to which we were treated in the past few years &#8211; the small eastern European countries, the Celtic Tiger, and Iceland &#8211; all rank up there as this decade&#8217;s Argentina now.   And remember, there was a time that Argentina looked good too, and the same cast of characters was talking them up too.  All of which is to say&#8230; the supply side story is sensible, simple, elegant and useless.  Absolutely and completely useless.  </p>
<p>For macroeconomics to one day aspire to be science, it has to begin to function like sicence.  And science doesn&#8217;t start with a story, however pretty.  It starts with observation.  Tycho Brahe spent decades observing and cataloging movements of the &#8220;heavenly bodies.&#8221;  Eventually, he proposed a model of the solar system.  It was wrong, but it was an attempt to explain what he had observed.    But it all started with observation.   And though his observations form one of the building blocks of modern astronomy, Brahe had no mechanism.  None.  </p>
<p>Kepler, Brahe&#8217;s assistant, stared at these decades of observation and somehow boiled it all down to three simple laws of planetary motion that are still taught today in high school physics.   To call that an amazing feat is to understate the accomplishment.  But Kepler couldn&#8217;t give Megan McArdle a mechanism because he never figured one out. </p>
<p>And then there was Galileo.   Many physicists consider him to the first modern scientist; he experimented, he observed, and he laid down, among other things, laws of motion that help form the basis for modern physics.   But he didn&#8217;t have a mechanism.  He understood how bodies moved, but not exactly why they moved the way they do.  And while he didn&#8217;t have a mechanism, the prevailing, er,  theory at the time had one.  And proponents of that mechanism felt that Galileo&#8217;s theory, based on observation, contradicted their mechanism, and boy did that cause Galileo no end of trouble.   But as far as advancing science is concerned, Galileo&#8217;s observation are far more important than his persecutors&#8217; mechanism.</p>
<p>If my knowledge of physics was better, I could go on to the present day.  And while my knowledge of biology is as superficial as my knowledge of physics, I know its the same story there.  Darwin started with observation, the Theory of Evolution, the mechanism, came later.   And its the same story in most areas of human endeavor.   And not all the great work was done by giants.  Galileo may have been a genius, but Brahe&#8217;s contribution came from having the patience to observe and observe and observe some more, taking precise and careful notes all the while.</p>
<p>So the focus on a mechanism, quite frankly, is misguided, when there is not even agreement about what the facts actually are.    Mechanisms matter, but facts are paramount.  And I say that as someone who has in mind a second book that is all about the mechanism for why some Presidents outperformed others.    I&#8217;ll give you an obvious example of lack of grounding in the facts.  McArdle asks:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>What policies did Harry Truman and Bill Clinton have in common (but not with Richard Nixon) that caused this marvelous confluence?</p></blockquote>
<p>But that question is simply wrong.   McArdle may as well be asking why a fish is like four wheel drive but not a liquor store.  Truman is the one Democratic President who Republicans seem to adore.  GW compared himself to Truman.  Sarah Palin compared herself to Truman.   Right wing blogs write favorable things about Truman.  Could I possibly have replaced Truman&#8217;s name in the previous sentence with Clinton&#8217;s, or Carter&#8217;s, or FDR&#8217;s?  </p>
<p>Additionally, <a rhef="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/TableView.asp?SelectedTable=253&#038;ViewSeries=NO&#038;Java=no&#038;Request3Place=N&#038;3Place=N&#038;FromView=YES&#038;Freq=Year&#038;FirstYear=1929&#038;LastYear=2008&#038;3Place=N&#038;Update=Update&#038;JavaBox=no#Mid">data on real GDP per capita</a> is available since 1929.    There were fourteen Presidents between 1929 and 2008, the last year for which we have data, six Democrats and eight Republicans.  All the Democrats except one, Harry Truman, are in the top half of the sample.  Truman is actually second from the bottom, right above Hoover.  (Rankings <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/10/ranking-presidents-on-real-economic.html">here</a>.)</p>
<p>So&#8230;  McArdle&#8217;s question should be a different one.  It should be:  </p>
<p>
<blockquote>What policies did Harry Truman and George Bush (either one) have in common (but not with Bill Clinton) that caused this not so marvelous confluence?</p></blockquote>
<p>There&#8217;s also the question of whether Truman was a special case, what with presiding over the transition at the end of World War 2.   But then again, that transition, that might also have been what precipitated actions that more closely resembled those that would have taken by George Bush (either one) than Bill Clinton.  </p>
<p>Anyway, I think I have the answer to these more relevant questions.  And I think I know the mechanism by which the answer works.   But the first step is always knowing what the data says.</p>
<p>In McArdle&#8217;s post, she points out that often one can find correlations between unrelated things.  As my econometrics professor used to say, there are artifacts in the data.   But here&#8217;s a tip for McArdle:  don&#8217;t stop when you see a pattern in data.  Look at a lot of data, try to find similar data, perhaps from other places or other times.   Because sometimes what looks like patterns disappear with a bit more data, or another way of looking at things.    But sometimes, they don&#8217;t.  And if the pattern doesn&#8217;t go away, but it still doesn&#8217;t match your mechanism, then the mechanism is wrong.<br />________________________________<br />by cactus</p>

<p>Well, there you go.  And all that fuss for naught.  (bolding is mine)</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1890560,00.html">Time CNN</a> declares:</p>
<blockquote><p>Investors find it disconcerting to see the stocks in the huge financial institutions that are at the foundation of the global capital system trading up and down 25% a day, and, in some cases trading in the pennies. Banks became the visible and ugly wound that reminded Wall St. each day that it had torn down what it spent decades building, which was a money-making machine driven by leverage and the cleverest synthetic financial instruments the world has ever seen. </p>
<p><em>Wells Fargo’s big profits, and what that means for the financial system</em></p>
<p>But, <strong>the great banking crisis of 2008 is over</strong>. It began last September 15 when Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy and bottomed when Citigroup (C) traded below $1 last month. Most analysts believe that mortgage-backed securities which included packages of subprime home loans failed when mortgage default rates went up and housing prices raced down. That is only partially true. Banks made a tremendous series of ill-advised loans to private equity firms, hedge funds, commercial real estate holders, and the average man with a credit card balance which he cannot pay. (See pictures of the top 10 scared traders.)</p>
<p>When people look back on the near-collapse of the banking system they may say that the Congress and Henry Paulson threw enough money into the path of the oncoming failure of the credit system to slow it down so that the government could properly go through the process of guaranteeing parts of the balance sheets of firms including Citigroup (C) and Bank of America (BAC). The initial TARP may also have provided time for the new Administration to put together its widely hailed bank &#8220;stress test&#8221; program meant to determine which of the big financial institutions have dysentery and which do not. Finally, the hundreds of billions of dollars that went into the largest banks late last year allowed Secretary Geithner to produce his public/private partnership to buy toxic assets off of bank balance sheets. </p>
<p>All of those plans, no matter how well-intentioned they may seem, are unnecessary now. Wells Fargo (WFC) indicated that it made about $3 billion in the first quarter of the year and declared its buyout of the deeply troubled Wachovia to be a success. Wells Fargo (WFC) said that the low cost of money from the government combined with a surging demand for mortgages was all the medicine that it required. </p>
<p>Banks stocks reacted to the news, which took the markets completely by surprise, by driving up Wells Fargo&#8217;s stock by 32%. Bank of America (BAC) shares jumped 35%. </p>
<p>Oddly absent from the discussion of how well Wells Fargo did is why the government was in the midst of testing bank balance sheets at all. The experts at the Treasury had been thrown off the scent and consequently had missed the fact that there was not need to test what is already working well. The same holds true for the Geithner plan to take toxic assets off bank balance sheets. It is academic now. What banks are earning from the difference between the cost of capital and the income from lending is now great enough for the banking system to be self-sustaining again.</p></blockquote>

<p><a target="_blank" href="http://econospeak.blogspot.com/2009/04/on-sanctity-of-contracts.html">Michael Perelman</a> reminds us of the propaganda involved in selling the way the bailout is happening.</p>
<p>Brenda Rosser said in comments&#8230; </p>
<blockquote><p>This article appears to be thinly-disguised propaganda. An attempt to sell &#8216;the regulators&#8217; (like Larry Summers, Geithner and Bair) as having a serious intention to rein in the excesses of the large banks.</p>
<p>When you read:<br />&#8220;Government officials do not plan to disclose the results for individual banks but may reveal broad results for the entire industry at the end of the month. … Stephanie Cutter, a spokeswoman at the Treasury Department, said it did not comment about the participation of specific banks in the plan or their efforts to exit the program..</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;the stress tests of the 19 biggest banks, due to be completed in the next three weeks&#8230;.. If the test indicates that the losses would leave a bank with too little capital, the bank will have six months to either raise extra money from private investors or get money from the government&#8221;</p>
<p>Wow! Wouldn&#8217;t we like a deal like that for our house and personal debts!</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the REAL crux of the article:</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;.the new $500 billion to $1 trillion plan that will use public subsidies to encourage private investors to buy mortgage assets. the government’s bailout fund is dwindling, putting the administration in a bind. It is all but certain to need to seek more money from Congress, which wants to see results from existing programs first. The fund is down to its final $134 billion, according to Treasury officials, and is expected to face new requests for money in the coming weeks&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>More and more money. No results apparent after already having spent trillions of public money. Meanwhile thos big welfare-dependent banks are buying up public water assets, land, businesses etc overseas . And they still feel confident enough to object to limits on executive pay etc.</p>
<p>If the above isn&#8217;t a sign of gutless public regulators I don&#8217;t know what is.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>Ken Houghton notes that no one has stolen my ID or shifted my sense of politics or the economy.</p>
<p>Brad DeLong has been running excerpts from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2009/02/bush-oral-history200902?printable=true&#038;currentPage=all">the February 2009 <em>Vanity Fair</em> &#8220;Oral History&#8221; of the Bush White House</a>. Time and priorities being what they are, I didn&#8217;t get a chance to read the whole piece until today—coincidentally, right after <a target="_blank" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/04/12/krugman-on-stress-tests-s_n_185947.html">Paul Krugman said that Larry Summers</a><br />
<blockquote>&#8220;is right&#8221; in his assessment that the sense of the economy falling of the table was likely ending.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now, Krugman went on to qualify this, <a target="_blank" href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/04/08/the-bounce-and-the-revision-thing/">in the same manner, though with less clear terms, as he did on his blog last Wednesday</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Many will herald this as the end of our problems. But they’ll be wrong, for reasons I laid out during an earlier false dawn, back in early 2002 (the unemployment rate continued to rise for more than a year after that point)&#8230;.[long, well worth reading but not anywhere close to excerptable for &#8220;fair use&#8221; example omitted]&#8230; I wanted to include a graph to go with this post, illustrating what happened in 2002. And guess what: that surge in output in early 2002 has been <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/TableView.asp?SelectedTable=1&#038;ViewSeries=NO&#038;Java=no&#038;Request3Place=N&#038;3Place=N&#038;FromView=YES&#038;Freq=Qtr&#038;FirstYear=2000&#038;LastYear=2008&#038;3Place=N&#038;Update=Update&#038;JavaBox=no#Mid">revised out of existence</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>So Krugman may believe that this is a &#8220;false dawn,&#8221; but affirms that the worst is probably over.</p>
<p>Contrast that with Hank Paulson&#8217;s comment in the <em>Vanity Fair</em> piece:<br />
<blockquote>This’ll be the longest we’ve gone in recent history without there being turmoil, and given all the innovation in the private pools of capital and the over-the-counter derivatives and the excesses around the world, we figured that when there was turmoil, and these things were tested for the first time by stress, it would be more significant than anything else.</p>
<p>I said at the time, I have a concern that every rally we’re going to have in the financial markets will be a false rally until we break the back of the price correction in real estate. And these things are never over until you have a couple of institutions go that surprise everyone. Bear Stearns can hardly be a shock.</p>
<p>But having said that, it’s one thing to see it intellectually and it’s another to see where we are.[italics mine]</p></blockquote>
<p>The &#8220;couple of institutions&#8221; to &#8220;go&#8221; still hasn&#8217;t happened.</p>

                                <p>Who runs the government?<br />by Stormy</p>
<p>Why, K Street, of course. A recent <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/04/11/AR2009041102035.html?hpid=moreheadlines" target="_blank">study</a> claims that for every dollar spent in lobbying, corporate returns reap $220 in benefits. And what companies have seen the best bang for the lobbying buck?<br />
<blockquote>The largest recipients of tax breaks were concentrated in the pharmaceutical and technology fields, including Pfizer, Merck, Hewlett Packard, Johnson &#038; Johnson and IBM. Pfizer alone repatriated $37 billion, representing 70 percent of its revenue in 2004, the study found. The now-beleaguered financial industry also benefited from the provision, including Citigroup, J.P. Morgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch, all of which have since received tens of billions of dollars in federal bailout money. </p></blockquote>
<p>And just how exactly has the 2004 Job Creation Act fared. [No guessing allowed.]</p>
<p>Dismally, of course.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;the Congressional Research Service and others have since found that <i>many companies cut jobs in the wake of the tax break and that nearly all the money was used for stock buybacks or dividends.</i> Supporters failed in a bid to include a similar tax break in this year&#8217;s stimulus legislation, and a Senate subcommittee has launched an investigation into how companies used their tax savings under the 2004 program.</p>
<p>The provision was championed in part by the Homeland Investment Coalition, a group of companies and trade associations that was formed to push for the repatriation holiday. The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), one of the disbanded coalition&#8217;s members, said in a statement Friday that &#8220;repatriation of profits provided a new source of investment for American companies.&#8221;<br />[Italics mine.]</p></blockquote>
<p>Congressional research may be fine and dandy, but Congressional loopholes and K Street direct the candy.</p>
<p>And let&#8217;s have a hand of applause for our wise corporate leaders whose advertising delights us hourly.</p>
<p>And we should never forget those Congressional and administrative leaders whose sonorous tones and Election Day promises never fail to amuse.</p>
<p>Posturing has become such a fine art that America should consider it as one of its great gifts to the world.</p>
<p>Update: Michael Hirsch in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/193360">Newsweek</a> reports that a newly formed group called &#8220;Coalition for Business Finance Reform&#8221; has been formed. The group comprises those very firms that brought us Financial Disaster. There avowed purpose: &#8220;To stand against heavy regulation of &#8216;over-the-counter&#8217; derivatives.&#8221;<br />
<blockquote>Whereas once these trades went totally unregulated, Geithner would require that they be &#8220;reported to trade repositories and be subject to robust standards&#8221; for documenting and collateralizing, among other new rules.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s unlikely this will do much to change Wall Street. Geithner&#8217;s new rules would allow the over-the-counter market to boom again, orchestrated by global giants that will continue to be &#8220;too big to fail&#8221; (they may have to be rescued again someday, in other words). And most of it will still occur largely out of sight of regulated exchanges. The response favored by the administration, the Federal Reserve and even many in Congress is to create a new all-knowing &#8220;systemic risk regulator&#8221; with as-yet-undetermined powers. Is such a person sitting at 30,000 feet really going to be able to keep up with all this onrushing complexity, especially as over-the-counter trading resumes in quiet places around the world?
