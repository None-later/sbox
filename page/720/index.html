<p>The famous reporter, critic, and free thinker H.L. Mencken used to write thundering tirades against the “booboisie” who ran the country, sometimes describing them as witless and uncultured.  As I read the stuttering, almost incomprehensible mumblings of President Bush as he gave advice to the public on how to use credit, I thought of Mencken.  Where are the sharp harpoons when the whales are spouting to starboard?</p>
<p>In the frantic race to appear benevolent that is being waged between Congress and the President, the President may be pulling ahead.  First there was $75 billion bid by Sen. Clinton, then later $150 billion by another candidate, and now rumors fly that the President would not be averse to a fiscal spending spree of $250 billion.  Why not a $ trillion? </p>
<p>And why isn’t Mr. Bernanke getting any praise for his massive Fed rate cut?  Where’s the love?  Maybe lower interest rates too complex for the public to grasp, the “lesser booboisie” we have educated to think credit cards were oars on their economic boats.  Mr. Bernanke should get Gov. Huckabee to explain this stuff in his next sermon.  He could start with, “Drunks don’t have to sober up unless the liquor runs out!” and go on from there to calm the masses.</p>
<p>For a nation riddled like Swiss cheese by its obstinate unwillingness to save, show restraint in spending, or raise its hand to preserve its own economy from its competition, we now have to face the facts.  Only love can lead us higher.  (Was that Marvin Gaye?)</p>
<p>I can just hear the talk over Courvoisier brandy tonight beside the fireplace in Davos’ snowy Swiss slopes.  That’s where the financial movers and shakers of the Planet Earth go to decide how the world is going to work for another year.   Bill, Dmitri, Arvind, Wei Li, and Paulo are getting their stories straight.  During the week, you’ll be told that all that excess credit is feeding homeless children in Africa, and the losses in banks will have to be covered by taxpaying booboisie around the world.  You will hear not a word about “overspending” or “loose lending” pass their lips.   </p>
<p>About all you get will be equivalent to the tip they leave their room stewards.  Look for that Treasury check in the Spring.  But what heart can measure Love merely based on zeros?</p>

Posts on the issue have argued the point. A quick review of this source looked reasonable, but needs a more careful study. There are better minds to do this than I, but offer the study for review. (Hat tip to Scent of Violets). I haven&#8217;t the time, but appreciate a look.</p>
<blockquote><p>In the late 1950s, the late Democratic Senator Estes Kefauver, Chairman of the United States Senate&#8217;s Anti-Trust and Monopoly Subcommittee, put together the first extensive indictment against the business workings of the pharmaceutical industry. He laid three charges at the door of the industry: (1) Patents sustained predatory prices and excessive margins; (2) Costs and prices were extravagantly increased by large expenditures in marketing; and (3) Most of the industry&#8217;s new products were no more effective than established drugs on the market [1]. Kefauver&#8217;s indictment against a marketing-driven industry created a representation of the pharmaceutical industry far different than the one offered by the industry itself. As Froud and colleagues put it, the image of life-saving “researchers in white coats” was now contested by the one of greedy “reps in cars” [2]. The outcome of the struggle over the image of the industry is crucial because of its potential to influence the regulatory environment in which the industry operates.</p>
<p>Fifty years later, the debate still continues between these two depictions of the industry. The absence of reliable data on the industry&#8217;s cost structures allows partisans on both sides of the debate to cite figures favorable to their own positions. The amount of money spent by pharmaceutical companies on promotion compared to the amount spent on research and development is at the heart of the debate, especially in the United States. A reliable estimate of the former is needed to bridge the divide between the industry&#8217;s vision of research-driven, innovative, and life-saving pharmaceutical companies and the critics&#8217; portrayal of an industry based on marketing-driven profiteering.</p>
<p>IMS, a firm specializing in pharmaceutical market intelligence, is usually considered to be the authority for assessing pharmaceutical promotion expenditures. The US General Accounting Office, for example, refers to IMS numbers in concluding that “pharmaceutical companies spend more on research and development initiatives than on all drug promotional activities” [3]. Based on the data provided by IMS [4], the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), an American industrial lobby group for research-based pharmaceutical companies, also contends that pharmaceutical firms spend more on research and development (R&#038;D) than on marketing: US$29.6 billion on R&#038;D in 2004 in the US [5] as compared to US$27.7 billion for all promotional activities.[4]</p>
<p>In this paper, we make the case for the need for a new estimate of promotional expenditures.<br />&#8230;<br />From this new estimate, it appears that pharmaceutical companies spend almost twice as much on promotion as they do on R&#038;D. These numbers clearly show how promotion predominates over R&#038;D in the pharmaceutical industry, contrary to the industry&#8217;s claim. While the amount spent on promotion is not in itself a confirmation of Kefauver&#8217;s depiction of the pharmaceutical industry, it confirms the public image of a marketing-driven industry and provides an important argument to petition in favor of transforming the workings of the industry in the direction of more research and less promotion.</p></blockquote>

<p>This site is ahead of the curve. In his <a href="http://www.rgemonitor.com/blog/roubini/239255">latest piece</a> Professor Roubini includes a remark from Yu Yong, director of Chinese Academy of Sciences of Social Sciences and former director of China&#8217;s central bank. As I have said before, the Chinese Academy of Sciences plays a pivotal role in directing Chinese economic policy.<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;China&#8217;s reliance on external demand is tremendous. If there is weakness in the world economy, the impact on the Chinese economy will be very serious so we must do our best to stimulate the domestic market.&#8221; </p></blockquote>
<p>China is not ready to be a consumer society. Its consumption of raw materials for infrastructure is enormous. Its consumption of finished goods&#8211;despite its huge population&#8211;is very modest compared to that of the U.S.</p>
<p>In allowing FDI to use it as an export platform while not sufficiently protecting its own labor force, China is now at the mercy of a severe economic downturn in the U.S. A more coherent Chinese policy would have been to allow labor to bargain&#8230;to bring its labor force up the wage ladder more quickly so that it would have a consumer base.</p>
<p>A command economy can make serious mistakes. But my point, again, is about labor. Everything is connected. There is risk attached to focusing only on infrastructure. There is a risk in relying on a consumer deep in debt. There is a profound risk in relying only exports. All this applies to China.</p>
<p>Equally, there is a profound risk in being just a consumer, going deeper and deeper in debt. And there is a profound risk in not properly overseeing (ahem regulating) your financial system.</p>
<p>Neither a command economy nor a deregulated economy is the answer. Somewhere in between, perhaps?</p>
<p>The U.S. consumer is now tapped out.</p>
<p>I bet the central banks everywhere are in a huddle on what to do next.</p>
<p>We are in for one hell of a ride.</p>

                                <p>Here is <a href="http://one-salient-oversight.blogspot.com/2008/01/another-prediction.html">One Salient Oversight</a> (quoting himself in comments at Economist&#8217;s View):</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m very unhappy with the rate cut. Like Fred, I think Higher interest rates are needed but the reason I have is the incipient inflationary pressure building up because of the low dollar.</p>
<p>Of course, there is the question of whether or not the deflationary effects of a potential recession will counteract the inflationary effects of a lower dollar. History has shown us that nations with plummeting currencies end up having both a recession and an outbreak of inflation at the same time. It happened in South America and it happened in Asia and it happened in Russia.</p>
<p>The difference between the regions just mentioned and the situation in America as its stands is that the devaluing of currencies was essentially what caused their recessions. In America&#8217;s case, however, a recession was already brewing. The plummeting dollar results from this problem, and will exacerbate it.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m not 100% in agreement with this last point&#8230; my opinion, having lived through a big part of the mess in South America, is that there was something of a feedback loop going on between inflation and devaluation.  Recessions were sometimes part of the mix, sometimes not.  </p>
<p>One Salient Oversight continues&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>At some point in the next three months, inflation indicators will begin to get quite loud. At that point everyone will be confused and say &#8220;why do we have inflation AND a recession&#8221;? Of course Americans are not used to the inflationary effects of a plummeting currency, which means that analysis has been blinkered. American analysts and economists, unused to experiencing inflationary conditions, have completely factored out the inflationary effect of the Fed&#8217;s rate cut. When it is realised that America is actually no different to the rest of the world and that the basic laws of economic activity actually DO apply to America as well, there will be a clamour of activity arguing that higher inflation is justified in order to keep the markets running and people in jobs. A minority of economists and commentators will invoke Paul Volcker and the rate increases of the early 1980s as evidence that inflation needs to be conquered first, but then the pro-inflation majority will probably argue that the fundamental laws of economics has changed and blah blah blah.</p></blockquote>
<p>A small quibble here too&#8230; the US still is different from the rest of the world, at least as long as the dollar is different from the rest of the world&#8217;s currencies.   The dollar may be less different now, and perhaps may be becoming even less different as time goes on, but for various reasons, thre is still a difference.  That said, when the dollar was much more, well, different, such as in the late 1960s and early 1970s, it wasn&#8217;t enough to prevent some inflation&#8230; even before the Oil Embargo.  And years and years of cheap money plus the added cherry on top the other day have to show up somewhere sometime, and inflation is the somewhere.  Hopefully the sometime won&#8217;t be any time soon.</p>
<p>He goes on:</p>
<blockquote><p>A stimulus plan from congress will go ahead but will actually do little in stopping the recession and will have an inflationary effect. At some point after the election, Bernanke will either resign or be sacked.</p>
<p>I also predict that at some point the Fed will realise what is happening and increase rates to kill off inflation. This will cause a double-dip recession.</p></blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t know about Bernanke suffering consequences, but I agree that whatever tax cut nonsense Congress and the Preznit cook up ain&#8217;t gonna do diddly to end the recession.  And if inflation starts to rear its ugly head, I have to assume Bernanke and company are smart enough to realize it cut back on their monetary policy&#8230; belatedly.  And yes&#8230; that could make it worse.  Even methadone has its withdrawal symptoms.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d08312t.pdf">The GAO</a> reports on the inability to measure small amounts of toxins in the Great Lakes that can cause harm. The same is true, as described in other posts, for unborns and babies.   Is this a worthy function of government to oversee, water and babies being crucial also to us?  How would a free market handle this? </p>
<p>&#8220;In 1990, following a series of binational agreements aimed at improving<br />environmental conditions in the Great Lakes Basin, the Congress passed<br />the Great Lakes Critical Programs Act. This act, which amended the Clean<br />Water Act, required the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to<br />publish water quality guidance on minimum water quality standards and<br />antidegradation policies for protecting existing water quality. In response,<br />in 1995, EPA published the Final Water Quality Guidance for the Great<br />Lakes System, otherwise known as the GLI, to control over 100 toxic<br />pollutants and protect aquatic life, wildlife, and human health. Through the<br />GLI, EPA established stringent water quality criteria—numeric values to<br />be used by states to set pollutant discharge limits for point sources—for 9<br />BCCs and 20 other pollutants found in the basin. In addition, the GLI<br />established methodologies that the states are to use in developing criteria<br />for the remaining pollutants. Meeting the criteria established by GLI<br />requires sensitive analytical methods that allow measurement of pollutant<br />concentrations at or below the level established by GLI water quality<br />&#8230;<br />The ability to accurately and reliably measure pollutant concentrations is<br />vital to successfully implementing GLI water quality criteria. Without this<br />ability, it is difficult for states to determine if a facility’s discharge is<br />exceeding GLI water quality criteria and if a discharge limits are required.<br />For example, because chlordane has a water quality criterion of 0.25<br />nanograms per liter but can only be measured down to a level of 14<br />nanograms per liter, it cannot always be determined if the pollutant is<br />exceeding the criterion. As we reported in 2005, developing the analytical<br />methods needed to measure pollutants at the GLI water quality criteria<br />level is a significant challenge to fully achieving GLI goals. Although<br />methods have been developed for the nine BCCs for which GLI water<br />quality criteria have been established, EPA has only approved the methods<br />to measure mercury and lindane below GLI’s stringent criteria levels.<br />Analytical methods for the other BCCs either have not received EPA<br />approval or cannot be used to reliably measure to GLI criteria levels.<br />criteria.&#8221;</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>With all the recent talk about combating the supposed oncoming recession, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/23/us/politics/23campaign.html?_r=1&#038;ref=politics&#038;oref=slogin"> Adam Nagourney</a> ponders whose candidacies this will help most and suggests this will help Romney and Clinton.  Why Romney?  Well I guess the public thinks a business background means one makes great economic decisions (banging my head against the wall).  And Senator Clinton was First Lady when Bill Clinton convened and actually listened to some very good economic advice (more on this later).  </p>
<p>Nagourney notes that some Republicans want fiscal stimulus in the form of tax cuts, while some Democrats want more government spending.  Senator Obama’s call for tax rebates has me wondering whose nomination he is really seeking.  As we talk about deficit financing, we should give <a href="http://voxbaby.blogspot.com/2008/01/fiscal-stimulus-we-dont-need-no.html">Andrew Samwick</a> some time at the microphone:</p>
<blockquote><p>Forget the &#8220;stimulus&#8221; label, this is merely additional deficit spending. There is no discussion of repaying the money through higher taxes in the near term. Based on the President&#8217;s remarks this morning, the deficit bill will be for about $150 billion. So this proposal is just another $150 billion of some future generations&#8217; resources that we will be using for our own consumption today. Why are we entitled to pass them this additional debt?</p></blockquote>
<p>But then there’s RUDY who may sort of be listening to Dr. Samwick:</p>
<blockquote><p>Former Mayor Rudolph W. Guiliani of New York was more sketchy as he answered questions about how he would handle the financial upheaval. Addressing a reporter he knew from New York, he pointed to his experience as mayor in suggesting that he was prepared to handle the crisis, but offered no details on what he thought should be in a stimulus package, or what taxes should be cut.  “Congress and the president should do a stimulus package and they should do a spending reduction package,” he said. “You’re familiar with that; we used to do that in New York.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Cutting government spending is not demand stimulus.  Of course, RUDY wants to cut taxes but does he not get the <a href="http://www.economyprofessor.com/economictheories/balanced-budget-multiplier.php">balanced budget multiplier</a>, which basically says that if we cut government spending by the same amount as we reduce taxes, then aggregate demand will decline.  </p>
<p>OK, back to the Clinton era of Rubinomics where the policy dilemma was how to cut the deficit but also stimulate aggregate demand.  One idea, which I’d hope someone might float, might be to accelerate government spending programs but not increase long-term government spending.  We might also try to backload any tax increases.  The idea would be to move the sum of private and public consumption forward as we promise to those who are making investment decisions that we will get our fiscal house in order and hopefully later increase national savings.  That might actually encourage investment rather than crowd it out.  </p>
<p>Andrew Samwick is not alone in his disdain for fiscal stimulus as the primary tool for increasing aggregate demand as <a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/">Greg Mankiw</a> has had several excellent posts on why we should be relying more on monetary policy.  Greg even found a 1994 quote from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Peddling-Prosperity-Economic-Diminished-Expectations/dp/0393312925">Paul Krugman</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>When monetary expansion is ineffective, fiscal expansion&#8230;must take its place. Such a fiscal expansion can break the vicious circle of low spending and low incomes, &#8220;priming the pump&#8221; and getting the economy moving again. But remember this is no by any means an all-purpose policy recommendation; it is essentially a strategy of desperation, a dangerous drug to be prescribed only when the usual over-the-counter remedy of monetary policy has failed.</p></blockquote>
<p>A dangerous drug indeed and if we took the medicine prescribed by Dr. RUDY, it would have the opposite of what is the desired effect.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2008/01/tim-duy-adding.html?cid=98220098#comment-98220098">Tim Duy</a> gives an interesting post on The Economist&#8217;s View. His response to Movie Guy is instructive. I had a follow-up response, which I include here with a little elaboration.</p>
<p>Tim does acknowledge that our reliance on foreign production will be difficult to correct. The payscale differences are enormous. The differences between our respective protection of labor and the environment is equally enormous. These difference feed the trade imbalances, which in turn affects the balance of payments, requiring ever greater official inflows into our coffers. The growing power of Sovereign Wealth Funds in China, the Middle East, and elsewhere is a potentially dangerous side effect.</p>
<p>The view that trade is at the center of our problem is not a mainstream view. Globalization and unrestricted trade were to raise all boats: Manufacturing jobs lost to developing countries were to be replaced with higher skilled jobs. Unfortunately, those skilled jobs are disappearing as well. See <a href="http://beijingman.blogspot.com/2008/01/wow-beijing-prices.html">BeijingMan&#8217;s</a> for a good understanding of those pay scales are in Beijing. Remember, elsewhere in China, those wages will be considerably lower.</p>
<p>What we have seen so far? The U.S. has been the primary consumer, even as its trade deficit and private and public debt grow. We now have consumers that produce little and producers that consume almost nothing. (I do acknowledge that China has a vast appetite for raw materials as it builds its infrastructure. But as a consumer of finished goods&#8211;not much. And I do not expect it to be in the short term&#8211;maybe by 2030.)</p>
<p>For a while, our financial system was touted as a wonder, the key to our future success. (I guess we all were supposed to be become bankers and investors. Many physicists did.) Well, that system is caput. We failed to make our financial system transparent; we failed to be good stewards of our banks and investment firms.</p>
<p>My point, plain and simple, is: Globalization as presently practiced has been laced with real peril. As Americans, we have yet to appreciate fully the problems yet to come. Whether the stock market rebounds today or tomorrow is not the problem. I let more skilled commentators do that forecasting. Nouriel Roubini has been consistently on target in this area.</p>
<p>We are in the position of stimulating that tapped out American consumer one more time. This time, the consumer will use the government&#8217;s credit card, not his own. Our national debt consequently grows by 1% of GDP&#8211;all in a month.</p>
<p><i>What will the American consumer buy?</i> Foreign goods, of course. This stimulus package is for the world as much as it is for us. If we do not understand this fact, we are in deep trouble.</p>
<p>This stimulus package does not address the central underlying problems, problems that are deeper than a poorly regulated and almost opaque financial system.</p>
<p>Trade is at the center of our problem. Trade is a tricky business. Off shoring, outsourcing, subcontracting elsewhere in order to increase profitability, while understandable, can create real problems if there is already enormous disparities between those countries that lose the jobs and those countries that gain them. (Check out the pay disparities up and down the line&#8211;I have done so repeatedly.)</p>
<p>These dislocations and disparities many economists have all too quickly ignored or glossed over in their celebration of globalization. Those who raise the problems are dismissed as protectionists or uncaring. I am neither a protectionist nor uncaring.</p>
<p>We cannot simply make China et al the manufacturing and production centers of the world as quickly as we have done. More thought should have been given to the process, more attention given to the issues. Please note the modifier <i>quickly.</i></p>
<p>Lest I still be foolishly accused of being protectionist, let me say again I am not. No straw men, please; my position is far more complicated than that silliness.</p>
<p>Third world, impoverished countries with populations as large as China&#8217;s cannot move with lightning speed into a world economy already dominated by wealthy nations. When we mindlessly toss in other impoverished nations, the danger grows.</p>
<p>Trade works best among equals. When there is vast inequality, plan&#8230;plan. Check the details. NAFTA has been a mistake of monumental proportions simply because we were not careful. No care was taken concerning labor and the environment; no real care was given regarding Mexico&#8217;s agricultural firms. The vast tide of illegal Mexican labor should alert us to NAFTA&#8217;s dangerous shortcomings.</p>
<p>The dangers of such disparities have not been fully acknowledged. Other than at AngryBear, I have found no discussion or understanding of China&#8217;s blueprint for the future, of its very realistic expectations. The CAS (Chinese Academy of Science) has clearly stated its payscale expectations&#8211;and when it expects to achieve them. I have discussed these issues repeatedly on AngryBear. If you want a link, use Google on AngryBear.</p>
<p>It is folly to expect one nation to be the consumer of last resort and poor nations to be the primary producers. While the goal of economic equality among all nations is laudable and desirable, we must look carefully at the process by which we achieve this goal. Simple protectionism is counterproductive.</p>
<p>The issue that must be confronted is at the center of the WTO: Foreign firms within a nation must be have a level playing field with indigenous firms. On the surface, this principle seems eminently fair and proper. (Of course, foreign firms in China, until recently, had a 2-1 tax advantage over indigenous firms. Should the WTO have allowed this inequity? No, at least not without some thought.)</p>
<p>WTO membership requires the level playing field principle. But setting the taxation issue aside, what is the problem with this principle?</p>
<p>First, the principle refuses to acknowledge that the enormous disparities in wages between wealthy countries and poor countries might be a problem. No country can lose its manufacturing base.</p>
<p>There is no burden on a poor country to insist that its labor be free to collectively bargain. Nor is there any requirement that a poor country protect is labor force from abuse. Labor policy is a national, not a global issue. So says the WTO. I disagree.</p>
<p>Simply put: Nothing stops multinationals from simply exploiting the cheap labor. Multinationals simply outsource the production to sweatshop firms.</p>
<p>For a while, everything seems rosy. Wealthy consumers get cheap products. But as the wealthy nations lose their manufacturing base&#8211;replaced with jobs in government, health care, and service industries&#8211;the problem grows. Strains on its social safety net grow.</p>
<p>Secondly, the principle is blind to the potential ultimate effects: Massive trade imbalances, growing wealth in the hands of a few, and dangerous dislocations in the balance of payments&#8230;to name only a few.</p>
<p>To keep the &#8220;wealthy&#8221; consumer buying, the so-called poor nations have to lend moneys to the so-called &#8220;wealthy&#8221; nations. Something is amiss and out of place here.</p>
<p>When labor policy becomes merely a national not a global issue, the world suffers. The same can be said about environmental policies. In the end, we are all in the same boat. We just have to stop drilling holes in that boat. Time to plug the leaks.</p>

                                <p>After years of keeping rates low, the Fed cuts them again&#8230; a lot.  Good luck getting much of an interest payment from money in the bank.  Which means its obvious that if GW is going to give people financial advice, <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-stimulus23jan23,1,3678425.story?ctrack=1&#038;cset=true">this </a> is the advice he&#8217;s going to give:</p>

                                <p>In this mornings New York Times Bruce Bartlett published a nice list of anti recession measures by Congress and makes the point that they are always too late.  However, if you read the list of 14 different measures he list you find that 12 of them are for public works programs and he is completely correct that they were too late to be effective anti recession measures.  He is not saying anything new.  It has been widely known for years that the time needed for Washington to act meant that using counter cyclical fiscal was very hard and it was usually too late.  This has been standard main stream economics for years.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/R5dC5ifixWI/AAAAAAAAAFs/3mDBJtPRwiA/s1600-h/Clipboard01.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/R5dC5ifixWI/AAAAAAAAAFs/3mDBJtPRwiA/s320/Clipboard01.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a></p>
<p>But two of the programs were tax cuts or tax rebates.  One in 1975 and the other in 2001.  Yes, he is right that the 1975 act came at the end of the recession, but the 2001 measure was very timely and the tax cut hit before the recession ended.  I lived through the 1975 recession and remember clearly that the tax cuts played a major role in the 1975 consumer spending rebound.<br />Interestingly, Greenspan was the individual who convinced Ford to target the tax cuts to the middle class by pointing out that if President Ford wanted to buy a new car he would buy one and the tax cut would not make much difference.  But for the typical middle class and/or poorer citizens liquidity constraints meant that the tax cut could make a significant difference in the car purchase decision. Moreover, as I pointed out yesterday the 2001 stimulus also clearly paid a significant role in the consumer spending rebound just as it did in 1975.  The CBO just published a report where they found that one third of the 2001 tax rebate was spent in the first three months and  two-thirds within 6 months.</p>

But even he recognized that this only applied to individuals that were not facing liquidity constraints &#8212; a very small segment of the population.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>A while back that I thought the economy might fall into recession some time this year.  And in the past week or two, I wrote several posts noting that considering the tax cuts we&#8217;ve had (on income from 2001 to 2003, and on repatriated income corporate income in 2005 and 2006, and on the estate tax 2001 to 2010), which is supposed to be a stimulus, and considering that we had several years of strong stimulus from the Fed as well for several years, we should be asking why the economy is in trouble now.  After all, with all that help, since GW took office, there were two dismal years of growth, then some mediocre growth, then some average growth, and now this&#8230;  </p>
<p>After asking the question a few times, I&#8217;ve had a chance to move it around in my head for a while&#8230; so here are a few more thoughts and a few thoughts on where we&#8217;re going.  (I&#8217;m in a bit of a hurry, so apologies if this reads rushed.)</p>
<p>1.  When GW took office, fiscal responsibility went out the window.  The <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/usbudget/blueprint/bud01.html">Economic Blueprint</a> called for big tax cuts and paying down the debt a lot &#8211; and it was obvious at the time you couldn&#8217;t do both.  (Some of us voted against GW in large part because of this economic silliness.)  After having Robert Rubin at the helm, this sort of stupidity made even the cheerleaders on Wall Street wonder.  Throw in the strong-arming of Uncle Alan to make him come around&#8230; and financial markets weren&#8217;t exactly looking like a place with a future.</p>
<p>2. I imagine that after the dot com crash, there was a lot of excess capacity in the system.  The tax cuts did not serve to stimulate the economy &#8211; the money went primarily to folks who were financially sophisticated (or, more likely, had advisers who were financially sophisticated) and who understood that investing in factories and plants here in the US wasn&#8217;t going to produce good immediate returns.  So they didn&#8217;t make those investments.  As a result, we got a small amount of very short term stimulus out of the tax cuts&#8230; at the cost of a growing debt.</p>
<p>3.  As per Keynes, when the private sector won&#8217;t provide the stimulus, well, that&#8217;s what the gubmint is for.  But the gubmint on GW didn&#8217;t spend money on the types of programs that produce much kick for the economy &#8211; after all, those were the sorts of expenditures Clinton made, and they didn&#8217;t want to do what Clinton did.  Instead, big chunks of money have been spent abroad, and on single use items which produce no lasting improvement on the US economy, such as explosives.</p>
<p>4.  Given fiscal policy wasn&#8217;t helping, the Fed kept money really, really cheap for a very long time.  The money had to go somewhere&#8230; and it went into the housing market.  We know the result of that.</p>
<p>So now what?  Well, tax cuts won&#8217;t work.  At best, they&#8217;ll produce a very small very short boost&#8230; and the cost in the long run in the form of increased debt will far outweigh that very small very short boost.  </p>
<p>Monetary policy isn&#8217;t going to do much that&#8217;s positive either&#8230; the Fed is in the position of a doctor who has a patient who likes to cut himself and roll around in the mud.  All the doctor can do is prescribe antibiotics&#8230; but eventually the patient develops a strain of bacteria that is resistant.  But actually, the situation is worse than that.  The rate cuts are simply taking away the last safe place to put money where it might actually earn something&#8230; the bank.  Expect a bunch of irate seniors by the November elections.  </p>
<p>There are two ways out:</p>
<p>1. Wait&#8230; recessions do come to an end by themselves.  <br />2. Government spending on things that GW would never spend money on, and to get started in the next couple of months.</p>
<p>Given option 2 is impossible, we&#8217;ll be going with option 1.  </p>
<p>My fellow Angry Bear Dan&#8217;s post this morning has a <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/01/some-plain-vanilla-snark.html">table showing some recent recessions</a>, and I&#8217;m struck by one thing when I look at it.  Generally, when the country emerges from a recession, it is in a stronger economic position than it was when the expansion preceding the recession began.  (Put another way, when a recession ends, the economy is generally stronger than it was when the previous recession ended.)  I think you have to go back to 1975 to have a recession where that might not be true.  I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s going to be true this time around. And in the end, that will be GW&#8217;s &#8211; leaving behind an America that is much weaker and less confident than the one he became president of seven years ago.</p>
