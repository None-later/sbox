                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Today&#8217;s new economic data fit into the larger picture of an economy that is noticeably losing steam.  In the graph below I&#8217;ve presented the 3-month annualized rate of change in core consumer prices and industrial production, including today&#8217;s data.  I&#8217;ve also included two other data series that reveal important clues about the health of the economy, retail sales (deflated by the CPI) and employment.  The four are unanimous, and together they provide a nice illustration of what a slowing recovery looks like.</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/slowdown_graph.jpg"></p>
<p>After a nice boost to the economy starting late in 2003 (and led by strong tax cut-fueled retail sales), all four indicators show that growth peaked around April or May and is now slowing.</p>
<p>This may be only a temporary pause in the recovery, but there are some good reasons to think that it may not be.  As I <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2004/08/bears-and-bulls.html">discussed last week</a> in a <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2004/08/prospects-for-business-spending.html">couple of posts</a>, the problem is simply that there is no sector of the economy that can significantly boost demand right now.  Given that, the recovery may well have already run its course.  And so far, the data is consistent with this interpretation.</p>
<p>What can be done about it?  At this point, unfortunately, it&#8217;s a bit late for the most effective economic medicine: an appropriate fiscal stimulus in 2002 or early 2003. The Bush administration squandered their fiscal ammunition on a tax cut for the wealthy that did little for the economy other than to cause a temporary spike in retail sales last summer.</p>
<p>Another fiscal stimulus at this point would have to be very carefully designed to be effective.  It would have to be explicitly temporary, to avoid spooking the bond market and driving interest rates higher.  The tax cuts would have to be directed toward the middle class, and spending increases would probably be most effective if the federal government distributes the money to state and local governments to spend.</p>
<p>Other changes to economic policy would help the recovery, too.  An administration with credible and serious economic policy-making might reassure businesses about medium-term economic growth.  And some long-run fiscal contraction (e.g. tax increases and spending cuts over the period 2-4 years from now) would help push real long-term interest rates down and encourage optimism about prospects for economic growth, also stimulating investment.  </p>
<p>Obviously, neither of these is going to happen under the current administration. But that makes this just another reason to remove it from office.</p>

                                <p>We have two new pieces of economic data this morning, the CPI report and Industrial Production for July.  The <a href="http://stats.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm">consumer price inflation report</a> released this morning by the BLS showed a surprising fall in prices in July.   Part of this was due to a small fallback in oil prices during the month (this will be undone in the August CPI report, since the price of oil has renewed its rise over the past couple of weeks), but part of it is due to the lack of price increases across the economy more generally.  The core rate of inflation (i.e. excluding food and energy prices) was less than .1% in July.  Here&#8217;s the picture:</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/inflation1.jpg"></p>
<p>The chart shows the overall consumer inflation rate, the consumer inflation rate for items other than food and energy, and the inflation rate for goods that businesses use.  The rise in inflation that happened in the US during the first few months of 2004 definitely seems to be tapering off.  As I&#8217;ve said before, this is both good and bad.  It&#8217;s good for prices to stop rising if wages continue to rise, so that the real purchasing power of individuals increases.  But it&#8217;s bad if this slowdown in price rises reflects weak demand, because that will in turn result in weak wage growth.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/G17/Current/default.htm">Industrial Production report for July</a> showed a small gain in both production and capacity utilization that (almost) undid a decline in June. </p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/ip_caput1.jpg"></p>
<p>Output by factories, mines, and utilities in the US is basically back to its level of 2000 (note that this is despite the fact that the rest of the economy has grown by about 9% over the period in real terms, and the population of the US has grown by<br />
<br />4-5%).  Capacity utilization has yet to begin a serious recovery to pre-recession levels, however.  </p>
<p>Both the capacity utilization figures and the slowing inflation figures are manifestations of the same phenomenon: the US economy is still operating far below its potential.  And until demand picks up, below our potential is where we&#8217;ll stay.</p>

                                <p>The political scene is getting ugly, but the Kerry economists must have been chucking when they emailed out Don Luskin’s latest from the National Review on August 13, which is entitled “The Art of Trash-Talking a Good Economy: Just how stupid does John Kerry think the voters are?&#8221; It states in part:</p>
<blockquote><p>He [Gene Sperling] made his optimistic statement to The Washington Post eight years ago, on May 4, 1996, back when he was an economic advisor to the Clinton administration. His words came right after it was announced that only 2,000 jobs were created in the economy the previous month, with 17,000 jobs lost in the manufacturing sector. For the previous quarter, real GDP growth ran at only 2.85 percent, which was a drop from the prior quarter.  Sperling was optimistic back then, when the news was tangibly worse than it is now. And what is Sperling saying now, when the news is tangibly better? For some reason he’s not quite so optimistic when the other team occupies the White House.</p></blockquote>
<p>He finds one quarter where real GDP growth was less than 3% but forgets to tell his readers that average annual growth was 3.7% during the Clinton years.  Yet, he touts a few quarters of good growth under Bush but fails to tell his readers that growth will likely average only 2.5% per year for the Bush term.  But WHO announced only 2000 jobs were created in April 1996?  Never mind the fact employment grew by 23 million jobs over Clinton’s 8 years and grew by 2.8 million in 1996 alone.  BLS reported a 165 thousand increase in employment during April 1996.  Maybe Luskin was the one who announced this grossly incorrect number?  </p>
<p>He makes one decent point in this whole article:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the same speech Kerry claimed that the new jobs created during Bush’s first term “pay $9,000 less than the jobs that have been lost.” That’s a lie, too. Any honest economist could have told Kerry that statistics are detailed enough to prove that such a specific claim simply does not exist.</p></blockquote>
<p>Fair enough but doesn’t this also mean that the Bush camp is also lying when they says the new jobs pay more than the jobs lost?  But if Luskin thinks spinning the numbers is lying, let’s read on:</p>
<blockquote><p>This is just one of dozens of examples of the hypocritical and dishonest ways the Kerry campaign is trash-talking the economy. Consider some things Kerry himself said… For example, he claimed that “here at home, wages are falling.” That’s a lie. According to official numbers from the Department of Labor’s Bureau of Labor Statistics, average hourly earnings have risen 2.1 percent after adjustment for inflation since George W. Bush took office. Over the comparable period in President Clinton’s first term, they rose only four-tenths of one percent….While it would be nice to have the unemployment rate back down to 3.8 percent — where it briefly stood for one manic month four years ago at about the same time the Nasdaq was at 5,000 — at 5.5 percent today, it is better than the average rate of the past half century. More, the current unemployment rate is exactly where it was at the comparable point of the “Clinton prosperity,” those halcyon days that Democrats never stop waxing nostalgic about. And in terms of overall economic growth, you don’t have to be nostalgic. These are the good old days. Gross domestic product adjusted for inflation has grown over the last twelve months at a faster clip than during any twelve-month period of the eight-year Clinton administration. </p></blockquote>
<p>OK, we have already dealt with his GDP spinning (or was this his lying).  But average unemployment?  We’ve noted before that the unemployment rate was 7.4% in December 1992 and fell to 3.9% by December 2000 only to start rising during the Bush years.  But to say Kerry is lying about real wages falling is itself a lie.  Let’s review the facts: over the 1997-2001 period, real wage growth averaged 1.7% per year with a 2.1% increase in 2001 with real wages (1982$) hitting $8.30 per hour.  As of July 2004, real wages were only $8.20 per hour.</p>
<p>So what did we learn?  That Luskin considers spinning a lie, so the fact that he does nothing but spin …Oh, we also learned that he does not like Gene Sperling.  You think Sperling really cares since the Kerry economists emailed this the day it was published?</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Factcheck.org’s <em>Kerry’s Dubious Economics </em>may have been one of Luskin’s sources and writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Kerry also said “wages are falling” when in fact they are increasing. It&#8217;s true wages haven&#8217;t kept up with inflation for the past several months. But even after adjusting for inflation they&#8217;re still higher than when Bush took office.</p></blockquote>
<p>Actually, Kerry said “real wages are falling”.  So does Factcheck not understand that “wages haven&#8217;t kept up with inflation” = real wages are falling?  </p>

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Not so long ago, the Bush administration was pushing covert (and not so covert) actions to oust Venezualan president Hugo Chavez. <a href="http://globalsecurity.com/world_politics/us_funding/us_funding.htm">This April 15, 2004 article from GlobalSecurity.com</a> explains some of what passed:<br />
<br />
<blockquote>Documents showing U.S. funding for Venezuelan opposition groups have prompted an increase in personal attacks by President Hugo Chavez against President Bush, according to a U.S. lawyer who helped unearth the evidence.
<p>Eva Golinger, a Brooklyn, N.Y.-based attorney who supports Chavez, said documents obtained through the U.S. Freedom of Information Act showed that around $4 million in U.S. Congress-allocated funds had been channeled to the groups before and after a 2002 coup that briefly toppled Chavez. </p>
<p>&#8220;These groups are being financed by a foreign government, a U.S. government that has taken an open stance against the Chavez administration, that supported the coup &#8230; it&#8217;s major meddling,&#8221; Golinger told Reuters in an interview Wednesday.</p>
<p>&#8230; U.S. officials deny any involvement in the 2002 coup or that Washington is trying to topple Chavez. But they say the Bush administration supports &#8220;pro-democracy&#8221; groups.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, at a minimum, the Bush administration was funding anti-Chavez (read &#8220;pro-democracy&#8221;, even though Chavez was elected in 1998) groups. At worst, it was something more than that but short of the <a href="http://www.betterworldlinks.org/book62a.htm">measures taken to replace Allende with Pinochet</a> in the 1970s. In any event, the administration is clearly anti-Chavez.</p>
<p>On the other hand, lowering oil prices was included as a side-benefit of the Iraq invasion. Given the track record of failure, is it any surprise that<br />
<br />
<blockquote>1) Oil prices have risen steadily since the invasion of Iraq, and <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2004/08/oil-still-going-up.html">markedly of late</a>, and</p>
<p>2) When Chavez, who the US opposed and sought to displace, survives a recall vote, <a href="http://www.reuters.com/newsArticle.jhtml?type=businessNews&#038;storyID=5987356">oil prices fall</a>:<br />
<blockquote>NEW YORK (Reuters) &#8211; U.S. stocks gained on Monday as oil prices dipped after reports of victory for the Venezuelan president in a referendum on his rule eased fears about the country&#8217;s oil exports.<br />
</p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>In short:<br />

<ul>
<li>Successfully invade Iraq and, counter to pre-war claims, oil prices go up.</li>
<li>Unsuccesfully seek to displace Chavez, see Chavez&#8217;s term as president endure, and oil prices go down.<br />
</li>
</ul>
<p> I&#8217;m not generally one to give advice to President Bush, but if he wants to have a real chance in the next election, he might want to give very serious consideration to revising his policy formulation process. Something like this might work a lot better:<br />
<br />
<blockquote>LIBBY/FEITH/CHENEY/ROVE/CARD/BOLTEN: Mr. President, we really need to do X, posthaste.</p>
<p>BUSH: Posthaste?</p>
<p>LIBBY/FEITH/CHENEY/ROVE/CARD/BOLTEN:Quickly. Let&#8217;s do X, right away.</p>
<p>BUSH: I&#8217;ve been watching you these last few years. Let&#8217;s do the exact opposite of X!</p></blockquote>

Apparently the FBI has spent the past couple of weeks interviewing, and in some cases subpoenaing, people that it thinks are likely to attend protests at the Republican convention in NY.  </p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The message I took from it,&#8221; said Sarah Bardwell, 21, an intern at a Denver antiwar group who was visited by six investigators a few weeks ago, &#8220;was that they were trying to intimidate us into not going to any protests and to let us know that, &#8216;hey, we&#8217;re watching you.'&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>When someone in the FBI complained that such tactics were inappropriate, Ashcroft&#8217;s legal office said that the tactics were fine.  It&#8217;s amazing how, day after day, something new reminds me why I am so chagrined at George Bush&#8217;s version of America.</p>

<br />What did Bush and Kerry mean when they invoked sensitivity? I assume they meant <a href="http://www.dailystar.com.lb/article.asp?edition_id=10&#038;categ_id=2&#038;article_id=7314">things like this</a>:<br />
<br />
<blockquote>Wary of igniting more anger, the US military said the [current] assault [in Najaf] would exclude the Imam Ali Mosque. Government officials said only Iraqi forces would disarm militia inside.</p></blockquote>
<p>That oh so sensitive US military! I suppose Cheney thinks they&#8217;re a bunch of pussies, too. In fact, the military may be chock-full of sensitive soldiers. Here&#8217;s one, Maj.

<blockquote>&#8220;Hopefully, the talks will go well and everything will be resolved peacefully.&#8221;<br />
</p></blockquote>
<p>Sheesh, Pizzitola. Go hug a tree or something.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s another dose of sensitivity from a member of that legendary gang of sensitives, the United States Marine Corps (first in, last out, but sensitively!). <a href="http://www.usmc.mil/marinelink/mcn2000.nsf/0/55182278FE6DD9AE85256EEE0016E38E?opendocument">Via Marine Corps News</a>:<br />
<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;The price of this fight [with the Muqtada Militia around Najaf] was high,&#8221; said Col. Anthony M. Haslam, commanding officer of the 11th MEU (SOC). &#8220;Every Marine fought bravely in the field of battle and represents what&#8217;s best in America and in the United States Marine Corps.<br />
</p></blockquote>
<p>That Colonel Haslam is one sensitive guy, waxing about his lost comrades rather than revelling in victory. Cheney should put him in a dress. Heck, over here, we <a href="http://www.atrios.blogspot.com/2004_08_08_atrios_archive.html#109241384217558439">don&#8217;t even correctly count the dead</a> anymore. How&#8217;s that for not being sensitive? Marine Col. Haslam could learn something about manliness from The New York Times.</p>
<p>And what did those wusses from that infamously sensitive institution, the US Department of Defense, title their <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Aug2004/n08122004_2004081202.html">8/12 Press Release</a> on the offensive against Muqtada al-Sadr&#8217;s forces?<br />
<br />
<blockquote>Offensive Begins But Holy Sites Not Targeted, Officials Say</p></blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s one sensitive offensive! Put a real man in charge of the DOD.</p>
<p>AB</p>
<p>(*) One glaring difference being, of course, that Gore never said he invented the internet.</p>
<p>UPDATE: For more on Bush Administration sensitivity, see <a href="http://www.liberaloasis.com/archives/080804.htm#081304">Liberal Oasis</a>. As it turns out, even Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Richard Myers is sensitive. It looks like getting rid of Bush and his sensitive gang is really our only hope of a manly War on Terror.<br /></p>

                                <p>John King notes the source of the sensitive remark that Dick Chcney has been criticizing John Kerry over – during CNN’s Newsnight 8/12/2004 edition:</p>
<blockquote><p>KING: In a speech at issue a week ago, Senator Kerry vowed to destroy terrorist networks. And aides say by promising to be more sensitive he simply meant more diplomatic with other countries, much as President Bush used the term six weeks after taking office.</p>
<p>BUSH: Precisely because America is powerful, we must be sensitive about expressing our power and influence.</p></blockquote>
<p>Another aspect of the Bush-Cheney strategy was noted during this edition of Newsnight:</p>
<blockquote><p>Another Bush-Cheney strategy is daily questions about Senator Kerry&#8217;s vote in favor of the Iraq war. That is more risky. It was Mr. Bush who launched the war and nearly half of Americans now think it was a mistake to send troops to Iraq. But just among Democrats, 74 percent call the war a mistake and the White House thinks the more Senator Kerry has to explain his vote, the more anti-war Democrats might become disillusioned with his candidacy.</p></blockquote>
<p>Dean and Nader supporters take note.</p>

<blockquote>
<br />There were many honorable ways to behave during the Vietnam era. There were those who believed in the war and volunteered to fight it. There were those who were drafted and went as a matter of duty. There were those who fought the war, came to believe it was wrong and came back to change the policy. And there were those who believed it was wrong and refused to participate. All of those people stood up for what they believed in and did their duty as they saw it.</p>
<p>There was one group, however, who supported the war but didn&#8217;t stand up for their beliefs &#8212; refusing to take the heat that being a citizen, particularly a young man, in those days required. They played the system. Many of them &#8220;had other priorities&#8221; using every possible excuse, all the while vociferously backing the war effort &#8212; as long as someone else fought it. And, the worst of this group were the privileged who supported the war but merely <em>pretended</em> to fight it by having their connections pull strings to get them into safe stateside duty that they could later claim amounted to &#8220;service.&#8221; They would have pictures of themselves looking handsome in their uniforms. And they could swagger around with their buddies and drop casual hints for the rest of their lives about their days in the military. But even those phonies at least actually completed the minimal requirements to claim such affiliation.</p></blockquote>

<p>Kevin addresses the politics of the issue, and the difficulty of being a Bush advisor (&#8220;like sweeping up after the elephants at the circus&#8221;), but he also basically endorses my point, <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2004/08/consumption-taxes.html">posted last week</a>, that if nothing else would stop this from happening, seniors would:<br />
<br />
<blockquote>Seniors would sure be pissed off about this. And who can blame them? All their lives their income was reduced by the amount of income tax they paid, and now that they&#8217;re retired this reduced amount of money is suddenly subject to a brand new sales tax. Talk about your double taxation!</p>
<p>(Don&#8217;t get it? Think of it this way. Suppose you make $100 today and it gets taxed at 20%. You have $80 left over and you put it in the bank. Tomorrow the income tax is abolished and a 30% sales tax is implemented, so you can only buy $60 worth of stuff with your $80. Your original $100 has essentially been taxed down to $60. For senior citizens, this applies to everything they&#8217;ve socked away over their entire lives.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Matt Y. also <a href="http://yglesias.typepad.com/matthew/2004/08/seniors_and_con.html">wrote last week</a> that, &#8220;Switching from income taxes to consumption taxes would be a very bad deal for retirees and retirees always get what they want from politicians, so there&#8217;s about no chance this will happen.&#8221;</p>
<p>In other words, the idea is only being floated by Hastert so he can take a few shots at the IRS. I doubt that even he considers it a serious proposal.</p>

<p>(*) PGL <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2004/08/bartlett-v-bush-on-national-sales-tax.html">also noticed</a> this Bush statement, quipping, &#8220;I guess taking seriously and not knowing what the tax rate would be is par for the course with George W. Bush.&#8221;</p>

                                <p>Today&#8217;s Washington Post has <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A58127-2004Aug11.html">a lengthy article</a> examining their coverage of the Bush administration&#8217;s assertions about Iraq during the period leading up to the war.  They contritely conclude this:</p>
<blockquote><p>In retrospect, said Executive Editor Leonard Downie Jr., &#8220;we were so focused on trying to figure out what the administration was doing that we were not giving the same play to people who said it wouldn&#8217;t be a good idea to go to war and were questioning the administration&#8217;s rationale. Not enough of those stories were put on the front page. That was a mistake on my part.&#8221; </p>
<p>Across the country, &#8220;the voices raising questions about the war were lonely ones,&#8221; Downie said. &#8220;We didn&#8217;t pay enough attention to the minority.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I agree.  But does it really do anyone any good to simply admit &#8212; over a year later &#8212; that they shouldn&#8217;t have just regurgitated the administration&#8217;s spoon-feeding all over the front page every day?  Will they apologize to the families of nearly 1,000 US soldiers who have needlessly been sacrificed as a result of insufficient questioning of the Bush administration about the rationale for war?  Will major media outlets like the Washington Post actually change their behavior in the future?</p>
<p>Now that I think about it, of course they will.  If Kerry is elected, at least.</p>
