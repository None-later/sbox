                                <p>One difference between GW&#8217;s administration and previous ones I can remember living through (Reagan, GHW, and Clinton) is that this one is far more likely to act unilaterally.   </p>
<p>I was thinking about it when I read <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6915652.stm">this</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>British concerns did not appear to &#8220;materially&#8221; affect US actions in its &#8220;war on terror&#8221;, the UK&#8217;s intelligence and security committee has said. <br />The committee, which reports to the prime minister, was probing possible UK involvement in rendition flights. </p>
<p>It said America&#8217;s &#8220;lack of regard&#8221; for UK concerns had &#8220;serious implications&#8221; for future intelligence relations. </p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>The committee said the UK services &#8220;used caveats specifically prohibiting any action being taken&#8221; when they handed over the intelligence on the men. </p>
<p>It says the UK security services did not foresee that the US authorities would disregard the caveats, given that they had honoured the caveat system for the past 20 years. </p>
<p>&#8220;This case shows a lack of regard on the part of the US for UK concerns &#8211; despite strong protests &#8211; and that has serious implications for the intelligence relationship,&#8221; the report concluded. </p>
<p>&#8220;In fighting international terrorism it is clear that the US will take whatever action it deems is necessary, within US law, to protect its national security,&#8221; it said. </p>
<p>&#8220;Although the US may take note of UK protests and concerns, it does not appear materially to affect their strategy; the rendition programme has revealed aspects of this usually close relationship that are surprising and concerning,&#8221; the report warned. </p></blockquote>
<p>Note&#8230; this is the UK.  Perhaps our closest ally.  What does it say about people when even their closest allies have misgivings about cooperating with them?</p>

                                <p>A couple of years ago, we paid <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/04/economists-enabling-tax-cheats-why.html">tribute</a> to <a href="http://www.epinet.org/newsroom/releases/2005/04/050411_McIntyre.pdf">Bob McIntyre</a> and to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1591840198/qid=1113517951/sr=2-1/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_1/104-4414318-7674360">David Cay Johnston</a> for recognizing how U.S. based multinationals can abuse the transfer pricing regulations to shift income abroad to low-tax jurisdictions.  Johnston’s <em>Letter to Switzerland</em> chapter focused on how Big Pharma plays this game.</p>
<p>An international tax guru might fire back that Big Pharma eventually pays taxes when the profits are repatriated.  OK, these companies get to defer taxation and the present value of $1 million in tax paid in 10 years is a lot less than the $1 million without the deferral benefit.  But this gets better as reported today by The New York Times:  </p>
<blockquote><p>Two years ago, when companies received a big tax break to bring home  their offshore profits, the president and Congress justified it as a one-time tax amnesty that would create American jobs.  Drug makers were the biggest beneficiaries of the amnesty program, repatriating about $100 billion in foreign profits and paying only minimal taxes. But the companies did not create many jobs in return. Instead, since 2005 the American drug industry has laid off tens of thousands of workers in this country.  And now drug companies are once again using complex strategies, many of them demonstrably legal, to shelter billions of dollars in profits in international tax havens, according to their financial statements and independent tax experts.  In one popular accounting move, companies declare their foreign markets as far more profitable than their American businesses &#8211; even though drug prices are typically higher in the United States than anywhere else in the world.  Drug makers are not the only American multinationals using tax loopholes to declare large portions of their income beyond the reach of the Internal Revenue Service. The Brookings Institution estimates that multinational companies are using overseas tax shelters to lower their payments to the Treasury by about $50 billion a year. But the drug industry accounts for one of the biggest portions of that shortfall, according to the I.R.S. and independent tax experts. And the nature of their business gives drug makers techniques, like sheltering valuable pharmaceutical patents in tax-friendly havens like Ireland, that many other industries cannot use. Moreover, the sheer heft of the American drug industry, which had about $60 billion in pretax profits last year, can give disproportionate weight to the economic impact of its tax sheltering techniques. Even though the tax amnesty legislation has expired, its passage encouraged companies to be even more aggressive about sheltering money, expecting another holiday in the future, said H. David Rosenbloom, director of the international tax program at New York University. Democrats and Republicans supported the legislation, which passed with sizable majorities in October 2004. &#8221;Congress can swear on two stacks of Bibles that it&#8217;ll never do it again,&#8221; Mr. Rosenbloom said, &#8221;but they&#8217;ve lost their virginity.&#8221; With a few narrow exceptions, the drug companies are supposed to be paying as much as 35 percent of their worldwide profits in United States federal taxes. In reality they pay much less. Last year, for example Eli Lilly, the sixth-largest American drug maker, paid less than 6 percent of its profits of $3.4 billion to the United States government, according to its financial statement.</p></blockquote>
<p>Some rough numbers on Eli Lilly’s profits and income taxes.  Last year, its pretax income was $3.42 billion and this story is saying that its US taxes were about $0.21 billion?  If their US tax rate was 35%, then their US income was only $0.6 billion with $2.82 billion declared in foreign affiliates.  Its total income taxes were about $0.76 billion so foreign income taxes were running around $0.55 billion.  The effective tax rate on non-US income was therefore less than 20%, while the overall tax rate was around 22%.  It does sound like this company – like a lot of other Big Pharma companies – is parking a lot of profits abroad. And it’s not exactly the case that foreign markets provide more monopoly protection as compared to the US market.  So it does seem to be a case where massive transfer pricing manipulation is occurring.</p>
<p>And they get this repatriation on the cheap because of the tax break we gave them a couple of years ago.  Why on earth did President Bush and certain members of Congress think that this large tax giveaway would create more American jobs?  Were they talking about jobs with tax law firms and accounting firms?</p>

                                <p>By way of <a href="http://www.crooksandliars.com/2007/07/25/nonny-mouse-goes-down-under/">Crooks and Liars </a>comes an article about our declining international tourism industry. This article is a personal account of stopping in the US as the author travels from London to New Zealand.<br />The first paragraph is the econ specifics:</p>
<blockquote><p>The travel and tourist industry is one of the United State’s biggest money-makers, generating $103 billion in tax revenue every year. Without this tax revenue, every American household would pay nearly $1,000 more in taxes every a year. But while the travel business is flourishing internationally, tourism to America has been on a steep decline, dropping 36 percent between 1992 and 2005, with a loss of $43 billion in 2005 alone. The nation’s international tourism balance of trade declined more than 70 percent over the past 10 years &#8211; from $26.3 billion in 1996 to $7.4 billion in 2005. </p></blockquote>
<p>Don&#8217;t stop there. Read about how the author&#8217;s fellow passengers were cataloged via photo and finger prints even though they were not visiting the USA. They were just stopping over for fuel. Is it any wonder we are seeing such a decline in tourism? One passenger summed it up:</p>
<blockquote><p> &#8216;You bloody Yanks seem to think terrorism is something new and only ever happens to Americans,’ he groused to me&#8230; ‘We’ve had the IRA and the French have the Algerians and the Spanish have ETA. Now you know what the rest of Europe’s been living with for the last few hundred years. Why don’t you lot just grow up?’</p></blockquote>
<p>I know our reputation in the world has become suspect via what is reported, but people with first hand accounts such as what these passengers experienced I would assume are more probative when judging us.  What these passengers experienced is the results of setting policy as driven by paranoia.   I personally do not want to be associated with such a mind set.  At the same time, what the heck happened to all that we learned from  the focus on paranoia and it&#8217;s harm in the 60&#8217;s?  I can recall many bands having songs about it as we became aware of how it was driving policy then.  This is one of my favorites:<br /><a href="http://www.lyricstime.com/grand-funk-railroad-paranoid-lyrics.html">Grand Funk Paranoid</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Did you ever have that feeling in your life That someone was watching you? You don&#8217;t have no reason that&#8217;s right But still he&#8217;s there watching you Someone is waiting just outside the door To take you away</p></blockquote>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>The Big 3 and the United Auto Workers start talks this week, with the futures of the companies and the union at stake. No pressure there!</p>
<p>A massive issue is legacy costs, both retirements and healthcare, especially healthcare. The UAW played a huge role in securing healthcare benefits for American workers.</p>
<p>Both sides made massive promises when the Big 3 had 80%+ of the domestic market, those days are long gone. The Big 3 claim that these “legacy” costs amount to $25 per current labor hour, a huge add-on burden.</p>
<p>The UAW has three constituencies:</p>
<p>1) active workers<br />2) retirees who are not yet Medicare age (at greatest risk)<br />3) retirees who are Medicare age</p>
<p>Only the active workers can vote on a new contract, so the Big 3 will play the workers against the retirees. UAW officials are in a really tough spot.</p>
<p>(There was and is a presumption that many blue collar workers often cannot physically work their jobs until the age of 65, which I believe remains true.)</p>
<p>A recent proposal is for the UAW to take over the retiree benefits through a Voluntary Employee Benefit Association, known as a VEBA [IRS Code Section 501 c (9)].</p>
<p>This would do the following:<br />a) shift the risk and management to the UAW (major burden)<br />b) protect the retirees in case of a bankruptcy filing (huge benefit)</p>
<p>The UAW would inevitably have to cut retiree benefits, which will not play well with the retirees, although something is usually better than nothing.</p>
<p>This whole deal may be moot because the Big 3 may not have enough cash to fund the present value of the benefit stream, The numbers are HUGE.</p>
<p>(Ford is continuing to rack up losses, look for a sale or bankruptcy within two years.)</p>
<p>This is unlikely to set a precedent for the future, the number of companies making such promises has diminished  (and many deals have been flushed through Chapter 11).</p>
<p>What will happen in the future to blue collar workers who cannot do their jobs until they qualify for Medicare coverage?</p>
<p>Will a creative solution be found? Will there be a strike on this or other issues? Can a union operate such a complex insurance entity?  Will current UAW workers throw the retirees over board? Stay tuned.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Given the recent post on <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/07/comparing-presidents-suicide-rate.html">suicide rates over time</a> and how its changed over various presidential administrations, Reader Dan finds <a href="http://www.sprc.org/library/SuicideTrends2.pdf">this presentation</a> (warning &#8211; PDF file). Its worth a look. Here are its conclusions:</p>
<blockquote><p>Suicide rates declined over the 20-year period.<br />• The decline was led largely by declines in firearm<br />suicides.<br />• Elder and youth suicide rates have declined;<br />suicide among the middle-aged has not.<br />• Declines have been strongest among Black,<br />Hispanic, and Asian Americans.<br />• The declines of the 1990s have stalled or reversed<br />in the early 2000s for all age groups except elders.<br />• Recent increases are largely among suffocation suicides.</p></blockquote>
<p>Not that I&#8217;m contemplating suicide myself or anything, but it seems to me that suffocation has got to be one of the least pleasant ways to go.  </p>
<p>Unfortunately, many of us will end up going that way &#8211; suicide by suffocation&#8230; but it won&#8217;t make the suicide figures. By that I mean&#8230; many of us have medical directives (and have spoken to our loved ones) that if we&#8217;re in a vegetative state, we aren&#8217;t to be resuscitated and no extraordinary procedures are to be used to keep us alive. Many would pick euthanasia in those circumstances, if given a choice, but the choice doesn&#8217;t exist &#8211; in large part because people who talk a lot about how important it is for the government to stay out of people&#8217;s business seem to think its important for the government to meddle in the most important business a person has. So the choice we&#8217;re allowed is whether to linger for a very long time and die in a very undignified fashion, or to linger for a few days and die in a very undignified fashion.</p>
<p>I remember some years back when my grandmother, after years of failing health, was slowly dying in the hospital. On top of it all, she had Alzheimer&#8217;s disease, and hadn&#8217;t been herself for several years. (On the one or two occasions over the past few years where she had been lucid if only for a moment, her disgust over the Alzheimer&#8217;s was palpable.) So she was in a hospital, with tubes down her throat, in pain and discomfort.</p>
<p>My grandfather (they had been married almost 75 years) couldn&#8217;t bear the idea of letting her go, and insisted that doctors do everything they could to keep her alive. My mother and my aunt (the two children of that marriage) begged him to let her die &#8211; the pain she was in obvious, and heartbreaking.</p>
<p>Finally, my sister spoke to my grandfather. My sister, who had undergone heart surgery several times knew what it was like to have a tube down her throat. She explained that even under sedation, even unconscious, you feel that tube. The tube is un-natural, and every instinct you have is to get that tube out, to claw it out if you have to. But you can&#8217;t, because you can&#8217;t move.</p>
<p>My sister told him &#8211; &#8220;You are condemning her to the worst feeling you can impose on her for as long as she lives. Its not like she&#8217;s in surgery or recovering from something, in which case it would be justified. She&#8217;s never going to come out of this.&#8221; </p>
<p>I&#8217;m happy to report that my grandfather agreed to have the tube removed. Bad as the choice was &#8211; allowing my grandmother to starve or suffocate, whichever came first &#8211; the alternative was worse, but those were the only choices the government would allow.</p>

<blockquote><p>The last go-round in the Gulf produced at least three spectacular domestic terrorists: Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols (Oklahoma City) and John Mohammed (DC sniper killings). Both McVeigh and Mohammed were reported to be unbalanced by their experience during the Gulf War. </p>
<p>The levels of stress on our troops is quite high. Combine this with the continuing spread of anti-government ideologies through terrorism-related conspiracy theories and the encouraging (or at least failure to suppress) of activities like vigilante border patrols which combine racism with xenophobia.</p>
<p>Iraq will be &#8216;The Timothy McVeigh Finishing School&#8217;.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://select.nytimes.com/gst/tsc.html?URI=http://select.nytimes.com/2007/07/24/opinion/24brooks.html&#038;OQ=_rQ3D1Q26hp&#038;OP=202a54b5Q2F)Q5Dwu)FQ3DeQ7BQ7BF)Q25xx6)x6)Q25,)Q7B84p4Q7Bp)Q25,ueQ7BQ7BoQ3DAfF2G">David Brooks</a> entitles his latest spin <em>A Reality-Based Economy</em> and opens with:</p>
<blockquote><p>The neopopulist story line about skyrocketing inequality and the tides of globalization is incredibly simple-minded.</p></blockquote>
<p>While I’ve seen many folks smarter than me on this issue say that inequality is rising but none have used the word skyrocketing.  And I’m not sure what tides of globalization even means.  But the real problem with this spin – as pointed out by <a href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/beat_the_press_archive?month=07&#038;year=2007&#038;base_name=david_brooks_sets_record_for_m">Dean Baker</a> &#8211; is how much misinformation Brooks has to use to write his 750 word piece of nonsense.  Let’s take my favorite:</p>
<blockquote><p>Brooks says &#8220;after a lag, average wages are rising sharply. Real average wages rose by 2 percent in 2006, the second fastest rise in 30 years.&#8221; The Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that the average hourly wage is 1.2 percent higher than its year ago level and still below its December 2002 level. That&#8217;s almost five years of zero growth. In the late 90s, real wages were growing 1.6 percent annually.</p></blockquote>
<p>The skyrocketing real wage canard seems to have become a favorite among the rightwing.  Since I’ve been looking for some excuse to update a graph of real wages among production and nonsupervisory workers, Dean’s correction of this latest spin from David Brooks is a great opportunity.  Our graph doesn’t show a lag but rather a decline.  The latest increase in real wages – as measured from June 2006 to June 2007 – is only 1.2% as Dean suggests.  OK – if one measures this from January 2006 to January 2007, you get a higher increase.  I guess David Brooks has been asleep for five months.  Now if he had said – we have had a five-year lag in real wage growth, his op-ed would be more factually correct.  But then admitting this reality undermines the main theme of what he wrote.  Then again – what David Brooks usually writes is completely divorced from reality.</p>

                                <p>This post is on suicide rates and how they changed over time since the 1960s when data became available. Data comes from the <a href="http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/tables/07s0108.xls">Statistical Abstract of the United States</a>, but originates with the U.S. National Center for Health Statistics. Rates are age adjusted… that is, the population age is standardized to the year 2000 levels. </p>
<p>Before we go on… what affects suicide rates? Well, presumably suicide is a function of despair and/or mental illness. Despair might increase with poverty rates and reduced chances for employment. Similarly, cuts in mental illness treatment is likely to increase despair. Even something as nebulous as feeling the President cares might make a difference… or does it? </p>
<p>Here’s what it looks like.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a summary&#8230;.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RqXp4UPDHaI/AAAAAAAAAeA/JAED5WJQrRQ/s1600-h/Suicide+Rate,+table.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RqXp4UPDHaI/AAAAAAAAAeA/JAED5WJQrRQ/s320/Suicide+Rate,+table.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Assuming fewer suicides are a good thing, Carter comes in first, followed by Clinton, then GHW, and then JFK/LBJ. The remaining administrations saw increases in suicide rates. (Incidentally… a means test looking at whether the average change is different in Democrat versus Republican administrations indicates we should reject the null hypothesis that the changes in suicide rates are the same under both Dems and Reps… the result is just barely significant at the 90% level, having a P-value of 0.10.) </p>
<p>So what’s up with this? Why the poor performance in the Nixon/Ford, Reagan, and GW years? Nixon/Ford – probably some residue of Vietnam, and the tanking of the economy probably didn’t help either. Also, this was a period when many people really didn’t feel the gubmint was on their side. Reagan… probably the largescale homeless dump made a difference. I was living abroad at the time, but the Ex-GF, who was growing up in Baltimore at the time, said the change was pretty evident even in her early teens. I would imagine some number of the formerly institutionalized, or as Reagan once called them, urban campers, eventually committed suicide. If they did so on someone’s front lawn, it might even have caused real damage, driving down property values and whatnot. GW? I’m not sure. Like many series we’ve looked at so far, the positive trend in the Clinton administration halted once GW came to office. Perhaps it is simply a result of the end of <a href="http://www.theonion.com/content/node/28784">our long national nightmare of peace and prosperity</a>. Or perhaps the war in Iraq, the fear of having to see Denny Hastert on the news on a regular basis, and other factors (were there cuts in psychiatric spending?) made a difference.</p>
<p>The surprise for me among the positive Presidents is GHW. Just a guess… it may be that the suicide rates among (current and recently retired) military personnel and their dependents are a not insubstantial part of the suicide rate in general, and Gulf War I’s somewhat antiseptic victory reduced the suicide rate among this group? </p>
<p>Anyone have ideas? Also&#8230; anyone have any idea where I can get historical data on homelessness?</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p>Correction&#8230;  as originally posted, I mentioned my guess that suicide rates might be higher among military personnel and their dependents.  I forgot to mention&#8230; I think it may also be higher in those recently retired from the military.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>I&#8217;ve seen <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/nation/washington/articles/2007/07/13/more_entering_army_with_criminal_records/?page=full">this</a> in a few places, and I&#8217;ve posted on it before: </p>
<blockquote><p>Nearly 12 percent of Army recruits who entered basic training this year needed a special waiver for those with criminal records, a dramatic increase over last year and 2 1/2 times the percentage four years ago, according to new Army statistics obtained by the Globe.</p>
<p>With less than three months left in the fiscal year, 11.6 percent of new active-duty and Army Reserve troops in 2007 have received a so-called &#8220;moral waiver,&#8221; up from 7.9 percent in fiscal year 2006, according to figures from the US Army Recruiting Command. In fiscal 2003 and 2004, soldiers granted waivers accounted for 4.6 percent of new recruits; in 2005, it was 6.2 percent.</p>
<p>Army officials acknowledge privately that the increase in moral waivers reflects the difficulty of signing up sufficient numbers of recruits to sustain an increasingly unpopular war in Iraq; the Army fell short of its monthly recruiting goals in May and June.</p>
<p>Since Oct. 1, 2006, when the fiscal year began, more than 8,000 of the roughly 69,000 recruits have been granted waivers for offenses ranging in seriousness from misdemeanors such as vandalism to felonies such as burglary and aggravated assault.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong><br />
<blockquote>Army officials say the majority of such recruits committed relatively minor offenses and have not been in prison. They point out that waivers are granted only after a careful review of each soldier&#8217;s history &#8212; and only when the applicant has shown remorse or changed behavior.</p>
<p>But former military officials and defense specialists said they fear that enlisting more soldiers with criminal backgrounds will increase the risk of disciplinary problems and criminal activity among soldiers in uniform.</p>
<p>&#8220;Somebody who has demonstrated themselves to be guilty of misbehavior in civilian life has a good chance of behaving in the same way in the military,&#8221; said John Hutson , judge advocate general of the Navy until 2000 and now dean of the Franklin Pierce Law Center at the University of New Hampshire.</p>
<p>Hutson said he witnessed the consequences of allowing former criminal offenders to join the ranks in the 1970s, the last time the military enlisted high numbers of soldiers with criminal histories. The numbers of recruits with criminal pasts who were allowed to join in the 1970s is not available, according to the Army. But Hutson said such soldiers often showed up in military court for committing new offenses.</p>
<p>&#8220;There were all kinds of what I call &#8216;frustration offenses,&#8217; &#8221; he said, citing drug use, burglary, and violent behavior. &#8220;Some people are incapable of coping with the regimen of military life so they act out in all kinds of ways.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong><br />
<blockquote>But other Defense Department officials maintain that the rise in criminal waivers is also a direct result of the Army&#8217;s struggle to meet recruiting targets.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is terrific pressure put on the recruiters,&#8221; said Alan Gropman , a professor at the Pentagon&#8217;s National Defense University. &#8220;They have to meet their mission so they request more waivers. In order to make the numbers they have to lower the standards.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since 2003 the Pentagon has taken unprecedented steps to try to meet its recruiting goals, including lowering education standards, raising the maximum age, and steadily increasing the amount of bonuses for new volunteers. But granting more waivers for criminals, specialists said, could end up backfiring.</p>
<p>One former senior Defense official, who remains a consultant to the Pentagon, said there is growing concern in the ranks that members of street gangs have been joining the military and then engaging in criminal activity.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>Reader Dan found this <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/21/business/worldbusiness/21trade.html?pagewanted=1&#038;n=Top%2FReference%2FTimes%20Topics%2FSubjects%2FA%2FAgriculture"> article</a> in the NYT on the WTO GATS Doha round and agricultural tariffs:</p>
<blockquote><p>There are disputes pitting Europe against the United States, rich countries against poor countries, and farming countries against industrial countries. </p>
<p>But a major new factor in the deadlock is a global economic realignment that has vaulted China, India and Brazil into the top tier of the world’s emerging markets, much to the concern of other developing countries like Mexico, Chile and Thailand. </p>
<p>India and Brazil are refusing to lower their tariffs out of fear of export-driven economies like China’s. A second tier of developing countries that are trying to compete with India and Brazil are complaining that they are being shut out by India, Brazil and other rapidly developing countries. Meanwhile, the poorest of the poor countries in Africa and elsewhere charge that the richer emerging market economies, which portray themselves as champions of the poor, are actually ignoring their needs.</p></blockquote>
<p>Reader Dan wrote a letter to the author, NYT reporter Steven Weisman:</p>
<blockquote><p>As you write about the Doha negotiations, it occurred to me there are several ways to look at them. Sort of day to day and reporting official comments, or also writing an investigative series about several issues important for readers to understand the direction the agreements are taking us. Because GATS and other agreements like NAFTA, CAFTA, AUSTR, and a number of bi-lateral agreements use similar language, they form an interlocking network of rules that should be raising eyebrows if only for the US and Canada represent big changes for peoples&#8217; lives. These are NOT simply issues of freer trade versus protectionism. Each country has special interests to appease internally, but use high sounding moral speech to cover the real money issues involved. More importantly, if the Deregulation language is approved from VI.4, and eventually used with other treaties, profound changes in our own governments are in store. V was about comparative advantage, not the latest rounds. </p></blockquote>
<p>Weisman responded&#8230; he seems to be in agreement.</p>
