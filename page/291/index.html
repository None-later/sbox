<p>Grupo Santander, the global banking giant, last year took control of Sovereign Bank.</p>
<blockquote><p>The largest bank in the Euro-zone, where it is based, Santander is the world’s eighth largest banking company by market capitalization. While the company is very good at generating profits around the world (it’s the world’s fourth largest bank by profits), this international meeting is focusing on something else: how the bank’s new U.S. branches might become as unionized as branches in Europe and Latin America. </p>
<p>Santander bank branches are on average 75-percent unionized outside the United States, according to UNI Global Union Finance Director Oliver Roethig because most other industrialized nations have unionized banking sectors. In the United States, however, less than 1 percent of all front-office bank workers are organized. In fact, the unionized janitors working for contractors that clean Sovereign Bank’s headquarters in Boston, Mass., often make more than the bank tellers and personal bankers, whose average wage is $10-$12 dollars per hour, despite individually producing millions of dollars in profits for the bank each year.</p></blockquote>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />
<blockquote>But the financial sector, at the center of the U.S. economy, has never been unionized. The international workers and local leaders of the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) and Communication Workers of America (CWA) gathered in July to use the clout of global union federations like the UNI Global Union to give labor a foothold in Santander’s Sovereign operations, and potentially organize the industry from there. If Santander employees are heavily unionized overseas, and corporate profits are so robust, then why shouldn’t American workers also join a union? </p></blockquote>
<p>Hmmm&#8230;these unions didn&#8217;t destroy Sartander?  Puzzling. <alert sarcasm>  Next post let&#8217;s look at some numbers for Big Labor in the States.</alert></p>

                                <p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/TGrk0RRJDUI/AAAAAAAADMo/UhGC58-FiYc/s1600/eur_chart.png"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/TGrk0RRJDUI/AAAAAAAADMo/UhGC58-FiYc/s200/eur_chart.png" alt="" border="0"></a>Spanning the period April 14, 2010 to June 7, 2010, the euro lost 12.5% in value <a href="http://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/fxrates/historical/home.cfm">against the $US</a> (this is not a trade-weighted measure of the currency value, but it&#8217;ll do). As the currency tumbled, Q2 nominal export income grew quickly over the quarter for the top 5 economies in the Eurozone:
<ul>
<li>Germany, 6%</li>
<li>France, 4.6%</li>
<li>Italy, 8.3%</li>
<li>Spain, 0.8% (definitely the exception to the rule)</li>
<li>Netherlands, 7.2%</li>
</ul>
<p>The export income is welcome in Italy&#8217;s economy, one of the PIIGS countries (Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece, and Spain). But what about Greece, or the rest of the PIIGS countries that desperately need the external income?</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/TGrn6vlxztI/AAAAAAAADNI/tKuVChtM8as/s1600/export_chart.png"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/TGrn6vlxztI/AAAAAAAADNI/tKuVChtM8as/s400/export_chart.png" alt="" border="0"></a>Well, Greece actually did quite well in Q2: nominal export income was up 5.8% over the quarter compared to a 0.1% decline in Q1. Perfect &#8211; that&#8217;s the point, right? Nominal depreciation begets external economic support via exports?<a name="more"></a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s not enough. The problem is, that the external support generated by a euro depreciation is too evenly distributed across the &#8220;Zone&#8221;. The result: those economies with both external and domestic demand posted record growth rates (i.e., Germany), while those with an overwhelming contraction in domestic demand posted further GDP declines amid reasonable external demand growth.</p>
<p>The chart below illustrates the pattern in GDP quarterly growth for Eurostat&#8217;s reporting countries, ranked by Q2 2010 growth rates in order of smallest (Greece, -1.5%) to largest (Germany, +2.2%).</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/TGro0QYUrzI/AAAAAAAADNY/63iuH_Mln6M/s1600/gdp_chart.png"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/TGro0QYUrzI/AAAAAAAADNY/63iuH_Mln6M/s400/gdp_chart.png" alt="" border="0"></a><br />It should be noted here that the Eurostat data is a <a href="http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_PUBLIC/2-13082010-BP/EN/2-13082010-BP-EN.PDF">&#8220;Flash&#8221; report of Eurozone GDP</a> only. The breakdown by spending category will not be reported until the second GDP release, which is scheduled for September 2, 2010. Therefore, the nominal export numbers, which are seasonally and working day adjusted through June 2010 (the volume indexes are only available through May 2010), proxy the strength of external demand.</p>
<p>The interesting thing is that export growth is likely strong enough to keep the third largest (as of Q2 2010) Eurozone economy, Italy, afloat for now. However, oncoming austerity measures (I searched for a list of announced European austerity measures, but only came up <a href="http://196.2.145.57/International/Austerity-measures-in-the-eurozone-20100715">with this</a> &#8211; do you know a credible source/link?) will drive the positive feedback loop: rising deficits &#8211; raise taxes/cut spending &#8211; cut domestic demand &#8211; taxable income falls &#8211; deficits rise.</p>

<p>Note: I included export data only, although the trade balance, which is exports minus imports, data tells a very similar story: widespread improvement in the trade balance.</p>

<blockquote>There is no reason to think that the bulk of current unemployment is any sense &#8220;structural&#8221;: if aggregate demand were higher it would melt away just as unemployment in 1982 melted away.</p></blockquote>
<p>The following paragraph is more problematic, but could become self-fulfilling prophecy:<br />
<blockquote>There is good reason to think that if we do nothing for the next two years and unemployment remains elevated that a good deal of unemployment then will be &#8220;structural,&#8221; not amenable to being cured by aggregate demand.</p></blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;m not sure if I should post this here.  I think it might be stimulating.  However, I am ignorant and have no intention of learning (except from comments).  I feel free to display my ignorance after the jump.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>The conventional wisdom seems to be that we have to do something about the long term deficit, but that the parties can&#8217;t agree on what to do and the people aren&#8217;t willing to let them do what is necessary.  I think the conventional wisdom is totally wrong on each count.  </p>
<p>First, I don&#8217;t think we need to do anything.  That is, I think that under current law, the debt to GDP ratio will stabilize and decline.  Obviously I shouldn&#8217;t just think this.  I can check CBO forecasts and know one way or the other.  The standard view is that, under current law, the deficit would vanish in the medium term and return and grow to an unsustainable level as the population ages and Social Security and Medicare spending increases.  This was true last year, but I don&#8217;t think it is true now.  The change is that the ACA (health care reform)would (according to the CBO) bring the growth of Medicare spending under control unless the ACA is modified.  The CBO forecasts that, under current law, Medicare spending will grow to about 6% of GDP and level off (from about 4% now).  The CBO also forecasts that Social Security OASDI spending will grow 1.2% of GDP and level off.  </p>
<p>So the long term current law deficits seem to me to be about 3.2% of GDP.  The long term inflation forecast is 2% and the long term read GDP growth forecast is 2 to 3% s, it seems to me that the debt to GDP ratio is forecast to decrease 1 to 2% per year over the long term.  That&#8217;s sustainable.  I think the conventional wisdom has not accepted the CBOs forecast of Medicare spending under current law (of course the conventional wisdom has still not accepted the idea that Medicare and Social Security OASDI are two different programs).  Or maybe &#8220;do something&#8221; includes &#8220;leave the current laws unchanged.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;d even guess that deficits will be sustainable forever under current law plus doc fixes and AMT fixes, but that really is just a guess.</p>
<p>However, there is no chance at all that we won&#8217;t do something and, in particular, no chance that Bush tax cuts for the non-rich won&#8217;t be extended.  I&#8217;d say the main problem isn&#8217;t that the parties can&#8217;t agree on what to do but that they can agree to create unsustainable long term deficits.</p>
<p>As noted with more evidence in my post below, the US public seems perfectly willing to do what is necessary.  They are eager to soak the rich supporting allowing Bush tax cuts for families with income over $250,000 to expire and removing the FICA tax cap (and I think applying FICA to capital income).  I&#8217;m not sure a majority supports both measures, but I guess (again I am shamelessly guessing) that this would pretty much pay for the Bush tax cuts for the non rich and satisfy the Federal Governments intertemporal budget constraint.</p>
<p>Frankly, I think the long term deficit problem is that neither party is willing to follow the wish of the majority to massively increase taxes on the rich.</p>
<p>Please correct my errors of fact and logic in comments.</p>

<p>Jonathan <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&#038;q=%22fuck+brad+delong%22&#038;btnG=Search&#038;aq=f&#038;aqi=&#038;aql=&#038;oq=&#038;gs_rfai=">FBD</a> Weisman strikes again.  I blame <a href="http://motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2010/08/confused-about-taxes">Kevin Drum</a> for the fact that I read a <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703723504575425851623589976.html?mod=WSJ_hps_LEFTWhatsNews">grossly dishonest article of his in the Wall Street Journal.</a>   The article is about public attitudes on the deficit and on proposed solutions.    As a normal journalist, Weisman stresses anecdotes and only briefly mentions polling data.  <br />I list episodes of what I consider journalistic malpractice after the jump.   </p>
<p>The headline (not written by Weisman) contrasts with the text (written by Weisman or quotes chosen by Weisman).  The headline is “Voters Back Tough Steps to Reduce Budget Deficit.”  It isn’t that unusual for headlines to contradict the stories they head, but usually the evidence quoted in the article supports the article and not the headline.   Weisman manages the extraordinary accomplishment of presenting a less valid summary of the data he considered and wrote about than someone who just skimmed his article and wrote a few words under extreme time pressure. </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>After (finally quoting polls) Weisman hands the mike over to Gary C Peters to allow him to contradict the polling data (presented immediately above in Weisman’s contribution to journamalism).</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Folks want to cut the deficit, but they say, &#8216;Don&#8217;t touch my Social Security. Don&#8217;t touch my Medicare. Don&#8217;t cut defense spending, and don&#8217;t raise my taxes,&#8221;&#8216; said Rep. Gary C. Peters (D, Mich.), another member of the House budget-cutting task force. &#8220;This is going to take courage.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The data presented by Weisman in the paragraph immediately above say otherwise  </p>
<blockquote><p>the most recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll. In it, 74% said it would be acceptable to change Medicare to provide larger subsidies for low-income seniors, while cutting subsidies for the more affluent. Sixty-four percent would accept capping Medicare and Medicaid payments to health-care providers,</p></blockquote>
<p>Now one might interpret the cutting subsidies for the more affluent as meaning “more affluent than me” but capping payments to providers is exactly how the ACA restrains the growth of Medicare spending.  This is definitely a tough measure, and is definitely going to touch everyone’s medicare.  Either the poll is invalid or Peters is totally wrong.  Notably, capping payments to healthcare providers was exactly the hugest issue in US politics this Spring, with massive opposition.  The Republican party made its stand against exactly that.   They also denounced the individual mandate after supporting it for decades (and inventing the idea) and I assume they opposed eliminating the Medicare advantage boondoggle which they introduced, but their key issue, the one that put them ahead in the polls, is opposition to capping Medicare and Medicaid payments.  Also notably most Americans opposed those provisions of the ACA which most now support when a tiny bit of detail is added.   Weisman, however, pretends to have completely forgotten the whole health care reform debate.</p>
<p>He also allows Peters to argue that politicians will have to go against public opinion to balance the budget.  I think that before making such a claim, Peters would have to check what would happen if the social security tax were charged on all income and the Bush tax cuts for the rich were allowed to expire.   Both policies have majority support (Just above the Peters quote Weisman notes “58% backed subjecting incomes over $107,000 to Social Security taxes.”  I don&#8217;t know if he means “wage and salary incomes&#8221; since Social Security taxes are currently charged on wage and salary income not income, but hey I can’t expect a WSJ correspondent to know the difference can I ?).  </p>
<p>I think any remaining deficit would be small enough that the debt to GDP ratio would shrink.  Now this sure isn’t going to happen.  There is no way that Congress (or Obama) will accept elimination of the FICA ceiling.  This shows the problem is the exact opposite of that alleged by Peters.  The majority of Americans are willing to do what it takes to control the national debt (doing it to rich people).  Congress and the President are not willing.  </p>
<p>The nonsense Peters quote is the second to last paragraph in the article.  The last paragraph is much more bizarre </p>
<blockquote><p>Still, veterans of the budget wars see one reason for optimism in the subtle shifts in public opinion. Unlike politicians, most Americans don&#8217;t seem to place partisan blame on one party or another, so neither party can claim the high ground. &#8220;There&#8217;s no end in sight, and it&#8217;s both parties,&#8221; said Dani Saunders, 31, a conservative independent who keeps the books for her husband&#8217;s Richmond tattoo parlor.</p></blockquote>
<p>I don’t see why this is a reason for optimism.  It seems that <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&#038;as_q=ballance&#038;as_epq=&#038;as_oq=&#038;as_eq=&#038;num=10&#038;lr=&#038;as_filetype=&#038;ft=i&#038;as_sitesearch=rjwaldmann.blogspot.com&#038;as_qdr=all&#038;as_rights=&#038;as_occt=any&#038;cr=&#038;as_nlo=&#038;as_nhi=&#038;safe=images">ballance</a> has become such a central priority that it is considered grounds for optimism about the deficit that blame is assigned roughly equally.  I mention in passing that the evidence of the views of most Americans is a statement by a self declared conservative. It seems to me that Weisman considers the word “seems” to give him the result to make up claims of fact.   </p>
<p>More importantly, given the deficit reducing measures acceptable to the majority, any rational person would predict lower deficits if most Americans blamed the Republicans.  Republicans fought restraints on compensation of health care providers like death (panels).  Republicans certainly won’t raise taxes on rich people.  The only way the deficit will be brought under control is if the Democrats have a larger majority than their current majority.  That is, there are no grounds for optimism.</p>
<p>Further up, Weisman exposes his gross blatant contempt for facts in other ways.  He wrote “And complicating matters for Democrats, some liberal interest groups argue that Social Security is sound and in no need of serious change.” Weisman does not address the question of whether Social Security is sound.  The claim that it is is a problem for Democrats.  Deviation from the journalists conventional wisdom is definitely a bad thing, even if the journalists are demonstrably wrong, and the liberal interest groups are demonstrably right.  I assume Weisman thinks it is impossible to eliminate the deficit without cutting social security.  This is nonsense.   It is often repeated nonsense based on the invention of SocialSecurityandMedicare but it is still nonsense.  If Weisman were willing to read the arguments made by the liberal interest groups whom he considers to be a complication, he would know this (he would also probably suppress that knowledge being who he is).  </p>
<p>Worst of all he presents Paul Ryan’s “Roadmap” as exactly the sort of serious plan to deal with the deficit which is politically impossible.   Even he must know by now that the plan would lead to a deficit roughly as large as Obama’s proposals while increasing taxes on 95% of Americans and eliminating Medicare as we know it.  No passionate dedication to ignorance could have protected him from this knowledge.  Clearly he has decided that presenting Ryan as a hero is good copy and let the facts be damned. </p>
<p>Grounds for optimism ? After reading this article published in what was once a great newspaper I despair.</p>

                                <p>by: Daniel Becker<br />This is just a little something toward the “get to know your blogger” department of AB. It&#8217;s just in case anyone thinks that we have no real life. </p>
<p>Besides the 2 businesses, dealing with long term care issues for both parents (not even on the list of issues for this nation) and stimulating the economy by building my garage so that I can consolidate and stop paying rent, I&#8217;ve been jamming with some friends for a few years. </p>
<p>The goal was and is to be able to play out about once per month just for fun. All but one of us own a business, so it was decided from the get-go that this would not be as a supplement to our incomes. It was also decided that we were not going to be an Ipod (as in cover band), nor do general business. We like classic rock. Personally, my favorite is the late 60 to early 70&#8217;s, along with blues and Motown. We&#8217;re no polished act, but we manage to make a tune sound like music and at times even laugh with joy when we feel we&#8217;ve nailed it. You know, it&#8217;s that feeling you get when your loaded down and you go to that one thing in your life that you count on when you do it to give you the satisfaction that you can make something come out right and thus maintain a level head and not let anger turn to madness. </p>
<p>Well, we finally had our debut a couple weeks ago. Only took 5 years and 5 different people singing to get to this point. Who knew finding someone who wanted to sing and would stick around would be so difficult. If you&#8217;re curious, you can hear us playing <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GK-wbwowbOU">Alright Now</a>, our way.  Caution, it&#8217;s just a camera with recording ability that captured this, so the sound is not balanced the best. </p>

                                <p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/TGrjEZDyU1I/AAAAAAAABTw/NNThbIxi9jk/s1600/Clipboard02.bmp"><br /></a><br />I keep being told that the lower personal tax rates lead to greater business investments, especially by small businessmen that are not incorporated, those that flow their business income into their personal accounts so they are subject to the personal tax rates rather than the corporate tax code. Numerous, sophisticated econometric exist  that conclude that lower taxes lead to greater investment.  But interestingly, that all seem to use aggregate data on nonresidential fixed investment to support this conclusion.  I assumed that they used this data because the data on investment by small &#8220;Mom and Pop&#8221; firms as compared to investment by large corporations was not available.  So imagine my surprise when I found that the BEA published data on investment by legal form of organization.  It can be found at BEA.gov., Table 4.7.   Investment in Private Nonresidential Fixed Assets by Industry Group and Legal Form of Organization.</p>
<p>This data allows researchers to organize business investment into three groups.  First is corporations that are subject to the corporate tax code.  The second is sole proprietorship,partnerships and households that are subject to the individual tax code.  Third is nonprofits. Since 1980 corporations have accounted for some 81% of nonresidential fixed investments while those subject to the individual tax code accounted for 13% and tax exempts accounted for the remaining 6%.  But as this first chart shows the 13% figure is somewhat misleading as the share of investments attributable to those subject to the individual tax code as  declining irregularly from almost 3% of GDP in 1950 to some 1% of GDP in 2008.</p>
<p>Yes, the BEA data goes back to 1901 and that creates the first surprise in the data.  From 1901 through 1915 their was no income tax as it was introduced in 1916 &#8212; there had been an income tax during the Civil War but that tax was  declared unconstitutional.  The first surprise was that from 1901 to 1915 business fixed investment accounted for 10.5% of GDP, a smaller sum than the 11.1% of GDP in the 1916-29 era.  But of course the 1920s was considered to be an era of very strong capital spending much like the 1990s. But since 1950 business fixed investment has been 10.6% of GDP, almost exactly what it was from 1901 to 1915 when there was no income tax.  It may not be valid to compare eras so diverse as the 1901-15 period to the post-1950 period, but it does raise an interesting question of why didn&#8217;t investment fall after the income tax was introduced. If income taxes dampen investments one would have expected stronger investment in the pre-tax era.  This divergence is especially true if you look at the data on investment by organizations subject to the individual income tax.</p>

But this data shows that essentially all of the increase in capital spending in the 1960&#8217;s stemmed from higher investments by corporations as spending by individuals subject to the individual income tax actually declined  in the 1960s.<a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/TGrjEZDyU1I/AAAAAAAABTw/NNThbIxi9jk/s1600/Clipboard02.bmp"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/TGrjEZDyU1I/AAAAAAAABTw/NNThbIxi9jk/s320/Clipboard02.bmp" alt="" border="0"></a></p>
<p>If you want to attribute higher capital spending on lower taxes this data on the 1960&#8217;s strongly implies that it was accelerated depreciation for corporate investment that caused capital spending to rise  in the 1960&#8217;s, not lower taxes on individuals.<a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/TGrja0Sh1WI/AAAAAAAABT4/L2TCfjGezFk/s1600/Clipboard03.bmp"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/TGrja0Sh1WI/AAAAAAAABT4/L2TCfjGezFk/s320/Clipboard03.bmp" alt="" border="0"></a></p>
<p>Recently, Larry Kudlow has been attributing the 1990s investment boom  to the Clinton capital gains tax cut. But the boom was well underway  before the 1996 tax cut.  In the three years before the tax cut &#8211;1993,  94 &#038; 95 &#8212; business investment grew at a 10.5% average annual rate  and in the next three years &#8212; 1996, 97 &#038; 98 &#8212; under lower tax rates  the growth rate actually slowed to 9.3%. For those subject to the  individual tax code the slow down in growth was more severe, from 13.1%  to 9.2%.</p>

But it does not appear to support the theory either.  In particular I would ask the advocates of this theory why investment by those subject to the individual income taxes share of capital spending has dropped sharply during a period of falling personal income tax rates.  For all I know it is because small firms are incorporating much more now than historically.  After all, the effective corporate tax rate has fallen sharply during this period so maybe the advantages of incorporation have increased.  I come to the conclusion that the impact of persoanl tax rates on business investment is marginal, at best.  It is almost always swamped by other considerations like business profits, capacity utilization, the cost of capital and technology.<br />But this strongly conflicts with the standard position advocated by tax cutters and widely accepted by the business press.<br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/TGrj0-dZ5XI/AAAAAAAABUA/7eBQnGGf0js/s1600/Clipboard04.bmp"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/TGrj0-dZ5XI/AAAAAAAABUA/7eBQnGGf0js/s320/Clipboard04.bmp" alt="" border="0"></a></p>
<p>So tell me, why should I not stick with this conclusion?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/08/13/AR2010081306641.html?hpid=topnews">This article by David Hilzenrath in the Washington Post is interesting.</a>  The news is that an internal inspection for Transocean use reported that some equipment (two cranes) had to be replaced and could not be used, but the official inspection outsourced to a private firm, concluded that everything was fine (this is the rig which burned and sank causing the huge BP spill).    I learned how little I know about regulation of drilling rigs.  First, they are considered ships and, therefore, are licensed by the nation where they are registered.  The Marshall Islands decided that it was fine for the Deepwater Horizon to drill in the gulf.  This is crazy.  Drilling rigs are not like freight ships.   If a country regulates who can drill somewhere, they should regulate the equipment.  This is an obvious reform, which will never happen.</p>
<p>Second, like the Marshall Islands, the USA outsources inspections to firms hired by those they inspect (like ratings agencies).   This second bit of insanity is a recent innovation introduced by the Coast Guard in 1995 back when the guy who signed the commodity futures modernization act was President.   There is no hint in the article that Congress made the executive branch do this.  I think it was part of Reinventing Government TM.  </p>
<p>I think it’s past time for a serious reassessment of Clinton.    For one thing, I would like to know which other chicken coops are guarded by foxes, before the chickens come home to roost.</p>
