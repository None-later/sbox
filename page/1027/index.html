                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Dear Congressional Republicans,</p>
<p>I hear that you’re having difficulties in figuring out how to pay for the $100-$200 billion in new government spending that the President has effectively committed you to come up with.  Apparently the President <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/20/AR2005092001704.html">hasn’t offered any suggestions</a> to help you, which is probably what prompted Senator Burns (R-MT) to plead with the administration to “at least give us some idea [of how to cover the cost]”.</p>
<p>To help you out, I’d like to provide the following quick and easy guide to the options for paying for $200 billion in new spending over the next couple of years.
<ol>
<li><strong>Cut domestic discretionary spending.</strong>  According to the latest White House <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2006/pdf/06msr.pdf">budget estimates</a>, domestic discretionary programs will cost about $390 billion in 2006 and 2007.  So cutting this spending by about 25% would do the trick.  Put another way, you would need to cut non-defense discretionary spending back to where it was seven years ago (1998), when the economy was about 70% of the size of today’s economy, and when there were 20 million fewer people in the US.</p>
<p>I’m sure that eliminating fully one-quarter of the federal spending on education, highways, food safety, national parks, science and technology research, environmental protection, and agricultural subsidies will be quite popular.  Perhaps people would even let you know just how popular such cuts are in the 2006 election!</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Cut defense spending.</strong>  Since the White House has requested $451bn for defense and security spending in 2006 before supplemental appropriations are taken into account, and will request an additional $50bn in 2006 and $80bn in 2007 (according to <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdoc.cfm?index=6609&#038;type=1">CBO estimates</a>), defense spending would need to be reduced by about 15-20% to pay for Katrina.  This would push defense spending all the way back to&#8230; well, to 2003 levels, when total defense spending was around $400bn.
</li>
<li><strong>Cut mandatory spending.</strong>  Since Social Security spending for 2006 and 2007 is legally and politically off the table, other forms of mandatory spending (e.g. Medicare, Medicaid, veterans benefits, etc) would need to be cut from a projected $800bn in 2006 by about 10%.  Again, this might prove popular, especially with senior citizens; we would find out in 2006!
</li>
<li><strong>Undo some of the Bush tax cuts.</strong>  The CBO has estimated that the various Bush tax cuts will cost about $165bn in 2006 and $187bn in 2007, so reversing about half of these tax cuts for two years would cover the cost of the Katrina reconstruction.  According to the <a href="http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/home/index.cfm">Tax Policy Center</a> you could accomplish that by keeping the Bush tax cuts in place for 95% of Americans, and restoring tax rates to 2000 levels for the 5% of US households with the highest income (roughly those earning over $150,000 per year).
</li>
<li><strong>Increase the deficit.</strong>  You could simply choose to add the $200bn tab to the massive, multi-trillion dollar bill that the Bush administration is already passing on to today’s children as a direct result of its fiscal choices.  I can&#8217;t imagine that a Republican Congress would ever choose to do this, though.</li>
</ol>
<p>I hope it is helpful to have the options spelled out for you, since you seem to be needing some guidance.  </p>
<p>Which alternative will you choose?  Let me guess&#8230;</p>
<p>Best regards,<br />Kash</p>

<blockquote><p>NEW YORK (AP) &#8211; Anti-war activist Cindy Sheehan said Tuesday she was hurt slightly in a scuffle that erupted when police broke up a rally as she was at the microphone. An organizer was arrested and charged with using a loudspeaker without a permit. &#8220;I was speaking and someone grabbed my backpack and pulled me back pretty roughly,&#8221; Sheehan said, describing the scene at Manhattan&#8217;s Union Square on Monday. &#8220;I was shoved around.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, I understand that protesting Bush’s invasion of Iraq makes him uncomfortable – but what gives the NYC police the right to stop a speech against our continued military presence in Iraq?  Besides, what was the need to rough up the mother of one of our fallen soldiers?</p>

As usual with this Administration, they pat themselves on the back as they blame Bill Clinton:</p>
<blockquote><p>The policies that this President has pursued are bold ones and they are ones that are achieving real results for all Americans. The President, from day one, has been acting to move forward on bold initiatives to produce real results that are helping all Americans. We are closing the achievement gap with sweeping education reforms, so that every child can learn and succeed. We are moving forward on pro-growth economic policies that are creating jobs. We have more Americans working now than ever before. We&#8217;re reaching out to faith-based groups and community organizations that have proven records of helping people in need. And we&#8217;re now helping more people in need. And we&#8217;re also moving forward to expand home ownership. Minority home ownership has reached record levels under this administration. We&#8217;ve worked to expand community health centers. So I think it&#8217;s important to look at the policies, and we&#8217;re glad to talk about the policies. And one question you have to come back to is, do we continue to move forward on failed policies of the past that have left too many behind, or do we think in new and bold ways to help all Americans. And this President has thought in new and bold ways and actually acted. And we are making great progress to do so. </p></blockquote>
<p>As our chart shows, the poverty rate fell from 15.1% to 11.3% from 1993 to 2000 only to increase each year since George W. Bush took over.  So when Scott McClennan talks about real results versus the failed policies of the past, one has to wonder what he is talking about.  </p>
<p>One can argue that the decline in poverty during the Clinton years was due to strong economic growth during his term in office, while the rise in poverty over the past few years is in part due to weak economic performance.  Never mind the assertions by Ari Fleischer to the contrary, poverty does tend to fall when economic growth is strong,  But Mr. McClennan is not in a very good position to make this argument given the rest of his press briefing:<br />
<blockquote>Q If he was so bold, why do we have 37 million people living below the poverty line?<br />MR. McCLELLAN: Well, do you want me to go back and talk about the economy? <br />Q I mean, if his policies are so great. <br />MR. McCLELLAN: I&#8217;ll be glad to go &#8212; more Americans are working than ever before, Helen. We&#8217;ve &#8211;<br />Q Thirty-seven million below the poverty &#8211;<br />MR. McCLELLAN: &#8211; seen the unemployment rate drop to 4.9 percent because of the action that this President has taken. We&#8217;ve seen more than 4 million jobs created since May of 2003. </p></blockquote>
<p>I guess it is too much to ask for this White House to actually implement sensible economic policies that would reduce poverty.  But couldn’t we simply ask the press secretary to have a little integrity?</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/09/18/katrina.cost/index.html">CNN</a> notes:<br />
<blockquote>WASHINGTON (CNN) &#8211; Since the president prefers not to raise taxes to finance Hurricane Katrina recovery, three senators suggested Sunday that Congress cut spending, delay a Medicare prescription benefit and forego a tax cut for the rich.  Senate Democrat Joe Biden from Delaware suggested sacrificing a cut in estate taxes, and Republicans Lindsey Graham and John Kyl put political &#8220;pork&#8221; in the budgetary cross hairs.</p></blockquote>
<p>President Clinton appeared on ABC’s <a href="http://www.abcnews.go.com/ThisWeek/HurricaneKatrina/story?id=1136801&#038;page=1">This Week</a>:<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;Tax cuts are always popular,&#8221; Clinton said. &#8220;But about half of these tax cuts since 2001 have gone to people in my income group, the top 1 percent. I&#8217;ve gotten four tax cuts. &#8220;Now, what Americans need to understand is that that means every single day of the year, our government goes into the market and borrows money from other countries to finance Iraq, Afghanistan, Katrina, and our tax cuts,&#8221; Clinton added. &#8220;We depend on Japan, China, the United Kingdom, Saudi Arabia, and Korea primarily to basically loan us money every day of the year to cover my tax cut and these conflicts and Katrina. I don&#8217;t think it makes any sense. I think it&#8217;s wrong.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://online.wsj.com/article_email/0,,SB112683100347942461-IBjgINklaJ4npyvaoCHbKuDm4,00.html">Senator Coburn</a> is similarly upset with Bush’s spend and borrow fiscal policy:<br />
<blockquote>The open-ended commitment by President Bush and congressional leaders to rebuild New Orleans and the Gulf Coast is stoking anger among conservatives over the Republican government&#8217;s record of higher spending and debt. Following the nation&#8217;s worst-ever natural disaster, no Republican in Congress is opposing federal aid that already totals $62 billion and is expected to exceed $200 billion. But the party&#8217;s conservative wing, led yesterday by Oklahoma&#8217;s Tom Coburn in the Senate and Rep. Mike Pence of Indiana in the House, is calling for offsetting &#8220;sacrifices&#8221; in federal spending. And they&#8217;re backed by a growing chorus of conservative activists, columnists and bloggers. &#8220;It&#8217;s not about taking care of the folks that need us,&#8221; Mr. Coburn said in an interview. &#8220;But I wouldn&#8217;t vote for another penny until we get real about the hard choices of cutting some spending.&#8221; In what would be a real break for conservatives, Mr. Coburn said he is also not inclined to vote to extend the Bush tax cuts absent some fiscal restraint.</p></blockquote>
<p>This story from Jackie Calmes, however, notes that not everyone in the GOP is as willing to cut government spending:<br />
<blockquote>Administration officials also express frustration that conservatives in Congress are criticizing the White House even as Congress has balked at making the Medicaid cuts that Mr. Bush had called for earlier this year. Also taking conservatives&#8217; hits is House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, after the Texas Republican this week told reporters that for all the complaints that hurricane spending must be offset by spending cuts, &#8220;nobody has been able to come up with any yet.&#8221; He suggested that the government has little fat. &#8220;After 11 years of Republican majority, we&#8217;ve pared it down pretty good,&#8221; he said.</p></blockquote>
<p>As knzn noted in one of his comments to <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/09/katrina-relief-ricardian-equivalence.html">this post</a>, the Katrina relief effort is akin to the straw that broke the camel’s back.  As the estimated Federal cost of the Katrina relief effort approaches the estimated Federal cost of our invasion of Iraq, I am reminded of William Kristol’s initial guess that the Iraq invasion would amount to a mere 0.1% of GDP.  OK, Kristol said one year’s worth of GDP but a Ricardian Equivalence or Domar Burden of the Debt type might argue that the interest costs on one of these one-time debt increasing events might amount to something near 0.1% of GDP.  However, Domar was referring to permanent increases in the operating surplus needed to cover one-time increases in Federal debt.  </p>
<p>With the non-interest portion of the Federal buget running at a negative 3% of GDP, with total Federal debt now in excess of 65% of GDP, with GWOT including the Department of Homeland Security, and with the White House wanting to make its tax cuts permanent, the cuts proposed by conservatives such as <a href="http://instapundit.com/archives/025583.php">Glenn Reynolds </a> should make <a href="http://www.pandagon.net/archives/2005/09/did_you_know_th.html">Jesse Taylor</a> laugh.  But to Glenn’s credit, his list seems to be the best game in town.  And the sad part is that President Bush has yet to walk the walk even if he has been talking the talk for four and a half years.  And even if he does walk the walk finally, let’s not forget that the cost of the Rx bill start next year.</p>

                                <p>How can the US aspire to an &#8220;Ownership Society&#8221;, when in reality the nation is mortgaging its future, or in the <a href="http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/2004ltr.pdf">words</a> of Warren Buffett, becoming a &#8220;Sharecropper&#8217;s Society.&#8221;? And how can the US revel in slightly above trend GDP growth that comes at the expense of massive quantities of new consumer and government debt?</p>
<p>This week the Bureau of Economic Analysis <a href="http://www.bea.gov/bea/newsrel/transnewsrelease.htm">reported</a> the Current Account Deficit (CAD) for the 2nd quarter. Seasonally adjusted the CAD was <i>only</i> $195.7 Billion, but on a Not Seasonally Adjusted basis, the deficit was another new record (see first graph):</p>
<p><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/img/243/2888/640/CADquarterly.jpg"><img src="http://photos1.blogger.com/img/243/2888/320/CADquarterly.jpg" border="0"></a><br /><i>Click on graphs for larger images.</i></p>
<p>For the year, Dr. Setser <a href="http://www.rgemonitor.com/blog/setser/101016">projects</a> the current account deficit at $820 Billion. Based on the first two quarters and the current trend that estimate seems very reasonable. The following graph shows the CAD as a percent of GDP (2005 estimated):</p>
<p><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/img/243/2888/640/CADannual.jpg"><img src="http://photos1.blogger.com/img/243/2888/320/CADannual.jpg" border="0"></a></p>
<p>This imbalance is a growing concern for the world economy.  Dr. Setser expresses his concern that &#8220;&#8230; financing [the deficit] may be a bit more difficult in 2006 than in 2005&#8221;.  It might be time to discuss the possibilities of a <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/04/evaluating-soft-landing-scenario.html">soft landing</a> again.  I think a hard landing is becoming ever more likely.</p>
<p>NOTE: Congratulations to Brad Setser on <a href="http://www.rgemonitor.com/blog/setser/101031">one year of blogging</a>!</p>
<p>But the &#8220;Debtor Society&#8221; is more than just debt to foreigners: the US Government continues to pile up debt at a record pace and US consumers are following suit.  The <a href="http://www.publicdebt.treas.gov/opd/opd.htm">National Debt</a> has increased $539 Billion so far this fiscal year; essentially the same rate as last year despite the claims of &#8220;deficit reduction&#8221; from the Bush Administration.</p>
<p>And for consumers, the FED&#8217;s <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/z1/">Flow of Funds</a> report will be released on Wednesday for the 2nd quarter.  The report will probably show significant quantities of new consumer debt, especially mortgage debt as the housing boom continued.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Ownership Society&#8221;?  I think &#8220;Debtor Society&#8221; is more appropriate.</p>

                                <p>Credit should go to conservatives like <a href="http://voxbaby.blogspot.com/2005/09/katrina-tax-surcharge.html">Andrew Samwick</a> who object to Bush’s free lunch philosophy:</p>
<blockquote><p>If we can handle it now, why weren&#8217;t we handling it before? Why does rebuilding New Orleans compete favorably with this unspecified set of least useful programs, but not funding Social Security personal retirement accounts? Or the new Medicare prescription drug benefit? Or simply lowering the debt burden on future generations? But I digress. If we have decided that rebuilding New Orleans to the tune of $200 billion is a national objective (and I haven&#8217;t seen nearly enough debate on that subject in the Capitol), then we ought to fund it by reducing our consumption of everything else. The simplest way to do that would be to impose an income tax surcharge that funds the rebuilding over a given period … Taxes may be bad, but deficits are surely worse. What&#8217;s the explanation for why future generations should have to pay for this one, too?</p></blockquote>
<p>The only attempt to rationalize Bush’s call for even larger deficits seems to come from this proponent of <a href="http://www.everyonesillusion.com/archives/2005/09/katrina_and_def.htm">Ricardian Equivalence</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The mistake he is making is forgetting the Friedman idea that the burden of government is not what it taxes but what it spends. Once President Bush (and Congress) decide to spend $200 billion to rebuild New Orleans it becomes our burden, how they finance it is irrelevant. The government has only two options, it can raise taxes by $200billion or issue $200billion in debt (I suppose it could do some combination of the two), and either way the present value of the liability is the same no matter how they finance it. The future generation argument is a red herring; if Andrew Samwick is worried about it he can simply buy a treasury bond representing his children’s share of the debt and gift it to them. When their bill comes do they can sell the bond to pay for it. If Andrew does not have the money to buy the bond then he would not have the money to pay for the tax increase. </p></blockquote>
<p>Jacob’s Ricardian Equivalence argument is not inconsistent with Andrew Samwick’s argument as both are predicated on the realization that there is a long-run government constraint.  Jacob is assuming that all members of my generation have been saving our tax cuts so we can bequest the funds to our grandchildren who will have the responsibility for mailing in very large checks to the Treasury in the future.  </p>
<p>We heard the same argument a generation ago when Reagan cut taxes but kept spending high.  Yet, consumption rose during the 1980’s.  It is a fair point that consumption as a share of GDP did not decline during the more fiscally responsible 1990’s.  As our first graph shows, the Bush tax cuts have been consumed not saved. </p>

<p>On the nature of Bush’s spending spree, let’s have <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9379241">Fareed Zakaria</a> step up to the microphone:</p>
<blockquote><p>President Bush explains that he will spend hundreds of billions of dollars rebuilding the Gulf Coast without raising any new revenues. Republican leader Tom DeLay declines any spending cuts because &#8220;there is no fat left to cut in the federal budget.&#8221; This would be funny if it weren&#8217;t so depressing. What is happening in Washington today is business as usual in the face of a national catastrophe. The scariest part is that we&#8217;ve been here before. After 9/11 we have created a new government agency, massively increased domestic spending and fought two wars. And the president did all this without rolling back any of his tax cuts—in fact, he expanded them—and refused to veto a single congressional spending bill. This was possible because Bush inherited a huge budget surplus in 2000. But that&#8217;s all gone. The cupboard is now bare. Whatever his other accomplishments, Bush will go down in history as the most fiscally irresponsible chief executive in American history. Since 2001, government spending has gone up from $1.86 trillion to $2.48 trillion, a 33 percent rise in four years! Defense and Homeland Security are not the only culprits. Domestic spending is actually up 36 percent in the same period. These figures come from the libertarian Cato Institute&#8217;s excellent report &#8220;The Grand Old Spending Party,&#8221; which explains that &#8220;throughout the past 40 years, most presidents have cut or restrained lower-priority spending to make room for higher-priority spending. What is driving George W. Bush&#8217;s budget bloat is a reversal of that trend.&#8221; To govern is to choose. And Bush has decided not to choose. He wants guns and butter and tax cuts. People wonder whether we can afford Iraq and Katrina. The answer is, easily. What we can&#8217;t afford simultaneously is $1.4 trillion in tax cuts and more than $1 trillion in new entitlement spending over the next 10 years. To take one example, if Congress did not make permanent just one of its tax cuts, the repeal of estate taxes, it would generate $290 billion over the next decade. That itself pays for most of Katrina and Iraq. Robert Hormats of Goldman Sachs has pointed out that previous presidents acted differently. During World War II, Franklin Roosevelt cut nonwar spending by more than 20 percent, in addition to raising taxes to finance the war effort. During the Korean War, President Truman cut non-defense spending 28 percent and raised taxes to pay the bills. In both cases these presidents were often slashing cherished New Deal programs that they had created. The only period—other than the current one—when the United States avoided hard choices was Vietnam: spending increased on all fronts. The results eventually were deficits, high interest rates and low growth—stagflation.</p></blockquote>
<p>Following-up on Robert Hormat’s point about FDR raising taxes during World War II, our second graph shows the consumption/GDP ratio from 1929 to 1950.  While the increase in defense spending did crowd out investment, part of the brunt was borne by a drop in consumption.  Bush’s free lunch philosophy seems to be to tell the current generation to go ahead and consume more as the Federal government spends more.  As a result, our national savings is very low, which means we are pursuing anti-growth policies under the umbrella of free lunch “supply-side economics”.</p>

                                <p>Question: what do the following two headline stories have in common?  Answer: they are the most important logistical endeavors and tests of management competence that the Bush administration has faced.  From the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/18/international/middleeast/18najaf.html?ei=5094&#038;en=c8d3a0d8792e6a90&#038;hp=&#038;ex=1127102400&#038;adxnnl=1&#038;partner=homepage&#038;adxnnlx=1127045476-/aCabh2cCjE9JAiqcvhlbQ">New York Times</a>:<br />
<blockquote><strong>Poor Planning and Corruption Hobble Reconstruction of Iraq</strong> </p>
<p>The United States has poured more than $200 million into reconstruction projects in [Najaf], part of the $10 billion it has spent to rebuild Iraq. Najaf is widely cited by the military as one of the success stories in that effort, but American officers involved in the rebuilding say that reconstruction projects here, as elsewhere in the country, are hobbled by poor planning, corrupt contractors and a lack of continuity among the rotating coalition officers charged with overseeing the spending.</p></blockquote>
<p>And from the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/17/AR2005091701392.html">Washington Post</a>:<br />
<blockquote><strong>Lack of Cohesion Bedevils Recovery<br />Red Tape, Lapses in Planning Stall Relief</strong></p>
<p>Three weeks after Hurricane Katrina struck, red tape and poor planning have left thousands of evacuees without basic services, according to local and state officials, public policy experts and survivors themselves.</p>
<p>Hundreds of thousands of people from New Orleans and Gulf Coast communities have fled, sometimes to neighboring states and beyond, moving in with friends and family or into shelters, public housing and hotels funded by the Red Cross. With little guidance from federal and state governments &#8212; and no single person or entity in charge of the overall operation &#8212; cities and counties have been left on their own to find survivors homes, schools, jobs and health care. A patchwork of policies has resulted, causing relief agencies to sometimes work at cross-purposes.</p></blockquote>
<p>The similarities in the goals of these two endeavors are striking, as are the similarities in their outcomes to date.  These two massive undertakings are, above all, enormous management challanges &#8211; and clearly they have both been managed very ineffectively so far.  There have been some successes in Iraq, to be sure &#8211; thanks to the excellent efforts of many of the individuals on the ground there.  But an awful lot of other things have been done breathtakingly poorly, thanks to the bad leadership and bad management that the Bush administration seems unable or unwilling to fix, even after years of awful results.  </p>
<p>Running the government poorly has consequences.  Those consequences have been mostly borne by the citizens of Iraq so far (and only very indirectly by US taxpayers), but now the residents of the Gulf coast are feeling their effects first-hand. I hope that I&#8217;m wrong, but the sad history of the US reconstruction effort in Iraq provides a grim suggestion of what we may expect in New Orleans over the next few years.  </p>

                                <p>Dan Froomkin does a good job today of covering how Bush&#8217;s speech last night was rather odd, in many ways, coming from someone who is self-described as &#8216;conservative&#8217;.  Some of the media analysis brought together in <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/blog/2005/09/16/BL2005091601005_3.html">Froomkin&#8217;s column today</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Mr. Big Government</strong>
<ul>
<li>Michael Tackett writes in the Chicago Tribune about what he calls Bush&#8217;s &#8220;act of political contortion&#8221; last night.  &#8220;Government was no longer the problem. Government was now the solution. Federal spending was not to be curtailed. Record federal spending would have his full backing&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;Throughout his nationally broadcast address from a shattered New Orleans, it was as though the disaster of Hurricane Katrina had transformed the president from the logical heir to Ronald Reagan to some curious amalgam of Franklin Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson.&#8221;</p>
</li>
<li>Tom Raum writes for the Associated Press: &#8220;The era of big government is back.  President Bush is presiding over the most expensive government relief and reconstruction operation in U.S. history, casting aside budget discipline.  Bush and his Republican allies in Congress are deferring &#8212; for now &#8212; vows to finish the Reagan revolution against big government and turning to some of the same kinds of public health, housing and job assistance programs they once criticized as legacies of the Democrats&#8217; New Deal and Great Society.&#8221;
</li>
<li>Mark Whitaker of Newsweek had this to say: &#8220;I think whatever you think of all of this I think we should all step back and appreciate the irony of a president who ran for office originally in 2000 talking about limited government and a humble foreign policy who now sounds like Woodrow Wilson wanting to spread democracy around the world and abroad and now, at least in terms of this crisis, sounds a little bit like FDR or at least Clinton in one of his State of the Union moments. So, you know, there&#8217;s a lot about the red/blue divide in America but I can tell you that being a conservative doesn&#8217;t mean anymore what it used to mean.&#8221;
</li>
<li>Over on MSNBC, chatting with Chris Matthews, conservative talk show host Joe Scarborough said: &#8220;This was a speech that really could have been delivered by Lyndon Johnson or Franklin Roosevelt&#8230; This sounds like the W.P.A. on steroids.&#8221;
</li>
<li>Bush spoke dramatically about race:
<p>&#8220;Within the Gulf region are some of the most beautiful and historic places in America. As all of us saw on television, there is also some deep, persistent poverty in this region as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;That poverty has roots in a history of racial discrimination, which cut off generations from the opportunity of America. We have a duty to confront this poverty with bold action.</p>
<p>&#8220;So let us restore all that we have cherished from yesterday, and let us rise above the legacy of inequality.&#8221;</p>
<p>But consider what conservative talk-show host Tucker Carlson told Matthews on MSNBC last night: &#8220;The principal that people are poor because they&#8217;re discriminated against and the federal government can set that right by social spending . . . is a liberal idea. . . . This is what liberals say &#8212; it&#8217;s not at all what conservatives say &#8212; and the conservatives watching the speech tonight who noticed that line are sitting bolt upright right now and thinking, did I just hear him say that? </li>

<p>Many of us have pointed out for years that Bush could possibly be called a &#8220;big-government conservative&#8221;, or a &#8220;borrow-and-spend conservative&#8221;, but not a traditional conservative.  In that sense, these media revelations are a bit late.  And of course, with Karl Rove in charge of the reconstruction along the Gulf Coast, it remains to be seen to what degree Bush&#8217;s pledges simply amount to a handout to big business.</p>
<p>However, it is striking to me that, the more unpopular Bush gets in the wake of Katrina, the more desperately he is trying to grab the rhetoric and policy prescriptions of the Democratic party of the 1960s, and <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/15/AR2005091502200.html">drop the policy prescriptions</a> of the Republican party of the 2000s.  Even if the Bush/Rove plan is to simply use big-government rhetoric as a route to new heights of political patronage, the Republican leadership today seems to believe that espousing traditional Democratic policies, and not Republican policies, is the path to greater popularity.</p>
<p>It is also striking to me that Bush has so publicly agreed with the line of reasoning that  much or most of the poverty faced by African Americans in the US today is directly due to past and present racism and the legacy of slavery &#8211; and that he agrees with the traditional Democractic conclusion that African Americans are therefore entitled to greater sensitivity and assistance from the government.  </p>
<p>And it is very striking to me that Bush is no longer simply increasing government spending because it is the path of least resistance (which is what the Bush spending increases of the past 4 years might have been); rather, Bush is now explicitly and publicly agreeing with one of the central presumptions of liberals and progressives, and publicly rejecting the central tenet of traditional Republicans, by saying that he believes that the government is not the problem, but rather is the solution.  Barry Goldwater and Ronald Reagan must be turning over in their graves.</p>

<p>UPDATE: <a href="http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/001610.html">Max Sawicky has more</a> on this subject, including the following priceless prose:<br />
<blockquote>However messy the use of money becomes in the hands of the Bushists, I maintain that this is a watershed moment for the limited-government movement. What we have in this Administration is an unwholesome mixture &#8212; the term toxic soup comes to mind &#8212; of Christian fundy prejudice (towards non-Christians, science, and the Enlightenment), Wilsonian jingoism, and blind anti-tax sentiment. Big, stupid government is all over your bedroom and your public schools, driving your kids further into debt, rattling an insubstantial sabre at a legion of emboldened international miscreants. These people will be the death of us all.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>New figures were just released this morning about the US current account deficit during the April-June period of 2005.  From <a href="http://www.bea.gov/bea/newsrel/transnewsrelease.htm">the BEA release</a>:<br />
<blockquote>The U.S. current-account deficit&#8211;the combined balances on trade in goods and services, income, and net unilateral current transfers&#8211;decreased to $195.7 billion in the second quarter of 2005 (preliminary) from $198.7 billion (revised) in the first quarter.  The decrease was more than accounted for by a decrease in net outflows for unilateral current transfers. </p>
<p>&#8230;Net recorded financial inflows&#8211;net acquisitions by foreign residents of assets in the United States less net acquisitions by U.S. residents of assets abroad&#8211;were $142.3 billion in the second quarter, down from $161.9 billion in the first.  Financial outflows for U.S.-owned assets abroad picked up more than financial inflows for foreign-owned assets in the United States.</p></blockquote>
<p>The rest of the world continued to finance the US&#8217;s immense borrowing needs during the second quarter of 2005.  Much of this financing continued to come from foreign central banks, which accumulated $82bn worth of US assets, largely in the form of US government bonds and agency issues.  But private foreign investors also poured money into the US to accumulate US stocks, bonds other than US Treasuries, and bank account balances, to the tune of some $310bn during the quarter.  This represents the second-highest rate of private foreign investment in the US ever.</p>
