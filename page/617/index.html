                                                                    </div>

                                <p>It seems that I cannot criticize absurd proposals from pandering politicians unless I have some magic wand solution – at least according to a couple of AB readers.  Well – I’ve just outsourced this task to <a href="http://2dinar.com/articles/105.html">2Dinar</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>A large portion of Americans, including those in the White House, think that drilling for oil domestically could help reduce America’s reliance on foreign oil and help us reclaim a measure of energy independence as well as alleviate the economic downturn that current oil prices are inducing. This week the Times reported that President Bush is seeking to repeal a ban against offshore drilling in Florida that his father President Bush (41) implemented. He and Vice President Cheney have long campaigned for exploitation of the Arctic North Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) in Alaska, but have been defeated in Congress. Should we pursue a domestic drilling strategy to help stem foreign oil dependence? Long answer: Yes, if we were Saudi Arabia. Short answer: No.</p></blockquote>
<p>You might wonder if we’ve lost our marbles by assuming Saudi Arabia is part of the U.S.  Well, that’s nothing another 8 years of neocon rule couldn’t solve.  More seriously, 2Dinar notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Oil is a highly volatile commodity, and as the lifeblood for industry, its value is analyzed, gambled on, and traded just like debt, which means that intangibles outside of the world of refinement and distribution can drastically affect its price. Additionally, worldwide demand from growing economies (including ours) has increased while the oil industry has not grown its production or reserve capability at a comparable rate. An article by Keith Sill, an economist with the research department of the Philadelphia Fed, said that most oil shocks have been associated with conflict in the Middle East, and indeed, without even counting the major wars in that region, concerns about the vulnerability of the Saudi oil production apparatus to terrorist attack have probably floated the oil price substantially on their own. Oil is volatile, and its price reflects far more than simply how much OPEC is pulling out of the ground. Of the world oil reserves, estimated at 1.1 trillion barrels, 23% is located in Saudi Arabia, 16% in Canada (the largest supplier of oil to the US), 12% in Iran, and 10% in Iraq. The US holds less than 3% of the world’s proven reserves. Despite these statistics, the US accounts for 26% of world oil consumption, a staggering 20.8 million barrels a day and over 1.4 times the total consumption of the EU despite having an economy 12% smaller than the EU and a population 39% smaller.</p></blockquote>
<p>On second thought, maybe we should ignore the neocons and their call for more wars in the Middle East.  OK, we’d have to pay the Saudis for their oil but with less instability, I think both we and they would be better off.</p>

                                <p>I heard Rich Lowry once say he also lives in Manhattan.  Now I realize my new home is an island but does <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=NTEwOTY4NmE0ZTVhN2E3YTQwZGFlYzRhZTM3N2M1MTA=">my neighbor</a> realize the same thing:</p>
<blockquote><p>The cost-benefit analysis of battling global warming is never going to make sense for Americans.  The places that would be hurt by global warming tend to be warm, wet, and low-lying. Think Bangladesh. For the U.S., warming isn’t much of a threat. So, stringent measures against global warming are really a massive foreign-aid program, but an intangible and speculative one. If the predicted warming materializes, and if it has the drastic effects warned about (e.g., big rises in sea levels), people living in faraway countries a century or more from now may be adversely affected — in short, a theoretical benefit to people as yet unborn.</p></blockquote>
<p>To suggest that Bangladesh will be the only place that suffers from global warming is beyond idiocy.  Now if Mr. Lowry thinks that losing the island of Manhattan will not be much of a loss, might I suggest he avoid saying that to his other neighbors.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p><a href="http://blogs.cfr.org/setser/2008/06/19/four-bits-of-information-to-help-understand-china-a-little-better-%E2%80%A6/#more-3613">Brad Setser</a> notes that China has decreased its subsidies on oil by about 17%, bringing its cost per barrel, according to Brad, to around $90. There is no question that China&#8217;s voracious appetite for energy&#8211;coal and oil&#8211;is putting price pressure on both commodities. Similarly, China&#8217;s oil subsidies are distorting world prices, driving them up. (See <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/20/world/asia/20china.html?_r=1&#038;oref=slogin">also</a>.) And, of course, China compounds its difficulty in maintaining a loose peg to the dollar. Relaxing the peg even more would certainly lessen the price of China&#8217;s oil. But the peg to the dollar supported its export machine, especially to the states. China is between a rock and a hard place.</p>
<p>Something has to give.</p>
<p>There are a number of implications here. First, China&#8217;s rapid growth is colliding with resource depletion&#8211;or resource limitation. Regardless of what position we take regarding total resources, those resources in the immediate future will not become available fast enough to meet accelerating demand. The world will have to tighten its belt. Those countries now enjoying massive account surpluses will fare better than those now deeply in debt. What the U.S. can expect is not only rising costs in essential commodities&#8211;energy and food, for example&#8211;but also rising costs in all that it imports from China and other developing countries&#8230;. and here the list is long, from electronics to wearing apparel. (See <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/18/business/worldbusiness/18invest.html">here</a>.)</p>
<p>While the U.S. may contemplate tax cuts or rebates&#8230;or whatever&#8230;in order to keep the consumer buying, it is ill prepared to do much more than slowly sink. Depreciating its currency to avoid debt seems less and less a viable option. For the U.S., the price of oil and goods will just climb higher. Using the consumer as leverage for import certificates seems useless. The latest tax rebates may be the last gasp for the consumer leverage. If rebates are our way of jump-starting a deeply debt-ridden economy, what do we have left? Those rebates will be used to buy imported goods!  The rebates will not stimulate manufacturing here.  And stimulating production here is the issue.</p>
<p>Import certificates for oil are obviously off the table. And what about everything else we import? Are we going to ramp up manufacturing to supply our needs here? Takes a while.</p>
<p>Secondly, as China becomes a more expensive export base&#8211;higher energy cost, rising labor expectations, etc&#8211;, some companies have adopted what is called a &#8220;China Plus One,&#8221; Vietnam often being the &#8220;One.&#8221; (See World Bank research project <a href="http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTCHIINDGLOECO/Resources/Fujita_Hamaguchi_draft2_ACCEPT_ALL.doc">The Coming Age of China Plus One</a>.)</p>
<p>As China phases out its tax differential between foreign and indigenous firms (foreign firms paid half the tax rate of indigenous firms), firms are looking elsewhere to keep their competitive edge.</p>
<p>Vietnam is offering such a tax edge along with plentiful cheap labor. Among the companies employing this strategy are Canon, Hanesbrands and Nike to name only a few.</p>
<p>The problem is that this chase for ever-cheaper labor and taxation must end. If consumers are being hard pressed&#8211;as in U.S.&#8211;, there will come a time that no matter what production advantages third world countries offer, those advantages will not be enough.</p>
<p>The rising cost of energy is not going to abate soon or quickly. We can certainly expect the rising cost of oil to affect not only the production of goods but also their transport costs. Even if the price of oil stays within the $130-$140 range, how long before this price radically affects everything we do and buy? The coming Saudi summit of producers and consumers will be closely watched. I have heard that drilling platforms and ships to carry oil are now in short supply.</p>
<p>Additionally, if commodity prices continue to climb, then poor&#8211;but safe&#8211;production havens will disappear. Companies seek countries that are free of turmoil, where the government is stable.</p>
<p>Successful dictatorships have always been at a premium. On this score, capitalism and communism seem to have found common ground. Unfortunately, this symbiotic relationship will fail.</p>
<p>Capitalistic countries&#8211;the U.S. especially&#8211;are enjoying the fruits of communistic labor and stability. Ironically, the flow of wealth is away from capitalistic countries, even while their multinational giants prosper. Communist countries see rapid industrialization as a catch-up game&#8230;and pay little regard to anything else, including their own labor force and environment. More socialistic countries seem to be better positioned than either. (Their labor force is happier&#8211;health care, education&#8211;and they seem to be moving more rapidly towards alternate energy sources.)</p>
<p>In any case, the current pattern of globalization seems to be running into the headwinds of available resources to say nothing of pollution.</p>

<p>There are many ways to erode government management and the public trust aside from careerist public officials: Two other ways I have seen are hiring out Advisory and Assistance Services and the second is contracting out entire functional organizations. The second is referred to as A-76.</p>
<p>Mark Mansfield Director of Public Affairs, Central Intelligence Agency, McLean, Va., <a href="http://www.blogger.com/%E2%80%9Dhttp://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/15/opinion/l15cia.html?_r=1&#038;oref=slogin%E2%80%9D">Letter to the editor</a> dated 13 June seen in NYTimes.com June 14, 2008. Said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The C.I.A., like other United States government agencies, employs contractors to acquire needed skills and expertise for set periods of time.&#8221;<br />Note the authoritative statement, by a professional ghostwriter, with the modifier &#8220;for set periods of time&#8221;.</p></blockquote>
<p>This implies the CIA is hiring individuals doing Advisory and Assistance Services, rather than actually contracting out interrogation sections. He creates the false image that CIA needs an interrogator for less than a year at a time. This means each year they write a new task order, on some form of basic ordering contract that goes on for years, to get around 5 USC 3109.</p>
<p>This is fairly common bureaucratic response and it is wrong. It is a misrepresentation of the on-going &#8220;requirement&#8221;, to contract for it annually is deceptive, the function is needed for the long term. This also gets around competitive sourcing, to avoid the analysis of whether the activity is an inherently governmental function as well as compare price of government workers versus contractors.</p>
<p>These types of analyses are required to outsource any commercial function or unit needed to run the government. It is specified in OMB Circular A-76. No one wants to use A-76 for this kind of thing because A-76 requires structure, competitive sourcing and auditable decisions. None of which DoD, Homeland Security nor CIA could stand to see the light of day.</p>
<p>A-76 requires them to look at competing whole sections doing work, like the interrogator section of directorate of intelligence, or competing grounds maintenance at the pentagon.</p>
<p>The circular and the Federal Activities Inventory Reform (FAIR) Act are a start to contracting out commercial activities. However, looking at the inventory I found no code for interrogator services, I suspect the department of labor using FAIR has not found any reason to think interrogators are commercial services type activities. So, Mr. Mansfield should not need to imply that contracting out interrogators is a time limited thing because it is a governmental function which cannot be contracted out.</p>
<p>However, they avoid FAIR and A-76 by hiring A&#038;AS contractors under FAR 37.105. When they do not look at contracting out sections they contract out government employees’ work and that of military members individually.</p>
<p>How A-76 works. Once an agency identifies a FAIR coded activity for competition it follows the rules established by OMB. It gets proposals from the existing government work force as well as interested contractors. It selects the low cost bidder and goes on to either keeping a streamlined government function or hiring a contractor to do the function. A new improvement to the process requires on going quality assurance……</p>
<p>The problem with A-76 contracts, as with Advisory and Assistance Services, is they are never afforded quality control, no one analyzes the poor performance and the scopes always rise so private contractors buy in because the government can never describe all the work done by a civil service unit.</p>
<p>This poor quality control persists and is aggravated by the on going process of contracting out government support to the point where the government soon has no one who knows what should be done and so no one who can tell if the taxpayer is getting their money’s worth.</p>
<p>It is easy to just take out the old contract and spend more money!<br />The shadow contracted government is progeny of a long line of compromises.<br />&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-<br />This one by ilsm</p>

                                <p>Some of the AB readers think that McCain has changed his mind on offshore drilling because of high gasoline prices.  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/20/opinion/20krugman.html?ex=1371614400&#038;en=58ff162aead6d2d8&#038;ei=5124&#038;partner=permalink&#038;exprod=permalink">Paul Krugman</a> exposes why this must be nonsense and offers a more plausible view:</p>
<blockquote><p>Blaming environmentalists for high energy prices, never mind the evidence, has been a hallmark of the Bush administration &#8230; And the administration has spent the last eight years trying to convince Congress that the key to America’s energy security is opening up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling — even though estimates from the Energy Information Administration suggest that drilling in the refuge would make very little difference to the energy outlook, and the oil companies themselves aren’t especially interested in punching holes in the tundra.  But it still comes as a surprise and a disappointment to see John McCain joining that unfortunate tradition &#8230; As many reports have noted, the McCain/Bush policy on offshore drilling doesn’t make sense as a response to $4-a-gallon gas: the White House’s own Energy Information Administration says that exploiting the outer shelf wouldn’t yield noticeable amounts of oil until the 2020s, and even at peak production its impact on oil prices would be “insignificant.”  But what I haven’t seen emphasized is the broader picture: Mr. McCain has now aligned himself with an administration that, even aside from its blame-the-environmental-movement tendencies, has established an extensive track record as the gang that couldn’t think straight about energy policy &#8230; So why would Mr. McCain associate himself with these characters? The answer, presumably, is that it’s a cynical political calculation. I’m reasonably sure that Mr. McCain’s advisers realize that offshore drilling would do nothing for current gas prices. But they may believe that the public can be conned. A Rasmussen poll taken before Mr. McCain’s announcement suggests that the public favors expanded offshore drilling, and believes (wrongly) that this would lower gasoline prices. And Mr. McCain may also hope to shore up his still fragile relations with the Republican base. As anyone who has read what’s in his inbox after publishing an article on oil prices can testify, there are many people on the right who believe that all our energy problems have been caused by sanctimonious tree-huggers. Mr. McCain has just thrown that constituency some red meat.</p></blockquote>
<p>Taking a poll – shoring up the rightwing base?   Makes sense to me.  A response to high gasoline prices?  Please – no one who has read the EIA reports we have mentioned would believe the latter.</p>
<p>Update: Another NYTimes <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/19/opinion/19thu1.html?em&#038;ex=1214107200&#038;en=43d6628c9d468977&#038;ei=5087%0A">oped</a> is also worth reading:</p>
<blockquote><p>It was almost inevitable that a combination of $4-a-gallon gas, public anxiety and politicians eager to win votes or repair legacies would produce political pandering on an epic scale. So it has, the latest instance being President Bush’s decision to ask Congress to end the federal ban on offshore oil and gas drilling along much of America’s continental shelf. This is worse than a dumb idea. It is cruelly misleading. It will make only a modest difference, at best, to prices at the pump, and even then the benefits will be years away. It greatly exaggerates America’s leverage over world oil prices. It is based on dubious statistics. It diverts the public from the tough decisions that need to be made about conservation.  There is no doubt that a lot of people have been discomfited and genuinely hurt by $4-a-gallon gas. But their suffering will not be relieved by drilling in restricted areas off the coasts of New Jersey or Virginia or California. The Energy Information Administration says that even if both coasts were opened, prices would not begin to drop until 2030. The only real beneficiaries will be the oil companies that are trying to lock up every last acre of public land before their friends in power — Mr. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney — exit the political stage. The whole scheme is based on a series of fictions that range from the egregious to the merely annoying. Democratic majority leader, Senator Harry Reid, noted the worst of these on Wednesday: That a country that consumes one-quarter of the world’s oil supply but owns only 3 percent of its reserves can drill its way out of any problem — whether it be high prices at the pump or dependence on oil exported by unstable countries in Persian Gulf. This fiction has been resisted by Barack Obama but foolishly embraced by John McCain, who seemed to be making some sense on energy questions until he jumped aboard the lift-the-ban bandwagon on Tuesday.  A lesser fiction, perpetrated by the oil companies and, to some extent, by misleading government figures, is that huge deposits of oil and gas on federal land have been closed off and industry has had one hand tied behind its back by environmentalists, Democrats and the offshore protections in place for 25 years.  The numbers suggest otherwise. Of the 36 billion barrels of oil believed to lie on federal land, mainly in the Rocky Mountain West and Alaska, almost two-thirds are accessible or will be after various land-use and environmental reviews. And of the 89 billion barrels of recoverable oil believed to lie offshore, the federal Mineral Management Service says fourth-fifths is open to industry, mostly in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaskan waters.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>Part of a staff report from reports from EIA and others mentioned. It occurs to me also, is there a difference between a ban and a moratorium?</p>
<p><a href="http://courtney.house.gov/UploadedFiles/Natural%20Resources%20energy%20report.pdf">In a Nutshell</a></p>
<blockquote><p>_ On the Outer Continental Shelf, 82% of federal natural gas and 79% of<br />federal oil is located in areas that are currently open for leasing.<br />_ Onshore, 72% of oil and 84% of natural gas resources are either fully<br />accessible under standard lease stipulations designed to protect lands<br />and wildlife, or will be accessible pending the completion of land-use<br />planning or environmental reviews.<br />_ Between 1999 and 2007, drilling permits for oil and gas development on<br />public lands increased more than 361%.<br />4<br />_ Since 2004, the Bureau of Land Management has issued 28,776 permits<br />to drill on public land; in that same time, only 18,954 wells were actually<br />drilled.<br />_ Oil and gas companies have stockpiled nearly 10,000 extra permits to<br />drill that they are not using to increase domestic production.<br />_ Onshore, of the 47.5 million acres of federal lands leased by oil and<br />gas companies, only about 13 million acres are actually producing oil<br />and gas.<br />_ Offshore, only 10.5 million of the 44 million leased acres are currently<br />producing oil or gas.<br />_ Combined, oil and gas companies hold leases to nearly 68 million acres<br />of federal land that are not producing oil and gas.<br />_ The 68 million acres of leased, inactive federal land could produce an<br />additional 4.8 million barrels of oil and 44.7 billion cubic feet of natural<br />gas each day.<br />_ That would nearly double total U.S. oil production, and increase natural<br />gas production by 75%.<br />_ 4.8 million barrels of oil equals more than six times the estimated peak<br />production from the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.<br />_ Development of and production from the 68 million acres currently<br />under lease but not in production would cut US imports of oil by one third.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>The magnitude of the numbers caught my eye</strong>. Does anyone have any knowledge of why the leases are not being developed? And do the numbers actually indicate what is implied, that these leases are not mainly useable so we need more? And where is the best drilling to be done, or is this a pissing contest? I have found no color coded maps that demonstrate this information.</p>

<blockquote><p>McCain sells himself as a pol who never sways with the wind, and whose willingness to be consistent in the face of pressure is proof of his character. Second, Republicans have spent the last four years or so making policy reversals the single most serious political crime in presidential politics. The dreaded “flip-flop” is, according to the GOP, the latest cardinal sin for someone seeking national office.</p></blockquote>
<p>But this comes at the end of a post where Steve documents all sorts of McCain flip-flops.  My favorites since we are on gasoline prices:</p>
<blockquote><p>McCain supported the drilling moratorium; now he’s against it.  McCain strongly opposes a windfall-tax on oil company profits. Three weeks earlier, he was perfectly comfortable with the idea.</p></blockquote>
