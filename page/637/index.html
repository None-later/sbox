                                <p><a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=YjZiNmU1MDUxZWIxMDk3ZGI1MTA4MjhjYTYyZTYyMzI=">Jerry Bowyer</a> is mocking that mythical character named recessionista again:</p>
<blockquote><p>Retail spending dropped very little last month, and it didn’t drop at all if you exclude autos. Meanwhile, consumer spending has consistently been up compared to the same time last year. The consumer will simply stop spending? Hasn’t happened.</p></blockquote>
<p>Translation – if consumption of nondurable goods goes up, real GDP cannot fall.  Never mind that consumption of durable goods fell last quarter.  Never mind that both residential and non-residential investment fell last quarter.  Never mind that some of what we consume is imported and that imports rose last quarter:</p>
<blockquote><p>Oh, and gas prices will never, ever, ever reduce retail spending since gas is a component of retail spending. Chain stores own gas stations. More money spent on gas is not a subtraction from overall consumer spending, it’s a transfer from one retail department to another.</p></blockquote>
<p>What a dumb statement!  Gasoline price increases are attributable to higher prices for oil and not higher retail margins.  And of course, Bowyer knows more about housing valuations than anyone:</p>
<blockquote><p>Basing big-picture assumptions on Case-Shiller is a faulty approach, too.</p></blockquote>
<p>I know the National Review prides itself on being about as ill informed on economics as it gets but isn’t Bowyer a total embarrassment even from them?</p>

                                <p>The industrial production report this morning was muddied by the auto parts strike.  Overall<br />manufacturing output fell 0.8%, but excluding auto and auto parts manufacturing output fell<br />0.4%.  Because the auto output is being distorted, and will generate a snapback of output when the strike ends, manufacturing output will not be giving clear signals for months.</p>
<p>To get around this I looked at manufacturing output excluding autos and auto parts.  The compound, smoothed  three month growth rate for this series is -2.0%. The three month growth rate of this series is a good, but not perfect recession indicator.  But if the US is not going into a recession this was be the largest false signal this series has generated.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.swamppolitics.com/news/politics/blog/2008/05/pelosi_challenges_mccain_sort.html">Matthew Hay Brown</a> gives me yet another reason to praise the Speaker of the House:</p>
<blockquote><p>The oblique references continue. Some believe President Bush was alluding to Barack Obama this morning when he criticized &#8220;some people&#8221; who &#8220;seem to believe we should negotiate with terrorists and radicals.&#8221; Now House Speaker Nancy Pelosi appears to be calling on John McCain to distance himself from the remarks Bush made before the Israeli Knesset. &#8220;You know, we have a protocol, sort of, a custom, informally, around here that we don&#8217;t criticize the president when he is on foreign soil,&#8221; Pelosi told reporters this morning. &#8220;One would think that that would apply to the president, that he would not criticize Americans when he is on foreign soil. &#8220;I think what the president did in that regard is beneath the dignity of the office of president and unworthy of our representation at that observance in Israel, and I would hope that any serious person would disassociate himself from the president&#8217;s remarks, who aspires to leaderhip in our country.&#8221; Asked if she was referring to McCain, the presumptive Republican nominee for president, the California Democrat repeated: &#8220;Any serious person. Any serious person.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>But I guess McCain isn’t <a href="http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalradar/2008/05/mccain-obama-na.html">listening</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Saying he takes Bush at his word that he wasn&#8217;t speaking directly of Obama, McCain said, &#8220;It does bring up an issue I will be discussing with the American people, and that is why does Barack Obama, Senator Obama want to sit down with a state sponsor of terrorism?&#8221; McCain said in the back of his campaign bus. &#8220;What does he want to talk about with, with [Iranian President Mahmoud] Ahmadinejad who said that Israel’s a stinking corpse, who said that he wants to wipe Israel off the map, who’s sending the most explosive devices into Iraq, killing Americans?&#8221; he said. &#8220;The point is that peace through strength is the way we achieve peace in the world. That’s the point. I will debate this issue with Senator Obama throughout this campaign.&#8221; Going farther, McCain continued to connect Obama with Ahmadinejad and highlight the Iranian leader&#8217;s incendiary comments about Israel. &#8220;I think Barack Obama needs to explain why he wants to sit down and talk with a man who is the head of a government that is a state sponsor of terror that is responsible for the killing of brave young Americans and wants to wipe Israel off the map and denies the Holocaust,&#8221; McCain said. &#8220;It is a serious error on the part of Senator Obama that shows naiveté and inexperience and lack of judgment to say that he wants to sit down across the table from an individual who leads a country that says and says that Israel is a stinking corpse, that is dedicated to the extinction of the state of Israel.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Peace through strength?  This is the slogan of the Likud Party and their policies have turned a bad situation for Israel into a worse one.  If McCain thinks we have peace between Israel and Palestine, he’s an idiot.  Of course, anyone who thinks our version of this – invading Iraq on March 19, 2003 – has worked well is also an idiot.  The Speaker may have given great advice but the person that it was apparently directed at appears to be as pathetic and clueless as President Bush.</p>

                                <p>The following is a reworked version of a piece originally put up immediately after the release of the 2006 Report in response to what seemed a very worrisome development. After a long series of years of continual improvement in Social Security long term outlook, suddenly progress stalled and actually reversed, the payroll gap went from 1.89% in 2004 to 1.92% in 2005 to 2.02% in 2006. Cause for concern? Absolutely. Cause for action? Well lets do the numbers.</p>
<p>Can we quantify the price of inaction on Social Security? My starting point is this table from EPI <a href="http://www.epi.org/content.cfm/issueguides_socialsecurity_changes">Changes in Trustees Projections Over Time</a>.<br />Note these are not EPI numbers, these are official numbers from the Annual Reports: &#8220;Source: Annual Reports of the Board of Trustees of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance and Disability Insurance Trust Funds, 1996-2004.&#8221; With the help of reader Paul in comments I can now present a series that is filled in and longer.<br />Report Date:::Payroll Gap:::Trust Fund Depletion<br />1996:::2.19%:::2029<br />1997:::2.23%:::2029<br />1998:::2.19%:::2032<br />1999:::2.07%:::2034<br />2000:::1.89%:::2037</p>
<p>My fundamental views about Social Security crystalized in the 1999-2000 period. Anyone looking at this number series and drawing the conclusion &#8216;Man we got to start moving on this crisis, and soon&#8217; is simply innumeric. Maybe something would need to be done down the road but as it stood Trust Fund depletion was retreating at a rate of two years per year, suggesting it might never come. Now the Bush years and a more complicated story.</p>
<p>2001:::1.86%:::2038 (Reader Paul supplied these, and the series after 2004-thanks Paul)<br />2002:::1.87%:::2041<br />2003:::1.92%:::2042<br />2004:::1.89%:::2042</p>
<p>This is where President Bush entered the battle. Clearly progress was being made, Depletion was still being pushed out in date and this even true in 2004 when taken by month, I think there was about a nine month improvement over the course of the year. This progress didn&#8217;t show up as much on the payroll gap side, but properly understood this is all the more cause for Inactivity. Doing Nothing in Bush&#8217;s first term was the effective equivalent of a tax cut averaging 1.89% in each year, and all from the first dollar and not the last, for wage workers the Cost of Inactivity was money left in their pockets. Absent a better deal than what they were being offered they really had no reason to move. As it turns out Bush&#8217;s implied preference, the Posen Plan did not in fact offer that deal, a point that was hammered home by Lee A. Arnold in a clever animation <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tts2uTWt6e8">Econolanguage: Social Security</a> now available on YouTube.</p>
<p>2005:::1.92%:::2041<br />2006:::2.02%:::2040 (this is what percipitated the early version of this post, that was not pleasant news)<br />2007:::1.95%:::2041<br />2008:::1.70%:::2041</p>
<p>Now let the fun begin. My oh my plenty of numeric fun to be added. Below the fold.</p>
<p>Lets take this as if it were a betting game, me betting my current dollar against some lost dollars going forward. Now clearly in any year that shows an absolute improvement in either magnitude of the gap and/or Depletion moving out in time is a winning bet for Nothing. As are a series of years with that same result. For example we could take it by term:<br />1996:::2.19%<br />2000:::1.89%<br />2004:::1.89%<br />2008:::1.7%<br />Winner, winner, chicken dinner!! Each term left four years of taxes not taken in peoples wallets and ended up with a cost per year going forward that was equal or less that the starting point of the term. The people who insist that &#8216;There is no time to wait&#8217; &#8216;Sooner is better than latter&#8217; and &#8216;If we delay, if will only cost more in the end&#8217; in fact have no numeric evidence to back any of that up. Now certainly it is possible for this trend to reverse, in fact the outlook got considerably bleaker in the mid-ninties, things looked a lot better in 1993 then they did subsequently in 1997, which in the event showed &#8216;crisis&#8217; at its peak. But that is just where the game gets interesting.</p>
<p>Lets say the 2009 Report shows a jump back to 1.95%. Does this make Nothing a losing bet, should we act this year after all? Not necessarily, you have to calculate the Cost of Inactivity for each individual. And moreover decide over what period you want to measure that. Moreover the effects are not necessarily reciprocal, at least over the short run. If the payroll gap actually goes up due to worse than projected current year results, that simply suggests the previous &#8216;fix&#8217; would not in fact have fixed the entire gap, whereas when the gap moves down that current year dollar is real as real. But for the sake of argument lets say you could show that the entire uptick was due to failure to collect that one current year payroll dollar. How many years would it take to have that become a financial negative for any given individual. Well if you look at a situation where you have a level real wage when measured in constant dollars the calculation is pretty simple:</p>
<p>Amount of increase multiplied by years to retirement minus previous year payroll gap. For me in 2005 that worked out to:<br />.03 x 17 = .51 &#8211; 1.89% = -1.38%. That is over my working life Nothing in 2005 still worked out as a tax cut, just a little less than I might have hoped for. How about 2006?:<br />.10 x 16 =1.6% &#8211; 1.92% = -.32% Well kind of nets out as a skinny tax cut but one that works to one degree or another for everyone within 20 years of retirement. And of course the improvement from 2.02% to 1.95% meant Nothing was an absolute win short term and equally medium term. Take any year you like and multiply its payroll gap against the number of years between then and now. That is your cummulative tax cut equivalent for that span. Then use a variation of the equation to calculate how long it would have to be before that became a losing bet. The figure rapidly hits the hundreds of years.</p>
<p>Lets turn the bet on its head and look forward. What level of increase in payroll gap would actually make Nothing a losing bet? The calculation is a little more simple: Current year payroll gap divided by years to retirement or in my case 1.7% divided by 15 or .11%. Could the gap increase by that much? Well maybe, the jump in 2006 was close to that but even then I break even. Now if I was 22 and starting my first job I might take a little different attitude. I didn&#8217;t see any benefit from the dollars not taxed. On the other hand if I was 28 and still struggling to pay off my student loans that roughly 2% a year not taken out of my paycheck probably looks pretty good.</p>
<p>From my perspective any year where the payroll gap is less than the 2.23% of 1997 is a call for Nothing as a plan. Certainly we want to take a hard look if the numbers start trending upwards year over year, but as long as the number is fluctuating around the 2% level there is really nothing to worry about. Once you calculate the Cost of Inactivity against the current utility of that payroll dollar. After all doing nothing in 2008 will leave the median household with about $1000 or close to the amount of the current stimulus check. &#8216;Fixing&#8217; Social Security would then be the fiscal equivalent of taking away the punchbowl right as the party was scheduled to start. Nothing smart about that.</p>

                                <p>The report in yahoo news presents an odd twist in relation to government regulation and testing.  For me it brings to focus the less than idealogical intent of our current administration.</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080509/ap_on_go_ca_st_pe/mad_cow">The Bush administration</a> on Friday urged a federal appeals court to stop meatpackers from testing all their animals for mad cow disease, but a skeptical judge questioned whether the government has that authority. </p>
<p>The government seeks to reverse a lower court ruling that allowed Kansas-based Creekstone Farms Premium Beef to conduct more comprehensive testing to satisfy demand from overseas customers in Japan and elsewhere.</p>
<p>Less than 1 percent of slaughtered cows are currently tested for the disease under Agriculture Department guidelines. The agency argues that more widespread testing does not guarantee food safety and could result in a false positive that scares consumers.</p>
<p>&#8220;They want to create false assurances,&#8221; Justice Department attorney Eric Flesig-Greene told a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.</p>
<p>But Creekstone attorney Russell Frye contended the Agriculture Department&#8217;s regulations covering the treatment of domestic animals contain no prohibition against an individual company testing for mad cow disease, since the test is conducted only after a cow is slaughtered. He said the agency has no authority to prevent companies from using the test to reassure customers.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the government telling the consumers, `You&#8217;re not entitled to this information,'&#8221; Frye said.</p>
<p>Chief Judge David B. Sentelle seemed to agree with Creekstone&#8217;s contention that the additional testing would not interfere with agency regulations governing the treatment of animals.</p>
<p>&#8220;All they want to do is create information,&#8221; Sentelle said, noting that it&#8217;s up to consumers to decide how to interpret the information.</p>
<p>Larger meatpackers have opposed Creekstone&#8217;s push to allow wider testing out of fear that consumer pressure would force them to begin testing all animals too. Increased testing would raise the price of meat by a few cents per pound.</p>
<p>Mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy, can be fatal to humans who eat tainted beef. Three cases of mad cow disease have been discovered in the U.S. since 2003.</p>
<p>The district court&#8217;s ruling last year in favor of Creekstone was supposed to take effect June 1, 2007, but the Agriculture Department&#8217;s appeal has delayed the testing so far.</p></blockquote>
<p>The title is a bit much, but was irresistible.</p>

                                <p>History:  How the US Grew the Military Industrial Complex.</p>
<p>The size of the US national security (war) machine is not related to threats to the nation nor any reasonable or efficient response to those wildly inflated threats.  Threats are overstated and the solution to the fake insecurity is always the most expensive and profitable, neither effective nor efficient.  Those are engineering specification terms never used to describe warfare state value.</p>
<p>Good to whittle beaks for profits and keeping the trough filled.</p>
<p>The US DoD outsourced weapons making after WW II.  During WW II for profit industries: Chryser, General Motors, Kaiser Aluminum, et al, mobilized for the war effort made military weapons work and mass produced very good quality.  Some may conclude that the mobilized private sector took defense firms&#8217; and arsenals&#8217; products to greater heights of quality and efficiency.</p>
<p>After the war the congress, National Security Act of 1947, decided to use private companies for arming a vaguely defined continuous mobilization.  A largely unneeded and overly profitable arms establishment grew from the politics and greed.</p>
<p>Instead of being like the commercial companies which produced the weapons that won World War II, these nationall security industries quickly became for profit arsenals not as good as pre war public arsenals but more expensive with profits and enough money to buy congress.  In 1961 Eisenhower called it the military industrial complex.</p>
<p>The motive for perpetual mobilization and long war is profit.  In the 1940&#8217;s the Air Force became the first and subsequently main customer of RandD Inc.  We know it as RAND.  This think tank is responsible for such concepts as Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD) and other plans to wage nuclear armageddon.  Some think their analyses created the bloated military industrial complex.  They advocated arming ourselves to the teeth while the Soviets were collapsing economically.</p>
<p>Other think tanks arose in RAND&#8217;s image all funded by military industrial complex war profits and all selling the freightfully insecure alternatives of not buying all the unneeded super weapons.</p>
<p>Why does the US have for profit arsenals which are not effective?  Short answer is the stuff is as related to security as wooden beaks strapped to the general&#8217;s faces.</p>
<p>The think tanks sold the most expensive, unneeded solution and no one asked if any of it is &#8220;worth the taxpayers&#8217; dough&#8221; because there was a lot of money to be made.  The useless war machine took funding from better uses that the poor and meek needed.</p>
<p>Then the &#8220;supporters&#8221; equate  patriotism with militarism, masked by propaganda and war profits funded media blitzes.</p>
<p>Think tanks falsely defining the &#8220;strategy and structure&#8221; of the warfare state estabishment is one way to keep the trough filled with gold.  Building on the services&#8217; &#8220;strategic investment objectives&#8221; is another.</p>
<p>None of it is worth the taxpayers&#8217; scarce money.  But it is good for the military industrial complex, the trough.</p>
<p>Next week I will discuss how the think tanks sell &#8220;continuous mobilization&#8221; to keep them all whittlin beaks.<br />&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-<br />Another piece by ilsm</p>

The US military has a huge appetite for oil and products. We have not quantified this on the blog. The Bush Administration I suppose has not asked for a volume discount for oil or services, but it made me curious&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Every day, the average G.I. in Iraq uses approximately <a title="http://www.statesman.com/news/content/news/stories/world/04/03/0403gaswar.html" href="http://www.statesman.com/news/content/news/stories/world/04/03/0403gaswar.html">27 gallons</a> of petroleum-based fuels. With some 160,000 American troops in Iraq, that amounts to 4.37 million gallons in daily oil usage, including gasoline for vans and light vehicles, diesel for trucks and armored vehicles, and aviation fuel for helicopters, drones, and fixed-wing aircraft. With U.S. forces paying, as of late April, an average of $3.23 per gallon for these fuels, the Pentagon is already spending approximately $14 million per day on oil ($98 million per week, $5.1 billion per year) to stay in Iraq. Meanwhile, our Iraqi allies, who are expected to receive a <a title="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB120950196830853907.html?mod=" href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB120950196830853907.html?mod=googlenews_wsj">windfall</a> of $70 billion this year from the rising price of their oil exports, charge their citizens $1.36 per gallon for gasoline.<br />When questioned about why Iraqis are paying almost a third less for oil than American forces in their country, senior Iraqi government officials scoff at any suggestion of impropriety. “America has hardly even begun to repay its debt to Iraq,” said <a title="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/chi-oil-money_slymay01,0,7290713.story" href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/chi-oil-money_slymay01,0,7290713.story">Abdul Basit</a>, the head of Iraq’s Supreme Board of Audit, an independent body that oversees Iraqi governmental expenditures. “This is an immoral request because we didn’t ask them to come to Iraq, and before they came in 2003 we didn’t have all these needs.”<br />Needless to say, this is not exactly the way grateful clients are supposed to address superpower patrons. “It’s totally unacceptable to me that we are spending tens of billions of dollars on rebuilding Iraq while they are putting tens of billions of dollars in banks around the world from oil revenues,” said Senator <a title="http://www.statesman.com/news/content/news/stories/world/04/03/0403gaswar.html" href="http://www.statesman.com/news/content/news/stories/world/04/03/0403gaswar.html">Carl Levin</a> (D-Michigan), chairman of the Armed Services Committee. “It doesn’t compute as far as I’m concerned.”<br />Certainly, however, our allies in the region, especially the Sunni kingdoms of Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) that presumably look to Washington to stabilize Iraq and curb the growing power of Shiite Iran, are willing to help the Pentagon out by supplying U.S. troops with free or deeply-discounted petroleum. No such luck. Except for some partially subsidized oil supplied by Kuwait, all oil-producing U.S. allies in the region charge us the <a title="http://www.statesman.com/news/content/news/stories/world/04/03/0403gaswar.html" href="http://www.statesman.com/news/content/news/stories/world/04/03/0403gaswar.html">market rate</a> for petroleum.</p>
<p>Update:  See <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2008/05/wolf-becker-and-posner-on-oil-with.html">Naked Capitalism on Wolf Becker and Posner on oil&#8221;</a></p>
<p>Take that as a striking reflection of how little credence even countries whose ruling elites have traditionally looked to the U.S. for protection now attach to our supposed superpower status.<br />Think of this as a strikingly clear-eyed assessment of American power. As far as they’re concerned, we’re now just another of those hopeless oil addicts driving a monster gas-guzzler up to the pump — and they’re perfectly happy to collect our cash which they can then use to cherry-pick our prime assets. So expect no summer tax holidays for the Pentagon, not in the Middle East, anyway.<br />Worse yet, the U.S. military will need even more oil for the future wars on which the Pentagon is now doing the planning. In this way, the U.S. experience in Iraq has especially worrisome <a title="http://www.tomdispatch.com/post/174810/" href="http://www.tomdispatch.com/post/174810/">implications</a>. Under the military “transformation” initiated by Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld in 2001, the future U.S. war machine will rely less on “boots on the ground” and ever more on technology. But technology entails an ever-greater requirement for oil, as the newer weapons sought by Rumsfeld (and now Secretary of Defense Robert Gates) all consume many times more fuel than those they will replace. To put this in perspective: The average G.I in Iraq now uses about seven times as much oil per day as G.I.s did in the first Gulf War less than two decades ago. And every sign indicates that the same ratio of increase will apply to coming conflicts; that the daily cost of fighting will skyrocket; and that the Pentagon’s capacity to shoulder multiple foreign military burdens will unravel. Thus are superpowers undone.</p></blockquote>
<p>  Is the general thrust of the argument reasonable as the price of oil rapidly increases?  How does a military totally dependent on access to oil deal with prices that are its lifeblood?  What are the obligations in the ME, and does this square with our rhetoric??</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p><a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR07/trTOC.html">The Trustees Report intermediate projection for Medicare</a> costs in  <br />2085 is about 11% of payroll.</p>
<p>This is on a bigger payroll than Social Security because currently  <br />the Medicare tax is not capped. (If I were a rich person and looking  <br />at that uncapped Medicare tax, I&#8217;d be lobbying for a cap and a  <br />slightly larger tax tax rate up to the cap.)</p>
<p>By 2085 or so the real income of workers is projected, at 1.1% growth  <br />per year, to be about 2 and a quarter times current income.</p>
<p>So, an average worker would be making about 90 thousand per year.</p>
<p>Out of that he would pay 11% or about 10 thousand per year for Medicare.</p>
<p>Sounds like a lot and is a lot.  But note that his real income has  <br />increased about 50,000 dollars a year from what it is today.</p>
<p>And of that he would be paying 10,000 to cover his old age medical  <br />costs, which are expected to be&#8230; one would calculate about 400,000  <br />dollars.  Not that every worker would have such high expenses, but  <br />that maybe one in ten workers would have 4 million dollars worth of  <br />expenses, perhaps.  And presumably you would have no way to know if  <br />you would be the one.</p>
<p>But assuming everything worked out as predicted, you would still be  <br />about 40,000 dollars better off each year PLUS have enough money to  <br />pay for enormous medical costs that would presumably keep you  <br />healthier and give you a longer life after you retired. And there is  <br />no way you can avoid the medical costs. Either Medicare or private  <br />insurance will cost essentially the same.</p>
<p>This is, of course, in addition to the Social Security costs that  <br />would rise a much smaller amount just to pay for groceries over that  <br />longer life expectancy.</p>
<p>So before you cut your head off and scream that Medicare is going to  <br />bankrupt the nation and burden our youth, please look at least at the  <br />actual costs we are talking about.</p>
<p>About a 5% increase in soc sec for the worker&#8230;  or a total Soc Sec  <br />and HI cost of 30% of payroll, of which the worker would pay half&#8230;  <br />so 15% or about 13,500, leaving about 76000 for personal expenses,  <br />investments and other taxes&#8230;  or about 35 thousand more than you  <br />have today.  Your boss would pay another 13,500&#8230;  but that is money  <br />you would never see anyway and comes out of his share of the joint  <br />value added from the worker-boss partnership.  He&#8217;s not getting hurt.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a lot of money, and wise people would work to cut the costs.   <br />But it is not crippling and may be a better way to enjoy our higher  <br />standard of living, by living longer and in better health, than by  <br />buying a new Lexus and taking a trip to Las Vegas every year.</p>
<p>And remember, this is you paying for yourself. Our &#8220;youth&#8221; will pay  <br />for their own benefits.  Try not to be confused by pay as you go.  <br />That is the way nature works.<br />&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-<br />This one by coberly</p>

<blockquote><p>When it comes to trade, Western farming subsidies undercut agricultural production in fertile areas of Africa, India’s commerce minister, Kamal Nath, said in a telephone interview, repeating the point that Americans waste more food than people in many other countries.</p></blockquote>
<p>I was rather surprised at the statistics that Americans consume 3770 calories per person per day.  And we’re surprised that so many of us are fat?  <a href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/beat_the_press_archive?month=05&#038;year=2008&#038;base_name=food_prices_are_too_low">Dean Baker</a> was surprised at something else:</p>
<blockquote><p>Of course the problem is that food prices are too high, causing people to go hungry. The truth is that the U.S. and European subsidies that cause the Post, the NYT, the World Bank and many NGOs to get apoplectic have the effect of lowering world food prices. That means that fewer people go hungry than would be the case without these subsidies.  This isn&#8217;t rocket science, it&#8217;s almost definitional. The U.S. and European effectively pay their farmers to keep farming, thereby producing more food than otherwise would be produced. This may have negative consequences for farmers elsewhere in the world, but it does mean that supply is greater and prices are lower than they would be in the absence of the subsidies.</p></blockquote>
<p>If we are talking the world supply of food, then Dean is correct.  Kamal Nath, however, seems to be talking about the supply of food coming from Africa which is likely being reduced by the increased competition from the West.  If we had perfectly free trade of food, the net impact of these subsidies on food prices in India would be to lower prices as Dean suggest.  But the current world market is riddled with all sorts of government interference in the trade of food.</p>
