<blockquote><p>Hilariously, the result of Ryan&#8217;s Dave-like search through the budget &#8212; and the only example of a putative budget savings mentioned anywhere in the piece &#8212; is his claim to have discovered a savings in the student loan program. In fact, this example is exactly the opposite of what Ryan (and the story) proclaim.</p>
<p>[skipped part about how the old program gave billions a year to banks for no discernable reason]</p></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>Ryan is a fervent ally of the college lending industry. In 2007, he was one of only 71 Republicans to vote against the College Student Relief Act, which would have cut the interest rate on many student loans, including the FFEL program, in half. Inside Higher Ed notedthat the bill would cut “deeply and directly into lenders&#8217; profits.” The bill passed the House 356-71, but stalled in the Senate.</p>
<p>So, that&#8217;s the one idea this fresh-faced reformer comes up with the balance the budget: shovel billions of dollars in extra subsidies to an inefficient and wildly corrupt industry whose water he has faithfully carried. And this isn&#8217;t an exception &#8211;Ryan&#8217;s record is one of wild fiscal profligacy. I realize he&#8217;s cute and energetic and exudes an aw-shucks Midwestern earnestness, but the reality bears absolutely no relation to the image.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ouch.  Given the rules of the poliitical game that&#8217;s got to leave no mark.</p>
<p>* This is a metaphor and has nothing to do with assaulting people with baseball bats.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Last night and today I watched on <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/">Al Jazeera</a> (<a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/watch_now/2007829161423657345.html">streaming</a>) what sure looks like a Egyptian revolution.  At the moment Hosni Mubarak is still President, however, he is not in control.  The apparent turning point occured when he sent the army to suppress demonstrations after the vastly outnumbered security police didn&#8217;t manage.  This is a throw of the dice and he knew it.  I read in the New York Times</p>
<blockquote><p>“This is the revolution of all the people,” declared the side of a second tank in downtown Cairo. Egyptian men all serve in the army, giving it a very different relationship to the people from that of the police.</p></blockquote>
<p>An army of drafties can&#8217;t be trusted to side with a dictator against a crowd of demonstrators.  The security police are volunteers who understand the choice they are making, are thoroughly disciplined and fairly well paid.  Actually a few of them took off their badges and joined the demonstration, but most held their lines and fired tear gas and rubber bullets until they withdrew last night.</p>
<p>In Italy, people have only fairly recently been confident that there won&#8217;t be a military coup.  The fact that attempted dictators can&#8217;t rely on drafties was key to the decision to maintain universal military service (to protect Italy from what ? Slovenia ?) until recently.  </p>
<p>So why did Mubarak draft his subjects and give them guns and tanks ?  A small well paid professional army would have been more reliable and certainly powerful enough to terrify civilians armed with stones and the occasional molotof cocktail.  Why did he feel the need to have a huge army ?  There is no way the Egyptian army could defeat Israel (been there tried that).  There is no way any other conceivable adversary could last a week against the Egyptian army or even a much smaller army.</p>
<p>Why ?  My guess is that the generals want to command a huge army for reasons of ego and they have always had the power to overthrow Mubarak.  On the other hand the people only become dangerous to him when they are united.</p>

<p><a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2011/01/aba-tax-section-report-on-the-economic-substance-doctrine.html">ABA Tax Section Report on the Economic Substance Doctrine</a><br />crossposted with Ataxingmatter
<p>The ABA Tax Section put together a large working group to write a report on the newly codified economic substance provision&#8211;<a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/files/aba-economic-substance.-comments-on-notice-2010-62.pdf">Download ABA Economic Substance. Comments on Notice 2010-62</a>. </p>
<p>The working group was led by several people, including Michael Desmond, who just happened to be at Treasury during the Bush Administration.  (There are lots of people in private practice now, writing reports on government decisions, who were in government under Bush just a while ago.  Is that a good thing?  I suppose it has its pluses and minuses.  On the plus side, it ensures that there are always those in practice who understand how government works and where important decisions can get hung up or expedited.  ON the minus side, the very decisions that were put in place during a person&#8217;s tenure in government may be susceptible to persuasive lobbying (using that insider perspective) from those who worked on the provision in government and now comment on it on the outside.) </p>
<p> <a name="more"></a>
<p>The practitioner community is generally concerned that the codification of the economic substance doctrine will mean that it will &#8220;chill&#8221; regular business transactions because of the uncertainty regarding its exact application.  So the report asks for clarification&#8211;just what are the transactions that are susceptible to the application of economic substance, what is a substantial purpose, what does it mean to have a potential for profit, how do we know when state tax provisions are related to federal tax provisions, and what, in fact, does &#8220;economic substance doctrine&#8221; mean.</p>
<p>While the desire for absolute clarity is understandable, I am not sure that it is a desire that the Treasury should attempt to satisfy.  One of the benefits of judicial doctrines, compared to very specific statutory anti-abuse provisions, is their flexibility.  Courts, in the context of particular cases, review the circumstances of a transaction and conclude that it lacks economic substance.  The doctrine has developed as part of the federal common law of tax, and it has gone through periods of being particularly useful in curbing super-aggressive tax avoidance shelters.</p>
<p>For people like me who were worried that codification of the doctrine could lead to its demise by narrowing its scope and defining away its power to adapt to unforeseen abusive pattersn (and to create enough uncertainty among tax practitioners to discourage the most aggressive tax return gambits), the ABA&#8217;s demand for &#8220;clarification&#8221; is therefore worrisome.  If we take Congress at its word, it expected the courts to continue applying the doctrine in the circumstances in which they applied the doctrine before codification.  Codification solves the problem of different tests for economic substance applied in different jurisdictions by settling on one test, but it leaves it to the courts&#8217; careful case-by-case analysis to add more meat to the bones of the test.  This is as it should be.</p>
<p>Practitioners would nonetheless like an &#8220;angel&#8221; list of transactions to which the economic substance doctrine can&#8217;t apply.  Treasury has wisely refused, since the power of the doctrine is in looking beyond form to substance and recognizing that abusive transactions (shelters) are highly innovational within the confines of existing statutory provisions.  The creation of an angel list would be an invitation for creative tax genuises to manipulate code sections to create an abusive transaction out of the angel one.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s be honest.  Many practitioners would also like to see the significant test for business purpose narrowed in scope.  Here too I disagree.  it is important for transactions that are honored in their form for tax purposes to have a significant purpose that is germane to the business and not conjured up solely to achieve favorable tax results. </p>
<p>While some guidance would be helpful, Treasury should be careful not to put the pliable economic substance doctrine into a straitjacket that limits its ability to police aggressive transactions.</p>

I&#8217;d like to see what GDI is telling us about the Y/Y recovery, since it&#8217;s a better predictor of turning points, according to<a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/research/staff/nalewaikjeremyj.htm"> FRB economist Jeremy J.

(<em>Click to enlarge.</em>)The series is deflated using the GDP deflator, since the BEA only releases the nominal numbers. All references to GDP and GDI below refer to the real series.</p>
<p>Observations I note:</p>
<p>1. The Y/Y growth rate of GDI surpassed that of GDP in Q2 2010, continuing into Q3 2010. In Q3 2010, GDI grew at a 3.6% annual clip, while GDP marked a lesser 3.2% rate. Don&#8217;t know what this means, exactly; but it could imply that the economy is expanding more rapidly than the <a href="http://www.bea.gov/newsreleases/national/gdp/gdpnewsrelease.htm">GDP measure would suggest</a>.</p>
<p>(more after the jump)<a name="more"></a></p>
<p>2. The Q3 2010 corporate profit contribution to annual income growth, 2.2%, is overwhelming that from wages and salary accruals (labor income), 0.73%. This oversized contribution is rather remarkable, given that domestic corporate profits are just 8% of GDI, while that of wages and salaries is 55%. This will probably even out, though, as history shows a more balanced contribution between profits and wages.</p>
<p>3. The chart illustrates the &#8216;stickiness&#8217; of labor income. The corporate profit contribution turned negative in Q4 2006, while that of wages and accruals turned negative in Q3 2008. That&#8217;s a near 2-yr lag from profits to wages. Wages are recovering now; but there will be further quarters of weak wage growth relative to profits, as <a href="http://www.calculatedriskblog.com/2011/01/weekly-initial-unemployment-claims_27.html">claims remain</a> elevated <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/12/31/unemployment-claims-and-employment-growth/">above the 350k mark</a>.</p>
<p>4. The contribution to GDI growth from net interest payments is in negative territory. Low rates are dragging this component.</p>
<p>5. Supplements to wages and salaries &#8211; government transfer payments like unemployment insurance, for example &#8211; contributed 0.3% to annual GDI growth in Q3 2010. Interesting thing about this, is that the average contribution spanning the 2000-2004 period, 0.5%, outweighs that during the 2005-2010 period, 0.14%. I say interesting because the labor decline was far deeper in this cycle compared to the previous cycle. (See <a href="http://cr4re.com/charts/charts.html#category=Employment&#038;chart=EmploymentRecessionsNov.jpg">Calculated Risk chart </a>from 12.3.2010)</p>
<p>Overall, the GDI report implies that the economy may be improving more quickly than the GDP report suggests. There&#8217;s plenty of room for improvement in this picture, however, as the labor wages remain stuck in the mud with corporate profits strong.</p>
<p>Tomorrow we&#8217;ll see the Q4 2010 GDP report &#8211; consensus forecast is for 3.5% Q/Q SAAR.</p>

                                <p>Run75441 sends a note and this post<i>: <a target="_blank" href="http://blog-thebell.blogspot.com/2011/01/children-of-tragedy.html">The Bell</a></i> presents a good read at his blog giving a non-partisan perspective of the tragedy in Tucson AZ and how it may affect our future outlook:</p>
<p>Children of Tragedy    <br />Which Face Will Be Our Face?    <br />Pundits and politicians from both sides of the ideological divide were quick with partisan reactions to the tragic shooting last Saturday in Tucson Arizona. A man shot and critically wounded U.S. Representative Gabrielle Giffords and killed U.S. District Judge John Roll, along with five other people, during an informal town hall meeting by the Congresswoman.   </p>
<p>Many liberals condemned right-wing rhetoric for inspiring the attack. Paul Krugman of the <i>New York Times</i> was among the most outspoken. “There isn’t any place [in a democracy] for eliminationist rhetoric, for suggestions that those on the other side of a debate must be removed from that debate by whatever means necessary . . . Where’s that toxic rhetoric coming from? Let’s not make a false pretense of balance – it’s coming, overwhelmingly, from the right.”<br /><a name="more"></a></p>

<p>   <br />For their part, conservatives furiously denied any political connections or motivations for the shooting. The <i>Wall Street Journal</i> editorial board maintained, “On all available evidence, [the shooter] is a mentally disturbed man who targeted Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords and anyone near her in Tucson on Saturday because she was prominent and they were tragically accessible . . . Whatever confused political motives he expressed seem merely to be part of the maelstrom of his mental sickness.”    </p>
<p>Conservatives pushed back at liberals, insisting the latter were disgusting in using a tragedy to promote their agenda. “I understand the desperation that Democrats must feel after taking a historic beating in the midterm elections . . . [but they] demonstrate precious little actual concern for America&#8217;s political well-being when they seize on any pretext, however flimsy, to call their political opponents accomplices to murder,” wrote University of Tennessee Law Professor Glenn Reynolds in a <i>Journal</i> op-ed piece.   </p>
<p>The truth lies somewhere between these two biased viewpoints, as it so often does. Considerable examples of his writings gleamed from the Internet as well as evidence seized from the shooter’s PC and home suggests that Jared Loughner was a deeply disturbed young man. Especially since 2005, he had been concerning family, friends, and classmates with his erratic and sometime violent statements and behavior.    </p>
<p>One former fellow student at Pima Community College described Loughner as “an emotional cripple or an emotional child . . . He lacked compassion, he lacked understanding and he lacked an ability to connect.” Another student said Loughner “didn&#8217;t have social intelligence” despite abundant academic intelligence.    </p>
<p>A former high school friend posted on Twitter that the Loughner she knew was “left wing, quite liberal and oddly obsessed with the 2012 prophecy.” She noted that alcohol and drugs had left him ruined and ostracized.    <br />Yet much of what Loughner posted and talked about in recent years had more of a right-wing flavor, even if he did not intend it as such. In particular, he was passionately distrustful of big government. He seemed to be a sucker for conspiracy theories and wild accusations. He labeled his planned attack on Giffords as an “assassination.”    </p>
<p>So while it is disingenuous to suggest that Loughner’s motivations were primarily political, it is equally insincere to assert that he was completely unaware of or insulated from some of the sentiments and insinuations raised in current political debate. The anti-government rhetoric that may have helped reinforce Loughner’s twisted beliefs rests mostly with conservatives. This does not mean they intended to incite violence or even that it necessarily incited violence in Loughner.    </p>
<p>Nonetheless, Loughner demonstrates to all of us the tragic consequences when passion overrides reason. He serves as a caution to politicians and pundits alike about the importance of restraint and non-inflammatory rhetoric in public discourse.    </p>
<p>Ross Douthat of the <i>New York Times</i> sums it up best. “When our politicians and media loudmouths act like fools and zealots, they should be held responsible for being fools and zealots. They shouldn’t be held responsible for the darkness that always waits to swallow up the unstable and the lost.” However, E.J. Dionne of the <i>Washington Post</i> contributes an important counterpoint. “We must now insist with more force than ever that threats of violence no less than violence itself are antithetical to democracy.”    </p>
<p>Some politicians expressed it well too. “An attack on one who serves is an attack on all who serve,” said House Speaker John Boehner. But my favorite comes from Republican Representative Trent Franks of Arizona. On NBC’s <i>Meet the Press</i>, he declared this tragedy “an attack not only on freedom and the country itself; it’s an attack on humanity.”    </p>
<p>Among the things that obsessed Loughner was language and grammar. A frequent theme in his writings and rants is the question, “What is government if words have no meaning?” It is a good question, even if he clearly meant it rhetorically. Loughner was sure that government and just about everything else was meaningless. He may well have regarded his violence as just one more casual act in a random existence.    </p>
<p>Our Constitution and the other laws of our land are words on paper. They would be nothing more than that but possess meaning because they are living words, lived each day by ordinary and extraordinary Americans. Their devotion gives our government its legitimacy to impose rules and defend rights.    <br />I think of Giffords, a government official who placed herself in harm’s way because she believed in the importance of connecting with the people she represented. I think of Roll, killed on his way home from church because he wanted to stop and shake the hand of a fellow public servant and friend.    <br />I think of Dorwin Stoddard, who died by throwing himself between his wife and a bullet. A pastor at Mountain Avenue Church of Christ, he died demonstrating the Christian ideal that no person can show greater love than by willingly laying down their life for another.    </p>
<p>I think of the courageous men and women in the crowd who wrestled Loughner to the ground and grabbed his ammunition as he paused to reload. I think of equally courageous men and women in that same crowd who frantically sought to aid and comfort the dying and wounded.    <br />I think of Christina Green, the nine year old girl killed when she attended a political event. Just elected to her elementary school’s student council, she wanted to see democracy in action. Born on the day of the September 11 attacks, she considered herself a symbol of hope for our nation.    </p>
<p>I think of John Green, Christina’s father, who put aside a parent’s crushing grief long enough to utter an almost unbelievably brave assertion of citizenship. Interviewed on NBC’s <i>Today Show</i>, he avowed, “In a free society, we are going to be subjected to people like [Loughner]. I prefer this to the alternative.”    </p>
<p>Those who believe words are more real, in some arcane way, than our actual lives are insane. Those who use words to stir up fear and manipulate the lives of others are the problem and the threat. Those who attempt to live the words we profess to hold as our ideals are the hope and the heroes.    </p>
<p>The faces of Jared Loughner and Christina Green stare out at us. The first is an emotional child, stunted by his own demons and self-hatred. The second is a bright promise that will now never realize her potential. Both faces have a kind of innocence – one twisted, the other pure. They are the children of this tragedy.    </p>
<p>The challenge for the rest of us lies in choosing which one will be the face of our democracy as we seek to grow beyond this moment. The words we choose to use and the meaning we choose to honor will directly influence what our government is in the future. </p>

<p>She was in her early- to mid-50s, <a href="http://publichealth.drexel.edu/Departments/Health_Management_Policy/Faculty_and_Staff/Alison_Snow_Jones_PhD/773/">estimating by her c.v.</a>.</p>
<p>Go <a href="http://www.maxineudall.com/">read what you missed</a>, and what we will all miss going forward.  <strong>UPDATE</strong>: For instance, <a href="http://www.maxineudall.com/2011/01/economics-art-or-science.html">this post</a>, which is both (1) the only valuable thing ever to be sourced to treating a David Brooks column as if it were rational and (2) a much more generous reflection on economics that the data currently appears to warrant (until you realise the math/model that will be required to reach the goal).</p>

<p><strong>Tax Rates v. Real GDP Growth Rates, a Scatter Plot</strong>Cross posted at the <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=307">Presimetrics blog</a>.</p>
<p>This post was submitted by <strong>Kaleberg</strong>.  </p>
<p>In this post, I will look at the relationship between top marginal income tax rates and real GDP growth using  a scatter plot.  </p>
<p>I am inordinately fond of scatter plots. The nice thing about a scatter plot is that you can present a lot of data in a fairly small space, so rather than just comparing tax rates at time period t against real GDP growth rates from period t to t+1, I can also show real GDP growth rates from period t to t+2, from t to t+3, and from t to t+4.  (I.e., the scatter plot shows tax rates at any given time, and the growth rates over one year, two years, three years, and four years.)  </p>
<p>The vertical axis is the GDP growth rate, the geometric average for multiple years. The horizontal average is the top marginal tax rate. The one year comparison is shown in dark blue, and each subsequent year is shown with a paler color and a smaller marker.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TT_5n4rT91I/AAAAAAAAAg8/UQj16asciMQ/s1600/scatter.bmp"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TT_5n4rT91I/AAAAAAAAAg8/UQj16asciMQ/s400/scatter.bmp" border="0" alt=""></a>Figure 1</p>
<p>Data is for the period from 1929 to 2009 (i.e., all the years available from the BEA.)<br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Lower top marginal tax rates seem to limit economic growth with a rate of about 60% seeming to divide the restricted growth phase from the unrestricted growth phase. There might be a little falloff when the tax rate passes 90%, or there might not.  There are lackluster growth rates associated with higher and lower top marginal tax rates. Mediocre growth is not all that hard to achieve. Finally, if high top marginal tax rates had a multi-year effect, we&#8217;d see a distinctive pattern in paler blue in this chart, but we don&#8217;t. The paler blue, longer term comparisons seem bounded by the single year effect.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>The data used in this scatterplot is the same data used to build the bar chart in this <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=278">this post</a>.</p>
