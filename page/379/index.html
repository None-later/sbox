                                <p>It took me many years to understand the phrase &#8220;moral hazard.&#8221;  It&#8217;s a fundamental tenet of economics, usually used to explain that, since consumers are untrustworthy, businesses need to charge them more.*</p>
<p>It was finally cleared up for me in the midst of a presentation last year about how it&#8217;s a &#8220;moral hazard&#8221; issue that divorce rates go up as more women work outside of the house/family business. So I asked the presenter, &#8220;You mean it&#8217;s a moral hazard issue that women who have an independent income can now get out of an abusive relationship?&#8221;</p>
<p>Fortunately, one of the best Labor Economists in the world was in the room.  He just looked up and said, &#8220;Or guys start leaving their wives because the wife can go to work now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aha!  The light dawns: moral hazard is, indeed, about power relationships: it allows arseholes to be even greater arseholes.  (One step further, and you start spouting Ayn Rand.)</p>
<p>Preceding is preamble to correcting <a target="_blank" href="http://www.philly.com/dailynews/local/20091104_Pension___seen_as_ticket_to_end_SEPTA_picket.html">an error made by a worker in today&#8217;s <em>Phialdelphia Daily News</em></a> (h/t Dr. Black, of course):<br />
<blockquote>Yesterday, Local 234 President Willie Brown said that the wage package was acceptable but that he was worried about the underfunded pension fund, funded only 52 percent. He said he believed that SEPTA had not contributed to it for 10 to 12 years&#8230;.</p>
<p>&#8220;We could wake up and our pension could be completely gone,&#8221; [Brown] said. &#8220;We don&#8217;t want to end up like AIG,&#8221; referring to the international insurance giant who got $173 billion since last fall in a U.S. government bailout.</p></blockquote>
<p>Mr. Brown should not worry about that.  AIG&#8217;s creditors (e.g., The Great Vampire Squid) were paid in full, because Tim Geithner and Larry Summers want a veto-proof Republican majority by 2012, if not 2010.**</p>
<p>Pensioners, otoh, are subject to &#8220;moral hazard.&#8221;  Believing their contracts were viable, reasonable, and negotiated by people who were working in the best interest of the firm—that is, people who were not writing a check with their mouth that their pockets couldn&#8217;t cash—clearly causes them not to do enough to save.  Because they don&#8217;t understand that mismanagement of their pension is <em>their fault</em>, and that the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation will only ensure that their pensions will be paid &#8220;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.pbgc.gov/workers-retirees/auto-sector.html">up to certain limits</a>,&#8221; no matter how much extra Roger Smith or Michael Eisner or Jack Welch took from the company for <a target="_blank" href="http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/02/13/jack-welch-and-the-lone-ranger-theory/?apage=2">performing almost as well as the rest of the stock market</a>.</p>
<p>So, let us say to Mr. Brown and the rest of the workers who depend on their pensions being funded: Don&#8217;t worry about being treated the way AIG was.  You&#8217;re going to be dealt with as a &#8220;moral hazard&#8221; problem for believing that the contract you negotiated will be enforced.</p>
<p>Why, if those workers were at all sensible, they would have taken the money upfront the way those Captains of Industry did, instead of gotten a false sense of security (&#8220;moral hazard&#8221;) from contractual negotiations about future payments.</p>
<p>As noted by Dr. Black, while management claims that they are fulfilling their legal obligations, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.philly.com/inquirer/world_us/20091106_How_the_pension_fund_figures_in_SEPTA_strike.html">management&#8217;s pension fund is almost 25% better funded than the workers fund</a> (53% v 65%).</p>
<p>This is, of course, A Good Thing.  After all, we wouldn&#8217;t want workers to believe that what they think of as Contractual Obligations is anything other than a case of &#8220;moral hazard.&#8221;</p>
<p>UPDATE: I see, via David Wessel&#8217;s Twitter feed, that <a target="_blank" href="http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2009/11/05/economy-had-a-heart-attack-and-defibrillators-are-scarce/#">Ricardo Caballero puts forth standard Economics Reasoning</a>:<br />
<blockquote>His idea is likely to give heartburn to many economists and policy makers, who worry about “moral hazard” — the idea that if financial institutions know they’ll be saved in an emergency, they’ll take even greater risks that will inevitably lead to greater disasters.</p>
<p>Don’t fret, says Mr. Caballero: “this moral hazard perspective is the equivalent of discouraging the placement of defibrillators in public places because of the concern that, upon seeing them, people would have a sudden urge to consume cheeseburgers.”</p></blockquote>
<p>After all, we just have to acknowledge that &#8220;moral hazard&#8221; exemptions are the rule, not the exception, for mismanaged businesses.  After all, paying out more in bonuses than you make in a year is a <a target="_blank" href="http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/11/02/banker-bonus-rain/?scp=1&#038;sq=bonus&#038;st=cse">Perfectly Reasonable Business Strategy</a>.</p>
<p>*Seriously. The standard example is that people &#8220;don&#8217;t tell the whole truth&#8221; on health insurance applications, so companies <strong>need</strong> to charge them more.  The logical extension of this is that people who tell the whole truth are leaving money on the table, since no insurance company would <em>ever</em> take an <em>ex poste</em> action against people who omit or forget that sprained ankle from thirty years ago.  For an alternate view, see <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/08/29/050829fa_fact">Malcolm Gladwell</a>.</p>
<p>**There <em>may</em> be an alternate explanation, but this one requires the fewest outlandish assumptions.</p>

                                <p>By Spencer,</p>
<p>The unemployment rate jumped to 10.2%. Except for the peak rate of 10.8% after the 1982 recession this is the highest in the post WW II era.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SvQ6SxDF12I/AAAAAAAAA9k/npY7Q9utprY/s1600-h/Clipboard05.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SvQ6SxDF12I/AAAAAAAAA9k/npY7Q9utprY/s320/Clipboard05.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a></p>
<p>The overall tenor of the report was very similar to the past three months reports and sent the message that the economy is no longer collapsing as it was earlier this year, but it is still in a recession. The encouraging news in the report was that temporary employment improved and that manufacturing hours worked and averge work week improved. This implies that the recession may be over in the manufacturing sector, but not in the service sector.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SvQ6OdiRB_I/AAAAAAAAA9c/0rrRdIWkHy4/s1600-h/Clipboard04.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SvQ6OdiRB_I/AAAAAAAAA9c/0rrRdIWkHy4/s320/Clipboard04.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a></p>
<p>Because service employment is about 112.5 million versus 11.7 million in manufacturing the improvement in manufacturing was swamped by the continued fall in services. Consequently, aggregate hours worked fell 0.2%. This is similar to the numbers in yesterday&#8217;s productivity report and implies that fourth quarter productivity will also be strong with all that implies for<br />weak employment.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SvQ6C4r5uoI/AAAAAAAAA9M/02s3Bq1ic6g/s1600-h/Clipboard02.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SvQ6C4r5uoI/AAAAAAAAA9M/02s3Bq1ic6g/s320/Clipboard02.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a><br />Average hourly earnings did improve, as both average hourly earnings and average weekly earnings rose by 0.3%. But with oil up about $10 last month this is unlikely to generate an improvement in real wages or income. On the encouraging side, maybe the past years actual decline in nominal personal income growth may be ending.</p>

                                <p>lifted from comments by run 75441</p>
<p>These are comments that I found interesting describing change to manufacturing processes over tha last few decades.  It made for a foil next to Martin ford&#8217;s projections and our understanding of past events.  It is not a post but I learned a few things.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The key example is stamps for bashing metal which shape metal into one form.&#8221;  from Robert&#8217;s post on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/"></a><br />&#8230;..made me smile.</p>
<p>No one buys a stamping press that will make only one part. Stamping companies do buy stamping tooling (that die going into the stamping press) for a particular part. It is very possible to dedicate a stamping press to one part given the capacity of the machine and the volume of the part; however, different tooling can still be inserted into the stamping press dependent upon the machine&#8217;s bed. There is flexibility to buying a stamping press and it can be used for various parts, even in Henry Ford&#8217;s days. There is also flexibility to the stamping tooling by buying progressive dies which will do multiple operations in one press.  </p>
<p>There has also been an evolution from manual machines and automatics to NC and CNC machines over the years. Let’s talk about throughput first though. Everyone is familiar with Henry Ford&#8217;s assembly line were the vehicle in some form of assembly moves down the line. At each station, another part is added until the end when the car is complete. This type of assembly is still being used. What most people didn&#8217;t see was the departments of machines (annealing, stamping, grinding, deburring, welding, turret lathes, automatics, drill presses, etc.) dedicated by function and not by flow of parts to supporting that assembly line These departments were not dedicated to the flow of a part through the plant the same as one might see in the assembly of a car. Each of the departments could be located in the corners of the building creating distances of transportation, requiring multiples of forklifts and labor to move parts from one operation to another, to stock eventually, and then from stock to final assembly (not including the multiple amounts of part inspections).</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Magnify this by economic order quantities determined by Demand (months or weeks), Machine Setup (manuals and automatics setups were frequently measured in shifts), etc. It was used to determine a hopefully optimum inventory manufacturing lot based upon constants such as purchasing cost, carrying cost, fixed lead times, demand; which all of them at one time never were constant. The supply chain from customer order, to 100% of the Lot order, and going out the door could be months long . . . i.e. a casting having a 12 week lead time, through, 8 weeks long, etc. There was also a constant battle between Manufacturing, who wished to optimize setup, and typically Materials hoping to optimize inventory (unless they were into build it to be safe mode).</p>
<p>You have a factory setup by machine function rather than throughput and the functions scattered through the plant. Is it is any wonder why, there was a huge requirement for Labor to move parts, to operate each of the machines by function, have excessive transit distances, and manufacturing times plus lead times??? A part processing spaghetti farm. Using Pareto analysis of the flow of parts through a factory from the routing of operations to make a part, it is, and was entirely possible to achieve a much more efficient layout of a factory by eliminating machine departments by function, layout the shop floor by major part flows from receiving to shipping, and in the end reduce internal transit time and labor required, improve throughput and delivery, and reduce EOQ for a part until manufacturing whined about &#8220;setups.&#8221; All of this could be achieved without buying one CNC machine. It is the process of manufacturing that can make a huge difference.</p>
<p>So what did the CNC and or NC machine do for manufacturing? It combined operations such as drill, threading, boring, and lathe. No longer did a company need a drill press, lathe, etc functionality except for alternative runs,  because all of those operations were resident to one machine. With tooling for each function resident to the machine; setups were reduced, and again there was a reduction of setup, machine, and forklift operators. It also cut down on the size of the plant needed as all of the operations were resident to one machine instead of taking up valuable floor space. The only thing it didn&#8217;t impact was inventory as people like that “feelie-feelie” type of safety in it rather than rely upon capacity and speed of throughput.</p>
<p>I am going to disagree a little with your take on implementing new product or new parts. I would suggest it happened consecutively with the running of old product. While it is true that brown field analysis and change over of the shop floor might be disruptive, it was typically planned for and the necessary inventory laid aside to handle demand. In turn the plant people were used to move machinery around. In the end, the changes were implemented on weekends, holidays, Christmas shutdown, Summer shutdowns, etc. </p>
<p>Is it capital equipment or is it a process called kanban impacting throughput? Kanban doesn&#8217;t have an outlay for its implementation other than to change the way we think about making parts and product, one part or product at a time, in the smallest increment of inventory possible, and correctly each time. It doesn&#8217;t even require computerization (internally) to implement as it is a pull type system rather than a push or build to forecasted demand system. In each operation, the inventory, wait time, operation time, and transit time is minimized. Is the success of Toyota based upon CNC equipment or is it in the process of manufacture itself? You give way to much credit to computerization of machines. There is something else a brewing and I liked Spencer&#8217;s explanation.  </p>
<p>There was a time when one spent a lot of time as an apprentice to operate a lathe or to be a tool and dye maker. You are right; this is a vanishing &#8220;skilled&#8221; capability. Instead we rely upon computer cad cam to image parts and then apply the correct operations needed to shape the part in a Mazak or Cincinnati Milacron CNC. It does not occur quite a quick as you state does; but, it certainly is another consolidation point of various operations.</p>
<p>I consulted at a company called Miami Industries (taken over) in the glorious town of Piqua. I lived in MadCity WI and spent much of my time consulting in Ohio. They were meeting much of their customer order lead times when demanded of them; but, they had difficulties doing so. The process was simple (as I recall): slit and cut flat stock (came in rolls), draw over mandrill and weld, burnish outside to eliminate welding burr, cut to size, bend to shape, plate or coat. The company wanted to know how to improve delivery.  </p>
<p>At 30-someting and looking like doogie-howser, I got no respect and always had an older consultant with me (colonel sanders this time). I went on the plant tour and listen to their spiel. They ran monthly lot sizes (20 day, 5 days/week) and wanted to improve deliver to weekly from whatever it was  . . .  </p>
<p>I looked at the VP of Manufacturing and said; with a 20 day manufacturing lot size, you are averaging 10 day deliveries on any order. &#8220;Oh no, we can get then out in 5 days if needed.&#8221; Yes, but the average is 10 days. Given the size of the Manufacturing Lots planned from the customer orders accumulated, the company having an average throughput of 10 days made sense. If they wanted to improve delivery, than cut the lot sizes to 10 days from 20 days which would increase the turns of the orders on the shop floor. It would be a start towards a much quicker throughput, less inventory on the floor and in stock on either end, and improved delivery.  </p>
<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t do that because of the setup.&#8221; Change your setup by making it more efficient with tooling resident to the machine, handles instead of nuts and wrenches, and look at the costs of inventory as opposed to setup, etc. The excuses for not doing something were endless and this change did not involve one new piece of capital equipment. I have another word for them; but for now I will settle for  . . . &#8220;whims.&#8221;  Oliver Wight used to call them “cement heads.”</p>
<p>The whole issue revolved around lot sizing. I set out to prove how silly they were and that my average of 10 days was spot-on. They had a shop floor system that collected data on each operation. I was able to look at each Mandrel and ascertain the amount of time for a lot to clear it, the setup times involved, the start of the next operation and total time, and transit times between operations. 75% was sit around time waiting for the operation, 8% was transit time, 10% was setup time and the balance was actual operational time making parts. Oh, an average lead time varied from 9.3 to 10.1 days for an order. Not only was my quoted average correct; but, there was adequate cost savings to be had in inventory reduction to also justify the change. I was hated . . . the life of a throughput analyst!  Don’t chase technology for technology sake.</p></blockquote>

<p>Martin Ford offers one man&#8217;s look into the future of a world in the USA of the results of continued increasing productivity, increasing income inequality, declining wage compensation, and consumption supported by debt.</p>
<p>Robert touched on the issue <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/11/vague-thoughts-on-theory-of-firm.html">recently</a>, and Sandwichman has developed a range of thoughts on labor at Econospeak.  One post cannot handle the complexities, but here is a start to the conversation.</p>
<blockquote><p>Could Advancing Job Automation Technology Cause Structural Unemployment?</p>
<p>The unemployment situation is looking increasingly dismal. Is it possible that there&#8217;s something going on that no one wants to acknowledge? </p>
<p>There can be little doubt that computers, robotic technologies and other forms of job automation have been getting far more capable and that as this trend continues, more workers are certain to be displaced in the relatively near future. Most economists dismiss any concern that this might lead to long-term structural unemployment. At the risk of being labeled a &#8220;neo-Luddite,&#8221; I&#8217;d like to explore this issue a little further. </p>
<p>I think I can make a fairly strong argument that a very large percentage of jobs are, on some level, essentially routine and repetitive in nature. In other words, the job can be broken down into a discrete set of tasks that tend to get repeated on a regular basis. It seems likely that, as both hardware and software continue to advance, a large fraction of these job types are ultimately going to be susceptible to machine or software automation. </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m not talking about far fetched science fiction-level technology here: this is really a simple extrapolation of the expert systems and specialized algorithms that can currently land jet airplanes, trade autonomously on Wall Street, or beat nearly any human being at a game of chess. As technology progresses, I think there is little doubt that these systems will begin to match or exceed the capability of human workers in many routine job categories&#8211;and this includes a lot of workers with college degrees or other significant training. Many workers will also be increasingly threatened by the continuing trend toward self-service technologies that push tasks onto consumers. </p>
<p>One of the most extreme historical examples of technologically induced job losses is, of course, the mechanization of agriculture. In the late 1800s, about three quarters of workers in the U.S. were employed in agriculture. Today, the number is around 2-3%. Advancing technology irreversibly eliminated millions of jobs. </p>
<p>Obviously, when agriculture mechanized, we did not end up with long-term structural unemployment. Workers were absorbed by other industries, and average wages and overall prosperity increased dramatically. The historical experience with agriculture is, in fact, an excellent illustration of the so-called &#8220;Luddite fallacy.&#8221; This is the idea&#8211;and I think it is generally accepted by economists&#8211;that technological progress will never lead to massive, long-term unemployment.</p>
<p>The reasoning behind the Luddite fallacy goes roughly like this: As labor-saving technologies improve, some workers lose their jobs in the short run, but production also becomes more efficient. That leads to lower prices for the goods and services produced, and that, in turn, leaves consumers with more money to spend on other things. When they do so, demand increases across nearly all industries&#8211;and that means more jobs. That seems to be exactly what happened with agriculture: food prices fell as efficiency increased, and then consumers went out and spent their extra money elsewhere, driving increased employment in the manufacturing and service sectors. </p>
<p>The question we have to ask is whether or not that same scenario is likely to play out again. The problem is that this time we are not talking about a single industry being automated: these technologies are going to penetrate across the board. When agriculture mechanized, there were clearly other labor intensive sectors capable of absorbing the workers. There&#8217;s little evidence to suggest that&#8217;s going to be the case this time around. </p>
<p>It seems to me that, as automation penetrates nearly everywhere, there must come a &#8220;tipping point,&#8221; beyond which the overall economy is simply not labor intensive enough to continue absorbing workers who lose their jobs due to automation (or globalization). Beyond this point, businesses will be able to ramp up production primarily by employing machines and software&#8211;and structural unemployment then becomes inevitable.</p>
<p>If we reach that point, then I think we also have a serious problem with consumer demand. If automation is relentless, then the basic mechanism that gets purchasing power into the hands of consumers begins to break down.  As a thought experiment, imagine a fully automated economy. Virtually no one would have a job (or an income); machines would do everything. So where would consumption come from? If we&#8217;re still considering a market (rather than a planned) economy, why would production continue if there weren&#8217;t any viable consumers to purchase the output? Long before we reached that extreme point of full automation, it seems pretty clear that mass-market business models would become unsustainable. </p>
<p>One of the things that concerns me the most about this scenario is the potential influence of consumer psychology. If at some point in the future consumers look out the window and see a landscape where jobs are relentlessly getting automated away, and if it appears that getting additional education or training provides little protection, there&#8217;s likely to be a significant negative impact on consumer sentiment and discretionary spending. If we someday get into a reinforcing cycle driven by fear of automation, a very dark scenario could ensue. It&#8217;s difficult to see how traditional policies like stimulus spending or tax cuts would be effective because they wouldn&#8217;t address consumers&#8217; concerns about long-term income continuity.</p>
<p>Most economists will likely object to my arguments here as speculative and lacking in objective data. I think that if you look at issues like stagnating or declining wages for average workers, growing income inequality, increasing productivity, and consumption supported by debt rather than income, you can certainly find evidence that generally suggests we might be approaching that &#8220;tipping point&#8221; where structural unemployment is going to become a problem. However, it seems unlikely that an econometric analysis of past data is going offer clear support for this theory&#8211;and if it ever does, it will be very late in the game. </p>
<p>I wonder about the wisdom of the extreme emphasis on quantitative data analysis that seems to characterize economics. Should we really steer the ship exclusively by focusing our telescope on the wake? There might be an iceberg ahead.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>by Divorced one like Bush</p>
<p>Bruce Webb put up a post titled &#8220;<a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/10/health-care-exchange-eligibility-vs.html">Health Care Exchange: Eligibility vs. Enrollment</a>&#8220;.  I have gained some clarification on the subject and have shared it with Bruce.  I have asked him to comment also.</p>
<p>There is a concern as to whether access to the Public Option (PO) was limited.  Bruce&#8217;s reading of the bill was that everyone has access to the PO based on section 411(3) which reads:<br />
<blockquote>3) CONTRIBUTION IN LIEU OF COVERAGE.— <br />Beginning with Y2, if an employee declines such offer but otherwise obtains coverage in an Exchange- participating health benefits plan (other than by reason of being covered by family coverage as a spouse or dependent of the primary insured), the employer shall make a timely contribution to the Health Insurance Exchange with respect to each such employee in accordance with section 413.</p></blockquote>
<p>Thus, the PO is not as restricted as people thought and in the future the possibility is that it could grow and be what people are saying it would be; a force for controlling costs, especially regarding insurance premiums.  Sounds good, no?</p>
<p>My reading was that section 411(3) was tied in some way to whether your employer was &#8220;exchange eligible&#8221; or not.  There are provisions that would allow all employers in the future to be exchange eligible but it is dependent on a report or two being produced and then the &#8220;commissioner&#8221; acting on the report or congress acting on the report.  To me, this leaves too much political wiggle room.  </p>
<p>I think we both assumed that exchange eligible or not, if the employee chose the PO, the employer would have to pay for the choice by paying into the exchange, the result being that the cost to the employee would be the same regardless of what decision said employee makes.</p>
<p>Well, Bruce was correct.  Everyone has the option to choose the PO.  Though there is a financial barrier.  A big financial barrier that in my opinion makes this bill crap.  I&#8217;ll post my thoughts more on this later.</p>
<p>I contacted my congress person&#8217;s office.  They put me in touch with their legislative person.  I asked this person (via email) which of us were correct.  </p>
<p>Turns out, as noted, Bruce is correct that everyone has the option for the PO.  However, if you make this choice in lieu of  accepting one of the employer provided options you, my friend are on your own.  You are on your own and will have to accept the total cost of the PO plan because the payment your employer makes into the exchange does not follow you.</p>
<p>The reason given for such a set up in the house bill is that there is concern that the employers would push their employees into the exchange.  The legislative person noted that HR 3962 specifically is attempting to discourage this.  </p>
<p>This is the essential two responses by the legislative person:<br />
<blockquote>Any individual (but not any employer) can participate in the Exchange and therefore could sign up for the public option.  BUT, to do so, they would have to dis-enroll in their qualifying coverage and meet the other requirements necessary to participate in the Exchange.  However, there is zero incentive for anyone to do this since they’d be responsible for 100% of the cost of the care they chose in the Exchange.  If they stuck with their employer sponsored or other qualifying care, the vast majority of the cost of coverage is picked up by someone other than the individual.  That’s why so few people are projected to enter into the public option.  Additionally, access to the Exchange, and the public option, IS restricted for employers.  Only the smallest businesses can use it at first, and later slightly larger businesses.  The Secretary can then choose to open it up to all employers if she feels the Exchange has the capacity to handle that.  The goal is to do so.  </p></blockquote>
<p>I then asked: <em>411(3) notes that the employer has to make a contribution to the exchange following the rules of section 413 if the employee chooses to get health care via such.  How does this square with your statement that the employee would be 100% responsible for the cost of the exchange coverage?  Is the employer contribution not tied to their employee&#8217;s choice?  That is, the employer is just simply being charged as a participate in the over all exchange pool to provide the exchange money and thus the payment is not an offset of the cost incurred by the employee to purchase coverage from the exchange?</em><br />There response:<br />
<blockquote> Exactly—money does not follow the person in the House bill.  The Senate Finance bill does attempt to have the money the money follow the person I believe, but that gets complicated and provides a potential incentive for employers to try and push employees into the Exchange, which is expressly discouraged in HR 3269.  </p></blockquote>

<p>Third quarter nonfarm productivity rose at a 9.5% annual rate as output rose 4.0% and hours worked fell at a 5.0% rate.  Historically, productivity has been a very good leading indicator of real GDP growth lagged two quarters.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SvLv9AWXR-I/AAAAAAAAA8U/cQqV9JlW0yE/s1600-h/Clipboard01.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SvLv9AWXR-I/AAAAAAAAA8U/cQqV9JlW0yE/s320/Clipboard01.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a>Productivity is also highly cyclical and the first year of a recovery typically experiences the strongest productivity growth.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SvLuoNF_yuI/AAAAAAAAA8E/0daJUAfPQ-U/s1600-h/Clipboard03.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SvLuoNF_yuI/AAAAAAAAA8E/0daJUAfPQ-U/s320/Clipboard03.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a></p>
<p>Compensation jumped to a 3.8% annual rate, but on a year over year basis it is only up 0.5%.<br />Consequently, the year over year change in unit labor cost was -5.2%, the largest drop in recent years.  With productivity growth this strong and such weak compensation growth it is hard to see how anyone can be seriously concerned about a resurgence of inflation.  Except for oil, even surging commodity prices would not have a significant impact on the overall price level since they account for such a small share of final prices.  Moreover, since potential GDP is a function of productivity growth and labor force growth the argument that the very large GDP gap is overstated does not seem to hold much weight as long as productivity growth is so strong.</p>

<p>Last evening the <a target="_blanks" href="http://cboblog.cbo.gov/?p=414">CBO Director Blog</a> announced the release of a score of the Boehner amendment: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/107xx/doc10705/hr3962amendmentBoehner.pdf">A Preliminary Analysis of a Substitute Amendment to H.R. 3962, the Affordable Health Care for America Act</a>. The results are not impressive: (as always click to enlarge)<br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SvLsmiuzmBI/AAAAAAAAAVM/lr71klquZjg/s1600-h/Boehner-dollars.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SvLsmiuzmBI/AAAAAAAAAVM/lr71klquZjg/s400/Boehner-dollars.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SvLsmBBmA_I/AAAAAAAAAVE/08X3_2AgUss/s1600-h/Boehner-coverage.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SvLsmBBmA_I/AAAAAAAAAVE/08X3_2AgUss/s400/Boehner-coverage.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />The amendment is scored at reducing the deficit by $68 billion over ten years. I can&#8217;t get the breakdown to add up (see page 4) but most of the savings is in the form of malpractice reform at $54 billion with further savings from some administrative changes relating to electronic transfers and adoption of the Eschoo Biologics Amendment all of which offsets a whopping $8 billion net actually spent to expand coverage. So what do we get from spending an average of just around $800 million a year? Essentially nothing, CBO projects that the percentage of the legal non-elderly population without health insurance will stay right at 83%.</p>
<p>I suggest the words &#8216;Epic fail&#8217; apply here.

<p>The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nasi.org/usr_doc/Fixing_Social_Security.pdf">National Academy of Social Insurance</a> report on options for Social Security is public and now available in pdf form. &#8220;The purpose of this report is to help analysts and policymakers consider options to bring Social Security into long-term balance in ways that also address concerns about benefit adequacy.&#8221; </p>
<p>One cannot simply glance through such dense material and numbers, but I did find the following on page 14 (or actually page 20 of 44 pdf form). (the exact numbers have been changed from the proposal by NASI, but are faithful to the process):  </p>
<p>From page 14:<br />
<blockquote>Option #7c: Schedule a Very Gradual Contribution Rate Increase Over 20 Years. To avoid abrupt changes in Social Security contribution rates, this option would schedule very gradual increases in the Social Security contribution rate (one-twentieth of one percent per year over 20 years for employees and employers, each), beginning in 2015. By 2035, the Social Security rate would be 7.2 percent for both workers and employers. In 2015, the increase for an average earner making $53,085 then would be $26.50 a year, or about 50 cents a week. It would reduce the 75-year deficit by 1.39 percent of taxable payroll or by about 69 percent. Dale Coberly, a frequent commenter on Social Security, recommended a gradual tax increase of this sort (Coberly, Larson and Webb 2009).11</p></blockquote>
<p>Footnote also on page 14 of the NASI report:<br />
<blockquote>11 Dale Coberly is a student of Social Security policy and frequent commenter on Social Security via the blog Angry Bear. Angry Bear was named one of the top 25 independent economic blogs on the Internet by the Wall Street Journal and TimeCNN. Coberly, Arne Larson and Bruce Webb collaborated on a modified version of this option in their Northwest Plan. For details of the Northwest Plan, see “The Angry Bear Social Security Series” at http://bruceweb.blogspot.com/2008/08/angry-bear-social-security-series.html.</p></blockquote>
<p>Like many contributors not in the spotlight the hours devoted to creating material to even be noticed, then evaluated, and then published is a testimony to hard work, due diligence, and a non-profit motive. The weekend hours and midnight oil burned by NASI personnel and contributors is rarely noticed by media, nor appreciated by recipients.  Many of us talk about &#8216;they&#8217;&#8230;.well, meet three.  Best to Bruce, Dale, and Arne.</p>
