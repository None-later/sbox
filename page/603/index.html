                                <p>Calculated risk is out today and just reported the head line trade data and  linked to the Wall Street Journal  calling the  improvement in the trade balance a  surprise<a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SHdxgSIN70I/AAAAAAAAAS0/QvRkwPy2p4U/s1600-h/Clipboard01t.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SHdxgSIN70I/AAAAAAAAAS0/QvRkwPy2p4U/s320/Clipboard01t.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a></p>
<p>But  the real trade deficit improved from  $ -46,966 M (2000 $) in March to $-46,679 in April and $-43,589 M in May.  Remember, the improvement from March to May is what will be reported as  a positive for the second quarter real GDP growth. In the GDP accounts trade and inventories are calculated on the basis of the change from quarter end to quarter end.  All the other GDP data is the three month moving average.<br />

On a smoothed basis (3 month moving average) real nonpetroleum imports were down 1%. On an unsmoothed basis,May real petroleum imports were about the same as they averaged in 2002.</p>
<p>One of the things to remember is that US real oil imports represent the US marginal demand curve for world oil.  As domestic consumption weakens essentially all the drop in domestic oil demand shows up as a drop in imports.</p>

                                <p>by Tom Bozzo</p>
<p>I was working on a much more detailed post when The Onion, Priceless National Treasure it is, gave a portion of the subject the <a href="http://www.theonion.com/content/opinion/were_investing_so_much_in">treatment</a> it arguably deserves.</p>
<p>Somewhat more seriously, though, the McCain <a href="http://www.johnmccain.com/Images/Issues/JobsforAmerica/briefing.pdf">briefing document</a> is heavy with what would be long-term solutions to an array of more-or-less urgent short-term problems.
<ul>
<li>Oil drilling: The near-term features of the McCain program for the oil market amount to Really Tough Talk (&#8220;John McCain believes we should send a strong message to world markets&#8221;).  There&#8217;s nothing in the plan to address near-term supply tightness &#8212; and they&#8217;re so slick with that Intarwebby thing that the <a href="http://www.johnmccain.com/Informing/Issues/4dbd2cc7-890e-47f1-882f-b8fc4cfecc78.htm">campaign web site</a> still proposes to <a href="http://www.mcclatchydc.com/242/story/37393.html">stop filling the SPR</a>.  The big issue, though, is the expectation that guys like <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/07/t-boone-pickens-places-his-bet-on-wind.html">T. Boone Pickens</a> are right and the current amount of global supply (85-90 million barrels/day) is about all we can expect to see, versus well over 100 million b/d in recent official forecasts.  Undoing that effect requires adding Saudi Arabia-like quantities to the market more-or-less permanently, not the couple million barrels/day that off-limits U.S. sources will produce at their peak in a couple of decades.  I wouldn&#8217;t expect a big price response.  Should McCain manage to win and enact his plan (or Republican pro-drillers manage to peel off Democrats who think we need to Do Something!1!!), don&#8217;t go putting down a deposit on that Escalade.</li>
<li>Transportation: Apart from the <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2008/06/you-make-the-ca.html">silly battery prize</a>, the big proposal is a tax credit for zero-emissions cars.  There are worse ideas, but a big shift to electric cars would require R&#038;D and other investments in the electricity grid, distributed power technologies, and the like which could use considerable funding (see money to be thrown at coal, below).  As for other transportation modes, there are no other transportation modes as far as the published McCain program is concerned.  So in McCain world, the path out of transportation-caused oil dependency is from power plants to your future car&#8217;s battery pack.</li>
<li>Electricity: The McCain plans, as we&#8217;ve previously seen, promote nuclear and &#8220;clean coal.&#8221;  The 45 new reactors would probably be needed just to maintain nuclear&#8217;s share of the generation portfolio, given the age of the fleet.  As it happens, the nuclear industry is more aggressive than McCain, with applications for 15 reactors somewhere in the <a href="http://www.nrc.gov/reactors/new-licensing/new-licensing-files/expected-new-rx-applications.pdf">NRC permitting pipeline</a>, and 19 more applications expected between now and 2010.  Getting nuclear economics to work would be greatly facilitated by the <a href="http://www.johnmccain.com/Informing/Issues/da151a1c-733a-4dc1-9cd3-f9ca5caba1de.htm">McCain cap-and-trade plan</a>, whose absence in the briefing document is a huge omission, <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/07/how-serious-is-mccain-about-cap.html">whatever we&#8217;re to make of it</a>.  The &#8220;clean coal&#8221; program is in <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/30/business/30coal.html?pagewanted=all">disarray</a> and would need substantial funding to get back on track, but with theoretically more efficient approaches to carbon capture just taking their <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/cen/news/86/i09/8609notw1.html">initial steps out of the laboratory</a>, it&#8217;s not obvious that McCain can do much to get the technology to market very far ahead of the 2020s time frame assumed by the Electric Power Research Institute, not exactly a tree-hugger&#8217;s hangout by throwing his $2 billion/year at the problem.  Meanwhile, there are no specific plans to fund any other needed electricity-system R&#038;D.  Making the renewables tax credit permanent is a genuinely useful feature of the McCain program, if not exactly a radical proposal, and otherwise staying out of the way of renewables development is not bad for a Republican.</li>
<li>Energy Efficiency: McCain is pro-CAFE and pro-energy-efficient building, but doesn&#8217;t stake a position on whether current and forthcoming standards are adequate or how they might be improved.  Should oil prices drop substantially, we&#8217;d need some substance here to support McCain&#8217;s anti-oil-dependency rhetoric, as the &#8217;90s experience shows.</li>
</ul>
<p>So what do we have?  Long-term commitments to do Things Republicans Like (drill for oil, burn coal) surrounded with a lot of hand-waving and redirection as to how those will solve current problems.</p>

<blockquote><p>A federal judge in California said Wednesday that the wiretapping law established by Congress was the “exclusive” means for the president to eavesdrop on Americans, and he rejected the government’s claim that the president’s constitutional authority as commander in chief trumped that law.</p>
<p>The judge, Vaughn R. Walker, the chief judge for the Northern District of California, made his findings in a ruling on a lawsuit brought by an Oregon charity. The group says it has evidence of an illegal wiretap used against it by the National Security Agency under the secret surveillance program established by President Bush after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.</p>
<p>The Justice Department has tried for more than two years to kill the lawsuit, saying any surveillance of the charity or other entities was a “state secret” and citing the president’s constitutional power as commander in chief to order wiretaps without a warrant from a court under the agency’s program.</p></blockquote>
<p>These actions continue the notion of a unitary right to spy domestically.</p>
<blockquote><p>The immunity issue would not directly affect this lawsuit because Al-Haramain is suing the government, not the phone companies. But the nearly 40 other lawsuits against phone companies that Judge Walker is overseeing would almost certainly have to be dismissed if immunity is signed into law, legal analysts say.</p></blockquote>
<p>A right to review evidence after a long period of time, not during an emergency but through a perpetual state of war condition, is still an issue in freedom loving America.</p>
<p>In addition a program called &#8220;Terrorism Liaison Officer&#8221; or TLO program is reported on:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_9725077">The Denver Post</a> notes the continued development of spying on citizens by Homeland Security:</p>
<blockquote><p>What we&#8217;re advocating for is developing a standardized process that can be put in place across the country so that frontline police officers (and others) are trained to recognize behaviors associated with certain activities related to terrorism,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Major city police chiefs are participating.</p>
<p>Civil libertarians questioned why firefighters, paramedics and corporate employees &#8211; such as Xcel Energy and railroad officials in Colorado &#8211; are drafted into the effort. They say public trust in emergency responders will suffer.</p>
<p>The emerging TLO system &#8220;empowers the police officer to poke his nose into your business when you&#8217;re doing absolutely nothing wrong. It moves the police officer away from his core function, to enforce the law, into being an intelligence officer gathering information about people,&#8221; said Mike German, a 16-year FBI agent now advising the American Civil Liberties Union.</p></blockquote>
<p>.</p>
<p>My experience with the spotty quality of spying&#8230;er, reporting information&#8230;is serious, and know it can get quite personally oriented. If the FBI cannot train their own professionals in the use of emergency letters of information, how in the world will the police chief do so? And why? That Amtrak conductor is watching you&#8230;or the phone repair guy.  </p>
<p>And if the reporting is secret you will never know what is in the file, nor why, nor how long it is kept, nor who has access.  About like my credit file&#8230;maybe a free report every few years to correct for gossip and malice makes it more palatable. So far TLO is small&#8230;but remember NYC police spying and how it was used.</p>
<p><sarcasm>If they are watching Arabs, fine?  If they are watching Quakers, fine?  But nothing remains focused and small in the spying business these days.<br />I did make a connection that if you keep guns as a deterrent to a government tyranny, please explain how you support this kind of reporting as well? Where is the NRA when you need them? <sarcasm off></p>

                                <p><a href="http://one-salient-oversight.blogspot.com/2008/07/old-accusations-new-enemy.html">One Salient Oversight</a> sends some thoughts from down under on recycling labels:</p>
<p>Think of the common labels thrown out against political opponents these<br />days. What sort of political thinking would be labelled in the following<br />way?</p>
<p>* The propagation of ideas like Darwinism, Marxism, the teachings of<br />Nietzche, Liberalism, Socialism, Communism and Anarchism.<br />* A focus on Utopianism that is actually unattainable because of the<br />underlying conspiracy within the group.<br />* A movement towards materialism.<br />* Supporting supranational entities notions such as World Government.<br />* A control of the media to promote these evil ideas, under the<br />guise of a &#8220;free press&#8221; (which is actually controlled by the conspiracy).<br />* Sexual licence.<br />* An opposition to Christianity and a promotion of secularism and<br />atheism &#8211; but with an actual evil religion under girding it.</p>
<p>All those descriptions can quite easily be seen as being directed by<br />conservatives against progressives. Consider the following:</p>
<p>* Conservatives often use progressive ideas as a pejorative, and<br />will quite easily label a progressive by a general term. Labelling them<br />as &#8220;communists&#8221;, for example, even though they don&#8217;t espouse Communism.<br />* An argument that progressive ideas are based upon a vision of a<br />&#8220;false utopia&#8221;.<br />* An argument that progressives cannot tolerate faith and are<br />inherently materialist.<br />* Complete opposition to any notion that supranational entities like<br />the United Nations and the European Union are useful. Such entities are<br />either threats to freedom or full of incompetents. Those who support<br />such entities are thus evil.<br />* That the &#8220;Mainstream Media&#8221; is inherently &#8220;liberal&#8221; and has an<br />agenda to promote a particular point of view under the guise of the<br />&#8220;free press&#8221;.<br />* That sexual licence promoted by progressives will end up leading<br />to the destruction of traditional marriage and enforced sexual<br />perversions (like paedophilia and bestiality).<br />* That a conspiracy of progressives is trying to destroy<br />Christianity and replace it with atheism, and that such a conspiracy<br />has, at its base, Satanic and pagan influences.</p>
<p>Sounds terrible doesn&#8217;t it? Or maybe it sounds true. Or maybe, just<br />maybe, someone came up with the same sort of thing during the late<br />nineteenth century (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Protocols_of_the_Elders_of_Zion">Protocols of the Elders of Zion</a>) and directed it towards a societal group that they<br />thought was destroying the world?</p>
<p>In the case of the late nineteenth century, these beliefs were outright<br />lies that were fabricated with the intention of creating ill-will and<br />hatred towards their &#8220;enemy&#8221;. It therefore gives you an idea of how<br />these people &#8211; even those today &#8211; think.<br />&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br />This one by reader One Salient Oversight</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>The <a href="http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/news/election/s_576734.html">Pittsburgh Tribune-Review</a> interviews a Republican who makes Dick Cheney look honest by comparison:</p>
<blockquote><p>And I am convinced, and by the way we have five Nobel Laureates and 200, 300 economists who think that we have a viable proposal that has to do with job creation, that has to do with keeping taxes low, with health &#8212; affordable and available health care, and to making sure that our economy can recover in a robust fashion. Spending in my view is the major contributor to a lot of the economic difficulties we have today. We have allowed spending to get completely out of control. The size of spending has increased by some 40 percent, the greatest increase in &#8220;discretionary spending.&#8221; The greatest increase in size of government since the Great Society.</p></blockquote>
<p>Increases in nominal spending maybe but the ratio of Federal spending to GDP has not increased nearly as much.  Incidentally, McCain suckered those 300 economists to sign something stupid <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/07/mccains-300-economists-may-sign-just.html">before</a> his released his plan.  Some of them are now rejecting key elements of the plan and yet McCain says they agree with it?  Incredibly dishonest!</p>
<p>But here’s a whopper I’ve heard from others:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are watching probably the greatest transfer of wealth perhaps in history from the United States of America to the Middle East and other oil producing countries, $(400) or $500 billion.</p></blockquote>
<p>No, no, no – trades are not transfers of wealth.  No one is forcing us to purchase this oil.  Of course, McCain doesn’t exactly have a magic wand to induce us to buy less.  But the biggest whoppers came when he was asked about Social Security:</p>
<blockquote><p>One, do a better job than has been done in the past of convincing people that it&#8217;s broken. I think you can do that with one chart that shows how much money is going out and how much is coming in, and when there&#8217;s more going out than coming in and when there&#8217;s no money left.</p></blockquote>
<p>For the past 25 years, Social Security has been running surpluses and we’ll see surpluses for another decade or so.  OK – someday we’ll see negative cash flows which will mean that the circa $8 trillion in reserves will start declining over time.  But McCain is arguing there’ll be no money left.  That’s a lie.  But notice that after he said all proposals are on the table, we got this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Trib: Do you favor raising the cap? <br />McCain: Pardon me? <br />Trib: Do you favor raising the cap? <br />McCain: No, and I think by doing so, as Sen. Obama wants to do, you are obviously putting a very, very big increased tax on &#8230; middle income Americans who filing jointly and in other ways will be paying a very big increase.</p></blockquote>
<p>I guess that one’s not on the table.  Odd – people making over $200,000 a year are middle Americans.  But I guess the backdoor employment tax increase inherent in the GOP strategy – cutting Social Security benefits but not cutting payroll taxes, which means that our payroll contributions get diverted to employment taxes – only affects people who aren’t middle Americans.  You know – the peons who make less than a $100,000 a year.  I do declare – John McCain is an elitist (as well as a liar)!</p>

                                <p>So the good news yesterday (h/t <a href="http://www.portfolio.com/views/blogs/market-movers/2008/07/09/extra-credit-wednesday-edition">Felix</a>) is that, even as <a href="http://www.openleft.com/showDiary.do?diaryId=6851">he was voting to eviscerate the Fourth Amendment</a>, Barack Obama <a href="http://www.creditslips.org/creditslips/2008/07/obama-amend-ban.html">urged a change to bankruptcy law</a>.  The devil is in <a href="http://news.lp.findlaw.com/ap/a/p/1131/07-08-2008/20080708070505_14.html">the details</a> (the &#8220;median cost&#8221; of a home in NY State won&#8217;t keep anyone living in their house in Westchester or even Rockland County, let alone PGLville), but it&#8217;s a nice start, as Elizabeth Warren notes:<br />
<blockquote>Obama has history.  He voted against the bankruptcy bill.  He voted in favor of the amendments that would have eased the effects of the amendments. But his real history is deeper. He was a community organizer who saw first-hand the effects of aggressive lending.  He was a state legislator who felt the impact of federal pre-emption on his ability to protect the citizens he represented.</p>
<p>&#8230;McCain also has a history.  McCain has voted in favor of financial institutions since he first went to Washington.  He voted over and over for the bankruptcy bill, and he voted against the amendments to give medical bankrupts a means test exemption, against a uniform minimim homestead for older Americans, against limiting recovery for lenders who violate Truth-in-Lending laws.  After Katrina, McCain opposed an amendment to make procedures easier for victims of natual disasters.  The list is long&#8230;.</p>
<p>The deteriorating economy make bankruptcy a more urgent national issues. Bankruptcy and consumer finance are issues where the money and power is all on one side and the middle class families are on the other.  It is also an area where both candidates have an on-the-record history.  Senator Obama has now thrust bankruptcy issue into the national spotlight.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now, my immediate reaction was to attempt to go short the possibility that Obsidian Wings-favorite Vice Presidential candidate, Joe Biden (D-BofA [nee MBNA]) would be chosen.*  But I can&#8217;t find the contract on intrade, and the <a href="http://politicalmarket.cnn.com/markets/8097">CNN &#8220;political market&#8221;</a> just notes a drop of &#8220;the field&#8221; and HRC** with most of the support going to John Edwards (and some to Bill Richardson).***</p>
<p>So there probably isn&#8217;t a way to directly profit on the Good News from ObamaNation yesterday, but eliminating Joe Biden from the list of possible VP nominees is certainly a Public Good.</p>
<p>*If that does happen, after yesterday&#8217;s speech, I&#8217;m voting for McCain, since it will then be truly impossible to take anything Obama says seriously.</p>
<p>*Must be her FISA vote.</p>
<p>***The positive interpretation is that something like 5.5% of those in the CNN political market really believed that Biden would or should be the VP nominee.  The negative interpretation would be that around 5.5% of those registered believed that Joe Biden would be a good VP choice in the first place.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p><a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=NzRkNzVlYWMzNjY2OTExNDRkNmI1YmUxYjFjZGJmZjM=">Lawrence Kudlow</a> who must be philosophically opposed to anything that makes sense including good public policy went giddy at the prospect that McCain had abandoned this proposal:</p>
<blockquote><p>So I picked up the phone and dialed a senior McCain official to make sure these old eyes hadn’t missed it. Sure enough, on deep background, this senior McCain advisor told me I was correct: no cap-and-trade. In other words, this central-planning, regulatory, tax-and-spend disaster, which did not appear in Mac’s two recent speeches, has been eradicated entirely — even from the detailed policy document that hardly anybody will ever read. So then I asked this senior official if the campaign has taken cap-and-trade out behind the barn and shot it dead once and for all — buried it in history’s dustbin of bad ideas. The answer came back that they are interested in jobs right now — jobs for new energy production and jobs from lower taxes. At that point I became satisfied. Even though a McCain presidency might resurrect cap-and-trade, it will be a much different format. More important, the campaign is cognizant of the conservative rebellion against it.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2008_07/014058.php">Kevin Drum</a> is smart enough not to trust anything that Kudlow writes and he recognizes that Kudlow is “crazy” but then Kevin adds: </p>
<blockquote><p>McCain&#8217;s cap-and-trade plan was a watered down muddle to begin with, and it was obvious his heart was never in it. Still, it was an important part of his effort to seem moderate and bipartisan on energy and environmental issues, and a lot of people bought into it. So if Kudlow is right, it means that McCain is playing a pretty cynical game here: publicly taking credit for a &#8220;maverick&#8221; stand against his own party while quietly getting word out to the base that he isn&#8217;t serious about it. Pretty slick, Senator.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://marcambinder.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/07/mccain_sticks_by_capntrade.php">Marc Ambinder</a> must have sources different from Kudlow’s:</p>
<blockquote><p>Jill Hazelbaker, McCain&#8217;s communications director, calls the notion that McCain is abandoning or minimizing his support for cap-n-trade &#8220;totally false.&#8221;  I think I can reconcile the two views: McCain&#8217;s talking about jobs this week, not cap-n-trade. When he talks about energy &#8212; as he did two weeks ago, he talks about cap-n-trade. Kudlow considers cap-n-trade to be a critical (and negative) part of McCain&#8217;s economic policy; McCain considers it part of his energy policy; in campaigns, these type of issues tend to sort themselves into silos, reasonably, and so it ought not surprise anyone that McCain&#8217;s focus on jobs and taxes doesn&#8217;t tilt too far into energy policy precincts.</p></blockquote>
<p>And now <a href="http://kudlowsmoneypolitics.blogspot.com/2008/07/cap-and-trade-minimizing.html">Kudlow</a> must have gotten the message from the McCain camp to soft pedal the fact that McCain is flip-flopping again:</p>
<blockquote><p>Well, as far as abandoning, that’s not what I said. I wrote that a McCain presidency might resurrect cap-and-trade, although it will be a much different format. But the key point is that several campaign advisors told me that the issue now is jobs and the economy, and of course $4 gas at the pump and $140 oil in the world market. Since cap-and-trade would not only establish the biggest government regulatory plan in history, and also would substantially raise gas and other fuel prices, the idea is a loser right now as every opinion-poll survey clearly shows.  Hence, the senator is being smart to move away from cap-and-trade and instead support drill, drill, drill for more energy supplies to reduce gas prices, as well as tax-cut plans to spur economic growth and jobs.  Mr. McCain is also correct to link drill, drill, drill with new energy-related job creation. In my formulation of this, nuclear power and clean coal are part of drill, drill, drill, as are natural gas and even alternative fuels. Last night former-Sen. Phil Gramm, who is ostensibly McCain’s most senior economic advisor, said as much on our program.  So while Ms. Hazelbaker may say that minimizing cap-and-trade support is totally false, she is engaging in a certain degree of cognitive dissonance on this subject. And let me note that the intent of my piece yesterday was to praise Mr. McCain on this topic, not to bury him.</p></blockquote>
<p>Leave it to Lawrence Kudlow to praise a Republican for talking out of both sides of his mouth!</p>

                                <p>In honor of <a href="http://lefarkins.blogspot.com/2008/07/just-saw-no-to-crack.html">this post</a> (from another blog whose political posts I&#8217;ve stopped reading; Hilzoy is in good company*), I have decided today to shave off my beard and mustache.**</p>
<p>After all, David (&#8220;Axis of Evil&#8221;) Frum is always right, as John Holbo <a href="http://examinedlife.typepad.com/johnbelle/2003/11/dead_right.html">originally documented</a>:<br />
<blockquote>This sentiment or intuition or feeling (whatever you call it) produces a strangely hypertrophic concern with what seem (to me anyway) like rather ornamental details:</p>
<p>&#8220;If I am bearded, and I notice that my boss and the last four men in my section to win promotion are clean-shaven, I will find myself slowly nudged toward the barbershop.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>which led to:<br />
<blockquote>Frum: Just think about it. Our economy depends on a healthy culture.</p>
<p>BG: But you don&#8217;t even care about the economy. You said you don’&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Frum: I wish you hadn&#8217;t mentioned that.</p>
<p>BG: But I did.</p>
<p>Frum: Look, if you shave the beard, everything will be better.</p>
<p>BG: You&#8217;’re a moonbat.</p>
<p>Frum: It’&#8217;s all related to foreign policy and wheelchair access in public school, in ways that would take a long time to explain.</p></blockquote>

<p>**This, of course, has nothing whatsoever to do with a much higher proportion of white hairs being prominently displayed in those two parts of the hair.</p>

                                <p>Back in May, a number of <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/05/fed-frannie-and-freddie.html">people</a> expressed deep concerns over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Their financial cushions were too thin. If they should <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/06/business/06fannie.html?_r=3&#038;hp&#038;oref=slogin&#038;oref=slogin&#038;oref=slogin">fail</a>, then<br />
<blockquote>the mortgage business could lose its only lubricant, potentially causing the housing market to plummet and the credit markets to freeze up completely.</p></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>Because of the widespread perception that the government would intervene if either company failed, they can borrow money at lower interest rates than their competitors. As a result, they have earned enormous profits that have enriched shareholders and managers alike: from 1990 to 2000, each company’s stock grew more than 500 percent and top executives were paid tens of millions of dollars.<br />&#8230;In a March meeting, Freddie Mac’s chairman, Richard F. Syron, bolstered those fears by saying the company would put shareholders’ interests first. </p></blockquote>
<p>Amid <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/06/business/06fannie.html?_r=3&#038;hp&#038;oref=slogin&#038;oref=slogin&#038;oref=slogin">rumours</a> that both companies&#8211;owned by investors but created by Congress&#8211;are now close to collapse and with their stocks plummeting, have we reached rock bottom in the mortgage debacle? And at what cost to the taxpayer, now deep in debt, saddled with sky-rocketing oil prices, and facing a world where food prices may be threatening global stability?</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong>  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac shares were down nearly 50 percent<br />in early trading as investors worried that the companies will<br />suffer larger losses and default on debt.  July 11.</p>
<p><strong>Update 2:</strong>  <a href="http://calculatedrisk.blogspot.com/2008/07/conservatorship-for-fannie-or-freddie.html">CR</a> has some thoughts on the subject.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve heard of mental depression; this is a mental recession,&#8221; he said, noting that growth has held up at about 1 percent despite all the publicity over losing jobs to India, China, illegal immigration, housing and credit problems and record oil prices. &#8220;We may have a recession; we haven&#8217;t had one yet.&#8221; &#8220;We have sort of become a nation of whiners,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You just hear this constant whining, complaining about a loss of competitiveness, America in decline&#8221; despite a major export boom that is the primary reason that growth continues in the economy, he said. &#8220;We&#8217;ve never been more dominant; we&#8217;ve never had more natural advantages than we have today,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We have benefited greatly&#8221; from the globalization of the economy in the last 30 years.</p></blockquote>
<p>Gramm thinks the economic growth rate has been great?  We’ve had one decent annual growth rate since 2000 – that being the 3.6% in 2004 which only partially made up for the slow growth rates from 2001 to 2003 (0.8%, 1.6%, and 2.5%).  Real GDP grew by 3.1% in 2005, 2.9% in 2006, and only 2.2% in 2007.  I guess that’s why the employment to population ratio fell from 64.4% down to 62.0% by September 2003 only to crawl back to 63.4% by December 2006.  The employment to population ratio has since declined 62.4%.  People know that the labor market is currently quite weak but I guess Phil Gramm has not gotten that into his head yet.  </p>
<p>As far as benefiting from globalization – while it is true that export demand growth has been strong for the last few years, real exports fell during each quarter from 2000QIV to 2001QIV and from 2002QIV and 2003QIII.  And during 2007, imports exceeded exports by almost $700 billion.</p>
<blockquote><p>Mr. McCain would tackle intransigent budget deficits by wrestling down burgeoning benefits programs and aggressively attacking wasteful spending whether it&#8217;s in the Pentagon&#8217;s procurement and weapons budget or congressional pork-barrel bills, he said.  A proven &#8220;instrument&#8221; of bipartisan reform and change in many areas, Mr. McCain would seek out Democratic leaders like Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada to fashion a bipartisan reform of Social Security.  Mr. Gramm said a bipartisan deal might include raising the retirement age to 70 over 30 years, indexing the benefits of wealthier retirees to inflation rather than the more generous wage rate, and creating a private account program for younger workers.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m all for eliminating waste and ending the practice of pork-barrel spending but if anyone thinks this will significantly reduce the massive Federal deficit and pay for McCain’s tax cuts, let me suggest they return to kindergarten and start over with their math skills.  It would seem, however, that the McCain camp is signaling that they want to reduce Social Security benefits.  After all, McCain considers this program to be a <a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/203378.php">disgrace</a>.  As a Democrat, I’d love this Republican position to get a lot more air time with the mainstream media.</p>
