<p>Below I ask why the argument that the stimulus must crowd out private spending because output can&#8217;t be higher than aggregate supply hasn&#8217;t been made (or made more often if I missed it).  So now I will try to make that argument.  One rule is that I must concede that there are unemployed workers and idle capacity and, in particular, that there are more unemployed workers and idle capacity than before.  Second, I must assume that we are in a liquidity trap.  I was working on an argument, but Nick Rowe, in comments, suggested that this is really simple.  After the jump I give my effort at an argument then reply to Nick Rowe&#8217;s comment.</p>
<p>OK how can there be increased involuntary unemployment and a liquidity trap yet fiscal stimulus has no effect on output.  I will start with models of involuntary unemployment.  Some such models are based on nominal rigidities.  We know that in these models the stimulus will cause increased output.  </p>
<p>How about efficiency wage models ? Well start with the best known such model the moral hazard model.  In the model workers are tempted to shirk (pretend to work, work carelessly or pilfer) and firms can&#8217;t monitor them perfectly.  This means that the cost of being caught shirking and fired must be positive.  This can only happen if workers wages are above their reservation wage.  In the work/shirk model unemployment is not only possible, it is necessary to make the workers work.<br />the no shirking incentive compatibility condition gives a relationship between the real wage, the average disutility of working an hour (hours per worker are constant in the oldest model) and the unemployment rate.  High unemployment makes it costly to lose a job.  A high real gain per year of having a job makes it costly to lose a job.  Consider the unemployment rate required for a given real wage.  It increases if there is a high rate of layoffs, job separations for reasons other than being caught shirking.</p>
<p>The financial crisis has increased the probability of layoffs.  This could, in theory, happen with a financial crisis even if aggregate demand isn&#8217;t a problem (which can be solved by a stimulus plan).  The reason is that banks can&#8217;t tide firms over periods of poor cash flow (due to idiosyncratic shocks not aggregate demand) because the banks are broke.  So there is a much higher risk that firms will go bankrupt or be forced to shut down production and liquidate inventories.  </p>
<p>In the model this means a higher unemployment rate is needed for given real wages.</p>
<p>In the oldest (Shapiro Stiglitz) model employment is a standard function of real wages.  So far reduced employment requires a higher real wage which isn&#8217;t noticeable in the data so far.  With the financial crisis added in, employment is lower for a given real wage as firms are trying to liquidate inventories and replace them with inventories of cash (to replace lines of credit etc at banks that might fail any second).   The result is an ambiguous impact on the real wage and reduced employment.</p>
<p>In the model this can happen even if, for example, investment is automatically and magically aggregate supply minus consumption minus government consumption minus net exports.  Thus it can happen even if there is no problem with aggregate demand.</p>
<p>Aggregate supply in the model depends on, among other things, the exogenous separation rate.  One can solve out for the real wage, the unemployment rate and GNP as a function of tastes, technology and, in the extended model, the balance sheets of banks.</p>
<p>It has nothing to do with the price level (no nominal rigidities).  This means that for all existing models of aggregate demand there will have to be 100% crowding out.  It has to happen somehow.  </p>
<p>So, I think, it can be done.  The model would require absurd parameters to fit the data, but it is a standard model.  It happens to be one of the very many models which are anathema to fresh water economists.</p>
<p>OK now Nick Rowe.  He pointed out below that modern DSGE models have imperfect competition in labor and product markets, so markets don&#8217;t clear.  I&#8217;d say it is still implied that firms won&#8217;t sell any more at given prices (increased demand will cause them to increase their price for given wages and other prices) and workers won&#8217;t work more (perhaps they&#8217;d each like to but are restrained by unions which uhm you know Nick represent 5% of private sector workers in the USA).  So the crazy market clearing claim that firms won&#8217;t sell more and workers won&#8217;t work more at current wages and prices still hold.  Firms would sell more at current prices *if* demand increased and there were price controls so they couldn&#8217;t hope to raise their prices.  So I&#8217;m not sure how plausible a DSGE model with imperfect competition but no nominal rigidities is.  I mean it has firms setting higher relative prices if they increase output and that sounds a lot like refusing to meet demand at the current price.</p>
<p>I also don&#8217;t see how you can fit the pattern of consumption (down) and hours worked (down) without a sharp decline in the real wage (not in the data) unless leisure is an inferior good (so people work more hours after winning the lottery).  With perfect competition, this is a statement about a simple first order condition.  With imperfect competition in labor markets and fixed markups of wages on the marginal disutility of labor ditto.  Why would that markup increase ?  Now this is a claim that  DSGE models with or without perfect competition sure don&#8217;t fit the data.  It is an old claim (I heard Greg Mankiw argue it in the 80s).  I haven&#8217;t heard a convincing counter argument.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Robert Waldmann</p>
<p>is still wondering why eminent economists have been making such implausible arguments.</p>
<p>Eugene Fama&#8217;s mad predictions based on an accounting identity (and forgetting that the value of goods which firms produce but can&#8217;t sell is counted as inventory investment). Then Eugene Fama asserted that the velocity of available funds or something is constant.</p>
<p>John Cochrane made the same constant velocity argument.</p>
<p>William Poole asserted that if there is Ricardian equivalence, then government spending must crowd out consumption.</p>
<p>The odd thing is that these are all demand side arguments &#8212; all arguments that the stimulus plan will not cause increased aggregate demand.</p>
<p>Historically the fresh water school focused on aggregate supply.  In particular their natural argument is that output can not be greater than aggregate supply and the stimulus won&#8217;t affect aggregate supply.  As far as I know no one is making this argument against the stimulus.  If I&#8217;m right about that, why not ? </p>
<p>My attempt to answer after the jump</p>
<p>First is anyone making the argument ? Itis Greg Mankiw&#8217;s very charitable interpretation of Fama&#8217;s argument (an interpretation which is clearly inconsistent with the text of Fama&#8217;s argument). But Greg Mankiw doesn&#8217;t say he agrees with the view that he ascribes to Fama.</p>
<p>It is odd that no one is making the argument.  It has two steps.  First some dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models, employment is equal to labor supply.  Workers will not work more unless there is a higher real wage or a higher real interest rate.  On the other hand firms are unwilling to produce and sell any more unless there is a lower real wage or a lower interest rate. Under standard assumptions there is no way you can both convince more workers to work and firms to hire more of them &#8212; ever.</p>
<p>Now note I said some DSGE models.  There are DSGE models of all sorts.  However, models with the properties described in the paragraph above have been taken very seriously for decades by macro-economists.</p>
<p>So why doesn&#8217;t one of them make the argument ?</p>
<p>I think it is because, while it may be a bit embarrassing to derive predictions from an identity or assert that the velocity of money is constant when it is rapidly falling, it would be crazy to tell policy makers or the public that there are no workers willing and able to work at current wages and prices (for example at the wage they had last month before they were laid off) or to tell them that firms are unwilling to fill any more orders at current wages and prices and that if the government demands more from them they will turn private sector buyers away empty handed.</p>
<p>That is the assumptions which are often made in macroeconomics (for example by Robert Waldmann) have to be kept secret.  If the public found out that our research involves such assumptions they would cut off the little research funding we have.</p>
<p>Now it could be that general equilibrium arguments aren&#8217;t made because economists fear that the public and policy makers wouldn&#8217;t understand them.  To me they have always seemed fairly simple and the problem is that the public and policy makers would consider them absurd.</p>
<p>The really implausible economic arguments are those to be found, here</p>
<p>Alessandra Pelloni and Robert Waldmann (1998) &#8220;Stability Properties of a growth  Model,&#8221; Economics Letters, vol. 61 pp 55-60.</p>
<p>(that&#8217;s a model of how labor supply moves around in response to a sunspot and that is the business cycle)</p>

<p>Some people around the web are suggesting that the desperate times call for desperate measures and say that US should just print money to save the banks &#8212; risk of hyperinflation be damned.  What exactly do they think we have been doing ?</p>
<p>For example Reader .A.M writes to the incredibly smart Matthew Yglesias </p>
<p>&#8220;We should recapitalize the banks with printed money.&#8221;</p>
<p>A.M. ends with a note of concern</p>
<blockquote><p>Would this work or would it immediately cause a Weimar-republic-style hyperinflation? I ask you because you:</p>
<p>    &#8211; like to think about these types of things<br />    &#8211; are willing to consider crazy ideas just for the sake of argument<br />    &#8211; have the power to get the attention of actual blogging economists.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.google.it/search?hl=it&#038;q=hyperinflation+%22bank+rescue%22+fiat&#038;btnG=Cerca&#038;meta=">many others have expressed concern about hyperinflation if the Fed pumps up the money supply.</a>  </p>
<p>Crazy proposal ? Wild far out idea ?  What exactly do you think Bernake&#8217;s been doing ?</p>
<p>Accounting after the jump.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d say that except for the sensible proposal to <strike>nationalize</strike> pre privatize, your correspondent is describing current US policy.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s just that it&#8217;s done in two steps. <br />1) Treasury bails out the banks with money obtained by selling Treasury bills notes and bonds.<br />2) the Fed buys these bonds with magic money created out of nothing.</p>
<p>The Fed obligations used to buy Treasury securities in open market operations aren&#8217;t actually printed.  They exist mostly in computer memories.  However, they are high powered money. Really just like million dollar bills as far as anyone knows ,in any case assumed by economists to be just like cash and freely exchangeable for cash at will.  You will notice the money say &#8220;Federal Reserve Note&#8221; in big letters above The United States of America.  It means that the bill amounts to the Fed owing you &#8230; something somehow (it used to mean they owed you gold).</p>
<p>So we have been printing money like crazy, faster than a speeding printing press actually.</p>
<p>The amount of money that has been printed is, for serious purposes, total liabilities of the Federal Reserve, which are equal to total assets of the Federal Reserve.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h41/Current/">As of February 26 these were</a> 1,952,216 million dollars, that is about 2 trillion.  Of total assets, the Fed has  11,041 million in gold.  It is possible that some of the Fed&#8217;s foreign currency holdings are old convertible (for all I know some country is still on the gold standard).  Rather less than the over 68 billion in &#8220;mortgage backed seccurities&#8221; or the over 38 billion in &#8220;Credit Extended to American International Group Inc&#8221; (that is in addition to money put in by the Treasury).</p>
<p>In contrast on <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h41/20070215/">Feb 15 2007</a> total assets (and liabilities) were<br />890,690 million so in the past 2 years the Fed has electronically printed up 1 trillion 260 odd billion dollars more than doubling the high powered dollar supply.  You can pick your own data here http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h41/ .</p>
<p>That hasn&#8217;t been enough to cause a hyperinflation or rejection of dollar denominated assets.  It hasn&#8217;t been enough to keep interest rates on Treasury securities consistently above zero or make sure that we have any inflation at all.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure there has been a larger expansion in money supply in world history (in real value).  I&#8217;m pretty sure that, without wanting to, the Fed has obtained more seignorage that the German central bank ever obtained during the hyperinflation (oh hell or in it&#8217;s history).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20126984.000-obama-goes-all-in-for-science.html" target="_blank">New Scientist</a> has some kind words for the Obama science budget:<br />
<blockquote>
<p>Both [the budget and the stimulus package] are packed with funding for science and technology ventures, from healthcare research to an electricity supergrid. The stimulus alone hands out more than $20 billion for basic research and about $50 billion to support renewable power and energy efficiency. </p>
<p>The stimulus bill calls for the funds to be spent in two years, though in some areas it may take longer. In terms of dollars per year, it is arguably the most cash that has ever been pumped into scientific research. Even the Apollo programme and the Manhattan project &#8211; which cost over $200 billion and $35 billion at today&#8217;s value &#8211; were spread over 11 and five years, respectively</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_hcwm-NIIKbE/Sa7UiKtN0JI/AAAAAAAAAEY/Mf2iDz8kj38/s1600-h/Obama+Science+Budget.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_hcwm-NIIKbE/Sa7UiKtN0JI/AAAAAAAAAEY/Mf2iDz8kj38/s400/Obama+Science+Budget.jpg" border="0"></a><br />
<blockquote>
<p>Yet in the light of US budget plans for 2010, it is clear that Obama&#8217;s goal is about more than giving the economy a kick-start by spending on scientists&#8217; salaries and test tubes. In the detail of the stimulus are key components of a wider agenda, aspects of which might have triggered a fight if they had not been hurried through. </p>
<p>Take healthcare: the stimulus includes $1.1 billion for research into the comparative effectiveness of treatments. This is a bold move, given the powerful organisations that profit from the status quo, such as big pharma. </p>
<p>The quickest change to emissions will come from funding for energy efficiency measures, such as money to improve federal buildings. Based on the impact of previous spending, the measures should produce cumulative savings of 200 million tonnes of carbon dioxide, says the Alliance to Save Energy, a lobby group based in Washington DC. Overall emissions have increased by an average of 70 million tonnes per year over the last 15 years. </p>
<p>Other elements of the stimulus bill will save further emissions. The hybrid scheme, for example, hands a $7500 tax rebate to purchasers of plug-in vehicles. The funding will put around 270,000 plug-in hybrid vehicles on the road over 10 years, which could save another 10 million tonnes of carbon dioxide over the lifetime of those vehicles, says Simon Mui of the Natural Resources Defense Council in San Francisco.<br />The stimulus package and budget for 2010 also include windfalls for the main agencies that fund basic research. Officials are scrambling to work out how to spend their allocations effectively. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are, of course, difficulties: Can that amount of money be absorbed that quickly and wisely? As example, consider the following:<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;It is like going from starvation to a banquet,&#8221; says George Sterzinger of the Renewable Energy Policy Project, a think tank based in Washington DC. However, unpleasant side effects may result from all this gorging, he says. If turbine manufacturers with limited stock put up their prices to meet extra demand, then the price of electricity from wind could rise to twice that of coal.</p></blockquote>
<p>There are always unintended side effects.</p>
</p>
<p>Regardless, I would rather reinvigorate science&#8211;even if it hurts the pharmaceutical interests and their investors&#8211;than see it poured into the black bank hole created by the financial engineers. </p>
<p>You will hear much carping about the some of the directions the budget is taking. </p>
<p>Kramer of Mad Money, for example, was apoplectic over the damage being done to the pharmaceutical companies: Bad for investors in those companies. </p>
<p>Now, if you want a quicker and longer stiffy, then the pharmaceuticals are the place to go. Corporate profits drive corporate interests. That drug is best that can be sold to the most people. Such is the myopia of the free market. </p>
<p>There is a place in the U.S. for both the free market and directed research via public investment. (In the same vein I would have both private banks and one conservative national bank—the tension between the two might be productive.) </p>
<p>I wish, however, that we did not have to go from famine to feast so quickly. If we had a bit more vision, we would have had all this well under way a long time ago.</p>

<p>In a world where we actually had our priorities straight we wouldn&#8217;t even be talking about Social Security. The country, the world is sick with fear about our jobs, about keeping our houses, about the plunging values in our 401ks. The LAST thing we need is the Peter G. Petersons fear-mongering Social Security. Why do they do it anyway? Well that is a topic for comments, what this post proposes to do is to supply people with the necessary weapons to beat these people back so that we can address the real world problems.</p>
<p>Discussion of Social Security should but mostly doesn&#8217;t start with the annual <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/index.html">Reports of the Trustees</a>. Each year since 1941 the Trustees have released a detailed report on the financial status of Social Security and all of them are available in a variety of formats. Yet hardly anyone seems to have read them. Why? Because they are long and boring and chock full of numbers. Moreover there are mine fields along the way. Because between the professionals who generate the numbers and the Congress to whom they are officially directed are situated the six Trustees. To the extent that people know the Trustees exist they tend to believe they are apolitical technocrats. Au contraire mon frere, instead they are all Presidential appointees including three cabinet secretaries and all typically committed to advancing the President&#8217;s agenda. Which for the last eight years has been privatization. The consequence has been that the shorter versions of the Reports: the Status Report, the Summary and the Press Release are subtly infused with ideological spin. So before just diving in most people would benefit from getting some instruction from the dive masters. Names and directions under the fold.</p>
<p>These days Dean Baker is probably best known for his role in calling the Housing Bubble early and often, most recently from his perch at his TAP blog <a target="_blank" href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/beat_the_press">Beat the Press</a> where on a daily basis he excoriates the coverage of the MSM on all things economic. (The WaPo coming in for some really serious beat downs). But before his gig at BTP he was known as the chief promoter of the claim that opponents of Social Security were really not being animated by a desire to &#8216;fix&#8217; a system in &#8216;crisis&#8217; but instead on dismantling it. With colleauge Mark Weisbrot he published in 1999 <a target="_blank" href="http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/035468.html">Social Security: the Phony Crisis</a> Excerpts from the Introduction are available at the link but the first few paragraphs are worth copying here:<br />
<blockquote>We have a chance, said President Clinton, to “fix the roof while the sun is still shining.” He was talking about dealing with Social Security immediately, while the economy is growing and the federal budget is balanced. The audience was a regional conference on Social Security, in Kansas City, Missouri, that the White House had helped bring together.</p>
<p>The roof analogy is illuminating, but we can make it more accurate. Imagine that it’s not going to rain for more than 30 years. And the rain, when it does arrive (and it might not), will be pretty light. And imagine that the average household will have a lot more income for roof repair by the time the rain approaches.</p>
<p>Now add this: most of the people who say they want to fix the roof actually want to knock holes in it.</p></blockquote>
<p> And probably the most prominent of those fixers (and already called out by name by Dean and Mark in 1999) is Peter G. Peterson, founder and more importantly funder of the Concord Coalition and the Peter G Peterson Foundation. Now Concord bills it self as follows:<br />
<blockquote>The Concord Coalition is dedicated to educating the public about the causes and consequences of federal budget deficits, the long-term challenges facing America&#8217;s unsustainable entitlement programs, and how to build a sound economy for future generations.</p></blockquote>
<p> But as the quote suggests they tend to strongly draw a line between &#8217;causes&#8217; of &#8216;federal budget deficits&#8217; and &#8216;unsustainable entitlement programs&#8217;. Other parts of the deficit crisis are alluded to in passing, but generally their discussion starts and stops with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.concordcoalition.org/learn/entitlements/entitlements">Entitlements</a>, a word that Concord may not have coined but has certainly promulgated. Most recently Concord and the PGP Foundation have been publically pushing their <a target="_blank" href="http://www.concordcoalition.org/act/fiscal-wake-tour">Fiscal Wake-up Tour</a> itself covered in documentary form with the movie <a target="_blank" href="http://www.concordcoalition.org/iousa/iousa-movie">I.O.U.S.A.</a>. While this movie was recently shown on CNN without much editorial comment it is not a neutral statement at all. Instead it is more of an infomercial designed to sell Social Security &#8216;crisis&#8217;.</p>
<p>Okay having established that Dean is the champion of Social Security and Pete G. Peterson is the adversary, where do you go to fill out your knowledge? Well you could stay close to home and read the essays put up by Dale Coberly here at AB <a target="_blank" href="http://bruceweb.blogspot.com/2009/02/coberly-on-social-security-at-angry.html">Coberly on Social Security</a> or by me <a target="_blank" href="http://bruceweb.blogspot.com/2008/08/angry-bear-social-security-series.html">Angry Bear Social Security Series</a> perhaps starting with <a target="_blank" href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/02/social-security-simple-story-vs-myth.html">Social Security: Simple Story vs. Myth Busting</a> but I would suggest making a first stop at Lee A. Arnold&#8217;s animation <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tts2uTWt6e8">Social Security: a Polemic (in Ecolanguage)</a></p>
<p>At this point you would be prepared to go into the Reports themselves. You would want to first read the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/trTOC.html">Overview</a> keeping in mind that it is in part a political document and then jump into the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/trLOT.html">List of Tables</a> and the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/trLOF.html">List of Figures</a>. In toto this is a little of an information overload, to start with you need to look at the following:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/VI_cyoper_history.html#159726">Table VI.A4.—Historical Operations of the Combined OASI and DI Trust Funds, Calendar Years 1957-2007 [Amounts in billions]</a>. This tells you where Social Security has actually been. (Note in particular how small the balances were under Johnson and Reagan, the notion that the former used Social Security to fund the Great Society or that the latter raided it to pay for tax cuts are in numeric context ridiculous, there just wasn&#8217;t that much money there.)<br />Now you can check out where Social Security is projected to go under the three alternatives: Low Cost, Intermediate Cost, and High Cost <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/VI_OASDHI_dollars.html#150920">Table VI.F8.—Operations of the Combined OASI and DI Trust Funds, in Current Dollars, Calendar Years 2008-85 [In billions]</a>. (Note that Low Cost has Social Security fully funded and even overfunded going forwards.)<br />To get some idea about which alternative is most probable you can look at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/V_economic.html#188118">Table V.B1: Principal Economic Assumptions</a> &#038;<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/V_economic.html#200328">Table V.B2: Additional Economic Factors</a> keeping in mind that the most important numbers are &#8216;Ultimate&#8217; ones, where the Reports see the economy settling out over the long run.<br />To see how realistic the demographic assumptions are you would look at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/V_demographic.html#205410">Table V.A1.—Principal Demographic Assumptions, Calendar Years 1940-2085</a></p>
<p>So after reading Dean and watching Lee and dabbling in the offerings put up by Dale and me and examining the numbers in the above five tables you would be better armed than the vast majority of people out there who purport to know something about Social Security. And you would be in pretty good shape to make a claim about which of the following outcomes is in fact more probable. (Alternative II is Intermediate Cost, and the only one ever talked about in the media. It shows the standard story of Trust Fund peaking in the early 2020s and declining to zero in 2041. But if we end up with anything close to Alternative I which is Low Cost we will be having a whole different discussion going forwards.)</p>

                                <p>by Tom Bozzo</p>
<p>Much like the largely if not totally hypothetical family farm that might need to be sold off to cruel agribusiness to pay &#8220;death taxes,&#8221; I suspect that trotting out charities as the Real Victims of Obama administration plans to reduce tax expenditures on the wealthy is the latest Luntzian effort to put a plausibly human face on the upward-redistribution beast.  The combination of income- and estate-tax policies makes the net direction of the incentives for tax-deductible giving ambiguous, and a kicker is an observation well-buried in an <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/27/us/27charity.html">NYT article</a> on the subject from last week:<br />
<blockquote>Robert F. Sharpe Jr., a fund-raising expert in Memphis, said many of the wealthiest donors are already limited to deductions of 28 percent for their charitable gifts because they are subject to the alternative minimum tax.</p></blockquote>
<p>A more correct modifier on &#8220;donors&#8221; in this case might be &#8220;wealthier&#8221; as the AMT hits in something of a reverse donut hole pattern, where the highest-income taxpayers tend fall out of the AMT system because they have sufficient tax liabilities at the top statutory rates for the ordinary income tax.</p>
<p>So the vast majority of taxpayers — Obama&#8217;s 95 percent — don&#8217;t make enough money to face more than a 28 percent Federal income tax rate on their last dollar of income.  Of the remaining 5 percent, many pay the AMT and the tax price of their contributions is based on a tax rate no higher than the AMT&#8217;s 28 percent top rate.  So we&#8217;re really talking about the very small slice of the very fortunate who pay the top regular income tax rates and are outside the AMT system: generally, the tip-top of the income distribution and their beneficiaries.</p>
<p>Of course the NYT has a role as a house organ of the upper class (at least the portion for whom the role is not taken by the W$J), but this is an example of what Jonathan Chait very nicely described as the systematic <a href="http://blogs.tnr.com/tnr/blogs/the_plank/archive/2009/03/03/wealthy-idiots-meet-idiot-reporter.aspx">blowing out of proportion</a> of the tax concerns of the very rich.</p>
<p>A little more is below the fold.</p>
<p>The dirty secret of tax-deductible contributions is that it amounts to spending lots of public money on projects that have some combination of  dubious value to secular society and alternative means for public and private funding.  A <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/doc.cfm?index=4012&#038;type=0">now-aged CBO study</a> describes the disposition of tax-deductible contributions, and nobody should be surprised that the biggest beneficiary group is religious institutions.  Religion is dependent on voluntary contributions, but are not so exposed to wealthy individual donors.  Arts, education, health, and social services groups tend to have significant other sources of revenue — tuition, other fees for services, grants.  (Arts groups are notably exposed to corporate donations, and many have been slammed as their benefactors have circled the wagons.)</p>
<p>Now there&#8217;s some <a href="http://www.philanthropy.iupui.edu/workingpapers/brooks%202007%20income%20tax%20policy%20Jrnl%20Policy%20Analysis.pdf">evidence</a> [PDF] out there that the tax-price elasticity of donations is greater (in absolute value) than 1 for some of the major categories of donations, which implies that the tax deduction elicits more donations than the tax cost.  Otherwise, Establishment Clause issues aside, the government could rescind the tax deduction and make the charitable groups whole (at least as a group) through some system of grants.</p>
<p>Even this sort of Hicks-Pareto efficiency doesn&#8217;t establish that the funds are being put to their highest-valued use, though.  A lot of donations make rich institutions richer, and diminishing marginal productivities and utilities would lead you to conclude that those institutions can run out of useful things to spend money on and thus are pushed into activities of dubious social utility like, uhm, making themselves into tax-free hedge funds with educational side projects.  So I&#8217;m in favor of giving a pretty hard look at the tax status of endowments too.</p>

<p>Tax cuts aren&#8217;t the only thing that work great in every situation.  Hoarding gold <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601072&#038;sid=a2sUvQ.vbcWY&#038;refer=energy">works too</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Gold is now regarded as a hedge against both inflation and deflation, says Alan Ruskin, the chief international strategist at Greenwich, Connecticut-based RBS Greenwich Capital Markets Inc. The first is reflected in the high dollar price of bullion, the second by the surge in gold’s price in euros. </p></blockquote>
<p>Having been in the presence of gold at different times, I can attest that it also flies, improves mental health, and eliminates odors from cat poop boxes at twenty paces.   But seriously, what the heck does that second sentence even mean?  </p>
<p>FYI, the &#8220;RBS&#8221; in &#8220;RBS Greenwich Capital Markets Inc.&#8221; stands for Royal Bank of Scotland.  Yes, <a target="_blank" href="http://cbs4denver.com/businesswire/22.0.html?type=national&#038;serviceLevel=f&#038;category=f&#038;filename=EU--Britain-Earns-Roy.xml">that</a> Royal Bank of Scotland.  Now I didn&#8217;t know anything about Alan Ruskin, so I googled him.  It turns out he penned <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gata.org/node/5609">this piece</a> [link fixed- klh] on moral hazard in the Financial Times back in 2007.  </p>
<p>Anyway, there are a lot of places this post could go, and most of &#8217;em all but write themselves.   Have a go at it in comments.  <br />__________________________________<br />by cactus</p>

<p>I have long thought that the nuclear option for the Democrats to crush the Republicans was to reform the tax code so most families pay negative income tax.  </p>
<p>Now I learn that they have very nearly done that.</p>
<p>Via <a href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/ezraklein_archive?month=03&#038;year=2009&#038;base_name=bad_media_good_media#113420">Ezra Klein</a> <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jd7Vs2tjPAplFaABT9kaFRR9a56wD96K64KO0">STEPHEN OHLEMACHER reports for AP</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>WASHINGTON (AP) — A typical American family would get a tax cut under President Barack Obama&#8217;s budget proposal, and their low-income neighbor would fare even better.</p>
<p>Their wealthier counterparts, however, would face some steep tax increases, starting in 2011.</p>
<p>Families making as much as $50,000 would owe no federal income taxes, as long as they have at least two children, according to an analysis by Deloitte Tax LLP. </p>
<p>A typical family of four making $50,000 a year would receive a payment of $40, according to the Deloitte analysis. A similar family making $35,000 a year would get a payment of $4,100, an increase of $1,200. Before the stimulus package was enacted, that same family would have owed $760 in federal income taxes.</p>
<p>The median household income was $50,233 in 2007, according to the Census Bureau.</p></blockquote>
<p>Median family income was lower, since unmarried adults living together are one household but two families.  However the typical voter is part of a family with less than four members.  Still they are getting very close to a negative income tax paying majority.</p>
<p>The founders (and John Stuart Mill) were afraid of tyranny by such a majority.  I think it is just what the country needs.<br />(that should get some comments he mutters)</p>
<p>update: Fox News, yes that Fox News provides more evidence in <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/projects/pdf/030509_Poll.pdf">this pdf</a> (as if it were needed) that the US public is itching for a class war.</p>
<p><a href="http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2009/03/obama-preferred-over-reagan----in-fox-news-poll.php">Commentary by Erik Kleefeld</a></p>
<p>update 2:<br />Some of the Fox news questions were slanted to almost push poll levels.  However, the desire to soak the rich made it through the pollster.</p>
<p>Diageo Hotline also finds strong support for raising taxes on the rich (via dailykos).  </p>
<p>&#8220;There is also strong support for President Obama&#8217;s proposal to raise taxes on the affluent (67%) in 2010&#8221;</p>
<p>I checked the question in the poll included the words &#8220;&#8230;President Obama also proposed raising taxes starting in 2010 on &#8230;&#8221; <a href="http://www.diageohotlinepoll.com/documents/diageohotlinepoll/FDDiageoHotlinePoll_topline03.09.pdf">warning pdf</a>.  Huh ? I thought the increase started in 2011 !?!</p>
<p>The AP reports that the tax increase will start in 2011 <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hZRL86q2rkBSw_2usQlo6UoGItZwD96O097O0">&#8220;It also raises taxes starting in 2011 on households that earn more than $250,000 a year.&#8221;</a></p>
<p>I&#8217;d say the wording of the question contained a false assertion on a matter of fact that grossly pushed respondents towards answering &#8220;no.&#8221;  Diageo Hotline presented the false Republican claim that Obama proposed raising taxes in a recession, at least in the same year he proposed a stimulus. </p>
<p>In spite of that 67% of respondents were in favor.<br />off to google.</p>

<p>Having demonstrated an ability to find amazing patterns in numbers from baseball and polls, Nate Silver turns his attention to the stock market.  </p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2009/03/manic-depressive-market.html">He finds mean reversion in day to day prices since 2000 ! That is evidence of over-reaction and a correction.</a>  Amazing !</p>
<p>more after the jump.</p>
<p>Now Silver knows he is taking a chance talking about the stock market</p>
<p>&#8220;Wading into a discussion about the stock market is dangerous business. In contrast to politics, where there are relatively few people willing to do serious quantitative analysis, there are entire industries full of such geeks in the financial sector.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now I remember the time that my boss and advisor (Larry Summers) asked me if daily changes in S&#038;P 500 closing prices had more mean reversion when the variance of the price was higher.  This would be great evidence that noise traders were causing high volatility.</p>
<p>I thought I found evidence, but there was a problem.  In the late 40s and 50s there were days during which no shares of a given company were traded.  No one bought or sold a share.  Their price is recorded as the price at which they were traded the day before.  This automatically creates a bit of positive correlation in day to day returns.  This &#8220;non traded stock effect&#8221; appears in diluted form in the S&#038;P500.</p>
<p>Now Silver uses the Dow Jones Industrial Average made up of shares which are traded frequently, so, I&#8217;m not sure this is a problem for him.  That is, for all I know, at least one share of every Dow index company was traded every trading day from 1946 on.  Still I worry.</p>
<p>The non traded stock effect suggests that some of the evidence of positive correlation in the past might be spurious.</p>
<p>Silver mixes in data from the extremely low trading volume 40s and 50s with data from the 60s and 70s.  I would drop years before 1960 or look at correlations between the change today and the change the day after tomorrow. So I am not convinced by this part of his post.</p>
<blockquote><p>What&#8217;s interesting, however, is the nature of this correlation has changed over time. From 1946 through 1979, the market posted a gain about 57.7 percent of the time following a gain on the previous day &#8212; but just 45.6 percent of the time following a loss. This suggests that the market was slow to react to new information, with rallies or slumps sometimes taking several days to play out.</p></blockquote>
<p>However, I am convinced by the comparison of the 80s and 90s to the noughties</p>
<blockquote><p>Between 1980 and 1999, he market posted a gain 51.8 percent of the time following a prior day&#8217;s gain, versus 52.7 percent of the time following a loss &#8212; essentially no difference.</p></blockquote>
<p>vs</p>
<blockquote><p>Since then, however, something funny has happened. The market has developed a tendency toward inverse serial correlation; it is more likely to follow a gain with a loss, and vice versa. Since 2000, the market has gained ground just 47.7 percent of the time following a prior day&#8217;s gain &#8212; but 54.2 percent of the time following a loss. !!!!!!</p></blockquote>
<p>(emphasis added).</p>
<p>Damn why didn&#8217;t I see that ?  Oh yeah Summers asked me in 1987.</p>
<p>Bottom line ? Silver is golden.  I think he can step into a crowded competitive field, do some simple calculations which should have been done years ago, and hit it out of the park.</p>

                                <p>Via the <a target="_blank" href="http://chronicle.com/news/article/?id=6063&#038;utm_source=at&#038;utm_medium=en">Chronicle of Higher Education</a> (link may not be public):<br />
<blockquote>The Arkansas legislature is taking a different approach to reining in soaring tuition costs: Today it sent a bill to the governor’s desk that would cap the amount of money public colleges can spend on scholarships.</p>
<p>Increases in scholarship aid lead to higher tuition costs, State Rep. Bill Abernathy, who shepherded the Senate-passed bill through the House of Representatives, told Associated Press. “You almost have the reverse Robin Hood scenario,” said Mr. Abernathy, a Democrat. “You’re taking from the poor and giving it to the rich in some cases.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Will Governor Beebe, whose post-secondary education is <a href="http://www.governor.arkansas.gov/gov_biography.html">entirely in the Arkansas Public system</a>, view this as a way to keep people from having his opportunities, or will he &#8220;make the tough decision&#8221; and decide not to invest in Human Capital?</p>
<p>That <a href="http://www.statestats.com/edrank.htm">#32 ranking</a> and <a href="http://www.nwanews.com/adg/News/213239/">improving educational environment</a> will be interesting to revisit in five years.  Just when the pump has been primed, the water supply is rerouted.</p>
