<blockquote>WASHINGTON (AP) &#8211; Republican leaders are willing to allow the first minimum wage increase in a decade but only if it&#8217;s coupled with a cut in future inheritance taxes on multimillion-dollar estates, congressional aides said Friday. A package GOP leaders planned to bring to a vote Friday or Saturday in the House also would renew several popular tax breaks, including a research and development credit for businesses, and deductions for college tuition and state sales taxes, said a spokesman for House Majority Leader John Boehner. The wage would increase from $5.15 to $7.25 per hour, phased in over the next three years, said Kevin Madden, the aide to Boehner, an Ohio Republican. The maneuver is aimed at defusing the wage hike as a campaign issue for Democrats while using its popularity to spur enactment of the Republican Party&#8217;s long-sought goal of permanently cutting taxes on millionaires&#8217; estates.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let’s be clear about two things.  First, all this proposal would do as far as the minimum wage would be to restore it to something barely above 1997 levels in real terms (see <a href="http://beatthepress.blogspot.com/2006/07/adjust-for-inflation-minimal-demand-on.html">Dean Baker</a>) and far below the 1968 level.  Secondly, these “tax cuts’ are nothing more than tax shifts.  Someone at some point will have to pay down all these deferred tax liabilities.   </p>
<p>The Democratic response is to call for “an up or down vote” (as much as I hate to quote Bill Frist) on the minimum wage proposal.  There is absolutely no excuse for the continued fiscal irresponsibility of this Republican led Federal government – regardless of one’s view on the minimum wage controversy.</p>
<p><a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2006/07/28/minimum-wage-poison-pill">Judd</a> of Think Progress objects to what he calls the Poison Pill of this proposal:</p>
<blockquote><p>Actually, the provision that Rep. McKeon plans on attaching to the minimum wage bill is an ideologically driven proposal to enact Association Health Plans (AHPs). The proposal would “allow selective groups of small  business to be exempt from state regulation – reducing their insurance premiums while raising them for those not in AHPs.” Here’s the impact:</p>
<p>More uninsured. “A study by Mercer Consulting found that AHPs would increase the number of uninsured Americans by more than 1 million. ”</p>
<p>Higher costs. “Only about one in five small employers would have lower premiums, while more than four out of five would actually see premiums go up.”</p>
<p>Rep. McKeon and his allies are counting on the fact that progressive members will find the Association Health Plan proposal so repugnant that they won’t vote for the bill raising the minimum wage. </p></blockquote>
<p>As usual, one needs to read the fine print with proposal from this group of Republicans.</p>
<p>Update: <a href="">Faiz</a> trumps this Bear with a picture of Paris Hilton and one fine commentary!  Darn – that Think Progress crowd is tough to beat.</p>

The slowdown in domestic demand growth was across all sectors with consumption rising by 2.5%, business investment rising by 2.7%, residential investment declining, and government purchases rising by less than 1%.  And I’m listening to CNN, they are saying this is good news as it takes the pressure off the Federal Reserve to further raise interest rates.  Let’s hope growth for the rest of the year is stronger.</p>
<p><strong>Footnote</strong>: In a comment to <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/07/monetary-policy-darda-discovers-that.html">this post</a>, AB reader K Harris reminds us that Michael Darda had made a qualitative statement that investment demand growth would remain strong.  She asks what was his Q2 forecast?  Michael?</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=ODFkZTRjNzVmODNiMGIzNmUzZWVjODE2MzA4YWU5ZWY=">Thomas Nugent</a> really wanted to run a Laffer curve op-ed today chastising Democrats for ignoring “JFK economics”.  Did he ignore today’s BEA news or just misread the report? <br />
<blockquote>the economy hit a 4.6 percent annual growth rate in the second quarter of 2006</p></blockquote>
<p>Could someone tell Mr. Nugent that nominal GDP growth is not the same as real GDP growth?!</p>

                                <p>About a year ago, <a href="http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2005/07/a14e23f2-ad84-4c90-b7eb-d66bca2f7f66.html">Jeremy Bransten</a> noted:<br />
<blockquote>Russia’s roads &#8211; with a few notable exceptions &#8211; are abysmal. Levitin put the reason down to a combination of corruption and inefficient spending &#8230; For the future, the state also plans to build a network of new toll roads to ease congestion and ensure revenue for their upkeep. Moscow region governor Boris Gromov tells RFE/RL plans are under way for a toll road linking Moscow to St. Petersburg. &#8220;The first stage will run from the Moscow Ring Road to Sheremetyevo-1 and Sheremetyevo-2 [airports] and then this toll road will continue to St. Petersburg,&#8221; Gromov says.</p></blockquote>
<p>The <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,13509-2285527,00.html">recent news</a> is that:<br />
<blockquote>MOSCOW’S new-found prosperity has brought with it a familiar problem: traffic jams. Now Europe’s largest city, which is clogged by 3 million cars, is to get a new ring road to ease congestion with one of post-Soviet Russia’s biggest infrastructure projects. Construction of the 276-mile (444km) motorway is expected to begin next year. It will cost about $10 billion (£5.4 billion). Authorities hope that the road will divert freight traffic away from the city, which is expected to absorb another 100,000 cars this year as increasingly affluent residents take to the roads. The project is part of a campaign to use some of Russia’s oil wealth to improve its notoriously poor road network. Russian authorities are also planning to build a toll road from Moscow to the country’s second city, St Petersburg. But even before winning final approval, the ring road is stirring controversy, not least among hundreds of dacha owners along the proposed route, about 20-30 miles outside Moscow. Residents of Ramensky district say that at least 500 dachas will have to be razed to make way for the road.</p></blockquote>
<p>Dacha is Russian for a house in the countryside.  It’s interesting that the construction of roads raises the same property right concerns in Russia that often delay road construction in the U.S.  Now the fact that oil wealth might be paying for the new roads is interesting given the controversies surrounding the management of Yukos Oil and how the Russian government seized some of its key assets and sold them to the state oil group Rosneft.  Which makes the news from the <a href="http://www.moscowtimes.ru/stories/2006/07/25/002.html">Moscow Times</a> interesting:<br />
<blockquote>The company report puts the cost at 262.9 billion rubles ($9.7 billion). The region is expected to provide from 25 percent to 50 percent of investment in cash or land for the construction. Private companies are expected to invest the rest in exchange for the right to collect toll fees.</p></blockquote>
<p>Privatization of formerly owned state assets is not something that has worked all that well under the crony capitalism of Russia.</p>

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Whenever I read <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=MmYxNjcxNmFjMzA1NjJhYTM3NGI2ZjMyNDNiN2ZlMjc=">Michael Darda</a>, I have to wonder what his point is:<br />
<blockquote>Standing in stark contrast, however, are several important market and economic indicators that suggest the Fed remains accommodative: near record commodity prices, relatively low real short-term interest rates, rising monetary velocity, tight credit spreads, and robust growth in business loans.</p></blockquote>
<p>Actually, real interest rates had risen from less than 1.7% last June to over 2.5% this June as measured by the <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h15/data/Monthly/H15_TCMII_Y10.txt">10-year TIPS</a> rate.   While Darda decides to stage some Marx v. Schumpeter debate, the resident Keynesian at the National Review would only have to turn to the old fashion IS-LM model to explain his parade of facts.  Consider a mix of expansionary fiscal policy (outward shift of the IS curve) and tight monetary policy.  Wouldn’t one expect the increase in interest rates to increase GDP relative to the money supply (aka velocity) to increase?  </p>
<p>But then we get this:<br />
<blockquote>I continue to expect the industrial economy (which expanded 6.6 percent at an annual rate during the second quarter) and non-residential investment spending to continue to advance at a robust pace.</p></blockquote>
<p>I hope investment remains high, but this mix of expansionary fiscal policy with an offsetting monetary policy is not encouraging more investment – regardless of all the National Review spin to the contrary.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p><a href="http://time.blogs.com/daily_dish/2006/07/an_inconvenient.html">Sulli</a> decided to watch <em>An Inconvenient Truth</em>, which prompted this:<br />
<blockquote>It&#8217;s thoroughly persuasive about the reality of global warming and the contribution of carbon dioxide emissions to it. I&#8217;d recommend it strongly to anyone.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.thepoorman.net/2006/07/26/your-professional-pundit-class-in-action">The Poorman</a> unloaded on Sulli with:<br />
<blockquote>Three weeks ago, the evidence for global warming was akin to Dick Cheney’s case for Iraq’s WMD &#8211; but now, having seen a fucking Hollywood movie about global warming starring famous former VP Al Gore, well, he finds the science persuasive. I’m very pleased, and I hope this change of heart lasts until Dan Quayle comes out with a movie about how the Earth’s not really getting warmer, it’s just that we’re all getting cooler.</p></blockquote>
<p>But let’s give the slow learner known as Andrew Sullivan a little credit for finally getting the point as he also decides to play policy wonk:<br />
<blockquote>It&#8217;s also striking that Gore could have used the movie to argue for a serious increase in the gas tax &#8211; and he didn&#8217;t.</p></blockquote>
<p>Vice President Gore never advocated addressing global warming?  <a href="http://ezraklein.typepad.com/blog/2006/07/the_amnesia_it_.html">Nicholas Beaudrot</a> remembers the Clinton years a bit differently and adds this political reality:<br />
<blockquote>But the reality-based community also includes political reality, so until some Senate Republican(s)s step up to the plate on carbon taxes or fuel economy, and we can hammer out a compromise solution that includes &#8230; I don&#8217;t know, subsidies to clean coal? Massive wind-power projects across various Republican-held Congressional Districts? A &#8220;feebate&#8221; system for improving fuel economy? &#8230;  policy engagement on global warming is a real suckers&#8217; move.</p></blockquote>
<p>All Sulli bashing aside – I only wish more Republicans wake up to the reality of global warming and show some leadership on this issue.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2006/07/27/leaked-memo-global-warming">Judd</a> of Think Progress may be able to explain why Andrew Sullivan et al. where such slow learners on global warming:<br />
<blockquote>A secret memo by the coal industry details a coordinated campaign to spread misinformation about global warming. The memo, written by an association of coal-based utilities in Colorado, expresses fear that if the government address climate change &#8211; through a carbon tax or regulating greenhouse gasses &#8211; it will cut into their profits. Their solution: “support the scientific community that is willing to stand up against the alarmists”.  (”Alarmists” is the word they use to describe people who believe in global warming science. The memo also refers to this group as those “whose true motivation is to stop growth, develop renewable resources [and] discontinue the use of fossil fuels, especially coal.”) But the coal utilities ran up against a problem: their is no scientific community who agrees with them. The memo acknowledges most people who dispute global warming have no “involvement in climatology.”</p></blockquote>
<p>An age old story – some special interest with enough money on the table goes out and hires a bunch of hacks to spread their spin, and folks like Andrew Sullivan eat up this spin as if it were the gospel truth.  Speaking of hacks – the <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=OTliNzc0M2Q1NzQ5NjQ3Yzc4MzRkMWY5Nzg1Yzc4ZmI=">Corner Kids</a> may be doing their own Sulli bashing but they are ducking Sulli’s discovery that Global Warming exists.  Go figure!</p>

                                <p>As our readers surely have noticed, Kash is posting less frequently of late (though he did make <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/07/hard-v-soft-landing-debate.html">a recent appearance</a>). And I, unfortunately, have had no time to blog in a long time. While I hope that will change at some point, it probably won&#8217;t be soon.</p>
<p>PGL is doing a great job covering for us both, providing interesting posts on a daily basis. That said, my opinion has long been that several bloggers are better than one. This is true based on both the volume and variety of content. And I think that PGL and Kash agree. As a result, we&#8217;re looking to add one or two regular contributors to the blog.</p>
<p>A Ph.D. in Economics or closely related field would be helpful, but it&#8217;s not required (e.g., a graduate student might do well as a blogger, though I&#8217;m not sure I can in good conscience advise a student to spend time blogging instead of working on her thesis).</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no political litmus test, either. But for the sake of overall coherency, it would help if you were not too far right or left of the median post here at Angry Bear.</p>

<blockquote>Opponents of global poverty have reason to celebrate. The recent approval by the US Food and Drug Administration of a new, once-a-day pill against Aids could revolutionise health in developing countries. The news follows approval earlier this year of a cervical cancer vaccine, which may save more than 200,000 lives each year in poor nations. In the US, these breakthroughs have coincided with unprecedented political support for the funding that pays for such medicines. Last year the House of Representatives passed its foreign aid bill with 393 votes, the highest tally in more than two decades. Over the past six years, the US has increased six-fold the money it spends to fight scourges such as Aids and tuberculosis abroad.</p></blockquote>
<p>Kolbe’s good news is life science companies have made some breakthroughs in how we treat aid – followed by a statement that our generous Congress has decided to partially offset some of the monopoly profits that Big Pharma makes on these breakthroughs.</p>
<p>What seems to have Mark objecting to Kolbe’s argument is the following:<br />
<blockquote>But the heights America has reached in such spending may represent the peak of foreign aid, leaving only a hard fall ahead. As the baby-boomer generation ages and begins to draw on Social Security and Medicare, the healthcare system for the over-65s, the funding needs for those programmes will skyrocket. Something else in the budget will have to make way – and America’s foreign aid programme is one of the likeliest candidates for cuts.</p></blockquote>
<p>Good grief – we spend $27 billion on foreign aid as we have been running a General Fund deficit near $600 billion per year.  That $27 billion is tiny compared to the fact that world population is over 6 billion.  Wow &#8211; $4.50 per person per year is not exactly going to solve world poverty.  As far as Social Security benefits, let’s remember that the Social Security Trust Fund is running a surplus that will allow it to have enough reserves to cover benefits through around 2050.  Yes, it was a combination those Bush tax cuts, K-Street driven pork barrel spending, and an expensive and reckless adventure into Iraq (which has something to do with all that current anger in the Arab streets at U.S. foreign policy as we make a mockery out of Lebanon) that is driving the massive General Fund deficits.  As Mark rightly puts it:<br />
<blockquote>setting world poverty versus &#8220;financing the lifestyles of retired Americans&#8221; is a false and misleading tradeoff designed to achieve the political goal of reducing the size of government &#8230; We can handle the current 20 -30 billion we spend on foreign aid going forward.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.opinionjournal.com/editorial/feature.html?id=110008690">Tunku Varadarajan</a> interviews two economists in love.  I once met the delightful couple &#8211; Milton and Rose Friedman – some 20 years ago and was very impressed.  I had met their non-economist son at dinner a year earlier and he learned economics from two masters.  So I enjoyed this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Maladies behind us, we moved to economics, and here I made a reflexive apology for not being an economist myself. &#8220;You mean you&#8217;re not a trained economist,&#8221; was Mr. Friedman&#8217;s comeback. &#8220;I have found, over a long time, that some people are natural economists. They don&#8217;t take a course, but they understand &#8211; the principles seem obvious to them. Other people may have Ph.D.s in economics, but they&#8217;re not economists. They don&#8217;t think like an economist. Strange, but true.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>When Dr. Friedman discussed the role of government intervention, he was rightfully noting that it’s more than just capturing government expenditure to GDP. But then he tries to tell us government spending has doubled – not distinguishing between government purchases versus transfer payments: </p>
<blockquote><p>Here, Mr. Friedman explains &#8220;the story of the postwar period&#8221; in the U.S. &#8220;In 1945-46, intellectual opinion was almost entirely collectivist. But practice was free market. Government was spending something like 20%-25% of national income. But the ideas of people were all for more government. And so from 1945 to 1980 you had a period of galloping socialism. Government started expanding and expanding and expanding.&#8221; Mr. Friedman stopped, as if deciding whether to use the word &#8220;expanding&#8221; a fourth time, before continuing: &#8220;And government spending went from 20% to 40% of national income.</p></blockquote>
<p>As our graph shows, government purchases as a share of GDP have not gone up.  Yes government expenditure was 31% of GDP (not 40%) but the increase from the late 1940’s is mostly an increase in Social Security benefits – which Dr. Friedman labels the “welfare state”.  And it is true that government spending to help citizens pay for their health care is expected to rise – especially given President Bush’s inability to even consider efficiency improving health care policies.  But I have to protest that an able economist like Milton Friedman has carelessly dusted off rightwing spin numbers on the size of the government in what otherwise could have been an interesting interview.  </p>

                                <p>The latest on the privatized Skyway toll road is provided by <a href="http://bureaucrash.com/taxonomy_menu/20/85?from=30">InkyAtari</a> who insists that this story is “Proof that the private sector does things better!”:</p>
<blockquote><p>Skyway doing well under concession &#8211; traffic up 18%, revenues up 35% &#8230; Toll collectors were paid over $20/hour by the City versus $12/hr now.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, profits are up for two reasons: (a) the owners are extracting consumer surplus from motorists; and (b) labor costs are down not because the owners have economized on the number of workers but because they have lowered their pay.  Not exactly the typical definition of efficiency.  </p>
<p>AB readers – remind me of which of our trolls InkyAtari sounds like.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: I have a confession.  Our favorite <a href="http://flyunderthebridge.blogspot.com/2006/07/now-about-your-expenses.html">troll</a> blogged on this story first and I wanted to give him a chance to post a comment here before I gave him credit.  I only discovered that other blog because the link to tollroadsnews was not working.  But notice Roland Patrick (aka Patrick R. Sullivan) missed the real story only noting the following:<br />
<blockquote>Interest expense on the $ 1.8 billion up front lease payment being well over $100 million dollars (we would surmise) they&#8217;ll need every economy they can find to make this a wise investment.</p></blockquote>
<p>To which anyone who understands finance goes “HUH”.  He is assuming a 5.5% interest rate but even long-term nominal interest rates are only 5% with real interest rates being only half of that.  It is expected future cash flows that matter not current cash flows and one would expect toll revenues and profits to at least keep pace with the general price-level.  So let’s see – the real interest cost on $1.8 billion is only $45 million – not $100 million.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p><a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2006/07/department_of_h.html">Brad DeLong</a> is puzzled by a suggestion coming from <a href="http://macroblog.typepad.com/macroblog/2006/07/the_chairman_sp.html">David Altig</a> and <a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2006/07/measuring-wages.html">Greg Mankiw</a>. </p>
<p>David opened with:<br />
<blockquote>If I had my way, appeals to the BLS average hourly earnings series would be banished from commentary about wages and the fortunes of the workers &#8211; unless the commentator explains why that measure is a truer measure of labor compensation than those that include in-kind payments to employees (that is, benefits).</p></blockquote>
<p>Greg followed with:<br />
<blockquote>I am always surprised when I see economists compare wages and productivity using wage measures that exclude fringe benefits. Theory says that productivity should determine total compensation, not cash earnings.</p></blockquote>
<p>Brad goes “huh” with the detail being:<br />
<blockquote>I thought that everybody knew that wages and salaries were only one component &#8211; albeit the largest component &#8211; of total compensation. But I also thought that everybody knew that (except at the very top end) differences between growth rates of wages and salaries and growth rates of real compensation were relatively small. We have pretty good data on short-run and medium-run movements in average hourly wages and median usual weekly earnings. We have pretty bad data on benefits. We know that average total compensation grows about 0.4% per year faster than average wages and salaries, and that the gap is smaller &#8211; 0.2%? &#8211; at the median. Yes, it would be very nice, it would be better to have median weekly real compensation. But we don&#8217;t. So why not use what we have got?</p></blockquote>
<p>Kash (who has returned to AB blogging) might be happy to see that Greg’s update had to deal with this:<br />
<blockquote>Part of the explanation for this increase is the rising cost of health care. The value of employer-provided health insurance is a key part of many workers&#8217; compensation. It is a benefit that gets more valuable as improvements in medical technology drive up the cost of insurance.</p></blockquote>
<p>But this was not <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/06/is-compensation-finally-catching-up.html">Kash’s argument</a>, which <a href="http://macroblog.typepad.com/macroblog/2006/07/what_does_labor.html">David</a> later captured:<br />
<blockquote>Not surprisingly, I received several comments arguing that increases in labor compensation have, in the recent past, been driven by rising health care costs. In making sense of all this, I think it helps to consider two different questions we might want to ask when considering payments to workers.  The first is, &#8220;What does it cost a business to purchase one hour of a worker&#8217;s time?&#8221;  To answer this question, a broad (benefit inclusive) measure of labor compensation is clearly the right one. Now consider the second question: &#8220;Does an increase in payments made by firms to workers make workers better off?&#8221;  On this issue, the answer may very well depend on the difference between compensation paid in dollars and compensation paid in benefits. Maybe, but not necessarily.  Consider two workers, both of whom receive the same total amount of compensation, and both of whom spend exactly the same amount on health care.  Now suppose that those expenditures rise by 10% for both workers.  We&#8217;ll further suppose that worker 1&#8217;s wages rise by 10%, while worker 2&#8217;s employer holds his or her salary constant but picks up the tab for the higher medical costs.  Would you say that worker 1 is better off than worker 2?  Neither would I.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes – David does get around to the index number issue.  No – I would not banish reporting on both wages and fringes as separate series even if I agree with David that fringe benefit compensation is part of the story.</p>
