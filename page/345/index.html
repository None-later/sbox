<p>Rajiv Sethi: <a href="http://rajivsethi.blogspot.com/2010/02/invincible-markets-hypothesis.html">The Invincible Markets Hypothesis</a>: .</p>
<blockquote><p>There has been a lot of impassioned debate over the efficient markets hypothesis recently, but some of the disagreement has been semantic rather than substantive, based on a failure to distinguish clearly between informational efficiency and allocative efficiency.  Roughly speaking, informational efficiency states that active management strategies that seek to identify mispriced securities cannot succeed systematically&#8230;. Allocative efficiency requires more&#8230; is satisfied when the price of an asset accurately reflects the (appropriately discounted) stream of earnings&#8230;. If markets fail to satisfy this latter condition, then resource allocation decisions (such as residential construction or even career choices) that are based on price signals can result in significant economic inefficiencies.<br />[skip<br />The critics concede that informational efficiency is a reasonable approximation, at least with respect to short-term price forecasts, but deny that prices consistently provide &#8220;accurate signals for resource allocation.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>This post is long so I will try to put the punch-line up here.  Economists make terrible errors when they say a statement &#8220;a reasonable approximation&#8221;  of reality. Two very different meanings are conflated.  One is that direct evaluation of the statement shows that rejection is subtle so the statement is approximately true.  The other is that all claims which would be true if the statement were absolutely true are approximately true.  </p>
<p>There is a general reliance on a sort of smoothness assumption, so that a model based on approximately true assumptions must have approximately true implications.  </p>
<p>It is absolutely known and positively proven that this idea is totally false.  The result that it is totally false is old and very well established (google &#8220;epsilon equilibrium&#8221;) People who study the implications of the assumptions must know this.  Yet the idea that there is some general smoothness property in the mapping from assumptions to conclusions absolutely dominates economic theory.  </p>
<p>Yes I just said that economic theory is based on assuming something which is known to be a false statement in mathematics.  The reason is simple.  Without the demonstrably false assumption that approximately true assumptions imply approximately true conclusions, economic theory would lead to no conclusions.  The results of theories would be mere hypotheses to be rejected if they didn&#8217;t fit the data.</p>
<p>Economists absolutely claim that this is how they use theory.  This is absolutely false.  Standard models have implications which are rejected by the data and yet they remain standard models.</p>
<p>OK the one and only efficient markets hypothesis. </p>
<p>I&#8217;d say that, in a standard general equilibrium model, informational efficiency does imply allocational efficiency.  So to the extent that one accepts such models as guides, one should believe that, for practical purposes informational efficiency implies allocational efficiency.</p>
<p>The problem is that approximate informational efficiency does not imply approximate allocational efficiency.  </p>
<p>This is a well known theoretical result.   When the assumption of informational efficiency is used to draw conclusions (e.g. of allocational efficiency) it is necessary to assume that you can never beat the market.  Predictions about the present absolutely require that assumption that the market can be beaten at 10:00 AM EST on March 12 AD 1 million.  This hypothesis can&#8217;t be tested now obviously.</p>
<p>Anomalies in risk adjusted returns on the order of 1% per year can&#8217;t be detected.  We can&#8217;t be sure of exactly how to adjust for risk.  However, they can make the difference between allocative efficiency and gross inefficiency.</p>
<p>For policy makers there is a huge huge difference between &#8220;markets are approximately informational efficient&#8221; and &#8220;markets are informational efficient.&#8221; The second claim (plus standard false assumptions) implies that markets are allocatively efficient.  The second implies nothing about allocative efficiency.</p>
<p>What does the phrase &#8220;a reasonable approximation&#8221; mean ?  Does it mean A) rejection of the claim is subtle and controversial or B) rejection of all implications of the claim are subtle ?</p>
<p>I think standard usage would be B) a reasonable approximation is one that doesn&#8217;t lead us astray.  In economics the phrase is used in sense A, that is, only some implications of the claim can be used to test the claim because &#8230; because we said so.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s another factor as well. There&#8217;s been an enormous increase in money and credit in the past year. In fact, it seems to<a href="javascript:void(0)" target=""></a> be as great as 5 years&#8217; growth in credit in the previous Chinese bubble. What happens is that the increase in money and credit is so great and so abrupt that you tend to get a high inflation quite quickly even if there are under utilised resources? Add to this the fact that you&#8217;ve got massive fiscal stimulus occurring today in China.</p>
<p>You have the makings of a very messy situation: if China seeks to sustain demand via fiscal policy, then you could get a big inflation problem, which could severely erode the tradeables sector. And you have all of these Chinese students all steeped in Chicago School monetary theory, coming home and taking over. So they might do a Paul Volcker to stop inflation.</p>
<p>But, what if the they don&#8217;t? Inflation can take off and thereby begin to ERODE the competitiveness of Chinese exports. This might be the real reason why China is so reticent to revalue its currency. The Americans might go crazy if the Chinese devalue, but if the inflation is high enough, they might have to do it, as it will severely erode their terms of trade and cause their tradeables sector to collapse.</p>
<p>Or you get the hard-line monetarists triumphing by fighting inflation and you get riots as unemployment increases.</p>
<p>It could get very ugly.</p>
<p>This could be happening now in China. Everybody says no. The consensus is that inflation is a couple per cent and it is all pork prices because there was a lousy corn harvest.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />However, economists such as those at Lombard Street in the UK, Jim Walker, Simon Hunt and the like try to figure out the changes quarter to quarter in Chinese nominal GDP which is reported only year on year. And they come up with giant double digit growth rates for the second half of last year.</p>
<p>Now this is complicated by the fact that the Chinese have revised up their GDP numbers and they throw the revisions all into the final quarter of the year. But when these guys try to adjust for that statistical screw up they still come up with giant nominal GDP increases. Lombard Street thinks it was twenty five per cent or so in the second half of last year. They think it was twenty per cent real and five per cent inflation.</p>
<p>Economies never grow at a twenty per cent real rate. And Simon Hunt says if you look at proxies like power output and rail traffic you don&#8217;t get those kinds of numbers for real growth, which suggests that inflation must be higher than four or five per cent. Indeed, it could already be double digit. It is hard to say. But if it is double digit then the resultant inflation will cause a real revaluation of the trade weighted exchange rate.</p>
<p>And more so if the dollar rallies. That could well crush the volume of exports and the profitability of the industrial tradeables sector. Exports are the only area where China makes any kind of money because they can sell these products for about 10 times what they obtain for a comparable product in the domestic economy (where profits are virtually nil). The export sector is a big contributor to overall super excessive fixed investment in China. FDI will go to zero net.</p>
<p>There will be strong forces for a reduction in fixed investment in this large sector. Hence, there is a good chance that even without monetary tightening by the Chinese authorities, the overall fixed investment boom in China will turn down.</p>
<p>Nobody is thinking about this but it is a real possibility. And with fixed investment now at fifty per cent of gdp (which is unprecedented in any economy) and exports at more than thirty, we&#8217;re looking at ratios that have never been reached before on a combined basis turning these two down could create a severe recession in China. China has gone too far this time. I think they are in a box that they and others don&#8217;t recognize. The &#8220;Black Swan&#8221; event this year could well be a devaluation of the RMB.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://tamyraforsenate.com/">Tamyra d&#8217;Ippolito</a> has suddenly become a Very Important Person.</p>
<p>She needs signatures primarily in Indian&#8217;s Eighth District (currently represented by Brad Ellsworth, who would be the Party&#8217;s pick to replace Evan Bayh), Evansville, and Terre Haute.  She has a background to make a Tea Partier proud:<br />
<blockquote>I was born in Worthington, Indiana and raised in Linton. Currently, I live in Bloomington. I was raised an only child with a single, hard-working mother who &#8220;retired&#8221; from General Electric as a factory worker. </p>
<p>I attended college at Indiana State University in Terre Haute, receiving my degrees in Graphic Design and Photography. The United States government financed my education with federal grants. </p>
<p>In 1981, jobs were limited in Indiana so I moved to Houston, Texas and worked for over 3 years at Foley&#8217;s, an advertising agency, as a Production Artist. At 25, I moved to New York City where I lived for the next 20 years. I worked on Wall Street for Salomon Smith Barney and later for Lehman Brothers. While in NYC I picked up another degree at the New York Film Academy in Filmmaking&#8230;.</p>
<p>When I returned to Indiana, I was chosen by the Linton Rotary to go with a team to the country of Brazil. We were Ambassadors of the USA and traveled to 6 different cities. In Indiana, I became involved with World Learning. I worked as a Regional Director with World Learning in Indiana, Boston, and New York City</p>
<p>However, since moving to Indiana I have had no health insurance. I was diagnosed with colon cancer five years ago giving me a pre-existing condition. Additionally, I own a small business. Those two obstacles make insurance very expensive and unattainable. As a cancer survivor and small business owner, health reform is an issue that directly affects me like many Indiana residents.</p>
<p>I own and operate the Ragazzi Arte Cafe in Bloomington. I also founded the Poor Club, www.thepoorclub.org, after meeting many people who are in need. Our mission is to bring awareness and education to the fact that poverty is prevalent in Indiana and I want to make a change for the better.</p>
<p>I am a past board member of Women Inspire, www.womeninspire.org. I am also a member of PSI XOTA, a philanthropic sorority. Some of my accomplishments are Leadership Bloomington Graduate of 1995 and City of Bloomington Citizens’ Academy Graduate in 2008. I also serve on the Volunteers in Medicine Advisory Board.</p></blockquote>
<p>Right now, the Democratic Party (having been royally screwed by its current Senator) is hoping that Tammy doesn&#8217;t get enough signatures to qualify for the ballot, which would enable them <a href="http://washingtonindependent.com/76604/how-can-democrats-replace-bayh">to pick someone without bothering with a primary</a>.</p>
<p>But here&#8217;s a small business owner, someone who earned things and is quite aware of &#8220;from where it is that I come from.&#8221;</p>
<p>In short, an ideal candidate from outside of the Establishment—but one who comes naturally without having to build a third party. And someone who—as a small-business owner—knows very well what works and what doesn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>If the Tea Party people endorse her, then I&#8217;ll take them seriously.  If they avoid her because she would have to run with a (D) next to her name, then that will tell us everything we need to know about whether they are Astroturf.</p>

<p>Why does the world care about Chinese monetary policy? In short, the ten countries below enjoy 60% of China&#8217;s import demand ($1.3 trillion annualized in December 2009), where the % are listed in the legend.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/S3a-PPMGdgI/AAAAAAAAC2s/lAul-diE1wk/s1600-h/china_imports.png"><img border="0" alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/S3a-PPMGdgI/AAAAAAAAC2s/lAul-diE1wk/s400/china_imports.png"></a> The globe is watching Chinese policy. The People&#8217;s Republic of China <a href="http://www.pbc.gov.cn/detail.asp?col=100&#038;id=3514">raised bank reserve requirements another 50 bps</a> yesterday &#8211; its second such measure since <a href="http://www.pbc.gov.cn/english/detail.asp?col=6400&#038;id=1458">January</a>. From the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/13/business/global/13yuan.html?partner=rss&#038;emc=rss">NY Times</a>:<br />
<blockquote>China’s central bank moved late Friday to reduce lending to companies and individuals by requiring large commercial banks to increase the amount of cash they park with the central bank. The move, which came earlier than most economists had expected, was meant to slow China’s breakneck economy and inflation.</p>
<p>and later&#8230;</p>
<p>Fears that China’s move Friday would slow global growth sent share prices sliding across Europe and pushed New York markets lower when they opened, though they recovered some of the losses. China’s commercial banks have become important lenders to the rest of the world as American banks have considerably reduced lending.</p>
<p>“The timing is a surprise,” said Qing Wang, an economist in the Hong Kong office of Morgan Stanley, referring to the central bank’s action&#8230;<br /><a name="more"></a><br />&#8230; Jing Ulrich, the managing director and chairwoman of China equities and commodities at J. P. Morgan, said, “The message coming out of China has been quite clear — policy makers are becoming more concerned about containing inflationary expectations and managing the risk of asset price bubbles as a result of last year’s aggressive expansion of credit.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Less credit = smaller growth rates. And it&#8217;s not just &#8220;markets&#8221; that are worried about the slowdown of the Chinese economy. On Feb. 2, the <a href="http://www.rba.gov.au/media-releases/2010/mr-10-02.html">Reserve Bank of Australia referred to China directly</a> <a href="http://www.rba.gov.au/media-releases/2010/mr-10-02.html">in its policy statement</a>:<br />
<blockquote>In Asia, where financial sectors are not impaired, recovery has been much quicker to date, though the Chinese authorities are now seeking to reduce the degree of stimulus to their economy.</p></blockquote>
<p>And Feb. 11, the <a href="http://eng.bok.or.kr/">Bank of Korea, in its monetary policy statement, referred</a> explicitly to the European crisis as cause for concern:<br />
<blockquote>There still, however, remains uncertainty as to the economic growth path due to the risk of government debt crises in some European countries.</p></blockquote>
<p>Trade, i.e., external demand is very much on the mind of global policy makers. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/11/business/economy/11econ.html">Global trade is rebounding</a>, but US import demand has not <a href="http://www.calculatedriskblog.com/2010/02/trade-deficit-increases-to-402-billion.html">recovered fully</a>. And until global domestic demand is a sure-fire boost to economic activity &#8211; not just an inventory cycle &#8211; policy makers will consider carefully the external factors (i.e., exports from China, for example) when making fiscal and monetary decisions.</p>

<p>The House passed a puny measure worth about $154 billion over a decade.  The Senate, strangled by the GOP party of no, appears set to pass a bill that does almost nothing and costs only about $15 billion over a decade.  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/12/us/politics/12cong.html">See Deal on Jobs Shows Limits of Push for Bipartisanship</a>, NY Times, Feb. 12, 2010 and the NY Times editorial, Ho NOt to Write a Jobs Bill, NY Times Feb. 12, 2010 at A 26.</p>
<p>What is Reid proposing?  </p>
<p>1) waiver of the ER 6.2% Social Security tax for workers hired who haven&#8217;t had a job for 60 days, plus a $1000 tax credit for any new employee retained for 52 weeks.</p>
<p>this is really puny stuff.  First, it&#8217;s a tax break for an employer who won&#8217;t be likely to hire a new employee for the break&#8211;too little at stake, and new employees aren&#8217;t hired until there is work for them to do. The employer is more likely to pocket this money for himself or his shareholders&#8211;a nice little extra profit.  Second, the employer will just get the reduced taxes for new employees that it would have hired anyway&#8211;it isn&#8217;t at all likely to create new jobs that wouldn&#8217;t have been created without this &#8220;ice cream topping&#8221;.  So this is another piece of the current corporatist agenda&#8211;giveaway to business, without any real results for ordinary Americans.</p>
<p>2) extend the expensing of capital investments yet again.</p>
<p>This is not just puny, but also &#8220;been there, done that&#8221; and no magnificant new job creation was forthcoming.  Businesses only need to make capital investments if they expect more business that their current equipment can&#8217;t handle.  If they don&#8217;t have consumer demand, they don&#8217;t need the new investments.  This expensing provision was already part of the Bush &#8220;job creation&#8221; business-friendly tax cut packages. Look at the record there&#8211;really puny job creation and nothing to show that tax cuts and deregulation do anything to create sustained job creation.  Further, since it&#8217;s already been done, it  has been around for long enough that businesses that were at the point of needing new equipment just to keep going may have already used it to accelerate somewhat that equipment purchase.  But they aren&#8217;t gonna buy equipment they don&#8217;t need.  That&#8217;s like thinking that a set of 64 wine glasses is so cheap that it&#8217;s a bargain, but then realizing that you still have 32 in a box that you haven&#8217;t used for the past three years so even a bargain is a waste of money.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />3) reauthorize spending on road and transit programs</p>
<p>Well, this is at least related to working on public infrastructure projects, which is the only thing that really has any prospect of creating (or preventing the loss of) jobs.  It should be focused on innovative &#8220;green&#8221; solutions&#8211;inner city rail, etc.  And those projects will create real jobs.  But this is way too little money &#8211;get rid of programs 1 and 2 and put all that money here, plus about $150 billion more over the next year, and we might have something worthwhile.</p>
<p>4) provide a federal subsidy to states for a portion of the interest on bonds used to finance public works projects</p>
<p>A good idea, but too puny.  States are truly strapped for cash, and as the editorial points out, states employ about a fourth of  the work force (almost as many as the health sector) and have been cutting jobs right and left to balance budgets.  Those jobs matter and have a huge impact on morale and on other things&#8211;nothing like a bureaucratic entanglement from lack of personnel to delay that public infrastructure project.  So this puny little amount of money will help, but it isn&#8217;t nearly enough.</p>
<p>What should Congress be doing instead?  It should be thinking of public infrastructure and human capital projects that provide3 support to important public institutions that will last long beyond the current Recession.  Congress should be funding public transit and renewable energy projects that would directly put to work hundreds of thousands of ordinary Americans.   Another important public infrastructure project that would make a real difference in unemployment?  How about providing 1-2 billion apiece to the ten largest inner cities to be used for urban renewal&#8211;destruction of ruined buildings, building of public transit and energy projects&#8211;with the requiremment that at least 75% of the employees be from the city itself.  Detroit&#8217;s mayor has said that tehre aare 10,000 buildings that need to be pulled down in the city.  That would be great work for unskilled laborers and make a marvelous dent in uhemployment.  And it should be providing another stimulus packagge for the states to support education from K-16 and beyond&#8211;the best investment we can make in keeping our US universities and schools great, keeping educators employed, and offering ordinary Americans the chance to better themselves through educational advancement.</p>
<p>Just imagine.  What if Congress would have the courage to discuss these issues publicly?  Quit thinking about their corporatist patrons?  Start thinking about ordinary Americans?  And actually fund public infrastructure and human capital support over the next two years.<br />__________________________________<br />crosposted with <a target="_blank" href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/">ataxingmatter</a></p>

<p>The sole B&#038;N customer review so far is a confused jumble:<br />
<blockquote>If you take away the authors attempts to sell the need for big government and socialism it is a excellent book on present problems in the financial markets. He shows how we are living beyond our means and that in the future our living standard will probably go down. He does a excellent job at examining the large banks failures and the need for regulations to protect the public from the large banks greed.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you take away the need for big government, you get the need for more regulation. If you take away the need to control large bank failures, you get large bank failures produced by excess risk (&#8220;living beyond our means&#8221; = &#8220;privatize the profits, socialize the risks&#8221;).</p>
<p>Fifteen years ago, everyone coming out of Business School was talking about how they learned about &#8220;risk.&#8221;  While it is true that those people are not running large financial institutions, they are starting to reach upper management levels. So it&#8217;s possible that &#8220;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/14/opinion/14trillin.html?_r=2&#038;ref=opinion&#038;pagewanted=print">smart guys started working on Wall Street</a>&#8221; won&#8217;t be the problem next time. (h/t <a href="http://norris.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/10/14/too-many-brains/">Floyd Norris</a>, again)</p>
<p>They might get it right the next time.</p>
<p>Is that the way to bet?</p>

<p>It is a very common trope among the Right to claim that Obama is a Socialist. For Progressives with any awareness of modern history and politics this seems ludicrous, it is hard to see that Obama is even committed to the principles of the New Deal, still less the second coming of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.biographybase.com/biography/Wallace_Henry_A.html">Henry Wallace</a> or even Hubert Humphrey. But from a wordview common to the Right it is not odd at all, what Progressives if anything think of as an end state: a future Social Democracy is for Conservatives a process, one they intend to resist. You can see this worldview on display in this review of Friedrich Hayek&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mises.org/store/Road-to-Serfdom-The-P252C0.aspx">The Road to Serfdom</a><br />
<blockquote>What F.A. Hayek saw, and what most all his contemporaries missed, was that every step away from the free market and toward government planning represented a compromise of human freedom generally and a step toward a form of dictatorship&#8211;and this is true in all times and places. He demonstrated this against every claim that government control was really only a means of increasing social well-being. Hayek said that government planning would make society less liveable, more brutal, more despotic. Socialism in all its forms is contrary to freedom.</p>
<p>Nazism, he wrote, is not different in kind from Communism. Further, he showed that the very forms of government that England and America were supposedly fighting abroad were being enacted at home, if under a different guise. Further steps down this road, he said, can only end in the abolition of effective liberty for everyone.</p>
<p>Capitalism, he wrote, is the only system of economics compatible with human dignity, prosperity, and liberty. To the extent we move away from that system, we empower the worst people in society to manage what they do not understand.</p></blockquote>
<p>Once you understand that many Conservatives have internalized this and like Buckley define the goal of Conservatism as &#8220;&#8221;to stand athwart history, yelling, &#8216;Stop!&#8221; much that seems baffling and incoherent about the Conservative mindset becomes clear.</p>
<p>When Palin came out the other day and asked the crowd &#8220;How&#8217;s that hopey, changey thing working out for you?&#8221; she was just tapping into this existing mindset. For Conservatives aspirations for &#8220;Hope and Change&#8221; simply evoke the ever present risk of taking that first step down the Road to Serfdom. From this perspective being the &#8220;Party of No&#8221; to a President running on a platform of &#8220;Change&#8221; is a principled stand in resisting tyranny. For Conservatives Socialism is a process, a dangerous process that once it starts may not be easily checked.</p>
<p>To probably most people the battle against Social Security seemd quixotic, a battle that was fought and lost several times in the past and likely to be lost again. For Conservatives it is just lost ground on the Road to Serfdom, maybe it is too late to push it back, but that being no reason to just let Progressives use its success to drag you further down the Road.</p>
<p>I find it instructive to examine the authorized, literally cartoon version of <a target="_blank" href="http://mises.org/books/TRTS/">The Road to Serfdom</a>. This was not meant as any kind of joke at the time, it comes from the same mindset that would present Goldberg&#8217;s &#8220;Liberal Fascism&#8221; as a serious work of political and historical analysis. In the first seven panels of the cartoon you see a process started by well intentioned planners, but which is coopted a the future orator with &#8220;fierce oratory&#8221; (&#8220;the fierce urgency of now&#8221;) in panel eight. Panel nine shows a state of gridlock whereupon power it passed to the new dictator in panel ten. By panel thirteen one party power is established. And by final panel 18 &#8220;If you are fired from your job, it is likely to be by firing squad&#8221;.</p>
<p>You can call this raging paranoia, and certainly it taps into fear and pre-existing ideas of apocalism, but it is not on its own terms irrational. These people really do believe that Fascism had its origins in Do-Good Liberalism and that they hear echoes of Hitler in Obama. That which Progressives find inspiring, Obama&#8217;s eloquence and at least rhetorical commitment to change, are to Conservatives dire threats. Giving way even a little is just to be shoved one more step, then another down the Road to Serfdom.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>I had an informal discussion with a manager in an MBS IT area last month. Just a general conversation about the field and the data people check.  He mentioned FICO scores and I noted that I’m not fond of using them to evaluate a mortgage, especially for first-time homebuyers.</p>
<p>Part of this is simple: it’s relatively easier—even in the densely-populated metropolitan areas (e.g., NYC, SF), and certainly in sub- and exurban areas—to maintain a good credit rating if you don’t own a residence.  No property taxes, no major repairs, no appliance replacement, no general maintenance, no landscaping, no snow shoveling.  And it’s very easy, especially the first time, to underestimate just how much those expenses will be.  Looking at just the cost of commuting, renting, storage, parking, etc. makes homeownership appear to be a better economic decision than it is.*</p>
<p>Well, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York recently released some data on mortgage payments by type. It’s not directly comparable—the subprime and Alt-A loans have a more granular level of data, most especially with respect to late and current payments—but there are some interesting relationships.</p>
<p>I looked at the data for States where the subprime loans are current for either (1) more than 55% of the borrowers or  (2) less than 45% of the borrowers, which includes 24 states and the District of Columbia.  The overall breakdown was 16 states in the first group and eight states and the District of Columbia in the second.</p>
<p>Of the six states that have more than 100,000 subprime loans outstanding, three—Illinois, Florida, and California—are in the More Delinquent category, while only one (Texas) is in the “so far, so good” realm.**<br /><a name="more"></a><br />So I ran a regression on those states and the District, using as factors the percent of the subprime loans that were not Owner-Occupied, the Average FICO score for the state, the percent of subprime loans issued to borrowers with a FICO below 600, and the percent of subprime loans issued to borrowers with a FICO score above 660.  The result was<br />
<blockquote>PctwithCurrPymt = –1.18*(FICO>660) + .292*(FICO<600) + .266*(Average FICO Score) –0.9*(Pct Not Owner-Occupied) –93.66
<p>R-squared = 0.4213  (Adjusted R-squared= .3056) F = 3.64  (Prob > F = 0.0220)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, none of the coefficients passes the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student's_t-test">t-test</a>.</p>
<p>If we assume that there is a solid distinction between a FICO score below 600 and one above 660, then we must note that the signs of this regression are <em>precisely the opposite</em> of what we should expect.  The more loans with an initial FICO score above 660, the fewer the number of households that are expected to be current in their payment. Conversely, the more households with a FICO score below 600, the better the Current Payment Performance should be expected to be.
<p>This would seem to be a Very Bad Regression—both methodologically, since it takes two separate sets of data and treats them as if they are part of the same set and intuitively, since it produces results that are not compatible with rational assumptions—but that may not be so.</p>
<p>California, for instance, has the third-highest percentage of Owner-Occupied Properties, the highest Average FICO Score, the lowest percentage of subprime loans to borrowers with FICO scores below 600 and the highest percentage of subprime loans to borrowers with a FICO score above 660.  But it falls into the group where fewer than 45.0% of the borrowers are current.***</p>
<p>Which means that, were you to use FICO scores as an input to your model for buying Whole Loans to securitize, you would likely have bought more currently-dicey CA paper than not.</p>
<p>But, as noted, we may believe this to be a Very Bad Regression. The greatest likelihood is that there is/are (an) excluded variable(s) in the equation.  If we consider the entire set of data, this becomes clearer.  The regression equation for all of the states and the District of Columbia is:</p>
<blockquote><p>PctwithCurrPymt = <strong>–1.019*(FICO>660)</strong> <strong>+ .6118*(FICO<600)</strong> + .7685*(Average FICO Score) –0.38*(Pct Not Owner-Occupied) –422.80
<p>R-squared = 0.1471  (Adjusted R-squared= .0730) F = 1.98  (Prob > F = 0.1128)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The signs remain consistent—and counterintuitive—but there is a much lower explanatory power and it is much more likely that the regression fails the F-test.  And again, none of the coefficients passes a t-test.
<p>Adding variables whose signs are more likely to produce indeterminate results—the Average Age and the Average Interest Rate of the Loans—corrects the two original signage issues, but produced a third (and possibly a fourth):</p>
<blockquote><p>PctwithCurrPymt = 1.375546*(FICO>660) –1.639*(FICO<600) <strong>&#8211; 1.3423*(Average FICO Score)</strong> –0.223*(Pct Not Owner-Occupied) <strong>+ 16.5340 AvgInterestRate</strong> + 0.2632 AvgLoanAge + 775.9700</p>
<p>R-squared = 0.4661  (Adjusted R-squared= .3991) F = 6.40  (Prob > F = 0.0001)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The additional variables have significantly raised the explanatory power of the model, and we now see that the FICO scores point in the intuitive directions. But the Average FICO score has ceased to be a positive contributor to the model, and the Average Interest Rate—the only variable that passes a t-test for significance—indicates that the higher the rate, the higher the likelihood of payment.</p>
<p>So we are left suspecting that the initial FICO score does not significantly affect the ability of the borrower to keep their loan payment(s) current.  This also seems intuitive, since a FICO score is a stock variable, while mortgage payments are flow variables.</p>
<p>But, as with credit ratings, good FICO scores can only go downward.  And it is very rare—especially in an environment in which there is downward pressure on wages—for a good FICO score to go upward.  Indeed, dropping the positive FICO score and the Average FICO score as a variables makes for a better regression:<br />
<blockquote>PctwithCurrPymt = –0.663*(FICO<600)  –0.238*(Pct Not Owner-Occupied) + 15.4976 AvgInterestRate + 0.1469 AvgLoanAge – 47.325
<p>R-squared = 0.4466  (Adjusted R-squared= .3985) F = 9.28  (Prob > F = 0.0000)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While the Average Interest Rate still has a counterintuitive sign, we should note that the Averages range from 6.69 to 8.66%—even the high end is neither an overwhelming burden for subprime borrowers nor a level from which it is likely to have been worth refinancing. Additionally, while AvgInterestRate remains the only coefficient that completely passes a t-test, both FICO<600 (-3.17) and the constant (-2.54) are negative for all values within a 95% confidence interval.

dropping non-owner-occupied from equation sharpens matters even more:
<blockquote>PctwithCurrPymt = –0.6747*(FICO<600)  + 15.7738 AvgInterestRate + 0.1400 AvgLoanAge – 50.7117
<p>R-squared = 0.4407  (Adjusted R-squared= .4050) F = 12.34  (Prob > F = 0.0000)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With the t-values for both FICO<600 (-3.25) and the constant (-2.83) now both more than 99% probable and, again, the values being negative for the entirety of a 95% confidence interval.

In summary, the use of FICO scores as a predictor of mortgage repayments appears to be questionable at best, for the same reason that “junk” bonds tended to outperform high-grade securities on a risk-adjusted basis: it is much easier for a rating to decline than it is for it to improve.  The value of a FICO score as a predictor of loan performance appears to be much more for lower scores than it is for higher ones.  Whether there is greater value on a risk-adjusted basis, as there legendarily has been for corporate bonds, is left for further, more detailed research.

*None of which is to suggest that the non-economic reasons aren’t valid.  But credit scores deal with how you manage credit, and how you manage credit has to do with the options you have as much as the choices you make.  Homeowners have fewer options on the allocation of funds to lodging than renters do.

**New York State and Ohio are in the middle range.with 46.8% and 52.0% current, respectively.

***Only Hawaii had tighter FICO standards than California—and they have the second-highest (worst) level of non Owner-Occupied Subprime loans (and the worst of any area with more than 10,000 subprime loans outstanding), while California is fifth-best (lowest) in that metric.

                                <p>Brad DeLong&#8217;s famous rule (Originally: &#8220;If you think Paul Krugman must be wrong, <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2009/05/this-is-getting-damned-annoying-will-i-ever-be-allowed-to-disagree-with-paul-krugman-again-about-anything-niall-ferguson-e.html">you severely overestimated Niall Ferguson</a>&#8220;) needs a corollary.</p>
<p>If Olivier Blanchard says your macroeconomic policy doesn&#8217;t work, and that <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB20001424052748704337004575059542325748142.html">you should double your inflation target to make it reasonable</a>, it&#8217;s worth trying:<br />
<blockquote>The International Monetary Fund&#8217;s top economist, Olivier Blanchard, says central bankers should consider aiming for a higher inflation rate than they do currently to lessen the chances of repeating the recent severe recession.</p>
<p>&#8230;[T]he global economic downturn revealed flaws in macroeconomic policy, especially the reliance primarily on interest rates to manage economies. Although Japan had fallen into a decade-long funk despite low inflation and low interest rates, &#8220;most people convinced themselves that the Japanese didn&#8217;t know what they were doing,&#8221; Mr. Blanchard said in an interview.</p>
<p>In particular, [Mr. Blanchard&#8217;s new paper with two other IMF economists, Giovanni Dell&#8217;Ariccia and Paolo Mauro] suggests shooting for a higher-level inflation in &#8220;normal time in order to increase the room for monetary policy to react to such shocks.&#8221; Central banks may want to target 4% inflation, rather than the 2% target that most central banks now try to achieve, the IMF paper says.</p>
<p>At a 4% inflation rate, Mr. Blanchard says, short-term interest rates in placid economies likely would be around 6% to 7%, giving central bankers far more room to cut rates before they get near zero, after which it is nearly impossible to cut short-term rates further.</p></blockquote>
<p>None of the major Macro work ever done, from Barro forward, has ever found damage to economic growth from 4% inflation.</p>
