                                                                    </div>

                                <p>As Greenspan <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/07/greenspan-highlight-reel.html">discussed at length</a> earlier this week in his semi-annual report to Congress, economists still have no clear-cut explanation for the “conundrum” (or <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/06/greenspan-on-interest-rate-mystery.html"><em>Interest Rate Mystery</em></a>, as I like to call it) of stubbornly low long-term interest rates in the US.</p>
<p>But perhaps that&#8217;s because there really is no conundrum.  Perhaps the US’s surprisingly low long-term rates are actually not that low.  Perhaps US interest rates have indeed been pushed up in the past year, as many economists have been predicting they would.  Perhaps the expected rise in long-term rates in the US has simply been masked by a simultaneous world-wide fall in interest rates.</p>
<p>Put another way: perhaps the only reason we haven’t seen more obvious signs of long-term interest rates rising in the US is that there has simultaneously been a worldwide downward trend in interest rates that has offset such a rise.  The behavior of interest rates last week in the wake of China&#8217;s revaluation (which I discussed in the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/07/interest-rates-and-renminbi.html">previous post</a>) provides one small example of this larger trend.</p>
<p>The following chart illustrates.  It shows long-term interest rates (measured by the yield on the 10-year government bond) in several countries over the past year and a half.  All around the world, long-term interest rates have clearly trended down for the past year or so – except in the US (represented by the heavy black line), where they have stubbornly remained in the range of 4.0%-4.5%.</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/long_term_differentials1.jpg"><br /> Note: the series for Germany/France is an average of interest rates for Germany and France, used because their interest rates are extremely close (within 5-7 basis points throughout this time period).  July rates are taken as the average interest rate for the middle two weeks in July.</p>
<p>The following table provides more details about this divergence between interest rate behavior in the US and the rest of the world.  The first column shows by how much long-term interest rates have fallen since January 2004, thus corresponding to the changes between the starting and ending points in the chart above.  With the single exception of Japan, all of the non-US countries have enjoyed a fall in long-term interest rates of between 0.5%-1.0% since early 2004.  US long-term rates, on the other hand, are virtually unchanged.</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/long_term_differentials2.jpg"></p>
<p>The second column shows the average interest rate differential between each of the countries listed and the US from 2000 to 2003.  For example, the government bonds of France and Germany typically paid an interest rate around 0.1%-0.2% lower than the equivalent US government bond, while Canadian government bond yields were typically about 0.7% higher than US yields through the first four years of this decade.</p>
<p>Yet the final column shows that currently all of the countries in this sample, again with the exception of Japan, have seen the yield on their government bonds fall &#8211; in most cases, quite substantially &#8211; relative to the long-term interest rate that the US government must pay to borrow money.  Even Canadian bonds, which have typically had to pay significantly higher yields than US bonds, are now enjoying lower interest rates than equivalent US bonds. </p>
<p>So while long-term interest rates have generally been trending downward around the world over the past year or so, the US has missed out on this global fall in interest rates.  Put another way, the US has enjoyed the global fall in interest rates, but it has only served to counteract other forces that have been simultaneously driving long-term rates up in the US, so that the net result is that long-term interest rates in the US have remained stable for quite some time now.</p>
<p>Seen in this light, the “conundrum” may need to be rephrased.  Instead of wondering why long-term interest rates in the US have stayed so low, we need to answer the following two questions: (1) What is behind the seemingly global decline in interest rates of the past year or so; and (2) Why has the US missed out on this fall in interest rates?  Why are long-term interest rates in the US so high by comparison to the rest of the world?</p>
<p>More on these questions later.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Last week when the Chinese central bank first announced that they were going to change the value of their currency against the dollar, <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/07/finally-big-event-china-revalues.html">I suggested</a> that one of the interesting things to keep an eye on would be long-term interest rates in the US. </p>
<p>It turns out that long-term US interest rates did indeed bump up on the day of the announcement, by about 11 or 12 basis points&#8230; only to fall much of the way back down the next day.  As of now, long-term interest rates in the US are very little changed from where they were a week ago.  Apparently the renminbi news had no substantial effect on US interest rates.</p>
<p>But that’s not the whole story.  </p>
<p>Why do I say that?  Because while rates didn’t rise much in the US as a result of the renminbi revaluation, interest rates in most other countries fell, in most cases quite substantially.  The following table shows the difference between long-term (10-year government bond) interest rates in the US and in several other major developed countries last week.  The table suggests that the Chinese revaluation, which happened on the 21st, apparently had a significant effect on the interest rate differentials between the US and other countries.  </p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/long_term_differentials3.jpg"><br />Note: Negative numbers signify interest rates that are lower than US rates.  <br />Source: <em>Financial Times</em>.</p>
<p>In other words, while US interest rates didn’t rise much in absolute terms, the news from China did cause them to rise substantially relative to the rest of the world.  I would argue that this is evidence that China&#8217;s exchange rate policy is indeed having noticeable effects on domestic US interest rates &#8211; just not in the most obvious ways that we might have expected.    </p>

                                <p>Your company&#8217;s cash flow was surprisingly strong last quarter.  What do you do?</p>
<p>I can tell you from experience that most managers start spending more.   A new computer system here, a few new hires there, maybe a larger bonus for the executives; more spending is the impulse reaction.   </p>
<p>But some executives are more cautious.  They keep a firm hand on the purse strings while they start asking questions: Why was cash flow above plan?  Will it continue?  And is that new computer system or those potential new hires part of the plan?  Boring?  Maybe.  Good management?  Absolutely.  </p>
<p>And that brings me to this Editorial in the Washington Post: <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/23/AR2005072300742.html">Surpluses and Luck</a>.  It is really the tale of two Governors; Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich of Maryland who is taking credit for his state’s good fortune and is moving to cut taxes, and Gov. Mark R. Warner of Virginia, who is setting some of the extra revenues aside.</p>
<p>Perhaps Gov. Ehrlich could learn a lesson from California Gov. Gray Davis&#8217; poor decisions during the stock market boom.  As can be imagined, California&#8217;s revenues soared at the end of the &#8217;90s and Davis responded by cutting taxes and boosting spending.   Then came the bust followed by the broom.  </p>
<p>The Post&#8217;s conclusion draws from a similar experience:<br />
<blockquote>Just a few years ago, at the peak of the high-tech bubble, Maryland enjoyed a $1 billion surplus; when the bubble burst, the surplus rapidly dissolved. As with the tech bubble, no one should expect the current housing boom, which is already showing age, to last forever. When it ends, so will the current jubilation in state capitals and boasts by governors touting their fiscal &#8220;talent.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>  I don&#8217;t know much about Virginia&#8217;s Governor Mark Warner, but I like him already!</p>

As its free lunch proponents often try to sell DeMint’s ideas, Mark is absolutely correct.  But now the <a href="http://www.heritage.org/press/dailybriefing/policyweblog.cfm?blogid=2F5DF947-DC72-C238-B6E6809B5A2DA3F3">Heritage Foundation</a> tries to explain how a GROW proposal would reduce the alleged long-run insolvency problem:</p>
<blockquote><p>The proposal would reduce traditional Social Security benefit that workers receive by an amount equal in real terms, more or less, to the surplus funds deposited in their accounts.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, the Heritage Foundation thinks DeMint’s “GROW” proposal is really a benefit cut?  Actually, it is more akin to taking a dollar out of one’s left pocket and placing it into one’s right pocket.  </p>
<p>The DeMint plan does nothing to reduce the long-term insolvency problem of the overall Federal government -where the main issue is the massive General Fund deficit created by the fiscal irresponsibility since 2001 when the GOP assumed leadership in Washington.  But the Heritage Foundation is correct in saying it does nothing to worsen it either precisely because it does not increase the future benefits to young workers at all.  And yet, the proponents of this proposal try to claim that it will make young workers better off even as it somehow reduces the long-term insolvency problem of the overall Federal government.  Unless money grows on trees – you can’t have it both ways.  But this realization has never stopped the privatization crowd from lying to young workers.</p>

<p>It seems these hearings were attended by only Democratic members of Congress.  I hope Republican members read the transcripts.  </p>
<p><a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/opinion/233554_thomas22.html">Helen Thomas</a> notes how President Bush has lowered the bar for what is acceptable (hat tip to Mark Thoma).</p>
<p>Speaking of lowering the bar, the <a href="http://media.nationalreview.com/070430.asp">National Review</a> finds perjury and obstruction of justice perfectly acceptable behavior for a Republican Administration.</p>
<p><em><strong>Update</strong></em>: I’d like to thank CalculatedRisk for <a href="http://www.crooksandliars.com/2005/07/24.html#a4124">this link</a> to a discussion of the <em>Face the Nation</em> interview where Alberto Gonzalez had trouble with Bob Schieffer’s question as to the 12-hour delay to inform the White House staff that it must “preserve all materials”.  Now note this claim from <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/05_07_24_corner-archive.asp#070569">Andy McCarthy</a> about how President Bush is not evading the issue:</p>
<blockquote><p>He encouraged the investigation, he made statements about taking action against wrongdoers, and he has repeatedly said he wants the independent counsel to press ahead because he wants to know what happened. He has also sat for an interview himself and encouraged everyone in his administration to be cooperative.</p></blockquote>
<p>The <em>National Review</em> continues its string of dishonesty in their feeble defense of this Administration.</p>
<p><strong><em>Update II</em></strong>: <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/05_07_24_corner-archive.asp#070725">Ramesh Ponnuru</a> points to <a href="http://www.regnumcrucis.blogspot.com/2005_07_17_regnumcrucis_archive.html#112213791370833411">this post</a>, which accuses Larry Johnson et al. with playing politics with PlameGate.  Sad – as I had hoped Mr. Ponnuru would not so lower himself in the National Review’s efforts to blame others for Rove’s behavior.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/001481.html">Dean Baker</a> does a nice job of explaining why a significant yuan revaluation will increase our net exports to China – at least a little.  Dean’s implicit assumption is that the nominal revaluation will lead to an increase in the relative price of Chinese goods, which seems valid given the very modest inflation rates in both nations.  I have only two quibbles with Dean’s discussion:</p>
<blockquote><p>The process of raising the price of imported goods to people in the U.S. through an increase in the value of foreign currencies (which also makes our exports cheaper to other countries) is the only way to get our trade deficit down, other than a recession … The people who whine about how the budget deficit is causing the trade deficit (apart from any possible impacts on the value of the dollar) are proclaiming their ignorance. </p></blockquote>
<p>If you are thinking that Dean left off trade protection (the first quibble), maybe Robert Mundell might help rescue Dean’s claim – assuming we eventually move to a freely floating yuan.  Mundell might tell the trade protectionists that tariffs on Chinese imports would be offset by a yuan devaluation so that our exports to China would decline as much as the tariffs reduced our imports from China.</p>
<p>But this Mundell line of thinking leads me to my second quibble as I have been whining about the U.S. budget deficit.  To say the U.S. fiscal stimulus does not impact the trade deficit apart from possible impacts on the value of the dollar is akin to saying an outside shift in the demand for a good does not induce more production apart from possible impacts on the price of that good.  But again – I’m assuming a freely floating exchange rate.  </p>
<p>Alas, I had to also read <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_comment/darda200507220844.asp">Michael Darda</a> who clearly has never read the <em>General Theory</em> by Lord Keynes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Even if we accept this assertion (which is false), the Keynesian cure is worse than the supposed labor market disease. The neo-Keynesian elixir typically is a combination of higher tax rates on the entrepreneurial class (the rich), higher tariffs, and a devalued dollar. Africa and Latin America, which have binged on this advice for three decades, show exactly what the effects have been: no growth, dire poverty, disease, and desperation.</p></blockquote>
<p>I consider myself a Keynesian but I’m not advocating trade protection or a larger government.  I’m also an advocate of letting the market determine the value of currencies.  If Mr. Darda wants to bash the Schumer-Graham bill, he might be delighted than many Keynesian economists are also suggesting that this proposal is bad policy.  </p>
<p>But it seems that the real purposes of his NRO oped are to: (1) tell us that the labor market is doing just fine; and (2) to advocate a return to the gold standard.  On the first, the key passages are:</p>
<blockquote><p>Labor compensation is growing above a 7 percent annual rate while aggregate hours worked are rising … The chain-weighted capital-to-labor ratio, the raw fuel for productivity and income growth, has reached record levels and continues to grow at a two-digit pace, well above historical norms.  Those arguing that the labor market is weak insist the unemployment rate has dropped due to a declining labor force participation rate. They also argue that low-end wages are not keeping up with inflation. Even if we accept this assertion (which is false) … The employment participation rate &#8211; the fraction of the population in the labor force &#8211; only is 0.8 percent below its average from 1992-2000, which was biased upward due to dot-com overhiring. Since 2004, the participation rate has averaged 66 percent while the unemployment rate has dropped to 5 percent from 5.7 percent. Non-farm payrolls have expanded by more than 3.2 million during this period. This completely refutes the nonsensical claim that a mass exodus from the labor force has been the primary driver of the recent fall in the employment rate.  Since 2001, the growth rate of real wages of non-supervisory production workers, a group under pressure in the global economy, is about 0.9 percent above the rate of inflation (using the non-core PCE deflator). This is about 75 percent of the average from 1992-2000 and more than three times the average from 1971-2000.</p></blockquote>
<p>Notice that he begins this spin by looking at the growth of nominal compensation as opposed to the change in real wages.  It is true that real wages rose during 2001, but real wages as of June 2005 were actually below what they were as of December 2001.  His statement about non-farm payroll employment is simply wrong, but he does get it right when he says the employment to population ratio is lower than it was when Bush took office.  As far as his comment about the capital to labor ratio, it strikes me as either incorrect of incomprehensible.  </p>
<p>Alas, the <em>National Review</em> had another opportunity to make a clear case for free trade but let the writer drift onto another topic – where the writer wrote more of NRO’s patented nonsense.  So let me close by thanking Dean Baker for both sticking to the topic and writing sensibly.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Before I launch into the possible role of Condi Rice, let’s review what we have learned just since in the last couple of days:</p>
<p><a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2005/07/21/breaking-bloomberg-reporting-that-rove-libby-may-be-subject-to-perjury-charges">Scooter Libby</a> is blaming Tim Russert.</p>
<p>The memo taken onto Air Force One on <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/20/AR2005072002517.html">July 7, 2003</a> had an “S” to denote that it was secret – as in classified.</p>
<p>George Tenet’s <a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/week_2005_07_17.php#006149">mea culpa</a> regarding those sixteen words may have been drafted by Karl Rove and Scooter Libby.</p>
<p>Now to my little speculation.  The Bush Administration and its minions have been on an overzealous campaign to smear Joseph Wilson for over two years.  Part of this campaign involved the revelation that his wife – Valerie Plame – was a CIA operative.  One of these minions is our own Patrick R. Sullivan (aka Roland Patrick) who somehow believed that Wolf Blitzer’s <a href="http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0307/13/le.00.html">7/13/2003 interview </a> vindicated Karl Rove’s telling reporters about the fact that Wilson’s wife worked for the CIA:</p>
<blockquote><p>BLITZER: Who sent him?<br />RICE: Well, it was certainly not a level that had anything to do with the White House, and I do not believe at a level that had anything to do with the leadership of the CIA.<br />BLITZER: Supposedly, it came at the request of the vice president.<br />RICE: No, this is simply not true, and this is something that&#8217;s been perpetuated that we simply have to straighten out. The vice president did not ask that Joe Wilson go to Niger. The vice president did not know. I don&#8217;t think he knew who Joe Wilson was, and he certainly didn&#8217;t know that he was going. The first that I heard of Joe Wilson mission was when I was doing a Sunday talk show and heard about it. The other thing is that the reporting, at least, of what Ambassador Wilson told the CIA debriefers says that, yes, Niger denied that there had been such a deal made, that they had sold uranium to the Iraqis. It also apparently says, according to this report, it also apparently says that one of the people who was meeting with the Iraqis thought that they might, in fact, be trying to use commercial activity to talk about yellow cake. So what the director says in his statement is that they believed, when they looked at what was reported about the Wilson trip, that it was inconclusive. They therefore did not brief it to the president, the vice president or any senior officials. So no, the Wilson trip was not sent by anyone at a high level. It wasn&#8217;t briefed to anyone at high level. And it appears to have been inconclusive in what it found.<br />BLITZER: Did George Tenet know about the Joe Wilson trip to Africa?<br />RICE: I am not aware that George Tenet was aware that this happened before it happened.<br />BLITZER: Let me read to you what Joe Wilson wrote in &#8220;The New York Times&#8221; in that op-ed piece on July 6th. &#8220;I have little choice but to conclude that some of the intelligence related to Iraq&#8217;s nuclear weapons program was twisted to exaggerate the Iraqi threat.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>At the time, the “who sent him” did not seem to be a big deal.  In fact, it is still not a relevant matter except for one aspect of the smear Joe Wilson mantra.  The rightwing wants us to believe that Wilson lied in his 7/6/2003.  After all – they claim that Wilson said Cheney sent him.  Or they claim that Wilson said Tenet sent him.  But if one reads what Wilson wrote, he did not say either Cheney or Tenet sent him.  Now I’ll concede one could be part of the smear Joe Wilson campaign but not part of the outing of Valerie Plame.  </p>
<p>Now we see that Daxman over at <a href="http://www.tpmcafe.com/story/2005/7/20/16340/8649">TPMCafe</a> is wondering if Condi Rice was in on the outing of Ms. Plame:</p>
<blockquote><p>But a key exchange on the Wilson trip did occur in the July 11, 2003 press gaggle aboard Air Force One with both Ari Fleischer and Condoleezza Rice and it wasn’t  Ari pushing the Wilson story. The transcript of the July 11, 2003 press gaggle has this interesting exchange:<br />Q Dr. Rice, when did you all find out that the documents were forged? <br />DR. RICE: Sometime in March, I believe. Is that right? <br />MR. FLEISCHER: The IAEA reported it. <br />DR. RICE: The IAEA reported it I believe in March. But I will tell you that, for instance, on Ambassador Wilson&#8217;s going out to Niger, I learned of that when I was sitting on whatever TV show it was, because that mission was not known to anybody in the White House. And you should ask the Agency at what level it was known in the Agency. <br />Q When was that TV show, when you learned about it? <br />DR. RICE: A month ago, about a month ago. <br />Q Can I ask you about something else? <br />DR. RICE: Yes. Are you sure you&#8217;re through with this?</p></blockquote>
<p>Daxman continues with his interpretation of what Dr. Rice was up to here.  While Bush minion Roland Patrick was trying to convince us that the press was very interested in “who sent him” on July 13, they were not interested in this aspect of Dr. Rice’s mantra two days earlier.  I guess Dr. Rice got Wolf interested over the next couple of days.  What I find hilarious is that the more the rightwing tries to divert attention from Rove’s misdeeds, the more members of the White House they drag into this scandal. </p>

<blockquote><p>If the Washington press corps had a memory bank longer than 10 minutes, it could have exposed this years ago. The lies so often directly contradict one another.</p></blockquote>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>The latest in free lunch supply-side spin from <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_kucewicz/kucewicz200507210902.asp">William Kucewicz</a> actually provides some useful information.  For example, his chart of Germany’s unemployment rate distinguishing between the high unemployment rate for East Germany versus the more modest unemployment rate for West Germany.  As I gazed at his chart, my first thought was whether German policy would try to promote more investment in this formerly Communist region.  </p>
<p>Kucewicz, however, began with a discussion of the cost of labor:</p>
<blockquote><p>German workers are among the world’s most expensive. According to a recent OECD study, the average German manufacturing worker’s marginal tax rate, including income and social security taxes, is a whopping 40.5 percent. Adding the employer’s social security contributions brings the marginal rate up to 50.7 percent for the average German manufacturing wage earner with no dependents. It’s small wonder, then, that unemployment is nearing the five-million mark.</p></blockquote>
<p>While it is true that Germany has a large public sector and relatively high marginal tax rates.  However, the cost of labor is not the tax rate.  Tax rates place a wedge between the before-tax wage and the after-tax wage with most of the incidence of the tax being borne by workers rather than firms unless the elasticity of labor supply is high (see the latest from <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/07/paul-krugman-on-labor-market.html">Jude Wanniski</a> for evidence that the supply-siders don’t even understand their own model).  Using <a href="http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2005/01/pdf/statappx.pdf">this IMF document</a>, we can examine the changes in wages, prices, and productivity (tables 8 and 9) to compare how unit labor costs have evolved in Germany versus the U.S. since 1997.  Even though the U.S. has enjoyed faster productivity growth than Germany, its unit labor costs have not risen relative to those in the U.S. as earnings growth has been less.  </p>
<p>Kucewicz also notes Germany’s deficit problems and its “anemic private capital investment”.  Both are fair points, but they apply equally to the U.S. situation.  A commitment to long-term fiscal restraint would be welcomed policy – both in Germany and in the U.S.  If the Germans are willing to cut back on the size of their public sector, it might achieve fiscal restraint without large tax increases.  Otherwise, I can understand why Angela Merkel is suggesting tax increases.</p>

<blockquote><p>Of particular concern is the prospect that the upcoming high-level plenary meeting of the UN General Assembly from September 14-16 will be used to implement various ideas for international taxes.</p></blockquote>
<p>Mr. Gaffney is arguing that we need to approve the nomination of Mr. Bolton to the UN.  </p>
<p>To be fair to Mr. Gaffney, the UN proposal is something I had not even thought about.  Gaffney opposes the idea, but let me off a case for it.  President Bush has declared a Global War on Terrorism (GWOT) to combat Al Qaeda (OK, the invasion of Iraq was an incredible blunder, but that’s for another discussion).  The benefits of GWOT would accrue to citizens in all nations (e.g., the UK which had to endure another terrorist incident today).  In a similar vein as Prime Minister Blair’s plea for international cooperation in addressing the problem of global warming, an internationally coordinated effort to fund GWOT might address the problem of free riding.  </p>
<p>I trust Mr. Gaffney agrees that the world community needs to do more to combat Al Qaeda’s terrorism.  I also trust Mr. Gaffney does not think money grows on trees (even if this proposition seems to lie at the heart of free lunch supply-side dogma).  I hope Mr. Gaffney is not proposing that the U.S. free ride GWOT the way we have ignored Kyoto.  Rather than mock Mr. Gaffney, why don’t we liberals ask him how the world should fund GWOT?</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.econbrowser.com/archives/2005/07/should_we_worry.html">James Hamilton</a> has an excellent discussion of why we should be concerned about the large current account deficits, while <a href="http://macroblog.typepad.com/macroblog/2005/07/are_american_co.html">David Altig</a> follows-up with the hope that this borrowing is only temporary.  The point being made by James would have equally applied to the large deficits that followed the Reagan fiscal stimulus a generation ago as they apply today.  During the early 1980’s, apologists for the fiscal stimulus tried to argue that borrowing to finance increases in investment could increase real GDP growth, but the facts were then that investment demand fell but not as much as to the decline in national savings.  James provides a very nice chart showing net investment as a share of GDP from 1965 to 2004 as well as national savings.  Despite the recent recovery of investment, its share of GDP is still quite modest, while the national savings rate is very low.  </p>
<p>David, however, argues that low interest rates are not indicative of a “consumption binge”.  While he notes the global savings glut hypothesis, his discussion is consistent with the driving factor being a decline in investment demand.  In a way, David is hinting at the old Keynesian paradox of thrift justification for short-term fiscal stimulus.  Sensible Keynesians, such as Robert Rubin, might continue by saying short-term stimulus might be good policy during a transitional investment slump, but the Bush call for long-term fiscal stimulus is not a pro-growth agenda.  Simply put – as this transitional slump in investment demand reverses itself, the Federal Reserve will be compelled to raise interest rates if the fiscal stimulus is not reversed.  Over the long-term, the extra consumption does crowd-out both investment and net exports.  <br />
