                                <p>Making a slow return to actually reading the news, I enjoyed coming across this week&#8217;s <a href="http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB115340136858912360-LDQXnJsw5D_CgRc5fZ_EuSYQiiI_20070720.html">Econoblog</a> , which revists the hot topic of 2004: whether the world&#8217;s financial imbalances will be corrected via a hard or soft landing.  Nouriel Roubini and David Altig discuss the modest revaluation of the yuan that we&#8217;ve seen over the past year, and the prospects for more of the same.  </p>
<p>For my money, however, the most interesting line in their exchange came right at the end.  David wrote:<br />
<blockquote>I have to say that my opinions have not much changed since Nouriel and I first debated the hard-landing/soft-landing scenarios back in March 2005. True, we are further on up the road, with scant movement toward the rebalancing of trade and capital flows that both of us agreed would have to occur at some point. That might be troubling, but the tipping point just does not feel like it is creeping any closer.</p></blockquote>
<p>David makes a fair point &#8211; and I agree with him that it does not feel like we&#8217;re getting closer to some sort of crisis.  However, I also must wonder this: what should we expect it to feel like?</p>

                                <p>I wonder if <a href="http://www.opinionjournal.com/columnists/pnoonan/?id=110008676">Peggy Noonan</a> thinks that is the fault of economist for the incessant free lunch spin that comes from the right as if no one has ever suggested that the law of scarcity applies to the macroeconomy at least in the long-run.  Oh no, we economists never say there is such a thing as crowding-out.  OK, her topic was really global warming.  As <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2006/07/20/blame-the-scientists">Judd</a> at ThinkProgress notes, Peggy wrote:<br />
<blockquote>I got thinking, again, of how sad and frustrating it is that the world&#8217;s greatest scientists cannot gather, discuss the question of global warming, pore over all the data from every angle, study meteorological patterns and temperature histories, and come to a believable conclusion on these questions: Is global warming real or not? If it is real, is it necessarily dangerous? What exactly are the dangers? Is global warming as dangerous as, say, global cooling would be? Are we better off with an Earth that is getting hotter or, what with the modern realities of heating homes and offices, and the world energy crisis, and the need to conserve, does global heating have, in fact, some potential side benefits, and can those benefits be broadened and deepened? Also, if global warning is real, what must – must &#8211; the inhabitants of the Earth do to meet its challenges? And then what should they do to meet them? You would think the world&#8217;s greatest scientists could do this, in good faith and with complete honesty and a rigorous desire to discover the truth. And yet they can&#8217;t. Because science too, like other great institutions, is poisoned by politics. Scientists have ideologies. They are politicized.</p></blockquote>
<p>Peggy must have the know-nothings at the National Review confused with scientists.  Ah Peggy, next time that you are reading something from Lawrence Kudlow, realize that he is very politicized and that he is not an economist.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://mediamatters.org/items/200607200011">Media Matters</a> listens to Rush Limbaugh so we don’t have to:<br />
<blockquote>Additionally, Limbaugh claimed that, in light of scientists&#8217; belief that embryonic stem cells could be useful in medicine, &#8220;we need to re-examine this whole term &#8216;scientist,&#8217; &#8221; because &#8220;[s]cience is all about politics, and science has been so wrong about so many things.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>By working closely with Congress &#8211; and by threatening vetoes when they were called for &#8211; discretionary spending has been kept in check and there hasn&#8217;t been a need to veto a spending bill</p></blockquote>
<p>And yet the same article tells us how fiscal conservatives are claiming just the opposite.  The Cato chart shows discretionary defense spending rising from just under $300 billion in 2000 to just under $500 billion in 2005.  It also shows an increase in discretionary non-defense spending over the same period that was equal to approximately 45%.  To be fair, nominal GDP increased by 27% over this same period.  Even as a share of GDP, discretionary non-defense spending has increased.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.ssa.gov/legislation/medicareregs.html">Social Security Online</a> has a summary of the “New Medicare Part D Subsidy”, which begins with:<br />
<blockquote>The Medicare Modernization Act (MMA) established a new voluntary Part D Prescription Drug Program effective January 1, 2006. While the overall responsibility for development and administration of this new program resides with CMS, the statute also requires SSA to take applications and determine eligibility for a new subsidy program. This subsidy will reduce out of pocket costs paid by those Part D enrollees who have limited income (below 150% of the poverty line applicable to the size of the family involved) and resources (up to $10,000 in assets for an individual or $20,000 for a married couple) by providing reduced monthly premiums and other cost-sharing assistance.</p></blockquote>
<p>Indeed, President Bush is going around the national telling seniors that there is some free lunch as the government is subsidizing their health care even as President Bush is telling the rest of us that he is cutting our (current) taxes.  OK, the reality is that this subsidy is increasing our already massive deferred tax liabilities.  </p>
<p>Economists often describe <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_incidence">tax incidence</a> in terms of who ultimately pays the tax.  Similarly, one could ask how much of the incidence of this subsidy accrues to patients versus the suppliers of pharmaceutical products.  <a href="http://beatthepress.blogspot.com/2006/07/drug-companies-gone-wild-medicare-part.html">Dean Baker</a> suggests we read the article by <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/18/business/18place.html">Milt Freudenheim</a>: <br />
<blockquote>The pharmaceutical industry is beginning to reap a windfall from a surprisingly lucrative niche market: drugs for poor people. And analysts expect the benefits to show up in many of the quarterly financial results that drug makers will begin posting this week. The windfall, which by some estimates could be $2 billion or more this year, is a result of the transfer of millions of low-income people into the new Medicare Part D drug program that went into effect in January. Under that program, as it turns out, the prices paid by insurers, and eventually the taxpayer, for the medications given to those transferred are likely to be higher than what was paid under the federal-state Medicaid programs for the poor … It is too early to calculate the full effect of the shift of the former Medicaid patients now covered by Part D. But analysts expect it to generate hundreds of millions of additional dollars this year for the drug companies, which have long chafed under the pricing restraints of the state programs. Drugs tend to be cheaper under the Medicaid programs because the states are the buyers and by law they receive the lowest available prices for drugs. But in creating the federal Part D program, Congress &#8211; in what critics saw as a sop to the drug industry &#8211; barred the government from having a negotiating role. Instead, prices are worked out between drug makers and the dozens of large and small Part D drug plans run by commercial insurers. Since Part D went into effect, the pharmaceutical industry has raised the wholesale prices of its brand-name drugs an average of 3.6 percent. Although the actual amount spent depends on what each insurer negotiates, in many cases the drugs for those 6.5 million people who used to receive their medicines through Medicaid will cost more now. Initially, the added costs will be paid by the insurers administering the new Medicare drug program. But when it comes time for the insurers to settle accounts with the government, the costs of the 6.5 million drugs for the transferees will end up being passed along to federal taxpayers, according to analysts and health care economists. The windfall for the drug makers was made possible by a provision of the 2003 Medicare law that exempts Part D drugs from “best price” rebates that the drug makers have been required to give to the state Medicaid programs since 1991. Those rebates are meant to make sure that state Medicaid agencies pay no more than the best prices drug companies offer to any big commercial insurer.</p></blockquote>
<p>One of the complaints of fiscal conservatives was that Medicare Part D was too expensive.  Perhaps part of the problem lies in how its pricing was established so as to increase the incidence of the subsidy that would go to the pharmaceutical companies.</p>

<blockquote>Now he&#8217;s shilling for Americans United for (state your cause here). Its cause du jour &#8211; actually, a return to the group&#8217;s 2005 fight &#8211; is Social Security. That&#8217;s as in preserving, protecting and defending a quite onerous Big Government bait-and-switch racket that would make Charles K. Ponzi, father of the Ponzi scheme, most proud. How any educated person can believe that the current Social Security program &#8211; which, unaltered, goes belly up in 36 years &#8211; is anywhere close to sustainable surely is an exercise in believing that one can wipe with the water and wash with the towel … Among the first pols to be targeted by the barkers for socialistic preservation is Sen. Rick Santorum, in the fight of his political life against state Treasurer Bobby Casey Jr., who has never met an issue to which he couldn&#8217;t perform a sterling Gene Kelly salute. Granted, economics is not Mr. Santorum&#8217;s strong suit. How could it be, given his love of price controls (in the form of gasoline anti-price gouging and anti-&#8220;unfair pricing&#8221; legislation), his support of a higher minimum wage, his backing of the boondoggle that is Pittsburgh&#8217;s North Shore Connector and an expansive plan to subsidize higher education that will only encourage every college and university to jack up prices? But on Social Security, Santorum&#8217;s right on the money … Where does one begin? How about simply, courtesy of Dan Lips, a policy adviser with the Americans for Prosperity Foundation, in a 2005 commentary for National Review Online: &#8220;Without reform, a 30-year-old worker today should expect a 27-percent benefit cut at their retirement party in 2042. This is despite the fact that one out of every eight dollars he or she earns over a half-century in the work force will be paid into Social Security.&#8221; … Phased-in Social Security privatization &#8211; personal accounts earning market rates of return &#8211; is the only answer. Senior citizens aren&#8217;t affected. And because returns from privatized accounts on their worst modern-era day outstrip Social Security&#8217;s negligible returns, a very modest tax on those increased earnings, set aside in a true trust fund &#8211; not a drawer full of IOUs on which the current system rests &#8211; can serve the least fortunate among us. </p></blockquote>
<p>Ah yes, McNickle is a member of the Cato free lunches for everyone crowd as he claims one a better return on one’s investment without realizing that this higher expected return is simply the compensation for bearing more risk.  And I guess he does not realize that the Bush privatization plan will reduce the 30-year-old worker’s benefit by even more than 27%.  But I agree with McNickle that economics is not Senator Santorum’s strong suit as I have to wonder about the degree in economics that McNickle received from National Review University. </p>
<p>But since McNickle brought up <a href="http://www.americansunitedforchange.org/press/releases/au_calls_on_santorum_to_rebuke_president_for_proposing_again_to_privatize_s">Americans United</a>, let me thank them for the email as I pass along their question to the Senator contained in the email’s press release:<br />
<blockquote>In response to the frothing of the mouth diatribe today from Colin McNickle, editorial page director for the Pittsburg Tribune-Review, Americans United, the group which derailed President Bush’s effort to privatize Social Security in 2005, asked Senator Rick Santorum (R-PA) if he agrees with one of Pennsylvania’s largest newspapers and one of his most ardent supporters that Social Security is “a quite onerous Big Government bait-and-switch racket that would make Charles K. Ponzi, father of the Ponzi scheme, most proud.”</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>NPR had a piece this morning warning of a shortage of agricultural workers in California. It reported that some crops may rot in the field, if farmers there can&#8217;t get more workers by the end of the summer. Those of us who believe in markets would suggest that the farmers try raising wages. It is possible that some of the crops being farmed now in California would not be profitable, if farmers had to pay the wage necessary to attract workers in the current market (or if they had to pay the market price for water). In a market economy, that means that the farmers made bad choices on crop choices. That&#8217;s unfortunate for the farmers, but that&#8217;s how markets work.</p></blockquote>
<p>First of all – my apologies for my opening snark as I’m a loyal NPR listener.  But Dean is right – the market solution to a labor shortage is higher wages.  But consider this discussion in light of the move on behalf of some to toss immigrants out of the country.  If their efforts succeed, we’d have fewer agricultural workers in California, which would mean an even larger wage increase.</p>

                                <p>On the <a href="http://www.niemanwatchdog.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=background.view&#038;backgroundid=00103">Neiman Watchdog</a> we see Lieutenant General William E. Odom, U.S. Army (Ret.) writing this:<br />
<blockquote>Cheney has it exactly backwards. Our continued entanglement is what is destabilizing the region. The escalating conflict between Israel and Hezbollah and Hamas could become a new Arab-Israeli War. And it is precisely our actions in Iraq that have opened the door for Iran and Syria to support Hezbollah and Hamas actions without much to fear from the U.S. Cheney’s assertion is a new version of the old domino theory which was invented to justify the U.S. military involvement in Vietnam &#8230; the larger U.S. aim, the containment of China, was achieved, in spite of the United States, by Soviet and North Vietnamese actions against China. And the dire consequences of the domino theory that were so widely proclaimed by hawks at the time never came to pass. We should have learned a number of things from the Vietnam War, but most of all that unintended consequences are often the most significant outcomes.  Our well-intended policies in Vietnam soon rendered the United States incapable of accomplishing anything positive in the region &#8230; Is the domino theory valid for the Middle East? No, not any more than it was in Vietnam. But a reverse domino theory is. The longer the U.S. stays in Iraq, the more likely the collapse of the secular regimes in those Muslim nations, and the more likely a full-scale war between Israel and its neighbors. It’s American departure from Iraq that could prevent it.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2006/07/16/rice-grotesque/">Amanda</a> was watching Condi Rice on ABC’s This Week so we didn’t have to:<br />
<blockquote>STEPHANOPOULOS: But before the war in Iraq many argued that going into Iraq would stir up a hornet’s nest. The administration strongly disagreed and here’s what Vice President Cheney had to say in August 2002. <br />CHENEY (VIDEO): I believe the opposite is true. Regime change in Iraq would bring about a number of benefits to the region, extremists in the region would have to rethink their strategy of jihad, moderates throughout the region would take heart, and our ability to advance the Israeli/Palestinian peace process would be enhanced. <br />STEPHANOPOULOS: Extremists now appear to have been emboldened. The moderates appear to be in retreat. There is no peace process. There is war. How do you answer administration critics who say that the administration’s actions have unleashed, have helped unleash the very hostilities you hoped to contain? <br />RICE: Well, first of all, those hostilities were not very well contained as we found out on September 11th, so the notion that policies that finally confront extremism are actually causing extremism, I find grotesque.</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s a pity that our Secretary of State happens to be Clueless Condi.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Another <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2006/07/17/neocons-middle-east-war">ThinkProgress</a> post begins with:<br />
<blockquote>In 1996, Richard Perle, Douglas Feith and David Wurmser (all later senior officials in the Bush administration) had a plan for how to destroy Hezbollah: Invade Iraq. They wrote a report to the newly elected Likud government in Israel calling for “a clean break” with the policies of negotiating with the Palestinians and trading land for peace &#8230; Now, with the U.S. bogged down in Iraq, with Bush losing control of world events, and with the threats to national security growing worse, no one could possibly still believe this plan, could they? Think again.</p></blockquote>
<p>We have seen Newt Gingrich, William Kristol, and the National Review’s chicken hawks all giddy about World War III over the past several days.  And if we go back to the 2000 Presidential campaign, recall Condi Rice was advising the government of Israel not to work with President Clinton  as he attempt to have Israel negotiate with the Palestinians in terms trading land for peace.  It is all making sense now – especially given that Karl Rove needs something to salvage the GOP majority in Congress in the upcoming 2006 elections.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.firedoglake.com/2006/07/16/dont-blame-me">Christy</a> covered Robert Novak’s latest dissembling on Meet the Press.  Given the fact that Russert was running the interview, Novak felt free to lie whenever it served his purposes.  The last part of the interview was reported by Christy thusly:<br />
<blockquote>Novak says he doesn’t think he outed Valerie – thinks Aldrich Ames did so previously. [CHS:  There are so many things wrong with that statement, starting with the fact that Ames, if in fact that is even true which I doubt, would have outed her within an intel context, and Novak publicly printed the information which outed her…well, publicly.  Which is a whole other level of outing, now isn’t it?  Let alone the fact that, as I recall, there has been a lot of dispute about any claim that Ames outed Valerie previously.  The CYA Reputation Rehab Tour continues.]</p></blockquote>
<p>How many times have we heard this excuse before?  Cliff May wants you to believe that we all knew Wilson’s wife was a covert agent many years ago because hubbie told us so.  Then again – the National Review crowd and Mr. Novak also claims she was not a covert agent.  </p>
<p><a href="http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10C13F73E5B0C728DDDA90994DB404482">Nicholas Kristoff</a> did write this:<br />
<blockquote>First, the C.I.A. suspected that Aldrich Ames had given Mrs. Wilson&#8217;s name (along with those of other spies) to the Russians before his espionage arrest in 1994. So her undercover security was undermined at that time, and she was brought back to Washington for safety reasons. Second, as Mrs. Wilson rose in the agency, she was already in transition away from undercover work to management, and to liaison roles with other intelligence agencies. So this year, even before she was outed, she was moving away from &#8220;noc&#8221; &#8211; which means non-official cover, like pretending to be a business executive. After passing as an energy analyst for Brewster-Jennings &#038; Associates, a C.I.A. front company, she was switching to a new cover as a State Department official, affording her diplomatic protection without having &#8220;C.I.A.&#8221; stamped on her forehead.</p></blockquote>
<p>There are two problems with this story.  As <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2003_10/002395.php">Kevin Drum</a> noted on October 11, 2003:<br />
<blockquote>One more thing, though: Kristof really ought to tell us in general terms who his source for this column is. Someone in the CIA? Someone in the White House trying to downplay the damage? Plame&#8217;s next door neighbor? Since this story has been all about spin and counterspin from the very beginning, knowing where the spin is coming from is a crucial part of any story.</p></blockquote>
<p>Secondly, the name <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brewster_Jennings_&#038;_Associates">Brewster-Jennings &#038; Associates</a> was first registered in 1994 and had served as the front name for several CIA operatives for the next nine years when Novak outed this company as a front to cover his rear end in the aftermath of his July 14, 2003 outing of the fact that Valerie Plame was a CIA agent. </p>
<p>If Aldrich had already given up Brewster-Jennings, why would the CIA continue to use it as the cover for its agents?</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/worldlatest/story/0,,-5953349,00.html">Leslie Miller</a> notes the debate on the privatization of American toll roads:<br />
<blockquote>WASHINGTON (AP) &#8211; Roads and bridges built by U.S. taxpayers are starting to be sold off, and so far foreign-owned companies are doing the buying &#8230; Some experts welcome the trend. Robert Poole, transportation director for the conservative think tank Reason Foundation, said private investors can raise more money than politicians to build new roads because these kind of owners are willing to raise tolls. &#8220;They depoliticize the tolling decision,&#8221; Poole said &#8230; John Foote, senior fellow at Harvard&#8217;s Kennedy School of Government, said the government can take over a highway in an emergency. But he objects to selling roads to raise cash.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.reason.org/poole.shtml">Robert Poole</a> has been pushing this idea ever since his <a href="http://www.reason.org/ps111.pdf">1988 paper</a>, which yielded support for= California&#8217;s landmark private tollway law (AB 680), which authorized four pilot toll projects including the successful 91 Express Lanes in Orange County.  His paper does a nice job of summarizing William Vickrey’s <a href="http://www.vtpi.org/vickrey.htm">Principles of Efficient Congestion Pricing</a>.</p>
<p>Poole also advocates that the toll roads be privately owned rather than publicly owned for specious reasons as far as I can tell – and certainly a different view from that of <a href="http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/002282.html">Max Sawicky</a>:<br />
<blockquote>The Gov could just as easily contract out operations and management, but keep the tolls for itself. The fact that the money is earmarked to new projects &#8211; investment &#8211; is irrelevant. It&#8217;s still borrowing. You could just as easily keep the roads and float a bond &#8211; also borrowing &#8211; for the new projects. The leasing is not necessary. The political onus against explicit borrowing can warp decisions.</p></blockquote>
<p>Is Max and Poole assuming the toll rates will be set optimally in terms of a Vickrey model?  We will return to the question of whether actual toll rates are set optimally, but note <a href="http://www.becker-posner-blog.com/archives/2006/06/privatizing_the.html">Richard Posner</a> countered:<br />
<blockquote>Against all this it will be argued &#8211; it is an argument emphasized by opponents of leasing the Indiana Toll Road &#8211; that privatization, at least when it takes the form of a sale or long-term lease of government property for a lump sum, beggars the future by depriving government of an income-producing asset. The argument, at least in its simplest form, is unsound, because the state is not disposing of an asset but merely changing its form: from a highway to cash.</p></blockquote>
<p>Posner is assuming that the government received as much in terms of the purchase price as it would have received in terms of the present value of future tolls.  As you may recall, I have <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/06/indiana-toll-road-efficiency-gains.html">my doubts</a>. Posner and <a href="http://www.becker-posner-blog.com/archives/2006/06/on_privatizing_1.html">Gary Becker</a> discussed efficiency issues that went well beyond the claim that the private sector runs things more cheaply, which brings me to the testimony of John H. Foote (Senior Fellow, Mossavar-Rahmani Center for Business and Government, Kennedy School of Government before the <a href="http://www.house.gov/transportation/highway/06-05-24/Foote.pdf">Highways, Transit and Pipelines Subcommittee of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee </a>:<br />
<blockquote>It is also supposed that the people who use the Skyway are winners because the private owner will provide better service than the City, such as the introduction of electronic toll collection. While it is true that the long-awaited electronic tolling was implemented by the private owner, this service enhancement could have been implemented by the City as has been the case with dozens of publicly-owned toll roads in the United States. There are many examples of public toll roads being operated efficiently and with an eye to service. Better service is not a good reason, in most cases, to privatize our highways. While there are winners, there are also losers. In the case of the Skyway, the losers are the Skyway users who will be paying significantly higher tolls than they would have paid under City ownership. The other loser is the region. First, the Skyway users: Under private ownership and with the agreement of the City, tolls on the Skyway will more than double in the next twelve years and continue to increase through the term of the concession. The increased revenues resulting from these toll increases will be used by the private owner to service the debt and equity that financed the $1.8 billion purchase price. In effect, the future tolls collected on the Skyway have been monetized to fund the operating budget of the City of Chicago. Further, the toll proposition is based on the users’ willingness to pay a toll in return for receiving a service. In this case, users will see ever increasing tolls and ever increasing revenues being banked by the private investor, with, at best, only modest improvements in service. Interestingly, the City has required the private investor to file annual financial reports for Skyway—we can only conjecture about public’s reaction in ten years when the sale proceeds have been spent but the earnings of the private investor continue to increase in step with higher tolls. The other loser is the region. First, not one dollar of the sale proceeds realized by the Chicago was earmarked for investment in transportation projects, despite the fact that Chicago is one the country’s most congested urban areas. The City also has abdicated the control of a major transportation artery and along with it the ability to manage the regional transportation network in a coordinated fashion. To see how this might adversely impact the public interest, it is important to recognize that the private investor’s sole motive is profit maximization. That is not a bad thing, but it does color how the toll road will be managed. Let me cite two illustrations of this point: Under the concession agreement, the private owner has the ability to use time of day pricing to discourage trucks from using the Skyway during day time hours. One possible consequence of this is to force trucks onto neighboring roads, generating externalities—traffic, congestion and pollution—for which the private owner is not accountable and does not have to concern itself. Second, the alternative routes for drivers who do not want to use the Skyway are non-tolled limited access roads that are operating currently at or near capacity, thus allowing Skyway to operate, in effect, as a monopoly. Even if it was believed that lower tolls on the Skyway would lessen congestion on the alternative routes, the private investor, again, is motivated only by maximizing revenues on its road. And what happens if the decision is made in the next several years to toll these alternative free roads in order to manage congestion? To do this effectively requires a coherent and coordinated regional toll policy. With Skyway out of the public’s control, this is no longer possible. Further the imposition of tolls on these free roads will likely increase the revenues to be realized by the private owner with no subsidiary benefit to the region. </p></blockquote>
<p>Foote was more complimentary to the Indiana toll road proposal and he finished with:</p>
<blockquote><p>The last point I want to make is that it is important for all of us to understand why investors are willing to pay large sums for these concessions. The reason is simply that these investors have been granted a franchise to increase tolls &#8211; an action that state and local governments are reluctant to take. The last toll increase on the Skyway was in 1993 and on the Indiana Tollroad in 1986. In both cases, the new owners, pursuant to agreements with the City and the State, will increase tolls immediately upon signing the concession agreements and every year thereafter for the term of the concessions. These increases are not be subject to voter approval, and are the consequence of what has been tagged, the outsourcing of political will.</p></blockquote>
<p>Outsourcing of political will reminds me of the Brad DeLong line about feckless politicians.  The only real advantage to selling our roads to foreign firms seems to be that our politicians do not have the courage to raise toll rates to the Vickrey optimal price.  Heck – Congress wants to lower fuel taxes even as we are concerned we consume too much oil.  But if we turn over pricing to a monopolist, we will likely see toll charges in excess of the Vickrey optimal price – unless governments put restrictions on these toll rates.  Of course, if the toll rates are regulated, private firms will offer less for these rights.</p>
