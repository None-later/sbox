                                <p>Regular readers may recall I had a series of posts on how the Fed tries to influence elections.  Results are summarized <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/03/fed-presidential-elections-and_2345.html">here</a>.  While the previous posts looked at  the Fed’s behavior going back to 1959 (data on M1 and M2 on the Fed’s website goes back to 1959), today’s post deals with the Alan Greenspan years.  I have a hunch that Greenspan was the kind of guy to blatantly meddle in elections.</p>
<p>I know, its crazy talk but humor me &#8211; put on your tin-foil hat and let’s pursue this hunch for a moment.  What would it imply?  Considering that Greenspan is a firm believer in Ayn Rand’s nonsense, we’d expect Greenspan to favor Republicans over Democrats – all else being equal, we’d expect to see unusually tight money when an incumbent Democratic president ran for re-election or a sitting Democratic VP ran for President, and unusually loose money when an incumbent Republican ran for re-election or a sitting Republican VP ran for President.  However, not all elections are close, so the Uncle Alan would feel more of an urge to meddle when elections are close.</p>
<p>(As an aside, the purpose of the Fed is maintain the money supply just right – it issues enough new money to lubricate the economy, but not enough to cause a recession.  If it sees inflation on the horizon, it tightens up; if it sees a recession, it pumps money into the economy.)</p>
<p>Therefore, in the five elections that took place under Greenspan’s watch, we’d expect the most meddling in 1992 and 1996 (when the Republican candidate clearly lost in a competitive election), followed by 2000 (when the Republican candidate lost the popular vote but only by a smidge).  We’d expect the 2004 elections when the Republican candidate won by a few percentage points to involve less meddling.  We wouldn’t expect much if any intervention in 1988 considering that the Democrats nominated Michael Dukakis who proceeded to euthanize his own campaign without any intervention from the Fed.  Another reason not to expect unusual behavior in 1988 – Mr. G had only taken office the year before, and perhaps was still unsure of how far the envelope could be pushed.</p>
<p>And where we would look to see evidence of the Fed’s behavior?  Well, the Fed could move the fed funds rate or it can move M1 (cash and its equivalents).  M1 has several advantages over the fed funds rate:  nobody really pays attention to M1 whereas every change in the fed funds rate is literally national news, the Fed can move M1 every day if it chooses, and its effect is more widely dispersed throughout the economy.  For a subtle guy like Big Al, M1 is the tool of choice.</p>
<p>So what do we see?  The graph below shows the percentage change in real GDP per capita and the percentage change in real M1 per capita in November of each year of the Greenspan tenure as Fed Chairman.  </p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RghbvUYJ1CI/AAAAAAAAAJ0/_ukVF7od1iw/s1600-h/Greenspan+1,+Chart+1.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RghbvUYJ1CI/AAAAAAAAAJ0/_ukVF7od1iw/s320/Greenspan+1,+Chart+1.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Let’s look at each election year in turn.  1988 is the year we don’t really expect to see the Fed doing anything unusual.  And we don’t.</p>
<p>What about 1992?  In 1992 not only was monetary policy extremely loose (data on Money Supply from the Fed’s website goes back to 1959 and 1992 was the second loosest year in terms of money supply in the entire sample!), it was loose for no particular reason.  After all, the economy was actually growing faster in 1992 than at any other point in the GHW administration.  </p>
<p>How about 1996?  1996 saw the single biggest decline in real M1 per capita in all the years going back to 1959.  Sure, the economy was growing at a good clip, but it was only the 17th fastest growing year in the sample.  One might argue that in 1996 the Fed was anticipating irrational exuberance, but then why it would ease up on the throttle in 1997 and 1998?</p>
<p>If 1996 saw the single biggest decline in real M1 per capita in all the years going back to 1959, the year 2000 saw the second biggest decline.  And this despite a slowing in the economy.  </p>
<p>Anyone seeing a pattern here?  Three consecutive elections coincidentally having three of the biggest moves in the Fed’s most important tool ever observed.  Alan Greenspan truly was a man of extremes around election times, at least when those elections didn’t favor Republican candidates.  </p>
<p>What about 2004?  2004 doesn’t seem to be have particularly loose monetary policy, despite our cynical prediction.  But perhaps it occurred to Mr. Greenspan that after 3 consecutive elections with extreme jumps in real M1 per capita, it might make sense to use another tool for once.  And it just so happens that the real fed funds rate, the fed funds rate less inflation, was negative 1.59, and the third lowest in the sample.  (Compare that to negative 0.77 in 2003, when the economy was actually struggling but there was no election.)  </p>
<p>So what do we conclude?  Under Alan Greenspan, the Fed’s behavior around the time of Presidential elections has been precisely what a raving conspiracy theory believing lunatic would predict.  Its hard to believe the Fed Chair can behave like a James Bond villain, but this is my tenth post on the subject, and the numbers always seem to say the same thing, no matter what figures I use or how I look at the data.  So I’m left with no choice but to quote a James Bond villain.  As Goldfinger once told 007:</p>
<blockquote><p>[T]hey have a saying in Chicago: “Once is happenstance. Twice is coincidence. The third time it’s enemy action.” </p></blockquote>
<p>I wonder what Goldfinger’s friends in Chicago would say about the fourth and fifth time.  But I do know that if we as a nation don’t hold Greenspan accountable for this, we should expect more of this from Bernanke in 2008.  In fact, we will deserve it.</p>

<p>Update.  </p>
<p>James K. Galbraith reminds me in e-mail, and Archer points out in comments, that the Fed&#8217;s actions in 1992 did have some justification.   To quote Archer:</p>
<blockquote><p>Actually, there was a very big reason: the banking industry. <br />The whole industry had taken a huge hit between the S&#038;L crisis and LBO lending gone sour. The industry was badly undercapitalized. </p>
<p>In my mind, Greenspan&#8217;s finest (perhaps only) accomplishment was engineering and maintaining a very very steep yield curve in the early 1990s. It was a massive subsidy to the banking industry that went largely unnoticed at the time. Hence the reason for continued loose money despite economic growth.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p>Update 2.  I&#8217;ve had several people point out that there are lags between changes in the money supply and movements in the economy.  This is one of those urban myths, like supply side economics, that everyone knows is true but doesn&#8217;t hold up when one looks at the data.  And in this case, I looked at the data not long ago in another post.  <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/03/fed-presidential-elections-and_22.html">Table 3</a> shows the correlation between changes in real M1 per capita and real GDP per capita.  In general, there is an -87.5% correlation occuring in real time (i.e., a change in real M1 per capita and a change in real GDP per capita occur in the same quarter).   </p>
<p>The table also shows&#8230;  in election years, changes in the real money supply can lead changes in the economy.  This may be because the Fed is pulling out all stops:  jawboning, moral suasion or guidance at the monthly regional meetings, and perhaps even messing with the required reserve ratio.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p>Update 3.  Corrected the link in Update 2.  My bad.  Also, rephrased update 2 to (hopefully) make it clearer.</p>

<p><a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/03/more-from-heritage.html">ILSM</a> discusses something from <a href="http://www.heritage.org/Research/features/issues/issuearea/Defense.cfm">Baker Spring</a> of the Heritage Foundation who writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>On February 6, the Bush Administration submitted its fiscal year 2007 defense budget request to Congress. The $439.3 billion in budget authority requested for FY 2007 represents an increase of $28.5 billion (about 7 percent) over the enacted level for 2006. The FY 2006 enacted level, however, does not include a request for supplemental appropriations for defense. Thus, the precise level of increase or decrease in the overall Department of Defense budget from FY 2006 is uncertain &#8230; The U.S. needs to ensure that its armed forces receive sufficient funding. While funding levels should be determined by needs and requirements, they could be established at 4 percent of GDP without harming the U.S. economy.</p></blockquote>
<p>Baker Spring thinks he is advocating an increase in defense spending that he would fund by cuts in transfer payments such as Social Security benefits, Medicare, and Medicaid.  The Bureau of Economic Analysis, however, notes that Federal defense spending for calendar year 2006 was $621 billion or 4.7% of GDP.  But if you take a look at his chart 1 – you would have thought we were spending a lot less.  I’d like to correct the record in two ways.  First, our graph shows defense spending as a share of GDP using the data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis.  Our chart certainly paints a different picture than the chart provided by Baker Spring.  Of course, one could argue that the defense spending/GDP ratio of later was less than it was during the Korean War.   But as I noted <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/03/defense-spending-2005-v-1953.html">here</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our graph shows defense spending (as reported by the Bureau of Economic Analysis) was 4.73% of GDP in 2005. In 1953, it was 14.73% of GDP. Then again real GDP in 2005 was about 5.3 times higher than real GDP in 1953. So after adjusting for inflation, it would seem we were spending 70% more in absolute terms in 2005 than we were in 1953 at the height of the Korean War.</p></blockquote>
<p>The folks at Heritage don’t seem to know whether they want more defense spending or less as they don’t seem to have a clue as to how much we are spending on defense.</p>

<div>From NY Post 26 Mar 07, Peter Brookes, Heritage Foundation:</div>
<div>Prior to the following statement the author goes through a litany of issues which could, the art of the improbable possible extremely remotely, involve US military force. Including: Iran, Korea and the Formosa Straits.</div>
<div>“It&#8217;s hard to believe, but U.S. defense spending remains at historic lows as a percentage of gross domestic product, despite the large budgets since 9/11. This isn&#8217;t good for our national security &#8211; or fair to our fighting men and women. It&#8217;s encouraging to adversaries.”</div>
<div>Somehow Brookes thinks for al Qaeda, he says we are weak in their view because we are only spending as much as when we were fighting the North Vietnamese, and holding PRC and USSR at bay. Totally irrelevant statement, as if we should let al Qaeda tell us how much money to send to Heritage’s sponsors.</div>
<div>Then he assumes everyone does think as he does..</div>
<div>“There&#8217;s plenty of blame to go around. Finger-pointing makes for good political sport, but fixing the problem instead of assigning blame is what counts. Congress needs to act quickly. Raising and maintaining our armed forces is its constitutional duty. Anything less than giving our military the wherewithal to take on the challenges to our national security in unacceptable &#8211; and dangerous. “</div>
<div>“Unacceptable, dangerous”, what an extension of the baseless blither.</p>

<p>Proudly Presenting:  One of The Nation&#8217;s 21 Primary Broker Dealers</p>
<p>Anyone wonder why I was a little cranky about the Federal Reserve splashing out short term loans to its coterie of 21 primary broker/dealers lately?  Here an example of one of these anointed few, talking hyped-up nonsense on television:</p>
<p>1.  On March 21, 2007 Morgan Stanley’s CFO David Sidwell went on CNN Money with the message that his firm’s exposure to sub-prime mortgages was minimal, and would cause no damage to the firm.  Shares of Morgan Stanley (up $3.16 to $79.27) jumped 4 percent in midday trading.  <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2007/03/21/news/companies/morgan_stanley/index.htm?postversion=2007032112">Morgan Stanley: No Subprime Hit</a></p>
<p>2.  On March 23, 2007, Morgan Stanley puts on a fire sale of the sub-prime mortgages it took as collateral from floundering lender New Century:  “Morgan Stanley is in the process of holding an auction for $2.48 billion in mortgages from subprime lender New Century&#8230;It announced the sale of the 13,200 loans in a small public auction notice in a print ad Friday [Mar. 23]&#8230; A Morgan spokeswoman declined to comment. <br /><a href="http://www.nypost.com/seven/03262007/business/morgans_new_century_fire_sale_business_roddy_boyd.htm">Morgan’s New Century Fire Sale</a> by Roddy Boyd, The New York Post Mar. 26 2007</p>
<p>Do you really and truly believe Morgan Stanley is dumping those mortgages because they’re a good investment for somebody else and not for themselves?  Ha.  All the banks are on the hook for bad loans, across the board, in my opinion, and lying about it.  </p>
<p>Question:  Are the robbers on the outside of America ’s banks looking in, or inside looking out?</p>

                                <p>Far be it from me to agree with the National Review or Fred Thompson, but if <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=ZTdjZTZjY2MxZTA3ZGU1OGE5Njg3NTlhM2EwNzYxMWQ=">this</a> is accurate, and there is a ridiculous amount of pork in the emergency war funding bill, its a very bad thing.  Why should we a guy like me who has come to distrust Republicans support Democrats if they&#8217;re just going to go Washington and behave like Republicans?</p>
<p>In a kind of unrelated note &#8211; why is there an emergency war funding bill?  Four years into the war, funding it using it supplementals is an abuse of the system by the administration.  What right does the administration to leave funding for the war out of the budget?</p>

                                <p>Reader Susan Webber reminds me to go read the Naked Capitalist.  <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2007/03/toothless-fed.html">This post</a> is fascinating.</p>
<blockquote><p>[T]he Fed has basically admitted that its powers [to stem a crisis &#8211; inserted by cactus] are limited due to the extent of financial activity that takes place outside its purview (the Fed supervises federally-chartered banks; securities firms, which are regulated by the SEC and hedge funds, which are not regulated as far as their investments or solvency is concerned, are increasingly the key players in the credit markets). </p></blockquote>
<p>Regular readers may recall I&#8217;ve had a few posts on the Fed&#8217;s behavior around election time.  (I&#8217;m working on one right now looking specifically at the Greenspan Fed&#8217;s behavior around elecition time that seems to me to be a lot more damning and clearcut than anything I&#8217;ve had up so far.  Interestingly enough, the Fed&#8217;s ability to influence elections, like its ability to stem disasters (Don Marek reminded me of the so called<br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plunge_Protection_Team">&#8220;Plunge Protection Team&#8221;</a> in comments to another post), may be somewhat limited.  As a preview of the post I&#8217;m working on, I note that the big fluctuations in real M1 per capita in the Greenspan era occurred in 1992, 1996, and 2000 &#8211; years in which the Republicans lost (at the least the popular vote) in a Presidential election.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>I grew up in car country, many of the men in my small town commuted to assembly and parts plants near the city, and any self-respecting 12 year old boy could hold forth on the relative merits of various V-8 engines (my favorite was the Chevy 283 cu in).</p>
<p>At that time the Big 3 owned the market, with minor competition from AMC, Jeep and Volkswagen. Foreign cars were novelties or the toys of the wealthy.</p>
<p>In the 70s the Big 3 received some messages. First was the oil shock. Then small foreign-made cars started to appear, I remember a lot of Datsuns (Nissan). Chrysler got in trouble, but the feds, Big Lee and the minivan saved them for a couple more decades.</p>
<p>There were other warning signs, in the mid-80s Ford was saved by the Taurus, and in the 90s the Explorer and F-150.</p>
<p>The United Auto Workers (UAW) were at the peak of their power by the mid-80s, but already jobs were starting to slip away. Now the jobs are going wholesale.</p>
<p>After massive losses of market share and jobs, the Big 3 and the UAW are at the edge of the cliff.</p>
<p>Poor design, poor quality and poor service cannot be blamed on anyone but the parties who did not care about consumers. There may or may not be time for a comeback by the Big 3.</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> should we care? Should we let capitalism run its course?</p>
<p>I have an indirect vested interest, the demise of the Big 3 has and will have disproportionate impacts on Ohio and Michigan, where I live and do most of my work.</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> should we care about Ohio and Michigan, or let nature run its course (both are also suffering as we offshore light and medium manufacturing)?</p>
<p>On a political note, the Bush administration blew off the domestic auto industry before the 2006 election, and then the GOP got creamed in Ohio and lost in Michigan. Cause and effect? I don’t know, but suddenly Bush is very interested in the domestic auto industry.</p>
<p>So what is our attitude on this? The Bush economy is not providing any replacement jobs, other than low value service jobs. Will this continue for a generation as I suspect?</p>
<p>The downslide of industrial unions is taking real incomes and real pension plans with it, so are the ripple effects something to worry about? Will this fuel a new populism?</p>
<p>Talk among yourselves.</p>

                                <p>Reader Eightnine2718281828mu5 sent me a couple e-mails.  I realized that together they constituted a post.  This one is by Eightnine2718281828mu5:</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p>I think part of the reason that median salaries don&#8217;t rise as fast as CEO salaries is that CEO&#8217;s know what other CEO&#8217;s make; most companies make it seem like a firing offense to discuss salaries among your co-workers. But because CEO compensation is a matter of public record, CEO&#8217;s can make a case that &#8220;I&#8217;m worth more than so-and-so&#8221; and it gives them leverage to bump their salaries. </p>
<p>If the average worker could say &#8220;Joe is a useless moron, but he makes 20% more than me&#8221; they would have leverage in salary negotiations. But because there&#8217;s asymmetrical information, it&#8217;s easy for companies to gain the upper hand.  (Consider this story on <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2007/03/19/magazines/moneymag/onthejob_april.moneymag/index.htm">CNN.com</a>.)</p>
<p>If I was in congress, I&#8217;d be pushing to make all salaries/wages a matter of public record to level the playing field. This would cause median salaries to rise without government intervention or by resorting to things abhorrent to the right like union membership. </p>
<p>Free markets work best when all parties operate in the context of the full and free flow of information; what free-marketer could complain about providing this vital piece of information to workers when negotiating with their employer?</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>The Ex-GF drives a tough bargain.  She likes to get as much as possible while spending as little as possible.  One of her favorite stores is Target.  But based on her recent on-line experience with Target, I suspect that may change.  </p>
<p>A while back, the Ex-GF decided she wanted a kind of pub-table with some bar-chairs.  So she ordered the whole thing as a set from Target.com.  The chairs arrived by UPS.  We assembled them.  A day or two later, a large box arrives.  Since I work from home, I signed for them, and put it aside.  A few hours later, when the Ex-GF arrived, she noticed that there was stuff oozing out of the box (on to the carpet).  More specifically, a thick, greasy, goo.  And not just a little bit, either.  We’re talking gobs of thick, greasy goo.  Perhaps stupidly, we cut open the box to see where it was coming from. (O.K. she was the stupid one.)  It seemed to be emanating from the table itself.  Even if it’s the stuff that should be applied to the table (and its greasy enough to make me wonder), way too much was slathered on and not given a chance to dry.</p>
<p>The package was placed on the balcony.  The next day, Target was called.  We were told we had to send back the table and the chairs.  But the chairs had already been assembled, as they had arrived days earlier, in another shipment.  The Ex-GF demanded to speak to a supervisor.  The supervisor decided it would be OK if we simply sent back the table. But, the Ex-GF noted that since neither we nor Target knew what the stuff oozing out of the box was, we had no way to know how safe it is to ship.  What’s the flashpoint on this gunk?  She was assured that Target would assume any liability if the UPS truck caught fire.  Yeah, that’s very nice, but its getting warmer and we like our UPS man.  We don’t want to see him dead, at least not over a pub table.</p>
<p>So, the Ex-GF wanted to know if we could simply take the gooey pub table, wrapped in a garbage bag, to a Target store.  The answer: Yes.  But we would have to return the chairs too and when it is returned, we would get store credit.  The problem is, the pub table and chairs were on sale and that means to buy a replacement now we would have to spend about $100 bucks more. (A replacement was not available in the store for this on-line only item.)</p>
<p>The Ex-GF was finally given a phone number of someone else (Michelle) to talk to from Sedgewick CMS (an out-sourced claims management company) There was some back and forth, but basically, to get another pub table, we have to repackage it and ship it out.  They were not interested in seeing pictures of the goo, and were not concerned with the safety of sending back the oily ooze of unknown flashpoint through UPS. In addition, since we (make that since the Ex-GF) destroyed the package, trying to figure out where the ooze was coming from, we would be hard pressed finding a box that would fit its awkward dimensions. Plus, it would cost us in time and money. </p>
<p>So, the table sits, unassembled, wrapped in plastic, next to the kitty litter box out on the balcony.  I guess we’re going to unwrap it and try to dry up the goo.  (Hopefully its possible, but the thing has been there for two weeks and the glop still has the consistency of snot.)  I’m sure the Ex-GF will continue shopping at Target, but she’s going to do it a lot less.  And I’m guessing it’s going to be a very long time before she buys anything from them online.</p>
<p>So what’s the moral of this story?</p>
