<p> What Bush II and Clinton Got Wrong On The Economy</p>
<p>First, we start off with sectorial balances. Trade deficits must be offset by government and/or private deficits. For example, if we had a $50 billion trade deficit, then that needs to be offset with a $50 billion government deficit. Otherwise, the private sector will be driven into debt, which is not as sustainable long term.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s look at the Bush years in the accompanying chart. Trade deficits far exceeded budget deficits, and grew quite large. As those trade deficits grew as a % of GDP, the budget deficit was shrinking. I think we know the net effect as the private sector was driven further into debt &#8211; real estate related debt, which unraveled in 2008. Now going back a little further, this condition also existed under Clinton though to a lessor extent.</p>
<p>Both presidents should have run larger deficits to keep the sectors in balance. This could have been achieved through some combination of policies that either lowered the trade deficit, and/or increased spending, and/or tax cuts. Needless to say they both got it wrong, and Obama&#8217;s stimulus spending was the correct move to begin to get the sectorial balances back in check. However, Obama really needs to be running larger deficits to correct for the past imbalances.</p>

<div dir="ltr">Okay, by now y’all know that I’m not an economist.  Nor a statistician.  Nor a mathematician. Nor even someone who can easily understand simple line graphs.  (Bar graphs work for me, though, I’ve discovered!) </div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">But I do know a tad about 20th century American history.  So when I read Paul Krugman’s <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/20/stimulus-derangement-syndrome/">latest blog post</a>, titled “Stimulus Derangement Syndrome,” about the really bald mistakes of fact&#8211;basic failures to remember history or logic, as Krugman descriptively phrases it&#8211;by “name” conservative economists, in the service of advancing austere fiscal policy, I was struck by this sentence:</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">So, for example, we had <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/01/22/war-and-non-remembrance/">Robert Barro</a> arguing that multipliers are small because private spending fell during World War II (hello? Rationing? Banning of private construction?). </div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">I didn’t know who Robert Barro is until I read Krugman’s blog post.  But now that I do know, I want to contact him, because I think he might be interested in buying a family heirloom I have in the garage, and I&#8217;m trying to sell it.  It’s a 1944 model Oldsmobile, and it’s in vintage condition.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oldsmobile#1940s">It’s also unique</a>.  Believe me.</div>

                                <p>I have screamed for the last several years that the problem with economics isn&#8217;t that Macro is problematic; DSGE is a detour but—as Noah Smith shows <a href="http://noahpinionblog.blogspot.com/2013/03/john-taylors-austerity-model.html" target="_blank">here</a>—it can be used as an access road.</p>
<p>The problem is assuming that &#8220;micromotives&#8221; must be universal.  For all of the emphasis about the glories of using natural logs because they reflect &#8220;what happens in nature,&#8221; economists who insist that micro principles must be foundational to macro behavior <strike>are idiots</strike> fail to study nature.</p>
<p>Now, via <a href="http://floggingbabel.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Michael Swanwick</a> (whose wife Marianne taught me more about China in ten minutes than all of the analysts and economists who wrote about it did in the previous ten years), we see that even robots understand that individual behavior is not sustainable in a society.</p>
<p>If only economists could (re-*)learn that, they might get back on the road to being a science, instead of being lost in the woods of a perpetually self-indulgent wankfest.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: <a href="http://whiskeyfire.typepad.com/whiskey_fire/2013/03/the-short-joust.html" target="_blank">Thers</a> reminds me of <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2007/10/five-nomination.html" target="_blank">this Brad DeLong post</a>, where Belle Waring <a href="http://examinedlife.typepad.com/johnbelle/2004/03/if_wishes_were_.html" target="_blank">sums up the true problem of Modern Economics</a> succinctly and better than I did (or, perhaps, can do):<br />

<p>You cannot have a &#8220;social science&#8221; if your foundations are anti-social. No matter how many differential equations you use.</p>
<p>*I&#8217;m fairly certain it is a matter of re-learning. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuznets_curve" target="_blank">Kuznets Curve</a>, for instance, indicates an understanding that collective action does not reflect just &#8220;the sum of the parts.&#8221;</p>

<div>&#8230;two substantial defects in how we understand and affect our economy and the ecology. The larger defect arises from a human tendency to simplify the world into &#8220;sensible&#8221; concepts that may be inaccurate. Although we might laugh at past versions of this mistake (a flat Earth at the center of the Universe, the spread of malaria from &#8220;bad air,&#8221; woman springing from the side of man, and so on), we continue to make it today when we underestimate the complexity of our human and natural worlds. That miscalculation leads to the second defect in which economists promote theories, observations and prescriptions that fail to include this complexity (or a humble acceptance of it), a problem that worried Adam Smith over 250 years ago:</p>
</div>
<div>The man of system…seems to imagine that he can arrange the different members of a great society with as much ease as the hand arranges the different pieces upon a chess-board. He does not consider…that, in the great chess-board of human society, every single piece has a principle of motion of its own, altogether different from that which the legislature might choose to impress upon it…[Failure to acknowledge the motion of pieces means that] society must be at all times in the highest degree of disorder. —Smith (1759, pp. 233-4)</div>
<div>These disorders did not just manifest in human affairs (via Stalin, Mao and others)—they showed up in the natural systems that we neglected and misunderstood. Climate change—and the unprecedented threat to humans that it represents—has forced our eyes open, but we’re not yet wise (Peters et al., 2013; Marcott et al., 2013).</p>
<p>This apology is neither a wholesale rejection of economic thought and perspective nor an admission of error in our understanding of ecological values or human impacts on the environment. Life is complex. It’s an apology for the unintended damage that’s resulted from misapplying economic ideas: GDP fails to include non-market costs and benefits; transaction-based models mischaracterize dynamic relationships; aggregate social efficiency overlooks distribution impacts; technological advances can have substantial, unmeasured environmental impacts.</p>
<p>The rest of this essay will explain how we made these mistakes and how we can learn from them in facing a perilous future. This structure is not intended to provoke sympathy or excuse error. It’s just a way for us to reset a discussion that’s gotten tangled up in irrelevant details.</p></div>

<p> History Lesson &#8211; Deficits as a % of GDP, Tax Rates </p>
<p>DISCLAIMER: This is not a defense of Bush II. Just the facts on the deficit, and a further discussion of sectoral balances and some tax rate info.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s look at some history, because the belief is that Bush II ran the biggest budget deficits ever, and ruined the Clinton surpluses. I wish we did not spend so much on the military under Bush. However, the Bush deficits were not that large as a % of GDP. His father, and Reagan ran bigger ones. The deficits were not that far off where we were at the end of the 70&#8217;s either. Now keep in mind, that the trade deficit does factor in &#8211; been having trouble assembling historical data on this. When running a trade deficit we need to run a federal deficit to keep the private sector in balance. <br />See <a href="http://www.creditwritedowns.com/2011/02/government-deficits-and-the-financial-sectors-balances.html">Credit write downs</a>  on sectoral balances:</p>
<p>The key formulas is as follows:</p>
<p>Domestic Private Balance + Domestic Government Balance + Foreign Balance = 0<br />Via <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/the-growing-government-deficit-actually-means-savings-for-the-private-sector-2011-2#ixzz2NZIXVitT">Business Insider</a> L Randall Wray</p>
<p>Lastly, the Obama deficits are exactly what we needed to make up for the deficits that were probably too small under Clinton and Bush II.</p>
<p>Now, much of the talk on historical Tax Rates focuses on marginal rates- I found this table to be quite interesting as it looks beyond the top marginal rates, and breaks out lower income folks.</p>

<p>Data is for 3 groups 1/2 median income; Median Income ; Twice Median income respectively </p>
<p>Year &#8212; Average Combined Rates for each group that includes payroll taxes and EITC , and the last numbers are the top and bottom marginal rates that excludes payroll taxes ( I just sampled a few years, go to the link to see more. I used average cause that better reflects what one actually pays) :</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>NPR&#8217;s &#8220;Marketplace&#8221; <a href="http://www.marketplace.org/topics/world/european-debt-crisis/cyprus-bank-customers-asked-help-bail-out-banks">reported Monday</a> that the European Union planned to impose a tax on bank deposits in  Cyprus of up to 10% to bail out the country&#8217;s banks. This unprecedented  action threatens to undermine confidence in banks throughout the  eurozone periphery, Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal, and Ireland. As  Louise Cooper told Marketplace, “(This move) says that your savings are  not necessarily safe in a bank. What this risks is bank runs.&#8221; Indeed,  we could be literally hours from seeing bank runs in one or more of  them.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s the motivation for introducing such a risky policy? Cyprus is a tax haven; in fact, it&#8217;s a favorite destination for the <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/18/island-nightmares/">Russian mafia</a>.  Therefore, it&#8217;s not enough to simply impose austerity on Cyprus;  ordinary Cypriots have to give up some of their bank savings, too. So  says the EU.</p>
<p>Methinks they doth protest too strongly.  It&#8217;s not like there aren&#8217;t already tax havens in the EU, starting with  the City of London and Luxembourg. Plus, for varying purposes, Austria,  Belgium, the Netherlands, and Ireland. This is not to discount Germany&#8217;s  efforts to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/24/business/global/german-lawmakers-reject-swiss-tax-deal.html?_r=0">pierce Swiss banking secrecy</a>,  which the United States should emulate (i.e., it should pay more  informants to cough up information on U.S. tax evaders). Nor do I  underestimate the difficulty the EU has had in getting its <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/taxation/personal_tax/savings_tax/index_en.htm">Savings Tax Directive</a> passed in order to help stamp out intra-EU tax evasion, and the long way it still has to go.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s  the thing: Cyprus was already a tax haven when it joined the EU in  2004. Germany, and the other 14 members of the EU at the time, knew this  when they voted to approve Cyprus&#8217; membership (new members require a  unanimous vote). If they didn&#8217;t want to mess with another tax haven in  their ranks, any one of them could have stopped it. But they didn&#8217;t, so  they are in no position to claim innocence now. Instead, they are going   to try to extract money from ordinary Cypriots (<a href="http://www.marketplace.org/topics/world/european-debt-crisis/how-much-would-your-savings-account-be-taxed-cyprus">potentially exempting</a> the first 100,000 euros for each depositor) rather than going after the bankers <a href="http://middleclasspoliticaleconomist.blogspot.com/2012/02/road-not-taken-for-dealing-with-banks.html">like Iceland did</a>.</p>
<p>Let the bank runs begin!</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>
<div dir="ltr">In his NYT <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/19/opinion/brooks-the-progressive-shift.html">column today</a>, David Brooks  employs his standard column-writing formula of plucking two or more unrelated facts from their context and specifics, putting them into a sequence, and&#8211;voila!&#8211;suggesting a causal relationship, or at least a relationship of some sort, and therefore some conclusory fact.  </div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">This time around, he does it in the service of suggesting that the House Congressional Progressive Caucus’s proposed fiscal plan, written &#8220;by people hermetically sealed in the house of government&#8221;.  Unlike, say, the Ryan plan, written by Paul Ryan, who has spent most of his career in manufacturing.  </div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">The CPC plan calls for raising the top income tax rate to 49%, taxing investment income at the same rate as other income, closing a variety of tax loopholes such as the carried-interest gig, taxing estates at their pre-2001 levels, and eliminating the corporate money-laundering-through-foreign-shell-subsidiaries option. It also proposes additional expenditures on such things as infrastructure and education.  Brooks says all this means that the CPC members &#8220;believe that government is the [economic] horse, the source of growth, job creation and prosperity.&#8221;  Not a source, but the source. Because this is a zero-sum game.  </div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">He first claims that these high tax rates for the top bracket, when coupled with other taxes&#8211;state and local taxes, sales taxes, gas taxes&#8211;would amount to about 60% of their income. But Brooks being Brooks, he then says, without explanation, that the rates would be “80 percent or 90 percent of somebody’s top marginal earnings.” Somebody’s, maybe, but it’s certainly not clear who’s.  Anyway, this would “begin to change behavior and [we would] wind up with a very different country.”  Which I don’t doubt. </div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">“Higher taxes,” he says, “will produce long-term changes in social norms, behavior and growth.”  Not necessarily bad changes, though, since no one is actually talking about taxing 80% or 90% of anyone’s income.  No one serious in this country, anyway.  But what would a David Brooks column be without a sleight of hand or two?</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">Brooks offers an illustration to buttress his argument:</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">Edward Prescott, a winner of the Nobel Memorial Prize in economics, found that, in the 1950s when their taxes were low, Europeans worked more hours per capita than Americans. Then their taxes went up, reducing the incentives to work and increasing the incentives to relax. Over the next decades, Europe saw a nearly 30 percent decline in work hours.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">Yup.  Those 40-hour-a-week labor laws here and in Europe sure lowered standards of living. Bring back sweat shops! Foxconn, not Siemens, is what we want our companies to be modeled after.  </div>
<div dir="ltr"></div>
<div dir="ltr"></div>
<div dir="ltr">&#8220;A study last year by the economists Michael Keane and Richard Rogerson,” Brooks continues, “found that tax rates can have a surprisingly large influence on how much people invest in education, how likely they are to create businesses and which professions they go into.” No doubt. Get rid of the carried-interest break and start taxing hedge fund managers’ income at the same rate as salaries from working as an engineer, and some people who had planned to go into finance might instead go into engineering. Which would be awful for our society.  And raising taxes to the rates they were when state universities received about 70% of their funding from the government rather than most of it from tuition, as they do now, might allow students to borrow&#8211;er, invest&#8211;far less to go to college.  </div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">I myself don&#8217;t favor a top tax rate as high as the 49% proposed by the CPC.  Nor do I claim that the top tax rates in each of the countries I list in the title of this post has top tax rates that high. But what&#8217;s so striking and revealing about Brooks’s column is its utter untethering of actual standards of living from his litany of loose declarations of fact and silly conclusions.  There is no apparent recognition in that column that the purpose of fiscal policy isn’t abstractions but personal and societal well-being.  </div>

<div dir="ltr">There is, though, on the New York Times’s website today, in the Opinion section, a lengthy, detailed <a href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/18/singapores-lessons-for-an-unequal-america/">column that actually does exactly that</a>, This one is not by a political pundit but instead by an actual working economist, albeit not one who Brooks would even read, much less cite: Joseph Stiglitz.* And, lo and behold, it demonstrates using relevant, rather than disembodied, facts and statistics, that the government-horse thing isn’t a zero-sum game after all. Unless it’s being ridden backwards by the Tea Party or saddled by a pundit who doesn’t work too hard even though he doesn’t live in Europe.</div>

<p><strong>Bill:</strong>  Two topics going on here, the national debt which is roughly 97% of GDP and deficit spending or the result of the interplay between revenues and spending. During WWII, the national debt reached 120% of GDP, dropped as the country picked up economic steam during the coming decades and increased again to 102% in 2011 coming after the Wall Street crash (which almost dragged all of us down with it&#8217;s gambling). Much of the debt is owed by the public and roughly $4-5 trillion is owed to SS, etc. in the form of special treasuries (another topic). What matters is the debt owed to bondholders which is ~65% of the total US debt and tis is not extraorinarily high. Some neat graphs and charts on debt here: <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/redirect?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.usgovernmentspending.com%2Ffederal_debt_chart.html&#038;urlhash=KOXW&#038;_t=tracking_disc">http://www.usgovernmentspending.com/federal_debt_chart.html</a>    <br />There are many people wishing to cut the deficit spending the government has been doing for many years even before Barack Obama; but, the cutting of the spend at this time would cause this weak economy to contract even more than what it did after the Wall Street debacle. The Federal government additional spending replaces the contraction of state government through employment and budget cuts plus our very own cuts in spending for obvious reasons. We do need to do so until more and more of the people get back to work, begin to spend again, and pay taxes. Since 2009, the budget deficit HAS BEEN DECREASING and will continue to do so to ~3% by 2016. The sequester will only hurry it along. Nice chart of both spending and revnues here: <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/redirect?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.taxpolicycenter.org%2Ftaxfacts%2Fdisplayafact.cfm%3FDocid%3D200&#038;urlhash=WLae&#038;_t=tracking_disc">http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxfacts/displayafact.cfm?Docid=200</a> There are only a few times the government has ever run a surplus, the last being during the Greenspan inspired bubble in the late nineties. Mostly, the ratio has been 18-19% in taxes and a 19-20% in spend.    <br />How did we get to this point? Setting aside the Wall Sreet crash in 2008, we have two unfunded wars (just about all other US wars were funded by tax increases), tax cuts heavily skewed (~30%) to 1% of the Household taxpayers (~1 milllion) making > than $500,000 (AGI) annually and a recession in 2001/2008. It is worthy to note employment (as measured by the BLS Participation Rate) has never returned to the 66.7% experienced immediately after the 2001 recession. Employment may never return to that 66.7% of the NonInstitutional Civilian Population ever again as globalization has taken hold and productivity gains has minimized the Direct Labor content in most products. For those of you who watched the Congressional Hearings when GM was asking for help may have missed the point UAW leader Gettelfinger made of labor being less than 10% of the cost of an auto. This is true in just about every other product also. A good reference to this is Peter Drucker.    <br />Many politicians and people have attacked Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid as being the problems. Social Security is backed by a $2.1 trillion TF and once people get back to work, the revenues to it will increase and exceed the outlays taken from the TF consisting of special treasuries and interest. Medicare is also funded by contributions through 2020(?) which increased due to savings achieved with the passage of the PPACA. Medicaid is funded by Federal and State contributions. It is too soon to know if SS is in trouble over the long term because the economy changes from decade to decade and receipts and outlays go up and down. A 10 year window would be better to utilize to assess it health.    <br />Medicare, Medicaid, and commercial insurance cost increases are more the reflection of the healthcare cost increases; however, the growth of cost increases for both Medicare and Medicaid is dramatically lower than commerfcial insurance. ~2.4% as opposed to ~8% annually for commercial healthcare. While the PPACA is not the best healthcare insurance program coming into play, it is far better than the nothingness which has been accomplished since Hillarycare was proposed.     <br />I am close to exceeding the max here. Enough for now.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>WK… I don&#8217;t know where you get your insurance, but mine has increased by over 30% in the last 15 months. Many I have spoken to have had similar price increases. As far as PPACA helping people.. I&#8217;m sure it will, but as you mention..at what cost? We&#8217;ve already given up a freedom&#8230; the freedom of choice. We&#8217;re now being &#8220;mandated&#8221; to buy healthcare at a cost that is going to far exceed that of normal healthcare costs overall. I used an analogy earlier.. if you had a 2010 car that had a bad fuel pump, would you fix the fuel pump or buy a new car? </p>
<p><strong>Bill:</strong>  In 2012 I received my first rebate from my health insurance company which was ~$200 from BCBS and company sponsored. A friend in MA received $900 from his insurance company. This all came about as a result of the MLR which calculates the rates to be charged and also states 85% of the premium collected must go to the cost of healthcare. Many more people have received such rebates. My rebate for 2012 will be nonexistant due to three operations in the last quarter.     <br />The cost of insurance has gone up in some cases due to the companies increasing premiums arbitrarily in anticipation of the PPACA and also because of additional benefits such as there is no longer a maximum payout, the addition of chidren up to 26, pre-existing conditions must be covered, preventitive care is covered, etc. Your premiums are also invested in the stock market the same as homeowners and auto. If there is a bad market. your premiums will go up. The rise due to the PPACA is estimated to be ~3% of the total with the balance of the increase being the result of the rising cost of healthcare. <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/redirect?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.factcheck.org%2F2011%2F10%2Ffactchecking-health-insurance-premiums%2F&#038;urlhash=PnNR&#038;_t=tracking_disc">http://www.factcheck.org/2011/10/factchecking-health-insurance-premiums/</a> The average of ~8% may be more for your insurance.    <br />Your freedom may not be a freedom for many who could not obtain or afford healthcare insurance previously. You still have a freedom not to obtain healthcare insurance and gamble and pay a small penalty (smaller than the premium) at the end of the year to the government; but since you are here, I am sure you could probably afford to buy healthcare insurance. From the looks of you, you are healthy and have a relatively good job. If you are a part of small group coverage, the company you are insured with has to answer to the state and federal government on increases > 10%.    <br />As far as a bad fuel pump in a car; it would be wonderful if fixing healthcare was this simple; however, it is not as the healthcare industry and commercial insurance had little interest in fixing it to provide reasonable insurance and coverage for those without insurance. The halthcare industry and the associated insurance plans are not quite that simple.     <br />The cost of the PPACA is far less than not having a healthcare insurance program. The Urban Policy Institute has a nice write up on healthcare and what happens without reform. </p>
