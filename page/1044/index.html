                                <p>After a nice long weekend, a little reading &#8230;</p>
<p>NY Times on Australia: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/05/realestate/05aussie.html">Hole in the Housing Bubble</a><br />
<blockquote>The Australian housing boom has come to a halt, in a move that many see as the first signs of the end to a housing bubble, not just in Australia, but also in the U.S.</p></blockquote>
<p> Baltimore Sun: <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/business/bal-te.bz.invest03jul03,1,3376975.story?page=1&#038;coll=bal-business-headlines&#038;ctrack=1&#038;cset=true">Investors heat up housing market</a>  Investors have bought 2/3 of all houses sold so far this year in Baltimore.  Talk about speculation!<br />
<blockquote>Two out of three houses sold in Baltimore this year have been snapped up by people who don&#8217;t intend to live in them, an unusually high amount of investor activity that is adding fuel to the city&#8217;s efforts to revive itself &#8211; but could endanger housing values down the road.</p>
<p>Investor purchases turned up in 2002 and have accelerated ever since, painting a picture of increasing frenzy. In 2001, about one out of three arms-length home sales were to &#8220;non owner-occupiers,&#8221; according to data from the state Department of Assessments and Taxation, analyzed by The Sun. Two years later, they accounted for half the sales, and in the first four months of this year, 67 percent. Early statistics for the following weeks show the trend strengthening.</p></blockquote>
<p>  Last week I asked who the potential &#8220;bag holders&#8221; were &#8211; and from the San Francisco Chronicle: <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/06/26/BUGL5DEQJU1.DTL&#038;hw=Pender&#038;sn=004&#038;sc=826">Investors now shouldering the risks for home mortgages</a><br />
<blockquote>If the housing market weakened or collapsed and homeowners started to default on their mortgages in big numbers, who would be left holding the bag?</p>
<p>Thanks to the growing secondary market for home mortgages, much of the default risk has been transferred from banks and other lenders to investors who buy loans or, more often, interests in mortgage-backed securities.</p></blockquote>
<p>  More from the Chronicle article:<br />
<blockquote>Securities backed by pools of conforming mortgages are considered almost risk-free because if the borrowers default, Fannie or Freddie will pay off the loans (assuming Fannie and Freddie remain solvent).  </p>
<p>Non-conforming loans go into pools known as private-label securities. In the first quarter of 2005, loans in private-label mortgage securities accounted for 14.4 percent of all outstanding residential mortgage loans, up from just 9.7 percent in 2003, according to Federal Reserve data.</p></blockquote>
<p>  And finally a related NY Times article on hedge funds: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/03/business/yourmoney/03view.html">Could a Few Hedge Funds Spoil the Party?</a><br />
<blockquote>&#8220;&#8230;in some markets, particularly fixed income and convertible arbitrage, &#8230; hedge funds have come to dominate. In May, in its latest report on global financial security, the International Monetary Fund found that hedge funds might account for 80 to 90 percent of all participants in those markets.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>  Some food for thought.  I hope everyone had a great Independence Day weekend.</p>

Perhaps <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/may2004/nf20040510_0257_db008.htm">this</a> will give us some clue.  </p>
<p>Mandel’s <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/the_thread/economicsunbound/archives/2005/06/mark_thoma_miss.html">first post</a> drew <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/06/growth-theory-v-monetary-economics.html">my fire</a> as he seemed to be suggesting economists like Paul Krugman and Mark Thoma did not realize the importance of intellectual capital – defined as education and R&#038;D to promote technological improvements.  </p>
<p>His next <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/the_thread/economicsunbound/archives/2005/07/why_the_hairshi.html">two</a> <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/the_thread/economicsunbound/archives/2005/07/in_a_comment_pg.html">posts</a> indicate Mandel is frustrated that the Clinton years had Federal nondefense R&#038;D spending fall as a share of GDP.  I was a little surprised at this complaint for several reasons.  The following graph shows public education spending as a share of GDP indicating that it rose during the Clinton years.  But Mandel’s focus is on R&#038;D so the next graph shows total R&#038;D as a share of GDP and nondefense R&#038;D including civilian R&#038;D.  Federal nondefense R&#038;D was only 11% of total R&#038;D in 1992 and only 9.1% of total R&#038;D in 2000, while civilian R&#038;D was 63.2% of total R&#038;D in 1992 and 75% of total R&#038;D in 2000.  Why does Mandel focus on the former and not the latter?  </p>
<p>Before we address this question, let’s address this comment:</p>
<blockquote><p>The other problem is that economists, who you might think would love the idea of fast growth, are not very comfortable with technology. It&#8217;s a real blind spot in the profession. Economists are more comfortable talking about thing like tax rates, budget deficits, or monetary policy. They&#8217;re much less comfortable talking about technology. They tend to ignore it or dismiss it, which is especially funny because very good economic research shows that over the long run, technology is the major driving force behind economic growth … In the book I discuss the relationship between growth, technology, financial markets, and politics. What I point out is that politicians do a lot of wrangling over budget deficits, but they pay far too little attention to technology.</p></blockquote>
<p>Mandel seems to be suggesting that some economists are posing a false trade-off.  Reducing budget deficits does not necessarily mean less investment in R&#038;D.  While the preference of the Clinton Administration was to raise taxes to reduce private consumption, the preference of fiscally responsible Republicans such as Phil Graham was to lower government consumption.  But Mandel seems to suggest other economists view a world where total (private and public) consumption is fixed, which implies a fixed amount of savings to be allocated to investments in physical capital versus intellectual capital.  </p>
<p>Economists are guilty, however, of wanting to weigh the prospective benefits of R&#038;D against their costs.  Free market economists might argue that the private sector properly weighs these two, but we should note that the social benefits of R&#038;D often exceed private benefits.  For this reason, a good case of policy interventions to encourage if not publicly fund R&#038;D can be made.  On this score, I agree with Mandel.  But here is the key question – how does the allocation of public funds weigh the opportunity cost of publicly funded R&#038;D against the prospective benefits.  A classic example is Star Wars where liberals often emphasize the costs and conservatives often discuss the possible benefits of a missile defense shield.  If one believes that the probability of success of Star Wars is very low, then the costs likely exceed the expected benefits.  But given the propensity of the Bush Administration to pretend we can cut taxes even as we increased defense spending, do our policymakers even recognize there is an opportunity cost?</p>

                                <p>Inspired by <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/07/nouriel-roubini-v-free-lunch-supply.html">PGL’s reference</a> to the debate between <a href="http://www.roubiniglobal.com/archives/2005/06/voodoo_economic.html">Nouriel Roubini and Art Laffer</a>, I visited Laffer’s house to talk to him.  But before I had a chance to ask him why he thinks the Laffer curve (the idea that cutting taxes will actually lead to higher tax revenues) actually has any empirical relevance to the US economy today, I overheard the following conversation between Laffer and his neighbor, an economist:<br />
<blockquote>Laffer:  &#8220;I cut the grass in front of my house last weekend.  And this week, it really grew rapidly.  You should see how tall my grass is now!  Yes, we received plentiful rain during the week.  But really I think that my cutting it last week is what really led to it getting so tall.&#8221;</p>
<p>Neighbor:  &#8220;In order to tell whether cutting the grass last weekend caused it to grow so tall, wouldn’t you have to compare it to how tall it <em>would</em> have been, and how fast it would have grown, if you <em>hadn’t</em> cut it last weekend?&#8221;</p>
<p>Laffer:  &#8220;Don’t get all mumbo-jumbo technical with me.  I cut the grass last weekend, and it grew this week.  QED.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Upon hearing this I gave up my quest to have a serious conversation with Laffer, turned around, and went home.</p>

                                <p>Nouriel Roubini did yeoman’s work in his <a href="http://www.roubiniglobal.com/archives/2005/06/index.html#000333">Déjà Vu Voodoo Economics </a> (June 20), which was his summary of a debate with Art Laffer.  Roubini noted that CNBC had him debate Laffer in light of <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/showdoc.cfm?index=6407&#038;sequence=0">this news</a>, which included April tax revenues coming in $1 billion more than estimated.  And yet, <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_canto/canto200506300853.asp">Victor Canto</a> writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>It also is somewhat disappointing that the administration is not touting all of today’s good economic news. For instance, tax-revenue collections are coming in at much-higher-than-forecast levels, meaning lower tax rates have sparked people to work harder and have encouraged corporations to unlock capital.</p></blockquote>
<p>An extra $1 billion is not exactly “much higher” and I’m not sure what Canto means by “working harder” given the fact that the average workweek and the employment to population ratio are still below 2000 levels.  My real beef, however, is with <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_comment/darda200506270902.asp">Michael Darda</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Pro-growth tax-rate reductions on labor and capital in the 1920s, 1960s, 1980s, and then again in 1997 and 2003 all exhibited revenue-reflow effects, although some were stronger than others … The 2001 tax cuts combined small, glacially phased-in reductions in income-tax rates with credits and rebates designed to “put money in peoples’ pockets.” This traditional Keynesian stimulus technique has an incredibly poor track record. Tax credits and rebates simply shift money from one place to another, which can’t “create demand” and doesn’t stimulate behavior at the margin.</p></blockquote>
<p>I could remind Mr. Darda that the 1964 tax cut – like the tax cuts in the 1920’s – were part of aggregate demand stimulus packages.  But let’s have Nouriel take the microphone:</p>
<blockquote><p>So today Laffer argued that the latest fiscal figures of increased revenues had vindicated his Voodoo Magic while the reality is that, of course, return to trend GDP growth was bound to eventually lead to some temporary recovery of revenues relative to their totally dismal lows of recent years.</p></blockquote>
<p>This sounds like Keynesian stimulus to me.  Nouriel was describing the current (partial) recovery, but these comments equally apply to the 1964-65 recovery.  And the free-lunch crowd tends to leave off the 1966 credit crunch even though the Keynesian CEA was warning President Johnson in December 1965 that fiscal stimulus was becoming excessive.  As far as the 1981 tax cut, the free-lunch crowd tends to forget that it was followed by the 1982 recession as the Volcker anti-inflation jihad overwhelmed the fiscal stimulus.  They also leave off the fact that the Reagan recovery occurred when monetary policy reversed course.  But Nouriel’s discussion and links details these issues from 1981 to the present very well. </p>
<p>So let me turn to something I asked (via an email on 6/27) Mr. Darda to explain:</p>
<blockquote><p>A dynamic analysis of the Bush tax cuts shows that long-run growth could be lifted by 0.85 percentage points as long as the lower-tax schedules on capital and labor remain in place.</p></blockquote>
<p>Since he neither provided the source for this alleged claim nor responded to my email, I tried a small experiment with a simple Solow growth model.  Let’s assume an economy initially in a steady state where the growth rate of effective labor is 3%, the capital-to-output ratio is 3, and the savings rate is 9% &#8211; which implies a growth rate of 3.0%.  If we doubled the savings rate, we might get the result Darda suggests.  While most economists concede that lower tax rates financed by spending cuts might increase the savings rate a little, I know of no model that suggests a doubling of the savings rate from a fiscally neutral small government lowering of tax rates.  Additionally, the Bush43 type “give you your money back” tax cuts have not come with a smaller government, which means his fiscal policies have lowered the savings rate.  While one might try to go beyond my simple growth model, Mr. Darda has provided us with no model – just a spurious assertion.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.businessweek.com/the_thread/economicsunbound/archives/2005/06/mark_thoma_miss.html"> Mark Mandel</a> weighs in on a <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2005/06/the_school_of_h.html"> Mark Thoma</a> critique of a column written by <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/jun2005/nf20050628_8255_db013.htm">Chris Farrell</a> – but seems to have missed the point of the Farrell-Thoma debate.  Farrell and Thoma were discussing the role of monetary policy and the business cycle.  As Mandel accuses Thoma of missing the point, he changes the discussion to one of long-term growth theory:</p>
<blockquote><p>Let me explain the difference between the hairshirts and the growth proponents. Remember that long-term productivity growth&#8211;which is our ultimate goal&#8211;is driven by three forces: Physical capital, human capital, and intellectual capital … What&#8217;s interesting is that capital investment only accounts for about 40% of long-term productivity growth, while multifactor productivity accounts for a bit more than half. Now, here&#8217;s where the hairshirts and the growth proponents come in. The hairshirts, explicitly or implicitly, focus on the capital investment component of growth. They talk about the need to cut personal consumption and the budget deficit in order to free up more money for business investment … The growth proponents give equal weight to both technology and investment. They argue that it&#8217;s more important in the long run to focus on funding research and development spending, encouraging start-ups and venture capital, appropriately regulating (and sometimes encouraging) new technologies, and getting the right intellectual property policies. In practice, hairshirts and growth proponents advocate very different short-run policies. The hairshirts want to cut the budget deficit, even if that means stinting on R&#038;D spending … The growth proponents are willing to let the economy run &#8216;hot&#8217;, arguing that a boom encourages risk-taking and corporate spending on both R&#038;D and capital equipment (companies tend to set R&#038;D budgets as a percent of sales, so industry R&#038;D spending rises during boom times).</p></blockquote>
<p>If Mandel has not heard of the Denison residual in growth accounting, he might perhaps read <a href="http://nobelprize.org/economics/laureates/1987/solow-lecture.html">Solow’s 1987 lecture</a> describing the history of economic growth theory.  Solow notes the importance of savings and investment &#8211; Mandel’s hairshirts.  I had told Mark Thoma that I’m not a monetary hairshirt economist in the Farrell sense – and I don’t think Solow was either.  But most students of growth theory realize the importance of capital investment.  Solow also notes the Keynesian insight that prolonged recession tend to be associated with weak investment demand.  Also note the following from Dr. Solow:</p>
<blockquote><p>The formal model omitted one mechanism whose absence would clearly bias the predictions against investment. That is what I called &#8220;embodiment&#8221;, the fact that much technological progress, maybe most of it, could find its way into actual production only with the use of new and different capital equipment. Therefore the effectiveness of innovation in increasing output would be paced by the rate of gross investment. A policy to increase investment would thus lead not only to higher capital intensity, which might not matter much, but also to a faster transfer of new technology into actual production, which would. Steady-state growth would not be affected, but intermediate-run transitions would, and those should be observable.</p></blockquote>
<p>Simply put – embodiment implies that the diffusion of new technology is faster if investment is higher so these two factors complement each other.</p>
<p>Finally, I suspect Mandel believed the shouting from <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/03/fifty-years-of-rd-krugman-oreilly.html">Bill O’Reilly</a> about R&#038;D during the 1980’s v. the 1990’s in that debate with Paul Krugman, but it seems the facts did not support O’Reilly’s shouting.  </p>
<p><a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2005/06/businessweek_ha.html">Mark Thoma</a> asks what contribution was made by Mandel’s column.  I don’t see any.  But Mr. Mandel might consult a good growth theory textbook.</p>

                                <p>One more thought about <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/06/another-rate-hike.html">today’s FOMC statement</a>: at a certain point, one starts to wonder why the FOMC can&#8217;t just use plain English when trying to convey its intentions.  Currently, economists and financial market participants spend considerable time and energy trying to interpret exactly what the FOMC is signaling with its statements.  So why can’t they just come right out and tell us?  What would be the harm if the statement read something like this: <br />
<blockquote>&#8220;We fully expect to continue our current policy of raising interest rates by 0.25% per meeting for at least the next two or three meetings.  And if economic growth continues at current levels, we’ll continue this policy at least through the end of the year.  Note, however, that this could change if there are dramatic changes in economic conditions.  Obviously.&#8221; </p></blockquote>
<p>The Fed has gradually moved toward greater and greater transparency.  Wouldn’t plain English be another good step in that direction?</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>The FOMC just released its statement announcing that it has decided to increase the Federal Funds rate yet again by 0.25%, to 3.25%.  This was expected.  The only point of uncertainty was exactly what signal the Fed would send the market about future rate hikes.  Would they suggest that this period of interest rate increases is coming to an end (as <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story.asp?dist=&#038;param=archive&#038;siteid=mktw&#038;guid=%7B4394042F-91E1-46B4-B786-CC5EC97E330F%7D&#038;garden=&#038;minisite=">some commentators</a> speculated this week), or do they still think that the economy is strong enough to withstand further rate increases?</p>
<p>Here is today&#8217;s FOMC statement compared to May&#8217;s statement.  New additions to the statement are in boldface, while portions that were in the May statement but eliminated this time around are crossed out.<br />
<blockquote>The Committee believes that, even after this action, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative and, coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing ongoing support to economic activity. <strike>Recent data suggest that the solid pace of spending growth has slowed somewhat, partly in response to the earlier increases in energy prices.</strike> <strong>Although energy prices have risen further, the expansion remains firm</strong> and labor market conditions continue to improve gradually. <strike>Pressures on inflation have picked up in recent months and pricing power is more evident.</strike> <strong>Pressures on inflation have stayed elevated</strong>, but longer-term inflation expectations remain well contained.</p>
<p>The Committee perceives that, with appropriate monetary policy action, the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability should be kept roughly equal. With underlying inflation expected to be contained, the Committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured. Nonetheless, the Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>My reading of this is that the FOMC thinks that the economy is doing fine, and doesn&#8217;t intend to stop its pattern of quarter-point rate hikes any time soon.  (Of course, I&#8217;m assuming that the committee won&#8217;t have to revise this statement to correct a mistake, like they did <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/05/feds-statement.html">last month</a>&#8230;)</p>
<p>The chart below probably has something to do with this.  With today&#8217;s rate increase, the real federal funds rate (which I&#8217;ve measured by subtracting the 12-month change in the GDP deflator from the interest rate) is just below 1%.  But this is still far, far short of where the real federal funds rate typically is during periods of reasonably good economic growth.</p>
<p><a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/uploaded_images/real_ffrate1-778054.jpg"><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/uploaded_images/real_ffrate1-775800.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />If one believes in an exogenously &#8216;neutral&#8217; real federal funds rate (as Greenspan seems to), the chart suggests that such a neutral fed funds rate is probably somewhere in the neighborhood of 3-4%.  If inflation remains in the 2-2.5% range this year, it will take the FOMC more than 12 more months until the Fed&#8217;s &#8220;policy accomodation&#8221; has been fully removed at the current &#8220;measured pace&#8221; of quarter-point hikes.  We still have a long way to go, in other words.  </p>
<p>But I have my doubts about the concept of an exogenously &#8216;neutral&#8217; interest rate.  The reason is because I wonder if relative interest rates aren&#8217;t sometimes just as important as absolute levels of interest rates when it comes to influencing business and consumer spending decisions.  So while today&#8217;s interest rates are indeed low in an absolute sense, I worry that raising interest rates will still chill economic growth from its current level, which is only mediocre to begin with.  </p>
<p>However, I am also sympathetic to the idea that the Fed needs to store up ammunition for the next economic slowdown, and thus needs to raise interest rates today while it can.  This leaves me feeling fairly ambivalent about whether the Fed should keep raising interest rates.</p>
<p>At any rate, I&#8217;m not the one making the decision.  That&#8217;s up to Alan Greenspan.  And from today&#8217;s statement, it looks like we&#8217;re in for further increases in short-term interest rates, for at least a little while.  After that, it&#8217;s anyone&#8217;s guess.</p>

                                <p>In the wake of last week’s bid for Unocal by the Chinese oil firm CNOOC, the press has been full of stories about China’s newly emerging economic might.  That economic power is real, and without a doubt will gradually change the way the world looks over the coming decades.  From the US’s point of view, not all of those changes will necessarily be for the better.</p>
<p>But while I was looking for some data on China&#8217;s savings rate for yesterday&#8217;s post about <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/06/international-saving-comparisons.html">differences in savings behavior</a>, I was impressed by the multitude of statistics that I encountered that illustrate just how dramatically life has tangibly improved for hundreds of millions of people in China over the past decade or two.  The following statistics portray how China’s rapid economic development has caused a marked improvement in living standards for a mind-bogglingly large number of people. </p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/uploaded_images/china_poverty-779707.jpg"><br />Sources: Poverty figures from the ADB report, “Poverty in Asia” (2004); other figures from China Statistical Yearbook and World Development Report.</p>
<p>Such dramatic improvements in the quality of life for such a large number of people is probably unprecedented in all of human history.   </p>
<p>There’s a lot to criticize about China’s government and its policies.  But say what you will, it is hard to argue that China’s recent economic success has not lead to vastly improved lives for hundreds of millions of people – a sizeable proportion of the entire human race.  It’s an achievement that deserves to be appreciated and celebrated by all of us.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>The following chart shows household real income for the tenth and twentieth percentiles per the data in table A3 of the <a href="http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/incomestats.html"> Census Bureau’s</a> <em>Income, Poverty, and Health Insurance Coverage in the United States: 2003 </em>(issued August 2004).</p>
<p>Donald Luskin’s STILL MOVIN&#8217; ON UP is supposed to appear in the National Review print edition on July 4 &#8211; with the text available <a href="http://poorandstupid.com/chronicle.asp">here</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Journal and the Times are exercised by reports that, over the last three decades, a new class of what the Times calls the “hyper-rich” has arisen in the United States, resulting in a disparity in incomes between rich and poor not seen since the 1920s: the most severe income inequality in the developed world today … But none of this is exactly man-bites-dog material. What the Times reports as news is a pattern that should be familiar to economic historians: Times of great prosperity have been associated with greater income inequality (for example, the 1920s), and conversely times of economic decline have been associated with greater equality (the 1930s). The lines of causality here are complex, and no doubt run in both directions: Prosperity is both the cause and the effect of inequality, and decline is both the cause and the effect of equality. So ideological advocates of income equality for its own sake ought to be careful what they wish for … We need to focus, then, on the question: What harm has it done to have this new class of the hyper-rich on the American scene? … Average after-tax, inflation-adjusted income has risen for every income quintile in the population. Yes, it has risen the most for the highest quintile, and risen the least for the lowest—but this can be explained to some extent by the great wave of immigration over the same period. The fact remains that income has risen for all: The rising tide has lifted all boats.</p></blockquote>
<p>This claim that faster growth causes greater income inequality is rebutted by <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2005/06/intellectual_ga.html">Brad DeLong</a>.  The rising tide claim may have been true for the last 33 years of the twentieth century, but our chart shows real income for the tenth and twentieth percentiles have fallen since 2000.  The chart shows the rather unsurprising tendency for real income of poorest among us to be cyclical.  Let’s also look at the past 36 years in four stages.  For the 11-year period ending in 1978, real income for the poorest among us grew by around 20%, but grew by less than 6% for the 11-year period ending in 1989.  Real income growth poorest among us was almost 10% for the 11-year period ending in 2000, but the decline in real income since 2000 has wiped out much of the gain in real income for the poorest among us that we enjoyed during the 1990’s.  </p>
<p>While Luskin may be correct that the rising tide lifted all boats before 1979 and during the Clinton years, the rather weak growth of the past few years has been accompanied by a decline in real income for the poorest among us.  While one might reasonably conclude that part of the reason for the fall in real income among the poor is the continued weak labor market, Luskin wants his readers to believe that economic growth has been sensational in the last few years.  Alas, average annual growth over the past five years has not been great and real income for many of the poor has declined.</p>
