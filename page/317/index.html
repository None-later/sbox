<p><strong>Federal Government Stupidity &#8211; Part 1</strong><br />Part 1 of an occasional series</p>
<p>The &#8220;war on drugs&#8221; isn&#8217;t working so well.</p>
<p>But fear not, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has a clever plan to stop the flow of illegal drugs.</p>
<p>The DEA is harassing nursing home nurses who take oral narc orders (additions or changes) from physicians before the physician has physically signed the scrip. At midnight on Saturday this is the only way to provide care.</p>
<p>Honest to God.</p>
<p>Nursing homes do not have physicians or pharmacies on site, so care depends on the use of phone calls and signed fax orders to provide timely care, especially nights and weekends.</p>
<p>Every med entering the nursing home is logged and signed for, every med is signed out when administered, and every narc in the inventory is counted and signed for THREE TIMES A DAY!</p>
<p>If every narc in the typical nursing home were stolen and sent to the streets it wouldn&#8217;t amount to a tiny fraction of a good dope shipment.</p>
<p>Nursing home surveyors, another branch of the the government, are citing facilities for not providing timely pain relief.</p>
<p>Stupid.</p>

<p>On the one hand there is the fundamental interest rate, inflation approach.  It says that the market overreacted to the two shocks of Greece and Deepwater Horizon and is now cheap.<br />The S&#038;P 500 PE on trailing operating earnings is now 16.5, and according to the traditional relationship with interest rates and inflation that is well below fair value and thus creates a buying opportunity, at least in the short run.<a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/TAesqKQ36jI/AAAAAAAABJQ/LRtjuI10uGI/s1600/Clipboard02.bmp"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/TAesqKQ36jI/AAAAAAAABJQ/LRtjuI10uGI/s320/Clipboard02.bmp" alt="" border="0"></a><br />Alternatively, you can take the money supply approach that says the Greece and Deepwater Horizon shocks were just the first shocks and that because of weak money supply growth more shocks of this nature should be expected.</p>
<p>Note, that the first drop in the PE early this year was simply the massive write-offs of 2009 rolling out of the trailing earnings data.  Consequently, that PE drop was expected and was not a problem.  But now with the spread between unit labor cost and prices at near record levels strong earnings growth should continue despite the point that a strong dollar is restrictive on the economy and will will dampen reported foreign earnings &#8212; up to half of the<br />S&#038;P 500 operating earnings.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/TAesd0BEm9I/AAAAAAAABJI/G32Hs7nDSUc/s1600/Clipboard01.bmp"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/TAesd0BEm9I/AAAAAAAABJI/G32Hs7nDSUc/s320/Clipboard01.bmp" alt="" border="0"></a>You pays your money and make your bets.</p>
<p>What do you think?<br />In the comments there was a discussion of the frequency of the market PE, and my point that there is no central tendency for the PE to converge on the average PE of about 14&#8211; 14.5 to be exact.</p>
<p>Here is the market PE since 1871.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/TAj5Tn27IeI/AAAAAAAABKQ/B538VDp6Zls/s1600/Clipboard04.bmp"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/TAj5Tn27IeI/AAAAAAAABKQ/B538VDp6Zls/s320/Clipboard04.bmp" alt="" border="0"></a>Here is a histogram or frequency distribution of the market PE since 1871.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/TAj3ZiZo-rI/AAAAAAAABJw/HAWT_OYUsvs/s1600/Clipboard05.bmp"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/TAj3ZiZo-rI/AAAAAAAABJw/HAWT_OYUsvs/s320/Clipboard05.bmp" alt="" border="0"></a><br />If you combine the individual distribution into ranges of about 2 PE points &#8212; below 12,<br />12 -13, 14-15, 15-16, etc., etc., this is the distribution you get.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/TAj3xvUeaRI/AAAAAAAABKA/k_0tlaL7Lu8/s1600/Clipboard06.bmp"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/TAj3xvUeaRI/AAAAAAAABKA/k_0tlaL7Lu8/s320/Clipboard06.bmp" alt="" border="0"></a>As I said in  the comments if you pick any random time the PE is just as likely to be at any point between 10 and 20 as at the average of some 14 to 15.</p>
<p>Maybe in advance stat course you could pick this apart, but for all practical purposes and for general analytical purposes this clearly appears to support my point.  Maybe if commentators actually ever looked at the data before they told me I was wrong I could accept their criticism or disagreement.  But for someone to make up numbers out of thin air and proceed to tell me<br />I am wrong  is not acceptable.</p>

<p><strong>Economic Growth Rates, The President&#8217;s Party and the Party that Controls Congress</strong><br />Cross-posted at <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=34">the Presimetrics blog</a>.</p>
<p>This post looks at economic growth rates by President and party.  However, it also looks at how that growth rate is affected by which party controls Congress.  (This is a topic covered in a lot of depth in <em>Presimetrics</em>, my upcoming book written with Michael Kanell.  </p>
<p>In this post, economic growth is measured as the annualized change in real GDP per capita, which was obtained from <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/TableView.asp?SelectedTable=264&#038;ViewSeries=NO&#038;Java=no&#038;Request3Place=N&#038;3Place=N&#038;FromView=YES&#038;Freq=Year&#038;FirstYear=1929&#038;LastYear=2009&#038;3Place=N&#038;Update=Update&#038;Jav">the Bureau of Economic Analysis&#8217; National Income and Product Accounts Table 7.1</a>.  Growth rates are measured from the year before a President (or Congress) took office – call that the baseline real GDP per capita for any given President &#8211;  to its last year in office.  The analogy we use in the book is that of a sprinter; times are measured from when the starter’s pistol goes off (which is right before the sprinters start running) to right before they stop running all out (when they cross the finish line).</p>
<p>The BEA is the agency in charge of computing GDP, and the data goes back to 1929.  The post will use all the available data with one exception – when many people are confronted with the fact that the data shows insanely fast growth during the FDR years the first reaction is denial as this isn’t exactly what pundits (not to say many authors) tell you happened during his term.   Those who bother checking data move on to a second reaction, which is to insist that the rapid growth was due entirely to World War II.  As a result, this post only includes FDR’s term until 1938, far enough before the start of World War II that the war shouldn’t be an issue.  </p>
<p>So here’s what it looks like, color coded by the President’s party (red = Republican, blue = Democrat):</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TAcUwUiTiNI/AAAAAAAAAJU/C0dJtVpm-3o/s1600/Figure_1.bmp"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TAcUwUiTiNI/AAAAAAAAAJU/C0dJtVpm-3o/s320/Figure_1.bmp" border="0" alt=""></a><br />Graph 1</p>
<p>Despite what Glenn Beck and other media figures believe and tell us, even using only the six worst consecutive years of the FDR administration still leaves FDR at the top of the heap.  Additionally, Democratic administrations tend to come out ahead of Republican administrations.  Two notable exceptions are Truman and Obama, but for the latter only one year of data is available at this time.  Bear in mind that FDR also had negative growth in his first year in office too, so there’s room for that to change.  To a large extent, that depends on policies, and future post will examine policies that affect growth.</p>
<p>But for now, consider something different.  For some Democratic Presidents, both houses of Congress were under control of the Democratic party for every year the President was in office.  However, the Republican Party was in control for some or most years for other Democratic Presidents.  The next graph shows growth rates for Democratic Presidents only, but is color coded by whether the Congress was under Democrat control for the entire time the President was in office (blue) or not (red).</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TAcUw8yHzsI/AAAAAAAAAJc/PWN-aOJ1R3A/s1600/Figure_2.bmp"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TAcUw8yHzsI/AAAAAAAAAJc/PWN-aOJ1R3A/s320/Figure_2.bmp" border="0" alt=""></a><br />Graph 2<br /><a name="more"></a><br />Leaving aside the Obama administration, for which there is only a single year’s worth of data, the graph shows that, in general, Democratic Presidents who enjoyed a Democratic Congress every single year of their terms tended to produce faster economic growth than Democratic Presidents who faced Republican-controlled Congresses for part of their term.  </p>
<p>What about Republican Presidents?  Well, we can divide Republican Presidents into three groups: those who faced mostly split Congresses (throughout most of Reagan’s term, Republicans controlled the Senate and Democrats controlled the House of Representatives), those who faced all or mostly Democratic-controlled Congresses, and those who faced mostly Republican-controlled Congresses.  The next graph shows the growth rates turned in by Republican Presidents color coded by who controlled Congress (Red = All/mostly Democrats, Blue = All/mostly Republicans, Gray = Mostly Mixed).</p>

<p>The best performance by a Republican President came under Ronald Reagan… who faced a mixed Congress until 1987, and Democratic controlled Congress in 1987 and 1988.  Even among the remaining Republican presidents, it does not appear that having a Republican controlled Congress leads to faster economic growth.  Hoover was the only President to enjoy a Republican controlled Congress during his entire term, and he produced (by far) the worst results of all Presidents.  GW faced a Republican controlled Congress during most of his years in office, and growth during GW’s term was below the average growth for Republican Presidents who had to deal mostly or exclusively with Democratically controlled Congresses.</p>
<p>To summarize – among Presidents from 1929 to the present, Democrats produced faster economic growth than Republicans with quite a margin to spare.  Additionally, both Democrats and Republicans in the Oval Office were more likely to produce faster economic growth the greater the percentage of years in their term that the Democrats controlled Congress.</p>
<p>I’m going to try to explain what accounts for these differences in future posts. </p>

<p>OK.  This bit is not cross posted with Presimetrics – its special to Angry Bear, so to speak.  Call it a bit of editorializing.   None of this is rocket science.  It all falls out of organizing the data the way politicians and voters would expect the data to be organized, and is apparent from a set of graphs.  Presimetrics, the book I co-authored, which is coming out in August does a lot of this.  And it does it for a lot of series, from abortions to crime to the national debt.  Often Presidents who performed well on one issue tended to follow similar policies to other Presidents who did well on that issue.  Likewise, Presidents who did poorly also often shared policies with others who did poorly.</p>
<p>And it’s pretty apparent from this graph that the policies followed on one side of the aisle aren’t performing as advertized.   That doesn’t mean the other side of the aisle knows what it’s doing, merely that whatever mistakes it makes are small by comparison.  Or one can take the Megan McArdle route, which is to insist that even though politicians have insisted on splitting themselves into these two groups, the process by which a politician happens to get a D or R after his or her name is completely random, so any patterns we observe are coincidental.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Robert Waldmann</p>
<p>As he watches policy makers cry “fire fire” in Noah’s flood, Paul Krugman becomes almost shrill.  He has <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/12/29/optimal-fiscal-policy-in-a-liquidity-trap-ultra-wonkish/">a simple (rigorous) model </a>which suggests more stimulus would be ideal and that, when in a liquidity trap, government spending should be set to give unemployment equal to the non accelerating rate of unemployment.  In this model, he assumes Ricardian equivalence.  That’s the problem. </p>
<p>In the model, there is no problem with running up a large public debt.  The timing of taxes doesn’t matter at all.  <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2009/01/optimal-fiscal-policy-with-liquidity.html">In the real world, we are concerned about the public debt.</a>   In normal times, Krugman is very concerned because, he believes, people mistake bonds for net wealth and this distorts consumption/saving decisions.  In a liquidity trap there would be an additional advantage of public spending (giving a multiplier greater than 1).  However, the debt will still be with us when we exit the liquidity trap.</p>
<p>This does not have to be true.  It is possible to pay for the stimulus by cutting public spending when the economy exits the liquidity trap.  This does not reduce the stimulating effect (if consumers are rational and forward looking it increases the effect as lower government spending in the future implies more private consumption now).  It is also possible to pay for it by raising taxes in the future.  However, both cutting spending and raising taxes is difficult.  Below, I will just pretend that I find this argument that further stimulus is only OK if it doesn’t add to the deficit convincing, even though I don’t.  </p>
<p>So the problem is how to cause increased aggregate demand without increasing the budget deficit.</p>
<p>I think the solution is a temporary increase in the progressivity of the tax code.  A temporary tax cut for the poor will cause a large increase in their spending as many of the poor are liquidity constrained.  A temporary tax increase for the rich will cause a small decrease in their spending as few of the rich are liquidity constrained.  </p>
<p>Explicitly temporary tax cuts do not all become permanent.   There is no movement to extend the temporary tax cuts in the stimulus bill, even though Obama promised permanent tax cuts which were to be identical except five fourths as big.  It might be hard to let a temporary tax increase for the rich expire.  So my approach might reduce the deficit in the long run.</p>
<p>I think it is likely that none of the people who claim they oppose further stimulus because it will add to the debt* will support my proposal.  I do mean my subjective mode for the number is exactly zero.  Few people will hear of my proposal.  Few of them oppose further stimulus.  Most people who oppose further stimulus and call themselves deficit hawks are hypocrites.   Sincere deficit hawks might find my argument unconvincing.</p>
<p>Maybe there is one sincere deficit hawk who will read this and be convinced, but I doubt it.</p>

<blockquote><p>Hewlett-Packard Co. on Tuesday said it will invest $1 billion to consolidate and automate its data centers, a move that will lead to the elimination of 9,000 jobs over a &#8220;multiyear&#8221; period. </p>
<p>The Palo Alto, Calif.-based computer and printing giant /quotes/comstock/13*!hpq/quotes/nls/hpq (HPQ 45.59, +0.01, +0.02%) said annual savings in its enterprise-services division would range from $500 million to $700 million once the transformation is complete. H-P plans to halve the number of data centers its operates to around 50. </p>
<p>Data centers are used to store computerized information of businesses, government agencies and other organizations.<br />&#8230;<br />At the same time, H-P said it would hire more than 6,000 workers in sales and other areas of its enterprise-services unit. </p>
<p>The shift toward automation will allow H-P to better deploy assets obtained via the acquisition of EDS in mid-2008, according to the company. </p>
<p>&#8220;We see the possibility of taking enterprise services to an entirely new level based on applying H-P industry-leading technology to the services business,&#8221; said Cathie Lesjak, H-P&#8217;s chief financial officer.</p></blockquote>

<p>Are Tier 1 and Tier 2 jobs becoming Tier 3 jobs for people? The trend in this sector has HP a bit behind competitors.</p>

<p>Over at Firedoglake &#8220;Masaccio&#8221; has <a href="http://firedoglake.com/2010/05/30/grandma-lehman-sues-big-bad-wolf-jpmorgan/">a very interesting report </a>on a legal complaint by the estate of Lehman Brothers against J.P. Morgan.  </p>
<blockquote><p>on September 9, 2008, JPMorgan insisted that Lehman sign further agreements, under which Lehman guaranteed all obligations of its subsidiaries, including obligations under derivatives, and lost the ability to access its collateral overnight. That jeopardized the capital position of Lehman.</p>
<p>Then JPMorgan demanded even more collateral, finally winding up with some $8.6 billion in cash and liquid securities (paragraph 72) which made it wildly over-secured not only as to the minimal intra-day exposure, but even as to JPMorgan’s share of the unsecured line of credit and any reasonably estimated obligations with regard to derivatives.</p>
<p>On September 12, JPMorgan refused to give Lehman access to its collateral. Lehman collapsed into an uncontrolled bankruptcy, with little cash and less planning.</p></blockquote>
<p>Why ?</p>
<blockquote><p>The complaint says that JPMorgan admits that the additional collateral was not needed to cover exposures under existing agreements such as the unsecured loan agreement and the Clearance Agreement.  It says that the purpose was to collect “… on the possibility of closing out derivatives contracts on favorable terms in the event of a [Lehman] bankruptcy.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Mmm sure smells like financial arson to me.</p>
<p>Read the whole thing (Dimon is much more creative than me.  The point of the bankruptcy appears to have been to prevent Lehman from paying premiums on CDSs it had bought from JP Morgan causing the contracts to terminate automatically).</p>

<p>There seems to be a widespread view that the US experience with deregulation has been mixed.  Financial deregulation was a disaster, but airline deregulation and telecoms deregulation were OK (except for how crowded airports are and irritating advertisements by competing phone companies).</p>
<p>What is this &#8220;telecoms deregulation&#8221; of which you speak.  </p>
<p>I absolutely sincerely ask for information.  I recall 2 episodes of newly intrusive telecoms regulation. </p>

<p>First ATT was forced to provide local (last mile) service to competing long distance carriers.  This was imposed by the FCC.  IIRC it was an application of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act.   Yes there was a huge increase in competition, but it was caused by regulation not by deregulation.  The purpose of the act was to force companies to compete.  Following that decision to interfere with the free market, there was more competition.  A regulation served its stated purpose. Clearly this is a case of regulation not de-regulation. </p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MCI_Communications">Another FCC ruling that would affect the company [MCI]</a> was the 26 June 1968 ruling in the Carterfone case that deemed AT&#038;T&#8217;s rules prohibiting private two-way radio connections to a telephone network were illegal. AT&#038;T quickly sought a reversal of the ruling, and when the FCC denied their request brought suit against the FCC in the U.S. Court of Appeals. The FCC&#8217;s decision was upheld thus creating a new industry: privately (non-Bell) manufactured devices could be connected to the telephone network as long as the manufacturer met interface standards. </p></blockquote>
<p>That ruling, which consisted of the Federal Government telling ATT what it could do with its property, introduced long distance competition.  I was actually thinking of a later ruling in which a judge ordered ATT to make sure the interfaces worked (ATT had been trying to use the &#8220;as long as&#8221; part to restrain trade).</p>
<p>The second episode was breaking ATT up into ATT and the baby bells.  This was definitely an act of regulation under the authority of the Sherman act.  <a href="http://tinyurl.com/yf6nsax">Just ask ATT.<br /></a></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230; an antitrust suit by the U.S. government against AT&#038;T. The suit began in 1974 and was settled in January 1982 when AT&#038;T agreed to divest itself of the wholly owned Bell operating companies that provided local exchange service. </p></blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s regulation not deregulation. </p>
<p>I suppose there might have been telecoms deregulation too, but that would be only dealing with minor issues left over by the huge acts of telecoms regulation.   </p>
<p>Unless I am confused, people are mixing up competitive markets and laissez faire.  Under laissez faire ATT could use its natural monopoly to block competition until the US was cabled for TV.  The cable companies could offer telephone service (I don&#8217;t think they bother).  Cable TV wasn&#8217;t deregulation.  It was a tiny bit of technology and massive investment.</p>
<p>One of the principal aims of economic regulation in the USA has long been the promotion of competition.  Sometimes regulation and public intervention over-ruling private property rights achieves its aims.  It seems that, in one such case, it is therefore called &#8220;deregulation.&#8221;</p>
