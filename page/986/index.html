                                                                    </div>

                                <p>A propos of recent discussions regarding immigration, I thought it worthwhile reposting the link to a relevant paper that I quite like: Gianmarco Ottaviano and Giovanni Peri, &#8220;<a href="http://papers.nber.org/papers/w10904">The Economic Value of Cultural Diversity: Evidence from US Cities</a>.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>What are the economic consequences to U.S. natives of the growing diversity of American cities? Is their productivity or utility affected by cultural diversity as measured by diversity of countries of birth of U.S. residents? We document in this paper a very robust correlation: US-born citizens living in metropolitan areas where the share of foreign-born increased between 1970 and 1990, experienced a significant increase in their wage and in the rental price of their housing. Such finding is economically significant and survives omitted variable bias and endogeneity bias. As people and firms are mobile across cities in the long run we argue that, in equilibrium, these correlations are consistent only with a net positive effect of cultural diversity on productivity of natives.</p></blockquote>
<p>Being the child of two immigrants to the US, I feel like I have personal experience supporting my firm belief that the greatest benefits of immigration to a country are quite subtle, very pervasive, and difficult to measure.  Traditional studies that try to tally up the costs and benefits of immigration usually focus on the taxes paid by immigrants, the direct impact of immigration on labor markets, and the government services that they receive.  Typically such measures <a href="http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/Immigration.html">show a rough balance</a>, some showing a slight gain to the native-born population, and some showing a slight loss. (All show large gains for immigrants themselves, of course, as well as large gains for the overall population including both immigrants and natives.) </p>
<p>But the approach taken by Ottaviano and Peri is a good effort at trying to identify one of the less tangible effects of immigration: its impact on the productivity of non-immigrants.  Their result is striking.  In cities with more immigrants, the non-immigrant population tends to get paid more, and the market tends to value real estate higher, implying that the city is generally viewed as a more desirable place to live.  They use some careful and rather clever econometrics to ensure that the causation runs from more immigrants to higher pay for non-immigrants, rather than the other way around.  After all of their controls for other determinants of non-immigrant wages, and after taking account of the fact that richer cities would be expected to attract more immigrants, they still find a statistically robust and positive residual effect of immigration on the income and productivity of non-immigrants.</p>
<p>Exactly why diversity improves the productivity of native-born Americans is a bit of an open question, though I suspect it has to do with the rich variety of viewpoints, experiences, and ideas that a diverse community offers.  Regardless, it is not at all surprising to me that this paper shows the effects of immigration to be large, robust, and very beneficial.</p>

<blockquote>But how likely is it that the Laffer curve is causing revenues to rise, as opposed to normal operation of the business cycle? Not much, in my opinion.  First of all, the Laffer curve came to prominence during a period when the top tax rate on dividends was 70 percent and the rate on long-term capital gains was 40 percent. Economist Arthur Laffer correctly pointed out that a 100 percent tax rate would raise no revenue and that rates close to this would reduce revenue below what a lower rate would bring in. Given the tax rates in existence, it was plausible to argue that a reduction in the top rate and capital gains tax would raise revenue. However, when President Bush took office, the top rate on dividends was down to 39.6 percent and the rate on long-term capital gains was just 20 percent—far below the rates Ronald Reagan inherited. It is very implausible that these rates were in the “prohibitive” range of the Laffer curve, such that a rate reduction would raise revenue. But even if we grant the theory, how likely is it that the recent rise in revenue owes anything to this effect? Again, not much. The fact is that it is only in very exceptional circumstances that there would even be the possibility of a tax cut that would so stimulate growth that it would pay for itself. Even the Bush Administration admits this. The 2003 Economic Report of the President (pp. 57-58) says, “Although the economy grows in response to tax reductions…it is unlikely to grow so much that lost tax revenue is completely recovered by the higher level of economic activity.” Recent academic research suggests that feedback effects would offset only a fraction of the static revenue loss, that which would result from no effect on consumption or incentives. A 2004 study by Harvard economists N. Gregory Mankiw and Larry Weinzierl found that a cut in taxes on capital might recoup 17 of the static revenue loss in the first three years and a cut in taxes on labor could recoup 13 percent. Mankiw served as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Bush. A study by the Congressional Budget Office in December 2005 found that a tax rate cut would recoup at most 20 percent of the static revenue loss in the first five years. Overall federal revenues are just barely back to where they were five years ago in nominal terms.</p></blockquote>
<p>In the comment box of Brad’s post, we see a link to <a href="http://gsbwww.uchicago.edu/fac/austan.goolsbee/research/laf.pdf"> Evidence on the High-Income Laffer Curve from Six Decades of Tax Reform </a> written by Austan Goolsbee in 1999:<br />
<blockquote>This paper has used evidence from seven different tax changes since 1922 to examine the evidence in support of the high-income Laffer curve and the New Tax Responsiveness Literature &#8230; While that work emphasizes the potential importance of behavioral responses to marginal tax rates, the results in this paper suggest that the evidence on which those conclusions are based—evidence from the 1980s—is atypical in the historical experience. Using the same methods that NTR authors have used for the 1980s, the elasticities of taxable income calculated for other tax changes seem to be much more modest with several indistinguishable from zero. This is true in the aggregate cross-sectional tax return data as well as in panel data on executive compensation. The largest estimates of the taxable income elasticity from all of the previous historical periods is lower than the smallest estimates of the elasticity in the literature based on the 1980s. Given the importance of the behavioral response to taxation, it is my hope that this will stimulate further research on the topic using data outside of conventional tax returns in the 1980s and 1990s. The notion that governments could raise more money by cutting rates is, indeed, a glorious idea. It would permit a Pareto improvement of the most enjoyable kind. Unfortunately for all of us, the data from the historical record suggest that it is unlikely to be true at anything like today’s marginal tax rates. It seems that, for now at least, we will have to keep paying for our tax cuts the old fashioned way.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>Joining what some are calling the nation&#8217;s largest mobilization of immigrants ever, hundreds of thousands of people boisterously marched in downtown Los Angeles Saturday to protest federal legislation that would crack down on undocumented immigrants, penalize those who help them and build a security wall on the U.S. southern border. Spirited crowds representing labor, religious groups, civil-rights advocates and ordinary immigrants stretched over 26 blocks of downtown Los Angeles from Adams Blvd. along Spring Street and Broadway to City Hall, tooting kazoos, waving American flags and chanting &#8220;Si se puede!&#8221; (Yes we can!). The crowd, estimated by police at more than 500.000, represented one of the largest protest marches in Los Angeles history, surpassing Vietnam War demonstrations and the 70,000 who rallied downtown against Proposition 187, a 1994 state initiative that denied public benefits to undocumented migrants. The marchers included both longtime residents and the newly arrived, bound by a desire for a better life and a love for this county.</p></blockquote>
<p>I say good for them!  <a href="http://talkleft.com/new_archives/014383.html">Talkleft</a> covers the LA protests as well as <a href="http://talkleft.com/new_archives/013417.html">HR 4437</a>, which is the legislation that prompted this protest. </p>
<p>Whereas Pat Buchanan is against not only the free flow of goods but also against allowing more immigration, I’ve expressed my general sentiments for free trade in goods as well as capital – so it would be hypocritical of me not to support labor mobility even across national borders.  I bring up Mr. Buchanan as he recently stated that President Bush is to the left of Senator Clinton on this issue.  </p>
<p>Even as I want to say I support the President’s position, we should note what <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2006_03/008498.php">Kevin Drum</a> said about the guest worker proposal:<br />
<blockquote>If we truly decide that we want to keep immigration limited, then we should face down the low-wage business bloc of the Republican Party and get serious about keeping illegal immigrants out of the country in the first place. But if we want to allow more legal immigrants into the country — as a guest worker program tacitly acknowledges — then we should encourage them to be good citizens by offering them the chance to earn actual citizenship. Because they don&#8217;t do that, guest worker programs end up perpetuating both a culture of low-wage labor that&#8217;s ripe for exploitation and insular communities that have no incentive to think of themselves as Americans — because they aren&#8217;t. It&#8217;s the worst of both worlds.</p></blockquote>
<p>While <a href="http://voxbaby.blogspot.com/2006/03/should-they-stay-or-should-they-go.html">Andrew Samwick</a> is generally supportive of President Bush’s efforts, he seems to agree with Kevin on this particular point.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>David Brooks appeared on the St. Patrick’s Day edition of <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/political_wrap/jan-june06/bo_3-17.html">The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer</a> and made this sensible comment:<br />
<blockquote>You choose the reality you want to see. And, then, the Clinton years, when you had the reverse, this time, it was the Republicans&#8217; turn to be more pessimistic and wrong. People choose the reality that flatters themselves.</p></blockquote>
<p>This statement certainly applies to those small government conservatives who worship at the alter of St. Ronald Reagan – as witnessed by all the recent revisionist history as to the level of Federal spending relative to GDP during the 1980’s.  But it was this statement that drew fire from <a href="http://mediamatters.org/items/200603210007">Media Matters</a>:<br />
<blockquote>People choose the reality that &#8211; that flatters their partisanship. For example, in the Reagan years, unemployment went from 13 percent to 5 percent. If you asked Democrats, at the end of that, did unemployment go up or down under Reagan, 60 percent said it went up. Republicans said down. </p></blockquote>
<p>I know conservatives love to paint Jimmy Carter as an awful President but doesn’t Mr. Brooks have inflation and unemployment confused here?  After all, the highest unemployment rate in the post World War II era was 10.8% &#8211; not 13% &#8211; and that occurred a couple of years into the Reagan term of office.  If you are old as I am, you might recall the 1984 GOP campaign slogan called <a href="http://www.opinionjournal.com/editorial/feature.html?id=110007843">Morning in America</a> with the operative lie being put forward to voters back then that it was Jimmy Carter who presided over the 1982 recession.  Yes, we had a recession during Carter’s term, just as we had a recession during Bush41’s term.  In both cases, the economy was slowly recovering with the unemployment rate just over 7% when their Administrations were turned over to Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton, respectively.  </p>
<p>Also notice this line from the recent WSJ oped “Still Morning in America”:<br />
<blockquote>Where Republicans have most strayed from the Reagan vision has been on controlling federal spending.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Really?</em></strong>  Twenty years ago – this same rightwing crowd blamed the Reagan deficits on too much spending rather than those Reagan tax cuts.  </p>
<p>While Mr. Brooks wishes to see a “reality” divorced from the facts, I have provided graphs of the unemployment rates during both the Reagan and the Clinton terms.  Given that George W. Bush has been the worst President in at least my lifetime, I can see why folks would long for the good old days.  I especially have sympathy for conservatives given that they were the ones who supported Bush for President some six years ago.  But if one has to praise Ronald Reagan by misrepresenting the historical record- why even bother?</p>

<blockquote>My whole point is to put middle-class entitlements on the table and to cut them substantially. Even though you may disagree with it, that&#8217;s not a free lunch, and it&#8217;s deeply unfair to claim it is. It&#8217;s also designed to protect the really needy. It&#8217;s interesting, though, that the big government left is so hostile to small government conservatives.</p></blockquote>
<p>I hope that I was not hostile when I <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/03/balancing-budget-andrew-sullivans.html">wrote</a>:<br />
<blockquote>if we decide to cut Social Security benefits in order to privative Social Security, wouldn’t that also imply that we would be reducing payroll contributions? If so, these joint reductions do nothing to reduce the General Fund deficit. Of course, we could cut benefits and keep payroll contributions at their current levels, which should be seen as a backdoor employment tax increase.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let me make this simple for Mr. Sullivan.  Some of us on the left realize that middle-class workers want a government run defined benefits program, which is why we on the left applauded the 1983 Social Security commission appointed by Ronald Reagan.  This program raised payroll contributions in order to finance our Social Security benefits.  If conservatives like Robert Barro wish to reverse this and give back our payroll contributions and scrap the Social Security program, we on the left might disagree but we applaud the intellectual honesty of Dr. Barro for saying there is no free lunch.  WHICH MEANS (just in case Mr. Sullivan has not yet figured this out) that this joint reduction in benefits and payroll taxes will not reduce the General Fund deficit by a single penny.</p>
<p>Now if Mr. Sullivan wants to retain those high payroll taxes and slash Social Security benefits, could he bother to have the intellectual integrity to realize that his proposal represents a huge backdoor employment tax increase.  Or am I asking too much?  Maybe he has not figured out the simple point.</p>
<p><strong><em>Update</em></strong>: <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_comment/darda200603240746.asp">Michael Darda</a> tries to convince his readers that taxes have increased but not as quickly as spending:<br />
<blockquote>The latest Treasury data show that tax receipts continued to expand at a rapid 14.1 percent annual pace during the last 12 months through February … Since 2001, federal government spending has risen at a 6.6 percent pace, more than two times the 3.1 percent annual average that prevailed from 1993 to 2000. If federal spending had simply compounded by 3.1 percent per annum since 2001 &#8211; matching the 1993-2000 average &#8211; the fiscal budget would actually have been in surplus by $143 billion in February 2006.</p></blockquote>
<p>AB readers – fire away at this spin! And when you are done &#8211; check out how Darda attacks Rubinomics using Keynesian economics that Darda fails to really grasp.</p>
<p><strong>Update II</strong>: Forgive me, but I have to put Darda’s spin about higher taxes in a little context.  In 2005, nominal taxes were only 3.6% higher than they were in 2000.  Let’s compare this to a few other percentage increases over the same period:</p>
<p>Nominal GDP: 27.2% (taxes as a share of GDP FELL).<br />GDP deflator: 12.2% (taxes fell in real terms).</p>
<p>Did I mention the fact that the population grew, which implies constant dollar (real) taxes per capita fell rather dramatically.</p>
<p>Since I’m assuming Michael Darda understands the concept real per capita, why would he write such utterly misrepresenting nonsense in the first place?  After all, does he assume that the readers of the National Review are THAT stupid?  I know, I know – we’ve been over this before.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Every month the Commerce Department (in a joint project with the Census Division) releases an estimate of how many new orders US manufacturers have received for durable goods.  Durable goods are all sorts of goods that are intended to last at least 3 years &#8211; things like home appliances, cars, computers, manufacturing equipment, and certain defense industry products.  Trends in the new orders that manufacturers receive for such goods are assumed to be a pretty good indicator of the direction of manufacturing activity in the US over coming months.</p>
<p>The release also details new orders specifically for the durable goods that businesses buy, i.e. capital goods.  Trends in capital goods tell us something slightly different &#8211; when firms (both manufacturing and service-sector firms) are ordering lots of capital goods, that is a good indication that they expect their business to do well in coming months and years.  So the capital goods data can be taken as a possible indicator of overall future economic activity (or at least business expectations thereof), rather than just manufacturing activity.</p>
<p>Both of these series are of interest because they may tell us something about the future, unlike most data series which simply tell us about the past.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.census.gov/indicator/www/m3/">Today&#8217;s report</a> showed an increase in both durable goods orders and capital goods orders in February.  However, this monthly data is notoriously volatile, so what happens in one particular month tells us little.  To get a better idea of what this data tells us we should look at trends over time.  The following chart illustrates.</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/dur_goods.jpg"><br />Note: I&#8217;ve removed the effects of inflation and expressed both series in year 2005 dollars, using the seasonally adjusted producer price index for durable goods.</p>
<p>The chart shows that US manufacturers have seen a nice uptick in their order book over the past year, finally pushing their orders back to the level of the peak of the last economic expansion.  However, much of this activity has been confined to the defense industry, the consumer durables industry, and the aircraft industry.  Excluding those industries we see that the orders for capital goods that all other businesses in the US are placing have only just crept up to 1998 levels.</p>
<p>This is an important part of the story about the US&#8217;s recovery from the last recession.  Business spending has been ususually weak for an economic recovery.  Instead, the recovery has been led by consumer spending and <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/03/keynes-lives.html">government  spending</a>, primarily on defense.  </p>
<p>Now if only we could figure out <em>why</em> most US firms have seemed so reluctant to invest in new capital equipment over the past 5 years.  I&#8217;d also like to know how this squares with the substantial and steady growth in <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/03/expanding-production-expanding_17.html">industrial capacity</a> that we&#8217;ve seen over the same period&#8230;</p>

                                <p>As if <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/03/discretionary-spending-growth.html">on cue</a>, today <a href="http://bartlett.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=11">Bruce Bartlett</a> (from behind the NYTimes pay-only fence) offers a thorough explanation for why he &#8211; unlike almost all other conservatives in the US &#8211; understands the US&#8217;s fiscal predicament:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>The Real Budget Crunchers</strong></p>
<p>Recently, there has been some discussion on the blogs about growth of the federal budget deficit under President Bush and what measures would be necessary to balance the budget without raising taxes. When I thought this matter through a few years ago, I concluded that it was impossible to cut spending enough to avoid a major tax increase. Moreover, I concluded that the magnitude of the tax increase was so great that it could only be achieved by adding a significant new revenue source — a value-added tax, or V.A.T. — to the federal tax system on top of all the other taxes. Today, I would like to walk people through the data sources so that they can draw their own conclusions about what needs to be done and what might be possible.</p>
<p>&#8230;The budget office data show that between 2000 and 2005, the federal budget went from a surplus of 2.4 percent of gross domestic product to a deficit of 2.6 percent. This has resulted from a fall in federal revenues of 3.4 percent of G.D.P. and a rise in spending of 1.7 percent. The fall in revenue resulted almost entirely from a decline in personal income taxes, which have dropped from 10.3 percent of G.D.P. in 2000 to 7.5 percent in 2005. Contrary to popular belief, corporate taxes have actually risen a bit while all other revenues are about the same as a share of G.D.P.</p>
<p>On the spending side, most of the increase — 1.6 percent of gross domestic product — has been for so-called discretionary programs, those requiring annual appropriations&#8230; [and] within the discretionary accounts, most of the increase has been for defense, which has risen by 1 percent of G.D.P. Domestic discretionary programs have risen by 0.4 percent.</p>
<p>Some people will look at these numbers and say that the Bush tax cuts are the principal cause of the rise in the deficit. If we simply repeal the tax cuts, much of the deficit will disappear&#8230; Others will look at the data and say that almost all the increase in spending is due to the “war on terror” and should be excused.  But whether justified or not, the Iraq War is still going to cost a great deal for many years to come.</p>
<p>&#8230;Where I really fault President Bush on the budget is with the Medicare drug benefit, which he rammed through Congress in 2003 and which will raise spending far into the future. According to the 2005 Medicare trustees report, the future unfunded liability for Medicare Part A is 2.5 percent of G.D.P. in perpetuity (page 64). The unfunded liability of Medicare Part B is 2.7 percent of G.D.P. (page 101). And the unfunded liability of Medicare Part D, the drug benefit, is 1.9 percent of G.D.P. (page 112). In other words, we would need to increase taxes by 7.1 percent of G.D.P. immediately and forever just to pay for all the Medicare benefits that have been promised — an amount close to what is now raised by the individual income tax.</p>
<p>By the way, the 2005 Social Security trustees report says that the unfunded liability of that program, which Mr. Bush told us over and over again was in dire need of a fix last year, has an unfunded liability of just 1.2 percent of G.D.P. (page 60) — virtually nothing compared to Medicare’s problems. This is especially so when one considers that pension obligations can be estimated very accurately, while those for health care spending are very difficult to predict because of changes in technology and other factors.</p>
<p>In short, President Bush got everything backwards. He made the Medicare problem far worse when he should have been making every possible effort to improve its finances. Then he wasted an enormous amount of energy on Social Security reform when that program’s financial problems are a fraction of Medicare’s. And by failing to fix Social Security, he has still left this as a problem for a future president to deal with.</p>
<p>&#8230;What all these studies show is the same order of magnitude. Federal spending as a share of gross domestic product is going to rise by about 10 percentage points of G.D.P. over the next generation — the equivalent of $1.2 trillion per year in today’s economy — simply because of the aging of society, even if no new government programs are enacted. To prevent [this] just through cutting spending would require the abolition of every single thing the government does other than Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid — including the entire Department of Defense.</p>
<p>Obviously, this is not going to happen. And given the political clout of the elderly — who vote in the highest percentages of any age group in society — it seems unrealistic to me that significant savings can be achieved by cutting programs that benefit them. Although some relatively modest program changes, like raising the retirement age, could save large sums over time, such changes require long phase-in periods to allow people to adjust. Thus we are still left with a huge increase in spending as a share of the economy for the foreseeable future. In a future post, I will explain why I think a value added tax is the best way to deal with this reality.</p></blockquote>
<p>I can&#8217;t really find anything in Bruce&#8217;s post to argue with&#8230;</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>I&#8217;ve been thinking some more about one of the points made in <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/03/next-recession_22.html">my earlier post</a> about the policy tools that will be available to combat the next recession.  One thing struck me as deserving a bit more investigation: the role of fiscal policy in pulling the US economy out of the last recession.  Specifically, can we measure the role that government spending has played in the current recovery?  Put another way, can we quantify the good old-fashioned Keynesian effects of federal fiscal policy?</p>
<p>One obvious thing to do might be to look at changes in total employment, and changes in government employment.  If the government hired more people, then that would certainly have helped the US economy more generally.  But as the following chart shows, the government sector has not added an unusual number of jobs in recent years.  </p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/empl_decomposition2.jpg"><br />Note: Federal employment data excludes Post Office employees.  Government employment for census years (e.g. the year 2000) is taken as the average between the year before and year after the census year.</p>
<p>While the federal government has stopped shrinking in terms of number of employees, neither has it grown much.  State and local governments have added workers to their payrolls, but not at an unusually rapid rate.  (Note that most of those new S &#038; L workers are teachers; about 800,000 of the S &#038; L employees added between 2000 and 2005 are in education.)</p>
<p>But this is a rather unsatisfactory analysis of the effect of increased government spending on the economy.  That&#8217;s because a large proportion of government spending &#8211; particularly at the federal level &#8211; doesn&#8217;t put more workers on the government payroll, but instead involves hiring private-sector firms to provide goods and services for the government.  For example, increased defense spending has largely gone toward more and larger government contracts to buy defense goods from the private sector.  That impact on the economy can not be measured by looking at government employment.</p>
<p>So instead I prefer a different approach.  In the following table I have decomposed changes in the total employment in the US into two broad categories: &#8220;job losses&#8221; due to higher productivity, since productivity growth means that the economy can produce any given amount of output using fewer workers; and &#8220;job gains&#8221; due to higher demand.  The table further breaks down the &#8220;job gains&#8221; due to higher demand into the major sub-categories of demand: C (spending by consumers), I (spending by businesses), M (imports), exports, and government spending.</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/empl_decomposition1.jpg"><br />Sources: BEA national income data, and BLS employment data.<br />Note: For simplicity, I (unrealistically) assume that each type of demand growth has the same impact on employment.</p>
<p>Thanks to the rapid productivity growth of the period 2000-05, in 2005 the US economy could have produced everything that was demanded in the year 2000 using about 14 million fewer workers than were actually employed in 2000.  However, demand grew over that period, too.  So for example, higher consumer and business spending (with imports subtracted from those categories, since we should only count that spending in C and I that went toward domestically-produced goods and services) meant that around 11 million additional workers had to be employed in the US compared to what would have been the case if consumer and business demand had remained at year-2000 levels.  </p>
<p>The interesting thing to note is that higher government spending &#8211; and in particular higher spending by the federal government &#8211; accounted for an unusually large share of the growth in demand over the past 5 years.  Higher spending by the federal government meant that roughly two million more people had to be employed to meet that demand than would have been the case if federal spending had remained at the levels of 2000.  Note that of the $160 bn increase in annual real federal spending between 2000 and 2005, $130 bn of that was for defense spending.</p>
<p>What does this mean?  In a nutshell, this data tells a story of an economy that has been strongly influenced by federal government spending.  If it hadn&#8217;t been for the defense boom, in particular, it seems possible that the slow employment growth during the period 2000-05 would actually have been close to zero.  The tried-and-true Keynesian prescription of having the government spend its way out of recession seems to have worked.</p>
<p>Naturally, this analysis significantly understates the impact of fiscal policy on the economy over the past 5 years because it doesn&#8217;t attempt to measure the effects of the tax cuts.  It seems safe to suppose that a good portion of the increased consumer and business spending in recent years is the result of lower taxes.  Putting that together with this spending analysis would show that fiscal policy had an even larger role in the economic recovery.  </p>
<p>The implication for the next recession is sobering, however.  Given that the persistent federal budget deficit means that we are unlikely to see another surge in federal government spending, or another round of major tax cuts, fiscal policy probably won&#8217;t be able to come to the rescue the next time that there&#8217;s a recession.  Old-fashioned Keynesianism helped to rescue the US economy from the last recession.  But it won&#8217;t the next one.</p>

<p>If you look closely at the above list, you&#8217;ll see a category that sounds a lot like what we do here at Angry Bear: <a href="http://wampum.wabanaki.net/vault/2006/03/002519.html">Best Expert Blog</a>. And indeed, our blog is one of the finalists, for the third year running I believe. It looks like we&#8217;re currently being trounced by the estimable <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/">Pharyngula</a> (a really good blog focused mostly on biology, evolution, and octopus love). But the polls are still open &#8212; just record<a href="http://wampum.wabanaki.net/vault/2006/03/002519.html"> your vote</a> in the comments (please do not vote more than once).</p>

<p>P.S. The good folks at Wampum (Mary Beth, Dwight, and EBW) put a tremendous amount of time, effort, and bandwidth expense into the Koufax Awards each year. So if you&#8217;re a fan of these awards and you&#8217;re so inclined, you may want to consider making <a href="http://wampum.wabanaki.net/vault/2006/03/002529.html">a small donation</a>.</p>

                                <p>It&#8217;s been quite amusing recently to watch conservatives such as <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/03/balancing-budget-andrew-sullivans.html">Andrew Sullivan</a> wrestle with the question of how they would balance the budget.  The fundamental problem that they face is that the types of government spending that they want to cut just don&#8217;t add up to many dollars.  Similarly, the growth in spending that they imagine has happened under Bush has been confined overwhelmingly to those types of spending that they like.</p>
<p>The following table is an update of something I&#8217;ve put up before.  It takes the spending that was enacted for 2006 for all discretionary items and compares it to spending in 2001.</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/budget_growth1.jpg"><br />Source: <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/showdoc.cfm?index=7069&#038;sequence=0">CBO</a>.  2001 figures inflated by the change in the GDP price deflator to show them in 2006 dollars.  Figures include supplemental appropriations for 2006 for Iraq, Katrina, etc.</p>
<p>In per capita terms and adjusted for inflation, all non-defense discretionary spending grew by only 14% during the period 2001-06, which is an average growth rate of 2.7% per year.  Not exactly what I would call runaway growth.  </p>
<p>This brings me to one of the few ways in which I actually agree with Bush&#8217;s assessment of his own presidency: when he claims that he has held down the growth of non-defense discretionary spending, I think he&#8217;s basically right. The cause of today&#8217;s budget deficit is <em><strong>not</strong></em> the growth in non-defense discretionary spending.  The causes of the budget deficit are higher defense spending, higher health care costs, and tax cuts.</p>
<p>The implication, of course, is a simple one, though it still escapes many conservatives (though not all; see <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/12/bartlett-on-taxes.html">Bruce Bartlett</a>, for example): it will be impossible to reverse the general fund deficit (i.e. the deficit excluding the SS surplus) of the past 5 years without doing some combination of a) cutting defense spending; b) radically reforming the nation&#8217;s health care system to bring down health care costs; and c) raising taxes.  Conservatives that honestly believe in fiscal prudence will have to embrace those options before they will ever be able to come up with a deficit-reduction proposal that is actually credible.</p>
