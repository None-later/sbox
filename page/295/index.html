<p>If I had to pick out the two biggest sources of confusion about Social Security finance it would have to be one, the relation of the Trust Funds to Public Debt and two, the relation of Social Security surplus/deficits to Budget Scoring. At Angry Bear we have discussed the equation Debt Held by the Public + Intragovernmental Holdings = Public Debt enough that most regular readers probably get it. So today I want to lay out some definitions and explanations of &#8216;on-budget&#8217; directly from the source.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2011/assets/concepts.pdf">Office of Management and Budget: Budget Concepts and Budget Process</a> This comes from Section 12 of OMB&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/Analytical_Perspectives">Analytical Perspectives on the Budget</a> which is the explanatory supplement to the Budget itself. The best guide to it is <a target='_blank"' href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2011/assets/list.pdf">List of Charts and Tables</a> where the lead number refers to the Section, with Section 5 being &#8216;Long Term Budget Outlook&#8217; (compare with CBO&#8217;s report with the same title), Section 6 being &#8216;Federal Borrowing and Debt&#8217;, and Section 27 &#8216;Trust Funds and Federal Funds&#8217;. Not exciting reads, but full of good to know information. Under the fold I have extracted from Section 12 &#8216;Budget Concepts and Budget Process&#8217; the portion discussing the difference between &#8216;On-budget&#8217; and &#8220;Unified Budget&#8221; &#8216;.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><a href="http://reddit.com/submit"> <img src="http://reddit.com/static/spreddit7.gif" alt="submit to reddit" border="0"></a> p. 134<br />
<blockquote>Every year since 1971, however, at least one Federal entity that would otherwise be included in the budget has been declared to be off-budget by law. Such off-budget Federal entities are federally owned and controlled, but their transactions are excluded, by law, from the rest of the budget totals, which are also known as “on-budget” totals. When a Federal entity is off-budget by law, its receipts, budget authority, outlays, and surplus or deficit are separated from all other (on-budget) receipts, budget authority, outlays, and surplus or deficit. The budget reflects the legal distinction between on-budget entities and off- budget entities by showing outlays and receipts for both types of entities separately.   </p>
<p>Although there is a legal distinction between on-budget and off-budget entities, there is no conceptual difference between the two. The off-budget Federal entities engage in the same kinds of governmental activities as the on- budget entities, and the programs of off-budget entities result in the same kind of outlays and receipts as on-budget entities. The “unified budget” reflects the conceptual similarity between on-budget and off-budget entities by showing combined totals of outlays and receipts for both types of entities.   </p>
<p>The off-budget Federal entities currently consist of the Postal Service Fund and the two Social Security Trust Funds: Old-Age and Survivors Insurance and Disability Insurance. Social Security has been classified as off-budget since 1986 and the Postal Service Fund has been classified as off-budget since 1990.  A number of other entities that had been declared off-budget by law at different times before 1986 have been classified as on-budget by law since at least 1985.</p></blockquote>
<p>So in examining Table 12-1 we can see that for all practical purposes &#8216;Off-budget&#8217; = Social Security (the Postal Service Fund showing little activity) while &#8216;Total&#8217; Surplus or Deficit = the so-called &#8220;Unified Deficit&#8221;, in quotes because in law there is no longer any such thing, it is just a very convenient reporting number.</p>
<p>Hopefully this will help clear up some rampant terminological confusion, if not fuller explanations are available in the various sections of the Analytical Perspectives.</p>

<p>Bradley Birkenfeld, the UBS banker who opened the floodgates of information on the bank&#8217;s nefarious practices of aiding and abetting tax evasion, is currently in prison.  But he has also done a tell-all interview with the Global Post, a series that began on August 5.  See  Michael Bronner, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/europe/100724/swiss-banking-secrecy">Telling Swiss Secrets: A Banker&#8217;s Betrayal</a>, GlobalPost, Aug. 5, 2010.

<p>Remember the banking sequence in the Da Vinci Code movie/book.  A mundane world from the outside reveals itself to be a high-tech world of illusions, where bank vehicles can easily evade police inspectors and move clients beyond their range.  Birkenfeld&#8217;s description of the real Swiss bank is not so different&#8211;or if anything seems more surreal, since the bank even taught its bankers how to fool FBI and customs inspectors in order to move client assets around without the authorities knowledge. As the article notes:</p>
<p>The bank had held training sessions for cross-border bankers on how to elude FBI and U.S. Customs scrutiny when traveling with sensitive bank documents; how to obscure client information on PDAs and encrypted laptops; and various other evasive trade craft not usually associated with honest banking. Birkenfeld had the pilfered PowerPoints to prove it.</p>
<p>***<br /><a name="more"></a><br />The bank would admit to intentionally subverting U.S. tax laws and defrauding the U.S. government by sending dozens of unregistered bankers, Birkenfeld among them, to the United States on thousands of illegal trips to facilitate tax evasion schemes for wealthy U.S.-based clients — a fraud hiding as much as $20 billion in secret undeclared accounts and earning UBS up to $200 million a year in ill-begotten profits.  Id.</p>
<p>Birkenfeld&#8217;s lifestyle, of course, was similar to the Wall Street titans with their million-dollar bonuses eating holes in their pockets.</p>
<p>He cultivated contacts among event organizers so he could swing VIP treatment for himself and his clients. &#8220;I just generally spent money the way I saw fit,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I wouldn’t go out and buy somebody a Rolex, but I mean, if I spent $500 for a lunch I could justify it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Birkenfeld got paid, too: A starting salary of 180,000 Swiss francs (just over $170,000) plus an American-style bonus, which in his best year, he said, put him at one million Swiss francs in total compensation (about $946,000). When home from the road, Birkenfeld drove a BMW M5 and split time between a plush apartment in Geneva and a chalet in the shadow of the Matterhorn in the Swiss Alps.  Id, Part II.</p>
<p>Birkenfeld&#8217;s defection was a game-changer.  The IRS got some names right away, thousands through an amnesty program that had clout because of the settlement with UBS which promised 4500 names, and with the Swiss Parliament&#8217;s decision in June, those thousands more.  Each account name provides tie-ins to other sources of information&#8211;Bahamian or Singaporean companies, bankers, lawyers, etc.  UBS is not the only bank whose secret operations will be exposed with the new information provided by those who came in under the IRS amnesty program&#8211;Credit Suisse and HSBC are also under investigation, as the article notes; and German authorities have purchased additional information on secret bank accounts, which led to German raids on Credit Suisse&#8217;s German branches in mid-July of this year.  This will provide still more information in months to come.</p>

<p>Projected growth in spending on the federal government&#8217;s big health and retirement programs&#8211;Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security&#8211;dominates the long-run budget outlook. If current policies continue, that spending is likely to grow significantly faster than the economy as a whole over the next few decades. By 2040, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects those outlays will rise to about 17 percent of gross domestic product (GDP)&#8211;  more than double their current share.  <br /><a target="_blank" href="http://cbo.gov/doc.cfm?index=2517&#038;type=0">CBO report</a> ready for hawking in year 2000. </p>
<p>Was this before or after our deficit hawks started crowing in year 2000?</p>
<p>(a figure virtually identical to current estimates&#8230;oops&#8230;2010)</p>

<p>Perhaps if we dismiss the current hawks we could actually address the issue of deficits.</p>

<p>HEALTH CARE:<strong> The Durable Medical Equipment (DME) mess</strong></p>
<p>So you go to an orthopedic surgeon with a complaint of back pain, and the surgeon orders a lumbar back brace for support.</p>
<p>Can you stop at a counter and buy the brace on the way out the door? Probably not. <br />Years ago some members of Congress (Stark, Waxman, et.al.) thought it would be harmful if physicians profited from their prescriptions, but not harmful for others to do so, and thus has flourished a huge DME industry, ranging from hospitals and national chain pharmacies to mom-and-pop operations. (When I ran ortho centers we subbed out DME, too much hassle and compliance risk.)</p>
<p>Some DME providers get greedy and there has been a significant amounts of fraud in this area, most recently dealing with the ubiquitous motorized wheelchairs and power chairs of television fame.</p>
<p>But the latest DME fraud trend is really disturbing. DME fraud is being committed by phony &#8220;providers&#8221; who tend to be involved with organized crime, immigrant organized crime, computer hackers and identity thieves. These businesses do not exist, have no customers, provide no merchandise and steal billions from the feds with phony billings. Reading the indictments is enlightening.</p>
<p>(A few years ago nearly 50% of all of the diabetic supplies FOR THE ENTIRE COUNTRY were being billed from Miami &#8211; Dade County. Huh? Impossible of course. Miami appears to be a hot bed for immigrant crime.)</p>
<p>The feds caught on somewhat and set up a task force in southern Florida, and now are using the task force in Houston and possibly elsewhere.</p>
<p>Something here aggravates me. Getting a physician Medicare ID number, or adding a physician to an established group, takes a lot of time and a lot of paperwork, even though the physician is licensed and board certified. Apparently though any ambitious criminal can get a DME provider number with almost no hassle and start firing in billings. After a few months the operation closes down, takes the cash and billing starts for a new phony provider. </p>
<p>Medicare needs better management.</p>

                                <p>by Bruce Webb</p>
<p>Exactly a month ago I put up a post <a target="_blank" href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/07/if-social-security-annual-report.html">If a Social Security Annual Report Vanishes into the Forest</a> noting that not only was the Report months overdue but that nobody seemed to notice or care that there was no official announcement about the reasons for the delay or a new release date. The date that had been floated back in April was June 30th, then later some were saying &#8216;July&#8217; and then when July rolled around word around the Capitol was &#8216;August&#8217;. But nobody who knew anything was talking on the record. Then last week of all papers it was the Spokane Spokesman-Review that reported August 5th. But that news was only semi-officially confirmed this week when it was announced that AEI was having a briefing on the Report on Friday the 6th (today) and NASI was having a bigger event on Monday the 9th. But as for any official announcement there was nothing, not at SSA, nor at Treasury or HHS or Labor. Nor was the Report up on the web Thursday morning. It wasn&#8217;t until an hour before official Report release that Labor issued a news release with a link to the pdf of the Report. Well I was ready, a live link to it was up here at 11:22 Eastern, beating the official time by 38 minutes. But all of this leaves this question. Why the secrecy? Three Cabinet Secretaries and the Commissioner of Social Security were scheduled to release a public Report that had implications for every worker and retiree in the country and yet no one knew nothing.</p>
<p>Well the Report appeared and proceeded to make about as little noise as it did when in vanished into the woods, as I type a search on &#8216;2010 Social Security Report&#8217; turns up no MSM links in the top ten, unless you consider HuffPo MSM, and two of the top six results are to my posts here. Now Heritage and the Washington Times (which I don&#8217;t consider MSM) had what appear to be canned pieces up claiming that the Report confirmed their gloomy views but didn&#8217;t seem to address the actual numbers but for the most part there is very little coverage.</p>
<p>Now you can call me a cynic but some of this secrecy  and effective non-coverage may stem from the fact that the Report did not match the current narrative of &#8216;Crisis&#8217;. Instead Trust Fund depletion remained pegged at 2037, the date that cash surpluses vanish moved from 2016 to 2015 while the 75 year actuarial gap actually  dropped significantly from 2.00% to 1.92% putting it right back to 2001 levels. Meaning that a decade of &#8216;Crisis&#8217; has gone by with no action at all and Social Security emerges unchanged. Which leaves all the &#8220;we can&#8217;t afford to wait!&#8221; &#8220;delay will only make the cost larger and more abrupt!!&#8221; folk with a little egg on their faces. Social Security-still not broke.</p>
<p>More notes and an interesting graph under the fold.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/TFw96m_X0gI/AAAAAAAAAY4/Sd4QJkn8vGk/s1600/2010+Fig+IV.B3+TF+Ratios.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/TFw96m_X0gI/AAAAAAAAAY4/Sd4QJkn8vGk/s400/2010+Fig+IV.B3+TF+Ratios.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />For those joining this party late the &#8216;Trust Fund Ratio&#8217; is the Trust Fund balance expressed as a percentage of cost in any even year with the offical target being a TF Ratio of 100, meaning one year of reserves. This is called by the Trustees &#8216;actuarial balance&#8217;. Although we generally talk about THE Social Security Trust Fund, there are actually two, the OAS (Old Age/Survivors) and the DI (Disability) Trust Funds. In this figure OAS is the dark line and DI the light one. Additionally though we also tend to talk about Social Security going deplete in some future year or being able to pay out some percentage of benefits at that date in doing so we are generally referring to what the Trustees call the &#8216;Intermediate Cost Alternative&#8217; in this figure denoted as &#8216;II&#8217;. However they also give us two other Alternatives, a more pessimistic one called &#8216;High Cost&#8217; here &#8216;III&#8217; and a more optimistic one called &#8216;Low Cost&#8217; here &#8216;I&#8217;.  Low Cost and High Cost are fairly artificial in construction as each takes each of the variables that together determine solvency and varies them in the same direction, either better for solvency in the case of Low Cost or worse for High Cost. Since in practice it is not likely that every economic and demographic variable will move in the same direction in the same magnitude these two alternatives have to be regarded as being on the extremes of the probability spread. On the other hand this depends crucially on whether Intermediate Cost has in fact captured the true mean for each variable, if Intermediate Cost can be shown to be on the whole too pessimistic then Low Cost outcomes become more probable, and of course the converse is true. But that will have to be the subject of future posts.</p>
<p>A very common claim about Social Security is that there is no way that we can grow out of &#8216;crisis&#8217;. Well this figure puts that claim in doubt, because while Low Cost may not be totally likely it is at least possible and if it comes about OAS projects to never have a TF Ratio lower than 300, and since the target is only 100 can be said to give a result of &#8216;over-funded&#8217;, if it seems to be coming about then the policy question in the year 2020 will begin to revolve around when to cut FICA and by how much to get that tail pointing closer to 100 than to 450 and rising as it leaves the projection period, Because oddly enough an over-funded Trust Fund is in its own way a bigger threat to Social Security long-term than an under-funded one. (I can point to some older posts on this if anyone cares).</p>
<p>Which brings us to an important point. While it may well be that Low Cost is unlikely, it is not an optimal outcome anyway, instead the sweet spot is somewhere between I and II in this figure and to get there we don&#8217;t have to hit every number of Low Cost, just enough of them in the right magnitudes to pull II&#8217;s tail up so that it intersects 100 at the end of the projection period or at least dips below actuarial balance (the same thing) as far in the future as possible. And many of those numbers are susceptible to deliberate policy choices. For example Social Security outcomes improve with higher immigration and higher fertility, and since immigrants, at least those from developing countries, tend to be more fertile sticking to a policy of closed borders, while maybe appealing to younger Teabaggers in the here and now, plays a certain amount of hell with their future retirement outlook. Equally Social Security solvency is positively correlated with more employment and higher real wage although the effect is offset by the fact that the increased income also results in increased costs in the form of higher benefit checks. But from the perspective of the worker this is all good, it means that any future percentage cut in benefits would be from that much higher a baseline, which means that solvency effects aside a deliberate policy targeting employment and real wage will result in a better Social Security outcome. (Minimum wage increase anyone?). Similarly improvements in productivity, even if they don&#8217;t pass through perfectly to Real Wage, increase affordability by holding down the percentage of GDP needing to be devoted to Social Security, or perhaps assisting us to achieve Prof. Jamie Galbraith&#8217;s appeal to enhance Social Security benefits rather than cut them.</p>
<p>Which suggests  a second prong to the NW Plan. The first prong simply assumes Intermediate Cost numbers and programs in the revenue increases needed to target actuarial balance, the second would be to advocate for policies that make some or all of those tax increments unnecessary. The right answer is not to just passively accept our fate and schedule benefit cuts prematurely, the numbers needed to substantially cut the payroll gap even in the absence of tax increases are by no means out of reach, add a few tenths of a point to productivity and a good deal of &#8216;crisis&#8217; simply vanishes.</p>

The drop in employment stemmed largely from the layoffs of census workers as private sector employment rose some 71,000 as compared to 31,000 last month.<br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/TFwNJt61nHI/AAAAAAAABRY/daQw9V-irzg/s1600/Clipboard01-EMP.bmp"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/TFwNJt61nHI/AAAAAAAABRY/daQw9V-irzg/s320/Clipboard01-EMP.bmp" alt="" border="0"></a><br />Compared to the historic norm employment  employment gains this cycle has been extremely weak, but it is stronger than in the jobless recoveries of the 1990s and 2000s.</p>

The<br />compound growth three month growth rate slipped to 3.0% from a 3.5% growth rate last month.<br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/TFwOU1jDXyI/AAAAAAAABSQ/zuQM0Cx2yP0/s1600/Clipboard04-EMP.bmp"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/TFwOU1jDXyI/AAAAAAAABSQ/zuQM0Cx2yP0/s320/Clipboard04-EMP.bmp" alt="" border="0"></a><br />Average hourly earnings growth continued to slow as the year over year gain was 1.75%.  Because hours worked are expanding the weekly wage gain rose to 3.0%.  With zero inflation in the first half of the year this means that real weekly wages are rising moderately.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/TFwNVxwnijI/AAAAAAAABRg/2qAIuFL36VM/s1600/Clipboard02emp.bmp"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/TFwNVxwnijI/AAAAAAAABRg/2qAIuFL36VM/s320/Clipboard02emp.bmp" alt="" border="0"></a><br />This gain in real weekly earnings has been reflected in the single most important determinant of real consumer spending, real disposable income excluding transfers.  The year over year change in this measure just turned positive for the first time this cycle.</p>

<p>Update: Rdan here  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.parade.com/news/intelligence-report/archive/100808-hey-big-spenders.html">Take the quiz now&#8230;hey big spenders</a></p>
<p><strong>Status Report on Presimetrics</strong></p>
<p>The Intelligence Report column in Parade Magazine, the newspaper that appears in Sunday newspapers across the country, wrote a short quiz based on Presimetrics.  It will appear in this Sunday&#8217;s issue.  </p>
<p>Michael Kanell and I will log in to the <a href="http://www.parade.com/news/intelligence-report/quiz/presidential-quiz.html">quiz&#8217;s site</a> a few times on Sunday and (if all goes well) once more Monday to answer questions anyone might have about the book.  </p>
<p>Meanwhile, I just got a copy of the book, and it looks very nice.  I believe they&#8217;ll be shipping copies of the book to bookstores within days.  Additionally, the publisher is working on a number of other media appearances.  </p>

                                <p>I spent the last hours of last night watching the PBS &#8220;Human Experience&#8221; episode on the <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/films/ccc/player/">Civilian Conservation Corps</a>.  A few million people put to work: for long hours, living in Army barracks, with all but $5 of their pay having to be sent home every week.  Gosh, sounds just right as part of <a href="http://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2009/03/20/just-when-i-thought-i-was-out/">FDR&#8217;s Conservative First 100 Days</a>.</p>
<p>The documentary makes a couple of things clear: (1) it kept about 3,000,000 people busier than they would have been otherwise* and (2) when the time finally came to enter WW II, those three million were in better shape than they would have been, and were prime volunteers without whom results might have been very different.</p>
<p>Even independent of what it produced, what&#8217;s not to like? No wonder it was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilian_Conservation_Corps">the most popular Depression-Era program</a>.</p>
<p>Doesn&#8217;t it seem like something the new Administration might have wanted to emulate?  Well, it did&#8230;</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>In late March of 2008, Neil Maher, guest-blogging at The Edge of the American West, was clear: even as the crisis was growing, <a href="http://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2008/03/31/it%E2%80%99s-time-for-a-new-and-improved-ccc/">a New and Improved CCC</a> would prepare the U.S. for the next fifty years, even as the old one prepared it for the fifty that followed it.<br />
<blockquote>Brazil has recently begun looking back to Franklin Roosevelt’s CCC to help solve that country’s economic and environmental problems&#8230;The goal of Brazil’s CCC-like program, which the Nature Conservancy helped initiate, is to plant one billion trees over the next ten years across the country’s Atlantic Forest. Rather than funding the program by increasing taxes, Brazil will rely on novel market mechanisms including the sale of sequestration vouchers on the international carbon market, obtained through the program’s reforestation efforts, as well as the collection of water use fees in the reforested regions. Similar tree-planting programs reminiscent of Franklin Roosevelt&#8217;s CCC are also now operating in China along the Yangtze River and through Wangari Maathai&#8217;s Greenbelt Movement in Kenya. Even war-torn Afghanistan has created its own &#8220;Afghan Conservation Corps.&#8221;</p>
<p>The United States needs to follow suit, and the upcoming election is a good place to start. Hillary Clinton openly calls for the creation of a “green economy” centered on a cap and trade system for carbon emissions that will help create five million new jobs. Barack Obama wants to develop a program that rewards those who plant trees, restore grassland, or undertake farming practices that capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Even John McCain, who claims fellow Republican and early conservationist Teddy Roosevelt as his hero, proposes to limit carbon emissions as president. A new and improved Civilian Conservation Corps, one which enrolls women as well as men and focuses its efforts on fighting global warming, would allow all of these candidates to turn campaign rhetoric into post-election reality.</p></blockquote>
<p>Catching up on my blog reading today, I came across <a href="http://capitalgainsandgames.com/blog/andrew-samwick/1880/five-myths-about-bush-tax-cuts-and-scourge-stimulus">a recent Andrew Samwick post</a> in which he reposted a link from December of 2008—just after the election—to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/07/us/politics/07radio.html">this NYT article</a>:<br />
<blockquote>President-elect Barack Obama promised Saturday to create the largest public works construction program since the inception of the interstate highway system a half century ago as he seeks to put together a plan to resuscitate the reeling economy&#8230;.</p>
<p>Mr. Obama’s remarks showcased his ambition to expand the definition of traditional work programs for the middle class, like infrastructure projects to repair roads and bridges, to include new-era jobs in technology and so-called green jobs that reduce energy use and global warming emissions. &#8220;We need action — and action now,&#8221; Mr. Obama said in an address broadcast Saturday morning on radio and YouTube&#8230;.</p>
<p>It would cover a range of programs to expand broadband Internet access, to make government buildings more energy efficient, to improve information technology at hospitals and doctors&#8217; offices, and to upgrade computers in schools.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is unacceptable that the United States ranks 15th in the world in broadband adoption,&#8221; Mr. Obama said. &#8220;Here, in the country that invented the Internet, every child should have the chance to get online.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Twenty months later, I can&#8217;t even find an outline of this in the policies proposed or passed.</p>
<p>Whither the New CCC?  Whither preparation for competing with the Chinese in the mid- and late 21st century? Whither developing job skills to ensure that broadband isn&#8217;t just <a href="http://www.michaelmoore.com/words/must-read/google-verizon-deal-end-internet-we-know-it">something Google sells to Verison</a>?  Who will be the people ready to maintain and repair solar cells?<br />

</p>
<p>*Let&#8217;s face it: it&#8217;s a difficult job, spent away from home and family, for basically room and board and a (very) little <em>l&#8217;argent de poche</em>.  Not the type of job you keep if you get a letter from your spouse saying that the local Woolworth&#8217;s is paying $1.00/hour.</p>

<p>Matthew Yglesias has a new argument for encouraging exports of manufactures.  I am not at all convinced.  He seems to be asserting that employment in wholesaling and transportation follows production not sales and so is increased by manufacturing for export.  I really doubt that.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Yglesias <a href="http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/2010/08/exports-and-services/comment-page-1/#comment-1927919">wrote </a>(click to see his graph).</p>
<p>I saw Michigan Governor Jennifer Granholm at CAPAF earlier today and she naturally went on at some length about the importance of preserving manufacturing employment. In the course of doing so she very briefly made the more nuanced point that manufacturing activity supports considerable employment in manufacturing-related services. &#8230; Given the rate of productivity growth in manufacturing, there’s no plausible volume of exports that’s going to sustainably increase manufacturing employment. But that doesn’t mean that exporting more goods won’t boost employment:<br />&#8230; during the pre-recession slump in manufacturing employment—a period in which manufacturing output was growing thanks to increases in productivity—that employment in services related to manufacturing was going up. What kind of services? “Upstream” services are &#8230;.  “Downstream” services are wholesaling and transportation. When output collapses, this dries up, but if we had an export-driven increase in output we’d see increases in these fields even if manufacturing employment per se doesn’t really rise. </p>
<p>I am very not convinced </p>
<p>Downstream Services are wholesaling and transport.  Hmmm isn&#8217;t retailing downstream ?  That would be a problem wouldn&#8217;t it ?  You know that retailing of exports happens over there.  I do not believe that a significant fraction of the downstream services are transport and wholesaling for export.  How could that be ?  It can&#8217;t take that much labor to take things from a factory to a port and then the container is just put on a ship.  </p>
<p>I suspect that most employment in transporting and wholesaling manufactured goods is, like retailing, transporting and wholesaling goods made anywhere to be sold in country.  Getting the goods to the store is labor intensive.  That doesn&#8217;t depend on whether the good is domestically made or imported.  </p>
<p>You might be able to convince me that you are not totally utterly completely wrong by looking at huge swings of the dollar and huge swings of net merchandise exports.  Hmmm I will check myself.</p>
<p>Well this is very crude, <a href="ftp://ftp.bls.gov/pub/suppl/empsit.ceseeb1.txt">employment by very broad sector from the bls</a>.  Employment in &#8220;trade, transportation and utilities&#8221; roughly corresponds to Yglesias&#8217;s numbers for &#8220;downstream services.&#8221;</p>
<p>I look at the 80s a period of a strongly overvalued dollar and a ballooning trade deficit.  I find employment in &#8220;Trade Transportation and utilities&#8221; grew more than 20% while employment in manufacturing declined.  In the 90s employment in Trade Transportation and Utilities grew less while manufacturing employment was roughly stable. This is crude but there is no evidence for your odd theory that exporting implies lots of jobs in trade and transportation.</p>
<p>Any thoughts ? Anyone ? Rusty ?</p>
