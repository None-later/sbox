<p>In 2009, the IRS provided a generous voluntary disclosure program for people who had money socked into offshore accounts.  See <a href="http://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,id=206012,00.html">2009 Voluntary Disclosure Program</a>, IRS. Ordinarily, the taxes, interest (at 20%), accuracy-related penalty (at 20% of the tax liability) and FBAR penalties &#8211;at 50% of the account amount over several years&#8211;could add up to considerably more than the amount in the account.  The 75% penalty for fraud is a definitepotential, and criminal prosecution (for tax evasion, failure to file a return, filing a false return, etc.) is a possibility too.   The 2009 voluntary disclosure program required taxpayers to reveal all previously undisclosed foreign accounts, amend their returns, and pay all taxes due.  but the penalty charged was much less than the maximum&#8211;20% of the tax liability and 20% of the maximum amount in the account during the relevant period.  See <a href="http://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,id=210027,00.html">Q &#038; A document</a>.</p>
<p>When the ABA tax section met in Boca Raton Florida in late January, IRS officials announced that there will be a second voluntary compliance program for those persons who still have not come forward.  Many practitioners with clients who may decide to participate in this second program had hoped that another would be offered even after the first program ended.  To maintain credibility for future such programs, of course, the IRS will have to be sure that the penalties for disclosure at this later stage will be higher than the penalties for the earlier disclosure program.  Nonetheless, paying the taxes due and a steep but still lesser penalthy while avoiding criminal prosecution should lead a number of the holdouts to disclose. </p>
<p>Someday we will have sufficent information exchange programs that will make hiding assets offshore close to impossible.  But not yet.  So let&#8217;s just hope that the IRS gets enough new information from these additional disclosures that it can pull the lid off even more of the banking secrecy in jurisdictions that have assisted US taxpayers in evading taxes for years.  Each time there are significant new accounts revealed, it should be the case that the IRS will get numbers of leads on key bankers and mechanisms being used to hide assets offshore.  You taxpayers who are gambling that they can get away with tax evasion through their offshore accounts should take notice. This will be your second chance. Now might be a good time to &#8216;fess up.</p>

                                <p>It is an article of faith among many on the Left that the answer is easy: the majority on the Roberts Court is in the tank for the Republican Party. And within certain limits and with qualifications that is my view too. But the question today is WHICH Republican Party? The nativist libertarian leaning Christianist Tea Party?  Or the internationalist corporatist Republicans? And the answer is critically important when it comes to the ACA bill. And the key factor is the individual mandate.</p>
<p>The sideshow of outright repeal was settled last week <a target='_blank"' href="http://opinion.latimes.com/opinionla/2011/02/debate-over-individual-mandate-stuck-in-neutral.html?utm_source=feedburner&#038;utm_medium=feed&#038;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+OpinionLa+%28L.A.+Times+-+Opinion+Blog%29">The debate over the &#8216;individual mandate&#8217;: Stuck in neutral?</a> the Republicans got an up or down vote, albeit with a 60 vote majority needed and ended up with a party line 47-51 vote to waive the budget rule, or not even the 50 votes actually needed to win final passage on the underlying amendment or the final bill to repeal. They had their shot, demonstrated to both sides of the Party that they were willing to do the &#8216;right/Right&#8217; thing, but had to move onto one of the other three paths available: defunding implementation, piecemealing it, or supporting court action. But there is where things fall apart on them. More below the fold.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />Would the insurance companies welcome total repeal and a return to their old business model? Well probably but it would be a mixed bag, because they love the new locked in customer base and tax breaks for small business even as they hate much of the insurance reform. But the biggest and most powerful driver of that locked in customer base is the individual mandate, the worst possible outcome for them is for just that piece to be knocked out via legislation or the courts. For them it is all or nothing, a piecemeal approach being fatal.</p>
<p>Teabaggers come at this from a different directions. Those who start from a more libertarian position detest the individual mandate while the nativist side is driven by darker visions of socialized medicine and death panels but the real point of communality and the focus of their organized efforts is precisely the mandates. These people could conceivably settle on a package that preserved most of the insurance reforms relating to pre-existing conditions as long as mandates were stipped out.</p>
<p>Meaning that any intermediate solution leaves Teabaggers and Insurance companies in diametrically opposed positions, their only common ground being outright repeal. Which leaves the Supreme Court in a bind. Are they really willing to rely so heavily on the lack of a severability clause that they would just steamroll over the intent of Congress on a matter that had been under constant debate for half a century and throw out the whole bill? Or are they more likely to just focus on the actual legal challenge centered on the mandate and possibly just strike down that provision of the law and so leaving insurance companies high and dry? I don&#8217;t know but the vote on Citizens United suggests the majority is weighted towards the corporatist side.</p>
<p>So once again, and starting from the assumption that the Court operates on ideological and Party grounds, which faction are they going to stand with? And this is complicated further by the fact that the interests of other sectors outside big insurance have different stakes in this, if you are a &#8216;small&#8217; to &#8216;large&#8217; business as defined (as opposed to &#8216;largest&#8217;) there is a lot to like in the ACA in the way of subsidies. That is the question&#8217;s answer does not resolve down to &#8216;Republicans&#8217;, that is more a starting point than ending one.</p>

<p><strong>A Few Graphs Describing the Reagan Presidency</strong><br />Cross posted at the <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=325">Presimetrics blog</a>.</p>
<p>On February 6, 2011, Ronald Reagan would have been turned 100 years had he been alive.  In this post I&#8217;d like to share a few graphs from <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/">Presimetrics</a> (the book I wrote with Michael Kanell, with graphs and illustrations by Nigel Holmes) which hopefully will give you an idea of how Reagan did as President.  </p>
<p>Figure 1 below shows growth rates in real GDP per capita for every administration beginning in 1929, the first year for which the BEA provides data:</p>

<p>(Note &#8211; FDR I was through 1940, FDR II was most of the War years.  We broke up the sample that way because there are a lot of people who either out of ignorance or some odd desire to spread BS insist that under FDR, the Great Depression got worse or that growth only picked up with the start of WW2.  Either way, I&#8217;ve found it is safe to use a person&#8217;s pronouncements about FDR as a signal about the accuracy of other things they choose to share.  Also note &#8211; the remaining graphs in this post focus on the period from 1952 &#8211; 2008, as that was the main focus of the book from whence they come.)  <br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>As the graph shows, when it comes to real economic growth, Reagan did better than other Republicans.  But growth under Reagan was also slower than it was under most of the Democrats since 1929.  While the growth rate under Reagan is far less impressive when that last detail is mentioned, it is less impressive still if you remember the definition of GDP:</p>
<p>GDP = Private Consumption + Private Investment + Gov&#8217;t Consumption &#038; Investment + Net Exports.</p>
<p>Put another way  &#8211; if the government borrows a lot and spends what it borrows, it will boost GDP, and that in turn causes real GDP per capita growth to increase.  And that is precisely what happened under Reagan:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Fig2.png"><img src="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Fig2-300x162.png" alt="" title="Fig2" width="300" height="162"></a>Figure 2</p>
<p>As we note on page 50 of Presimetrics, early in his term Reagan noted:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our national debt is approaching $1 trillion. A few weeks ago I called such a figure, a trillion dollars, incomprehensible, and I’ve been trying ever since to think of a way to illustrate how big a trillion really is. And the best I could come up with is that if you had a stack of thousand-dollar bills in your hand only four inches high, you’d be a millionaire. A trillion dollars would be a stack of thousand-dollar bills sixty-seven miles high. The interest on the public debt this year we know will be over $90 billion, and unless we change the proposed spending for the fiscal year beginning October 1st, we’ll add another almost $80 billion to the debt.</p></blockquote>
<p>We also noted this:</p>
<blockquote><p>By the time he left office, the national debt, which had been “approaching $1 trillion” had more than doubled to $2.7 trillion, and the stack of thousand-dollar bills that had been 67 miles high was now 193 miles high and rising fast. Interest payments on the debt—“over $90 billion” in 1981—were just shy of $200 billion in Reagan’s last year in office.</p>
<p>Using more relevant measures, real debt per capita (in 2008 dollars) grew from about $10,620 in 1980 to $19,860 in 1988, and from 32 percent of GDP to 51 percent of GDP over the same period. However you slice it, Reagan’s profligacy bore no resemblance to his promises.</p></blockquote>
<p>All that increased debt creates an obligation to taxpayers, who will, after all, have to repay that debt eventually.  One measure we used in the book looks at the impact of that debt obligation &#8211; that is, the real net disposable income (i.e., income after current taxes less the increase in the debt per capita):</p>
<p><a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Fig3.png"><img src="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Fig3-300x203.png" alt="" title="Fig3" width="300" height="203"></a>Figure 3</p>
<p>When you take into account future obligations to pay back debt, Reagan no even longer looks as good as Jimmy Carter.  A rising tide, fueled by debt, wasn&#8217;t so great at lifting at most people&#8217;s boats&#8230; unless compared to the tide generated during other Republican presidencies.</p>
<p>But concluding that Reagan was someone to emulate means more than just ignoring the fact that he underperformed most Democrats on economic issues.  It also requires means ignoring the fact that Reagan also didn&#8217;t particularly care about Republican ideals either, not even the ones he parroted frequently and loudly.  For instance, a big source of state and local funding is the federal government.  Presidents who truly want to move power away from Washington generally try to increase the transfers from the Federal government to state and local governments.  But that is most definitely not what Reagan did:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Fig4.png"><img src="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Fig4-300x215.png" alt="" title="Fig4" width="300" height="215"></a>Figure 4</p>
<p>So what did Reagan excel at, other than outperforming other Republicans on economic issues?  Well, it turns out that he was very, very good for the public mood:<br /><a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Fig5.png"><img src="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Fig5-300x185.png" alt="" title="Fig5" width="300" height="185"></a></p>
<p>Put another way, some Presidents are better with reality, some are better with perception.  Reagan was better at the latter.</p>
<p>And if I may, a quote from the book (page 178) about another way Reagan&#8217;s administration stood out:</p>
<blockquote><p>And it’s not just the quantity of crime in Washington that is noteworthy. Some of the plots these folks engage in are—let’s call it like it is—cartoonish. Consider, for instance, the Iran-Contra affair, a convoluted scheme by which American weapons were sold to Iran in exchange for Iran’s exerting influence on Hezbollah, Iran’s terrorist buddies in Lebanon, to release American hostages. (Hezbollah, not incidentally, is thought to be the group responsible for the 1983 U.S. barracks bombings in Lebanon, in which 220 U.S. Marines and 79 international peacekeepers were killed.) To bring the complication of the scheme to the level worthy of a comic-strip villain, much of the loot resulting from the sale of American weaponry to an extremely hostile country would go toward funding the Contras, a rebel group in Nicaragua, thus providing the Contras with a much-needed source of funding that did not involve drug trafficking. A number of administration officials were convicted for their role in the affair. This included the secretary of defense (that would be our friend Weinberger, previously featured in Nixon’s White House), as well as two successive national security advisors (Robert McFarlane and John Poindexter).</p></blockquote>
<p>The folks who believe, who truly believe, won&#8217;t let facts stand in the way of their faith. And the cult of Reagan will continue to live on.  Anyone who says Sarah Palin is no Ronald Reagan don&#8217;t have the facts on Ronald Reagan.  </p>
<p>At this point, I&#8217;d normally give you my sources.  Since everything here comes from <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/">Presimetrics</a>, you&#8217;ll find the source for all the data and all the quotes there.</p>

                                <p>Mark Thoma is a truly stand-up guy. We need more like him screaming for the unemployed and underemployed. I&#8217;ll comment just a bit more after Mark&#8217;s commentary.</p>
<p>Mark Thoma on <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2011/02/the-slow-recovery-of-unemployment.html/">The Slow Recovery of Unemployment</a>:<br />
<blockquote>I don&#8217;t like to make economic forecasts. Though I do it on occasion, I generally leave that to <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/timduy/">Tim Duy</a> &#8212; he&#8217;s much more of a data grubber than I am so he&#8217;s better at it anyway. I do try to comment on what data says when it&#8217;s released, mostly at <a href="http://moneywatch.bnet.com/economic-news/blog/maximum-utility/">MoneyWatch</a>, but I don&#8217;t generally consider those to be formal forecasts of where the economy is headed.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a good reason why I try to avoid forecasts. In the past, whenever I&#8217;ve tried to predict the path the economy would take, I&#8217;ve found myself reading subsequent data releases in a way that supports the forecast. I think that once you make a forecast, it affects your objectivity, and I think that applies generally, not just to me.</p>
<p>Perhaps that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m feeling more and more alone in talking about the current state of the economy. Though the worries began long before this, in June of 2008 I did a MarketPlace segment where I predicted that the recovery of unemployment would lag output, and I said that policy should begin addressing the problem immediately due to the long lags between the time when policy begins is first considered and the time it actually has an impact on the economy. Ever since, I&#8217;ve found myself watching to see if that forecast was correct (which is another reason why I don&#8217;t like to make forecasts &#8212; you hope you are correct, but being correct in this case means people will struggle to find jobs, so it brings on an internal contradiction &#8212; how can you hope people will struggle?).</p>
<p>As I said above, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m alone in reading data in a way that supports previous forecasts, and others are much more bullish about the latest data releases than I have been. Part of my point has been that the data can be read another way. When people say, for example, that there&#8217;s nothing in the latest employment report to change the relatively optimistic forecasts they&#8217;ve made recently, I try to say that there&#8217;s nothing in the data to reject the alternative forecast either, i.e. that we are still headed for a very slow recovery of employment. Whatever your null hypothesis or prior beliefs were, the latest data did little to change that outlook.</p>
<p>My reason for noting that the data can be read another way goes beyond trying to show that I was right and others were wrong about how long it would take for employment to recover. I am very worried that we are, for all intents and purposes, about to abandon the millions who are still unemployed. Once we conclude that a robust recovery is underway, we will turn our attention to other things. All of the social services that we need to provide for the unemployed, simple and important things like making it possible for their kids to get dental care to name just one example, will be ignored. We devote little if any effort to job creation. We will simply turn our backs and move on.</p>
<p>I fully understand the desire to have a perfect landing, to get policy just right. But just right when the costs of unemployment are so much higher than the costs of inflation means that we should bias policy toward the unemployment problem. If we are going to make a mistake, it should be too much unemployment, and the inflation that comes with it, rather than too little. However, with the inflation hawks writing almost daily in the WSJ and elsewhere that we need to raise interest rates immediately to avoid inflation, and with all of the pressure to address the budget deficit, if anything the bias in policy seems to be in the other direction. Thus, while I acknowledge the fact that I am probably reading the data in a way that is favorable to previous statements, there was a good reason to worry back in 2008 that this would be a problem, and I believe there&#8217;s still good reason for worrying about it today. If I have read the data more pessimistically than others, the reason for it is simple &#8212; to push against the chance that we will forget about all the households that continue to struggle. If Ben Bernanke&#8217;s right, even with current policy we are looking at years until employment gets back to normal and we must do all that we can to help people find jobs or, failing that, provide the social services they need to get by until the employment picture improves.</p>
<p>Until I am sure that the economy is on firmer footing than it&#8217;s on now, and that employment prospects have improved substantially, I will continue to be the one who pushes back against optimistic reading of the data. And I will make no apologies for it beyond what I&#8217;ve said here.</p></blockquote>
<p>(More comments after the jump)<a name="more"></a><br />RW: Just today I was reading an Economist article from last week&#8217;s publication, <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/18010603">Et in Arcadia ego</a> (even in Arcadia I exist), about the homeless population that is building in the hardest hit parts of the economy (generally related to the manufacturing and housing decline). Tent cities, surging homeless rate, and poverty are becoming more of the &#8216;norm&#8217;; it&#8217;s really rather heart wrenching if you think about it.</p>
<p>And then I see a chart <a href="http://streetlightblog.blogspot.com/2011/02/inflation-expectations-and-asset-prices.html">like this</a> (h/t Ken Houghton at AB) on inflation expectations and asset prices. Yes, propping up asset prices &#8211; that&#8217;s what the Fed&#8217;s done here is inflate asset prices &#8211; will have the intended effect of dropping the saving rate and increasing current consumption; but to what end? Wall Street&#8217;s doing just fine, in fact. I&#8217;m a macroeconomic analyst and portfolio manager in the global fixed income space and have seen a nice shuffling around in the labor force. I wouldn&#8217;t say that jobs are plentiful, but popping up, nevertheless.</p>
<p>On forecasting, I find it very interesting that when Wall Street economists model their outlook for the unemployment rate &#8211; according to Bloomberg, the consensus expects the unemployment rate to drop to 8.5% in 2012 &#8211; they assume that the 2.8 million workers that are marginally attached to the labor force (of which discouraged workers is a subset) will not re-enter. Mathematically, that drops the unemployment rate: compared to a year ago, January 2010, the number of marginally attached workers has increased from 1.07% of the working-aged noninstitutional population to 1.17%, while the U3 unemployment rate dropped 9.7% to 9.0%. (the alternative measures of unemployment are listed in <a href="http://bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf">Table A-15 here.</a>)</p>
<p>I think that run75441 says it well (in the comment section of <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/02/household-survey-likely-paints-better.html">this post</a>):<br />
<blockquote>If NILF [not in the labor force] keeps going up, it does not matter what U3 does which is a joke. Parity for U3 is reached when Participation Rate equals the Participation Rate of 2001. The numeric is to nervous and today&#8217;s measurement of U3 has no meaning.</p></blockquote>
<p>Mark, thank you for your voice. It takes a lot of courage to push back against those that see just the tip of the economic iceberg, i.e. the parts of the economy that are trucking along just fine right now.</p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2011/02/tax-patents.html"><strong>Tax Patents</strong></a><br />crossposted with Ataxingmatter</p>
<p>The Senate Judiciary Committee did a markup of its patent reform legislation (S.23) today (Feb. 3, 2011) and &#8211;in a unanimous vote&#8211; sent it to the floor of the Senate with the broad ban on the patenting of tax strategies intact. </p>
<p>The accounting group AICPA has been leading the tax practitioner charge against patentable tax strategies, as the ABA tax section is hampered by the overall ABA&#8217;s decision to let the patent bar handle any comments on the matter.  The patent bar tends to object to subject matter exclusions to patentability, claiming that broad patentability best serves innovation. <br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Significant patent reform has been on the table for several years, but has been the subject of intense negotations, since it is the first major amendment to patent law in 60 years.  Some practitioners have urged Congress to pass a stand-along tax strategy patent ban, but that has been politically difficult, possibly because of the patent bar&#8217;s interest in the matter and those in the technology industry who fear that bans on tax strategy patents will affect tax software (such as tax preparation software).  While there are arguments that software, like tax strategy patents, simply shouldn&#8217;t be patentable, those in Congress in support of tax strategy patent bans generally have indicated that tax preparation software is not intended to be covered.  Sen. Grassley, for example, supports a ban on tax strategy patents but is cognizant of the technology industry&#8217;s concerns.  He stated  that he believes the ban can be written so as to protect tax preparation software and similar applications.</p>
<p>The following is excerpted from his Feb. 3, 2011 statement for the record on the tax strategy patent issue (available in BNA Daily Tax Report, Feb. 4, 2011).</p>
<p>I want to particularly thank the Chairman for working with me on a provision that would curtail patents on tax strategies that Senator Baucus and I strongly believe needed to be part of this patent reform package. During the 10 years that Senator Baucus and I alternated as Chair and Ranking Member of the Finance Committee, we worked on many proposals to protect taxpayer rights. The tax patent provision in this bill is one such provision. The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants started expressing concern about tax strategy patents after the then-Chairman and CEO of Aetna was sued for patent infringement for using a widely-known tax planning strategy. He eventually settled, but most taxpayers don&#8217;t have the resources to fend off such challenges. I ask consent that a 2007 article describing the AICPA&#8217;s concerns and the lawsuit be inserted in the record.<br />In July 2006, the House Ways &#038; Means Committee held a hearing on the use of tax strategy patents in facilitating abusive tax avoidance transactions. The Joint Committee on Taxation prepared a document for this hearing that outlines in detail the issues that tax strategy patents present. That document, JCX-31-06, is available on the Joint Committee&#8217;s website. The bottom line is that tax strategy patents may lead to the marketing of aggressive tax shelters or otherwise mislead taxpayers about expected results. Tax strategy patents encumber the ability of taxpayers and their advisors to use the tax law freely, interfering with the voluntary tax compliance system. If firms or individuals were able to hold patents for these strategies, some taxpayers could face fees simply for complying with the tax code. And, tax patents provide windfalls to lawyers and patent holders by granting them exclusive rights to use tax loopholes, which could provide some businesses with an unfair advantage.<br />Tax strategy patents are unlikely to be novel given the public nature of the tax code and related guidance. Moreover, tax strategy patents may undermine the fairness of the Federal tax system by removing from the public domain particular ways of satisfying a taxpayer&#8217;s legal obligations. The provision in the bill before us today expressly provides that a strategy for reducing, avoiding or deferring tax liability cannot be considered a new or non-obvious idea, and therefore, a patent on a tax strategy cannot be obtained. This ensures that all taxpayers will have equal access to strategies to comply with the tax code. In addition to Chairman Baucus, Senators Levin, Bingaman, Wyden, Conrad, Enzi, Kerry, Stabenow and Whitehouse support this provision.<br />I want to express my appreciation to Senators Leahy, Hatch, Sessions and Kyl for working with me in the Judiciary Committee to include this provision in the comprehensive patent reform bill we are debating today. It&#8217;s important that this provision remain in the bill since the number of tax strategy patents issued and pending are growing rapidly. As of the publication date of the 2007 article I inserted in the record, there were 60 patents issued and 86 pending applications just under PTO&#8217;s 36T classification. Just three years later, there are 137 issued and 157 pending. These are just the ones PTOs classified as tax strategy patents, but PTO&#8217;s classification isn&#8217;t perfect so there could be other tax strategy patents under other classifications.<br />On the issue of software, I&#8217;d like to make crystal clear that those of us working to limit the patenting of tax strategies do not intend for this to apply to tax preparation and other software, tools or systems used to prepare tax or information returns or manage taxpayer&#8217;s finances. I&#8217;m aware that various technology industry groups have written in opposition to this provision because of their concerns over how this impacts their ability to patent software. However, we&#8217;ve also heard from the public accountants and other consumer advocate groups, including the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, supporting this provision. I ask unanimous consent that their letter be inserted into the record.<br />I believe that we can protect taxpayer rights while also protecting the intellectual property rights of software companies. I encourage the technology groups to work with us to ensure we achieve that result and look forward to working with them to do so.</p>

                                <p>Readers have noticed and commented on the abrupt change in the commenting format last week.  Angry Bear&#8217;s discounted subscription to echo pro expired and became echo live, which is geared to a social networking format (links to twitter and facebook and other perks).</p>
<p>Echo pro costs $100/month minimum for companies with 1 M pageviews a month.</p>
<p>I contacted the CEO of JS-Kit, Kris Loux, and asked for help since Angry Bear is mostly out of pocket for us all.  The ads bring in money to cover expenses now but that is a big hit.</p>
<p>Mr. Loux has graciously waived the fee for echo pro for Angry Bear, so I want to publicly thank him for his kindness, and making our job that much easier.  Echo pro allows greater control of the format of comments.</p>
<p>We are also eligible for a &#8216;free&#8217; upgrade to the new e2 format scheduled to come online later this year.  (I am not familiar with the details of this format yet).  </p>

                                <p>I&#8217;ll forward you to <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/">Spencer&#8217;s post on the January Employment </a>report. As always, he sifts through this massive report and eloquently describes the state of the labor market. But I thought that I&#8217;d add a bit on the disparity between the household survey and the establishment survey.</p>
<p>The annual population revisions and weather distortions <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2011/02/unemployment-rate-dips-to-9-new-jobs-number-unclear/70768/#">have confused some</a>. The issue at hand is, that the BLS&#8217; two surveys, CPS (<a href="http://www.bls.gov/cps/#faq">Current Population Survey</a>, from which the unemployment rate is derived and called the household survey) and CES (<a href="http://www.bls.gov/ces/home.htm">Current Employment Statistics</a>, from which the nonfarm payroll is estimated and called the establishment survey), offer conflicting views on the strength of the <a href="http://bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm">headline report </a>(i.e., just the statistics about the unemployment rate and the nonfarm payroll): the unemployment rate dropped 0.4% to 9.0%, while the nonfarm payroll increased a meager 36,000 when 146,00 was expected (by Bloomberg consensus).</p>
<p>The report is not conflicting, in my view &#8211; it&#8217;s just weather related stuff that impacts the CES, and to a much lesser extent the CPS. The drop in the unemployment rate, although usually the statistically less popular data point, is probably the best descriptor of the monthly shift in the labor market: strong. (A 9% unemployment rate cannot be described as strong by any measure out there; I digress.)</p>
<p><em>All of this information is stated in the BLS release, which you can </em><a href="http://bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm"><em>find here</em></a><em>. Below I describe (1) the revisions to the CPS and (2) the weather-related distortions that discount the establishment number.</p>
<p></em><strong>Why the drop in the unemployment rate is credible</strong>. The summary statistics show the labor force falling by 504,000. The annual revisions dropped the labor force by 504,000, so the unrevised numbers show the labor force unchanged over the month.</p>
<p>The summary statistics show the number of employed increasing by 117,000 The annual revisions dropped the employed by 472,000, so the unrevised number of employed increased by 589k in the release. This is a big gain.</p>
<p>In fact, the revisions do not materially alter the 2010 unemployment rate nor its trend in any way. By my calculations &#8211; please correct me if I&#8217;m wrong &#8211; the unemployment rate would have been 9% with or without the CPS survey revisions.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/TUyEJjgTMGI/AAAAAAAADc8/qDjmeqJ4t7U/s1600/urate_chart.JPG"><img alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/TUyEJjgTMGI/AAAAAAAADc8/qDjmeqJ4t7U/s320/urate_chart.JPG" border="0"></a> For many reasons, the change in those &#8217;employed&#8217; in the household survey (+589k) does not match up to the change in the nonfarm payroll in the establishment survey (+36k); but the direction of the changes across both surveys are often similar. However, +589k is sizeable by any historical standard.<a name="more"></a></p>
<p><strong>So why +36k in the establishment survey versus the +589k in the household survey? Weather.</strong> <a href="http://www.nomura.com/">Nomura</a> economists David Resler, Zach Pandl, and Aichi Amemiya did some research on weather-related months(no link available since this is proprietary paid research and bolded by me):<br />
<blockquote><em>In one of the largest first reported declines on record, the BLS in its February 7, 1996 report calculated that non-farm payrolls FELL by 201,000 from the previous month. The outsized decline hit both manufacturing (-72,000) and services (141,000) but the construction industry registered a net job gain of 13,000. At the time, <strong>the BLS blamed the big winter storm for skewing the job loss and a month later reported that payrolls surged by 705,000 in February</strong> after a revised drop of 188,000 in January. Since then, subsequent benchmark and seasonal factor revisions have resulted in a history showing a drop of 19,000 in January 1996 followed by a 434,000 increase in February.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>and&#8230;<br />
<blockquote><em>These observations suggest January’s severe winter storm could skew the measurement and estimation of payrolls this year as well. From those prior episodes, we calculate that the winter storms led to a .0007 to .0015 deviation from “normal” seasonal job change in those months. A similar deviation of employment from normal seasonal patterns <strong>implies that the change in non-farm payrolls would be likely to fall in a range of -50,000 to +56,000.</strong></em><strong><br /></strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Ex post, they were right &#8211; they published this research before the January employment report was released &#8211; not only about the expected weather distortions, but also regarding the level (-50k to +56k). Accordingly, it&#8217;s very likely that next month we&#8217;ll see <em>outsized</em> gains, given the history of this type of distortion.</p>
<p>Therefore, until I see a weak February number (one month from now), I&#8217;m going to assume that the headline figures were strong and consistent with the unemployment rate dropping 0.4% to 9.0%.</p>
<p>Of course, there&#8217;s a slew of workers that are not in the labor force that may re-enter, which would undoubtedly drive the unemployment rate up (it probably will). And let&#8217;s remember this when talking about a &#8220;strong&#8221; employment report: 9% doesn&#8217;t represent the severity of the unemployment problem &#8211; <a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/EMRATIO?cid=12">the employment to population ratio does</a>.</p>

                                <p>Signs of stronger growth are showing almost everwhere but the employment data.  In January payroll employment grew by 36,000 while private payroll job only expanded some 50,000.  Employment as reported by the household survey grew 117,000.<a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/TUwOFFbmxuI/AAAAAAAABfw/ArUZeyB2ob8/s1600/Clipboard01-a.bmp"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/TUwOFFbmxuI/AAAAAAAABfw/ArUZeyB2ob8/s320/Clipboard01-a.bmp" alt="" border="0"></a></p>
<p>This is the third consecutive jobless recovery and the payroll gains have been very weak in all three.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/TUwNX28X5hI/AAAAAAAABfY/V3_lk9LRcwA/s1600/Clipboard01-c.bmp"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/TUwNX28X5hI/AAAAAAAABfY/V3_lk9LRcwA/s320/Clipboard01-c.bmp" alt="" border="0"></a></p>
<p>The unemployment rate fell to 9.0%, but that was largely due to a 504.000 contraction in the labor force.  I suspect the bad weather is distorting the data and it is hard to place much faith in any of this months data.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/TUwOFFbmxuI/AAAAAAAABfw/ArUZeyB2ob8/s1600/Clipboard01-a.bmp"> </a><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/TUwQTLC8xeI/AAAAAAAABf4/MKJcqZzXMKs/s1600/Clipboard01%2Baa.bmp"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/TUwQTLC8xeI/AAAAAAAABf4/MKJcqZzXMKs/s320/Clipboard01%2Baa.bmp" alt="" border="0"></a><br />The work week contracted and as a consequence the index of aggregate hours worked ticked down.  The severe winter weather weather almost certainly impacted the average work week data as many institutions worked fewer hours because of the snow.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/TUwNj1_VnyI/AAAAAAAABfg/9b93OeS-ovA/s1600/Clipboard01-d.bmp"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/TUwNj1_VnyI/AAAAAAAABfg/9b93OeS-ovA/s320/Clipboard01-d.bmp" alt="" border="0"></a>For the second month, however average hourly earnings growth improved as the year over year gain in hourly earnings is now 1.9% versus the low of 1.7%.  But with the drop in the work week average weekly earnings weakened.</p>
