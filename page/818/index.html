                                <p>Via <a href="http://matthewyglesias.theatlantic.com/archives/2007/07/tim_donaghy.php">Matthew Yglesias</a>, I arrived at <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=2943095">this story about the NBA referee</a> who was gambling on games, even games he officiated. </p>
<p>Apparently the FBI is involved, but:</p>
<blockquote><p>Nevada gambling regulators were not involved in an investigation and had no information about the allegations, said Jerry Markling, enforcement chief for the state Gaming Commission and Gaming Control Board. </p></blockquote>
<p>Now, I&#8217;m not saying that what this guy allegedly did was OK. I can see why the NBA would be unhappy, and a lot of the bookies and folks who wager on sports. But why is it a government matter? I assume if someone finds a way to cheat a blackjack and shows up at a casino, the casino (upon detecting the cheating, or for no reason at all for that matter) can have that person chucked out. But I don&#8217;t think its illegal to cheat at blackjack or other casino games. (Am I wrong about this?) </p>
<p>Clearly I&#8217;m missing something here. It may be because I don&#8217;t wager on sports and therefore am woefully underinformed about some key detail. Apologies for my ignorance, but would someone set me straight on this?</p>

                                <p>Little things have been consequences. There are some things the government simply does better than the private sector, and if the government decides not to do it, we all suffer. </p>
<p>An example coming down the pike is the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6909887.stm">failure to replace the QuickSCAT satellite</a>&#8230; which will hurt our ability to predict storms (read: hurricanes) coming. I note&#8230; QuickSCAT itself is one heck of a success story. It was a rush job, sent up quickly to replace another satellite (NSCAT) that failed, and it was only designed to last 2 to 3 years after its launch in 1999. </p>

<blockquote><p>There was cleavage on display Wednesday afternoon on C-SPAN2. It belonged to Sen. Hillary Clinton.  She was talking on the Senate floor about the burdensome cost of higher education. She was wearing a rose-colored blazer over a black top. The neckline sat low on her chest and had a subtle V-shape. The cleavage registered after only a quick glance. No scrunch-faced scrutiny was necessary. There wasn&#8217;t an unseemly amount of cleavage showing, but there it was. Undeniable.</p></blockquote>
<p>Oliver thinks this is really stupid.  I agree.  But if you want cleavage – try <a href="http://politicalhumor.about.com/library/images/blpic-marycarey.htm">Mary Carey</a> who says she has joined the Republican Party.  No, I’m not endorsing a porn star for President but she couldn’t be worse than Rudy McRomney. </p>
<p>What is the next story from Robin Givhan?  What Fred Thompson has that makes his ex girl friends still fond of him?  Pathetic!</p>

                                <p><a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/015667.php">Steve Benen</a> goes back a few weeks to a story written by <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-rudy28jun28,0,5447923,full.story?coll=la-headlines-nation">Maria L. La Ganga</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The world according to Rudolph W. Giuliani is a very, very scary place.  Just listen to the former mayor of New York City in a hotel ballroom in the scorching Midwest, two minutes and 14 seconds into a speech on &#8220;Restoring Fiscal Discipline and Cutting Wasteful Washington Spending.&#8221; &#8220;I will continue to keep America on offense in the terrorist war against us, because I think that&#8217;s the overriding issue of our day,&#8221; he declared. Then he leaped into a detailed discussion that wound its way through earmarks and out-of-control federal budgets to the threat of Democratic tax increases and &#8211; as always &#8211; back to terrorism. While talking taxes, Giuliani spoke of listening to a Democratic presidential debate. &#8220;They never mentioned the word &#8216;Islamic terrorist&#8217; during the debate…. Maybe they think they&#8217;re going to be insulting somebody if they say it. I&#8217;m trying to figure out who would be insulted &#8211; other than Islamic terrorists.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I wonder if the citizens of Iowa thought they were listening to the ramblings of Sean Hannity.  We already know that Giuliani has decided to repeat the free lunch supply-side lies to justify cuts.  He’s also sounding a lot like Mitt Romney on wanting more defense spending.  Neither one of these candidates have told us where they’d cut Federal spending.  In fact Steve notes that Giuliani supports more Federal spending for <a href="http://www.iowaindependent.com/showDiary.do?diaryId=608">HIV treatments</a> and added:</p>
<blockquote><p>My general experience has been that the federal government works best when it helps and assists and encourages and sets guidelines… on a state-by-state, locality-by-locality basis. It&#8217;s no different from the way I look at homeland security.  Maybe having been mayor of the city, I know that your first defense against terrorist attack is that local police station, or that local firehouse.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you are going “huh”, so is Steve who adds:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m generally not in the habit of offering advice to Republican presidential hopefuls, but I have an idea for the Giuliani campaign. As a way to save time at future appearances, perhaps one of his aides could give Giuliani a placard with the word &#8220;terrorism&#8221; on one side, and &#8220;9/11&#8221; on the other. That way, whenever anyone asks him a question about anything, he can simply point to the sign, instead of having to go to the trouble of coming up with an excuse to end up at the same point anyway.</p></blockquote>
<p>Giuliani is not exactly on solid ground talking about fiscal responsibility.  Nor is he some expert on national security.  But hey – he is running for the Republican nomination where honesty is not exactly a prerequisite.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: AB reader Sammy finds a piece by <a href="http://www.nypost.com/seven/06232007/postopinion/opedcolumnists/reaganite_rudy_opedcolumnists_deroy_murdock.htm?page=1">Deroy Murdock</a> of the National Review (this time writing for the NY Post) entitled Reaganite Rudy: Real Fiscal Discipline.  Even though Mr. Murdock’s mendacity has been well established and even though St. Ronald didn’t exactly slash Federal spending either, let’s take a look:</p>
<blockquote><p>* Require that federal agency chiefs propose 5-20 percent spending cuts annually. This would make them streamline their operations and improve services for less money. <br />* Slash federal civilian employment by 21 percent. By 2017, 42 percent of federal workers will retire. Giuliani would replace only half those vacancies. These 150,000 unfilled bureaucratic slots would save taxpayers $21 billion annually, while sparing Americans that many meddlers and nannies. <br />* &#8220;GAPStat,&#8221; a proposed Governmentwide Accountability Program, would evaluate federal activities and correct or eliminate failures. <br />* Place mandatory sunset clauses on all federal programs. Congress would have to rate and reauthorize federal initiatives, or let them expire. <br />* Require Congressional Budget Office price tags on legislation before voting begins on any bill. <br />* Make Washington follow the same Generally Accepted Accounting Principles that it demands of publicly traded companies.</p></blockquote>
<p>Isn’t amazing?  Not one specific proposal to cut down on the services provided by the Federal government and not one specific proposal to reduce transfer payments.  Just a request that agency chiefs “streamline their operations”.  I have suggested that Mitt Romney is a coward on these issues with his magic formula that has not an ounce of substance.  My apologies to Mr. Romney as Rudy is the truly gutless wonder.  Murdock calls these clever plans.  This is not a plan.  This is a joke. But it’s par for the course for the leaders of the modern Republican Party.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Something I&#8217;ve been wondering for a while is whether the real growth rates seen in the FDR administration would be <em>allowed</em> today. Its a strange question considering the number of people who are convinced that the economy simply didn&#8217;t grow in the FDR years until the war started &#8211; they seem to forget the crash and the bulk of the decline that followed occurring during the Hoover administration.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s real GDP per capita for 1929 &#8211; 1932 (Hoover&#8217;s term) and 1933 &#8211; 1940 (FDR&#8217;s first 8 years, before the war).</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RqILr0PDHXI/AAAAAAAAAdo/ut4bQcDPthQ/s1600-h/Hoover,+FDR+graph.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RqILr0PDHXI/AAAAAAAAAdo/ut4bQcDPthQ/s320/Hoover,+FDR+graph.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>(Incidentally, the data on real GDP per capita comes from the BEA&#8217;s <a href="http://bea.gov/national/nipaweb/Index.asp">NIPA Table 7.1, line 9</a>, so its as official as it could possibly get.) </p>
<p>In table form with annual percentage growth&#8230; here are the growth rates:</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RqINDEPDHYI/AAAAAAAAAdw/aUHAhGQm-44/s1600-h/Hoover,+FDR+Table.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RqINDEPDHYI/AAAAAAAAAdw/aUHAhGQm-44/s320/Hoover,+FDR+Table.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Notice the annualized growth rate&#8230; 5.37%.</p>
<p>This is almost 2 percentage points a year faster than the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/06/comparing-presidents-real-gdp-per.html">annualized growth rate</a> under JFK/LBJ, the administration under whom growth was fastest in the Post-WW2 years. It was more than twice as fast as under Clinton or Reagan, the second and third fastest growing administrations, and almost 4 times as fast as the annualized growth rate seen so far under GW.</p>
<p>So the question arises&#8230; would the Fed, today, allow that sort of growth rate without clamping down hard for fear of inflation? Does the fact that the economy had dropped 27.5% from 1929 to 1932 make the fast growth that followed, well, OK?</p>

<p><a href="http://money.cnn.com/2007/06/21/news/companies/bear_stearns/index.htm"> The Wall Street Journal</a> reported: </p>
<blockquote><p>The two funds suffered double-digit losses through April after making bad bets on securities backed by subprime loans, according to Reuters. The subprime market, which gives home loans to borrowers with weak credit, has been roiled by rising defaults.</p>
<p>Bear Stearns has also been negotiating with JPMorgan Chase, Merrill Lynch, Citigroup and other creditors in an attempt to restructure the hedge funds. Other big lenders include Goldman Sachs (Charts, Fortune 500) and Bank of America (Charts, Fortune 500)&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/bear-stearns-hedge-fund-liquidates/story.aspx?guid=%7B326ABF86-C1C5-4B4E-B544-B8DCDD0F65E4%7D">MARKET WATCH</a> indicates:</p>
<blockquote><p>Losses suffered by the Bear Stearns fund weren&#8217;t surprising because the investment bank has aggressively expanded in all parts of the mortgage market, he added.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bear has been among the most aggressive players in every aspect of this market &#8211; from origination to servicing mortgages and through to the trading of these securities,&#8221; he explained. </p>
<p>Bear Stearns didn&#8217;t invest much of its own capital in the fund and its exposure is relatively small, so the problems shouldn&#8217;t have any material impact on future results, Sam Molinaro, chief financial officer of Bear Stearns, said according to a transcript of a Thursday conference call.</p></blockquote>
<p>Not such a bad deal for Bear Stearns COS, having only two sequestered funds in trouble.  It is important to follow gainers and losers with any economic model, flawed or not.  Bear Stearns was always well protected.  Will keep you posted.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>There have been two impeachments of the President – both by radical Republican Congresses.  In both cases, the 1868 impeachment of Andrew Johnson and the 1998 impeachment of Bill Clinton – the Senate failed to sustain the allegations.  And for good reason – both instances represented brazen partisan politics.  </p>
<p>There have been two Presidents whose behavior was so outrageous that they should have been impeached.  One is the current President who will likely run out the clock.  Besides, some in the press including David Broder strike me as carrying the water for this Machiavellian disaster we somehow elected twice.  The other, of course, was Richard Nixon who had to resign in 1974 because of what we now call the Watergate scandal.  <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2007/07/the-highest-bro.html">Brad DeLong</a> reminds us of what David Broder wrote way back then.  An excerpt:</p>
<blockquote><p>If the House votes to impeach Mr. Nixon, there would be little need to revise the widespread predictions of significant Democratic gains in the November election. In truth, those predictions are premised on an unfavorable verdict against the President.  But suppose the House goes the other way? Suppose there are few Republican defections and that enough Democrats cross the line to exonerate Mr. Nixon of every charge leveled against him by the Judiciary Committee in its expected bill of impeachment? Legally, that would be the end of the matter. The cloud over Mr. Nixon&#8217;s future would disappear and he could go back to being a full-time President. Congress could go back to legislating. Messrs. Doar, Jenner, and St. Clair could return to their firms. But politically, the fireworks would just be starting, for anyone can see that a drama as great as Watergate itself would begin no more than 24 hours after the House refused to vote impeachment. The first reaction would probably be a wave of recriminations within the House itself &#8211; with the anti-impeachment majority lashing out against the Judiciary Committee members for spending $1.5 million and uncounted thousands of manhours to produde an indictment so weak that the House itself would not sustain it. But that reaction would be a passing ripple compared to the tidal wave of public sentiment that would sweep over the Congress if the House voted against impeachment. Mr. Nixon&#8217;s spokesmen have already made the accusation that the impeachment investigation ordered by the Democratic leadership last October is nothing but a partisan assault on the integrity of the presidential office. If the Judiciary Committee were repudiated by a majority of the 248 Democrats and 187 Republicans in the House &#8211; no matter in what proportions &#8211; the White House charge would surely have been proven to the public&#8217;s satisfaction. The President&#8217;s supporters in the country would cry vengeance against a Congress which spent the better part of two years not dealing with energy or inflation but harassing the President for no purpose. The President&#8217;s critics would no doubt take a vote against impeachment as a final proof of the craven cowardice of congressmen.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, Tricky Dick’s men tried to claim Watergate was just a political stunt.  But by July 10, 1974 – only those who were truly deaf, dumb, and blind had any doubt that Nixon was presiding over his own Machiavellian regime and was personally involved with the Watergate cover-up.  Was a young David Broder really this stupid?  Or was he another one of the Nixon water carriers?  Brad’s point is well taken:</p>
<blockquote><p>David Broder: He came to Washington. He trashed the place. And it wasn&#8217;t his place. It was never his place.</p></blockquote>
<p>Maybe – but the David Broders of the press seemed to have multiplied over the past 30 plus years.</p>

<blockquote><p>President Bush has promised to veto seven Democratic spending bills &#8211; including the Labor-HHS-Education bill &#8211; and sign five others, on the grounds that he wants to rein in spending. So, CBPP checked this out and found that the seven bills Bush is likely to veto will actually cost less, when you adjust for inflation and population growth, than they did in 2002-06, when Republicans ran Congress. And the five bills he&#8217;s planning on signing into law will actually cost more.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.cbpp.org/7-18-07bud.htm">CBPP </a> provides the details.  Check it out and compare to the BS that emanates from the White House.</p>

                                <p>Via <a href="http://www.blogger.com/post-create.g?blogID=5048766">Josh Marshall</a>, <a href="http://news.bostonherald.com/localPolitics/view.bg?articleid=1012402">this story</a> in the Boston Herald:</p>
<blockquote><p>In an apparent violation of the law, a controversial aide to ex-Gov. Mitt Romney created phony law enforcement badges that he and other staffers used on the campaign trail to strong-arm reporters, avoid paying tolls and trick security guards into giving them immediate access to campaign venues, sources told the Herald. </p>
<p>The bogus badges were part of the bizarre security tactics allegedly employed by Jay Garrity, the director of operations for Romney who is under investigation for impersonating a law enforcement officer in two states. Garrity is on a leave of absence from the campaign while the probe is ongoing.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“They (the aides) knew the badges were fake and probably illegal,” said a presidential campaign source who asked for anonymity because the story could damage the individual’s career. “But they went along with it because Jay (Garrity) pushed it on them.” </p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Two additional sources confirmed that the badges &#8211; described as bright silver plates with a state seal attached &#8211; were first created and used by Garrity while Romney was still governor. Under state law, it is illegal to use a badge without authority, an offense that carries a fine of not more than $50. </p>
<p>A spokeswoman for Garrity referred all questions to the Romney campaign. </p>
<p>The campaign source said the badges were used extensively by Garrity and staffers on Romney’s advance team, which is responsible for coordinating events for his presidential campaign. </p>
<p>Sometimes, the source said, a staffer would use a badge for crowd control to restrict access to Romney. Other times, they were flashed to gain quick access to emergency exits and back hallways at campaign venues. In at least one instance, a staffer used a badge to go through a Massachusetts Turnpike toll booth without paying, the source said.</p></blockquote>
<p>I want to leave aside snide remarks about the Romney campaign and the people he employs and focus on a different question&#8230; it isn&#8217;t all that rare for people with some degree of power to get caught engaging in acts that are, well, stupid. </p>
<p>Possible reasons I can see include some combination of:<br />1. Power corrupts<br />2. These people were corrupt to start with, and power gives them the opportunity to act on their corrupt impulses.<br />3. The fact that these people have power means their corruption is more likely to hit the public eye if they&#8217;re caught.<br />4. The fact that these people have power means their corruption is less likely to have consequences if they&#8217;re caught, so its a rational thing to be more corrupt.</p>
<p>Possibility 4 is particularly disturbing to me.</p>
<p>So, which is it? Are there other possibilities I&#8217;m missing?</p>

                                <p>Bruce Bartlett was kind enough to alert us to <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2007/07/the_optional_flat_tax_1.html">this post</a> from Senator Brownback:</p>
<blockquote><p>I propose an optional flat tax that would exist alongside the current code. This approach does not gore any of the tax code&#8217;s sacred cows and it could actually be enacted into law. An optional flat tax would generate economic growth and be vastly more transparent, simple and family &#8211; friendly than the current code &#8230; To account for the complicated credits and deductions in the current system, the optional flat tax would offer a generous personal income exclusion indexed for inflation. For individual tax filers, their first $20,000 of income would be excluded from taxation. For joint, married tax filers, their first $40,000 of income would be excluded. Looking at the work of many tax experts, I expect the optional flat tax rate would be in the range of 15 to 20 percent.  The flat tax would partially pay for itself by boosting GDP growth.</p></blockquote>
<p>Bruce wasn’t endorsing this crackpot idea but rather expressing his frustration with the dishonesty of those who push it.  It certainly would not be fiscally neutral as only those who would pay less in taxes would adopt it.  And this notion that a top marginal rate equal to 20 percent would not lead to a huge revenue drain is just stupid.  Brownback claims that this would be a move to tax simplification, which is beyond absurd as one would have to calculate one’s tax under both systems to figure out which one to adopt.  Let me just add the following – Brownback’s claim that a tax rate cut would lead to faster GDP growth is idiotic.  After all, giving people their money back so they can consume more translates into lower national savings. The post is the same old free lunch BS we are hearing from most of the GOP Presidential candidates.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://www.opinionjournal.com/editorial/feature.html?id=110006227">Stephen Moore</a> discussed this crackpot idea in early 2005:</p>
<blockquote><p>Former senators Connie Mack of Florida and John Breaux of Louisiana, the chairmen of President Bush&#8217;s new tax reform panel, have been granted a historic opportunity to dramatically overhaul our economically debilitating federal tax system. The surest way for the tax panel to crack through the political gridlock that has paralyzed this issue for decades would be to endorse the Freedom to Choose Flat Tax. This is an idea that I first introduced in The Wall Street Journal eight years ago &#8211; to an extraordinarily enthusiastic reception.</p></blockquote>
<p>Moore claims this additional layer of complexity (having to do your taxes two ways) would somehow lower compliance costs by over $110 billion per year.  If this unsupported claim were not bad enough, he writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>On top of that, economist Dale Jorgenson of Harvard estimated several years ago that if the U.S. tax code were replaced with some kind of flat and simple consumption tax, the economy would grow about 10% faster. This would mean that instead of the economy growing at 4% a year, it could grow at almost 4.5% a year, and in that case the nation could expand its way out of many of its thorniest problems, such as low wage-rate growth, stubbornly high poverty rates, the $413 billion budget deficit, and the decline in jobs in the manufacturing sector.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ten percent faster versus having a growth rate that was about 1.1 times the usual growth rate.  Nice bait and switch language.  But the economy does not grow at an average rate of 4% and the free lunch Brownback proposal is not going to increase long-term growth rates.  So let’s call this free lunch lies what they are – lies.  It would seem that Mr. Moore has been pushing this nutty idea for the last decade with Bruce Bartlett rightfully criticizing it the whole time.</p>
