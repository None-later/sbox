<p>Not unexpectedly, the &#8220;think tanks&#8221; that claim to be nonpartisan but that conduct research sponsored by corporate interests and support &#8220;capital market&#8221; solutions to economic problems are at it again pushing more tax breaks for the huge corporations that just gained more legislative clout with the Supreme Court&#8217;s foolish decision in Citizens United.   See, for instance, the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.milkeninstitute.org/publications/publications.taf?function=detail&#038;ID=38801227&#038;cat=resrep">Milken Institute&#8217;s, Jobs for America: Investments and policies for economic growth and competitiveness</a> (Jan. 2010) (sponsored by one of the biggest of the &#8220;bad guys&#8221; pushing corporate tax cuts all the time, the National Association of Manufacturers).  </p>
<p>The Milken report wants the government to do the following:</p>
<p>reduce the corporate tax rate  (The section 199 manufacturing credit&#8211;which amounts to a significant rate reduction for most US companies&#8211;has already been passed by Congress under the same argument that reducing taxes will result in job creation. but there not much in the way of new jobs to show for the tax reduction; this report claims that reducing the rate to 22% versus the current statutory rate of 35% would cause a .3 percentage point growth in GDP from 2011 to 2013, with an increase in employment of 2.13 million.   These sorts of claims are made for all kinds of tax cuts, but seldom pan out in practice.) <br /> increase the R&#038;D credit (we&#8217;ve already done that&#8211;the R&#038;D deduction was made a credit and it didn&#8217;t have a significant impact on job creation.  It&#8217;s a stretch to think it would, since the research is either going to be done anyway or just tweaking around the edges in ways that doesn&#8217;t require significant expansion of research facilities.  Most of the basic research done at universities is much more important to the core of job development and innovation expansion. <br /><a name="more"></a><br />Let companies export technology products to produce products abroad (that will help overseas job production, but will essentially increase the flow of jobs to low-labor-cost countries and do nothing to create jobs here) <br />invest in infrastructure projects (now, that one has real potential, butprobably NOT the projects recommended here, which include an expansion of offshore drilling and onshore exploration and coal usage&#8211;projects that do nothing to move us towards better use of energy and prevention of global warming).  </p>
<p>The Milken report, in other words, espouses many of the same policies applied by the Bush II administration.  They didn&#8217;t create jobs under Bush and there&#8217;s no reason to think they would be more successful now&#8211;in fact, we&#8217;ve tried tax cuts as job stimulus for years without success.  A recent Congressional Research Service (CRS) report notes that business tax incentives don&#8217;t do much to stimulate the economy.  See Hungerford &#038; Gravelle, Business Investment and Employment Tax Incentives to Stimulate the Economy (Jan. 22, 2010) (available on BNA).  The report notes that the February 09 economic stimulus package included $286 billion in tax cuts, many directed towards business, and that the administration has advocated futher business incentives.  However, it reports that &#8220;the evidence &#8230; suggests that a business tax subsidy may not necessarily be the best choice for fiscal stimulus.&#8221;   It considers, for example, the idea of tax credits&#8211;the two most common of which are investment tax credits and accelerated deductions for depreciation.  While studies suggest that such credits have some potential for increasing employment, they have not proven to be effective in practice.  Reasons for ineffectiveness include the complexity of credits, the uncertainty of credits prior to tax filing time, the lack of awareness about the credit til tax filing time, and the fact that &#8220;product demand appears to be the primary determinant of hiring.&#8221;  Firms may not invest even with investment tax credits, if they are already at excess capacity.  In fact, the report notes empirical evidence from recent studies that suggest that the induced spending is less than the cost of the tax subsidy.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s face it.  Businesses will always demand tax subsidies, because the managers and owners benefit when they pay less in taxes.  But tax subsidies may do little or nothing to stimulate the economy or provide jobs.  This CRS report suggests that tax subsidies don&#8217;t act as a stimulus for hiring, but rather as just another windfall for businesses.  The report notes that to the extent an investment subsidy isn&#8217;t used to stimulate investment it may well simply be used to pay down debt or pay out dividends to shareholders.</p>
<p>Programs that create jobs are the ones that directly create jobs&#8211;not the ones that just put more money in the hands of already wealthy CEOs and shareholders who will likely sock the money away in some investment overseas.  We need to be creating jobs programs like those in the New Deal era&#8211;real jobs that can make the country better by building infrastructure and make the lives of the people directly affected better.  And we need to be very selective about the infrastructure projects that we fund.  Providing additional subsidies to Big Oil and other extractive industries is a 19th century solution to a 21st century problem. </p>
<p>Will Congress be able to do anything other than the bidding of the big corporate interests and their managers and owners&#8211;especially after the right-wing Court in Citizens United overturned multiple precedents to find that corporations can spend whatever they want to buy elections, in the guise of claiming that such ill-founded judge activism furthers free speech rights?  Will Congress be able to show any concern for ordinary Americans?  It seems increasingly doubtful, unless Americans become better informed and able to vote in large blocks to disempower the corporatist agenda.  We must remove politicians that simply put in place the policies that the big multinationals want.  Those policies almost always will serve the managerial/owner class and not ordinary Americans.<br />__________________________________________<br />crossposted with <a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2010/01/job-creationtax-cuts-are-not-the-right-tool.html">ataxingmatter</a></p>

<p>President Obama delivered his first State of the Union speech tonight, assuring us that we could jump-start job creation through tax cuts for businesses and gain needed relief for families through tax cuts for middle-class households.  </p>
<p>What Obama offers is, as usual, a mixed bag&#8211;too much of the same old tax cuts favored by the right for decades , which have not been proven to do much to create new jobs, but some good programs that merit passage.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve got strong doubts that an accelerated depreciation provision amounting to a 10% tax cut for businesses and costing $38 billion can be considered an effective jobs bill, even when it is generously offered to small businesses.  Similarly, more preferences for capital gains (exempting them from taxes when the money is invested in small businesses) goes the wrong way&#8211;without much assurance of real job creation.  </p>
<p>The proposal for a tax credit for new workers is more promising&#8211;although I&#8217;d prefer to see stimulus and not tax cuts, this credit is at least directly related to new employment, unlike the other provisions that simply reduce the tax costs for existing businesses without any guarantee of new jobs.    </p>
<p>Adjusting the way the federal government supports loans for college students is a long-needed reform.  The current program represents a subsidy for banks that has grown through the years to provide fees to banks even though universities do most of the same administration work that they did under the direct loan programs.  Banks have finangled the subsidy (as they have credit card fees, the TARP-related guarantees) into more money for themselves and less for students.  It&#8217;s time to eliminate the giveaway and provide the money to students instead of to the banks.  Obama is pushing the right policy here.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />Ending tax breaks for Big Oil, ending the carried interest preferential taxation of compensation for investment fund managers, and not extending the lower rates for the super-rich are all good ideas.   Obama finally made the needed argument that the solutions offered from the right&#8211;to extend tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, deregulate, and maintain the status quo on health care&#8211;are just what we&#8217;ve been doing that led us to crisis and huge deficits.  We shouldn&#8217;t repeat the failed experiment.</p>
<p>Similarly, Obama made his proposal for taxing financial institutions to pay for the costs of the federal guarantee that has been necessary to move them out of crisis through use of the TARP funding.  That&#8217;s a reasonable plan, based on the degree of leverage other than ordinary deposits.<br />_________________________________<br />crossposted with <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/">ataxingmatter</a></p>

<p>If the FRB of NY really believed that their only option was payment in full and not telling anyone about it, then Tim Geithner&#8217;s leadership abilities make <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2010/01/bernanke-part-2-of-2-leaders-lead-or.html">Ben Bernanke</a> look like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Allied_Commander">Dwight Eisenhower</a>.</p>
<p>BarryO is, apparently, finally trying to make clear the distinctions between TARP, TLGF, TALF, CPLF, Maiden Lane, Maiden Lane II, Maiden Lane III, etc. and the actual Stimulus Package.  A good place to start: One was a huge giveaway that has led to overreported profits and high taxpayer expenses.  The other was passed by Congress.</p>

<p>Geekery below the fold.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />Steve Jobs was a little hyperbolic in his language yesterday which led some people to laugh. Well there are reasons he is a self-made billionaire and you are not.</p>
<p>The key to understanding why the iPad and similar devices can change the world it to understand that it is not a computer without a physical keyboard, or a multi-media player, or a portable display, sure all of those are built in but they don&#8217;t add up to what the iPad really is, which is a magic briefcase full of Gizmos.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s a Gizmo. Well the online dictionaries have boring definitions but for my purpose a Gizmo is something that does something for you. A Gizmo generally isn&#8217;t big and it mostly isn&#8217;t multifunctional, it just does what it does in a fun and efficient way. The iPad is designed to be a repository for Gizmos along with Games and Books and Music and allows you to use all of them anywhere you go. Now it sounds silly to put it this way but it doesn&#8217;t have to be, if you were a Building Inspector it might be nice to have one Gizmo to record your findings and another that allowed you to look up the International Building and Fire Codes on the fly, and maybe another to allow you to record your time on the job. And on a dirty, dusty or muddy job site it might be nice to have one in the same form factor as the clipboard you had been carrying rather than some clamshell lap top vulnerable to the environment.</p>
<p>A salesman needs a different set of Gizmos. Maybe a Travel Schedule and Ticket Booking Gizmo, maybe one that displays the companies entire product line with accompanying video and specs. And maybe some things to kill time while traveling, say maybe a Travel Chess Set or a book of Crosswords. But whatever you are and whatever you do it would be neat and at times necessary to always have with you your own collection of Gizmos.  Me, I am a simple guy on a typical day all I would need is my Bus Schedule Gizmo, and a Gizmo that would display a full web page while allowing me to touch type posts and comments. But in an immediate past job as a Real Estate/Land Development Researcher it would have been nice to have a Road Map Gizmo for my area, another that had copies of County and City Land Development Codes and another with access to Interactive Permit and Zoning Maps for the various jurisdictions we dealt with. Oh and an aerial photo viewer. Now I had all that capability in my office and sort of via my laptop in my car, but there was very little magical about it.</p>
<p>We could go on. A tourist in a foreign country has a whole new set of needed Gizmos. Currency calculators, Maps, Guidebooks, Brochures, Travel Clock, and a Translation Gizmo and probably no desire to whip out a laptop at the souvenir stand in some street in Montmartre. A college student in turn has all kinds of different Gizmo desires, say movie and club schedules, maybe a University Library Catalog Gizmo, or for an athlete the playbook and training and practice schedule.</p>
<p>And that is the beauty of the iPad, it is not based on a model of the tablet computer, instead it is modeled on the iTouch a handheld Gizmo that delivers dozens of other Gizmo products that the user selects from literally tens of thousands of offerings. If you like, and a lot of people do, you could simply have your iTouch loaded to capacity with games, or songs, or videos, plus maybe a Facebook Gizmo. Or you could load it up with every Reference and Trivia resource in the land and bore all your friends for ever. Or just load it up with books and use it as a pretty-good e-readers, or use it as a repository of maps or photos or any combination of that. Of course along with that you can use it as an acceptable web browser and in a pinch as an input device to any cloud computing applications you have going, but in the end what keeps the iTouch a Gizmo Toy and not a Gizmo Tool is the screen size. I mean you could easily load the entire Snohomish County Development Code on an iTouch but absent a very specialized Gizmo indeed looking something up for a client and then sharing it would be a nightmare.</p>
<p>An iPad is built from the ground up to be a full screen screaming Gizmo Machine. Instead of storing a sub-set of your professional books and tools in your briefcase you simply load them on top of a machine. It is said that the magic of the dancing bear is not how well it dances but that it dances at all. And you can say the same about the traditional lap top computer, they have taught it to dance quite a few steps. The iPad instead IS a dance machine.</p>
<p>Okay I have an iPad in my hand. What do I want it to do for me?</p>
<p>1. I want it to be a full page web browser. <br />2. I want it to be an acceptable blog posting tool. <br />3.  I want a full page version of the Transit Schedule for my area<br />4. I want it to play my music.<br />5. I want it to play my movies.<br />6. I want to be able to update and share my Facebook Wall with someone in the room.<br />7. I want a functional replacement for my Thomas Guide Map Book<br />8. I want a useable Guide Book to Western Birds<br />9. I want a useable Tide Table and opening and closing date/time for fishing runs and shellfish seasons.<br />10. I want a photo album of all my nieces and nephews<br />11. I want one click access to my Investment Portfolio&#8217;s current prices<br />12. I want one click access to Professional Books and Codes relevant to my job<br />13. I want a repair manual for my car.<br />14. I want a traveling chess board with interactive capability<br />15. I want the Oxford English Dictionary<br />16. I want the complete run of Astounding Magazine from 1935-1942</p>
<p>Actually I would be happy with items 1-3, I am kind of a simple guy, but this is a reasonable set of Gizmos for a simple guy, other people would layer on any number of items. But note one thing. With the exception of the web browser none of this is built around the standard Office Suite. And none of it around Graphic Design. Or Application Development. Or building websites. If I was looking to add some functionality to the above it would probably start with the iLife Suite (which would give me some web tools) and then some sort of Writing Program. And probably add some interactive Language modules to allow me to brush up on my neglected French, Latin and Welsh and maybe add back in Italian. But in any event the iPad is already optimized to deliver all of these Gizmos and more, you just need to possibly pay for some of the actual content</p>
<p>When you buy a laptop there is kind of a sense of &#8216;Well there it is&#8217;, it has whatever software package you ordered, and maybe you go online and order and install some more or try to find the disks so as to reload things. The iPad is not like that. Instead it asks you what you want to do with it and you start by visiting the App Store and browsing among the free and trial Apps. And there are literally tens of thousands of them. Then you simply start adding and rearranging Gizmos that do the kinds of things you want them to do.</p>
<p>At $499 and no need for a contract the price point is excellent or anyone who has reliable access to WiFI, which these days often means the Library or Starbucks and there are certainly enough free Apps and free document sources out there to justify getting one. Plus there are a good number of Gizmos built in to the unit. But I think the question will come to this. Pick up a piece of 8 x 11 paper, fold it down an inch at top and side and ask yourself this: &#8220;What are the top 25 things I would like a magic piece of paper to deliver to me anywhere any time?&#8221; and then follow up with: &#8220;How much of that potential functionality do I lose by trying to access that through the 3&#8243; screen on my phone?&#8221; and &#8220;How much functionality do I really lose if I left my laptop at home and relied on this on a typical day?&#8221;</p>
<p>Finally a little note about sociality. Laptops aren&#8217;t social. You are not going to whip one out at a party or at the bar or while hiking with friends, nor are they something you would generally just hand to a friend. They aren&#8217;t particularly cool even when you are out on your own, sitting on a bench in front of an exhibit at the art museum with an open lap top just screams dork. On the other hand the iPad with out without its case more or less looks like a small portfolio. If you turned it on and did a quick web search on the artist, it would look as natural as could be. As it would be navigating some narrow aisles looking for treasure in an old book store or antique store, who looks at a guy with something the size of a clipboard in his hand? When people I know are talking around me I like to do a quick look up on my iPhone pull up a picture and then show it, but it is a little awkward sometimes I am walking up to them and giving them a phone which since we are all over 50 means them dragging out a pair of glasses. With the iPad instead I can do the equivalent of laying out an 8 x 10 glossy photo by their elbow. &#8220;Look know that&#8217;s a (whatever they are trying to describe)&#8221;. I think this ability to share, to be able to on the spot pull something up and then physically hand the display to another person or to hold it up for sharing is going to open new horizons in personal computing.</p>
<p>This BTW may make this product the must-have for teenagers. It is right at the same price level of buying them a smartphone and a dedicated MP-3 player and I can see the girls passing their Facebook Walls back and forth as they walk down the hall or sit in the lunch room, its a natural. I don&#8217;t know how many High Schools provide Wi-Fi but it has to be a lot, this thing just flat out works in the teen, twenty-something social environment.</p>
<p>So the iPad is big. Not because it is in a category of its own, it was proceeded there by both the iTouch and the iPhone, but because it takes that category to a level of real world functionality that transforms a pretty cool toy into what can be developed by each individual into a lifestyle tool. It simply makes the handbook, the guidebook, the catalog, the manual, the route schedule potentially obsolete,  People who bitch about its maybe lack of markup tools ignore the fact that we interact with text and information in all kinds of ways in daily life plus we use all kinds of information Gizmos in the process. I guess we will see how his one goes.</p>

                                <p>by Rebecca Wilder</p>
<p>At least that is the way I read today’s monetary policy release. According to the <a href="http://www.boj.or.jp/en/type/release/adhoc10/k100126.pdf" target="_blank">statement released today</a>: “The Bank of Japan will encourage the uncollateralized overnight call rate to remain at around 0.1 percent.” However, the statement curiously omits the following from item 6. of the <a href="http://www.boj.or.jp/en/type/release/adhoc09/k091218.pdf" target="_blank">previous release</a>:<br /><em></em><br />
<blockquote><em>The Policy Board has concluded that it is appropriate to further disseminate the Bank&#8217;s thinking on price stability, by stating more clearly that the Policy Board does not tolerate a year-on-year rate of change in the CPI equal to or below 0 percent and that the midpoints of most Policy Board members&#8217; &#8220;understanding&#8221; are around 1 percent.<br /></em></p></blockquote>
<p>I don’t know why the Bank of Japan would rescind their commitment to 0 percent, when the median inflation projection is negative through 2011, although improved from its latest forecast in June 2009 (at the end of the <a href="http://www.boj.or.jp/en/type/release/adhoc10/k100126.pdf" target="_blank">January 2010</a> policy statement). That’s bad – rising real debt, further hits to consumer spending, the works. Admittedly, there’s debate over the actual benefit of quantitative easing and zero-interest rate policy (see <a href="http://www.frbsf.org/publications/economics/letter/2001/el2001-31.html" target="_blank">this paper at the FRSB</a>).</p>
<p>But another policy-relevant bit of news hit the wire today: S&#038;P put Japan’s credit rating on negative watch. From the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/27/business/global/27yen.html" target="_blank">NY Times</a>:<br /><em><br />
<blockquote>“The outlook change reflects our view that the Japanese government’s diminishing economic policy flexibility may lead to a downgrade unless measures can be taken to stem fiscal and deflationary pressures,” S.&#038;P. said. “The policies of the new Democratic Party of Japan government point to a slower pace of fiscal consolidation than we had previously expected.” Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama has some lofty spending plans in its budget, funded by an expected 44.3 tn yen bond issuance.</p></blockquote>
<p></em><em><u>Diminishing policy flexibility?</u> </em>Given the central bank’s propensity to move away from the ZIRP, and the government debt running stock at 183% of GDP (and rising), I’d say that diminishing policy flexibility is a euphemism.</p>
<p><a href="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/S187am8kRPI/AAAAAAAACzo/eaZJ2Jhoz2E/s1600-h/japan_leverage%5B4%5D.png"><img title="japan_leverage" border="0" alt="japan_leverage" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/S187bmP3KiI/AAAAAAAACzs/4qo01ZHzoUw/japan_leverage_thumb%5B2%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="504" height="346"></a>
<p>Notice how Japan&#8217;s government debt rose while the nonfinancial sector&#8217;s obligations fell &#8211; that&#8217;s the deleveraging story.</p>
<p>Japan is not “insolvent”, at least that is what the external debt metrics say. But the only real policy flexibility is held by the central bank. And the Bank of Japan, ostensibly at least, doesn’t seem to be providing adequate liquidity.</p>
<p>If left unchecked, this could happen to the U.S.: policy mistakes. Raising taxes and hiking rates too early can turn into persistent economic problems.</p>

                                <p>by Daniel J Becker (DOLB for the rest of you) </p>
<p>UPDATED BELOW.<br />Well, I thought being tonight is the big night for the President I would give my version of the SOU. This is an update on the flower shop. For any new readers, these are real numbers from an honest to goodness small business. </p>
<p>As you can see from the chart below, or maybe not, I don&#8217;t need a loan. I don&#8217;t need a tax break. I could use a real national health plan as the medical for this year again, including premiums hit $15K (16.5 and 17.7 prior 2 years). I have a high deductible plan that increased from $6471 in &#8217;06 to $7195 in 2009, 11% up. </p>
<p>No, even if you did the cash for clunkers again, I don&#8217;t have the extra cash flow to take a loan. Though the delivery van has 235K miles on it. It&#8217;s a 2002 Caravan. </p>
<p>All my loans are fixed, so I&#8217;m not worried about deficit fueled inflation as it relates to my monthly payments. My property, even with the 15% loss in the last 2 years based on tax evals is still 1.69 times more than my mortgages and I only have 15 or less years to go. </p>
<p>We&#8217;re working with less people at the shop and have layed off our manager/worker (he&#8217;s fast, a good designer and can carry the load when we&#8217;re not there) to 1/2 time. We&#8217;re watching every penny as to inventory, utilities, insurances (I&#8217;m getting money back on the WC because payroll is down). </p>
<div>What I&#8217;m worried about is this: </div>
<div>
<div><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_ea3-LcbrX8A/S2Dfipp4YJI/AAAAAAAAAP0/NFBSkU3Kyvk/s1600-h/Flower%20Shop%20Gross%20Revenues.JPG" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="197" mt="true" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_ea3-LcbrX8A/S2Dfipp4YJI/AAAAAAAAAP0/NFBSkU3Kyvk/s320/Flower%20Shop%20Gross%20Revenues.JPG" width="320"></a></div>
<div>Keep in mind, that we were considered a larger than normal shop. If we&#8217;re doing this bad, imagine how the wholesalers and everyone else down line are doing. That&#8217;s the real trickle down folks!</div>
</div>
<div></div>
<p>There is only one thing that will fix it: CUSTOMERS!
<div>It&#8217;s not that people are not trying to spend, it&#8217;s that they really have run out of money. Note that the credit card sales continued to rise for a year after the account and cash sales started to decline. </div>
<div></div>
<div><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_ea3-LcbrX8A/S2DfcNqLzvI/AAAAAAAAAPs/AScsID-X5KI/s1600-h/Flower%20Shop%20Cash%20CC%20Account%20sales.JPG" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="197" mt="true" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_ea3-LcbrX8A/S2DfcNqLzvI/AAAAAAAAAPs/AScsID-X5KI/s320/Flower%20Shop%20Cash%20CC%20Account%20sales.JPG" width="320"></a></div>
<div>The people tried to spend. Now they can&#8217;t.</div>
<div></div>
<p>So, let me be clear to the Congress and the President: I NEED CUSTOMERS&#8230;WITH MONEY!</p>
<p>Update:  A commentor asked for some more data.  <br />Ins, Maintenance, Rent, Utilities, and Property/inventory taxes are 13% of gross. Payroll is 25% Payroll is down 14%, but gross is down 16%. We can cut payroll more, but the issue becomes my sweety having some down time. (please no lectures). Payroll was 25% of gross last year. </p>
<p>Supplies (what we sell) were 48% of last years gross, this year 47%.</p>

                                <p>UPDATE: datacharmer at Bluematter <a href="http://bluematter.blogspot.com/2010/01/world-reacts-to-apple-ipad.html">thinks visually</a>.</p>
<p>Bruce, <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2010/01/why-apple-tablet-and-clones-will-change.html">yesterday</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Unless you have had the experience of using an advanced smartphone it is hard to explain how transforming it is to have the Internet in your pocket, if I have a question about anything it is mostly as close as my left pocket. But like the iPhone the Tablet is a lot more than a combined phone/usable web browser, it is a host for Apps, millions of them. And it is the Apps that are the game changer. Because the possibilities are quite literally endless.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sarah, <a href="http://www.smartbitchestrashybooks.com/index.php/weblog/comments/my-initial-reaction-to-the-ipad">today</a>:<br />
<blockquote>iPad?! Really?! REALLY? Gosh, I’m sorry I no longer have a Nook now. They would have been great partners.</p>
<p>The iPad, now available in Light, Maxi, and Super (8Gb, 16Gb 64Gb)? As Tessa Dare said, are there NO women at Apple who could have given them the heads up (HA) that this is a BAD NAME?&#8230;</p>
<p>This isn’t “standing on the shoulders of Kindle.” It’s giving the Kindle half a nod from across a ballroom full of other people you’d rather talk to&#8230;.</p>
<p>What about onboard social networks, email functionality, or notation from inside iBooks? Wouldn’t that be a key feature to intregrate with the endless onward wanking about Pages? For example: writing a report… and easily with a single gesture including both the source material and the citation using iBooks and Pages?</p>
<p>I realize that reading isn’t the utmost important thing for everyone else, but come on now! Productivity in all forms includes printed material. The lack of interaction demonstrated in iBook makes me hope for other reading alternatives on the iPad (DEAR GOD THE NAME). Color me underwhelmed in a big, big way.</p></blockquote>
<p>UPDATE II:  Brad <a href="http://firemeganmcardle.blogspot.com/2010/01/idontgetit.html">piles on</a>:<br />
<blockquote>But ffs, it can&#8217;t handle flash, and it doesn&#8217;t have any way to access media not on its own HD, no disc drive, no usb port in. That&#8217;s fine for a phone but not for a potential media player. Apple has finally made something I have no interest in owning.</p></blockquote>

<p>The US deficit, and its related total debt, are awesome worries.  </p>
<p>Military outlays need to be reviewed, by qualified analysts who have not bought into the climate of continuing to clothe the emperor in nothing.  Those outlays that are not &#8220;worth the expenditure of scarce taxpayer resources&#8221; in the military program need to be &#8220;cut&#8221;.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://nosint.blogspot.com/2010/01/pentagon-underscores-commitment-to-f-35.html">Naval Open Source Intelligence</a> reports: </p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Deputy Defense Secretary William Lynn on Thursday [21 Jan 10] underscored the Pentagon&#8217;s commitment to Lockheed Martin Corp&#8217;s $300 billion F-35 fighter jet, saying the U.S. government and its allies still planned to buy 3,000 of the new fighters over time.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are heavily investing in the F-35. A successful Joint Strike Fighter is at the heart of our continued air superiority,&#8221; Lynn told industry and military officials at a conference hosted by Tufts University and the Institute for Foreign Policy Analysis.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The pentagon&#8217;s commitment, like a drunken sailor, is toward the $300B for lockheed and the $600B in sustainment costs that the fighter jet represents.  The relationship between air superiority and the common defense is not the issue.  What does an airplane which cannot be built on time, pass its test and evaluation, and cannot be kept flying have to contribute to &#8220;air superioriity&#8221;?</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Heavily invested</i>&#8221; means we need to throw good money after bad.</p>
<p>What is important about &#8220;<i>air superiority</i>&#8220;?</p>
<p>The last airplane &#8220;at the heart of air superiority&#8221; with these issues was the F-22 (Lockheed, too).  For the original price of 800 F-22 the Air Force received 183.  For huge maintenace costs the &#8220;mission availability&#8221; is running 62%.  Mission availability is tracked at the flying units.  The total availability of F-22 airframes is half are broke at any time, because many airplanes are off the units property books.  These are really hard broke and the ones being refitted to fix scrap and rework problems that were found in test but since there is no relation between air superiority and these fighters they can buy the airplane and try to fix them after they are paid for.</p>
<p>If the F-35 were being purchased in a free market in a commercial contract the thing would have been terminated for breach and the judge would have awarded the buyer all their money back.</p>
<p>We must establish rules, which used to exist, that all contracts by the DoD be reveiwed for the value to the taxpayer, not for the money going off to Lockheed or Boeing or Northrop Grumman. </p>
<p>What sense to keep companies in business who cannot develop the F-35?</p>
<p>Air superiority is endangered by bad companies, and better served by killing the F-35.</p>
<p>Big military contracts are all suffering from poor performance from the big vendors.</p>
<p>The F-35 is the most recent and the one where the adminsitration needs to stand tall.<br />______________________________<br />by ilsm</p>
