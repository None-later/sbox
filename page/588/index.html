                                <p><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/26003168">Michael D. Shear and Jon Cohen</a> report:</p>
<blockquote><p>Democratic Sen. Barack Obama holds a 2 to 1 edge over Republican Sen. John McCain among the nation&#8217;s low-wage workers, but many are unconvinced that either presidential candidate would be better than the other at fixing the ailing economy or improving the health-care system, according to a new national poll. Obama&#8217;s advantage is attributable largely to overwhelming support from two traditional Democratic constituencies: African Americans and Hispanics. But even among white workers &#8212; a group of voters that has been targeted by both parties as a key to victory in November &#8212; Obama leads McCain by 10 percentage points, 47 percent to 37 percent, and has the advantage as the more empathetic candidate.</p></blockquote>
<p>This polling shows that the concern from Team Clinton that Obama would not do well with the group was silly.  But this ain’t exactly settled either:</p>
<blockquote><p>Still, one in six of the white workers polled remains uncommitted to either candidate. And a majority of those polled, both white and minority, are ambivalent about the impact of the election, saying that no matter who wins, their personal finances are unlikely to change &#8230; In May, as the race between Obama and Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton raged on, McCain adviser Charlie Black told reporters that the campaign would reach out to working-class white voters, in part because of Obama&#8217;s difficulties wresting such voters from the Clinton camp. &#8220;Senator Obama doesn&#8217;t appear to have the ability to hold the traditional Democratic coalition together as well as Mrs. Clinton might,&#8221; he said at the time. In an interview last week, Black said the campaign still plans to target working-class white voters, particularly by appealing to them on economic and energy issues. Jobs and gasoline prices are &#8220;very big to people in that income range,&#8221; Black said. Nearly two-thirds of the white workers surveyed want the government to make lower gas prices a &#8220;top priority,&#8221; something McCain pitched earlier this year in advocating for a suspension of the federal gas tax. One respondent was particularly clear on this point: &#8220;I&#8217;ll vote for whoever can bring the price of gas down,&#8221; said Brian Levesque, 25, a social worker from Lansdale, Pa.  But slightly more, seven in 10, say government should focus on helping people like them find more affordable health insurance, a core component of Obama&#8217;s campaign. Fewer, just over four in 10, favor placing a top priority on tax cuts or the creation of new jobs through an expansion of public works projects.</p></blockquote>
<p>Pandering with ineffective but nice sounding energy policies has become McCain’s stock in trade.  And free lunch tax cuts for everyone have been the GOP play book as far back as 1980.  It’s not leadership but it has helped the GOP in the past.</p>

                                <p>BankAtlantic Bancorp <a href="http://www.247wallst.com/2008/07/bankatlantic-su.html">is suing</a> Richard Bove, a respected bank analyst, for<br />
<blockquote>for defamation and negligence stemming from a widely distributed and frequently republished report by Bove and Ladenburg</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/04/business/04analyst.html">Bove</a> printed a list of possible bank failures, entitled &#8220;Who&#8217;s Next.&#8221;<br />
<blockquote>What followed was a list of 107 banks, ranked according to two measures of their financial strength. The share prices of some of the banks promptly collapsed.<br />But No. 10 on the first list, BankAtlantic Bancorp of Fort Lauderdale, fired back. The bank said Mr. Bove’s numbers were wrong — and sued him and his employer, a small brokerage firm called Ladenburg Thalmann, for defamation. Mr. Bove would not comment on the suit. A lawyer for BankAtlantic said the bank planned to ask the judge to expedite the case.</p></blockquote>
<p>According to the NYT, the crux of the matter is that BankAtlantic claims that<br />
<blockquote>Mr. Bove based his analysis on incorrect figures — he should have used the capital of the bank’s holding company, rather than of the bank itself, BankAtlantic said — Mr. Bove sent a note to clients explaining BankAtlantic’s view. BankAtlantic is not among the 27 companies that Mr. Bove regularly covers.</p></blockquote>
<p>The first response of outsiders to the banking industry may be: &#8220;Hey, BankAtlantic is right. Bove&#8217;s list may well create a false run its bank.&#8221; My wife&#8217;s response was just that.<br />But before, you jump to that conclusion, consider the following:
<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.ladenburg.com/RichardXBove.asp">Ladenburg Thalman</a> Ladenburg Thalman and Richard Bove are highly respected in the industry.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/25664376?__source=RSS*blog*&#038;par=RSS">How</a> Bove arrived at his numbers and what interpretation he gave them. (In effect, he calculated what banks were above, in, or below the danger zone. As far as I can tell, he did not say if particular bank would fail.)</li>
</ol>
<p>Unfortunately, I do not have access to the actual Bove report. Nonetheless, BankAtlantic&#8217;s suit raises interesting questions.
</p>
<p>First, there is the question of potentially creating a false run on a bank.
</p>
<p>Second, and on the other hand, there is the question of industry transparency. That banks may have packaged and sold toxic products does not exactly create an air of trust.
</p>
<p>Third is the relationship between this holding company and the bank in question. Will the holding company dump its child if it becomes unprofitable? </p>
<p>Fourth, and perhaps most interesting, is: Can an analyst safely forward his own analysis and not risk the threat of lawsuit? In short, can banks muzzle honest and fair analyses? </p>
<p><a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/25664376?__source=RSS*blog*&#038;par=RSS">Jane Wells</a> quotes Bove as saying: </p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;All of the actions are to deepen the trend. It really is beyond inexcusable for top policymakers to argue that large financial institutions should be allowed to fail. It is, of course, just as inexcusable to look the other way while excesses are driven through the system.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>And, from <a href="http://www.247wallst.com/2008/07/bankatlantic-su.html">24/7 Wall St.</a><br />
<blockquote>Frankly, this is shocking that a bank would sue a brokerage firm and such a respected analyst on Wall Street over their analysis. Everyone conducts their own analysis and has their own methodology. If Bove would have reported the firm IS going under or IS imploding or if he attempted to cause a scare with no data to point to then we&#8217;d understand, but the fact that BankAtlantic is going after a right to an opinion or a right to openly present data is one which very few large firms ever attempt.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>Last week, the Senate <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/environmentalcapital/2008/07/30/wind-breaker-senate-again-rejects-tax-breaks-for-clean-energy/">failed to invoke cloture</a> on <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:s.03335:">S.3335</a>, a measure which among other things would extend the production tax credits for solar and wind energy, plug the Highway Trust Fund deficit, and keep the Alternative Minimum Tax at bay for elements of the lower-upper-middle-classes for another year.  The vote was 51-43, with a few mostly endangered Republicans joining the Democrats, and Harry Reid voting Nay for procedural reasons — so the bill does have at least majority support.</p>
<p>In fact, since the elements of the package are broadly popular if not useful, this bizarrely enough seems to be an effort of the Republicans to be against a package of tax cuts before they&#8217;re for it.  (More Republicans than Norm Coleman and Gordon Smith would be hard pressed to vote Nay in a final vote, methinks.)  Whether this represents Pyrrhic support for the Bush administration&#8217;s idiotic plan to raid transit funds for the highways, or an effort to get the Democrats to accept oil drilling to get essential legislation passed, is unclear from the reporting I&#8217;ve seen.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d seen Tom Ridge on TV yesterday claiming that it&#8217;s the Republicans with a comprehensive energy plan, whereas Obama is supposedly opposed to the zero nuclear plants currently under construction.  In fact, not only are the Republicans working to effectively throw a spanner in the works of the rapidly expanding renewables industry — providing generating capacity with no sensitivity to fossil fuel prices in multi-gigawatt quantities now.  In fact, it may be <a href="http://www.johnmccain.com//Informing/Issues/17671aa4-2fe8-4008-859f-0ef1468e96f4.htm">down the page</a> but McCain supports the tax credits his caucus is opposing.</p>

<p>From the comments, CoRev states:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;ILSM, breaking the rqmts [requirements] into bite sized chunks (design or parts of it) can work if the rqmts are reasonably well defined. Buying an entire Weps [weapon system], even with a fly-off, is/was ludicrous. Every engineering change and there will ALWAYS be many open/re-opens and re-re-opens (ad infinitum) negotiations. Ends up in a near continuous loop of negotiations with few deliveries.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Thanks for capitalizing ilsm.</p>
<p>I have extensive experience watering down specifications, allowing substandard materials and generally portraying the changes as &#8216;enhancements&#8217; and when the costs go out of sight, alleging that the government made all these chnages because it needed better performance.  <br />CoRev makes points which are valid if frightening.<br />One, the whittlers are not up to doing airplanes or anything large and need to stop doing what they always fail at.  Which is sort of the purpose of me writing whittle posts.  Thanks CoRev.</p>
<p>The inept need to refrain from doing what they cannot do.  Such a logical propostion is alien inside the belt way.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ends up in a near continuous loop of negotiations with few deliveries.&#8221;</p>
<p>Great catch.  The endless negotiations are caused by two things:  the government (the original management team already escaped) has no idea what it has &#8220;required&#8221; the suppliers to do, and the suppliers could not deliver even the easiest engineering task.  It is very profitable to keep doing things over and over.  CoRev is correct here, it is a miracle if anything of use is delivered.</p>
<p>The point of fixed price versus cost plus is the profit margin is much better in fixed price.  In both forms the fraud, waste and abuse of the tax payer and the soldier are the same.</p>
<p>Final point, change proposals (which are sent in after the incompetent government has control of the design) and change notices (when the industry side is charging to water down the &#8220;requirement&#8221;) are a continuous, expensive and unproductive loop which marks CoRev&#8217;s first point.</p>
<p>After the series of continuous changes and renegotiations neither the government nor the suppliers remember that what they were supposed to deliver was something that is worth the expenditure of the taxpayers&#8217; grand kids&#8217; scarce resources.</p>
<p>Better to whittle beaks than try to get the pentagon to buy anything more complex than a mouse trap.</p>

<blockquote><p>Despite intense U.S. pressure, Iraqi leaders failed Sunday to resolve differences over how to govern the oil-rich city of Kirkuk — a dispute that is blocking provincial elections and stoking tension in the volatile north.  Also Sunday, a truck bomb exploded in a Sunni area of northern Baghdad, killing 12 people, wounding 23 and raising concern about a revival of sectarian conflict.  Parliament had called a special session Sunday to try to reach agreement on a bill authorizing elections in all 18 Iraqi provinces — a move the United States considers essential to reconciling Iraq&#8217;s rival ethnic and religious communities.  But the session never convened because intensive talks among party and legislative leaders were unable to produce agreement on a formula that would satisfy Arab, Kurdish and Turkoman demands for governing Kirkuk.</p></blockquote>
<p>The success of the surge – or lack thereof &#8211; can not be solely measured in military terms.</p>

<blockquote><p>By the time McCain spoke up feebly against the Swift boat campaign, the damage had been done &#8212; to him as well as to Kerry. He had undergone a public transformation into a willing instrument of lesser men who trampled on his character and his honor, even his patriotism, just as his campaign is now seeking to do to Obama.</p></blockquote>
<p>The press gave McCain a lot of credit for saying the SwiftBoating should stop.  I thought it ringed hollow for a simple reason.  When Bush-Cheney let the SwiftBoating continue, a real maverick would have refused to campaign for these thugs.  But what did McCain do?  He campaigned for them enthusiastically. Something about actions speaking louder than words.</p>

Andrew responded with a new post attempting to rebut my argument. You can see the whole thing at <a href="http://andrewgbiggs.blogspot.com/2008/08/responding-to-angry-bear-where-does-17.html">Responding to Angry Bear: Where does $17 trillion come from</a> including my response to Biggs as well as one to Patrick R. Sullivan (if you were wondering where PRS was (and I wasn&#8217;t) the answer seems to be over at scrivener.net). But I want to put up the core of Andrew&#8217;s argument and my response.<br />
<blockquote>Ordinarily, we think about Social Security&#8217;s finances in cross-section – e.g., how do all taxes paid by all workers in a given year compare to all benefits owed to all retirees or disabled in that year? That&#8217;s obviously very relevant.</p>
<p>But another way of measuring things is by birth cohort: how did all the taxes paid by individuals born in a given year compare to all the benefits they have or will receive? This approach, best known as &#8220;generational accounting,&#8221; was first proposed by Gokhale, Auerbach and Kotlikoff (see this backgrounder by the Tax Policy Center) and has become a standard way of analyzing how the program treats individuals in different birth cohorts. It&#8217;s through a generational accounting approach that we can see where the long-term shortfall comes from.</p>
<p>So for each birth cohort taking part in Social Security, we can calculate (or, for future beneficiaries, project) how their total taxes will compare to their total benefits. If we discount all these values to 2008, add them up and then subtract the current value of the Social Security trust fund, we get the total infinite horizon shortfall for the program. Currently, that amount is projected at $13.6 trillion in present value.</p></blockquote>
<p>He then follows up with an argument from rate of return (for my counter see the comments there) and then concludes with the following:<br />
<blockquote>Now think about future retirees: even if we could pay full scheduled benefits – that is, even if the Low Cost projections came true and we had no solvency problem – future retirees will receive less in benefits than they paid in taxes.</p>
<p>I can sum up the argument in this way:</p>
<p>1.the infinite horizon shortfall is the sum of the net taxes or benefits paid by each cohort, from 1935 through the infinite future; and<br />2.the infinite horizon shortfall is calculated under scheduled benefits; and<br />3.we know that early cohorts received more in (benefits) than they paid in (taxes), and current/future retirees will receive less in benefits than they pay in taxes; therefore we can conclude:<br />4.that the infinite horizon shortfall is entirely attributable to the fact that early cohorts of retirees received far more in benefits than they paid in taxes.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well no. First of all he is making a jump from &#8216;rate of return&#8217; to &#8216;total return&#8217; that is not logically valid, that is 10% interest on a $1000 account gives you $100 whereas 4.5% interest on a $100,000 account gets you $4,500. But the confusion doesn&#8217;t stop there, we don&#8217;t &#8216;know&#8217; that three is true at all. Biggs simply has not yet made the case though he may think he has. But the real answer is to be found (as usual) in the numbers. My response, complete with juicy data is to be found under the fold. </p>
<p>{I edited Biggs&#8217; no. 3 to correct a clear error. His original had people receiving taxes and paying benefits, something he clearly didn&#8217;t intend}</p>
<p>I spent some time this morning with the Historical Tables (IV.A2 and IV.A4 specifically) and did the simple exercise of adding up actual benefits paid out.<br />OAS 1941-1956 $25.6 billion<br />OASDI 1957-1968 $181 billion<br />OASDI 1969-1980 $793.1 billion<br />OASDI 1981-1992 $2.476.5 trillion<br />OASDI 1993-2000 $2.829.3 trillion<br />OASDI 2001-2007 $6.330,9 trillion</p>
<p>For a grand total of $12.636.4 trillion. For Glass to state openly as he did here {at Biggs&#8217;} and at his website that<br />&#8220;If you look at this table {IV.B7} you&#8217;ll see that past/present participants have received $17.4 trillion more in benefits than they paid in taxes.&#8221; is simply not true, and the problem goes far beyond the tense problem in &#8220;have received&#8221;. Instead he simply skipped over the relevant Trustees&#8217; definition of &#8216;current participant&#8217; and ignored the 100 year time frame for costs that generate that $17.1 trillion. Of that amount fully $10.4 trillion falls in the period 2083 to 2108. Trying either to blame this on past beneficiaries or scaring current workers into thinking they actually have to come up with this amount above and beyond what they will actually receive in benefits is just nonsense, and if deliberate pernicious nonsense. No worker scheduled to retire by 2041 (interestingly almost exactly 67 years after the 1983 reform) is likely to collect benefits after 2083, meaning no one born before 1974 is going to be making a claim on that $10.4 trillion. Moreover no one born before 2016, which is to say no one currently born, is going to have to make any part of that post 2082 claim good.  That $10 billion plus time shifts away. It is a simple matter of using a long term calender.</p>
<p>So while the following is a perfectly good way of framing the problem: <br />&#8220;But another way of measuring things is by birth cohort: how did all the taxes paid by individuals born in a given year compare to all the benefits they have or will receive?&#8221; The answer is not to be found in Table IV.B7 and only in a limited way in IV.B6. Instead the answer is to take those birth cohorts seperately, and if you do you will see that each cohort from the Boomers on back to program inception left or is projected to leave the Trust Fund with a positive TF ratio. Given that it is hard to see where the inequity comes from, all of the unfunded liability and all of the revenue needed to backfill it or contrawise the benefit cuts fall on Gen-X and beyond. To project this future gap backwards approaches dishonesty.</p>
<p>As to the graph {seen via link to Biggs} I am not particularly impressed. A 21 year old in 1936 would not be eligible for full benefits until 1980 at which point everyone would be phased into the system. Almost all of the drop before that would seem to be attributable to people becoming eligible for retirement even though they had some to many years of non-contribution. The graph properly interpreted just shows what happens when the program is fully phased in, an event that didn&#8217;t happen until 44 years from program inception.</p>
<p>Too you would need to correct some of those earlier ROI to reflect the cost of paying <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/07/soc-sec-xxxi-what-is-title-1-how-does.html">Title 1</a> benefits out of the General Fund. The dollar value of taxes needed to pay those benefits should be added to actual contributions from payroll to get a real idea of what the real ratio of tax to benefits was. As Title 1 phased out current workers got a silent tax cut, all things being equal the cost of supplying benefits to then current beneficiaries got that much cheaper. (Of course that silent tax cut may have been totally offset by increases in payroll tax over the time period.)</p>
<p>But even after making those corrections I don&#8217;t think the following is correct:<br />&#8220;3. we know that early cohorts received more in (benefits) than they paid in (taxes), and current/future retirees will receive less in benefits than they pay in taxes; therefore we can conclude:<br />4. that the infinite horizon shortfall is entirely attributable to the fact that early cohorts of retirees received far more in benefits than they paid in taxes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well no. 4 does not follow from 3. Total benefits paid out from program inception to 1980 were only $999.6 billion. Even now the total of benefits paid out does not equal projected unfunded liability and was funded to boot. The unfunded liability to Infinite Future is entirely due to a gap in projected cost via projected revenue starting in 2041 and not due to past benefit payments at all. I am afraid I am still not able to accept the Biggs/Glass formulation.</p>

<blockquote><p>McCain campaign&#8217;s strategy on race is to (a) play the race card and then (b) accuse Obama of having played the race card.  The issue here, of course, is that John McCain claimed great umbrage at Barack Obama&#8217;s lighthearted comment that Bush and McCain would emphasize that &#8220;he doesn&#8217;t look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills.&#8221;  But if John McCain thinks that comment was playing the race card, then why did he play it first? One month ago &#8212; in late June &#8212; a McCain ad superimposed Obama&#8217;s visage on a one hundred dollar bill as part of an effort to mock his supposed &#8216;presumptuousness.&#8217;</p></blockquote>
<p>And now <a href="http://www.johnmccain.com/Informing/News/PressReleases/Read.aspx?guid=98ea74be-42cd-4e65-8837-e24b06126534">McCain</a> is putting out a really idiotic ad that claims Obama is forgetting that Latin America even exists.  These ads assume that Americans are just stupid.  I stand by <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/08/team-mccain-steve-schmidt-effect.html">this post</a> even if it attracts really pathetic comments from Rovian jerks.  Message to these jerks – if you wish to insult other economist bloggers behind their backs, take your garbage somewhere else.  Thank you!</p>
<p>Update: Conservative <a href="http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2008/08/hello-to-all-th.html">Andrew Sullivan</a> is unhappy with the McCain smear campaign:</p>
<blockquote><p>They really played the arugula card? For all McCain&#8217;s personal qualities, we&#8217;re learning that the machine behind the GOP simply re-makes the campaign in its own Coulterite image. Instead of actually fighting on the core questions &#8211; how do we get out of Iraq with the least damage? how do we get past carbon-based energy? how do we tackle al Qaeda&#8217;s new base in Pakistan and within the nuclear-armed Pakistani government? how will we reduce the massive debt bequeathed us by the Bush-Rove GOP? how do we restore the Geneva Conventions? &#8211; we are debating people&#8217;s cultural insecurities and food choices. The slow collapse of conservatism as a coherent governing philosophy is not unrelated to this. If you never want to fight campaigns on policy, why bother crafting any?</p></blockquote>
<p>Ah but Team McCain has lots of policy proposals to allegedly lower gasoline prices.  Never mind that none of them will do so.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.forbes.com/opinions/forbes/2008/0811/025.html">Ernesto Zedillo</a> provides an insightful discussion on the causes of higher food prices, which includes:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is clear, however, that the most damaging distortions in agricultural markets originate in rich countries. There&#8217;s little doubt that the present spiral in grain prices is closely linked to U.S. and EU policies enacted to boost production of biofuels. The American and European governments subsidize the production of biofuels, limit their import and mandate their use. The exact extent to which these policies have impacted food prices is still a matter of contention, but not even the most enthusiastic proponents of ethanol can deny that by inducing a greater allocation of agricultural resources toward biofuel production, the amount of grain available for food has been reduced. According to the World Bank, while global production of corn increased by 51 million tons from 2004 to 2007, biofuel use of corn in the U.S. alone increased by 50 million tons, thus leaving no margin to satisfy the increase of 33 million tons in global consumption for other uses during the same period. This explains why some respectable experts, such as the former chief economist for the U.S. Department of Agriculture and a top World Bank agricultural economist, have imputed a large proportion of the rise in food prices to the growing use of food crops for fuel.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hat tip to <a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2008/08/why-food-prices-are-rising.html">Greg Mankiw</a> who is suggesting that Barack Obama should reconsider his support for corn based biofuel production.</p>
<p>Update: Movie Guy points us to <a href="http://www.zealllc.com/2008/grains.htm">Zeal Speculation and Investment</a> for another discussion of food prices:</p>
<blockquote><p>Over the last several decades a whole slew of factors have provided catalysts for the rise of the grains.  With one of the largest being the lack of material growth in the agricultural industry.  And considering the long-time behavior of grains prices, it is understandable why there has been little incentive to grow this industry. When the price of any good or service grinds sideways for decades on end while the rest of the world is inflating away, this tends to harbor dismal growth prospects.  And this is typically not an encouraging environment for capital investment.  In fact if the fruits of the land are not as appealing as an offer from a commercial developer, a prudent business operator will take the money and run. While technology improvements over the years have indeed enabled better crop yields, according to the US Department of Agriculture the US planted area for the major crops has dropped by nearly 15% since 1980 … The simple fact is the world’s population continues to grow, and so does the demand for staple foods.  So with the primary end product of grains being food, supply needs to keep up with growing demand.  And it is not!  Supplies have been growing, but not sufficiently enough to meet demand growth.  And to put a twist into this supply/demand imbalance, segmented economic prosperity is also changing the dynamics of the grains trade.  Economic growth in the world’s developing nations has and will cause extra strains on the grains.  As more and more people add protein and other valuable nutrients to their diets, grains demand will continue to gain strength … As will be apparent in the long-term charts the grains have been range-bound in sideways trend channels for the better part of the last four decades.  Every so often there were strong rallies that elevated prices, but they quickly fell back within trend.  But what we are seeing in the last couple years are major breakouts from these trends.</p></blockquote>
<p>Nominal prices stay relatively constant and then they doubled over the past few years – what’s wrong with this story?  Go further down and look at the last three graphs showing the relative prices of corn, wheat, and soybeans from 1970 to today.  Relative prices spiked in the early 1970’s and then fell quite dramatically over time.  As the charts show, real prices really are not that high compared to where they were in 1970.  Oh well, it was a neat story until we adjusted for inflation!</p>
