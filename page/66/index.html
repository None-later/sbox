<p> Auto and light truck sales for September was just reported at a rather strong 14.96 million units. This puts sales back above the strong trend line for this recovery. </p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-MjXdCxrv_38/UGtQdQnwBRI/AAAAAAAACQI/bLI8u17x_ns/s1600/Clipboard01+AUTO+SALES.bmp"><img border="0" height="271" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-MjXdCxrv_38/UGtQdQnwBRI/AAAAAAAACQI/bLI8u17x_ns/s400/Clipboard01+AUTO+SALES.bmp" width="400"></a></p>
<p>But it might be more interesting to look at production that has also been very strong. <br />Since production bottomed during the cash for clunkers program industrial production of autos and light trucks has risen more that 150% .  Remember, the original rational for the cash for clunkers program was to reduce excess inventories so that the auto firms would expand production.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-NqW80vjVKz8/UGtQXjIK9nI/AAAAAAAACQA/R5sYTQk3_NQ/s1600/Clipboard01+AUTO+IP.bmp"><img border="0" height="271" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-NqW80vjVKz8/UGtQXjIK9nI/AAAAAAAACQA/R5sYTQk3_NQ/s400/Clipboard01+AUTO+IP.bmp" width="400"></a></p>
<p>But an even more interesting comparison is to compare total vehicle output &#8212; including light and heavy trucks as well as parts &#8212;  to employment in the production of motor vehicles.  Total output is now at new all time record highs, surpassing the early 2000s peak.  But employment in the motor vehicle  industry is now 780,700 as compared to 1,330,000 in February, 2000 and 651,100 at the recession bottom.  So since the recession bottom employment in the industry is up 21% while production is up over 150%.</p>

<div></div>
<div>First, Justice Anthony Kennedy wants to know what possible connection there is between Esther Kiobel, the wrongs she says unfolded in Nigeria, and the United States. The answer the plaintiffs’ lawyer, Paul Hoffman, gives is that his clients live here because the U.S. government gave them asylum. Also, Royal Dutch Petroleum does plenty of business here. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Kennedy doesn’t like the sound of that. “Your position is that a U.S. company that allegedly commits a human rights violation could be sued in any court in the world?” he asks. Note the switch—now it’s our homegrown corporation, not a company called Royal Dutch, that’s the pirate.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Justice Antonin Scalia backs up Kennedy, asking whether it will be “some super body that decides what constitutes a violation” of human rights. This is not a superhero kind of super body. It’s the kind that usurps U.S. sovereignty. Hoffman tries to erase the image: The courts of nations around the world have long determined human rights norms, he says. But Scalia is with Kennedy: unhappy about a world in which U.S. corporations can be held liable for human rights abuses in foreign courts. Justice Samuel Alito doesn’t like Hoffman’s notion either, and Chief Justice John Roberts seems skeptical, too. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Hoffman next addresses all the ways his clients could still get kicked out of court, even if they make it past today’s tangle with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_Tort_Statute">Alien Tort Statute</a>. They could be told to file suit in Nigeria, or the Netherlands or the United Kingdom, where Royal Dutch Petroleum is based. Hoffman concedes that it’s not clear from the record whether they’ve done so yet. (This is the doctrine called exhaustion, which is how it feels to be told to go back and start over somewhere else.) Kiobel and the other plaintiffs could also be told that another forum, outside the United States, is simply better. (This is the doctrine called <em>forum non conveniens</em>, the rare Latin phrase that makes sense without translation.)

</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Pardon me.  But it sure sounds like Scalia’s complaint is really with—Can this be?—the Founders, who, by enacting a statute that gives federal courts jurisdiction to hear claims by aliens for torts “in violation of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_international_law" title="Public international law">law of nations</a>,” provided that it will be some super body that decides what constitutes a violation of human rights.  And (assuming that Scalia thinks there should be an “exhaustion” requirement, even though, clearly, there is not one in the language of the statute) who—those lame Founders!—failed to include an “exhaustion” requirement in the statute.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>Ditto for Kennedy, who’s angry because he thinks that the very first Congress’s position was that a U.S. company that allegedly commits a human rights violation could be sued in any court in the world, even though the statute actually only provides for lawsuits in U.S. federal courts, not for lawsuits in other countries’ courts.  Or at least, he later explains, he’s angry, and worried, that if the United States Congress can pass a law that allows aliens to sue foreign corporations in United States courts for torts “committed in violation of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_international_law" title="Public international law">law of nations</a> or a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_treaties" title="List of United States treaties">treaty of the United States</a>, that might encourage other countries to retaliate and enact a similar, mirror statute.  And then, woe is Exxon Mobil. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Repeatedly during yesterday’s argument, Kennedy raised issues with such a policy.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Why didn’t President Washington veto that law, for Chrissake!? Instead, the jerk, and that Congress, left it to a future generation of justices to rewrite the statute to limit it to lawsuits against U.S. companies and foreign companies that commit torts against a U.S. alien in violation of the law of nations or a treaty of the United States. (A generation of justices that includes four who, only three months ago, railed against their five colleagues for what the four railers said was an unconstitutional rewriting of a statute, no less. A <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/s/supreme_court/affordable_care_act/index.html">very high-profile</a>statute.) </p>
<p>Oh, but wait. That original Congress actually did write the Alien Tort Statute to say that. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_Tort_Statute">Verbatim</a>. Even though the statute could encourage other countries to retaliate and enact a statute of their own that allows a U.S. company that allegedly commits a human rights violation to be sued in a court in that other country for violations of the law of nations, as defined by some super body. </p>
<p>Other countries haven’t done that yet. But they could. Whether or not the Supreme Court rewrites the Alien Tort Statute to discourage them from doing so, they could. Too bad that didn&#8217;t bother President Washington enough for him to veto the statute.</p></div>
<p>
<div>Also repeatedly yesterday, Samuel Alito <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/national/print/2012/10/as-scalia-falters-will-alito-fill-the-void-on-the-right/263049/">reiterated his own demand at the earlierargument </a>to know what, pray tell, connection the events at issue in the case have with this country.  But a better question is, why is that any of the Supreme Court’s business?  As the Court’s conservatives—led obsessively in recent years by Kennedy and Thomas—repeatedly remind at the robotic urging of state attorneys general, the Constitution grants Congress, not the courts, the authority to determine what types of cases the lower federal courts have “subject-matter jurisdiction,” i.e., the legal authority, to hear.  </div>
<div></div>
<div>This congressional power <i>is</i> subject to the constraints of other parts of the Constitution—for example, the Fourteenth Amendment and the Supremacy Clause, which Kennedy, <i>et al</i>., forget (or pretend to forget) apply to limit state courts’ free rein lest those insignificant parts of the Constitution infringe upon the sovereign dignity (their words, not mine) of states, by which they mean the sovereign dignity of state courts.  But the Fourteenth Amendment was added to the Constitution by a new set of framers, not the vaunted ones of the late 1700s, so that part of the Constitution doesn’t matter very much to the state-courts&#8217;-rights-to-violate-the-constitutional-rights-of-individuals crowd.  Unless of course some state legislature has, say, infringed upon the equal protection rights of an upscale high school student in Texas who graduated just below the top 10% of her high school class.  Or some other state legislature has limited the rights of corporate people to buy state politicians. </div>
<div></div>
<div>The defendant oil company in <i>Kiobel</i> <i>v. Royal Dutch Petroleum</i> doesn’t claim that the ATS would violate the Constitution if it is interpreted to allow lawsuits against them, by aliens, in federal court.  They just argue that the statute <i>shouldn’t</i> allow this, because, well, the events at issue have no connection with the United States and no other country has a similar law.  This appears to be good strategy, since, at least when state-court criminal defendants raise constitutional challenges in separate habeas corpus proceedings in federal court, the defendants almost always lose because the Supreme Court has interpreted a 1996 “jurisdictional” statute as effectively delegating to state courts the authority to violate the Constitution’s many guarantees in criminal cases.  This requires the federal courts to ignore not only the Fourteenth Amendment and the Supremacy Clause but also the provision in the Constitution’s provision that bars the suspension of the right of habeas corpus.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Kennedy’s incessant refrain in these cases is that, well, this is what Congress intended, and under the Constitution it is Congress that has the authority to enact federal-court-jurisdiction statutes.  But, setting aside whether the Supreme Court’s interpretation of that 1996 statute is even conceivably an accurate reflection of the intent of that Congress in enacting it, and the expectation of President Clinton in signing it—It was an election year, but still … really?—Kennedy &#038; Co. never appear concerned with the many, many, <i>many</i> policy problems caused by, say, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockyer_v._Andrade">thedramatic difference between </a>the right of a federal-court criminal defendant or prisoner, and the right of a state-court criminal defendant or prisoner to effectively assert constitutional rights.  That is, by the fact that the Supreme Court has interpreted that statute as effectively eliminating that right by state-court defendants or prisoners.   
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Or, say, by the utterly unexplained privileging of state judicial branches, which now are virtually free to violate individuals’ constitutional rights, at least if those individuals are criminal defendants, and the other two branches of state governments: the legislative and the executive branches.  Professional courtesy is, well, courteous, but there really legitimate reason to make it a constitutional principle?
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Tomorrow, the Court will hear a case in which that very issue will be addressed.  Seven years ago, almost to the day, in a unanimous opinion issued in a case called <i><a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=US&#038;navby=case&#038;vol=000&#038;invol=04-8384">Dye v. Hofbauer</a></i>, without full briefing and oral argument, the Court interpreted that 1996 statute, known as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiterrorism_and_Effective_Death_Penalty_Act_of_1996">Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act</a> (AEDPA), as requiring the state appellate courts to actually acknowledge the existence of a federal constitutional issue raised by the criminal defendant in the appeal, and then to actually analyze and rule on that federal constitutional issue, if the state courts were to be entitled to the “deference” that AEDPA requires the federal courts to accord the state courts when the state court ruling is challenged in federal court as unconstitutional.  A “deference” that in recent years has morphed into abdication—into a blatant flipping of the Constitution’s Supremacy Clause.  The case to be heard tomorrow is <i><a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/cavazos-v-williams/">Johnson v. Williams</a></i>, and in it, the Court will decide whether to overrule <i>Dye</i>—explicitly or, more likely, in effect without saying that that’s what it is doing.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>All in the name of the Constitution, y’know.  The very same Constitution that is about to allow the justices to rewrite a jurisdictional statute written by the Founders, so that it complies with the policy preferences of the current Supreme Court majority.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>When I read the transcript of tomorrow’s argument in <i>Johnson</i>, I’ll be looking for inquiries by Kennedy and Alito about the many policy problems with AEDPA, especially as the flip-the-Supremacy-Clause interpretation of it has metastasized over the years.  I won’t be holding my breath waiting to read that in the transcript, though, because I don’t want to turn blue.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div><i>Dye</i>, by the way, was the first opinion issued by the Court, in the early fall of 2005, after John Roberts was sworn in.  But that was then, and Kennedy hadn’t yet fully gained his sovereign-dignity-of-state-courts sea legs.  Nor had he yet managed to convince the sycophantic so-called liberals to quietly join him in this juggernaut.  All the better for them to go along to get along when it’s a case that—bet on it—will get no mainstream-media attention.  
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>It’s not like <i>Johnson</i> is a noisy culture-wars case, after all.  Not at all like it is.

<p>Unemployment Rates Across the Euro Area – Tough Times in Key Markets</p>
<p>Today Eurostat released its unemployment rate figures for the month of August. The Euro area unemployment rate held firm at 11.4% for the third consecutive month. Spain still has the highest unemployment rate in the euro area, 25.1%, and Greece is catching up quickly, 24.4% (in June, which is the latest data point).<br />The chart below illustrates the level of the unemployment rate and its month-month change for the euro area 12 countries.<br /><a href="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/10/urate_chart.jpg"><img alt="" height="402" src="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/10/urate_chart.jpg" width="604"></a></p>

<p>The periphery are under performing the average, with Spain, Greece, Portugal, and Ireland leading the way. Internal devaluation, or driving up the unemployment rate to reduce relative prices with demand, is really taking its toll. Respectively, the unemployment rates in Spain, Greece, Portugal, and Ireland are 178.9 ppt, 234.2 ppt, 93.9 ppt, and 212.5 ppt above their pre-crisis minimums (loosely defined since January 2008) – a simple average of 179.9 ppt above the joint minimum for these four countries. The average euro area 17 unemployment rate is just 56.2 ppt above its 7.3% pre-crisis minimum. Hard days in the periphery, to be sure. Against this backdrop, weekend <a href="http://www.eurointelligence.com/eurointelligence-news/home/singleview-restricted/article/peer-steinbrueck-to-challenge-angela-merkel.html">protests in Paris, Madrid, Lisbon, and Rome</a> are not a surprise.<br />I further point out the troubling trend in the French labor market, as the new government presents its fresh austerity budget for 2013.</p>

<p>This budget is highly dependent on tax revenue and positive growth momentum, which is likely to disappoint amid such deterioration in domestic demand. See <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/comment/ambroseevans_pritchard/9577674/Another-domino-falls-as-Hollande-pushes-France-into-depression.html">Ambrose Evans-Pritchard </a>on the expected budget impact.</p>

<p> The pile-on continues. As <a href="http://middleclasspoliticaleconomist.blogspot.com/2012/02/heritage-doubles-down-on-individual.html">I discussed in February</a>, Stuart Butler of the Heritage Foundation <a href="http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/opinion/forum/story/2012-02-03/health-individual-mandate-reform-heritage/52951140/1">wrote a breath-taking op-ed</a> in <i>USA Today</i> (via <a href="http://theincidentaleconomist.com/wordpress/stuart-butlers-change-of-mind/">Don Taylor</a>) denying that he fathered the individual mandate. In fact, his <i>revised</i> 140-page <a href="http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/1989/a-national-health-system-for-america">research paper</a> was <a href="http://middleclasspoliticaleconomist.blogspot.com/2012/02/conservatives-refute-butlerheritage.html">published January 2, 1989</a>, before President George HW Bush came into office, let alone President Clinton, whose proposals Butler says his research was directed against. Two conservatives, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/aroy/2012/02/07/the-tortuous-conservative-history-of-the-individual-mandate/">Avik Roy</a> of <i>Forbes</i> and <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204369404577211161144786448.html">James Taranto</a> of the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, played strong roles in locking down the point that Butler was the first to propose the mandate.<br />    <br />Today, J.D. Kleinke of the American Enterprise Institute goes straight to that 1989 report in a <i>New York Times</i> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/30/opinion/sunday/why-obamacare-is-a-conservatives-dream.html?pagewanted=1&#038;partner=rss&#038;emc=rss">opinion piece</a> to once again lay the mandate at the feet of Heritage. And why not? According to him, the Affordable Care Act is a conservative&#8217;s dream.<br />
<blockquote>The rationalization and extension of the current market is financed by the other linchpin of the law: the mandate that we all carry health insurance, an <a href="http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/1989/a-national-health-system-for-america">idea</a> forged not by liberal social engineers at the Brookings Institution but by conservative economists at the Heritage Foundation. The individual mandate recognizes that millions of Americans who could buy health insurance choose not to, because it requires trading away today’s wants for tomorrow’s needs. The mandate is about personal responsibility — a hallmark of conservative thought. </p></blockquote>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Kleinke argues that Romney&#8217;s incoherence on health care stems precisely from rejecting his accomplishment in Massachusetts. Romney can&#8217;t offer anything better than the ACA because it is the <i>only</i> conservative way to overcome the problems of the health care market while remaining based on the market and individual responsibility. With no single payer and no public option, it is not surprising that, as he puts it, &#8220;the health insurance industry has been quietly supporting the plan all along.&#8221;<br />    <br />Aside from his odd notion that single payer represents a &#8220;government takeover of health care&#8221; (Canada&#8217;s Medicare is not the United Kingdom&#8217;s National Health Service), Kleinke&#8217;s column is on the money: historically, the mandate <i>was</i> developed by Heritage economists, the ACA more broadly relies on conservative rather than liberal principles, and many liberals have been unenthusiastic for just that reason.</p>
<p>Heck, I&#8217;m unenthusiastic (single payer!). But it&#8217;s a big improvement over the status quo that is already providing benefits to millions of people, whether for <a href="http://middleclasspoliticaleconomist.blogspot.com/2011/09/aca-works-for-young-adults-as-planned.html">young adults</a>, the millions of consumers getting <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/07/guest-post-health-insurance-rebates.html">rebates</a> due to the medical loss ratio rule, or for seniors getting rid of the donut hole and gaining free preventive care.</p>

<p>Mitt Romney&#8217;s Unintentionally Hilarious Tax Return FAQ</p>
<p> Unless you&#8217;ve been in a coma, you have certainly heard about Mitt Romney&#8217;s release of his 2011 tax returns last Friday. You no doubt know that he and his wife did <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/election/2012/09/21/890451/by-romneys-own-standard-his-tax-returns-would-disqualify-him-from-the-presidency/">not claim all the charitable tax deductions</a> they were due, so their tax rate would not go below 13% of adjusted gross income. If you read <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-21/mitt-romney-paid-14-1-federal-tax-rate-in-2011-campaign-says.html">Bloomberg</a> or a newspaper that picked up the Bloomberg story, you know that Rafalca, the Romneys&#8217; dressage horse, has disappeared from their 2011 tax deductions. This, of course, raises the question of whether it was a legitimate deduction in 2010 (or earlier?). After all, being in the Olympics probably raised <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/janetnovack/2012/07/19/both-left-and-right-got-the-taxes-on-the-romneys-olympic-horse-wrong/">the mare&#8217;s</a> value, making the profit motive necessary for an allowable business deduction more plausible. So why would Rafalca not be eligible to deduct in 2011 if she were eligible in 2010 and probably gained value?    </p>
<p>But have you read the <a href="http://www.mittromney.com/frequently-asked-questions">Frequently Asked Questions</a> page the Romney campaign put up about the 2011 returns and the PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) summary of the Romneys&#8217; 1990-2009 taxes? You should, for the humor value, if nothing else.</p>
<p>In question 9, we learn how PwC calculated the average effective tax rate: they added the tax rate for each year, then divided by 20. This tells us almost nothing, as many observers (here&#8217;s <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/post/expert-romney-may-have-paid-less-in-taxes-over-20-years-than-it-appears/2012/09/21/41b27e00-041e-11e2-91e7-2962c74e7738_blog.html">one</a>, h/t Think Progress) have pointed out: $50 million taxed at 10% (though <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-21/mitt-romney-paid-14-1-federal-tax-rate-in-2011-campaign-says.html">the campaign claims</a> it was never less than 13.7%) and $5 million taxed at 30% would yield an average tax rate of 20%, using the PwC method, when the true tax rate would be 11.8% ($6.5/$55) in this example.    </p>
<p>In the very next question, however, we learn that for the total of federal taxes, state taxes, and charitable contributions (38.49%), PwC used the proper averaging methodology! In other words, adding up all the payment dollars and dividing by the total adjusted gross income (though we don&#8217;t know what tricks he used before adjusted gross income). Why didn&#8217;t they do that for tax alone?    </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>In 2011, the Romneys&#8217; charitable contributions came to just over twice their federal income tax ($4 million vs. $1.9 million). If that ratio applied for the entire 1990-2009 period, that would make the federal tax portion less than 13% (even lower because I have ignored state taxes). Of course, we have no way of knowing the real rate for federal or state taxes, or charitable deductions, without seeing the actual tax returns.    <br />But wait, there&#8217;s more! Don&#8217;t forget all the offshore accounts! To do this question and answer justice, I&#8217;ll have to quote it in full:    </p>
<p>12. There are some investments that seem to be established in offshore accounts, like the Cayman Islands and Bermuda. Are these investments evading taxes?    <br />Note the misdirection in the question, &#8220;evading&#8221; rather than &#8220;avoiding&#8221; taxes, which describe illegal and legal maneuvers respectively. Few people think Romney has broken the law, though <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/2012/08/investigating-mitt-romney-offshore-accounts">Nicholas Shaxson</a> considers it to be a possibility.    </p>
<p>No, the investments by the blind trusts in funds established in the Cayman Islands or other jurisdictions are taxed in the very same way they would be if the shares were held in the US rather than through a Cayman fund. No taxes are evaded or reduced. These funds are all registered with the IRS and report all income to investors and the IRS, just like domestic funds. Whether in Bermuda or Boston or elsewhere, there is no difference in how they are taxed.</p>
<p> If this were true, why would the funds need to be organized in the Cayman Islands? Boston would be a lot more convenient. No, as <a href="http://middleclasspoliticaleconomist.blogspot.com/2012/01/romneys-cayman-explanations-dont-tell.html">Richard Murphy</a> of Tax Research UK told me, these funds are set up to allow round tripping by U.S. investors to avoid U.S. taxes, though some foreigners may also take advantage of them. Moreover, if foreigners are exempt from U.S. taxes like the Unrelated Business Income Tax, what need do they have to invest through the Caymans except to avoid taxes at home? Finally, we know from the <a href="http://middleclasspoliticaleconomist.blogspot.com/2012/08/lid-blowing-off-romney-tax-secrecy.html">Gawker revelations</a> that at least two Cayman funds the Romneys invested in created five blocker corporations, which are set up precisely to allow round-tripping by Americans. How can these funds be established in the Cayman Islands, etc., for any reason other than tax avoidance?</p>
<p>In addition, it is important to note that there are no offshore accounts. These are investments in funds that are organized outside the US.</p>
<p> A fund organized in a secrecy jurisdiction like the Caymans, Bermuda, or Luxembourg is offshore by definition. </p>
<p>Further, it is important to note that Governor Romney did not make these investments. Governor and Mrs. Romney&#8217;s assets are managed on a blind basis. They do not control the investment of these assets. The assets are under the control and overall management of an independent trustee.</p>
<p> We&#8217;ve known since 1994 <a href="http://www.nationaljournal.com/2012-presidential-campaign/romney-criticized-kennedy-for-blind-trust-in-1994-senate-debate-video-20120127">what Romney thinks of blind trusts</a>, calling Senator Ted Kennedy&#8217;s &#8220;a ruse.&#8221; </p>
<p>Finally, the trustee did not choose where the investments were located any more than a stockholder in a Fortune 500 company chooses where that company is organized. Only the sponsor of the fund decides where it is organized. That responsibility is totally outside the control of a passive investor like Gov. Romney or the trustee of his blind trust.</p>
<p> And a stockholder can sell his shares. Has trustee Brad Malt never heard of &#8220;divestment&#8221;? I was one of thousands of people active in the late 1970s to get our universities to sell stock in companies doing business in South Africa, the &#8220;divestment movement.&#8221; While we weren&#8217;t very successful at Princeton, students and faculty at many other universities were, and some major local government funds divested from such firms, too, leading companies like Citicorp to end their South African operations. Malt could sell if he wanted to.<br />The bottom line is the &#8220;same as it ever was,&#8221; one tax system for the 1% and another one for the rest of us.</p>

<p>I really like this <a href="http://www.igmchicago.org/igm-economic-experts-panel">IGM panel</a> (check out the roster — pretty damned impressive, or at least credentialed), but I wish they didn’t post such wishy-washy, softball questions. I post this one because it’s not.</p>
<p>The one I’d really like them to ask:</p>
<p>A modern, prosperous country taxing 40% of GDP is likely to grow significantly more slowly over the long term than one taxing 30% of GDP.</p>

<div>Hi Bev, </p>
<p>I have read about this case. Still unclear even after reading your piece as to what the law was for, to do and how the new interpretation changes it. Would love some more expansion on it.</p>
<p>With that, I wonder if it will really matter if that Trans Pacific Partnership goes through.
</p>
</div>

<div>Hi, Dan.  In my opinion, the biggest problem with most mainstream-media coverage of the Supreme Court is that they mainly cover only Supreme Court decisions that address what lawyers call “substantive” issues—the stuff that actually addresses bottom-line issues that most people think of as what the Supreme Court decides, such as whether something violates the First Amendment or the Fourth Amendment (e.g., search-and-seizure).  But a huge, huge part of what the Supreme Court does is decide “procedural” issues, especially “jurisdictional” issues (which make up a huge, huge part of “procedural” issues—and those issues concern the threshold question of who has access to court, and under what circumstances.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The Reagan-era rightwing legal types—federal judges appointed in the 1980s and people like John Roberts and Samuel Alito, who worked as political appointees in the Reagan Justice Dept., and others who “came of age” during that period—have engaged in a decades-long, extremely effective crusade to turn federal law into mainly procedural/jurisdictional law, and to do so in a way that, in effect, lets judges interpret these procedural/jurisdictional (and, closely related to jurisdictional, “immunity”-from-liability) law to bar nearly all constitutional civil rights cases, and many other types of cases, that the ideological right disfavors on <i>substantive</i> grounds, while finding no such procedural/jurisdictional bars when the issue is, say, property “takings” rights or one of the other two or three type of constitutional rights favored by the right. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Anthony Kennedy and Clarence Thomas are at the very forefront of this type of thing.  Kennedy’s views on this are truly bizarre and utterly unfounded in any reasonable interpretation of American law since the Fourteenth Amendment became part of the Constitution.  He believes that state courts, unlike the two other branches of state government—the executive and legislative branches—are free to ignore constitutional rights, because otherwise the federal government (the federal courts) would be undermining “federalism” and thus the “dignity” of the states as “sovereigns.”  But he never explains why he recognizes that the two other branches of state government have no such exemptions from the Constitution’s Supremacy Clause.  Thomas, by contrast, simply doesn’t recognize the Supremacy Clause at all, except for such things as gun-ownership rights, reverse-discrimination Equal Protection rights, property “takings” rights, and the right to commandeer, say, a public school event to proselytize on evangelical Christianity.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The Supremacy Clause is at Article VI, Clause 2.  It says:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in pursuance thereof; and all treaties made, or which shall be made, under the authority of the United States, shall be the supreme law of the land; and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby, anything in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>All that said, the issues in <i>Kiobel</i> [<i>v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co</i>.] concern only the interpretation of a federal court-jurisdiction <i>statute</i>—access to federal court in a personal-injury/property-damage case.  The issues and arguments are so arcane (inside-baseball) that it’s hard to summarize them briefly, mainly because the issues in this go-around at the Court are different that the ones argued there last spring—but that doesn’t mean that the earlier-argued ones won’t ultimately be the issues on which the case is decided. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>So, [here’s] a good article on it all, that I think is understandable to lay people.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>I also posted a PS to Dan, saying:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>I don’t know enough about the specifics of the Trans Pacific Partnership provisions to know whether or not it would affect the application of the Alien Tort Act*, Dan.  It seems to me, from googling the pact, that it could, but I really don’t know.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Basically, what that crowd has done is erect a series of classic violations of the constitutional construct of equal protection of the law.  They’ve done so in two separate ways:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>First, they have effectively closed down the Supreme Court except for a tiny, tiny handful of cases, almost always only when asked by a state or local government, a state or local government official (usually a prosecutor), a crusader on some issue, represented* for free by some rightwing lawyers’ group, or a corporation or very wealthy federal criminal defendant represented by some $1,000 per hr. Supreme Court “specialist.”  </div>
<div></div>
<div>They do this increasingly these days, apparently largely at the behest of Kennedy (at least when a lower court has violated the “sovereign dignity” of a state court in a state criminal case) by acting as a “court of error,” correcting what they claim is legal error by the lower court in contradicting what the good justices say is clear Supreme Court precedent, but by ignoring, year after year, so many other clear instances of lower courts ignoring Supreme Court precedent that it’s downright jaw-dropping, because, after all, they continue to claim, the Supreme Court isn’t a “court of error.”  (Antonin Scalia is especially vocal on this, except, of course, when he decides that it can serve that very purpose.)
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>And, second, they have deliberately established such convoluted procedural/jurisdictional rules that those rules are inherently (and, surely, by design) open to whatever interpretation the lower-court judges wish.  And almost always, what they wish is to dismiss lawsuits.  And so that’s what they do.  Most judges, irrespective of which president appointed them, do this these days, simply to lighten their civil case to, roughly, cases filed by large corporations.  (State-court judges caught on to this free-for-all a while back, and do the same.) 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>But, as for the Supreme Court, many, many of us who actually follow it closely recognize that it’s become a perverse joke—a non-serious institution that continues to have profoundly serious control over very serious matters.  Sort of like other venerable American institutions—the old, once-venerable Wall Street brokerage firms, for example—that have been commandeered, morally, by the ideological right in the last three decades.  With similar results.

<div>SECOND UPDATE:<a href="http://eenews.net/public/Greenwire/2012/09/28/2">Here’s</a> a good discussion of the “law of nations” language in the Alien Tort Statute*, and why, at least in the opinion of environmentalists, <i>that</i>—i.e., this <i>substantive</i> issue—rather than the procedural issues that the conservatives raise, is what <i>Kiobel</i> <i>should</i> be about.  The Court will address this substantive issue only if it rules against the oil company on the jurisdictional issues—are foreign corporations “aliens” within the meaning of the statute, and if so, does the statute limit its reach to cases with ties to the United States?  It seems really unlikely that it will decide that the statute applies to conduct untied to the United States—even though drawing that conclusion requires—horrors!—looking beyond the text of the statute to legislative history. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Which, as luck would have it, is perfectly appropriate if that’s what it takes to rule in favor of an oil company and other mega-corporations.
</p>
<p>&#8212;-<br />*Correction, Oct. 2: The statute is known by two names: The Alien Tort Statute (ATS) and the Alien Tort Claims  Act (ATCA). </div>
