                                                                    </div>

                                <p>I wish I could say <a href="http://www.thecarpetbaggerreport.com/archives/10587.html">The Carpetbagger</a> watched Newt Meet the Press so we didn’t have to, but I too watched Newt’s ramblings and began to wonder if he wanted to repeal the First Amendment.  After Newt blamed the Virginia Tech massacre on Liberalism (he also blamed the Columbine shootings on liberalism), his follow-up was:</p>
<blockquote><p>Well, who has created a situation ethics, essentially, zone of not being willing to talk about any of these things. Let me carry another example. I strongly supported Imus being dismissed, but I also think the very thing he was dismissed for, which is the use of language which is stunningly degrading of women &#8211; the fact, for example, that one of the Halloween costumes this last year was being able to be either a prostitute or a pimp at 10, 11, 12 years of age, buying a costume, and we don’t have any discussion about what’s happened to our culture because while we’re restricting political free speech under McCain-Feingold, we say it’s impossible to restrict vulgar and vicious and anti-human speech. And I would argue that that’s a major component of what’s happened to our culture in the last 40 years.</p></blockquote>
<p>The coverage of the Virginia Tech massacre may have replaced the incessant discussion of Don Imus’s stupid remarks but that does not suggest that Imus’s foul language caused this massacre.  But as I listened to this rambling, I could not help but think two things.  Our politicians face no restrictions on their free speech even when their speech is the sheer stupidity Newt Gingrich is famous for. For example, I’m a liberal and I never asked my daughter to dress up as a prostitute.  So what in God’s name was he saying there?  And is he really suggesting we can pass legislation to curb the language of folks like Don Imus, Rush Limbaugh, and Glenn Beck?  Seriously, I thought it was conservatives who were defending these idiots right to be – well idiots.  </p>
<p>But I have to admit – hearing less of the likes of these idiots and idiots like New Gingrich would be refreshing.  I just don’t want government coercion involved.  Maybe <a href="http://www2.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2007_04/011176.php">Kevin Drum</a> has a better idea:</p>
<blockquote><p>Isn&#8217;t it time to stop inviting a guy who talks like this onto Sunday morning talk shows?</p></blockquote>
<p>Hey CBS and NBC!  You had the good sense to fire Imus.  So why not stop inviting dorks like Newt Gingrich on shows like Meet the Press.  Dead air would be more enlightening than listening to the Newtbot.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>I use a yahoo account to respond to readers.  Sadly, it seems that lately, a lot more spam seems to be making it past yahoo&#8217;s filters and into my inbox.  (I delete the bulk e-mail file without even looking at it.)  </p>
<p>(Note to Hormel&#8230;  in this message, I&#8217;m using spam to refer to junk mail, not the canned meat product that seems to be popular in Hawaii and South Korea.)</p>
<p>Spam for me comes in 3 varieties.  There&#8217;s the so-called Nigerian spam.  There&#8217;s the &#8220;increase your penis/breast size&#8221; spam.  (I&#8217;ve always thought it interesting that one person would get both&#8230;  imagine if one person responded to both&#8230;)  Then there&#8217;s the &#8220;buy this wonder stock&#8221; spam.  (That&#8217;s the order for me &#8211; mostly Nigerian, followed by penis/breast size spam, with just a smattering of stock spam &#8211; presumably for seasoning.)  </p>
<p>We&#8217;ve all heard of some fool that responds to the Nigerian spam and is taken for tens of thousands of dollars.  But by now I can&#8217;t imagine there are that many uninformed people out there that its worth coming up with a new message every so often plus trying to find ways to defeat spam filters.  Maybe I&#8217;m wrong about that, and this is still an ongoing business for some Nigerians.  Or maybe its viewed kind of like a lotto ticket in Nigeria and in big penis/breast land?  A lot of people play the lotto, but few hope to win.  </p>
<p>One thing that favors the latter hypothesis&#8230; pay is probably pretty low in Nigeria, so the cost of lost time may not be that high.  Also, the costs are probably pretty low.  But still, these costs can&#8217;t be zero, especially given yahoo&#8217;s and google&#8217;s and every other provider&#8217;s efforts to defeat spam.</p>
<p>So what do you think?  Why do we still get spam?</p>

                                <p>I was thumbing through the latest Business Week earlier today and came across an interview with &#8220;presidential hopeful&#8221;, former mayor of NY, Rudy Guiliani.</p>
<p>His stance on Iraq is &#8220;clear, hold and build&#8221;.</p>
<p>Beautiful, catchy phraseology, but not strategy.</p>
<p>Strategy is something like how we can achieve something in Iraq which contributes to the US being a liberal democracy in 2030.  And is the cost of keeping Iraq in our future worth the benefit.</p>
<p>Rudy says nothing about  vision for an end state in Iraq.</p>
<p>He states we should clear the place, I do not know if he means depopulate the place or move them all to concentration camps, but &#8220;clearing&#8221; is a tactic.  He does not state what it does in the context of a set of broader objectives.</p>
<p>The next groundless tactic is &#8220;hold&#8221;.  This is easy if you just depopulated the place.</p>
<p>Finally, &#8220;rebuild&#8221; the place.  Okay, this is good for Halliburton, like the other tactics are good for expending money on weapons which yield no effects, but what do we build to?</p>
<p>The opposition set of tactics is to &#8220;cut and run&#8221;.  I can see the strategic value of saving lives and money.</p>
<p>We need to ask each candidate what exactly they propose to do and how it leads to a better future for the US.</p>
<p>Leave the catchy phrases at home.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>This post was triggered by a comment in one of my healthcare missives.</p>
<p>My career has been a little weird, including 18 years at a college lecturer (accounting and taxation). This has been great, I get to spend time with young people, have full access to great libraries, and don’t have to worry much about administrative crapola. (I do not have a PhD, and crapola is not a real academic term!)</p>
<p>I tend to look at everything through a consulting prism, and observe my surrounding while I teach. So the question becomes…</p>
<p><strong>Why do so many people earn PhDs in fields where getting a career job is so difficult?</p>
<p></strong>This year a new Ph.D. in accounting from an AACSB school will get at least 5 jobs offers, if they bother to interview that many times. Starting salary with stipends and summer teaching, maybe $110,000 &#8211; $180,000. There is a severe shortage.</p>
<p>A new Ph.D. in English lit will face an ugly job market, for about the 20th year in a row. Many will fall into adjunct purgatory. The pay is just awful.</p>
<p>I don’t know the market for economics PhDs all that well, other than there is a very small and elite market and then everyone else, I think.</p>
<p>So why do people do it? Why a PhD in lit or history when there is no job at the other end?</p>
<p>I think it is for the love of the discipline, a noble objective. Is it economically irrational? I can guarantee that studying English lit is more fun than earning an accounting doctorate, but is there a payoff?</p>
<p>I can understand loving a discipline, I love literature and history and if there hadn’t been a glut many years ago I might have been a historian. It bothers me that I will never write a thesis or dissertation in history. I am jealous of people who write books I wanted to write (currently a book on the Dustbowl). I want to be Dumas Malone when I grow up (check Google).</p>
<p><strong>Conspiracy theory:</strong> universities have too many Ph.D. programs in some fields because they need a cheap supply of teaching assistants, thus the plethora of English doctorate programs.</p>
<p>So what do all of you smart folks think about this? Can this market smooth out, of will it always be out-of-whack?</p>

                                <p><a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2007/04/what_caused_the.html">Mark Thoma</a> treats us to a debate between <a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/review/05/03/part2/Meltzer.pdf">Allan Metzler</a> and <a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/review/05/03/part2/Romer.pdf">Christina Romer</a> on the Origins of the Great Inflation.  Metzler’s opening is a nice summary:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Great Inflation from 1965 to 1984 is the climactic monetary event of the last part of the 20th century. This paper analyzes why it started and why it continued for many years. Like others, it attributes the start of inflation to analytic errors, particularly the widespread acceptance of the simple Keynesian model with its implication that monetary and fiscal policy should be coordinated. In practice, that meant that the Federal Reserve financed a large part of the fiscal deficit. This paper gives a large role to political decision making. Continuation of inflation depended on political choices, analytic errors, and the entrenched belief that inflation would continue.</p></blockquote>
<p>Both of them properly note that the excess fiscal stimulus during the late 1960’s combined with the monetary accommodation of this stimulus was the cause of the acceleration of inflation.  Romer attributes this policy mistake to an Ideas Hypothesis aka a “misguided economic framework”, which means the supposed Keynesian view put forth by Bruce Bartlett.  Mark has extensively covered the <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2007/04/the_benefits_of.html">blog debate</a> as to what Keynesians supposedly believed versus what supply-siders alleged contributed.  Rather than rehash this debate, let me humbly suggest that Metzler’s political hypothesis has a lot of merit.  As a backdrop, let me echo what <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2007/04/how_supplyside_.html">Brad DeLong</a> said with respect to policy making during the Reagan Administration: </p>
<blockquote><p>But in practice&#8230; it seemed to me that Bruce&#8217;s political masters like Jack Kemp were excessively eager to throw the &#8220;budget in balance or surplus on average over the business cycle,&#8221; and that the eager embrace of deficits and their crowding-out of investment did more harm than the focus on reducing marginal tax rates did good.</p></blockquote>
<p>I suspect Bruce agrees with this statement.  His version of supply-side economics does not promise the free lunch version that folks like Jack Kemp and Art Laffer hype.  In Bruce’s version, reducing marginal tax rates in a fiscally neutral fashion could encourage more savings.  But fiscal neutrality either requires some other tax rate has to go up or government spending has to go down.  Alas, the modern version of the Republican Party – which dates back to the Reagan years – do not wish to face the tough decisions.  So they promise lower tax rates for everyone without any significant reductions in government spending.  How did this play out during the Reagan-Bush41 years?  The record clearly shows the fiscal stimulus lead to less national savings and a reduction in the long-term growth rate.  While we can blame Kemp and Laffer with their serial dishonesty about the aftermath of the Reagan fiscal fiasco, this should not indict the views of sensible supply-siders like Bruce.</p>
<p>Fairness requires that we look at the advise given by the Council of Economic Advisors to President Johnson at the advent of the Great Inflation. In a way, Bruce Bartlett did me a bit of a favor by emailing me after he saw <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/04/jfk-explains-his-tax-cut-but-did-greg.html">this post</a> of President Kennedy making a Keynesian case of the tax cut ultimately signed by President Johnson in 1964.  Bruce was trying to make the case that the 1964 tax cut was not done for Keynesian reasons – an odd claim in my opinion.  Bruce mentions two other people that were very important in the policy deliberations starting around 1966: Wilbur Mills who chaired the House Ways &#038; Means Committee and Norman Ture – an advisor to Congressman Mills and the mentor for most supply-siders.  While supply-siders love to praise JFK for the tax cut that LBJ signed in 1964, they tend to omit what really happened during the rest of the decade.  Sure the tax cut seemed like a great success through 1964 and 1965 with real GDP being 5.8% in 1964 and 6.4% in 1965 and the unemployment rate dropping from 5.5% in December 1963 to 4.0% in December 1965.</p>
<p>But we should recall the meeting that the CEA had with President Johnson during December 1965 where they expressed grave concern with a triple-whammy fiscal stimulus – the tax cut, the increase in transfer payments from the Great Society programs and the increase in defense purchases from the escalation of our involvement in the Vietnam War.  They warned LBJ that if this excessive fiscal stimulus was not reversed, the Federal Reserve would face the Faustian choice of raising interest rates (and crowding out investment) or watching inflation accelerate.   While some rightwing critics of this Keynesian CEA claim they wanted a bigger government, this claim is highly unfair.  The CEA suggested to the President that he curb government spending.  LBJ rejected this advice as the War on Poverty was to be his political legacy and he still had the naïve view that Vietnam was winnable.  Sort of sounds like George W. Bush with his Iraq War, prescription drug benefit, and his zeal for tax cuts – doesn’t it?  </p>
<p>But to be fair to LBJ, he did listen to the CEA about reversing the 1964 tax cut.  Of course, he gave the CEA a stern lecture about how this tax cut helped the Democrats during the 1964 election and that reversing it would be political suicide.  The economists on the CEA were not impressed so LBJ agreed to discuss this with Chairman Mills.  But here is where some really bad advice reared its ugly head.  Norman Ture told his client that the CEA was crazy and the U.S. economy had plenty of room to grow.  Ture was as wrong as the village idiots at the National Review such as Lawrence Kudlow, but we never here this from the supply-side crowd.  </p>
<p>Real GDP grew by 6.5% in 1966 and inflation did accelerate.  But to its credit, the Federal Reserve did increase interest rates in 1966 causing the 1966 Credit Crunch.  Funny – we never hear about this from the supply-siders.  But why should they bother to admit that fiscal stimulus crowds out investment?  Intellectual honesty gets in the way of their religion.  In 1967, real GDP grew by only 2.5% and inflation moderated.  But as Christina Romer notes, the Federal Reserve did not adhere to this tight monetary policy regime – in part because LBJ was quite unhappy with high interest rates.  Of course, his own CEA had told the President that the Federal Reserve should have implemented tight money.  But who do the supply-siders blame for this mix of expansionary fiscal policy and easy money that resulting in the Great Inflation.  While they should give joint blame to the politicians and to their mentor, they don’t.  They blame the Council of Economic Advisors.  Excuse me for saying this – but their attempts to shift blame are the height of intellectual dishonesty.</p>
<p>While we have covered the after-math of the 1964 tax cut and Brad covers the fiscal fiasco of the Reagan years – both episodes pointing out that fiscal stimulus does indeed lower national savings – and if sustained would reduce long-term growth, the current policy debate centers on the desire of certain Republicans (including alas that hack we call President) of making the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts permanent. Now Bruce Bartlett may wish we paid for these tax cuts with a much smaller government, we all know that the modern Republican Party doesn’t even have the courage to advocate a truly small government agenda.  And we also know that no respectable economist – be (s)he classical or Keynesian can deny the reality that the long-run impact of sustained fiscal stimulus is to reduce savings and reduce long-term growth.  There is no debate on this truism among serious economists – just the abuse of the nuances we struggle with by our political masters and pseudo economists like Lawrence Kudlow to push upon us absurd agendas that have nothing to do with pro-growth policies.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2007/04/what_caused_the.html">Brad DeLong</a> goes with the Ideas Hypothesis:</p>
<blockquote><p>The one amendment to Romer&#8217;s analysis I would make would be to point out that Arthur Burns&#8217;s view that inflation was relatively unresponsive to unemployment can be traced back to his 1959 Presidential Address to the American Economic Association.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_FkNl3j2hoNg/RitqIAsQpZI/AAAAAAAAAFQ/8Vl4Ha0sXL8/s1600-h/a1.png"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_FkNl3j2hoNg/RitqIAsQpZI/AAAAAAAAAFQ/8Vl4Ha0sXL8/s400/a1.png" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>We have graphed the Federal Funds rate from 1959 to 1979 as I have a few questions about Brad’s comment.  Is he saying the FED did not worry about demand-pull inflation?  Then why did it ever raise interest rates?  Why not lower interest rates even more – if the FED really believed this?  Or was it only the Burns FED – which began in 1970 – that believed this?  It is true that the FED pursued expansionary monetary policies in the lead-up to the 1972 campaign.  But I always thought that this was driven by political pressure from Richard Nixon who blamed the tight monetary policies in 1960 for his loss to John Kennedy.  And notice that the FED pursued tight monetary policies as part of Gerald Ford’s misguided Whip Inflation Now episode, which led to the 1974 recession.  Of course, I let this graph go through 1979 to get my digs into the Volcker FED for round II of excessively tight monetary policies, which led to the Carter recession and the election of spend and borrow Ronald Reagan.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Jim Talent  at NRO 19 Apr 07:</p>
<p>Talent in response to Time magazine article on the breaking of the US Army:</p>
<p>“The problem with America’s military is not that the Navy and Air Force got too much money (that is not true) or that the services have bought too much high tech equipment (they actually haven’t bought nearly enough).”</p>
<p>Talent states that there has been systematic underfunding since Clinton took office.<br />This is patently false.  Clinton took office in 1993 two years after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.  That precipitated a real opportunity to demobilize.  200 divisions and 40,000 tanks, and 10,000 fighter aircraft were no longer breathing down our necks in Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>Clinton had every reason to take a holiday from wasteful spending on the military. </p>
<p>Regarding Clinton Defense Budgets Talent states:  “It cut modernization budgets and bought anywhere from 50-90 percent fewer “platforms” — ships, planes, and vehicles — than the military needed to maintain its capital stock.”</p>
<p>What is the strategic significance of &#8220;maintaining capital stock&#8221; when there is no enemy?</p>
<p>Later:  “Instead, this year the government is funding the regular military budget (not counting day-to-day war expenses) at 3.3 percent of GDP, a very low level historically.”</p>
<p>It is misleading to think we should be spending the same amount of our GDP on military equipment when our enemy has no economic base.  GDP is never a measure.  Besides the rest of the world spend much smaller percents of their national demand.</p>
<p>Look at the other allies, also closer to 1% of their GDP.</p>
<p>So what should have been bought in the mid nineties?  The F-22 was planned to be bought but it was failing all its tests and reasonably was delayed it.  The MV-22 was also failing and delayed for cause.  B-2 essentially lost its mission when the Soviet Union faded away.  I suspect that B-2 also failed enough tests that it was stopped at 20 aircraft because it could not do the proposed mission had it continued to exist.</p>
<p>The Navy no longer needed ships to keep the sea-lane open against the Red Navy.  There remains no high seas threat so the Navy is building a brown water mission area to keep buying ships.</p>
<p>The world situation today as in 1993 does not demand more money for high tech gear.  The enemy is the hearts and minds of Islam.</p>
<p>None of which is intimidated by huge defense budgets.</p>
<p>There are no operational needs for the size of the Air Force and Navy we now sustain.</p>
<p>Time magazine is right Talent is wrong.  But his bread is buttered by defense industry PAC’s</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Today, The World Organization for Human Rights USA file suit against Yahoo! Inc and its subsidiaries for the U.S. Internet company’s complicity in human rights abuses and acts of torture in China. For the text of the complaint, see <a href="http://www.humanrightsusa.org/modules.php?op=modload&#038;name=UpDownload&#038;file=index&#038;req=getit&#038;lid=39">here</a>.</p>
<p>General Facts:</p>
<blockquote><p>Journalists, human rights activists, and other Internet users in China have been subjected to a pattern of arbitrary criminal prosecution, imprisonment, and torture as a result of their expression of ideas in opposition to the positions or policies of the government of the PRC on a variety of politically disfavored topics, such as the Tiananmen Square massacre, democratic reform, human rights advocacy, or disagreement with government policies generally. As a result of the expression of their views, these “dissidents” are subjected to arbitrary arrest, criminal prosecution, and persecution in violation of numerous protections for fundamental rights of freedom of expression, association, and assembly under the Chinese Constitution and international law.</p>
<p>In or around the Spring of 2002, Yahoo! Inc. signed an official, voluntary<br />agreement that had the effect of directly involving Yahoo! in the censoring and monitoring of on-line content and communication by its Chinese users. This agreement was in the form of the Internet Society of China’s &#8220;Public Pledge on Self-Discipline for the Chinese Internet Industry&#8221; (referred to herein as “the Public Pledge”). The Internet Society of China is a government affiliated professional organization, and the Public Pledge is described as being voluntary, not required by government regulation, although pressures to sign the Pledge and to abide by its requirements as a prerequisite for doing business in China are considerable. By signing the Public Pledge, Yahoo! Inc. voluntarily agreed to help monitor and censor electronic communication use involving information that, according to the Internet Society of China, could “jeopardize state security” or “disrupt social stability,” and to report any offending on-line expression or communication to PRC authorities.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Complaint asserts that Yahoo! cannot claim innocence, for it knew of the possible consequences when it signed the Pledge. “A number of human rights” organization had alerted Yahoo! of the consequences. Yahoo! also had to be aware that the State Department was concerned about human rights abuses in China.</p>
<p>The plaintiff, Wang Xiaoning, did the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Edited and commented on articles calling for democratic reform and a multi-party system in China</li>
<li>Continued to send Internet messages after administrators blocked his access to the “aaabbbccc” Yahoo! Group. He then sent his journal anonymously to individuals.</li>
<p></ul>
<p>Yahoo!, of course, providing all the information to the police, “linking Wang Xiaoning to his anonymous e-mails and other pro-democracy Internet communications.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, of course, Yahoo! will have its defenders as well as its sturdy detractors for choosing profit over human rights. After all, Wang is one individual. Yahoo! is in a battle for its corporate life, affecting far more than one individual. And China is the great playing field upon which all our corporations are moving.</p>
<p>But I want to twist the line of questioning a bit, focusing on economic and WTO principles. A market is considered open and free when all participants operate according to the same rules. In a profound sense, Yahoo! is simply operating on a level playing field. Any of its competitors, Chinese or foreign, would have the same playing field: Certain discussion of multi-party reform and democracy are illegal and must be reported. That reporting may well lead to torture and imprisonment.</p>
<p>On the Charlie Rose show last night , Secretary Paulson asserted that China would inevitably democratize. Open capital markets will accomplish precisely that. Richer people demand more freedom, more equality. Ah, but some are more equal than others.</p>
<p>I would counter that as long as all firms in China play by the same rules, WTO rules are met; a “free market economy” can exist. In short, there is no ideological conflict between “free markets” and totalitarianism.</p>
<p>I would posit that China’s leaders would argue that the conflict between capitalism and totalitarianism is illusory. They would argue that if they are successful in terms of industrializing China then that success would prove their point. Nothing like success to make one’s point. After all, China’s leaders are practical folk.</p>
<p>In short, the argument is between the belief that open markets lead to democracy and the assertion that free markets and totalitarianism are not incompatible.</p>
<p>Personally? I suspect that the two are not incompatible. One supplies the economic muscle; the other optimizes control in order to increase the muscle mass. The close tie between corporate power and government in the states might serve to make my point?</p>
<p>In any case, the argument is a complex one. One thing is for sure: History will write the answer.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Somewhere, in storage, I have Ernie Pyle&#8217;s books about his experience in World War 2. One of them has its dedication the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>In solemn solute to those thousands of our comrades &#8211; great, brave men that they were &#8211; for whom there will be no homecoming, ever. </p></blockquote>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p>Apparently Harry Reid&#8217;s comments that the war is lost at this point have generated a lot of <a href="http://www.thecarpetbaggerreport.com/archives/10574.html">angry attacks from folks on the right</a>. Funny thing is that most of these people insisted for years that the war was won, and later that it was getting better, and now that the surge is the last chance. Even their own statements about what is going on show a steady worsening of the situation and a failure of their predictions.</p>
<p>TBogg notes that Michelle Malkin has been soliciting (critical) e-mail from service personnel about Reid&#8217;s comments. His post provides <a href="http://tbogg.blogspot.com/2007/04/they-dont-write-letters-because-they.html">a list</a> of American personnel killed in Iraq so far this month. </p>
<p>One of his readers (comsympinko) makes an amazing observation:</p>
<blockquote><p>Only one officer.</p>
<p>This is truly a colonial war, the savagery committed to the memory of the nation in every house of god in the Western Hemisphere.</p>
<p>The lists of the colonial war dead in European cathedrals are long and undistinguished.</p>
<p>Maybe a general, likely a colonel, a few junior officers and hundreds upon hundreds of enlisted men.</p>
<p>What is striking above all else is the proportion of the dead killed by disease.</p>
<p>I fear the lethal combination of dubious vaccinations and anti-WMD medications, depleted uranium, and PTSD will fill our own lists with our hundreds and hundreds of the diseased enlisted dead.</p>
<p>The officers who led them to their certain doom will escape unscathed once again.</p></blockquote>
<p>Regular readers may recall I&#8217;ve had a post showing that <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/09/military-deaths-and-competence.html">military deaths due to illness and accident have been rising under GW</a>, after falling since data first became available. Data on military death rates are <a href="http://siadapp.dior.whs.mil/personnel/CASUALTY/Death_Rates1.pdf">here</a>.)</p>
<p>Otherwise, I think comsympinko is right, sadly. This is just another colonial war. I&#8217;ve noted in earlier posts&#8230; enlisted military personnel, those that are not officers, are woefully underpaid, except relative to menial and fast-food jobs. Enlisted personnel are those that fight and die. They are fed on a diet of patriotism, misinformation, and <a href="http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003571876">ignorance</a> and sent to fight and die by people that aren&#8217;t making similar sacrifices themselves. And when someone questions whether their sacrifice in a cause that, at the very least, isn&#8217;t progressing, is worth it, well, that&#8217;s cause for the couch warriors to rise up.</p>
<p>And so, what we will continue to see is death. Iraqis will die in the thousands and hundreds of thousands. It may even be too late to stop that no matter what course of action the administration takes going forward. But it is not to late to do something for those great, brave enlisted men and women in the US military.  They should have their homecoming.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p>Correction.  Reader Movie Guy indicates that something I originally wrote, is wrong, namely:</p>
<p>&#8220;Someone who gets sick in Iraq gets evacuated. If he/she dies in Germany, well, he/she is not considered part of the Iraq War dead.&#8221;</p>
<p>I have since removed that phrase.  Which raises a question.  Does anyone have a link to an official DoD list of OIF dead by cause of death?  (i.e., not something run by some third party)  I&#8217;ve been rummaging around the .mil domain and every such link I come to is inactive.</p>

                                <p>So the FBI raided Representative John Doolittle&#8217;s home yesterday.  Today, a business belonging to Representative Rick Renzi.  Maybe with a Congress that doesn&#8217;t coddle criminals, we might see more of this.  Here&#8217;s hoping Pombo, Jerry Lewis, and that clown from Louisiana with $90K in his freezer get attention from the FBI some time soon too.  I doubt any of these names would surprise anyone on Capitol Hill.</p>
<p>That would be a good starting point.  I&#8217;m cautiously optimistic.  </p>
<p>(I personally would love to see every congresscritter who has a family-member that&#8217;s a lobbyist looked at, regardless of party, but that&#8217;s just a crazy dream given the number of congresscritters with those ties.)</p>
