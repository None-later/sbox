<p> Lew&#8217;s Senate Finance hearing as Treasury Nominee</p>
<p> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Lew">Jack Lew</a>, former budget director under Clinton and Obama and former Obama chief of staff, answered questions at Senate Finance today in his bid to succeed Tim Geithner as Treasury Secretary.  See, e.g., Rubin &#038; Klimasinska, Lew Says He Didn&#8217;t Know Money-Losing Investment Was in Caymans, Bloomberg.com (Feb. 13, 2013) and other related articles linked below.</p>
<p>When he was first nominated, I noted that I found his candidacy somewhat worrisome.  While there are a number of considerations that suggest a decently competent person, there are also some suggestions of a person who has lived in the &#8220;Wall Street&#8221; flow too long and thus falls into line with the typical Wall Street/mainstream economics thinking&#8211;thinking which ultimately supports policies that will continue to slide towards oligarchy.</p>
<p>The hearing focused on several interesting aspects of Lew&#8217;s career and investment choices.</p>
<p>1) Investing in the Caymans.  Lew made an investment of 50 to 100 thousand in a Citigroup fund based in theCaymans while he was at Citigroup, and claimed that he didn&#8217;t know it was an offshore investment.  He got out of it when he went into government and lost money on it. </p>
<p> ME:  There we have it&#8211;like most rich people, he just didn&#8217;t care enough to consider closely whehter his investment was in a tax haven country and certainly didn&#8217;t ponder the negatives .</p>
<p>2) Compensation at Citigroup.  Lew got a &#8220;bonus&#8221; of $940,000 in January 2009 when Citigroup was receiving federal bailout funds.  He defended it as being paid in the same way other private-sector employees in similar jobs were paid. </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>ME:  But there was a ridiculous racheting up of financial sector compensation during the years when the big banks were feeding at the trough of easy mortgage securitization money and derivative speculation.  Shouldn&#8217;t someone that we hire as the head of Treasury have been more aware of that speculative binge?    Or shouldn&#8217;t that person be at least somewhat ashamed now that such an exorbitant &#8220;bonus&#8221; (10 times what most Americans receive in annual pay) should have been funded, in essential part, by taxpayer bailouts of his institution?</p>
<p>Now, Orrin Hatch (GOP-Utah) tried to make a big deal out of Lew overseeing the <a href="http://treasury.gov/fsoc">Financial Stability Oversight Council</a> in administering the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcker_Rule">Volcker Rule</a>limiting proprietary trading, saying that &#8220;it could lead to an awkward situation in which, in your role as chair of the FSOC, you would effectively be saying to financial firms: &#8216;Do as I say, not as I did.&#8217; &#8221;  Hatch claimed that this issue &#8220;bear[s] directly on your qualifications.&#8221;  I&#8217;m not so sure that is such a big worry since I think it is advantageous if Treasury has some understanding of how big banks trade, but it is just one more piece of Lew&#8217;s overall nature of being well-attuned to Wall Street (and not so well-attuned to Main Street).<br />  <br />3)  Corporate taxes.  Lew suggested in the hearing that Republicans and Democrats could &#8220;work together&#8221; so that changes in the international tax scheme could lead to lighter burdens on some foreign income of US multinationals.  The Bloomberg report notes that he supported a global minimum tax, but indicated that could be nominally territorial, with limits on offshoring income to tax haven countries. </p>
<p>4) Earned benefit programs.  Lew is one of those Democrats who is more right of center than the party&#8217;s base.  He still mentions the need for &#8220;entitlement&#8221; program changes as well as additional revenue increases as a part of &#8220;balanced&#8221; deficit reduction.</p>
<p>ME:  This is one of the most disturbing aspects of the Lew nomination.  He is pushing the GOP agenda of deficit reduction and &#8220;entitlement&#8221; reform when instead he should be staunchly defending the New Deal against the oligarchs who want to shrink government, diminish the safety net, end any support for innovative environmental and energy progrms, yet continue to reap benefits from the long-term government subsidies for Big Oil&#8230;..We should not tamper with Social Security&#8211;and there is no deficit reason for doing so. </p>

                                <p>
<div dir="ltr">Mr. President, I still live in the same working-class neighborhood I grew up in. My neighbors aren’t millionaires. They’re retirees who depend on Social Security and Medicare. They’re workers who have to get up early tomorrow morning and go to work to pay the bills. They’re immigrants, who came here because they were stuck in poverty in countries where the government dominated the economy.</div>
<div dir="ltr">&#8212; Marco Rubio, last night. </div>
<p>I lifted that quote from <a href="http://dyn.politico.com/printstory.cfm?uuid=6A9DCC73-62AF-402E-9EED-3F327BE18F7B">a Politico article by Jonathan Martin</a> that went on to say that Rubio left school with more than $100,000 in student-loan debt, which he finished paying off only a few months ago. Presumably, those loans were government-sponsored.  Although maybe at the age of 18, he had some collateral to offer the bank.</p>
<p>Rubio’s parents, like so many of his working-class neighbors now, emigrated from Cuba before 2001, when the first of the two sets of Bush tax cuts were passed.  Apparently, he hasn’t checked the federal income tax rates on individuals and corporations when his parents and his neighbors came here because they were stuck in poverty in countries where the government dominated the economy.  Because, best as I can tell, that comment about immigrants from countries where the government dominated the economy was intended as a warning about Obama’s and the congressional Democrats’ plans to have the government dominate the economy.  </p>
<p>So I’d like some specifics.  What policies and programs, current and proposed, does he have in mind?  Exactly?  Maybe next time he’s interviewed by some high-profile journalist, he’ll be asked that.  And maybe he’ll answer.  But I doubt it.</p>
<p>Anyway, for now, I’m left to speculate that he means raising tax rates to Clinton-era tax levels for people with non-investment incomes above $250,000 a year, and on corporations, and on investment income.  He also might mean Obamacare, but that’s questionable unless he thinks that only people who qualify for Medicare get cancer or other serious illnesses, because he also said this last night:</p>
<div dir="ltr">[Medicare] provided my father the care he needed to battle cancer and ultimately die with dignity.  And it pays for the care my mother receives now.</div>
<p>But the title of this post suggests that Rubio travel more.  Both within this country and outside of it.  First he should visit communities where immigrants from, say, Pakistan and Central America live.  People who came here to escape poverty but whose homeland governments did not, and do not, dominate the economy.*  </p>
<p>Then, if he has a passport, he might consider traveling outside the United States.  Maybe to Canada, or Germany, or Sweden, or Holland, or Australia.  Or France. Or, for that matter, Singapore.  Or Taiwan.  Or he could save the plane fare and just use the Internet to check the rates of poverty in those countries, the tax rates there, the social safety nets there, the education systems there, the healthcare systems there. </p>
<p>I didn’t watch the Rubio Show last night, so I missed the reaching-for-a-water-bottle-but-wishing-it-were-a-Vodka-bottle-instead moment.  I wish I’d watched, but I didn’t.  So I’m relying on tidbits reported by others.  And <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/02/13/marco-rubio-has-learned-nothing/">Paul Krugman provides one</a> that, unlike the quotes above, have not garnered much attention.  It’s this:</p>
<div dir="ltr">This idea – that our problems were caused by a government that was too small – it’s just not true. In fact, a major cause of our recent downturn was a housing crisis created by reckless government policies.</div>
<p>Krugman points out that numerous studies, as well as observation by, say, ordinary folks, dispel that claim. Specifically, Krugman writes:<br /><a name="more"></a>
<div dir="ltr">OK, leave on one side the caricature of Obama, with the usual mirror-image fallacy (we want smaller government, therefore liberals just want bigger government, never mind what it does); there we go with the “Barney Frank did it” story. Deregulation, the explosive growth of virtually unregulated shadow banking, lax lending standards by loan originators who sold their loans off as soon as they were made, had nothing to do with it — it was all the Community Reinvestment Act, Fannie, and Freddie.</div>
<div dir="ltr">Look, this is one of the most thoroughly researched topics out there, and every piece of the government-did-it thesis has been refuted; see <a href="http://rortybomb.wordpress.com/2011/11/01/bloombergs-awful-comment-what-can-we-say-for-certain-regarding-the-gses/">Mike Konczal for a summary.</a> No, the CRA wasn’t responsible for the epidemic of bad lending; no, Fannie and Freddie didn’t cause the housing bubble; no, the “high-risk” loans of the GSEs weren’t remotely as risky as subprime.</div>
<p>So I guess I was wrong when I said above that Rubio must have had only tax rates and Obamacare in mind.  He apparently also had finance-industry regulation in mind, too. And on this he was specific. </p>
<p>But on this too, I suggest some overseas travel&#8211;either physically, or virtually, on the Internet. He&#8217;d learn that Spain, Ireland and Iceland must have had a Fannie Mae and a Freddie Mac. Not to mention a Barney Frank. Because those countries’ current and recent fiscal and economic woes were caused entirely by a housing bubbles virtually identical to, or worse than, ours, spurred by Deregulation, the explosive growth of virtually unregulated shadow banking, lax lending standards by loan originators who sold their loans off as soon as they were made. </p>
<p>Then Rubio might consider returning to Canada and Germany, physically or virtually, and checking out why those countries had little or no such bubble.  And before he leaves, or after he returns, he should travel to Texas.  Yes, Texas, of all states.  It had almost no housing bubble.  Something to do with government involvement in the economy, i.e., legislation regulating the mortgage industry, post-savings-and-loan debacle, circa 1989.  State government, in this case. </p>
<p>What is the national debt of Canada and Germany?  And the poverty levels and standards of living in those countries?  </p>
<p>The Politico article, by the way, is called “Marco Rubio as the anti-Romney.”  The title of Krugman’s post indicates disagreement with that assessment. It’s called “Marco Rubio Has Learned Nothing.”  </p>
<p>But a majority of Americans, I think, have.  They’ve learned that you can’t judge a book by it’s jacket cover. And that ideology can’t substitute for fact. 
<div></div>
<div>&#8212;-<br />UPDATE:  Oh, dear. As I said, I didn’t watch Rubio last night.  I also haven’t read a transcript of his speech.  And I didn’t know until just now, when I read Jazzbumpa’s post below, that Rubio said that proposals to deal with climate change, including trying to slow its progression, are attempts to have the government “control the weather.”</p>
<p>Um.  Yeah.  That’s the idea.  </p>
<p>Yikes.</p></div>
<div>Why do I think Chris Christie is the happiest person in America today?</p>
<p>&#8212;-<br />UPDATE II:  I’m getting the strong feeling that there are a lot of people who are downright dumbfounded by that speech last night&#8211;that this guy who’s being touted as the Republican savior went on national television and established himself as stunningly stupid. </p>
<p>We’re going to elect a global warming denier as president in 2016?  We’re going to elect as president someone who is unaware of such things as financial derivatives, and the role they played in the financial meltdown?  We’re going to elect as president someone who seems not to know that student loans and Medicare are government programs&#8211;or at least what it means that they are?  We’re going to elect as president someone who thinks Clinton-era tax rates are a government-dominated economy?</p>
<p>I’ll certainly agree that he’s no Romney.  Romney isn’t stupid, by any stretch.  He just pretended to be.  With Rubio, it’s apparently no act. </p>

                                <p>There are many ways to view the State of the Union address, and perhaps each listener needs to assess how much importance to give to the issues offered for comment.  Most of us are not &#8216;one issue&#8217; deal breaker sorts of people, but the impulse is strong for those issues we care about personally.  How does one sort that out in public?  (update:  here is a <a href="http://www.salon.com/2013/02/13/president_obamas_full_state_of_the_union_address/?source=newsletter">link</a> to the transcript of the prepared speech)</p>
<p>Bill Black has comment on the SOTU speech last night that underscores the probable nature of proposals that will address issues from A to Z, but stresses the fundamental paradox of smaller government intervention which seems to underlie the speech, costing &#8216;not another dime&#8217; and a &#8216;balanced approach&#8217; to program proposals:</p>
<p>1) on infrastructure re-building but not much on who will pay for it, </p>
<p>2) emphasizing education but in the frame of tackling rising tuition rates but with less money federally and no acknowledgement that                     increases are partly due to the loss of state based subsidies, </p>
<p>3) entitlement reform being definitely on the table due to the aging population meme, but without any notion that privately based rate of spending increases on health insurance make private insurance coverage a hot potato for businesses, and the mysterious need to keep Social Security on the table (Bill has a different take on the payroll tax than I support),</p>
<p>4) and of course the knotty problem of mortgage and financial regulation and accountability seems to be missing:</p>
<p>( a raise in the minimum wage, climate change agenda of some kind is on, and dramatically some sort of increased regulation for some guns and ammo were not mentioned by Mr. Black)</p>

                                <p>For the hundredth time the foreign-born Muslim commie Nazi extends an  olive branch across the aisle, and for the hundredth time it&#8217;s dashed  to the floor, stomped on and set ablaze &#8211; along with the latest  spokes-liars trousers.   It became a conflagration that the infamous  water-stop could not staunch.</p>
<p>Early in Marco Rubio&#8217;s  alleged rebuttal to B. Hoover Obama&#8217;s latest exercise in political  theater it became painfully obvious that his pants were on fire.  This  was even before it became obvious that his diatribe was utterly  incoherent.  <a href="http://maddowblog.msnbc.com/_news/2013/02/13/16948495-putting-the-rube-in-rubio?lite">Steve Benen explains</a>.</p>
<blockquote><div>By  any sensible measure, Rubio&#8217;s entire pitch was incoherent gibberish. He  thinks President Obama is hostile to free enterprise and wants to  increase the deficit, neither of which makes any sense. Rubio thinks the  housing crisis was caused by big government, <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/02/13/marco-rubio-has-learned-nothing/?smid=tw-NytimesKrugman&#038;seid=auto">which is simply idiotic</a>.  Rubio celebrates his family&#8217;s history of dependence on government  social programs like student loans and Medicare, while articulating a  policy agenda that guts government social programs like student loans  and Medicare.</div>
<div>Forget  ideology, subjectivity, and areas of opinion &#8212; the fact is Marco  Rubio&#8217;s speech was filled with a series of claims with no meaningful  connection to reality. The senator even thinks combating the climate  crisis means asking government to &#8220;control the weather,&#8221; which is just  genuinely dumb.</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Part  way through I started taking notes, and discovered an unappetizing  platter of rewarmed left-overs [or more accurately: right-overs] of  Romney&#8217;s failed presidential campaign, where <a href="http://jazzbumpa.blogspot.com/2012/10/strategic-lying-as-political-art.html">lying and incoherence were the norm</a>.  It was deja vu all over again. Viz:</p>
<p>Obama&#8217;s obsession with raising taxes<br />Solyndra [God help us &#8211; I am not making this up]<br />We should open Federal lands to energy exploration<br />Grow Energy industry [but not renewables]<br />Lower Corp tax rate [Highest in the world, don&#8217;t cha know]<br />Incentivise school districts<br />Schools of choice<br />Solve the debt problem [As if BHO ignored it &#8211; or, more importantly &#8211; as if it were a real problem]<br />Obama created the debt with excessive spending  [my personal favorite]<br />Need a balanced budget amendment  [the ignorance &#8211; it burns, too]<br />Obama&#8217;s in favor of leaving Medicare just the way it is [though he clearly stated otherwise]<br />He also wants to unconstitutionally undermine 2nd amendment rights<br />The President&#8217;s devastating cuts to our military [Seriously &#8212; WTH?!?]<br />Moral breakdown in society &#8211; need more faith<br />Economic liberty</p>
<p>That&#8217;s  what I was able to capture as Rubio&#8217;s litany of [mostly] decades old  Republican clap-trap spewed forth almost faster than I could record it.</p>
<p>One  of the MSNBC commentators pointed out that this nonsense wasn&#8217;t  directed to the American public, who I hope are beginning to see through  the smoke screen, but to the hard-core right-wing base.  As such, it&#8217;s  Rubio&#8217;s first gambit in his run for the 2016 presidential nomination.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if I should laugh, cry, or drink myself into a stupor.</p>

                                <p>
<div dir="ltr">The State of the Union ritual is by now familiar to most Americans. President Obama leads the Democratic side of the chamber to a series of standing ovations for proposals that everybody knows won’t become law. Republicans show their seriousness of purpose by smirking or making stony faces — and by inviting as guests to the speech people such as <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/reliable-source/post/ted-nugent-attending-state-of-the-union-address/2013/02/11/2b868238-749f-11e2-95e4-6148e45d7adb_blog.html">rocker Ted Nugent</a>, who has called the president a “piece of [excrement]” who should “suck on my machine gun.”</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">But this spectacle, unlike [Mardi Gras], is not all harmless fun. Obama made clear that he is not entertaining serious spending cuts or major entitlement reforms. Republicans, in their responses, repeated that they are not budging on taxes. The hard choices will have to wait for another day.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">The standoff gives new meaning to Fat Tuesday: The nation’s finances are a mess, but — what the heck? — let’s have another round. No wonder a new Washington Post poll found that <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2013/02/12/obama-faces-deeply-divided-nation-in-state-of-the-union-address/">56 percent of Americans</a> have a dim view of the country’s political system.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">&#8212; <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/dana-milbank-state-of-the-union-and-mardi-gras--what-a-coincidence/2013/02/12/105119ee-7560-11e2-aa12-e6cf1d31106b_story.html?hpid=z2">Let the bleak times roll</a>, Dana Milbank, Washington Post, today</div>
<p>Yup.  Fifty-six percent of Americans want another deep recession.  Now!  Our nation’s finances are a mess.  And they want to see them become messier!  And they want a few million hungry or homeless elderly. Not necessarily now.  But soon.</p>
<p>The luxury of being a Centrist, at least one of this particular and common variety, is that you can spout generic truisms without ever actually tying them to specifics.  Much less to basic economics principles. Milbank’s column is so replete with unsupported and in fact completely unexplained inferences&#8211;declaratory clauses and sentences each made in its own little vacuum but offered as though dependent upon one another&#8211;that Milbank’s heard somewhere, that I wondered as I read this thing whether he’d brought his MacBook Air to a <a href="http://www.uline.com/Grp_316/Plastic-Retail-Food-Bags?pricode=WL25&#038;gclid=CPSNs8rBs7UCFZE-MgodmS8Axw">Uline</a> plant to watch the speech last night. I mean, how else to explain this?:</p>
<div dir="ltr">Early in his address, Obama pronounced himself “more than halfway towards the goal of $4 trillion in deficit reduction that economists say we need to stabilize our finances.” He blithely proclaimed that the rest of the job could be done by making “modest reforms” to Medicare and “getting rid of tax loopholes and deductions for the well-off.”</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">He didn’t mention that this would leave the country with a historically high debt level — and would be but a temporary fix before health-care costs explode in a decade. Departing from his prepared text, Obama challenged the idea that “deficit reduction is a big emergency, justifying making cuts in Social Security.” </div>
<p>Oh, horrors. After all, deficit reduction is a big emergency. And a historically high debt level&#8211;irrespective of the specifics, such as how high that debt level is relative to GDP&#8211;will crash the economy.  Just like the historically high debt levels did at the end of World War II. </p>
<p>“Washington’s version of Mardi Gras had begun early in the day, at the Capitol South Metro station, where members of a nonpartisan balanced-budget group, Bankrupting America, offered beads to passersby willing to ‘show us your cuts,’” Milbank writes. “By that standard, few necklaces would be distributed. Democrats and Republicans alike would sooner bare their private parts than come clean about what government programs they would cut.”  True enough.</p>
<p>But then, this:</p>
<div dir="ltr">Even [Paul] Ryan, who is drafting a budget that could slash domestic discretionary spending by 40 percent over a decade, doesn’t like to be specific. </div>
<p>Even Paul Ryan doesn’t like to be specific about cuts that would slash domestic spending by 40 percent over decade?  Even Paul Ryan?  You don’t say!</p>
<p>And then, of course:</p>
<div dir="ltr">And House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi says, “<a href="http://foxnewsinsider.com/2013/02/10/nancy-pelosi-says-the-spending-problem-is-a-false-argument/">It is almost a false argument to say we have a spending problem</a>.”</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">Pelosi’s formulation is just as reckless as the Republicans’ mantra: “We don’t have a revenue problem; we have a spending problem.”</div>
<p>Of course. Which is why, pre-Bush-tax-cuts, and pre-Bush-unfunded-wars, we didn’t have a spending problem. Now we do, so let’s cut Social Security!  Canada, Germany, Australia and Holland must also have spending problems.  After all, they have extensive social safety-net programs, and high standards of living.</p>
<p>Milbank ends by saying, “In reality, we eventually need both spending cuts and tax increases — and lots of them. But sacrifice will have to wait. In Washington, they’re still partying like there’s no tomorrow.”</p>
<p>No, actually, the Democrats are partying like there is a tomorrow.  There&#8217;s real, if unwitting, irony in the headline writer&#8217;s choice of a heading for Milbank&#8217;s column.  Although&#8211;who knows?&#8211;maybe the headline writer actually is familiar with Keynesian economics. </p>

<p>Let the Wars Start&#8211;only when we are willing to pay for them</p>
<p>The op-ed page of the New York Times often has some thoughtful items worth reading.  Russell Rumbaugh&#8217;s <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/11/opinion/a-tax-to-pay-for-war.html">A Tax to Pay for War</a>, New York Times (Feb. 11, 2013), at A17 is one of them.  As Rumbaugh notes, the slight delcine in military spending since 2009 has provided some breathing room on solving the fiscal crisis, but that breathing room could quickly vanish if we undertake new military interventions.  As he notes:<br />
<blockquote>[W]ar spending&#8211;like all government spending&#8211;wrecks public finances only when more money is spent than is brought in.  &#8230;Three years ago, the Senate Budget Committee adopted a bipartisan amendment requirement that wars be paid for.  &#8230;[But] none of these proposals resolved the question of whether to pay for future wars through spending cuts or raising more revenue.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Rumbaugh urges that we &#8220;make a choice and require a tax surcharge to pay for any military operation.&#8221; </p>
<p>He offers three primary rationales for instituting a war surcharge: </p>
<p>1) <strong>Historic norms and traditions for financing wars</strong>:  we have historically made major changes in tax poli:y in connection with undertaking wars, from the development of the income tax initially in the Civil War to its permanent inclusion in the US Code during WW I to the use of withholding in WWII and the enactment of a tax surcharge during Vietnam to pay for that war. </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>2) <strong>Ease of implementation:</strong> The &#8220;savings&#8221; from leaving Afghanistan coupled with the passage of the Budget Control Act with a cap on military spending offer a similar opportunity for a war surcharge.  Any &#8220;necessary&#8221; military spending above the cap would result in an automatic surcharge to raise the necessary revenues. </p>
<p>3) <strong>Proper consideration of the costs and benefits of war</strong>:  Rumbaugh notes that a surcharge will mean that argumnents for military action &#8220;would explicitly include a call for increased taxes, forcing the question of whether the stakes in the military situation are worth the cost.  If the American people agree they are worth it, the president will get both the political support and [the] financing he needs.&#8221;  After all, &#8220;[i]f military action is worth our troops&#8217; blood, it should be worth our treasure, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>These arguments seem sound.  Certainly one factor in causing the Great Recession we are still coming out of was the decision to go to war in Afghanistan and Iraq&#8211;wars likely to be long and costly in terms of technical equipment as well as lives and costs of caring for wounded soldiers (physically and psychically) afterwards&#8211;and just put it on the credit card by LOWERING taxes at the same time for the very wealthy amongst us in particular.  Whereas tax rates in war have been very high in the past, the Bush wars of choice were fought with borrowed money.  And perhaps those wars were more easily entered into because there was no direct cost obvious to Americans at the outset.</p>
<p>The use of a volunteer armed force left most of us more removed from the conflict; the use of &#8220;embedded&#8221; journalists who did not have the opportunity to capture iconic images of the war outside the scope of what the Pentagon wanted to be seen left most of us with uncertainty about what was really going on in the war zones; and the use of borrowed money to fund the wars meant Americans could go about their daily lives with little recognition that we were a country engaged in a very costly military battle.</p>
<p>PS. I would note that government spending even when it is based on borrowing doesn&#8217;t necessarily &#8220;wreck&#8221; the economy as he implies&#8211;Krugman, Stiglitz and other economists will tell you that it is much better to borrow and spend after a recession than to adopt silly austerity measures.  When the private sector isn&#8217;t spending, government needs to.  But we should spend wisely&#8211;infrastructure spending, for example, might make a lot more sense than military intervention spending, as Blodget suggests in the post linked below.  Even wiser&#8211;tax ourselves to pay for whatever wars we decide to fight.  The war tax is a win-win Tobin tax&#8211;if we go to war, at least we have the revenues to pay for the war.  If the potential tax take discourages us from going to war, then we have less war, which I suspect most of us would think is a pretty good outcome&#8230;&#8230;</p>

                                <p>I’m so surprised, and so happy.  There were three or four lines in there early on that I was so happy about, and just so surprised at, that they they brought tears to my eyes.  And that last few minutes of the speech&#8211;the part that segued from voting rights to gun violence issues and victims, and back again to voting rights&#8211;was just plain magnificent.  </p>
<p>And as someone who repeatedly mocked the people-as-props thing here on AB during the last week, I have to say that this time it was done really beautifully.  The story of the 15-year-old high school majorette who returned home to the south side of Chicago from performing with her team at the inauguration, only to be gunned down randomly in a park near her home, had really grabbed me emotionally when I first read about it, and her mother’s presence there tonight was incredibly effective in illustrating the essential point.  And the live video of the 101-year-old Miami lady who waited in line for hours to vote was a moment I’ll remember for a long time.  </p>
<p>This was a beautiful speech, beautifully delivered.  </p>

<p>let me say, however, that I think there’s a very good case that the redistribution of income away from labor to corporate profits is very likely a big factor.</p>

<p>The Inequality Gap</p>
<p>Robert Reich, former labor secretary, has some worthwhile advice for the President&#8217;s <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/David%2BFord/State%2Bof%2Bthe%2BUnion">State of the Union address</a>:  he notes that the focus should be the &#8220;central issue you want the nation to help you take action on&#8221;.  That&#8217;s &#8220;not immigration, guns or the environment&#8221; (though &#8220;[a]ll are important&#8221;) but rather &#8220;joblessness, falling real wages, economic insecurity, and widening inequality&#8221; . See Robert Reich, <a href="http://www.salon.com/2013/02/11/memo_to_obama_focus_on_the_inequality_gap_partner/">Memo to Obama: Focus on the inequality gap</a>, Salon.com (Feb. 11, 2013).</p>
<p>He&#8217;s right.</p>
<p>&#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It%27s_the_economy%2C_stupid">It&#8217;s the economy, stupid</a>&#8220;, that old slogan from the Clinton campaign days, goes only so far.  It doesn&#8217;t tell us, for example, what parts of the economy are most important&#8211;is it the stock market&#8217;s well-being, and indirectly the fortunes of the very few at the top of the income distribution who own significant amounts of those items being sold on the market?  Or is it the unemployment data, with its distressing litany of continuing failure of our economy to provide decent jobs for ordinary people?  Is it the way that corporate owners and managers can use the powers of government to make unionization difficult and thereby make it much easier for corporate management and shareholders to retain all the productivity gains while workers wages stagnate (everything from Wal-Mart&#8217;s tendency to tear down union fliers in worker areas (based on my personal observation) to the CEO&#8217;s determination to beat unions down any way possible (see the New York Times story in the 2/12 edition, At Cablevision, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norma_Rae">Norma Rae</a>&#8216;s Been Escorted Outside, New York Times (Feb. 12, 2013), at A23, regarding Cablevision&#8217;s firing of two  dozen employees for being off work,</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>after claiming to have an &#8220;open&#8221; management that invited worker conversations yet allowing those same employees to cool their heels for 40 minutes waiting to talk to him and then walking out and firing them for not being on the job)?  Or is it the general optimism of the upper class, who can pass on untaxed estates to heirs who will get those stocks at stepped up basis and renew the cycle of monetization without taxation for their own account?</p>
<p>Stock market statistics mostly tell us about the upper class, along with the upper part of the middle class that has some share of that bounty:  they don&#8217;t tell us about how well the economy is serving others, unless the general well-being of corporate America spills over to the general well-being of average Americans.  It doesn&#8217;t do that in an era of push-down on unions to ensure that workers have no voice, push-back on taxes to ensure that the wealthy managers and owners not only get all the productivity gains but have to pay too little in taxes to support the system that made those gains possible.  Mostly, stock market statistics tell us about how the privileged are maintaining their privilege, as their ownership of most of the financial assets continues to mean their heightened influence over most laws and their garnering of most of the gains that do take place.</p>
<p>This is well noted in a <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2013/02/there-is-nothing-inevitable-about-low-rates-of-economic-mobility.html">post on Economist&#8217;s View </a>(Mark Thoma), embedding a post by Miles Corak on Free Exchange about research on inter-generational social mobility.<br />
<blockquote>The real lesson from the historical research is not that there is anything inevitable about a low degree of inter-generational mobility, or that it signals more persistence than other research. The most privileged will do everything they can to perpetrate their status across generations, and in past eras the structure of labor markets and public policies permitted, and in some measure continue to permit, a non-level playing field.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve long argued that the way to evaluate the economy is in terms of how well it is serving ordinary people who make up the middle class (roughly defined as the middle three quitiles of the income and wealth distribution)  and how adequate is the safety net it provides for those who make up the lower class (the bottom quintile of income and wealth).</p>
<p>What matters is economic sustainability, in terms of  adequacy of those many intangibles by which we measure quality of life&#8211;like accessible quality health care, accessible quality education, accessible quality jobs, decent wages for decent work.  That means that government&#8217;s intervention in the economy will need to be on the side of the little guy, ensuring that resource allocation isn&#8217;t so skewed to the already rich that we become an oligarchy where most of us live off crumbs and a few of us live like kings.  If we want a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability">sustainable economy</a> and sustainable democracy, democratic eqalitarianism demands that governments temper market forces with protections for underdogs, providing counter forces to the redistribution upwards tendency of brute force capitalism.</p>
<p>Today, the rise of the US oligarchy and the frightening power of wealth in determining how laws work have put us in a terrible situation:   &#8220;debtor prisons, once a relic of the 18th century, are making a frightening comeback in the U.S. justice system.&#8221;  Alex Kane, <a href="http://www.salon.com/2013/02/11/miss_a_traffic_ticket_go_to_jail/">Miss a traffic ticket, go to jail?</a>, Salon.com (Feb. 11, 2013).</p>
<p>So an appropriate slogan for progressives today should be something along the lines of &#8220;It&#8217;s the inequality, stupid.&#8221;  And that certainly doesn&#8217;t mean more of the same old failed GOP policies that favor the wealthy, mistakenly labeled &#8220;job creators&#8221; by the GOP in its constant effort to undo unions (witness Michigan&#8217;s disastrous anti-union legislation or Cablevision&#8217;s determination to aid anti-union forces and squelch union activists), favor capital over labor (from the problematic preferential rate for capital gains to the ridiculous &#8220;carried interest&#8221; taxation of the compensation payments to so-called profits partners (a category of &#8220;partner&#8221; for tax purposes not provided for in the tax code but essentially an invention of Wall Street) to the squandering waste of an estate tax and charitable contribution deduction that favor meritless accession to and use of untaxed wealth and pushes the burden for government revenues to laborers instead).  And it certainly doesn&#8217;t mean more of the same &#8220;deficit hawks, austerity mavens, trickle-down charlatans, and government haters who have commanded center stage for too long.&#8221;  <a href="http://www.salon.com/2013/02/11/memo_to_obama_focus_on_the_inequality_gap_partner/">Memo to Obama: Focus on the inqueality gap</a>,</p>
<p>As Reich says:<br />
<blockquote>The President should make it clear that any Republican effort to hold the nation hostage to the GOP&#8217;s ideological fixation on the budget deficit and a smaller government will slow the economy, likely pushing us into another recession.  And that those most imperiled are the middle class and the poor.<br />He should emphasize that the real job creators are not the rich but the vast majority of ordinary Americans whose purchases give businesses reason to add jobs.  And that if most Americans still cannot afford to buy, the government must be the spender of last resort.  Id.</p></blockquote>
<p>Reich goes on to make some specific policy suggestions for acting to reduce inequality.  These include
<ul>
<li>reversing the impact of the reinstatement of the higher Social Security tax rate by exempting the first $20,000 of income from the tax and lifing the ceiling on income subject to it; </li>
<li>reviving government-run work corps, like the WPA and CCC, &#8220;to put the long-term unemployed directly to work&#8221; </li>
<li>raising the minimum wage </li>
<li>imposing a 2% tax surcharge on wealth in excess of $7 billion to be dedicated to education </li>
<li>Cutting corporate and military welfare </li>
<li>not cutting public investments or safety nets </li>
<li>giving tax credits for actual job creation </li>
<li>supporting states that rehire teachers, firefighters police and social workers.  Id. (quoting and paraphrasing).</li>
</ul>
<p>Sounds like a pretty good plan.   As Corak noted (in the <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2013/02/there-is-nothing-inevitable-about-low-rates-of-economic-mobility.html">Economist&#8217;s View post </a>cited above):<br />[D]ynamic labor markets offering new opportunities to the population as a whole, progressive public policies of relatively more benefit to the relatively disadvantaged, and strong families with growing incomes and human capital will lead to much more mobility than aristocrats of a pervious era could ever have imagined.</p>
<p>And the Reich plan is certainly better than what most of the GOP-led state experiments like Michigan are coming up with, which read like a plan for even more redistributing upwards to the top few, including:
<ul>
<li>eliminating income taxes in favor of regressive sales taxes, </li>
<li>eliminating business taxes in favor of regressive user fees (a GOP-led Michigan &#8220;upward&#8221; redistribution &#8220;innovation&#8221;), </li>
<li>pushing hard against unions  (a GOP-led Michigan &#8220;innovation&#8221;), </li>
<li>reducing safety net support like Medicaid (being considered in Michigan), </li>
<li>taxing vulnerable seniors on pension income (another of Michigan&#8217;s recent &#8220;innovations&#8221;), </li>
<li>cutting support for state universities while reallocating the support that remains to those that serve the upper class rather than underprivileged who will generally need to borrow more and take longer to succeed (another of Michigan&#8217;s redistributionist efforts).</li>
</ul>
