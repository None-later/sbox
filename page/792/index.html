                                <p>Regular readers know that I&#8217;ve had a series of posts comparing the performance of Presidents on various issues.  One thing that is clear is that <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/08/comparing-presidents-rankings-of.html">Democratic Presidents have outperformed their Republican counterparts when it comes to Economic Growth</a> over the past fifty something years.  I&#8217;ve tried it explaining it a number of ways, and I&#8217;ve looked at various factors, but while I&#8217;ve been able to show that a number of things aren&#8217;t the cause of this discrepancy, I haven&#8217;t been show what is.</p>
<p>After reading <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2007_09/012069.php">this post by Kevin Drum</a>, it occurs to me that while the difference in performance is something one can measure and put numbers on, the reason for the difference may be less quantifiable.  See, Kevin&#8217;s post links to two stories which have excerpts from Alan Greenspan&#8217;s forthcoming book.</p>
<p>Now, before we go on, I should note&#8230; Uncle Alan served under six Presidents:  Nixon, Ford, Reagan, GHW, Clinton, and GW.  </p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&#038;sid=aFm7L8vuX_ts&#038;refer=home">Bloomberg</a>, </p>
<blockquote><p>Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton were the most intelligent, he wrote, while he found Ford the most normal and likeable. Ronald Reagan was the most devoted to free markets, though his grasp of economics &#8220;wasn&#8217;t very deep or sophisticated.&#8221;</p>
<p>George H.W. Bush, the current president&#8217;s father, was very cordial, though Greenspan&#8217;s relationship with him was complicated by differing views on monetary policy, he wrote. Bush blamed high interest rates, in part, for his 1992 election loss to Clinton.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;<br />
<blockquote>Greenspan saved his harshest analysis for the current president. Soon after Bush took office in 2001, the president set about implementing a campaign promise to cut taxes, a policy Greenspan said he believed at the time wasn&#8217;t well conceived.</p>
<p>&#8220;Little value was placed on rigorous economic policy debate or the weighing of long-term consequences,&#8221; he wrote.</p></blockquote>
<p>The <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article_email/SB118978549183327730-lMyQjAxMDE3ODE5NDcxODQ1Wj.html">Wall Street Journal</a> went on&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>He describes Bill Clinton as &#8220;a fellow information hound&#8221; with &#8220;a consistent, disciplined focus on long-term economic growth&#8221; whose relationship with Monica Lewinsky &#8220;made me feel disappointed and sad.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>And lest we forget, this is Uncle Alan we&#8217;re talking about&#8230;  </p>
<blockquote><p>Mr. Greenspan, who calls himself a &#8220;lifelong libertarian Republican,&#8221; writes that he advised the White House to veto some bills to curb &#8220;out-of-control&#8221; spending while the Republicans controlled Congress. He says President Bush&#8217;s failure to do so &#8220;was a major mistake.&#8221; Republicans in Congress, he writes, &#8220;swapped principle for power. They ended up with neither. They deserved to lose.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>But we already knew <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/03/did-alan-greenspan-illegally-manipulate.html">Greenspan was no friend to Bill Clinton</a>.  </p>
<p>Now, among the six Presidents under whom Greenspan has served, one was a Democrat.  That Democrat was the best performer in terms of real GDP per capita growth, and all the more so when you take into account the change in the national debt.  (As discussed in other posts, one should account for changes in debt &#8211; since a component of GDP is government spending, the government could pull a Reagan, and boost GDP simply by borrowing a humongous amount and spending it, leaving a big bill for his successors.)   And that Democrat, not surprisingly, is the only one (according to these excerpts) that Uncle Alan characterized as intelligent and focused on economic growth.  And Nixon, the other President characterized as intelligent, was clearly more boneheaded on the economy &#8211; just think price controls.</p>
<p>What about the Presidents in our sample under whom Uncle Alan did not serve?  Well, those were Ike, JFK/LBJ, and Carter.  Ike&#8217;s reputation was that he was, well, out to golf.  JFK/LBJ, on the other hand, was the administration of technocrats.  Right or wrong, they brought number crunching to the White House, especially to the economy.  And Carter may be, as Homer has noted, &#8220;history&#8217;s greatest monster&#8221;, and a hapless micromanager to boot, but it was generally agreed he was a smart man. </p>
<p>So maybe that&#8217;s the difference&#8230;  Democratic Presidents have tended to be smarter and more focused on the economy.</p>

                                <p>Via <a href="http://matthewyglesias.theatlantic.com/archives/2007/09/listening_to_sunni_arabs.php">Matthew Yglesias</a> we get to <a href="http://prospect.org/cs/articles?article=sunni_world">Marc Lynch</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Iraq&#8217;s Sunnis must be amazed at the role they are playing in today&#8217;s Washington. A year ago, they were &#8220;dead-enders,&#8221; brutal killers disgruntled over their expulsion from power and nostalgic for the return of Saddam Hussein. The suggestion that Americans might productively talk to Sunni insurgents would have met with as much Beltway scorn as do calls today to engage in talks with Iran or Syria.</p>
<p>The best way to deal with these Sunni throwbacks, we were told back then, was to unleash American firepower and pummel them until they surrendered or died. America&#8217;s failures were failures of timidity and political correctness. Arabs only understood force, and America needed to beat them into submission and forget about &#8220;struggling to win hearts and minds which can&#8217;t be won.&#8221; The rubble of Fallujah and the prisons of Abu Ghraib bear silent testimony to the influence of such thinking.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;<br />
<blockquote>Alas, while the president&#8217;s men may have discovered Iraq&#8217;s Sunnis, they still show little sign of actually understanding them. The cheerleaders for the surge have constructed a Disney-esque fantasy of an Iraqi &#8220;Sunni World&#8221; which might as well be in Orlando for all it has to do with the grim realities of today&#8217;s Iraq.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;<br />
<blockquote>Much of the conventional wisdom about the Sunni areas now seems to come from the impressions formed by politicians and journalists on stage-managed visits to Iraq, or by carefully crafted press interviews with &#8220;former insurgents&#8221; hand-picked by American military handlers. But we don&#8217;t need such a mediated view. Leaders of the major Iraqi Sunni groups actually speak quite often and quite candidly to their own people, though: in open letters, in official statements posted on internet forums, in the Arab and Iraqi press, and in statements released on al-Jazeera and other satellite television stations. What they say in such statements, in Arabic, when addressing their own constituencies, might be considered a more reliable guide to their strategy and thinking. So what are the major Iraqi Sunni leaders saying?</p>
<p>In their literature and public rhetoric, the Sunni insurgency has already defeated the American occupation &#8212; which is why the Americans stopped fighting them and came to them for help in fighting al-Qaeda. One discovers virtually nothing in this literature of the American conceit that our forces wore them out or forced them to come to the table. During his meeting with President Bush in Anbar last week, Abu Risha, reportedly joked that his people had achieved in four months what the American military could not achieve in four years. It was one of the few claims made by Abu Risha with which most Iraqi Sunnis would agree, and one which should probably have infuriated more Americans than it seems to have.</p>
<p>Most of these statements are already looking past the question of al-Qaeda, and are instead in preparation for the aftermath of an American withdrawal. The overwhelming theme of recent Sunni discourse is the need to achieve political unity to prepare for a post-occupation Iraq. While Americans celebrate their cordial relations with certain tribal shaykhs, the insurgency&#8217;s leaders publicly fumed that the fruits of their victory might be snatched by undeserving interlopers. The widely disseminated pictures of President Bush shaking hands with Sattar Abu Risha, the epitome of such illegitimate bon vivantes, were likely his death warrant.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, certain tribes worry that the groundwork is being laid for the domination of Sunni politics by other tribes, and that this is in fact the American plan &#8212; to leave behind a divided, suspicious, and compromised array of tribes which will be unable to act politically. An important recent open letter from the highly influential Association of Muslim Scholars powerfully invoked the experience of the Afghan jihad, which collapsed upon itself after defeating the Soviet Union. The famously fractious insurgency has been trying hard to put forward a public political front to fill this perceived void, though at this point the various projects still seem to exist mostly on paper.</p>
<p>Partition, soft or hard, has far fewer fans in Anbar than in Washington. Most Sunnis continue to support a unified Iraqi state, and have exaggerated expectations about the role they should play in such a state. A recent letter from the &#8220;Amir&#8221; of the Islamic Army of Iraq claimed that Sunnis made up 60 percent of the population of Iraq, and few Sunnis seem ready to accept the status of &#8220;tolerated minority&#8221; within a Shia-dominated state. The Maliki government is almost universally denounced as sectarian, culpable for sectarian cleansing, and an Iranian puppet.</p>
<p>There is absolutely nothing in current Sunni discourse to suggest that any sort of &#8220;bottom up reconciliation&#8221; with the Shia is taking place or that the tactical cooperation with American forces against al-Qaeda is producing any kind of meaningful integration into the Iraqi state. Far more common is the need to prepare for future conflict with the Shia and, increasingly, the Kurds (see Kirkuk and Mosul). Resentment over the sectarian &#8216;cleansing&#8217; of Baghdad runs exceptionally high, and few Sunnis seem prepared to accept any political settlement which does not include their return to Baghdad &#8212; something that the Shia militias (which continue to dominate the Iraqi Police) seem rather unlikely to accept.</p>
<p>Finally, the alliance of convenience with American forces has not translated into support for the United States at the mass level. A public opinion survey conducted last month &#8212; well into the surge &#8212; found that only 1 percent of Sunnis say they have confidence in American forces and only 1 percent of Sunnis support the American presence in Iraq. Rather, 72 percent of Sunnis say that the US forces should leave immediately, 95 percent say that the presence of U.S. troops makes security worse, and 93 percent still see attacks on coalition forces as acceptable. Such results should make obvious the vacuity of claims that the turn against al-Qaeda was a victory for American diplomacy.</p></blockquote>
<p>As I&#8217;ve stated before, the big difference I can see between Iraq and Vietnam is that in Vietnam, our allies wouldn&#8217;t happily shoot at Americans if given the opportunity.  Fortunately, if we just clap harder the problem goes away.</p>

<blockquote><p>ADM&#8217;s finagling in Washington may have cost taxpayers and consumers more than $40 billion since 1980, counting the cost of the sugar program ($3 billion in higher prices each year), the ethanol program, and federal food giveaways and export subsidies. Some of those dubious programs probably would have been enacted even if Andreas had not been foisting cash on every politician in sight, but ADM deserves credit for being a decisive force in enacting and perpetuating many of the federal government&#8217;s most abusive policies.<br />ADM&#8217;s political strategy has long been based on the ideas that politicians should control prices and markets and that ADM and Andreas should control politicians. Some commentators may conclude that the ADM experience proves the need for campaign finance reform, but that would be the triumph of hope over experience. Campaign finance laws have been repeatedly revised in recent decades, yet politics does not smell any better.(137) As long as the politicians are shoveling out billions of dollars in handouts, some citizens will find a way to reward politicians for &#8220;looking after their interests.&#8221;<br />Besides, at a time when Congress is rightfully moving toward removing millions of able-bodied citizens from welfare rolls, there is no excuse to perpetuate handouts for a company like ADM. If a company can afford endless advertisements on national television, it is safe to conclude that it does not need any help from American taxpayers.<br />The Supreme Court, in Savings and Loan Association v. Topeka (1875), stated, &#8220;To lay with one hand the power of the government on the property of the citizen and with the other to bestow it upon favored individuals to aid private enterprises and build up private fortunes is none the less a robbery because it is done under the forms of law and is called taxation.&#8221;(138) Andreas apparently can buy politicians, but that does not mean that ADM has a right to shake down American consumers and taxpayers.<br />Congress, in the pending farm bill and in legislation to extend the ethanol gasoline fuel tax credit, has an excellent chance to shut down the ADM gravy train. Congress&#8217;s action on the ADM agenda will be an appropriate litmus test of the new Republican leadership&#8217;s spine. If Congress cannot stand up to ADM, how can they be expected to stand up for American taxpayers and consumers in other, less egregious cases?</p>

<p>Even the WTO GATS pressure will not move this mountain very soon. How do we know who captured whom? And is that a sane way to think?  And the Dems passed the Agricultural Bill 2007.</p>

<blockquote><p>For more than four years since the invasion of Iraq, President Bush most often has defined his objective there with a single, stirring word: &#8220;Victory.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Victory in Iraq is vital for the United States of America,&#8221; he told cadets at the U.S. Coast Guard Academy in May. &#8220;Victory in this struggle will require more patience, more courage and more sacrifice,&#8221; he warned National Guardsmen in West Virginia in July.</p>
<p>But this week, the word &#8220;victory&#8221; disappeared from the president&#8217;s lexicon. It was replaced by a slightly more ambiguous goal: &#8220;Success.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The success of a free Iraq is critical to the security of the United States,&#8221; Bush said Thursday evening in his brief televised address from the Oval Office.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, because of the measure of success we are seeing in Iraq, we can begin seeing troops come home,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Bush&#8217;s description of his war aims reflected two hard realities about his position on Iraq.</p>
<p>First, a large majority of the American public does not believe &#8220;victory&#8221; is possible. Dozens of opinion polls have found that fewer than 40% of voters think the war can be won.</p>
<p>Second, the men who are running the war &#8212; Army Gen. David H. Petraeus and U.S. Ambassador Ryan C. Crocker &#8212; made it clear this week that their immediate goals were more limited than &#8220;victory.&#8221;</p>
<p>Where the United States once hoped for a peaceful, united Iraq governed by a Western-style parliament, Petraeus and Crocker described more modest goals: reducing sectarian violence, avoiding all-out civil war and encouraging self-rule with a strong role for tribal sheiks who are not elected.</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot guarantee success in Iraq,&#8221; Crocker said in hearings before Congress. &#8220;The challenges. . . are immense.&#8221;</p>
<p>Petraeus shied away from even using the word &#8220;success.&#8221; When a senator asked whether the United States had &#8220;a realistic chance to be successful&#8221; in Iraq, the general carefully replied: &#8220;I believe we have a realistic chance of achieving our objectives.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Four years and change out, the purpose of staying in Iraq has become to try to reduce the level of violence resulting from the invasion of Iraq.</p>

                                <p>Here is a link to how <a href="http://www.truthout.org/docs_2006/091307L.shtml">Petraeus&#8217; boss feels abuse him</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In sharp contrast to the lionisation of Gen. David Petraeus by members of the U.S. Congress during his testimony this week, Petraeus&#8217;s superior, Admiral William Fallon, chief of the Central Command (CENTCOM), derided Petraeus as a sycophant during their first meeting in Baghdad last March, according to Pentagon sources familiar with reports of the meeting.</p>
<p>    Fallon told Petraeus that he considered him to be &#8220;an ass-kissing little chickenshit&#8221; and added, &#8220;I hate people like that&#8221;, the sources say. That remark reportedly came after Petraeus began the meeting by making remarks that Fallon interpreted as trying to ingratiate himself with a superior.</p>
<p>    That extraordinarily contentious start of Fallon&#8217;s mission to Baghdad led to more meetings marked by acute tension between the two commanders. Fallon went on develop his own alternative to Petraeus&#8217;s recommendation for continued high levels of U.S. troops in Iraq during the summer.</p></blockquote>
<p>Aside from being put off by his &#8220;buttering up&#8221; to his superiors style, Fallon is concerned about the rest of his Central COmmand responsibilities including keeping the oil flowing, Pakistan with nukes falling to the mullahs running the Madrassas, and several issues in Africa and beyond.</p>
<p>He may consider Gen Petraeus to be polishing the apple for the president a president deluded and out of touch while avoiding his oath and professional responsibility to tell it like it is and support sand defend the constitution not his prospects for the job at the Joint Chiefs.</p>
<p>Of course, any officer aware of their duty to the constitution may be move by that duty to question why we are defending US interests which are different than any reasonable definition of the &#8220;common defense&#8221;. What interests in oil business has to do with keeping the British and Indians out of my neighborhood is beyond me.</p>
<p>Except that the DoD is the tool of the commercial interests which define national interest. George Washington warned against he moral hazard of having a standing army!</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s <a href="http://www.truthout.org/docs_2006/091307L.shtml">another link</a>.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p>Cactus here&#8230;   I note that <a href="http://hughhewitt.townhall.com/blog/g/8040ca8d-2b1e-4aba-a942-62f45a5749ea&#038;comments=true#commentAnchor">some on the right</a> are saying this story &#8211; Fallon&#8217;s expressed opinion of Petraeus &#8211; is made up given that the original source for the links ILSM provides are small outfits.</p>
<p>So here&#8217;s the relatively cheerleading <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/08/AR2007090801846.html">Washington Post</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>For two hours, President Bush listened to contrasting visions of the U.S. future in Iraq. Gen. David H. Petraeus dominated the conversation by video link from Baghdad, making the case to keep as many troops as long as possible to cement any security progress. Adm. William J. Fallon, his superior, argued instead for accepting more risks in Iraq, officials said, in order to have enough forces available to confront other potential threats in the region.</p>
<p>The polite discussion in the White House Situation Room a week ago masked a sharper clash over the U.S. venture in Iraq, one that has been building since Fallon, chief of the U.S. Central Command, which oversees Middle East operations, sent a rear admiral to Baghdad this summer to gather information. Soon afterward, officials said, Fallon began developing plans to redefine the U.S. mission and radically draw down troops.</p>
<p>One of those plans, according to a Centcom officer, involved slashing U.S. combat forces in Iraq by three-quarters by 2010. In an interview, Fallon disputed that description but declined to offer details. Nonetheless, his efforts offended Petraeus&#8217;s team, which saw them as unwelcome intrusion on their own long-term planning. The profoundly different views of the U.S. role in Iraq only exacerbated the schism between the two men.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bad relations?&#8221; said a senior civilian official with a laugh. &#8220;That&#8217;s the understatement of the century. . . . If you think Armageddon was a riot, that&#8217;s one way of looking at it.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

                                <p>There is a growing debate about the future of the US healthcare system and the possible of universal care. Hillary Clinton is about to make some major new proposals early next week.</p>
<p>If we were to adopt some sort of federal universal healthcare the system would inevitably  be some sort of “managed care,” and that will inevitably lead to some form of soft or hard rationing.</p>
<p>Public policy geeks and economists tend to look at this from a macro view, but how would this impact real people with real health care issues?</p>
<p>Decision case:</p>
<p>Joe is 67 and retired. He spent most of his life as a carpet layer and tile installer, both of which are hard on the knees.</p>
<p>Joe has no cartilage (meniscus) in his right knee, which causes bone-on-bone rubbing with movement and considerable pain.  The pain cannot be controlled by medication or injections. Joe’s left knee is not as bad but headed in the same direction.  Joe is otherwise in good health.</p>
<p>Joe is not disabled in a vocational sense because he is retired. He is disabled in the sense of qualifying for the disability parking sticker and having limitations on his ADL (activities of daily living).</p>
<p>Joe would get considerable pain relief and increased mobility from a total knee replacement.</p>
<p>In our universal system, is this a necessary surgery or a low priority elective surgery?  You decide.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>In looking at the question of whether business or government is more wasteful it might actually be possible to use the pro-business argument to demonstrate that business is actually more wasteful.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>The argument is that government does not have competition to force it to quit doing something so it continues to do things when they are no longer needed.  I agree it is a valid argument.</p>
</p>
<p>The argument continues that competition forces inefficient firms to close down and they commonly cite examples of bad firms like Enron or Countrywide to document their case.</p>
<p>But they make their case with a few examples and virtually never look at aggregate data.</p>
<p>There was a study in the BLS monthly Labor Review of May, 2005 that actually looked at this issue.</p>
<p>The looked at how new businesses survive.  They found that 33% of new business fail in the first two years and 56% fail within four years.  I’ve heard these types of numbers cited for restaurants, but this study found that there really was no significant difference between the failure rate for restaurants and other industries.</p>
<p>The study also looked at other studies of the survival rate or exit rate for established firms.  The studies they cited found that for established firms about  50% go out of business every four years and over 60% exit every five years.</p>
<p>The numbers are not exactly comparable, but the BLS study found that roughly 20% of US firms close down every year. That has to be a tremendous misallocation of resources. Remember, these will generally be smaller firms. But it is like the data on job creation.  You hear all the time that small firms create most jobs  This is true, but they also destroy more jobs so that over time their share of employment never seems to grow.</p>
<p>So what we are looking at is that government is wasteful because competition does not force it to quit doing some things.  But on the other hand having some 20% of US businesses closing down every year also seems to be very wasteful.  I’m deliberately using the term wasteful, not efficient because efficiency and wastefulness are not exactly the same thing.</p>
<p>On balance I do not how to make a meaningful comparison of these two phenomena. One reason is that I have no estimate of how much of government should be closed down.</p>
<p>So I have no idea whether the private sector or government is more wasteful. But I doubt that very many of the individuals making the case for private business not being wasteful are really aware how wasteful private business really is even though hand having 20% of US businesses closing down every year may be highly efficient because it is the best we can do.</p>

                                <p>It seems there are a few rules that emerged from yesterday&#8217;s discussion about private versus public functions and efficiencies.</p>
<p>1. Government functions are inefficient all on their own. There are not enough feedback mechanisms to make government efficient at any point in time, and its functions serve &#8216;minimal&#8217; or no purpose. With the taxing ability, however, it does not go out of business and just gets bigger.</p>
<p>2. Private market functions have inefficient times called market failures but pricing weeds out winners and losers continuously as they serve buying preferences of customers. Winners and losers are companies only, and not the players so much.</p>
<p>3. 1 and 2 have no moral and ethical considerations as a societal preference, since pricing (and some others?) is the key mechanism that makes sense to sort everything out.</p>
<p>4. Government is the preferred method of coercion because it is more &#8216;efficient&#8217; in the art of coercion than private companies.</p>
<p>5. Private companies that capture government functions are blameless, since government opportunity costs make it seductively irresistable and coerces companies into such behavior.</p>
<p>6. &#8216;Eventual&#8217; corrections is a term for private companies (no time given or examples) for not adapting, whereas government is incapable of adapting except when it changes policy.</p>
<p>7.</p>
<p>Please correct any misconceptions I have about yesterday&#8217;s discussion.</p>
