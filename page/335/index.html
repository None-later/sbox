<p>Silly Krugman.  And silly Andrew Leonard.  Sure, the S&#038;P 500 is up a few percentage points.  But it would be up many, many times that amount if not for the healthcare bill.</p>

                                <p>Jamie Galbraith writes in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thenation.com/doc/20100322/galbraith">The Nation</a>:</p>
<p>In Defense of Deficits </p>
<blockquote><p>The Simpson-Bowles Commission, just established by the president, will no doubt deliver an attack on Social Security and Medicare dressed up in the sanctimonious rhetoric of deficit reduction. (Back in his salad days, former Senator Alan Simpson was a regular schemer to cut Social Security.) The Obama spending freeze is another symbolic sacrifice to the deficit gods. Most observers believe neither will amount to much, and one can hope that they are right. But what would be the economic consequences if they did? The answer is that a big deficit-reduction program would destroy the economy, or what remains of it, two years into the Great Crisis. </p>
<p>A big deficit-reduction program would destroy the economy two years into the Great Crisis. For this reason, the deficit phobia of Wall Street, the press, some economists and practically all politicians is one of the deepest dangers that we face. It&#8217;s not just the old and the sick who are threatened; we all are. To cut current deficits without first rebuilding the economic engine of the private credit system is a sure path to stagnation, to a double-dip recession&#8211;even to a second Great Depression. To focus obsessively on cutting future deficits is also a path that will obstruct, not assist, what we need to do to re-establish strong growth and high employment. </p>
<p>To put things crudely, there are two ways to get the increase in total spending that we call &#8220;economic growth.&#8221; One way is for government to spend. The other is for banks to lend. Leaving aside short-term adjustments like increased net exports or financial innovation, that&#8217;s basically all there is. Governments and banks are the two entities with the power to create something from nothing. If total spending power is to grow, one or the other of these two great financial motors&#8211;public deficits or private loans&#8211;has to be in action.</p></blockquote>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />
<blockquote>For ordinary people, public budget deficits, despite their bad reputation, are much better than private loans. Deficits put money in private pockets. Private households get more cash. They own that cash free and clear, and they can spend it as they like. If they wish, they can also convert it into interest-earning government bonds or they can repay their debts. This is called an increase in &#8220;net financial wealth.&#8221; Ordinary people benefit, but there is nothing in it for banks. </p>
<p>And this, in the simplest terms, explains the deficit phobia of Wall Street, the corporate media and the right-wing economists. Bankers don&#8217;t like budget deficits because they compete with bank loans as a source of growth. When a bank makes a loan, cash balances in private hands also go up. But now the cash is not owned free and clear. There is a contractual obligation to pay interest and to repay principal. If the enterprise defaults, there may be an asset left over&#8211;a house or factory or company&#8211;that will then become the property of the bank. It&#8217;s easy to see why bankers love private credit but hate public deficits. </p>
<p>All of this should be painfully obvious, but it is deeply obscure. It is obscure because legions of Wall Streeters&#8211;led notably in our time by Peter Peterson and his front man, former comptroller general David Walker, and including the Robert Rubin wing of the Democratic Party and numerous &#8220;bipartisan&#8221; enterprises like the Concord Coalition and the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget&#8211;have labored mightily to confuse the issues. These spirits never uttered a single word of warning about the financial crisis, which originated on Wall Street under the noses of their bag men. But they constantly warn, quite falsely, that the government is a &#8220;super subprime&#8221; &#8220;Ponzi scheme,&#8221; which it is not. </p>
<p>We also hear, from the same people, about the impending &#8220;bankruptcy&#8221; of Social Security, Medicare&#8211;even the United States itself. Or of the burden that public debts will &#8220;impose on our grandchildren.&#8221; Or about &#8220;unfunded liabilities&#8221; supposedly facing us all. All of this forms part of one of the great misinformation campaigns of all time. </p>
<p>The misinformation is rooted in what many consider to be plain common sense. It may seem like homely wisdom, especially, to say that &#8220;just like the family, the government can&#8217;t live beyond its means.&#8221; But it&#8217;s not. In these matters the public and private sectors differ on a very basic point. Your family needs income in order to pay its debts. Your government does not. </p>
<p>Private borrowers can and do default. They go bankrupt (a protection civilized societies afford them instead of debtors&#8217; prisons). Or if they have a mortgage, in most states they can simply walk away from their house if they can no longer continue to make payments on it. </p>
<p>With government, the risk of nonpayment does not exist. Government spends money (and pays interest) simply by typing numbers into a computer. Unlike private debtors, government does not need to have cash on hand. As the inspired amateur economist Warren Mosler likes to say, the person who writes Social Security checks at the Treasury does not have the phone number of the tax collector at the IRS. If you choose to pay taxes in cash, the government will give you a receipt&#8211;and shred the bills. Since it is the source of money, government can&#8217;t run out. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s true that government can spend imprudently. Too much spending, net of taxes, may lead to inflation, often via currency depreciation&#8211;though with the world in recession, that&#8217;s not an immediate risk. Wasteful spending&#8211;on unnecessary military adventures, say&#8211;burns real resources. But no government can ever be forced to default on debts in a currency it controls. Public defaults happen only when governments don&#8217;t control the currency in which they owe debts&#8211;as Argentina owed dollars or as Greece now (it hasn&#8217;t defaulted yet) owes euros. But for true sovereigns, bankruptcy is an irrelevant concept. When Obama says, even offhand, that the United States is &#8220;out of money,&#8221; he&#8217;s talking nonsense&#8211;dangerous nonsense. One wonders if he believes it. </p>
<p>Nor is public debt a burden on future generations. It does not have to be repaid, and in practice it will never be repaid. Personal debts are generally settled during the lifetime of the debtor or at death, because one person cannot easily encumber another. But public debt does not ever have to be repaid. Governments do not die&#8211;except in war or revolution, and when that happens, their debts are generally moot anyway. </p>
<p>So the public debt simply increases from one year to the next. In the entire history of the United States it has done so, with budget deficits and increased public debt on all but about six very short occasions&#8211;with each surplus followed by a recession. Far from being a burden, these debts are the foundation of economic growth. Bonds owed by the government yield net income to the private sector, unlike all purely private debts, which merely transfer income from one part of the private sector to another. </p>
<p>Nor is that interest a solvency threat. A recent projection from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, based on Congressional Budget Office assumptions, has public-debt interest payments rising to 15 percent of GDP by 2050, with total debt to GDP at 300 percent. But that can&#8217;t happen. If the interest were paid to people who then spent it on goods and services and job creation, it would be just like other public spending. Interest payments so enormous would affect the economy much like the mobilization for World War II. Long before you even got close to those scary ratios, you&#8217;d get full employment and rising inflation&#8211;pushing up GDP and, in turn, stabilizing the debt-to-GDP ratio. Or the Federal Reserve would stabilize the interest payouts, simply by keeping short-term interest rates (which it controls) very low.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>The Dan Rather interview also reminded me of the many Senators and House members <a target="_blank" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/politics/congress-retirements/?wpisrc=nl_politics">outright retirements or &#8220;running for another office&#8221;</a> that affect the nature of incumbent advantage in more regular elections. From a cursory google of sources I believe there are 9 senate retirements (4 R, 5D) and 17 (6R,11D) House members retiring outright, and the numbers sort of even out overall when those &#8220;seeking other offices&#8221; are added to the list.</p>

Maggie’s comments are in the parenthesis in red on transcripts of Rathers and Maddow’s exchange.</p>
<p><strong>Dan Rather on Presidents Obama, LBJ and HCR: </strong></p>
<blockquote><p>I saw Dan Rather on the Rachel Maddow show. Some people have suggested that today, the country is polarized the way it was in the 1960s. But Rather reminds us that when Congress passed Medicare in 1965, President Johnson was operating in a very different landscape. Reading this interview, one realizes what President Obama has been up against. He beings by observing that, if he succeeds, President Obama will be making history.</p>
<p>RATHER: “It will be the signature achievement of this first term, perhaps the only term, but a signature achievement of President Obama`s this term. And whether one likes it or not, disagrees with it or not, it takes up the line that started with Social Security, ran through Medicare and Medicaid, which was passed more than 40 years ago, 45 years ago, and it will be put in that category. [Rather is not saying that Obama will be a one-term president. But he is suggesting that even if he only has four years, he will have accomplished more than the vast majority of two-term presidents.-mm]</p>
<p>“And if it passes, and if it is put into effect, I expect it will be in the first paragraph of President Obama`s obituary, that he passed health care reform, partly because so many presidents — President Johnson was successful, but President&#8230;</p>
<p>MADDOW: When Lyndon Johnson was able to get Medicare passed in 1965, is there any useful comparison to make or contrast to draw between the political environment in which he was able to make that happen in `65, and the way — and the environment in which Obama has been able to presumably make this happen if he does it?<br />RATHER: Well, there are certainly a lot of contrasts. First of all, remember that President Johnson got this landmark legislation, Medicare and Medicaid, passed in the wake of the assassination of President Kennedy. He ascended to the presidency. And the country was aching to not only appear to be, but to be united. [this is very true&#8211;mm]</p></blockquote>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />
<blockquote>I have my doubts whether President Johnson could have gotten Medicare and Medicaid pass if it had not been for the assassination of President Kennedy and the mood the country was into after that. Then, the second thing, that there was — certainly it was political warfare, and the kind of no holds barred political warfare. But nothing like the polarization in Washington and nothing like the polarization in the country existed at that time.<br />MADDOW: Really?<br />RATHER: And –<br />MADDOW: I always think that — I look at the polarization we have now and I think oh every generation must think that they`re the most polarized time ever.<br />RATHER: No.<br />MADDOW: You think we are actually. . . . [here, one realizes how young Maddow is—mm] <br />RATHER: I think we are. This is the most polarized the country has been certainly since the 1960s over the Vietnam War, and I think even more so than then, and Washington is unquestionably more polarized.<br />Lyndon Johnson got Medicare and Medicaid passed, given the special circumstances in the wake of President Kennedy`s assassination, but he did so with some Republican support.<br />MADDOW: That`s right.<br />RATHER: The Republican Party was almost totally different. You had three wings of the Republican Party Lyndon Johnson was dealing with. You had the liberal Republicans, and they would call that people like Jake Javits, the senator from New York. You had moderate Republicans, many of them from the upper Midwest, and then you had self-described more conservative Republicans. [Yes, and the liberal Democrats were powerful in states like N.Y. –mm]<br />You had the three. That made it a totally different situation than today. The Republican Party was not completely totally united against it. It was, in the main, united against it, but you see the difference.<br />Whereas now the Republicans, whether — again whether you like it or not, they have been from a strictly political/practical standpoint, well disciplined, well organized and a total and complete absolute united front against health care. [He is right: The Republican party has become monolithic in a way that it never was. It’s easy to forget that it wasn’t always this way. Something very strange has happened within our government. mm]<br />Lyndon Johnson didn`t face that.<br />Also, . . . the Senate leadership had a lot of what we call the, quote, “old votes,” . . . Senate changed a lot in the early 1970s, but in this period in the 1960s when Medicare and Medicaid were passed, that — the seniority system was much stronger.<br />You had a lot of people who had been in the Senate and the House for a long time, some of them 35 to 40 years. And President Johnson himself had been a congressman and senator for a very long time. [The old bulls provided leadership. Some [and I’m including Republicans here) were even statesmen. Now, we have Mitch McConnell] <br />It was almost a completely different landscape from which President Obama is operating today. . <br />RATHER: . . . I`m — back from a trip to California and some other places in the country, the country is angry. This is as angry as I`ve seen the country. Republicans, Democrats, independents, mugwamps, whatever they are.. They`re really angry.<br />A lot of it springs from the recession, almost depression that we went through and a sense that we`re not all the way through it yet. And that anger is going to be interesting to see how it cuts in the November elections. Very, very interesting. [My guess is that many incumbents will lose their seats—Republicans as well as Democrats: Voters will say, “Throw the bums out”&#8211; mm.’]</p></blockquote>

<p>Well me neither. I read through the Tri-Committee and HELP Bills and the Senate Finance Committee&#8217;s Chairman&#8217;s Mark and then both the Pelosi and Reid versions as introduced and followed as best I could the last minute revisions introduced by the Team of Ten but as I type I have yet to actually slog through the text as passed on Sunday night. I think I know what is in the bill and what was signed into law a few minutes ago but I don&#8217;t actually know. But I will. And you can too. And then maybe follow up with the proposed text of the reconciliation fix.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-h3590/show">H.R.3590 &#8211; Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act</a><br />Given that this is the same bill as was passed by the Senate on Dec 24th some of you may be ahead of me here. But this is the law as it stands this morning Tuesday March 23</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.opencongress.org/house_reconciliation">Health Care Bill &#8211; H.R. 4872 &#8211; Reconciliation Act of 2010</a><br />Hmm, I didn&#8217;t realize until just now that the Reconciliation Bill was in the form of a Substitute, meaning that absent any changes mandated by the Parliamentarian or other amendments approved by the Senate this would be the actual final version of the law to be sometime later this month.</p>
<p>Links to our friends (or at least my friend) at Open Congress.org. I am going to take some time and read through the bill and settle out what I think I know from reading all the previous iterations and what we are really dealing with going forward: 300% of FPL or 400%, 11% max out of pocket or 12% or 8.5%? It has been a blizzard of changing numbers. But soon enough it will be what it will be, time to dig down into the data in the true Angry Bear spirit.</p>
<p>Bon appetit!! And consider this an open topical Health Care thread.</p>

<p>A Simple Explanation of How The Use of Derivatives Created The Great Recession</p>
<p>In comments to a <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/03/what-is-punk-staffer.html#comments">post by fellow Angry Bear Robert Waldman</a>, reader Cantab writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Nobody here has come up with a believable story on how derivatives hurt the economy or were the cause of the recession. All we really get is a claim that they happened together and the further assertion that derivates [sic] caused the recession rather than the more likely story that derivatives were the victim of the recession.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure Cantab is wrong but I don&#8217;t have the time to find the various posts that described the issue.  But I can summarize:  </p>
<p>1.  Derivatives are about magnifying bets.  A $2 bet on a derivative can be the same thing as a $100 bet on the asset that underlies the security.  Thus, if the asset doubles in value, instead of taking home an extra $2 on your bet, you take home an extra $100.  But if the price of the asset falls in half, instead of losing $2 on your bet, you lose $100.  <br />2.  On Wall Street, everyone leveraged up.  After all, the worst that can happen when you gamble with monster leverage is that you go bankrupt.  But if you win your bets, you make humongous profits.  <br />3.  Inevitably, when everyone is leveraged up, at least some of those who are leveraged must sooner or later make some bad bets.  But the losses associated with these leveraged up bad bets was much bigger than in the past.  Instead of losing $2 on their $2 bets as would have happened in the past, they lost $100.  In the past, the losers&#8217; assets would simply have been liquidated, and those assets would have been enough to cover a substantial part of the losses.  With derivatives, liquidation covers an insignificant piece of what is owed.<br />4.  Result:  massive, and I mean massive, losses to the firm&#8217;s creditors.  Perhaps big enough to drive their creditors out of business too.  And those creditors have creditors too&#8230;<br />5.  As a result of 4,  a firm could win all its bets and still be driven out of business, simply by virtue of being stupid enough to bet against another firm who realized point 2.  (And every firm on Wall Street, apparently, realized point 2.)  In fact, a firm could be driven out of business despite winning its bets if one of its counterparties was stupid enough to bet against another firm who realized point 2.  Being twice or three times removed from a loser might not be enough to keep a firm from being pulled under.<br />6.  Derivatives are also opaque.  There&#8217;s no way of knowing who took out which bets with who until someone declares bankruptcy.<br />7.  Very quickly, it became apparent that any of the firms on Wall Street might already be on the inevitable path toward bankruptcy, but there was no way at all to tell the difference between those that were on that path and those that weren&#8217;t, or even if there were any firms that weren&#8217;t headed toward bankruptcy.<br />8.  All deals ceased.  The real world, that had gotten used to unlimited amounts of cheap money sloshing around, abruptly and without warning found itself cut off from its fix.  Expansions plans, hiring, etc. were put on hold.  And companies that were teetering on the edge that earlier would have found some savior on Wall Street found themselves having to shut down or scale back instead.  </p>
<p>I have to admit, its taken me a while to come to terms to how big the derivative market was.  I had no idea, no inkling of its size back in March of 2008 when I began asking <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2008/03/how-is-this-recession-not-like-other.html">what was different about the current recession</a>.  As a result, though I noted the possibility of a <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2008/03/question-forabout-conservatives-and.html">&#8220;major downturn&#8221;</a>, I was surprised by exactly how big the downturn would really be.  What scares me is that that I&#8217;m not seeing anything, anything at all that prevents or even makes the 8 steps I described above any less likely to occur.  The bail-outs were madness.   Those who knowingly go out of their way to play with dynamite should be allowed to blow themselves up, and the job of government should be to prevent the rest of us from having to deal with the consequences.  </p>
<p>Which brings me back to something else I wrote in 2008.  We need a public option&#8230; in the financial system.  Let the <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2008/09/cactus-offers-another-immodest-proposal.html">public bank at the Fed the way the banks bank at the Fed</a>.  If given a choice between keeping my money at B of A or the Fed, I know which I&#8217;ll pick.</p>

<p>This morning there was an abundance of links evidencing the building anxiety over U.S.-China relations. Edward Harrison at <a href="http://www.creditwritedowns.com/">Credit Writedowns</a> links to a Reuters article, <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE62K20T20100321">China vows to hit back if targeted by U.S. on yuan</a>. <a href="http://www.calculatedriskblog.com/">Calculated Risk</a> refers to commentary at the Financial Times and the Washington Post referencing <a href="http://www.calculatedriskblog.com/2010/03/report-china-losing-support-of-american.html">China Losing Support of American Business Community</a>.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s think about the currency from a U.S. auto exporter&#8217;s viewpoint. <a href="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/cndy/2010-03/15/content_9588631.htm">The China Daily</a> looks at China&#8217;s relatively “young” automotive market compared to its developed U.S. counterpart. But what if the yuan appreciates more than expected against the U.S. dollar? This market would develop much quicker than the article portends, and the room for revenue growth is vast.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,5366641,00.html">Deutsche Welle</a> also reports the benefits that Europe would incur from a stronger yuan compared to the U.S. dollar, which gives me pause: why exactly would Europe profit from an appreciation of the Chinese yuan against the U.S. dollar? The U.S. export industry, yes, but Europe? <a href="http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,5366641,00.html">Deutsche Welle tells us</a>:<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;But Europe stands to benefit a lot, because with a revaluation, European products would become more affordable for Chinese consumers and companies alike and we would definitely feel the benefits in terms of better exports,&#8221; said Schularick.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is an entirely one-sided argument: if the Chinese yuan appreciates, then export income would be diverted away from Chinese exports and toward Chinese imports, paving the way for Europe to reap the benefits. Same story as in the U.S. auto maker case, but with a twist: China has options.</p>
<p>First, China drops the currency peg, allowing its exchange rate to float (appreciate) against the U.S. dollar (USD). In this situation, the USD will depreciate not only against the Chinese yuan (CNY), but more likely against all currencies to which the USD is implicitly pegged via the yuan.</p>
<p>It’s pretty simple, really, if you think about cross rates: USD:CNY / EUR:CNY = USD:EUR. If USD:CNY falls (i.e., the U.S. dollar depreciates against the Chinese yuan), and that depreciation is not matched by an equal increase of the EUR:CNY (appreciation of the Eurozone euro against the Chinese yuan), then you get a depreciation of the U.S. dollar against the euro (the USD:EUR falls).</p>
<p>Point 1: as the Chinese yuan floats, it’s very likely that all else equal, the U.S. dollar depreciates against the euro. This improves the near-term prospects for U.S. exports to Europe, and reduces those for European exports to the U.S. (given sticky prices). Therefore, the increased demand for European exports to China will be offset somewhat by the decline in demand for those to the U.S.</p>
<p>Second, given that the Chinese do not allow the yuan to float (much more likely), who’s to say that the Chinese will not simply substitute one peg for another, i.e., target the euro to a larger degree? This would be very simple; and frankly, a euro peg would make more sense, given the trade flows between Europe and China.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/S6fWLgdzR6I/AAAAAAAAC9E/ajhlvpLrISY/s1600-h/china_exports.PNG"><img alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/S6fWLgdzR6I/AAAAAAAAC9E/ajhlvpLrISY/s320/china_exports.PNG" border="0"></a>Europe is a natural market for Chinese exports: in 2007, 24% of China’s exports landed in Europe, while 21% shipped to North America. All else equal, a euro peg would be quite an effective “export growth tool” if the Chinese shifted their asset base from U.S.-denominated assets toward Euro-denominated assets.</p>
<p>Point to 2: Europe would be very much worse off if China simply increased the weight of the euro in its currency target basket. The biggest economy in the Eurozone, Germany, is an “exporter” itself. Talk about trade wars!</p>
<p>U.S.-China bi-lateral relations SHOULD BE TREATED as a multi-lateral story; they&#8217;re interconnected.</p>

(Links to same will be updated as soon as possible.)<br /></em>
<p>To review, there are three standard methods of reducing a fiscal debt: default, inflate, and taxation and/or budget cutting.  I believe it is clear that default is not desirable; the historic examples of 1917 Russia and the State of Louisiana are clear indicators that issues persist long after the act itself, and the recent suffering of the Argentineans in 2002 and 2003 clearly shows that, even at the time, default is at best a problematic solution, more an amputation than a lancing.</p>
<p>The second, moderate inflation, has the collateral issue that some of the assumed benefits of an inflationary policy—especially an inflationary policy in an environment with a relatively low savings rate—do not accrue to the country whose currency is the dominant one in the world.  As I noted earlier, David Beckworth is doing some research in this area, and I look forward to seeing the results.It seems safe to assume that the benefits of inflation will not accrue in the way a model might predict, and therefore “solving” the problem with inflation will require a suboptimal level to achieve optimal policy.  The chance of having to repeat “the Volcker experiment” would not be small, while the likelihood of success would not be so large.</p>
<p>Budget cutting is an abiding idea. While I’m perfectly willing to stipulate that one might be able to cut around 1% of GDP from the US defense budget, and that some direct consumption—though much of this is a State and Local issue more than a Federal one—might be reducible, this appears unlikely to have more than a marginal effect. While we like—indeed, make a living from identifying—marginal effects, the magnitude of the issue at hand requires more.  Since we generally can stipulate that transfer payments are at worst neutral (or, by Jim Baker’s “supply-side/conspicuous consumption” theory presented earlier, likely beneficial to both the velocity of money and overall tax revenues), gains from there will, at best, not help the team.</p>

</p>
<p>This leaves taxation, and it is perfectly reasonable to assume that taxation can be increased. Except that, as you can see from the graphic I have left on the screen, we have a large deadweight loss in health care spending. We spend approximately 6% more, on a percent-of-GDP basis, than the next country, with no noticeable economic value-added.  Having that deadweight loss hanging over the economy limits options—possibly as much or more than being the dominant currency.  And since the basic premise of this panel appears to be that we would prefer that the US Dollar remain the dominant world currency—that is, becoming the 21st century equivalent of 20th century Britain not being a desired outcome—we are left to the reality that we cannot solve the budget crisis without reducing or eliminating much of the deadweight loss in the health-care system.</p>
<p>Were we to solve only half of the difference and transfer that amount to tax revenues, we would solve the budget deficit without adding any drag to the economy, effectively substituting tax revenues for cost overruns. We would, in short, have produced a better team: a better engine for growth and a greater potential for entrepreneurial opportunity, even if a groundskeeper becomes underutilized in the process.</p>
<p>The most viable alternative to addressing the deficit by addressing the deadweight loss in the health-care system appears to be to yield our place as the world’s Reserve currency of choice. There does not appear to be much of an appetite for that, even if there were a clear mechanism to do so.</p>
<p>As economists we look for the suboptimal.  In this case, we can identify the areas where the returns are low—defense spending—the areas where spending growth might be moderated—Government Direct Consumption, although that is a very nominal portion of the Federal budget—and areas where there are clear deadweight losses—health care spending.  Only the latter shows much promise as a direct, not just a marginal, way to address the problem.</p>

<p>Whence Teabaggery?</p>
<p>Opponents of Health Care Reform vow to keep up their efforts and sweep Republicans to victory in November. But where do they take their stand? Up to now they have been opposing potential legislation that existed mostly in their own imagination: Socialized Medicine, Obamacare, Government Bureaucrats between You and Your Doctor. But now that the die is cast, because in the bigger picture the reconciliation bill is just tinkering around the edges, what will actually change for the average Teabagger?</p>
<p>Will they have to get government approval to see a doctor? Well no. Will there be dramatic changes in their out of pocket expenses? Well no, if anything the change will be in the other direction. Will insurance or the hospital start denying them categories of care? Well no, same thing. The fact is that if you already have insurance, and from the looks of most of the Teabag crowd they already do, you will see zero change between now and November. At least negative change.</p>
<p>Will the passage of Obamacare put us on the path to Socialized Medicine? Well maybe, personally I believe that the changes in this bill will over the long-term drive change in that direction. But will anyone notice any big changes in the interim? Well no. And what changes they do notice will be positive, at least in the short run, because the sweeteners in the bill are front-loaded. More under the fold.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />I know a young bartender in a Chinese restaurant that has a congenital condition in her leg. Nothing particularly disabling but enough to prevent her from buying insurance in the private market, like almost everyone in the hospitality industry except workers in big hotels she is on her own, if she gets sick enough to need to see a doctor it means cash payment at the Walk-In Clinic or a trip 20 miles North to the only Free Clinic in our area. Now if she gets really sick she is lucky enough to live in a city where the two main hospitals are operated by the Sisters of Providence who have an excellent record of writing off the costs of hospital stays for those who can&#8217;t afford to pay, God Bless the Nuns, but unless that case of flu has progressed to pneumonia my bartender is relying on tips to pay off the doctor.</p>
<p>Well under this bill she has some near immediate options. It establishes a High Risk Pool plan which would allow her to buy insurance that would cover her congenital condition and any illness that would require hospitalization. Given her income level she might not be able to afford the unsubsidized premiums, but then she has family that would probably help if the interim, her Dad has a new job as a government lawyer in DC and could probably throw some dollars her way until the Exchange and its subsidies kick in, whereas right now she couldn&#8217;t get insurance coverage at any price. And she is not alone here, I am in that same category, insurance companies would simply laugh if I applied. Under this new bill and right away, if you apply for insurance through a private company and are denied, or are offered insurance at an unaffordable rate you will be eligible for the new High Risk Pool. Yes it will be expensive and no maybe you won&#8217;t be able to afford it normally but if it comes right down to it that insurance will be available. </p>
<p>I suppose there may be a teabagger or two who doesn&#8217;t know anyone in the position of my bartender friend or me, who doesn&#8217;t know someone working in a service job or at a store making too much to qualify for Medicaid but not enough to pay for insurance. Maybe some of these people have never walked past a collection jar on the counter raising funds for an otherwise unaffordable operation for some local kid, never heard an appeal for donations for a fellow church-goer, but somehow I doubt it, when you lower this to the concrete level it is not all about giving health care to brown people in the inner city, in fact many of those people have access to health care, it is about people they rub shoulders against every day.</p>
<p>The Republican Party is betting that its supporters will remain white-hot over an abstraction that will have little to zero impact on their own lives but will have huge positive impacts on people in their own communities. If you are middle class and insured you will probably see no changes at all in the next six months, on the other hand the waitress down at the cafe might be able to finally enroll in a health plan. Or you might finally be able to consider the possibility of an early retirement rather than holding onto your job waiting for Medicare to kick in. How long will Boehner and Beck, themselves wealthy white men with health care paid for, be able to whip people up over abstractions like &#8216;Obamacare&#8217; in the face of day to day reality?</p>

                                <p>by cactus</p>
<p>A Brief Review of Econned</p>
<p>I have read the first few chapters of <italic>Econned</italic> by Yves Smith, that&#8217;s about where I re-evaluate and decide whether its worth reading through the first 80% of the book. When the answer is yes, I usually re-evaluate the 80% mark.  As a result, I don&#8217;t always get all the way through a lot of books I pick up.  Time is a valuable commodity.</p>
<p>Anyway, I&#8217;ve gotten far enough to decide that not only is it worth going forward, I will be finishing this one.  I also believe I&#8217;ve gone far enough to know this book is worth recommending if you&#8217;re looking at a book to tell you about the causes of the Great Recession.  What I&#8217;ve seen so far &#8211; Smith covers a lot of ground that is well trodden, but she does it well, and smoothly, entertainingly, and she connects the dots.  Its fairly clear that a) the models of the world that much of the economics profession had were wrong (and here Smith pulls no punches &#8211; Paul Krugman, an ideological ally, is one of many targets) and b) many (most?) economists simply refuse to give up on models even if they don&#8217;t conform at all to the facts.  </p>
<p>Now, its impossible to avoid discussion of the people involved in making the meltdown process happen, and little bits of gossip are what make a book readable.  But unlike other books about the Great Recession I&#8217;ve picked up recently, such as David Wessel&#8217;s <italic>In Fed We Trust</italic>, Charles Gasparino&#8217;s <italic>The Sellout</italic>, and Andrew Ross Sorkin&#8217;s <italic>Too Big to Fail</italic>, the book is more about the ideas than the people, and more about what&#8217;s wrong with bad models or CDSs than the people peddling them. If you think knowing which big player puked on the way to which boardroom while Bear Stearns was imploding, or where a given CEO summered in 2008, this is probably not the book for you.  If you want a good idea of what happened to get us to the period from 2007 to 2009, this book will help you understand.  </p>
<p>In that regard, its like Barry Ritholtz&#8217; <italic>Bailout Nation</italic>, another book worth reading.  The difference is, Ritholtz&#8217; language is a bit more colorful, and <italic>Bailout Nation</italic> is the story of a bunch of crooks and idiots and idiot-crooks run wild.  Smith&#8217;s focus is more on the BS that pervades the economic profession that aided and abetted Ritholtz&#8217; bunch of crooks and idiots and idiot-crooks run wild.  The two books complement each other very nicely.</p>
