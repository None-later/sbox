                                <p>You may recall, during the 2004 elections one of the Republican selling points for GW was that he had created the mess in Afghanistan and Iraq:  &#8220;You don&#8217;t change horses in the middle of a stream.&#8221;  But what if the horse himself has moved on?  Well, via Steve Benen, another post on the <a href="http://www.thecarpetbaggerreport.com/archives/10082.html">Walter Reed Army Medical Center fiasco</a>, in which we learn what the administration does if the guy who made the mess is no longer there: you go find him and put him in charge of the, um, &#8220;cleanup.&#8221;  I foresee good things&#8230;</p>

                                <p>This post is by reader Ole Keynesian, expanding on one of his comments.  Can anyone answer the questions he raises?</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p>One reason that some environmental problems are so intractable in this globalized world is that we can&#8217;t accept the economic cost of fixing them.  Even sincere tree huggers will run the numbers on a Prius to calculate the payback, to decide if the environmental benefits are &#8220;worth it&#8221;.  <br />On the other hand, if you calculate the cost in terms of resources used rather than dollars (a more purely environmental cost/benefit analysis) it gets real complex real fast.  If you buy that Prius, you&#8217;ll save x number of gallons of gas over the life of the car.  But you&#8217;re going to trade your &#8217;74 Pinto for the Prius and the dealership is going to pay the junkyard $200 to take it off their hands.  If you could have driven your old car for 10 more years (thereby requiring one less Prius to be produced in the next decade), you are wasting more total resources just by buying the Prius than you will make up with reduced gasoline consumption.  If this is where the analysis stops, the earth is better off if you keep the Pinto.  But the analysis doesn&#8217;t have to stop there.  We can ask literally hundreds of questions that would suggest one choice or the other (again, assuming that cost isn&#8217;t a factor, only what&#8217;s best for the environment). <br />Let&#8217;s walk through a scenario that takes cost completely out of the equation.  It&#8217;s a choice faced by the Everyday Environmentalist all the time: should I recycle that empty peanut butter jar?<br />The conventional answer is yes, reuse is always better than disposal.  But the jar still has bits of peanut butter around the inside.  The literature from the county says that the recycler will reject any material with food waste on it &#8211; they&#8217;ll separate it and ship it to the landfill.  So I&#8217;ll fill the jar with a quart of hot, soapy water and clean it.  The water comes through a natural gas hot water heater which will have to (incrementally) fire up to get the rest of the tank back to its preset temperature.  More importantly, in my town the water comes from underground wells and is delivered to the house untreated.  In a world where 1 in 5 people do not have access to clean drinking water, this is like champagne flowing out of the tap.  After I clean the jar and put this quart of now cloudy water down the drain, it will flow through a couple of pump stations and end up at a treatment plant where it will be scrubbed and chlorinated, then ultimately deposited somewhere, and that somewhere will not be my town&#8217;s pristine aquifer. The peanut butter bits will become part of the treatment plant&#8217;s &#8220;sludge&#8221;, which may or may not have a secondary use as fertilizer.  I&#8217;ll have to run another half gallon of hot water over the label to loosen the glue enough to peel it off.  The recycler will reject a jar with a label, too.<br />At this point I&#8217;ve used three quarts of hot water and some phosphorus-laden dish soap on my recyclable jar, which has all gone through the county&#8217;s wastewater treatment system.  The jar then goes in the recycle bin and gets carted off on garbage day to the recycle station, where it will be inspected, sorted and crushed, using as much energy as that activity takes.  Is there a market for recycled crushed glass that day?  I hope so, or the recycler will ship it to the landfill and all our effort will be for naught.  If there is a market, the material gets carted off to the glass manufacturer, who will remelt and reshape it, using as much energy as that activity takes.<br />The alternative is to dump the dirty, labeled jar in the trash and let it go directly to the landfill.  No water use, no natural gas use, no phosphorous soap use, no wastewater treatment, no electricity for the recycler to inspect, sort and crush the glass.  Once in the landfill, the residual peanut butter will naturally degrade.  So will the glass jar, over time.  So will the paper label.  The glue could be a problem, depending on what types of chemicals are used to produce it, but I&#8217;m going to put the glue down the drain when I scrape the label off for recycling anyway, so maybe that&#8217;s a wash.  And there are at least three opportunities for my best recycling efforts to end up in the landfill anyway, if I don&#8217;t clean the jar well enough, or forget to steam the label off, or if there is no market for recycled glass today.<br />Does it take as much energy to remelt and reshape a new jar from recycled material as it did to create the original jar?  How would I find that out?<br />And how much does the equation change if my peanut butter jar is make out of recyclable plastic instead of glass?</p>

                                <p>I decided to follow up my morning post <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/03/fed-presidential-elections-and.html">showing changes in real M2 per capita look exactly like they would if the Fed were trying to influence Presidential elections</a> by looking at some of the reader comments.  </p>
<p>Spencer, in particular, made some useful comments.  I haven’t had the time to run through many of them, but here are two: 1) look at the one year (rather than the 3 months) change in real M2 per capita by month, and then 2) take the first difference of that to look at the rate at which the one year change in real M2 per capita itself changes.</p>
<p>The table below shows the 12 month percentage change in real M2 per capita (i.e., the change in M2 over and above (or under and below) the inflation rate and the change in the population) in each of the months leading up to and including November in years in which there is no presidential election, in years in which there is a presidential election but no incumbent.  It also shows the years in which there is a Presidential election and an incumbent, differentiating between whether the incumbent and the Fed Chairman come from the same or opposing parties.  Note that the category showing the fastest growth in real M2 per capita is colored green, and the category showing the slowest growth in real M2 per capita is colored orange.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/ReeNyfi0j6I/AAAAAAAAAGE/2LU_VxJtj_o/s1600-h/Fed+Independence+3,+Table+1.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/ReeNyfi0j6I/AAAAAAAAAGE/2LU_VxJtj_o/s320/Fed+Independence+3,+Table+1.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>With all due respect to those who have been insisting that the results are a coincidence or some random effect, I’m sorry but I just don’t see how that’s credible.  This is precisely, with zero deviation, the exact behavior in real M2 per capita we would expect if the Fed were trying to influence elections.  Output is rarely this cleancut.</p>
<p>Since data from the Fed became available in 1959, when there is a Presidential election involving an incumbent from the same party as Fed chairman, the year on year Money Supply (as measured by real M2 per capita) increases each and every month by more than when there is no election or when there is no incumbent.  By contrast, when there is a Prsidential election involving an incumbent from a party other than that of the Fed chairman, the year on year Money Supply decreases each and every month.  I don&#8217;t see how one can reach any conclusion other than that the Fed is meddling in Presidential Elections in a blatant and partisan way.</p>
<p>Spencer’s other suggestion doesn’t seem to help the story…  I’m not sure what it says.  Taking the one year percentage change of the one year percentage change (i.e., trying to see how the yearly percentage change in real M2 per capita is itself changing – looking for acceleration or deceleration), we get this:</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/ReeNuvi0j5I/AAAAAAAAAF8/hxi511uGt6Y/s1600-h/Fed+Independence+3,+Table+2.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/ReeNuvi0j5I/AAAAAAAAAF8/hxi511uGt6Y/s320/Fed+Independence+3,+Table+2.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>I’m honestly not certain how to interpret this.  The rapid growth in the third column in the months leading to an election, combined with the fact that in Table 1 the third column is always smaller than the other three, may indicate that a few months before the election, the Fed may start to worry it has overshot in its campaign of destruction against an incumbent from a different party.  (See the –14,887% change in March, which is an order of magnitude beyond the other large changes, which occur in April and February.)  But otherwise, I don’t think the second (percentage) difference is giving us much mileage here.</p>

                                <p>The 2006QIV preliminary estimate had real GDP (2000$) at $11,506.5 billion.  This compares to the $9887.7 billion as of 2000QIV.  So over the six years that George W. Bush has been President, cumulative real GDP growth has been only 16.37%, which translates into a 2.56% average annual growth rate.  Just something to think about when some Bush cheerleader says Bush&#8217;s tax cuts led to some alleged supply side miracle.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, the latest from the Bureau of Economic Analysis.  Prediction &#8211; the employment to population ratio will still be well below where it was when Bush took office.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p><a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2007_03/010835.php">Zachary Roth</a> has a nice compare and contrast on the views about perjury from certain GOP hacks.  My favorite was this:<br />
<blockquote>GOP Rep. Lindsey Graham (now Senator) on Clinton, 1998: &#8220;I believe it is a crime &#8211; it&#8217;s a high crime that should subject any president for removal.&#8221; Graham also served as one of the GOP&#8217;s managers of the impeachment case.  And on Libby, 2006: &#8220;When it came to the grand jury, he gave false testimony allegedly about his interaction. But the underlying charge that started this investigation never materialized.</p></blockquote>
<p>Clinton’s “crime” was adultery.  Lindsey is now saying that even if a crime were committed, the failure of a prosecutor to bring an indictment forward excuses all perjury and obstruction of justice efforts.  In other words if the obstruction works – no harm, no foul.  </p>
<p>But let’s go to <a href="http://www.firedoglake.com/2007/03/01/victorias-secret"> Traitorgate Central</a> for a link to the takedown of <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/16/AR2007021601705.html">Victoria Toensing</a> by <a href="http://noquarter.typepad.com/my_weblog/2007/02/victorias_secre.html">Jim Marcinkowski</a>.  All one really needs to do to understand why Ms. Toensing is full of BS is to read this:</p>
<blockquote><p>On Dec. 30, 2003, the day Fitzgerald was appointed special counsel, he should have known (all he had to do was ask the CIA) that Plame was not covert, knowledge that should have stopped the investigation right there. The law prohibiting disclosure of a covert agent&#8217;s identity requires that the person have a foreign assignment at the time or have had one within five years of the disclosure, that the government be taking affirmative steps to conceal the government relationship, and for the discloser to have actual knowledge of the covert status.</p></blockquote>
<p>Aha Victoria screams – Ms. Plame was not a covert agent so there could be no underlying crime.  But let’s recall who kept demanding that this outing be investigated.  It was none other than George Tenet – the Director of the CIA.  He knew Valerie Plame was a covert agent.  So we should all thank the lying piece of partisan garbage known as Victoria Toensing for pointing out that there was an underlying crime.  I guess Lindsey Graham for all of his huffing and puffing really doesn’t understand what perjury and obstruction of justice is all about.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: It would seem there have been more recent examples of White House <a href="http://www.firedoglake.com/2007/03/01/breakin-the-law-breakin-the-law-breakin-the-law">perjury</a>.  But since this one was over the firing of prosecutors, why would anyone in the White House fear that they’ll have to face charges for this one?</p>

<blockquote><p>Thus trade helps Americans provide for their families. When special interests seek protection in the name of low-wage workers, we should acknowledge that limitations on imports do not benefit the vast majority of Americans. They deny people the freedom to choose from a broader array of goods and services, and impose a cruel tax on people who rely on low prices to stretch their family budgets. The cost of protectionism falls most heavily on those who are least able to afford it – the poor and the elderly.</p></blockquote>
<p>Greg notes that Paulson avoids:</p>
<blockquote><p>the mercantilist rhetoric all too common in Washington, actually says nice things about buying goods from abroad</p></blockquote>
<p>I trust Greg won’t see raising the Stopler-Samuelson theorem as mercantilist rhetoric.  Formally put, this theorem states that an increase in the price of a good will cause an increase in the price of the factor used intensively in that industry and a decrease in the price of the other factor. In layman’s terms – while trade protection may raise the price of imported goods, it could also tend to raise the wages for workers in the import competing sector.  So it is not clear from the Treasury Secretary’s remarks whether the working poor are hurt or helped by free trade.  But let’s be fair to Secretary Paulson by noting a few other things that he said:</p>
<blockquote><p>I understand that our dynamic economy, while generating wealth and opportunities for advancement and increasing our nation&#8217;s standard of living, does create dislocations and anxiety. Change can be difficult, and our economy seems to be changing ever more rapidly. As one of the sources of economic dynamism, expanding trade does result in some job losses and contributes to this sense of anxiety.</p></blockquote>
<p>I tend to agree with most of Secretary Paulson’s remarks – in part because he was not so dogmatic that free trade benefits everyone.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: AB reader Divorced one like Bush directs us to <a href="http://www.epinet.org/content.cfm/ib223">Jared Bernstein and Josh Bivens</a> and their <em>The Wal-Mart debate: A false choice between prices and wages</em>:<br />
<blockquote>The benefits and costs of Wal-Mart&#8217;s expansion across the United States have been hotly debated. Critics of the retailer have documented the extent to which Wal-Mart uses its market power to undermine its workers&#8217; compensation, squeezing suppliers and hurting local economies along the way. Supporters of Wal-Mart counter that the lower prices offered by the company more than compensate U.S. consumers for any depressing effect the company&#8217;s expansion has on wages &#8230; A key concern in the debate over the economic consequences of Wal-Mart&#8217;s expansion is the effect this has on workers&#8217; wages. Most would grant that prices are lower at Wal-Mart than in many competing stores (although the magnitude of this price difference is often less than implied by company defenders). A critical question, however, is whether the benefits of lower prices are implicitly clawed back when Wal-Mart drives down wages not just of its own workers, but throughout the retail sector as a whole.  Dube (2005) and Neumark (2005), in papers reviewed in Wrestling With Wal-Mart, present strong evidence that Wal-Mart&#8217;s expansion has driven down earnings for workers not just in competing retailers, but across stores throughout the region of Wal-Mart expansion.</p></blockquote>
<p>It would seem Stopler-Samuelson is more than a theoretical idea.</p>

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Last week, I noted that by some odd coincidence, <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/02/fed-presidential-elections-and.html">changes in real M2 per capita look exactly like they would if the Fed were trying to influence Presidential elections</a>.  I noted that if one assumed that the Fed wanted to influence elections, it was more likely to favor incumbents.  This is partly because the incumbent was likely to have appointed or re-appointed the Fed Chairman and other Fed board members, and partly because the most of the Presidents and most Fed Chairmen in the sample were Republicans.  </p>
<p>Continuing on the search for coincidences… whether or not the Fed appears to favor an incumbent might well depend on whether the Fed Chairman is from the same party as the incumbent.  If the Fed Chairman were biased (and presumably the board would be biased in the same way), he might seek to benefit incumbents from his own party, be neutral when there are no Presidential elections or no incumbent is running, and might be unfavorably disposed toward incumbents from a different party.  This would manifest itself as follows:  in the months leading up to November in which there is a Presidential election and the incumbent is from the same party as the Fed Chairman, Money Supply will increase more than in years when there is no election or no incumbent, and the Money Supply will increase the least (or decrease the most) in those same months in which there is an election in which there is an incumbent President from a different party than the Fed Chairman.  </p>
<p>The table below shows the 3 month percentage change in real M2 per capita (i.e., the change in M2 over and above (or under and below) the inflation rate and the change in the population) in each of the months leading up to and including November in years in which there is no presidential election, in years in which there is a presidential election but no incumbent.  It also shows the years in which there is a Presidential election and an incumbent, differentiating between whether the incumbent and the Fed Chairman come from the same or opposing parties.  Note that the category showing the fastest growth in real M2 per capita is colored green, and the category showing the slowest growth in real M2 per capita is colored orange.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RebUmvi0j4I/AAAAAAAAAFs/jay-EIWoXaA/s1600-h/Fed+Independence,+2nd+pass,+Table+1.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RebUmvi0j4I/AAAAAAAAAFs/jay-EIWoXaA/s320/Fed+Independence,+2nd+pass,+Table+1.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>The Fed’s behavior seems to very closely approximate what one might predict if one believed the Fed was biased and acting on its biases.  (The coincidences are starting to get very big.)  In 9 of the 10 months leading up to and including November, the growth rate in real M2 per capita is fastest when there is an election involving an incumbent coming from the same party as the Fed Chair.  (Clearly, there is a limit to how long the Fed thinks its necessary to goose things along for someone they like – it seems that limit is about ten months since the effect isn’t there in January or December.)  Similarly, for growth rates in real M2 per capita are smallest (and usually negative) when the upcoming election involves an incumbent from a different party than the Fed Chair.</p>
<p>Now, it is true there are very few observations, especially where the Fed Chair and the incumbent are from different parties.  But as the chart above shows, the correlation between the increase in the Money Supply from one month to the next is not very high, so in fact, each month could reasonably construed as a separate observation, in which case the number of observations is no longer very small.  </p>
<p>Which leads to the coincidence explanation.  This requires believing that its just happenstance that the odds are strangely high that the Fed has to (1) fight recessions recession right before an election in which the incumbent is from a different party than the Fed chair and (2) worry about liquidity crunches right before an election in which the Fed chair and the incumbent are from the same party.  </p>
<p>But believing in coincidences is a good thing.  Otherwise, it would be a sign that the Fed is not independent, and that perhaps words like “illegal” and “unlawful” apply to what we seem to observe.</p>

<p>Update&#8230;  If you&#8217;re reading this and wondering what the problem is&#8230; from <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/generalinfo/faq/faqfrs.htm#5">the Fed&#8217;s own FAQ</a>:</p>
<p>&#8220;The intent of Congress in shaping the Federal Reserve Act was to keep politics out of monetary policy. The System is independent of other branches and agencies of government. It is self-financed and therefore is not subject to the congressional budgetary process.&#8221;</p>

<blockquote>As for the Fed, we&#8217;d feel better if current Chairman Ben Bernanke had been running a tighter monetary policy for the last year; it might have left him with more policy room if the economy does turn sour. As it is, any easing now runs the risk of a dollar rout, which could lead to an even larger loss of confidence and selloff. The current problems in the housing credit markets owe a great deal already to the Fed&#8217;s mistake in keeping monetary policy too easy for too long during the late Greenspan era. We now have to ride them out, and Mr. Bernanke shouldn&#8217;t make them worse with a panicky, premature easing.</p></blockquote>
<p>Because interest rates did not rise even higher, the FED has no room to lower them now?  Do these fools realize that the reason the Greenspan FED kept interest rates low was to reverse the business investment slump?  Or do they think there are different financial markets for business versus residential investment?  I’m glad Chairman Ben is running the show and not these clowns.</p>

                                <p>With a hat tip to <a href="http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/002887.html#more">Barkley</a>, let’s check out what <a href="http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/IB28Ak01.html">Pepe Escobar</a> writes about those Iraqi production sharing agreements:<br />
<blockquote>On Monday, Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki&#8217;s cabinet in Baghdad approved the draft of the new Iraqi oil law. The government regards it as &#8220;a major national project&#8221;. The key point of the law is that Iraq&#8217;s immense oil wealth (115 billion barrels of proven reserves, third in the world after Saudi Arabia and Iran) will be under the iron rule of a fuzzy &#8220;Federal Oil and Gas Council&#8221; boasting &#8220;a panel of oil experts from inside and outside Iraq&#8221;. That is, nothing less than predominantly US Big Oil executives. The law represents no less than institutionalized raping and pillaging of Iraq&#8217;s oil wealth. It represents the death knell of nationalized (from 1972 to 1975) Iraqi resources, now replaced by production sharing agreements (PSAs) &#8211; which translate into savage privatization and monster profit rates of up to 75% for (basically US) Big Oil. Sixty-five of Iraq&#8217;s roughly 80 oilfields already known will be offered for Big Oil to exploit &#8230; Nobody wants to colonial-style PSAs forced down their throat anymore. According to the International Energy Agency, PSAs apply to only 12% of global oil reserves, in cases where costs are very high and nobody knows what will be found (certainly not the Iraqi case). No big Middle Eastern oil producer works with PSAs. Russia and Venezuela are renegotiating all of them. Bolivia nationalized its gas. Algeria and Indonesia have new rules for future contracts. But Iraq, of course, is not a sovereign country. Big Oil is obviously ecstatic &#8211; not only ExxonMobil, but also ConocoPhillips, Chevron, BP and Shell (which have collected invaluable info on two of Iraq&#8217;s biggest oilfields), TotalFinaElf, Lukoil from Russia and the Chinese majors. Iraq has as many as 70 undeveloped fields &#8211; &#8220;small&#8221; ones hold a minimum of a billion barrels. As desert western Iraq has not even been exploited, reserves may reach 300 billion barrels &#8211; way more than Saudi Arabia. Gargantuan profits under the PSA arrangement are in a class by themselves. Iraqi oil costs only US$1 a barrel to extract. With a barrel worth $60 and up, happy days are here again.</p></blockquote>
<p>Barkley challenges the claim that extraction costs are only $1 a barrel:<br />
<blockquote>I note that Escobar&#8217;s article has some errors in it, including the ridiculous claim that it only costs $1 per barrel to pump oil in Iraq. It is up to $3 per barrel in Saudi Arabia, so, while there are still huge profits at $60 per barrel for crude, $1 per barrel is an understatement, raising some questions about Escobar&#8217;s general credibility.</p></blockquote>
<p>Having no idea as to Mr. Escobar’s accuracy or credibility on this topic, his entire discussion should be fact checked.  But Barkley’s general point about the lack of coverage of this story by the media is valid.  I guess covering Anna Nicole Smith’s departure is more important to folks like <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2007/02/27/gibson-thinkprogress">John Gibson</a>.</p>

                                <p>The Bureau of Economic Analysis released its Preliminary Report for the <a href="http://www.bea.gov/newsreleases/national/gdp/2007/gdp406p.htm">Fourth Quarter of 2006</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Real gross domestic product &#8211; the output of goods and services produced by labor and property located in the United States &#8211; increased at an annual rate of 2.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2006, according to preliminary estimates released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis.  In the third quarter, real GDP increased 2.0 percent. The GDP estimates released today are based on more complete source data than were available for the advance estimates issued last month.  In the advance estimates, the increase in real GDP was 3.5 percent &#8230; The increase in real GDP in the fourth quarter primarily reflected positive contributions from personal consumption expenditures (PCE), exports, state and local government spending, and federal government spending that were partly offset by negative contributions from private inventory investment and residential fixed investment.  Imports, which are a subtraction in the calculation of GDP, decreased.</p></blockquote>
<p>The annualized growth rate for investment demand was negative 15.6% with the decline in residential investment leading the way.  Consumption growth was reported at 4.2% and the growth rate for government purchases was reported at 3.3%.  So with consumption and government purchases growing faster than real GDP, classical economists can talk about reduced national savings – while Keynesians might note that this reduced national savings kept things from getting worse. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D8NIOTI80.htm">Jeannine Aversa</a> writes:<br />
<blockquote>The economy grew at a sluggish 2.2 percent pace in the final quarter of last year, much slower than initially estimated, the government reported Wednesday in the sort of unusually large revision that has happened only seven times in the last 30 years. The latest reading on the gross domestic product released by by the Commerce Department came a day after stocks on Wall Street and around the globe took a nosedive and showed the economy in a considerably weaker state than the government first estimated. It had initially reported the expansion in the last three months of 2006 to be at a 3.5 percent pace. The principal reason for the new, significantly lower estimate: Businesses tightened their belts amid fallout from the troubled housing and automative sectors.</p></blockquote>
<p>Jeannine found one optimistic economist:<br />
<blockquote>Ken Mayland, president of ClearView Economics likened the fourth-quarter&#8217;s showing as part of a &#8220;mid-course breather&#8221; reflecting a period of temporary listlessness, not a slide toward recession. &#8220;I think it is unfolding as a slowdown, not a turndown &#8211; meaning recession,&#8221; he said.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let’s hope Ken Mayland is correct but just in case – I’m jumping on the bandwagon calling for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://www.usnews.com/usnews/biztech/capitalcommerce/070228/dont_use_the_market_to_predict.htm#more">James Pethokoukis</a> has lately been emailing his pieces to economist bloggers.  I usually just ignore them, but today’s is timely if not misguided<br />
<blockquote>Does Wall Street&#8217;s swoon mean there&#8217;s a recession on the way? I think JPMorgan economist Jim Glassman summed up the current situation pretty well to me late yesterday: &#8220;The question is, does a recession seem a plausible scenario in the current circumstances &#8230; with inflation near post-World War II lows, corporate profit margins at record highs, an unprecedented global awakening underway, financial signals [credit spreads] still at good-time lows? Please!&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Why Pethokoukis would turn to James “DOW 36000” Glassman is beyond me &#8211; but he does acknowledge the news from the BEA.  Pethokoukis goes onto to say:<br />
<blockquote>The GDP report wasn&#8217;t all bad. Although everyone has been worried about the consumer–because of the housing slowdown and the subprime mortgage market meltdown–the GDP report showed personal consumption expenditures contributing 2.9 percentage points to the GDP growth rate. Overall, consumer spending–taking into account rising prices–increased 4.2 percent in the fourth quarter</p></blockquote>
<p>Everyone has been worried that consumption demand would turn weak?  I guess Pethokoukis doesn’t read our blog very much!  Pethokoukis also goes onto to talk about the allegedly strong job market (don’t get me started as I have more to say on Friday), the allegedly exploding tax revenues, and strong corporate profits.  Alas, the news from BEA today was that investment demand had declined – in spite of all those profits.  At one point, Pethokoukis noted:<br />
<blockquote>Yet one would have to be Dr. Pangloss to not somewhat fretfully wonder what the future holds given the stock market&#8217;s big plunge</p></blockquote>
<p>Fine, I have neither Pangloss’s baseless optimism nor a single focus on the stock market.  But maybe Pethokoukis should change his first name from James to Pollyanna.</p>
<p><strong>Update II</strong>: Thanks to the AB reader for letting me know that I made a big mistake.  <a href="http://cber.uark.edu/busfor/default.asp?show=2006">James E. Glassman</a> is managing director and senior policy strategist with J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and is not the same person as James K. Glassman.</p>
