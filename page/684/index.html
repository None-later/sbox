                                                                    </div>

                                <p><a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2008_03/013288.php">Kevin Drum</a> finds a few past examples for this possibility:</p>
<blockquote><p>Is John McCain really likely to use these attacks in TV ads during the general election? I couldn&#8217;t think of any examples of this from past elections, so I asked the hive mind if they could think of any &#8230; are there any examples of general election candidates using primary criticisms as part of their own campaign? The short answer is yes, but apparently not very recently and not very often.</p></blockquote>
<p>He found a few with the last two from the 1980 campaign.  We’ll return to George H. W. Bush’s voodoo economics but first let’s listen to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErosyL95VqA">this video</a> of Ted Kennedy that was used by a group called Democrats for Reagan. A little historical context.  The 1980 campaign was run with the backdrop of the 1980 recession, which was brought on by the high interest rate policies of the Volcker FED.  These policies were designed to bring down inflation.  Not every Democrat agreed with this policy. James Tobin was particularly bothered by the use of a recession to reduce inflation.  We all watched the Republicans grasp the mantle of full employment promising to restore aggregate demand through a tax cut.</p>
<p>I had thought Senator Kennedy’s condemnation of high interest rates was along the same lines.  But listen again – he is also complaining about high inflation.  In defense of the Volcker FED – had we pursued policies to substantially increase aggregate demand, inflation might have stayed high.  Which bring us back to voodoo economics.  As Kevin notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>George Bush&#8217;s &#8220;voodoo economics&#8221; line against Reagan was used by Carter and others. It didn&#8217;t show up in an ad, as far as I can tell, but during Carter&#8217;s October 29 debate with Reagan he said, &#8220;Governor Reagan recently mentioned the Reagan-Kemp-Roth proposal, which his own running mate, George Bush, described as &#8216;voodoo economics&#8217; and said that it would result in a 30 percent inflation rate.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I had always thought the Reaganites were promising too much when they claimed that we could restore full employment and low inflation at the same time.  James Tobin often ridiculed this claim.  Now we did see inflation come down quite quickly but that’s due to the 1982 recession and the only gradual return to full employment over the two terms that Reagan served as President.  This speech is probably not one of Ted Kennedy’s finer moments – to say the least.</p>

                                <p>OK, we did have one nutcase toss a bomb at a military recruiting station near Grand Central Station.  But that was at 3:45 AM and no one was hurt.  <a href="http://stateoftheday.blogspot.com/2008/03/john-mccain-americas-neighborhoods-are.html">State of the Day</a> catches John McCain saying this:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;There are problems in America with safe neighborhoods&#8221; just like Baghdad. Watch it (and watch how he catches himself, but still can&#8217;t put the genie back in the bottle).  Funny, I was just reading about the rash of car bombs, suicide bombers, and headless homicides here in city. Maybe it&#8217;s time for a &#8220;surge&#8221; in Manhattan too.</p></blockquote>
<p>Darn – I thought my new neighborhood was safe.  I thought Mayor Bloomberg and the NYC police were doing a great job.  If McCain is right, we’ll need a lot of help from the Federal government.  But how to pay for the surge of security forces in NYC if a President McCain doesn’t want to raise taxes?  Never mind the costs of all those new wars that a President McCain will bring us.</p>

<blockquote><p>On Social Security, the Arizona senator says he still backs a system of private retirement accounts that President Bush pushed unsuccessfully, and disowned details of a Social Security proposal on his campaign Web site.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=ZTQ4NjJhZmRkNGE2MmE0OWUxNDEyMDMzY2I2ODQ5NGQ=">Ramesh Ponnuru</a> notes the change in McCain’s position:<br />
<blockquote>He was for the personal savings accounts Bush wanted; his campaign website says that he wants accounts that &#8220;supplement&#8221; Social Security rather than being carved out from it; and he says he still wants personal savings accounts.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is true but then Ponnuru makes one of the most uninformed comments on this issue that I have ever read:</p>
<blockquote><p> But the distinction between accounts that are &#8220;add-ons&#8221; versus &#8220;carve-outs&#8221; is pretty meaningless, and I don&#8217;t think it is wrong of the candidate to ignore it.</p></blockquote>
<p>At least <a href="http://voxbaby.blogspot.com/2006/06/carveouts.html">Andrew Samwick</a> understands the difference between the carve-out proposal and the add-on proposal.  No one who remotely understands the Social Security debate would claim that the distinction between add-ons and carve-outs is meaningless.  Then again – Ponnuru was writing over at the National Review’s The Corner where completely uninformed commentary appears to be the rule.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Uga Bardi at the <a href="http://europe.theoildrum.com/node/3551#more">Oildrum</a> has written an excellent piece,&#8221;The Cassandra Curse: How  <i>The Limits to Growth was Demonized</i>,&#8221; tracing the reception of this seminal work from the time of its publication (1972) to the present day. We all are acquainted with its predecessor, Thomas Malthus&#8217; &#8220;An Essay on the Principle of Population.&#8221;</p>
<p>As a boy, I thought Malthus was essentially correct: The earth can feed only so many. Of course, Malthus would never have expected us to be so successful for so long.</p>
<p>I remember a <i>Star Trek</i> piece where the unfortunate Captain Kirk was imprisoned on a massively overpopulated planet, the inhabitants of which enjoyed perfect health in a perfectly crowded hell. In usual science fiction fashion, Bixby had taken one question&#8211;What if we had perfect health and immortality?&#8211;and set its consequences against exponential population growth. In my naiveté , I kept asking: Where were the bathrooms? This planet had people standing cheek to jowl!  How did they move? Where do they grow stuff? But then, of course, the <i>Enterprise</i> had that marvelous transmutation device.  Matter could simply be transformed. And the energy cost? Those mysterious crystals in the ship&#8217;s core handled that.</p>
<p>Infinite growth may be the stuff only of science fiction, bad writing, and bad acting&#8230;with lots of liberally sprinkled fairy dust.  Yet, today, are we ignoring those limits at our peril? How much fairy dust do we have left?</p>
<p>The usual rebuttal to Malthus or to the MIT authors of <i>The Limits to Growth</i> is: &#8220;Well, they were wrong in their predictions! Look at us: Partying on, dude!&#8221; But one wise commentator, Big Gav, on the Oildrum threat noted the following:<br />
<blockquote>Reminds me of a time when I was part of an academic workshop and brought up Limits to Growth with one of my colleagues (who I really like and respect) and he blurted out &#8220;but they got all their predictions wrong.&#8221; I just stopped in my tracks, dumbfounded, because I had just read the book and it appeared to have done just the opposite: not making any &#8220;firm&#8221; predictions, while still developing frightening scenarios that looked eerily familiar when reading the news.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, the MIT authors made no concrete predictions; they set no dates for Armageddon or our eventual comeuppance. They did, however, state a time frame: the 21st century.</p>
<p>What interested me most in Bardi&#8217;s piece were the four groups that the Italian economist Georgio Nebbia identified as constitutionally critical of the idea of any limits to growth:</p>
<ol>
<li>Businesses and industries who saw the idea as a threat to their continued growth</li>
<li>Professional economists who saw LTG as a threat to their dominance in advising on economic matters</li>
<li>The Catholic Church with its opposition to birth control</li>
<li>The Liberal Left that saw the LTG study as a scam of the ruling class, designed to trick workers into believing that the proletarian paradise was not a practical goal</li>
</ol>
<p>The first group, business leaders, is easy to understand. Business is predicated on growth. The stock market trembles when profits are stagnant. The Fed worries about recession. Credit is eased; interest rates are lowered to promote investment and continued growth.</p>
<p>Armies of economists are summoned; arguments erupt from the right and from the left on how to make the train go faster. More arguments erupt if the train even hints of slowing. Who is to blame? How much ink and paper has been expanded on the causes of the latest slowdown?</p>
<p>All of which explains the second group, the economists. Livelihoods and professorships are at stake. They are the foot soldiers.</p>
<p>In the third group, the Catholic Church, I would include the religious right or any group that looks on birth control as fundamentally against God&#8217;s law. This group believes that God has ordained us to multiply&#8211;apparently to infinity&#8211;and prosper. Besides, you can &#8220;swamp&#8221; the religious opposition through sheer numbers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Prosper,&#8221; how neatly that word fits into the language of the first two groups. Business prospers when there are more customers.</p>
<p>Clearly, an individual in any one of these groups might not personally believe in the aims of any of the others. Many business leaders and economists would support birth control. Some religious leaders would cry out against Mammon and greed. There is in-fighting and disagreements among them. But when we step back and look at the broader picture, they all share the same belief; they all are in the same army. All believe that continued, exponential growth is possible. Each brings to that conviction elements that aid the aims of the others.</p>
<p>The fourth and last group, the Liberal Left, has a role to play as well. It offers hope to those being left behind as the system becomes distorted, as more and more wealth is accumulated at the top. While it may disagree with the Church on birth control or even in its brand of theism, it does share the Church&#8217;s concern for the great underclass. We can save these people; we can make their lives better. Prosperity is a practical goal for all.</p>
<p>I hear all these voices every day&#8230;on every blog. I remember asking Jim Hamilton if zero growth was viable. He answered, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; I wonder if he would be happy with zero growth; would anyone be happy with zero growth? And what in this world or any other does it look like?</p>

                                <p>Consider the widget making industry.  Say for about ten years or so, they are able to produce a new type of widgets.  This new type of widget is extremely profitable &#8211; its made from shoddy equipment, but a large proportion of consumers are willing to pay premium prices for these new class of widgets.</p>
<p>After about ten years, some buyers start to sour on the new class of widgets&#8230; and the demand for widgets collapses.  Of course, the solution is obvious:  either cut the price of the shoddily produced widgets (by a lot), or raise their quality (by a lot), or both.  But widget makers don&#8217;t want to this &#8211; they got addicted to easy profits, after all, and cutting the price or raising the quality of widgets would be unprofitable.  </p>
<p>Widget makers, good capitalists that they are, are normally against bail-outs, but this case is different.  This case, they say, can screw up the entire economy.  Besides&#8230; the problem, as they see it, is one of liquidity.  They just have to ride out a rough patch and then consumers will go back to buying these expensive, low quality widgets.</p>
<p>And if you&#8217;re wondering, yes, this parable is about the sub-prime loan mess.  And about housing.  And Chrysler.  And the S&#038;L crisis.  And junk bonds.  Also, LTCM, Refco, WorldCom, Enron, and a whole host of other problems.  A few of the words change, as does the  degree of intentional fraud, bad judgment, and poor luck.  Another thing that changes is the degree to which taxpayers get left holding the bag.  However, all in all, the mess is generally about the same, as are the cries for bail-out.</p>

<blockquote><p>The FBI acknowledged it improperly accessed Americans&#8217; telephone records, credit reports and Internet traffic in 2006, the fourth straight year of privacy abuses resulting from investigations aimed at tracking terrorists and spies.<br />The breach occurred before the FBI enacted broad new reforms in March 2007 to prevent future lapses, FBI Director Robert Mueller said Wednesday. <em>And it was caused, in part, by banks, telecommunication companies and other private businesses giving the FBI more personal client data than was requested.</em><br />Testifying at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, Mueller raised the issue of the FBI&#8217;s controversial use of so-called national security letters in reference to an upcoming report on the topic by the Justice Department&#8217;s inspector general.</p>
<p>An audit by the inspector general last year found the FBI demanded personal records without official authorization or otherwise collected more data than allowed in dozens of cases between 2003 and 2005. Additionally, last year&#8217;s audit found that the FBI had underreported to Congress how many national security letters were requested by more than 4,600.</p>
<p>The new audit, which examines use of national security letters issued in 2006, &#8220;will identify issues similar to those in the report issued last March,&#8221; Mueller told senators. The privacy abuse &#8220;predates the reforms we now have in place,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are committed to ensuring that we not only get this right, but maintain the vital trust of the American people,&#8221; Mueller said. He offered no additional details about the upcoming audit.</p>
<p>National security letters, as outlined in the USA Patriot Act, are administrative subpoenas used in suspected terrorism and espionage cases. They allow the FBI to require telephone companies, Internet service providers, banks, credit bureaus and other businesses to produce highly personal records about their customers or subscribers without a judge&#8217;s approval.</p>
<p>Last year&#8217;s audit by Justice Department Inspector General Glenn A. Fine, issued March 9, 2007, blamed agent error and shoddy record-keeping for the bulk of the problems and did not find any indication of criminal misconduct. Fine&#8217;s latest report is expected to be released as early as next week.</p>
<p>Several Justice Department and FBI officials familiar with the upcoming 2006 findings have said privately the new audit will show national security letters were used incorrectly at a similar rate as during the previous three years.</p>
<p>The number of national security letters issued by the FBI skyrocketed in the years after the Patriot Act became law in 2001, according to last year&#8217;s report. Fine&#8217;s annual review is required by Congress, over the objections of the Bush administration.</p>
<p>In 2005, for example, Fine&#8217;s office found more than 1,000 violations within 19,000 FBI requests to obtain 47,000 records. Each letter issued may contain several requests.</p>
<p>In contrast to the strong concerns expressed by Congress and civil liberties groups after last year&#8217;s inspector general&#8217;s report was issued, Mueller&#8217;s disclosure drew no criticism from senators during just over two hours of testimony Wednesday.</p>
<p>Speaking before the FBI chief, Senate Judiciary Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., urged Mueller to be more vigilant in correcting what he called &#8220;widespread illegal and improper use of national security letters.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Everybody wants to stop terrorists. But we also, though, as Americans, we believe in our privacy rights and we want those protected,&#8221; Leahy said. &#8220;There has to be a better chain of command for this. You cannot just have an FBI agent who decides he&#8217;d like to obtain Americans&#8217; records, bank records or anything else and do it just because they want to.&#8221;</p>
<p>Following last year&#8217;s audit, the Justice Department enacted guidelines that sternly reminded FBI agents to carefully follow the rules governing national security letters. The new rules caution agents to review all data before it is transferred into FBI databases to make sure that only the information specifically requested is used.</p>
<p>Fine&#8217;s upcoming report also credits the FBI with putting the additional checks in place to make sure privacy rights aren&#8217;t violated, according to a Justice official familiar with its findings.</p>
<p>Critics seized on Mueller&#8217;s testimony as proof that a judge should sign off on the national security letters before they are issued.</p>
<p>&#8220;The credibility factor shows there needs to be outside oversight,&#8221; said former FBI agent Michael German, now a national security adviser for the American Civil Liberties Union. He also cast doubt on the FBI&#8217;s reforms.</p>
<p>&#8220;There were guidelines before, and there were laws before, and the FBI violated those laws,&#8221; German said. &#8220;And the idea that new guidelines would make a difference, I think cuts against rationality.&#8221;(italics mine)</p></blockquote>
<p>My own experience and reading appears to confirm Michael German&#8217;s viewpoint for the FBI as an institution. For the last fifty years.<br />___</p>

<blockquote><p>But former Republican colleague Dan Cronin said the presidential candidate&#8217;s campaign of bold change doesn&#8217;t square with his past.  &#8220;There were no bold solutions; there were no creative approaches; there were no efforts to stand up to the establishment,&#8221; said Cronin, a member of the Illinois General Assembly since 1990, and now a member of White House hopeful John McCain&#8217;s Illinois Leadership Team.</p></blockquote>
<p>Cronin is campaigning for McCain and Lotian puts forth this attack in a story about Obama?  When <a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/182362.php">Josh Marshall</a> first covered this story, I wonder if the line about Cronin being part of the <a href="http://weblogs.baltimoresun.com/news/politics/blog/2007/11/roskam_fitzgerald_join_mccain.html">John McCain&#8217;s Illinois Leadership Team</a> was in the original version of this story.</p>

                                <p>Having infected the municipal bond market, the subprime disaster may soon spread into the student loan program. (Hat tip: Acheson). The <a href="http://www.pheaa.org/about/media/2008/February_21_08.shtml">Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency</a><br />
<blockquote>convened an emergency Student Loan Funding Summit today, bringing together a diverse group of state and federal government, higher education and financial leaders to address a potentially devastating shortage of student loan funding for students and families.<br />This student loan funding crisis began with the recent subprime mortgage meltdown and subsequent turmoil in the capital markets. These far-reaching economic problems have now given rise to a new bond market crisis, which is further compounding the funding problem for many lenders.<br />As a result, lenders throughout the nation are exiting the $50 billion Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP) while others are being forced to curtail their activity, seriously jeopardizing the funding plans of millions of American students. In recent weeks:
<ul>
<li>College Loan Corp, the nation’s eighth largest student lender, ended its participation in the FFELP program.</li>
<li>Iowa Student Loan Liquidity Corp announced that it is unable to properly fund loans for the 2008-09 school year.</li>
<li>Michigan suspended one of its college loan programs.</li>
<li>Montana&#8217;s student loan agency tried unsuccessfully to sell $583 million in bonds during the last ten days, which means it will be more difficult for the agency to make student loans.</li>

<p>PHEAA, itself, experienced &#8220;failed auctions&#8221; in the troubled bond market for the first time in its history, substantially increasing its cost of borrowing and putting its ability to fund additional student loans at risk.<br />&#8220;As many Americans face foreclosure on their homes, millions of college students may now face foreclosure on their plans for a higher education,&#8221; said State Representative William F. Adolph, Chairman of the PHEAA Board of Directors. &#8220;We must act quickly and we must act now &#8211; before our students are caught in a painful student aid funding crunch that could put their college plans financially out of reach.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>More education has been the answer many have given for our becoming more competitive in the global workplace. If millions of students find college out of financial reach, then that answer may soon disappear.</p>

                            </p>
                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p><a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2008/03/20080307-3.html">Dana Perino and Edward Lazear</a> were sent out by the White House to tell the press that there was more good news in the jobs report than bad news:</p>
<blockquote><p>The jobs report contains a variety of information in it, and one of the pieces of information, and only one of the pieces is the jobs number. In addition to that, there are also numbers on unemployment, wage growth and weekly hours. And it&#8217;s important to recognize that those numbers were actually good numbers; the unemployment rate actually went down; the wages continued to grow; and weekly hours stayed stable. All of those things are strong indicators that the economy is continuing to move.</p></blockquote>
<p>We noted that the dip in the unemployment rate masks the fact that the household survey showed an even more significant drop in employment (see <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/03/weaker-jobs-market.html">here</a> and <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/03/white-house-celebrates-decline-in.html">here</a>).  <a href="http://www.econbrowser.com/archives/2008/03/three_pictures_1.html">Menzie Chinn</a> has some impressive charts that show that both the payroll and household surveys show employment falling over the past few months.  </p>
<p>So we are to the claim that wages are rising.  Nominal wages are indeed rising but at a slower rate than are consumer prices.  Real wages have been falling and it turns out that the net change in the real wage rate for production and nonsupervisory workers over the past five years is zero.  Edward Lazear gets this point but it would seem that the White House thinks it is appropriate to send these two out to just flat out lie to the press.  OK, we are used to the fact that Bush’s press secretary lies to the press on a daily basis, but the Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers should avoid this behavior.</p>
<p>Footnote: If you are wondering about weekly hours, it did stay stable at 33.7 hours.  This compares to 34.2 hours as of January 2001. At worse since then, it bottomed at 33.6 hours.  So why Crazy Eddie even bothered to mention this as great news beats me.</p>
