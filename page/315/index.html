<p><strong>Extension Bill and Carried Interest: American Jobs, Closing Tax Loopholes and Preventing Outsourcing Act of 2010</strong> [<a target="_blank" href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/"><strong>Ataxingmatter</strong></a> is back online after a break for the Chicago Law and Society Conference]</p>
<p>Last Friday, the House passed the extenders bill, HR 4213, the American Jobs, Closing Tax Loopholes and Preventing Outsourcing Act of 2010, by a 215 to 204 vote.  The bill includes only tax and revenue provisions, extending various  business and individual tax breaks and paying for those with a number of controversial revenue raisers.  The Joint Committee on Taxation&#8217;s &#8220;estimated revenue effects&#8221; (JCX-30-10, May 28, 2010) for the bill is <a target="_blank" href="http://www.jct.gov/publications.html?func=startdown&#038;id=3685">here</a>.  The JCT &#8220;Technical Explanation&#8221; (JCX-29-10, May 28, 2010) is <a target="_blank" href="http://www.jct.gov/publications.html?func=startdown&#038;id=3684">here</a>.</p>
<p>The extenders include various energy incentives including benefits for energy and oil companies (e.g., suspending the limitation on percentage depletion for oil and gas from marginal wells, which allows independent producers and royalty owners to deduct 15% of their gross income up front, even if that amount exceeds 100% of their net income; allowing mine companies to expense safety equipment), a number of ongoing tax expenditures for business (treating timber sales by REITs as not inventory; the research credit, the new markets tax credit, accelerated depreciation for certain farming equipment and restaurant improvements and &#8220;motorsports entertainment complexes, and of course the banks&#8217; favorite&#8211;the subpart F exception for active financing income ) and a number of individual provisions (e.g., the above-the-line deduction for teachers for up to $250 of expenses for various supplies and equipment).   Most of these business extenders make no sense&#8211;e.g., why should there be a tax subsidy via accelerated depreciation (expensing) for sports facilities, thus making wealthy sports franchise owners even wealthier?  As we move towards a resource-restricted future, we should attune our tax code to supporting sustainability, not to the centuries&#8217; old view that resources are there to be used up.   The most egregious of all, in light of the way that financial institutions have benefited&#8211;and continue to benefit in terms of lower cost of funds&#8211;from government support, is the active financing exception: this provision essentially permits banks to keep their overseas investment profits without paying tax currently as other multinationals are required to do.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />The revenue raisers are always controversial, because they generally end a loophole that some group has enjoyed for some period of time and feels entitled to continue to enjoy.  Funny, though, the Wall Street Journal seldom runs an editorial or Op-Ed noting that entitlements are problematic and therefore ending these types of entitlements is a good thing.  Compare that to the Journal&#8217;s typical slant on any &#8220;entitlements&#8221; that tend to go to ordinary taxpayers, such as union-negotiated pensions, union-negotiated health insurance provisions, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid.</p>
<p>There are three areas of revenue raisers for which the House deserves credit, even though the bill&#8217;s provisions are, as always, a compromise that falls short of the best approach to the issue.</p>
<p>1) Carried interest  </p>
<blockquote><p>The House bill includes a provision to tax most carried interest as ordinary income, but because of a huge lobbying effort by the fund industry, the bill gave managers a break that ordinary taxpayers don&#8217;t get.  After the provision comes into full force after the delayed effective date, managerse who earn a share of the profits of the partnership they manage will be able to treat 25% of their compensation as though it were a capital gain (even though they have no capital invested), while now treating 75% of those profits as ordinary income like every other person who pays taxes on compensation.  The lobbyists now will focus their attention on the Senate, where they hope to get this modification altered even more, so that perhaps only 60% or 50% of their compensation income will be treated as compensation income and taxed at the ordinary rate.</p>
<p>The bill also taxes dispositions of the partnership interest attributable to carried interest as ordinary income and recognizes that income nothwithstanding other rules that might provide nonrecognition or deferral.</p>
<p>It would be nice if the Senate got some spine and changed the provision in the other direction, taxing all of the profits share at the ordinary income rate.  Managers are earning their compensation as a partnership profits share, and there is really no justification for the 75-25 split.   Shame on the House for caving in this way to the wealthy fund managers&#8217; lobby.</p></blockquote>
<p>2) S corporations</p>
<blockquote><p>For a long time, S corporations have been treated as the way around payroll tax obligations.  John Edwards is the poster-boy for this problem, in that he created an S corporation that received his services income, then claimed that he was paid a &#8220;salary&#8221; from the S corporation that should be subject to payroll taxes, but claimed the rest of his services income was a pass-through of S corporation profits, so not subject to payroll taxation.  Clearly, all of the profits were services income attributable to his personal efforts, and all of the pass-through should have been subject to payroll taxation.</p>
<p>The House bill addresses this issue, but applies it only to S corporations with three or fewer shareholder/service provides upon whose reputations the S corporation&#8217;s profits hinge.    A major step in addressing the problem, even if not perfect.</p></blockquote>
<p>3) international tax provisions</p>
<blockquote><p>The US has a &#8220;worldwide taxation&#8221; schema, meaning that we tax income from all sources, not just income from within the territory of the US.  Many of the provisions have been changed in recent years to be too taxpayer-friendly, such as the reduction of foreign tax credit &#8220;baskets&#8221; that essentially permits taxpayers to &#8220;cross-credit&#8221; taxes, thus reducing US taxes too much for taxes paid on foreign income.</p>
<p>The extenders bill provides rules preventing taxpayers from splitting foreign tax credits from the income to which they relate, and denying foreign tax credits for income not subject to US taxation because of certain asset acquisition provisions (e.g., section 338 elections, section 754 elections, check-the-box liquidations).  A significant development is the rule requiring separate application of the foreign tax credit limitation to items re-sourced under tax treaties, and a new source rule for income on guarantees.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>I thought that since book publishing has been a theme at Angry Bear with Mike&#8217;s book <em>Presimetrics</em>, and in light of other books from Angry Bear authors a possibility, the story seemed interesting.  Also Angry Bear has quite a few readers who are also &#8216;engineers&#8217; who also might be interested to hear about his story from a different perspective.</p>
<p><strong>by Piaw Na</strong></p>
<p>I am the author of <a target="_blank" href="http://books.piaw.net/guide/index.html">An<br />Engineer&#8217;s Guide to Silicon Valley Startups</a>. As a self-published<br />author, I do everything from writing to cover design to shipping books<br />(yes, I do my own taxes as well), and I thought I would write<br />something about what a self-publishing business looks like.</p>
<p>I first thought of writing <a target="_blank" href="http://books.piaw.net/guide/index.html">this book</a> because of<br />having to repeat myself too many times to every new employee at Google<br />who asked me about exercising his stock options. Obviously, I never<br />got around to it until some time in late 2008, when I wrote a blog<br />post about <a target="_blank" href="http://piaw.blogspot.com/2009/01/stock-compensation-at-startups.html">startup<br />stock compensation</a>.</p>
<p>The blog post got a surprisingly anemic reception, yet it gets<br />continual hits even today, indicating that while few people piped up<br />and said, &#8220;Oh yeah, I&#8217;d like to read a book about this,&#8221; there were<br />always a few people searching for the answers that the blog post was<br />about. I fleshed out the chapter a bit and showed it to a couple of<br />friends of mine. The feedback was, &#8220;The title sucks. I didn&#8217;t think<br />I&#8217;d be interested in the topic, but once I got started I enjoyed it<br />despite myself!&#8221;</p>
<p>I put the project aside and went through 2009 busy with work and<br />travel. I went down to 80% time at my day job, but the first few<br />months of it was spent catching up on life activities, rather than<br />working on the book. I bought a house, which turned out to be a<br />massive project all by itself, scanned <a target="_blank" href="http://picasaweb.google.com/piaw.na">several year&#8217;s worth of<br />slides</a>, which was something I should have done ages ago, and<br />before I knew it, had hit Thanksgiving with only 3 chapters of the<br />book done.</p>
<p>I ran into <a target="_blank" href="http://kickstarter.com/">Kickstarter</a> by<br />accident, and decided then and there that if anything would spur me<br />into writing the book, paying customers would! I put up my book <a target="_blank" href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/piaw/an-engineers-guide-to-silicon-valley-startups">there</a>,<br />and like magic, started writing furiously. The book was written<br />entirely in OpenOffice, using styles and templates I had found on the<br />web as a guide to ordering my thoughts. When I found myself working on<br />the book even during my <a target="_blank" href="http://piaw.blogspot.com/2010/01/sailing-and-diving-st-vincent-and.html">winter<br />vacation</a>, I knew I would get it done, and sooner than I expected.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />I searched the web about publishing solutions after reading <a target="_blank" href="http://piaw.blogspot.com/2010/02/review-john-t-reeds-self-publishing.html">John<br />Reed&#8217;s book</a>. His approach of printing his own book and binding it<br />at home didn&#8217;t appeal to me, and neither did ordering a thousand copy<br />run of something I was sure would be a small market. I thought of<br />trying to sell it to <a target="_blank" href="http://oreilly.com/">O&#8217;Reilly books</a>, but the thought of having to deal with a real publisher made me wince.<br />The last time I had a book contract, there was a lot of pressure to put in fluff to make the book fatter, because that&#8217;s how people buy books in bookstores. After some research, I found <a target="_blank" href="http://createspace.com/">CreateSpace</a>, and discovered that despite being owned and affiliated by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&#038;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2F&#038;tag=piasblo-20&#038;linkCode=ur2&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=390957">Amazon.com</a>,<br />you could just treat them as a short-run printing house and not let<br />Amazon sell it on your behalf. If Amazon did sell it on your behalf,<br />they would take 50% of the cut. If Amazon distributed it to bookstores<br />on your behalf, they would take 70% of the cut. Neither of those deals<br />sounded good to me: there are maybe 100,000 engineers in the country,<br />and at most 5% of those would be interested in startups at any given<br />time. That caps my sales at about 5,000 copies, if I reached every one<br />of them (I probably won&#8217;t).</p>
<p>Once I got it into my head to do it through CreateSpace, I stitched<br />together all the files and formatted it in various form factors to see<br />how it looked. I ruled out 8&#215;10, because it&#8217;s bulky and hard to ship.<br />Smaller sizes required more pages, and CreateSpace charged for<br />printing by the page after 100 pages. I decided on 6&#215;9 as a<br />compromise.</p>
<p>Putting together the cover was interesting. Amazon provides a<br />template, and I had a copy of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001HBJ65Q?tag=piasblo-20&#038;camp=213381&#038;creative=390973&#038;linkCode=as4&#038;creativeASIN=B001HBJ65Q&#038;adid=0TZZH9CSEWV02B5F8VPB&#038;">Photoshop</a><br />anyway from my <a target="_blank" href="http://piaw.blogspot.com/search/label/photography">photography</a><br />hobby. It turns out that if you need to do something with Photoshop<br />nowadays, all you need to do to google the task you want to do, and<br />follow the step-by-step instructions. I was surprised at how easy it<br />was.</p>
<p>Once all that was put together, I signed up for CreateSpace&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="https://www.createspace.com/Products/Book/">Pro Plan</a> (which<br />reduced the price per copy of the book: all it takes is a 40-copy run<br />and the Pro Plan pays for itself), and then worked on iterating on the<br />interior and exteriors. You have to do this a couple of times because<br />how much margin to use and how to make it look good isn&#8217;t obvious, and<br />of course print is always different than looking at photos on a<br />computer screen.</p>
<p>The Kindle version was very easy. I was very familiar with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mobipocket.com/en/downloadSoft/ProductDetailsCreator.asp">MobipocketCreator</a> from prior experience, and it sucked in my files just fine. There were<br />a few glitches, which I dealt with by diving into the html intermediate format and directly editing the files (you can do this once the manuscript is in close to final stage). It turned out that by using the <a target="_blank" href="http://openoffice.org/">OpenOffice</a> styles appropriately, my book lined up very easily with what Mobipocket Creator expected.</p>
<p>All the pre-production work took about 2-3 days of total work time. Proof reading and copy-editing was helped a lot because <a target="_blank" href="http://lahosken.san-francisco.ca.us/">Larry Hosken</a> took it upon himself to copy-edit the book in detail. Others provided gobs of input as well. The Kickstarter process is extremely valuable in this regards. You really do get people who are interested in helping out, and are familiar with the topic at hand. The final part was sending out the manuscript to everyone who was quoted in it to make sure I<br />didn&#8217;t misquote anyone. Everyone was incredibly helpful and I&#8217;m very grateful that people have been so generous with their time.</p>
<p>Each copy of the book from Amazon costs me $2.90. Add in the costs and risks of holding inventory, and a $5 premium for the paper copy didn&#8217;t sound unreasonable. I wanted to keep myself economically indifferent as far as selling electronic books or paper books, and so priced the paper book at $29.95 and the electronic version at $24.95. The big bugaboo about selling an electronic version is piracy, but I decided<br />that given my audience, I had to have an electronic version, and Software Engineers are infamously opposed to DRM, so I went DRM-free.</p>
<p>One of my biggest headaches turned out to be marketing the book. As an<br />ex-Googler, I first thought of <a target="_blank" href="http://adwords.com/">Adwords</a>, and bought some Adwords ads. It turns out that it&#8217;s incredibly hard to use the Adwords model for something as niche as a book. For instance, if you had a 1% conversion rate and you made $25 a book, the maximum bid you could make on Adwords would be $0.25! And at that price you simply would not make any money! As someone who maintained a blog and enjoys writing, however, what I&#8217;ve learned is that blog posts that garner wide interest amongst the target audience was extremely effective. For<br />instance, my blog post on <a target="_blank" href="http://piaw.blogspot.com/2010/04/hiring-committee-story.html">Google Hiring Committees</a> drew 10 sales the day it got syndicated to <a target="_blank" href="http://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>. So ironically, the best way to get people to pay for books is to write a lot of free stuff, which as a writer I am more than willing to do.</p>
<p>Someone asked me whether I would have been better off putting the book on-line and selling Adsense ads right next to it. In the 4 months I have sold the book from my <a></a>href=&#8221;http://books.piaw.net&#8221;>web-site, which is a <a></a>href=&#8221;http://appengine.google.com&#8221;>Google AppEngine hosted page, I<br />have sold 108 copies at full price (as opposed to the 42 copies sold<br />at promotion price on Kickstarter). As of today, that&#8217;s a total<br />revenue of $4628, with a printing cost of $400 (including books not<br />sold, given away as review copies, etc). Adsense on my blog, in the<br />mean time made about $100. Amazon Associates (also on my blog) made<br />about $200. It&#8217;s quite clear that Adsense/Amazon Associates is not a<br />good way of monetizing the extremely niche content that comprises the<br />book. Stamps turned out to be the second biggest variable expense at<br />$201.55. Business overhead came in at around $1,000 for various<br />business licenses and California&#8217;s LLC tax, which you would not have<br />to pay if you were doing this as a side-job and didn&#8217;t have to<br />incorporate in order to qualify for group health insurance. It turns<br />out that books are a highly scalable business, so each additional book<br />you sell turns out to be pure profit.</p>
<p>The book sold out its initial 100 copy run at the end of April, 2<br />months after I started shipping books. With print on demand there&#8217;s<br />never any need to order huge runs, and I only have so much space at<br />home, so small runs on the order of 40-100 copies minimizes clutter at<br />home while always keeping a few copies on hand for sale. My current<br />sales range from 3-5 copies a week, which is approximately a run rate<br />of $3900/year. About one third of the sales are electronic, which<br />indicates that going DRM-free has not really cost me much revenue. I<br />initially thought that since the book&#8217;s main value was dealing with<br />taxes, which were incredibly California specific, I would not be able<br />to sell the book outside California. That turned out to be false. I<br />have sold electronic books to Sweden, Norway, England, and Russia.<br />Book sales to New York turned out to be surprisingly high as well.</p>
<p>All in all, I think while having an editor, proof reader,<br />distribution, would have been nice, I&#8217;m not sure I wanted to give away<br />90% of the income from the book to get that, given how niche a market<br />this book will sell into. That would have made the book only as<br />profitable as the Adsense blog. Ironically, if your book is going to<br />flop, you are better off going with a publisher, which will grant you<br />an advance of about $10,000, which is more than most books will earn<br />out in their life time. However, if the book has any success at all<br />and will turn out to be an ever-green title (one you can sell year<br />after year), you are better off going the self-publishing route. All<br />in all, I am pleased with the process, though given the 3 months of<br />real time I had to put into writing the book, I would have made more<br />money fliping burgers at minimum wage, after subtracting out all the<br />obligatory expenses.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll come back in another 6 months to report on sales and discuss<br />anything else that I have learned in the mean time.</p>

<blockquote><p>The obvious problems of graft and the revolving door between government and industry, in other words, were really symptoms of a more fundamental pathology: regulation itself became delegitimatized&#8230; This view was exacerbated by the way regulation works&#8230; Too many regulators, for instance, are political appointees, instead of civil servants. This erodes the kind of institutional identity that helps create esprit de corps, and often leads to politics trumping policy. Congress, meanwhile, often takes a famine-or-feast attitude toward funding, allocating less money when times are good and reinflating regulatory budgets after the inevitable disaster occurs. &#8230; This &#8230; also contributes to the sense that regulation is something it’s O.K. to skimp on. <br />&#8230;<br />[T]he history of regulation both here and abroad suggests that how we think about regulators, and how they think of themselves, has a profound impact on the work they do. &#8230; So reforming the system isn’t about writing a host of new rules; it’s about elevating the status of regulation and regulators. More money wouldn’t hurt: as &#8230; George Stigler and Gary Becker point out, paying regulators competitive salaries &#8230; would attract talent and reduce the temptations of corruption. It would also send a message about the value of what regulators do. That’s important&#8230; If we want our regulators to do better, we have to embrace a simple idea: regulation isn’t an obstacle to thriving free markets; it’s a vital part of them.</p></blockquote>

                                <p><strong>by Linda Beale</strong><br />crossposted with <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/">Ataxingmatter</a></p>
<p><strong>Gulf Oil Spill: time to revise resource tax policy; how about a BEST surcharge?</strong></p>
<p>The oil spill in the Gulf continues, wreaking hazard along the Gulf coast and threatening the Atlantic coastline as well. Birds, fish, sea flora and fauna are all threatened. Tourism and fishing face enormous economic costs. Our public lands will take years, perhaps decades, to recover.</p>
<p>Corporatism in all its ugly colors is on ready display in this disaster. The drilling used a single sleeve pipe instead of the stronger and less likely to leak double-walled version that is ordinarily used. They hurried the sealing of the well rather than cycle through the extra day necessary, worried about the fact that the well had already taken longer than intended, with each day costing thousands extra and the rig ready to move on. They apparently disregarded signs of leaking gas and rushed testing at the end. But worst of all, neither BP nor TransOcean was prepared to deal with a deep-water disaster. By BP&#8217;s own admission, it &#8220;didn&#8217;t have the tools&#8221; it needed to handle a deep-sea explosion, and obviously hadn&#8217;t invested the millions (billions?) it should have in research and experimentation on deep-sea disasters. It looks like profits was the only driving force&#8211;no matter what the cost in potential environmental disaster and human lives.</p>
<p>Yet we provide enormous breaks to natural resource extractive industries. Their responsibility for damages is limited. (Congress is considering changing this now&#8211;it should do so immediately, and hold BP and Transocean retroactively accountable for the full long-term cost of the damage they&#8217;ve done to our world.) We provide the resources at almost no cost&#8211;piddling royalties at best. We give layers of tax breaks, including the &#8220;percentage depletion allowance&#8221; that reduces the taxable income on the theory that eventually the company will have no more product and go out of business. Times, styles, customs and tastes change&#8211;but almost every company tied to a specific product will eventually lose out, and it would be foolish to provide that company a tax break for its expected future losses. Tax has always been related to current profits rather than life cycles. But not for the extractive industries.</p>
<p>BP, of course, faces potential criminal charges for its conduct. See <a target="_blank" href="http://www.salon.com/technology/how_the_world_works/2010/06/03/bp_and_the_lawyers/index.html?source=newsletter">this article</a> in Salon.com (June 3, 2010); <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/02/us/02spill.html?th&#038;emc=th">US Opens Criminal Inquiry</a>, NY Times June 1, 2010. Hopefully, the mere existence of a criminal investigation will act as a deterrent to other extractive companies, signalling the importance of preparation for dealing with potential environmental and economic hazards.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />Changes, though, are necessary in the way we deal with extractive industries. Much greater transparency and accountability in the industry are required. Accountability requires more intensive regulation, and a sharper focus on compliance/enforcement within the agencies responsible. The Minerals Management Service is known for collusion with its overseen industries&#8211;this has to end. Salazar, Secretary of the Interior, is too much a friend of business and not enough a supporter of the environment&#8211;he should be replaced.</p>
<p>Transparency should include clear reporting on the way companies pay (or don&#8217;t pay) for the resources from which they profit, and how the compensation within the firm rewards those at the top and fails to ensure adequate focus on research to deal with problems. Senators Lugar and Cardin have suggested full disclosure by companies about amounts they pay to governments for access to natural resources (discussed as an amendment to financial reporm legislation). See Lissakers (from Revenue Watch Institute), <a target="_blank" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/karin-lissakers/the-cleanup-cant-stop-at_b_580729.html">The Cleanup Can&#8217;t Stop at the Shore</a>, Huffington Post, May 18, 2010. Guess what&#8211;lobbyists object to disclosure, saying it would &#8220;increase operating costs and hobble competition.&#8221; Id. That&#8217;s bullshit. Those costs have to be accounted for in the companies&#8217; financial statements and therefore whatever is spent (taxes, royalties, fees) is readily ascertainable by the companies. It is time that it was readily ascertainable by the American public.</p>
<p>Accountability requires more intensive regulation, and correction of the relationshipo between the Minerals Management Service and the industry, to ensure that companies at least do what is currently required of them by law. Companies should be held strictly liable&#8211;with joint and several liability among drillers, cementers, oil rig owners&#8211;for all cleanup costs as well as long-term environmental and economic damages. Congress should enact such a law immediately, with retroactive force covering BP, Transocean and Halliburton. We can no longer treat resource extraction the way we did in the 1800s&#8211;this is a different time, and the potential harms are much greater. Companies, not American taxpayers, have to assume the risks of losses in connection with their profit-making activities.</p>
<p>Perhaps, too, it is time to rethink our tax policy towards environmentally harmful industries to ensure that the industries take into account the cost of current &#8220;externalities&#8221; such as risk of lives and risk of harm to the environment and economy (as in the tourism and fishery industries being harmed by the Gulf oil spill). Obama called for rethinking the tax breaks for the extractive industries at a speech at Carnegie Mellon, noting that the catastrophic spil demonstrates the need to move towards clean energy. See Obama <a target="_blank" href="http://apolloalliance.org/digest/?p=709">Calls for Roll Backs on Big Oil tax breaks</a>, Apollo Alliance Daily Digest, June 3, 2010; <a target="_blank" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/06/02/obama-oil-tax-breaks-billions_n_597794.html?ir=Green">Obama Calls for Rolling Back Oil Company Tax Breaks to Net Billions for Alternative Energy</a>, Huffington Post, June 2, 2010.</p>
<p>What steps could be taken? Consider the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>roll back current tax expenditures benefiting the oil and gas and other extractive industries</strong></li>
<p>
<li><strong>increase royalties for extracting resources from the US commons (</strong>including nullifying all current leases and requiring renegotiation based on environmental safety records and current expenditures for research and development to support life and environmental safety)<br />enact a windfall profits tax</li>
<p>
<li><strong>enact an &#8220;BEST&#8221; (bailout the environment and states tax) surcharge</strong> &#8211;a 5% surcharge on natural resource extracting industry companies&#8217; financial statement profits as reported under GAAP or IFRS, whichever is higher, to be redistributed via funding of national and state parks and state coastline preservation efforts, protecting smaller businesses with revenue thresholds ($30 million or more, perhaps).</li>
<p>
<li><strong>charge extractive resource companies an annually adjusted excise tax, calculated as a rolling percentage of the last three-years&#8217; penalties plus three-years&#8217; lobbying expenses, so that a company will tend to pay a higher tax when it expends more money lobbying and based on the number and severity of penalties incurred for safety and regulatory violations.</strong> BP had about $14 billion of profits in 2009 (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.bp.com/liveassets/bp_internet/bp_fuels/bp_fuels_uk_english/STAGING/local_assets/downloads_pdfs/0_999/10P2_bp_fourth_quarter_and_full_year_2009_results.pdf">see statement from BP</a>), and spent $16 million in 2009 to lobby Congress (see en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BP). For the first quarter of 2010, BP had profits of about 6 billion. BP has had a number of egregious safety violations, but fines are too small in relation to those profits&#8211;a &#8220;mere fly-speck on the company&#8217;s balance sheet.&#8221; Morse, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-morse/bp-profits-from-gulf-spil_b_561055.html">BP Profits from Gulf Spill</a>, Huffington Post, May 3, 2010. As Whatley has indicated, &#8220;when a corporation falls short of regulatory standards it does not do so accidentally. Rather, it is a calculated choice based on risible enforcement efforts and piddling penalties passed by legislators on the take.&#8221; See <a target="_blank" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/stuart-whatley/bp-spill-the-capitalist-h_b_561818.html">Capitalist Hagiography has little room for saints</a>, Huffington Post, May 3, 2010. This excise tax would mean that the more money a company devotes to lobbying and the more piddling penalties that it is required to pay, the more real money it will have to cough up.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some background about previous efforts to remove excessive tax benefits for extractive industries. Senator Robert CAsey (D-PA) in 2007 proposed an excess profits tax, when Exxon Mobil reported huge profits from the high price of oil. See <a target="_blank" href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18333971/">Sen. wants to tax Big Oil&#8217;s &#8216;excess&#8217; profits</a>, AP, Apr. 26, 2007. The House in 2007 and 2008 at least had the gumption to vote to remove tax breaks (amounting to about $18 billion over ten years) that US oil companies enjoy. See <a target="_blank" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/18/AR2007011801386.html">House Repeals Tax Break for Big Oil</a>, washingtonpost.com, Jan. 19, 2007 (noting that bill would have repealed the 2004 lowering of corporate tax rates for big oil and barred new federal leases unless they renegotiated problematic leases from 1998 and 1999 that did not require any royalties whatsoever for Gulf oil production, all measures that were opposed by the Bush administration, which didn&#8217;t think the improperly drafted leases should have to be renegotiated by Big Oil); <a target="_blank" href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=86973288">House Votes to Tax Big Oil, Fund Renewable Energy</a>, NPR.org, Feb. 28, 2008. Action was defeated in the Senate, however, where Senate Republicans ensured that big oil would dodge the windfall profits tax bullet and continue to receive the many tax benefits in the Code. See Democrats&#8217; <a target="_blank" href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,364846,00.html">Oil Tax Plan Fails in Senate Vote</a>, foxnews.com, Jun. 10, 2008 (noting the GOP&#8217;s defeat of a Democratic energy package that would have rescinded existing tax breaks and imposed a 25% tax on &#8220;unreasonable&#8221; profits of the largest US oil companies&#8211;Exxon Mobil, Chevron, Shell, BP America, and ConocoPhilips&#8211;which made $36 billion in the first three months of 2008; the tax would have been avoidable if the companies invested in alternative energy programs or refinery expansions).</p>

<p><strong>A Gap Not In Time But In Judicial Veracity</strong><br />crossposted with <a target="_blank" href="http://annarborist.blogspot.com/">The Annarborist</a></p>
<p>“Talk of judicial activism tends to focus on results, but the Guggenheim case shows that maybe we should talk a little bit more about method.”<br />—Doug Kendall and Elizabeth Wydra, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.slate.com/id/2255451/">“Torturing the Law: Jay Bybee models conservative judicial activism in the 9th Circuit</a>,” by Doug Kendall and Elizabeth Wydra, in <em>Slate</em></p>
<p>Ooh, yeah! Or, more precisely,“Finally!”</p>
<p>Bybee, as those who follow national legal-political issues know, is the former Bush administration assistant attorney general who as head of the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel—the office charges with giving administration officials straight analysis of the law—co-authored, along with the infamous John Yoo, a legal memorandum that pronounced legal under United States and international law interrogation techniques used on terrorist suspects captured oversees that almost everyone familiar with relevant federal and international law believe constituted illegal torture.</p>
<p>The Bush administration eventually withdrew that memorandum, and Bybee is reported to have confided to friends that he regrets having signed that memo, which actually was written mostly by Yoo.  Before the memo came to light, Bybee was nominated and confirmed for a seat of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, the court that had federal appellate jurisdiction over cases from the three West Coast states, Montana, Idaho, Nevada, Arizona, Alaska, Hawaii and Guam. </p>
<p>In the Guggenheim case—specifically, Guggenheim v. City of Goleta—Bybee has, as Kendall and Wydra put it so succinctly, “managed to do what has eluded national property-rights advocates for decades: declare a rent control ordinance unconstitutional under the Fifth Amendment&#8217;s Takings Clause.”  And as the quote I chose to highlight at the opening of this piece, talk of judicial activism does tend to focus on results, but the Guggenheim case shows that maybe we should talk a little bit more about method, because it really is method—what lawyers know as procedural law—that the rightwing legal community, most significantly those on the Supreme Court and the lower federal courts—have used regularly to achieve the substantive results that want. </p>
<p>I recognized eons ago that the rightwing legal movement—i.e., the Federalist Society, including their large judicial contingent—has been using court-fabricated pleading, jurisdictional, quasi-jurisdictional, sovereign immunity (mainly a bizarre rewriting of the actual text of the Eleventh Amendment), and “qualified immunity” doctrines to quietly recreate constitutional and other federal procedural law in the image of the Republic Party’s political and ideological bases. But until now it seemed that a few law professors and I were the only ones did.  So it’s really, really nice to finally see an article published on a widely-read media website that points out this concerted rightwing judicial strategy and calls that spade the spade that it is. </p>
<p>The political right has had a nearly three-decade-long free ride, because the general news media limits its reporting and discussion of legal issues and court opinions—including Supreme Court opinions—to hot-button culture wars issues and to court opinions decided on what lawyers call the “merits,” a legal term of art that means that the case was decided on the substantive issue that the case was about. <br /><a name="more"></a><br />Usually, these procedural gimmicks are used to defeat access to a court decision on the merits when the party who filed the lawsuit is invoking a constitutional or federal statutory right favored by the ideological progressives. But, as Kendall and Wydra explain, last week, “Jay Bybee is a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, but apparently being elevated to the federal bench hasn&#8217;t stunted his creative powers. In a case called Guggenheim v. City of Goleta, Bybee has managed to do what has eluded national property-rights advocates for decades: declare a rent control ordinance unconstitutional under the Fifth Amendment&#8217;s Takings Clause.”</p>
<p>And, as the Slate article authors illustrate, he did it by creating fictions of both law and fact.  The Guggenheims had bought a mobile home park in 1997 that was subject to mobile home rent control laws enacted in 1979 and amended in 1987.  The purchase price reflected the reduced value of the property because of the reduced rental profits resulting from the rent control plan.  The mobile park was located in what at the time was an unincorporated part Santa Barbara County, but which in 2002 became incorporated as the city of Goleta.  By state law, as part of the incorporation process, the new city’s charter provided that all existing laws pertaining to that area under Santa Barbara County law would become city ordinances at the moment of incorporation as the city of Goleta, and the effect of all those laws would “relate back” so that they had the same effect as they had, pre-incorporation.</p>
<p>The Guggenheims sued, claiming that the rent-control law violated the Fifth Amendment’s bar to a government “taking” of private property with just compensation.  For decades now, the rightwing “property rights” folks—most of whom normally consider the filing of lawsuits anathema to the very concept of freedom (although they never explain why, exactly), and who sing the praises of states’ (and local governments’) rights to violate the constitutional rights of individuals, all the while styling themselves libertarians—have filed federal lawsuit upon federal lawsuit alleging that regulations such as zoning laws and environmental laws violate their Fifth Amendment rights under that Amendment’s “takings” clause because the regulations diminish the value of their real estate.  It is, the claim, a “regulatory taking” without just compensation.  </p>
<p>They have rarely succeeded in getting a favorable ruling on the “merits”—that is, on the substantive legal issue—and have never before been able to get a ruling holding that rent-control regulations constitute an unconstitutional “taking” under the Fifth Amendment.</p>
<p>As a June 3 article in the New York Times discussed, current Supreme Court nominee Elena Kagan, back in 1987 when she was a clerk to Justice Thurgood Marshall, wrote an angry memorandum urging her boss to try to overturn a conservative appeals court ruling that had questioned the constitutionality of a rent-control ordinance.”  Kagan said that the appeals court judge who wrote the opinion “has flouted the opinions of this court and has reached a result that is sweeping in its implications. Although the decision does not invalidate the ordinance on its merits, it is an authorization for broad, wholesale attacks on rent-control regulation.”  The Supreme Court refused to hear the case, allowing the ruling to stand, not on the merits”—not on the Fifth Amendment issue but instead on the basis of some procedural gimmick. </p>
<p>That has been par for the course.  Court-fabricated procedural/jurisdictional/quasi-jurisdictional/soveright-immmunity/“qualified”-immunity gimmicks routinely bar people from access to court in order to vindicate individual constitutional rights—including challenging the constitutional of laws and government policies—that liberals value.  And those procedural gimmicks are ignored, or new ones created ad hoc, in order to allow access to court by those who claim violations of individual constitutional rights that conservatives hold dear.</p>
<p>But in the Guggenheim case, Bybee fabricated, first, a legal fiction and then a fact in order to pronounce this rent-control law and, inferentially, all rent-control laws, because there was nothing unusual about this particular one, violative of the “takings” clause.  Bybee fabricated the legal fiction that there was a momentary gap in time when the ordinance did not apply: that moment when the land ceased to be part of unincorporated Santa Barbara County and before it was a newly-incorporated city-and that therefore the city ordinance was a new ordinance.  This, Bybee said, enabled the Guggenheims to avoid the statute-of-limitations bar to their challenging the initial ordinance more than two years after they bought the property. </p>
<p>And, allowing the Guggenheims to proceed with the lawsuit and obtain a ruling on the “merits,” Bybee fabricated a fact.  Bybee claimed that the Guggenheims had, as a matter of fact, seen a diminishment of the value of their property since they purchased it; without a diminishment in value since they bought the property, there would, after all, be no “taking,” as a matter of fact, irrespective of the law.  As Judge Andrew Kleinfeld, a conservative Reagan appointee, said in his dissent, the price the Guggenheims paid for the property in 1997 reflected the diminished value due to the rent-control ordinance.  </p>
<p>The Guggenheims were claiming not a diminishment but the inability to reap a windfall from an end to the ordinance.  They were, Bybee said, entitled to something that few others these days are entitled to: a ruling on the merits of their challenge to the constitutionality of a law or government policy or action. They were, Bybee said, entitled to a ruling on whether they were entitled to something not that they had lost but instead that they never had—a property whose value was based in part on an absence of an applicable rent-control regulation—because they were entitled to a ruling on the substantive constitutional issue of whether rent-control regulations violate the property owners’ rights under the Fifth Amendment’s “takings” clause.</p>
<p>And we all know that it does.  Even if none other than self-styled constitutional originalist and textualist Antonin Scalia has said that the Framers had in mind only actual physical takings of property, not the diminishment of the value of the property through regulation. And Kendall and Wydra quote Scalia as having said exactly that.  </p>
<p>Judicial activism, like beauty, is in the eye of the judicial beholder.  As is access to court in order to have constitutional challenges decided on the merits.</p>

<p><strong>Unemployment During the New Deal</strong></p>
<p>Cross posted with the <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=44">Presimetrics Blog</a>.</p>
<p>This is not the post the post I was planning to write this weekend, but frankly every time I post something that touches on FDR, people get ahold of me with the same canard: unemployment in the U.S. was somewhere around 20% all through the 1930s, which is a sign that the New Deal failed. It’s something repeated at length by the Glenn Becks of this world, but also by a lot of supposed scholars.</p>
<p>Now, there’s a reason I haven’t written this post in the past and wasn’t planning to do it any time soon; it’s been done before, and well enough that there isn’t much for me to add. I think the first time it was done was back in 1975 as a working paper <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=259399">Michael Darby</a> (sorry this is behind a paywall &#8211; as is the later version published in the JPE). In blogs, Eric Rauchway at <a href="http://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2008/10/10/very-short-reading-list-unemployment-in-the-1930s/">The Edge of the American West</a> covered the topic very well (distilling down some of the post-Darby work in the process) a couple of years ago. I’ll be drawing extensively from the Rauchway piece in this post, including stealing both of the graphs that appear below.</p>
<p>So to begin, as Rauchway noted, there was a time that everyone knew that unemployment in the 1930s looked like this:</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TAzTIi2qVVI/AAAAAAAAAJ0/y3TB1zlnqQI/s1600/unemloy1.bmp"><img border="0" alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TAzTIi2qVVI/AAAAAAAAAJ0/y3TB1zlnqQI/s320/unemloy1.bmp"></a><br />Figure 1</p>
<p>The reason everyone knew that was because those were the figures Stanley Lebergott published in <ital>Manpower in Economic Growth: The American Record since 1800</ital> in 1964. But as Rauchway noted, Lebergott himself pointed out in footnotes that these figures specifically left out people enrolled in assorted New Deal work programs. But New Deal work programs included the Work Projects Administration, which would eventually employ well over 3.3 million people, and the Civilian Conservation Corps which hired in the six digits. A quick glance at table 429 of the <a href="http://www2.census.gov/prod2/statcomp/documents/1942-06.pdf">1941 Statistical Abstract of the United States</a> indicates that the WPA alone had over 3 million employees on a typical week in 1936, and while the WPA was the big dog, it wasn’t the only one of these agencies hiring large numbers of people. It’s worth noting that the entire population of the U.S. at the time – never mind the labor force – was less than 130 million.</p>
<p>Enter Darby. He reached the conclusion that people who are building infrastructure (roads, dams, sidewalks) and getting a regular paycheck for that labor should not be considered unemployed. (Go figure!) And if you’re inclined to argue that point, consider this – what exactly do you think the unemployment figures would be for China today if you counted everyone who worked for a company controlled by the PLA or some other government agency as unemployed? What would the unemployment rate be in Singapore if anyone working for a government owned company was considered unemployed? And how realistically do you think those figures would reflect the situation in China or Singapore?</p>
<p>So Rauchway includes this second graph, showing both the Lebergott figures for unemployment and Darby’s corrected version.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TAzVOP4-kaI/AAAAAAAAAKE/-3cDfxNZJd0/s1600/unemploy2.bmp"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TAzVOP4-kaI/AAAAAAAAAKE/-3cDfxNZJd0/s320/unemploy2.bmp" border="0" alt=""></a><br />Figure 2.</p>
<p>Big difference, eh? Of course, unemployment was relatively high all the way through the start of World War 2. The Great Depression caused a huge hit on the economy, and the Dust Bowl didn’t help. It is not a surprise that it took six years for the unemployment to drop in half, and that even that figure was elevated. But the reason the unemployment rate was dropping from its high of 24% (picture how bad the economy has to be for unemployment to get that high) was that some serious real economic growth had set in. In five of the eight years from ’33 to ’40, real GDP grew by more than 8% a year! In terms that the folks who criticize FDR’s performance would understand, that’s about a percent faster than Reagan pulled off during his best year.</p>
<p>So while the unemployment rate remained high from ’33 to ’40 (the private sector wasn’t hiring the unemployed, much less competing with the government for the services of those who worked for the WPA), the thing we should be looking at is the rate at which the unemployment rate changed. Otherwise, we have to conclude that GW did a better job on the economy than any other President, never mind the lukewarm growth rate intro leading up to the Great Recession finale. After all, the peak in real GDP per capita (so far) came during his term.</p>

<blockquote><p>From the final House Bill, click through (I can’t direct link) or find in the pdf “SEC. 6009. REMOVAL OF STATUTORY REFERENCES TO CREDIT RATINGS.” This removes the references to NRSRO from federal agencies and the law.</p>
<p>The LeMieux amendment is the language of SEC. 6009 from the House moved over, language which was missing in the Senate bill.</p></blockquote>
<p>That is all statutary references to NRSROs are removed by both bills now being merged in the conference committee.  Conference committees can do what they want, so the NRSRSOs aren&#8217;t deposed yet, but this is huge news and I completely missed it.</p>
