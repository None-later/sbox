                                <p>Via <a href="http://www.rgemonitor.com/blog/setser/113001">Brad Setser</a> comes <a href="http://www.cid.harvard.edu/cidpublications/darkmatter_051130.pdf">U.S. AND GLOBAL IMBALANCES: CAN DARK MATTER PREVENT A BIG BANG?</a> by Ricardo Hausmann and Federico Sturzenegger:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) indicates that in 1980 the US had about 365 billion dollars of net foreign assets (that is the difference between the foreign assets owned abroad and the local assets owned by foreigners). These assets rendered a net return of about 30 billion dollars. Between 1980 and 2004, the US accumulated a current account deficit of 4.5 trillion dollars. You would expect the net foreign assets of the US to fall by that amount, to say, minus 4.1 trillion. If it paid 5 percent on that debt, the net return on its financial position should have moved from a surplus of 30 billion in 1982 to minus 210 billion dollars a year in 2004. Right? After all, debtors need to service their debt. So let’s look at how much is the actual return on the US net financial position. The number for 2004 is, yes, you’ve guessed it, still a positive 30 billion, just like in 1982! The US has spent 4.5 trillion dollars more than it has earned (which is what the cumulative current account deficit implies) for free! How could this be? Here the official story becomes murky. Part of the answer is that the US benefited from about 1.6 trillion dollars of net capital gains so that instead of owing 4.1 trillion, it owes “only” 2.5 trillion (which, at best, cuts the puzzle in half, leaving a whole other half to be explained). The other part of the official answer is that the US earns a higher return on its holdings of foreign assets than it pays to foreigners on its liabilities.</p></blockquote>
<p>A nice statement of the puzzle, which they explain thusly:</p>
<blockquote><p>We start by assuming that if an asset consistently pays more than another asset, then it is worth more, even if they both have the same historical cost or “book value”. We choose to value the assets on the basis of their returns … We know that the US net income on its financial portfolio is 30 billion dollars. This is a 5 percent return on an asset of 600 billion dollars. So we would say that the US is a net creditor to the tune of 600 billion dollars or about 5 percent of its GDP. Since<br />the income flow has remained fairly stable over the last 25 years, we would say that so have the US net foreign assets.</p></blockquote>
<p>Brad seems to have a commentary in store based on our posts <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/12/irelands-corporate-taxation.html">here</a> and <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/12/irish-economic-miracle-and-tax-policy.html">here</a>.  And yes, Brad is thinking about transfer pricing manipulation.  But consider the EuroDisney example offered by Hausmann and Sturzenegger where they note that U.S. created intellectual property is generating a lot of income in France.  While this income is counted in U.S. GNP, the actual recognition of this income per the GDP accounts for the U.S. and France depends on Disney’s intercompany pricing policy.  While the IRS might rightfully argue that this income be counted on the financials of the U.S. parent, the French tax authorities might convince Disney to leave much of it on the financials of the French subsidiary.  If the French tax authorities prevail, the net income from abroad accounting that Hausmann and Sturzenegger rely upon for their valuation exercise is distorted.  As Brad has his thinking cap on, I eagerly await his contribution to this discussion.</p>

<blockquote>While there are many and very real short-term risks to the Chinese economic miracle, the more fundamental reason why the US need not fear a long-run economic challenge from China lies in the disparate productivity performance between the two economies. China&#8217;s recent rapid growth has not been the product of technological innovation or productivity increases of the sort that is now taken for granted in the US. Rather, it has been the product of investing an inordinate proportion of its income and of bringing part of its rural labor surplus into the market economy. For China to pose a real long-term economic threat to the US, China would need to match the US&#8217;s sustained productivity performance, which has long been the envy of the world. Unless China truly embraces free-market economics, there is little chance of that occurring anytime soon.</p></blockquote>
<p>Matt makes an important philosophical (as well as economic) point:<br />
<blockquote>The claim I agree with here is that for China to overtake the U.S. economy in the long-run, it would need to match the U.S.&#8217;s sustained productivity growth. But there&#8217;s no &#8220;threat&#8221; here. German workers are more productive on a per-hour basis than are American workers. Americans would be better off if we achieved German levels of per-hour productivity, but closing the gap by reducing German productivity wouldn&#8217;t help Americans. Similarly, Chinese people becoming as rich and DVD-laden as Americans wouldn&#8217;t threaten anything. Indeed, it would be good, since if Chinese people were richer, they would presumably buy more American stuff.</p></blockquote>
<p>I would like to expand on my <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/01/chinas-per-capita-real-gdp-relative-to.html">earlier post</a>. The fact that China’s per capita GDP is only 15% of our per capita GDP begs the convergence question.  While the U.S. likely will continue to be an innovator in terms of having a more significant commitment to R&#038;D, <a href="http://ideas.repec.org/a/kap/jecgro/v2y1997i1p1-26.html">Barro and Sala-i-Martin</a> note in <em>Technological Diffusion, Convergence, and Growth</em>: <br />
<blockquote>In the long run, the world growth rate is driven by discoveries in the technologically leading economies Followers converge toward the leaders because copying is cheaper than innovation over some range. A tendency for copying costs to increase reduces followers growth rates and thereby generates a pattern of conditional convergence. We discuss how countries are selected to be technological leaders, and we assess welfare implications. Poorly defined intellectual property rights imply that leaders have insufficient incentive to invent and followers have excessive incentive to copy.</p></blockquote>
<p>China has certainly adopted a policy of copying as opposed to innovating.  While the Communist government is not as free market orientated as the folks at AEI would hope, there is little reason to believe that its per capita income will not increase relative to the U.S. even if convergence does not lead to equality of per capita income for the two nations.</p>

<blockquote>SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) &#8211; California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger plans to ask for an infrastructure bond issue of $25 billion to $27 billion, the Los Angeles Times reported on Thursday, quoting administration sources. The celebrity Republican has already signaled he is seeking massive spending on infrastructure in the nation&#8217;s most populous state. But he has not given a final amount after his administration hinted at a number as high as $50 billion … After a stinging loss in a November special election on a series of his initiatives, Schwarzenegger has promised a new start ahead of his re-election run in November 2006. Rebuilding roads, ports and other infrastructure is a centerpiece of that effort … A bond issue in the $25 billion-$27 billion range would far outstrip a $10.3 billion infrastructure bond proposal from State Senate President Pro Tempore Don Perata, a Democrat. State Treasurer Phil Angelides, a Schwarzenegger critic and Democratic candidate for governor, has stepped up warnings about the danger of issuing new debt. In a recent report, he said California has $34.6 billion in general obligation bonds outstanding and $30.4 billion in authorized but unissued bonds.</p></blockquote>
<p>Trying to understand what our replacement governor intends to do to reduce our structural deficit is a real challenge even for someone as well informed as <a href="http://www.berkeley.edu/news/extras/ca_budget/experts.shtml">John Ellwood</a>.  Consider, for example, <a href="https://www.ucdc.edu/faculty/California_Election/EllwoodTalk-Final.ppt">his presentation</a> A Daunting Task: California’s Problems in Dealing with its Budget Deficit, which presents an nice array of budgetary data and the political barriers to an effective resolution including this statement:<br />
<blockquote>Through a Recall a new Governor Schwarzenegger is elected who promises to solve the deficit problem without any new taxes and without significant spending cuts. This does not work so Governor again turns to a tool of direct democracy &#8211; the initiative &#8211; to increase the power of those who want to reduce spending.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, that failed as well.  Governor Schwarzenegger will address the State tomorrow night and likely focus on information contained in his <a href="http://govbud.dof.ca.gov/BudgetSummary/PREFACE/Introduction/section1_1.html">budget summary</a>: <br />
<blockquote>The economic recovery of California has begun strongly. This has brought new revenues to the State&#8217;s treasury. Nevertheless, because of the system of expenditure programs that has been created over the last decade, the expenditures made by the state government would, if allowed to continue unchecked, have gone up even more than the increase in revenue. Left alone, the systems of California&#8217;s public budget would have led to a widening deficit even as revenues increased. Both in his budget proposal and his structural reforms, Governor Schwarzenegger is proposing a course correction for California &#8211; to bring spending in line with revenues next year, and to bring the State&#8217;s Budget back into true structural balance in future years.</p></blockquote>
<p>As usual, Schwarzenegger is arguing that we do not need to raise taxes to cure the deficit problem and that there is some painless magic to reducing spending.  What bothers me is how the statement of the <a href="http://www.dof.ca.gov/HTML/BUD_DOCS/CHARTS/Chart-a1.pdf">General Fund</a> allows both game playing with expenditures and with the term “revenues and transfers”.  The following graph shows both items &#8211; blue being revenues and transfers with purple being general fund expenditures &#8211; starting with the 1992-93 budget and continuing with the projected 2005-2006 budget.  The governor is correct that we increased significantly spending during the late 1990’s boom after recorded revenues soared.  The graph is misleading in that it records recent borrowing as “revenues and transfers” to suggest a low general fund deficit.  It may also be misleading as far as recent expenditures, which have this appearance of not increasing very much until the current period – when they appear to jump.  But this replacement governor is known for his smoke and mirror games. </p>

<p>Of course, the whole point of the budget’s discussion is to blast this apparent jump in expenditures and then suggest:</p>
<blockquote><p>To achieve balance in 2005-06, virtually every part of state government must take a reduction in the funding that it would otherwise have received if spending were allowed to grow unchecked. Left unaltered, the operation of Proposition 98 would have crowded out all available general funds &#8211; and would have resulted in deeper and more severe cuts to health and human services programs provided by the State. Last year, the education community joined with the Governor in postponing $2 billion in what Proposition 98 would otherwise have provided. Given the alternative reductions that would have been required in health and human services, however, the Budget reflects a decision not to appropriate Proposition 98 increases of $1.1 billion in 2004-05 and $1.17 billion in 2005-06. These increases would otherwise have been required were the Proposition 98 guarantee allowed to run on autopilot next year.</p></blockquote>
<p>When he ran for replacement governor, Schwarzenegger promised not to cut education spending so he now claims he is only postponing education spending.  The governor’s budget is also claiming that we can easily avoid the circa $90 billion in General Fund spending with a new projection that this expenditure will magically be only $85 billion.  Did the governor just discover the missing $5 billion in funds from the <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/01/02/1072908904477.html?from=storyrhs">Parmalet fraud</a>? </p>
<p>Schedule 6 of the Statewide Financial Information from the Governor’s Budget is entitled <a href="ftp://ftpgovbud.dof.ca.gov/pub/BudgetSummary/BS_SCH6.pdf">Summary of State Population, Employees, and Expenditures</a> and provides a couple of useful pieces of information, which we graph.  Our first graph compares total revenues and total expenditures from the 1992-93 year to the projected 2005-6 year.  Notice in particular, that our overall deficit rose last year as the increase in total expenditures exceeded the increase in revenues.  But this schedule suggests a dramatic drop in the deficit for the ongoing year by pretending that expenditures will magically decline by almost $6 billion.  </p>

<p>Our last graph displays the ratio of government expenditures to personal income over the same time period.   While the first observation in our graph (1992-93) was somewhat less than the percentages observed from 1978 to 1981, 8.49% was certainly high when compared to most other years until the 1999-2000 observation.  I prefer looking at expenditures as a percent of income rather than in absolute terms for reasons similar to my earlier <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/01/highest-level-of-household-wealth-in.html">post today</a>, but one might ask – why not real expenditures per capita?  But perhaps you have already checked out Ellwood’s presentation, which does chart real expenditures per capita over time.  </p>

<p>If our replacement governor is serious about fiscal responsibility, why is he suggesting a substantial increase in California’s borrowing?  It is true that we Californians desire our roads to be repaired, more spending on education, and other services from our government.  But shouldn’t we be asked to pay for these publicly provided services in the form of higher taxes?  One might argue that the benefits from more and better roads and from public education accrue over the long-term so at least some borrowing is prudent.  But this debt must be repaid with interest by California taxpayers in the future.  Governor Schwarzenegger truly reminds me of President Bush in his pandering to the public with false promises of more government services without the need for higher taxes.  Of course, this lack of political will from Governor Girlie Man will necessitate that we will have to pay even more in taxes later.</p>

<blockquote>According to the Federal Reserve’s “Flow of Funds” report, released last month, the net worth of the American household (measured as assets minus liabilities) stands at a robust $51 trillion &#8211; yes, that’s trillion with a “T.” This isn’t just higher than last year (or the year before that; or the year before that). It’s almost twice what it was in 1995 and over 27 percent higher than it was in 1998 &#8211; right in the middle of Clinton’s “economic miracle.” &#8230; The result of all this is the highest level of household wealth in our nation’s history.</p></blockquote>
<p>Given that the price-level has increased by 16.5% over the past seven years, aggregate real wealth has increased by only 9% since 1998.  Given that population has increased by 7.4% over this same time period, real wealth per capita is now only 1.5% higher than it was in 1998.  Add to these simple realizations the fact that real wealth per capita increased by more than 1.5% from 1998 to 1999, Mr. Bowyer’s claim is ludicrous. Yet, we hear this same claim over and over from NRO Financial.</p>

<blockquote>Jack Abramoff, the once-powerful lobbyist at the center of a wide-ranging public corruption investigation, pleaded guilty yesterday to fraud, tax evasion and conspiracy to bribe public officials in a deal that requires him to provide evidence about members of Congress.</p></blockquote>
<p>In <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/03/AR2006010301536.html">a companion analysis</a>, two Post reporters (Birnbaum and Balz) do their part to dispel the myth that Abramoff&#8217;s corruption was bipartisan:<br />
<blockquote>Jack Abramoff represented the most flamboyant and extreme example of a brand of influence trading that flourished after the Republican takeover of the House of Representatives 11 years ago. Now, some GOP strategists fear that the fallout from his case could affect the party&#8217;s efforts to keep control in the November midterm elections.</p>
<p>Abramoff was among the lobbyists most closely associated with the K Street Project, which was initiated by his friend Tom DeLay (R-Tex.), now the former House majority leader, once the GOP vaulted to power. It was an aggressive program designed to force corporations and trade associations to hire more GOP-connected lobbyists in what at times became an almost seamless relationship between Capitol Hill lawmakers and some firms that sought to influence them.</p></blockquote>
<p>Slate has a nice run-down of <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2133666/">who&#8217;s most at risk</a> from a newly loquacious Abramoff.</p>
<p>AB</p>
<p>ADDENDUM:</p>
<p>I like <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/04/politics/04assess.html">the NYT&#8217;s take</a> on this, too:<br /><nyt_text></nyt_text>
</p>
<blockquote><p>WASHINGTON, Jan. 3 &#8211; As a high-flying Republican lobbyist, <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/a/jack_abramoff/index.html?inline=nyt-per" title="More articles about Hillary Rodham Clinton.">Jack Abramoff</a> has long been known as a mover and shaker in Washington. But when he cut a deal with federal prosecutors on Tuesday, he shook up this town as never before.</p></blockquote>
<p>Since that&#8217;s the lead paragraph, I suppose I can forgive this headline: &#8220;Tremors Across Washington as Lobbyist Will Aid Inquiry.&#8221; Geographically speaking, &#8220;Across Washington&#8221; is probably accurate; politically speaking, however, I suspect the tremors are quite concentrated.</p>

                                <p>One of my New Year’s resolutions is to actually say a few nice things about op-eds from NRO Financial – <em>when warranted</em>.  And lo and behold <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_comment/tamny200601030801.asp">John Tamny</a> tries to make this easy for me.  He starts off with:<br />
<blockquote>A recent article in <em>USA Today</em> lamented the lack of investor returns in 2005 outside of energy stocks and Google shares. To wit, while S&#038;P 500 earnings are up nearly 50 percent since 2000, the index remains 20 percent off its high.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, the price to earnings ratio has fallen as <a href="http://www.vtoreport.com/pe_ratio.htm">this link</a> documents. Tamny asks why and offers this explanation:<br />
<blockquote>Although earnings presumably belie the S&#038;P’s price, the index’s performance becomes more explainable once the nature of those earnings comes into full view. In the last quarter alone, S&#038;P earnings rose 16.1 percent. But that same number falls to 10.4 percent when you strip out the earnings of oil companies. While the latter result might at first glance seem unimportant, it becomes very important when you take into account the history of government reaction to commodity profits worldwide.</p></blockquote>
<p>Until the last sentence, I found myself nodding my head in partial agreement.  After all, the price to earnings ratio varies across sectors just as it varies across companies.  <a href="http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/pedata.html">Aswath Damodaron</a> provides sector wide price to earnings ratios (as of January 2005 in addition to providing data for the years 1999 to 2003), which vary substantially across sectors as well as across time.  His tables across provide data on the fundamentals of market valuations including expected earnings growth.  </p>
<p>One of the explanations for the very high price to earnings ratios of the early 2000’s was simply that the market expected rapid earnings growth in the future.  As Tamny notes, S&#038;P earnings are currently about 1.5 times where they were back then.  If the market is no longer expecting rapid earnings growth, traditional financial economics would suggest a lower price to earnings ratio.  Tamny also notes that oil company stocks have led this growth of late.  Unless the market expects oil company stocks to continue to increase rapidly, then why would anyone be surprised that the price to earnings ratio for an oil company stock would be lower than the overall price to earnings ratio?</p>

                                <p>I’d like to start the New Year with a prediction related to the following parlor game.  Which will occur first: (a) our Social Security Trust Fund reserve will reach its peak; or (b) China will become the world’s largest economy?  My prediction is (b).  </p>
<p>I call this a parlor game because discussions of which nation has the largest absolute GDP strike me as odd.  After all – if California succeeded from the U.S., its GDP would currently be less than that of China.  Yet we have a much higher level of income per capita.  Via <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2005/12/will_china_grow.html">Mark Thoma</a>, we see Bloomberg’s <a href="http://quote.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000039&#038;refer=columnist_berry&#038;sid=aiveEi_ZUHak">John M. Berry</a> saying my prediction is not possible:<br />
<blockquote>China&#8217;s economy is growing so fast that estimates of its long-term prowess are bordering on the absurd. After Chinese statisticians recently sharply revised up their estimate of economic output in 2004 to $1.93 trillion, some analysts said that in 35 years it would overtake the U.S. economy. No way, no how. The U.S. simply has too big a lead, with gross domestic product last year at $11.73 trillion. Even if China&#8217;s GDP were to grow indefinitely at 11 percent a year &#8211; 9 percent real growth plus 2 percent inflation &#8211; and the U.S. experienced 5.5 percent growth &#8211; 3.5 percent real and 2 percent inflation &#8211; it would take the Chinese 40 years to catch up in terms of nominal GDP. Sustainable nominal GDP growth of 5.5 percent annually is well within the capability of the U.S. Eleven percent growth, about what Chinese authorities expect in 2006, isn&#8217;t remotely possible in the long run. One reason China&#8217;s economic growth looks so formidable is the sheer size of its population, just over 1.3 billion as of the middle of this year, compared with slightly fewer than 300 million in the U.S., according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Yet that comparison is misleading in calculating the availability of workers to fuel economic growth. Partly as the result of continued immigration, legal and illegal, U.S. population is increasing by 0.92 percent a year, according to census estimates. With no net immigration and with its government&#8217;s harsh rule of one child per family, China&#8217;s population is expanding at a much smaller 0.58 percent rate.</p></blockquote>
<p>There are at least a couple of things wrong with Mr. Berry’s logic, which has motivated me to produce pictorials from a couple of simple Excel models – the first one roughly capturing what Mr. Berry is trying to say.  Each model forecasts real GDP (2004$) for both China and the U.S. using Mr. Berry’s assumptions that U.S. growth will continue to be 3.5% per year, while China’s growth will be 9% per year.  Each model also assumes the U.S. population will grow by 0.9% per year, while China’s will grow by 0.6% per year.  It turns out that both nations would have real GDP equal to $39 trillion by 2039.  As the <a href="http://neweconomist.blogs.com/new_economist/2005/12/can_china_overa.html">New Economist</a> suggested: growth arithmetic is not Mr. Berry’s strong suit. </p>

<p>The New Economist also provides links to some other very good discussions with the piece from <a href="http://sun-bin.blogspot.com/2005/12/when-will-chinas-gdp-overtake-us.html">Sun Bin</a> of special interest.  Notice that in my first pictorial, China’s population is projected to still be four times that of the U.S. in 2039 according to Mr. Berry’s own forecasting procedure.  Sun Bin notes that China’s income per capita could readily reached 25% of the U.S. income per capita within 15 years (by 2019).  In fact, using PPP-adjusted GDP figures, China’s income per capita was 14% of the U.S. income per capita according to the data provided by the CIA’s <a href="http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/ch.html#Intro">World Factbook</a>.  The New Economist notes that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_%28PPP%29">Wikipedia</a> provides two other PPP-adjusted GDP series with roughly the same conclusion.  Our second pictorial depicts another Excel model that starts with the CIA provided data for 2004 and uses the assumptions that Mr. Berry provided and yet called absurd.  </p>
<p><a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/uploaded_images/b2-713459.JPG"><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/uploaded_images/b2-704332.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Perhaps China will not overtake the U.S. in terms of GDP by 2014, but Sun Bin provides evidence on relative GDP per capita that suggests that China could overtake the U.S. in terms of absolute GDP by 2019.  Ah, but the White House is telling us that Social Security benefits will start exceeding payroll taxes a couple of years before 2019.  Maybe, but the Trust Fund will still be earning lots of interest income on its reserves – so they should continue growing for a couple of more years.  There is, however, one potential flaw in my fearless long-term forecast – the GOP controls both the White House and Congress at least for the rest of this year.  Let’s just hope they don’t somehow manage to mess up the Social Security Trust Fund.</p>

Over the past decade, the growth in each has been roughly similar. But also note that the growth in the payroll survey from 1998 to early 2001 exceeded the growth in the adjusted household survey.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>While macroeconomists spend a lot of effort trying to understand the volatility of output, we spend less time worrying about whether output should be measured by real GDP or real GNP.  As we discussed <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/12/multinationals-and-national-income.html">here</a>, the difference between GNP and GDP (known as net income from abroad) is quite modest for the U.S.  If we look at quarterly data from 1970 to today, average real GDP growth has been 0.769% per quarter (annualized, this amounts to less than 3.1% per year), while average real GNP growth has been 0.767%.  In other words, not much difference since net income from abroad was only 0.7% at the beginning of this period with the ratio being half of that for the end of the period.  The standard deviation of real GNP growth was 0.852% over this period as compared to 0.847% for real GDP growth.  In fact, the only significant differences between the two series seems to be the last quarter of 2001 when real GNP growth exceeded real GDP growth by 0.6% and the first quarter of 2002 when real GDP growth exceeded real GNP growth by 0.5%.  </p>
<p>As I was preparing <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/12/irish-economic-miracle-and-tax-policy.html">this post</a> on Ireland’s economic growth, I recalled a paper from <a href="http://www.esri.ie/pdf/QEC0404_Mccarthy.pdf">Colm McCarthy</a> entitled <em>Volatility in Irish Quarterly Macroeconomic Data</em>, which notes:<br />
<blockquote>The quarter-to-quarter volatility in real macroeconomic aggregates, including gross output (GDP) and gross income (GNP), is very pronounced for the Irish data, more so than for other OECD countries. </p>
<p>The principal source of volatility in Irish real GDP lies in the recorded figures for industrial output. </p>
<p>Within the industrial output category, which is the aggregate of manufacturing and construction, the excess volatility can be traced to a small number of manufacturing sub-sectors. </p>
<p>These sub-sectors are known to be dominated by exporting multinationals, whose shares in recorded output greatly exceed their shares in employment or in the generation of domestic demand. Recent patterns of growth in these manufacturing sub-sectors show very sharp rises in output, exports and Gross Value Added (GVA), unaccompanied by commensurate movements in employment or payroll.</p></blockquote>
<p>As I read his introduction, I was wondering if much of the GDP volatility might be due to variations in the degree of transfer pricing manipulation.  McCarthy’s conclusion certainly raises the issue of transfer pricing:<br />
<blockquote>The Irish economy has a high GDP/GNP ratio as well as large short-run variations in value-added components other than wages. This paper finds that the Irish quarterly macro data are being seriously distorted by the unusual structure of Irish Manufacturing. This relates to the, no doubt perfectly legitimate, activities of some multinational sectors. These sectors have output valuations dominated by profits rather than wages, and fluctuations in output composition or in transfer pricing or both are clearly at the source of the quarter-to-quarter volatility in overall activity as measured. Care is warranted in interpreting the seasonally adjusted data anyway, since the seasonal factors are based on a period of unprecedented change in the Irish economy. The ESA-95 national accounting rules do not cope easily with a large multinational sector and transfer pricing, and we suggest that the CSO might consider some method of smoothing the Net Factor Payments numbers, and perhaps some other components, on a quarterly basis. </p></blockquote>
<p>Figure 1 of his paper shows how unusually high Ireland’s GDP/GNP ratio is, while figure 2 points out that this ratio has increased over the last couple of generations.  Figure 2, however, only points out that Ireland’s real GNP growth has been less than its real GDP growth.  McCarthy also notes that Ireland’s real GNP growth is almost as volatile as its real GDP growth.</p>

                                <p>As the GOP argues that Congress is cutting spending to reduce the deficit, <a href="http://www.cbpp.org/12-28-05tax.htm"> Robert Greenstein, Joel Friedman, and Aviva Aron-Dine</a> present evidence that demonstrate: (1) their actions will actually increase the deficit and (2) their actions are just another example of reverse Robin Hood-ism:<br />
<blockquote>Sometime early next year, the House of Representatives is expected to vote on the budget reconciliation legislation that the Senate passed on December 21 and the House passed in a slightly different version on December 19.  That legislation would make significant cuts in a number of programs serving low- and moderate-income families and individuals, including Medicaid, child support enforcement, and student loans.</p>
<p>Supporters of the legislation defend the cuts as “tough choices” that need to be made because of large and growing budget deficits.  These claims are undercut by the fact that, in the last six weeks, the House has passed four tax-cut bills that together cost more than twice what the budget reconciliation bill saves.  The claims are further undermined by Congress’s unwillingness to rethink any previously enacted tax cuts as part of its supposed reevaluation of priorities in light of deficits.</p>
<p>In particular, Congress has chosen to allow two tax cuts that exclusively benefit high-income households &#8211; primarily millionaires &#8211; to begin taking effect on January 1, 2006.  By 2010, these tax cuts will eliminate two current provisions of the tax code that limit the value of the personal exemptions and itemized deductions that people at high income levels can take.</p></blockquote>
