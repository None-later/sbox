<p> Bankrupt Rhetoric</p>
<p> I woke up this morning to Paul Ryan, describing his budget proposal, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/21/us/politics/house-republicans-release-budget-blueprint.html?ref=todayspaper&#038;pagewanted=print">as quoted in the <i>New York Times</i></a>: “This is about putting an end to empty promises from a bankrupt government.”</p>
<p>Bankrupt government? Let’s consider this more closely. The normal meaning of bankrupt is negative net worth, as when your liabilities exceed your assets. By this standard, the US government is hardly bankrupt, since it has enormous hard assets and an even larger soft one, the legal right to tax the income, transactions and property of all individuals and organizations subject to US law. We should all be so bankrupt!</p>
<p>So I guess Ryan is not using the normal business meaning of the word. Perhaps for him bankrupt means having negative earnings over some period of time. Here is the federal government’s fiscal record since 1929:</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ZuYwKLFk_Uw/T2mPEe1O_7I/AAAAAAAAA0M/9hYhKBL6jQ8/s1600/Federal+surplus+or+deficit+as+percent+gdp.gif"><img border="0" height="287" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ZuYwKLFk_Uw/T2mPEe1O_7I/AAAAAAAAA0M/9hYhKBL6jQ8/s400/Federal+surplus+or+deficit+as+percent+gdp.gif" width="400"></a></p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />So during what periods has the federal government been “bankrupt”? During every year when outlays exceeded revenues? That would include nearly all of modern history since the 1960s. Or when the fiscal deficit exceeded, say, 5% of GDP? That’s a smaller time frame—basically the past few years since the financial crisis hit and WWII. But if the government is bankrupt now, how bankrupt was it in the days of FDR and the struggle against Germany and Japan? And what does it mean to be bankrupt if the US could be really, really bankrupt in the 1940s and then bounce back to fiscal health almost immediately as soon as the troops came home?</p>
<p>And if the US government is bankrupt today, how come it can raise money at approximately a zero real interest rate?</p>
<p>And on a philosophical level, how does Ryan measure the financial health of government when its purpose is not to make itself rich but to support the prosperity of everyone else?<br />My translation of the way Ryan uses the word “bankrupt” would be “I want to scare everyone about the current fiscal deficit, and the best way to do it is to use a business-sounding term that has no meaning at all in this situation and hope that the public, and especially the journalists, are too dumb to notice.”</p>

<blockquote>As it currently stands, the “JOBS” bill now before the Senate would gut investor protection in the United States.  The title of the bill is a complete misnomer – anything that weakens investor protection makes it more risky to invest in companies and increases the cost of capital to honest entrepreneurs.  (For more background on the bill and links, <a href="http://baselinescenario.com/2012/03/19/a-colossal-mistake-of-historic-proportions-the-jobs-bill/" target="_blank">see this piece</a>.) </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p> &#8230; </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Specifically, Senator Reed’s amendment would close or limit a major loophole that will allow large companies to avoid registering with the SEC (and therefore escape much regulation).  The Reed Amendment would clarify how to define “shareholders” for the purpose of determining if a business is so widely owned that it must register with the SEC.  Under the Amendment, the count should be based on beneficial owners of the shares, i.e., real people.  The goal is to prevent evasion of the SEC registration threshold through “nominal” owners holding the shares for large numbers of beneficial owners.   Big companies like H.R. 3606 – they will be regulated less and if the cost of capital rises for start-ups, that actually helps them.  The Chamber of Commerce, the American Bankers’ Association, and the Independent Community Bankers of America have all weighed in heavily against the Reed Amendment – the idea of escaping SEC scrutiny greatly appeals to them.</p></blockquote>

<p>Is Congress drinking Grover Norquist koolaid? (or will it fund IRS appropriately)</p>
<p> IRS Commissioner Doug Shulman testified before the House Appropriations Financial Services and General Government Subcommittee on President Obama’s proposed 2013 budget for the IRS. Shulman wants Congress to provide adequate funding to the IRS to support its enforcement function. The IRS has 5000 fewer employees this filing season than in 2011, and Shulman is worried about the impact of that decline in enforcement capability on compliance and collections. See Rubin, <a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2012/03/The%20House%20Appropriations%20Financial%20Services%20and%20General%20Government%20Subcommittee%20will%20hold%20a%20hearing%20on%20President%20Obama%E2%80%99s%20proposed%202013%20budget%20for%20the%20IRS%20%20at%2010%20a.m.%20in%20Room%202359,%20Rayburn%20House%20Office%20Building.%20IRS%20Commissioner%20Douglas%20Shulman%20will%20testify.">IRS Eliminated 5,000 Jobs in past year amid budget cuts</a>, Bloomberg (Mar.21, 2012).</p>
<p>Now, those &#8220;starve-the-beast&#8221; types that drink the Grover Norquist koolaid are generally just eager to kill all government, and particularly government programs that help ordinary people, are concerned with the general public good, or help ensure the vitality of important government programs. </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<ul>
<li>So it seems that the right has no trouble talking about a need to return the US&#8217;s dismal health care system back to what it was before the little bit of progress accomplished in the Obama health reform legislation&#8211;they talk about eliminating government interference, but what they mean is letting health care profit centers, doctors, and insurers continue to rip off the American public that can least afford it with rentier profits. </li>
<li>And the right has no trouble with unfunding the EPA or enacting foolish laws restricting the agency&#8217;s ability to protect ordinary Americans&#8217; health, livelihood, and simple quality of life through much needed environmental regulations that protect, air, water, land, and natural resources for the future. Two examples&#8211;the right&#8217;s push to &#8220;drill, baby, drill&#8221; with the claim that a trickle more of US oil will dent world prices (nope); and the right&#8217;s push for the Keystone Pipeline no matter what the cost in aquifers or natural environments, even though the benefits are likely to be miniscule (VERY few jobs; no real impact on world energy prices). </li>
<li>The right wants to privatize Medicare&#8211;that means that it would take a program that has proven it can deliver health care more affordably to all its participants than privately financed &#8220;competitive&#8221; health care, and make it into its poorly functioning cousin. One suspects that the goal here is to bury a government program that is working as intended, so that it will be even harder to move to the obvious solution for health care that the rest of the developed world recognized decades ago&#8211;Medicare for all, or a &#8220;single payer&#8221; system that has clout, provides portability and fairness.</li>
</ul>
<p>And a component of the &#8220;starve-the-best; no-tax-increases-ever&#8221; koolaid package seems to be a desire to let the rich (the natural constituents of the right) get richer by continuing to be let off the hook on paying their fair share of taxes, while the overwhelming majority of Americans slip back into a much less hospitable context of just barely getting by. Taxes, of course, are one of the ways that is done, because it is so easy to hide the real purpose under a facade of caring about deficits (cut &#8220;entitlement&#8221; programs to save money) or growth (expand subdidies for the rich, to &#8220;grow&#8221; the economy).</p>
<p>So the IRS suffered from budget cuts that reduced its enforcement personnel. The result, of course, means fewer trained government officers to audit taxpayers and to investigate scandals like the wealthy millionaires and billionaires hiding their wealth overseas to avoid paying their fair share of taxes. And the danger is that criminal and civil tax evasion will be missed, because there are so few audits (only 1% audited annually) or that even compliant taxpayers will start to take their chances with the audit lottery once they realized that the IRS is part of the beast that the right is starving to death.</p>
<p>So Shulman is worried, he says, that budget cuts will erode voluntary compliance. He wants $12.8 billion for the IRS for the new fiscal year, an 8% increase. Rubin, <a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2012/03/The%20House%20Appropriations%20Financial%20Services%20and%20General%20Government%20Subcommittee%20will%20hold%20a%20hearing%20on%20President%20Obama%E2%80%99s%20proposed%202013%20budget%20for%20the%20IRS%20%20at%2010%20a.m.%20in%20Room%202359,%20Rayburn%20House%20Office%20Building.%20IRS%20Commissioner%20Douglas%20Shulman%20will%20testify.">IRS Eliminated 5,000 Jobs in past year amid budget cuts</a>, Bloomberg (Mar.21, 2012).</p>
<p>He should get it. Every dollar spent on enforcement brings in multiples of revenues, so the cost-benefit analysis clearly favors adequately funding the IRS enforcement budget so that it can do its job. That helps in two ways&#8211;it produces revenues that reduce the deficit, and it reminds people that our voluntary compliance system is backed up by enforcement of the laws&#8211;they can&#8217;t just cheat and play the audit lottery with high hopes of getting by.</p>
<p>And cutting the IRS does &#8220;long-term damage&#8221;. Jose Serrano, Id.</p>
<p>So will Congress keep swallowing the Norquist Koolaid, or will it buckle down and make decisions that support the wellbeing of our nation and of our people? We will see.</p>

                                <p>Given Ryan’s release of his new plan calling for territorial taxation of corporations comes this example of Apple from Kenneth Thomas, <a href="http://middleclasspoliticaleconomist.blogspot.com/2012/03/apple-whines-about-having-to-pay-taxes.html">Middle class political economist</a> econoblog:</p>
<p>Apple Whines About Having to Pay Taxes<br />by<strong> Kenneth Thomas</strong><br />   <br />On Monday, <a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2012/03/19Apple-Announces-Plans-to-Initiate-Dividend-and-Share-Repurchase-Program.html">Apple announced</a> that it was going to start paying dividends to shareholders, and buy back $10 billion worth of stock. What caught many people&#8217;s attention in the subsequent conference call, however, was the company&#8217;s <a href="http://idealab.talkingpointsmemo.com/2012/03/white-house-unmoved-by-apples-offshore-cash-problem.php?ref=fpnewsfeed">pointed statement</a> that it would not be bringing back any of the cash it holds overseas, estimated at $64 billion, or over 64% of its current cash on hand.    <br />The reason, as stated by Chief Financial Officer Peter Oppenheimer, is that it would have to pay taxes on this money if it were repatriated to the United States. Apple made the money, so it owes taxes on it just like you or I would. But because the money was earned overseas (though realistically, some of it probably got there through <a href="http://middleclasspoliticaleconomist.blogspot.com/2011/11/how-transfer-pricing-hurts-middle-class.html">transfer pricing</a>), it can defer paying taxes on it until the money comes home. Taxes deferred are taxes reduced due to the time value of money, but that&#8217;s not enough for Apple. In good <a href="http://middleclasspoliticaleconomist.blogspot.com/2012/01/jon-stewart-delivers-goods-on-mitt.html">Mitt Romney fashion</a>, Apple is <a href="http://idealab.talkingpointsmemo.com/2012/03/white-house-unmoved-by-apples-offshore-cash-problem.php?ref=fpnewsfeed">working with other companies</a> to try to get the tax laws changed in its favor.What they want, as Carl Franzen of TPM points out, is a &#8220;repatriation holiday&#8221; that will allow them to bring back the money at a greatly reduced tax rate, as in 2004. Franzen notes:</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />
<blockquote>However, in that 2004 experiment, pharmaceutical companies were the largest beneficiaries and although $312 billion was brought back into the U.S. by some 800 companies, most of the money was spent on dividends and stock repurchases, as <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-09-29/google-joins-apple-mobilizing-lobbyists-to-push-for-tax-holiday-on-profits.html"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/20/business/20tax.html?pagewanted=all"><em>the New York Times</em></a> both reported, referring to numerous studies. In fact, some of the companies that benefited the most from the 2004 tax holiday ended up laying off employees.</p></blockquote>
<p>Today, despite having just gone through the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, U.S. multinationals now have over three times as much overseas as was brought back in 2004, some $1 trillion, according to Franzen&#8217;s article. Apple&#8217;s action Monday suggests that more dividends and stock repurchases would be the order of the day once again if they got their way.  <br />According to <a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/fox/2012/03/how-to-bring-apples-overseas-c.html">Justin Fox</a>, the $64 billion is &#8220;sitting in Apple&#8217;s overseas subsidiaries&#8230;&#8221; This almost certainly means it is in Ireland: According to Apple&#8217;s <a href="http://investor.apple.com/secfiling.cfm?filingID=1193125-11-282113&#038;CIK=320193">2011 Annual Report</a> (Exhibit 21.1), it has only two &#8220;significant&#8221; subsidiaries outside the country (and one significant subsidiary in the U.S.), both of which are in Ireland. Apple, then, is simultaneously benefiting from Ireland&#8217;s tax haven status and the deferral provisions of U.S. tax law.  <br />What should be done? <a href="http://middleclasspoliticaleconomist.blogspot.com/2011/11/how-profitable-fortune-500-companies.html">I agreed with Citizens for Tax Justice</a> in January that not taxing worldwide corporate profits would give companies even more incentive to make their profits show up overseas than they do now. Fox notes a similar argument from tax attorney Edward D. Kleinbard, who says that ending the deferral provision is the right way to go. That way, companies&#8217; income would be taxed in the year it was earned, and multinationals would get no benefit relative to domestic companies that don&#8217;t squirrel away their profits overseas. It would go a long way to ending our current situation where there is one tax law for the 1% and another one for the rest of us.</p>

                                <p>Who gets water at what prices in the US still appears to be considered a local issue in the US at its core, and at best regional during droughts that cross borders or as it pertains to agricultural use and &#8216;retail&#8217; (cities and burbs).</p>
<p> The issue of private versus public ownership is <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/search?q=drought+2007" target="_blank">not very visible yet in US news</a>, nor our need to <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/12/water.html" target="_blank">repair our infrastructure</a> (see my series on water  <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/search?q=water" target>links to Part 1-5</a>) .  And our friends in Texas haven&#8217;t sent any recent alerts to me on their current problems (have any of us followed any other drought concerns on the national stage?).  Water distribution questions did actually make national news in 2007/2008 droughts along the east coast and southwest but quickly disappeared.  However, the fault lines on who has access to water, news on how we actually obtain fresh water,  and questions on price structures became quite sharp and very legal in a only a year or two.</p>
<p>The question on an international scale remains largely invisible to US and perhaps is time to revisit.  The IMF and World Trade Organization ownership rules are considered arcane and not relevant unless it involves the occasional town water supply and a company like Nestle&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Ian Wren and David Zetland have begun the <a href="http://waterdatahub.org/">Water Data Hub</a> to help centralize primary source material worldwide.  The authors announced the hub to help centralize data at David&#8217;s <a href="http://www.aguanomics.com/2012/03/water-data-hub-is-live.html" title="http://www.aguanomics.com/2012/03/water-data-hub-is-live.html">Aguanomics</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;ve been looking for a centralized source of water data for over a year, a place where I could go to find data on any kind of water question.</p>
<p>Although that quest led me to <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=ibnet&#038;sitesearch=aguanomics.com#hl=en&#038;sclient=psy-ab&#038;q=ibnet%7Cib-net+site:aguanomics.com&#038;oq=ibnet%7Cib-net+site:aguanomics.com&#038;aq=f&#038;aqi=&#038;aql=1&#038;gs_sm=3&#038;gs_upl=13081l14906l0l15625l7l7l0l0l0l0l67l364l7l7l0&#038;gs_l=serp.3...13081l14906l0l15625l7l7l0l0l0l0l67l364l7l7l0.efis.1.&#038;pbx=1&#038;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.r_qf.,cf.osb&#038;fp=c0e94774f9e948be&#038;biw=1480&#038;bih=835">IBNET</a> &#8212; a fantastic resource on water utility data in many countries &#8212; I was unable to find a good centralized index of water data.    <br />Even more depressing, I was unable to get any interest or support out of organizations (USGS, World Bank, OECD, et al.) whose missions might imply support for just such an idea.</p>
<p>So, I decided to set up my own water data hub (WDH) &#8212; a central location that links to water data, no matter where it is, who owns it, or what dimension of water it describes.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Last November, I <a href="http://www.aguanomics.com/2011/11/bleg-drupal-programmer.html">asked for help</a> on this project, and Ian Wren (from San Francisco) joined me.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s thanks to Ian&#8217;s hard work (weekends and evenings!) that I can now invite you to visit <a href="http://waterdatahub.org/">waterdatahub.org</a>!</p>
<p>So, please go there and <i>add</i> data sources. The WDH, like <a href="http://www.aguanomics.com/2012/03/how-networks-grow-and-then-shrink-in.html">any network</a>, gains value with the number of links.</p>
<p>Oh, and don&#8217;t forget that <i>anyone</i> can add a link to the hub. You only need a <a href="http://waterdatahub.org/user/register">WDH account</a> (free and easy to set up). So, go ahead and add your favorite data source from the World Bank, Exxon-Mobile, the Nature Conservancy, et al.</p>
<p>Note by my wording that the WDH does <i>not</i> host, own or control data. It&#8217;s basically an index of data controlled by other organizations.<br />  <br />The big goal <i>now</i> is to make a census of data, so that we know what exists, what&#8217;s missing and what overlaps.<br />Future developments:
<ul>
<li>WDH 1.1: You can add records for data that exist but are not available to the public. This will make it easier to contact data owners to ask for access and &#8212; hopefully &#8212; to pressure them to release it to the public.</li>
<li>WDH 1.2: Anyone can comment on the <i>quality</i> of data sources held elsewhere; this will help everyone understand the uses and limitations of data &#8212; information that is not necessarily available from data owners.</li>
<li>WDH 2.0 (2013): We will start the very difficult process of &#8220;normalizing&#8221; data from many sources (using translation tables) to make it possible to assemble a data table from 2+ sources linked to the WDH.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the WDH will make it easier for <i>anyone</i> who analyzes data to do their job; analysis is too difficult to automate.</p>
<p>As you might expect, I am running WDH as a stand-alone, academic, non-profit. At the moment, we do not need money as much as your <i>time</i>.</p>
<p>Bottom Line: Please add new spokes to the WDH (get it?) and tell others about the water data hub.</p></blockquote>

<p>AARP vs. Social Security?</p>
<p>Last week <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/16/social-security-cuts-aarp_n_1344934.html?ref=daily-brief">Huffington Post</a></p>
<p>reported that AARP was embarking on a</p>
<p>&#8220;Social Security and Medicare &#8220;listening tour&#8221; called <a href="http://www.aarp.org/politics-society/advocacy/info-03-2012/earned-a-say-events-tn1796.html">&#8220;You’ve Earned a Say and We’re Listening.&#8221;</a> Through &#8220;town halls, community conversations, bus tours and other events,&#8221; the influential organization promises to offer members a chance to speak out on the simmering debate over the future of Social Security and Medicare.</p>
<p>&#8220;The outreach is part of the group&#8217;s campaign to restore <a href="http://firedoglake.com/2011/06/30/supporting-social-security-benefit-cuts-whats-in-it-for-aarp/">trust it lost</a> during last year&#8217;s spending debate, when a top AARP official told the<i> Wall Street Journal</i> the organization was open to cuts to the entitlement programs. &#8220;The ship was sailing. I wanted to be at the wheel when that happens,&#8221; AARP policy chief John Rother said, <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304186404576389760955403414.html">according to <i>the Wall Street Journal</i></a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;But while AARP staffers fan out across the country to hear from members, the group&#8217;s CEO, Barry Rand, will be listening to a different cast of characters.</p>
<p><a href="http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/saloninvite.pdf"><u>An AARP invitation</u></a> to a secret &#8220;Relaxed and Robust Evening of &#8216;Salon Style&#8217; Conversation&#8221; to be held at a Capitol Hill home on March 27, obtained by The Huffington Post, indicates that the organization is still very much interested in a &#8220;grand-bargain&#8221; style deal that puts Social Security and Medicare cuts on the table.<br />&#8220;&#8221;AARP is not pursuing any closed door deals or grand bargains,&#8221; said an AARP spokeswoman. &#8220;Our main focus is hearing from our members, and all Americans, what they think about ways to strengthen Social Security and Medicare. That&#8217;s precisely why we&#8217;re launching &#8216;You&#8217;ve Earned a Say.&#8217; We are interested in hearing from all sides and having civil discourse on these issues.&#8221;</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>&#8220;The invite list for 2012 suggests that AARP is still very much open to cutting Social Security and Medicare, as a majority of this year&#8217;s expected &#8220;thought leaders&#8221; have thoughts that involve slashing Social Security.<br />&#8220;&#8221;They want to be at the table when a deal is cut,&#8221; said one person who declined to be named because he continues to work closely with AARP. The irony is that while AARP&#8217;s legislative team may be convinced that a deal is inevitable, a grand bargain actively opposed by AARP would be effectively impossible for Congress to pass.&#8221;</p>
<p>What this amounts to is that AARP, granny&#8217;s lawyer, sees granny being raped by a bunch of thugs. But instead off rushing in to help her, he waits to see how the struggle is going. If it looks like the rapists are going to win, he will rush in to help them. Just in case, you know, there might be something in it for him.<br />There were 3700 comments on Huff Post to this article. Most of them understood that AARP is not one of the good guys, and their &#8220;we want to hear from you&#8221; is just a cynical smokescreen..no more than a survey to see how effective the lies have been. But sadly, not one of the 3700 comments showed any real understanding of Social Security or the &#8220;crisis&#8221; surrounding it. They have all grown up hearing the lies, and no effective answer to those lies. Not surprising when the politicians and the press are effectively owned by the Liars, and the &#8220;liberals&#8221; who defend Social Security always start out by talking as if the lies were true.<br />Rather than attempt to counter the lies, I will just repeat the simple truth here one more time and hope that someone finds a way to tell the people:</p>
<p>Social Security has nothing to do with the deficit, and it never will. Social Security is not going broke, and it never can. Social Security is not paid for by &#8220;the government.&#8221; It is paid for by the workers who will get the benefits. </p>
<p>With no change whatsoever Social Security can continue to provide &#8220;adequate&#8221; benefits so workers can afford at least a basic retirement after about forty years of work&#8230; that is when they reach 62, though they can get a larger monthly benefit if they choose to retire later. </p>
<p>IF those same workers as a voting majority decide they want the &#8220;same replacement rate&#8221; (monthly benefit as a percent of of their average lifetime real working wages) &#8230; over a longer life expectancy in retirement&#8230; they can raise their own payroll tax one half of one tenth of one percent per year&#8230; or about forty cents per week each year in today&#8217;s terms while their wages are increasing over one full percent per year&#8230; or about eight dollars per week per year.</p>
<p>Pretty much everything else you hear about Social Security is Lies or nonsense. There is no need to raise the cap, cut benefits, raise the retirement age, means test, or tax the rich. At most just a tiny raise in what amounts to an insurance premium to cover the increased costs associated with living longer in a richer society.</p>

                                <div>Just wanted to let everyone know about presentation that aired on Cspan&#8217;s Book TV.   It is a 2 hour panel discussion titles: Global Economy: Crisis Without End.  It was held 2/17/12.     <a href="http://www.booktv.org/Watch/13221/Panel+Discussion+Global+Economy+Crisis+Without+End+with+George+Soros+Paul+Krugman+Jeffrey+Sachs+Edmund+Phelps+and+Robert+Silvers.aspx">Click here</a>to bring up the show.</div>
<p>
<div>What I found most interesting was the different perspectives between Krugman and Sachs.  I&#8217;m not sure, but I don&#8217;t think either realized they were talking about the “crisis” from 2 different perspectives which leads to 2 different answers to what needs to be done.  Thus, they come across as if the other is wrong, when in my opinion, they are both correct.  Krugman says we need to do more now.  Yes we do.  Sach&#8217;s says we need to take the long view and start changing the direction we are going, namely calling for higher revenue raising by the government to be spent on the nation&#8217;s infrastructure, and he did not just mean physical infrastructure.  I guess you would say he was calling for the government folks to get real about raising capital and then doing capital expenditures.  Not exactly the thinking I would have expected from Sach&#8217;s considering his start in economic life: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_therapy_%28economics%29">Shock Therapy</a>.  </div>
<div></div>
<div>Maybe I was just seeing the difference in Keynes vs <a href="http://www.leftbusinessobserver.com/Sachs.html">Neoclassic Econ meets Bono</a>?  So as much as Sach&#8217;s appears to be calling for the correct long term solution, I don&#8217;t trust him as the one to lead the charge.</div>
<div></div>
<div>It was a very good discussion and there is more there than what I have keyed on.</div>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>JKH has magisterial <a href="http://monetaryrealism.com/jkh-on-the-recent-mmrmmt-debates-2/">post</a> up on the recent dust-up over Saving as perceived in various sectoral models — one-sector (global, for instance, or government- and trade-balanced domestic private sector); two-sector (government and private including international); the most common MMT construct, the three-sector model (government, domestic private, and international); the rather uncommon four-sector model (government, international, domestic household, and domestic business); or even a seven-billion-plus-sector model, in which each individual (and business, and government) is represented as a sector.
<p>His key point, I think — one I agree with profoundly — is that people need to be very clear on which model they’re assuming when they use the word Saving, or the construct “S.” (People sometimes use those two differently, with different implied sectoral models, sometimes within a single discussion or even a single sentence.) In most cases the different constructs of saving and S that people throw around are absolutely valid within their (implicit) sectoral models. The problem arises when people are talking about different sectoral consolidations within the same discussion, without themselves and/or their interlocutors being (fully) aware of it.</p>
<p>I’ve left a few glancing comments over there, but it’s prompted me to write up some thinking here that’s conceptually related.</p>
<p>How do we think about the central bank, and actually the nature of money and the monetary system? I see a lot of people talking past each other because they’re talking about different levels of accounting consolidation. Here are four ways to look at the Fed:</p>
<p>1. It’s an independent institution, separate from Treasury and the reserve-holding banks.</p>
<p>2. It’s part of “government” — a consolidated entity comprised of Treasury and the Fed.</p>
<p>3. It’s part of the private sector monetary system — a consolidated entity consisting of the Fed and all the banks holding reserves at the Fed.</p>
<p>4. It’s part of a fully consolidated monetary system consisting of Treasury, the Fed, and all the reserve-holding banks.</p>
<p>I’m not going to explore all these fully — there’s a book (or several) there — but here are some thoughts on each that might illuminate how the thinking is very different depending on which you adopt, perhaps showing how quite a lot of unecessary confusion and cross-discussion might be avoided.</p>
<p>1. It’s an independent institution, separate from Treasury and the reserve-holding banks.</p>
<p>Even though this is the “reality” of our monetary system (as a result of legislative diktat), thinking about it this way results in an odd conceptual situation. We end up with a sovereign currency issuer (Treasury) that (like a household or business) has to borrow in order to spend, and a bank (the Fed) that can issue unlimited funds <em>ex nihilo</em> to purchase assets. This seems exactly the opposite of how one would imagine things would work.</p>
<p>2. It’s part of “government” — a consolidated entity comprised of Treasury and the Fed.</p>
<p>This is a preferred MMT construct, and it has much conceptual appeal. “Government” issues new money through Treasury spending, and Fed open-market and QE operations are basically fiddling around the edges of the money “supply,” largely for the purpose of interest-rate management. Yes, the Fed actually issues the money, but in this consolidated view “government” is doing the issuing through deficit spending, crediting people’s bank accounts with newly-created money.</p>
<p>3. It’s part of the private sector monetary system — a consolidated entity consisting of the Fed and all the banks holding reserves at the fed.</p>
<p>This makes conceptual sense, because all deposits ultimately resolve, consolidate, back to reserves at the Fed. In this construct, all the banks (<em>including</em> the Fed) are issuing private money as licensees of of the Fed, which ultimately derives its licensing authority from “government” (Treasury).</p>
<p>4. It’s part of a consolidated monetary system consisting of Treasury, the Fed, and all the reserve-holding banks.</p>
<p>Looked at this way, we could conceive of it all as a single big national bank, with deposits resolving back to reserves, which ultimately resolve back to the full faith and credit of the government (Treasury).</p>
<p>These are fairly sloppy characterizations. I know the JKHs and SRWs, Ramanans, Vimothys et. al could (and I hope will) express them more cogently and accurately. But I wanted to keep them brief to highlight my central point:</p>
<p>Different views, consolidations, of these entitites result if very different understandings of “how the monetary system works.” Each (properly presented, unlike here) is valid within its own construction, and each imparts an important understanding of how things work. The problem arises, as with Saving and “S,” when a person, or people in discussion, confute and confuse these different views, or switch among them during thinking and discussions.</p>

<p>Housing Bubbles: Less Frothy but Europe is Behind</p>
<p>Wolfgang Muenchau’s article in the Financial Times, <a href="http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/28a4cfdc-6f6b-11e1-9c57-00144feab49a.html#axzz1pZj3RU4S">There is no Spanish siesta for the Eurozone</a>, inspired me to update my post on <a href="http://www.newsneconomics.com/2009/05/housing-bubbles-around-world-looks.html">housing bubbles around the world</a> (really just Europe and the US). He argues that Spain’s bubble was much more extreme, and that the price adjustment is less mature compared to the others. I would add here that it’s European housing markets more broadly that look overvalued compared to that in the US, as measured by the price to rent ratio.</p>
<p>The chart below illustrates the housing bubble, as measured by the house price to rent ratio, in the US, Spain, the UK, and Ireland that is normalized to Q1 1997 and through Q1 2011. The price to rent ratio can be compared to a price to earnings or a price to dividend ratio in finance. It measures the relative value of the asset: the price of the asset (purchase price of a home) divided by its flow of fundamental value (rental income earned or the value of having a roof over your head). As the price-rent ratio falls, the market home values moves closer to fundamental value.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/03/price_rent3.jpg"><img alt="" height="550" src="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/03/price_rent3.jpg" width="600"></a></p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />Spanning the years 2005 to Q4 2011 and indexed to 1997 Q1, home values peaked at roughly 1.7 times rent in the US, 1.8 times rent in Spain, and north of 2 time rent in Ireland and the UK. Since the peak, though, US home values have fallen to 1.0 times rent &#8211; a considerable reduction in asset prices toward fundamental value. In contrast, home values in Spain, the UK, and Ireland remain quite elevated to rents, 1.3 times, 1.6 times, and 1.4 times, respectively in Q4 2011. If 1.0 is deemed equilibrium, either home values in Spain, the UK, and Ireland must fall further <strong>and/or</strong> rents rise to normalize home values. That’s a tall order: rising rental values amid defficient and contracting domestic demand in Spain and possibly Ireland.</p>
<p>The UK has more of a fighting chance, given its relatively easy monetary policy, compared to Ireland and Spain, where more accommodative monetary policy is very lagged amid fiscal contraction. Without growth, though, default is probably the only answer left to normalize housing markets in Spain and Ireland.</p>
