<p>Brad DeLong has been <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2009/01/famas-fallacy-v-are-there-ever-any-wrong-answers-in-economics.html">denouncing</a> Eugene Fama for <a href="http://www.dimensional.com/famafrench/2009/01/bailouts-and-stimulus-plans.html">arguing that an identity proves that the stimulus won&#8217;t work as advertised.</a>   Greg Mankiw attempts to defend Fama by arguing that Fama was assuming that the classical model, in which all markets including the labor market clear, holds.  Brad DeLong notes that Fama made it very clear that he was not discussing the classical model.  I don&#8217;t have much to add, but I would like to note that Fama&#8217;s argument would be false if the world corresponded to a Real Business Cycle Model &#8212; that is the only type of classical model that any economist takes seriously as a model of short term fluctuations.</p>
<p>Before getting to my thoughts, this post got to be very long so I am banishing all of my summary of the debate so far past the jump.  Up here, just make the assumption that all markets clear so, among other things, labor demand equals labor supply and ask if Government deficit spending can cause an increase in measured GDP assuming that the product of public investment is no more productive than the products of private investment.  The answer, according to the classical model is clearly yes, so Mankiw&#8217;s defence of Fama fails on its own terms even if one overlooks the fact that Fama made it perfectly clear that he wasn&#8217;t assuming that the classical model describes reality.</p>
<p>The model in which Fama&#8217;s conclusion would be valid is the classical model with exogenous labor supply.  If capital is a state variable and labor supply is exogenous and all markets clear, then output is determined by the aggregate production function and can&#8217;t be affected by Government spending or anything else.  However, the question of whether it is reasonable to assume the classical model and fixed labor supply when discussing short term fluctuations is *not* a judgment call even under Mankiw&#8217;s very broad apparent definition as an issue with prominent economists on both sides.  Economists have noticed that aggregate hours worked fluctuate and that such fluctuations are correlated with other economic variables.  There are, amazing but true, two schools of thought on what is going on.  Some economists do indeed argue that the labor market always clears and that labor supply and demand are both fluctuating in response to other variables.  Others believe that there is such a thing as unemployment.  No one believes that it is a coincidence and that labor supply has nothing to do with anything else in the economy and is equal to labor demand.  No one.</p>
<p>The classical model as it appears in current research assumes endogenous labor supply.  It quickly becomes complicated, but has a clear implication that a temporary increase in wages causes an increase in labor supply (the temporary is needed to keep income effects small enough and how temporary is temporary enough depends on the shape of utility functions).   In particular if the increase in wages is brief enough, the response of labor supply goes to the compensated elasticity which, according to the model must be positive.  Sometimes it is assumed to be infinite.  In modern market clearing macro models it is always very high.</p>
<p>The elasticity of labor demand is also very high in such models, but this doesn&#8217;t matter.</p>
<p>What happens when the government spends more ?  Well to hire workers in the classical model they have to offer higher than prevailing wages.  The increase in wages causes labor supply to increase and private employment to decline.  Total employment increases because labor supply has increased.  Assuming that public capital spending is exactly as efficient as private capital spending the capital stock is higher than it would be if the Government hadn&#8217;t invested in infrastructure.</p>
<p>Fama&#8217;s conclusion is false if one assumes the classical model unless one assumes that labor supply is exogenous.  Now I&#8217;m sure the classical model with exogenous labor supply is exactly the classical model to which Mankiw refers.  However, no economist considers it a reasonable approximation to reality.</p>

<blockquote>There is an identity in macroeconomics. It says that in any given year private investment must equal the sum of private savings, corporate savings (retained earnings), and government savings (the government surplus, which is more likely negative, that is, a deficit),<br />PI = PS + CS + GS<br />(1)</p>
<p>In a global economy the quantities in the equation are global. This means the equation need not hold in a particular country, but it must hold in the world as a whole. For example, in recent years private investment in the US has been greater than the sum of private, corporate, and government savings in the US. This means the US has been importing savings from the rest of the world (by selling US securities to the rest of the world). But the equation always holds for the world as whole.</p>
<p>The quantities in the equation are not predetermined from year to year, and government actions affect them. The goal of government policy is to expand current and future incomes. When I analyze the auto bailout and the stimulus plan below, I judge them on whether they are likely to achieve this goal.</p>
<p>Government bailouts and stimulus plans seem attractive when there are idle resources &#8211; unemployment. Unfortunately, bailouts and stimulus plans are not a cure. The problem is simple: bailouts and stimulus plans are funded by issuing more government debt. (The money must come from somewhere!) The added debt absorbs savings that would otherwise go to private investment. In the end, despite the existence of idle resources, bailouts and stimulus plans do not add to current resources in use. They just move resources from one use to another</p></blockquote>

<p>N Greg. Mankiw has attempted to defend Eugene Fama writing</p>
<blockquote><p>In the case at hand, I think Fama&#8217;s arguments make sense in the context of the classical model, the model presented in Chapter 3 of my intermediate macro textbook, even if Fama in his brief essay does not spell out all the details of that model. Unlike Fama, and like Brad, I would not stop at that model. To understand the present situation, I would go on to the Keynesian model presented in Chapter 9 to 11. But whether one leaves the classical model behind to embrace the Keynesian model is a judgment call. On this particular judgment call, Brad and I agree, but I am not eager to castigate those like Fama who reach differing judgments.</p></blockquote>
<p>DeLong replies by noting that Fama made it perfectly clear that he was *not* talking about the classical model at all, since he assumed that there are &#8220;idle resources&#8221; which don&#8217;t exist in the classical model.  Obviously he is right.</p>
<p>I personally am more displeased by Mankiw&#8217;s insistence that &#8220;whether one leaves the classical model behind to embrace the Keynesian model is a judgment call.&#8221;  I think he means that prominent economists have made a different call than he and Brad have.  I believe (I admit I base this on brief contact with Mankiw long ago) that Mankiw decides that assertions about economics are worthy of castigation or not depending on whether they have been stated by a proiminent economist (a Nobel laureate is automatically so prominent that Mankiw thinks that his views must not be castigated but I think Mankiw believes that there is a much larger set of uncastigatable economists).  On the other hand, views which are not held by anyone in that club should sometimes be castigated. </p>
<p>Now I admit again that I am just guessing about Mankiw&#8217;s decision rule (and I admit that I have no doubt at all that my guess is correct).  But if there were an agent whose decision rule was that which I ascribe to Mankiw, that agent would be a menace.  The rule has nothing to do with evidence, data, or reality.  It can&#8217;t have any place in any field which aims to be a science.  I note that Brad didn&#8217;t use profanity or insult Fama&#8217;s character intellect or mother.  He the text of Fama&#8217;s post.  Only his conclusion &#8212; that Fama made an error not a judgment call &#8212; is unacceptable to Mankiw.</p>
<p>For completeness an edited version of my comment on Brad&#8217;s post.</p>
<p>Notice he didn&#8217;t say anything about the elasticity of labor supply.  One can have the labor market clearing a postitive elasticity of labor supply and have Government spending drive labor supply up (above the socially optimal level).  For Fama to be right one has to assume that markets clear *and* that labor supply is exogenouse, that it doesn&#8217;t depend on wges and prices.  Now even using Mankiw&#8217;s definition of &#8220;judgment call&#8221; which I interpret as meaning &#8220;prominent economists make different calls,&#8221; this is just not a judgment call.  People write down models with exogenous labor supply when they are focusing on long run growth, but, as far as I know, no economist has ever argued that, when discussing economic fluctuations, it is reasonable to assume both that the labor market clears and that labor supply is exogenous.</p>

<p><a target="_blank" ref="http://www.bloggingstocks.com/2009/01/14/martin-wolf-u-s-fiscal-stimulus-is-a-necessary-task-but-not-t/">Bloggingstocks</a> points to well known mainstream economists coming around to an Angry Bear point of view:</p>
<blockquote><p>Up ahead: two bigger tasks</p>
<p>What&#8217;s more, Wolf sees two additional tasks (structural changes) that are just as important to the goal of U.S. economic recovery &#8212; but that may be even harder to implement: removing toxic assets from the banking system and reducing the U.S.&#8217;s structural current account deficit (the trade deficit).</p>
<p>The first is the forced write-off of bad assets, fiscal recapitalization of the banks, or debt-for-equity tactic, and it should be done comprehensively and quickly. Slow, gradual bad-debt reduction is not the correct policy, Wolf argues, as it would delay the economic recovery.</p>
<p>Second, the U.S. must reduce its trade deficit, Wolf argues, and the reasoning here is overt and obvious enough: the U.S. can not afford to see demand float overseas (as it did throughout this decade), but needs that commercial activity to remain at home.</p>
<p>Economist Richard Felson agrees with Wolf, except regarding the pace of bank/financial institution removal of toxic assets. &#8220;Toxic asset write-downs need not be as quick as Wolf suggests because U.S. real estate prices, although they were high and in a bubble, were not as high relative to GDP as, for example, Japan&#8217;s during its bubble.&#8221; The toxic asset write-offs (or capital infusions by the government), should not take 10 years, in Felson&#8217;s view, but they should not be done in a year, either.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>Or maybe I did. Given that Peter Orszag is incoming head of OMB and I am, well, me, odds are I am the one in error. But I can&#8217;t find it.  Maybe someone here can help. <br />This started as an exchange in comments on <a target="_blank" href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/01/is-obama-echoing-bush-on-social.html">Is Obama Echoing Bush</a> Andrew Biggs claims the following<br />
<blockquote>As for the backwards transfer, this is pretty standard stuff now. Google &#8220;social security&#8221; &#8220;legacy debt&#8221; and you&#8217;ll find info on it &#8212; written by Peter Orszag and Peter Diamond, who last I checked weren&#8217;t part of the right wing conspiracy. As it happens, I haven&#8217;t argued whether the backward transfer was fair or not, in part because it doesn&#8217;t make any difference &#8212; what&#8217;s done is done. What I will say is that had early generations only gotten out what they paid in, plus interest, the trust fund today would be worth around $20 trillion and we wouldn&#8217;t face the prospect of tax increases or benefit cuts in the future. I&#8217;ll let others judge whether that makes sense or not.</p></blockquote>
<p> and explains that with this<br />
<blockquote>The current effect on the trust fund is equal to the difference between early participants&#8217; taxes (plus interest to today) minus their benefits (plus interest to today) &#8212; in other words, the present value.</p></blockquote>
<p>For those who haven&#8217;t been following along &#8220;backwards transfer&#8221; is a reference to some posts here  from last August. <a target="_blank" href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/08/soc-sec-xxxvi-14-trillion-backward.html">$17 trillion Backwards Transfer</a> &#038; <a target="_blank" href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/08/soc-sec-xxxvii-backwards-transfers.html">Backwards Transfer: Biggs Responds</a> and the reference to Orszag and Diamond seems to be related to <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/" target="_blank">Saving Social Security: the Diamond-Orzsag Plan</a> The link is to the intro, if you download the PDF you will find the relevant passage as follows:<br />
<blockquote>Third, and finally, our plan addresses the burden of the legacy debt. Benefits paid to almost all current and past cohorts of beneficiaries exceeded what could have been financed with the revenue they contributed. This difference is what we call the legacy debt. Without this debt—that is, if earlier cohorts had received only the benefits that could be financed by their contributions plus interest, the trust fund’s assets today would be much greater. Those assets would earn interest, which could be used to finance benefits.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well none of this sounds quite right to me for reasons I&#8217;ll outline below the fold.</p>
<p>First how much was actually paid out to these earlier cohorts and when? Well I went back and took a look at the tables, in particular Table IV.A2 which tracks income and cost from program inception right up to introduction of DI in 1957 and then Table IV.A4 which shows combined OASDI from 1957 to 2007.   </p>
<p>Tracking just benefits paid:   <br />OAS 1941-1956 $25.6 billion   <br />OASDI 1957-1968 $181 billion   <br />OASDI 1969-1980 $793.1 billion   <br />OASDI 1981-1992 $2.476.5 trillion   <br />OASDI 1993-2000 $2.829.3 trillion   <br />OASDI 2001-2007 $6.330,9 trillion   <br /> For a grand total of $12.636.4 trillion. Of particular note in context is the total paid out from 1941 to 1980: $999.7 billion. Why is 1980 significant? Because that is the last year that a retiree could have started drawing benefits WITHOUT paying in his entire work career. That is someone 65 in 1980 would have been 21 in 1936. So we have this cohort of &#8216;deadbeats&#8217; (which BTW includes most of the &#8216;Greatest Generation&#8217;) dragging down almost exactly a trillion dollars in benefits. But all of those benefits had been paid for, at the end of 1980 the Trust Fund was in very poor shape but still had $26.5 billion in accumulated surplus. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/VI_cyoper_history.html#159726">Table VI.A4.—Historical Operations of the Combined OASI and DI Trust Funds, Calendar Years 1957-2007 [Amounts in billions]</a>. And if we fast forward to today the youngest survivor of this group would be 93 years old and us sitting on a total surplus of $2.4 trillion.</p>
<p>So how does a fully paid for $1 trillion dollars in benefits to 1980, plus an additional $11.6 trillion in benefits fully paid for by the end of 2008 leaving a surplus of $2.4 trillion work out to impose trillions of dollars of &#8216;legacy&#8217; debt, still less the $17 trillion amount suggested by Biggs? I don&#8217;t see that his formulation helps us any. Benefits paid in 1980 using 1980 dollars are off the books, calculating their present value doesn&#8217;t make much sense to me. In any event someone needs to show their work. Because from the initial discussion we know the source of the $17 trillion claim. It comes from misunderstanding the following table:<br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SXN3gs-Z-tI/AAAAAAAAAD4/E86pEavHb9Y/s1600-h/2008_IV.B7.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SXN3gs-Z-tI/AAAAAAAAAD4/E86pEavHb9Y/s320/2008_IV.B7.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />(<s>I&#8217;ll try to get a bigger version in comments. Or maybe someone can give me an assist and blow this up a little)</s>(Click on the image here or the image in the first comment for a larger version).<br />The problem arises from not quite getting the definitions of &#8216;past&#8217; &#8216;current&#8217; and &#8216;future&#8217; participants as used by the Trustees and if I had to pinpoint the source of the error it would be in the following passage (bolding mine)<br />
<blockquote>The first line of table IV.B7 shows that the present value of future cost less future taxes over the next 100 years for all current participants equals $17.4trillion. For this purpose, current participants are defined as individuals who attain age 15 or older in 2008. Subtracting the current value of the trust fund (the accumulated value of past OASDI taxes less cost) gives a closed group (excluding all future participants) unfunded obligation of $15.2trillion. This value represents the shortfall of lifetime contributions for all past and current participants relative to the lifetime costs associated with their generations. For a fully-advance-funded program this value would be equal to zero.</p></blockquote>
<p> This does not bear the meaning that Biggs, and perhaps Orszag and Diamond,  place on it. That A + B = $C trillion does not mean that A > 0. Still less that A = $17 trillion. Or even $15 trillion. Instead you have to understand these &#8216;unfunded liabilities&#8217; include all projected gaps between revenue and cost for everyone born before 1994 all of the way out to 2108. Moreover all but $4.3 trillion actually occurs AFTER the 75 year window<br />
<blockquote>The values in table IV.B6 indicate that extending the calculations beyond 2082 adds $9.3 ($13.6 &#8211; $4.3) trillion in present value to the amount of the unfunded obligation estimated through 2082. That is, over the infinite horizon, the OASDI open group unfunded obligation is projected to be $13.6trillion. The $9.3trillion increment reflects a significant financing gap projected for OASDI over the infinite future period after 2082. Of course, the degree of uncertainty associated with estimates beyond 2082 is substantial.</p></blockquote>
<p>(BW: no shit). On my reading Diamond-Orzsag propose to start charging us in 2023 for a &#8216;legacy debt&#8217; that mostly won&#8217;t be incurred until after 2082. Yet blaming it on past participants (i.e. dead people) getting trillions in extra benefits. Sorry I just don&#8217;t see how the numbers support that. Past participants clearly paid for everything they got, the Trust Funds never actually went to zero in their lifetimes (though it got close in 1983). And that portion of current participants who are already retired will have paid for almost all their benefits, given that a relatively small portion of such retirees are likely to be alive in 2041 or 2048. For that matter that portion of current participants within 15 years or so of retirement are mostly paid up.</p>
<p>Perhaps someone can come up with some explanation of why it makes sense calculating bills already paid off in then current dollars adding up to future liabilities. On a cash flow basis it seems nonsense, as long as your income rate exceeds your cost rate it is hard to see how you could realistically be said to be in any kind of debt situation. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/IV_LRest.html#304086">Table IV.B1.—Estimated Annual Income Rates, Cost Rates, and Balances, Calendar Years 1990-2085 [As a percentage of taxable payroll]</a> It is hard to believe that two sentences could lead to so much confusion, but it looks like the culprit is right here:<br />

<p>Is proposing toxic sludge inc with a cooler name, while commenting on Krugman.</p>
<p>Krugman <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/01/17/bad-bank-bafflement/#comment-103849">writes</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Bad bank bafflement</p>
<p>The idea of setting up a “bad bank” or “aggregator bank” to take over the financial system’s troubled assets seems to be gaining steam. So let me go on record as saying that I don’t understand the proposal.</p></blockquote>
<p>I comment.</p>
<p>I am a fan of the big bad asset bank and I think it can be managed without any risk of giving huge amounts away, if assets are bought with shares in the big bad asset bank (dividends from payments on the underlying assets). I thnk that all mortgage based instruments should be requisitioned for the bank (shares distributed proportional to market prices as of the day before anyone takes this idea seriously)</p>
<p>Now I guess that supporters of the BBAB are not interested in my proposal, since I guess that a huge giveaway is their aim. However, I don’t think that it would be a pointless exercise. If all the suspect assets are put in one entity, you can buy its shares without worrying about adverse selection. If the problem with the funny assets markets is low trading volume making the market price far below the average hold to maturity value, because of adverse selection, then this is the solution.</p>
<p>(Also the Big Bad Asset Bank would be able to reassemble whole mortgages and renegotiate with debtors.)</p>
<p>I’d say the general argument is very simple. If the problem is adverse selection, the solution is mandatory pooling. There is no need for public money.</p>
<p>update:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/2009/01/the_idea_that_wont_die.php">Josh Marshall</a> and <a href="http://www.eschatonblog.com/2009_01_18_archive.html#4071505020066064194">Duncan Black</a> agree with Krugman.  I do to, in a way.  I agree that all existing Big Bad Asset Bank proposals are based on a desire to trick the public into giving banks money for nothing.  My proposal is a way to separate any efficiency gains from pooling from that transfer.  I&#8217;m sure that no one will be interested in my proposal, since the point of the proposals is to trick the public out of our money.  It is a way of trying to call BBAB proponents on their hypocrisy.</p>

<blockquote><p>Robert Waldmann winds up and asks a question: Hoisted from Comments:</p>
<p>    Grasping Reality: Fama&#8217;s Fallacy V: Are There Ever Any Wrong Answers in Economics?: &#8220;Economic science&#8221; is a phrase like &#8220;military intelligence.&#8221; Out of respect for my fellow economists and the DIA I won&#8217;t name that class of phrases. However, &#8220;economic theory&#8221; is a sub branch of mathematics. Within economic theory there are defintely false statements such as those made by Mankiw and Fama.</p>
<p>    I&#8217;m not surprised that Fama is making a fool of himself. He has made similarly nonsensical arguments in his own field of expertise. He has been a tenured head of a school of thought for a long time, and has probably forgotten what it was like to make arguments which weren&#8217;t accorded respect just because he made them.</p>
<p>    I don&#8217;t know what Mankiw thinks he&#8217;s doing. For one thing, he knows you and cannot hope that you will let the matter drop. I can only infer that he knows much more about the sociology of economists than I do and understands that, to be a mainstream economist in good standing, he has to take a hit for the team and claim not to have noticed Fama&#8217;s howler.</p>
<p>    To me the odd thing is the extent to which the economics profession can hide our embarrassing secrets. Not wanting to get Harvard graduates in trouble, I&#8217;d be inclined to take a poll of the general public to find out how many people understand that Nobel prizes have been awarded for working out detailed implications of the efficient markets hypothesis, for stating the rational expectations hypothesis (and not to Cournot or even Nash but to Lucas and if you doubt it check the citation) or uhm to Ed Prescott.</p>
<p>    Sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander, and, I note, that you claimed on this blog to think it was reasonable to award the Noble prize to Prescott and elsewhere described an argument which basically quoted something written under his name as failing the Turing test.</p>
<p>(Brad Delong responds)&#8221; Urrrkkk&#8230;</p>
<p>If I understand your argument, it is one I cannot refute. Yes, the Nobel Prize winners are the public authoritative face of our profession. So, yes, I think I have to change my mind&#8211;and concur with you that the Swedish Academy needs to pick Nobel Prize winners who are now wise as well as who once were very, very clever.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

                                <p>Global imbalances are about to take a dangerous turn, one that will make any escape from the present crisis almost impossible. We are on the brink of watching ill-designed global financial and trade policies collapse globally.</p>
<p>These policies have many players, not just the U.S. (The U.S. just happens to be one of the important lynch pins.) All have contributed their share, driven by self-interest and foolishness. No wise man has been at the helm. The mechanisms for this global collapse have been long in the making. Many of them have been studiously ignored or pooh-poohed; others have been celebrated as the new, marvelous world order.</p>
<p>The simplified version of this mechanism is: China has been not only one of the major purchasers of U.S. debt but also one of the main beneficiaries of the U.S. trade deficit.</p>
<p>That mechanism may be about to fail. If and when it does, the entire global edifice will shudder.</p>
<p>(rdan here&#8230;Menzie Chin weighs in with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.econbrowser.com/archives/2009/01/the_startling_d.html">some good charts at Econbrowser</a>)</p>
<p>Looking at the present fiasco from a global perspective may help the world later when it seriously tries to rebuild. If this post has any silver lining, that is it.</p>
<p>For a long time, China parked its export earnings in U.S. bonds&#8211;T-bills, agencies, etc&#8211;, keeping U.S. interest rates low, all of which contributed to the U.S. credit boom. (Greenspan is not the only villain; nor are the greedy banks with their subprime come-hither looks and their credit card gotchas.)</p>
<p>Many argued&#8211;including some commentators in this blog&#8211;that the U.S. did not have to worry about China&#8211;or any other country&#8211;losing its appetite for U.S. bonds. Such a country would be foolish to do so; after all, the U.S. is the strongest economy in the world and the dollar is the safest currency.</p>
<p>When Fannie and Freddie failed, Treasury insured that China&#8217;s investment was <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/09/fannie-mae-and-freddie-mac-broader-view.html" target="_blank">protected</a> even at significant cost to U.S. taxpayers. The implications were clear: Always treat your major creditor with respect.</p>
<p>Purchase of U.S. dollars was one way in which China kept its currency artificially low, providing steam to its export machine. Earlier this year, faced with a declining global appetite for its exports, the <a href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/92883-people-s-bank-of-china-chinese-dollar-bulls" target="_blank">Peoples&#8217; Bank of China</a> forced its</p>
<blockquote><p>commercial banks to build U.S dollar reserves, in a move that holds down the value of the Chinese Yuan, and in effect implements exchange rate intervention, have been revealed by HSBC’s currency team in Asia. The central bank has moved five times in five months to increase the reserve requirements, and stepping up the rate of increase with two extra moves in late June. The moves have increased the mandatory holdings of dollar reserves, from 15% to 17.5%, of anything that is lent out by commercial banks. The impact has been to peg the Yuan lower, and in that in effect has eased the burden of Chinese exporters struggling with a global economic slow-down. </p></blockquote>
<p>(Many of those Chinese exporters are, of course, foreign firms inside China. According to <a href="http://www2.blogger.com/angrybear.blogspot.com/2007_05_01_angrybear_archive.htm" target="_blank">Vice Premier Wu Li</a>, in 2006 as much as 85% of Chinese exports were FDI driven.)<br />This dangerous symbiotic and unbalanced relationship between the U.S. and China may fail in 2009-2010.</p>
<p>Right now, the demand for T-bills is enormous, driving the interest of T-bills almost to zero. Watching their life savings disappear into the present financial cesspool, many have simply tried to protect the remaining principal by purchasing T-bills. They want to protect what is left before it too disappears, a slight improvement on the old-fashion mattress approach. (Some opt for gold. Better put that in the mattress, too.)</p>
<p>As the recession deepens dangerously, China may well be thinking twice before it continues old habits. A <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/08/business/worldbusiness/08yuan.html?bl&#038;ex=1231563600&#038;en=45ee9cc416dcd0bd&#038;ei=5087%0A" target="_blank">recent</a> New York Times article outlines why old may be changing.</p>
<blockquote><p>In the last five years, China has spent as much as one-seventh of its entire economic output buying foreign debt, mostly American. In September, it surpassed Japan as the largest overseas holder of Treasuries</p></blockquote>
<p>Instead of buying American debt, China is now diverting its huge reserves to its own stimulus package.</p>
<blockquote><p>But now Beijing is seeking to pay for its own $600 billion stimulus — just as tax revenue is falling sharply as the Chinese economy slows. Regulators have ordered banks to lend more money to small and medium-size enterprises, many of which are struggling with lower exports, and to lend to local governments to build new roads and other projects</p></blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, as its export machine falters bringing in fewer reserves, China will have less to invest in U.S. bonds.</p>
<p>There is, of course, a dangerous feedback mechanism here: China will be in a weaker position to protect its peg against the dollar, which in turn will weaken its already weakening export machine.</p>
<p>And what about multinationals in China? Well, FDI in China is shrinking.</p>
<blockquote><p>Multinationals are hoarding their cash and cutting back on construction of new factories.</p></blockquote>
<p>China may have to depend on its own, rather weak, consumer base. All of this may seem like good news to some. After all, maybe those multinationals will come home. I doubt it, certainly not for a good while. Furthermore, like the banks and you and me, they are trying to protect their own principal. Everyone is seeking safety. All these stimulus packages may be coming too late and be far too little. Conversely, if the correct policies had been in place, no such stimulus package would ever have been needed.</p>
<p>The current situation certainly has all the earmarks of a serious Depression. Increasing aggregate demand is becoming a global problem.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the U.S.-China trade imbalance is now coming back to haunt China. As I pointed out, its consumer base is far too weak to support the appetite for the kinds of exports it sent to the U.S. and elsewhere.</p>
<p>And what will the U.S. do if its favorite creditor is forced to look inward? Just how will it finance its mammoth, ever-growing U.S. debt? It won&#8217;t. Its only recourse will be to print money, more money, and more money. We know where that path leads.</p>
<p>When China and Japan keep their money at home to rescue and to stimulate their own economies instead of financing our debt, expect our interest rates to rise&#8211;and there will be few buyers.</p>
<p>The failure of the &#8220;you-buy-our-goods we-buy-your debt&#8221; may well be coming to a close.</p>

<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_hcwm-NIIKbE/SXIqah5t5cI/AAAAAAAAAD4/LIO9FN01zj8/s1600-h/17nocera_600.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_hcwm-NIIKbE/SXIqah5t5cI/AAAAAAAAAD4/LIO9FN01zj8/s400/17nocera_600.jpg" border="0"></a></p>
<p>So, our new national bank is to be a repository for all the bad debt. </p>
<p>That&#8217;s not my idea of a national bank. Let&#8217;s have a national bank that competes with private banks. It would issue 5% credit cards; have no stake holders but we citizens. It would renegotiate or issue mortgages for one-house owners only. It would open branch offices everywhere&#8211;using existing Federal Buildings. Administrative staff at branch offices would be guided by, not ruled by, local business and labor leaders, as well as local&#8211;not state&#8211;politicos.</p>
<p>Its purpose would be to break even. Capitalize it with the next trillion, please.</p>

<p>The typical reaction and/or discussion about the decline in manufacturing employment over the years indicates to me that there is a lot of confusion about what it means.</p>
<p>Most comments seem to imply that falling manufacturing employment means that industrial/manufacturing output is falling in importance in the economy.  But if you compare the index of industrial output published by the Fed to the BEA data on real GDP you see that industrial output has kept pace with real GDP over the decades and has not fallen in importance<br />even though industrial employment has fallen as a share of total employment and in absolute numbers in recent years.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SXIVbJelcCI/AAAAAAAAAno/ORfgIOEOcN4/s1600-h/Clipboard01.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SXIVbJelcCI/AAAAAAAAAno/ORfgIOEOcN4/s320/Clipboard01.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a>But there is a problem with this comparison.  The index of industrial production is an index of<br />physical output &#8212; tons of steel, kilowatts of electricity, number of light vehicles, etc. &#8212; while<br />real GDP is a measure of the value of output.  So in a way comparing industrial production and real GDP is like comparing apples and oranges.  It can be done, but you have to be careful to do it right.</p>
<p>So the Federal Reserve Board does calculate and publish the value of production in real dollar terms and if you compare the value of industrial production to the same measure of the value of real GDP you do see that real GDP has grown faster than industrial production.  But the comparisons are 3% for real GDP and 2.4% for production, a significant difference but not as bad as many people seem to believe.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SXIVjN-rqeI/AAAAAAAAAnw/rmU7x-PZ0XY/s1600-h/Clipboard02.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SXIVjN-rqeI/AAAAAAAAAnw/rmU7x-PZ0XY/s320/Clipboard02.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a>But for many people living and analyzing developments in the rust belt this moderate difference does not seem to conform to their experiences.  Everything they see tells them that the differences are much greater than this.  And they are right.  If you look within the industrial production numbers you see that the 3% growth trend shown in the first charts stems from two<br />very different trends.  One is the growth of high technology products like computers and other office equipment, communication equipment and semiconductors.  Over the last quarter century production of these high technology products has averaged about a 21% growth rate while all other industrial output only experienced a 1.1% growth rate.  This growth is more consistent with the general feeling that traditional rust belt production has been stagnate and with positive productivity this  generated falling rust belt manufacturing employment.</p>
