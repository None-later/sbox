                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Twice now in this political session we have had the opportunity to move beyond the Carl Rove/Frank Luntz school and system of communication.  The first was Sen. Obama&#8217;s speech on race.  The second is this current statement discussed in <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/04/bitter-comment-hillary-adopts-rovian.html">PGL&#8217;s post</a>.</p>
<p>I understand the current structure of our MSM and their strategy to earning viewers and thus money; stir the crap.  Even Olberman had one guest ask if the public was smart enough to understand Sen Obama&#8217;s speech on race as oppose to running after the handoff of the baton of: <em>Or, at this moment, in this election, we can come together and say, &#8220;Not this time.&#8221; This time we want to talk&#8230;</em></p>
<p>That was it.  The biggest opportunity to step out from the focus on the word or words and into the focus on the message the person speaking was attempting to relay.  Less emphysis on one&#8217;s interpretation of the words used and more focus on the interpretation used by the one you are communicating with for the sole purpose and desire to fully commune.  </p>
<p>This current statement by Obama is now the second opportunity for the US to step away with no penalty of loss of honor from the inward focus on the word/words into the outward focus on the message.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not really expecting the MSM to make the change.  Would be nice, but it will not happen until our elected ones make the change.  That Sen. Clinton did not and has not recognized these two opportunities and run with them is evidence of the lie of her political prowess.  She has failed to sense that the common thread in all of the “change” dialog regarding political change evolving into policy change is the cessation of the focusing on the word/words for the sake of winning the argument.  Such a focus is a selfish life approach.  </p>
<p>Our loss of respect in the world, our feelings of distrust, our decline of a sense of comfort, even the bank issue, the war, all of it began with shift to an approach of dialog of word/words.  Our dialog has been dominated for 3 decades by a style of communication that manifests out of selfishness.  It is the “lazy” in the presentation of the fat American, the me generation, the welfare queen, the illegal immigrant.  </p>
<p>It&#8217;s easier to focus on the word.  Every word has an emotional response and every emotional response has a physical response.  It is physiology.  Thus it is simple to generate a belief in one&#8217;s self that you are what I say you are and to feel good and confident in your righteousness.   It is the style of dialog one becomes engaged in when holding a conversation with another who is drunk or stoned, or high or manic, or schizophrenic or panicked or shocked.  It is the irony of the framing of Bush as being capable of relating because you could sit and have a beer with him.  You can.  You just won&#8217;t be able to communicate to any point of resolution.  With no ability to truly comprehend the message of the one you&#8217;re talking to, you have no ability to trust that person.  Consequently you have no ability to commune with that person.  In terms of economics, no ability to trade.</p>
<p>Sen. Clinton has shown twice now that she either: 1. does not understand this most basic of lessons of communication or 2. does understand, but for selfish intent will use it against those she professes a desire to serve or 3.  does understand, but has little faith or trust in those she professes a desire to serve.</p>
<p>With that, how would you advice Sen. Clinton to respond to Sen. Obama&#8217;s statements knowing that he put the following out there: <em>Or, at this moment, in this election, we can come together and say, &#8220;Not this time.&#8221; This time we want to talk&#8230;</em><br />END</p>

                                <p>I voted for Senator Clinton during the primaries and I think she would make a good President.  But I also think Senator Obama would also make a good President and this whole debate over this “bitter” comment and how Team Clinton has put over the edge.  While I have resisted the bandwagon calling for Clinton drop out, I think what she and her chief strategist Geoffrey Garin have been saying borders on Swift Boat dishonesty. First the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mayhill-fowler/obama-no-surprise-that-ha_b_96188.html">comment in question</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>But the truth is, is that, our challenge is to get people persuaded that we can make progress when there&#8217;s not evidence of that in their daily lives. You go into some of these small towns in Pennsylvania, and like a lot of small towns in the Midwest, the jobs have been gone now for 25 years and nothing&#8217;s replaced them. And they fell through the Clinton administration, and the Bush administration, and each successive administration has said that somehow these communities are gonna regenerate and they have not. So it&#8217;s not surprising then that they get bitter, they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who aren&#8217;t like them or anti-immigrant sentiment or anti-trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations.</p></blockquote>
<p>Reading this paragraph in the context of the entire discussion, you can see why <a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/188674.php">Josh Marshall</a> posted Obama’s November 2004 interview with Charlie Rose.  Senator Clinton takes the bitter comment out of context and falsely claims it shows that Senator Obama is elitist and out of touch.  But what Obama was saying was just the opposite of elitism and being out of touch.  <a href="http://tpmelectioncentral.talkingpointsmemo.com/2008/04/obama_responds_to_criticism_of.php">Greg Sargent</a> catches Obama making this very point. <a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/188673.php">Josh</a> also features the Clintons expressing similar sentiments.  </p>
<p><a href="http://tpmelectioncentral.talkingpointsmemo.com/2008/04/hillary_chief_strategist_geoff.php">Greg</a> on Mr. Garin:</p>
<blockquote><p>Hillary chief strategist Geoffrey Garin dramatically raised the stakes in the battle over Barack Obama&#8217;s comments  about small-town America, saying in an interview that they would be &#8220;damaging&#8221; to him in a general election, could set back the Democratic Party&#8217;s efforts to reach heartland voters, and should be something that super-delegates consider when deciding whom to support. &#8220;These are the kinds of attitudes that have created a gulf between Democrats and lots of small-town and heartland voters that we&#8217;ve been working very, very hard to bridge,&#8221; Garin told me today in his first public comments about the flap. &#8220;I saw Senator Obama&#8217;s comments as a step backward to building those kinds of bridges,&#8221; Garin continued, saying the following of the impact that the comments could have in a general election: &#8220;They will be damaging. And they could be significantly so&#8230;I don&#8217;t think that the kinds of attitudes that Senator Obama expressed are consistent with Democrats doing what we need to do to win a general election.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>If Garin’s approach to securing the nomination of our party for his client is to lie to us in the same way Rove and his minions did, let me suggest that he leave our party.  Of course, it would help if our press reported the truth and demonstrated how dishonest Mr. Garin and Senator Clinton are being on this particular faux controversy.  But since the press appears to be so incompetent again – let’s applaud the folks over at TalkingPointsMemo for covering this.</p>
<p>Update: <a href="http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2008/04/will-clinton-ov.html">Andrew Sullivan</a> beat me to my point:</p>
<blockquote><p>The &#8220;bitter&#8221; spat is gold for Morris-Rove politics, which is why Clinton is exploiting it so baldly. It is exactly the kind of debate that has constructed American politics since Vietnam; it is exactly the kind of politics that Obama has been trying to transcend. Clinton will use anything at this point to destroy Obama&#8217;s candidacy and message; but by adopting Rovism at its reddest, the Clintons do risk looking too obvious.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>The President&#8217;s plan will accelerate this trend to record rates by retiring an historic $2 trillion in debt over the next 10 years. Under the President&#8217;s budget, the national debt will be only seven percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2011, its lowest share in more than 80 years.</p></blockquote>
<p>2002.  From a <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2002/06/20020607-5.html">White House Economic Fact sheet, June 7, 2002</a>:<br />
<blockquote>The War and Recession &#8212; Not the Tax Cuts &#8212; Drained the Budget Surplus</p></blockquote>
<p>2003.  <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2003/02/20030203-6.html">White House Fact Sheet, Feb 3, 2003</a><br />
<blockquote>The budget would be in double digit deficit if had there never been a tax cut in 2001.</p></blockquote>
<p>2004.  <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2004/01/20040120-7.html">GW&#8217;s SOTU, Jan 20, 2004</a>:<br />
<blockquote>By doing so, we can cut the deficit in half over the next five years.</p></blockquote>
<p>2005.  <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2006/10/20061011-6.html">White House Fact Sheet, Oct 11, 2005</a><br />
<blockquote>Today, President Bush Announced That The Deficit Has Been Cut In Half 3 Years Ahead Of His 2009 Goal And That The FY2006 Budget Deficit Was $248 Billion.</p></blockquote>
<p>2006.  <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2006/10/20061011-7.html">GW Bush, Oct 11, 2006</a><br />
<blockquote>Tax relief fuels economic growth, and growth &#8212; when the economy grows, more tax revenues come to Washington. And that&#8217;s what&#8217;s happened. It makes sense, doesn&#8217;t it? As businesses expand people pay more taxes, and when you pay more taxes, there&#8217;s more revenues that come to our treasury.</p></blockquote>
<p>2007.  <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2007/07/20070719-2.html">White House Fact Sheet, July 19, 2007</a><br />
<blockquote>Following The Path Of President Bush&#8217;s FY 2008 Budget Would Lead To A Budget Surplus In 2012 Of $33 Billion. President Bush&#8217;s FY 2008 Budget lays out a detailed plan to balance the budget in the next five years while keeping taxes low. It keeps annual spending under control and addresses our long-term budgetary challenge &#8211; the unsustainable growth in entitlement programs like Medicare and Social Security.</p></blockquote>
<p>2008.  See 3.  </p>
<p>2009.  GW, in an interview with a Fox News anchor:<br />
<blockquote>Raising taxes is a very irresponsible move by the President. It&#8217;s going to raise the deficit.</p></blockquote>

                                <p> &#8230; President Bush reiterated yesterday that if Iran continues to help militias in Iraq, &#8220;then we&#8217;ll deal with them,&#8221; saying in an interview with ABC News that &#8220;we&#8217;re learning more about their habits and learning more about their routes&#8221; for infiltrating or sending equipment. </p>
<p> But he also reaffirmed that he has no desire to go to war with Tehran. Saying that his job is to &#8220;solve these issues diplomatically,&#8221; Bush suggested heightened interest in reaching a solution with other countries. &#8220;You can&#8217;t solve these problems unilaterally. You&#8217;re going to need a multilateral forum.&#8221; .</p>
<p>We use to have a great defense against the influence of Tehran in Iraq &#8212; it was Saddam. In the 1980s the Vice President actually helped to implement this policy that in retrospect seemed to have worked pretty well.</p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t this a great example of unintended consequences?</p>
<p>Or is it just another example of how Team Bush has done such a great job of increasing the influence of America&#8217;s enemies while reducing the influence of the US?<br /><em>End</em></p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>We are in real trouble. Easy credit from foreign central banks is reaching its limit. Easy credit inside the U.S. is already a fantasy. The dollar is in crisis. Debt is rapidly becoming the name of the game, at least for us. As the dollar falls, in real terms, prices and unemployment are rising. Wages in the U.S. are stagnant.</p>
<p>Weekly we hear of one extraordinary effort after another to rescue us from the quicksand into which we seem to be sinking. If it is not the Fed girding its loins for another loan, then it is the <a href="http://www.financialpost.com/story.html?id=439742">G-7</a> examining options ranging from tighter regulations to use of public funds. Everyone is worried. Will the dominoes fall?</p>
<blockquote><p>The G7 &#8212; the United States, Canada, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Japan &#8212; stopped short of declaring that the U.S. economy was heading for a recession and steered clear of recommending the use of public funds to bail out troubled markets, an idea widely discussed before the meeting</p></blockquote>
<p>Nouriel Roubini <a href="http://www.rgemonitor.com/blog/roubini/252460/">predicts</a> that the coming recession will be a U, not an easy recovery. Calculated Risk <a href="http://calculatedrisk.blogspot.com/2008/04/roubini-on-shape-of-recession.html">predicts</a> it will be a W, a double dip recession. Others see the traditional V.</p>
<p>I suggest we may be in for something worse. No letter the alphabet quite captures it. The only image that comes to mind is that of a slinky sliding down stairs, each deeper fall accompanied by a short rise.</p>
<p>What we have to ask ourselves is: <i>What is the engine that will pull us out?</i></p>
<p>The Fed cannot do it alone; neither can the G-7. They may be able to plug the leaks, but only real business activity can do the trick. Neither Nouriel nor Calculated Risk addresses this problem.</p>
<p>Aside from whatever the Fed can do, we have to look at some of the factors that may reverse our fall. First, we have to accept that much of our supposed wealth creation was in fact a mirage, built on sand&#8211;or rather corruption and greed. The Fed can break the fall; central banks <i>may</i> continue to support us, now conditionally, I suspect. Breaking or supporting is not enough. Reversal is important.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the wealth of a nation depends its trade. In looking for our engine of growth, we have to look at elements that may help us. Unfortunately, our trade deficit, despite oil imports slowing, continues to increase.</p>
<p>Will falling oil prices pull us out? How far down must they go?</p>
<p>Sadly, the price of oil shows no sign of falling.</p>
<p>While January 2008 production has edged out the old high of May 2005, global demand is still strong. In terms of production, we seem to be on a bumpy plateau. If global growth is to continue, then production must steadily increase. To date, no producer has stepped forward to assure us that we will once again see oil at $40/barrel&#8230;or even $60. Other energy sources may be in the pipeline; but none will arrive soon enough to drive the price of energy low enough to pull us out of a recession.</p>
<p>What about a rising yuan? Will that make us more competitive?</p>
<p>We have frequently complained that the pegged yuan puts our companies at a disadvantage.</p>
<p>In four years the yuan has gone from 8.7 in 2004 to 7.006 in 2008: An appreciation of 15%. Allowing the yuan to float more freely has eased inflation in China. At the same time, China has raised interest rates; still, FDI has increased. But, because China has become so dependent upon its export machine, 58% of which is from foreign nationals in the China, both the rising yuan and rising interest rates are hurting exporters, who already are beginning to look elsewhere. As the Los Angeles Times notes in its lead line concerning <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-currency9apr09,1,7368867.story">China</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Profits are down for firms that pay for labor and raw materials in yuan but sell their products for dollars. Some companies are moving a few operations to Vietnam</p></blockquote>
<p>The article continues:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the past, foreign firms could cover increasing costs by squeezing their Chinese suppliers. But with the rise in the yuan and other costs, Sakkis says, that&#8217;s tough to do today. &#8220;The rules of the game have changed.&#8221; </p>
<p>The American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai said 17% of companies surveyed recently planned to move some operations out of China. The study, by the consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton, cited the appreciation of the yuan as a primary factor.<br />Recent reports indicate that thousands of factories in southeast Guangdong province, many of them working for U.S. businesses, have closed or moved elsewhere. Meanwhile, some Chinese businesses are refusing payments in dollars; others are breaking contracts saying they can&#8217;t meet the terms because of the high yuan.<br />…<br />Vietnam has Asia&#8217;s second-fastest-growing economy after China, with a large supply of cheap labor and favorable government policies reminiscent of China&#8217;s earlier days.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If Walmart&#8217;s suppliers stay in China this means higher prices for us. On the other hand, if Vietnam—or Colombia—becomes an option—then prices may stabilize, but the trade deficit will not fall significantly. It may shift to other undeveloped countries.</p>
<p>We have to ask: <i>What is it that we can trade?</i> In order to compete globally, we must have something to offer the rest of the world, something to trade.</p>
<p>The latest surge in the trade deficit was a result of computers, pharmaceuticals, and foreign cars. Slowly but surely we have less and less to trade in terms of finished goods. Agriculture is not enough.</p>
<p>Can we look to some dimension of our service sector for help?</p>
<p>In 2004, the <a href="http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2004/wp04186.pdf">IMF</a> argued that the U.S. indeed had something to trade: Financial and business services—American know-how. In that argument, the IMF acknowledged that there were problems in the U.S. labor market:<br />
<blockquote>The McKinsey report indicated that more than 69 percent of workers who lost jobs due to imports in the United States between 1979 and 1999 were re-employed (this is based on U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data). Of course, this means that 31 per cent were not re-employed, highlighting that there may be some rigidities in the labor market.</p></blockquote>
<p>However, the IMF maintained that, as of 2004, the U.S. was the recipient of substantial global outsourcing in terms of services. In short, from one point of view, the U.S. had a substantial trade balance in terms of some kinds of services. These more than compensated for the fall in material goods. The IMF define these services as<br />
<blockquote>To set the record straight, we look at the trade data in two categories of services that have been most intensely reported: computer and information services and other business services. In value terms, other business services (which we will refer to as just business services) are by far the larger of the two categories.</p></blockquote>
<p>In terms of “business services,” the IMF said that the U.S. was the largest exporter. Or, to put the matter another way, the U.S., was the biggest insourcer or recipient of global outsourcing. In short, the U.S. had become a successful service society, especially in the area of business and financial acumen, despite its increasing material trade deficit.</p>
<p>As one <a href="http://www.nber.org/~wei/data/rajan%26wei2004/rajan%26wei2004.pdf">writer</a> in the National Bureau of Economic Research so aptly wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>First, consider the amount of &#8216;insourcing&#8217;, that is, the value of business services exported by a country like the US. Clearly, this is considerable &#8211; think of all the high-priced business consultants and lawyers in rich countries offering their services to the rest of the world.</p></blockquote>
<p>Without being too ironic, I think we can safely assert that many of “business consultants” have been a bit too innovative of late. All of them—Bear Stearns, Merrill Lynch, CitiGroup, et al—were our great money makers: What we had to trade. It made some people very rich; those in the middle and at the bottom it left behind. But, as I said earlier, much of that wealth creation was a mirage, built on quicksand. Easy come; easy go.</p>
<p>We may fix that particular engine. First, we will rescue it (bail it out); then we must properly regulate and oversee it. But even if that service industry functions properly, it will never again be that marvelous wealth creator we thought it to be. Its accoutrements will be a bit more modest.</p>
<p>Which leaves us with again with the real question: Where or what is the engine that will pull us out of recession and once again into the light? This time, will we design and build an engine that profits all of us?</p>
<p>Frankly, I think we are going to be asking that question for quite a while. Meanwhile, prepare to watch the slinky purr its way to the bottom step.<br />END</p>

                                <p>Robert Stein has been kind enough to clarify a lot of points about his tax plan, so I&#8217;d like, if I may, to offer conservatives my thoughts on a tax plan.  Not a tax plan, but things I feel they should keep in mind about taxes if their goal is to come up with a plan that will a) have the support of folks in the center and the center-left and b) be &#8220;pro-growth&#8221; in deed as well as in word.</p>
<p>1.  Do not make assumptions about the percentage of people&#8217;s income that will go toward taxes based on figures from the IRS Statistics of Income.  The IRS Statistics of Income gives us reported taxable income, which has a much greater tendency to overstate the percentage of income paid in taxes by high income earners than it does for low income income earners.  A couple reasons come to mind quickly&#8230;</p>
<p>1a.  It is not going to include tax free income, such as tax free municipal bonds.  These are generally not a part of the income stream of the working class.</p>
<p>1b.  Its usually awfully hard to, shall we say, push the envelope when all of your income comes from one employer and is reported on a W-2.  On the other hand, if your income comes from multiple sources, and it depends in large part on how big your costs are, things are a little different.  Robert Stein used to work at the Treasury.  I had a stint at a then Big 6, now Big 4 Accounting firm.  The reason high net worth individuals pay enormous fees to the Big X is not because their returns are complex &#8211; its to ensure their returns are complex.  That way, when there&#8217;s a dispute, and the folks at the Big X are one side of the table, and the outgunned folks from the Treasury (whose goal is to one day be on the other side of the table, making more money &#8211; talk about Capture Theory!) meet, there&#8217;s no question what the outcome will be.  Costs are inflated using every loophole, and revenues are deflated the same way.   And the incentive of folks who make enough money to go through PWC or E&#038;Y or Deloitte or KPMG is not going to go away just because tax rates fall, unless those rates fall close to zero.  And its not going to go away if the tax code is simplified.</p>
<p>2.  Here&#8217;s a table I made for another post a few months back based on data from <a href="http://www.irs.gov/taxstats/article/0,,id=175814,00.html">IRS SOI Bulletin Historical Table 8</a>.  It shows the income taxes paid (as per the IRS SOI) as a percentage of the personal income (from the BEA&#8217;s NIPA tables), not as a percentage of the personal income declared to the IRS.  </p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/R4bdaNumL5I/AAAAAAAAA8s/sHO2qVyJLr8/s1600-h/dynamic+scoring+-+taxes+as+a+percent+of+personal+income+graph.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/R4bdaNumL5I/AAAAAAAAA8s/sHO2qVyJLr8/s320/dynamic+scoring+-+taxes+as+a+percent+of+personal+income+graph.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think its excessively cynical that the conclusion to be reached from this is that tax collections are less a function of marginal tax rates than they are of something else.  Here&#8217;s why &#8211; tax rates dropped dramatically while LBJ was President, and yet tax collections as a share of income went up.  Conversely, as Republicans will never forget, GHW Bush raised tax rates&#8230; and still reduced the percentage of people&#8217;s income collected in taxes.</p>
<p>For lack of a better term, let&#8217;s call that something other than marginal tax rates that affects tax collections &#8220;enforcement.&#8221;  Its a simple matter &#8211; if the folks appointed to run the Treasury and the IRS are very much against the concept of taxation, tax collections as a percentage of income will diminish.  Its no surprise or accident that the red bars are all one side of horizontal axis and the blue bars are all on the other.</p>
<p>3.  I realize its fashionable to claim that one is &#8220;pro-growth&#8221; if one is in favor of lower taxes.  I&#8217;m not sure if Robert Stein has used that term, but its certainly a term in vogue.  The problem is this &#8211; another graph I used before&#8230;</p>
<p>I pulled some data from the BEA&#8217;s <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/SelectTable.asp?Selected=N#S7">NIPA table 7.1</a>.  For each president, its calculated from the last year before the President took office to the last full year the President served.  (Since JFK was killed and Nixon quit more than half-way through the year, I assumed JFK&#8217;s &#8220;last full year&#8221; was 1963 and Nixon&#8217;s was 1974.)  </p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/R4bdfdumL6I/AAAAAAAAA80/yYHmZlEFR2A/s1600-h/dynamic+scoring+-+real+GDP+per+capita+graph.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/R4bdfdumL6I/AAAAAAAAA80/yYHmZlEFR2A/s320/dynamic+scoring+-+real+GDP+per+capita+graph.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Its hard to construct a story that includes both this graph and the previous one and that still puts the &#8220;pro-growth&#8221; label on lower tax collections*.  I am not saying that higher tax rates produce faster growth &#8211; I am saying that there is an optimal rate of taxation when it comes to growth.  Think of it as a Laffer curve, but with real GDP per capita growth rather than tax collections on the y-axis.  At the rates of actual tax collections we&#8217;ve observed since 1952, not theoretical marginal collections but actual ones, taxes are now well below the level we need to maintain growth.  Taxes pay for infrastructure we need to maintain a smoothly running economy, things like roads and bridges.</p>
<p>* Any such story usually involves the Kennedy tax cuts.  To cut that off at the pass, let me point out here and now, for the umpteenth time, the Kennedy tax cuts came in 1964.  Kennedy was already dead.  Its one thing to credit them with some of the growth during the LBJ years, another to credit them with growth during the Kennedy years.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>Correction.  Modified the sentence referring to GHW Bush and taxes.  Originally it referred erroneously to GW, and was somewhat nonsensical.  Apologies for the screw-up.</p>

                                <p>Seems it&#8217;s not just the executive branch and their friends that have “invested” in this war.  From <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter_Press_Service">IPS</a> comes a <a href="http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=41893">news article </a>about the money invested by our legislators.  <br />
<blockquote>Members of Congress invested nearly 196 million dollars of their own money in companies that receive hundreds of millions of dollars a day from Pentagon contracts to provide goods and services to U.S. armed forces, say nonpartisan watchdog groups. </p></blockquote>
<p>The article is based on a report by the Center for Responsive Politics, via their site: Opensecretes.org </p>
<p>Before we get to the meat of this, consider that I found this via Common Dreams.org&#8217; copying the news article.  The article is not a US based media article.  Oh nooooooooo!   It is a nonprofit, global news organization out of Rome publishing an article on a report by a US based watch dog group.  THANK GOD FOR THE INTERNET!<br />Ok, I feel better.  Don&#8217;t you?</p>
<p>The original article, <a href="http://www.capitaleye.org/inside.asp?ID=342">Strategic Assets</a> has a wonderful chart.  Of the top 10 legislators invested in our military industrial complex, can you guess who has the most tied up?  A hint: Of the top 10, 3 are democrats and they don&#8217;t  include Nancy or Diane.</p>
<blockquote><p>According to the most recent reports of their personal finances, 151 current members of Congress had between $78.7 million and $195.5 million invested in companies that received defense contracts of at least $5 million in 2006.  In all, these companies received more than $275.6 billion from the government in 2006, or $755 million per day, according to FedSpending.org, a website of the budget watchdog group OMB Watch.</p>
<p>In 2004, the first full year after the Iraq war began, Republican and Democratic lawmakers—both hawks and doves—had between $74.9 million and $161.3 million invested in companies under contract with the Department of Defense.</p></blockquote>
<p>Our esteemed colleagues have seem to have no concern about the image such investing may present:<br />
<blockquote>The minimum value of Congress members&#8217; personal investments in these contractors increased 5 percent from 2004 to 2006,&#8230; </p></blockquote>
<p>Granted, some of the companies counted may seem unlikely candidates for being considered defense until you read:<br />
<blockquote>As the military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan have expanded and transformed, so, too, has the need for goods and services that extend beyond helicopters, armored vehicles and guns. Giant corporations outside of the defense sector, such as Pepsico, IBM, Microsoft and Johnson &#038; Johnson, have received defense contracts and are all popular investments for both members of Congress and the general public. So common are these companies, both as personal investments and as defense contractors, it would appear difficult to build a diverse blue-chip stock portfolio without at least some of them.</p></blockquote>
<p>So, what&#8217;s a person to do with their 401K money if they want to be in the good, secure companies but does not want to promote war profiteering?  As noted in the article, even without war, the solder needs tooth paste.  But we are exercising our military currently and we&#8217;re using it up, which means replacement costs are accelerated.  Though maybe tooth paste is used at no greater rate.  Though we did call in all those reserves.  Which might explain Pepsico getting $187 million in 2006 but it does not explain: <br />
<blockquote>In the case of Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-W.Va.), chair of the Senate Select Intelligence Committee, his stock in Pepsico, which is worth at least $1 million, is actually held by his wife, who is on the food and beverage corporation&#8217;s board of directors.</p></blockquote>
<p>Nor does it explain this:<br />
<blockquote>Petraeus will speak on April 8 and 9 to the Senate Foreign Relations and Armed Services committees. In 2006, members of these two committees had between $32 million and $44 million invested in companies with DOD contracts. Foreign Relations member Kerry&#8217;s investments accounted for most of it—between $28.9 million and $38.2 million. Members of the two committees held between $3 million and $5.1 million in defense-only companies.</p></blockquote>
<p>What is there to say?  Military spending of war does increase GDP for the good?  Privatization of the military goes far beyond mercenaries?  The USA is an economy of war making?  It&#8217;s just business?  I&#8217;m a fool for not riding the money wave?  </p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Yesterday I had a post titled:  <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/04/screw-poor-screw-them-screw-them-screw.html">&#8220;The Screw the Poor, Screw Them, Screw Them, Screw Them, I Hope Poor People Die Tax Reform Proposal&#8221;</a>.    It dealt with <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/04/screw-poor-screw-them-screw-them-screw.html">this article by Ramesh Ponnuru and Robert Stein</a> where they detail a tax proposal.  </p>
<p>I quoted them as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>The two of us are among the conservatives who have proposed a tax reform that permanently reduces tax rates on capital gains, dividends, and estates, cuts the top income-tax rate and the corporate-tax rate, and abolishes the alternative minimum tax on individuals.</p></blockquote>
<p>Robert Stein, in comments to that post, has provided a response.  The response, which is posted below the fold, leads to a very different conclusion than one would reach from my first look at it. </p>
<blockquote><p>The tax reform proposal that Ramesh Ponnuru and I have outlined would be substantially more progressive than the current tax code. It would also be substantially more progressive than the system under President Clinton. This is true whether one uses our framework to lower overall taxes or maintain revenue neutrality.</p>
<p>We would enhance progressivity in three ways:</p>
<p>First, we would provide a $4,000 tax credit per child that would be refundable versus both payroll taxes and income taxes.</p>
<p>Second, although we would reduce the top marginal income tax rate, we would let the new lower rate kick in at a lower level. As a result, people in upper income brackets would end up making much higher overall tax payments despite facing a lower top marginal rate.</p>
<p>Third, we would alter the mortgage interest deduction and charitable donation to make it available to more middle and lower income taxpayers (while less generous to the upscale) while getting rid of other itemized deductions that are predominantly used by upper income taxpayers.</p>
<p>On net, almost everyone now in the 15% bracket or below would pay less in taxes. For those now in the 25% bracket or above, their aggregate taxes would go up, although (in general) not when they have children ages 0-18, and their top marginal rate would decline.</p></blockquote>
<p>While this isn&#8217;t quite a guest post, I will treat it as such and post my response in comments.  <br />END</p>

                                <p>Veronique de Rugy has an article in Reason magazine about a topic I&#8217;ve been pissed off about for a long time:the fact that this administration is still funding the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq (plus other expenses) using <a href="http://www.reason.com/news/printer/125438.html">supplemental appropriations</a>, which are supposed to be reserved for emergencies and unexpected costs.  A war can qualify &#8211; such as the Gulf War &#8211; if it begins unexpectedly in the middle of the year.  But at this point, nobody can credibly claim that the administration is surprised every year, after the budget request is turned in, to find that the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq are still ongoing.  </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how its supposed to be done:</p>
<blockquote><p>In 1951, for instance, 72 percent of the kick-off cost for the Korean War —$33 billion in today’s dollars—went through supplemental appropriations, while $13 billion came from regular appropriations. But by year two, Congress appropriated 98 percent of the war’s funding through the regular defense budget. By 1953 the president no longer requested any funding outside of the regular defense budget.</p>
<p>The decade-long Vietnam War followed a similar pattern. In the first year of the war, Congress provided all of the funding in emergency supplemental bills. The second year, the administration requested a little less than 50 percent of the war funding within regular defense appropriations. By the fourth year, all of the war funding went through the regular defense budget process. This despite the fact that troop levels were in flux, military strategies were changing regularly, and the duration of the conflict could not be foreseen. In the 1990s, the Republican-led Congress showed a kind of discipline it would completely forget during the Bush presidency, directing President Bill Clinton in fiscal year 1996 to fund all ongoing military operations, including the enforcement of no-fly zones over Iraq, from the regular defense budget rather than supplementals. From then on, Clinton sought funding for Bosnia and other conflicts entirely through the regular appropriations process.</p>
<p>In the 1980s, throughout President Ronald Reagan’s military buildup, no Cold War spending was allocated through supplementals (see Figure 2). And once you account for the offsetting contributions from American allies during and after the first Gulf War ($35 billion out of the total $42 billion price tag), it is clear that until recently very little U.S. military spending was treated as an emergency.</p></blockquote>

<p>Here&#8217;s how GW does it:</p>
<blockquote><p>What a difference with today’s wars. Five years into the Iraq conflict and seven years into Afghanistan, the administration and Congress have buried all of the explicit funding—totaling more than the spending on either the Korea or Vietnam wars when adjusted for inflation—in emergency supplementals.</p>
<p>What changed? Aside from internal fiscal discipline, the single biggest procedural shift came in 2002, when the Congress let lapse a law that had required budget cuts to “offset” emergency expenditures.</p>
<p>Who benefited? The Pentagon, the political party that ran Washington in the early 2000s, and their friends.</p>
<p>“The Bush administration is clearly capable of projecting costs in Iraq,” says Travis Sharp, “and has simply ignored historical precedent.”</p>
<p>This year the Department of Defense once again failed to include the cost of war in its record-breaking $515 billion defense budget for fiscal year 2009. Instead, it included a placeholder for yet another $70 billion emergency war supplemental—which, conveniently for the administration, does not get counted in deficit projections.</p>
<p>Pressed by Democrats during the annual defense budget hearings in February, Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates confirmed that the $70 billion was only a small fraction of the total expected war cost for the year. Pressed further, Gates estimated that military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan would cost at least $170 billion in 2009.</p>
<p>He immediately added, “I have no confidence in that figure.”</p></blockquote>
<p>I should add&#8230;  the administration is nothing if not adaptable.  </p>
<p>I guess it beats <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/04/worst-possible-thing-fed-can-do.html">this alternative method of funding</a> which is getting trial-ballooned, or <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=iran+contra+scandal&#038;ie=utf-8&#038;oe=utf-8&#038;aq=t&#038;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&#038;client=firefox-a">this one</a>, despite the familiarity that some members of this administration might have with it.<br />END</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.organicconsumers.org/articles/article_2372.cfm">This article</a> describes the recent history of corn flour for tortillas in Mexico.  I looked it up after Stormy&#8217;s recent post on <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/04/wages-and-prices.html">Wages and prices</a>.  </p>
<blockquote><p>By 1996, Maseca had drawn the attention of Archer Daniels Midland, the world&#8217;s largest corn broker. Itself no stranger to government largesse, ADM spotted a good business model from across the border, and bought a 22 percent stake in GRUMA, Maseca&#8217;s parent company. Today, ADM&#8217;s formidable board chair G. Allen Andreas sits on GRUMA&#8217;s board of directors, as does the company&#8217;s CFO, Douglas J. Schmalz. </p>
<p>GRUMA now controls 70 percent of Mexico&#8217;s corn-flour market. As NAFTA opened the Mexican market to cheap, highly subsidized U.S. corn and dismantled Mexico&#8217;s support for its farmers, the price of corn in Mexico plunged, providing a windfall for GRUMA and despair for Mexican corn growers. Maseca now imports 30 percent of its corn for tortilla production from the United States, according to an Oxfam report [PDF]. </p>
<p>And as the price of corn fell, the Mexican government &#8212; citing free-market dogma &#8212; withdrew its ceiling on the tortilla price. According to Oxfam, between 1994 and 2001, the corn price in Mexico fell by 70 percent; meanwhile, between 1994 and 1999, the price consumers paid for their staple, tortillas, rose threefold &#8212; further burnishing GRUMA&#8217;s bottom line. And when rising tortilla prices pushed many consumers to switch to white bread, GRUMA cashed in as well. Another of its subsidiaries &#8212; a joint venture with Archer Daniels Midland called Molinera de Mexico &#8212; is the nation&#8217;s largest wheat-flour producer, and GRUMA owns a fast-growing bread business as well. </p>
<p>GRUMA has also moved aggressively north into the U.S. tortilla market, and south into Central America. It is by far the world&#8217;s largest corn-flour and tortilla producer. </p>
<p>Thanks to his patrons in the Mexican political elite, GRUMA&#8217;s chief executive, Roberto González Barrera, now stands atop a global tortilla empire with annual sales of $2.4 billion. (Amazingly, he also controls a major Mexican bank, Banorte, which Carlos Salinas delivered to him amid perhaps the most disastrous bank-privatization scheme in history.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Good links are in the original.  Was this good or bad for the teachers mentioned in the Wages and Price demonstration?<br />END</p>
