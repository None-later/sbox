                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Since <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=OTk0YzMzYzI3YWFkYmE5MzdhN2I5ODIxZjY0MWQ2MTk=">Ashby M. Foote</a> uses the following sentence:<br />
<blockquote>The BLS makes adjustments and population-control revisions to each of the surveys in order to facilitate apples-to-apples comparisons.</p></blockquote>
<p>Might we expect him to know what “population-control revisions” really means.  The theme of the latest nonsense from the National Review is captured by:<br />
<blockquote>But a persistent and widening gap that has now reached 3.3 million (7.9 million versus 4.6 million) and represents 42 percent of jobs created during this recovery surely deserves exploration for any underappreciated cause and effect … Clearly, the job survey data describes a more entrepreneurial-oriented economy, with small businesses and the self-employed accounting for an increasing proportion of overall economic activity and job creation. The household survey deserves more attention. For the time being, it’s where the action is.</p></blockquote>
<p>Payroll employment as of August 2006 was up by only 2.949 million as compared to February 2001.  Foote wants us to forget that the decline from February 2001 to November 2001 where payroll employment fell by 1.668 million.  </p>
<p>As far as the household survey, the employment to population ratio stands at 63.1% as compared to 64.3% as of February 2001 and 63.0% as of November 2001.  So even using Foote’s cherry picked time frame, household employment has barely risen as fast as population &#8211; which is not much of a recovery.  So how does Foote get such a large increase in the reported number (actually, the reported increase appears to be a bit larger)?  Ah, that infamous footnote that most NRO writers never read and Foote does not understand:<br />
<blockquote>Data affected by changes in population controls in January 2000, January 2003, January 2004, January 2005, and January 2006.</p></blockquote>
<p>Consider the fact that reported employment was 136.4 million in December 2002 but appeared to jump to 137.4 million in January 2003.  Did the employment to population ratio jump accordingly?  Let’s see, it was 62.4% in December 2002 and 62.5% the next month.  So very little of this increase can be attributed to anything other than some fluke coming from “changes in population controls”.  Foote tries to argue that these changes are designed “to facilitate apples-to-apples comparisons”, which is an incredibly absurd statement to make. </p>
<p>Foote puts forth another National Review canard – the premise that we’ve seen massive increases in self-employed entrepreneurs.  The Bureau of Labor Statistics tries to capture how many people are self-employed and as we can seen in <a href="http://www.bls.gov/cps/wlf-table36-2005.pdf">this table</a>, the number of unincorporated self-employed for 2001 was about 9.12 million, while this number for 2004 was about 9.47 million.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.epinet.org/content.cfm/briefingpapers_bp148">Elise Gould </a> addressed the issue that Mr. Foote fails to grasp back on December 12, 2003 in <em>Measuring employment since the recovery: A comparison of the household and payroll surveys</em>:<br />
<blockquote>The payroll survey provides a more accurate picture of employment trends in the U.S. economy. In addition to being significantly larger (with a sample size 600 times greater than that of the household survey), it is also benchmarked annually to unemployment insurance tax records and less likely to be subject to large revisions or misreporting. According to the payroll survey, employment has fallen by 726,000 jobs since the end of the recession in November 2001 and employment has fallen by 2.4 million since the start of the recession in March 2001. In contrast, the household survey indicates that employment has risen by 2.0 million since the recovery began and by 600,000 since the start of the recession. Adjustments for differences between the two surveys (e.g., to account for self-employment or multiple job holding) do not affect the difference in the trends of the two surveys since 2001. Nonpartisan government experts agree that the payroll survey employment numbers are more reliable than those from the household survey, despite Secretary of Labor Elaine Chao&#8217;s erroneous claim that experts do not know which survey is better &#8230; some analysts continue to mistakenly use the household survey to measure employment.2 Others incorrectly report trends in the household survey, while ignoring the discontinuity in the series that results from the January 2003 population adjustment. The payroll survey&#8217;s more precise measure of employment trends provide a clear advantage to the more volatile and less accurate household survey numbers &#8230; A second critique of the payroll survey is that it leaves out self-employment. However, because the household survey employment reports do not distinguish between the self-employed who are gainfully employed and those who are searching for work &#8211; and because the numbers of self-employed nonearners would be expected to increase during tough economic times &#8211; the omission of self-employment numbers from the payroll survey may more accurately reflect overall employment trends.</p></blockquote>
<p>Interesting – some of the increase in self-employment may be due to workers taking less desirable lines of pursuit.  But as the Bureau of Labor Statistics numbers indicate, this particular difference between the two series is only a very tiny part of the divergence between the two series.  All is this should be well known by now – and yet we continue to see the same idiocy on the pages of the National Review.</p>

                                <p>President Bush’s excuse for attacking Iraq (where Osama bin Laden was not) goes something like this.  Why play defense when one can run a good offense?  Of course, Bush’s offense reminds me of <a href="http://www.sptimes.com/News/92699/Sports/_Wrong_Way__Riegels_t.shtml">Wrong Way Riegels</a>.  It’s sort of like running over the cheerleaders on the sidelines because one is too afraid of the linebackers in front of you.</p>
<p>But check out <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2006/09/14/barnes-osama">Faiz</a> who brings us Fred Barnes on Fox News:<br />
<blockquote>HOST: Alright Fred, you and a few other journalists were in the Oval Office with the President, right? And he says catching Osama bin Laden is not job number one?<br />BARNES: Well, he said, look, you can send 100,000 special forces, that’s the figure he used, to the mountains of Pakistan and Afghanistan and hunt him down, but he just said that’s not a top priority use of American resources. His vision of a war on terror is one that involves intelligence to find out from people, to get tips, to follow them up and break up plots to kill Americans before they occur. That’s what happened recently in that case of the planes that were to be blown up by terrorists, we think coming from England, and that’s the top priority. He says, you know, getting Osama bin Laden is a low priority compared to that.</p></blockquote>
<p>That sounds like a defensive strategy to me.  In other words, President Bush is afraid to play offense when he comes to Osama bin Laden.<br /><strong><br />Update</strong>: In his <em>Weekly Standard</em> column, <a href="http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/012/696wnfcp.asp?pg=2">Fred Barnes</a> has a lot more to say including:<br />
<blockquote>Bush said the price of gasoline, which has been falling rapidly, is one of the &#8220;interesting indicators&#8221; that the press should watch carefully. &#8220;Just giving you a heads up,&#8221; he added.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/linkset/2005/04/11/LI2005041100879.html">Dan Froomkin</a> wonders:<br />
<blockquote>Does Bush have some insider information about gas prices, which appear to be conveniently dropping just in time for the mid-term election?</p></blockquote>
<p>I have to wonder if the Iranians are pumping more oil so as to keep the incompetents fully in control for another two years (hat tip to AB reader wfeather who is in no way responsible for my speculation here).</p>

                                <p>There were a couple of items in the latest Fuzzcharts from <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=NTcxNTUyMDcxNGVkOGFjMzc0MGNiYWM4NTFlNzAxYjY=">Jerry Bowyer</a> that struck me as odd.  The first was a reference to a discussion in the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/28/business/28wages.html?ex=1158206400&#038;en=ca14e730e33969b4&#038;ei=5070">New York Times</a>.   Bowyer writes:<br />
<blockquote>the Times complained that the American economy, which used to allot 50 percent of its output to wages, now only allots 45 percent. My quick rebuttal to this complaint is that it’s not that people are making less money, it’s that the economy is growing faster than their paychecks.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here is what Bowyer refers to:<br />
<blockquote>As a result, wages and salaries now make up the lowest share of the nation’s gross domestic product since the government began recording the data in 1947, while corporate profits have climbed to their highest share since the 1960’s &#8230; Together, these forces have caused a growing share of the economy to go to companies instead of workers’ paychecks. In the first quarter of 2006, wages and salaries represented 45 percent of gross domestic product, down from almost 50 percent in the first quarter of 2001 and a record 53.6 percent in the first quarter of 1970, according to the Commerce Department.</p></blockquote>
<p>It would appear that the New York Times did not include fringe benefits in their calculation but their chart does show overall compensation.  Real wages have fallen – despite Bowyer’s protestations about a growing overall economy.  But many economists would also have us look at the real value of fringe benefits.  But this was not Bowyer’s comeback:<br />
<blockquote>But what about the Times itself? How much of its revenue goes to wages? Answer: 38 percent, well below the national average. But it’s even worse than that &#8211; the Times number counts benefits while the national statistic does not. Is it fair to attack a mature company in a struggling industry for giving only about a third of its output to workers?</p></blockquote>
<p>I just looked at their 10-K filing for fiscal year ended December 31, 2005 and it shows $3373 million in revenue, so I presume wages and salaries are around $1282 million.  The operating profit was only $481 million so there must be $1610 million in other operating expenses.  Some of this might be attributable to worker’s fringe benefits but a lot of these other expenditures accrue to suppliers of newsprint, outside advertisers, and other suppliers of intermediate goods.  In other words, the output (that is, value-added) for the New York Times is nowhere close to $3373 million.  </p>
<p>Of course, such a simple concept such as the distinction between revenue and value-added is beyond the comprehension of Fuzzcharts.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>During 2005, we exported approximately $42 billion in goods to China but we also imported approximately $243 billion from China.  Many of the goods that we imported would be considered labor intensive products.  For example, we purchased $23 billion of clocks, $20 billion of toys, and $41 billion in apparel and related goods (3-digit SIC code 400) from China.  One might also be surprised that we purchased $42 billion of computer related products (3-digit SIC code 213) from China.  So what will we eventually export to China?  </p>
<p>One example of a good that requires both technology and capital intensive production is the automobile, so maybe the Chinese will purchase cars from Detroit.  Alas, we exported only $44 billion in motor vehicles during 2005 as we imported $146 billion in motor vehicles.  It seems that the Japanese automobile companies doing a better job of marketing their products even to U.S. consumers. </p>
<p>Irina Aervitz is a Ph.D. candidate in the political science department at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio who is currently writing her dissertation on state policies in the Chinese and Russian automotive sectors and the author of <a href="http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China_Business/HF06Cb02.html">this</a>: <br />
<blockquote>It is not news that the production capacity of China&#8217;s automotive industry is growing fast. The news is that its technological sophistication is speedily improving too. Until the recent past, most Chinese companies relied on their foreign joint-venture partners for technology. However, that situation is changing. Chinese companies are becoming more and more self-sufficient by purchasing technology from foreign companies without engaging in joint-venture arrangements. This trend can be attributed to the recent financial successes of Chinese auto enterprises that invested their resources in buying or developing technology. One of the examples is Beijing-based Beiqi Foton Motor Co Ltd, or Foton. Foton is a largely &#8220;self-made&#8221; company; its experience with joint ventures is very limited. A new state-owned enterprise, Foton was established in 1996. In 2004, its sales volume reached about 350,000 automobiles. In 1998, the firm was listed on the Shanghai stock exchange. Since 1999 Foton&#8217;s light duty truck has been ranked No 1 in sales among Chinese companies. In 2004, 341,000 vehicles were sold and brand value amounted to 10.6 billion yuan US$1,3 billion). Foton&#8217;s development speed and growth rate are astonishing. The company not only sells in China, but also exports &#8211; about 9,000 units in 2004. Foton exports to the Middle East, Eastern Europe, Southeast Asia and Africa. Light duty and medium-heavy duty trucks are popular in these areas of the world because of the affordable price. The key to success is the market niche that the company occupies &#8211; it produces trucks and buses.</p></blockquote>
<p>It seems that the policy of the Chinese government is to negotiate for the technology of companies such as DaimlerChrysler and Nissan:<br />
<blockquote>Namely, the authorities of the special economic zones (SEZs)and Beijing&#8217;s policy to encourage exports. SEZs are interested in attracting investors, so they negotiate with the central government on behalf of prospective investors and push the projects forward. DaimlerChrysler&#8217;s joint venture with Foton was not intended to be located in a SEZ. In fact, DaimlerChrysler was initially interested in using Foton production facilities as part of the joint-venture agreement rather than building a new factory. Furthermore, there are not many &#8220;single&#8221; large Chinese auto manufacturers left today in SEZs to have a joint venture with &#8211; most are already &#8220;taken&#8221;. For example, Dongfeng is married to Nissan (Nissan is part of the Renault group, the major competitor of Mercedes Benz in Europe), China National Heavy Duty Truck Group Co Ltd (CNHTC) is married to Volvo, etc. For DaimlerChrysler, irrespective of business-related factors, Foton was the only truck manufacturer left on the dance floor. Chinese companies have shifted their focus from relying on joint ventures with foreign partners as a source of technology to being more independent. Foton seeks cooperation with a variety of partners. The company purchases technology or consulting services; for example, an English consulting company, Lotus, is assisting Foton in fulfilling some R&#038;D projects. The lack of commitment from Foton towards a joint venture with DaimlerChrysler demonstrates a shift in technology appropriation strategy among Chinese auto enterprises. Foton wants technology, but does not want to share its profits with a foreign partner in a joint venture.</p></blockquote>
<p>Given China’s propensity to save, the nation is becoming less capital scarce.  So perhaps all China needs is our technology so they can produce the cars that their citizens will be driving in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: My use of the term SIC code was not quite right.  Besides I could have easily provided <a href="http://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/statistics/product/enduse/imports/c5700.html">this link</a> to <em>U.S. Imports from China from 2001 to 2005 By 5-digit End-Use Code</em>.</p>

                                <p>Back in February of 2001, the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/usbudget/blueprint/budtoc.html"> President’s economic blueprint </a>, which was subtitled “A Responsible Budget for America’s Priorities” assured us that:  “the President&#8217;s Budget pays down the debt so aggressively that it runs into an unusual problem—its annual surpluses begin to outstrip the amount of maturing debt starting in 2007. This means that the United States will be effectively unable to retire any more debt than what is assumed in the Administration&#8217;s Budget over the next 10 years—the President achieves &#8220;maximum possible debt retirement&#8221; in his budget.”  In fact, the plan was to do more, to “pay off the debt, deliver meaningful tax relief and address needed priorities, while preserving nearly a trillion dollars as protection against uncertainties.”  Note – that’s a one trillion dollar rainy day fund we were going to have by 2010.</p>
<p>On this initiative, as with many others, GW has failed to live up to his promises.  But this case was a bit different, in that the results were predictable from the start, and predictable using that tool beloved of the tax-cutters, the Laffer curve.  Now, the Laffer curve is like the weather – everyone talks about it, but nobody does anything about it.  In particular, nobody ever seems to bother to find the high point on the Laffer curve.</p>
<p>Consider <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2007/sheets/hist01z3.xls"> tax receipts as a percentage of GDP </a> and the <a href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/histaba.pdf"> highest marginal personal income tax rate.  </a> (Personal taxes are the largest component of income taxes, generally accounting for between about 2/3 and 85% of total income taxes.)  The correlation between the two series between 1950 and 2000 (the last year of data available when GW’s blueprint came out) was –0.36.  This would indicate that as the highest marginal personal income tax rate rises, taxes collected fall.   But… a closer look at the data reveals something else.</p>
<p>The following table shows the average highest individual marginal tax bracket for each sample period.  It also shows the correlation between the highest individual marginal tax bracket and the tax collections as a percentage of GDP:  </p>
<p>_Sample_____Av High__Correlation<br />1950 &#8211; 2000___64.72___-0.36<br />1960 &#8211; 2000___58.43___-0.26<br />1970 &#8211; 2000___51.36___-0.17<br />1980 &#8211; 2000___42.40____0.11<br />1990 &#8211; 2000___36.98____0.55</p>
<p>Notice…  the later data used in the sample, the lower the average of the highest marginal tax rate in the sample, and the higher the correlation between tax rates and tax collections.  </p>
<p>This fits nicely with the Laffer curve – when taxes are high, the correlation between tax rates and collections is negative, meaning that to increase collections, tax rates need to be decreased.  However, if tax rates are below a certain point, they become positively correlated with tax collections, so to cutting taxes further will only reduce tax collections.</p>
<p>The table above indicates that the US economy was on one side of the Laffer curve when the 1970s were included, and on the other side (i.e., the correlation flipped) when the 1970s were excluded, at which point the average of the highest marginal rate in the sample went from 51.36% to 42.40%.  (Not surprisingly, including data through 2005 doesn’t seem to change results much.  And to those who insist that somehow Clinton is at fault for everything, re-running this analysis leaving out the Clinton years actually leads to a higher “optimal” highest marginal tax rate.)</p>
<p>Anyone accustomed to using macroeconomic data should have known, back in 2001, that cutting taxes was going to lead to reduced tax revenues as a percentage of GDP, and therefore, a return to deficits rather than the ridiculous story peddled in GW’s Economic Blueprint.  Perhaps, just perhaps, GW himself could be forgiven his ignorance – the American public didn’t elect him because he was a smart man, after all, but we were told by his cheerleaders that he had good advisors.  The grownups were in charge.  And what of these grownups, these cheerleaders and advisors?  What of the Bartletts and the Kudlows, the Hubbards and the Mankiws, the O’Neill’s and the Snows?  These are people that call themselves economists, and are all quite well paid.  (Certainly much better paid than I am.)  What were they thinking when they cheerleaded and implemented?  What responsibility do they bear for the chain of events they helped put in place?</p>
<p>Postscript – my spreadsheets are available to anyone who wants them.</p>

                                <p>The Angry Bear site can get a bit slow because these posts usually take a bit of time to write.  Generally, one has to look up data and do at least a basic analysis before writing something, and then whatever gets written has to in some ways match the data and the analysis.</p>
<p>Now seems to be one of those slow times.  I&#8217;ve noticed even the prolific PGL hasn&#8217;t had a chance to post in the past couple of days (unless he beats me to it as I&#8217;m writing this right now), and the post I&#8217;m working on won&#8217;t be ready for a while (I gotta do some paying work right about now!), so I thought it might be useful to throw out a question (and make you folks do some work)&#8230;</p>
<p>Is there something that should be covered but isn&#8217;t in the economic blogosphere these days?  (Note &#8211; I&#8217;m not volunteering to take a stab at these topics.)  What are the important questions not being asked &#8211; and what do you think might be the &#8220;answers&#8221; to those questions?  Or perhaps you think there&#8217;s a data set not being looked at &#8211; what is it, and what does the data seem to say?</p>

                                <p><a href="http://hughhewitt.townhall.com/g/64bfd450-51e0-4579-8ae1-afffb9906533">Hugh Hewitt</a> is not happy that the “airbrush brigade” is comparing Path to 9/11 to <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/09/path-to-911-and-reagans.html">The Reagans</a>.  His reliance on CBS’s face-saving statement as to why The Reagans was pulled is a bit laughable.  Hugh also relies on the number of screeners who reviewed the film:<br />
<blockquote>First, hundreds of people have screened :The Path to 9/11,&#8221; including me and many other critics and/or hosts of large audience shows. (Complaints from tiny lefty bloggers that I received a screener and other s didn&#8217;t ignore the fact that I requested it weeks ago and that I have an audience in the millions, not the tens.)  To my knowledge not one professional critic has yet suggested the film is other than a powerful narrative of the era, especially chilling in its portrait of the enemy, or particularly damning of the Clinton-era fecklessness regading terror.  It isn&#8217;t like we don&#8217;t know that Monica was a distraction and Madeleine Albright a less-than-brilliant Secretary of State (how about that late lurch towards North Korea?)  John O&#8217;Neill was in fact fired; there were warnings that were ignored about the African embassy bombings, and no response followed the Cole attack and the American ambassador to Yemen was an obstruction to that investigation, Massoud was assasinated by al Qaeda.  These are not debatable subjects.  They are facts.</p></blockquote>
<p>Rush Limbaugh as an objective movie critic?  C’mon Hugh.  <a href="http://dneiwert.blogspot.com/2006/09/hewitt-lying-liar.html">David Neiwert</a> calls Hugh a liar for the false allegation that that John O&#8217;Neill was fired.  But let’s look a bit deeper at David’s <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/knew/john/timeline.html">link</a> as it helps us dig much deeper into Hugh’s whirlwind across a few important historical events.  O’Neill did retire during the summer of 2001 (and yes, George W. Bush was President by then).  O’Neill’s problems at the FBI were due to certain careless actions such as the July 2000 briefcase incident.  But also check out his efforts at making the nation safe from Al Qaeda.  Other members of the government during the Clinton years were also very dedicated to the same task – so when Hugh talks the “Clinton-era fecklessness” regarding terror, he is rewriting history.  For example, the O’Neill bio states:<br />
<blockquote>The turn of the millennium passes without incident. Lewis Schiliro recalls: &#8220;I remember talking to John shortly after midnight on that night, and there was a sense of accomplishment. We had just made the arrests in the Ressam spin-off. And, you know, certainly we believed we got everybody that we need to find. But you&#8217;re never really 100 percent sure of that.&#8221; In a July 2001 speech in Spain, O&#8217;Neill points to the millennium investigation as a model of good law enforcement. It underscored his core belief that in the fight against terrorism, everyone had to work together: &#8220;The coordinated approach of federal, state, and local law enforcement entities was integral to efforts to disrupt the alleged terrorist plot and greatly contributed to the presentation of evidence in the trial of Ahmed Ressam,&#8221; he tells the gathering.</p></blockquote>
<p>But let’s turn to the investigation of the Cole attack.  O’Neill and Ambassador Barbara Bodine did quarrel over the investigation, which drew the intervention of Louis Freeh and Janet Reno to continue the investigation.  Hugh forgets to tell us the latter.  Alas, the delays did cause the White House to learn that it was really Al Qaeda that ordered the Cole attack only after George W. Bush became President.</p>
<p>But why would that matter given the promise of Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to take out the Taliban if there was another terrorist attack.  President Clinton even ad Sandy Berger and Richard Clarke draw up what it appears to have been a very successful plan known as the Delenda plan to execute this promise.  Alas Condi Rice pretended she knew nothing about the plan that Berger told her about on December 20, 2000 and that Clarke presented her on January 25, 2001.  So its execution did not occur during the spring of 2001 but only during late 2001.  Too damn bad – but the truth that Hugh can’t admit is that it was the Bush-era fecklessness regarding terror during his first eight month in office that led to 9/11. </p>
<p>Finally, let’s turn to “Massoud was assasinated by al Qaeda”.  <a href="http://www.cooperativeresearch.org/entity.jsp?id=1521846767-914">General Ahmed Shah Massoud</a> was assassinated by Al Qaeda two days before 9/11. Does Hugh have any clue why?  My link has all sorts of tidbits:<br />
<blockquote>The CIA’s Counter Terrorism Center develops a plan to strike at bin Laden in Afghanistan called the “Blue Sky Memo.” It recommends increased support to anti-Taliban groups and especially a major effort to back Ahmed Shah Massoud’s Northern Alliance, to tie down al-Qaeda personnel before they leave Afghanistan. No action is taken in the last few weeks of the Clinton administration; the CIA presses the ideas unsuccessfully early in the new Bush administration. [9/11 Commission, 3/24/2004] … Ahmed Shah Massoud, leader of the Northern Alliance fighting the Taliban in Afghanistan, has been trying to get aid from the US but his people are only allowed to meet with low level US officials. In an attempt to get his message across, he addresses the European Parliament: “If President Bush doesn’t help us, these terrorists will damage the US and Europe very soon.”… Declassified Defense Intelligence Agency documents from November 2001 will suggest that Northern Alliance leader General Ahmed Shah Massoud had gained “limited knowledge” “regarding the intentions of [al-Qaeda] to perform a terrorist act against the US on a scale larger than the 1998 bombing of the US Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.” It further will point out he may have been assassinated on September 9, 2001, because he “began to warn the West.” … General Ahmed Shah Massoud, the leader of Afghanistan’s Northern Alliance, is assassinated by two al-Qaeda agents posing as Moroccan journalists. [Time, 8/4/2002] A legendary mujahedeen commander and a brilliant tactician, Massoud had pledged to bring freedom and democracy to Afghanistan. The BBC says the next day, “General Massoud’s death might well have meant the end of the [Northern] alliance” because there clearly was no figure with his skills and popularity to replace him. [BBC, 9/10/2001; BBC, 9/10/2001] “With Massoud out of the way, the Taliban and al-Qaeda would be rid of their most effective opponent and be in a stronger position to resist the American onslaught.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Some accounts had Osama bin Laden hoping to take out other leaders of the Northern Alliance before 9/11.  What was bin Laden’s goal in these attacks on us?  To get American boots on the ground in a Muslim nation.  He learned of the ability of the CIA to work with local rebels during the 1980’s when we helped the Afghan Arabs undermine the Soviet puppet regime.  He also therefore reasoned there had to be something like the Delenda plan where an effective Northern Alliance could topple the Taliban without many US boots on the ground.  So he decided to take out Massoud and the other leaders of the Northern Alliance.  Isn’t it amazing that Osama bin Laden knew more about our capabilities than NSA director Condi Rice?  </p>
<p>The goods news is that bin Laden’s plans crumpled when General Franks executed this Delenda plan during the months AFTER 9/11.  But then there was that idiotic decision on March 19, 2003 to put American boots on the ground in Iraq.  Since President Bush has a new fondness for quoting Osama bin Laden, let’s recall that bin Laden called the invasion of Iraq a “gift from God”.  </p>
<p>Historians will chastise both Hugh and me for trying to write history today.  We likely need a generation to get past all the partisan garbage.  I suspect the defenders of Path to 9/11 are hoping it will assist in their partisan zeal of avoiding a real Congress led by Nancy Pelosi.  I suspect their efforts will fail.  But when our grandkids are reading the real history of this period, they’ll wonder why it took our nation so long to get rid of the GOP appeasers of the demagogue known as George W. Bush.  I suspect they’ll never understand why we reelected the worst President in American history.</p>

                                <p>On ABC’s This Week, George Will may have explained why the Federal budget has such a large deficit.  He claimed that Iran’s GDP was only one-third of Donald Rumsfeld’s defense budget.  According to <a href="https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/ir.html#Econ">this source</a>, Iran’s GDP in 2005 was $561.6 billion.  Was our Federal defense spending really around $1.7 trillion?  <a href="http://www.bea.gov/bea/dn/nipaweb/SelectTable.asp?Selected=N">This source</a> defense spending in 2005 was $589.3 billion.  Who to trust?</p>

                                <p>It would seem that some of the left want ABC to pull Path to 9/11, while some on the right are accusing liberals of censorship Let’s go back three years to the furor over The Reagans when the shoe was on the other foot. <br />First, there was the reaction of <a href="http://www.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2003/10/27/234029.shtml">Ed Meese</a>: <br />
<blockquote>It is typical of the far left that they cannot afford to have Ronald Reagan be seen as successful.&#8221; That success, Meese added, &#8220;refutes all of their lies about politics, economics and about people.&#8221; In fact, the former chief of staff for Gov. Reagan, top White House aide and later attorney general sees the CBS miniseries as a frantic and desperate attempt to counteract &#8220;a lot of factual material&#8221; that has come out about the 40th president, &#8220;including his letters, a recent updated biography by Lou Cannon, a book by Peter Robinson, other books that have come out [such as] the Time magazine article on his letters and all this sort of thing, which paints the true picture of Ronald Reagan.&#8221; All of this thoroughly documented material, says Meese, shows Reagan &#8220;in a light that is anathema to those on the left, and I think that&#8217;s why this is really a very cynical and very malicious plot, really, to try to darken his reputation.&#8221; Meese had seen the video trailer of the miniseries and shot down its &#8220;inflammatory&#8221; and &#8220;vicious&#8221; charges point by point &#8230; The script writer for the CBS hatchet job admits that the depiction of Reagan as having a calloused attitude toward AIDS victims was something she just made up. And Meese adds that the entire issue of AIDS did not come in through Nancy Reagan. It was Surgeon General C. Everett Koop who &#8220;brought that issue to the Cabinet&#8221; and it was handled &#8220;like a whole bunch of other issues in the Cabinet.&#8221;  Contrary to the miniseries&#8217; assertion that Nancy Reagan pleaded with the president to support giving condoms and needles to drug addicts to combat the spread of AIDS, Meese &#8220;would seriously doubt it because [in fact] she was very much against supplying needles, particularly because of her &#8216;Just Say No&#8217; anti-drug activities.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>While some of us might have wanted the government to address the AIDS problem more quickly, Meese was right to criticize this movie for his slanderous claims.  Next up comes a pretty good National Review piece from <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/comment/morrow200310270837.asp">Ed Morrow</a>: <br />
<blockquote>Public officials can easily be slandered when they happen to be hated by the makers of popular culture &#8230; The substitution of propaganda for fact is dangerous. It&#8217;s not by accident that tyrants create &#8220;history&#8221; to justify their schemes. Hitler couldn&#8217;t have taken control of Germany without the many anti-Semitic myths that had been allowed to fester and go unchallenged. Stalin and Mao couldn&#8217;t have kept a heel on the neck of their countries without self-glorifying myths that demonized anyone who stood in their way. In this case, simple justice demands that the lies about Ronald and Nancy Reagan must not go unchallenged but, in a larger sense, truth itself must be defended. Attempts to distort our history must be resisted. Historical truth is simply too valuable to be made a plaything for biased filmmakers rewriting it to fit their politics … A boycott of the sponsors of The Reagans is a start. Don&#8217;t buy anything advertised during this broadcast. Write or e-mail the sponsors and CBS to tell them of your choice. This may help prevent such biased productions in the future. You can also write newspapers and magazines to protest the miniseries and to encourage others to boycott sponsors. A boycott of sponsors, however, doesn&#8217;t reach CBS directly. They are airing The Reagans during Sweeps, hoping controversy about it will spike their ratings. High ratings during Sweeps allows them to charge higher rates for advertising. They are willing to take heat from sponsors if their ad rates can be inflated. It can produce millions for them in the future. The only way to defeat this despicable exploitation is to try to reduce the CBS&#8217;s ratings.</p></blockquote>
<p>The threat of a boycott worked and CBS relegated this film to Showtime.  Incidentally, I would have refused to watch this silly film regardless of where it was aired.  <a href="http://www.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2003/11/4/174327.shtml"> John LeBoutillier</a> captured the right’s reaction of CBS’s decision to pull this silly movie in Total Victory:<br />
<blockquote>CBS&#8217;s decision to cancel the Reagan movie is one of the greatest victories – ever – for the conservative movement over the left-wing, so-called mainstream, media. Nov. 4 is a huge day for the Reagans, for truth and for America.</p></blockquote>
<p>To be fair, some on the left were not happy with CBS’s ultimate decision.  <a href="http://www.cjr.org/issues/2003/6/reagans-grossman.asp">Lawrence Grossman and Newton Minow</a> write:<br />
<blockquote>what CBS did will have serious consequences for all of television for a very long time. It reminds us of the lessons we learned from another television program that caused an even bigger firestorm than &#8220;The Reagans,&#8221; and was handled very differently.  We were president and chairman, respectively, of PBS in 1980, when &#8220;Death of a Princess,&#8221; a portrayal of the public execution of a young Saudi princess who had been accused of adultery, was scheduled to run on World, the network&#8217;s news and public affairs series. The government of Saudi Arabia and Mobil Oil, PBS&#8217;s major underwriter, urged us very publicly not to broadcast the program because it reflected badly on Saudi life. The secretary of state wrote us a letter, released simultaneously to the press, urging us to reevaluate PBS&#8217;s decision to broadcast the program, given the subject&#8217;s potential damage to our relations with an important ally. Members of Congress from both parties decried &#8220;Death of a Princess,&#8221; fearing the Saudis would shut off the nation&#8217;s oil supply and cause a severe economic downturn. The protests against the program made headlines nationwide before anyone even had a chance to see it … CBS made three mistakes in its handling of &#8220;The Reagans&#8221;. Its first mistake was to produce an entertainment series that focused on President Reagan&#8217;s personal life while he is suffering from serious illness and being cared for by his wife. That&#8217;s called bad taste.  Its second mistake was to succumb to outside pressure by abruptly canceling the series and putting it on Showtime, its more restricted cable network. That&#8217;s called setting a terrible precedent.  CBS&#8217;s third mistake was to deny that it had caved in to outside pressure and claim it was a &#8220;moral call.&#8221; That&#8217;s called misleading.  By canceling &#8220;The Reagans,&#8221; CBS set a dangerous example for dealing with the pressures that invariably arise to kill controversial programs before they can be seen. The network&#8217;s weakness will only encourage future protesters from the left and right to demand that programs they don&#8217;t like be pulled. Such programs, especially news documentaries on tough issues, are already network television&#8217;s most endangered species.</p></blockquote>
<p>On the other hand, Path to 9/11 is not a documentary but rather something on the order of a Michael Moore film or more precisely some Sean Hannity show.  The truth is that the Clinton Administration worked very hard to counter the threats from Al Qaeda.  Maybe it drives the rightwing nuts that the Bush Administration during the summer of 2001 did not work nearly as hard.  So they have to praise a film that gets this exactly backwards.  Fine – we have seen for years how they have to distort the record in order to make their bogus claims that the Bush Administration is hard on terrorists as opposed to we Democrats who are not.  I say – let them make fools of themselves with this stupid movie.  I will not watch their lies.</p>

                                <p>The always excellent <a href="http://www.bc.edu/centers/crr/ib_52.shtml">Alicia Munnell</a> and her co-authors Mauricio Soto, Jerilyn Libby, and John Prinzivalli have just released an interesting analysis:<br />
<blockquote>The bottom line is that over the period 1988-2004 defined benefit plans outperformed 401(k) plans by one percentage point. This outcome occurred despite the fact that 401(k) plans held a higher portion of their assets in equities during the bull market of the 1990s. Part of the explanation may rest with higher fees, which are deducted before returns are reported to participants. But the one percentage point shortfall understates the investment problem in 401(k) plans, since an aggregate number does not reflect the fact that more than half of participants in 401(k) plans do not follow the prudent investment strategy of diversifying their holdings. Finally, the available data suggest that IRAs produce even lower returns than 401(k) plans, which, if true, implies trouble ahead given the massive amount of money that is being rolled over into these accounts.</p></blockquote>
