                                <p>Reader Dan sends a letter (the link he provided no longer applies) in the WSJ:</p>
<blockquote><p>Your page-one article &#8220;Note to Medicaid Patients: The Doctor Won&#8217;t See You,&#8221; July 19) provides a shocking commentary on the difference in attitudes and behavior to two populations, the elderly and the poor.</p>
<p>As the first chairman of the Secretary&#8217;s Medicaid Advisory Committee in the mid- and late-1960s, I can attest that these differences existed from the first days of Medicare and Medicaid.</p>
<p>Of course it is shocking to find the difference in payment &#8212; and treatment &#8212; for the two populations by the same government.</p>
<p>If $357.58, the amount paid by Medicare, is the &#8220;correct&#8221; payment for the treatment of a broken arm, then how can $184.51 be the correct payment for a Medicaid patient? Either Medicaid is underpaying or Medicare is overpaying. We all know which.</p>
<p>Even so, it is also shocking that so few physicians will see Medicaid patients given that these physicians were more than willing to accept and be the beneficiaries of the large subsidy by government to their medical education.</p>
<p>I would suggest that each person entering medical school be given a choice: Don&#8217;t take the subsidy (somewhere in the neighborhood of $150,000 to $200,000) and be free to choose your patients as you see fit, or accept the subsidy and in return agree to treat all patients who need your help. This isn&#8217;t involuntary servitude. In the words so dear to all, the prospective physician would be &#8220;free to choose.&#8221;</p>

<p>Since Dan doesn&#8217;t comment, I will.  This is a phenomenom I&#8217;ve seen in a lot of industries.  One can be a rugged individualist free-market type while getting all kinds of bennies from the government.  Rugged individualist free-market views only conflict with others receiving bennies from the gubmint.</p>

                                <p>Regular readers know one of the things that annoys me is people shading or hiding information. Without information, one cannot decide what&#8217;s going on. So I was dismayed to read <a href="http://www.thecarpetbaggerreport.com/archives/11609.html">this piece by Steve Benen</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>For some inexplicable reason, Republicans have been preoccupied for quite some time with Baghdad’s electrical supply, pointing to it as one of the good-news stories that Americans allegedly don’t hear about. The <a href="http://www.thecarpetbaggerreport.com/archives/7883.html">White House urged</a> the media to cover it more a year ago; <a href="http://www.thecarpetbaggerreport.com/archives/7702.html">Tony Snow bragged</a> about Iraq’s electricity-generating facilities; and then-House Speaker boasted of Baghdad’s shining lights as an example of progress in the war.</p>
<p>At one point, the president even <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2006/07/20060707-1.html">felt a little sorry for himself</a>, whining to reporters at a press conference, “[I]ncreasing electricity in Baghdad is not the kind of thing that tends to get on the news.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The reason Benen feels this focus makes little sense is that&#8230; the electricity supply to Baghdad has been dropping and dropping and dropping&#8230; Eventually, reality catches up even with this administration, so they came up with a plan to <a href="http://www.latimes.com/la-na-iraqpower27jul27,0,7131927,full.story?coll=la-home-center">do something about it</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>As the Bush administration struggles to convince lawmakers that its Iraq war strategy is working, it has stopped reporting to Congress a key quality-of-life indicator in Baghdad: how long the power stays on.</p>
<p>Ryan Crocker, the U.S. ambassador to Iraq, told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee last week that Baghdad residents could count on only “an hour or two a day” of electricity. That’s down from an average of five to six hours a day earlier this year.</p>
<p>But that piece of data has not been sent to lawmakers for months because the State Department, which prepares a weekly “status report” for Congress on conditions in Iraq, stopped estimating in May how many hours of electricity Baghdad residents typically receive each day.</p></blockquote>
<p>Instead, they&#8217;ll report on &#8220;electricity generated nationwide&#8221;, rather than electricity actually received anywhere. There are three advantages to this I can see for folks who are more interested in manipulation of data than actual results:</p>
<p>1. The new series is not comparable with the old series, making then and now comparisons harder.<br />2. Electricity generation is easier than actually getting it supplied somewhere.<br />3. Electricity generation figures are easier to fudge than electricity supply figures. One can always say: &#8220;We produced X gigawatts.&#8221; How do you check? But if they claim &#8220;Baghdad is receiving 20 hours of electricity a day&#8221; anyone at a hotel in the city can tell you whether that figure is in the ballpark or not.</p>
<p>All in all, this is a bad sign all around. Its a bad sign that once again, data is being manipulated. And its a bad sign that things are getting worse in Iraq. Come to think of it, hiding this data in itself gives us some data about what is going on.</p>

                                <p>Apparently the New Republic published an article by a soldier in Iraq describing some bad behavior he had observed committed by some US troops.</p>
<p>Read <a href="http://jonswift.blogspot.com/2007/07/punishing-scott-thomas-beauchamp.html">Jon Swift</a> to get a snarky view of the reaction of the right blogosphere. (BTW&#8230; he has a link to a video taken from inside a hummer driving in Baghdad &#8211; its worth a watch.) </p>
<p>I have no idea if the guy from TNR is lying or not and I don&#8217;t read TNR. I do recognize that bad things happen in war, and if whether its accurate or not, its extremely unlikely that no soldiers in Iraq are behaving more or less as described. So what I found interesting about the views from the right is the idea that <a href="http://betsyspage.blogspot.com/2007/07/scott-thomas-identified.html">someone with real concern &#8230; would have reported such behavior to the authorities</a>.</p>
<p>So I went rummaging around and found this fascinating paper presented <a href="http://www.usafa.af.mil/jscope/JSCOPE02/Bordin02.html">military&#8217;s Joint Services Conference On Professional Ethics</a>. It describes a few examples of, um, &#8220;distaste for independent thinkers&#8221; that have occurred in the military. </p>
<p>Consider the difference in the career paths that happened two characters involved peripherally in My Lai massacre. (Also noted in the report I cited.) </p>
<p>Hugh Thompson, who tried to stop the massacre, was &#8220;at grave risk of being courts-martialed for his actions and was ostracized and eventually involuntarily discharged from the U.S. Army.&#8221; On the other hand, Major Colin Powell, &#8220;refuted and disparaged the few enlisted soldiers who came forth to report the atrocity&#8221; and we all know where he eventually ended up. </p>
<p>More recently, there was the Tillman incident, and the Jessica Lynch incident&#8230; but those were the well-known incidents. Perhaps you feel those were all the incidents&#8230; who would know about most of them? Who would know what happened to the people involved? </p>
<p>And given how long it takes for the record to be set right in the cases where it is set right (again, we all remember who made out better in the end &#8211; Thompson or Colin Powell, just as one example), why would we expect anyone to speak up? Seriously?</p>
<p>&#8212;-</p>
<p>Aside 1. I find it interesting that at one point Powell was seriously considered a presidential contender. Its not just the My Lai massacre, he also was involved in Iran Contra. Clearly towing the line what people look for in a soldier.</p>
<p>&#8212;-</p>
<p>This post should not be understood as anti-military. In my opinion, most large organization &#8211; and that includes most large corporations &#8211; develop a certain amount of groupthink and punish those who violate that groupthink. Regular readers know I&#8217;ve written about that in the past.</p>

<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p>There is a lot of antiwar sentiment here on this blog and in the country.  We get our information mainly as it is presented by the media and filtered through the pundits.  This post is not to cast aspersions on the anti war but to celebrate the honest heartfelt motivations of this 23 year old, UCLA  grad, married young man who voluteered to go to Iraq and he encapsulates the best of why we fight over there (if only GWB was this eloquent) on his <a href="http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&#038;friendID=46348938"> myspace page.</a>  Please read it carefully.  Some of the highlights:</p>
<blockquote><p>Why I Joined: This question has been asked of me so many times in so many different contexts that I thought it would be best if I wrote my reasons for joining the Army on my page for all to see.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong><br />
<blockquote>What was once a paralyzed state of fear is now the staging ground for one of the largest transformations of power and ideology the Middle East has experienced since the collapse of the Ottoman Empire. Thanks to Iran, Syria, and other enlightened local actors, this transformation will be plagued by interregional hatred and genocide. And I am now in the center of this. Is this why I joined? Yes.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong><br />
<blockquote>I joined the fight because it occurred to me that many modern day &#8220;humanists&#8221; who claim to possess a genuine concern for human beings throughout the world are in fact quite content to allow their fellow &#8220;global citizens&#8221; to suffer under the most hideous state apparatuses and conditions. Their excuses used to be my excuses. When asked why we shouldn&#8217;t confront the Ba&#8217;ath party, the Taliban or the various other tyrannies throughout this world, my answers would allude to vague notions of cultural tolerance (forcing women to wear a veil and stay indoors is such a quaint cultural tradition), the sanctity of national sovereignty (how eager we internationalists are to throw up borders to defend dictatorships!) or even a creeping suspicion of America&#8217;s intentions. When all else failed, I would retreat to my fragile moral ecosystem that years of living in peace and liberty had provided me.</p></blockquote>
<p>One final note: he was <a href="http://www.ocregister.com/ocregister/news/homepage/article_1547859.php">killed</a> January 2007.  </p>
<p>Was his life wasted?</p>

                                <p>I had a post this morning looking at the evolution of <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/07/comparing-presidents-national-debt.html">real debt per capita and debt as a percent of GDP</a> over time, focusing on changes by Presidential administration.  </p>
<p>The graph, which went back to 1952, showed that all the Presidents in the sample except St. Ronald the Reagan, GHW, and GW managed to decrease the debt.  It was suggested that perhaps this was due to business cycles.  Regular readers this was also given as a possible reason for an earlier series of posts in which it was shown that for whatever reason, growth in real GDP per capita tends to be higher under Dem administrations than under Rep administrations.  Regular readers know I also went through a whole series of posts showing that even taking the business cycle into account, that wasn&#8217;t the explanation.</p>
<p>So I want to address the issue when it comes to debt as well&#8230; but I really don&#8217;t want to have to write a whole bunch of posts on this one issue.  I figured I&#8217;d do something a bit different this time&#8230; I took one of the graphs from the earlier post on debt, and I added in periods for which there was a recession (in black).  </p>
<p>Periods for which there was a <a href="http://nber.org/cycles/cyclesmain.html">recession</a>:</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RqlDy0PDHnI/AAAAAAAAAfo/lOcI5xPhEqU/s1600-h/recessions+since+1952.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RqlDy0PDHnI/AAAAAAAAAfo/lOcI5xPhEqU/s320/recessions+since+1952.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Real GDP per capita since 1952</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RqlFHUPDHoI/AAAAAAAAAfw/LYXnYDsNijU/s1600-h/recessions+since+1952.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RqlFHUPDHoI/AAAAAAAAAfw/LYXnYDsNijU/s320/recessions+since+1952.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>I tried to put a black bar in wherever there was a recession during the fiscal year &#8211; hopefully I didn&#8217;t screw up.  (Recall&#8230; fiscal years ran through June until 1976, and through September thereafter.)  I realize that in some years, the recession lasted all year, and in some years, it was over quickly, but this was the best I could do on a graph.</p>
<p>Assuming I didn&#8217;t screw up, it really doesn&#8217;t look like recessions are the reason debt increased under the 3 fiscally irresponsible presidents.  Granted, all three of them had recessions early in their term, but they kept driving up the debt long after the recession ended.  Besides, JFK/LBJ and Nixon/Ford both had recessions early in their terms, and managed to decrease the debt.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>BTW&#8230; Data on debt comes from OMB Table <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2008/sheets/hist07z1.xls">White House OMB Table 7.1</a> &#8211; the figure used was debt held by the public.  Where the debt was made “real” and “per capita”, inflation was calculated from <a href="ftp://ftp.bls.gov/pub/special.requests/cpi/cpiai.txt">CPI figures</a> and population came from <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/Index.asp">BEA NIPA Table 7.1</a>.  CPI figures used were average for the fiscal year, and population figures were for the quarter the fiscal year ended.  (Note that the fiscal year ended in June until 1976, and in September thereafter.)</p>

                                <p>Wal-Mart is moving through the midwest converting stores to “super-centers.”</p>
<p>A super-center includes an auto service shop and full service grocery.</p>
<p>“Converting” is really the wrong word, because W-M almost always builds a new store and abandons the prior building.</p>
<p>And what happens to the abandoned building?  In most communities no business needs that  much square footage, so it sits empty. And sits. And sits. And creates a ghost center, if not an eyesore.</p>
<p>Where are the trial lawyers when we need them?</p>

                                <p>This post looks at national debt by presidency. (Long time readers may recall I did this <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/11/national-debt-by-presidency.html">once before</a>, back in the day before I figured out how to put graphs up on blogger.)</p>
<p>Data on debt comes from OMB Table <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2008/sheets/hist07z1.xls">White House OMB Table 7.1</a> &#8211; the figure used was debt held by the public. Where the debt was made “real” and “per capita”, inflation was calculated from <a href="ftp://ftp.bls.gov/pub/special.requests/cpi/cpiai.txt">CPI figures</a> and population came from <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/Index.asp">BEA NIPA Table 7.1</a>. CPI figures used were average for the fiscal year, and population figures were for the quarter the fiscal year ended. (Note that the fiscal year ended in June until 1976, and in September thereafter.)</p>
<p>Here’s real debt per capita…</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RqiLN0PDHkI/AAAAAAAAAfQ/FlCWzntUK30/s1600-h/debt+-+graph+1.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RqiLN0PDHkI/AAAAAAAAAfQ/FlCWzntUK30/s320/debt+-+graph+1.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Here’s debt as a percentage of GDP.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RqiLGEPDHjI/AAAAAAAAAfI/Sjs-rBw0-ps/s1600-h/debt+-+graph+2.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RqiLGEPDHjI/AAAAAAAAAfI/Sjs-rBw0-ps/s320/debt+-+graph+2.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>A couple summary tables…</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RqiKvkPDHiI/AAAAAAAAAfA/gNA__XDvR88/s1600-h/debt+-+table+1.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RqiKvkPDHiI/AAAAAAAAAfA/gNA__XDvR88/s320/debt+-+table+1.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RqiKp0PDHhI/AAAAAAAAAe4/n7DPCeTs52A/s1600-h/debt+-+table+2.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RqiKp0PDHhI/AAAAAAAAAe4/n7DPCeTs52A/s320/debt+-+table+2.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>So, what do we see… In terms of real debt per capita, Clinton was the big debt decreaser, distantly followed by Ike, himself distantly followed by Nixon/Ford and Carter and JFK/LBJ. Bringing up the shameful rear, the only 3 Presidents to increase the size of real debt per person were GW, GHW, and St. Ronald the Reagan.</p>
<p>When it came to cutting debt as a percentage of GDP, Clinton came first, followed by JFK/LBJ, Ike, Nixon/Ford and Carter. (JFK/LBJ did better by this count because real GDP per capita grew so quickly in that period.) Once again, GW, GHW, and especially St. Ronald the Reagan were the three fiscally irresponsible presidents, being the only ones who increased the size of the debt. </p>
<p>Is debt a bad thing? Well&#8230; it depends&#8230; driving up the national debt is like driving up a person&#8217;s debt &#8211; its fine if its a temporary thing, and it leads to greater growth. (E.g., borrowing to go to school can be fiscally responsible if it will lead to a high paying career.) But unfortunately, it <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/02/god-punishes-us-when-we-collectively_19.html">does not appear that this has been the case for Reagan, GHW and GW</a>.</p>
<p>Some will also protest that the President is merely a bystander when it comes to debt, and Congress is the culprit. Its true that Congress is an enabler, but the President submits the budget. Besides&#8230; take a look at the graphs&#8230; do the patterns seem to change when Congress changes, or when the President changes?</p>
<p>And one more thing&#8230; Presidents talk about their effect on the debt. The very first item on the list of <em>Major Policy Initiatives</em> on GW&#8217;s Economic Blueprint (released February 28, 2001) was <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/usbudget/blueprint/bud01.html">Pay Down the Federal Debt</a>. In fact, it has this nifty graph&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RqiPAkPDHlI/AAAAAAAAAfY/gGe4oy7ze4U/s1600-h/debt+-+GW%27s+Economic+Blueprint+Chart.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RqiPAkPDHlI/AAAAAAAAAfY/gGe4oy7ze4U/s320/debt+-+GW%27s+Economic+Blueprint+Chart.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>And we are told this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Indeed, the President&#8217;s Budget pays down the debt so aggressively that it runs into an unusual problem—its annual surpluses begin to outstrip the amount of maturing debt starting in 2007. This means that the United States will be effectively unable to retire any more debt than what is assumed in the Administration&#8217;s Budget over the next 10 years—the President achieves &#8220;maximum possible debt retirement&#8221; in his budget.</p></blockquote>
<p>And now an editorial comment / daily installment of Bush Derangement Syndrome&#8230; can GW&#8217;s failures on the debt be excused by 9/11, the Wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the end of the tech bubble? I don&#8217;t think so&#8230; JFK/LBJ inherited a recession and fought a war &#8211; it was also fought in an undeveloped country, but not only did they have to contend with insurgents, they had to contend with a regular army, and both were trained and supplied by a super power. Nixon fought the same war, and had to contend with an oil embargo at the same time. Both managed to cut the debt, and JFK/LBJ produced far, far more impressive growth in real GDP per capita to boot. </p>

<blockquote><p>For over a decade GAO has run long-term simulations showing that absent a change in policy, the combined effects of demographic changes and growing health care costs drive ever-increasing federal deficits and debt levels. The Comptroller General has repeatedly warned that the current fiscal path of the federal government is “imprudent and unsustainable”. State and local governments provide an array of services to their residents, and the federal government relies on these governments to assist in the realization of national goals. State and local governments also rely on federal grants to varying extents. These subnational governments may also face fiscal stress. To provide Congress and the public with a broader national context, GAO has developed a fiscal model of the state and local sector.<br />The GAO state and local model projects the level of receipts and expenditures of the sector in future years based on current and historical spending and revenue patterns. In the “base case” model we assume that the current set of policies in place across federal, state, and local governments remains constant. The primary data source for the model is the National Income and Product Accounts. The timeframe for the simulations parallels that of our federal fiscal model—the simulations extend until 2050. The state and local model examines the aggregate fiscal outcomes for the sector and does not examine the condition of any individual state or local government.</p></blockquote>
<p>The report has a picture:</p>

<p>Selling assets is becoming a trend to fund the requirements of sub-national governments, especially highways at the moment, and water resources for things like bottled water, which generates large profits. That is for another post, but is a reflection of a trend of declining revenue</p>
<p>There is another trend in WTO GATS agreements that also undercuts local and state functions of regulating for public good. Of course, our own system is built on Federalism.</p>
<p>WTO GATS agreements VI.4 stress treating much of what we have financed publicly as commodities, with particular kind of market rules.</p>
<p><em>&#8216;National treatment&#8217;</em> is a benchmark for eliminating sub-national regulation of trade, meaning highways, water resources, electricity etc, US corporations are used to operating with different sets of state rules, and of course seek consistency. But GATS rules make challenges to any local rule much easier by anyone in the world who has a corporation, and domestic company advantages in commodities like water are removed.</p>
<p><em>&#8216;market efficiency&#8217;</em> Within the frame, local regulation can be challenged in the name of restricting market operations. Comparative advantage is sort of smoothed out.</p>
<p><em>&#8216;least burdensome regulation&#8217;</em>, and<br />If one state&#8217;s rules are stricter than another, the stricter regulations can be challenged on this basis. Domestic rules for an industry become less relevant.</p>
<p><em>&#8216;objective criterion&#8217;</em>. Public Utility Commissions often have unstated assumptions about public good and such, so will be restricted to only defined and replicable criterion.</p>
<p>How does this play out in the real world? And who plays?</p>

                                <p>Reader Dan follows up the posts earlier this week on suicide by finding <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2007/HEALTH/06/11/vets.suicide/index.html">this</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The risk of suicide among male U.S. veterans is double that of the general population, according to a study published Monday. </p>
<p>&#8220;We need to be more alert to the problem of suicide as a major public health issue and we need to do better screening among individuals who have served in the military, probe for their mental health risk as well as gun availability,&#8221; said Dr. Mark S. Kaplan, professor of community health at Portland State University in Oregon, lead author of the study in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health.</p>
<p>For 12 years, Kaplan and his team of researchers followed more than 104,000 veterans who had served in the armed forces at some time between 1917 and 1994 and compared them with more than 216,000 non-veterans.</p>
<p>In all, between 1986 and 1997, 508 of them committed suicide &#8212; 197 veterans and 311 non-veterans.</p>
<p>After adjusting for a host of potentially compounding factors, including age, time of service and health status, the study showed that those who had been in the military were 2.13 times more likely to die of suicide over time.</p>
<p>At biggest risk were veterans who were white, those who had gone to college and those with activity limitations, according to the study, which was funded by the National Institute of Mental Health.</p>
<p>&#8216;Life is too complex&#8217;<br />Still, Kaplan would not say that the study proves that military service itself results in an increased risk of suicide. &#8220;I never feel comfortable claiming a causal relationship,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Life is too complex.&#8221;</p>
<p>No surprise was the finding that veterans were more likely to use guns to end their lives than were their non-veteran counterparts.</p>
<p>One unanticipated finding was that being overweight appeared to confer protection from suicide by more than 50 percent, the study found.</p>
<p>Kaplan cited a paucity of data on the subject, but said it might have to do with the fact that people who are underweight are more likely to smoke, and smokers are more likely to be depressed.</p></blockquote>
