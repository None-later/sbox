                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Why do people take out an adjustable rate mortgage (ARM) when buying or refinancing a house? Many economists would probably argue that it should depend primarily on one&#8217;s expectations for future interest rates: if you think interest rates are very low and are likely to rise, you should lock them in with a fixed rate, while if you think they are likely to fall in the future then an ARM makes more sense.</p>
<p>But there is another possible reason that people may prefer an ARM, in a world where people are credit-constrained: ARMs charge a lower rate of interest, at least initially, and thus enable one to pay more money for a house for a given a monthly mortgage payment.</p>
<p>With this in mind, take a look at the following chart. The dark and light blue lines show the average interest rate charged on 30-year fixed and 1-year adjustable rate (AR) mortgages since January 2002. Meanwhile, the orange line (measured against the right axis) shows the percent of new mortgages taken out that have an adjustable rate.</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/mba_data.jpg"><br />Source: <a href="http://www.mortgagebankers.org/marketdata/index.html">Mortgage Bankers Association</a> data on new mortgage applications.  Data represents the average of the second and third weeks of each month.</p>
<p>Clearly the proportion of ARMs jumped in the summer of 2003, and again the spring of 2004, in response to jumps in fixed interest rates. But the odd thing is that after both jumps in the 30-year fixed interest rate, it then subsquently fell, nearly back to where it started. Yet the proportion of borrowers choosing ARMs over fixed rate mortgages did not fall. The result is that, even though the interest rate on ARMs is about the same as it was in the second half of 2002, and the interest rate on 30 year fixed mortgages is lower than it was then, a far larger portion of mortgages today are ARMs.</p>
<p>In other words, it seems that there has been a secular underlying trend toward ARMs. Now we come back to my opening comments in this post. I would suggest two possible reasons for this trend toward ARMs and away from fixed-rate mortgages: either expectations about future interest rates have changed, or increasing numbers of people have decided to pay more for their house than they can afford with a fixed-rate mortgage.</p>
<p>Personally, I don&#8217;t really believe that interest rate expectations have changed that dramatically since early 2003. (Reasonable people could differ on this point, however.)  So to me, the orange line in the chart above tells the story of millions of home buyers who are spending more than they could afford at an interest rate of 5.5-6.0%.  After all, if they could afford their house at 5.5%, and if they don&#8217;t expect interest rates to fall dramatically, then they would have chosen the fixed rate mortgage, not the AR mortgage.</p>
<p>This is bad news, because an interest rate of 5.5-6.0% is not that high&#8230; and yet it&#8217;s too high for many recent home buyers. If 1-year interest rates to rise by just 1.5%, millions of recent home buyers will find their mortgage payments unaffordable. Yet there are plenty of reasonable scenarios that raise 1-year interest rates by that modest amount in the next year or two&#8230; which means that we shouldn&#8217;t find it surprising if millions of recent home buyers soon find themselves unable to afford to live in their own houses.</p>

This economist was likely thinking about <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2005/06/09/news/economy/fed_greenspan_testimony/index.htm?cnn=yes"> monetary policy </a>, which has been concerned about the alleged tightening of labor, which <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/06/is-labor-market-strong-or-weak.html">Kash</a> also discussed on Friday.  </p>
<p>If Kash is the Jedi Master of charts, I’m likely the Padawan.  Kash has been busy graphing not just the average workweek and real wages but also real compensation versus productivity – as well as <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/06/are-earnings-rising-or-stagnant.html">this discussion</a> on the various measures of real earnings.  All that is left to the Padawan is to update <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/05/unchanged-unemployment-rate.html">my chart</a> on why I put less stock in the unemployment rate than the population ratio.   Notice, however, that the employment-to-population ratio did rise a bit last month as the Household Survey showed a much larger employment increase than the Establishment Survey (which was also picked up by one of the National Review’s <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_buzzcharts/buzzcharts200506031253.asp">pseudoeconomists</a> who only think they know more economics than Paul Krugman).  Note also that this ratio is still far below the levels enjoyed five years ago.  While I can understand the FED’s reasoning for tight money five years ago (although why George W. Bush and Lawrence Lindsey were proposing fiscal stimulus back then puzzled me), I’m in the camp of those who would argue against tight money now as the labor market still appears weak to me.  </p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/ep.JPG"></p>
<p>Kash also noted that DeLong-Samwick dialogue how to read the employment-to-population ratio and the decline in the labor force participation rate – with Brad’s contribution being that compensation has not increased as fast as productivity, which he interprets as a signal that the demand for labor curve has shifted downwards versus Andrew’s implied suggestion that the supply curve has shifted inwards.  In addition to Kash’s charts, let me add this chart of real wages and real fringe benefits using the data source suggested by Brad.  Whether real wages have risen slightly in the last couple of years (Kash’s chart) or fallen slightly (my chart) depends on which subsector we are talking about (albeit<a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/thecorner/05_05_29_corner-archive.asp#065051">Lawrence Kudlow</a> would have the non-supervisory employees rejoice in the fact the nominal wages rose at all), but the main message seems to be that much of the increase in real compensation comes from fringe benefits such as health insurance premiums, which Kash claims “yield little or no actual improvements in health care for the average person”.  </p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/rc.JPG"></p>
<p>Kash later notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>But let me reiterate the point that I have made several times now: just because real compensation is rising, that doesn’t mean that people are better off, particularly if nearly all of the gains are just going to paying higher health insurance premiums. This data persuasively illustrates that nearly all of our real compensation gains today (and I do think we&#8217;re seeing them) are being eaten up by the monster that we call a health care system in the US. Until we address the profound inadequacies of our health care system, this trend will only get worse.</p></blockquote>
<p>Kash <em>has</em> made this point several times.  I would like to add a couple of items – one being the implications of this insight for the labor demand / labor supply debate and the other being an attempt to offer a wee bit of empirical evidence drawn from BLS data on Employer Cost for Employee Compensation.  In various papers on the effect of minimum wages, <a href="http://www.epionline.org/study_detail.cfm?sid=32&#038;group=mw">Walter Wessels</a> has argued:</p>
<blockquote><p>when employment costs rise, employers may eliminate some fringe benefits such as training, paid insurance, transportation, or parking, so that the total compensation of workers does not rise even though wages increase. Employers may also raise their expectations of workers, including requiring greater work effort, punctuality, and less absenteeism in the workplace.</p></blockquote>
<p>His labor demand = labor supply model asserts that labor demand depends on the cost of the employee compensation package, while labor supply depends on the value to the worker.  Kash is arguing that an increasingly inefficient health care system has drives a wedge between the demand for labor curve and the supply of labor curve.  In other words, there is an adverse supply-side shock from unfortunate policy decisions that have let the health care system become even less efficient.  </p>
<p>The beginning point of my empirical comment comes from the paper by <a href="http://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2005/05/art1abs.htm">Joseph R. Meisenheimer</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Paid leave and health insurance benefits also compose large shares of employers’ total compensation costs, with each type of benefit accounting for 6.5 percent of the total cost in December 2003. Increases in health insurance costs have received considerable attention in recent years from both employers and workers. From December 2002 to December 2003, the Employment Cost Index for private-sector health insurance rose 10.5 percent (not adjusted for consumer price inflation). In the prior year, employers’ health insurance costs rose 10.2 percent.</p></blockquote>
<p>While a 20% nominal increase over two years is quite substantial, note that health insurance costs are only a portion of overall fringe benefits.  The following table breaks down real compensation costs (2000$ using BEA’s PCE deflator) into wages, health insurance costs, and other fringe benefits for 2002QI versus 2004QIV.  The reported Real wage increases were a mere 1.4%, while the increase in real health insurance costs was 17.2% even though workers may have received less insurance.  Also note, however, that the real cost of other fringe benefits appear to have increased by 8.3%.  Of course, higher costs are not necessarily an indication of greater value.  Kash’s inefficiency effect appears to be part of the growing wedge between real wages and real compensation cost and possibly a reason for us natural rate of employment-population ratio = 64% types to be more humble in our estimates of how large the Keynesian output gap is.</p>
<p>Alas, the Federal Reserve cannot control the ill-advised actions of our Congress and the White House (although a few of us wish its Chairman would refrain from campaigning for some of these ill-advised proposals).  Those who have to set monetary policy on the basis of whether we are near full employment might wish to ascertain whether the natural rate of the employment-to-population ratio is as high as 64% level I have suggested versus whether this natural rate has declined.  I doubt that the natural rate has declined to 62.7% but I could be wrong.  What I will continue to argue, however, is that looking at the unemployment rate as one’s guide is strange unless one is sure that the labor force participation rate would be once we reach full employment.</p>

                                <p>When are the folks at the <em>National Review</em> ever going to understand what this footnote in the BLS Household Survey report on employment means:</p>
<blockquote><p>Data affected by changes in population controls in January 2000, January 2003, January 2004, and January 2005.</p></blockquote>
<p>I ask because of who received the first “Jayson Award” from <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_luskin/luskin200506080914.asp">Donald Luskin</a>.  David M. Kiriazis (chairman of the economics department at Frostburg State University in Frostburg, Maryland) writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Unless nothing else changed, a decline in the unemployment rate could not possibly be explained “entirely” by people dropping out of the labor force. In fact, from June 2003 to Feb 2004, the labor force did decline from 147 to 146.5 million, but the number of unemployed declined from 9.2 to 8.2 million. Hence, the decline in the unemployment rate was mainly the result of more people finding jobs.  </p></blockquote>
<p>Interestingly, BLS’s reporting for the civilian noninstitutional population had it at 222.509 million for December 2003 but only 222.161 million for January 2004.  Unless one believes that the U.S. adult population declined by about 350 thousand in one month, Kiriazis’s calculations are suspect.  As far as the number of people finding jobs, the employment to population ratio fell from 62.3% in June 2003 to 62.2% in February 2004.  I hope Kiriazis understands our population tends to grow over time so that adding 125 thousand new jobs per month is not going to get us back to full employment very soon. </p>
<p>Since the Jayson Award is dedicated to someone who allegedly caught Krugman in a lie, let’s remember that he was referring to the labor force participation rate, which fell from 66.5% in June 2003 to 65.9% in February 2004.</p>

                                <p>In a comment to Kash&#8217;s post, <a href="http://economistsview.blogspot.com/">Mark Thoma</a> provided a link to this <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/08/opinion/08schumer.html?">op-ed</a> by Senators Charles Schumer and Lindsey Graham:</p>
<blockquote><p>DISMAYED by China&#8217;s failure to play fair on free trade, we have offered legislation to impose a tariff on Chinese exports to the United States if Beijing continues to keep the value of its currency, the yuan, artificially low compared with the dollar.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=3794">Stephen Hanke</a> makes a good case for opposing the tariffs but goes a bit astray with:</p>
<blockquote><p>Washington&#8217;s modern-day mercantilists believe trade deficits can be managed by altering exchange rates.</p></blockquote>
<p>Actually, it is the Chinese Central Bank managing the exchange rate, but Hanke sort of concedes the point arguing that allowing the yuan to float will likely have only a modest impact on relative prices.  <a href="http://macroblog.typepad.com/macroblog/2005/06/renminbi_revalu.html">David Altig</a> has more on this issue.</p>
<p><em>Update</em>: AB reader Elaine points out <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2005-06/08/content_3058361.htm">this story</a> from Xinhua, a Chinese business news organization:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Bush administration&#8217;s effort to increase pressure on China to overhaul its currency regime got less than rave reviews from Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and key central bankers from China, Europe and Japan. Greenspan disputed the contention of U.S. manufacturers that a revaluation of China&#8217;s yuan would make a significant impact on America&#8217;s soaring trade imbalances.</p></blockquote>
<p>Maybe we should also outsource the reporting of business news to China!</p>
<p><em>Update II</em>: <a href="http://economistsview.blogspot.com/2005/06/how-should-us-respond-to-chinas-peg.html">Mark Thoma</a> continues this discussion and refers to a comment from <a href="http://www.pkarchive.org/column/052005.html">Paul Krugman</a>.</p>

                                <p>I think there&#8217;s some validity to these concerns voiced by the head of Toyota:<br />
<blockquote> OSAKA, Japan (<a href="http://www.reuters.com/newsArticle.jhtml?type=topNews&#038;storyID=8730854">Reuters</a>) &#8211; The outspoken chairman of Toyota Motor Corp.  said on Wednesday he feared the possibility that U.S. policy could turn against Japanese auto makers if local giants such as GM and Ford were to collapse.</p>
<p>&#8220;Many people say the car industry wouldn&#8217;t revisit the kind of trade friction we saw in the past because Japanese auto makers are increasing local production in the United States, but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s that simple,&#8221; Hiroshi Okuda told a news conference. &#8220;General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. are symbols of U.S. industry, and if they were to crumble it could fan nationalistic sentiment. I always have a fear that that in turn could manifest itself in policy decisions,&#8221; he said, speaking as the head of the nation&#8217;s biggest business lobby, the Japan Business Federation.</p></blockquote>
<p>One likely policy change that I could imagine in the face of a potential collapse of GM or Ford would be a government bailout along the lines of the Chrysler bailout.  But I think that Okuda was referring to other types of &#8220;policy changes&#8221; &#8211; e.g. tariffs and quotas on Japanese cars, or even on other Japanese goods.  Such trade protection would be of limited use in the car industry, since so many Japanese cars are now made in the US&#8230; but perhaps they would be combined with higher local (i.e. US) content rules as well.  Of course, a large fraction of Ford, GM, and Chrysler cars are produced outside of the US as well&#8230;</p>
<p>Most worrying of all, however &#8211; and not at all out of the question if a GM or Ford fails &#8211; might be the imposition of across-the-board import tariffs by the Congress.  Such import tariffs would do nothing to help the US current account deficit, but they <em>would</em> help US firms that compete with imports, while at the same time reducing economic growth both at home and abroad&#8230;</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/frum/frum-diary.asp">Frum</a> argues that Africa does not need financial assistance but might benefit from free trade within the Western Hemisphere:</p>
<blockquote><p>African aid relief is the same. Jeffrey Sachs may imagine that he knows how much it will cost to pull Africa from poverty, but almost nobody outside the UN apparatus and the world of pop culture believes him … Meanwhile, there is something practical that can immediately be done to fight poverty right on America&#8217;s doorstep: Pass the embattled Central American Free Trade Initiative through Congress. But because CAFTA is premised on the unglamorous idea that poverty will be defeated by work and trade, not guilt-induced donations, none of its advocates have ever picked up a guitar in their life. </p></blockquote>
<p>Who to believe – “an internationally renowned economist” (Frum’s words) – or someone who confuses Latin America with Africa?  OK – Frum’s concern seems to be poverty in Latin America but free trade is not a sufficient condition for addressing abject poverty.  If Frum spent less time <a href="http://www.commentarymagazine.com/article.asp?aid=11906073_1">criticizing</a> Sachs and more time actually reading what Sachs has written, maybe he’d understand.  And yes, $0.7 billion in new U.S. aid is a far cry from sufficient or being generous.</p>

                                <p>Via <a href="http://www.tpmcafe.com/story/2005/6/7/10421/39349">bgreer</a> comes this <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/06/AR2005060601715_pf.html">Washington Post</a> story:</p>
<blockquote><p>For the past three years, the Air Force has described its $30 billion proposal to convert passenger planes into military refueling tankers and lease them from Boeing Co. as an efficient way to obtain aircraft the military urgently needs. But a very different account of the deal is shown in an August 2002 internal e-mail exchange among four senior Pentagon officials. &#8220;We all know that this is a bailout for Boeing,&#8221; Ronald G. Garant, an official of the Pentagon comptroller&#8217;s office, said in a message to two others in his office and then-Deputy Undersecretary of Defense Wayne A. Schroeder. &#8220;Why don&#8217;t we just bite the bullet,&#8221; he asked, and handle the acquisition like the procurement of a 1970s-era aircraft &#8211; by squeezing the manufacturer to provide a better tanker at a decent cost? &#8220;We didn&#8217;t need those aircraft either, but we didn&#8217;t screw the taxpayer in the process,&#8221; Garant added, referring to widespread sentiment at the Pentagon that the proposed lease of Boeing 767s would cost too much for a plane with serious shortcomings.</p></blockquote>
<p>Is leasing more efficient than purchasing?  I guess that depends on how much the annual lease payment is relative to the market price for the old aircraft that was converted into a refueling tanker.  Of course, the most efficient thing would have been to avoid paying Boeing anything for equipment that was apparently not needed.</p>
<p><strong><em>Update</em></strong>: The financing of this lease deal has an Enron-like <a href="http://www.usnews.com/usnews/biztech/articles/030908/8boeing.htm">special purpose entity</a> flavor to it:</p>
<blockquote><p>The tanker deal isn&#8217;t like most projects, in which the military buys what it needs. It is structured as a lease because the Pentagon didn&#8217;t have enough money to buy both new tankers and expensive new fighter planes. Boeing, for its part, didn&#8217;t want to lease the planes directly to the Air Force &#8211; that would have put too much debt on its books. So the company and the Air Force plan to set up a &#8220;special purpose entity&#8221; to serve as middleman in the transaction. It will collect money from outside investors, use the funds to buy the planes, and then rent the tankers to the Air Force. The result: Boeing gets to book the sale it wants and the Air Force gets its lease. Such complicated financing was alien to Air Force officials. Boeing&#8217;s documents make clear that in crafting the financing plan, the Air Force played student to its contractor. &#8220;The USAF clearly does not understand financing and has asked for our help to educate them (in layman&#8217;s terms),&#8221; wrote Robert Gordon, the vice president of Boeing Capital Corp., in an E-mail message in December 2001. Indeed, Gordon noted, an Air Force general &#8220;made a special comment to thank Boeing for all its work over the past months to try and help this leasing proposal make sense&#8221; to the government. Investigators with the Commerce Committee, however, are not as awestruck. They are examining the financial vehicle that&#8217;s the linchpin of the deal. &#8220;It&#8217;s an Enron-like entity,&#8221; says McCain. For one thing, U.S. News finds, there is a built-in conflict of interest in the arrangement because, documents indicate, it gives Boeing oversight of its own deal. Boeing and the Air Force have sold the deal to Congress as a way to save money, but lease terms mean it&#8217;s impossible to say today how much the government will pay tomorrow. </p></blockquote>
<p>So we elect an MBA President and this is how the government does business?</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Greenspan made <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/2005/20050606/default.htm">some remarks</a> about the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/06/long-term-interest-rate-mystery.html"><em>Interest Rate Mystery</em></a> during a conference yesterday in Beijing.  Slightly disconcertingly, none of the prevailing theories as to why long-term rates are so low right now are convincing to him&#8230; so he&#8217;s left admitting that he doesn&#8217;t really have an explanation for it.<br />
<blockquote>The pronounced decline in U.S. Treasury long-term interest rates over the past year despite a 200-basis-point increase in our federal funds rate is clearly without recent precedent&#8230;</p>
<p>In March of this year, market participants&#8230; bid up long-term rates, but as occurred last year, forces came into play to make those increases short lived. But what are those forces? Clearly, they are not operating solely in the United States. Long-term rates have moved lower virtually everywhere. Except in Japan, rates among the other foreign Group of Seven countries have declined notably more than have rates in the United States.</p></blockquote>
<p>So exactly why does Greenspan say that none of the prevailing theories explain the mystery?  Here&#8217;s the summary:
<ol>
<li><em>Low long-term rates signal expectations of future economic weakness.</em>  Perhaps this is part of the story, but Greenspan&#8217;s not convinced: &#8220;periodic signs of buoyancy in some areas of the global economy have not arrested the fall in rates.&#8221;</li>
<li><em>Pension funds are scrambling to make up for unfunded liabilities by dumping money into long-term bonds.</em>  This explanation also seems insufficient: &#8220;world demographic trends are hardly news, and recent adjustments to funding shortfalls do not seem large enough to be more than a small part of a complete explanation.&#8221;</li>
<li><em>Asian central bank (CB) accumulation of dollar assets has pushed down long-term yields.</em>  Greenspan finds this only a partial explanation: &#8220;given the depth of the market for long-term Treasury instruments, the Federal Reserve Board staff estimates that the effect of foreign official purchases has been modest. Furthermore, such purchases seem an implausible explanation of why yields on long-term <em>non</em>-U.S. sovereign debt instruments are so low.</li>
<li><em>Economic integration has reduced worldwide inflation expectations and, through increased international capital flows, increased the pool of savings going toward long-term debt instruments.</em>  Because this phenomenon is not new to the last year, Greenspan is again unconvinced: &#8220;Although this explanation contributes to an understanding of the past decade, I do not believe it explains the decline of long-term interest rates over the past year despite rising short-term rates.&#8221;</li>
</ol>
<p>So what&#8217;s his conclusion?<br />
<blockquote>The economic and financial world is changing in ways that we still do not fully comprehend. Policymakers accordingly cannot always count on an ability to anticipate potentially adverse developments sufficiently in advance to effectively address them.</p></blockquote>
<p>No, this isn&#8217;t a terribly reassuring comment from the world&#8217;s most important central banker, but at least it&#8217;s honest.  Personally, I find theories #2 and #4 completely unconvincing as well, since those both describe long-term trends, not things that have changed in the past 12 months.  So I suppose I&#8217;d guess that forces #1 and #3 may be acting together, each contributing part of the explanation.  </p>
<p>Let me mention one possibility worth thinking more about in defense of theory #3 in particular: if long-term bonds of the US and other countries are fairly good substitutes for each other, and if Asian CB purchases of US bonds are driving down US interest rates, then this would also be expected to indirectly drive down interest rates in other countries by inducing private capital flows into non-US government bonds.  Of course, in order to have a significant effect on worldwide long-term rates the flows from Asian CBs would have to be sizeable compared to the <em>worldwide</em> bond market, not just compared to the US treasury market.  Five hundred billion dollars per year is a lot, but is it enough to move interest rates around the world?  Maybe.  But it&#8217;s a harder case to argue.</p>
<p>To be on the safe side, I think we should keep trying to come up with some other possible explanations for the <em>Interest Rate Mystery</em>&#8230; </p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>This question is not as easy to answer as it may first appear.  In working on various posts last week I came across an apparent contradiction in the official data on compensation: some series show it rising in real terms, while others show it barely able to keep up with inflation.  This discrepancy was also noted by a few readers, who deserve credit for their sharp eyes.</p>
<p>So I thought I’d take a bit of time to sort out these conflicting data series for myself.  Here’s what I found.  (A warning and apology here: what follows is a relatively econ-geeky post about data details that many may find uninteresting&#8230; and I won&#8217;t be offended if you stop reading here.)</p>
<p>There are three major sources for time series data on earnings:  “Hourly Compensation,” from the BLS’s <a href="http://stats.bls.gov/lpc/home.htm">Productivity and Costs</a> (P&#038;C) dataset; the <a href="http://stats.bls.gov/ncs/ect/home.htm">Employment Cost Index</a> (ECI), which provides compensation series broken into the two sub-categories of wage/salary earnings and benefits; and the “Average Hourly Earnings” provided in the monthly employment report as part of the <a href="http://stats.bls.gov/ces/home.htm">Current Employment Statistics</a> (CES).  The following two charts show the behavior of these different series since 1990.  All series express hourly compensation rates in real terms.</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/comp_measures_fig1.jpg"></p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/comp_measures_fig2.jpg"><br />Note: all series are expressed in real (inflation-adjusted) terms using the PCE deflator.</p>
<p>What explains the sometimes substantial differences between these series?  There are several factors that contribute to the discrepancies, but let me point out the most important ones.  (For a more complete description of their differences see <a href="http://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2005/05/art1abs.htm">this paper</a> by Joseph Meisenheimer in the May 2005 issue of the <em>Monthly Labor Review</em>.) </p>
<p>First of all, two of the series – the CES series and the “ECI: wages and salaries only” series – do not include benefits that workers receive.  In the charts, those are the pink and green series.   Comparing the two ECI series shows that in the past three years or so, a significant gap has opened up between workers’ take-home pay and the amount of compensation that employers are paying, including benefits.  I would argue that this is directly attributable to the soaring cost of health insurance since about 2000.  Even if workers’ pay has been rising in real terms, nearly all of the increases have been going to pay higher health insurance premiums.</p>
<p>Secondly, the different series include and exclude different types of income and different types of workers.  The table below summarizes the different types of workers and income that each series excludes.</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/comp_measures_table1.jpg"></p>
<p>Finally, it should be noted that the ECI differs from the other series in that it comes from a survey that is intended to compare the wage rate in a particular <strong><em>job</em></strong> over time, not the wage rate of a person.  (The sample is 35,000 specific jobs across the country.) In other words, the survey compares what each job in the sample pays at one point in time to what it used to pay earlier.  Furthermore, in constructing the average wage rate across the economy, the ECI holds the number and types of jobs constant at the proportions in the base year (which I believe was just changed from the year 1990 to the year 2000).  What this means is that the ECI will not accurately reflect how a change in the composition of jobs in the economy might affect average wages.</p>
<p>Each of the series thus has its own strengths and weaknesses, and there’s no right answer as to which series is best.  They each tell us slightly different things, and the differences between them tell us still more.  For example, the surge in the P&#038;C measure during the period 1998-2001 probably reflects the large-scale adoption of payments through stock options.  The divergence between the wage/salary series and the total compensation series reflects the growing burden of health insurance.  And the recent rise of the P&#038;C measure compared to the ECI measure may reflect higher rates of compensation growth in for-profits firms compared to non-profit firms, or large increases in the compensation of self-employed business owners, or a change in the composition of jobs in the economy that the ECI hasn’t caught up with.</p>
<p>A note about income inequality: to the degree that some of the excluded groups (in the table above) may have different levels of income than others, the differences between the series may also suggest something about changes in income inequality.  A word of caution about that, however: if you want to find evidence of income inequality, I think there are much better measures (such as the <a href="http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/income.html">Census Bureau’s income data</a>) than these compensation measures.  There is too much else going on in these series to be able to safely attribute anything on the charts above to changes in income inequality.</p>
<p>So what’s my answer to the title question of this post?  Personally, if I had to choose just one series to use it would be the P&#038;C series.  In addition to being arguably the most complete series, it seems to have done the best job of matching my sense about how the economy has done over the past 20 years.  When asked, I think that most people would agree that income growth was indeed much lower during 2002 and 2003 than it had been during the late 1990s; the P&#038;C series bears that out, while the ECI series doesn’t.  Meanwhile, the CES series excludes benefits, which I think are a major part of the story today.</p>
<p>But let me reiterate the point that I have made several times now: just because real compensation is rising, that doesn’t mean that people are better off, particularly if nearly all of the gains are just going to paying higher health insurance premiums.  This data persuasively illustrates that nearly all of our real compensation gains today (and I do think we&#8217;re seeing them) are being eaten up by the monster that we call a health care system in the US.  Until we address the profound inadequacies of our health care system, this trend will only get worse.</p>

                                <p>Yale Economics Professor Dr. Shiller <a href="http://calculatedrisk.blogspot.com/2005/06/shiller-on-npr.html">expressed</a> concern on Friday that the bubble is spreading:<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;&#8230; the enthusiasm is infectious and it is starting to spread all over the place.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>How widespread is the housing bubble? Looking at the OFHEO House Price Index <a href="http://www.ofheo.gov/media/pdf/1q05hpi.pdf">data</a> released last week:</p>
<p><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/img/243/2888/640/bubble.jpg"><img src="http://photos1.blogger.com/img/243/2888/320/bubble.jpg" border="0"></a><br /><i>Click on graph for larger image.</i></p>
<p>NOTE: The OFHEO provides data for nine regions. <a href="http://www.ofheo.gov/media/pdf/censusdefinitions.txt">Here</a> are the states in each region. To make the graph more readable, I reduced the regions to six by combining NE/Mid Atlantic, West and East North Central, and West and East South Central. In each case the trends were very similar.</p>
<p>New England, Mid-Atlantic, Pacific and South Atlantic regions have been partying for some time.  In the last couple of years, the Mountain region has joined the festivities and the South Atlantic region has become one of the party&#8217;s sparkplugs.  Party On!  Now it appears the stodgy regions are starting to perk up.  I wouldn&#8217;t call it a full block party &#8230; yet.  But this is a wild one.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m definitely not looking forward to the hangover.</p>
