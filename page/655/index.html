                                                                    </div>

                                <p><a href="http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article19749.htm">This editorial</a> reminds us of the great increase in federal power regarding coercive force (also aid with guns).</p>
<blockquote><p>Section 1076 of the Defense Authorization Act of 2006 changed the name of the key provision in the statute book from “Insurrection Act” to “Enforcement of the Laws to Restore Public Order Act.” The Insurrection Act of 1807 stated that the president could deploy troops within the United States only “to suppress, in a State, any insurrection, domestic violence, unlawful combination, or conspiracy.” The new law expands the list of pretexts to include “natural disaster, epidemic, or other serious public health emergency, terrorist attack or incident, <em>or other condition</em>” – and such a “condition” is not defined or limited. </p>
<p>One might think that given the experience with the USA PATRIOT Act and many other abuses of power, Congress would be leery about giving this president his biggest blank check yet to suspend the Constitution. But that would be naïve. </p>
<p>The new law was put in place in response to the debacle of the federal response to Hurricane Katrina. There was no evidence that permitting a president far more power would avoid future debacles, but such a law provides a comfort blanket to politicians. The risk of tyranny is irrelevant compared with the reduction of risk of embarrassment to politicians. According to Washington, the correct response to Katrina is not to recognize the failure of relying on federal agencies a thousand miles away but rather to vastly increase the power of the president to dictate a solution, regardless of whether he knows what he is doing and regardless of whether local and state rights are trampled. </p>
<p>The new law also empowers the president to commandeer the National Guard of one state to send to another state for as many as 365 days. Bush could send the South Carolina National Guard to suppress anti-war protests in New Haven. Or the next president could send the Massachusetts National Guard to disarm the residents of Wyoming, if they resisted a federal law that prohibited private ownership of semi-automatic weapons. Governors’ control of the National Guard can be trumped with a simple presidential declaration. </p>
<p>Section 1076 had bipartisan support on Capitol Hill, including support from Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.), Sen. John Warner (R-Va.), Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.), and Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.), chairman of the House Armed Services Committee. Since the law would give the feds more power, it was very popular inside the Beltway. </p>
<p>On the other hand, every governor in the country opposed the changes. Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, warned on September 19, 2006, that “we certainly do not need to make it easier for presidents to declare martial law.” Leahy’s alarm got no response. Ten days later, he commented in the Congressional Record, “Using the military for law enforcement goes against one of the founding tenets of our democracy.”</p></blockquote>
<p>(Italics mine)</p>
<p>A lot of people are very selective about what they see as government coercion and as justifiable intervention, whether it be taxes, policing, spying, financial regulations, school.  In any economic or government model and/or policy, the questions need answering that eventually affect our personal lives.  Many form their arguments around a &#8216;big or small&#8217; hypotheses, but also there appears a lot of variablity about what areas are subject to the notion of &#8216;big or small&#8217;, or &#8216;centralized or diversified&#8217;.</p>
<p>In our discussions we tend to fragment these arguments as if they are not connected to each other.  I fail to see how a liberal like me and a National Rifle member could disagree that this form of possible coercion is wrong.  So why are we quiet?<br />End</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>The Senator from South Carolina has decided to lie to his <a href="http://greenvilleonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080415/OPINION/80415023/1004/NEWS01">constituents</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In 2001 and 2003, President Bush brought forward a tax relief package designed to reduce the burden on taxpayers &#8230; It was the right medicine for an ailing economy and the results were clear. By lowering taxes, the federal government spurred economic development and actually collected more in tax revenue &#8230; I believe some of the uneasiness taxpayers feel today about the economy is driven by concerns they are going to be hit with huge tax increases when the tax cuts expire.</p></blockquote>
<p>So many lies – so little time.  The 2001 and 2003 tax shifts did not lower the long-term tax burden – it only shifted it to the future.  And the notion that these tax “cuts” (really shifts) lead to a surge in economic growth such that we collected more in taxes than we would have without these tax “cuts” is something no economist believes.  OK – Lawrence Kudlow believes in the fairy tale of the Laugher curve but Kudlow is not an economist.  </p>
<p>But let’s tackle the last one of these whoppers.  Graham is suggesting that the only reason why aggregate demand is slipping as consumers are rational forwarding looking types who realize that the reversal of these tax “cuts” will lower their lifetime income, which is impacting their consumption today.  I have two problems with this nonsensical statement.  First of all – rational consumers in this lifecycle model of consumption that Graham is implicitly appealing to know that the 2001 and 2003 tax bills were only shifts in the tax burden and not reductions in it.  So by his logic – consumption demand was never impacted by these tax bills.  Secondly, anyone remotely familiar with the GDP data know that it has been <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/us-housing-starts-down-119/story.aspx?guid=%7B0727F6F2-3FE5-436A-8E05-9797E428E321%7D&#038;siteid=bnb">residential investment</a> that has collapsed.  </p>
<p>But let’s say that reversing the fiscal irresponsibility implicit in those tax “cuts” that Senator Graham so cherishes does reduce consumption and thereby increases national savings over the long-run.  I guess the Senator thinks this is bad news for long-term growth as he thinks less savings and investment is the key to making our economy “competitive in the global economy”.  Seriously – why do we send to the Senate people that are so utterly incompetent at economics?</p>

                                <p>Since I&#8217;ve been criticized for critiquing other people&#8217;s tax proposals without putting forward my own, I figured I&#8217;d start writing some posts with my thoughts on the subject.  I&#8217;m going to start, here, in this post, by laying out what I think is by far the single most important thing, the sine qua non without which a tax system can only be the dysfunctional mess we see before us today.</p>
<p>Now, regular readers know I&#8217;m a numbers guy, but in the end, I think the numbers &#8211; people (or corporations) making X a year should pay Y% &#8211; are just details.  Sure, they&#8217;re important details, but the system doesn&#8217;t live or die based on whether tax rates are too high or too low.  The top marginal rate was 91% every year of JFK administration.  (And because it bears repeating, Kennedy did not cut taxes.  LBJ invoked JFK&#8217;s name to get tax cuts in 1964.)  If that isn&#8217;t too high, its hard to imagine what is, and yet, Kennedy <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2009/sheets/hist07z1.xls"> paid down the debt as a percentage of GDP</a> and oversaw comfortably faster growth in real GDP per capita than Reagan or Clinton.   The recession in 1990, on the other hand, began at a time when the top marginal tax rates were at their lowest since 1931, and we all remember what  happened to debt as tax rates fell between 1981 and 1990.</p>
<p>So if it isn&#8217;t numbers, and rates, what is it?   Simple:  its the perception that there is some fairness, and that the rules apply to everyone.  Fairness does not mean everyone is treated exactly the same; when the ship goes down, maybe everyone fights for a spot on the lifeboat, but if there&#8217;s cellphone video of a person pushing a child, expectant mother, or a handicapped person off the raft to save himself, that person will be a pariah forever, everywhere.  Even in this dog eat dog world, we still believe in &#8220;pick on someone your own size.&#8221;  And as to rules applying to everyone &#8211; for the remaining spots on the lifeboat, for those that do not go automatically to the children or expectant women &#8211; we&#8217;re willing to tolerate lines, maybe a lottery, or even a free for all, but we aren&#8217;t willing to tolerate a person shooting their way on board.  Again, video of such behavior would make a person a pariah upon his return&#8230; though apparently some groups do tolerate <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/01/politics/campaign/01CHEN.html?ei=5007&#038;en=1c0259e620183dd6&#038;ex=1398830400&#038;adxnnl=1&#038;partner=USERLAND&#038;adxnnlx=1208347830-j3FEPG4jbamVymmBAxvBRQ">such people</a>.</p>
<p>When it comes to a tax system, most people are willing to allow the poor &#8211; the equivalent of the children and expectant mothers and the handicapped people on a lifeboat &#8211; to be given a step up.  Most people are incensed when they hear of situations geared specifically to benefit those with means and everyone else.  A tip to folks on the right &#8211; putting a lower marginal tax on capital rather than the sweat of one&#8217;s brow also qualifies.  Most people have to work for a living, and while you can talk about how such a tax scheme would benefit people who saved and scrimped their whole lives too, even those who saved and scrimped recognize that Paris Hilton benefited from this scheme from day her parents&#8217; accountants took care of her first first tax filing.</p>
<p>And there is one more unfairness, perhaps the hardest one to deal with.  Long ago and far away, I once dated a girl for a while whose father owned a textile company.  His wife and kids were all officers of the company, even as children, apparently.  On their sixteenth birthday, each of the kids got a luxury vehicle&#8230; which was a company expense, as was the gasoline, insurance, and many of their meals.  Folks on the right like to pretend that this isn&#8217;t going on, but I think most people know it is pretty widespread among the class of people who can afford good accountants. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure how to cure the problem of crazy-high business expenses and similar gaming of the system, except to say this&#8230;  we need the laws to mean something.  Which doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean more auditing and investigation.  Perhaps it does, but that would be meaningless without a stick.  In other words, what is needed is increased punishment for offenders.  Significant jail time for all involved, including the enablers (i.e., attorneys, accountants, audit directors).  If a person steals ten million dollars from the public coffers, treat it like you would someone stealing the same amount by holding-up liquor stores.  You have to rob a lot of liquor stores to get your hands on ten million dollars.  And if that goes some way toward ensuring that white collar criminals are no longer coddled relative to blue collar criminals, well, that would just strengthen the perception of fairness in the mind of most people, which is what we need for any system to actually work. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure when I&#8217;ll post on this topic again&#8230;  I have a few random thoughts and they take a while to congeal.  But expect more.<br />END</p>

                                <p>I’m likely going to regret this – but check out the picture in <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0408/9596.html">this Roger Simon discussion</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>When I saw a video of Hillary Clinton downing a shot of Crown Royal whiskey in Bronko’s Restaurant and Lounge in Crown Point, Ind., on Saturday night, I was delighted to see that she has finally learned what campaigning for president is all about. Last week, Barack Obama went to a private fundraiser in San Francisco and made some semi-coherent remarks about how people in small towns “get bitter” and “cling” to “guns or religion.” Clinton blasted Obama for being “elitist and out of touch.” “I was taken aback by the demeaning remarks Sen. Obama made about people in small-town America,” Clinton said. But Clinton’s statement was not as important as her downing that shot of whiskey.</p></blockquote>
<p>Oh my – might Team Obama use this picture to paint Senator Clinton as a drunk?  I doubt it as Team Obama has more class than the Rovians over at Team Clinton or Rove himself who repeated that <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/04/kristol-deduces-that-obama-is-godless.html">Marxist</a> BS.  </p>
<p>Hat tip to <a href="http://matthewyglesias.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/04/defining_populism_down.php">Matt Yglesias</a> who writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Indeed, even Matt Yglesias, certified pointy-headed elite, enjoys a celebratory shot or two every now and again. Meanwhile, a little birdie told me a lot of working class protestant church folk are teetotalers. But who am I to correct Roger Simon, who doubtless has so much working class cred that wine bottles spontaneously combust in his presence.</p></blockquote>
<p>But once we all sober up – weren’t there some real issues in this Presidential campaign?</p>
<p>Update: Leave it to the <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2008/04/15/fox-news-anchor%E2%80%99s-son-asks-why-hillary-is-%E2%80%98hitting-the-sauce%E2%80%99">son of a Faux News flak</a> to ask:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Do you think she’s finally resorted to hitting the sauce just because of some unfavorable polling?”</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/04/15/memories-of-the-nixon-ford-administration">Paul Krugman</a> provides a chart of the nominal price of good, that is, the PPI Index for Crude Foodstuffs and Feedstuff using <a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/categories/31">this handy source</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>This isn’t the first time we’ve had a worldwide surge in food prices. There was a huge price rise in 1972-1974 — bigger, in percentage terms, than the current spike … That price spike proved temporary — although it wreaked terrible havoc at the time (a million people may have died in the Bangladesh famine of 1974). In real terms, food got steadily cheaper over the next quarter century.</p></blockquote>
<p>Since Paul mentioned the relative price of good, I decided to take the PPI for food relative to the PPI for all commodities.  Our graphs show this ratio (index = 1 for 1982) for the 1969 to 1978 period as well as for the period from 1997 to today.  The first graph shows the 1972-74 spike, which did prove temporary as the relative price returned to its 1969 level, which our graph shows to be around 1.2 per our choice of index.  Our second graph starts off with the index near 0.9 confirming Paul’s statement that the relative price of good declined over time.  Relative prices continued to decline almost reaching an index of 0.7 during the summer of 2000.  Since then, relative prices have been rather volatile.  In fact, our index for March 2008 is not as high as the index for the spring of 2004.  </p>
<p>Then again – our graphs are relying on U.S. producer price indices, which may not be the most reliable means for capturing the relative price of good for other nations.  But even if it were, the message is that any efficiency gains in the production of good since 1997 are not currently being reflected in the price to consumers.</p>

<blockquote><p>NAPOLITANO: Hey Sen. Lieberman, you know Barack Obama, is he a Marxist as Bill Kristol says might be the case in today’s New York Times? Is he an elitist like your colleague Hillary Clinton says he is?<br />LIEBERMAN: Well, you know, I must say that’s a good question. I know him now for a little more than three years since he came into the Senate and he’s obviously very smart and he’s a good guy. I will tell ya that during this campaign, I’ve learned some things about him, about the kind of environment from which he came ideologically. And I wouldn’t…I’d hesitate to say he’s a Marxist, but he’s got some positions that are far to the left of me and I think mainstream America.</p></blockquote>
<p>No Joe – it was a pathetic question.  Sure you and Senator Obama disagree on a few things.  After all, he was opposed to that stupid decision to invade Iraq.  You know – the one you still support.  Could someone please tell me why on earth did Al Gore pick Lieberman to be on his ticket in 2000?</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2008/04/lieberman-on-th.html">Andrew Sullivan</a> weighs in on Lieberman’s interview asking him what are those far-left opinions:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m curious as to what those positions might be. I presume an opposition to permanent occupation of Iraq is not now some function of Marxism. Tax rates at the Clinton levels? Cap-and-trade? What actually does Lieberman mean by this?</p></blockquote>
<p>Now THAT’s a good question!</p>

<p>The great photographer Walker Evans and the writer Philip Agee were employed to document the lives of the rural South in 1937, which became the book “Let Us Now Praise Famous Men.”  It documented the lives of three sharecropper families in northern Alabama at that time.  They had been warned by the landowners that Evans and Agee were communists sent by Franklin Roosevelt, so it took them some time to secure the words and images of the people they were supposed to describe.</p>

<p>In light of the Obama word “bitterness” and the Angry Bear discussion on the topic this weekend, I took the opportunity to ask my wife’s nephew (let’s call him Zachariah) a few questions last evening.  He’d stopped by to hunt wild turkey in the woods behind our house and in our neighbor’s field at sunset.  Zach’s face resembles the man in the Walker Evans photo, above.</p>
<p>Zach is an engineer who commutes 120 miles roundtrip to Nashville to work; has two kids, is more or less a fundamentalist protestant, with parents more liberal than himself.  He’s unhappy his kids will have to move away to get good jobs, and wishes he didn’t have to commute himself, but all the factories are disappearing in the county.  He has no faith in Washington politicians to improve our economy or our lives.  He dislikes “socialized medicine” but is glad his father could get Medicare coverage for a serious cancer discovered last year, and has no health insurance for his own family from his present company.  He pays $12,000 a year for health insurance. </p>
<p>His two brothers both have families, factory jobs, but no health insurance coverage either.  Both of them complain about illegal immigrants flooding the market and depressing wages in their two small factories.  Their bosses constantly remind them they can be replaced cheaply.  Zach worries about their prospects if they lose their jobs, since they don’t have the education he does.</p>
<p>I asked him if he was bitter, and he thought about it, and nodded but wouldn’t elaborate.  He said after his dad got sick, and insurance salesman in his town (population 1,500) had started coming around to sell his parents an annuity in exchange for their life savings, and asked what we thought about it.  We told him it was expensive, and a poor choice for most old people.  Being OldVet, I pointed out how insurance salesmen had remade themselves into Financial Advisors in rural towns in order to get greater commissions off confused old people.  He expressed some real disgust and promised to warn his parents against being hustled.</p>
<p>Zach’s dad is much more liberal then himself, and he said his dad thought Democrats should be easily winning the discussion over the economy and the Iraq war, but were wasting their breath attacking each other.  The father is gloomy and resigned to another term with McCain, whom the dad calls “an ignorant man” and a “warmonger.”  Zach’s mother voted for Mrs. Clinton in the primary, but now favors Mr. Obama, who she feels is more in tune with people who are struggling.  She thinks no black and no woman can be elected in the South, however.  The father and mother both credit (a) economic disappointments and (b) Rush Limbaugh and the constant stream of divisive insinuations he puts out as big factors in rural conservatism.</p>
<p>Zach is conservative, or believes he is.  He said it’s because big city politicians and Washington politicians don’t like rural people.  I asked why that was so, and he said probably because they lived in structured urban environments, worked paperwork jobs, and had little attachment to the fields and the wide spaces and the forests of this country.  He pointed out that the rural South is the most American part of America, meaning the least changed by successive waves of immigration in the last century.  He said if rising incomes had come to rural areas it might have been a different matter.  Manual workers get $2 to $5 an hour less for the same work than they did five years ago, in his estimation.</p>
<p>That’s the report – and the political challenge – from rural Tennessee.</p>

<p>The best laid schemes o&#8217; Mice an&#8217; Men, Gang aft agley,&#8221; Robert Burns.</p>
<p>Justifying staying with the escalation, Iraqi and Afghanistan surge scams.</p>
<p>&#8220;The gains&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..should not be allowed to unravel.&#8221; Robert Gates C-SPAN 10 Apr 2008</p>
<p>One of the Kagans demands that withdrawal advocates have to prove the impossible: that the vague bad things that might happen when the US withdraws from Iraq, how fearsome and frightening, are not more costly than continuing the expensive, bloody war with no strategy and no prospects of achieving anything.</p>
<p>Does Kagan write for Gates?</p>
<p>This is common to how D0D excuses worthless weapon system projects where the money is continually wasted because if the useless weapon is not delivered the consequences will be &#8220;bleak&#8221;. So, like Iraq and Afghanistan, the taxpayers&#8217; money is shoveled into money pits the results are accepting things that do not work, cost too much and break too often. Good thing we do not suffer the bleakness of not buying the useless junk!</p>
<p>Fearsome consequences like shutting down an inept engineering houses are &#8220;bleak&#8221;.</p>
<p>It is as if you have to &#8216;prove the money should not be spent&#8217; as opposed to proving the outcome is worth the taxpayers&#8217; money.</p>
<p>This is opposite decent business and economic decision theory. You do not send good money after bad.</p>
<p>See of &#8220;Mice and Economics&#8221; Dan Seligman, Forbes Magazine Aug 1998, explanatory note <a href="http://www.maxvalue.com/tip041.htm">here</a>.</p>
<p>Another foundation of the culture of waste in industrial complex waste.</p>
<p>Justify war and the tools of war with faulty economic logic. </p>
<p>The company engineering departments and the Army may as well whittle beaks with your social security trust fund. </p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>On the <a href="http://www.kiplinger.com/businessresource/summary/archive/2008/trade-morici.html">Kiplinger Business Resource Center</a> Peter Morici, former Chief Economist at the U.S. International Trade Center, says it all:</p>
<blockquote><p>The recession is a wake up call. Americans need to confront some false gods &#8212; free trade, gas guzzlers and Wall Street.<br />In the 1990s, the U.S. helped launch the World Trade Organization and opened trade with China. Americans were to import more T-shirts and TVs and sell more software and sophisticated services to a world hungry for U.S. know-how. That would move Americans into better paying jobs.<br />Unfortunately, the U.S. welcomed imports with more enthusiasm than China and other developing countries, who kept high tariffs and notorious regulatory barriers to purchases of Western products. America&#8217;s CEOs and bankers learned how to outsource just about everyone&#8217;s job but their own &#8212; radiologists and computer engineers joined textile workers and others among trade-displaced workers.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Since the last recession, imports have jumped nearly $1 trillion, while exports are up only about $650 billion, and the trade deficit now exceeds $700 billion. For most Americans, inflation-adjusted wages have stagnated or fallen, while corporate CEOs and bankers get fat on bonuses and can&#8217;t-lose stock options.<br />China is the biggest problem. It subsidizes foreign purchases of its currency, the yuan, by more than $460 billion a year, making Chinese products artificially cheap at Wal-Mart. The U.S. trade gap with the Middle Kingdom has swelled to $250 billion.<br />Mercantilist growth in China and elsewhere in Asia has pushed up global oil prices nearly fivefold in six years, and the U.S. oil deficit is now $350 billion and rising.<br />To raise our kids, finance a huge trade deficit and generally live beyond our means, Americans borrowed from foreigners.<br />Essentially, the banks wrote ever-more creative mortgages and extended excessive credit card and auto loans. The banks bundled those markers into highly complex bonds, designed to generate fat paydays for loan brokers and bank executives, and sold risk-laden securities to foreign governments, insurance companies, pension funds and wealthy investors.<br />When the worst of the bogus bonds collapsed, those backed by rising adjustable rate mortgages, the banks got stuck with billions of yet unsold bonds. Bear Stearns collapsed, and the Federal Reserve loaned the banks and Wall Street securities dealers $600 billion against shaky bonds on a 90-day revolving basis. That essentially socializes the banks&#8217; losses on bad bonds.<br />You have to love Ben Bernanke&#8217;s ideas about free trade and capitalism. If you are an autoworker and lose your job to Korean imports, as a good economist, he tells you to go to school and find another job. If you are a New York banker caught paying yourself too much and run short of foreign investors to fleece, he makes you a big loan.<br />Now foreign investors are nervous about all the money they have lent Americans and the integrity of U.S. banks. They are fleeing dollar investments for euro-denominated securities, gold, oil and just about anything sounder than the greenback.<br />Americans are forced to cut back, not just on purchases of cheap Chinese coffee makers, but also on products made in America. That pushes the economy into recession.<br />Digging out requires us to cut the trade deficit and clean up Wall Street. Simply put, we need to burn less gas, balance commerce with China and live within our means.<br />We can either let the price of gas double to force conservation or accept tougher mileage standards. Fifty miles a gallon by 2020, instead of the 35 currently planned, is achievable, but means more hybrids and lighter vehicles.<br />As long as China subsidizes the sale of yuan to Wal-Mart and other U.S. importers, the U.S. Treasury should tax dollar-yuan conversions. When China stops manipulating currency markets, the tax would stop. That would reduce imports from and boost exports to China, create new jobs in the U.S., raise U.S. productivity and workers&#8217; incomes and reduce the federal deficit.<br />Bernanke has given the banks a lot and received little in return. He should condition the Fed&#8217;s largesse on reforms at the big investment houses, even if that means lower pay for Wall Street big wigs.<br />Let the bankers try earning their money. Just like the rest of us. </p></blockquote>
