                                <p>Is Canada taking its cue from Big Brother?</p>
<p>According to a <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20070424.wdetaineereport0425/BNStory/Afghanistan/home">Globe and Mail</a> article, which quoted portions of a secret Canadian report,</p>
<blockquote><p>the Harper government knew from its own officials that prisoners held by Afghan security forces faced the possibility of torture, abuse and extrajudicial killing&#8230;</p>
<p>But the government has eradicated every single reference to torture and abuse in prison from a heavily blacked-out version of a report prepared by Canadian diplomats in Kabul and released under an access to information request.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>A comparison of the full text — parts of which were obtained by The Globe and Mail — with the edited version shows a consistent pattern of excising negative findings or observations from the report with positive ones left in.<br />There was no explanation for blacking out observations such as &#8220;military, intelligence and police forces have been accused of involvement in arbitrary arrest, kidnapping extortion, torture and extrajudicial killing.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Another portion that is blacked out reads &#8220;widespread allegations of corruption and human-rights violations exist with respect to the Afghanistan National Police (ANP) and Ministry of Interior (MOI).&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>At issue: Did Canadian forces routinely turn over prisoners to Afghan officials, knowing full well what would happen, making them complicit parties in torture and murder?</p>
<p>Prime Minister Harper made a roundabout and peculiar <a href="http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/N25278062.htm">defense</a> of Canadian policy:</p>
<blockquote><p>Prime Minister Stephen Harper &#8212; who says his critics care more about the rights of the Taliban than about the 2,500 Canadian soldiers in Afghanistan &#8212; made it clear on Tuesday that the soldiers would continue to hand over detainees</p></blockquote>
<p>In November, according to CTVNN, a lawsuit will attempt to force the government to release publicly the unredacted report.</p>
<p>Reports of torture and extradition are becoming so routine that they numb the soul. It is becoming increasingly difficult for any country anywhere to claim the moral high ground. &#8220;Fighting for democracy, freedom, and human rights&#8221; becomes just an empty slogan.</p>
<p>How a country treats its enemies, no matter how despicable they may be, is the moral yardstick by which a country is measured.</p>

                                <p>No matter who &#8220;won.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anyone who knows the phrase &#8220;think at the margin&#8221;—with or without the differential calculus and comparative statics—would have predicted that the Bankruptcy Bill (a.k.a. The Ken Lewis Retirement Subsidy Act) would damage to the economy when it was least able to survive the damage.</p>
<p>What no one knew for certain was <a href="http://tpmcafe.talkingpointsmemo.com/2008/08/12/the_2005_chapter_11_amendments/">how much</a>:<br />
<blockquote>According to <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/content/aug2008/db20080811_680564.htm">[a BusinessWeek] article</a>, this year, 15 retailers with assets of $100 million or more have filed for Chapter 11 protection, and almost all that filed in the first three months of the year have rapidly liquidated. Compare that outcome with Professor Lynn LoPucki&#8217;s research showing that in the 20 years prior to 2005, only 41% of the 94 retailers that filed for bankruptcy went out of business, with Kmart, Winn-Dixie Stores, and Macy&#8217;s being among those that emerged successfully from the process.</p></blockquote>
<p>The difference between retail sales and banks is that there is no &#8220;Fed discount window&#8221; for retail.  Indeed, quite the opposite:<br />
<blockquote>All filers are covered by the new bankruptcy law, but the changes were particularly harsh on retailers. For companies that already are short of cash—and, in the current environment, unlikely to find new financing—these new provisions in the law can amount to a death sentence. &#8220;Liquidity is sucked out of the debtor in a way that it becomes hard to survive,&#8221; says Lawrence Gottlieb, chair of the bankruptcy and restructuring practice at New York law firm Cooley Godward Kronish, who has represented creditors&#8217; committees in the bankruptcies of Sharper Image and Linens &#8216;n Things.</p></blockquote>
<p>The idea of being able to borrow from the Fed is that that money then gets put back into circulation, supporting the economy (think &#8220;multiplier effect&#8221;).  Otherwise, it just becomes inflationary.  Which appears to be what is happening.</p>
<p>It was bad enough that consumers (most of whom file bankrutcy after health events, which may or may not be associated with a loss of employment) face a tougher row to hoe; the gaping holes that used to be large retail stores (think CompUSA) will be even more difficult to fill.</p>
<p>Many of the &#8220;mall owners, suppliers, and utility companies&#8221; who wanted the changes in the corporate bankruptcy bill made may be thinking of the old proverb: &#8220;Be careful what you wish for. You may get it.&#8221;</p>

                                <p>The most interesting presentation I saw at the AEA last January was Maccini and Yang&#8217;s discussion of the effect of rainfall on the health and growth of Indonesian babies.* It was subsequently discussed as <a href="http://papers.nber.org/papers/w14031">an NBER working paper</a>** by <a href="http://healthcare-economist.com/2008/06/12/are-wet-babies-healthy-babies/">Jason Shafrin</a>, and the thing that made it most interesting is that Maccini and Yang found an effect on female children, but not one on male children. </p>
<p>But that&#8217;s a developing economy.  Would the same type of thing happen in a developed nation?</p>
<p>Apparently, via <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2008/08/links-for-20-11.html">Mark Thoma&#8217;s links</a>, the answer is <a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2008-08/ifts-bda081108.php">yes</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>People who suffer from cardiovascular diseases at advanced ages may have reason to suspect that the cause of their illness lies far away &#8230; around the date of their birth. A team of European researchers reports that if economic conditions at the time of birth were bad, then this leads to a higher risk of cardiovascular mortality much later in life.</p></blockquote>
<p>The researchers used Danish twins born around the turn of the (19th into 20th) century as their baseline.  And the nature-nurture difference appears to be at the margin:<br />
<blockquote>The twin data come with an added bonus. They make it possible to check whether a twin pair&#8217;s health outcomes are more similar later in life if they were born under adverse conditions than if they were born under good conditions. It turns out that, indeed, they are more similar later in life if the starting position was bad. Conversely, if an individual is born under better conditions, then individual-specific factors dominate more. In short, individual-specific qualities come more to fruition if the starting position in life is better.</p></blockquote>
<p>The full paper is available <a href="http://ftp.iza.org/dp3635.pdf">here</a> (PDF).</p>
<p>*The reasoning for such a study seems fairly straightforward: babies are most affected in their earlier years, rainy seasons—especially in subsistence-farming areas—should tend to produce a better crop yield and therefore marginally more calories available to babies. So the alternative hypothesis should be that rainy seasons produce healthier children, as reflected in schooling accomplishments and height, among other things.<br />**[Free version <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~deanyang/papers/macciniyang_undertheweather.pdf">here</a>; PDF]</p>

                                <p>The gents at Capital Gains and Games—and soon, likely, the ma&#8217;am at EconMom—are in the throes of ecstasy (not necessarily the drug).  There are &#8220;bond vigilantes&#8221; on the horizon. <a href="http://capitalgainsandgames.com/blog/stan-collender/445/more-reasons-not-take-candidates-budget-proposals-too-seriously">Stan Collender</a>:<br />
<blockquote>The bond market &#8220;vigilantes&#8221; &#8212; the same people who forced the Clinton administration to propose and push for deficit reduction &#8212; are starting to say that the moon, stars, and planets may line up again in 2009 to force the next president to do the same thing.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://capitalgainsandgames.com/blog/pete-davis/446/candidates-budget-proposals-versus-bond-vigilantes">Pete Davis</a> (citing the <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601109&#038;sid=ayrMJ4R.bmLY&#038;refer=home">same Bloomberg article</a>):<br />
<blockquote>I fear that the next president and Congress may ignore the markets and enact expensive new tax and spending programs anyway.  We&#8217;ve been through this fight before in the 1980s.</p>
<p>Back then, Wall Street economist, Ed Yardeni, coined the term &#8220;bond vigilantes&#8221; back when Ronald Reagan ran the highest peacetime deficits in history.  Yardeni&#8217;s prediction of higher interest rates made him very well known among investors.  On May 29th, Ed issued a similar prediction&#8230;.</p>
<p>Hopefully, the next president will take a good look at President Clinton&#8217;s first year in office, 1993.  Robert Rubin convinced him to enact a strong deficit reduction program.  It built upon the even stronger deficit reduction of 1990 by President Bush 41, which cost him his second term.  In 1994, President Clinton lost control of Congress.  These courageous, but politically costly, actions by presidents of both parties made the 1990s the best decade for economic growth since the Second World War, and they also produced budget surpluses in Fiscal Years 1998 through 2001.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now, I&#8217;ll quibble whether &#8220;No nude Texans&#8221; cost GHWB a second term; he didn&#8217;t seem to want to be president, which is why I did not hesitate, the day before the election, to bet $10,000 on William Jefferson Clinton being elected in 1992.*  But there is no sign from the McCain camp of listening to this advice—and, unlikely his example, no indication of fiscal responsibility from the current Republican administration—so we have to wonder if Davis is serious in advocating that Obama try to be a one-term president with an opposition Congress for the second half. </p>
<p>But it is left to Don Pedro to <a href="http://econ4obama.blogspot.com/2008/08/stupidest-idea-of-day.html">tell the truth and Shame the Devil</a> [link added; sorry forgot earlier]:</p>
<blockquote><p>[Howard Gleckman] ominously raises the following as part of his argument:<br />
<blockquote>Holtz-Eakin would enjoy fiscal credibility in the financial markets. The bond vigilantes have not cared about deficits for years, but they tend to get interested when Democrats run the government. Just ask Bill Clinton. Today, they see Obama as little more than a big-government liberal with a good speech. This might show them he is more complex than that. [emphasis mine &#8211; klh]</p></blockquote>
<p>Gleckman is a former reporter for Business Week, and no doubt still runs in financial press circles. Funny how the press has almost never reported that the president should be worried about &#8220;credibility&#8221; with the bond markets while Bush was in the Oval Office. Funnier still how a prominent business reporter can imagine that Holtz-Eakin&#8211;who is pimping what must be the least credible set of tax and budget proposals ever offered in a presidential campaign&#8211;would bring said credibility. [italics mine &#8211; klh]</p></blockquote>
<p>Indeed, the Bloomberg article that Stan Collender and Pete Davis cite, but don&#8217;t bother to mention the title of, is &#8220;Bond Vigilantes Who Gave Bush a Pass May Ambush Obama or McCain.&#8221;</p>
<p>EconomistMom and the rest of the Concord Coalition are waiting in the wings, expecting them to do their bidding.</p>
<p>*The bet was vetoed by my boss at the time, I&#8217;m sad to say.</p>

<blockquote><p>I suppose if we are thinking about turning our country over to the second Carter term — or the first McGovern — it shouldn&#8217;t surprise anyone to see Russia go into its Aghanistan mode &#8230; or Czechoslovakia &#8230; or Hungary &#8230; or (as Roger reminds us) Georgia.</p></blockquote>
<p>Conservative <a href="http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2008/08/just-asking.html">Andrew Sullivan</a> mocks this stupidity but did he really have to make this claim?  </p>
<blockquote><p>Imagine that Bush is a Democrat (not that hard when you consider his fiscal record).</p></blockquote>
<p>I agree with the rest of his post but George W. Bush is a Republican as was Ronald Reagan who also presided over a large increase in the national debt.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>As I&#8217;m sure AngryBear readers know, Paul Krugman does not believe that the spot price of petroleum shot up due to speculation.  His argument is that the only way future expected prices can affect demand for crude or supply of refined products to final consumers is via inventory accumulation and inventories haven&#8217;t increased.  Also he argues that speculation can only affect the spot price if there is contango: that is a futures price above the spot price.</p>
<p>I was convinced.  Now I am not so sure.  The recent decline in the price of petroleum makes it a little bit harder for me to believe in a simpl supply and demand without speculation explanation (just a little bit harder so I won&#8217;t argue the semi hemi demi point).</p>
<p>There are many models in which prices do funny things.  One set includes customer market models &#8212; very implausible if the product is gasoline.  Another set is based on implicit collusion.  In this case, lets assume that the oil companies are, in fact, a cartel and enforce cooperation with threats of future retaliation.  The subgame perfect semi folk theorem suggests that a continuum of equilibria are possible in this case, which sure helps if one is trying to fit the data.</p>
<p>I am (as always) thinking as I type.  The semi model I have in mind is one in which </p>
<p>1) the oil companies buy crude on a thick duble auction type spot market with one worldwide price and close to perfect competition.</p>
<p>2) they refine crude and sell refined products (for simplicity assume that the only product is gasoline) subject to a capacity limit and, of course, demand.</p>
<p>3) they agree on a markup on marginal cost.  Firms which sell gasoline at a lower markup are punished in the future.  They choose the highest sustainable markup.</p>
<p>4) they agree on the highest sustainable markup and have rules restricting inventory accumulation and forward purchases of oil (key that).</p>
<p>The cartel will drive the price of gasoline up and the price of crude down.  The extent to which it can do this depends on the costs and benefits of deviation from the agreement, that is, the gains to a firm of suddenly selling gasoline cheaper than agreed given the spot price of crude and the costs to that firm of the wrost subgame perfect punishment strategy available to the cartel.</p>
<p>It is very important to my story that the firms agree on a markup (let&#8217;s say a price of gasoline as a function of the price of crude) and NOT on prices for gasoline or crude or quantities of crude bought or gasoline sold.</p>
<p>Update:  This is my second try.  My first try was mathematically wrong.  </p>
<p>The key issues are gains and costs from deviation from the agreed markup.  </p>
<p>I will assume that following deviation, firms switch to the non-collusive oligopolly solution (make it a cournot oligopoly) with a lower price of gasoline and a higher price of crude.  </p>
<p>If it took a long time for gasoline stations to change their posted price, an oil company with a chain of gas stations could &#8230; well this is silly.  </p>
<p>There are gains to deviation from the agreement if the other oil companies in the cartel have limited inventories of gasoline and either limited inventories of crude limited refining capacity limiting their ability to increase their supply of gasoline.   I assume that spare refining capacity is key to enforcement.  The idea is that shipping refining and distributing takes a while so firms don&#8217;t do it on the sly.  Spare refining capacity is key to the punishment phase but not to the deviation phase.  Limited spare refining capacity implies a low markup.  In particular, anticipated future refining capacity is the key (the punishment phase lasts a long time) so expectations of future demand are key.</p>
<p>The cost of deviation is that all firms in the future use all of their refinineries at capacity (and maybe build more).  </p>
<p>The benefit is dumping undesired inventories of gasoline on the market and an increase in the price of crude oil which is valuable if the company owns crude oil in the ground or in tanks or has bought crude oil futures beyond their needs for crude oil to refine.</p>
<p>A tight incentive compatibility constraint due to limited refining capacity implies a low markup and tight restrictions on inventories (of both gasoline and crude oil) and on futures positions.  </p>
<p>A low markup implies a high price of crude oil.  Also low inventories (required to maintain collusion) and limited refining capacity imply a high price of crude.  It is important that the collusive agreement allows firms complete freedom on the spot crude oil market.  The idea is that the price jumps around so much that any collusive agreement would be way to complicated to work tacitly.  </p>
<p>So low spare refining capacity implies low allowed inventories and futures purchases which implies fierce competition for crude oil (if a firm bids low it will have trouble keeping its refineries working and can&#8217;t make up later as it has limited spare capacity).</p>
<p>All is driven by forecasts of future demand which can bounce around as much as GNP forecasts.</p>

<blockquote><p>Reuters <br />updated 11:34 a.m. ET, Tues., July. 15, 2008 <br />VAZIANI, Georgia &#8211; One thousand U.S. troops began a military training exercise in Georgia on Tuesday against a backdrop of growing friction between Georgia and neighboring Russia.</p>
<p>Officials said the exercise, called &#8220;Immediate Response 2008,&#8221; had been planned for months and was not linked to a stand-off between Moscow and Tbilisi over two Russian-backed separatists regions of Georgia.</p>
<p>The United States is an ally of Georgia and has irritated Russia by backing Tbilisi&#8217;s bid to join the NATO military alliance.</p></blockquote>
<p>There are several ideas that ran through my head: (randomly)</p>
<p>1.  Are these troops out?  I know US trainers are still there, but the numbers are a lot smaller.  Are Israeli troops still there?</p>
<p>2.  This has an impact on the oil pipeline for sure.</p>
<p>3.  NATO membership for Georgia was postponed.  Does this action kill it for now? How committed is President Bush to THIS shining light of democracy?  Or Europe?</p>
<p>4.  How prepared are we?  In what way?</p>
<p>5.  Authoritarian regimes seem to be strutting their stuff as opposed to Islamo fascists.  Is this a sea change for the media to exploit?</p>

<blockquote><p>President Bush proposed a $2.4 trillion election-year budget Monday that would boost defense spending, redistribute funds among government programs, and cross out the $477 billion deficit entirely. </p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody likes making cuts, but the nation&#8217;s current rate of spending and the decreased tax revenues we&#8217;ve seen since implementing my tax cuts have created a deficit that we can&#8217;t afford to carry,&#8221; Bush said in a nationally televised address. &#8220;Someone had to have the vision, leadership, and courage to go in and erase that line altogether, no matter how unpopular and impossible that may be.&#8221; </p>
<p>According to the Congressional Budget Office, the $477 billion deficit is the country&#8217;s largest ever, easily topping the previous record of $290 billion in 1992. If the budget is approved, however, the deficit will roll down to $0.0 billion. </p>
<p>In the past, critics have accused the Bush Administration of responding to a mounting deficit and the ongoing recession with unsound fiscal policies like cutting taxes for the wealthy. Bush supporters say the deficit cut proves the wisdom of the president&#8217;s economic plan. </p>
<p>&#8220;Bush has taken a brave step, one that was long overdue,&#8221; Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-TN) said. &#8220;He has taken charge of the budget problem once and for all, simply by saying &#8216;The deficit stops here.'&#8221; </p>
<p>Faced with the difficult choice of either cutting government programs or raising taxes, Bush reportedly arrived at the radical new &#8220;deficit-cutting&#8221; solution late Sunday night, only hours before he was to announce his budget. </p>
<p>&#8220;I was staring at the figure for the deficit, and I decided that it simply could not stand,&#8221; Bush said. &#8220;It was too high. Something had to be done. But Americans have been taxed and taxed. I say &#8216;Enough taxes.&#8217; By my estimation, this historical crossing-out of the deficit will save American taxpayers millions, billions, and perhaps even bajillions of dollars.&#8221; </p>
<p>The president then turned to Section 14-D of the official budget document, where the federal government&#8217;s total expenditures, the GNP, and the difference between the two were listed. Using a black Sharpie, the president crossed out the third figure, eliminating it entirely. </p>
<p>Bush then held up the newly marked-up page and said, &#8220;My fellow Americans, I have solved the federal budget crisis.&#8221; </p>
<p>The budget is expected to pass through the GOP-controlled Congress with little or no opposition. </p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know why I didn&#8217;t have this idea before,&#8221; Bush said. &#8220;For years, we have tried to control the deficit by eliminating federal programs, lowering taxes for the rich, sending out checks to everybody, and God knows what else. None of us once thought to just draw a line through it.&#8221; </p>
<p>The Bush plan is not without critics. </p>
<p>&#8220;President Bush drew a line through the deficit, yes, and we commend him for that,&#8221; Sen. Blanche Lincoln (D-AR) said. &#8220;But that doesn&#8217;t solve the country&#8217;s budgetary problems. While he was at it, why didn&#8217;t he add several zeroes to the end of our GNP?&#8221; </p>
<p>Political pundits have been largely impressed by the visionary slash. </p>
<p>&#8220;Opinions vary as to what the long-term effects of the deficit cut will be,&#8221; New York Times columnist Paul Krugman said. &#8220;One thing, however, is certain: The growing federal deficit, a Gordian knot that for three years no amount of cutting taxes and spending money could unravel, has been sliced in two by the president&#8217;s bold, radical new take on the problem.&#8221; </p>
<p>A CNN/Gallup poll taken immediately after the president&#8217;s announcement showed that 67 percent of Americans support his decision to draw a black line through the deficit, and thereby eliminate it. </p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m tired of the tax-and-spend Democrats always talking about adding zeroes to the GNP,&#8221; said Henry Strom, 40, of Bakersfield, CA. &#8220;How about we cross out our debts and get our affairs in order before we start adding zeroes? We need to cut this deficit and stand firm against printing deficits in future budgets, as well.&#8221; </p>
<p>According to Bush&#8217;s political advisors, later this week, the president will declare that the U.S. has universal health care.</p></blockquote>
