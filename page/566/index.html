                                <p>A <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/09/public-and-private-health-care-spending.html">post</a> based on joint work with Tilman Tacke got 45 comments which is a lot for one of my posts.  Many were excellent.  One weak point is that people seem a bit obsessed with the USA.  The post discussed cross country regressions with 71 countries (The first comment started &#8220;Why only 71 countries?&#8221;).  The USA is just one data point and did not drive the result.</p>
<p>OK so now I will look at the USA in the context of the 71 other countries.  First, as we all know, the USA has an alarmingly high reported infant mortality rate given how rich we are (see table 1).  </p>
<p><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v296/rjw88/?action=view&#038;current=imusa.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v296/rjw88/imusa.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a></p>
<p>lnim is the natural logarithm of the infant mortality rate, lnpcgdp is the log of real per capita GDP corrected for purchasing power parity, year is the year infant mortality was measured, USA is an indicator for the USA.</p>
<p>The coefficient on the US indicator is statistically insignificant (this is just one observation of US infant mortality and we are alarmed because the pattern persists over time).  The point estimate states that the US infant mortality rate is 76.8% higher than one would expect given per capita real GDP and the year.  Is is possible to learn something about what is going on with simple OLS regressions of a cross section of 71 countries ?  If you want to decide the answer read on.</p>
<p>One possible explanation, which I can&#8217;t address, is that this happens because the US counts births as live births followed almost immediately by death when other countries count similar tragedies as still births or late miscarriages. </p>
<p>A very natural guess is that this has something to do with high inequality in the USA.  This guess shows that the obsession is with the USA compared to Europe and Japan.  Compared to the average country in our data set, the USA does not have huge inequality (the share of income going to the top quintile in the USA is 46% which is less than the average among the other countries &#8212; 47%.  US inequality is anomalously high compared to other rich countries, or, in other words compared to the expected level given the Kuznets curve.  In fact, controlling for income distribution by considering separately the log per capita income of different quintiles has almost no effect on the coefficient on the USA indicator (but it does explain why there are only 71 countries in the sample).</p>
<p>Now notice my personal obsession.  The coefficient on lnq5 (log per capita income of the fifth quintile) is positive and borderline significant.  This is a pattern that was found in the old data by uhm me, not found in data from the 80s and early 90s and now it&#8217;s BAAAACK ! But not as robust as it was in old data (very robust it was ah I remember). </p>
<p>see table 2</p>
<p>OK so what is it ?  We have some other variables related to infant mortality.  Let&#8217;s toss one in.  How about female obesity ?  The USA is, you know, the fattest country in the world.  This causes the coefficient to drop see table 3.</p>
<p>How about hiv prevalence &#8212; a bit high in the USA for a super rich country.  This causes a very small decrease in the coefficient (see table 4).</p>
<p><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v296/rjw88/?action=view&#038;current=tables234.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v296/rjw88/tables234.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a></p>
<p>How about public health care spending as a percent of GDP, the USA is a bit low compared to STATA&#8217;s guess, because the level is similar to that of other rich countries and the US is richer than other rich countries (except for Luxembourg which isn&#8217;t in the sample).</p>
<p>That gets the coefficient down to 0.33 slightly over half the original coefficient and corresponding to an increased risk of 40% of the predicted infant mortality rate.  See table 5.  </p>
<p><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v296/rjw88/?action=view&#038;current=table5.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v296/rjw88/table5.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a></p>
<p>So a few variables (really 2 as hiv prevalence doesn&#8217;t do much) account for about half of the mystery in an OLS sense.</p>

<p>A MODEST NOTE on the use of Present Value in Social Security propaganda</p>
<p>I should begin by saying that I have nothing against the use of  <br />present value (PV) calculations being used to make honest comparisons  <br />between various options across time.  What I am concerned with here  <br />is that they can be used to mislead the unwary.</p>
<p>Consider</p>
<p>The present value of 10 dollars 100 years from now at 3% real  <br />interest is 52 cents.  There are a number of traps in even this  <br />simple statement, but the one I want to deal with today is this:</p>
<p>I can buy dinner today at a cheap restaurant for 10 dollars.  Does  <br />that 52 cent present value mean I can go into a restaurant a hundred  <br />years from today and buy dinner for 52 cents?  Of course not.  What  <br />present value says is that if I take 52 cents today and invest it and  <br />get 3% over the rate of inflation for a hundred years I will have 10  <br />dollars and can buy dinner with it then.</p>
<p>Well, that&#8217;s nice.  But this is not the way we usually budget our  <br />groceries.</p>
<p>More to the point, when they tell you that the PV of your taxes, paid  <br />today, is more than the PV of the benefits you will receive in 40  <br />years&#8230; or that the PV of benefits a hundred years from now is less  <br />than the PV of benefits paid yesterday&#8230; they are relying on this  <br />optical illusion to make you think some great big huge horrible  <br />injustice or inequity is being committed.</p>
<p>The present value of that ten dollars a hundred years from now may be  <br />52 cents, but in a hundred years it will still cost 10 dollars for  <br />that dinner&#8230; remember these are real dollars, we have discounted  <br />inflation.</p>
<p>It would be nice if we could all set aside 52 cents today and not  <br />have to worry about finding enough for dinner in a hundred years.   <br />But we can&#8217;t.  In the first place, we have to buy dinner today&#8230; for  <br />all the family, including granny over there in the corner.  Forgotten  <br />but not dead.</p>
<p>In the second place, NO one can guarantee anything for the next 100  <br />years, much less an interest rate 3% above the rate of inflation.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why Social Security is pay-as-you-go.  Just like our daily bread.</p>

<p>Dueling Mooses &#8212;  Kristol tries to confuse the issue &#8212; FAIL!</p>
<p>William Kristol (NYT today) defends Palin as a VP pick.  Are we convinced?  Here, see what he says:<br />
<blockquote>Should voters be alarmed by a relatively young or inexperienced vice-presidential candidate? No. Since 1900, five vice presidents have succeeded to the presidency during their term in office: Teddy Roosevelt in 1901, Calvin Coolidge in 1923, Harry Truman in 1945, Lyndon Johnson in 1963, and Gerald Ford in 1974. Teddy Roosevelt took over at age 42, becoming our youngest president, and he’s generally thought to have proved up to the job. Truman was V.P. for less than three months and had been kept in the dark by Franklin Roosevelt about such matters as the atom bomb — and he’s generally thought to have risen to the occasion. Character, judgment and the ability to learn seem to matter more to success as president than the number of years one’s been in Washington.</p></blockquote>
<p>All right, Bill.  You want to compare Palin to the five VPs who stepped up to the plate since 1900?  (That&#8217;s five out of 17 presidents &#8212; pretty good odds for her to succeed to the presidency, don&#8217;t you think?)</p>
<p>The five VP presidents took office in the wake of two assassinations, (McKinley, JFK), one impeachment (Nixon), and two natural deaths (FDR, Harding,  although some believe that Harding, facing newly revealed scandals, may have been poisoned).  Truman was picked to run as VP expressly because, leading up to his fourth winning run for the presidency, FDR was known by the party to be very ill.</p>
<p>How well did the five do?  In historians &#8220;best and worst&#8221; presidents surveys, they ranged (over ten surveys)</p>
<blockquote><p>Teddy Roosevelt   3-7th  best president ever<br />Harry Truman   5 &#8211; 9<br />Lyndon Johnson   10 &#8211; 18<br />Gerald Ford   23 &#8211; 32<br />Calvin Coolidge   23 &#8212; 33</p></blockquote>
<p>Roosevelt and Harry Truman had the most gritty experience in war, the kind of experience that people often don&#8217;t survive.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;[In WWI} Truman was chosen to be an officer, and then battery commander in an artillery regiment in France. His unit was &#8230; known for its discipline problems.  During a sudden attack by the Germans in the Vosges Mountains, the battery started to disperse; Truman ordered them back into position using profanities that he had &#8220;learned while working on the Santa Fe railroad.&#8221;  Shocked by the outburst, his men reassembled and followed him to safety. Under Captain Truman&#8217;s command in France, the battery did not lose a single man.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Johnson and Ford served honourably but without any fireworks.  Coolidge never served.</p>
<p>This column wasn&#8217;t even an argument.  Kristol tries the old bait and switch here, choosing to compare 44 year old Palin to the youngest president ever in terms of their age, and then implying that she might have the qualities and perhaps experience needed to steer the ship of state through the rough waters ahead.  But compare what they did in those forty or so years.  Kristol especially mentions Teddy Roosevelt, the youngest oops president of the five.  So let&#8217;s look at the Colonel, shall we?  Before his election as Vice President&#8212;<br />
<blockquote>&#8212; He graduated Phi Beta Kappa and magna cum laude from Harvard (in Law)<br />&#8212; age 24, he wrote the definitive  book &#8216;The Naval War of 1812&#8217;,  standard history for two generations. <br />&#8212; age 24 the president appointed him to the United States Civil Service Commission, where he served for 13 years.  In his term, he vigorously fought the spoilsmen and demanded the enforcement of civil service laws.<br />&#8212; was married and widowed before age 27, was remarried to his childhood sweetheart when he was 30. Six children.<br />&#8212; built a cattle ranch in the Dakota Territories which succumbed like many others to the disastrous 1887 winter.[1]<br />&#8212; prepared for and advocated war with Spain<br />&#8212; organized and helped command the 1st U.S. Volunteer Cavalry Regiment&#8230; during the Spanish-American War<br />&#8212; became president of the board of New York City Police Commissioners, age 37.   During the two years he held this post, he radically reformed the police department, reputed as one of the most corrupt in America.<br />&#8212; served as governor of New York.  He made such a concerted effort to root out corruption &#8230; that Republican boss Thomas Collier Platt forced him on McKinley as a running mate in the 1900 presidential election. Roosevelt was a powerful campaign asset for the Republican ticket, which defeated William Jennings Bryan in a landslide</p></blockquote>
<p>Reading all that,  just how far did Roosevelt have to rise, to &#8220;rise to the challenge&#8221;?    Not too far, I would say.  You might make an argument that McKinley had farther to rise.</p>
<p>Compare and contrast to Sarah Palin, either through the eyes of the GOP, or via Wikipedia.<br />
<blockquote>&#8212; University of Idaho Bachelor of Science degree in communications-journalism<br />&#8212; two terms on the Wasilla, Alaska city council <br />&#8212; two terms as mayor of Wasilla<br />&#8212; ran for lieutenant governor of Alaska (unsuccessful)<br />&#8212; chaired the Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission and served as Ethics Supervisor of the commission<br />&#8212; elected the governor of Alaska </p></blockquote>
<p>You go for it, Bill Kristol.  Compare the self described pit bull hockey mom to Teddy Roosevelt.  Dueling bullmooses at ten paces.  (Question for bonus points:  would today&#8217;s GOP run Teddy for president?  Discuss.)</p>
<p>How Kristol can compare her to Roosevelt or even Coolidge without blushing is a mystery to me &#8212; no matter how many bull mooses she has shot.</p>

<blockquote>In response to disruptions caused by Hurricane Gustav, the DOE has indicated a willingness to release reserves from the SPR. Unfortunately, due to a continuing power outage &#8211; also caused by Hurricane Gustav &#8211; the DOE is unable to pump oil from storage.</p>
<p>Disruptions serious enough to be &#8220;economically threatening,&#8221; whatever that means, are very rare events &#8211; the U.S. has only released oil in such circumstances a few times in the SPR&#8217;s 35-year history. Power outages are also rare events. If the two kinds of events were uncorrelated, then simultaneous power outages and economically-threatening disruptions in oil supplies would unlikely in the extreme. But the two kinds of events are not uncorrelated, obviously.</p>
<p>As Platts reports, the SPR does have backup generators on site, but the generators produce insufficient power to permit pumping from storage. Any release of oil from the SPR will have to wait for power to be restored to the area. [emphases mine, but see the original&#8217;s as well]</p></blockquote>
<p>So those past seven years of adding to the Reserve can be added to the list of abject failures when the time came for them to actually perform.</p>

                                <p>by Divorced one like Bush</p>
<p>From comments in <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/09/economic-trouble.html">Cactus&#8217; post</a>: <br />“Now in the last couple of years we have seen unprecedented oil prices that have sapped our economy&#8217;s strength.” </p>
<p>Yes, we have. Others have presented this argument.  However,there was plenty of information in existence long before the &#8220;last couple of years&#8221; regarding the issue of oil price on economic performance.  This report from the IMF, <a href="http://imf.org/external/pubs/ft/oil/2000/index.htm">The Impact of Higher Oil prices on the Global Economy</a> from 12/8/2000 suggests that we have been living with such a predicament and certainly had tasted such and thus should have had better policy responses.  It is a report in response to the World Economic Outlook report of 9/2000 which “contained an extensive discussion of the potential impact of higher prices.”  It is written such that it: “includes a discussion of main policy implications for developed and developing countries. An Appendix reviews lessons from earlier oil price increases.”</p>
<p>Discussing consumption and production:<br />
<blockquote>In 2000, the price of oil has been at its highest level since the mid-1980s, excluding the brief price spike at the end of 1990. The current price hike, if maintained for any significant length of time, is likely to accentuate the trend towards energy conservation and the shift from oil to other sources of energy, especially in sectors other than transport.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, Bush et al sure proved that prediction about shifting toward conservation was wrong?  At least for US.</p>
<p>The report notes 5 means by which rising prices will effect the global economy(paralleling the WEO): <br />
<blockquote>There will be a transfer of income from oil consumers to oil producers.<br />There will be a rise in the cost of production of goods and services in the economy, given the increase in the relative price of energy inputs, putting pressure on profit margins.<br />here will be an impact on the price level and on inflation. <br />There will be both direct and indirect impact on financial markets. Actual as well as anticipated changes in economic activity, corporate earnings, inflation, and monetary policy following the oil price increases will affect equity and bond valuations, and currency exchange rates.<br />Finally, depending on expected duration of price increases, the change in relative prices creates incentives for suppliers of energy to increase production (to the extent that there is scope for doing so) and investment, and for oil consumers to economize. </p></blockquote>
<p>In the conclusion:<br />
<blockquote>For much of the period since the October 2000 World Economic Outlook was completed, oil prices have averaged $5 per barrel higher than assumed in that exercise. A sustained oil price increase of that size would imply a permanent transfer of about ¼ percent of GDP from global oil importers to oil exporters, relative to the WEO baseline, <strong>with additional transfers of income from oil consumers to oil producers within countries</strong>.</p></blockquote>
<p>Get that last bit?  From us heart of America, working class local yokels to the producers. Windfall profits anyone?</p>
<p>The suggested policy for countries like US:<br />
<blockquote>With regard to policy implications, as experience in previous oil shocks shows&#8230; monetary policy in advanced countries will need to prevent second round price effects. This will help ensure that there is only a price level effect, but not a continuing impact on the rate of inflation.</p></blockquote>
<p>I think they are saying raise the rates or at least not drop them without caution?  We went from4.99 in 7/1999 to a peak of 6.54 in 7/2000 to 3.77 in 7/2001 and 1.73 by 7/2002.  OH Well.</p>
<p>In the WEO report it notes specifically for the US:<br />
<blockquote>In the short term, the current fiscal stance should be maintained—and to the extent possible, strengthened—by resisting calls for tax reductions or additional expenditures. Over the longer term, the authorities’ intention to substantially preserve the fiscal surpluses in prospect, and to pay down the public debt, will help support national savings, as well as prepare for the coming long wave of unfunded liabilities associated with the retirement of the baby boom generation.</p></blockquote>
<p>We can list all sorts of “events” that happened to cause a less than desirable outcome, however, it is the response to the events that ultimately determines the final experiences.   The response is materialized in the policy adopted.  To date, the policy has failed to stabilize our economic performance, never mind improve it over the course of 8 years.  I would accept “events” as a reasonable argument for our current status if Bush et al had not performed worse than historical.  That is the <a href="http://www.measuringworth.com/growth/">real GDP rate </a>from 1930 to 2000 being 3.66% vs 2001 to 2007 of 2.58%. <br />Or real GDP per capita of 2.44% 1930 to 2000 vs 2001 to 2007 of 1.61%.  Bush et al could not even perform as well as 1930 to 1940  when real GDP and GDP/capita were 2.72% and 2.00% respectively.  This 10 year period included negative growth of GDP/capita for 4 periods of: 7.14,13.46, 1.86 (1930 to 1933) and 4.19 (1937/38).</p>
<p>Bush et al&#8217;s results are pure policy and that is based on ideology and that is what this election is all about.</p>

<p>We don&#8217;t know if someone else has noticed this amazing fact: in a cross country regression, the ratio of public health care spending to GDP is negatively correlated with the infant mortality rate as one would expect, but the share of private health care spending in GDP is positively correlated.  In a simple regression with including only log per capita GDP (corrected for PPP) as an additional explanatory variable, both coefficients have large t-statistics.  </p>
<p>The positive coefficient on private health care spending becomes insignificant when other variables are included, but it does not become negative.  The result is not due to the USA which is an extreme outlier in private health care spending over GDP.</p>
<p>The result is not simply due to a correlation between high public spending and low income inequality as it holds when log per capita GDP is replaced by log per capita income of each of the lower 4 quintiles (this is our original regression hence the low number of countries in the sample).</p>
<p>Update:  I hope this version of the table is legible</p>

<p>the one above is of residuals of ln infant mortality on ln pc GDP, the year and private health care spending as a percent of GDP on residuals of public health care spending as a percent of GDP on those variables</p>
<p>The other (below) is of residuals of ln infant mortality on ln pc GDP, the year and public health care spending as a percent of GDP on residuals of private health care spending as a percent of GDP on those variables</p>

<p>Note two countries with high leverage due to very high private health care spending compared to what one would expect given the other variables.  The most extreme is the USA which also has higher infant mortality than one would guess given per capita GDP, the year and public health care spending.  The second most extreme is Uruguay which has the infant mortality one would expect given the other variables.  </p>
<p>If I drop them the coefficient on private health care spending as a fraction of GDP goes up (you can see that it would in the scatter) to 0.150 from 0.134.  The t-stat *increases* from 3.12 to 3.16 which is not what I expected.   </p>
<p>dumping just the USA (which I have done ten times by now) gives a coeff of 0.117 and a t-state of 2.85.</p>
<p>The country with the highest infant mortality residual is South Africa.  Adding HIV prevalence to the regression is one of the things that reduced the size of the strange coefficient on private health care spending.  Dropping the USA and South Africa gives a coefficient of  0.0916 with a t-stat of 2.16, that is the USA and South Africa together provide a substantial part of the apparent evidence that private health care spending is bad for health. </p>
<p>After the jump I will report regressions done partly in response to comments.  Right now I will not even try to make them easily readable (sorry) but just cut and paste STATA output with minimal explanation of variable names.  Sorry.  Click at your own risk</p>
<p>In response to comments partly.</p>
<p>First comment &#8220;why only 71 countries&#8221;.  The answer is that we were looking at income distribution and infant mortality so we only used countries where we had estimates of quintile shares of income (q1 is share of first quintile, q2 second etc).  Without consulting Tilman, I decided to replace the log per capita real income (corrected for ppp) of different quintiles with log per capita real GDP (corrected for PPP) to make a simpler table and to focus on health care expenditures.  This causes the strange positive t-stat on private spending to become alarmingly large, that is, part of the positive coefficient is due to correlation of private health care spending and inequality.  In my original post, I wrote that the coefficient was very non robust.  This is partly because I only really think about regressions which control for inequality.  Ignoring inequality (which is crazy) it is robust to many other variables with the exception of continent dummies and a combination of infant mortality related variables (each one doesn&#8217;t do it see comment thread for details).</p>

<p>lnq1 is the log of the real pc income of households in the lowest quintile.  Hex stands for health care expenditures as a percent of GDP.</p>
<p>Now to me, the interesting question is &#8220;Is private health care spending less effective than public health care spending&#8221; and certainly not &#8221; is it actually harmful as suggested by this silly regression&#8221;.</p>
<p>To answer the interesting question we (OK Tilman) ran regressions including total health care spending and just private health care spending.  the coefficient on private spending should measure the difference in effectiveness private minus public.</p>

<p>The result is not not not due to the USA the variable reg25 is a dummy variable for the USA, since the USA is the only North American country in the sample.  Dropping the USA from the regression has no effect on the results except that no coefficient on reg25 can be estimated (really zero effect I checked because I wasn&#8217;t thinking).</p>
<p>I would say that the evidence that private health care spending has a lesser effect on infant mortality than public health care spending is quite robust.  There is no way to reliably determine the direction of causation or rule out omitted variables bias, but the robustness to inclusion of other variables convinces me that neither is the full explanation.  This is relevant to reverse causation too if the newly included  variable is the original cause of bad health which then causes high private health care spending.  There is evidence in the data set that high HIV incidence causes high private health care spending.  Including HIV incidence (the variable called hiv) does not zap the t-stat, so that&#8217;s not the whole story.</p>

<p>Back in January, I had a post entitled <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/01/why-is-economy-in-trouble-seriously-why.html">Why is the Economy in Trouble? Seriously, Why is the Economy in Trouble?</a>. If I may quote myself extensively (and I may!!):</p>
<blockquote><p>[W]hy is the economy in a state where even rational people are talking about the need for stimulus only a few years after we&#8217;ve had large individual income tax cuts, big cuts on taxes on repatriated corporate income, and continued year after year tax cuts on the estate tax. And let&#8217;s not forget that the Fed has bent over backward to help GW. Take a look at real interest rates since GW took office &#8211; has any president gotten anything even remotely resembling this sort of help since stagflation was vanquished?</p>
<p>So in plain English, we&#8217;ve had a heck of a lot of what we&#8217;re told is fiscal stimulus and a heck of a lot of monetary stimulus since GW took office.<br /><bold>…</bold><br />And yet there&#8217;s still trouble. This administration (and its cheerleaders) have been wrong about everything they&#8217;ve told us about the economy. They promised rapid growth and to <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/usbudget/blueprint/bud01.html">pay down the debt</a>. In 2007, the surplus was going to be so big that there wouldn&#8217;t be enough retiring bonds to pay off. By 2010, debt was to be 6.5% of GDP. That was their first economic plan.</p>
<p>A recession came &#8211; they blamed it on Clinton and 9/11 and pushed through tax cuts, and more tax cuts. It was a light recession&#8230; short and shallow. But apparently enough so that debt would grow rather than shrink, despite all the help from the Fed. And for some reason, growth was anemic. So they pushed more tax cuts. And growth was still anemic. Eventually, in mid &#8211; 2003, the economy started to pick up again. There was much trumpeting of horns and pontificating and gloating. We&#8217;ve had average real growth for a few years plus a big run-up in the debt, and now we&#8217;re back to worrying about a downturn again? Now? So soon after their wonderful remedy produced what Kudlow called the Goldilocks economy?</p>
<p>Which raises a question&#8230; what are they going to blame it on now? Clinton has been out of office too long, its been more than six years since 9/11, Congress has given them just about everything they wanted, and the Fed could not be more cooperative. (In fact, anyone could see the Fed helped so much for so long, it created its own problem&#8230; which is where we are at this point.) So what is left? Why the very short, very sub-par expansion? If its not Clinton, and not 9/11, and not the Fed, and not some big problem from abroad, then what? Random chance? For no particular reason, this happened now? Or is it their economy, their policies?</p>
<p>My guess is that they&#8217;ll find some other reason, something other than their own actions and remedies and prescriptions. Because as far as GW and his cheerleaders are concerned, this situation gives them an excuse to peddle some more of their failed remedies and inane prescriptions. After what we&#8217;ve seen since January of 2001, a decent man would not go before the American public with a smirk on his face and tell us we need more tax cuts. But GW will. And decent people would not see the smirk and hear the call for more of the same and support it. But the cheerleaders will. </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>I guess now, a few months later, we see that GW isn&#8217;t the only one who goes before the American public and tells us we need more tax cuts. But the question stands – if tax cuts are beneficial, why has the economy performed so poorly for seven and a half years?</p>
<p>This is not a business cycle thing – its not like the economy did well for part of his term and we&#8217;re now in a trough. GW is on currently on track to finish his term with an annualized growth rate of around 1.3% of real GDP per capita. Since Ike took office, <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/01/dynamic-scoring-two-simple-graphs-tell.html">Ike, Ford and Bush Sr.</a> produced growth rates that were that dismal. But <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/07/comparing-presidents-national-debt.html">Ike was diligent about paying down the debt</a>, Ford had to contend with an Oil Crisis and disco, and <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/09/growth-fed-and-presidents.html">Bush Sr. got hosed by Alan Greenspan</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>GW has had everything his way for a very long time, he got to implement the policies he wanted, he got help from the Fed, and he didn&#8217;t seem to worry about deficits. So, after all of this, I ask again, why has the economy performed so poorly since GW took office? What gets the blame? Something other than policy must, or McCain wouldn&#8217;t be peddling more of the same.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s compare the two candidates policies, major component by major component.  It will not be easy because they are both extensive but modestly detailed.  Furthermore, you the reader will have to do some work by reading their plans.  So let&#8217;s get started with &#8220;Energy&#8221; because it is, to my mind the core of what must happen to implement most of their other policies.   Here are the specific links to the candidates Web sites policy on energy in alphabetical order.<br /><a href="http://www.johnmccain.com/Informing/Issues/17671aa4-2fe8-4008-859f-0ef1468e96f4.htm">McCain</a><br /><a href="http://www.barackobama.com/index.php">Obama</a></p>
<p>McCains preamble: <br />Our nation&#8217;s future security and prosperity depends on the next President making the hard choices that will break our nation&#8217;s strategic dependence on foreign sources of energy and will ensure our economic prosperity by meeting tomorrow&#8217;s demands for a clean portfolio. John McCain has made the necessary choices &#8211; producing more power, pushing technology to help free our transportation sector from its use of foreign oil, cleaning up our air and addressing climate change, and ensuring that Americans have dependable energy sources. John McCain will lead the effort to develop advanced transportation technologies and alternative fuels to promote energy independence and cut off the flow of oil wealth to repressive dictatorships like Iran. </p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>In the last installment of this Social Security series we kind of dug into some of the details of unfunded liability, what it was and what it wasn&#8217;t and most importantly where the incidence occured: in the past or in the future. <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/08/backwards-transfer-is-back.html">Backwards Transfer is Back</a>. In the course of that I think it became pretty clear that none of that liability really was the consequence of overpayments to what Social Security calls &#8216;past participants&#8217; that instead it was all due to a gap between future cost and future income for &#8216;current participants&#8217;. But in the course of that discussion the role of &#8216;future participants&#8217; fell through the crack when instead the numbers have some surprising implications. But before getting to that I want to back up and consider Unfunded Liability more broadly.</p>
<p>Traditionally Social Security has judged solvency over the short term (10 years) and the long term (75 years). Which seems reasonable enough, 75 years being a period that will capture the retirement years of pretty much any current worker. The metrics of solvency were typically expressed as percentage of payroll or percentage of GDP. In 2003 the Reports introduced  new measures of solvency which expressed the gap between income and cost in Present Value dollars over the 75 year window and indeed over the Infinite Future. The first set of numbers just divides this into periods: first 75 years, 75 years to Infinite Future, and total and expresses it in dollars.<br />2003: $3.5 trillion, $7 trillion, $10.5 trillion<br />2004: $3.7 trillion, $6.7 trillion, $10.4 trillion<br />2005: $4.0 trillion, $7.1 trillion, $11.1 trillion<br />2006: $4.6 trillion, $8.6 trillion, $13.4 trillion<br />2007: $4.7 trillion, $8.9 trillion, $13.6 trillion<br />2008: $4.3 trillion, $8.3 trillion, $13.6 trillion<br />What do these numbers tell us? Well not much really. Generally you would expect the unfunded liability over the first seventy five years to increase simply because of normal population growth, we will have more people overall in year seventy-six than we do in year one, as we drop the latter and add the former we can expect an uptick in liability which right now is about .06% of payroll. The relatively small changes from 2003 to 2004 and 2006 to 2007 can be explained in this way. On the other hand the bigger movements from 2005 to 2006 or 2007 to 2008 turn out on examination to be the result of additional changes in assumptions, in the first case in assumed interest and in the latter changes in assumptions about immigration. But other than that the numbers don&#8217;t really give us much guidance except perhaps to wonder why the future numbers from year 76 on, representing as they do the Infinite Future are not even larger. To get insight into this we need to move to a more granular analysis. Which comes under the fold.</p>
<p>The Table numbers vary a little bit between reports with what was Tables IV.B7 and IV.B8 in earlier Reports become IV.B6 and IV.7 but all are titled <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/IV_LRest.html#267528">Present Values of OASDI Cost Less Tax Revenue and Unfunded Obligations for Program Participants[Present values as of January 1, 2008; dollar amounts in trillions]</a> People who read the last post may remember that the Trustees break down &#8220;Program Participants&#8217; in kind of an odd way:<br />&#8216;Past participants&#8217; would seem to be that group of people who formerly drew benefits but no longer do. In short the dead.<br />&#8216;Current participants&#8217; are defined as everyone fifteen and older and so include all current workers and current retirees.<br />&#8216;Future participants&#8217; are defined as everyone under fifteen plus those not yet born. The table assigns dollar figures to these groups as follows:<br />Row 1 = &#8220;Present value of future cost less future taxes for current participants&#8221; (Over the next 100 years)<br />Row 2 = &#8220;Less current trust fund&#8221;<br />Row 3 = &#8220;Equals unfunded obligation for past and current participants&#8221; (Note that in this case the contribution of past participants is likely positive overall)<br />Row 4 = &#8220;Plus present value of cost less tax for future participants for through the infinite future&#8221;<br />Row 5 = &#8220;Equals unfunded obligation for all participants through the infinite future&#8221;<br />This result can be expressed as an equation. So what does it look like over the same period as above? (Figures in trillions)<br />2003: $11.9 &#8211; $1.4 = $10.5  -$.0 = $10.5<br />2004: $12.7 &#8211; $1.5 = $11.2  -$.8 = $10.4<br />2005: $13.7 &#8211; $1.7 = $12.0  -$.9 = $11.1<br />2006: $15.1 &#8211; $1.9 = $13.3 + $.1 = $13.4<br />2007: $16.5 &#8211; $2.0 = $14.4 &#8211; $.8   = $13.6<br />2008: $17.4 &#8211; $2.2 = $15.2 &#8211; $1.5 = $13.6 (rounding is Trustees&#8217;)</p>
<p>What does this tell us? Well actually quite a bit. The increases in column one are mostly I think to be explained by current demographics, fewer people entering the workforce compared to the large cohort of Boomers leaving. And column two is just showing the effects of a Trust Fund in current surplus with column three being the simple sum. </p>
<p>But it is column four that is most interesting to me. Biggs looks at that and sees future participants paying more in taxes than they are projected to get in benefits. I suggest that is the wrong way to look at it, instead turn it around. In 2003 future participants, then defined as all people born after 1988, taken as a whole could expect their benefits to be fully funded by their taxes. Which is to say that long term Social Security is projected to return to pay-go with a surplus and that all of the problem is in fact confined to the next 100 years.</p>
<p>This has some profound implications for policy. Under current projections Social Security is set to pay out 78% of the scheduled benefit starting in 2041, an amount that will shrink to 75% at the end of the 75 year window. But at that point the very youngest of the &#8216;current participants&#8217; of 2008 will be 90 and the impact of that cohort will be fading rapidly and we can reasonably expect it will go to zero right at the end of the hundred year period. Meaning that any fixes we choose to put in over the next couple of decades could be reversed later on with no damage to the long, long term outlook for Social Security. In actual practice there is no way we could limit the impacts of any medium term fixes to the current batch of current participants, some of the earlier cohorts of future participants will no doubt be called to sacrifice along with existing current participants. But there is a light at the end of that long tunnel. And if over the next couple of decades we can beat the current economic projections and so reduce the growth of column one and three we can make that light brighter and brighter.</p>
<p>In the light of the above equations Social Security&#8217;s unfunded liability is more akin to a fixed term mortgage than an infinite burden. We can and should take some efforts to pay it down quicker while knowing that given regular payments it goes away some time in the next hundred years anyway. As the post title notes, that liability is effectively bookended.</p>

                                <p>Hat tip to Anonymous for the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/18/AR2008081802111.html">Wapo</a> article.</p>
<blockquote><p>In January 2007, as years of loose mortgage lending were about to send the nation&#8217;s housing market into devastating decline, Fannie Mae chief executive Daniel H. Mudd wrote a confidential memo to his board. </p>
<p>Discussing the company&#8217;s successes, Mudd said one of Fannie Mae&#8217;s achievements in 2006 was expanding its involvement in the market for subprime and other nontraditional mortgages. He called it a step &#8220;toward optimizing our business.&#8221; </p>
<p>A month later, Fannie Mae outlined plans to further expand its activities in the subprime market. The company recognized the already weak performance of subprime loans but predicted that they would get better in 2007, according to another Fannie Mae document. </p>
<p>Internal documents show that even late in the housing bubble, Fannie Mae was drawn to risky loans by a variety of temptations, including the desire to increase its market share and fulfill government quotas for the support of low-income borrowers. </p>
<p>Since then, Fannie Mae&#8217;s exposure to loosely underwritten mortgages has produced billions of dollars of losses and sent its stock price plummeting, prompting the federal government to prepare for a potential taxpayer bailout of the company. This month, Fannie Mae reported that loans from 2006 and 2007 accounted for almost 60 percent of its second-quarter credit losses. </p>
<p>Fannie Mae documents from the period, obtained by The Washington Post, paint a picture of a company with the dual incentives of fostering affordable housing and making money, and of one caught between the imperatives of increasing its market share while avoiding excessive risk. In a bid to juggle these demands, the company&#8217;s executives took on risks they either misunderstood or unduly minimized.</p></blockquote>
