                                <p>That our new Sec. of State tried to bury the estimate that major world terrorist attacks tripled in 2004 is not news to the blog world.  But now <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7643286">MSNBC</a> is running the story via Reuters.  Hopefully, a real debate on how best to fight the war on terror will finally begin.  Whether this debate gets this White House to take action remains to be seen.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>This title was taken from <a href="http://www.techcentralstation.com/041505B.html">Arnold Kling</a> who is challenging the suggestion from <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/04/healthcare-wrap-up.html">AB and Kash</a> that we do not get that much from all the money we spend on health care as compared to other nations.  Arnold writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>That is, I believe that it is likely that, for the most part, Americans receive significantly better health care than their counterparts in other advanced countries…Still, it would be premature to state that as a firm conclusion. The point of this essay is not to demonstrate the superiority of our health care system. Instead, what I want to suggest is that the indicators available on comparative health care quality send only weak and contradictory signals. Much better research is required…believe that it is beyond reasonable doubt that, over the past 25 years, the share of GDP devoted to health care has risen faster in the United States than in other advanced countries. In 1980, the U.S. share (using OECD measures) was 8.7 percent, which was higher than most OECD countries, but close to or even lower than the shares of Germany, Sweden, and Denmark. By the year 2000, the U.S. share was 13.1 percent, and only one other country (Germany) had a share over 10 percent. I believe that it is beyond reasonable doubt that at least some of the difference in spending reflects higher utilization rates for health care services. That is, not all of the increase in the U.S. share of health care spending is due to inflation.</p></blockquote>
<p>He goes onto to show that real health care spending has increased in per capita terms, but note that AB, Kash, and others make the same point.  The difference of opinion seems to be whether this increase represents more and/or better services or simply an increase in their relative prices.  After all, OPEC during the 1970’s figured out how to make us pay more for oil by reducing quantity supplied along an inelastic demand schedule.  Arnold, on the other hand, is arguing that the increase in real health care spending represents an outward shift the demand curve.  </p>
<p>Health care services differ from barrels of oil as the former are not easy to quantify.  Arnold was kind enough in a comment to ask us to read <a href="http://www.nao.org.uk/publications/Int_Health_Comp.pdf">NAO’s International Health Comparisons</a>.  After its Part 2, which compares health care expenditures across the G7 nations (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States) as well as Australia, New Zealand, and Sweden, Part 3 discusses what is received in the form of services “in terms of healthcare personnel, medical technology, drugs, the number of medical procedures carried out and preventative medical programmes”.  Part 4 compares health outcomes across nations.  Since this UK organization took used the OECD Health Data 2002, its international comparisons are very similar to those provided by AB and Kash.  </p>
<p>In a comment to AB, Arnold had suggested that AB and Kash had left off the comparisons where the U.S. fared better than other nations.  While we do tend to have more practicing nurses per acute bed that most of the other nations examined, the only other place where I see the U.S. faring better than most nations in terms of services provided is the number of Magnetic Resonance Imaging, which NAO claims is a proxy for investments in new technology.  It may be an odd proxy, however, as Japan’s availability of MRIs is almost three times that of the U.S.  Maybe I’m missing something but I’m not sure if the NAO data at all undermines what AB and Kash were suggesting.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: how could I forget to mention this classic:  Milton Friedman and Simon Kuznets, Income from Independent Professional Practice (NBER, 1945).  Dr. Friedman has often argued that we should abolish the AMA as “state licensing procedures limited entry into the medical profession, thereby allowing doctors to charge higher fees than if competition were more open”.  More recently, <a href="http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/1357032/posts">Dr. Friedman</a> has been continuing to argue that we pay too much for health care, but then his solution is less government involvement.  So at least one conservative economist concedes there are health care inefficiencies even if he does not necessarily agree with the proposed remedies from those of us on the left.</p>

<blockquote><p>We can start with the Social Security system itself. In his book How Social Security Picks Your Pocket: A Story of Waste, Fraud, and Inequities, Joseph Fried estimates that &#8220;$71 billion per year, in the form of spousal and survivor benefits, will be transferred to people with career wages above 70% of the career wage earnings of all other retirees.&#8221; … Social Security wastes money by redistributing it upward. Fix it and we have $71 billion to put into personal accounts.</p></blockquote>
<p>David goes onto suggest we should eliminate corporate welfare, which I think is an excellent suggestion.  Maybe David can start lobbying the GOP leadership to reverse its porkish ways.  Of course, this $71 billion or even the $2 trillion figure is only a small down payment on our overall Federal financing woes, but if we were really serious about not redistributing income to the rich, we would not be shifting the tax burden away from Paris Hilton onto the working poor.</p>

                                <p>&#8230;seems to never end.  The Japanese economy slowed last year (again), and the BoJ&#8217;s hoped-for return of moderate inflation remains <a href="http://news.ft.com/cms/s/47d0d3a0-b60f-11d9-be59-00000e2511c8.html">an elusive goal</a>:<br />
<blockquote><strong>Drop in consumer prices pressures Bank of Japan</strong></p>
<p>Consumer prices fell for a seventh straight year in the 12 months to end-March 2005, confirming that the economy remains stuck in deflation in spite of three years of stop-start growth.</p>
<p>&#8230;The Bank of Japan is on Thursday widely expected to put back its prediction of a return to inflation from this year to next when it publishes a six-monthly report on future trends in prices and economic activity. Last October, the BoJ forecast a return to mild inflation, of 0.1 per cent, in the year to end-March 2006.</p>
<p>Sadakazu Tanigaki, finance minister, said: “The causes of deflation are hard to specify, given prices of some products started rising and corporate profits remain firm. But the fact remains that we are in deflation and we must continue efforts to beat it.”</p>
<p>Other data released on Tuesday contributed to what economists say is a fuzzy picture of an economy struggling to ease out of last year’s mild recession. Workers’ household spending was up 1.7 per cent in March against the previous year, while seasonally adjusted unemployment fell 0.2 percentage points to 4.5 per cent.</p>
<p>Atsushi Nakajima, chief economist at Mizuho, said: “The current situation is far from clear, but I am fairly confident about the economy in the near future.”  Mr Nakajima cited continued strong growth in China, Japan’s biggest trading partner, and near-record corporate profits as reasons to be hopeful. Risks came from continued high oil and raw materials prices, as well as what he said were less-than-bright prospects for the US economy.</p></blockquote>
<p>Japan has certainly provided macroeconomists with an excellent demonstration of just how difficult it is to get out of a deflationary cycle once you&#8217;re in one.  </p>
<p>This also reminds those of us who worry about the sustainability of BWII just how different the situations of Japan and China are.  Unlike China, Japan is unambiguously in the position where the inflationary effects of propping up the dollar are not just tolerable, but to be positively welcomed.  But at the same time, it is China that has been forced to continue buying dollar reserves, while the yen&#8217;s peg against the dollar has been sustained with relatively little intervention from the Japanese authorities in recent months.  This type of data makes one think that they&#8217;d almost welcome the chance to start intervening again&#8230;</p>

                                <p>Forgive me for not finishing the title here, but after reading how <a href="http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/movable_type">Brad DeLong</a> reacted to the latest <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_buzzcharts/buzzcharts200504220855.asp">Buzzcharts</a>, to say there could be anything right about Jerry Bowyer’s series would be a farce.  Brad writes:  </p>
<blockquote><p>A huge number of people who are on payrolls don&#8217;t work for corporations: 21 million of them work for the government, and a host of others for partnerships and sole proprietorships. A bunch of people who are not on non-agricultural payrolls work for corporations as well. Moreover, you miss a good third of economy-wide profits by restricting yourself to corporate profits. Either (a) divide corporate profits by corporate employment, or (b) divide total profits by private employment. Corporate profits divided by a measures of private plus public employment is not sensible &#8211; even if you knew enough about the data to avoid accidently multiplying your result by four.</p></blockquote>
<p>Taking Bowyer’s figures for 1998 after correcting for his mistaken multiplication by four, one would get $3732 in after-tax corporate profits per total reported payroll employees, which indeed sounds awfully low.  And after-tax corporate profits represent only 5% of GDP when we know the capital share of national income is much higher.  I guess Bowyer could argue his series was some form of proxy to compare trends across time, which would mean the scaling by a factor of four does not matter that much.  </p>
<p>His failure to adjust for inflation would matter as we noted earlier.  Additionally, changes in the share of employment by the public sector over time would also matter – albeit the rise in this share over the past few years would work against what Bowyer was trying to say.  Finally, the composition of the private work force captured by corporate employment might have changed over time as well as the share of corporate profits relative to total profits.  If one adjusted for inflation and these other factors, would Bowyer’s graph look at all the same?  </p>
<p>One of our readers also objected to this Bowyer comment:</p>
<blockquote><p>Ignore, if you must, the fact that the real stagflation of the 1970s was caused by the policy prescriptions of Keynesians just like Krugman. Ignore, also, that when Ronald Reagan and Paul Volcker ended that stagflation through supply-side policies &#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>Bowyer must be unaware of Reagan’s attempt at fiscal stimulus, which was not only offset by the FED’s monetary restraint but also lowered savings and investment and hence long-term growth.  Given that Bowyer clearly does not understand what Lord Keynes really meant, I wish he’d simply drop the (ab)use of the term Keynesian.  And as far as being a supply-sider, I have yet to hear from anyone at NRO how reducing national savings promotes long-term growth.</p>

                                <p>For the life of me, I don’t understand why a smart and honest conservative economist like <a href="http://macroblog.typepad.com/macroblog/2005/04/defending_cato.html">David Altig</a> would defend the Cato Institute’s claims as to the alleged benefits of privatization.  To be fair, David is not saying there is some free lunch.  Rather, he objects to <a href="http://economistsview.blogspot.com/2005/04/debunking-daily-debunker.html">this post</a> from Mark Thoma by asserting that the Cato crowd is not pushing the free lunch argument.  </p>
<p>John Geanakoplos, Olivia S. Mitchell, Stephen P. Zeldes noted five years ago in <a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w6713"> Would a Privatized Social Security System Really Pay a Higher Rate of Return?</a> that Steve Forbes, the Heritage Foundation (see William Beach and Gareth Davis. “Social Security’s Rate of Return”), and the Cato Institute were pushing this free lunch claim and then proceeded to explain why the claim is misleading.</p>
<p>I guess one can argue that Stephen Moore has left Cato but peruse the <a href="http://www.socialsecurity.org/cgi-bin/scripts/sstopics.cgi?qt=topic:rate_of_return_issues">Rate of Return Issues</a> section of the Cato Social Security web page and you will find many similar claims.  Also note that their Social Security <a href="http://www.socialsecurity.org/reformandyou/sscalc/sscalc.php">calculator</a> assumes an “inflation adjusted return of 4.95 percent on a 60/20/20 stock/corporate bond/inflation indexed Treasury bond portfolio after subtracting 0.25 percentage points for transactions costs” In fact the calculator is based on the same “analysis” of the proposal that Mark Thoma rightfully criticized.  </p>
<p>We have noted that conservative economist Robert Barro rejected this free lunch claim in July 2000, and that Gary Becker rejected it in February 2005.  It was the Cato Institute that convinced George W. Bush of the alleged benefits of privatization back in the late 1990’s and President Bush is campaigning for privatization (or is it now modernization) using the same claims, which continue to be made by the Cato crowd.  We Democrats would welcome an honest debate over the genuine Social Security reform issues.  Let me suggest that we more honest dialogue from honest conservatives such as David – who does not need to tarnish his own credibility by trying to deny that the Cato crowd is trying to sell us snake oil.</p>

                                <p>When the housing boom ends, what is the possible impact on the US economy? This is a broad brush look at three major potential problems:</p>
<p>1) Increased Unemployment.<br />2) Loss of mortgage equity withdrawal on consumer spending.<br />3) Financial distress.</p>
<p><strong>Unemployment </strong></p>
<p>Last week&#8217;s post (<a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/04/housing-after-boom.html">Housing: After the Boom</a>) looked back at the early &#8217;90s housing bust. In that bust, housing prices deflated slowly over several years, but transaction volumes dropped precipitously. Employment in housing related fields, like residential construction, Real Estate agents, mortgage brokers, home inspectors, escrow and title officers, also decreased significantly.</p>
<p>As an example, in the &#8217;90s, employment in residential building construction dropped almost 30% from the peak to trough. A similar drop today would mean the loss of about 250 thousand jobs in this category of construction.</p>
<p><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/img/243/2888/640/ConstEmploy.jpg"><img src="http://photos1.blogger.com/img/243/2888/320/ConstEmploy.jpg" border="0"></a><br /><i>Click on graph for larger image.</i></p>
<p>Residential specialty contractors is a much larger labor category. The BLS only started breaking out residential vs. non-residential specialty contractors in 2001, but the impact on the entire field in the early &#8217;90s was about 12% of total jobs lost, or the equivalent of 530 thousand jobs lost today.</p>
<p><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/img/243/2888/640/ConstSpecialty.jpg"><img src="http://photos1.blogger.com/img/243/2888/320/ConstSpecialty.jpg" border="0"></a></p>
<p>Not only are these jobs at risks in a slowdown, but housing has been the bright spot for employment over the last few years.  These constructions jobs have accounted for 450 thousand of the 1.6 million private sectors jobs added since the end of the 2001 recession. Real Estate agents and mortgage brokers have added another 400 thousand jobs since the recession (see <a href="http://calculatedrisk.blogspot.com/2005/04/bubble-employment.html">Bubble Employment</a>) making housing the main job creation engine of the US economic recovery.</p>
<p>If the housing slowdown is similar in magnitude to the early &#8217;90s bust, then the US economy would lose approximately 1.2 million housing related jobs in just these fields: construction, real estate agents and mortgage brokers. These job losses would probably occur over a multi-year period.</p>
<p>How would this impact overall employment? Currently there are about 1.8 million new workers added to the US workforce every year. Normally US job growth would keep pace with new entrants. Assuming the rest of the US economy remained reasonably healthy, the loss of these housing related jobs, over a 3 year period, would slow expected job growth to just over 1 million jobs per year.</p>
<p>Of course another area of employment could surprise us and see rapid job creation that mitigates the losses in the housing area. But many of these housing related jobs are relatively high paying with low education requirements, therefore the current job holders might have difficultly finding new jobs with similar pay.</p>
<p>This analysis doesn&#8217;t include suppliers for the housing industry, like lumber, household durable goods and other related industries. Obviously a loss of high paid housing related jobs will impact other local business too, like retailers and restaurants, but that is more difficult to quantify.</p>
<p>Just looking at employment, a housing slowdown similar to the &#8217;90s, will slow the growth of the US economy, but probably not lead to a recession.</p>
<p>Mortgage Equity Withdrawal</p>
<p>During the last few years homeowners have borrowed heavily on their homes. In the previous housing boom, mortgage borrowing only increased slightly.</p>
<p><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/img/243/2888/640/MortgageDebt.jpg"><img src="http://photos1.blogger.com/img/243/2888/320/MortgageDebt.jpg" border="0"></a></p>
<p>The above graph is of the annual increase in the total household mortgage debt. Total mortgage debt increased $900 Billion in 2004 and $733 Billion in 2003; a significant increase from the $200 Billion in &#8217;97. This mortgage debt has helped fuel consumer spending in recent years.</p>
<p>Instead of using total mortgage debt, Goldman Sachs senior economist Jan Hatzius suggests using &#8220;Mortgage Equity Withdrawal&#8221; (MEW), a measure that is used in England. This excludes the mortgage debt associated with buying new construction. Hatzius <a href="http://www.dallasnews.com/s/business/dimartino2/031705ccdrBizDimartino.1488bbb06.html">has calculated</a> that homeowners have pulled $640 Billion from their homes in 2004, as compared to just $74 Billion ten years ago.</p>
<p>If mortgage interest rates decline, it is possible that another round of home refinancing could occur. However, with rates rising and house prices deflating, it is likely that MEW will decrease substantially.  Given the size of the borrowings, the end of this indebtedness spree might have a significant impact on consumer spending and consumer related industries.</p>
<p>Just like housing related employment has been the primary engine of job creation, MEW has been a major contributor to consumer spending and to GDP growth over the last few years. For the first time, the annual increase in mortgage debt has been larger than GDP growth in the US.</p>
<p><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/img/243/2888/640/MortgageGDP.jpg"><img src="http://photos1.blogger.com/img/243/2888/320/MortgageGDP.jpg" border="0"></a></p>
<p>Have we been buying growth with debt?</p>
<p><strong>Financial Distress</strong></p>
<p>The loss of both housing related employment and mortgage equity withdrawal might lead to a recession in the US economy. The severity of any recession probably depends on a wildcard: how much financial distress is caused with falling housing prices. This distress could impact both homeowners and financial related institutions.</p>
<p>There is already an ominous sign for homeowners: U.S. foreclosures are up 57% from March 2004 according to a recent <a href="http://www.jsonline.com/bym/news/apr05/315969.asp">report</a>. Jim Houston, vice president with Foreclosure.com, said March&#8217;s figures involve &#8220;the highest spike we&#8217;ve ever seen&#8221; in new foreclosures.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The hardest hit states: Ohio, Texas, Michigan and Georgia, with more than 2,300 new foreclosures each.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>What is interesting is these are the non-bubble states according to an <a href="http://www.nationalcity.com/content/corporate/EconomicInsight/documents/STATEMENT.pdf">analysis</a> by Richard J. DeKaser, Chief Economist at National City Corporation. Borrowers in these non-bubble states are getting in trouble first, probably because of job losses (their local economies are not as strong as the bubble states without the booming RE business) and they were not able to extract as much equity during the refinancing boom. Even without rapidly rising prices, many of the homeowners took advantage of the highly leveraged loan programs, borrowed heavily on their homes, and are now facing foreclosure.</p>
<p>But the real problem will be in the bubble states.  If the housing boom ends like the &#8217;90s bust, then declining housing prices could lead to a wave of foreclosures. Rapidly rising foreclosures rates could cause a ripple effect, impacting the lending institutions much like the S&#038;L crisis of the &#8217;80s.</p>
<p>Kash <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/04/responding-to-revaluation.html">discussed</a> last week the possible danger to the US financial system due to rising rates. It is possible that these institutions could face both rising rates and an increase in foreclosures. FED Chairman Greenspan testified earlier this month that a crisis at either Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac could imperil US financial markets. Greenspan said: &#8220;Without restrictions on the size of (their) balance sheets, we put at risk our ability to preserve safe and sound financial markets in the United States, a key ingredient of support for homeownership.&#8221;</p>
<p>Usually, in an economic slowdown, rates would be falling and that would cushion the blow. However it is possible that rates could increase as the economy slows. One possibility is that the budget deficit would increase during a slowdown, but foreign investors would be less willing to invest in the US without higher rates. That would cause further declines in housing prices; a <a href="http://calculatedrisk.blogspot.com/2005/03/housing-and-trade-virtuous-cycle-about.html">vicious cycle</a>.</p>
<p>In summary, a likely scenario for when the boom ends: prices will probably deflate slowly over several years, but transaction volumes will drop precipitously. Housing related employment will fall in relation to the drop-off in transactions and, if interest rates remain steady or increase, mortgage equity withdrawal will decrease significantly leading to less consumer spending and most likely (my own opinion, not necessarily Angry Bear) a recession.</p>

                                <p>Our friend <a href="http://economistsview.blogspot.com/2005/04/debunking-daily-debunker.html">Mark Thoma</a> is fairly new to blogging, but he has already figured out that <a href="http://www.socialsecurity.org/pubs/articles/debunker-050422.html">Cato crowd</a> lies a lot with respect to the Social Security debate.  The most recent “Daily Debunker” from Cato discusses the Johnson-Flake proposal, which sounds to me like an old song: (a) reduce government expenditures by switching from wage indexing to price indexing; and (b) allowing workers to take half of their contributions and invest them anyway they want.  Yes, (a) addresses this alleged solvency problem by cutting benefits, but Cato claims that workers will be somehow better off because of (b).  </p>
<p>Even though their free lunch claims have been refuted numerous times over the years, the Cato crowd just keeps repeating these bogus arguments.  Mark does a nice job of debunking every aspect of this Cato op-ed.  I suspect the Cato crowd will simply ignore Mark as they ignore all real economics.</p>
