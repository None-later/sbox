<p>The blog <a target="_blank" href="http://www.namedevelopment.com/blog/archives/2007/04/does_being_made.html">Name Wire</a> poses a potent question on perception of value and who builds a product:</p>
<blockquote><p>The recent news that China has surpassed the US as the world’s second largest exporter — now making more cars than Detroit — has got me thinking about what &#8220;Made in China&#8221; means to US consumers.</p>
<p>Nowadays, &#8220;Made in China&#8221; on a brand name product no longer means cheap and cheerful, according to the Washington Times. Even Nokia Phones are being made in China. When it comes to fashion brands, however, &#8220;Made in Spain&#8221; and &#8220;Made in Italy&#8221; have a certain cachet, but this may be waning.</p>
<p>An Asian Times Online article <a target="_blank" href="http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China_Business/ID14Cb02.html">&#8220;China’s Global Luxury Brand Workshop&#8221;</a> notes that high end luxury brand names like Prada, Armani and Burberry are outsourcing to China.</p>
<p>By 2009, 60% of the world’s luxury brand names will have their products made there.</p>
<p>Don’t believe me? French fashion brand Louis Vuitton is putting up a factory in China this year. Prada, for its part, outsources its products to so many countries that they are considering putting &#8220;Made by Prada&#8221; on their labels.</p>
<p>China now makes <a target="_blank" href="http://mathaba.net/0_index.shtml?x=553554">high end trains</a> and rail, <a target="_blank" href="http://tt.tennis-warehouse.com/showthread.php?t=128230">tennis rackets</a>, and <a href="http://www.optiboard.com/forums/showthread.php?t=22915">lenses</a>.</p>
<p>GE is producing wind turbine blades there and Chinese made Chery are the <a href="http://www.panasianbiz.com/doing-business-in-china/madeinchina-car-tops-sales-cha/">top selling autos in China</a> last month, for the first time ever.</p></blockquote>

<p>So I&#8217;m reading <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jeffrey-sachs/aid-ironies_b_207181.html">&#8220;Aid Ironies&#8221;</a> by Jeff Sachs and nodding my head vigorously.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB, and Malaria, and the Global Alliance on Vaccines and Immunizations are both saving lives by the millions, and at remarkably low cost.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes</p>
<p>&#8220;Americans &#8230; overestimate the actual aid from the US by around thirty times, so they imagine that vast sums are flowing to Africa that are then squandered. &#8220;</p>
<p>Yes absolutely very important.  An error of that magnitude is not just ignorance, it is prejudice, but it should be possible to force people to face one single solitary vitally important fact.  Shouldn&#8217;t it ?</p>
<p>Then I get to this sentence </p>
<p>&#8220;US aid to India for increased food production in the 1960s paved the way for India&#8217;s growth takeoff afterwards.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sachs (who I respect immensely) has just outdone Robert Samuelson in the bogus empirics based on whatever the hell lag I please department.  He claims that aid in the 60s caused a growth spurt in the 90s.  <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/06/yglesias-and-klein-on-notpaul-samuelson.html">Even NotPaul only blamed Johnson for things that happened a mere 5 years after he left office. </a> </p>
<p>Sachs (unlike R Samuelson) is very smart.  Why did he write that sentence ?  I think he assumes that people who can overestimate the AID budget by 30 fold can overlook 30 years. I think he has a solid case and doesn&#8217;t have to make absurd arguments.</p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="http://baselinescenario.com/2009/06/02/help-why-are-suvs-more-profitable/">James Kwak</a> of Baseline Scenario asks an important basic question concerning the statement that &#8216;big cars are inherently more profitable for car companies, so smaller is bad for profits&#8217;, and comes up with this part answer:  because we think they do in America, so we can charge more.  Anything else you can think of after reading his piece and reviewing his six hypotheses?  Not CAFE standards?</p>
<blockquote><p>Update&#8230;The first is that SUVs offer a better ratio of perceived value to production cost. That is, there’s an amount of stuff you need to build a functioning car; once you’ve done that, it doesn’t cost twice as much to make it twice as big, because you’re just adding raw materials. (I’m simplifying, obviously.) But people, being not that bright, think something is worth twice as much if it is twice as big. I still think competition should eliminate this larger profit margin, but see the second argument . . .</p>
<p>which is that SUVs and pickup trucks have been less exposed to foreign competition, so instead of having twelve or so viable competitors in the small-car segment, you mainly had three for SUVs.( Some commenters did not agree with this, pointing out that Toyota and Honda have been building pickup trucks for a long time.) With fewer suppliers, you can charge higher prices. </p>
<p>I should clarify that I don’t think there is anything wrong with the hypotheses I listed above; my point was that hypotheses 2-4 do not depend on SUVs/pickups being bigger, but on other characteristics of them. So there is no fundamental reason why, in the future, the profit margin on big things should be bigger than the profit margin on small things. Similarly, if the advantage is due to less foreign competition, then I think that would have gone away in any case, since just about everyone makes an SUV now (every major Japanese or Korean manufacturer, Volvo, Mercedes, BMW, VW, etc.) – though maybe not a pickup.</p>
<p>If the answer is the perceived value/production cost advantage, then that is arguably fundamental to big things as opposed to small things.</p></blockquote>

<p>The Pro-Life Position and Good Business Practice</p>
<p>Around the time of the Schiavo affair, Angry Bear (the blogger himself!) wrote <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/03/schaivo.html">a post</a> which discussed, among other things, the case of Sam Hudson, a comatose boy who died after his feeding tube was removed by the hospital.  That was done against the wishes of his mother, but then, she was penniless and couldn&#8217;t afford to pay the hospital.   Courts have upheld that decision, the precedent has been set, and this sort of thing is no longer news.</p>
<p>Similarly, it should surprise no-one that a pharmaceutical company is under no obligation to provide a drug to an indigent patient, even if that patient has zero possibility of survival without that drug.  Ditto makers of medical devices of various kinds.  Closer to home, for most of us &#8211; we aren&#8217;t required to provide a meal or shelter to a homeless person outside our front door, even if without these that person would not survive the night.  </p>
<p>Its cold blooded, but if we did force hospitals to perform any procedure desired by patients who couldn&#8217;t pay, or makers of pharmaceuticals and medical devices to serve those who can&#8217;t afford it, or even the average Joe to help the poor, we&#8217;d be infringing on private property rights to a degree that even the poor replica of capitalism we&#8217;ve had in this country over the past few decades could never survive.  And while a sizable percentage of the  population may wish it were possible to for everyone to be helped in theory &#8211; the rest perhaps seeing need as a morality play of some sort &#8211; we recognize that we wouldn&#8217;t want to be placed in a world where we were required to help everyone in every situation.  For one thing, we would all collectively go broke.  And because we don&#8217;t want to be forced to into that world, we generally don&#8217;t force other people to live in that world either.</p>
<p>Except&#8230;  many Americans would like to force one group of people to give resources &#8211; time and money &#8211; to another they do not want to support.  That group are women who would otherwise have an abortion.  After all, carrying a child to term is a burden &#8211; it causes changes to the body and in some instances, puts one&#8217;s life at risk.  Its certainly a much bigger burden, say, than forcing some medical devices company to provide stents to those who need them, which as noted above, we would never contemplate doing.  And while the fetus or unborn child &#8211; pick your favorite term &#8211; is innocent of any blame, the same can be said of Sam Hudson, the boy whose feeding was removed, not to mention many of those who need pharmaceuticals, medical devices, or even a warm meal and a place to spend the night.  </p>
<p>In a nutshell, the &#8220;pro-life&#8221; crowd&#8217;s position is this:  if a woman has a voluntary abortion its a sin.  However, if a hospital or a pharmaceutical company or some other entity denies her some resource or some treatment that is necessary for the fetus or unborn child to survive and that denial is due to financial considerations, well, that&#8217;s just good business practice.   And the internal contradictions of the &#8220;pro-life&#8221; crowd are even worse after we&#8217;re born:  if a hospital disconnects a child from a feeding tube and boots him from the hospital knowing full well that those actions mean the child will die painfully within a few days, that&#8217;s fine, but if the child&#8217;s mother tries to ease that same child&#8217;s last moments with an overdose of morphine, that&#8217;s murder. <br />______________________________<br />by cactus</p>

<p>Brad DeLong wrote a brilliant little essay on <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2009/06/project-syndicate-the-hidden-purposes-of-high-finance.html">&#8220;The Hidden Purpose of High Finance&#8221;</a></p>
<p>This is a &#8220;project sindicate&#8221; project, so I think fair use requires me to only quote Brad when he is quoting Keynes except for 3 words, 2 in the quote below and &#8220;eggplant.&#8221;</p>
<p>He dismisses the efficient markets hypothesis half way through and says that high finance has two socially useful effects that it wouldn&#8217;t have if everyone were rational.  In each case the effect is to promote savings.  They are</p>
<p>1) the illusion of liquidity.  Brad quotes Keynes &#8220;the fact &#8216;that each individual investor flatters himself that his commitment is ’liquid’ (though this cannot be true for all investors collectively) calms his nerves and makes him much more willing to run a risk&#8230;.'&#8221;</p>
<p>2) the fun of gambling makes us invest more.  Keynes again &#8220;[t]he game of professional investment is intolerably boring and over-exacting to anyone who is entirely exempt from the gambling instinct; whilst he who has it must pay to this propensity the appropriate toll&#8230;.&#8221; Brilliant, OK so much of the brilliance in Keynes&#8217;s.</p>
<p>After the jump, my rambling thoughts.</p>
<p>update: Brad has <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2009/06/we-are-live-at-the-week-with-the-eclipse-of-the-chicago-school.html">a longer essay</a> which anticipates many of my comments on his shorter essay.  </p>
<p>That is a brilliant essay.  I would say advantage 2 disciplining managers is upside down.  Without high finance we wouldn&#8217;t have the separation of ownership and control in the first place.  High finance creates a principal agent problem and does a little tiny bit to solve it.  Advantage 2 is really a cost.  </p>
<p>The eggplant wedding cake analogy is excellent (although a student of Larry Summers ought to have allowed the use of ketchup).</p>
<p>I think on balance we are not gamblers. Some people are and specialists profit from them.  The key point is if enjoyment of gambling caused us to save and invest more, then stocks should be overpriced compared to treasury securities.  Ooops Mehra Prescott.  Looks like, on balance, people act risk averse.  I am assuming that almost all of the risk of investing in stock is due to noise.  If the desire to gamble caused increased investment, then the patient trader (imagined by Keynes embodied by Buffett) would avoid common stock like the plague.  In the data, quite the contrary.</p>
<p>Liquidity is valuable even without irrationality.  I think you are right that the price of liquidity is based mostly on the irrational sense that liquid assets are safe,that is each persons guess that he will guess what the crowd will do before the crowd &#8212; will sell before the peak etc.  The theoretical effort to explain the price of liquidity in a model in which the average investor is rational and not irrationally convinced that he is smarter than the average investor is eggplant and ketchup souflé takes great effort, has little substance and is likely to collapse.</p>
<p>You are aiming to find hidden purposes of high finance which are socially useful.  &#8220;Purpose&#8221; here is used in a quasi religious way as &#8220;social function.&#8221;  I think you are being diplomatic, but it is almost as if you believe the invisible hand can work without rationality.  I&#8217;d say the purpose is definitely to separate fools and their money.  It works very well at that.  What is the purpose of a Casino ? Do casinos achieve that purpose ? </p>
<p>I&#8217;d distinguish between high finance (joint stock limited liability corporation, index fund) and really high finance, (call it stoned finance) CDS, CDA etc.  A lot of new financial instruments are there to help people hedge.  The reconciliation of a great desire to hedge and rationality is the absurd assertion that they are hedging real risk on untraded assets. In fact, people hedge, because they think that they can make more money out of a mispriced asset that way.  The demand is based on a huge number of people the average one of which thinks he is above average.  Helping compulsive gamblers get in tens of billions over their heads is not socially useful.</p>

<p>In comments Andrew Biggs claims that the <a target="_blank" href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/05/nw-plan-for-real-social-security-fix.html">NW Plan</a> does not actually eliminate $15.4 trillion in unfunded Social Security liability but instead leaves a 1% payroll gap over the Infinite Future. I have no reason to suspect his math but do suspect he doesn&#8217;t fully understand the mechanism.</p>
<p>The Northwest Plan ultimately is a response to long term uncertainty in the projections. Under CBO&#8217;s most recent projections the payroll gap for Social Security is about half of that projected by SSA (1.06% to 2.00%). If the schedule of tax increases set forth in the spreadsheet was set in stone this would mean that if actual economic performance came in in line with CBO then Social Security would over the long term be overfunded, which oddly enough would be a very, very bad thing for Social Security, something I pointed out in installment ten of the AB Soc Sec Series <a target="_blank" href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/05/bw-on-soc-sec-x-danger-of-low-cost.html">The Danger of Low Cost</a>. The NW Plan avoids this by monitoring the tail of the valuation period. For example under 2009 OASDI Trigger the projected Trust Fund ratio remains remarkable steady from around 2062 to 2080 but then takes a mild but noticeable dip to the end of the projection period. If this trend persists as we change valuation periods with the 2010, 2011, and 2012 Reports it might trigger another increase in the mid 2090s. On the other hand if it reverses we might have to push the 2074 increase forward a bit. If it turns out that CBO is more right than SSA this might mean canceling one of the intermediate year cuts and stretching the rest out some, or alternately reduce the amount of the increase in one or more of the scheduled.</p>
<p>In any event we can always adjust the schedule so that the TF ratio result in the new year 75 always remains between 100 and 300 and as such eliminating unfunded liability over that period and so for some extended period beyond.</p>
<p>I suppose someone could take 2009 OASDI Trigger and extend it from 2082 to 2109 and so capture all the potential costs for &#8216;past and current participants&#8217; and so show that the pace of needed increases after 2082 is such that the people of 2062 should consider changing the benefit formula. On the other hand our bigger policy need in the 2060&#8217;s might be planning how to relocate NYC and the whole state of Florida to higher ground. The very uncertainly inherent in future outcomes mitigates against too much prior planning.</p>
<p>The NW Plan eliminates unfunded liabilities because it sets up a mechanism similar to that under which the Fed predicts inflation, with the advantage that SSA will always have a 75 year planning window. If unfunded liability starts creeping back into the picture 20, 30, or 40 years from now the Dales, Bruces and Arnes of that era can deal with it. There is no reason to assume a priori that they will be more feckless than we are and that events occurring decades after our own deaths are our responsibility. This plan if adopted gives us quite powerful assurance that the Social Security car will still have plenty of life left in it 76 years from now. Good enough for me.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Robert Waldmann</p>
<p>I noticed that Robert Samuelson wrote <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/05/31/AR2009053102079.html?hpid=opinionsbox1">this Op-ed in the Washington Post</a>.  I knew I couldn&#8217;t stand to read it (I haven&#8217;t).  However, I did encounter it&#8217;s echos at Matthew Yglesias&#8217;s and Ezra Klein&#8217;s.  After the jump my denunciation of a paragraph quoted from a column which I haven&#8217;t read.  </p>
<p>In the Post Klein quotes a long passage from the op-ed.  It exemplifies idiocy.  I quote the quote<br />
<blockquote>All &#8220;reforms&#8221; do not succeed; some cause more problems than they solve. Johnson&#8217;s economic policies, inherited from Kennedy, proved disastrous; they led to the 1970s&#8217; &#8220;stagflation.&#8221; The &#8220;war on poverty&#8221; failed. The press should not be hostile, but it ought to be skeptical.</p></blockquote>
<p>Samuelson&#8217;s evidence for the failure of Johnson&#8217;s policies are economic problems which began after he had been out of office for 5 years.  This is op-ed level empirics.  Evaluate policy by looking at aggregates with a lag from 0 to 13 years after the beginning of the policy.  This is not evidence.  With that approach one can prove anything.  Why look Hoover&#8217;s policies were followed by the period of, by far, the fastest economic growth the US has ever known (starting 1 month after he left office not 5 years).</p>
<p>Klein assumes that &#8220;stagflation&#8221; must refer to something very important .. the productivity slowdown.  Here he shows his age (half of mine).  The word was commonly used in 1975 long before the slowdown was detected.  It just meant high unemployment combined with inflation.  The causes suspected at the time were the oil price shock (not mentioned by R Samuelson) and, maybe, Aurthur Burns&#8217; monetary policy accepting inflation to get the Nixon vote up to 60%.  If the Johnson deficits caused such damage then what could we expect from the Reagan Bush and Bush deficits.  R Samuelson&#8217;s &#8220;analysis&#8221; is insane.  There is no way to translate it into a statement about measurable variables so that it comes close to fitting the data.</p>
<p>Klein and Yglesias note that the poverty rate fell roughly in half during the  &#8220;unsuccessful&#8221; war on poverty.  Why do most people my age (twice theirs) agree taht the war on poverty was a failure ? I think it is simple.  Way back in the day, lefties tried to convince the apolitical to mildly conservative tax payer that it was better to fight poverty than to suffer crime.  The poverty rate fell during the war on poverty, but the crime rate soared.  This causes a violent reaction.  I&#8217;d guess than anyone over 10 understands that race and racism had a lot to do with it.<br />On the other hand, the decline in poverty was not impressive.  I mean the poverty line measures absolute poverty.  Of course it declines (was the attitude in the 60s). Then when it stopped declining only lefties, and, of course, the poor noticed or cared.</p>
<p>So why does Samuelson dare write such crap ? Well for one thing he is a pundit and has been free to make claims without evidence without ever having to answer criticism for years.  For another, he is presenting the conventional wisdom.  R Samuelson complains that the press writes to much on politics not on policies and their consequences (at least as interpreted by Klein).  He doesn&#8217;t notice that he has decided that Reagan was right, or partly right, because he was politically successful.  Is there any other possible explanation ?</p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.womensenews.org/article.cfm/dyn/aid/4027">Women&#8217;s e news</a> carries a note on a time honored business plan, paying locals to not interfere with production.  This is probably not taught to high school kids in America, or college, but most of us benefit at least through cell phones, i pods, and computers on a daily basis.  Best to ignore the externality?  That is good citizenship?  </p>
<blockquote><p>Prendergast asked senators to support the Congo Conflict Minerals Act, which was introduced by Kansas Sen. Sam Brownback, Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin and Wisconsin Sen. Russ Feingold in April of this year.</p>
<p>The bill aims to break the link between resource exploitation and armed conflict in eastern Congo by requiring companies trading minerals with Congo or neighboring states to disclose mine locations and monitor the financing of armed groups in eastern Congo&#8217;s mineral-rich areas. </p>
<p>&#8220;The sooner the illicit conflict minerals trade is eliminated, the sooner the people of Congo will benefit from their own resources,&#8221; said Prendergrast.</p>
<p>U.S. consumers, Prendergrast said, can also help by pressuring major electronic companies&#8211;from Apple to Sony&#8211;to certify that cell phones, computers and other products contain &#8220;conflict-free minerals,&#8221; a campaign tactic popularized by the Sierra Leone-based film &#8220;Blood Diamonds.&#8221;</p>
<p>Such a process would use a tracking system for components, similar to that developed in 2007 under the Kimberly Process. This international certification scheme ensures that trade in rough diamonds doesn&#8217;t fuel war, as it did in Angola, Cote d&#8217;Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Sierra Leone during the 1990s.</p>
<p>Germany has already developed a pilot fingerprinting system for tin that could be expanded to other minerals and help establish certified trading chains, linking legitimate mining sites to the international market.</p>

<p>All of us might reflect on Frank Schaeffer&#8217;s words concerning hate and incendiary speech.  Automatic slogans that tap deep emotion comes easily to all at points in their lives. Assassinations are &#8216;contagious&#8217; at times.  </p>

<p>Don&#8217;t step in the Voodoo.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2009-05-28-debt_N.htm">Leap in U.S. debt hits taxpayers with 12% more red ink</a><br />
<blockquote>Yhe latest increase raises federal obligations to a record $546,668 per household in 2008, according to the USA TODAY analysis. That&#8217;s quadruple what the average U.S. household owes for all mortgages, car loans, credit cards and other debt combined.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a huge implicit mortgage on every household in America — except, unlike a real mortgage, it&#8217;s not backed up by a house,&#8221; says David Walker, former U.S. comptroller general, the government&#8217;s top auditor.</p></blockquote>
<p> It is nonsense like this that explains why the Northwest Plan for a Real Social Security Fix is better than my previously preferred plan of &#8216;Nothing&#8217;, it helps to shut Peterson stooges like Walker the hell up.</p>
<p>What Walker is telling us via USA Today (which near as I can see did no &#8216;analysis&#8217; at all, just parroting the &#8216;Fiscal Wake-up Tour&#8217; message instead) is that if you add the the current value of all US debt, add to that projected costs of Social Security, Medicare and military pensions you come up with a total of $63.8 trillion which if divided by the number of CURRENT households gives you a total of $546 thousand. This is a meaningless number for any number of reasons. One it implicitly defines &#8216;household&#8217; as &#8216;current household and any future households stemming from it&#8217;, that is if you have four kids your ultimate per household burden will be a quarter of that. Plus this calculation ignores all future households stemming from future immigration and of course households stemming from them. It is a junk number. But rather than try to demonstrate the absurdity of the logic and the arithmetic lets just make a big chunk of that debt go away.</p>
<p>If the NW Plan was enacted into law tomorrow $15.4 trillion in &#8216;unfunded liability&#8217; would vanish from the books. Poof! With no money down and easy payments starting in 2010. Which is better than any mattress deal out there.</p>
<p>Social Security and the CBO score future liability on a current law basis, change the law you change the score. Lets take three different households. The first is a household making median household income of $50,000. The second is a household with a single earner making the average income of $40,000. The third is a one person household where the worker is earning $12.50 an hour. Under the NW Plan the first household would pay $1.50 more in taxes per week by the second year, the second household $1.20 cents, the third household 75 cents with no further changes in tax rate until 2026. That is all it would take to wipe almost a quarter of that $63.8 trillion off the books.</p>
<p>Because it is all just word games. Under current law the Federal Government is required to pay Social Security benefits on the established schedule as long as it has money coming in to pay for it. But if the dedicated revenue stream falls short of that Congress is fully empowered to change that current law. Is the Federal Government really on the hook for $15.4 trillion in unfunded liability for Social Security? Well under current law as of June 1, 2009 yes. After passage of the NW Plan not. Or for that matter after passage of some &#8216;Bi-Partisan&#8217; Commission recommendation not. Trying to equate a current law projected liability into an actual measure of future household debt is just Voodoo Arithmetic. Because at some point Congress will move to add funding to current law or change the current law benefit schedule and in doing so will make that $15.4 trillion dollar &#8216;unfunded liability&#8217; vanish like smoke.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t fall for the hype. Normal households don&#8217;t budget that way. Unless you plan to starve to death you have an unfunded liabiliity for all the food you are going to eat between now and your projected mortality date. If you rent you have an unfunded liability for the cost of keeping a roof over your head. Ditto for your utilities, your clothes, your entertainment. For that matter your real unfunded liability for your car, mortgage and credit cards is far above the face value of the loan balance, absent a Lotto victory you are far more in debt than your current balance sheet shows. But what is important is your carrying costs. Can you make rent and car payments and buy groceries and entertain yourself while paying down your principal balance on your revolving debt? Well then you are fine. That doesn&#8217;t mean you don&#8217;t need to look down the road at things like future college bills or retirement income, it is that if you do you will probably look at it in terms of your monthly income, can I afford to set aside X hundred dollars a month to pay for Suzie&#8217;s education, or maybe to save up for the down payment on that new bass boat?  After that it is just a matter of making payments out of current income.</p>
<p>So people have a choice regarding Social Security. Do you want to lay awake at night wondering how you can possibly come up with your share of $15.4 trillion? Or just roll over thinking &#8220;Well I think I can find an extra buck and a half a week in the next two years and a buck or so more per week per year in 2026. Why am I even worrying?&#8221;.</p>
