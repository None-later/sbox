<p>The following is the opening of a proposed post by financial blogger Bruce Krasting.<br />
<blockquote>SSTF – My Numbers (by Bruce Krasting)</p>
<p>A week ago I attempted to get a consensus estimate on some of the critical variables of the SSTF puzzle from the readers and contributors at Angry Bear.  I started that effort with what I thought would be the easiest component to estimate; interest rates. That effort failed. It seemed to me that no one reading my thoughts on this cared about interest rates and their impact on the Fund. That is thick headed. They are a central component.</p>
<p>Given that this audience showed no interest in participating in the development of a reasonable set of assumptions, I have used my own. Once assumptions are established and a methodology to use them is created a projection for future annual and monthly results can be established. The actual arithmetic is easy; the hard part is making the assumptions.</p></blockquote>
<p>Krasting&#8217;s full letter and a response thereto will be up on  my web-site shortly (I&#8217;ll update with the link). But as one of the &#8220;thick headed&#8221; ones in question I would like to examine a core assumption here, that interest rates ARE a critical variable. Because they really aren&#8217;t,  not at least over the time period Krasting is using. The following table is derived from Krasting&#8217;s numbers. The last column is his calculation for total surplus/deficit, the interest rates are his as well, making the accrued interest calculation one of simple multiplication. The unlabled column is simple subtraction and represents the net negative cash flow from operations in each of the years needed to offset the interest accruing.<br />Year   TF Bal             Int Rate    Interest                                     Surplus/deficit<br />2010 $2.5 trillion x 4.58% = $114 billion &#8211; $20 billion = $94 billion<br />2011 $2.6 trillion x 4.40% = $114 billion &#8211; $56 billion = $58 billion<br />2012 $2.6 trillion x 4.20% = $109 billion &#8211; $86 billion = $25 billion<br />2013 $2.6 trillion x 4.15% = $108 billion &#8211; $125 billion = -$7.2 billion</p>
<p>Krasting places 2013 at $2.7 trillion but that would not matter much, nor would keeping the interest rate steady at 4.58% instead of having it drift to 4.15%, anyway you slice it you have a TF that WILL throw off some $400 to $450 billion in interest between now and 2013. Under Krasting&#8217;s calculations by 2013 cash losses from operations will eat up not only that entire $110 billion or so in annual interest but enough more to actually start cutting into cash principal. Which is a big claim and one which will be discussed in the later post, but which has nothing to do with interest rates. And changes in interest rates of the order Krasting suggests can only move the number up or down a couple of percent from a median of say $425 billion.</p>
<p>Krasting is making the claim that a variable that can move total accrued interest dollar totals by $5 or 6 billion per year critically explains a projected change that would have total income move by $125 billion per year. That just doesn&#8217;t make any sense.</p>
<p>Interest is indeed a key variable in Social Security finance (though at least one Bear would dispute whether that makes it a critical variable). But what the simple arithmetic above shows changes in the interest RATE are not critical, instead they are quite literally marginal moving total Social Security financials on the order of +/- 1% per year.</p>
<p>Personally I have used 5% as a nominal interest rate in the past, largely because that is quite close to the average rate during the 1995 to 2005 period in which most of the Social Security debate took form (as shown in the following table<br />http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/2009/V_economic.html#205214).  And since that nominal rate came in at 4.8% in 2006 and 4.7% in 2007 felt pretty comfortable continuing to do so. If someone wants to insist on using something closer to 4.5% then fine. Because within the broader context of Social Security a 0.5% change in interest rate over a four year period just doesn&#8217;t move the macro numbers in any important way. Interest is important in the medium term, interest rates are important in the long term, but short term changes in those rates are simply not important at all.</p>
<p>The Angry Bears are often stubborn but rarely thick-headed when it comes to simple multiplication and addition. Of the six columns in the mini-table above the interesting ones are columns five and six and for those calculations the variations in column three literally effect numbers around the margin. They just are not a central component for calculating short term TF balances.</p>
<p>I have a good idea why Krasting thinks they HAVE to be critical, because tiny variations in interest rates are indeed critical in his particular area of finance. But Social Security is not an investment fund, it works on an entirely different principle. It intersects the investment world without actually being part of it, something I suggest Mr. Krasting is himself too thick headed to quite understand.</p>

                                <p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.truthout.org/howard-zinn-a-public-intellectual-who-mattered56463">Henry Giroux</a> says of Howard Zinn:</p>
<blockquote><p>Howard was one of the few intellectuals I have met who took education seriously. He embraced it as both necessary for creating an informed citizenry and because he rightly felt it was crucial to the very nature of politics and human dignity. He was a deeply committed scholar and intellectual for whom the line between politics and life, teaching and civic commitment collapsed into each other.</p>
<p>Howard never allowed himself to be seduced either by threats, the seductions of fame or the need to tone down his position for the standard bearers of the new illiteracy that now populates the mainstream media. As an intellectual for the public, he was a model of dignity, engagement and civic commitment. He believed that addressing human suffering and social issues mattered, and he never flinched from that belief. His commitment to justice and the voices of those expunged from the official narratives of power are evident in such works as his monumental and best-known book, &#8220;A People&#8217;s History of the United States,&#8221; but it was also evident in many of his other works, talks, interviews and the wide scope of public interventions that marked his long and productive life. Howard provided a model of what it meant to be an engaged scholar, who was deeply committed to sustaining public values and a civic life in ways that linked theory, history and politics to the everyday needs and language that informed everyday life. He never hid behind a firewall of jargon, refused to substitute irony for civic courage and disdained the assumption that working-class and oppressed people were incapable of governing themselves.<br />Unlike so many public relations intellectuals today, I never heard him interview himself while talking to others. Everything he talked about often pointed to larger social issues, and all the while, he completely rejected any vestige of political and moral purity. His lack of rigidity coupled with his warmness and humor often threw people off, especially those on the left and right who seem to pride themselves on their often zombie-like stoicism. But, then again, Howard was not a child of privilege. He had a working-class sensibility, though hardly romanticized, and sympathy for the less privileged in society along with those whose voices had been kept out of the official narratives as well as a deeply felt commitment to solidarity, justice, dialogue and hope. And it was precisely this great sense of dignity and generosity in his politics and life that often moved people who shared his company privately or publicly. A few days before his death, he sent me an email commenting on something I had written for Truthout about zombie politics. (It astonishes me that this will have been the last correspondence. Even at my age, the encouragement and support of this man, this towering figure in my life, meant such a great deal.) His response captures something so enduring and moving about his spirit. He wrote:</p>
<p>&#8220;Henry, we are in a situation where mild rebuke, even critiques we consider &#8216;radical&#8217; are not sufficient. (Frederick Douglass&#8217; speech on the Fourth of July in 1852, thunderously angry, comes close to what is needed). Raising the temperature of our language, our indignation, is what you are doing and what is needed. I recall that Sartre, close to death, was asked: &#8216;What do you regret?&#8217; He answered: &#8216;I wasn&#8217;t radical enough.'&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />
<blockquote>I suspect that Howard would have said the same thing about himself. And maybe no one can ever be radical enough, but Howard came close to that ideal in his work, life and politics. Howard&#8217;s death is especially poignant for me because I think the formative culture that produced intellectuals like him is gone. He leaves an enormous gap in the lives of many thousands of people who knew him and were touched by the reality of the embodied and deeply felt politics he offered to all of us. I will miss him, his emails, his work, his smile and his endearing presence. Of course, he would frown on such a sentiment, and with a smile would more than likely say, &#8220;do more than mourn, organize.&#8221; Of course, he would be right, but maybe we can do both.</p></blockquote>
<p>Also, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/30/opinion/30herbert.html">Bob Herbert</a> offers us notice:</p>
<blockquote><p>Mr. Zinn was chagrined by the present state of affairs, but undaunted. “If there is going to be change, real change,” he said, “it will have to work its way from the bottom up, from the people themselves. That’s how change happens.”</p>
<p>We were in a restaurant at the Warwick Hotel in Manhattan. Also there was Anthony Arnove, who had worked closely with Mr. Zinn in recent years and had collaborated on his last major project, “The People Speak.” It’s a film in which well-known performers bring to life the inspirational words of everyday citizens whose struggles led to some of the most profound changes in the nation’s history. Think of those who joined in — and in many cases became leaders of — the abolitionist movement, the labor movement, the civil rights movement, the feminist revolution, the gay rights movement, and so on.</p>
<p>Think of what this country would have been like if those ordinary people had never bothered to fight and sometimes die for what they believed in. Mr. Zinn refers to them as “the people who have given this country whatever liberty and democracy we have.”</p>
<p>Our tendency is to give these true American heroes short shrift, just as we gave Howard Zinn short shrift. In the nitwit era that we’re living through now, it’s fashionable, for example, to bad-mouth labor unions and feminists even as workers throughout the land are treated like so much trash and the culture is so riddled with sexism that most people don’t even notice it. (There’s a restaurant chain called “Hooters,” for crying out loud.)</p>
<p>I always wondered why Howard Zinn was considered a radical. (He called himself a radical.) He was an unbelievably decent man who felt obliged to challenge injustice and unfairness wherever he found it. What was so radical about believing that workers should get a fair shake on the job, that corporations have too much power over our lives and much too much influence with the government, that wars are so murderously destructive that alternatives to warfare should be found, that blacks and other racial and ethnic minorities should have the same rights as whites, that the interests of powerful political leaders and corporate elites are not the same as those of ordinary people who are struggling from week to week to make ends meet?</p>
<p>Mr. Zinn was often taken to task for peeling back the rosy veneer of much of American history to reveal sordid realities that had remained hidden for too long. When writing about Andrew Jackson in his most famous book, “A People’s History of the United States,” published in 1980, Mr. Zinn said:</p>
<p>“If you look through high school textbooks and elementary school textbooks in American history, you will find Jackson the frontiersman, soldier, democrat, man of the people — not Jackson the slaveholder, land speculator, executioner of dissident soldiers, exterminator of Indians.”</p>
<p>Radical? Hardly.</p>
<p>Mr. Zinn would protest peacefully for important issues he believed in — against racial segregation, for example, or against the war in Vietnam — and at times he was beaten and arrested for doing so. He was a man of exceptionally strong character who worked hard as a boy growing up in Brooklyn during the Depression. He was a bomber pilot in World War II, and his experience of the unmitigated horror of warfare served as the foundation for his lifelong quest for peaceful solutions to conflict.</p>
<p>He had a wonderful family, and he cherished it. He and his wife, Roslyn, known to all as Roz, were married in 1944 and were inseparable for more than six decades until her death in 2008. She was an activist, too, and Howard’s editor. “I never showed my work to anyone except her,” he said.</p>
<p>They had two children and five grandchildren.</p>
<p>Mr. Zinn was in Santa Monica this week, resting up after a grueling year of work and travel, when he suffered a heart attack and died on Wednesday. He was a treasure and an inspiration. That he was considered radical says way more about this society than it does about him.</p></blockquote>

<p>An Alternate Theory about the Root Cause of the Current Economic Crisis</p>
<p>Bernanke&#8217;s speech in Atlanta a month ago focused a lot of attention on the debate about the forces that led to the current crisis. Was it primarily Greenspan&#8217;s low interest rates, or as Bernanke suggested, was a lack of regulation and oversight a more important issue? Nearly everyone seems to agree that the crisis was brought on by some combination of these factors. In other words, the current situation is viewed almost entirely in financial terms.</p>
<p>While there is no doubt that the financial meltdown was the proximate cause of the current recession, is it possible that a more fundamental cause exists? What if the housing bubble and the financial crisis were merely symptoms of something even bigger&#8212;perhaps of a structural shift occurring in the broader economy?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/11/could-advancing-job-automation.html" target="_blank">argued here previously</a> that advancing automation technology is likely to result in structural unemployment in the future.  In fact, I think this is a trend that is already well underway. The last decade has been characterized by substantial advances in information technology and <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/06_14/b3978116.htm" target="_blank">fairly dramatic increases in productivity.</a>  Average workers have seen stagnant or even decreasing real wages, while health care costs have been exploding. Until the onset of the current crisis, official unemployment numbers were low, but those statistics fail to capture underemployment, such as workers who are forced to work multiple part time jobs with no access to benefits.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />Globalization, of course, gets much of the blame for the plight of average workers, but the reality is that advancing technology has a larger impact. Jobs are not just moving to China&#8212;they are being automated away completely. This is happening not just in the United States <a href="http://www.automationworld.com/webonly-320" target="_blank">but in low wage countries as well.</a>.  And it isn&#8217;t just in manufacturing; <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/11/mythology-of-future-job-market.html" target="_blank">as I&#8217;ve pointed out here previously</a>, service sector and knowledge worker jobs are increasingly subject to automation as well.</p>
<p>As the dual forces of technology and globalization progressed over the past decade, I suspect it became pretty clear to most average workers that holding a job at the prevailing wage offered little hope for getting ahead. Recognition of that reality certainly played an important role in the politics that led to the creation of subprime lending programs. You can make a pretty strong case that the housing bubble was caused not simply by low interest rates but by widespread recognition that investing in a home represented perhaps the only viable hope for a typical American family to achieve any measure of prosperity.</p>
<p>The last decade also saw a massive shift away from consumer spending supported by wages toward spending supported by debt (much of it anchored to inflating housing values). That debt-enabled spending drove economic growth not just in the U.S. but, of course, in China and in the rest of the developing world as well. Was all this really caused by the Fed&#8217;s policy? Or was it fundamentally caused by advancing technology (as well as globalization) driving discretionary incomes down to a level where broad-based consumer spending became unsustainable without reliance on debt?</p>
<p>I think that is a very important question. Virtually all mainstream economists are focused on a financial solution to the current crisis involving some combination of monetary policy, additional stimulus and re-regulation. If it it turns out that the root cause of the crisis is really technology, rather than finance, those solutions will simply not be sufficient in the long run. Technology is relentless. Automation will never stop progressing, and no conventional financial or monetary policy can, by itself, address that issue.</p>
<p>In my book, The Lights in the Tunnel, I make the case that a basic shift is occurring in the economy.  Technology is becoming autonomous, and job automation will invade virtually every employment sector. The result will be structural unemployment and declining wages for all but a tiny (and shrinking) elite. I think it is very possible that the beginning of that trend underlies the current crisis to a significant extent. I suspect that very few people will agree with me on this, but if I&#8217;m right, the implications are scary: it means that virtually everyone is focused on solving the wrong problem.</p>

<blockquote>Amazon.com can kiss my ass. Shorter version: they&#8217;re engaging in monopolistic practices that damn well ought to be illegal, in an attempt to use their near-monopoly position to fuck over authors and bring publishers to heel.</p></blockquote>
<p>Which is more concise than what I said below.  That&#8217;s why he gets, and earns, the Big Bucks (well, Quintessential Quid, in his case).</p>
<p>UPDATE 2:  Via Felix&#8217;s Twitter feed, <a href="http://www.thebigmoney.com/blogs/goodnight-gutenberg/2010/01/30/what-henry-blodget-doesnt-understand-about-e-books?page=full">Marion Maneker at The Big Money corrects Henry Blodgett</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Books are, within reasonable limits, demand-inelastic. Just as movies are. Demand comes from the quality or popularity of the book, not the price. We know this because the great transformation of the book business over the last two decades has been to shift readers from mass-market paperbacks to hardcovers sold at discounted but still higher prices. Readers have been paying more for James Patterson and Dan Brown, not waiting for the cheaper mass market paperbacks.</p>
<p>Consumers trade money for time. And publishers should have the freedom to set their prices at what the market will bear, not what suits Amazon&#8217;s&#8211;or Apple&#8217;s&#8211;needs.</p>
<p>The pricing pressure in books comes not from customer demand but from retailers fighting over market share. That&#8217;s what Barnes &#038; Noble (BKS) did to independent bookstores and Costco did to Barnes &#038; Noble. Now Amazon&#8217;s doing it Costco with the Kindle.</p></blockquote>

                            </p>
                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Robert Waldmann</p>
<p>The Congressional Budget Office is different from you and me.  Their forecasts are authoratative &#8212; literally.  The rules of the House and the Senate refer to CBO estimates and forecasts not some debatable underlying reality.</p>
<p>Hence this <a href="http://pnhp.org/blog/2009/03/02/sen-baucus-wants-cbo-to-be-creative/">slightly edited dialog</a></p>
<p>Sen. Max Baucus, Chairman: [skip]<br />We’re not in the old situation where Sen. Grassley once said whatever CBO says is God, you’re God. My judgement, you’re not God.<br />[skip]<br />Dr. Elmendorf: Senator, may I respectfully disagree  &#8230;</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>OK so the elided text begins </p>
<p>Douglas Elmendorf, CBO Director: Correct</p>
<p>so way back then Elmendorf agreed that He was not God.  At the moment it seems that He and Baucus are the only people who still hold that opinion.</p>
<p>In the awesome missmatch Barack Obama vs the House Republican Study Group where 90% of the brains were in Obama&#8217;s skull, one of the key takedowns was when Mike Pence claimed that Obama had promised to consider a Republican health care proposal and yet he hadn&#8217;t considered the House Republican&#8217;s health care proposal.  Let&#8217;s role the tape</p>
<p>
<blockquote>OBAMA: It&#8217;s not enough, if you say, for example, that we&#8217;ve offered a health care plan </p>
<p>You know, if I&#8217;m told, for example, that the solution to dealing with health care costs is tort reform, something that I&#8217;ve said I am willing to work with you on, but the CBO or other experts say to me, you know, &#8220;At best, this could reduce health care costs relative to where they&#8217;re growing by a couple of percentage points or save $5 billion a year, that&#8217;s what we can score it at, and it will not bend the cost curve long term or reduce premiums significantly,&#8221; then you can&#8217;t make the claim that that&#8217;s the only thing that we have to do.</p></blockquote>
<p>So here Obama is debating Pence about whether the Republicans offered an actual plan and the judge of the debate is Doug Elmendorf, who is, technically not God (yet).</p>
<p>Even more bizarre is this contribution to the debate between Paul Krugman and SAOs (senior administration officials).  Krugman supports hiring subsidies.  They weren&#8217;t in the stimulus plan (but Obama just proposed them &#8212; good luck with the Senate on that).  Krugman basically declares he has been proven right, because the CBO agrees with him.</p>
<p><a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/20/jobs-not-created/">&#8220;the idea was never taken up, and my understanding is that this was due to skepticism on the part of those SAOs. Now maybe they were right — but CBO disagrees. &#8220;</a></p>
<p>OK this is a debate between Nobel Laureate Clark Medalist Paul Krugman and (maybe among others) Clark Medalist Larry Summers and the judge is non Clark Medalist Doug Elmendorf.</p>
<p>I remember back before Doug was God.  Through no merit of my own I was around the sanctum sanctorum of policy relevant economics the NBER.  Krugman and Summers had big offices.  Doug Elmendorf shared as small office with other research assistants.</p>
<p>This cartoon was on the door of that office.</p>

<p>Mike Pence is dumb as a bag of hammers, but he should have been able to understand the cartoon.  I mean he only had to read 3 words.</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t mean to stop blogging for so long.  I apologize.  I also apologize for this post which is one of my occasional screeds against welfare reform.   Oddly there seems to be almost a consensus that welfare reform was a good policy.  I think this is based entirely on the fact that, by pure coincidence, it was implemented during the late 90s boom.  </p>

<p>I comment.</p>
<p>Good points and congratulations on the link from Yglesias. I object very strongly to two words in your post &#8220;welfare reform.&#8221; You write that it was arguably not a &#8220;key component[] of any type of progressive or liberal agenda,&#8221; For the sake of debate, I&#8217;ll scotch the &#8220;arguably&#8221; and interpret &#8220;one can complain&#8221; as meaning &#8220;it is true that.&#8221; Your praising welfare reform with faint damnation is still, to put it as politely as I can, batshit insane. </p>
<p>You do know that there are over <a href="http://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2010/01/03/6-million-list-food-stamps-as-only-income/UPI-21861262550446/">6,000,000 food stamps recipients in the USA with 0 cash income</a> (<a href="http://www.theonion.com/content/amvo/6_million_live_on_only_food_stamps">nothing to live on but food stamps</a>) don&#8217;t you ? I&#8217;d say that situation has a whole whole whole hell of a lot less than nothing to do with &#8221; any type of progressive or liberal agenda,&#8221; It is also true that TANF enrollment has barely increased during the first 16 months of the current recession (<a href="http://www.legalmomentum.org/assets/pdfs/tanf-caseload-down-in-over-22.pdf">warning out of date pdf from an advocacy organization</a> or try <a href="http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/ofa/data-reports/caseload/2009/2009_recipient_tan.htm">the official verrrry slowwwww opening link</a> don&#8217;t blame me blame HHS gluttons for boredom can go to <a href="http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/ofa/data-reports/caseload/caseload_current.htm">the index </a>for maybe more data) and is about one third of peak AFDC enrollment. Welfare reform caused and is causing immense human suffering. There are desperately desperately poor people in the USA (I define that as income less than half the poverty line) because the social safety net was destroyed by a bill signed into law by Clinton. </p>
<p>The perception that welfare reform was good policy or OK policy or not terrible policy is based entirely on the fact that, when it was enacted, the economy was booming. The poor did OK in the late 90s in spite of welfare reform. The non poor did very well. You can&#8217;t judge a policy looking only at events during an extraordinary boom. Look the US poor did very well indeed during the war in Vietnam, but it was terrible policy. I assert that your reasoning is absolutely along the lines of admitting that the war in Vietnam was not a &#8220;key component[] of any type of progressive or liberal agenda.&#8221; I really mean that. Each consists of evaluating a policy only by looking at what happened at the same time. We can&#8217;t blame welfare reform on the filibuster. We can&#8217;t even blame it on the Republicans in congress. They did not have the votes to over ride a veto. Clinton decided not to veto a welfare reform bill. He condemned millions of people to horrible horrible poverty (as opposed to merely horrible poverty without welfare reform). </p>
<p>I also find it odd that you classify NAFTA along with welfare reform. I strongly support NAFTA and I don&#8217;t like hearing it associated with welfare reform. What was wrong with NAFTA ? I&#8217;d consider free trade to be a key component of any progressive or liberal agenda. That is because protection condemns third world workers to horrible horrible horrible poverty. The only case for protection is that it is needed to defend hereditary privilege (the advantage of being born a citizen of a first world country). No decent progressive or liberal can support any such thing. Instead people who want to unite the forces of egalitarians and selfish racists who want to keep the third world poor convince themselves that trade is bad for the third world. </p>
<p>Now, in general, I absolutely agree with your excellent post. It is simply insane to act as if Clinton ran the country when he was President. It is especially insane to act as if he ran the country when the only power he had was the veto. However, he did not use the veto when any decent person would have done so. That&#8217;s a fact and the only excuse would have been that there were 67 senators willing to over ride a veto (there weren&#8217;t 60 senators willing to vote for cloture it passed under reconciliation).</p>

                                <p>by Maggie Mahar<br />crossposted with Health Beat </p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.healthbeatblog.com/2010/01/who-voted-for-brown-in-massachusettsand-why-voters-cannot-oppose-legislation-if-they-dont-understand-it.html">Who Voted for Brown in Massachusetts — and Why?</a> </p>
<p>The media continues to report that the Massachusetts vote was a referendum on health care reform — and that this has the White House worried. If so, the White House is wrong.  Take a look at polling conducted by Hart Research Associates for the AFL-CIO on the evening of the election, revealing who voted for Brown –and what those voters said.  Then consider separate polling done by the Washington Post together with the Kaiser Family Foundation and Harvard University.  Read both reports, and you’ll have a very hard time believing that Scott Brown’s election represents a mandate on healthcare legislation.</p>
<p>Finally, factor in the eye-opening Kaiser Family Foundation January tracking poll,  and what it reveals about what voters do and don’t understand about health reform legislation.  If most voters have only a hazy idea of what is in the legislation, you really can’t say that they voted against the Senate bill.</p>
<p>Who Voted for Brown ? </p>
<p>Democrats who are disillusioned that Obama has not pushed further on health care reform? Upper-middle-class voters who believe that Obama doing too  much, going too far, and may well hike their taxes? No, the surprise is that Brown was elected by Massachusetts’ working class, and they were not focused on health care legislation. </p>
<p>Non-college men voted for Brown by a 27-point margin (59% to 32%), and non-college women also voted for Brown by 13 points (while college women went for Coakley by 13 points).<br /> <br />If you look at all college graduates, Coakley won this election by five points among college graduates, but lost the non-college vote by a 20-point margin. This represents a huge swing among non-college voters since 2008, when Obama won by 21 points, for a net swing of 41 points.<br /> <a name="more"></a><br />What happened? How did Democrats lose so many working class voters?  Many of the non-college voters who chose Obama a year ago were Latinos and African Americans. This time, they stayed at home, according to  election eve and election night polling done jointly by the Republican firm <a target="_blank" href="http://dyn.politico.com/printstory.cfm?uuid=57E6E10A-18FE-70B2-A8D34DD1CF39BA36">American Viewpoint and the Democratic group, Lake Research Partners</a> on behalf of the nonpartisan group Women’s Voices. WomenVote. (Unmarried women and younger voters also came out in fewer numbers. ) <br /> <br />Keep in mind that a minority of white voters pulled the lever for Obama in 2008—he needed non-white voters to carry him over the top. Apparently this time Democratic organizers in Massachusetts didn’t work very hard to bring out their vote, or to explain to minority communities that, even if they didn’t particularly warm up either candidate  (which I can well imagine), this vote could be important for health care reform. <br /> <br />The Hart poll was done on the evening of January 19, when pollsters conducted a telephone survey among 810 voters in the special election for U.S. Senate in Massachusetts. The survey has a margin of error of ±3.8 percentage points. (The pollsters note that “the survey data were weighted to be consistent with the actual election results, yielding a five-point margin for Brown &#8211;50% Brown, 45% Coakley, 1% other candidates, 4% refused).<br /> <br />In the end, the pollsters observe that the results of this election “were not a call to abandon national health care reform.”  82% of voters were aware of Scott Brown&#8217;s opposition to health care legislation supported by President Obama and congressional Democrats, but “it had virtually no net impact on the Senate election.”  Here is the money line:  <br /> <br />“Those who knew Brown’s position [on reform] were as likely to say it made them less likely (39%) to support him as to say it made them more likely to support him (41%).”<br /> <br />A few HealthBeat readers have suggested that Massachusetts elected Brown because they have seen health care reform in their own state, and do not like it. But the poll reveals that two-thirds (67%) favor the Massachusetts health insurance law that ensures nearly universal coverage, including 53% of Brown voters <br /> <br />Moreover, the poll confirms HealthBeat reader Pat S’s argument that the vote had more to do with personality than issues: “Considerable evidence exists that this election was largely about the individual candidates, Coakley and Brown, more than a referendum on President Obama or the Democratic agenda.” <br /> <br />By 61% to 33%, Massachusetts voters said they were picking the best candidate to be their U.S. senator, rather than “sending a message to Washington.” Drill down, and look only at Brown’s voters, and you’ll find that they, too, say they were selecting the best candidate, not sending a message to Washington about the direction of the country (52% to 42%). People simply liked Scott Brown better. His personal rating from voters was 51% positive to 32% negative (net +19 points), while Coakley had much weaker personal ratings at 40% positive and 37% negative.<br /> <br />Voters were not expressing dislike for the president: Massachusetts’ electorate give Obama much better ratings than Coakley (52% positive, 33% negative), and approval of the job he is doing (52% approve, 38% disapprove).<br /> <br />Insofar as they were voting on issues, those polled reported that they were most concerned about the economy and jobs. Electing a candidate “who will strengthen the economy and create more good jobs” was the single most /very important factor according to 79% of those polled.</p>
<p>Health care reform placed a distant second:  “Electing a candidate who is committed to controlling health care costs and covering the uninsured” (single most/very important factor) among only 54% of all voters. The working class voters who elected Brown have been hit hard by the economy. That is their immediate concern. As Hart notes:</p>
<p>“Economic dissatisfaction played a large role in Brown’s victory. The majority of voters who said the Massachusetts economy is not so good or poor (52%) voted for Brown by 56% to 39%. However, voters who said the economy was excellent, good, or fair supported Coakley by 52% to 43%.”</p>
<p>A Second Poll <br /> <br />Over at the Washington Post, Ezra Klein reports on the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp">Post/ Kaiser/ Harvard poll</a> srv/politics/polls/WaPoKaiserHarvard_MassPoll_Jan22.pdf , a second survey that tried to determine <a target="_blank" href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/ezra-klein/">why voters chose Brown</a>.</p>
<p>This Washington Post-Kaiser-Harvard poll was conducted by conventional and cellular telephone Jan. 20-21, among a random sample of 880 voters in the Massachusetts special election. The margin of sampling error for the sample of voters is plus or minus four percentage points. <br /> <br />After reviewing the results, <a target="_blank" href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/ezra-klein/">Klein observes</a>: </p>
<p>“The results make it untenable to argue that the election had nothing to do with national issues in general or health-care reform in particular. But it makes it similarly hard to argue that the state is firmly opposed to health-care reform, or that Scott Brown&#8217;s election is a mandate against the bill.” .    <br /> <br />I agree, but I would go further. When I took a close look at the questions and the results in the Post/Kaiser/Harvard poll, I discovered that it tended to confirm much of the Hart research. <br /> <br />First, 91% of Brown’s voters considered the economy and jobs “extremely important or very important” compared to 84% of Coakley’s voters. </p>
<p>More importantly, 88% of Brown’s voters thought “leadership and personal qualities” were “extremely important or very important” compared to just 69% of Coakley’s voters. (This supports the notion that, to a large degree the folks who picked Brown were selecting someone they liked, without worrying as much about the issues. )<br /> <br />Granted, 93% of Brown’s voters said that health care reform is “extremely important or very important,” but as Ezra notes,<br />“48 percent of Brown&#8217;s voters think  that Brown should work with Democrats on the health-care reform bill rather than partner with Republicans to sink the effort altogether. Which suggests that though Brown&#8217;s election was far from an affirmation of President Obama&#8217;s agenda, nor was it a call for relentless obstruction.” <br /> <br />There are many contradictions in the way Brown voters responded to the Washington Post/Kaiser/Harvard poll’s questions. (This is not unusual. Human beings are, well, peculiar creatures. We often disagree with ourselves.  And Brown&#8217;s voters do not all agree with each other.) On the one hand the vast majority of Brown voters who were polled  say they are opposed to the health reform legislation—but their reasons for disliking it vary widely. Many in the media have suggested that those who voted for Brown were disgusted by all of the deal-making and the way Democrats cave to special interests. </p>
<p>But when Brown voters who said that healthcare was “extremely” or “very important” were asked to be more specific, only 13% of Brown voters said they “Didn’t like the way it was being handled; politics; deal-making; closed doors lack of transparency.&#8221; <br /> <br />What is striking is just  how varied the responses were: </p>
<p>&#8211; Nine percent of Brown voters said healthcare is important because they “generally support reform or the current bill.  Just 22 percent said they put healthcare reform near or at the top of their list because they are generally opposed to reform or the current bill.  <br /> <br />&#8211; Fourteen percent said healthcare is important because they’re concerned about the cost of the bill—increased taxes, government spending and the deficit.<br /> <br />&#8211; Twelve percent of Brown voters said health care reform mattered to them because they are opposed to government involvement in health care. <br /> <br />What may be most telling is that among Brown voters who think health care and health care reform is “extremely or very important”  only 2%  agreed that “everyone should have health care; healthcare is a right.” <br /> <br />When explaining why healthcare is important to them, none named the “need for more/better coverage for the uninsured.” This suggests that many of Brown’s voters  may be opposed to the legislation because they are opposed to the basic idea of universal coverage—whatever form the legislation takes. <br /> <br />By contrast, when explaining why they are focused on healthcare 21 percent of Coakley’s voters said “everyone should have healthcare; it is a right;” and 8 percent mentioned the need for better coverage for the poor. <br /> <br />This suggests that many of Brown’s voters are conservatives or libertarians who don’t believe that a civilized country has a responsibility to make healthcare available to everyone.  They believe in “personal responsibility.” Everyone should take care of themselves and their own families. <br /> <br />The fact that so many African-Americans, Latinos, didn’t turn out helped skew the results; the majority in these communities do believe that healthcare is a right.  </p>
<p>How Can People Oppose Legislation They Don’t Understand? <br /> <br />But the strongest argument suggesting that the Massachusetts vote was not a vote against reform can be found in a Kaiser Family Foundation study that polled households shortly before the Massachusetts election. http://www.kff.org/kaiserpolls/8042.cfm The survey showed voters sharply divided on the legislation along Democratic and Republican party lines, with Independents evenly divided (41 percent support the legislation; 43 percent don’t) <br /> <br />But most importantly, the polling showed that most voters have only a dime idea of what is in the bill. According to Kaiser, “The poll finds that even after a year of substantial media coverage of the health reform debate, many Americans remain unfamiliar with key elements of the major bills passed by the House and Senate.” <br /> <br />&#8211; Nearly 40 percent did not know that the bill would prohibit insurers from denying coverage because of pre-existing conditions.<br /> <br />&#8211; The majority of seniors had no idea that the Senate bill would help close the Medicare “doughnut hole” so that seniors would no longer face a period of having to pay the full cost of their medications.<br /> <br />&#8211; Forty-eight percent of all Americans had not heard that the legislation would offer tax credits to small businesses to help them buy insurance for their employees.<br /> <br />&#8211; Forty-one percent are not aware that if they have employer-based insurance, the reform legislation will not change existing arrangements. <br /> <br />&#8211; More than one quarter of all Americans had no idea that reform legislation would provide subsidies to help low-income families buy insurance. <br /> <br />&#8211; Thirty-seven percent did not realize that insurers would be forced to provide a basic benefit package, defined by the government—no more “Swiss Cheese policies” filled with holes.<br /> <br />&#8211; Sixty-three percent were unaware that insurers will no longer be allowed to charge women more. <br /> <br />In each case, those polled  responded more favorably to the legislation as they heard about these provisions.  For instance, when they were told about the tax credits for small businesses 73 percent said they would be more likely to support the bill. <br /> <br />In general, the more respondents learned about the bill, the more positive they were. “It’s one thing to talk about the public’s perception of health care reform legislation, which right now is in some ways negative, but it’s another to tell people what’s actually in the bill and when you do that people are more positive,” said Kaiser President and CEO Drew Altman.<br /> <br />Why do so few Americans know what is actually in the legislation? A blizzard of misinformation has created much confusion. In newspapers and on television, you regularly hear that ordinary Americans will be forced to buy insurance they cannot afford (no mention of subsidies or caps on out-of-pocket payments which should virtually eliminate medical bankruptcies.) You read that small businesses won’t be able to afford a mandate (no mention of tax credits.)  <br /> <br />Americans have been told that the Democrats are making no effort to rein in spending (no mention of the pages and pages of proposals that would cut Medicare costs, paving the way for lower health care bills throughout the system.) They are warned  that Medicare beneficiaries will be hurt (no explanation that Medicare cuts are targeting unnecessary care that puts patients at risk without benefits; no mention that the bill will help close the donut hole that now forces Medicare patients to pay for their drugs out-of-pocket.)  <br /> <br />We have been told that insurers will continue business as usual (no mention of the provision that prevents them from putting a lifetime cap on benefits, or the plank in the legislation which says that insurers must spend a certain percentage of the premiums they receive on healthcare.  If they don’t spend it, they are required to  give their customers a partial refund.) <br /> <br />The other reason most people aren’t aware of what the Senate bill would do is because they are busy. They are working. They are raising children. They don’t have time to pay attention to the devilish details. In some cases, they don’t have the education or the powers of concentration needed to absorb and analyze this legislation. That’s not what they do for a living. <br /> <br />Why can’t some of the analysts boil the bill down to a few pages, and six power-points?  Because the benefits are all in the details, and often those details are interlocking. You cannot understand one without understanding another.  (I’ve written a three-part post that tries to cover all of the important points&#8212;both the pros and the cons. See Glass Half-Empty, Glass Half-Full, parts 1, 2 and 3) <br /> <br />But the truth is that re-forming a $2.6 trillion industry that serves (or at least should serve) millions of very different people—young and old, sick and healthy, poor, working-class, middle-class, upper-middle-class and wealthy requires thousands and thousands of adjustments. Just spelling out what will be covered requires many pages, and many amendments. <br /> <br />For instance, did you know that the legislation would require that insurers cover vision and dental care for children?  That’s just one of those adjustments that will make all of the difference for some families.<br /> <br />&#8211; Finally, it is true that some Americans are strongly opposed to both the Senate bill and any reform legislation.<br /> <br />As Kaiser’s January tracking poll observes: “Views on the proposed legislation seem indelibly partisan: A solid majority of Democrats (64 percent) support the proposals being discussed, while an even larger majority of Republicans (76 percent) oppose it. When it comes to the enthusiasm gap, strong feelings are significantly more predominant on the right, with twice as many Republicans saying they ‘strongly oppose’ the proposed legislation as Democrats saying they ‘strongly support’ it.&#8221;  <br /> <br />“Political independents, that critical swing group, are divided down the middle: with 41 percent supportive and 43 percent opposed.”<br /> <br />The bottom line is this: the Massachusetts special election does not serve as a referendum on health care legislation. The voters who chose Brown chose him for myriad reasons. They say that they knew he opposed the legislation; about half of his voters counted this in his favor, while half counted it against him. Go figure. <br /> <br />The White House should ignore the Massachusetts election.<br /> <br />Nationwide, most voters have only a sketchy idea of what is in the bill. . So it’s impossible to talk about whether they favor or oppose current legislation. People can’t reject something they don’t understand – unless they are simply against reform on first principles, i.e. they don’t believe in universal coverage.</p>
