                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Whereas <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/11/18/congress.budgetcuts.ap/index.html">President Bush</a> has praise for the small reduction in overall spending passed by the House arm-twisting hoping to reduce aid for the poor and education, he objects when the <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/11/18/senate.taxes.ap/index.html">Senate</a> sprinkles in a few energy tax increases to partially offset the tax cut extensions dubbed by Senator Santorum as the <em>Tax Increase Prevention Act</em>.  So neither the GOP Congressional leadership not the White House has any real intention of restoring fiscal sanity.  </p>
<p>So where does one turn at the end of this week for any sense of sanity at all?  Maybe we should go back to Saturday when <a href="http://www.markarkleiman.com/archives/2005/11/index.html">Michael</a> wrote a speech for a real leader:<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;We can have a high-service government, with good schools, recreation, humane welfare, excellent environmental policies, and all the rest of it: we&#8217;re rich and lucky. But we can only have those things if we&#8217;re willing to pay the taxes that pay for them. We can also have a low-service government, and leave people to arrange their schooling and other services privately, with low taxes. Of course the rich will have a lot more success at this than the poor, in big houses on large lots with a swimming pool in back, but it&#8217;s a legitimate political choice.  Those are the only two paths for us. There is no high-service, low-tax future for California, and I&#8217;m not going to promise you one. If you want a governor who will lie to you about having good schools, great universities, and up-to-date transportation with no heavy lifting by anyone, you can vote for him in the next election, but this administration is about treating each other like grownups and telling the truth. There is certainly waste and abuse in California; there always is. But there isn&#8217;t anything like enough to pay for what we used to enjoy with the taxes we pay now, even if we could completely stamp it out.&#8221; </p></blockquote>
<p>If one alters California to the United States, this would be the speech that we would like to hear from our President.  Of course, we will have to wait another three-plus years to hear it.  But as Michael explains, he was talking about <em>Arnold Schwarzenegger’s Real Failure</em>:<br />
<blockquote>What California needed Arnold to do was to speak some plain truths about the choices facing the state … Of course he said nothing of the kind, and will be remembered as a mountebank and a lightweight.</p></blockquote>
<p>When ARNOLD was campaigning to replace Gray Davis as our governor, I grew tired of the suggestion that ARNOLD was a liberal Republican.  But I also grow tired of the mantra that George W. Bush is a conservative.  ARNOLD and Bush are exactly the same – neither a liberal nor a conservative.  The better description of these two is that they are frauds.  They certainly are not leaders.</p>
<p><em><strong>Update</strong></em>: <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_comment/tamny200511180923.asp">John Tamny</a> remains confused as to the difference between Keynesian business cycles and long-term growth:<br />
<blockquote>Despite clear evidence that the marginal rate cuts of the 1920s, ’60s, and ’80s (not to mention the 2003 tax cuts) led to higher revenues, Sen. George Voinovich (R., Ohio) recently said that “contrary to what some of my colleagues believe, tax cuts do not pay for themselves.” Stealing from the class-struggle line used so effectively by the Democrats, Rep. Mike Castle (R., Pa.) decried tax-cut extension for “reducing programs that could affect the poor and working poor.” … Returning to Lloyd Bentsen, back in 1980 he argued for marginal tax-rate cuts for their ability to improve “the productivity performance of the economy over the long term.” Republicans should intuitively take to Bentsen’s past reasoning, and at least a few Democrats should jump on board too. </p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, Bentsen was also for fiscal responsibility as in finding someway to actually pay for the tax cuts.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>While <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/11/lying-just-not-under-oath.html">Kash</a> covers some recent revelations about the 2001 Cheney energy task force, <a href="http://www.econbrowser.com/archives/2005/11/oil_grilling.html">James Hamilton</a> designs an exam essay question:<br />
<blockquote>Sometimes I like to base exam questions for my students on recent news. Here&#8217;s an exam question to see how thoroughly students understand the economic issues associated with today&#8217;s allegations about oil companies and the Cheney energy task force.</p></blockquote>
<p>Dr. Hamilton has already received some interesting answers that addressed what might have happened had Congress passed the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/energy/National-Energy-Policy.pdf">Bush proposals</a>. The first question on his exam asked the student to:<br />
<blockquote>Discuss in detail three elements of this plan that led to an increase in oil prices.</p></blockquote>
<p>Actually, the proposals from yours truly and <a href="http://voxbaby.blogspot.com/2005/11/gas-tax-redux.html">Andrew Samwick</a> to impose higher taxes on oil and/or gasoline might be seen as price-increasing whereas the Bush-Cheney proposal was all about subsidizing oil suppliers.  OK, the proposal only used the term subsidy once but talked about tax credits almost 30 times.  The proposal had several other places where taxpayer funds would be used to subsidize energy.  </p>
<p>Which is precisely why I’m elated that it did not pass – and I’m hoping nothing like this boondoggle ever will get through Congress.  Before the average Joe who is paying a lot for gasoline decides that Dr. Samwick and I have gone nuts and the Bush&#038;Cheney were looking out for their interests, let’s consider the incidence of a subsidy when the supply curve inelasticity is very small.  A subsidy might be seen as reducing the price consumers pay but it also increases the amount suppliers receive – with the lion’s share of the benefit accruing to the supplier.  Conversely, a tax along the lines that Dr. Samwick and I are suggesting would slightly increase the price consumers pay but the lion’s share of the impact would be on oil company profits. </p>
<p>Of course, the average Joe might counter that Bush&#038;Cheney lowered their taxes by a modest amount.  But remember that the massive increase in Federal deficits under their watch means deferred taxes have increased a lot.  And who will pay all those deferred taxes?  The shareholders of the oil companies or average Joe?  It seems Bush&#038;Cheney refuse to say.</p>
<p>Then again, the GOP leadership has <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/11/18/congress.budgetcuts.ap/index.html">twisted</a> a few arms to take food from the mouth of children, which would pay down a few pennies of this staggering debt.  Of course, I may have to eat crow for <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/11/gop-split-saves-pork-but-also-saves.html">this</a>.  But hey I own oil company stock and have a good day job, so I can afford some wine with my crow.</p>

                                <p>It seems the war between sensible moderate Republicans and their rightwing party leaders insures that government spending will not be reduced.  <a href="http://www.thehill.com/thehill/export/TheHill/News/Frontpage/111605/news3.html">Arlen Specter</a> wanted to slash pork barrel spending, which alas angered the conservatives who only pretend to be fiscally responsible:<br />
<blockquote>Sen. Arlen Specter (R-Pa.), has angered colleagues facing reelection in 2006 by cutting $1 billion in pet projects from his subcommittee’s spending bill to pay for programs popular with Democrats and centrist Republicans. Historically, the labor, health and human services, and education bill is one of the most project-loaded of the annual spending bills, say congressional observers who track what they denounce as pork-barrel spending.</p></blockquote>
<p>OK, Robert Byrd is also unhappy about proposed reductions in pork.  I guess there is some bipartisan support for loading our kids with deferred tax liabilities.  <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2005/11/17/revolt">Thinkprogress</a> notes that the rightwingers wanted the cuts in support for education and assistance to the poor so they could join Senator Byrd in their pork fest.  Pork over assistance to the poor does seem to be the “priorities” of this Administration even as they continue to add nearly $600 billion a year to the Federal debt.</p>
<p><em>Update</em>: Lawrence Kudlow in <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/kudlow/kudlow200511171217.asp">What I Learned This Week</a> predicted:<br />
<blockquote>GOP Congress will pass a sizable tax- and budget-cutting fiscal plan</p></blockquote>
<p>More bad timing on Larry’s part.  But what did he learn?</p>
<blockquote><p>The boat-building business is booming, with big backlogs for boats in the $80,000 to $300,000 price range. Why is this important? Prosperity. People buy luxury items when they’ve got the money to do so. This is a very positive economic-growth indicator … Ben Bernanke is a real smart guy with a good idea for a numerical inflation target. But investors were turned off when he testified before the Senate this week in his bid to replace Alan Greenspan at the Federal Reserve.</p></blockquote>
<p>It seems – according to Larry – that Bernanke will follow Greenspan’s lead on making sure inflation does not accelerate.  But wasn’t it Larry’s NRO colleagues that were concerned Bernanke would not be tough on inflation?  I wish the folks at NRO would make up their minds on such matters.</p>
<p><em><strong>Update II</strong></em>: <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/11/17/congress.spending.ap/index.html">CNN</a> captures some of the various reactions to the no vote including this one:<br />
<blockquote>Republicans said they may have lost votes because this year&#8217;s bill, down $1.5 billion from last year, included no special projects or earmarks for lawmakers. &#8220;You take those out and you lose the incentive,&#8221; said Rep. Tom Davis, a Virginia Republican, who voted for the bill.</p></blockquote>
<p>Is Congressman Davis saying the only incentive for him to support education and aid to the poor is for Congress to also include pork barrel spending for his fat cat contributors?  Maybe this attitude is what is wrong with our GOP leaders – and their inability to manage our taxpayer money responsibly.</p>

                                <p>Interestingly, Bush and Cheney seem to be quite willing to alienate independent and moderate voters.  Cheney says that people who question the administration&#8217;s handling of Iraq intelligence before the US invasion are &#8220;<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/16/AR2005111601853.html">dishonest and reprehensible</a>&#8220;, while Bush calls those who criticise his decision to go to war when they first supported it &#8220;<a href="http://www.voanews.com/english/2005-11-17-voa15.cfm">irresponsible</a>&#8220;.</p>
<p>It turns out that, in so doing, Bush and Cheney are describing a substantial portion of the American public.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.pollingreport.com/iraq.htm">Polls</a> pretty consistently show that about 55%-60% of the American public now thinks that the Iraq invasion was a mistake.  In fact, about half of those people who now think Iraq was a mistake actually thought that invading Iraq was a good idea in March 2003.  So when Bush tries to demonstrate that some Democrats are &#8220;irresponsible&#8221; and &#8220;rewriting history&#8221; by contrasting their statements of support for Bush in 2002 with their current criticisms of Bush, he is also implicitly applying those same labels to the one-third of Americans who have gone through the same disillusionment with Bush&#8217;s Iraq policies.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, about 55%-60% of Americans now think that the Bush administration misused the intelligence evidence that was available before the invasion, up from around 40% in March 2003.  Cheney apparently think that those people are &#8220;reprehensible&#8221;.</p>
<p>Does it seem like a good strategy for the White House to label large fractions of the American people &#8211; and almost certainly the vast majority of the one-third of Americans who consider themselves politically independent or moderate &#8211; &#8220;irresponsible&#8221; and &#8220;reprehensible&#8221;?  Personally, I don&#8217;t think that such attacks are going to do much to make moderate and independent voters like the Republican party.</p>

<blockquote>NEW YORK (CNN/Money) &#8211; The pace of home building slowed sharply in October as higher mortgage rates began to bite, a government report showed Thursday, in the latest sign that the housing boom may have peaked. Housing starts fell to an annual rate of 2.01 million in October from a revised 2.13 million pace in September, the Commerce Department reported, while economists surveyed by Briefing.com had forecast a reading of 2.06 million.</p>
<p>While a pace of 2 million new housing projects a year is still strong, the reading was the second weakest of 2005.</p>
<p>Building permits, seen as a measure of how home builders view the market, sank to an annual rate of 2.07 million from 2.22 million in September, again coming in well below Wall Street forecasts.</p>
<p>The report comes on the heels of surveys of realtors that suggested a softening housing market and a separate survey that showed a big drop in home builders&#8217; confidence. </p></blockquote>

                                <p>Yesterday <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/11/nafta-stopler-samuelson-and-wage.html">PGL provided us</a> with a nice example of how simple theoretical trade models (such as the Stolper-Samuelson model) may tell us little about the actual effects of trade.  His post reminded me of another good paper that attempted to take a close look at how the Mexican economy has fared since joining NAFTA: Aaron Tornell, Frank Westermann, Lorenza Martinez, &#8220;<a href="http://papers.nber.org/papers/w10289">NAFTA and Mexico&#8217;s Less-Than-Stellar Performance</a>&#8220;.  </p>
<p>The paper quite convincingly points out that lots of things have happened to Mexico&#8217;s economy over the past decade, and it is difficult to attribute Mexico&#8217;s poor economic performance to NAFTA.  From their abstract:<br />
<blockquote>Mexico, a prominent liberalizer, failed to attain stellar gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the 1990s, and since 2001 its GDP and exports have stagnated. In this paper we argue that the lack of spectacular growth in Mexico&#8230; [is due to] the lack of further judicial and structural reform after 1995&#8230; The key to the Mexican puzzle lies in Mexico&#8217;s response to crisis: a deterioration in contract enforceability and an increase in nonperforming loans&#8230; The credit crunch has hit the nontradables sector especially hard and has generated bottlenecks, which have blocked growth in the tradables sector and have contributed to the recent fall in exports.</p></blockquote>
<p>In brief, they argue that the Mexican economy has suffered from some serious problems with their domestic financial institutions, not from trade.  A non-technical summary of the paper can be found <a href="http://www.nber.org/digest/sep04/w10289.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>But the point I&#8217;d really like to make is not about whether trade is good or bad.  Instead, I think that what this paper (as well as the one PGL cited yesterday) best illustrates is that the link between cause and effect is often not easy or obvious.  Economies are constantly being affected by a myriad of economic forces, both external and domestic.  As such, it is dangerous to casually say that any one particular economic force must be causing any one particular economic outcome.  The world is extremely complicated, and there&#8217;s no reason to think that economic relationships are anything but extremely complicated as well.</p>

                                <p>Karl Rove sent us his chief <a href="http://www.newsday.com/news/politics/wire/sns-ap-cheney-iraq,0,3658896.story?coll=sns-ap-politics-headlines">attack dog</a> tonight:<br />
<blockquote>Vice President Dick Cheney added his voice on Wednesday to the chorus of Republican criticism of Democrats who have accused the Bush administration of manipulating intelligence on Iraq, calling it &#8220;one of the most dishonest and reprehensible charges ever aired in this city.&#8221;  &#8220;Some of the most irresponsible comments have, of course, come from politicians who actually voted in favor of authorizing force against Saddam Hussein,&#8221; Cheney told the Frontiers of Freedom Institute, a conservative policy group.</p></blockquote>
<p>For Cheney to suggest we Democrats are being dishonest is a bit rich – especially given the fact that <a href="http://americablog.blogspot.com/2005/11/dick-cheney-who-outright-lied-to.html">Henry Waxman</a> has documented 51 times that Cheney misled the country about Iraq.</p>
<p>Hey Dick – if you wish to have a discussion as to the integrity – or lack thereof – of those of us who opposed this invasion versus yourself, we have three words for you: <strong>BRING IT ON</strong>.</p>
<p>Update: Senator Kerry responds:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is hard to name a government official with less credibility on Iraq than Vice President Cheney. The Vice President continues to mislead America about how we got into Iraq and what must be done to complete the still unaccomplished mission.</p></blockquote>
<p>Exactly!  But I&#8217;d like to take address a couple of other matter starting with this sentence:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The saddest part is that our people in uniform have been subjected to these cynical and pernicious falsehoods day in and day out&#8221;.</p></blockquote>
<p>PERNICIOUS! Wow &#8211; Cheney&#8217;s speechwriters love to do this &#8211; send him to a safe location (speech before other rightwingers) to use fancy terminology that causes us to pick up our dictionary to find out he meant &#8220;deadly&#8221;.  Of course, had he been plain spoken, some might realize that it was his falsehoods that led our soldiers in harm&#8217;s way.  </p>
<p>I loved what <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/11/16/cheney/index.html">Senator Hagel</a> said:<br />
<blockquote>Hagel on Tuesday defended the right to criticize the White House&#8217;s war policies in a speech to the Council on Foreign Relations &#8230; &#8220;The Bush administration must understand that each American has a right to question our policies in Iraq and should not be demonized for disagreeing with them,&#8221; Hagel said, according to a transcript on the council&#8217;s Web site.  &#8220;To question your government is not unpatriotic &#8212; to not question your government is unpatriotic,&#8221; said Hagel, who was decorated for his military service in Vietnam.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes &#8211; during Vietnam War, we got the same garbage from the White House.  And let&#8217;s remember that Hagel and Kerry served during this war, whereas Five Deferment Dick did not.</p>
<p>President Bush is backing Cheney (surprise) and laughably claims that he does not mind criticism.  But he does mind people using their positions of authority irresponsibly.  Remind me &#8211; who was the Commander-in-Chief who used his position of authority to irresponsibly lead this nation into war for partisan purposes?</p>

<blockquote>Today, Americans pay an average of 45.9 cents in taxes per gallon of gas. The federal gas tax is 18.4 cents per gallon while the average state and local tax is 27.5 cents. These taxes pumped more than $54 billion into federal and state coffers last year alone. Diesel taxes totaled $9 billion more.  Almost all gas taxes are levied at a flat rate per gallon, regardless of whether a gallon of gas costs $1.49, $2.49, or $3.49. So while industry profits go through booms and busts, government profits grow steadily larger.</p></blockquote>
<p>If one takes a look at their graph of fuel tax in real terms – it appears that we have not seen much of an increase in real tax revenues over the past 12 years even as real GDP has increased by approximately 20%.  If one takes a look at the yellow line in the second graph of <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/11/gasoline-market-and-government-policy.html">this post</a>, one might realize why – it turns out that we were paying around 50 cents in taxes per gallon of gas back in 1999 and now we are paying less – in real terms.</p>

<p>AB readers have to go beyond theory and discuss the evidence from NAFTA.  I shall address one piece of evidence shortly but I could not resist commenting on this from Kash:<br />
<blockquote>In fact, all economists learn about this theoretical reality, known as the Stolper-Samuelson theorem, in their very first course in international trade, and rehash it in every other course about trade that they ever take or teach during the course of their career.  Despite its theoretically interesting result, let me suggest that the Stopler-Samuelson theorem doesn&#8217;t really tell us anything about how harmful trade is.</p></blockquote>
<p>While Stopler-Samuelson &#8211; which is grounded in a simple two-good, two factor of production framework – cannot hope to capture all of reality, let’s think about how its prediction compares to the Ross Perot prediction that the passage of NAFTA would be immediately followed by a “giant sucking sound” of job opportunities fleeing the U.S.  First of all, Stopler-Samuelson assumes that good macroeconomic policies assure that we stay at full employment &#8211; a reasonable assumption given the good fortune that we had an economic policy team that was actually listened to by policy makers when NAFTA was implemented.  But given the fact that Mexico’s capital-labor ratio was lower than that of the U.S., standard factor price equalization logic would hold that U.S. wages would fall, while Mexican wages would rise.  Here is where Josh might object:<br />
<blockquote>Trade, on the other hand, is fully predictable in its impacts on the US: it leads to losses for the worst-positioned and benefits for the already well-off. </p></blockquote>
<p>Given the relative size of our two economies, it would seem reasonable to think that the impact of NAFTA would have been felt most strongly in the Mexican labor market.  So did all Mexican workers gain from NAFTA?  <a href="http://irpshome.ucsd.edu/faculty/gohanson">Gordon Hanson</a> has examined the evidence in <a href="http://irpshome.ucsd.edu/faculty/gohanson/mexico_wages.pdf"> What Has Happened to Wages in Mexico since NAFTA? Implications for Hemispheric Free Trade</a> (see also <a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w9563">NBER</a>): <br />
<blockquote>In this paper, I examine the impacts of trade and investment liberalization on the wage structure of Mexico. Part one of the paper surveys recent literature on the labor-market consequences of Mexico’s economic reforms in the 1980’s. Mexico’s policy reforms appear to have raised the demand for skill in the country, reduced rents in industries that prior to reform paid their workers high wages, and raised the premium paid to workers in states along the U.S. border. These changes have resulted in an increase in wage dispersion in the country. Part two of the paper examines changes in Mexico’s wage structure during the 1990’s. In the last decade, Mexico has experienced rising returns to skill, which mirror closely wage movements in the United States. There is, however, little evidence of wage convergence between the two countries. Regional wage differentials in Mexico have widened and appear to be explained largely by variation in regional access to foreign trade and investment and in regional opportunities for migration to the United States. I discuss implications of Mexico’s experience for the rest of Latin America in the event a Free Trade Agreement of the Americas is enacted.</p></blockquote>
<p>An increase in wage dispersion does not sound like a “win-win” to me.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>This story from the front page of today&#8217;s <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/15/AR2005111501842.html">Washington Post</a> is interesting:<br />
<blockquote><strong>Document Says Oil Chiefs Met With Cheney Task Force</strong> </p>
<p>White House document shows that executives from big oil companies met with Vice President Cheney&#8217;s energy task force in 2001 &#8212; something long suspected by environmentalists but denied as recently as last week by industry officials testifying before Congress.</p>
<p>The document, obtained this week by The Washington Post, shows that officials from Exxon Mobil Corp., Conoco (before its merger with Phillips), Shell Oil Co. and BP America Inc. met in the White House complex with the Cheney aides who were developing a national energy policy, parts of which became law and parts of which are still being debated.</p>
<p>In a joint hearing last week of the Senate Energy and Commerce committees, the chief executives of Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp. and ConocoPhillips said their firms did not participate in the 2001 task force.</p></blockquote>
<p>I wonder if today&#8217;s WaPost scoop sheds any light on the following odd detail that some people picked up on (e.g. <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2005/11/9/121726/573">Kos</a>) during the hearings about recent oil industry profits last week: Republican Senators apparently deviated from practice and did not require the oil executives to swear to tell the truth before their Congressional testimony.  </p>
<p>It&#8217;s probably coincidence&#8230; But it does raise some interesting questions if the two stories are connected, because it suggests the possibility that someone among the Senate Republicans suspected that the oil industry executives were going to have to lie about the Cheney task force&#8230;</p>
