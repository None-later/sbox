                                <p>I may have been too hard on Congressman Martin’s Sabo suggestion to increase the interest rate on Treasury bonds in the Social Security trust fund in <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/02/david-frum-flip-flops-on-value-of.html">this post</a>.  I realized this as I re-read the brilliant critique of the recommendations of the Bush Social Security commission from <a href="http://www.cbpp.org/6-18-02socsec.pdf">Peter Diamond and Peter Orszag</a>.  Page 26 of their <em>Reducing Benefits and Subsidizing Individual Accounts: An Analysis of the Plans Proposed by the President’s Commission to Strengthen Social Security </em>has a box entitled <em>Subsidizing the Individual Accounts Through a Low Interest Rate on the Liability Accounts</em>:</p>
<blockquote><p>By charging an interest rate on the liability accounts that is lower than the rate the Trust Fund earns on its balances, Models 2 and 3 impose costs on the Social Security system and subsidize the individual accounts. To see this, imagine $100 that is diverted from the Trust Fund into an individual account under Model 2. The $100 diverted into the individual account would trigger an entry of $100 in the worker’s liability account. Model 2 charges an interest rate on the liability accounts of 2 percent per year (after inflation). If the worker were 40 years away from retirement, the interest charges would cause the $100 entry to grow to $221 (in constant dollars) by the end of the worker’s career. If the $100 had been retained by the Trust Fund, however, it would have grown to $326 by the time the worker retired. The difference between the amount in the liability account ($221) and the amount that would have accrued in the Trust Fund ($326) represents a subsidy to the individual account and a loss to the Trust Fund. Such a subsidy arises whenever the interest rate on the liability account is below the interest rate the Trust Fund earns on its reserves.</p></blockquote>
<p>What’s going on with these two very different proposals?  The Federal government can be thought of as two divisions: the Social Security Trust Fund and the General Fund (OK, the latter has many subdivisions).  If the government is thought of as some multinational enterprise with multiple divisions, then the intercompany interest rate could diverge from the arm’s length rate as defined by <a href="http://www.intltaxlaw.com/SHARED/TRANSFER/regs.htm#Regs.%20%C2%A7%201.482-2">section 1.482-2(a)</a> of the U.S. Treasury regulations.  </p>
<p>Multinationals could potentially set non-arm’s length interest rates.  At times, they think appealing to the “safe harbor” of the Applicable Federal Rate (AFR) curtails the IRS from challenging non-arm’s length rates.  One should note, however, that the AFR is set to track market rates.</p>
<p>In a similar fashion, President Bush’s commission advocated having below market rates paid to the Trust Fund, which would clearly worsen any alleged shortfall.  Why would the White House want to do so?  Because they have no will to address the General Fund deficit besides raiding our retirement benefits. </p>
<p>Sabo on the other hand wants an above market rate paid to the Trust Fund.  On Feb. 23, <a href="http://www.williampolley.com/blog/archives/2005/02/index.html#000204">William Polley</a> sensibly noted:</p>
<blockquote><p>Anyway, back to Rep. Sabo&#8217;s plan. His plan would simply shift the financing from the pay-as-you-go Social Security system to the general fund&#8230; until (at least) 2080. He&#8217;s talking about doing exactly what I would try to avoid&#8230; for 40 years. This is more than just a counterpoint to the &#8220;raiding the trust fund&#8221; argument. This would institutionalize a long run imbalance in the pay-as-you-go Social Security system&#8211;a long period of deficit without a corresponding surplus. In my rank ordering of approaches to the Social Security issue, this ranks right below doing nothing.</p></blockquote>
<p>Simply put – the General Fund has a very serious long-term shortfall even if it is not asked to bail out the more modest Social Security Trust Fund.  Bottom line – we could set non-arm’s interest rates between these two divisions, but I’m not sure if either Bush’s version or Sabo’s version would be a wise policy change.</p>

                                <p>In his <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_comment/mitchell200503010824.asp">NRO oped</a> Daniel J. Mitchell claims it does:</p>
<blockquote><p>VAT might have some theoretically attractive features, but it is a perniciously effective way of raising revenues and inevitably leads to bigger government. The best evidence comes from Europe. Back in the mid-1960s, the burden of government in Europe wasn’t that much higher than it was in the United States. Tax revenues consumed about 30 percent of gross domestic product in Europe. The U.S. had a small advantage: The tax burden, including state and local governments, was about 27 percent of GDP. But then European governments started adopting the VAT. Denmark was the first to do so in 1967. France and Germany followed, with many other European nations imposing the tax within 5 years.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m not expert on the history of this tax but <a href="http://www.encyclopedia.com/html/v1/valueadd.asp">this source</a> has it being introduced by France in 1954.  Current VAT rates are given by <a href="http://www.trade.gov/td/tic/tariff/eu_vat.htm">this source</a>.  The VAT rate varies across nations, so one might like to see how this correlates with the spending to GDP ratio.  </p>
<p>Which brings me to a very good discussion on spending and taxes in general from <a href="http://yglesias.typepad.com/matthew">Matthew Yglesias</a> entitled “The Looming Crisis”, where Matthew takes on <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/03/garbage-from-greenspan.html">Greenspan’s Garbage</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Obviously, raising the requisite tax revenue would be politically difficult. Especially in an era when one of the country&#8217;s top economic policy officials can testify before congress in a manner that simply assumes that spending 40.7 percent of GDP on the public sector would be intolerable. International comparisons, however, indicate that it&#8217;s perfectly tolerable.</p></blockquote>
<p>Note that unlike Dr. Mitchell, Matthew provides a nice table of OECD data as to the spending to GDP ratio dating back to 1987.  I’m not sure if I can detect a relationship between the VAT rate and the ratio of spending to GDP using Matthew’s data with that from the International Trade Administration but even if there is some positive correlation (which Dr. Mitchell fails to provide), is it higher tax rates leading to higher spending or is the cause-and-effect in the other direction?  </p>
<p>Oh, but now I’m asking way too much from the Econopundits at NRO.  Of course, if the NRO has any serious suggestions for curbing government spending – maybe they’d like to share them with us.</p>

<p>I guess the GOP spin is that they have laid out what the problem is and the broad parameters of how to fix the problem.  But they have not laid out what the problem is so it’s a little murky what the real GOP agenda happens to be.  But one number says it all:</p>
<p><strong>2018</strong></p>
<p>What is the significance of 2018?  Simply this – ever since the Reagan-Greenspan Soc. Sec. recommendations were implemented a generation ago, we thought we were prefunding the retirement benefits of the baby boom generation.  The 2018 crowd says not so as they want to raid the lock box to bail out those massive General Fund deficits created by the advocates of this free-lunch supply-side nonsense.  While I can see why the Democrats might wish to oppose this agenda, I can also see why the GOP leadership refuses to define their agenda in such simple terms.  After all, bandits rarely call the bank president before their break into the vault.</p>

                                <p>Without a shred of evidence or theoretical justification, <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&#038;cid=568&#038;ncid=749&#038;e=1&#038;u=/nm/20050302/bs_nm/economy_greenspan_dc">Greenspan said this today</a> on Capitol Hill:<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;Addressing the government&#8217;s own imbalances will require scrutiny of both spending and taxes. However, tax increases of sufficient dimension to deal with our looming fiscal problems arguably pose significant risks to economic growth and the revenue base. The exact magnitude of such risks is very difficult to estimate, but, in my judgment, they are sufficiently worrisome to warrant aiming, if at all possible, to close the fiscal gap primarily, if not wholly, from the outlay side.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>This is utter garbage.  And there are at least two major reasons why this is garbage.</p>
<p>1. Tax increases large enough to eliminate the country&#8217;s fiscal imbalances would be on the order of magnitude of the 1993 tax increase.  Recall the terrible times that the US economy went through from 1994-2000 as it struggled to recover from that tax increase.  The truth is that there is no theory or evidence that shows that a medium-sized tax increase would &#8220;pose significant risks to economic growth.&#8221;  Such a  belief is &#8220;arguable&#8221; in the same way that it is &#8220;arguable&#8221; that a hidden civilization of mermaids lives underwater off the coast of Miami.</p>
<p>2. Given that non-defense discretionary spending is only about 15% of all federal spending, closing the fiscal imbalances through spending cuts is only possible by reducing defense spending, Social Security benefits, or Medicare/Medicaid benefits.  Since Greenspan is well aware of the political unwillingness to cut defense spending right now, this means that he is advocating balancing the budget by cutting the most important elements of this country&#8217;s social safety net.  Is there any economic theory or evidence that suggests that a country does better without a social safety net?  No.  In fact, there is a sizeable body of theory and evidence that suggests that economic performance is better when there is a social safety net present.</p>
<p>Once again, Greenspan is using his position of authority to pass off his own personal preferences as economic wisdom.  </p>

                                <p>Samuelson opines about the state of interest rates in the US in <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A64396-2005Mar1.html">today&#8217;s <em>Washington Post</em> </a>:<br />
<blockquote><strong>The Mystery of Low Interest Rates</strong></p>
<p>Something strange happened on the way to higher interest rates: They <em>declined</em>. We&#8217;re talking about rates on long-term mortgages and bonds. These rates truly affect the economy, because they influence housing and business investment. Most economists expected them to rise. But no. Last June rates on 30-year fixed mortgages averaged 6.29 percent; now they&#8217;re about 5.7 percent. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan recently called the declines a &#8220;conundrum&#8221;. Equally puzzling is whether the declines guarantee a healthy economy &#8212; or suggest a speculative &#8220;credit bubble&#8221;.</p></blockquote>
<p>Samuelson mentions a few possible explanations: maybe it&#8217;s due to weak business investment (but does <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/02/fourth-quarter-gdp-growth.html">recent evidence</a> really support that argument?); or because the bond market is expecting an economic downturn (but why would bond market participants expect that when stock market participants clearly don&#8217;t?); or <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/02/excessive-liquidity.html">my favorite explanation</a>, the massive inflows of foreign capital, primarily from Asian central banks, that have been financing the US&#8217;s current account deficit. </p>
<p>But perhaps this mystery will disappear on its own.  Over the past couple of weeks long-term interest rates have begun a significant march upward, raising yields on the 10-year government bond from about 4.1% three weeks ago to almost 4.4% today.  A bit more of that and we will no longer be puzzled by the behavior of interest rates&#8230; and instead, will simply have to focus on the consequences.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Yesterday the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO) released its <a href="http://www.ofheo.gov/media/pdf/4q04hpi.pdf">quarterly estimate</a> of house price appreciation.  The estimate shows that housing price appreciation slowed sharply in the fourth quarter of 2004 compared to the third quarter.  Because prices rose so much earlier in 2004, the year-on-year (y-o-y) percent change in house prices was still high at the end of 2004&#8230; but it seems that the increase in house prices took a pause during the past three months of last year.  The following chart illustrates, showing recent house price changes in a few selected cities.  </p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/hpi_2004_1.jpg"><br />(Note: Data is not seasonally adjusted.  The OFHEO&#8217;s house price index is based on a massive dataset including all single-family house sales that Freddie Mac of Fannie Mae are involved in.  See <a href="http://www.ofheo.gov/Media/Archive/house/hpi_tech.pdf">here</a> for details.)</p>
<p>Whether this is just a temporary pause to the remarkable price increases of the past few years (such as we saw in the first quarter of 2004), or the beginning of the end of the inflation in housing prices remains to be seen; there&#8217;s simply not enough evidence to support either conclusion.  However, it is interesting to note that the deceleration in house price increases was extremely broad-based, shared by a wide variety of markets.  This suggests that the reasons for the slowdown in price appreciation in these housing markets are national in origin rather than local.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;d like a bit of historical context, I&#8217;ve also put together the following chart that shows y-o-y house price changes in a few markets since 1980.  </p>

<p>Yes, house prices can indeed go down as well as up.</p>

<blockquote>George W. Bush won the &#8220;Razzie&#8221; worst actor of the year award on Saturday for his performance as president in &#8220;Fahrenheit 9/11&#8221; but his moment in Hollywood&#8217;s dubious spotlight was eclipsed by Halle Berry, who actually turned up to receive her embarrassing accolade.</p>
<p>Berry was named worst actress of 2004 by the Golden Raspberry Award Foundation for her performance in &#8220;Catwoman&#8221; and she showed up to accept her &#8220;Razzie&#8221; carrying the Oscar she won in 2002 for &#8220;Monster&#8217;s Ball.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They can&#8217;t take this away from me, it&#8217;s got my name on it!&#8221; she quipped. A raucous crowd cheered her on as she gave a stirring recreation of her Academy Award acceptance speech, including tears.</p>
<p>She thanked everyone involved in &#8220;Catwoman,&#8221; a film she said took her from the top of her profession to the bottom.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to thank Warner Brothers for casting me in this piece of shit,&#8221; she said as she dragged her agent </p></blockquote>

                                <span class="author">admin</span><span class="separator"> | </span>March 1, 2005 5:22 pm<br>
                            </p>
                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>I asked that question of an acquaintance of mine who is an attorney working for a federal bankruptcy judge.  Here is her answer:</p>
<blockquote><p>1.  There are two basic types of bankruptcy in this country: Chapter 13, which means that the individual is put on a strict, court-supervised payment plan with the goal of fully repaying creditors; and Chapter 7, which means that the court acknowledges that the debt will never be fully repaid, so that while the individual must liquidate assets and repay as much as possible, some of the debt is simply discharged by the court and taken as a loss to the creditor.</p>
<p>The new bill adds a &#8220;means-test&#8221; which denies access to Chapter 7 (liquidation) bankruptcy to those debtors who are deemed able to pay just $100/mo of their income to their unsecured creditors.  A debtor who does not satisfy the means test for Ch 7 (i.e. the very poorest of debtors) would have to have a hearing before the court, which, incidentally, would probably swamp the bankruptcy courts.  </p>
<p>Proponents argue that such a means test is necessary to ensure that rich individuals can not take advantage the system by declaring Ch 7 bankruptcy and thus simply having their debts written off.  Yet it is already the case that every Ch 7 petition filed is screened for substantial income, and that petitions with substantial income are already either dismissed or forced into Ch 13 bankruptcy.  Thus the only real contributions of this bill are to substantially lower the income barrier above which chapter 7 bankruptcy is disallowed, and to create more legal hurdles for the poorest of those in debt.</p>
<p>2. The new bill eliminates what we call &#8220;cram downs.&#8221;  To illustrate what that is, here are facts from a typical case: a debtor owns a car that they bought in 2003.  The debtor financed $10,900 over 4.5 years at 18% interest.  The debtor files bankruptcy in Jan 2005 and has missed her last 3 payments.  The balance owed on the car is $10,223, but the car’s value is only $7,675.  Currently, the Bankruptcy Code treats $7,675 of the car loan as a secured (collateralized) debt, and allows a debtor in Ch 13 (payment plan) to pay the bank the value of the car, plus an interest of 7% (that interest rate is determined by a formula linked to the federal rate).  The balance of what the bank is owed (10,223 &#8211; 7,675), however, is treated like any other unsecured debt, which would probably just get paid a few cents on the dollar.  The reasoning is this: why should the bank receive payment in full – a privilege currently reserved for collateralized debt – for anything more than the value of their collateral?</p>
<p>The new bill would require the debtor to pay the amount owed on the car (or mobile home) in full, regardless of the actual value of the asset.  This will have a Catch-22 effect on debtors.  Marginal debtors will be forced into Ch 13 rather than Ch 7 bankruptcy (see above), and then, because more of their debts will required to be treated as collateralized and thus repaid in full, their court-required payments will have to be higher, increasing the likelihood that they will not have sufficient income to make those court-required payments.</p>
<p>3.  The new bill requires mandatory credit counseling before filing bankruptcy.  While I am actually not opposed to the concept of credit counseling, in reality, credit counseling agencies are generally for-profit companies and are often linked to for-profit conglomerates.  These credit counseling agencies charge fees which are frequently extremely high, and don&#8217;t always provide good advice.  So the bill will force people into the arms of yet one more industry that will make a profit off of the most vulnerable and financially uneducated people in society.</p>
<p>The bankruptcy filing rate is a symptom, not the disease.  Some people do abuse the system, but there is already a method to deal with that.  The vast majority of people file because of job loss, inadequate retirement savings, medical expenses, and divorce.  The fastest growing group of debtors is the elderly.  More than 50% of those 65 or older who file for bankruptcy do so because of medical debt.  Just come to any court day of any week, and you will see the court room filled with people who depend entirely on Medicare and Social Security.  In addition to the elderly, families with children will be the most hurt by this bill; the presence of children in the household increases the likelihood of bankruptcy by 302%.  </p>
<p>If the credit card companies and sub-prime lenders are unhappy with debts being discharged in bankruptcy, maybe they should stop sending offers for credit cards with $10,000 limits to people who make $18000/yr.</p></blockquote>
<p>The concept of bankruptcy is an important one economically, for several reasons.  But one of the most important is that the threat that borrowers could become unable to repay their loans provides some discipline to lenders to ensure that they direct loanable funds to those borrowers who will best be able to use it.  The threat of bankruptcy thus helps to keep capital flowing to relatively efficient uses in the economy, with all of the socially beneficial side-effects (such as higher productivity) that that entails.  </p>
<p>This bankruptcy bill works to substantially reduce the potential losses that lenders face, and thus removes a form of market discipline on lenders.  In contradiction to the claims of the banking industry that this bill will result in lower interest rates for consumers, this bill may in fact do the opposite, since it will enable lenders to make more high-interest, risky loans with reduced fear of having to absorb losses due to borrowers declaring bankruptcy.  Either way, it seems that the bill will certainly add nicely to the profits of lenders, without any clear social benefit.  It will unambiguously harm poor individuals, especially those who are financially illiterate.  And it may make the distribution of capital in our economy less efficient.  This makes for quite a list of potential accomplishments for one bill.</p>

<blockquote>Back-to-back briefings last week put a harsh spotlight on the deep hole left by the budget policies of George Bush&#8217;s first term. Millions of Americans will be paying the price for the fiscal profligacy of this misnamed conservative government.</p>
<p>The bad news, delivered in the first report, is that the camouflaged domestic spending cuts contained in the Bush budget will &#8212; if accepted by Congress &#8212; do serious damage to education initiatives, low-income assistance and environmental programs over the next five years. </p></blockquote>
<p>The bulk of the remainder of the column gives a decent, and largely critical, overview of what will fall prey to Bush&#8217;s economic policies (Ready for a surprise? It&#8217;s education, the environment, welfare, and &#8212; though Broder strangely doesn&#8217;t mention this one &#8212; veterans benefits).</p>
<p>Naturally, I still have a complaint. Broder writes that<br />
<blockquote>The worse news, documented in the second report, is that these cuts will not even begin to deal with the looming calamity of runaway entitlement spending on the retirement and health care costs of the baby boom generation.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>&#8230;Medicare and Social Security benefits for the huge wave of boomers, who start to turn 62 in just three years, make the current budget policies &#8220;unsustainable&#8221; for the long term.</p></blockquote>
<p>Broder employs a common sleight of hand by not actually saying that Social Security is heading towards bankruptcy (it&#8217;s not), but rather twice saying that Medicare <u>and</u> Social Security are in real trouble. The latter statement is technically true, but only because of the dour projections for Medicare costs, which Bush&#8217;s policies have exacerbated, not addressed. Let&#8217;s turn to <a href="http://www.washtimes.com/commentary/20050104-085750-9685r.htm">honest conservative<sup>TM</sup> Bruce Bartlett</a>:<br />
<blockquote>The Financial Report of the U.S. Government for fiscal 2004, released just before Christmas, says the unfunded liability of the Social Security system is $12.5 trillion, an increase of $810 billion over the previous year. However, the Medicare deficit is twice that: $24.6 trillion, a rise of $9.6 trillion from 2003.</p>
<p>In other words, in just a single year, the unfunded liability of Medicare increased by three-fourths of Social Security&#8217;s total deficit. Yet instead of reforming Medicare, which is hemorrhaging money, we are talking only about Social Security, which is in sterling financial shape by comparison.</p>
<p>Indeed, not only are we not talking about reining in Medicare&#8217;s exploding costs, we are preparing to make them much worse. Next year, the new Medicare drug benefit is fully effective, which will drive up Medicare spending sharply. This is the reason for the rise in its unfunded liabilities. Medicare&#8217;s trustees estimate the long-term cost of the drug benefit at $8.1 trillion, accounting for the bulk of its increased liabilities last year. </p></blockquote>
<p>So no, Broder isn&#8217;t actually lying when he says that Social Security and Medicare &#8220;make the current budget policies &#8216;unsustainable&#8217; for the long term.&#8221; But he&#8217;s only being honest in the same sense in which the following statements are true:
<ul>
<li>The Defense Department and Medicare are &#8216;unsustainable&#8217; for the long term.</li>
<li>The Transportation Department and Medicare are &#8216;unsustainable&#8217; for the long term.</li>
<li>The Department of Homeland Security and Medicare are &#8216;unsustainable&#8217; for the long term.</li>
<li>Bill Gates, Warren Buffet, George Soros, the Waldens, Michael Dell, Jeff Bezos, and Medicare are &#8216;unsustainable&#8217; for the long term.</li>
<li>Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, and Medicare are &#8216;unsustainable&#8217; for the long term.</li>
</ul>
<p>And of course, Medicare is not necessarily &#8216;unsustainable&#8217; for the long term, but its finances are in bad shape, as Bartlett described. Moreover, the Bush administration willfully conflated Medicare and Social Security in order to allege a crisis where none existed (Social Security). At the same time, the administration pushed through a <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2003/12/medicare-drug-benefit-update-reading.html">bizarrely crafted drug benefit</a>, thereby exacerbating the problems of the program that actually had, and continues to have, &#8216;sustainability for the long term&#8217; issues. Astounding!</p>
<p>In fairness to Broder, he almost pulls out a save in the last two paragraphs:<br />
<blockquote>
<p>&#8230; Reform of these major entitlement programs [Social Security and Medicare] is the pressing need to avoid a budget train wreck in the next generation, but Bush has offered little leadership on that. His Social Security plan &#8212; for individual savings accounts &#8212; does nothing to address the shortfall in that system. And his &#8220;contribution&#8221; to solving the more pressing crisis in Medicare has been to add an unaffordable prescription drug benefit to the program. </p>
<p>It is a sorry record for a conservative administration, and we are just beginning to recognize its price.></p>
</blockquote>
<p>While not actually correct, this is more right than wrong. Broder is wrong in that reforming just Medicare but not Social Security would avoid a budget train wreck in the next generation. But he&#8217;s correct that Bush&#8217;s SS plan does not address the (modest) SSRI shortfall, that the administration made the Medicare problem worse with its prescription drug plan, and that it&#8217;s a sorry record for a conservative administration. (Were I a nitpicker, I&#8217;d point out that it&#8217;s a sorry record for any administration.)</p>

                                <p>The BEA just released its latest figures on <a href="http://www.bea.doc.gov/bea/newsrel/pinewsrelease.htm">personal income and spending</a> in the US:<br />
<blockquote>Personal income decreased $238.6 billion, or 2.3 percent, and disposable personal income (DPI) decreased $241.4 billion, or 2.6 percent, in January, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis.  Personal consumption expenditures (PCE) decreased $3.9 billion, or less than 0.1 percent.</p>
<p>&#8230;The 2.3 percent decrease in January personal income mainly reflected the effect of the payment of a special dividend by the Microsoft Corporation, which had boosted personal income in December. Excluding this special factor and others, which are discussed more fully below, personal income increased $52.3 billion, or 0.5 percent, in January, after increasing $62.6 billion, or 0.6 percent in December.</p></blockquote>
<p>Note that the personal savings rate continues to hover around 1% of disposable income.  Thus the average worker with a salary of $75,000 per year (which would probably yield disposible income of about $50,000 per year) is currently only saving about $40 per month.  By the way, that $40 saved per month includes net debt repayments, since it makes no analytical difference whether the $40 is put into a bank account or used to pay down the principal balance on a loan &#8212; both actions increase the individual&#8217;s net asset position by $40.</p>
<p>One need look no further to explain the bulk of the US&#8217;s current account deficit.</p>
