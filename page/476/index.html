                                <p>rdan<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/120162-china-s-three-no-s-to-the-u-s-is-washington-listening">Simon Smelt</a> at Seeking Alpha discusses how the US and China are &#8220;communicating&#8221; national interests.  He points to three important, very broad messages needing interpretation and analysis:</p>
<p>In summary:<br />
<blockquote>1. In 2005 a bilateral Strategic Economic Dialogue (SED) between China and the U.S. was set up. Reportedly, Beijing has put a lot of effort into this and sees the SED as the primary channel for dealing with pressing economic issues. It is the mechanism for dialogue between the G2 on strategic issues, including those of worldwide importance.</p>
<p>What all this boils down to is that China expects to be involved in the big decisions. The message is:</p>
<p>No more U.S. hegemony in the financial world</p>
<p>Lacking a suitable multi-national mechanism (memo from China: “don’t blame us – we’ve been calling for one”), the G2 will do fine instead.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>2. The U.S. has long run a trade deficit with China. The U.S. fiscal deficit by the government is more recent. It stems from the Bush years and is about to get much worse due to the various bail-out and stimulus packages. The Chinese can scarcely object to the trade deficit – they have funded it for years. So, the message is: don’t rely on us to buy your extra bond issues caused by your economic mismanagement.</p>
<p>So, the second Chinese “No”:</p>
<p>No extra U.S. bond purchases by China above the normal level</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>3. No policies that could lead to sharp depreciation of the U.S. $</p>
<p>The danger here is of loose monetary policy pushing inflation sharply higher or other measures undermining confidence in the U.S. $. Debt could be inflated away. I’ve commented before on the dangers for China here. Exaggerating just a bit I said “Imagine, U.S. to China in 2015: “Here’s the trillion we owe you. Buy yourself a beer with it.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Smelt&#8217;s final answer/interpretation:</p>
<p>You’ve been bad but let’s still do business. Here’s our terms.</p>
<p>US response to date, given only public statements and no new trade agreements:</p>
<blockquote><p>We do know that Treasury Secretary Geithner – quoting President Obama in aid – effectively threatened China. He accused China on Jan. 22 of “manipulating” their currency, the yuan, to give an unfair advantage to its exporters and suggested U.S. action might eventuate.</p>
<p>Geithner’s message appears contradictory because he also spoke of Obama’s concern for a “strong” U.S. $. So, that’s a “strong” $ except for, err, the Chinese Yuan. In fact, this does make sense. The strong dollar remark is perhaps signaling:</p>
<p> Yes, the U.S. government will act to avoid hyper inflation or sharp depreciation of the dollar.</p>
<p>The currency manipulation remark is saying to the Chinese:</p>
<p>You can do your bit too.</p></blockquote>
<p>(Rdan&#8230;.no bashing here, but the relationship needs a thorough assessment&#8230;I see Angry Bear also addressing the issues in a straight forward way)</p>

                                <p>Robert Waldmann</p>
<p><a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2009/02/economics_does.html">Arnold Kling</a> (via Matt Yglesias) argues that economists agree more about microeconomics than about macroeconomics.</p>
<blockquote><p>My take on this is that the consensus of economists is likely to be more reliable on microeconomic issues than it is on macroeconomic issues. In my view, fundamental macroeconomic issues are unsettled. It makes sense to have what a Bayesian statistician would call “diffuse priors” and what an ordinary layman would call an open mind. […] What is important to bear in mind is that just because economists cannot settle disputes about macro does not mean that all of economics is bunk or that nowhere is there a reliable consensus in economics. Macroeconomics is only one area of economics. In my view, it is the area with the highest ratio of unresolved issues to settled questions.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yglesias <a href="http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/archives/2009/02/the_trouble_with_economics.php#comment-1098636">proposes a thought experiment</a></p>
<blockquote><p>I think that if the President got an ideologically diverse group of economists together and said “I’m going to impose a $800 billion stimulus package through some mystical process that doesn’t involve the need for congressional approval; I want to maximize short-term GDP boost per dollar spent and minimize long-term harm due to budget deficits, what should I do?” that you’d find some important areas of common ground. Not universal, immediate consensus. But I think important common ground and ideas that would be importantly different from what you’d get by pulling an ideologically diverse group of members of the U.S. House of Representatives together</p></blockquote>
<p>.</p>
<p>Sad to say, I think that Yglesias and Kling are wrong.  Consider your thought experiment and Kling himself.  His proposed stimulus would be a payroll tax holidy.  N. Gregory Mankiw is more famous and he agrees.  It is just not true that conditional on the size of the stimulus, economists agree on spending vs tax cuts.</p>
<p>More generally economists strongly disagree about the minimum wage (now that&#8217;s micro) the proper progressivity of taxes and, well, all about regulation.  </p>
<p>As far as I can tell, there is a near consensus in favor of free trade, because the people who are sure that protection is bad for the protecting countries ally with the people who care more about the third world than the USA.  I don&#8217;t actually know an economist who supports rent control.  Economists used to agree that the minimum wage was a bad way to try to support the income of the working poor (EITC much better) then some data misbehaved.</p>
<p>Aside from that, I can&#8217;t think of much agreement, that is many issues where the range of views of economists isn&#8217;t at least as wide as the range of views of the general public.  Examples of surprising disagreement after the jump.</p>
<p>update: pulled back from comments <br />Jeff H. says:<br />Today, 4:12:13 AM<br />“Some actual data might be helpful: <br />http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2006/11/consensus-of-economists.html</p>
<p>update II: from e-mail.  Ken Houghton sent me a power point presentation of a newer survey of AEA members with a much larger sample size.  I don&#8217;t know if the *.ppt is public domain or confidential, but I have to report one result.</p>
<p>66% of the economists surveyed said they planned to vote for Obama.  By Mankiw&#8217;s definition of &#8220;consensus&#8221; there was a consensus among economists that Obama would make a better president than McCain.</p>
<p>I comment after the jump.</p>
<p>The micro debate includes the extremely eminent and empirically grounded Alan Krueger and David Card who estimate that, if anything, the minimum wage causes increased employment and many economists who say they must have done something like fudging the data (no specific accusations, I don&#8217;t remember names and I wouldn&#8217;t type them if I did as casually tossing around such innuendos is unprofessional to say the least).</p>
<p>Economists disagree on whether civil rights legislation caused a reduction in the Black White earnings differential.  The very eminent Finis Welch left an AEA panel without listening to a paper by the to be Nobel Laureate James Heckman purporting to prove that it did (I think he had to catch a plane but you know he made the reservation).</p>
<p>Economists disagree about whether or not mandatory seat belt laws cause more traffic deaths.  The idea that they do does not come from some wingnut welfare think tank, it comes from the University of Chicago where full professor Sam Peltzman makes the argument.</p>
<p>I think that Kling guesses that all econmists views on micro are close to libertarian for the same reason that he asserted that <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2009/01/whats_with_the.html">all right of center economists opposed the stimulus.  <br /></a><br />He&#8217;s at Cato and his view of the economics profession is based on the economists he knows. They aren&#8217;t typical.  </p>
<p>Update:  I think I am wrong on the origin of Kling&#8217;s beliefs.  Via Jeff H in comments via <a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2006/11/consensus-of-economists.html">Mankiw</a>, I find that Kling told mankiw about <a href="http://www.bepress.com/ev/vol3/iss9/art1/">this survey.</a></p>
<p>Reading the results, I find an area of consensus which I had forgotten &#8212; economists overwhelmingly oppose agricultural subsidies.  </p>
<p>The evidence in the survey is strikingly weak.  The main problem is that the sample size (which varies by question) is at most 83.  That&#8217;s a small sample. The original survey was of 210 members of the AEA.  That&#8217;s a low response rate.  Like the author of the article based on the survey, Robert Whaples, Mankiw and Kling count 67% saying yes as a consensus.  This is not what I mean by the word consensus.  He didn&#8217;t ask say &#8220;Monetary policy is generally a better way to stabilize output than fiscal policy&#8221; (I&#8217;d guess more than 67% would have said yes including Krugman who has done so very explicitly) or &#8220;The FED should attempt to stabilize both output and prices&#8221; vs &#8220;the FED should ignore prices and try to stabilize output&#8221; or &#8220;the FED should just try to stabilize prices (as in the charter of the European Central Bank)&#8221; I&#8217;d guess that stabilize both would probably get 67%.  </p>
<p>I am going to cut and paste Mankiw&#8217;s summary of Whaples&#8217; results (note he selected areas of relative consensus and mentioned just one area of disagreement &#8212; the minimum wage).</p>
<p>    * 87.5 percent agree that &#8220;the U.S. should eliminate remaining tariffs and other barriers to trade.&#8221;<br />    * 85.2 percent agree that &#8220;the U.S. should eliminate agricultural subsidies.&#8221;<br />    * 85.3 percent agree that &#8220;the gap between Social Security funds and expenditures will become unsustainably large within the next fifty years if current policies remain unchanged.&#8221;<br />    * 77.2 percent agree that &#8220;the best way to deal with Social Security&#8217;s long-term funding gap is to increase the normal retirement age.&#8221;<br />    * 67.1 percent agree that &#8220;parents should be given educational vouchers which can be used at government-run or privately-run schools.&#8221;<br />    * 65.0 percent agree that &#8220;the U.S. should increase energy taxes.&#8221;</p>
<p>And, finally, the topic that generates the most consensus:</p>
<p>    * 90.1 percent disagree with the position that &#8220;the U.S. should restrict employers from outsourcing work to foreign countries.&#8221;</p>
<p>I find myself in the minority on several issues where Whaples detects a consensus (using such a broad definition).  Most economists support vouchers (although I wouldn&#8217;t call 67.1% a consensus).  My interpretation of the data is that vouchers don&#8217;t work.  In particular, I wonder if the economists have considered the problem of private schools set up in response to the profit opportunity created by vouchers.  Do they really trust such schools ?  Would they support vouchers if the alternative were charter schools ?</p>
<p>The 85% who are confident that there is a social security funding gap seems odd given the perfect performance of the trustees low cost estimate and the fact that it implies that there is no shortfall.   Here the views of economists seem similar to those of the general public (and to the consensus of pundits).  I wonder if economists who have actually looked at the data are so convinced.    I&#8217;d say the definite statement (no &#8220;probably&#8221; or &#8220;might&#8221; so to agree one should be 100% certain of the prediction) is inconsistent with available analysis of actual data.</p>
<p>Mankiw notes that </p>
<p>* 77.2 percent agree that &#8220;the best way to deal with Social Security&#8217;s long-term funding gap is to increase the normal retirement age.&#8221;</p>
<p>he doesn&#8217;t note that 57.1% also agree that &#8220;the best way to deal with Social Security&#8217;s long-term funding gap is to decrease social security benefits.&#8221; </p>
<p>Either 32.3 % of the economists in the survey think that the two approaches are identically good or they don&#8217;t know what &#8220;best&#8221; means.  The only other alternative was increase payroll taxes.  The survey didn&#8217;t ask economists about raising the ceiling &#8212; the approach which has by far the most support among the general public.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d say the survey shows that there isn&#8217;t consensus on anything (I&#8217;d say consensus implies at least 83 out of 83 but really you need unanimity in a larger sample before you have consensus).  </p>
<p>Imagine what would happen if you asked biologists if the human genetic material is DNA ? or if genes are objects with a mass and a location ?  Or if they believe in evolution by natural selection (or stronger if they think that the current forms and diversity of living things is due to evolution by natural selection).  </p>
<p>update II: see update II before the jump.  Note that according to Mankiw there is a consensus in the economics profession that Obama not McCain should be President.  For what it&#8217;s worth (nothing given sample sizes) that is larger than the proportion who support Mankiw&#8217;s favorite idea &#8212; energy taxes.</p>
<p>Also I should have mentioned this in update I, but, you know, not all economists are Americans.  A consensus in the profession doesn&#8217;t mean a consensus in the AEA.  I&#8217;d say there would be very different answers on vouchers and US social security in Europe (you would have to tell them the retirement age and the benefit level,  Then prove that the maximum benefit level is really that low with an official document because they wouldn&#8217;t believe you.</p>
<p>You know, I bet if you asked the economists in Whaples sample what social security should pay  min max and average they would probably come up with numbers higher than current pensions.  Many would know exactly what current pension levels are, but I guess that the others would have biased up guesses.  That is, I suspect, that economists, like the general public, support cutting something to a level higher than its current level.</p>
<p>On the general public one clear result of polling is that most US citizens want to cut foreign aid.  When asked for numbers they said from 10% of the federal budget to 5%.  Foreign aid is currently about 1% of the federal budget so the respondents wanted to cut it to five times the current level.  </p>
<p>Of course, economists know more about the federal budget than the general public, but that leaves plenty of room for policy proposals based on ignorance of current policy.</p>

                                <p>By Spencer,</p>
<p>Our conservative/libertarian friends keep saying the FDR made the recovery from the 1929-33 economic downturn weak. I keep asking them weak compared to what, and they never have an answer.</p>
<p>When I look at the data series like this I find it hard to accept that the recovery under FDR was weak.  1940 was the end of FDR&#8217;s second term in office and eight years from the bottom of the<br />1929-33 downturn.  It also precedes the impact of WW II military spending that first became<br />significant in 1941. Moreover, it is long enough that the normal end of a recession snap-back should has a negligible impact.  So this eight year period should be a good measure of the impact of the New Deal on economic growth.</p>

<p>The eight year growth to 1940 of real per capita GDP was some 50%, the strongest eight years in US economic history except for the few years of WW II.   The 1930s growth rate was more than 25% stronger than the next largest boom that ended in 1883. Now I will accept that growth was stronger in WW II than under the New Deal in the 1933-1940 era.  But we all know WW II was an exceptional period when from one-third to one-half  of the economy was doing the equivalent of digging holes and filling them in.</p>
<p>I for one propose a new rule for the debate over the impact of the New Deal.  No one should be allowed to make any claims about growth in that era without showing what growth was in other eras so every one can make their own comparisons.</p>
<p>One other things that comes out of this data is the long term growth rates of US per capital real GDP.</p>
<p>1800-1850 &#8230;.0.7%<br />1850-1925, 1850-1930, 1850-1950 =&#8230;1.4%<br />1930-2008&#8230;2.5%<br />1950-2008&#8230;2.1%.</p>
<p>It is interesting how the modern mixed economy does such a superior job of providing for the economic well being of the US population than the old small government model of 1850-1930<br />despite what many claim.   If you look at the chart the major difference between the modern mixed economy and the old small government model is that since 1950 the system seems to have eliminated the repeated growth collapses of the old era.</p>

<p>This piece of stormy&#8217;s post caught my attention:</p>
<blockquote><p>But ask yourselves&#8211;ask Krugman, ask Roubini, ask Martin Feldstein, ask any economist: What will be the engine of our economic recovery? The stimulus package can, at best, only blunt the worst effects of this economic crisis. And, the most overt forms of protectionism may come into play.</p>
<p>At the end of the tunnel, what will be the engine of our economy?</p></blockquote>

                                                                    </div>

<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.truthout.org/021109J">Governors are taking a look</a> at the current demands on their National Guard troops.</p>
<blockquote><p> &#8220;There is not Congressional authorization for the use of the Guard today,&#8221; Vermont State Rep. Mike Fisher told Truthout. &#8220;One Guard member improperly called into federal service to fight a war &#8211; that&#8217;s a real problem. Choosing to go to war is one of the most serious decisions that we make. The very least we can do is follow the Constitution.&#8221;</p>
<p>    The state legislators involved in the campaign argue that it is their duty, along with the governor&#8217;s, to ensure Guard members&#8217; welfare. Although a governor can&#8217;t order the Guard&#8217;s return, he or she does have the right to challenge federalization orders (mandates to call up the Guard) in the first place. Every month, another set of call-ups sends more Guard members overseas. Should a state decide to refuse a federalization order, the case would likely be brought to the courts.</p>
<p>    &#8220;We believe that it would be a good thing for a court to be asked the question of whether a state Guard can be brought into federal service to fight in an overseas war &#8211; other than in an emergency &#8211; that does not have a proper Congressional authorization,&#8221; Fisher said.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>The campaign began back in 2007, after Fisher had written and passed a resolution in the Vermont legislature to urge the withdrawal of US military forces from Iraq. He wanted to intensify this state-level action against the war by asserting the war&#8217;s illegality, and relating it back to Vermont law. So, Fisher joined with attorney Benson Scotch, formerly the executive director of Vermont&#8217;s ACLU, to spearhead an effort that would both advocate for Vermont&#8217;s Guard members and challenge the legal basis for continued US involvement in Iraq.</p>
<p>    The effort is premised on the National Guard&#8217;s dual chain of command. Usually, the governor is the commander in chief of a state&#8217;s Guard. With Congressional authorization, the Guard can be called into federal service. However, since that Congressional authorization has expired for Iraq, control reverts back to the states &#8211; or at least it should, under the Constitution, according to Scotch and Fisher.</p>
<p>    Regardless of legality, the federalization orders continue, with more Guard troops called up every month. The state Guards have seen some of their largest deployments since World War II. In New Jersey, for example, the planned deployment represents about 50 percent of the state&#8217;s National Guard.</p>
<p>    This transfer of the Guard out of state not only reduces its ability to respond to local emergencies, it also fuels a frightening shift in US foreign policy, according to Ben Manski, executive director of the nonprofit Liberty Tree Foundation.</p></blockquote>

                                <p><u>Job Loss</u>:The Chinese government says that 20 million migrant workers have &#8220;recently lost their jobs,&#8221; according to state media. This follows an official statement that 2009 would be &#8220;possibly the toughest year&#8221; for economic development in China since the turn of the century.</p>
<p>Some 15.3 per cent of China&#8217;s 130 migrant workers are now jobless, the Ministry of Agriculture said in a statement.</p>
<p>China says five to six million new migrant workers are trying to enter the job market every year. &#8220;Therefore, about 25 million rural migrant workers will face huge pressure finding jobs this year,&#8221; Chen Xiwen, Director of the advisory body Central Rural Work Leading Group, said.</p>
<p>Chen added that, &#8220;The increasing number of jobless migrant workers has posed a fresh threat to the social stability.&#8221;</p>
<p>UK-based The Guardian newspaper says that, “Some economists say the real figure could ultimately reach 40 million.”</p>
<p><u>Textile export tax rebates</u>: China’s State Council has announced that it will increase the tax rebate rate for textile and garment exports, from 14 to 15 per cent. It’s the third such rebate rise since August 2008.</p>
<p>The move is aimed at “reducing exporters&#8217; costs and [to] support the textile industry.” The effective date of the new rebate rate was not specified.<br />Figures from Chinese Customs show that the growth of 2008 textile and garment exports was down 10.7 per cent compared to 2007. The Ministry of Commerce blamed the fall on “the appreciation the yuan, industry liquidity shortage and production material costs surge.”</p>
<p><u>Intel</u>: U.S. chipmaker Intel Corp said on Thursday that it will close its assembly and test plant in Shanghai and shift operations to central China, state media reports. Some 2,000 people will lose their jobs.</p>
<p>Sichuan province’s capital Chengdu was singled out as the new home for the plant, a city that offers lower labour costs than Shanghai. Intel called the move a result of “recent economic conditions” and added that the 2,000 workers employed in Shanghai would have the opportunity to apply for jobs at Intel plants in Dalian and Chengdu.</p>
<p>The Shanghai plant was the first built in China by Intel, at a cost of USD 500m. In January, Intel announced the closure of five factories in the United States, Malaysia and the Philippines.</p>
<p><u>Toymakers</u>:- Chinese companies exported toys worth USD 8.63 bn in 2008, up 1.8 per cent year-on-year, the General Administration of Customs said. Some 49 per cent of all toy producers reportedly went out of business in 2008. Official figures show that there are still 4,388 toy makers in China.</p>
<p><u>Statistics</u>&#8211; China reported a fiscal deficit of RMB 111 bn in 2008, as revenue grew 19.5 per cent to RMB 6.13 trillion, and expenses increased 25.4 per cent to RMB 6.24 trillion.</p>
<p>&#8211; Trade between China and the United States grew to USD 333.74 bn in 2008. Exports to the United States increased 8.4 per cent to USD 252.3 bn, while imports into China rose 17.4 per cent to USD 81.44 bn.</p>
<p>&#8211; Beijing&#8217;s insurance companies recorded a premium income of RMB58.6 bn in 2008, the Insurance Regulatory Bureau said. This represents a 17.7 per cent growth compared to 2007.</p>
<p>&#8211; Gold output from China grew 4.26 per cent year-on-year to 282.007 tonnes in 2008, the China Gold Association said.</p>
<p>&#8211; Chinese shipbuilders recorded a 50 per cent year on year jump in profits in 2008, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology said in a statement. Profits grew to RMB28.34 bn.</p>
<p>&#8211; China&#8217;s industrial output rose 12.9 per cent in 2008, state media reports. Growth declined 5.6 per cent compared to the 2006 to 2007 period. Some 31 out of the 39 industries that are included in the report recorded a profit growth.</p>

                                <p>by Bruce Webb</p>
<p>Politicians tasked with convincing democratic majorities that they should oppose minimum wage increases generally fall back on the economic argument that such increases simply lead to job losses. Often they go on to point out that these losses fall disproportionately on the young, the unskilled, or minorities. Before examining whether this argument is in fact true at all and whether this effect is sufficient to cause us to vote against our own personal material interest it is worth asking if the argument is being offered in good faith.</p>
<p>A look at the bigger pictures suggests the answer is no. Because these same politicians seem indifferent to these populations in almost all other contexts. For example it is common for these same conservative politicians to claim that we should give tax breaks to companies to get them to relocate no matter that the job effects on the previous factory location might be serious. Now suddenly it is all about the jobs locally. Moreover when given the opportunity to fund education, job training, youth job programs, and community development, programs which might or might not be stimulative in the short run, but certain would create longer term opportunities for these same populations the Republicans in both Houses voted almost unanimously &#8216;No&#8217;. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/02/02/gop.stimulus.worries/index.html">What GOP Leaders deem wasteful in Senate stimulus bill</a></p>
<p>So when you see arguments framed as follows: &#8220;How can you workers be so cold as to take a wage increase when you know it is going to cause poor Jimmy the Stock Boy to lose his job?&#8221; workers and voters should immediately be smelling a rat. Because what we do know is that if management decided it was more efficient to move from a system of supplies kept on site to an on demand system via some company like Corporate Express that Jimmy would be on his ass on the pavement in an instant. These appeals in economic guise are simply attempts to appeal to liberal guilt and worker solidarity to convince us to vote against our own interest in favor of the corporate bottom line.</p>
<p>Plus it doesn&#8217;t take a lot of complicated analysis to show that the argument can&#8217;t just rest on changes on employment at the margin, just a pencil and a calculator. Take a company with 100 workers including Jimmy  making federal minimum wage currently at $6.55 per hour. This wage is scheduled to increase to $7.25 per hour on July 24th. Let&#8217;s say that management in order to partially compensate for this increased cost decided to lay off Jimmy. Should the other workers care enough that they should forgo the pay increase? For that matter should Jimmy even want them to? I suggest the answer to both questions is no.</p>
<p>We have 99 workers now making an extra 70 cents an hour which multiplies out to an extra $69.30 per hour. When we subtract out Jimmy&#8217;s wage that net drops to $62.75. Which is plenty enough to buy Jimmy a nice lunch on his last day. More to the point it is enough to subsidize Jimmy&#8217;s unemployment until he gets a new job. A job where he too will be getting $7.25.</p>
<p>Meaning that when economists like Bryan Caplan insist that workers who don&#8217;t understand that minimum wages are net negative for workers are irrational to the extent that they shouldn&#8217;t be allowed to vote (as advocated in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Myth-Rational-Voter-Democracies-Policies/dp/0691129428">Myth of the Rational Voter</a>) he can kiss my something or other. The question is just not as easy as saying &#8216;cost increases so demand falls&#8217; as being just self-evident. Because the system and the calculation is more complex than that. As an example I pointed out on Spencer&#8217;s post <a target="_blank" href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/02/minimum-wage-disinformation.html">Minimum Wage Disinformation</a> that there is a more or less constant demand for Big Macs and Pizza delivery, meaning that McDonalds and Domino&#8217;s have to staff up or just abandon the market. And that is mostly not going to happen, there is money to be made selling burgers and pizza. There may be price effects (though the chains generally like price uniformity and demand it in response to promotional offers advertised nationally), there might alternately be profit effects. Or maybe the bosses stop letting the employees getting discounts. The idea that this instead simply and always reduces to a cost/demand identity for jobs is nonsense.</p>
<p>What would an honest argument to convince workers they should vote for politicians so as to be protected from the horror of getting paid a little more an hour look like? Follow me below the fold.</p>
<p>Well first it would have to address the question of self-interest. I doubt that any right leaning economist would argue that it is not just a right but almost a duty to maximize your own self-interest in market transactions. Indeed that is kind of the driving principle of markets. Moreover I think most would argue that maximizing your family&#8217;s self-interest is an equally valid goal. Moreover that goal can stay valid even as the circles get wider: co-workers, average town income, average state income, average national income, even average world income. The only question is how much should you give up in exchange for the welfare of others as the circles get bigger</p>
<p>The standard argument against minimum wage is &#8216;Everything&#8217;. Don&#8217;t take a wage increase that is clearly in your own self interest because it might cost Jimmy a job. Or maybe the job of the last kid hired at Luigi&#8217;s Pizza downtown. Or maybe the job of some high-school dropout in Michigan. Sorry capitalists never seem to use this same logic on their own economic decisions, nope instead they want to maximize return and cut taxation levels regardless of its effects on the price of maize in Africa.</p>
<p>Are there circumstances where workers should buy in to this argument? Well I think so. Depending on where you draw your own personal circle if a wage increase causes a net decrease in income then you might consider forgoing it. For example if Jimmy was not just a co-worker but also a son contributing to family income you might pause. On the other hand if job prospects are reasonably good locally and Jimmy can get a new higher wage job in short period of time then I think you grab the increase. Similarly if you are working in a service industry and the wage increase causes the local manufacturing plant to shut down and so devastate the town&#8217;s economy you might think hard. But outside the agricultural processing sector I wouldn&#8217;t think that the general manufacturing wage was that close to minimum wage to start with. And unless there are barriers to mobility you always have the option to move to places that still have job opportunities.</p>
<p>When seems to suggest that the task for economists who claim that opposing minimum wage is such blindingly obvious policy to anyone rational is that they need to show that the net effect of such increases have such devastating income effects on the entire state, region, or nation that workers as a whole are in a structurally negative situation. It is not enough to show some minor correlation between minimum wage increases and teen unemployment. If such an increase helps me pay my rent and still leaves me availability to Big Macs and Pizza why should I rationally care that some resort somewhere has to cut back on housekeeping staff.</p>
<p>On my reading the whole thing reduces to exploiting Liberal Guilt for corporate profit. Bosses are not doing you a favor in keeping your wages suppressed. That argument on examination is threadbare.</p>

                                <p>By Stormy</p>
<p>Walden Bello in <a href="http://www.fpif.org/fpiftxt/5855" target="_blank">Foreign Policy in Focus</a> spells out what many here have been saying:<br />
<blockquote>
<p>As goods pile up in wharves from Bangkok to Shanghai, and workers are laid off in record numbers, people in East Asia are beginning to realize they aren&#8217;t only experiencing an economic downturn but living through the end of an era. </p>
<p>For over 40 years now, the cutting edge of the region&#8217;s economy has been export-oriented industrialization (EOI). Taiwan and Korea first adopted this strategy of growth in the mid-1960s, with Korean dictator Park Chung-Hee coaxing his country&#8217;s entrepreneurs to export by, among other measures, cutting off electricity to their factories if they refused to comply. </p>
<p>The success of Korea and Taiwan convinced the World Bank that EOI was the wave of the future. In the mid-1970s, then-Bank President Robert McNamara enshrined it as doctrine, preaching that &#8220;special efforts must be made in many countries to turn their manufacturing enterprises away from the relatively small markets associated with import substitution toward the much larger opportunities flowing from export promotion.&#8221; </p>
<p>The World Bank endorsed the establishment of export processing zones, where foreign capital could be married to cheap (usually female) labor. It also supported the establishment of tax incentives for exporters and, less successfully, promoted trade liberalization.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In short, export-oriented models were used to jump-start impoverished nations. Japan&#8211;like the U.S.&#8211;tried to tap into these platforms, using them to re-export goods back to Japan, the U.S., and elsewhere.<br />
<blockquote>One key dimension of this plan was to relocate not just big corporations like Toyota or Matsushita, but also small and medium enterprises that provided their inputs and components. Another was to integrate complementary manufacturing operations that were spread across the region in different countries. The aim was to create an Asia Pacific platform for re-export to Japan and export to third-country markets.</p></blockquote>
<p>The problem, of course, is that when behemoth China stepped onto the scales, the scales began to break.<br />
<blockquote>If Taiwan and Korea pioneered the model and Southeast Asia successfully followed in their wake, China perfected the strategy of export-oriented industrialization. With its reserve army of cheap labor unmatched by any country in the world, China became the &#8220;workshop of the world,&#8221; drawing in $50 billion in foreign investment annually by the first half of this decade. To survive, transnational firms had no choice but to transfer their labor-intensive operations to China to take advantage of what came to be known as the &#8220;China price,&#8221; provoking in the process a tremendous crisis in the advanced capitalist countries’ labor forces.</p></blockquote>
<p>With cheap credit in the industrialized economies and multinationals re-exporting from China, imbalances spiraled out of control.<br />
<blockquote>This process depended on the U.S. market. As long as U.S. consumers splurged, the export economies of East Asia could continue in high gear. The low U.S. savings rate was no barrier since credit was available on a grand scale. China and other Asian countries snapped up U.S. treasury bills and loaned massively to U.S. financial institutions, which in turn loaned to consumers and homebuyers. But now the U.S. credit economy has imploded, and the U.S. market is unlikely to serve as the same dynamic source of demand for a long time to come. As a result, Asia&#8217;s export economies have been marooned.</p></blockquote>
<p>The industrialized countries are now caught in a bind. To keep the model going, they must stimulate aggregate demand while increasing jobs. Unfortunately, having plugged into the &#8220;re-export&#8221; model&#8211;touting cheap goods&#8211;, they are not exactly sure what jobs to create.</p>
<p>At the same time, dependent upon wealthy consumers, Asian export economies are now in the lurch as their wealthy benefactors turn out empty pockets.<br />
<blockquote>
<p>The sudden end of the export era is going to have some ugly consequences. In the last three decades, rapid growth reduced the number living below the poverty line in many countries. In practically all countries, however, income and wealth inequality increased. But the expansion of consumer purchasing power took much of the edge off social conflicts. Now, with the era of growth coming to an end, increasing poverty amid great inequalities will be a combustible combination. </p>
<p>In China, about 20 million workers have lost their jobs in the last few months, many of them heading back to the countryside, where they will find little work. The authorities are rightly worried that what they label &#8220;mass group incidents,&#8221; which have been increasing in the last decade, might spin out of control. With the safety valve of foreign demand for Indonesian and Filipino workers shut off, hundreds of thousands of workers are returning home to few jobs and dying farms. Suffering is likely to be accompanied by rising protest, as it already has in Vietnam, where strikes are spreading like wildfire. Korea, with its tradition of militant labor and peasant protest, is a ticking time bomb. Indeed, East Asia may be entering a period of radical protest and social revolution that went out of style when export-oriented industrialization became the fashion three decades ago.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A noble idea, trade liberalization has it roots in the Johnson era. But all models have built-in contradictions&#8211;and this one is no exception.</p>
<p>The sheer size of China&#8211;and the rapidity with which exports platforms were built, without any regard to dangerous imbalances&#8211;simply crashed the system. Globalization as it was structured and blindly pursued has met a dead and dangerous end. More care should have been taken to process.</p>
<p>Vietnam, not long ago, was hailed as the next stop for the expanding export platform, the next &#8220;China.&#8221; Barely on the stage, Vietnam finds the theater rapidly emptying. Too much of a good thing is indeed too much.</p>
<p>One side of the world cannot export and the other side consume. It is not a matter of exhorting Americans to save and Chinamen to spend. It is not a matter of telling Americans to shift to other industries, as industry after industry is swallowed up. Nor is it a matter of telling Asians not to grab the brass ring, especially when ring after ring continues to appear.</p>
<p>It is a matter of paying attention to how growth is managed. That simply has not been done.</p>
<p>While corporate greed ran rampant, using export platforms for profit, those in charge of advancing this simple version of globalization cannot be accused of lack of heart. Indeed, they thought all would benefit. Well, no one benefits now. They should have given the process more thought and less heart.</p>
<p>Now, we return to where all ladders start.</p>
