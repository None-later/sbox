<p>Oil and gas companies should &#8220;use or lose&#8221; access to the 68 million publicly held acres where they can currently drill but aren&#8217;t. There&#8217;s no reason that companies should be able to lock up oil and gas reserves on publicly held land when we&#8217;ve made a choice as a nation to begin extraction in those locations.  Let&#8217;s find a company that will if that is our choice, with proper protections, and get on with it.  One year should be enough time to transfer ownership and re-direct government subsidies to companies that have get up and go.</p>
<p>Update:  Smiley face here.  I haven&#8217;t gone all radical dem.</p>
<p>Update 2:  Need access to proof there is little oil and gas in those acres.  Preferably geologic exploratory information.  The software is available to do just that, so anyone???</p>

<p>I&#8217;d like to thank Dan for putting up graphs from some of my previous posts, and for reminding people that I&#8217;m working on a book.  Here&#8217;s the status:  together with a co-author who currently wants to remain nameless, I completed a first draft of the book and went looking for an agent.  We found one who has a good publishing record, and who has represented authors of a few books that are as offbeat as ours.  He promptly told us the idea was good but the execution sucked.  He was right.  He made us write and rewrite the first chapter over and over until, if I might say so myself, it actually reads pretty well.  We&#8217;ve also benefited greatly from a few other reviewers &#8211; some of them Angry Bears and readers of the site.  Now that we know how its done, we&#8217;ve been working on some of the other chapters.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, our agent has been sniffing out publishers.  Recently, he chatted one up who was interested in seeing our proposal.  So we&#8217;ve written and rewritten and rewritten a proposal, and sent it to our agent.  Depending on his comments, it may be ready to go to the publisher.</p>
<p>What I&#8217;ve learned about the publishing industry is this &#8211; there&#8217;s a long leadtime between when a publisher signs a book and when it shows up on store shelves &#8211; about nine months.  Booksellers must be prepped.  </p>
<p>In our case, assuming a publisher signs us, the book would probably be available about a year from now.  This would be so that we could include complete data for the GW administration, comparing his administration to the others on an apples-to-apples basis.  </p>
<p>A few brief comments about my co-author.  As I noted, he wishes to remain nameless right now.  However, I think he wouldn&#8217;t mind if I mentioned that he writes on economic issues for a well-known newspaper.  As a result, he is very good at writing in a neutral tone, and he has done amazing work at ferreting out my biases from the writing as well.  I would also add &#8211; in terms of politics, my co-author is officially independent, though the one statement he was willing to make about his politics at the start of the project was that he did admire the first President Bush.  Of course, the data being what it is, it seems my co-author is somewhat less admiring of the first President Bush now, and regardless of our attempts to be nonpartisan, we will no doubt get called biased if and when the book gets published.<br />&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br />by cactus</p>

<p>Here is a quick update from GAO on the <a href="http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d08991t.pdf"> US Air Force Tanker procurement debacle</a>.  </p>
<p>Not to seem biased but “what were they thinking?” </p>
<p>An oral history on &#8220;requirements&#8221;.</p>
<p>In World War II it was obvious that the ability to haul short range, fighter aircraft around the ocean expanses would be critical to beating Japan and Germany in the naval wars.  There were no refueling aircraft to shepherd the fighters across the seas.</p>
<p>The standard navy line was to build a large fleet carriers, which were very fast ships and carried a large complement of aircraft.  The model was the carriers which won at Midway, large air arms mixed to engage in fleet combat, which is against other forces equipped with similar carriers.</p>
<p>The fleet carriers were very versatile and at huge expense could also engage in anti submarine warfare, convoy escort and delivering attack aircraft to newly secured airfields. </p>
<p>In 1942 the US Navy could send only one fleet carrier to the Atlantic, to support the convoys crossing the Atlantic as well as other missions.  Royal Navy air arms were busy keeping the Mediterranean open.  The US Navy ultimately ordered 30 Essex class fleet carriers of which delivered 24 by the end of the war.</p>
<p>Henry Kaiser delivered an &#8220;unsolicited proposal” to build escort carriers which were about a third the displacement of fleet carriers.  They supported a couple dozen aircraft while the fleet boats carried 3 or 4 times that number.</p>
<p>Kaiser delivered 50 escort carriers from the Kaiser shipyard in Washington State between Nov 1942 and July 1944. </p>
<p>These were the ships which ferried fighters to the invasions in the Pacific, they escorted convoys of US soldiers going to Britain and they were responsible in large part for ending the German submarine threat in the European theater.</p>
<p>What were the admirals thinking when they only ordered fleet carriers?</p>
<p>What was the US Air Force thinking when they ordered the aerial refueling version of fleet carriers when 99% of the mission needs jeep refuelers like the KC 135?</p>
<p>I will be viewed as biased if I report that all the talk about old aircraft ignores and subverts the fact that the KC-135 airframes have flown less than half the hours they were designed for and far fewer than the Boeing 707 has shown can be economically flown.</p>
<p>The admirals, like the US Air Force today only see big toys that can do every thing but miss the small numbers and high cost to do most of the missions.</p>
<p>More on making needs into requirements next time we I whittle a beak.<br />&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-<br />by ilsm</p>

<p>A reader at <a href="http://economistmom.com/2008/07/my-daughter-wants-a-trust-fund/">Economist Mom</a> offered the following story on her daughter wants a trust fund post.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; this post reminded me of an exchange I had with our five-year-old. I fronted him $10 for something he wanted when he forgot his wallet. When it was time to pay his allowance I told him he actually owed me money, so he got down his “monkey bank” and I started taking coins. He looked horrified, then he broke into tears&#8221;</p>
<p>This story broke my heart because I understand the way the five year old felt, and I was once as stupid as the parent.  Five year olds cannot understand &#8220;paying your bills&#8221; and &#8220;robbing my piggy bank&#8221; feels like a betrayal of trust.</p>
<p>Grownups should understand the relationship between &#8220;their money&#8221;  and  &#8220;their bills.&#8221;  But probably most of them are not much better at it than that five year old.  Most of the horrified sounds coming from the Entitlements &#8220;debate,&#8221;  are due to a complete failure of people to understand that they need to spend their own money in order to pay for their own food and medical care after they are too old to work. When you collect their payroll tax they cry.  Actually most people don&#8217;t notice until someone tells them that the tax is going to go up fifty percent! or a hundred percent!  or whatever misleading number the hystericizer thinks he can get away with today.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s look at the most alarming number:  The Trustees say that by 2085, Social Security and Medicare will cost 30% of payroll&#8230;  this is greater than your entire tax bill today,  it is a hundred percent increase in &#8220;the&#8221; tax.  It is a crushing burden on &#8220;the young.&#8221;  And of course, &#8220;We&#8217;re all going to die.&#8221;  I forgot all the exclamation marks, so here they are:  !!!!!</p>
<p>One thing that always bothers me is that when I point out the worker will only &#8220;see&#8221; half of that 30%, someone always tells me that &#8220;economists agree&#8221; that the other half is &#8220;really&#8221; the employees money.<br />Well, of course it is,  and you know better than I do if you would ever see that money if the government didn&#8217;t force your boss to pay it to you (to you?  to you!),  but I know the bosses think of it as &#8220;their&#8221; money when there are no workers listening.</p>
<p>But here is something: If the other half is really your money,  then your income is not 100% of your paycheck before deductions.  It is 115%.  The extra 15% is the boss&#8217;s contribution to your &#8220;entitlements.&#8221;<br />But then, wait a minute,  if I am paying 30% of my paycheck before deductions, I am actually paying 30% of 115%, or 26% of my &#8220;income.&#8221;  And here I have to realize that no one will understand what I just said.</p>
<p>Suppose your before taxes pay is 1000.  you pay 150 dollars in payroll tax and your boss pays another 115 dollars.  But he says that is &#8220;really&#8221; your money.  So your &#8220;real&#8221; pay was &#8220;really&#8221; 1150 dollars. And your &#8220;real&#8221; tax was &#8220;really&#8221; 300 dollars.  300/1150  =  26%.  Your &#8220;real&#8221; tax is &#8220;really&#8221; 26%</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if this helps you feel better.  I should stop and let you rest, but below the fold, I&#8217;ll pick up on the five year old and the piggybank story.<br />&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;<br />This one written by coberly</p>
<p>There you are in 2085&#8230;  of course you are going to get there.  And everything is going to be just the same as it is today.  Except that you will be paying this huge &#8220;entitlement&#8221; tax.  If you will let me call it 15% I will agree to remember it&#8217;s really 30% and the boss&#8217;s half is &#8220;really&#8221; your money.  But it&#8217;s easier to keep track of if we just talk about the numbers printed on your paycheck.  And leave the &#8220;what if&#8221; questions to those economists.</p>
<p>What the hystericizers always leave out is that the Trustees&#8230; the very people who are saying that Social Security and Medicare will be 30% of payroll &#8230; also say that incomes will be going up 1.1% per year&#8230; this is real income&#8230;   income to employees,  leaving the rest of the 1.7% of real productivity growth to find its way to your boss.  (oh!  that&#8217;s where the boss&#8217;s share comes from.)  But lets see, 1.1% compounded for the next 77 years is 232%.  Your wages will be 2 and one third times as big as they are today.</p>
<p>And now, gentle reader, lets stop talking in percents because they are confusing to most people.</p>
<p>Average income today is about 700 dollars per week.  232% of 700 dollars is $1,624 dollars per week.  That&#8217; what an average worker will be making in real dollars in 2085.  Out of that he will be paying 244 dollars for his Social Security and Medicare, leaving him 1380 for his other bills, including other taxes.  How&#8217;s he doing compared to today?  Well today he pays about 7 and a half percent for Social Security and Medicare&#8230; 700 time 0.075 equals  53 dollars a week.  leaving him $647 dollars per week for his other bills, including other taxes.  That means that in 2085 he will have 1380 &#8211; 647  = 733 dollars per week after paying payroll taxes MORE than he has today. Or about twice as much. </p>
<p>Well, so what?  Why should he settle for 205% when he is making 232% more than he was 77 years ago?  Well, because the extra money is going into a piggy bank to pay for his food and shelter and clothing and medical care after he retires&#8230; in case he wants to, or has to, retire when he is 65 instead of working until he is ready for the feeding tube.</p>
<p>Wait.  Why are you crying?</p>

                                <p>Somehow the concept of means testing has entered the Social Security dialogue right along side that of cap increases. Don&#8217;t let people trick you into going down that path. Each seems on the surface to be a reasonable and progressive step but instead they are being dangled in front of you by people opposed to Social Security to begin with.</p>
<p>The strength of Social Security is precisely in its insurance model. Eliminate the cap without increasing benefits and you move it to a welfare model. Means test it and you do the same thing in any even more exaggerated way. These people simply want to undercut political support for Social Security among the upper middle class by removing their stake in the system.</p>
<p>I bring this up because this has been floated by two people I consider to be trolls on this issue, one here and one at another site. Plus it seems to be floating around in the outside world to the point that is sparked a column in Newsday <a href="http://www.newsday.com/news/columnists/ny-bzsaul125761184jul12,0,438146.column">GRAY MATTERS: Do the wealthy deserve Social Security benefits?</a> (the columnist was opposed to means testing). All of which leads me to believe it is a talking point that is being deliberately spread, which then leads me to want to nip this right in the bud.</p>
<p>Social Security is a carefully balanced political mechanism, once people get it in their heads to tinker with it there is a good chance it will end up broken beyond repair. As Dean Baker warned us in Phony Crisis<br />
<blockquote>We have a chance, said President Clinton, to “fix the roof while the sun is still shining.” He was talking about dealing with Social Security immediately, while the economy is growing and the federal budget is balanced. The audience was a regional conference on Social Security, in Kansas City, Missouri, that the White House had helped bring together.</p>
<p>The roof analogy is illuminating, but we can make it more accurate. Imagine that it’s not going to rain for more than 30 years. And the rain, when it does arrive (and it might not), will be pretty light. And imagine that the average household will have a lot more income for roof repair by the time the rain approaches.</p>
<p>Now add this: most of the people who say they want to fix the roof actually want to knock holes in it.</p></blockquote>
<p> So when someone comes at you with a proposal for a means test, make sure they aren&#8217;t hiding a sledgehammer.</p>

                                <p>FA ask&#8221;Real after-tax income per person has risen by 9.6 percent – $2,840 – since the President took office&#8221;</p>
<p>If this is true, then how can the claims of the Left that American incomes have been declining be true?</p>
<p>This is exactly how political spin is done.  Cite a number that is big.  OK, over 7 years real per capital after tax income rose 9.6%.</p>
<p>Sounds good.</p>
<p>That works out to be about 1.3% per year.</p>
<p>So how does 1.3% per year look compared to historic norms.</p>

<p>Pretty poor.  But that is what political spin is.  Quote a big number that sounds good and count on the public or the reporter to not be able to put it in perspective.</p>
<p>FA falls for it every time and does not understand why people here at Angry Bear that have actually put these claims in perspective do not take him seriously.</p>

<p>Many interesting claims are made during political campaigns. Many of them are factually correct, but misleading.</p>
<p>One of these is the standard claim that small businesses create 70% of the jobs in the US economy. It is true. But the US economy is one where firms both create and destroy jobs.<br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SHtmrsfYqsI/AAAAAAAAATM/LfvloCUKzHQ/s1600-h/Clipboard01.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SHtmrsfYqsI/AAAAAAAAATM/LfvloCUKzHQ/s320/Clipboard01.jpg" border="0"></a>The Small Business Administration and the Census have studied jobs created by firm size. The above chart shows the results from this survey that takes into account both jobs created and jobs destroyed by firms with under 500 employees and firms with over 500 employees. It is <a href="http://www.census.gov/csd/susb/susbdyn.htm">here</a>.</p>
<p>The study also looked at salaries at small and large firms. It found that in 2003 that the average<br />pay in large firms was $39,721 while in small firms it was $31,655 or 20% less.</p>
<p>Economic theory posits that individuals pay is a function of their productivity and this salary data implies that productivity in large firms is significantly larger than at small firms. Since small firms accounting for just over 50% of employment this significantly lower implied productivity strongly suggest that small businesses account for well under 50% of GDP. But the SBA commissioned an econometric study that found small firms accounts for well over 50% of GDP.<br />Their study assumes that large firms purchase sufficient input or components from small firms to offset the smaller share of GDP implied by the lower salaries. Needless to say, I have major problems with this study.</p>

<p>Monday, May 14, 2007<br />Comparing Presidents, Comparing Parties by cactus</p>
<p>Regular readers know I’m not a rabid Democrat. My own opinion, stated several times, is that the best that can be said about the Democrats is that they’re better than the Republicans. Considering what the Republican party looks like in my opinion, we’re not talking much of an endorsement. Still, I didn’t reach my conclusions blindly. I looked at data. Regular readers know that here at Angry Bear, we do that a lot. </p>
<p>Now, one thing I’ve done on occasion is to look at performance by President. Its simplistic, but when you look at enough series, it starts to tell a story, even if you don’t do it systematically. And doing it systematically is hard &#8211; sometimes data goes back only to 1980, sometimes it goes back farther. Sometimes I combined short administrations (JFK + LBJ and Nixon + Ford) and sometimes I didn’t. Nevertheless, in every case, my sources are clearly stated, and almost every time, the data comes straight off a government website. In many cases, I still have my spreadsheets lying around somewhere and you’re welcome to them. Here’s what I’ve found so far:</p>
<p><strong>Economic Issues</strong></p>
<p>1. <em>Real GDP less per capita</em>. The fastest annualized growth in real GDP per capita occurred under JFK/LBJ. It was followed by Reagan and Clinton, under whom real GDP per capita grew at about the same rate. Then Carter. Then Nixon/Ford, GW, Ike, and GHW. Put another way… out of eight administrations, Democrats make up three of the four fastest growing administrations, and Republicans make up the four slowest growing administrations.</p>
<p>2. <em>Real GDP less federal debt per capita</em>. Because Federal Government spending is added to GDP, it makes sense to remove debt. Going back to 1960, JFK/LBJ, Clinton, and Carter showed the fastest annual increase in real GDP less federal debt per capita. The Republican under whom this measure of wealth grew the fastest was Reagan, and yet he achieved an increase of less than 60% as much per year as Carter. (This was largely due to Reagan’s financing the growth through debt.) I should note that in this same post, I showed that this happened despite the fact that the Federal Reserve generally had more expansionary monetary policy when Republicans were in office. (Exception: JFK/LBJ also benefited from very favorable monetary policy.)</p>
<p>(as an aside to 1. and 2. – I also looked at <em>performance according to which party controls Congress.</em> It turns out that growth is faster with Democratic majorities in Congress than with Republican majorities – regardless of the party affiliation of the President.)</p>
<p>3. <em>National Debt</em>. Beginning with Ike’s term, the biggest annualized percentage increases in the debt per capita have occurred under Reagan, GHW, and GW. (At one point, Republicans could have been described as fiscally conservative. Clearly, that hasn’t been true at least since Reagan won the Republican nomination in 1980.) </p>
<p>4. <em>Real tax collections</em>. When debt is a concern, paying it off is important. We’ve already seen that Republican administrations are less likely to grow their way out of debt. So what about tax collections? Going back to 1952, the administrations with the fastest annual growth in real tax collections per capita were JFK, Clinton, Carter, and LBJ, followed distantly by each of the Republican administration. (The figure for Ike’s term – the fastest for any Republican, was just over one third the figure for the slowest Democrat – LBJ.) </p>
<p>5. <em>Value of the Dollar</em>. The Federal Reserve maintains a price adjusted broad dollar index. Data is available through Ford’s term. Only under Clinton and Reagan did the dollar rise in value (and by more than twice as much under Clinton than under Reagan). In November, when I did the analysis, GW came in third, ahead of Carter. Given recent trends, I wonder how many people would bet on GW ending his term ahead of Carter in this measure.</p>
<p>6. <em>Health care costs</em>. The face of healthcare changed a lot in the 1960s when JFK and LBJ created the “Great Society.” Since LBJ left office, annualized real private healthcare expenditures per capita increased more slowly under both Clinton and Carter than under any Republican President. (Even LBJ would have ranked third best among the Republicans, behind Ford and Nixon, but better than Reagan, GHW, and GW.) And real total (public and private) healthcare costs per capita? Once again, Clinton and Carter did better than any of the Republicans in the sample.</p>
<p>(Rdan here:  I will be re-posting the graphs researched and created by cactus after consultation with him.  I will re-arrange their order to suit well remembered objection in comments, such as lag time theory, business cycle comaparisons, the FED influence, and Make up of Congress&#8230;.and yes, policy.)</p>
<p>Summary.</p>
<p>For economic issues I’ve looked at, it seems to be a slam dunk. Republicans simply performed worse. On every measure. Period. End of story. </p>
<p>For social issues… Republicans did better on teen cigarette, alcohol, and drug use. GHW also managed to do well on containing gonorrhea, though not much else. (And by “not much else”, I mean not only at not containing other STDs, but really, truly, not much else, whether in the social or economic sphere.) Otherwise… whether reducing the incidence of abortion, decreasing teen motherhood, encouraging marriage, reducing the incidence of most STDs, or cutting teen violent crimes, Democrats did better.</p>
<p>I look at this list and a few thoughts come to mind:<br />1. Its possible to explain any of these series as a coincidence or the fault of a business cycle or demographics or whatnot. But all of them, or even most of them? At some point, one has to conclude that either God punishes us for voting Republican, or Republican policies are simply more damaging than Democratic policies.</p>
<p>2. This post is starting to look pretty long. I’ll write up my explanation of what I think is going on another post some time soon. The short answer, as noted just above, is that I think Republican policies are harmful.</p>
<p>3. This really looks like a book… I gotta find the time to write it. Or find someone who can do much of the writing.</p>
