They note that <a href="http://www.economicindicators.gov/">this nifty site</a> run by the government, basically a repository for some useful reports from the BEA and the Census will be discontinued in March.</p>
<p>Repositories like this are needed, even if the data exists elsewhere, because data can be very, very hard to find at some government run sites.  I have a miserable time extracting info from the Treasury site, for instance, and the Census Bureau&#8217;s site doesn&#8217;t win many prizes for ease of use in my book.  I don&#8217;t expect them to use the vast sums of money they save discontinuing this site to improve their other sites that really need a lot of help.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d bet they&#8217;re more likely to take a look at what may be the <a href="http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/">most useful repository of all</a> and try to figure out how to make it go away.  And maybe <a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/">lean on the Fed</a> while they&#8217;re at it.  In fact, to make this administration look good, there are other sites <a href="http://www.bea.gov/">they&#8217;re</a> <a href="http://www.bls.gov/">going</a> <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2009/hist.html">to</a> <a href="http://cdc.gov/DataStatistics/">have</a> <a href="http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/aer/contents.html">to</a> <a href="http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/">kill</a>.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>The NY Times has an interesting chart in its blog post entitled <a href="http://theboard.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/02/12/about-those-bush-tax-cuts-for-the-rich">About Those Bush Tax Cuts for the Rich</a>.  As one who often talks about total Federal debt and not debt held by the public, I could go nuts over this graph’s use of the latter but by 2050, some projections have the Social Security Trust Fund reserves going to zero so maybe the implications for the debt to GDP ratio in 2050 are worth noting:</p>
<blockquote><p>All else being equal, if the tax cuts are made permanent &#8211; without making up for the lost revenue by raising other taxes or cutting spending &#8211; debt-to-GDP will rise inexorably starting after 2010, reaching 100 percent in 2035 and more than 200 percent in 2050. Courting debt loads of that magnitude implies severe economic distress.  In contrast, if the tax cuts are allowed to expire, debt-to-GDP will dip a bit in the decades to come and then rise rapidly, to 100 percent by 2050, pushed up mainly by rising health care costs. That’s still a big problem, but not nearly as big as it will be if the tax cuts are also extended. And since most of the rise will take place after 2035, policymakers will have time to try to address the problem before it explodes.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is a very succinct statement of our fiscal choices.  It is one that the fiscal hawks in the Democratic Party should repeat over and over especially when some GOP hack that wants to replace George W. Bush says we should make those 2001 and 2003 tax cuts permanent.  I do have a problem with what follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>From the chart, it may seem at first glance that the debt explosion is a problem for the distant future. Look again.  Decision time is no later than 2010, when the lines diverge. It will be up to the next president and the Congress to put the nation on a healthy budget path &#8211; or not.</p></blockquote>
<p>While I’d rather address the long-run fiscal policy problems sooner rather than later, this unified deficit accounting trickery is what is often abused by certain folks (including the Washington Post according to Dean Baker) to make us think we have an imminent Social Security crisis.  I’d rather have their chart plot out the project time path of the total Federal debt to GDP ratio, which already is around 65 percent – not that 37 percent figure reported by the NY Times.</p>

                                <p>Municipal Bonds and Code Red</p>
<p>We always seem to be behind the curve; always reacting, seldom proacting. Two very disparate pieces interest me: One an article, the other a report. Both have common elements, although it may be strange that I am yoking them together like some awkward sixteenth century metaphysical English poet.</p>
<p>The first is a disturbing article in <a href="http://www.forbes.com/reuters/feeds/reuters/2008/02/12/2008-02-13T014640Z_01_N12643036_RTRIDST_0_HOLD-MUNICIPALS-AUCTION-RATE-SOURCES-UPDATE-2.html">Forbes</a> regarding auctions of municipal bonds.<br />
<blockquote>On Feb. 12, two muni auctions failed, and experts said that was the first time this had ever happened. Conditions have only worsened since then, they explained.</p></blockquote>
<p>Municipalities will have to pay higher short-term interest rates. Not good. Fed lowers rates; mortgage rates go up. Municipalities will pay higher rates as well. &#8220;Conditions have only worsened since then,&#8221; we are told. I hesitate to say what this forebodes. Let spring come soon. We need to smell the flowers.</p>
<p>The second is an equally disturbing piece, a study at <a href="http://www.carbonequity.info/">Carbon Equity</a> entitled &#8220;Climate Code Red.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again, we are behind the curve. Scientific studies are always two to three years old before they find the light of day. Collect the data; test the hypothesis; send it to an editor; peer reviewed and challenged, emended, corrected.</p>
<p>Remember how I am always yammering that a prior IPCC report said Arctic Sea Ice Melt was decades a way (2030)? Yet, a year or two later, it seems to be occurring?</p>
<p>&#8220;Code Red&#8221; hammers this point home with additional force. This summer, we saw the disappearance of 460,000 square miles of sea ice, &#8220;roughly the size of California and Texas combined.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>As well, large areas of the Arctic sea-ice are now only one metre deep, which means the thickness of the ice has halved since 2001 (Bjornes, 2007), down from 3.5 metres in the early 1960s, and about 2.5 metres in the late 1980s and early 1990s (Blakemore and Sandell, 2006)&#8230;.When the sea-ice thins to around half a metre in thickness, it will be subject to even more rapid disintegration</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>In addition, it now appears that winter sea-ice is not resetting fully. Mark Serreze told the AGU meeting that “We had always thought, that at least in the early stages of climate warming, that the Arctic sea-ice would recover in the autumn” because “after all even with the globally warmed world, winter happens in the Arctic, we’ll still have refreeze of that ice,” but “what we’re starting to see is that winter ice is not recovering any more… We see that at the end of November we have two-million square kilometres less ice than we should have in a typical year” (ABC, 2007c). </p></blockquote>
<p>And now studies say King Penguin is having trouble. Waters are getting a bit too warm for his food to survive, apparently. (He&#8217;s at the other end of the earth, you know.) I just can&#8217;t go there. Bears and Penguins, Penguins and Bears&#8230;the more you know, the more you should care.</p>
<p>What is now even more disturbing is that the Arctic Sea melt could kick start Greenland, even without &#8220;without adding one more tonne of human emissions to the atmosphere.&#8221; Tipping points may be like close-standing dominoes. Touch one; touch all.</p>
<p>Economically, we seem to have arranged another precarious line of dominoes.</p>
<p>Municipal bonds are the latest. What will we learn from all this?</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p><a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080213/ap_on_el_pr/campaign_rdp">Jerry Estill</a> reports that President Bush, Senator McCain, and Senator Clinton are partly responsible for our current economic woes because they failed to actively oppose the invasion of Iraq:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a Washington where politicians like John McCain and Hillary Clinton voted for a war in Iraq that should&#8217;ve never been authorized and never been waged &#8211; a war that is costing us thousands of precious lives and billions of dollars a week&#8221; that could be used on infrastructure, job training and health care.</p></blockquote>
<p>I agree that there was a huge opportunity cost in diverting as many resources as we did to our occupation of Iraq and these resources could have been directed towards infrastructure, job training and health care.  But to say an increase in government spending leads to a fall in aggregate demand strikes me as quite odd.  </p>
<p>The usual line of reasoning for this theme seems to be some sort of indirect impact on residential investment, which of course has plummeted.  But those who emphasize the residential investment angle have a couple of different – and perhaps contradictory – channels.  Some would argue that the Federal Reserve kept interest rates too low, which lead to over-investment ala the <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2007/06/25/amid-financial-excess-a-revival-of-austrian-economics-in-basel">Austrian school of economics</a>.  But trying to tie this to what Senator Obama said has the following problem – fiscal stimulus tends to increase interest rates.  </p>
<p>Then again – the housing bubble burst followed a period where the Federal Reserve did increase interest rates.  When the Federal Reserve was increasing interest rates, however, the thought was it needed to do so to avoid demand pull inflation.  The continued fiscal folly of the Bush Administration was sort of like the 1981 fiscal folly under President Reagan.  And the Federal Reserve slammed on the monetary brakes back then very hard, which led to the 1982 recession.  Maybe we are watching a repeat of this horrific mix between fiscal stimulus and tight money.  If we are, there are lots of things adding to the fiscal folly besides the stupid war, such as those tax cuts that John McCain now loves and that prescription drug benefit that Bush keeps bragging out.  </p>
<p>With all of this said – Obama’s rhetoric here strikes me as a real stretch!  After all, ending the war today and lowering defense spending (which I’d support) would reduce aggregate demand.</p>

                                <p>This post is by Sammy&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/dn/opinion/points/stories/DN-roddreher_08edi.ART.State.Edition1.43a648c.html">This</a> editorial reflects the angst often expressed on this blog, only it&#8217;s from the conservative side:</p>
<blockquote><p>Conservatives have to come to terms with the fact that capitalism, in its current form, undermines not only the virtues necessary to the kind of society conservatives claim to want, but ultimately risks subverting itself.</p>
<p>Capitalism is an ingenious system for increasing material prosperity. It succeeded historically because the free market is the most rational device for meeting human wants and needs. It also thrived because it rewarded creativity and industriousness, and encouraged both qualities. And the most prosperous people under capitalism tended to be those who understood the value of self-denial and delayed gratification.</p>
<p>Today, however, capitalism is defined not by a producer mentality but by a consumer ethos. The prosperity we see is in some respects a mirage, purchased with a credit card. According to U.S. government statistics, the personal savings rate recently dipped into negative territory for the first time since 1933. Consumers are buying more and more stuff we can&#8217;t afford. When bills come due, the whole pyramid scheme stands to collapse.</p>
<p>Our consumerist economy depends on people&#8217;s inability to discipline their consumption. The best consumer sees no reason why he shouldn&#8217;t have what he wants, right now. The best consumer, in other words, exists in a perpetual state of childishness. </p></blockquote>
<p>This reminds me of ancient Rome:</p>
<blockquote><p>Democracy requires virtue. So does a healthy capitalism. A nation that cannot govern its own appetites will, in time, be unable to govern itself. An economy that divorces economic activity from the restraining virtues that make for good stewardship will implode. </p></blockquote>
<p>Finally:</p>
<blockquote><p>Socialism is not the answer. But we can&#8217;t pretend that our prosperity does not present us with serious civic problems. <em>Consumer capitalism contains within its unfolding dynamic the seeds of its own destruction, to say nothing of the way it chews up traditional loyalties to faith, family, community and place.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>(italics mine)</p>
<p>You guys think big government is the answer.  I disagree.  But as of now, I don&#8217;t have a different answer.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>This one was by Sammy.</p>
<p>Cactus here&#8230; I can&#8217;t speak for anyone else, but here&#8217;s what I think is the answer:</p>
<p>Enforcement of laws.  No matter how big or small one thinks the government should be, it is hard to argue that setting the rules and enforcing them is the domain of anyone but the government.  We give a monopoly on violence to the government in order that there be rules to make an orderly society possible.</p>
<p>Such enforcement has to extend to everyone.  That includes those in government, and those who come from the right families, have fatter wallets, or are celebrities.  When average people see that there are protected classes that can cheat with impunity, their interest in maintaining the status quo by not cheating themselves goes away.</p>
<p>Such enforcement requires both punishment and mercy.  But if the mercy is reserved for protected classes, the system breaks down.</p>
<p>But as I write this, it occurs to me that there is something else that is needed, and it doesn&#8217;t come from government (though a leader might inspire it), it comes from us.  See, there are many things that are not illegal, but which cause a lot of damage.  There are the actions of the hacks and bamboozlers &#8211; something I often rant about.  They lead us down paths we should not take, paths that even the hacks and the bamboozlers knew we shouldn&#8217;t take.  There are liars and the rumor-mongers, whose slander creates the impression of injustice even when that injustice does not exist.  And then there are the folks dedicated to finding technicalities around the rules, subverting the purpose and all of the benefits of a civilized society.  </p>
<p>These things cannot be combated by government.  They have to be combated by us.  We have to encourage honest disagreement, and yet still turn our backs in disgust when the Harvard professor or the business school dean or the senior fellow or the TV show host walk into a room because grifters cannot be tolerated.  We have to encourage the spread of information, but still turn, even to those with whom we generally agree, and say, &#8220;No sir, much as I would like to believe it, your facts are wrong&#8221; when they repeat a falsehood, whether on purpose or inadvertently.  These are things we all have to do, and all fail to do often enough.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>Correction&#8230; added the word &#8220;not&#8221; before &#8220;illegal.&#8221;</p>

<p>A reminder:  I think I was treated very fairly.  Some Angry Bear readers who heard the broadcast agreed.  So I will let you know if I&#8217;m on again, or if he covers economic issues again, which he clearly intends to do.</p>
<p>Again, his show is (generally) on Mondays and Fridays and can be heard <a href="http://1220wkrs.com/pages/93518.php">here</a> and his blog is <a href="http://www.extremewisdom.com/">here</a>.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>I listened to John McCain’s Virginia victory speech last night as was thoroughly disgusted at its dishonesty and neo-McCarthyism.  If anyone has a transcript, please let me know.  In the meantime, we have what <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/02/dog-eating-jew.html">Brad DeLong</a> had to say:</p>
<blockquote><p>A correspondent tells me that beside John McCain as he gave his Virginia victory speech was the dog-eating Jew-counter himself, Fred Malek &#8211; the man who accepted from Richard Nixon the mission of trying to identify and fire the nest of Jews working in the Bureau of Labor Statistics whom Nixon was sure were plotting to undermine him.  That&#8217;s the modern Republican Party: paranoia, bigotry, and a craven eagerness to do everything possible to assist the criminal enterprises of your highers-up &#8211; it&#8217;s not a disqualification, it&#8217;s a lifestyle. Shut down the Republican Party as quickly as possible. America needs an honorable opposition party to face off against the Democrats.</p></blockquote>
<p>My sentiments exactly!</p>
<p>Update: I found a <a href="http://youdecide08.foxnews.com/2008/02/12/raw-data-text-of-mccains-potomac-primaries-victory-speech">text</a> of McCain’s speech.  Let’s review.  </p>
<blockquote><p>They will promise a new approach to governing, but offer only the policies of a political orthodoxy that insists the solution to government’s failures is to simply make it bigger. They will appeal to our dreams of a better future for ourselves, our families and our country, but they would take from us more of the wealth we have earned to build those dreams and assure us that government is better able than we are to make decisions about our future for us.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, Republican Presidents have downsized the government?  Excuse me but this did not happen under Ronald Reagan.  It did happen under Bill Clinton.  George W. Bush increased the size of the government.  McCain either does not understand the facts or he’s being dishonest here. </p>
<blockquote><p>They will paint a picture of the world in which America’s mistakes are a greater threat to our security than the malevolent intentions of an enemy that despises us and our ideals; a world that can be made safer and more peaceful by placating our implacable foes and breaking faith with allies and the millions of people in this world for whom America, and the global progress of our ideals, has long been “the last, best hope of Earth.”  We will offer different ideas, based in a better understanding of the challenges we face, and the resolve to confront them with confidence in the strength and ideals of free people. We believe that Americans, not our detractors and certainly not our enemies, are on the right side of history. We trust in the strength, industry and goodness of the American people.</p></blockquote>
<p>McCain is still playing attacking Saddam Hussein was attacking Al Qaeda canard.  But the decision to depose Saddam Hussein played right into Osama bin Laden’s hands as it gave him what he failed to achieve with 9/11 – getting the US bogged down in an occupation of a Muslim nation.  To claim that the neocons have a “better understanding of the challenges we face” is ludicrous on its face.  McCain has yet to understand that the decision on 3/19/2003 was a colossal mistake.  </p>
<p>But when he accuses we Democrats of not recognizing that Al Qaeda is a threat and that we wish to placate these terrorists, he clearly has decided to be today’s version of Senator Joseph McCarthy.  The truth is that we Democrats – as noted by Senator Obama last night – would have devoted more resources in 2002 to going after bin Laden and his crew.  Alas, the Bush Administration diverted resources from Afghanistan and towards Iraq.  And of course, the invasion and occupation of Iraq has helped Al Qaeda immensely.  If McCain has been paying any attention to reality, he would know this.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>As the CNN team was noting how well Senator Obama did today, Paul Begala suggested that Team Clinton needs to win over Edwards voters by adopting some of the Edwards populist themes in her speeches.  How prophetic as just a few minutes later, CNN cuts away to an El Paso, Texas speech by Senator Clinton.  It was an impressive little rally in which she made a lot of promises to the audience including a $9.50 minimum wage for full-time workers. </p>
<p>Something tells me that she’ll got a lot of criticism from the right who’ll say that a $9.50 an hour minimum wage will create a lot of unemployment.  OK – time to check some facts and turn the clock back 40 years (1968) when the nominal wage was a mere $1.60 an hour.  But it seems that the consumer price index in 2007 was 5.96 times the consumer price index in 1968 according to the <a href="http://www.bls.gov/">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> (BLS).  So in 2007$, the real minimum wage was $9.53 an hour.  Besides, a President Clinton would not likely be signing any such bill until 2009 when the consumer price index will likely be 1.05 times what it was in 2007.  This implies a real minimum wage equal to only $9.05 an hour in 2007$ or 95% of the real minimum wage back in 1968.   </p>
<p>Before you wonder how high the unemployment rate jumped in 1968, be warn that BLS reports that it was only 3.5 percent or so back in 1968.  I’m not saying that a higher real minimum wage won’t create some market dislocations, but let’s be mindful of the actual evidence as we read the hype from the right.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/23131149">AP</a> knows how to write a shock and awe lead:</p>
<blockquote><p>The federal budget deficit is running at a pace that is more than double last year’s imbalance through the first four months of the budget year.</p></blockquote>
<p>But this was for the four months from October to January with:</p>
<blockquote><p>For January, the surplus totaled $17.8 billion. That was down from a January 2007 surplus of $38.2 billion. The government’s books are often in surplus in January because it is a month when many individual taxpayers make a quarterly estimated payment.</p></blockquote>
<p>If this story was not already silly enough, AP reports what the White House is saying about future projected deficits:</p>
<blockquote><p>While the administration is projecting that the deficit for the current 2008 budget year will total $410 billion and decline only slightly to $407 billion in 2009, it projects a significant improvement after those years.  Bush’s budget said that the president’s goal of getting the budget back into balance in 2012, three years after he leaves office, is still achievable, forecasting a balance that year of $48 billion.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, AP did say private forecasters called this unrealistic but it might have helped the reader know why if AP bothered to itemize all the assumptions one has to make to get to the rosy forecast – such as Bush not getting his way on making those tax cuts permanent.</p>
