<p>
<blockquote>Yeah, yeah, the system&#8217;s stuffed, but that&#8217;s a problem for you yanks. What I as an Australian want to ask you, as economists, is how America can have a competitive economy under these constraints. You have approximately 1% of the population in gaol and another 1% looking after them, 2% of the population in the prison system where most other nations have at the outside 1%; that&#8217;s pure loss. You have a military that&#8217;s between .6% and 1.2% of the population, depending on how you count reserves, and that&#8217;s what, 2-3% of GNP? in any case, vastly higher than any other developed country. In other words, between the correctional system and the military you&#8217;re taking about 5% of GNP and pissing it up against the wall, compared to 2% everywhere else. And you&#8217;re still surviving and under some measures almost thriving. Is the US economic system really 3% better than anywhere else, allowing you to compete on a more or less even footing? I&#8217;ve never seen an economist address the point, and it&#8217;s driving me crazy.</p></blockquote>
<p>My comments&#8230;<br />1. Why do people continue to bring up this fictional &#8220;Australia&#8221;?<br />2. I suspect this 3% we&#8217;re pissing away is partly made up, or more likely completely made up and then some, but the fact that the dollar is still the world&#8217;s defacto currency. A lot of dollars get printed by the Fed &#8211; which means given to the Treasury (in exchange for bonds) for the Federal government to spend &#8211; which after a bit of time end up in pallets in the home of a Columbian drug lord or in a plastic bag 2 feet below the ground outside the home of Bhuttanese yak herder. By virtue of being taken out of circulation after it gets spent by the Federal government, that dollar can be spent without contributing to inflation, allowing for more monetary stimulus at very very low cost. And the demand for that dollar by Colmbian drug lords and Bhuttanese yak herders, to say nothing of the Central Banks all over the world, keeps the interest (i.e., rent on that dollar) low&#8230; allowing for more fiscal stimulus at very very low cost. Lots of stimulus with no associated pain means lots of growth.<br />3. Its possible the big military is part of the reason the dollar is still the world&#8217;s de facto currency.<br />4. No currency stays the world&#8217;s de facto currency forever. A hundred years ago, the pound sterling is where the dollar is now. And it wasn&#8217;t pretty for a long time in England when the pound sterling got pushed off its perch.</p>

<blockquote><p>I&#8217;d bet large sums of money that Giuliani himself doesn&#8217;t believe that it&#8217;s merely a &#8220;liberal Democratic assumption that if you raise taxes, you raise more money,&#8221; but like with his health care plan, is just adopting positions for their utility in attacking Democrats, rather than their integrity as policy plans.  This is only a viable approach for him because he&#8217;s smartly manipulating two dynamics. The first is that the press won&#8217;t call him on it. Read Matt&#8217;s round-up of the uncritical stenography accorded to Giuliani&#8217;s comments. If every time Giuliani uttered this bit of economic absurdity, the reporter appended a comment explaining that most economists consider this a laughable bit of hackish quackery, he&#8217;d stop saying it &#8230; Giuliani&#8217;s second enabler is the cowardice of his fellow candidates. These comments on the Laffer curve came at a GOP presidential debate. Anyone on the stage could&#8217;ve smacked him down. And one of the most visible of the participants, Mitt Romney, has hired Gregory Mankiw as one of his two primary economic advisors. That would be the same Gregory Mankiw who responded to pro-Laffer curve comments by McCain with a weary &#8220;unfortunately, fealty to the most extreme supply-side views is de rigeur in some segments of the Republican party.&#8221; But his candidate, who surely knows better or Mankiw isn&#8217;t doing his job, said nothing to contradict Giuliani. Not a word. One wonders why Professor Mankiw is lending his credibility to an individual so willing to abet the propagation of &#8220;extreme&#8221; views.</p></blockquote>
<p>I have only one qualification with respect to what Ezra said.  Remember, I actually watched this display of <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/08/does-rudy-giuliani-think-andrew-samwick.html">fiscal dishonesty</a> live on Sunday morning.  Mitt Romney said he agreed with Rudy’s Laffer nonsense.  I have Mitt Romney make this free lunch supply-side claim several times.  I have yet to see Greg Mankiw call Mr. Romney on this dishonesty.  Greg?</p>

                                <p>As a follow-up to my post on lost weapons in Iraq the other day, I note that I&#8217;ve seen a bunch of people link to a <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/05/AR2007080501299.html?hpid=topnews">Washington Post</a> story:</p>
<blockquote><p>The United States has spent $19.2 billion trying to develop Iraqi security forces since 2003, the GAO said, including at least $2.8 billion to buy and deliver equipment. But the GAO said weapons distribution was haphazard and rushed and failed to follow established procedures, particularly from 2004 to 2005, when security training was led by <em><strong>Gen. David H. Petraeus</strong></em>, who now commands all U.S. forces in Iraq.</p></blockquote>
<p>(Bolding and italicizing mine.)</p>
<blockquote><p>Iraqi security forces were virtually nonexistent in early 2004, and in June of that year Petraeus was brought in to build them up. No central record of distributed equipment was kept for a year and a half, until December 2005, and even now the records are on a spreadsheet that requires three computer screens lined up side by side to view a single row, Christoff said.</p></blockquote>
<p>I noted a while back there were reasons to question whether Petraeus really is the best the US military has to offer&#8230; after all, he was in charge of training Iraqi security forces, and it seems perhaps the biggest problem in Iraq is the non-performance of Iraqi security forces. (On the plus side, those of them that are double dipping so to speak don&#8217;t perform that well when they take off their uniforms and take potshots at US soldiers either.) </p>
<p>But the Washington Post raises another issue. As Omar Bradley noted, &#8220;The amateur talks about strategy. The professional talks about logistics.&#8221;</p>
<p>And then there&#8217;s this very, very scary paragraph&#8230;.</p>
<blockquote><p>The GAO is studying the financing and weapons sources of insurgent groups, but that report will not be made public. &#8220;All of that information is classified,&#8221; said Joseph A. Christoff, the GAO&#8217;s director of international affairs and trade.</p></blockquote>
<p>Why would something like this be classified &#8211; don&#8217;t the insurgents know where their weapons are coming from? My belief &#8211; the Saudis are financing the insurgency.</p>

                                <p>From an article in the <a href="http://bostonreview.net/BR32.4/loury.html">Boston Review</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>According to a 2005 report of the International Centre for Prison Studies in London, the United States—with five percent of the world’s population—houses 25 percent of the world’s inmates. Our incarceration rate (714 per 100,000 residents) is almost 40 percent greater than those of our nearest competitors (the Bahamas, Belarus, and Russia). Other industrial democracies, even those with significant crime problems of their own, are much less punitive: our incarceration rate is 6.2 times that of Canada, 7.8 times that of France, and 12.3 times that of Japan. We have a corrections sector that employs more Americans than the combined work forces of General Motors, Ford, and Wal-Mart, the three largest corporate employers in the country, and we are spending some $200 billion annually on law enforcement and corrections at all levels of government, a fourfold increase (in constant dollars) over the past quarter century. </p>
<p>Never before has a supposedly free country denied basic liberty to so many of its citizens. In December 2006, some 2.25 million persons were being held in the nearly 5,000 prisons and jails that are scattered across America’s urban and rural landscapes. One third of inmates in state prisons are violent criminals, convicted of homicide, rape, or robbery. But the other two thirds consist mainly of property and drug offenders. Inmates are disproportionately drawn from the most disadvantaged parts of society. On average, state inmates have fewer than 11 years of schooling. They are also vastly disproportionately black and brown.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>An interesting case in point is New York City. Analyzing arrests by residential neighborhood and police precinct, the criminologist Jeffrey Fagan and his colleagues Valerie West and Jan Holland found that incarceration was highest in the city’s poorest neighborhoods, though these were often not the neighborhoods in which crime rates were the highest. Moreover, they discovered a perverse effect of incarceration on crime: higher incarceration in a given neighborhood in one year seemed to predict higher crime rates in that same neighborhood one year later. This growth and persistence of incarceration over time, the authors concluded, was due primarily to the drug enforcement practices of police and to sentencing laws that require imprisonment for repeat felons. Police scrutiny was more intensive and less forgiving in high-incarceration neighborhoods, and parolees returning to such neighborhoods were more closely monitored. Thus, discretionary and spatially discriminatory police behavior led to a high and increasing rate of repeat prison admissions in the designated neighborhoods, even as crime rates fell. </p>
<p>Fagan, West, and Holland explain the effects of spatially concentrated urban anti-drug-law enforcement in the contemporary American metropolis. Buyers may come from any neighborhood and any social stratum. But the sellers—at least the ones who can be readily found hawking their wares on street corners and in public vestibules—come predominantly from the poorest, most non-white parts of the city. The police, with arrest quotas to meet, know precisely where to find them. The researchers conclude: </p>
<blockquote><p>Incarceration begets more incarceration, and incarceration also begets more crime, which in turn invites more aggressive enforcement, which then re-supplies incarceration . . . three mechanisms . . . contribute to and reinforce incarceration in neighborhoods: the declining economic fortunes of former inmates and the effects on neighborhoods where they tend to reside, resource and relationship strains on families of prisoners that weaken the family’s ability to supervise children, and voter disenfranchisement that weakens the political economy of neighborhoods.</p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Its an interesting article.  If you have the interest and the time, its worth a read.</p>

                                <p>This post is one I should have written a long time ago… it looks at revenues, outlays, and deficits (or surpluses) over time since the early 1930s, breaking things out by Presidential administration. All data for this comes from White House <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2008/sheets/hist01z3.xls">Office of Management and Budget Table 1.3</a>.</p>
<p>I note… I have already looked at taxes, kinda… I had a post looking at <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/06/comparing-presidents-tax-cutting.html">non-SS taxes less increase in tax obligation</a> by President, the idea being that SS has a separate revenue stream, and that increases in the national debt must eventually be paid and hence represent “deferred taxes.” In this post, I’m going for the classical definition of federal revenues… including everything, and ignoring the future debt obligations.</p>
<p>So, without further ado, here are three graphs: federal receipts as a percentage of GDP, federal outlays as a percentage of GDP, and surplus or deficit as a percentage of GDP.</p>

<p>Note… the summary table for the surplus does not show the annualized change. Given in some administrations, the surplus becomes a deficit, and in others, the opposite is true (i.e., figure go from positive to negative or vice versa), the concept of an annualized change doesn’t work mathematically. As a result, the summary table for the surplus shows the percentage change over the entire period divided by the number of years.</p>
<p>So what do we learn?</p>
<p>1. Revenues always drop when Reps are in office, and under every single Republican administration, revenues dropped by more than they did under JFK/LBJ, the only Dem administration under which revenues dropped. Even Reps that didn’t “cut taxes” see drops in revenues as a percent of GDP. (GHW is the classic example.) What gives? Well, as I noted before, there are many ways to cut taxes, and announcing a tax cut is only one of many. One can simply cut enforcement at the IRS and achieve the same results. <br />2. Actual declared tax cuts by Reps are easy to spot. After an actual declared tax cut, tax revenues fall off a cliff in Republican administrations.. spotting the tax cuts under Reagan and GW is child’s play. One interesting thing… the entire drop in revenue is not permanent after such tax cuts… there was a bit of increased growth in the economy, eventually. Not enough to result in growth rates like those of <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/06/comparing-presidents-real-gdp-per.html">JFK/LBJ or Clinton</a>, but growth rate nevertheless.<br />3. People often attribute all that is good in the Clinton admin to the Republican Revolution. Well, let’s see… Reps took over Congress in 1995… what changed? The pattern of tax revenues? Um, no. The spending pattern? Not that either. The combination of the two? Well, that didn’t change either. And what changed from 2000 to 2001, when the Republicans still ran Congress, but Clinton left office? Hmmm… well, tax receipts, spending, and the direction of the surplus all changed. So to conclude that the Rep Congress was responsible for what happened in the Clinton admin, one has to conclude that it started having an effect from 1992 to 1993, and ceased having an effect from 2000 to 2001 and was unrelated to the fact that them&#8217;s the years that by random coinkidink bracket the Clinton administration. Not that pointing this out would make a whit of difference to those who know the truth because they don&#8217;t believe in data anyway. I believe the correct response, to one who knows the truth, is: &#8220;Woohoo, Reagan rocks!!!!!&#8221; or some such thing.<br />4. Does Congress have an effect elsewhere? I am no historian, but I believe the following table is accurate when it comes to showing the dates when each party held control of the Senate and the House since 1953.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RrfIekPDH-I/AAAAAAAAAig/oqRmwu8d-RU/s1600-h/surplus+deficit+table+4.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RrfIekPDH-I/AAAAAAAAAig/oqRmwu8d-RU/s320/surplus+deficit+table+4.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>In 1955, Dems took control of Congress. There does seem to be a big change in revenues – I’m not sure I can explain it. What about 1981 – well, its hard to attribute changes that year to Congress given the new President, Reagan. But in 1987, we do spot… a big rise in revenues, and a big drop in spending, resulting in a big drop in the deficit. We’ve been over 1995 already. <br />5. What about spending? Well, it really doesn’t seem like most Presidents were tight with the money. Clinton cut spending substantially, Ike by half as much, and Reagan by a quarter of Ike’s rate. But otherwise, the pattern has been to spend and spend and spend. No doubt its Bush Derangement Syndrome to point this out, but GW is currently in 7th, just ahead of JFK/LBJ.<br />6. Putting it all together… the most fiscally responsible President, by far, was Clinton – he improved the country’s books by 7X what Carter did, who in turn did twice as well as Ike. The rest of the Presidents made the debt situation worse, not better.  And bringing up the rear are the Bush boys, with GW being off some distance from the rest. Of course, it’s not really a problem… its merely a sign of my acute and no doubt terminal Bush Derangement Syndrome that I would notice something like this because as we all know, Bush is the bestest President ever.</p>

<p>Update&#8230;  I just noticed, there&#8217;s a small mistake in the last graph&#8230;  From 2001 to 2003, control of the Senate changed hands a few times, and was deadlocked for a while.  That should be characterized as mixed control.  Apologies.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.tradeobservatory.org/headlines.cfm?refid=99340">The Trade Observer reports</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p>A retired Swiss Army colonel is petitioning the defence ministry to keep the famous pocket knife issued to the Alpine nation&#8217;s soldiers following reports that the next batch of 65,000 could be made in China. </p>
<p>Alois Kessler, a lawyer who served as a reserve officer until 2004, began his campaign after hearing that World Trade Organization rules may mean the government has to consider bids from anywhere in the world. </p>
<p>&#8220;A Swiss Army knife with a Swiss cross on it, and &#8216;Made in China&#8217; on the back, won&#8217;t be accepted at all well,&#8221; Kessler said Thursday. </p>
<p>&#8220;I have real doubts that China would manage the same standards of quality&#8221; as the Swiss product, he said. </p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Kessler said he is trying to convince the Army that the knife would qualify for an exemption to the WTO rule banning discrimination against foreign bidders. Alternatively, he argued the government is free to set quality and environmental criteria that non-Swiss bidders are unlikely to meet.</p>
<p>Kessler is also trying to appeal through the intellectual property rights that the use of the name Swiss Army Knife carries special meaning, and that any knife from China should be called something like the China Army Knife.  Like gambling law in the US, sometimes these commonly shared products catch our notice and tug at the heart as well.</p></blockquote>
<p>What is this world coming to when McGiver would have to whip out his China Army Knife to save the day!!!  (The kids need to ask someone if they do not know who  McGiver was.)  </p>

<p>The Pentagon did not dispute the figures, but said it was reviewing arms deliveries procedures</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>The GAO reached the estimate &#8211; 111,000 missing AK-47s and 80,000 missing pistols &#8211; by comparing the property records of the Multi-National Security Transition Command for Iraq against records maintained by Gen Petraeus of the arms and equipment he ordered. </p>
<p>Deputy Assistant Defence Secretary Mark Kimmitt told AFP the Pentagon was &#8220;reviewing policies and procedures to ensure US-funded equipment reaches the intended Iraqi security forces under the Iraq program&#8221;. </p></blockquote>
<p> <strong>&#8230;</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Meanwhile, at the end of July, the US Defence Department admitted that the US-led coalition in Iraq had failed to deliver nearly two-thirds of the equipment it promised to Iraq&#8217;s army. </p>
<p>The Pentagon said only 14.5m of the nearly 40m items of equipment ordered by the Iraqi army had been provided. </p></blockquote>
<p>Ah for the good old days, when former interns at the Heritage Foundation ran around the country disbursing cash and the only thing disappearing in Iraq were sackfuls of money.  Whatever else is going on here, some people are getting very wealthy.</p>

                                <p>This post is on spending on civilian physical infrastructure and how its changed by Presidential administration since the early 1950s. Kind of a follow-up to <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/08/mclaughlin-group-on-whether-we-invest.html">PGL&#8217;s post from earlier today</a>, but using data from the White House <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2008/sheets/hist09z3.xls">Office of Management and Budget Table 9.3</a>: Given the recent bridge collapse, and the disaster that was New Orleans in the wake of Katrina, I think it makes sense to focus on non-defense related expenditures. The table divides spending into categories: direct federal spending and grants, the latter presumably being to state and local government. Direct federal spending, in turn, is broken out by “defense” and “non-defense.” I assume the vast majority of spending via grants is for non-defense purposes. So I’m going to assume that spending on non-defense Physical capital investment is made up of direct federal spending for non-defense purposes, and spending via grants.</p>
<p>So, without further ado, here are three graphs: federal receipts as a percentage of GDP, federal outlays as a percentage of GDP, and surplus or deficit as a percentage of GDP.</p>

<p>Here are summary tables.</p>

<p>What we get from this… spending on infrastructure was pretty piddly when Ike took over. But Ike was impressed by the German autobahn system, and went on to start construction of the freeway system we have today. (Being a notorious commie, Ike was usurping the role of the private sector, who no doubt would have built the freeway system cheaper, better, and faster.) As a percentage of GDP, spending on non-defense infrastructure stayed more or less constant until the Reagan era, when it dropped, and its been more or less constant ever since. (My guess is that its not as constant as the graphs make it look… that’s probably more a function of the lack of granularity of the data in the table.) Clinton did increase spending on infrastructure as a percent of the budget even while <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2008/sheets/hist01z3.xls">shrinking the budget as a percent of GDP</a>. GW has done the opposite.</p>
<p>Spending is a matter of priorities. And infrastructure has not been a priority for decades. Which is a pity, because spending on infrastructure is a matter of investing in the future. You can make the finances look very good in the short term by ignoring long term problems (i.e., cutting spending on infrastructure) a la Reagan, but it has long term consequences. The only two administrations to do any appreciable cutting of spending as a percentage of GDP, Ike and Clinton, understood that – hence, they also were the administrations that increased spending the most on non-defense physical infrastructure as a percent of the amount they did spend. </p>
<p>I note also that precedent matters. Ike set a precedent, and it was followed for a while. Reagan set another (lower) precedent, and that&#8217;s been more or less followed ever since. Should we be surprised that bridges collapse given the precedent that is being followed? I don&#8217;t think so. I think our luck may just now start be running out and we have one more price to pay for Reaganomics coming due, and this one may cause more damage than the price we&#8217;re paying (and paid so far) for his runup of the debt.</p>
<p>Next post in the series&#8230; It occurs to me I’ve been remiss and left out an obvious post for this series on Presidents, and I&#8217;ll be correcting that oversight.</p>

                                <p>I’m watching the Republican <a href="http://politicalinsider.com/2007/06/all_candidates_agree_to_iowa_d.html">Iowa Debates</a> and as usual, the only person on the stage that isn’t pandering to the rightwing with serial dishonesty is Ron Paul.  </p>
<p>Rudy Giuliani was asked how he would raise funds to rebuild our aging infrastructure such as our bridges.  His answer was cut tax rates.  He kept repeating that is a “liberal Democratic assumption” that raising tax rates will lead to more revenues. It would seem that <a href="http://voxbaby.blogspot.com/2007/03/more-laffer-curve-laughers.html">Andrew Samwick</a> rejects this Laffer curve nonsense.  <a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2007/03/mccain-on-laffer-curve.html">Greg Mankiw</a> generally rejects this nonsense, but his candidate echoed Giuliani’s nonsense.  I wonder if these two clowns think all economists are liberal Democrats?  </p>
<p>OK, you might argue that Lawrence Kudlow and Donald Luskin believe in the Laffer curve but if Rudy Giuliani thinks that these two clowns are economists, he is not qualified to be President.  Then again – most of the folks on this panel are saying the Fair Tax is a great policy proposal.  Oh wait – Brownback just touted his optional flat tax.  What a bunch of IDIOTS.</p>
