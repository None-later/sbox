                                <p>Media reports are that four years of job growth ends. One quote, readily accesible via goggle, is “One number is not a trend, but this will scare the Fed.&#8221; Come on folks, the decline has been going on for more than two years. I guess it depends on your frame of reference. Here&#8217;s a quick chart update.</p>

                                <p>A question&#8230; if figures for violence in Iraq <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/09/this-has-appeared-in-various-places-but.html">don&#8217;t include car bombings</a>, would they include situations in which 19 people hijacked four passenger planes and flew them into buildings? The reason I ask&#8230;</p>
<p>1. If 9/11 was so important that it <em>changed everything</em> (as many people put it) in the US, should violence statistics for Iraq be constructed in such a way as to ignore 9/11 type events?<br />2. If on the other hand, such an event was counted in the violence figures for Iraq, how can car bombings not be counted?</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Real GDP in 2007QII was only 1.9 percent higher than it was as of 2006QII.  So what does this mean to the labor market?  The latest from <a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm">BLS</a> has come out: </p>
<blockquote><p>Nonfarm payroll employment was essentially unchanged (-4,000) in August, and the unemployment rate remained at 4.6 percent, the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the U.S. Department of Labor reported today.  Over the last 3 months, total payroll employment changes have averaged 44,000 per month and private sector employment changes have averaged 72,000 per month (as revised).  In August, employment in manufacturing, construction, and local government education declined, while job growth continued in health care and food services.</p></blockquote>
<p>Translation – this drop in employment continues this recent trend in weak employment growth.  But that’s the payroll survey and isn’t the fact that the unemployment rate remains at 4.6% great?  Well, the BLS explains why this standard rightwing canard is full of it:</p>
<blockquote><p>In August, the civilian labor force edged down to 152.9 million, and the labor force participation rate decreased to 65.8 percent.  The declines were largely due to a drop in labor force participation among teenagers; their participation rate fell to 39.7 percent.  Total employment (145.8 million) and the employment-population ratio (62.8 percent) were little changed over the month.</p></blockquote>
<p>We have noted before that the employment to population ratio, which was 63.4% as of December 2006, has declined over the course of this year dropping to 63% as of July 2007.  Now we see that this ratio has dropped to 62.8%. It would seem that the steady unemployment rate is due to the fact that the labor force participation rate has declined as well – from 66.4% as of December to 65.8% as of August.  </p>
<p>So is there is silver lining?  Maybe this will encourage the FED to lower interest rates.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: CNN just had Ali Velshi on to explain to us what the employment report really means.  He starts off saying he was surprised that employment actually fell.  And then he touted the unemployment rate as being evidence that the labor market is really not that bad.  Can this man be more stupid?  So what are his qualifications to report on economic news?  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Velshi">This source</a> claims:</p>
<blockquote><p>Ali Velshi earned a degree in religion from Queen’s University</p></blockquote>
<p>And CNN thinks Velshi is their best person to report on economics?  Figures from the organization that puts Sanjay Gupta up as an expert on health economics.</p>

                                <p>This has appeared in various places, but I&#8217;m on the run this morning and I really wanted to post on this, so I&#8217;ll simply credit <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2007_09/012012.php">Kevin Drum</a> who himself links to <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/05/AR2007090502466_pf.html">this article in the Washington Post</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Intelligence analysts computing aggregate levels of violence against civilians for the NIE puzzled over how the military designated attacks as combat, sectarian or criminal, according to one senior intelligence official in Washington. &#8220;If a bullet went through the back of the head, it&#8217;s sectarian,&#8221; the official said. &#8220;If it went through the front, it&#8217;s criminal.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Kevin Drum also cites <a href="http://www.democracyarsenal.org/2007/09/getting-shot-in.html">Ilan Goldenberg</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;So to recap. The violence numbers do not include: 1) Sunni on Sunni violence. 2) Shi&#8217;a on Shi&#8217;a violence 3) Car bombs 4) Getting shot in the front of the head.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>If these reports are accurate, this is cherry-picking and parsing of so high a quality I am convinced the military must have hired <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/01/in-my-opinion-thomas-sowell-is-hack.html">Thomas Sowell</a>.</p>

<p>And <a href="http://atrios.blogspot.com/2007_09_02_archive.html#8987929196442306997">Atrios</a> links to a <a href="http://www.mcclatchydc.com/homepage/story/19493.html">McClatchey</a> article on US casualties.  Worth a read if you want to understand how the number parsing seems to change&#8230;</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Reader <a href="http://home.comcast.net/~markhessel1/">Mark Hessel</a> sends a few questions and some answers&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p><strong>What exactly is the rate of inflation?</strong> <br />I realize that prices are always going up, but shouldn&#8217;t inflation be based on some type of average or median income. In other words, shouldn&#8217;t the rate of inflation be based on what I can buy for an hour of my work? </p>
<p>The 7th amendment in the US constitution deals with civil law suits. </p>
<blockquote><p>In Suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no fact tried by a jury, shall be otherwise re-examined in any Court of the United States, than according to the rules of the common law.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>What is $20 dollars worth today as compared to 1800 &#8211; quickly checking, it&#8217;s about $327. [1] How long did an average US worker take to make $20 in 1800 and how long does it take today to make $327? </p>
<p>I would assume that it took longer in 1800 to make $20 than it takes someone today to make $327 dollars. So in real terms, inflation has gone down since 1800. </p>
<p><strong>Does GDP include money made off the stock market and what does that mean in terms of real growth or productivity increases? </strong><br />I believe that it should be included in any GDP statement. Money earned. Money taxed.</p>
<p>But, what exactly does money made off the stock market mean? Did it really increase productivity? How does that affect inflation or what my real hourly wages are? </p>
<p>It seems to me that it would create real inflation in terms of wages, my hour of work would buy less because there would be more money with nothing real in terms of output except more money. </p>
<p><strong>Shouldn&#8217;t any formula that predicts real growth be dependant on population size and productivity? </strong></p>
<p>I know this sounds a bit Marxists, but isn&#8217;t real growth in the world now totally dependent on population size and productivity? </p>
<p>It&#8217;s been almost 80 years since a real world depression. The world has integrated into an economic whole. Forgoing a catastrophic world disaster, i.e. global warming, an asteroid, another world war, etc., the world will economically chug along it&#8217;s merry way with it&#8217;s chaotic ups and downs. </p>
<p>I still think we can screw things up. I think global warming and population growth are huge, but even smaller things may cause unforeseen outcomes. </p>
<p>For instance, I recently heard that China is running into a labor market shortage because of their one child per couple mandate. How is China going to handle that?</p>
<p>What are the consequences of consistently under rating the real inflation rate? (Which is apparently what the FED has been doing since I don&#8217;t know when. Wouldn&#8217;t this would cause the FED to lose money in the long run. Shouldn&#8217;t the FED be<br />pegging the rate as closely as possible to just above the real inflation rate?)</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a bit scared by the current Administration and how economic information is being release to the public. If they were incompetent enough to cherry pick information to go to war with Iraq, if they were deceptive enough to use the Justice Department and apparently most of the other Executive departments for political purposes, why wouldn&#8217;t they try to jigger the economic reports</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p>cactus here&#8230; this post was by Mark Hessel. I&#8217;d try to take a stab at these questions, but I got up way too late. So I&#8217;m throwing it open to the readers. Have at it.</p>

                                <p>Someone tell <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2007/09/is-rudy-out-of-.html">Mark Thoma</a> that he is having too much fun and that we all know <a href="http://www.joinrudy2008.com/issues">RUDY</a> is an idiot.  But <a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2007/09/how-big-is-supp.html">Tyler Cowen</a> is very smart:</p>
<blockquote><p>Might Reagan&#8217;s huge tax increase have had something to do with that?</p></blockquote>
<p>Tyler is reminding the doofs that wrote <a href="http://www.conservapedia.com/Laffer_curve">this</a> that the “near doubling of federal tax reciepts ($500 billion to $900 billion” was in part due to the increase in payroll taxes and in part due to rising prices.  Incidentally, the doofs can’t even spell receipts.  But this gets much worse when one turns to their <a href="http://www.cato.org/pubs/pas/pa-261.html">source</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Nominal federal revenues doubled in the 1980s from $517 billion to $1.031 trillion.</p></blockquote>
<p>The doofs were off by over $100 billion as to the level of total Federal revenues at the end of this period.  Can’t spell, can’t read.  But let’s not let William A. Niskanen and Stephen Moore off the hook either:</p>
<blockquote><p>Real economic growth averaged 3.2 percent during the Reagan years versus 2.8 percent during the Ford-Carter years and 2.1 percent during the Bush-Clinton years.</p></blockquote>
<p>Mind you that they wrote this in late 1996 and they likely did not see the Clinton boom taking off.  After all – that 1993 tax increase was supposed to lead to economic ruin according to this crowd.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>While I realize that <a href="http://meganmcardle.theatlantic.com/archives/2007/09/inside_media_baseball_wednesda.php">this review</a> of John Chait’s take down <a href="http://www.tnr.com/doc.mhtml?i=20070910&#038;s=chait091007&#038;c=3">Crakcpot Economics</a> will drive those of on the left crazy, I really like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Chait tars all tax-cutters with the ideas of the looniest supply siders. One can believe that tax cuts, by reducing deadweight loss and/or providing fiscal stimulus, will be good for the economy, without necessarily believing that the economy will be crippled by a 5% rate increase. His primary exhibits for the nefarious influence of supply-side policy are: Larry Lindsay, Dick Cheney, Jack Kemp, Jude Wanniski, and George Gilder. Cheney I give you, but Larry Lindsay was drummed out of the administration in disgrace (for unrelated reasons) even before Bush&#8217;s major tax cut, and Chait somehow neglects to mention the more conventional economists who have occupied the job since. Jack Kemp hasn&#8217;t had access to serious power since I was snoring my way through Algebra I, and what power he did have was over HUD. Moreover, though I agree that Jude Wanniski and George Gilder are barking moonbats, they have, to put it kindly, limited influence on today&#8217;s Republican party; which is hardly surprising given that Wanniski was kicked out of the party in disgrace before he died in 2005, and George Gilder has turned his attentions to that hugely influention Republican mouthpiece, the Gilder Technology report. This motley collection of names is hardly proof that the Supply Siders Have Taken Over the Building.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sweet!  But wait a second – George Bush once dubbed Lawrence Lindsey the smartest economist he ever met (what an insult to Glenn Hubbard and Greg Mankiw).  I could go on but <a href="http://matthewyglesias.theatlantic.com/archives/2007/09/the_relevance_of_supplysiders.php">Matthew Yglesias</a> has done the hard work for me.  So let me just focus on this:</p>
<blockquote><p>And, of course, in addition to this insignificant crew of presidents and congressional leaders, there&#8217;s  people like Rudy Guiliani and John McCain As Greg Mankiw put it &#8220;fealty to the most extreme supply-side views is de rigeur in some segments of the Republican party.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>While it is true that Greg Mankiw has called out Guiliani and McCain on their free lunch BS, Mitt Romney is spreading the same BS.  Didn’t Greg say he was one of Romney’s economic advisors?</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: In his discussion, <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2007/09/out-of-the-main.html">Mark Thoma</a> points to another version of an oft heard <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/article/20070906/COMMENTARY/109060023/1012">silly claim</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p>Even Democrats can&#8217;t reasonably deny we&#8217;ve experienced sustained economic growth following the Bush tax cuts. Instead, they&#8217;ve resurrected the canard they used to discredit the phenomenal growth of the supply-side Reagan years … Contrary to liberal propaganda, the Reagan tax cuts led to dramatic increases in federal revenues even after adjusting for inflation. Increases in the deficit were due to the spending side, some of the blame for which admittedly should be shared by Republicans.</p></blockquote>
<p>Is David Limbaugh really this stupid or does he just assume his readers won’t fact check his mendacity.  Yes, we have had an anemic recovery from the 2001 recession but the average annual growth rate since George Bush has taken office has been only 2.4 percent.  The average annual growth rate from 1980 to 1992 was only 3 percent – as compared to growth rates near 3.5 percent for the 1950’s, 1960, 1970’s, and the Clinton years. </p>
<p>But at least David knows how to adjust for inflation – unlike that WSJ op-ed piece by Art Laffer and Jack Kemp just before the 2000 election.  As Laffer and Kemp advocated free lunch supply-sider George W. Bush should get our vote, they flat out lied to us by a host of confusions – including the nominal v. real canard – as they tried to claim the 1981 tax cut doubled revenues.  But let’s take a closer look at Federal revenues in 1992 versus 1980 (two periods at similar points in the business cycle) by separating payroll taxes from current receipts (the latter being income and profit taxes).  Payroll taxes were $162.6 billion in 1980 and were $441.8 billion in 1992.  This 172% nominal increase represented a 70% real increase and the price-level rose by about 60% over the 12-year period.  Current receipts rose from $335.9 billion in 1980 to $660.4 billion in 1992 or by about 86% in nominal terms.  But in real terms, we are talking about an increase of only 16% over a 12-year period. Considering the fact that the US population rose by 13% over this same period – real per capita Federal current receipts grew by less than 3% over a 12-year period.  Not exactly a dramatic increase after all – is it?  </p>
<p>Incidentally, none of this reality should be new to anyone.  Either David Limbaugh is an incredibly clueless person or he is a very dishonest person.  But hey – the GOP label should be Moonbats R Us!</p>

<blockquote><p>Iraq&#8217;s army, despite measurable progress, will be unable to take over internal security from U.S. forces in the next 12 to 18 months and &#8220;cannot yet meaningfully contribute to denying terrorists safe haven,&#8221; according to a report on the Iraqi security forces published today.</p>
<p>The report, prepared by a commission of retired senior U.S. military officers, describes the 25,000-member Iraqi national police force and the Interior Ministry, which controls it, as riddled with sectarianism and corruption. The ministry, it says, is &#8220;dysfunctional&#8221; and is &#8220;a ministry in name only.&#8221; The commission recommended that the national police force be disbanded.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong><br />
<blockquote>The assessment by the Independent Commission on the Security Forces of Iraq is one of several independent progress reports ordered by Congress for delivery before the administration presents its own scorecard next week. Members of the 20-member group, headed by retired Marine Gen. James Jones, traveled throughout Iraq over the summer and met with hundreds of U.S. and Iraqi officials as well as leading nongovernmental experts on the Iraqi forces. Jones will present the 152-page document, a copy of which was obtained by The Washington Post, in testimony today before the Senate and House Armed Services committees.</p>
<p>As he ended a year in charge of training the Iraqi security forces in 2005, then-Lt. Gen. David H. Petraeus said that Iraq&#8217;s military had made &#8220;enormous progress&#8221; and that its readiness to take over from U.S. forces was growing &#8220;with each passing week.&#8221; President Bush said of the Iraqi forces, &#8220;As they stand up, we&#8217;ll stand down.&#8221;</p>
<p>The report expresses concern about what it calls the massive U.S. military logistical &#8220;footprint&#8221; in Iraq and its effect on perceptions and problems. &#8220;The unintended message conveyed is one of &#8216;permanence,&#8217; an occupying force, as it were,&#8221; the report says. It recommends reconsideration of &#8220;efficiency, necessity . . . and cost&#8221; and calls for &#8220;significant reductions, consolidations and realignments&#8221; of U.S. forces.</p>
<p>All of Iraq&#8217;s 18 provinces should be transferred to government control, the report says &#8212; only seven currently have that status &#8212; and a formal status-of-forces agreement should be pursued with the Iraqi government. &#8220;We believe that all [U.S.] bases in Iraq should demonstrate evidence of Iraqi sovereignty,&#8221; including flying the Iraqi flag, the report says. &#8220;There is a fine line,&#8221; it says, &#8220;between assistance and dependence.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

                                <p>From a column in <a href="http://www.straightdope.com/columns/070831.html">the Straight Dope</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the late 90s Swiss scientists found cholesterol drugs in their groundwater; when they started checking lakes and streams, they found the stuff almost everywhere. The United States Geological Survey measured levels of pharmaceuticals, hormones, and other pollutants in 139 streams across the U.S. in 1999 and 2000 — 80 percent of the time they found at least one of the 95 chemicals they were screening for. The medical compounds seen most regularly were steroids and nonprescription drugs, though sex hormones such as estrogen and testosterone turned up too; in a subsequent USGS study, hormones and steroids were detected in more than 40 percent of groundwater samples. German scientists have found antibiotics, beta blockers, and even antiepilepsy medicine in their water; in Canada researchers have found cancer drugs and anti-inflammatories; in the UK they’ve found everything from ibuprofen to antibiotics in streams and sewage alike.</p>
<p>The good news is that we&#8217;re talking about some very, very small quantities of drugs here — the levels found so far have typically been measured in parts per billion or even trillion. And after three decades of study, no one&#8217;s yet produced any evidence that drug residue puts humans at risk.  The less-good news runs a little longer. First, there may be long-term cumulative effects we haven’t identified yet, especially considering how persistent some residues are — clofibric acid, one by-product of a cholesterol drug, can hang around for two-plus decades. Second, the extremely low concentrations of residue in water make it hard to distinguish any such effects from ones caused by the zillion other chemicals we’re constantly exposed to. Then there’s the ongoing boom in prescription drug use: a 2004 report points out that while the U.S. population grew 13 percent between 1993 and 2003, the amount of prescription drugs we bought went up 70 percent over the same period.</p>
<p>Another possible concern is that we don’t know how all these drugs may interact. Some studies have found that combining different sex hormones in doses so tiny as to be theoretically insignificant can have a measurable (if small) effect. According to one USGS fish pathologist, something like this may be going on with pollutants in tributaries of the Potomac River, where in testing last year more than 80 percent of male largemouth and smallmouth bass were found to be producing eggs, which isn’t normally part of their repertoire.  Residue can also accumulate in the tissue of fish and other wildlife and get back to us via the food chain. Meanwhile, there’s always the potential problem of unmetabolized antibiotics entering the environment and helping breed a new generation of super-resistant bacteria.</p></blockquote>
<p>Last week I had my yearly check-up.  The doctor asked me if I&#8217;m any medication.  Apparently when I told him &#8220;no&#8221;, I was wrong.  And I can&#8217;t help thinking, this might be one heck of a negative externality.</p>

                                <p>Reader CoRev sends me this e-mail..</p>
<p>From <a href="http://www.captainsquartersblog.com/mt/">the Captains Quarters</a>:  Chuck Schumer a democratic leader made this statement: <br />
<blockquote>And let me be clear, the violence in Anbar has gone down despite the surge, not because of the surge. The inability of American  soldiers to protect these tribes from al Qaeda said to these tribes we  have to fight al Qaeda ourselves. It wasn&#8217;t that the surge brought peace  here. It was that the warlords took peace here, created a temporary  peace here. And that is because there was no one else there protecting.</p></blockquote>
<p>If this is your belief, then there is no hope.  Your party will lose the next election with these beliefs. </p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not exactly a partisan Democrat.  As I&#8217;ve stated many times, I consider the Dems to be less obnoxious than the Reps on the economy.  It does seem to me they&#8217;re a heck of a lot less obnoxious, though, when it comes to the war.</p>
<p>But for grins, I went to google to see about what CoRev wrote.  And in 5 seconds, I found <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0206/p01s01-woiq.html">an article</a> in the Christian Science Monitor entitled &#8220;Sunni Tribes Turn Against Jihadis&#8221;:</p>
<blockquote><p>He&#8217;s also turned away from supporting Abu Mussab al-Zarqawi and other foreign fighters in Iraq. &#8220;We realized that these foreign terrorists were hiding behind the veil of the noble Iraqi resistance,&#8221; says Mr. Jadaan. &#8220;They claim to be striking at the US occupation, but the reality is they are killing innocent Iraqis in the markets, in mosques, in churches, and in our schools.&#8221; </p>
<p>In Anbar Province, an insurgent hotbed that borders Syria, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia, US and Iraqi officials say they have a new ally against the Al Qaeda-inspired terrorists: local tribal leaders like Jadaan and home-grown Iraqi insurgents. </p>
<p>&#8220;The local insurgents have become part of the solution and not part of the problem,&#8221; US Army Maj. Gen. Rick Lynch told reporters at a press conference last week.</p>
<p>Until recently, many of the Sunni Arab tribes in Anbar and local insurgent leaders collaborated with Islamic extremist groups whose funding and manpower is thought to come largely from abroad. They had a common goal: drive out the Americans.</p>
<p>But Mr. Zarqawi&#8217;s indiscriminate killing of innocent Iraqis has alienated many of his erstwhile Iraqi allies. His shadowy militant group, known as Al Qaeda in Iraq, is believed to have assassinated four prominent Anbar sheikhs. And in January when hundreds of Anbar men turned up at an Iraqi Army recruiting depot in Ramadi, the provincial capital, a suicide bomber killed 70 would-be soldiers.</p>
<p>Zarqawi&#8217;s brutal methods have stirred controversy beyond Iraq, as well. When he declared an &#8220;all out war&#8221; on Shiites last September, his former mentor, Abu Mohammed al-Maqdisi, publicly rebuked him and Al Qaeda&#8217;s No. 2, Ayman al-Zawahiri, warned him against alienating the Muslim masses.</p>
<p>But Zarqawi appears to have done just that. Last month, a poll of 1,150 Iraqis throughout the country, conducted by the Program on International Policy Attitudes, the website World Public Opinion, and the Center for International and Security Studies at the University of Maryland, revealed that just 7 percent of Iraqis approve of attacks on Iraqi government security forces.The same poll, which over sampled Sunni Arabs, found that only 1 percent of Iraqis support attacks on Iraqi civilians.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>We are caught in the middle between the terrorists coming to destroy us with their suicide belts, their TNT, and their car bombs, and the American Army that destroys our homes, takes our weapons, and doesn&#8217;t allow us to defend ourselves against the terrorists,&#8221; says Jadaan.</p>
<p>It was that frustration that first pushed Anbar&#8217;s elders to take a stand against outside terror groups, which set up camp there and turned Anbar&#8217;s highways into rat lines for foreign fighters coming in from Syria, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>US and Iraqi forces launched a series of offensives throughout the province last year. Caught in the crossfire, Anbar&#8217;s residents began looking for a way out.</p>
<p>&#8220;A sheikh from the Samarra tribe, which had suffered a lot from the military operations, came to see the minister of defense, and he said, &#8216;Give me two weeks to get rid of the foreigners from our city,&#8217; &#8221; recalls Mohammed al-Askaree, an adviser to Iraq&#8217;s Sunni Arab Defense Minister Saadoun Dulaymi. &#8220;The minister said, &#8216;Take a month. If you get rid of the foreigners and the terrorists your city will avoid further problems.&#8217; &#8220;</p>
<p>Other tribal sheikhs followed suit. About three months ago, Mr. Dulaymi, intent on exploiting the rift between the tribes and the foreign insurgents, convened a series of meetings with Anbar&#8217;s tribal sheikhs, religious leaders, and local elders. The US ambassador to Iraq, Zalmay Khalilzad, attended some of the meetings.</p>
<p>The provincial leaders made a number of demands in return for their cooperation, Mr. Askaree says. They asked for weapons to fight the terrorists with, but the minister refused. Instead the minister agreed to step up recruitment of Anbar residents to the Iraqi security forces.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you want to participate in attacking the terrorists, you have no choice but to send your sons to volunteer for the Army and give the Army information on the terrorists,&#8221; Askaree says the minister of defense told the gathered Anbar notables.</p></blockquote>
<p>So what Schumer said about the involvement of the US&#8230; seems to be correct.  Oh, and this article backs up one other thing Schumer said&#8230; about the timing, and how this is not related to the surge.  See, the article is dated February 06, 2006.</p>
