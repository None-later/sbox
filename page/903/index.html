                                <p>Reader OldVet sends a link to <a href="http://www.financialsense.com/editorials/cooke/2007/0202.html">an article on Ethanol prices</a>.  This is way outside my area of expertise, and I can&#8217;t vouch for the figures.  That said, I&#8217;ve always thought corn ethanol was a bad hoax perpetrated on the American public.  Ethanol from other sources, of course, can work.  It works in Brazil, but then sugar cane grows by itself on the side of the road like a weed, and sugar cane has plenty of sugar in it.  I&#8217;m the farthest thing one can find from a farmer, and pretty ignorant about agriculture in general, but corn just doesn&#8217;t seem to have that much sugar in it, it seems to require some effort to cultivate, and it doesn&#8217;t seem all that easy to extract.  And it doesn&#8217;t help that the folks at Archer Daniels Midland seems to get caught engaging in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archer_Daniels_Midland#Price_fixing_investigation">unfortunate behavior</a> from time to time.</p>

<p>Also, reader NS has given us an overview of <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/02/reader-ns-view-of-riedls-10-myths.html">the Riedl approach</a>.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s Myth 7: &#8220;Myth #7: Reversing the upper-income tax cuts would raise substantial revenues.<br />Fact: The low-income tax cuts reduced revenues the most.&#8221;</p>
<p>To be honest, I think Riedl slipped up here, since I&#8217;m not sure the fact he brings up has anything to do with the myth. As per <a href="http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/002819.html">MaxSpeak</a>, both the myth and the fact can be true simultaneously. </p>
<p>But let me change the story a bit. Let&#8217;s say we were discussing not tax revenues but rather spending. Now, there are any number of inane things in the budget that everyone except a handful of recipients of the cash would agree are wasteful. All of us, left and right could agree with that, and we could probably come up with a long list that just about every reader of this blog and just about every member of Heritage could agree upon. </p>
<p>Now, if someone tried to defend one of those items by stating &#8211; well, these other items on the list are even more costly, nobody would consider that to be much of a defense. Defending the proposition that upper-income tax cuts are a good thing is one thing, but saying its not a problem because other tax cuts caused even bigger reductions in income, whether true or not, is a non-sequitor.</p>

                                <p>I used to watch a lot of soccer &#8211; now I still watch around World Cup time, but my sports watching now seems limited to a once every four year extavaganza limited to however long it takes the South American teams to be eliminated, or, if there&#8217;s an interesting European player like Bergkamp out there, however long it takes for his team to drop out.</p>
<p>The Superbowl is on now.  I&#8217;m not watching.  I don&#8217;t have much interest in football.  But I have some thoughts about football.  They&#8217;ve been kicking around my head for a long time &#8211; so long, in fact, that it may be they&#8217;re not original and I actually read them somewhere.  So if I&#8217;m plagiarizing someone&#8217;s idea, my apologies &#8211; its inadvertent.  My thoughts center around the idea that football is the quintessential American sport.  A few features of football that make it the quintessential American sport:</p>
<p>1.  Everyone on the team is a specialist<br />2.  The people on the field don&#8217;t resemble people you see in normal life<br />3.  The action lasts only a few seconds at a time<br />4.  The action is repeated over and over, from a zillion angles<br />5.  Marketing is more important what actually happens on the field<br />6.  There is an insane number of rules, some quite technical<br />7.  In the end, the call made by the referees is often the most important thing in deciding who wins<br />8.  Somone gets sued for something silly.  This year (I&#8217;m too lazy to hunt for links right now), some megachurches were told to cancel their Superbowl parties by the NFL, which was concerned that it would drive down Nielsen ratings<br />9.  There&#8217;s a lot of beer drinking involved</p>

                                <p><a href="http://weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/013/244lukra.asp">Noemie Emery</a> is ready to pounce on the Democrats in the unlikely event that Bush’s surge in Iraq turns out wonderful:</p>
<blockquote><p>Giddy with joy at their sudden good fortune, the Democrats have set out to embarrass the president, pushing resolutions of less-than-no-confidence, clubbing his Iraq surge plan as it lies in its cradle, and declaring defeat in advance. In some sense, they have achieved their objectives: They have embarrassed Bush, exposed his weakness, and won over a cadre of frightened Republicans. But they have also painted themselves into a number of corners, from which they may find it hard to escape. If Iraq is stabilized this side of chaos, the congressional Democrats will be remembered as the people who fought to prevent it, who tried to kneecap the commander and demoralize the armed forces, and all in all make the mission more difficult.</p></blockquote>
<p>Despite his dishonest claim that we Democrats oppose another Bush scheme destined to backfire only because we are more interesting in embarrassing the President than good policy – if Bush’s ill conceived plan actually works, we Democrats should tip our hat.  But does Noemie Emery really believe this nonsense?  Then explain what immediately followed in his op-ed:</p>
<blockquote><p>If, on the other hand, the surge is seen to fail, they will be the ones who made it more difficult, demoralized the armed forces, kneecapped the commander, and telegraphed to the enemy that our will was cracking, and we would shortly be leaving. The Democrats have also given Bush a partial alibi for a possible failure &#8211; he tried, but at a critical moment they threw in the towel. This argument would be plausible enough to attract support from a great many people.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2007_02/010681.php">Kevin Drum</a> wants to cut in right here:</p>
<blockquote><p>Over at the Weekly Standard, the magazine that provides the intellectual superstructure for hawkish neoconservatism, Noemie Emery provides the most straightforward version yet of the stab-in-the-back narrative that neocons plan<br />to lay on Democrats a few months from now &#8230; Why yes, it might be plausible enough to &#8220;attract support from a great many people&#8221;! It just might. But I wonder where all these people will get the idea in the first place? Such a wonderful invention, the passive voice, isn&#8217;t it?</p></blockquote>
<p>Now that we’ve given Kevin a chance to inject some commonsense, let’s get back to the pathetic rant of Noemie Emery:<br />
<blockquote>Had they let the surge play itself out, with best wishes but grave reservations, the Democrats could have gained a reputation for good will in any event, and for genuine prescience in the case of failure. But there is a difference between warning of failure ensues, it is no longer his fault, in its entirety. Now it is his fault &#8211; and theirs.</p></blockquote>
<p>That’s wonderful.  We Democrats are supposed to just shut up and let the Blundering-in-Chief proceed with his incompetence.  Otherwise, we are to blame for his failures.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Charles Krauthammer had a piece that appeared in the National Review called <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=ZTFhZGJiNWZjNzk2Zjg3N2YzODhmZDY0YWI3N2RiMmE=">Iraq’s choice</a>.  The premise is that Iraqis were given their freedom, and collectively they made a choice.  “They chose civil war.”  I’m not kidding.  Its this simple.  The choice, of course, leads to a situation in which “Arabs kill Arabs and Shiites kill Shiites and Sunnis kill all in a spasm of violence that is blind and furious.”  </p>
<p>Now, one might thing that not all of the Iraqis have chosen Civil War.  One might think that at least some have had violence imposed upon them like some massive negative externality.  But if Krauthammer feels that way, I’m not seeing it from his piece.  The closest he comes is one time writing that “many have chosen civil war.” But for the most part, the choice seems to be more, well, collective in Krauthammer&#8217;s piece.  But that’s about it.  He does write about opposition to the Civil War &#8211; in fact, close to a third of the piece seems to be about trying to reduce the violence.  But the only ones doing anything to reduce violence, from reading his piece, seem to be Americans.  But those Iraqis, they have made a choice, and denying that its an Iraqi choice “infantilizes Arabs.”</p>
<p>Which raises the question – for a guy like Krauthammer, who believes in free markets and choice – what is the justification for interfering with the choice of a bunch of individuals who have all collectively chosen to engage in Civil War?  What are American soldiers doing, interfering with the freedom of the Iraqis to butcher each other as they have chosen to do?  There have been so many incarnations of what is going on in Iraq according to folks like Krauthammer.  There was the cakewalk, then the last throes and the dead enders, and who can even count the corners that were turned?  And they&#8217;ve moved the goalposts so many times, redefined victory so many ways.  Along the way, anyone who noted discrepancies was tarred as a traitor and was giving aid to the enemy.  So if things don’t improve, and somehow, I don’t think they will (I have said before, I remember Reagan, GHW, and Clinton, but this crowd is qualitatively very different and not in a good way), what’s left for guys like Krauthammer?  Are they going to conclude that, well, we did the Iraqis a favor by giving them a choice that Saddam denied them, and look, they are better off now, happily acting upon their choice?</p>

<div>What point is <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16928315">Tom Curry</a> trying to make? He starts off with pie charts for the 1954 Federal budget ($70.8 billion) and the 2006 budget ($2654 billion):</p>
<p>
<blockquote>You may be asking: “Are you sure you’ve got those pie charts labeled correctly?” You can see at the top of this story two charts, one depicting federal spending in 1954, the other one showing federal outlays last year. With wars raging in Afghanistan and Iraq, and on terrorists elsewhere around the globe, the taxpayer last year spent an astonishing amount of money on the military: about $500 billion. The budget proposal that President Bush unveils Monday won’t ultimately change the size of the slices in that budget pie chart very much. Spending on the military accounted for 19 cents of every dollar of federal expenditures in 2006. That might seem like a lot, until you consider the Cold War year of 1954. That year marked the post-World War II peak of military spending, measured as a percentage of total federal outlays. Nearly 70 percent of all federal expenditures in 1954 went to buy rockets, rifles, radar, and nuclear warheads and to pay the salaries of Americans in uniform. If you measure it another way, military spending in 1954 accounted for 13 percent of the total U.S. economic output (gross domestic product, or GDP). Today it accounts for about four percent of GDP, a decline of 70 percent since 1954.</p></blockquote>
<p>I was wondering when he’d get away from comparing nominal figures over a half century apart to looking at percentages of GDP. But he needs to check again – defense spending is closer to 5% of GDP than 4% of GDP. Now that’s a lot less than 13% but then we aren’t fighting the Cold War anymore.</p>
<p>Curry then goes onto talk about how expensive Social Security and Medicare/Medicaid are and ends his op-ed with:</p>
<blockquote><p>Bernanke said unless the entitlement programs are redesigned, federal debt will grow to a point where it “would spark a fiscal crisis, which could be addressed only by very sharp spending cuts or tax increases, or both.” Senate Budget Committee chairman Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., is also sounding the alarm. “We’re heading for a circumstance in which all of federal spending will be consumed just by Medicare and Medicaid and Social Security,” Conrad said Thursday. “There’d be nothing left for national parks, for highways, etc. That’s the outlook in the long term, if we fail to act. The conclusion one reaches is that we’re on a completely unsustainable course.” Such a dismal scenario might make one nostalgic for 1954.</p></blockquote>
<p>It would have been nice to also tell his readers that payroll taxes have been much higher since 1983 than they were in 1954. Since Mr. Curry failed to, we did in our graph.</p></div>

<p>Also, reader NS has given us an overview of <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/02/reader-ns-view-of-riedls-10-myths.html">the Riedl approach</a>.</p>
<p>Moving on…</p>
<p>“Myth #6: Raising tax rates is the best way to raise revenue.<br />Fact: Tax revenues correlate with economic growth, not tax rates.”</p>
<p>Riedl is right about this.  But I’m not sure we agree on what this actually means.  Riedl goes on:</p>
<p>“Since revenues move with GDP, the common-sense way to increase tax revenues is to expand the GDP. This means that pro-growth policies such as low marginal tax rates (especially on work, savings, and investment), restrained federal spending, minimal regulation, and free trade would raise more tax revenues than would be raised by self-defeating tax increases.”</p>
<p>One minor quibble – presumably the idea is to grow real GDP per capita, not GDP, and I assume Riedl would agree.  But I have a problem with the idea that low marginal tax rates are necessarily “pro-growth.”  Consider… there are 50 states.  Residents of all of them live under the same Federal Tax System, but different state tax systems.  Even with each state, tax burdens change with time.  Now, we always read about how some state or other that cut taxes has been growing rapidly for the last ten years or so.  But… there are some states that historically – for many decades – have had historically high tax burdens.  One can name them – New York, Taxachussetts, California, and so forth.  And there are some states that have historically – for many decades &#8211; had low tax burdens.  Its also easy to compile that list – Tennessee, Mississippi, Alabama, etc.  And through all this time, which states have been driving this country?  Is the end goal to make us more like Alabama than Massachusetts?  </p>
<p>Now, a conservative might respond – well, there are historical reasons for that inequity.  Sure, but the historical reasons include the infrastructure built up by the taxes that have been paid in Massachusetts and have not been paid in Alabama.  And besides, this has been going on for a long time – how long does it take for people to vote with their feet and for people and businesses to migrate from the high tax hellholes to the low tax nirvanas – ten years?  Twenty?  Fifty?  One hundred?  The difference between Alabama and Massachusetts has been around for a very long time.  </p>
<p>That is not to say that simply raising taxes is the way to go.  As with everything else, the question is one of balance.  Cut taxes too much, shrink government too much, and you don’t have enough infrastructure.  Raise taxes too much, increase government too much, and you stagnate the private sector.  The question is – what is too high and what is too low.  I’ve covered some of that at various times and it may come up again in the context of the other Riedl myths.</p>

<p>
<div>While <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/02/cutting-farm-subsidies.html">Cactus</a> is hopeful that President Bush meant it when he proposed to reduce <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/services/site/premium/access-registered.intercept">farm subsidies</a>, permit me to be a bit cynical. Now I know that the Department of Agriculture’s budget for 2006 was only $96 billion, which translates into 0.72% of GDP. But the budget for 2001 was only $68 billion, which translates into 0.68% of GDP. In other words, during the last five years, nominal DOA spending rose by 41% as compared to the 31% growth rate in nominal GDP.</p>
<p>By comparison, total Federal spending in 2006 was 37.7% higher than it was in 2001. In other words, the ratio of Federal spending to GDP rose from 19.4% in 2001 to 20.3% in 2006. The Department of Defense, for example, commands a much larger portion of either the Federal budget or GDP – and it appears that this gigantic spending machine will not face cuts.</p>
<p>President Bush has lately been pretending that he is a small government. He certainly wasn’t for the first six years in office and I seriously doubt we’ll see cuts in Federal spending that will match the reductions in taxes he keeps promising to make permanent.</p></div>
<p>
<div></div>
<p>
<div><strong>Update</strong>: I owe our readers a couple of things. First, a major thank you to Brian Riedl of the Heritage Foundation for the comment. He certainly know the details of the Department of Agriculture better than I do – and he sort of goes to the left of me on this one. I expect if he and I could be in charge of our farm policy, we’d find a lot of common ground moving towards less trade restrictions and less Federal spending. I should also note that <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2007/01/stan_collender_.html">Brad DeLong</a> found common ground with Brian even if Brad added an originally extra “e” to his last name (now corrected). </div>
<p>
<div>The second thing is the graph of defense spending relative to GDP, which had dropped 4% during Clinton’s second term but is now around 4.7%. I suspect Brian and I would agree that it’d be nice if we could reduce defense spending, but this is not likely to happen in the next couple of years. </div>
<p>
<div>I know I’m sometimes hard on the Heritage Foundation, but as a member of the deficit hawk of the Democratic Party – I appreciate Brian’s efforts at pushing for fiscal responsibility. We on the left owe him two things – our support and spelling his name correctly. </div>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>I cannot believe that Lawrence Kudlow let <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=ZTE4ZGE5OTM5OTc5NjQwNTg5ZjMzOGM3MGE1NzMwNjQ=">Thomas Nugent</a> put this out:<br />
<blockquote>A few years back, traditionalists said that paying for the Iraq war would result in bigger budget deficits and rising interest rates, which would crowd out private investment. Yet, here we are &#8211; four years later &#8211; with low interest rates, rising investment, a booming economy, and a shrinking deficit. Then Hurricane Katrina hit, after which President Bush announced a plan to spend $200 billion to rebuild the ravaged Gulf Coast. The opposition responded that the resulting larger budget deficit would penalize future generations and drive interest rates higher. Some politicians even wanted to cut spending, postpone tax cuts, and raise taxes to pay for the hurricane damage. Yet here we are &#8211; one-and-a-half years later &#8211; with lower interest rates, a growing economy, rising incomes, and mounting wealth via record highs in the stock market.</p></blockquote>
<p>Before we get to the really stupid parts of this, let me backtrack and say that I can believe that Kudlow would allow stupid writing to be placed at the National Review given all the stupid things Kudlow has written himself. What I can’t believe is that the National Review has let an advocate of more government spending loose.<br />
<blockquote>Bernanke recently spoke extensively about the risks of a growing budget deficit, and of how it could precipitate federal insolvency and slow economic growth as investment is crowded out. Fortunately, Bernanke’s forecasting of Armageddon is based on the same traditional approach to fiscal policy practiced by many of today’s deficit hawks; it’s an approach that is easily refuted, as problem-solvers viewing the situation through an outsider’s lens might attest. Essentially, there is no relationship between budget deficits and insolvency. In fact, as former Fed chairman Alan Greenspan pointed out, with a floating exchange rate, there is no such thing as federal insolvency. Rather, the problem is the risk of future inflation caused by excessive federal-government demands on the private sector. But somehow Bernanke, our top inflation fighter, overlooks this fact, focusing instead on nonexistent insolvency risks. This insolvency issue is not unlike the accusation that, unless something is done, the Social Security system will go bankrupt. Again, one must understand how the U.S. government functions in a floating-exchange-rate environment. In effect, fiscal policies &#8211; i.e., spending and taxation &#8211; are not constrained by some fixed asset, such as the gold in Fort Knox. This had been the case prior to 1971, when the U.S. was constrained by the gold standard. But today the federal government can write as many checks as it desires, with the only limitation being the inflation risk created by excessive demands on the private sector. As an example, the federal government writes checks to construction companies for aircraft carriers, just as it writes checks to Social Security recipients in retirement. These entities then deposit their checks at local banks. When each check clears, the Federal Reserve credits the local bank’s reserve account at the Fed, after which the local bank credits the corporate or individual account with what is known as “good” funds. Operationally, virtually all of the federal government’s “spending” consists of the Fed crediting an account — that’s it. So essentially, there is no distinction between printing money and not printing money. Similarly, there is no federal “box of money” which receives tax collections and the proceeds from new Treasury securities, with these proceeds then available for use by the government through spending or lending.</p></blockquote>
<p>I suspect that Nugent never read Ben Bernanke’s testimony or the similar testimony from his predecessor. Both Federal Reserve chairmen were warning of the dangers of continuing to run large deficits for decades – not some one-off spending to address a single natural disaster. Heck, even the Iraq War does not constitute very long-term fiscal stimulus. And if Nugent thinks the Federal debt to GDP ratio can rise forever, he’s wrong. At some point, people will lose faith in even Federal bonds if we decide to permanently run the kind of fiscal irresponsibility that has infected us for the past six years.</p>
<p>Nugent’s time horizon seems to be limited to the last four years (dating back to before we invaded Iraq). It turns out that we entered 2003 with an employment to population ratio of only 62.5% and saw this drop to 62.0% by September 2003. So a little short-term fiscal stimulus from more government spending might have been prudent fiscal policy if it were combined with a commitment to move back to fiscal restraint in the long-run.</p>
<p>But could someone tell me what Nugent means by “yet here we are &#8211; one-and-a-half years later &#8211; with lower interest rates, a growing economy, rising incomes, and mounting wealth via record highs in the stock market.” The interest rate on ten-year Federal bonds, which was 4% as of mid-2005 ended 2006 above 4.5%. If Nugent thinks fiscal stimulus lowers interest rates, he really should listen more carefully to Ben Bernanke.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: While we’re on the topic of really dumb things, perhaps I should relay something emailed to me by our friend Mark Thoma – the latest from <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2007/02/float_the_fed_funds_rate.html">John Tammy</a> and his sidekick Wayne Jett:<br />
<blockquote>Laffer Curve adherents should not be surprised that inflation is spurred by rate hikes. Just as a rising income tax rate drives the marginal producer to the sidelines, increased interest costs drain capital accounts and discourage productive investment by reducing profits. Dollar demand decreases and inflationary pressures increase when central bank actions cool economic growth. The dollar weakens as the economy weakens.</p></blockquote>
<p>Tight monetary policy leads to more inflation and dollar devaluation?  Thank goodness we have Ben Bernanke heading the FED and not clowns like these two.  Just imagine it – more tax cuts, higher government spending, and monetary expansion all at the same time! Worry about inflation?  Heavens no – not as long as one is wearing the makeup, the big shoes, and the rest of that clown suit!</p>

<p>&#8220;Thousands of the nation&#8217;s richest farmers would lose their government subsidies under a Bush administration plan to curb farm spending.</p>
<p>Proposals released Wednesday would cut spending by $18 billion over the next five years. They represent President Bush&#8217;s vision of a new farm bill.</p>
<p>Anyone making more than $200,000 in adjusted gross income would be cut off from farm payments under Bush&#8217;s plan.</p>
<p>These producers, about 80,000 in all, are among the top 2.3 percent of taxpayers, officials said.</p>
<p>For those who are eligible, the ceiling on payments would still be $360,000.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hopefully, this for real.</p>
