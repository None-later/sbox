<blockquote>And he ought to activate and call the Federal Trade Commission-which is basically a sleepy organization that has given an interim report in terms of price-fixing and gouging-he ought to get them off and have them working seven days a week, 24/7, to make sure that we know exactly who is price-gouging.</p></blockquote>
<p>OK, I’m not convinced there is price-fixing or gouging either, but look at what else I found over at the <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/06_04_23_corner-archive.asp#095770">Corner</a> from KLo.  It seems she is happy when Speaker Hastert writes:<br />
<blockquote>Therefore, we believe that Federal law enforcement agencies and regulators should take every available step to ensure that all Federal laws protecting American consumers from price-fixing, collusion, gouging and other anti-competitive practices are vigorously enforced. We respectfully request that you direct the Attorney General and the Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission to investigate any potential collusion, price-fixing or gouging in the sale or distribution of gasoline, petroleum distillates or ethanol in wholesale and retail markets.</p></blockquote>
<p>Update: Given the President Bush has decided we need to investigate the allegations of price gouging <a href="http://billmon.org/archives/002406.html">Billmon</a> puts forth a must read attack on the Bush the Chicken S&#038;*t.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_luskin/luskin200604240749.asp">Donald Luskin</a> performs a public service – sort of.  He warns us that the Bush White House still wants to deform the current Social Security system:<br />
<blockquote>But reform isn’t dead. It can’t die. Reform is inevitable, because the Social Security system really is in crisis, in the sense that the accounting mirage of the Trust Fund doesn’t hold any real assets to pay off the system’s obligations. Even if it did, the assets would be exhausted in a few short decades as the baby boom generation retires … An editorial three weeks ago fulminated, “it’s information Congress and the public deserve to have. Holding up the reports seems like an attempt to hide the truth.” What truth? The truth that the so-called trust funds aren’t going to be able to cover promised benefits in the future? That’s precisely what the president said over and over last year &#8211; and that’s precisely what the Times consistently denied.</p></blockquote>
<p>The fact that the Trustee’s Report will not be issued until May 1 has never been a major concern to me.  After all, the moment that it is released – there will be several folks pouring all over the analysis with these folks ranging from serious scholars to partisan hacks.  Luskin is clearly in the latter category when he claims that President Bush has been telling us the truth.  After all, Bush wants us to believe that the Trust Fund is teetering on bankruptcy now and that it will be flat broke by 2042.  Luskin has made similar comments but now he notes that “assets would be exhausted in a few short decades as the baby boom generation retires”.  OK, four (as in decades) qualifies as “few” even if I’m not sure a decade is properly considered a short period of time.  And even if the reserves that do exist – even if Luskin calls them a mirage – do run out in about 40 years or so, the Trust Fund will still be collecting payroll contributions.  </p>
<p>But what is the Bush-Luskin plan to magically save the Social Security system?  Is it the destruction of the system itself or is it some reduction in benefits to current recipients or to the kids just entering the market?  Oh no, President Bush is telling granny she won’t have to sacrifice a dime, while he is telling junior that he’ll be better off.  Of course, such promises are financially impossible if the system is as insolvent as Luskin wants us to believe.</p>
<p>But the high comedy of Luskin’s rant is when he decided to take on <a href="http://www.cbpp.org/1-18-06socsec.htm">William Spriggs and Jason Furman</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Spriggs and Furman celebrate how wonderful the Social Security status quo is for blacks. They totally ignore that the punishing Social Security payroll tax consumes any capacity for independent retirement savings that might have been enjoyed by lower-income Americans of any race, leaving them effectively wards of the state in their old age.  Instead, the authors sing the praises of how blacks benefit from the current system’s “progressive” benefit formulas that are skewed in favor of lower earners; how blacks, who are more likely to become disabled, can take greater advantage of the program’s disability benefits; and how blacks, thanks to their lower average life expectancy, benefit more from the program’s survivor benefits. All those things are true. But Spriggs and Furman lie when they use their academic skills to manipulate statistics to claim that Bush’s proposals do anything but make all those things even more true.</p></blockquote>
<p>What does Luskin mean by “punishing Social Security payroll tax consumes any capacity for independent retirement savings that might have been enjoyed by lower-income Americans of any race, leaving them effectively wards of the state in their old age?”  And what Bush proposal is Luskin babbling about? </p>
<p>Let me put this in context by dragging out what seemed to be Robert Barro’s thinking when Governor Bush was running for the White House in 2000.  As I understand the very smart and very honest and quite conservative Dr. Barro’s position – he would have done three things: (1) eliminate all Social Security benefits; (2) eliminate all payroll contributions; and (3) take the Social Security reserves and given them to old people currently on retirement.  Got it?  Luskin’s dream come true.  What Barro admits – even if Luskin can’t comprehend such simple finances – is that complete privatization would have meant that Bush’s tax cuts would have been exposed as leading to a bankruptcy of the General Fund.  OK, I have said the General Fund is on a bankruptcy path even under the current system.  The only difference being that the Trust Fund surpluses – which Luskin calls a mirage – are used by some rightwing hacks (e.g., Luskin) to claim the Federal finances aren’t so bad.</p>
<p>So how does the White House plan to address the General Fund fiasco?  Simple – cut Social Security benefits by MORE than we cut payroll contributions.  Lower income individuals still will be punished in terms of “any capacity for independent retirement savings” as they see their future Social Security checks being reduced.  Of course, Luskin is not so stupid not to realize that such proposals will make lower income individuals worse off – but he is hoping his readers are that stupid.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.tpmcafe.com/node/29098">Larry Johnson</a> comments on the firing of whistleblower Mary McCarthy:<br />
<blockquote>I am struck by the irony that Mary McCarthy may have been fired for blowing the whistle and ensuring that the truth about an abuse was told to the American people. There is something potentially honorable in that action; particularly when you consider that George Bush authorized Scooter Libby to leak misleading information for the purpose of deceiving the American people about the grounds for going to war in Iraq.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.davidcorn.com/archives/2006/04/the_spy_who_vot.php">David Corn</a> promises to follow this story and has this clever phrasing:<br />
<blockquote>especially since I expect the partisans on the right to argue that anyone who wanted Libby or Roe prosecuted for leaking (vis a vis Valerie Wilson) should call for the same in this case. Not necessarily, for as the White House said recently, there are good leaks and bad leaks. And leaking about CIA abuses is not the same as leaking to discredit a policy critic.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes – put me down as saying Ms. McCarthy’s leak was good.  But if they decide to prosecute her, I think Dirty Harry captured my view of this: “Go on punk, make my day”.  After all, Abbe Lowell intends to call Condoleezza Rice to testify in what has been called an <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2006_04/008665.php">authorized leak</a> matter.</p>
<p>Corn also catches this part of the continuing story as reported by the Washington Post:<br />
<blockquote>The White House also has recently barraged the agency with questions about the political affiliations of some of its senior intelligence officers, according to intelligence officials. The White House also has recently barraged the agency with questions about the political affiliations of some of its senior intelligence officers, according to intelligence officials.</p></blockquote>
<p>Corn is right about this:<br />
<blockquote>Seems to me this deserves more than a sentence. Is there now a partisan loyalty oath at the CIA? McCarthyites snooping about among the spies? If I could order up a Post investigation, I would say dig deeper here.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Corn’s prediction about the rightwing’s reaction to Ms. McCarthy’s firing is already coming true.  <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/06_04_23_corner-archive.asp#095653">Jonah Goldberg</a> pulls a Robert Novak trolling the FEC records to see if she contributed to Kerry’s campaign right after Andy McCarthy posted an extended version of the same thing.  The <a href="http://fallbackbelmont.blogspot.com/">Belmont Club</a> reaches back to the 1998 bombing of -Shifa chemical weapons factory to smear her, Richard Clarke, and to dust off the canard about Saddam and Al Qaeda working together.</p>
<p>I have a suggested new title for the National Review: <strong>McCarthyism R’ Us</strong>.</p>
<p><em><strong>Update II</strong></em>: <a href="http://www.drudgereport.com/flash6.htm">Drudge</a> provides the views on Senator Kerry on this matter.  <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/06_04_23_corner-archive.asp#095661">KLo</a> decides to slam Senator Kerry.  I guess KLo believes telling the truth is treason.  Go figure.</p>
<p><strong>Update III</strong>: <a href="http://levin.nationalreview.com/archives/095634.asp">Mark Levin</a> does the dirty work in a post entitled Who is Mary McCarthy.  Catch the comparison to the Valerie Plame leak:<br />
<blockquote>I must say, however, that the media&#8217;s sickening hypocrisy knows no bounds. They came to the defense of Joe Wilson and his wife, Valerie Plame, who worked behind-the-scenes to get her husband that “fact-finding” trip to Niger. They demanded an investigation into who “leaked” Plame’s identity to Bob Novak &#8211; which ensnared their own reporters. They hoped they would critically wound the president, and they failed. Clearly Plame was not undercover and the revelation of her identity was not a crime. Lewis Libby now stands accused of lying about a crime that never occurred and the media think that’s a good thing.</p></blockquote>
<p>Document the lies.  Wilson’s wife was the one who sent Joe to Niger.  She was not undercover.  No crime ever occurred.  I trust the readers of National Review are not so stupid not to realize how much the NRO writers lie to them.  So why repeat such transparent lies over and over again?</p>
<p><strong>Update IV</strong>: First, Tom Maguire notes I need to brush up on my Dirty Harry lines.  Next, <a href="http://levin.nationalreview.com/archives/095671.asp">Mark Levin</a> says Senator Kerry is a traitor, while<a href="http://www.firedoglake.com/2006/04/23/the-radio-republicans-got-emotion">Taylor Marsh</a> notes that Levin is Rush Limbaugh’s cabin boy.  Taylor calls these rightwingers on their game with lots of links that detail what is going on here.</p>
<p><em><strong>Final Update</strong></em>: It seems that <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/06_04_23_corner-archive.asp#095653">Jonah Goldberg</a> first thought trolling through Mary McCarthy’s FEC records was all important but then he <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/06_04_23_corner-archive.asp#095683">changed his mind</a>: <br />
<blockquote>Assuming McCarthy is the leaker, I think some people &#8211; perhaps even yours truly &#8211; might be putting too much emphasis on the partisan donation thing. I think it&#8217;s relevant, but hardly dispositive &#8211; indeed, given the paltry supply of facts, nothing is settled. I have no doubt there are plenty of ardent Democrats and Republicans in all branches of the defense bureaucracy who would never dream of leaking classified information solely out of partisan ardor. And, I sincerely doubt that, if McCarthy&#8217;s guilty, her motives were anything like transparently partisan. Most people align with political parties because they have certain beliefs, not the other way around.</p></blockquote>
<p>I ask you &#8211; is Goldberg principled or just plain goofy?</p>

                                <p>We have been hearing about record oil prices.  We all know how the press tends to ignore the nominal to real distinction so I decided to check out the excellent graphs from <a href="http://www.wtrg.com/">WRTG Economics</a>.  Their graph of real oil prices from <a href="http://www.wtrg.com/oil_graphs/oilprice1947.gif">1947 to 2004</a> express oil prices in term of 2004$.   For a brief period during the early 1980’s, oil prices exceeded $60 in terms of 2004$.  They also show <a href="http://www.wtrg.com/daily/cbspot.gif">nominal prices</a> from April 1, 2005 to April 21, 2006 reporting a price equal to $73.60 per barrel.  With general prices about 5% higher than they were in 2004, we are talking about $70 per barrel in terms of 2004$.  One has to go back to <a href="http://www.wtrg.com/oil_graphs/oilprice1869.gif">1869</a> to see real oil prices that high.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_comment/tamny200604210840.asp">John Tamny</a> observes that the capacity utilization rate has reached 81.3% and wonders why the FED is raising interest rates.  <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2006/04/are_unemploymen.html">Mark Thoma</a> reads Tamny’s argument that we should only worry about world aggregate demand as compared to world supply and says:<br />
<blockquote>This is wrong.</p></blockquote>
<p>OK, that statement was actually in response to the tired old truism that inflation is a monetary phenomenon, which Tamny repeats ad nauseam without ever understanding the concept.</p>
<p>Tamny rests his case on an absurd notion of factor mobility:<br />
<blockquote>Ip’s reasoning requires one to believe that the U.S. economy is isolated, activity within it static, and operating without integration in the world economy. Much as trade “imbalances” are irrelevant in what is increasingly an integrated world economy, so too are perceived labor and capacity shortages.  Indeed, with the continued penetration of 100 million-plus workers from the former Soviet Union, China, and India into the labor force, the notion of coming labor shortages seems pretty farfetched. </p></blockquote>
<p>The immigration debate should be one clue that labor is not as mobile as Tamny assumes.  But capacity utilization involves machinery not labor and physical capital is even less mobile.  Tamny tries to address the lack of physical capital mobility thusly:<br />
<blockquote>Domestically, it has to be remembered that as opposed to being static, capacity is ever changing. Be it through the expansion of existing plants, the introduction of robotics, or innovation that expands output from existing facilities, capacity is a fluid concept that should not be measured in terms of the here and now.</p></blockquote>
<p>Capital is even mobile across time?  Excuse me, but investment represents accumulation OVER TIME.  Also remember what Tamny’s NRO colleagues tend to ignore – Bush’s fiscal stimulus (which they endorse) reduce national savings and investment.  But wait a second – what about the possibility that we can consume products made abroad:<br />
<blockquote>it should be remembered that U.S. shoe and apparel maker Nike has never manufactured any of its products in the United States; that while airplane maker Boeing is based in Chicago, it will manufacture its 787 Dreamliner in six different countries around the world; that the design of Apple Ipods occurs in the U.S., but the components necessary to create the Ipod are imported. In other words, while U.S. companies design their products here, they access the world for capacity, making any domestic capacity measures irrelevant.</p></blockquote>
<p>Granted – we can investment more than we save if are willing to amass debts to the rest of the world.  But doesn’t GDP, which measures domestic production, include net exports (albeit this is currently a large negative number).  So what is Tamny talking about?  Perhaps he’s still on his absurd notion that the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/04/yuan-and-hume-specie-flow-model.html">Hume Specie Flow</a> forces all nations to have the same monetary policy and inflation rate.  Perhaps someone should tell Mr. Tamny that we left the fixed exchange rate regime known as Bretton Woods over 30 years ago.</p>
<p>While I think the FED should monitor the capacity utilization rate, I’m not happy that the FED has been raising interest rates.  The above graph of the capacity utilization rate may help explain why.  While the capacity utilization rate is certainly well above where it was at the end of 2001, it is still short of where it was during the late 1990’s.  In other words, the statistic is suggesting we are not yet at full employment.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/asiapcf/04/21/nepal.ap/index.html">King Gyanendra</a> of Nepal is promising to restore power to the people, while <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/06_04_16_corner-archive.asp#095561">KLo</a>  is under the illusion that George Bush has ousted another long standing tyrant:<br />
<blockquote>If I were Tony Snow, I&#8217;d totally give Bush credit for the freedom&#8217;s advance in Kathmandu.</p></blockquote>
<p>Maybe KLo should learn more about the <a href="http://www.achrweb.org/Review/2005/58-05.htm">history</a> of Nepal:<br />
<blockquote>The declaration by His Majesty King Gyanendra himself as the de jure ruler of Nepal after dismissing Sher Bahadur Deuba led coalition government on 1 February 2005 has all the ingredients of a coup d’état. Emergency has been declared and all civil liberties including the right to freedom of association and peaceful assembly remain suspended &#8230; This is despite the fact that there has not been any democratic government since the dissolution of the parliament on 22 May 2002 and subsequent dismissal of the elected government of Sher Bahadur Deuba on 4 October 2002. The Narayanti Palace has been ruling Nepal with puppets – Lokendra Bahadur Chand, Surya Bahadur Thapa and Sher Bahadur Deuba &#8230; the latest developments bring international community and the de jure and de facto ruler, King Gyanendra into direct confrontation over democracy, human rights, rule of law and conflict resolutions. The excuses made by international community that they are dealing with a democratic government have partly contributed to the present imbroglio. Fortunately, international community including India can no longer make these excuses now.  The democratic forces in Nepal are also responsible for the current mess. First of all, a draconian provision like Article 127 should have never found a place in the Constitution of Nepal. After a decade of misrule in 1990s, former Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala never allowed his erstwhile deputy Sher Bahadur Deuba to function effectively after he was forced to resign over the Maoists violence in July 2001. King Gyanendra drew first blood when he dissolved the parliament on 22 May 2002, taking advantage of the split in the Nepali Congress, largely created by Koirala. There were murmurs but little visible protests to shake up the Palace. The King gave four months to Deuba before sacking him on 4 October 2002 on frivolous grounds and restoring his own rule through proxies. When Surya Bahadur Thapa resigned on 7 May 2004, the squabble between Koirala and Deuba continued with Koirala openly questioning the possible re-appointment of Deuba as the Prime Minister. Ultimately, Koirala refused to join the coalition government. Since Deuba was re-appointed as Prime Minister on 2 June 2004, Madhav Nepal of the Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist Lenninist) was sucking up to the Palace to prove that he is more loyal than the King. Yet, international community conjured up a spectre of united democratic forces to confront the Maoists.</p></blockquote>
<p>This particular account from a year ago ended with: <br />
<blockquote>The United Nations must also act decisively. The members of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights should hold a Special Session on the situation of human rights in Nepal immediately and send an international investigation team to Nepal report to the forthcoming 61st session.</p></blockquote>
<p>I don’t recall any decisive action either from the UN or the US.  I’m hoping the citizens of Nepal can achieve democracy through peaceful means, but to suggest that President Bush has done a stellar job here is really bizarre.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>I received the same email that <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2006/04/those_people_ar.html#more">Mark Thoma</a> received as to the latest from <a href="http://www.opinionjournal.com/columnists/pnoonan/?id=110008260">Peggy Noonan</a>. In my view, Mark is too kind to Ms. Noonan.  For example – if I had the opportunity to write something for the adult readers of the Wall Street Journal (OK, I bet most of them skip the op-ed section), I would not treat them like nursery school kids.  Peggy disagrees: <br />
<blockquote>Its strengths are his strengths and its weaknesses his weakness. This White House is him. The decisions it makes are him &#8230; It was a mess. Messes aren&#8217;t all bad.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m sorry – but my 4-year old niece prefers Dr. Seuss.  But one might understand such juvenile phrasing once ones tries to kind the substance (if any) in what she writes:<br />
<blockquote>We all like a president who says &#8220;The buck stops here.&#8221; Mr. Bush never ducks the buck. But he puts severe limits on the number and kind of people who can hand it to him. He picks them, receives their passionate and by definition limited recommendations, makes his decision, and sticks. All very Trumanesque, except Truman could tolerate argument and dissent.</p></blockquote>
<p>While it is true that Bush does not seem to care for opposing opinions – to suggest that he takes responsibility for what happens on his watch is a joke.  Bush does not even take responsibility for his own decisions as in the one on March 19, 2003 and the many decisions that massively increased the Federal deficit.  </p>
<p>Noonan could not resist bashing a couple of former Presidents – both of whom just happened to be Democrats.  Look at her case for the premise that President Carter micro-managed:<br />
<blockquote>He would not, as Mr. Carter did at Desert One, instruct the leaders of a high-risk military rescue mission not to shoot on any Teheran crowds if they move against the mission. (See Mark Bowden&#8217;s recounting of that failed endeavor in this month&#8217;s Atlantic.)</p></blockquote>
<p>I have no idea whether our troops would have shot on the crowds in Teheran as the helicopters never got there.  But then equipment failures were not due to micro-management from the Oval Office.  But read <a href="http://iran.theatlantic.com/">Mark Bowden&#8217;s</a> account for yourself.</p>
<p>Noonan goes after President Clinton as she praises President Reagan:<br />
<blockquote>Bill Clinton didn&#8217;t govern by personal conviction, in part because he doesn&#8217;t seem to have known what his convictions were. They were unknown even to his cabinet members &#8230; Ronald Reagan&#8217;s convictions were clear to everyone around him.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ah Peggy – was it clear to you that President Reagan wanted to bankrupt the Federal government?  It was clear to most of us that President Clinton wanted to restore fiscal responsibility.  Was it clear to you that Reagan was against free trade?  Then again – George W. Bush talks a lot about fiscal restraint and the virtue of free trade.  Yet, he does just the opposite.  And Ms. Noonan still praises Bush’s economic policies suggesting a simple little calibration.  <strong>Good grief!</strong></p>

<blockquote>If things were so bad before, they should have resigned in protest instead of complaining publicly once they were safely in retirement and, in some cases, had books to promote.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ah, Glenn – some of the generals did resign in protest.  General Zinni was already retired and eloquently counseled our government not to invade Iraq before March 19, 2003.  Speaking of General Zinni, the ouch applies to his update as if he never read <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/04/swiftboating-anthony-zinni.html">this</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, Glenn did read approvingly <a href="http://hnn.us/blogs/entries/24044.html">Judith Apter Klinghoffer</a>:<br />
<blockquote>The American army in Iraq does not have a single general with enough guts to respond to the president&#8217;s question with &#8220;depends on what you want us to do?&#8221;  Sorry, guys, civil control of the military is not our problem. Gutless military leadership is. </p></blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Update</strong></em>: <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/06_04_16_corner-archive.asp#095417">KLo</a> lectures those retired generals:<br />
<blockquote>these retired officers should have informed their superiors of their analyses while on active duty and, if they were not allowed to do so or they believed that our strategy and tactics would be as disastrous as they now claim, then they had the option of resigning in protest and making their  objections known</p></blockquote>
<p>At the risk of repeating myself – that’s what some of them did.  DUH!</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.washtimes.com/commentary/20060418-085948-1006r.htm">Bruce Bartlett</a> continues on the theme that President Bush is “less than conservative” as he writes about Fred Barnes:<br />
<blockquote>In every administration, there is always one journalist that the White House trusts above the others to represent its point of view. In this administration, it is Fred Barnes of the Weekly Standard magazine. Whenever you read one of Mr. Barnes&#8217; columns, you know that you are getting an inside perspective … Early in the book, Mr. Barnes concedes Mr. Bush lacks a “conservative governing temperament.” Although insisting Mr. Bush is indeed a conservative, Mr. Barnes admits that he is &#8220;no libertarian or small government conservative” … Mr. Barnes also admits Mr. Bush&#8217;s governing philosophy, taken on its own terms, is incoherent.</p></blockquote>
<p>Incoherent – yes.  But this is the same Fred Barnes that praised Bush as a “big government conservative” simply because Bush PRETENDED to reduce our taxes (OK, I made the same comment over at the blog of <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2006/04/culling_the_con.html">Mark Thoma</a>).  </p>
<p>But this is nothing more than a warm-up for a discussion of an attack on Senator Clinton coming from fake conservative <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/kudlow/kudlow200604181516.asp">Lawrence Kudlow</a> entitled “Waking Up to Hillary’s Big Government Nightmare”:<br />
<blockquote>Citing a recent report by New York financier Felix Rohatyn and former senator Warren Rudman, Clinton is calling for a “national investment authority” to rebuild the nation. This in her view will solve all our problems related to airports, highways, bridges, hurricanes, and lord knows what else. She speaks as though Congress didn’t already spend a fortune on the recent highway bill, replete with corrupt budget earmarks that totaled a cool $30 billion in 2005.</p></blockquote>

<p>I decided to skip the juvenile cheap shots from the man in the cheap suit to go to a graph of government spending (Federal, state, and local) all relative to GDP (Kudlow really does need to read <a href="http://beatthepress.blogspot.com/2006/04/when-out-of-context-is-untrue.html">Dean Baker</a>).  $30 billion as a percent of a $12 trillion GDP is what Larry?  And maybe you will note over the past 30 years, this percentage has declined from 1.4% to 1.0% where as education spending has declined from 5.6% to 4.9%.  But it is true that public spending on health care rose during the Clinton years – and CONTINUED TO INCREASE during the Bush years.  With that prescription drug benefit that Bush is bragging about – guess what is going to happen to public spending on health care as a percent of GDP over the next several years?</p>

                                <p>We had a couple of data releases this week telling us something about inflation.  Today&#8217;s release was the <a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm">CPI data</a> for March, which comes on the heels of yesterday&#8217;s <a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/ppi.nr0.htm">PPI data</a> release. </p>
<p>Today&#8217;s news release showed surprisingly high inflation in non-energy consumer items.  For some, this has raised alarm bells:<br />
<blockquote>WASHINGTON (<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=%7B86CBEAE4-1E7E-450E-B16C-A64B7508E95B%7D&#038;siteid=mktw&#038;dist=">MarketWatch</a>) &#8212; U.S. core consumer prices increased at the fastest pace in a year, the Labor Department said Wednesday.</p>
<p>&#8230;&#8221;After months of subdued core CPI inflation amidst an environment of charged energy prices, today&#8217;s report provides a signal, albeit noisy, that the long-awaited pass-through of higher costs to a wide range of consumer prices has arrived,&#8221; said Kenneth Beauchemin, U.S. economist at Global Insight.</p>
<p>Beauchemin said the rise in the CPI was consistent with expectations that the Federal Reserve would be hiking rates two more times before stopping. After the summary of the Federal Open Market Committee&#8217;s March meeting were released Tuesday, financial markets were hoping that Fed policymakers might only hike one more time. See full story.</p>
<p>&#8220;This was not a good report, especially if you are a member of the FOMC,&#8221; said Joel Naroff, president of Naroff Economic Advisors.</p></blockquote>
<p>Is there really cause for concern about inflation?  First of all, let me emphasize what I usually say about monthly reports: one month&#8217;s reading does not make a trend.  These things are notoriously volatile.  To really get a sense for what&#8217;s going on, one should look at several months&#8217; data together.  The following picture shows various inflation measures (both overall and &#8216;core&#8217;, meaning that it excludes food and energy) over 6-month periods.  </p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/infl_mar06.jpg"></p>
<p>For the first time in years, consumer prices for non-energy items have actually risen faster than consumer prices including energy goods over the past six months (as of March, at least).  And the core CPI rate does seem to be tending in a somewhat upward-ish direction&#8230;</p>
<p>Cause for alarm?  No, I don&#8217;t think so.  But something to keep an eye on?  Probably not a bad idea.</p>
