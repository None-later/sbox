<blockquote>Before the president’s tax cut of 2003, there were slightly more than 2.5 million unfilled jobs in the country. Now there are over 5 million &#8230; Commentators have consistently underrated the dynamic effect of marginal and investment tax cuts. This has caused them to miss the fact that since 2003, millions of people have entered the work force.</p></blockquote>
<p>Notice something – his own chart drawn from <a href="http://www.bls.gov/jlt/home.htm">JOLTS</a> (Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey) says this figure is 4.1 million, which my math teacher said was LESS than 5 million.  Also, job openings typically rise during recoveries – and this recovery was bound to happen even with the 2003 tax cut.  Also realize that the labor force typically rising over time.  While the labor force participation rate was around 67% before Bush took office, it seems stuck at around 66% now. </p>

The first reporting of this rate was during the last month of Clinton’s term in office (I bet the rightwing just hates that).  The rate fell during the recession and has only partially recovered.  </p>
<p>The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey is fairly new but the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beveridge_curve">Beveridge curve</a> concept has been around for quite some time.</p>

                                <p>The death of <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/06/08/iraq.al.zarqawi/index.htmlX">Abu Musab al-Zarqawi</a> was welcome news for almost all Americans – liberal or conservative – even if it provided the opportunity for certain <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=NTFmMDQ2ZDMzNDc4ZTQ2MGQ5YWI4NGQ2Y2JiNzYzNjk=">wingnuts</a> to suggest we Democrats were not elated.  In the same vein, Jonah Goldberg is either displaying his inability to read or defending his own dishonesty.</p>
<p>We noted <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/05/sulli-v-goldberg-on-ponnurus-party-of.html">some time ago</a> that Mr. Goldberg loves to lecture Andrew Sullivan for not reading things as Mr. Goldberg displays his own inability to read.  Or was the following his penchant for dishonesty. <a href="http://www.shadowtv.com/redirect/notification.jsp?vid=b5b18ff8c9f35188b58930aa3f629b73">John Murtha</a> states in an interview:<br />
<blockquote>This is significant, one, the fact that Zarqawi is killed but also the fact they appointed a defense minister and interior minister. There&#8217;s no question we can&#8217;t win this militarily. It&#8217;s a matter of time. The Iraqis are getting better. I think the intelligence came from the Iraqis, as I understand it.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=MjhlMzA2NjcyODBkNjgyNzc0ODMxYWViOGIyZTkxZjA">Goldberg</a> writes:<br />
<blockquote>In an interview with CNN he stays on message. There&#8217;s no reason necessarily to think we needed troops in Iraq to get Zarqawi and &#8220;we cannot win this.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, Goldberg later acknowledged that a reader called him on this honesty &#8211; excusing himself by noting he provided a link.  Pathetic?  Dishonest?  Stupid?  All of the above?  Yet – it is par for the course for those over at the Corner of the National Review.  To them – al Qaeda is not the enemy as their war is with Democrats.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=YzliZTEzYWFmOTQ3ZmEyMjNjZjExZDczMmMyYTc3MWM=">Rich Lowry</a> takes bashing Democrats to a new – and very low – level:<br />
<blockquote>But sometimes the ledger is indeed quite simple—with Zarqawi’s demise, the sum total of evil in the world is now a little less. Everyone professes to know this. But some know it more than others. Otherwise a major Democrat like John Kerry wouldn’t be advocating a full U.S. pullout from Iraq … Within hours of the news breaking of Zarqawi’s death, Rep. John Murtha was on CNN saying we should leave Iraq and let the Iraqis work out their civil war just the way we worked out ours &#8230; From beyond the grave, Zarqawi can only wish that the Democrats for a pullout had been able to affect their preferred policy already. Then this loathsome man who so needed killing would instead still be working his evil will.</p></blockquote>
<p>We were staying in Iraq only so we could kill Zarqawi?  Never mind how utterly stupid such statements are – doesn’t it follow that Zarqawi’s demise means we can leave NOW – assuming one is crazy enough to accept Lowry’s logic.  Speaking of which, what on earth does this mean?<br />
<blockquote>Killing Zarqawi is the equivalent of averting a Haditha every other day in Iraq, indefinitely.</p></blockquote>
<p>The fact that we finally decided to pull the trigger on Zarqawi – something that Bush said no to on three occasions in 2002 – in no way excuses Haditha.</p>
<p><strong>Update II</strong>: <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/eric-boehlert/the-washington-times-slim_b_22599.html">Eric Boehlert</a> notes that the Washington Times headline was nothing more than a lie.</p>

                                <p>One would think the Senate was considering the repeal of the <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2006/06/08/pf/taxes/estate_tax_debate/index.htm">estate tax</a>.  OK, this effort died.</p>
<p><a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=MDg3Zjk0YWRhNjZiMWQyM2FiYmUwYjZkMTU0MzZjYzA=">Deroy Murdock</a> appeals to environmentalists to support the repeal of the estate tax with this claim:<br />
<blockquote>A predominantly Democratic group of U.S. senators wants to preserve a law that destroys 2.98 million acres of forests annually an area the size of Yellowstone and Yosemite national parks, combined. When the Senate votes this morning, Republicans and fair-minded Democrats should stop this arboricide by killing the federal death tax.</p></blockquote>
<p>To be honest, this one is a new one on me.  Now if this claim sounds absurd &#8211; Murdock has several sources including a collection of the usual spin from <a href="http://www.cato.org/pubs/tbb/tbb-0606-36.pdf">Chris Edwards</a>.   Murdock suggests that Edwards said the following:<br />
<blockquote>While liberals support the Death Tax in order to break up concentrations of wealth, large and concentrated land holdings often are good for the environment, the Death Tax winds up favoring developers over natural habitat.”</p></blockquote>
<p>I see a lot of nutty claims in the Edwards piece but nothing along this line.  Murdock references a 2001 piece by Dan Miller &#8211; one of Saxton’s hacks at the Joint Economic Committee, but all this piece did was to cite some 1995 piece by something called the Keystone Center:<br />
<blockquote>Federal estate tax requirements are a major obstacle for private landowners whose land stewardship has been sensitive to its environmental value and who would like to be able to pass on their land to their heirs without destroying that value. The imposition of federal estate taxes often forces large parcels of environmentally valuable land to be broken up into smaller, less environmentally valuable parcels. Some of the best remaining habitat for endangered species is put at risk in this manner</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s a far cry from this claim that habitat might be put at risk to Murdock’s claim that the estate tax destroys 3 million acres a year.   But it seems that the <a href="http://www.cei.org/utils/printer.cfm?AID=1592">Competitive Enterprise Institute</a> relied on this Keystone quote to put forth Murdock’s spin many years ago.  No matter how absurd the argument nor how dishonest the cherry picked quotes can be – these canards as to the alleged negative effects of the estate tax never die.</p>
<p>Update: <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=NWM2NmVkN2E0Y2I1MGY3YjAyM2M3OTMyODY2OGY5MmY=">The Corner</a> flashes back to <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/miller/miller200406020843.asp">John J. Miller</a> where he said that Chris Edwards and Stephen Slivinski are two of the smartest budget/fiscal policy guys in Washington.  Really?!</p>
<p>Now the whole point of this NTO oped is to show us how easily we could cut $300 billion out of the Federal budget “without touching defense appropriations or homeland security outlays (with the exception of privatizing the Transportation Security Administration and a few other small-bore reforms)”.  And by some higher order differential calculus that only Edwards and Slivinski comprehend, a $300 billion spending cut will eliminated a $500 billion budget deficit.  Miller writes:<br />
<blockquote>So how hard is it to find $300 billion to trim? Not so tough, if you follow the Cato methodology.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let’s add the proposals up – eliminate the Community Development Block Grants in the Department of Housing and Urban Development and save $6 billion a year PLUS eliminate the Traffic Control to save another $3 billion a year.  Hey, why do we need air traffic control when these Cato rocket scientists can translate $9 million into $300 billion and eliminate a $500 billion deficit by “magic. Presto!”?<br />Actually – Edwards did propose $300 billion in spending cuts, which included almost $25 billion in reductions for spending on elementary and secondary education.  Perhaps today’s lesson is that any reader of the National Review who does not realize that Murdock and Miller are blowing smoke likely need to go back to elementary school.  <br />But <a href="http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/002266.html">Max Sawicky</a> picks up on this statement from Chris Edwards:<br />
<blockquote>Much of the value in large estates consists of unrealized capital gain, which currently avoids capital gains taxes because asset basis is stepped up to market value at death. That has the effect of reducing federal revenues by more than $50 billion annually.  </p></blockquote>
<p>Max fires back:</p>
<blockquote><p>In other words, this income is the bulk of large estates and but for the estate tax, it would never be taxed.</p></blockquote>
<p>But let’s give Chris the last word:</p>
<blockquote><p>Under most estate tax repeal plans, some portion of unrealized gains would be carried over to heirs who would pay tax when they sold the assets.</p></blockquote>
<p>Could someone call a tax attorney? Oh wait, the attorney won’t be interested in the proposed change in tax law as it thankfully failed.</p>

                                <p>It is interesting to witness the spin from both sides on Brian Bilbray’s narrow defeat over Francine Busby.  <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2006_06/008961.php">Steve Benes</a> who is doing an excellent job over at Kevin Drum’s blog writes:<br />
<blockquote>It&#8217;s very much reminiscent of Jean Schmidt narrowly defeating Paul Hackett is Ohio&#8217;s 2nd last year &#8211; a race that the GOP was supposed to win easily went down to the wire, and ended up costing Republicans a fortune. Put it this way: if the GOP has to work this hard just to keep ordinarily &#8211; safe Republican districts in November, they better raise more money than they&#8217;ve ever raised before.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=NGI5N2ZmMjQxMGRjYWRmMjU0MzBkYmUyOWZjMjlmNjU">John Pitney</a> writing for the National Review claims:<br />
<blockquote>In a couple of ways, the outcome was quite remarkable. As of the last FEC report, Busby had raised more money than Bilbray.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well she did raise over $2 million whereas Bilbray raised only $1 million.  Of course, other Republicans running for the Dukester’s former seat also raised a fair chunk of change.  </p>
<p>Steve Benes said something about $5 million coming from the RNCC, which was not included in Pitney’s spin – but <a href="http://www.hillnews.com/thehill/export/TheHill/News/Frontpage/052506/calif.html">Jonathan Kaplan</a> suggests a lower figure and notes the DNCC spent a little down south from where I live:<br />
<blockquote>On May 22, the National Republican Congressional Committee reported having spent $1.1 million on direct mail, phone calls, polling and issue ads to help former Rep. Brian Bilbray (R-Calif.), according to records filed with the Federal Election Commission (FEC). On May 11, the committee reported spending more than $641,000. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee spent $790,000 between May 14 and 20 on television advertising in California’s 50th Congressional District on behalf of Bilbray’s Democratic opponent, Francine Busby.</p></blockquote>
<p>I listened to Bilbray say why he thought he won and as the AP and <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/06/07/primaries.roundup.ap/index.html">CNN</a> put it:<br />
<blockquote>Bilbray made immigration the centerpiece of his campaign, proposing a fence &#8220;from the Pacific Ocean to the Gulf of Mexico&#8221; and restrictions to keep illegal immigrants from collecting Social Security and other benefits.</p></blockquote>
<p>While Bilbray opposes President Bush’s immigration reform – I suspect Karl Rove is happy that hate and fear still represents a winning strategy for certain Republicans.</p>
<p>Note also that AP and CNN put the figures from the national treasures of each party a little higher than what Kaplan suggested.</p>

                                <p>AB read Catcus questions the following claim from NRO’s <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=ZWRjMmQ3MzNmZGE3NzNkNWJhNDkyYjE5MTgxMDgzMmM=">Greg Kaza</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Since Bush took office in January 2001, government jobs have dropped by 51,000 &#8211; nearly 2 percent. That may not look like much, but it is a continuation of a trend that represents a small victory for fiscal conservatives and economic libertarians &#8211; those who support limited government and the philosophical principle of a smaller federal labor force.</p></blockquote>
<p>Catcus points us to <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2007/sheets/hist17z1.xls">OMB table 17.1</a>.  Employment by the Civilian Agencies has increased by more than Department of Defense employment has declined.  So with a Global War on Terror and that idiotic decision to commit troops to invading Iraq, isn’t odd that someone who wants a permanent tax cut is increasing employment by Civilian Agencies but cutting DoD employment?  </p>

<p>So what is Kaza using to back up his claim?</p>
<blockquote><p>The data show that total federal employment peaked under President George H.W. Bush at 3.4 million in May 1990. That number, as measured by the BLS, fell to 3 million by the time Bush the Elder left office … As of the latest jobs report, total federal employment under George W. Bush was 2.7 million in May 2006. That represents a loss of more than one in every five federal employees since 1990.</p></blockquote>
<p>While Kaza does admit that Federal employment fell under Bill Clinton, he fails to note that Federal employment under George W. Bush went up before it went down.  And the small net decline in employment since George W. Bush took office is more than 100% explained by the reduction in employment by the Post Office.  Federal employment not including the Post Office has increased under George W. Bush.</p>
<p><a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/uploaded_images/a2-745680.JPG"><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/uploaded_images/a2-702977.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Kaza wants us to believe that we are more free simply because the Post Office has less employees now than it did when George W. Bush took office.  I don’t know if the reduction in employment at the U.S. Postal Service is from FEDEX, UPS, and DHL gaining market share or whether it’s the postal service becoming more efficient.  As far as freedom, I’d be more concerned what the NSA is doing in terms of wire tapping Aunt Bee and even if they could do so efficiently, a reduction in NSA employment would not translate into an increase in freedom.  As far as DoD employment, Rumsfeld thought he could efficiently fight two wars without increasing the number of troops.  How is that working out?</p>

                                <p><a href="http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/002259.html">Max Sawicky</a> has some fun with a speech by <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/cea/lazear20060602.pdf">Edward Lazear</a> where the CEA chairman said:<br />
<blockquote>To get a sense of why economic growth is so important, look at Figure 1. In Figure 1 the relationship between compensation and productivity is plotted over about a 55-year period. The compensation series used here is called the real product wage, which is a comprehensive measure of total compensation. Although these curves do not line up on a yearly basis, it is quite clear that wages and productivity are highly linked. A related measure of compensation, real after-tax income has also increased substantially, rising by a total of 12.9 percent since January 2001, and $2,140 per person.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, Lazear factored in the current tax cuts without including those deferred tax liabilities (tax shift – not tax cut).  </p>
<p>Max reads the footnotes and writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you check the bottom, you see the deflator used is the &#8220;price index for nonfarm output,&#8221; the result of which is the &#8220;real product wage.&#8221; I had never heard of that before, but I&#8217;m no labor/price index savant. The trick here is that the deflator is for all output, including intermediate goods. The worker, by contrast, is more interested in the prices for the stuff he buys, not for machine tools and electric generators. If you use the Consumer Price Index you get a different picture</p></blockquote>
<p>Max gets into the details, which makes me realize I’m certainly no savant.  But I did some checking over at the source for <a href="http://www.bea.gov/">NIPA tables</a> and found table 1.9.4 – Price Indexes for Net Value Added by Sector, which shows annual data through 2004.  From 2000 to 2004, the general rise in prices was about 10%, which tracked the increase in consumer prices.  For the business sector, prices rose by 7.8% &#8211; but here is where it gets fun.  While the nonfarm price index rose by only 7.4%, the price index for the farm sector rose by over 68%.  So if one does not have to eat – one might have seen an increase in one’s standard of living!</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/04/business/yourmoney/04view.html?_r=1&#038;oref=slogin&#038;pagewanted=print">Daniel Gross</a> has a nice article about all those economic statistics being tossed around by the Bush Pollyannas, which include Rudolph Giuliani:</p>
<blockquote><p>In Iowa last month, Rudolph W. Giuliani bluntly dismissed concerns about the economy and higher gas prices by saying, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what we&#8217;re all so upset about.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I wonder how much Exxon stock is in Giuliani’s portfolio?  It is true that the reported unemployment rate is 4.6% but compare the 63% employment to population ratio now to the 64% plus employment to population ratio during most of Clinton’s second term.  </p>
<p>Gross noted more spin from Treas. Sec. Snow:</p>
<blockquote><p>In addition, aggregates generally are averages, which are of declining utility in an economy characterized by greater inequality of income and assets. In an interview with The Wall Street Journal in March, Mr. Snow took pains to point out that there had been substantial gains in per-capita income (8.2 percent, after inflation) and net worth (24 percent, before inflation) from the beginning of 2001 to the end of 2005. The data he cited were averages, or means, and that can be misleading. &#8220;The average wage is a useful indicator if you want to know what&#8217;s happening to the tax base, but it might not tell you what&#8217;s going on for the individual worker,&#8221; said Alan B. Krueger</p></blockquote>
<p>Rising inequality is a good point but the notion that we are all much wealthier does not hold up under closer analysis.  Let’s remember that per capita wealth at the end of 2005 was about the same as it was at the end of 1999.  And even if we 2001 as the start date, the <a href="http://neweconomist.blogs.com/new_economist/2006/06/mean_median.html">New Economist</a> reminds us that mean growth is not the same as median growth.   The median household saw very little increase in real wealth over this period.</p>
<p>Most of the increases in income have accrued to profits and not real wages.  Real wages for many have fallen with the increase in fringe benefits is largely going to pay for more expensive health insurance premiums.  As far as real GDP growth, real GDP for 2005 was only 13.4% higher than it was for 2000, which represents an average annual growth rate of only 2.55% &#8211; as compared to the 3.7% average growth from 1993 to 2000.  </p>
<p>I know Rudi has appointed himself to be head Bush cheerleading but seriously &#8211; I don&#8217;t know what he is so giddy about?</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Via <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2006/06/waiting_for_a_p.html">Mark Thoma</a> comes <a href="http://users2.wsj.com/lmda/do/checkLogin?mg=wsj-users2&#038;url=http%3A%2F%2Fonline.wsj.com%2Farticle%2FSB114946802518671112.html">Glenn Hubbard</a> that the pie is getting bigger.  As Mark notes, most of us will have to wait for our slice of that yummy pie.  While I might agree with Dr, Hubbard that the formerly expansionary monetary policy was a good thing, I’m a little shocked at his praise for Bush’s fiscal policy:<br />
<blockquote>And tax policy? Investment incentives, lower marginal tax rates and cuts in dividend and capital gains taxes promoted investment at a time when investment decisions faced many headwinds. Are we to believe that higher marginal tax rates would have led to better outcomes for output and employment over the past five years? Should we think that raising taxes on capital income would be an encouraging sign for foreign investors about the U.S. investment climate? </p></blockquote>
<p>Look – had this Administration cut government spending to go along with the reductions in marginal tax rates, he might have a point.  But as the economy is getting closer to full employment, the continued fiscal stimulus is forcing the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates.  Can you say “crowding-out”?</p>

                                <p>Martin Feldstein writes in the WSJ (subscription required): <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB114946588448771080.html">Tradeable Gasoline Rights</a>  </p>
<p>For excerpts, see Dr. Thoma: <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2006/06/tradeable_gas_r.html">Tradeable Gas Rights</a><br />
<blockquote>A far better approach would be a system of tradeable gasoline rights, or TGRs. These could be distributed in a way that actually raises the income of a majority of households while giving everyone an incentive to reduce gasoline consumption. </p>
<p>In a system of tradeable gasoline rights, the government would give each adult a TGR debit card. The gasoline pumps at service stations &#8230; would be modified to read these new TGR debit cards&#8230; Buying a gallon of gasoline would require using up one tradeable gasoline right as well as paying money. </p>
<p>The government would decide how many gallons of gasoline should be consumed per year and would give out that total number of TGRs. In 2006, Americans will buy about 110 billion gallons of gasoline. To keep that total unchanged in 2007, the government would distribute 110 billion TGRs. To reduce total gasoline consumption by 5%, it would cut the number of TGRs to 104.5 billion.<br />&#8230;<br />A key feature of these gasoline rights is that they are tradeable. Individuals with more TGRs than they need could sell the excess, while those who want to use more gallons than their allocation would have to buy extra TGRs.</p></blockquote>
<p> Professor Thoma is open to the idea, but <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2006/06/tradeable_gas_r.html">expresses</a> concern about how politics will intrude on the allocation of TGRs and on the cap.<br />
<blockquote>Would the cap on gasoline usage be as easy to lift as the debt limit? &#8230; [W]ill the credits per person be decided based upon political considerations rather than economics?  This may well be better than other proposals in a lot of dimensions and I am not opposed to it, but unless I missed something on the allocation part, it doesn&#8217;t seem so obvious that it would sail through congress.</p></blockquote>
<p>  Dr. DeLong <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2006/06/marty_feldstein.html">praises</a> the proposal:<br />
<blockquote>I think Marty&#8217;s right. I think it&#8217;s a clever idea&#8211;and much better than tightening CAFE.</p></blockquote>
<p>  I think this idea has merit, so its probably the last we will hear of it.  I&#8217;d suggest allocating the same number of TGRs to all registered drivers and letting the martketplace do its magic.  </p>

                                <p><a href="http://yglesias.tpmcafe.com/node/30416">Matthew</a> reads <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/02/opinion/02morris.html?_r=3&#038;oref=slogin&#038;oref=slogin&#038;oref=slogin">Charles Morris</a> confusing long-term growth with short-term business cycles:<br />
<blockquote>Historians long attributed the turmoil to a &#8220;great depression of the 1870&#8217;s.&#8221; But recent detailed reconstructions of 19th-century data by economic historians show that there was no 1870&#8217;s depression: aside from a short recession in 1873, in fact, the decade saw possibly the fastest sustained growth in American history. Employment grew strongly, faster than the rate of immigration; consumption of food and other goods rose across the board. On a per capita basis, almost all output measures were up spectacularly. By the end of the decade, people were better housed, better clothed and lived on bigger farms. Department stores were popping up even in medium-sized cities. America was transforming into the world&#8217;s first mass consumer society. But why did people feel so miserable? Partly they were confused by prices, which were dropping sharply. Farmers thought falling grain prices meant they were getting poorer, without noticing that the price of everything else was falling too. Farmers&#8217; terms of trade &#8211; the price differences between what they sold and what they bought &#8211; actually racked up solid gains in the 1870&#8217;s.</p></blockquote>
<p>Matthew seems to recall that a recession did occur during the 1870’s, which is not inconsistent with high overall growth for the decade.  We had two recessions during the 1950’s followed by one that began in 1960 &#8211; and yet the economy grew by 40% from 1950 to 1960.  <a href="http://www.nber.org/cycles.html">NBER</a> also argues there was a recession that started in 1873.</p>
<p>Matthew continues:</p>
<blockquote><p>One is that the author says people &#8220;were confused by prices, which were dropping sharply. Farmers thought falling grain prices meant they were getting poorer, without noticing that the price of everything else was falling too.&#8221; First off, I find it a little hard to believe that someone wouldn&#8217;t notice falling prices for the things they buy regularly. It seems like the kind of thing you would notice. But more to the point, how could prices have been falling in the context of rapid economic growth? As we all know, when the Fed decides it wants to reduce inflation (i.e., slow down the growth in prices) it raises interest rates to try and reduce economic growth. That&#8217;s because inflation is connected to growth &#8211; very fast growth leads to inflation. How could rapid growth have been paired with deflation? Perhaps there&#8217;s an answer.</p></blockquote>
<p>Should we suggest that Matthew read Milton Friedman’s “The Role of Monetary Policy: Presidential Address to AEA”, American Economic Review (1968)? Actually, Matthew is challenging the entire premise of adaptive expectations as did the new classical types who emphasized rational expectations.  I never bought into the premise of market clearing models of business cycles anyway.  Just call me an old fashioned Keynesian.  </p>
<p>But back the 1870’s – Matthew might enjoy <a href="http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.cgi?path=31882876520888">The Crisis of 1873</a> by David Glasner as well as the other entries in Business Cycles and Depressions: An Encyclopedia.</p>
<p>Also note that <a href="http://eh.net/hmit/gdp/GDPsource.htm">Economic History Series</a> provides a series that does indicate that real GDP in 1880 was 63% higher than it was in 1870 but they caution:</p>
<blockquote><p>A central point to keep in mind is that the quality of the data deteriorates the farther back in time one goes. The reason for this is simple: GDP data were not collected or even defined before the 1930s and thus any measures for years before 1932 rely on sources that were not collected for the purpose of constructing national income and product accounts.</p></blockquote>

                                <p><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/13124918">Thomas Ricks</a> reports on the coverup of Haditha:<br />
<blockquote>Despite what Marine witnesses saw when they arrived, that official version has been allowed to stand for six months. Who lied about the killings, who knew the truth and what, if anything, they did about it are at the core of one of the potentially most embarrassing and damaging events of the Iraq war, one that some say may surpass the detainee abuse scandal at Abu Ghraib prison &#8230; That same month, a top military official arrived in Iraq who would play a key role in the case: Lt. Gen. Peter W. Chiarelli, the new No. 2 military officer in the country &#8230; Not long after Chiarelli arrived in Baghdad, an Iraqi journalism student gave an Iraqi human rights group a video he had taken in Haditha the day after the incident. It showed the scene at the local morgue and the damage in the houses where the killings took place. The video reached Time magazine, whose reporters began questioning U.S. military officials. Pool, the Marine captain, sent the reporters a dismissive e-mail saying that they were falling for al-Qaeda propaganda, the magazine said recently. &#8220;I cannot believe you&#8217;re buying any of this,&#8221; he wrote. Pool declined last week to comment on any aspect of the Haditha incident. But Army Lt. Col. Barry Johnson, a more senior spokesman in Baghdad, notified Chiarelli of the questions. The general&#8217;s response to his public affairs office was short: Just brief the Time magazine reporter on the military investigation into the incident that Chiarelli assumed had been conducted. The surprising word came back: There had been no investigation. Chiarelli told subordinates in early February he was amazed by that response, according to an Army officer in Iraq. He directed that an inquiry commence as soon as possible. He wanted to know what had happened in Haditha, and also why no investigation had begun &#8230; On March 10, the findings were given to Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and Gen. Peter Pace, the first Marine ever to be chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Rumsfeld told aides that the case promised to be a major problem. He called it &#8220;really, really bad &#8211; as bad or worse than Abu Ghraib,&#8221; recalled one Pentagon official. On March 11, President Bush was informed, according to the White House … The first public indication that the military was taking those allegations seriously came on April 7, when Lt. Col. Jeffrey R. Chessani, a reserved, quietly professional officer from northwestern Colorado, was relieved of command of the 3rd Battalion of the 1st Marines, Kilo Company&#8217;s parent unit. Also removed were two of his subordinates &#8211; Kilo&#8217;s commander, Capt. Luke McConnell, and the commander of another company. Even then, the Marine Corps didn&#8217;t specify why the actions were taken, beyond saying that the officers had lost the confidence of their superiors. Then, on May 17, Rep. John P. Murtha (D-Pa.) let the news slip out. In the middle of a rambling statement at the outset of a news conference on Capitol Hill, he said &#8211; almost as an aside &#8211; that what happened in Haditha was &#8220;much worse than reported in Time magazine.&#8221; He asserted that the investigations would reveal that &#8220;our troops overreacted because of the pressure on them, and they killed innocent civilians in cold blood.&#8221; … The facts of the shooting incident seem now to be largely known, with military insiders saying that recent news articles are similar to the internal reports they have received from investigators. But considerable mystery remains about how Marine commanders handled the incident and contributed to what some officials suspect was a coverup. &#8220;The real issue is how far up the chain of command it goes,&#8221; said one senior Marine familiar with the case. &#8220;Who knew it, and why didn&#8217;t they do something about it?&#8221; The Marine Corps still has not corrected its misleading Nov. 20 statement asserting that the Iraqi civilians were killed in a bomb blast. A Marine Corps spokesman didn&#8217;t return calls on Friday asking why it had not.</p></blockquote>
<p>While I had thought the debate over My Lai was seared in my memory, I learned quite a bit from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Lai_massacre">Wikipedia</a> coverage of the massacre that occurred on March 16, 1968 and the subsequent cover-up.  First, the date – which was before Richard Nixon succeeded Lyndon Johnson.  One of my tenth grade teachers liked to turn his students loose debating the hot topics of the day and when My Lai came up, I was instantly the most unpopular person in class as I tried to argue that the prosecution of Lt. Calley should go forward.  I was not surprised that the hawks generally wanted no investigation – with the notable exception of some William Buckley wannabe who agreed with me on this particular issue (he never agreed with me on anything else).  I was generally surprised that the doves wanted to excuse Calley’s actions as they had blood lust for Nixon.  So how was it that we heard about My Lai only after Nixon become President.  Wikipedia details the cover-up:</p>
<blockquote><p>Henderson interviewed several soldiers involved in the incident, then issued a written report in late April claiming that approximately 22 civilians were inadvertently killed during the military operation in My Lai &#8230; Six months later, a 21-year-old soldier of the 11th Light Infantry (The Butcher&#8217;s Brigade) named Tom Glen wrote a letter accusing the Americal Division (and other entire units of the U.S. military, not just individuals) of routine brutality against Vietnamese civilians; the letter was detailed, its allegations horrifying, and its contents echoed complaints received from other soldiers.</p></blockquote>
<p>Next comes a familiar name – Colin Powell – who was the army major charged with looking into what Glen wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Powell wrote: &#8220;In direct refutation of this portrayal is the fact that relations between American soldiers and the Vietnamese people are excellent.&#8221; Later, Powell&#8217;s refutation would be called an act of &#8220;white-washing&#8221; the news of My Lai, and questions would continue to remain undisclosed to the public.</p></blockquote>
<p>The story continues with a letter from Ron Ridenhour, which he sent in early 1969 to President Nixon, the State Department, the Pentagon, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and several members of Congress. Most recipients of Ridenhour&#8217;s letter ignored it, with the notable exception of Representative Morris Udall.  We also see another interesting name – Seymour Hersch – who wrote a November 12, 1969 article letting the public know of this massacre.  </p>
<p>Some apologists for the Haditha incident are noting that we are not covering-up this massacre in the same fashion that we covered-up My Lai.  But there was an attempt at a cover-up even if this one failed sooner than the cover-up back in the late 1960’s.  Just as Richard Nixon knew about My Lai by March 1969 but did not tell us, George W. Bush knew about Haditha by March 2006 but choose not to tell us.  There were heroes during My Lai and there may be heroes today.  Alas, the President of the United States was not a hero during either incident.</p>
