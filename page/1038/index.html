                                <p><a href="http://kipesquire.powerblogs.com/posts/1122519759.shtml">Kipesquire</a> inquires about the impact on national savings and is concerned that AmeriSave is not fiscally neutral.  His Broken Windows Fallacy raises an important point: if the government lowers my net taxes but not does cut government purchases, there will be an increase in someone else’s net taxes either now or later.  </p>
<p>Kip, however, makes a few gaffes in his critique.  First of all, AmeriSave requires me to cut my consumption by $1000 (save the funds instead) to get the $1000 transfer payment.  But Kip fails to acknowledge this important point.  Kip then goes onto to endorse certain tax breaks for the well to do without applying the same standard of fiscal neutrality.  </p>
<p>While some of his suggestions have merit, this statement shows what is really bothering Kip:</p>
<blockquote><p>This program would only apply to the middle-class and working poor. Which means of course that the overall federal tax system will become even more progressive than it already is, “tax cuts for the wealthy&#8221; notwithstanding.</p></blockquote>
<p>Shame on us liberals for not jumping on the Reverse Robin Hood bandwagon!</p>

                                <p>Did <a href="http://www.socialsecuritychoice.org/archives/2005/07/americantsavebe.php">Jonathan Swanson</a> read <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/07/trying-to-boost-us-saving.html">Kash’s post</a>? He replies with some odd logic:</p>
<blockquote><p>Too bad the solution does not address the Social Security shortfall, nor does it provide a feasible investment strategy for the demographic group it targets &#8230; one can benefit from the wonder of compound interest only when one has disposable income to invest. The demographic group AmeriSave accounts target can’t afford to save in this manner; the glaring deficiency in the Democrats’ proposal is that if low-income Americans could afford to invest in retirement programs like 401(k)s and IRAs, they already would doing so &#8230; AmeriSave accounts presuppose that 1) Social Security benefits are “guaranteed” benefits, and 2) investing a portion of payroll taxes through Personal Retirement Accounts destabilizes the current Social Security system.  This logic is faulty for two reasons. First, Social Security benefits are anything but guaranteed … Secondly, voluntary Personal Retirement Accounts offer retirees a better return on their payroll taxes that the government can never take away.</p></blockquote>
<p>Swanson’s first premise is that after-tax income for some Americans is so low that they choose not to save for retirement.  While this suggestion might be true for some households, the GOP fiscal agenda – including their Social Security agenda – would likely lower the after-tax income of these households. </p>
<p>Swanson’s claim that Social Security benefits are not guaranteed might be a concern if the U.S. Treasury will one day default on its obligations because of the Bush fiscal agenda or never tax, always borrow.  While Donald Luskin often makes this claim, his latest on the <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_luskin/luskin200507270835.asp">yuan issue</a> (also see <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2005/07/one_again_luski.html">Mark Thoma</a>) makes this claim:</p>
<blockquote><p>What Krugman won’t see is that China has chosen to hold U.S. bonds as collateral because they are the highest-quality and lowest-risk securities in the world. That’s why they make such excellent collateral. The fact that China chooses to hold our bonds is proof of our strength and their need to hang on to a piece of it.</p></blockquote>
<p>What the Club for Growth does not seem to understand is that the Trust Fund is also holding Federal bonds, which pay the same interest rate as the bonds held by the Chinese Central Bank and the same rate that would be paid to bonds in those DeMint personal lock boxes.  As I noted in a comment under Mark’s post – Luskin must think the Trust Fund is holding corporate bonds issued by U.S. airline companies.</p>
<p><em><strong>Addendum</strong></em>: Luskin’s use of the word “collateral” is extremely odd.  Consider <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collateral">this definition</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Collateral is a word used for assets that secure a loan. For example, in the case of a mortgage the house serves as the collateral for the mortgage-loan. This way, the bank is secured against the default risk of the borrower not being able to meet the interest payments. In case of default the bank can sell the house and get its money back.</p></blockquote>
<p>The U.S. government wishes to borrow and the Chinese government becomes the lendor.  The Federal bond is the financial instrument that we see as the loan.  It would be odd that the same financial instrument that was the instrument of the loan was also used as the collateral.  Now one could suggest that collateral was not needed as the probability of default was nil.  </p>
<p>While we are on the topic of odd use of financial terminology, consider Luskin’s mentee: Roland Patrick (we know him as Patrick R. Sullivan) and his <a href="http://flyunderthebridge.blogspot.com/2005/07/dollars-and-deficits.html">critique</a> of Krugman:</p>
<blockquote><p>Second, it doesn&#8217;t appear that Krugman grasps the difference between buying dollars and buying bonds.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, Krugman was clearly referring to dollar-denominated bonds.  What was Patrick’s first “point”:</p>
<blockquote><p>First, it&#8217;s an open question what China&#8217;s spending its dollars on oil, Napa Valley wine, Washington state cherries, Boeing airplanes &#8230; </p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, most of us know that China is buying oil from other nations but they are not buying very much in the way of wine, cherries, or even airplanes from our West Coast relative to the amount of goods we buy from China.  A Luskin wannabe should sharpen his knowledge of the data and his ability to understand simple financial terminology before he decides to take on the writings of Dr. Paul Krugman.  </p>
<p>But let’s hope the Chinese decide to purchase more planes from Boeing.  But then as economists advocate a yuan revaluation, we are relying on changes in relative prices to increase Chinese demand for our goods.  Most economists understand this simple point – even if the econopundits at the National Review do not.</p>

<blockquote><p>On Fox a moment ago, liberal radio talk show host Nancy Skinner said that Karl Rove “is endangering our national security” – her short-hand reference to the Wilson/Plame brouhaha. So the left, which is always shouting: “How dare you question my patriotism!” to people who are not questioning their patriotism is now questioning the patriotism of Karl Rove and President Bush. Nice twist. This has become the left’s new refrain and a useful one it is since the left has long been seen by many Americans as not trustworthy on national security.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, Mr. May questions the patriotism of liberals when there is no basis for doing so.  It would seem that he and <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/05_07_24_corner-archive.asp#070993">John Podhoretz</a> want to give us ample reason to question their commitment to national security when it conflicts with their partisan garbage.  I only regret that I was not watching FNC for their reaction to Ms. Skinner’s comment.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>The title of the latest from <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/goldberg/goldberg200507270748.asp">Jonah Goldberg</a> might suggest that he was about to criticize Governor Schwarzenegger.  Alas, this is as far as he goes in criticism:</p>
<blockquote><p>I was against the recall on the grounds that the people of California elected Gray Davis and therefore they deserved to be punished. Seriously. Democracy isn’t merely about “the people” getting what they want, it’s also about the people getting what they deserve. Mobs get what they want every time.</p></blockquote>
<p>At least, this line settled a debate between me and my sensible but Republican wife.  We are planning a trip to vineyards of Northern California – and I had suggested she invite Mr. Goldberg so she did not have to deal with my liberalism on the long trip from Southern California.  But she acted very negatively saying clowns are not allowed in her car.  When I suggested she was being almost mean as he was, she pointed this out:</p>
<blockquote><p>California is doing better now, in part because of Schwarzenegger and in part because the economy has rebounded since 2003.</p></blockquote>
<p>She then asked me as an economist to figure out what actual policies were mentioned in Mr. Goldberg’s op-ed.  Schwarzenegger may have given a speech before the Republican Convention last summer, but the wife noted as she watched it, it was as goofy as Zell Miller’s was insane.  </p>
<p>But why did we replace Gray Davis with Arnold Schwarzenegger?  As I recall, he promised to eliminate the deficit without tax increases or reductions in our commitment to education.  I thought then that this free lunch promise was absurd.  It seems the replacement governor has reduced our commitment to education and yet we still have a deficit – in spite of a recovery that has nothing to do with Schwarzenegger’s policies.  </p>
<p>Maybe we can help the wine country by mailing Mr. Goldberg a few bottles of wine given that the wife refuses to invite him on our trip.  I did say she was a sensible Republican.</p>

                                <p>Congressional Democrats yesterday put forth a proposal to try to boost the US&#8217;s household savings rate, which is extremely low both <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/04/how-low-can-it-go.html">compared to the past</a> and <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/06/international-saving-comparisons.html">compared to other countries</a>.  </p>
<blockquote><p>NEW YORK (<a href="http://money.cnn.com/2005/07/26/retirement/amerisave_plan/">CNN/Money</a>) &#8211; Democratic members of Congress introduced a retirement security plan Tuesday that promises to foster savings among middle- and working-class individuals.  The plan, known as AmeriSave, did not include any proposals regarding changes to Social Security. </p>
<p>&#8230;Under the plan, working and middle class individuals who participate in a retirement savings program such as a 401(k) or an IRA would have the first $1,000 contributed to their account matched by government funds.</p>
<p>Small businesses that do not currently offer retirement accounts for their workers would receive tax credits that would help cover the cost of administrating a retirement plan.</p>
<p>Another major initiative of the AmeriSave plan would be the reformation of bankruptcy and pension laws that would make it more difficult for corporations to dissolve pension plans.</p>
<p>&#8230;Workers would also be able to directly deposit tax refunds into a retirement savings account.</p></blockquote>
<p>I think that something as simple as making monthly retirement plan contributions the default option for all workers could probably have some significantly positive effects on personal savings in the US.  I&#8217;m not sure how expensive these specific Democratic proposals would be, and we&#8217;d need to know that before we could decide how much sense these proposals make.  But it&#8217;s nice to know that someone in Washington is at least throwing out some ideas to address the US&#8217;s low savings rate &#8211; something that I do honestly think is setting the stage for some potentially serious economic problems down the road.</p>

                                <p>Today’s <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2005/07/27/news/international/china_yuan.reut/index.htm">news</a> that the Chinese Central Bank is still managing the value of the yuan is a good excuse to revisit the issue as to whether the yuan is significantly undervalued.  Senator Lindsey Graham has been claimed that the yuan is undervalued by at least 15% and by as much as 40%.  His claim appears to come from the <em>2004 Report to Congress of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission</em> (June 2004).  For example, page 4 of this report reads:</p>
<blockquote><p>A key factor contributing to the U.S. deficit with China is the undervaluation of the Chinese yuan against the U.S. dollar. This gives Chinese manufacturers a competitive advantage over U.S. manufacturers. Economic fundamentals suggest that the Chinese yuan is undervalued, with a growing consensus of economists estimating the level of undervaluation to be anywhere from fifteen to forty percent.</p></blockquote>
<p>In the recent <a href="http://online.wsj.com/public/article/0,,SB112195421057192103,00.htm">Roubini v. Altig</a> debate, Nouriel stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>If China were to liberalize its capital account regime &#8211; on capital inflows as much as on capital outflows &#8211; and stop intervening, the Chinese currency could appreciate by more than 20%, minimum.</p></blockquote>
<p>David replied:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the overall scheme of things, if you put any faith at all in markets&#8217; ability to provide best guesses of such things, the expected magnitude of RMB-appreciation looks pretty moderate. By the last update I received, non-deliverable forward foreign exchange contracts were suggesting a total appreciation of about 8% over the next twelve months. That includes the 2% today. This is up a bit from yesterday, when 6% was the bet, but it still doesn&#8217;t add up to great drama.</p></blockquote>
<p>We shall discuss below why David’s evidence may not be a good measure of how undervalued the yen is.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.rgemonitor.com/blog/setser/9246">Brad Setser</a> has been hinting that I should read <a href="http://ksghome.harvard.edu/~jfrankel/On%20the%20Renminbi.pdf"> On the Renminbi: The choice between adjustment under a fixed exchange rate and adjustment under a flexible rate </a> by Jeff Frankel.  This paper has a very nice discussion of the pros and cons of fixed versus floating exchange rates.  Frankel discusses the Balassa-Samuelson relationship and gives reasons to believe that the yuan is approximately 40% undervalued.  And as I think of David’s forward rate evidence, this comment is intriguing:</p>
<blockquote><p>Few economists would seriously recommend a revaluation over a short period of time of the yuan on the order of magnitude suggested by this interpretation of the Balassa-Samuelson equation. In the first place, a sudden revaluation of the currency of this magnitude would be disruptive. In the second place, other considerations matter in addition to the Balassa-Samuelson regression, including current monetary conditions. </p></blockquote>
<p>David’s forward rate evidence suggests the market’s expectation of yuan appreciation is less than 10%.  Suppose the market assigns a very small probability (say 10%) to the Chinese Central Bank letting the yuan appreciate significantly (say 40%) and a large probability (say 90%) to a modest revaluation (say less than 90%).  David’s evidence would be consistent with the results derived from the Balassa-Samuelson relationship.</p>
<p>With a hat tip to <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2005/07/stiglitz_on_chi.html">Mark Thoma</a>, the recent comments from <br /><a href="http://news.ft.com/cms/s/79797f04-fe00-11d9-a289-00000e2511c8.html">Joseph Stiglitz</a> provide a nice way to close this post.  Stiglitz – like Frankel – provides a good argument why freely floating exchange rates are not necessarily the optimal currency regime.  We can, however, imagine a significant revaluation of the yuan without resorting to a freely floating exchange rate.  For example, the UK Central Bank significantly devalued the pound in 1967 without abandoning Bretton Woods – although this exchange rate regime was abandoned later.  Stiglitz is correct that a yuan revaluation would have only a modest impact on the U.S. current account deficit.  He is also correct to note that this exchange rate issue is just one of many policy considerations facing both China and the U.S.</p>
<p><em>Update</em>: Is <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_luskin/luskin200507270835.asp">Donald Luskin</a> trying to deny the premise that the Chinese Central Bank is pegging the yuan/$ exchange rate?  If so, he truly is clueless.  If not, could someone explain to me what his latest rant is all about?</p>
<p><em>Update II</em>: I left out the how fast and how far debate – but it seems that <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/23/business/worldbusiness/23dollar.html?adxnnl=1&#038;pagewanted=print&#038;adxnnlx=1122491151-3ZwJqEUmg1UjW8X623UtqQ">Louis Uchitelle</a> had already filled this void (with hat tip to Brad DeLong).</p>
<p><em>Update III</em>: <a href="http://macroblog.typepad.com/macroblog/2005/07/laying_the_foun.html">David Altig</a> adds to the discussion.  As you might tell from my comment to his post, I agree with his latest.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.atrios.blogspot.com/">Duncan Black</a> (see Dance PNAC Monkey Dance) catches <a href="http://weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/005/883raiiu.asp">Gary Schmitt</a> sliming Larry Johnson.  We noted how <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/07/plamegate-former-cia-agents-before.html">Ramesh Ponnunu</a> also accused Mr. Johnson of being a Democratic partisan.  <a href="http://www.tpmcafe.com/author/yglesias">Matthew Yglesias</a> places Schmitt v. Johnson in its proper context:</p>
<blockquote><p>This is &#8220;slime and defend&#8221; at its best. Joe Wilson said some stuff that was politically inconvenient for the White House. So the White House had to say some mean stuff about him. His wife got him his job. He was unqualified. If that entailed blowing a CIA operative&#8217;s cover, that&#8217;s no big deal. But now you need to slime his wife. She wasn&#8217;t really undercover. The Director of Central Intelligence, the Justice Department, a special prosecutor, and a whole series of federal judges are just confused, I guess. Now Johnson comes along and says the right is making stuff up, so it&#8217;s time to go after him. Simple as that. Now everyone&#8217;s put on notice &#8212; make trouble for the White House and they&#8217;ll come gunning for you.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2005_07/006798.php">Kevin Drum</a> provides further insight into the motivations of the Washington Republicans:</p>
<blockquote><p>But we&#8217;ve learned one thing already: when presented with even a hint of evidence that someone on their team has treated national security with cavalier disdain, conservative concern with national security gets thrown overboard without a second thought.</p></blockquote>
<p>Kevin may be right about the “conservatives” at Fox News, the National Review, and the Weekly Standard as well as the Washington Republicans.  Let’s hope the rank-and-file Republicans are more like Larry Johnson.</p>

                                <p>The gold bugs over at the National Review have been arguing against letting the yuan float.  <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2005/07/pegged_to_an_ol.html">Mark Thoma</a> provides one review of <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/kudlow/kudlow200507221419.asp">Lawrence Kudlow</a> as Mark points to Milton Friedman as a proponent of currency stability.  Friedman is also seen as a proponent of floating exchange rates and his recent comments point out that fixed exchange rate are neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for low and stable inflation rates.  </p>
<p>Kudlow was reflecting on <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/22/business/worldbusiness/22assess.html">Saying Goodbye to Mr. Greenspan</a> by Keith Bradsher:</p>
<blockquote><p>Bradsher also writes that China’s tight peg of the yuan to the dollar, which has been the case for more than a decade, generated “impressive stability [that] helped prompt business executives and entrepreneurs from around the world to invest $60 billion a year in new factories and other operations in China. These investors were confident that they knew what those businesses and their exports would be worth in dollars.”</p></blockquote>
<p>I have previously expressed <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/07/exporting-gold-bugs-to-china.html">my doubts</a> that the Chinese Central Bank has been following the lead of Mr. Greenspan, but read the <a href="http://www.pbc.gov.cn/english/detail.asp?col=6620&#038;ID=12">China Monetary Policy Report: 2003</a> and judge for yourself:</p>
<blockquote><p>Broad money M2 grew by 19.6 percent to RMB22.1 trillion yuan at the end of 2003.</p></blockquote>
<p>Kudlow seems to be suggesting that a fixed exchange rate regime leads to less business risk.  Friedman’s point seems to be akin to saying that nominal exchange rate certainty is not the same a real exchange rate certainty.  I would suspect most financial economists would further argue that real exchange rate variability plays at best a modest role in accessing the overall systematic risk facing any particular enterprise.  Given the opening of international markets and the low cost of labor in China, one might wonder why there is not much more foreign investment in China as high expected returns would tend to compensate for a modest amount of systematic risk.  Of course, one could argue that there are substantial political risks in investing in enterprises in the People’s Republic of China.  </p>
<p>If Kudlow thinks $60 billion of investment is a substantial contributor to China’s growth rate, I’d suggest he compare this figure to China’s overall economy and investment.  <a href="http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/ch.html#Econ">This source</a>, for example, puts China’s GDP at $7262 billion and its overall investment at 46% of GDP.  Foreign investment is therefore about 2% of total investment.  Furthermore, China is running a current accounts surplus, which means China’s national savings exceeds its domestic investment.  In other words, China is doing more investment in foreign assets than foreigners are investing in Chinese assets.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_comment/tamny200507260859.asp">John Tamny</a> suggests that dollar devaluations have historically not increased U.S. net exports:</p>
<blockquote><p>Indeed, conventional wisdom 20 years ago argued that a weaker dollar would reduce Japan’s trade surplus with the U.S., and along the lines of Ip’s thinking, push the “global economy closer toward balance.” The “experts” in the ’80s hadn’t done their homework. Just as major dollar devaluation in the 1970s failed to reduce our trade deficit, the deflation forced on Japan in 1985 similarly failed to reduce our trade “imbalance” &#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>Let’s remember that the period from 1985 to 1989 was one of strong economic growth for the U.S. (in my view, reversing the weak aggregate demand growth during the first half of the 1980’s) so it is not surprising that import demand continued to rise.  What Tamny fails to mention is the fact that export demand growth was also very high.  As shares of GDP, exports were 7.2% of U.S. income in 1985 as opposed to an import share equal to 9.9%.  He is correct to suggest that the import share rose over the next two years faster than the export share with imports being 10.8% of GDP and exports being 7.7% of GDP.  The import share rose to 10.8% by 1989, while the export share rose to 9.2%.  In other words, net exports did increase by 1989.  </p>
<p>But Tamny has to support the National Review’s gold bug drive by misrepresenting what the evidence says.  </p>

Gonzalez had trouble with Bob Scheiffer’s questions on Face the Nation:</p>
<blockquote><p>SCHIEFFER: Let me just ask you the obvious question, Mr. Attorney General. Did you tell anybody at the White House, get ready for this, here it comes?<br />GONZALES: I, I told one person, ah, in, in the White House of, of the notification, and, and <br />SCHIEFFER: Who?<br />GONZALES: and immediately &#8211; ah, I told the chief of staff. And immediately the next morning, I told the President and, shortly thereafter, there was a notification sent out to all the members of the White House staff. </p></blockquote>
<p>While Gonzales claims the Justice Department gave him permission for this delay, <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2005/07/25/gonzales-excuse">Thinkprogress</a> also points out that Karl Rove’s friend John Aschroft headed the Justice Department at that time and did not recuse himself from PlameGate until at the end of the year.  </p>
<p><strong>So why didn’t President Bush make sure that a special prosecutor was appointed on July 15, 2003? </strong></p>

One line which puzzled our readers was:</p>
<blockquote><p>Labor compensation is growing above a 7 percent annual rate while aggregate hours worked are rising at a rate consistent with 4 percent real GDP growth.</p></blockquote>
<p>Forgive me for thinking that Mr. Darda was referring to the growth compensation per hour as he was also touting how the number of hours grew.  Our readers are smart enough to realize that the nominal growth rate in total compensation has been nowhere near 7% per year – and it does seem that Mr. Darda was not referring to compensation per hour after all.  I would say that it would help if the NRO econopundits were clear with their definitions and their sources of data, but then I’d be forgetting the essential ingredient for getting Rich Lowry to allow one to publish at NRO – which is that one is supposed to present distortions to their readers.  </p>
<p>Looking at BEA’s <a href="http://www.bea.doc.gov/bea/dn/nipaweb/SelectTable.asp?Selected=N"> Table 1.12: National Income by Type of Income</a>, it does turn out that nominal labor compensation is rising by around 7% per year, but why would anyone compare this nominal growth to the growth rate of real GDP?  Does Mr. Darda not realize that inflation is above zero?</p>
<p>Our chart shows the ratio of labor compensation to national income since 1998.  Our readers know that the labor share of income has fallen.  I guess Mr. Lowry and his econopundits don’t want NRO readers to know this.</p>
