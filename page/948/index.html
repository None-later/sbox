                                                                    </div>

                                <p>I figured I’d take a break from tax issues and talk about the issue of the day… namely the war(s).  These days, many are questioning the competence of the civilian leadership, and perhaps even of the military personnel they have elevated to do the day to day running of the war.  Its always tough to evaluate military campaigns for a number of reasons, including the fact that much of the information needed to do so is classified, and most of us lack even rudimentary military knowledge.</p>
<p>“The amateur talks about strategy, the professional talks about logistics.” </p>
<p>Recently, I stumbled across a table on <a href="http://siadapp.dior.whs.mil/personnel/CASUALTY/Death_Rates1.pdf"> “US Active Duty Military Deaths per 100,000 Serving”</a> for the years 1980 through 2004, and I started thinking about Omar Bradlye’s old dictum:  “The amateur talks about strategy, the professional talks about logistics.”  I started to think – perhaps one difference between amateurs and professionals is that professionals might pay attention to the kinds of things that lead to increased non-combat deaths, whereas amateurs would be unaware of those factors at all. </p>
<p>Let us consider four types of non-combat deaths shown on the table:  accident, homicide, illness, and self-inflicted.  Arguably, accident and illness are the two forms of death that those in charge could influence most easily.  Investing in equipment and training can reduce accidents, and investing in quality medical care and medical training can reduce death by illness.  Death by homicide, by contrast, can be due directly to the behavior of non-military personnel.  Self-inflicted deaths can also, sometimes, be attributed to stresses of life outside the (military) job.</p>
<p>Below are the death rates per 100,000 for active duty military personnel for these four causes for several non-random years.</p>
<p>______Accident__Homicide__Illness__Self-Inflicted<br />1980___72.0______8.1______19.4_____10.7<br />1988___46.8______3.9______13.9_____12.3<br />1992___34.6______5.6______12.9_____12.2<br />2000___26.0______2.2_______9.0______9.9</p>
<p>It seems that from 1980 to 2000, the accidental death rate dropped precipitously (it would have been nice to see data from before 1980) from 1980 to 2000.  Death by illness also shows a similar, although less precipitous drop, perhaps because it was never as high as the accidental death rate to begin with.  Homicides tended to drop over time, although not hugely, and self-inflicted deaths didn’t seem to show much of a pattern.</p>
<p>The obvious conclusion is that during the Reagan, GHW Bush, and Clinton administrations, there tended to be competent people in charge of watching out for the men and women in uniform.</p>
<p>The table above is repeated for four additionally non-randomly chosen years.</p>
<p>______Accident__Homicide__Illness__Self-Inflicted<br />2001___28.2______3.2______11.9______9.0<br />2002___33.6______3.1______11.7______9.8<br />2003___32.3______2.4______13.4_____11.4<br />2004___33.0______2.3______14.7______7.4</p>
<p>The accident rate is no longer dropping, and seems to be climbing slightly, as are deaths by illness.  Deaths by non-combat homicide continue to drop – perhaps by moving so many military personnel out of the country, their likelihood of being murdered falls.  (Also, some percentage of murdered military personnel are the victims of other military personnel – perhaps those few that are potential perpetrators, in a combat situation, find ways of satisfying whatever is in them that do not push up homicide statistics.)  Self-inflicted deaths show no pattern.  Death by illness appears to be on the rise – by 2003 it was at 1988 levels and climbing. </p>
<p>So what is going on?  Perhaps its merely happenstance.  Or perhaps accident and illness rates had somehow gone below their “natural” level by the late 1990s, and that the figures are reverting to these natural rates.  Or maybe (as is often the case to hear some tell it) this is Clinton’s fault – he underinvested in the military, and somehow the pigeons held off on roosting until he left office.  Or it is possible that this just has to do with growing pains – GW has increased the number of military personnel since taking office, but then, so did Reagan, and accident and illness rates dropped under Reagan. </p>
<p>Each of these explanations seems to rely on coincidence.  A more likely explanation is that some deaths that might otherwise be attributed to combat are now being attributed to other (currently less unpalatable) causes.  Another is that the folks making the decisions are not as competent as their predecessors in the three most recent administrations.  Are there any others?</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>As I was watching <a href="http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0609/26/cnr.01.html">CNN Newsroom</a>, I started wondering if Jamie McIntyre was interviewing for a position at Faux News or about to write something for the National Review:<br />
<blockquote>MCINTYRE: If nothing else, the debate over President Clinton&#8217;s spirited defense shows the conclusion is debatable. Officially, the White House is staying out of it. Spokesman Tony Snow, a former Fox News commentator, quipped “he retorts, you decide”.</p></blockquote>
<p>McIntyre’s attempt to fact check what Clinton said to Chris Wallace showed lots of items that basically confirmed what Clinton had said – and yet McIntyre spins these items as if they challenged what Clinton factually noted?  <br />This pathetic excuse for journalism was preceded by:</p>
<blockquote><p>HARRIS: Hold on, Mr. President. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice challenging President Bush&#8217;s predecessor. As you may have seen in a weekend interview, Bill Clinton fired angry accusations against the Bush White House. He says the administration didn&#8217;t actively pursue al Qaeda until after the 9/11 attacks. And that he even left the Bush team a comprehensive strategy on terrorism.Rice adamantly rejected that in an interview with &#8220;The New York Post.&#8221; Right counters, &#8220;but what we did in the eight months was at least as aggressive at what the Clinton administration did in the preceding years. We were not left a comprehensive strategy to fight al Qaeda.&#8221; One board member asked, &#8220;so you&#8217;re saying Bill Clinton is a liar?&#8221; Rice&#8217;s response, &#8220;no, I&#8217;m just saying that, look, there was a lot of passion in that interview and I&#8217;m not going to &#8211; I would just suggest that you go back and read the 9/11 Commission report on the efforts of the Bush administration in the eight months.&#8221; There you have it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Rice’s interview can be found <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2006/73107.htm">here</a>. She is certainly at odds with President Clinton on two matters.   As far as the efforts of the Bush Administration before 9/11, only one thing comes to my mind – her presentation of the DeLenda Plan to President Bush on September 4, 2001.  This was the plan that Sandy Berger presented to her on December 20, 2000 and that Richard Clarke discussed with her on January 25, 2001.  Of course, Dr. Rice denied ever hearing of this plan when she testified before the 9/11 commission.  So – no, Bill Clinton did not lie.  The liar is Dr. Rice. </p>

<p>National Review’s <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=YTQzMDJhYzgyZTA3ODQzODQ4NDdmMDU5NTEzOGJhYzE=">John Miller</a> reads this and writes:<br />
<blockquote>This really ought to encourage conservatives who are wondering whether they should bother to vote in November</p></blockquote>
<p>A few comments: </p>
<p>(1) Riedl is talking about nominal spending increases and is not inflation-adjusted.</p>
<p>(2) Nominal Federal spending grew by 9.86% in 1992.</p>
<p>(3) While nominal Federal spending grew by only 3.24% per year during Clinton’s eight years, nominal Federal spending grew by 6.5% per year over the past five years when Republicans dominated the Federal government.  </p>
<p>Alas, we are stuck with George W. Bush as President, so maybe Mr. Miller is saying that fiscal conservatives should end Dennis Hastert reign as Speaker of the House by voting for Democrats in November.</p>

                                <p>Before yesterday, I had no idea who <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/09/23/Dems.radio.ap/index.html">Ed Perlmutter</a> was, but I like his style: <br />
<blockquote>Republicans will revive their effort to overhaul Social Security after the November elections, a &#8220;dangerous&#8221; plan that would cut benefits to older Americans, the Democratic candidate for a Denver-area House seat said Saturday. &#8220;We can and must stop them &#8211; right now, before it&#8217;s too late,&#8221; Ed Perlmutter said in the Democrats&#8217; weekly radio address. &#8220;Just last year, Democrats stood up to President Bush and the Republicans in Congress, and fought back against this dangerous proposal and defeated it.&#8221; &#8230; Bush and many Republicans say Social Security is in danger of going bankrupt. The president promoted a complete overhaul last year, proposing private investment accounts for younger workers. The idea died after Democrats attacked the program as a hidden effort to cut future benefits. Perlmutter lodged a similar attack Saturday, arguing that the Republican plan would &#8220;threaten senior citizens who worked hard, played by the rules and simply seek to live their golden years with some financial stability and security.&#8221; Instead of looking out for taxpayers&#8217; interests, Republicans &#8220;are sending billions of dollars to special interests in giveaways that taxpayers are paying for,&#8221; he said. &#8230; Perlmutter, 53, has made Social Security a key issue in his race because his opponent, O&#8217;Donnell, wrote a paper in 1995 that advocated &#8220;slaying&#8221; the benefits program.</p></blockquote>
<p>Mr. O’Donnell is a lot like George W. Bush.  During the 2004 campaign, we did not hear a peep about Bush’s desire to undermine the Social Security system, but as soon as he was inaugurated for his second term – it was full steam ahead.  As we come up on the 2006 elections, Republicans are ducking this issue leaving it to Democrats like Perlmutter to bring it up.  </p>
<p>When Republicans talk about bankruptcy, there are deliberately confusing the issue.  While the Social Security Trust Fund is accumulating assets, the General Fund is on a bankruptcy path – due to tax cuts for the wealthy and pork barrel spending for the special interests who donate to GOP campaigns.  President Bush does have a plan to alleviate the General Fund fiasco – which is to cut your Social Security benefits by more than he reduces your payroll contributions.</p>
<p>The claim is that privatization will make you better off as you can get a better return on stocks than you can on government bonds.  Maybe the expected return to stocks is higher than the risk-free rate, but that is only the compensation for bearing risk.  We have noted how conservative economists like <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/03/two-conservative-economists-question.html">Robert Barro</a> and <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/03/privatization-becker-v-snow-dead.html">Gary Becker</a> dismiss the Cato free lunch claim.  </p>
<p>President Bush’s latest is that we take Federal bonds out of the Social Security Trust Fund and give them to you so that you can earn a risk-free higher return on the Federal bonds in your portfolio.  The return you’d get now is about <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h15/data/Weekly_Friday_/H15_TCMNOM_Y20.txt">five percent</a>, which is the return the Trust Fund would get.  So tell me &#8211; how five percent is greater than five percent?</p>

                                <p>If one has not been convinced by now that Fox “News” is nothing more than a GOP propaganda machine, check out the coverage of when <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2006/09/22/clinton-fox">Chris Wallace</a> tried to slander Bill Clinton as ably presented by Judd at <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2006/09/23/fox-clinton-promo">ThinkProgress</a>.  Chris Wallace wants to pretend he’s gone after <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2006/09/23/wallace-cole">Dick Cheney</a> and <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2006/09/23/wallace-rice-pdb">Condi Rice</a> but that’s not true.  I wonder how <a href="http://www.newsmax.com/archives/ic/2005/12/11/100751.shtml">Mike Wallace</a> feels about his dishonest son who masquerades as a journalist but is really a partisan hack.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://www.firedoglake.com/2006/09/22/i-call-bullshit-2/#more-4622">Jane Hamsher</a> have evidence that Chris Matthews was only following a coordinated GOP smear campaign on the Clinton years including this <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/glogin?URI=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/22/us/politics/22bush.html&#038;OQ=_rQ3D1Q26pagewantedQ3Dprint&#038;OP=3c7018cfQ2F41Br4a@Gpj@@bu4uiiQ5B4iQ2A4uu4Q3Cp4n@7Q2FbQ2FGp4uurQ3Cp-Q51-bk7">“laffer”</a>: <br />
<blockquote>President Bush asserted that if Democrats won control of Congress from Republicans it would mean higher taxes and damage to the economy.</p></blockquote>
<p>The free lunch supply-siders suggested that the 1993 tax increase would slow long-run growth, but they were wrong as average annual real GDP growth during the Clinton years was 3.7%.  The same crowd is telling to tell us all those Bush tax cuts have increased growth even that average annual real GDP growth during the Bush years so far is around 2.6%.  What is it with George W. Bush and this issue – stupidity or mendacity?</p>
<p><strong>Update II</strong>: <a href="http://www.crooksandliars.com/2006/09/23/fox-news-saying-clinton-gets-crazed">Crooks and Liars</a> has more proof that Chris Wallace is a liar.  Among other things – in the past interview recap where Wallace says Clinton went off, Wallace claims that Clinton brought up Somalia and the Cole but in <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/clinton-interview">his opening question</a>, here is Mr. Wallace bringing both topics up: <br />
<blockquote>There’s a new book out which I suspect you’ve read called the Looming Tower. And it talks about how the fact that when you pulled troops out of Somalia in 1993, Bin Laden said I have seen the frailty and the weakness and the cowardice of US troops. Then there was the bombing of the embassies in Africa and the attack on the USS Cole.</p></blockquote>
<p>Speaking of liars &#8211; <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=OGRiMzU5OWE1ZGYzOGQzY2I0ZGRhNzU1YmRlOGZlZWM=">Byron York</a> promises a few of his own:<br />
<blockquote>Clinton&#8217;s answers raise many points that call for answers.  More tomorrow.</p></blockquote>
<p>Stay tuned!</p>
<p>Update III: <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=MDM4N2E1MzU5ZjQ0YTA3YmJiYzEyYjQ2ZDBiNWJlYjE=">Byron York</a> utterly fails to deliver:</p>
<blockquote><p>Judging by Clarke’s sympathetic account -as well as by the sympathetic accounts of other former Clinton aides like Daniel Benjamin and Steven Simon -it’s not quite accurate to say that Clinton tried to kill bin Laden. Rather, he tried to convince &#8211; as opposed to, say, order U.S. military and intelligence agencies to kill bin Laden.</p></blockquote>
<p>What – the President was supposed to fire the gun personally? York suggests these agencies did not try to carry out the President’s order and that Clinton “gave up”.  That’s a lie, which York tries to support with this misrepresentation of history: </p>
<blockquote><p>Examples are all over Clarke’s book. On page 223, Clarke describes a meeting, in late 2000, of the National Security Council “principals” &#8211; among them, the heads of the CIA, the FBI, the Attorney General, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the secretaries of State, Defense. It was just after al Qaeda’s attack on the USS Cole. But neither the FBI nor the CIA would say that al Qaeda was behind the bombing, and there was little support for a retaliatory strike.</p></blockquote>
<p>The CIA and FBI did confirm to President Bush in early 2001 that Al Qaeda hit the Cole.  By then, Clinton’s power was turned over to Bush – who failed to act.  And Bush failed to having meetings of the principals.  </p>
<p>York’s goal was to show Clinton was a wimp per Al Qaeda.  What he delivers is more evidence that Bush was the wimp.</p>

<blockquote>Now harvest time has passed and tons of pears have ripened to mush on their branches, while the ground of Mr. Ivicevich’s orchard reeks with rotting fruit. He and other growers in Lake County, about 90 miles north of San Francisco, could not find enough pickers. Stepped-up border enforcement kept many illegal Mexican migrant workers out of California this year, farmers and labor contractors said, putting new strains on the state’s shrinking seasonal farm labor force. Labor shortages have also been reported by apple growers in Washington and upstate New York. Growers have gone from frustrated to furious with Congress, which has all but given up on passing legislation this year to create an agricultural guest-worker program. Last week, 300 growers representing every major agricultural state rallied on the front lawn of the Capitol carrying baskets of fruit to express their ire. This year’s shortages are compounding a flight from the fields by Mexican workers already in the United States. As it has become harder to get into this country, many illegal immigrants have been reluctant to return to Mexico in the off-season. Remaining here year-round, they have gravitated toward more stable jobs. “When you’re having to pay housing costs, it’s very difficult to survive and wait for the next agricultural season to come around,” said Jack King, head of national affairs for the California Farm Bureau Federation … For years, economists say, California farmers have been losing their pickers to less strenuous, more stable and sometimes higher-paying jobs in construction, landscaping and tourism. “If you want another low-wage job, you can work in a hotel and not die in the heat,” said Marc Grossman, the spokesman for the United Farm Workers of America. The union calculates that up to 15 percent of California’s farm labor force leaves agriculture each year. As they sum up this season’s losses, estimated to be at least $10 million for California pear farmers alone, growers in the state mainly blame Republican lawmakers in Washington for stalling immigration legislation that would have addressed the shortage by authorizing a guest-worker program for agriculture. Many growers, a dependably Republican group, said they felt betrayed &#8230; Some economists and advocates for farm workers say the labor shortages would ease if farmers would pay more. Lake County growers said that pickers’ pay was not low &#8211; up to $150 a day &#8211; and that they had been ready to pay even more to save their crops. “I would have raised my wages,” said Steve Winant, a pear grower whose 14-acre orchard is still laden with overripe fruit. “But there weren’t any people to pay.”</p></blockquote>
<p>While I may be in favor of easing immigration restrictions, what is wrong with the market solution to a labor shortage, that is, increasing wages?</p>

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Until recently, I did the adjunct professor thing at an MBA program at a business school in the Los Angeles area – I taught the first year sequence in economics, and an elective advanced statistics class.  Once a quarter, I was expected to talk to my class about ethics.  Its something I always had a hard time doing – I’ve always been under the impression (if someone else has said this before, forgive me, if not, I’ll be happy to claim this as “cactus’ 1st law”) that those who talk a lot about ethics, morality, or patriotism generally have none. </p>
<p>Maybe its my impression, maybe I’m getting older, but for whatever reason, I’ve gotten the impression that people in this country have been doing a lot more talking about those three topics over the past few decades.  This post is an attempt to measure whether that impression is true, in the context of taxes.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/%3Ca%20href=">http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/09/enforcement-and-who-pays-taxes.html</a>&#8220;> My last post  covered tax enforcement.  The post showed that, for the period from 1988 to 2003, the greater the share of the budget going to the Treasury Department, the greater the share of the total individual income taxes paid by the top 1% and 5% of income earners.  In other words, as enforcement increases, those with more discretion in calculating the taxes they owe end up paying more of it.</p>
<p>A more direct measure of the government’s willingness to enforce tax laws is the <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/%3Ca%20href=">http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/05db31ps.xls</a>&#8220;> IRS’ operating budget  as a share of the total federal budget <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/%3Ca%20href=">http://www.bea.gov/bea/dn/nipaweb/TableView.asp#Mid</a>&#8220;> (NIPA Table 1.1.5) . </p>
<p>This can be compared to the amount of <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/%3Ca%20href=">http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/05db07co.xls</a>&#8220;> corporate, individual, employment, estate, gift, and excise taxes  as a percentage of GDP.  Presumably, if Americans are becoming less honest with respect to their taxes, over time we would expect to see, over time, a greater degree of correlation between enforcement and amount paid, especially in those types of taxes of taxes in which cheating is easiest.</p>
<p>Without running any numbers, I would guess taxes, ranked in order of ease of cheating, look like:</p>
<p>1.  Corporate – consider transfer pricing and any number of other gimmicks<br />2.  Individual – easy to cheat at for high income folks, not so easy for wage earners<br />3.  Excise taxes – phantom sales<br />4.  Estate taxes – easy to cheat on, but due to other requirements (namely, a death), may be lumpy and thus slightly less related to time<br />5.  Gift taxes – easy to cheat on, but why not simply place give the giftee a “consulting” fee?<br />6.  Employment taxes – hardest to cheat, since it requires the connivance (or at least the bamboozling) of the employees as well as the government.</p>
<p>The table below shows the correlation over four decades between the IRS operating budget and corporate, individual, and excise taxes as a percentage of GDP.</p>
<p>__________Corporate_____Individual____Excise<br />1971-1980___-0.24________-0.23________-0.56<br />1981-1990____0.13________-0.42________-0.86<br />1991-2000____0.67_________0.36________0.56<br />2000-2004____0.84_________0.93________1.00</p>
<p>Clearly, over time, the correlation between corporate taxes and the IRS budget is increasing quickly over time.  The greater the IRS budget, the more corporations pay in taxes, in general.  The same seems to be true of individual and excise taxes, albeit each of these has one hiccup along the way in the 1980s.  (As per my earlier post on taxes, focusing on the relationship between high income individuals’ taxes and the IRS budget would probably show stronger results.)</p>
<p>The next table shows</p>
<p>__________Estate_____Gift____Employment<br />1971-1980___-0.36________-0.06________-0.05<br />1981-1990___-0.60_________0.78_________0.86<br />1991-2000____0.66_________0.24________-0.36<br />2000-2004____0.86_________0.92________0.68</p>
<p>As with individual and excise taxes, estate taxes do seem to be getting more correlated with the IRS budget, with the exception of the 1980s.  Gift taxes also seem to be showing more correlation over time, but the relationship is weak.  As to employment taxes, it is very hard to reach much of a conclusion.</p>
<p>Thus, it seems that many taxpayers, corporate and individual, are deciding how much to pay in taxes in large part based on much funding the IRS receives.  Put another way, over time Americans have become less likely to be honest with their taxes without threat of punishment.</p>
<p>And if you’re wondering…. the IRS’ share of the budget hit a maximum of 1.48% in 1999.  In 2005, it was down to 1.14%.</p>

                                <p>Jacob Hacker&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Great-Risk-Shift-American-Retirement-/dp/0195179501/sr=1-2/qid=1158871294/ref=sr_1_2/103-0298720-0218229?ie=UTF8&#038;s=books">The Great Risk Shift</a> was reviewed by <a href="http://www.opinionjournal.com/la/?id=110008971">Brink Lindsey</a> who writes:<br />
<blockquote>Mr. Hacker leans heavily on his findings that fluctuations in family income are much greater now than in the 1970s. But research by economists Dirk Krueger and Fabrizio Perri has shown that big increases in the dispersion of income have not translated into equivalent increases in consumption inequality. In other words, most Americans are able to use savings and borrowing to maintain stable living standards even in the face of economic ups and downs.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2006_09/009544.php">Kevin Drum</a> has an excellent critique of Lindsey’s review, which includes this gem:<br />
<blockquote>Hooray! Life is riskier for today&#8217;s family&#8217;s, but they manage to eke out a bit of stability anyway by maxing out their credit cards and spending down the money in their retirement accounts.</p></blockquote>
<p>Kevin has a very different interpretation of the evidence than the one offered by Brink Lindsey.  But didn’t <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/08/does-income-inequality-lead-to.html">we review</a> the paper by Dirk Krueger and Fabrizio Perri as well as a related paper?<br />
<blockquote>the observed rise in household debt relative to income over the past 30 years is attributable to rising income inequality. Iacoviello’s model predicts that consumption inequality grows less than proportionally as income inequality grows, while wealth inequality grows more than proportionally. Examining the distribution of current consumption misses the point that living standards should be gauged across individual’s lifetimes. While the very wealthy have ample resources for old age retirement, the evidence suggests that the working poor may not – unless we retain the Social Security Trust Fund as a vehicle to supplement their retirement benefits.</p></blockquote>
<p>It seems our review of what these two papers have to say is more consistent with Kevin’s view.</p>

<blockquote>He also questions the use of the median rather than the mean to measure changes in income over time which not a productive avenue to follow as the median is generally accepted as the better measure.</p></blockquote>
<p>I was so stunned at the possibility that even a National Review nitwit would use the change in mean income in a discussion of income dispersion that I had to go check what Nugent said.  While he was not precisely saying we should look at the mean, what he said was even worse:</p>
<blockquote><p>Some of Krugman’s inequality cohorts prefer to use median or average family income in presenting their arguments. But what further undermines any of these positions is that we have added millions of people to the list of employed, most of whom are at the lower end of the income scale. Being a math major, such additions would tell me that the traditional “average” income level would fall. Seven million new workers are better off than if they didn’t have a job. How do the redistributionists argue against that economic gain?</p></blockquote>
<p>Nugent was a math major?  Surprising given some of his very odd writing.  But let’s suppose we did have normal employment growth (I’ll forgive the comment that “we have added millions of people to the list of employed” as one cannot write for Rich Lowry if one actually understands the dismal labor market performance over the past five and a half years).  Wouldn’t the normal “a rising tide lift all boats” argument that we often hear from the Bush cheerleaders (OK, the reality is that we have a shallow pool supporting only yachts but bear with me) suggest that last generation’s young’uns have become this generation’s managers etc.  Which would mean income distribution would not have widened.  </p>
<p>But it has.  Nugent is basically telling the working class married fellow that he should be elated to have an always low wages Wal Mart job as the alternative is massive unemployment.  I realize that the macroeconomic performance of this Administration basically sucked – but I never thought I’d see such a graphic statement of this reality from one of those Bush cheerleaders at the National Review.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=Y2QwNmU0OWI4ZTdjYmQyNmZiZmRlNDhmMGMzZmMyZGU=">Phil Kerpen</a> writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>The capital-gains tax can be thought of as two different taxes: a tax on real increases in asset values and a tax on nominal, inflationary increases in asset values. That inflation tax, levied on the phantom gains in asset values due to inflation, is one of the most unfair and economically destructive taxes the federal government levies. With inflation having nudged upward of late, there is a renewed urgency to repeal the tax.</p></blockquote>
<p>This type of incomplete analysis is common.  Might I suggest Mr. Kerpen ponder the 1975 Economic Inquiry paper by Michael Darby entitled The Financial and Tax effects of Monetary Policy on Interest Rates where he introduced the effect of taxes on the size of the Fisher effect – suggesting that that nominal interest rates should increase by more than the increase in expected inflation to compensate borrowers for a lower after-tax return since interest income is usually taxed as ordinary income. </p>
<p>As an example, suppose I borrow $100 from you with the intent of paying you a 4% real return before taxes.  Let’s also assume we both have the same tax rate (t) equal to 20%.  If inflation is zero, I pay you $4 per year and you pay the government $0.80 per year and thereby get a real return after taxes equal to $3.20.  We’ll also assume my interest expense is deductible so my real after-tax cost of borrowing is $3.20.  </p>
<p>Now, let’s change the example by assuming a 4% inflation rate and let nominal interest rate rise by the increase in inflation times 1/(1 – t), which implies a 9% nominal interest rate.  I now pay you $9 in nominal interest income and your tax bill goes up to $1.80.  With $7.20 in after-tax nominal income and a 4% erosion in your principle, your real after-tax income is still $3.20.  I get a $1.80 deduction, which means my after-tax nominal expense is $7.20 and my after-tax real interest expense is still $3.20.  </p>
<p>Of course, this simple inflation is neutral story may not fit the real world where tax rates differ and some interest expenses are not deductible.  But also note that certain types of capital income get preferential tax treatment.  The capital-gains tax currently is low and one can play all sorts of games to defer the payment of taxes on accrued capital gains.  Kerpen’s calculation of the impact of the “inflation tax” strikes me as wildly biased.  </p>
<p>Kerpen endorses what may be a sensible idea:</p>
<blockquote><p>Fortunately, new legislation sponsored by Reps. Mike Pence (R., Ind.) and Eric Cantor (R., Va.), H.R. 6057, would repeal the inflation tax. The bill would index the tax basis for an asset to inflation, taxing only real gains, not inflation. With the burgeoning investor class making up more than half of voters, this basic fairness issue is sound politics as well as policy. Pence-Cantor is a bill that should become a law.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://macroblog.typepad.com/macroblog/2006/09/i_second_the_mo.html">David Altig</a> also likes this proposal.  David also considers alternative means for resolving any potential inflation non-neutralities including monetary restraint:</p>
<blockquote><p>That&#8217;s a fine point, and the Feldstein article does duly note that the appropriate way to analyze a tax rate reduction is to insist on revenue neutrality (at least in a present value sense).  You may think that capital income taxes are just fine where they are.  I won&#8217;t object (at least not here). But even so, is it really a good idea to use monetary policy to engineer tax policy? Isn&#8217;t the right approach to insulate statutory tax rates from the potential influence of inflation, and leave fiscal policy decisions to Congress?</p></blockquote>
<p>Actually, I would prefer raising the tax rate on real capital gains so as to tax all forms of real income at the same rate.  Otherwise, I concur with David.</p>
