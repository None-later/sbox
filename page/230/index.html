                                <p>With the recent surge in oil prices I thought it would be useful to look at the potential impact with one set of data I watch.  It is energy as a share of personal consumption expenditures or consumer spending.  In the 1970s energy consumption rose from about 6% to 9% of spending, or about 50%.  In the early 2000s energy rose from about 4% to 7% of consumer spending before it collapsed.  As of December energy&#8217;s share of consumer spending was already back to 6% of spending, about the level it peaked at in the last cycle before the financial panic generated a drop in other consumer spending.  If you look at energy consumption this way it appears that oil consumption was already at the point where futher oil price increases would rapidly impact consumer spending on other items.</p>

<p>One area where higher oil prices clearly impacts consumer spending is autos, as consumer spending on new and used autos and energy have a very strong negative correlation. If rising oil prices generate a drop in real income or standard of living one of the easiest way to compensate is to delay buying a new,or used car.  What would have been new monthly auto payments can be used to sustain consumption of other items.  In this chart you can clearly see that this happened in both the 1970s and the 2000s.  You can also see that spending on energy and autos accounted for  about 10% of consumer spending in the 1990s and 2000s.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />But the chart also shows that auto consumption was only about 3.5% of consumer spending at the end of 2010 as compared to a 5% to 5.5% norm in the 1990s and 2000s economic expansions.  So the consumer does not really have the option to cut back on auto consumption like they did in the previous examples of oil price spikes.  These charts suggest that if oil prices remain high or expand well past $100 we are quite likely to see consumer spending suffer across the board.  Note that this chart of spending is based on nominal dollars.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/--c7IXSalRTU/TWawgAtRSSI/AAAAAAAABhw/ULQciTMTvEE/s1600/Clipboard02.bmp"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/--c7IXSalRTU/TWawgAtRSSI/AAAAAAAABhw/ULQciTMTvEE/s320/Clipboard02.bmp" alt="" border="0"></a><br />Also note that Brent crude is already about $120 while West Texas Intermediate &#8212; the US base price &#8212; has only increased to about $100.  This apparently is due to excess supplies in the Midwest because of a new oil pipeline from Canada.  Such a divergence can only last so long, so that if oil supplies are interrupted for very long you can expect West Texas Intermediate to close on the Brent price fairly rapidly.</p>

<p><em>The following is a shortened version of Rachel Maddow&#8217;s opening monologue from her show on <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/26315908/ns/msnbc_tv-rachel_maddow_show/">Wednesday on MSNBC</a>:</em></p>
<blockquote><p>For the next hour, we begin with the president of the United States addressing the nation and calling for a massive investment in this country&#8217;s infrastructure, rebuffing the idea of giant tax breaks for the richest Americans, and warning anyone who would dare touch Social Security to keep their hands off.
<p>You want to talk about red meat for the base? Listen to some of the language the president used. &#8220;Workers have a right to organize into unions and to bargain collectively with their employers. And a strong, free labor movement is an invigorating and necessary part of our industrial society.&#8221; Wow.</p>
<p>How about this one? &#8220;Only a fool would try to deprive working men and women of their right to join the union of their choice.&#8221;</p>
<p>Listen to the way he goes after the right here. &#8220;Should any political party attempt to abolish Social Security, unemployment insurance, and eliminate labor laws and farm programs, you would not hear of that party again in our political history. There is a tiny splinter group, of course, that believes you can do these things, but their number is negligible and&#8221;&#8211;and the president says&#8211;&#8220;their number is negligible and they are stupid.&#8221;</p>
<p>That is not what Barack Obama said last night. That is way to the left of any national Democrat at this point. That was all Republican President Dwight David Eisenhower. That was all the stuff he said when he was president.</p>
<p>Republican President Dwight Eisenhower, president when the top tax bracket for the richest people in this country was 92 percent. President Eisenhower defended that tax bracket. He said we cannot afford to reduce taxes until, quote, &#8220;the factors of income and outgo will be balanced.&#8221; Eisenhower insisting there must be a balanced budget and that taxes on the rich are the way to balance it. Dwight Eisenhower, you know, noted leftist.</p>
<p>The Republican Party platform of Eisenhower&#8217;s 1956 called for expansion of Social Security, broadened unemployment insurance, better health protection for all of our people. It called for voting rights&#8211;full voting civil rights for D.C. It called for expanding the minimum wage to cover more workers. It called for improved job safety for workers, equal pay for workers regardless of sex.</p>
<p>This is the Republican Party circa 1956. The Republican Party.</p>
<p>The story of modern American politics writ large is the story of your father&#8217;s and your grandfather&#8217;s Republican Party now being way to the left of today&#8217;s leftiest liberals. If Dwight Eisenhower were running for office today, he would have to run, I&#8217;m guessing as an independent, and not as some Joe Lieberman, in between the parties, independent. He&#8217;d be a Bernie Sanders independent.</p>
<p>In 1982, who passed the largest peacetime tax increase in U.S. history? That would be Ronald Reagan.</p>
<p>Who called for comprehensive health reform legislation during in a State of the Union address in 1974, a program that was well to the left of what either Bill Clinton or Barack Obama ultimately proposed? That would be Richard Nixon.</p>
<p>Eisenhower and Reagan and Nixon&#8211;they were not the liberals of their day. They were the conservatives of their own time.</p>
<p>But the whole of American politics has shifted so far to the right in the last 50 years that what used to be thought of as conservative, what used to be thought of as a conservative position, is now considered to be off-the-charts lefty.</p>

<p>I just came upon <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cdi.org/program/document.cfm?DocumentID=4639">The Pentagon Labyrinth</a> Its a very readable, very informative collection of essays about national defense in the United States.  The essays are written by ex-defense personnel (some of whom were very influential) and journalists who cover the military, and to top it off, its free!!!! </p>
<p>From the book&#8217;s blurbage:</p>
</p>
<blockquote><p>The Pentagon Labyrinth aims to help both newcomers and seasoned observers learn how to grapple with the problems of national defense. Intended for readers who are frustrated with the superficial nature of the debate on national security, this handbook takes advantage of the insights of ten unique professionals, each with decades of experience in the armed services, the Pentagon bureaucracy, Congress, the intelligence community, military history, journalism and other disciplines. The short but provocative essays will help you to:<br /><a name="more"></a>
<p>-identify the decay—moral, mental and physical—in America’s defenses,</p>
<p>-understand the various “tribes” that run bureaucratic life in the Pentagon,</p>
<p>-appreciate what too many defense journalists are not doing, but should,</p>
<p>-conduct first rate national security oversight instead of second rate theater,</p>
<p>-separate careerists from ethical professionals in senior military and civilian ranks,</p>
<p>-learn to critique strategies, distinguishing the useful from the agenda-driven,</p>
<p>-recognize the pervasive influence of money in defense decision-making,</p>
<p>-unravel the budget games the Pentagon and Congress love to play,</p>
<p>-understand how to sort good weapons from bad—and avoid high cost failures, and reform the failed defense procurement system without changing a single law.</p>
<p>The handbook ends with lists of contacts, readings and Web sites carefully selected to facilitate further understanding of the above, and more.</p>
<p>This new publication from the Center for Defense Information (CDI) is being made available for download through our Web site at the following links below. Included are the full e-book, and all individual sections and essays in PDF format. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Its a quick read (vital for me right now!!), and frankly, there isn&#8217;t much in here that&#8217;s controversial though its clear several of the writers relish being gadflies.  The book is chock full of facts, and it provides a lot of great food for thought about military issues.</p>

<p><a target href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2011/02/more-on-the-mortgage-mess.html">More on the Mortgage Mess</a>
<p>As our banking giants engaged more and more in speculation, and as the shadow banking system saw a way to make money off of people&#8217;s bad financial decisions by betting against subprime loans, the financial crisis took off.  So redressing the problems that caused the crisis shouldn&#8217;t overlook mortgages.</p>
<p>The Treasury has now come out with a &#8220;plan&#8221; for addressing the government sponsored enterprises Fannie and Freddie, which played a role in the crisis though were not the drivers of the subprime origination mess.  The plan, <a href="http://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/Documents/Reforming%20America%27s%20Housing%20Finance%20Market.pdf">Reforming America&#8217;s Housing Finance Market: A Report to Congress</a> (Treasury and Housing and Urban Development, Feb. 2011), claims that it will &#8220;reform America&#8217;s housing finance market to better serve families and function more safely in a world that has changed dramatically.&#8221;  It also claims that it is intended to limit the government&#8217;s primary role to &#8220;robust oversight and consumer protection, targeted assistance for low-and moderate-income homeowners and renters, and carefully designed support for market stability and crisis response.&#8221;</p>
<p> <a name="more"></a>
<p>Both of those claims are worrisome.  First, the alternatives proposed seem better designed to serve the financial services industry than famililes.  Not only is there still no provision for mortgage modification in bankruptcy, but securitization is intended to &#8220;continue to play a major role in housing finance&#8221;, even though the securitization process has brought a nightmare of foreclosure mills and uncertainties about who owns debt and has the right to foreclose.  While the Administration walks the GOP-favored walk of decreasing government/increasing private markets, it nonetheless leaves government as the one that backstops the private mortgage market, retaining the possibility of private gains and social losses.</p>
<p>Second, the statement that government will be limited to &#8220;carefully designed support for market stability and crisis response&#8221; means that the government will continue to backstop the securitization losses, as Yves Smith at Naked Capitalism puts it in <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2011/02/15844.html">The 7 Things Really Wrong with the Treasury&#8217;s GSE Proposal</a>:</p>
<p>Of the Treasury three proposals, the last is the same as one advanced by the big guns, from the<a href="http://www.mortgagebankers.org/files/Advocacy/2009/RecommendationsfortheFutureGovernmentRole.pdf"> Mortgage Bankers Association</a>, the Fed (both the New York Fed and the Board of Governors), the Financial Services Roundtable and <a href="http://www.economy.com/mark-zandi/documents/Mortgage-Finance-Reform-020711.pdf">Mark Zandi of Moodys</a>. This alternative preserves too many bad elements of status quo ante, in particular significant and largely hidden subsidies for banks, for anyone to hail it as reform. Although each proposal has some distinctive wrinkles, all call for the creation of “private” entities that would provide insurance to mortgage backed securities that would then be reinsured by the government, with a full faith and credit guarantee.</p>
<p>What is to prevent huge public losses?  The proposal relies on a guarantee fee and higher bank capital requirements.   This isn&#8217;t good enough because it builds too much on the status quo ante.  Yves Smith provides her list of the Treasury proposal&#8217;s problems:</p>
<ol>
<li>The most pressing problems related to the crisis of abuses in the housing securitization markets outside of Fannie and Freddie are still not addressed </li>
<li>The plan continues to use a poor tool to address housing goals, by focusing on mortgage financing. </li>
<li>Reliance on the old 30-year fixed rate prepayable mortgage is outdated and fails to address today&#8217;s markets. </li>
<li>Continued use of the private (owners of the entities)/public (backers of the entities debts) structure is fated to suffer the same problems with increasing risk and lobbying as Fannie and Freddie </li>
<li>This just props up the housing market; it isn&#8217;t really a help to consumers. </li>
<li>The new entities will continue the conflicting roles of the pre-crash Fannie and Freddie of propping up liquidity and making credit decisions. </li>
<li>There&#8217;s nothing to keep these new entities from being too big to fail.</li>
</ol>

                                <p>I sent this <a target="_blank" href="http://www.salon.com/news/politics/war_room/index.html?story=/politics/war_room/2011/02/20/adler_supreme_court">Salon article on the Supreme Court justice Clarence Thomas</a> <em>The bigger Clarence Thomas scandal</em> by Ben Adler to Beverly Mann asking her what she thought of the article.  The article discusses the possible conflict of interest regarding Judge Thomas&#8217;s ruling on <em>Citizen&#8217;s United</em> and his failure to disclose his wife&#8217;s earnings:  </p>
<blockquote><p>Experts on legal ethics don&#8217;t all agree on whether Thomas should have recused himself in Citizens United and whether he will be honor bound to do so for healthcare reform. But they are unanimous in their condemnation of Thomas&#8217; dishonest filings on his disclosure forms. &#8220;Since it went on for six years [2003-2007 and 2009] it&#8217;s especially troublesome,&#8221; says Stephen Gillers, a prominent expert on legal ethics at NYU law school. &#8220;It&#8217;s impossible to claim it&#8217;s an oversight.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The article makes clear that the rules such as the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_code_of_judicial_conduct/model_code_of_judicial_conduct_table_of_contents.html">Code of Judicial Conduct</a> do not apply to Supreme Court Justices, and suggests we take take a look at the matter.</p>
<p>Beberly Mann responds to my query on what she thought of the article:</p>
<blockquote><p>What a terrific article. Thanks for pointing it out to me.</p>
<p>One thing that jumped out at me was that the expenses for Thomas’s trip to Palm Springs to attend a conference sponsored by the Koch brothers, and which Thomas reported as being paid by the Federalist Society, might have come from Koch Industries instead. I knew that there was a discrepancy between one of Thomas’s versions of events (that he only popped into the conference for a few minutes) and a more recent version (that he attended all four days of the conference. The latter version was given after there were questions raised about the propriety of Thomas’s accepting airfare and four days’ hotel costs from the Federalist Society if he only popped into the conference for a few minutes.<br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>But I didn’t know that there’s some suspicion that it actually was Koch Industries rather than the Federalist Society that paid his expenses. That would be breathtaking, in my opinion, especially if he lied about the source of the money on his disclosure statement.</p>
<p>As for Thomas’s having filed false disclosure statements for at least six years (somewhere, I read that the number of years is greater than six) concerning his wife’s income, a friend of mine has suggested that it violates a particular <a target="_blank" href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/usc_sec_18_00001001----000-.html">criminal statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1001</a>, titled “Statements or entries generally. My friend also says, “The DoJ said that the statute was aimed at willful failure to make proper EIGA disclosure.” The <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_in_Government_Act.%3Cbr%20/%3E">EIGA is the Ethics In Government Act of 1978</a>, which is the statute that requires disclosure statements. </p>
<p>This is not my area of expertise, so I can’t (or at least shouldn’t) comment more on this.  It is the Department of Justice’s Public Integrity Section’s area of expertise, though, and if the filing of knowingly false disclosure statements does violate that or another criminal statute, then I would hope the DoJ will investigate. I also hope that if it is, the lawyers who work on the matter include Republicans, maybe even a Federalist Society member or two, as well as non-Republicans. This should be entirely apolitical. It really, really bothers me that this justice apparently simply decided to not comply with that law, and that he just presumed that because of his position as a controversial justice he was untouchable because it would cause too much political controversy to actually investigate him under the criminal law (I’m assuming here that this does violate a criminal statute, although, as I said, I don’t really know.)</p>
<p>If the Doj does investigate, it would be done secretly, at least initially.</p>
<p>Another thing mentioned in the article that I didn’t know—but am absolutely ecstatic to hear—is that Grassley had reintroduced a bill to establish an office of inspector general for the federal courts.  I know that that was something that was proposed by House and Senate Republican Judiciary Committee members back before the Republicans lost control of both houses in the 2006 election—and it was the single thing on which I agreed with the Republicans rather than the Dems.  It was, of course, very controversial. High-profile members of the judiciary, present and retired, complained publicly that this was an assault on the independence of the judiciary. </p>
<p>I absolutely disagree, if it’s set up properly and with meaningful safeguards. To avoid separation-of-powers problems, it would have to be part of the judicial branch, just as the various executive-branch offices of inspector generals, such as the one Justice Department’s Office of Inspector General, are part of the executive branch. But an obviously key part of the setup is that they operative independent of the executive branch hierarchy.</p>

                                <p>Bond markets are pricing in rate hikes this year by the ECB and the BoE. Both are inflation targeters, so which one <em>should</em> react first to a possible <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-02-22/oil-gold-gain-as-libya-turmoil-worsens-asia-stocks-u-s-futures-decline.html">spike in oil prices</a>? What&#8217;s your answer?</p>
<p>(1) Neither. As FX appreciation and fiscal austerity pass through to domestic prices, the core will drag down the headline. If they hike, stagflation will result.</p>
<p>(2) The ECB, because it is the most hawkish of all central banks, in my view. The ECB mandates a rigid targeting scheme compared to that of the BoE. Since the January 2005, the BoE has successfully targeted inflation slightly under 2% just 27% of the time, while ECB has done so 61% of the time.</p>
<p>(3) The UK. The January 2011 UK inflation rate was 4% Y/Y (<a href="http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/tgm/table.do?tab=table&#038;language=en&#038;pcode=teicp000&#038;tableSelection=1&#038;plugin=1">3.2% in November </a>on a harmonized basis) and near-double that in the Eurozone, 2.4% according to the <a href="http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_PUBLIC/2-31012011-AP/EN/2-31012011-AP-EN.PDF">flash estimate</a>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the UK story is not one of just energy and food. The chart below illustrates the diffusion of price inflation across the components of the harmonized HICP (data at <a href="http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/statistics/search_database">Eurostat</a>), and the legend lists the period average for each economy. Diffusion levels above 50 indicate that a larger share of component prices are growing at an annual rate above 2% that below 2%. The diffusion a measure of the breadth of price pressures&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-P8EUNaRdhcw/TWQ0pSawq4I/AAAAAAAADe8/e6oTvjRIdJc/s1600/diffusion_chart.JPG"><img alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-P8EUNaRdhcw/TWQ0pSawq4I/AAAAAAAADe8/e6oTvjRIdJc/s400/diffusion_chart.JPG" border="0"></a>&#8230;and is UK inflation broad-based! In contrast, inflation in the Eurozone is focused in the commodity and energy space. Now, I&#8217;m not suggesting that the BoE hike &#8211; in fact I would recommend the opposite, or at least stay on hold &#8211; but I&#8217;m sure that the BoE has its vision acutely focused on developments in the <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financetopics/oilprices/8341667/All-eyes-on-Bahrain-as-Gulf-tremors-frighten-oil-markets.html#">Middle East</a>.</p>
<p>If I had to choose an economy that would be derailed by the price spikes in the commodity space, it would be the UK. <strong>But I choose (1).<br /></strong><br /><em><strong>Rebecca Wilder</strong></em></p>

<p><strong>Medical Malpractice Reform: Truth in Advertising Needed</strong> (Part Two of Three)</p>
<p>So in the first article, we discussed the historical implications of tort reform by examining Texas. The take home message being that tort reform failed to curb health care spending, and/or control costs (outside of malpractice premiums which did fall). Proponents of tort reform claim that by enacting aggressive tort reform measures, so called defensive medicine practices could be reigned in. Estimates about the costs of defensive medicine vary, and I have seen estimates in the literature as low as 4%, and as high as 14% of total health care spending. As with most things, the truth is probably somewhere in the middle, with a realistic estimate of 8-9% likely being the real integer. Recently, several studies have attempted to assess two of the most important questions about this topic: </p>
<p>A: Does a reduction in defensive medicine practices occur with the implementation of tort reform measures? </p>
<p>And</p>
<p>B: If it does cause a reduction in defensive medicine practices, will this affect patient outcomes or mortality? <br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Three more recent studies are likely the most pertinent, and we will briefly review those. To start with, Currie and MacLeod (go ahead, I had the Highlander flashback too) (2006) reviewed national data on childbirths to examine whether or not a cap on non economic damages would change the types of procedures performed at childbirth. They found that nationally, in those states with tort reform, the rate of C-Sections increased, and the rate of preventable complications secondary to childbirth increased by 6%. They also found, that a change in the “deep pockets rule”, actually decreased them. The paper is <a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w12478">HERE</a> (gated article).</p>
<p>Then Sloan and Shadle in 2009 examined this same issue, using Medicare payments as an index. Their premise was, that if tort reform truly changed physician practices with regards to additional testing and/or defensive medicine, they would find a reduction in Medicare payment rates per beneficiary. They found that tort reform did not alter defensive medicine practices, with one exception. They did find that so called “indirect” reforms (mandatory periodic payments, Joint and Severability reform, and patient compensation funds) may reduce spending when applied to “any hospitalization”, but inexplicably, these indirect reforms did not affect any of the four diagnoses included in the study. Their paper is <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&#038;_udi=B6V8K-4V761XY-1&#038;_user=10&#038;_coverDate=03%2F31%2F2009&#038;_rdoc=1&#038;_fmt=high&#038;_orig=search&#038;_origin=search&#038;_sort=d&#038;_docanchor=&#038;view=c&#038;_acct=C000050221&#038;_version=1&#038;_urlVersion=0&#038;_userid=10&#038;md5=a4a3b91a125f2e631dcc3ff85b09888a&#038;searchtype=a">HERE</a>.</p>
<p>There have been others, and the final one we will discuss is the NBER report done in 2009 by Darius Lakdawalla and Seth Seabury, Working Paper No. 15383. Found <a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w15383.pdf">HERE</a> (gated article). Essentially, Lakdawalla and Seabury found that while targeted reforms may be effective, there could be an associated, and this is key… a 0.2% associated increase in mortality for every 10% reduction in medical malpractice liability costs. Why? Because defensive medicine practices DO FIND things. Any physician who has been in practice for any length of time, and who is being honest with you, will admit that they have done a test presuming it would be negative, and “perhaps the patient doesn&#8217;t need it”, only to be surprised by the results. We can argue whether or not 0.2% is a significant number, but even we look at the sickest 5% of Americans who are responsible for 47% of healthcare spending, than this group could have an increase of 30,000 deaths annually with a reduction of 10% spending on medical malpractice. I am not going to pass moral judgment on this fact. I will leave that up to the reader. The reason I bring this up, is that this is an important, and poignant discussion, but we need to be honest about the data that is out there now. Let’s have a discussion, but let it be an honest, and fact based one.</p>
<p>I tend to think that the Sloan and Shadle findings are important in the fact that I don’t think that physician practices are going to “magically” change overnight. The Texas evidence from the last article, would suggest that testing expenditures may actually increase. Yet, in the face of overwhelming evidence, proponents continue to cling to a disproven ideology regarding direct malpractice cost containment, IE; Non economic caps.</p>

                                <p>Last year many economists argued that the economy needed more quantitative easing which would drive down real interest rates (whether by driving down long maturity nominal rates or by driving up expected inflation).  The counter argument is that quantitative easing is not effective if there is a liquidity trap.  </p>
<p>Well we now have QE2 (<a href="http://money.cnn.com/2010/11/03/news/economy/fed_decision/index.htm">since early November 2010</a>) and real interest rates actually increased (very slightly).  The 8 year real interest rate (TIPS rate on notes due January 15 2019 increased.  I think  that this is the real rate which was most likely to decline when the Fed bought 7 year (ordinary nominal) Treasury notes.</p>
<p>http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/TP10J19</p>
<p>That didn&#8217;t do anything for the recovery and it is a  response to an open market operation many times larger than the largest pre-Bernanke open market operation (I mean as a percent of high powered money outstanding &#8212; one has to be specific since Bernanke had earlier more than doubled Fed liabilities).</p>

<div>Now that the story is getting out that Governor Walke et al&#8217;s bill is about more than just busting unions, a little bell went off in the back of my head. Yes, I read Shock Doctrine. Yes, I understand the true concept of fascism. I read What would Jefferson do. I read C &#038; L, AB, Hullabaloo, Glen Greenwald, watch Rachel, Ed, Cspan, etc, etc, etc. And, there are some people pointing out the connections between some of all these perspectives. However, Wisconsin&#8217;s current event just seemed too familiar. Deja vue familiar. More familiar than all the reading and listening would allow. It is experiencingly familiar and I don&#8217;t mean Egypt. </div>
<div></div>
<div>I mean, we can all see (or at least a majority are now seeing) the thread of connection to all the seemingly disjointed liberal/progressive commentary about what has been happening in America since around 1981. We even are accepting that Clinton et al&#8217;s governing time was part of the thread. It&#8217;s economic. It&#8217;s societal structure, it&#8217;s civil rights, it&#8217;s power (always is since the constitutional convention). </div>
<div></div>
<div>But, where&#8217;s the beef. Show me the money. Where is the materialization most recently that it all came together as to the implementation of the play book that Governor Walker et al are using such that I know this is real&#8230;this is really and honestly currently America&#8230;American?</div>

<blockquote><div>The political deadlock in Baghdad, which has prevented the formation of an Iraqi government more than six months after the parliamentary elections in March, has not prevented the administration of Nuri Kamal al-Maliki from opening the southern oilfields to the world&#8217;s giant corporations. <strong>Nor has it stopped the US Embassy and Commerce Department from reinvigorating the Bush-era program of selling the country&#8217;s public assets to corporate buyers.</strong> And because Iraqi unions have organized opposition to privatization since the start of the occupation, the Maliki administration is enforcing with a vengeance Saddam Hussein&#8217;s prohibition of public sector unions. </div>
<div></div>
<div>The United States may have withdrawn its combat brigades, but it is not leaving Iraq. And while Washington may have scaled back its dreams of nation-building, it has not given <strong>up on a key aspect of the economic agenda behind that project: encouraging corporate investment by sacrificing the rights of Iraqi workers.</strong></div>
<div></div>
<div>June demonstrations over blackouts, supported by the union &#8212; <strong>the first national union led by a woman, Hashmeya Muhsin &#8212; were put down by police,</strong> who killed one protester and injured several others</div>
<div></div>
<div>Also in June, longshoremen protesting the prohibition of unions in ports south of Basra <strong>were surrounded by troops, and the union&#8217;s leaders were transferred hundreds of miles from their homes. </strong></div>
<div></div>
<div>In January <strong>the government threw the president of Basra&#8217;s Iraqi Teachers Union in jail.</strong> According to Nasser al-Hussain, an executive board member, the government seeks to establish control over an organization it views as far too independent.</div>
<div></div>
<div>After the 2003 invasion, occupation czar Paul Bremer decided to keep on the books Saddam&#8217;s Law 150, which bans public sector unions. Each succeeding Iraqi administration continued the prohibition. </div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>Wisconsin is not Egypt nor the rest of the protesting that is going on in the middle east other than that there is protesting. Not at all. Wisconsin is Iraq for one big, monstrous, sledge hammer to the head reason: Iraq&#8217;s oppression and thus resistance by the unions is all American. The union busting to the benefit of capital (big, huge money for the rest of you, as in Rockefeller&#8217;s Standard Oil time) in Iraq is purely American. We own it. Yes, we have propped up dictators such as in Egypt. What is singularly different in the protesting of Egypt/Mid East is freedom. They protested for freedom. Now we&#8217;ll see if they get unions. However, Wisconsin and Iraq are free. American style free in that Iraq is American made. <a href="http://upsidedownworld.org/iraqiunions.htm">They also have/had unions</a>. </div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><div>At the end of World War I, Iraqi workers wasted no time in forming oil, railway and dockworker unions in the fragmented country that Churchill had carved out of the desert, connecting the oil fields of three Ottoman provinces–Mosul, Baghdad, and Basra. Their hold on the terrain already tenuous, the British occupiers responded with force. Repeated strikes were quashed, often violently. </div>
<div></div>
<div>Under Qasim&#8217;s watch, unions along with civic groups swelled in rank and number. By 1959, 250,000 workers had joined unions in Iraq; peasants had formed 3,000 village associations for 200,000 peasants; the Iraqi Women&#8217;s League boasted 20,000 members and the Democratic Youth Federation 84,000 youngsters. </div>
<div>Qasim&#8217;s &#8220;progressive&#8221; autocracy was fleeting, however, and in February of 1963, <strong>the Baath party, in alliance with a sect of the nationalist armed forces, and with the help of the CIA, overthrew Qasim.</strong></div>
<div></div>
<div>When Saddam Hussein seized control in 1979, he built upon the Baathist tradition of usurping the unions as an instrument of state power. As part of his brutal purge of all leaders and activists refusing to pledge total allegiance to the Baath party, he eradicated all non-Baathist unions. In 1987, the Baathist unions fully backed Saddam&#8217;s Orwellian decree: &#8220;From now on, the title &#8216;worker&#8217; is abolished and all workers shall become official employees by the State&#8230;<strong>As everybody is now a government employee, there is no more need for trade unions.&#8221;</strong> Interestingly, Saddam did tolerate private sector unions, albeit with certain laws circumscribing their powers. The exception appears irrelevant, because, since the 1970&#8217;s through the fall of Saddam, no strikes are known to have occurred in Iraq, according to Political Risk Services, a well-respected corporate consultancy firm.</div>

<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>If you think Obama&#8217;s recent commentary is hopeful for unions, <a href="http://www.middle-east-online.com/english/?id=41829">guess again</a>:</div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><div>When questioned by reporters about the union bans, an official at the US Embassy, the world&#8217;s largest, said mildly, &#8220;We&#8217;re looking into it. We hope that everybody resolves their differences in an amicable way.&#8221; The Obama White House has not spoken out, and the latest <strong>State Department report on human rights plays down the oppression of Iraqi unionists, calling their situation a &#8220;limited exercise of labour rights.&#8221;</strong></div>

<div>Can you say Public Option? I knew you could.  However, start asking you gen X&#8217;ers and younger if they have heard of the &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O93YpTYCWRk">labor wars</a>&#8220;.  You might be surprised, and not pleasantly.  Just like the term &#8220;<a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2009/05/define-rich-part-ii-rat-race-and.html">rat race</a>&#8220;.  Remember that one?  You need to.   </div>
