<p>The Geithner plan has been announced and the Dow has <a href="http://finance.google.com/finance?client=ob&#038;q=INDEXDJX:DJI">dropped 381.99 so far today </a></p>
<p>Reminds me of this by <a target="_blank" href="http://drezner.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2008/11/25/leading_by_appointment">Daniel Drezner</a></p>
<blockquote><p>[O]ne could forgive Geithner right now if his head swelled just a little bit. The Dow Jones Industrial Average shot up five hundred points on Friday as word of his appointment leaked. The Dow jumped close to another four hundred points yesterday after Obama officially introduced him. One has to wonder if, sometime this week, when Geithner’s wife asks him to do the dishes, he will be tempted to respond, “Have you caused the Dow to jump by more than ten percent? I didn’t think so!”</p></blockquote>

<p>Mashall <a href="http://www.thedemocraticstrategist.org/strategist/2009/02/post_16.php">wrote</a> </p>
<blockquote><p>New York Times columnist Paul Krugman came out blasting yesterday, all but calling the president a postpartisan wimp.</p>
<p>Obama’s stimulus plan, he said, is too small to plug the hole in our economy created by faltering private demand. And he chided the president for allowing a bipartisan group of Senate moderates to strip various provisions out of the House bill. In language that could qualify for a Pulitzer Prize in hyperbole, Krugman claimed that the dastardly centrists would kill hundreds of thousands of jobs and cut vital health care and food programs, while offering new a fat tax break to affluent homeowners. </p></blockquote>
<p>I have some questions for Marshall</p>
<p>Dear Mr Marshall</p>
<p>You write &#8220;In language that could qualify for a Pulitzer Prize in hyperbole, Krugman claimed that the dastardly centrists would kill hundreds of thousands of jobs&#8230;&#8221;  Evidently your estimate of the effect of the changes on the number of jobs is that they will reduce employment by less than 200,000 (less than hundreds of thousands).  Please show your work. </p>
<p>Could you explain to us what quantitative model you used ?  Has it been empirically successful in the past ?  What is your point estimate of the number of jobs lost due to the changes ?  Is it about 100,000 or about 0 or do you think the changes will lead to higher employment ?</p>
<p>I assume that you are a serious person and didn&#8217;t claim that Krugman&#8217;s estimate is absurdly large without making an estimate of your own.</p>
<p>If you make quantitative claims without quantitative analysis, then you might try to find an economist who defends the compromise.  There are economists who think that Keynesian stimulus has not effect on employment.  They consider the Collins Nelson plan terrible and thing that Collins and Nelson should have voted against cloture.  There are economists who think that the House plan is better than the compromise voted by the Senate.  Is there any economist, hell anyone who bases his or her arguments on the consequences of policy, who agrees with the Nelson-Collins plan ?  </p>
<p>Is there anyone who has performed calculations with numbers (as opposed to awarding the Pulitzer for a number) who thinks that the stimulus plan will cause increased employment *and* who thinks that the Nelson-Collins changes won&#8217;t reduce employment by hundreds of thousands of jobs ?</p>
<p>I ask for information and expect an answer.</p>
<p>update:  I went back to http://www.thedemocraticstrategist.org/strategist/2009/02/post_16.php and found that Marshall didn&#8217;t respond to my request for his quantitative analysis in the comment thread or in another post at www.thedemocraticstrategist.com.  Then I posted another comment.  This one, I admit, is sophomoric.  It is also after the jump.</p>
<p>Krugman is not calling for partisanship for partisanship&#8217;s sake. He is attempting to analyse the effects the house plan and the senate plan would have on the economy. He is an economist you know. He is not alone in his view that dollar for dollar spending provides more stimulus than tax cuts, note at his blog he links to CAP analysis of the implications of the CBO estimates of multipliers for the difference in employment between the two plans.</p>
<p>I have asked for the quantitative analysis which supports the claim that Krugman&#8217;s claim &#8220;that the dastardly centrists would kill hundreds of thousands of jobs&#8221; is worthy of a Pulitzer prize in hyperbole. The assertion is that the difference in employment under the two plans is far far less than 200,000. Such a claim should be based on a quantitative analysis. Where did Mr Marshall get his multipliers ? Did he estimate them himself ? Where did he get his Okun&#8217;s law coefficient ? What is his Okun&#8217;s law coefficient ?</p>
<p>I might add that I also object to three other assertions &#8220;Many economists believe that the plan’s details matter less than its scale, because they believe what’s essential now is to boost the confidence and “animal spirits” of U.S. consumers, businesses and lenders.&#8221; [citation needed] How many ? What are their names ? I can&#8217;t think of one. An assertion about economists should be supported by a link to a list of economists. There is no word limit on the web. There is no excuse for assertions of fact not supported by specific evidence.</p>
<p>Also &#8220;But some of the education provisions are more questionable and the housing credit, properly targeted on first-time homebuyers, could help to halt the slide in housing prices.&#8221; I note that Marshall absolutely disagrees with Obama on this one, but, much more to the point, economists such as Robert Shiller (worlds number one expert on housing prices I&#8217;d say) believe that the slide in housing prices can&#8217;t be stopped but only slowed. http://tinyurl.com/cvuwte Marshall seems to think he is more of an expert on housing prices than Shiller. What is the basis of his view that Shiller is wrong ?</p>
<p>Finally &#8220;What really seems to bug Krugman, though, is Obama’s postpartisan vision.&#8221; I mean come on. Is Marshall claiming he can read Krugman&#8217;s mind ? It should be simply off limits to comment on what someone guesses about someone else&#8217;s emotions. I might add that, for what it&#8217;s worth, it seems odd to me to guess that Krugman&#8217;s stated views on economics are based on his views on parties. I mean he is an economist. He was advocating spending not just tax cuts long before the House or the Senate (or the administration) took a position. However, the main point is that what it&#8217;s worth is nothing. I can&#8217;t read Krugman&#8217;s mind and I don&#8217;t try. I respond to his arguments not to my hypotheses about his psyche.</p>
<p>Bipartisanship is very nice, but if the price is hundreds of thousands of jobs, maybe a bit of partisanship is in order. Notably Obama has taken a strong public stand in favor of the house approach. Last I heard, the conference committee was dropping Senate proposals (house buying credit) and restoring House proposals (building and repairing schools).</p>
<p>Notably the defence of Obama seems a bit out of date, as Marshall is defending what Obama was doing a week ago and, therefore, criticizing what he is doing now.</p>
<p>By the way, have you noticed the amazing influence that the CAP has on the debate ? Paul Krugman, a Nobel laureate, dropped his rough analysis (600,000 jobs difference) in favor of theirs and the head of CAP was joint leader of the transition and the Economist calls one of their bloggers scary smart.</p>
<p>Not to be nasty but, rather, to be sophomoric, how is the progressive policy institute doing in comparison ? You know Krugman only found out about Marshall&#8217;s last contribution to the debate on Krugman by following a link from angrybear.blogspot.com. Now I am sure that the PPI and www.thedemocraticstrategist.org is much much more influential than agrybear. I&#8217;m sure commenters here (or the TDS staff) can point me to the proof supporting my guess.</p>

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Robert Waldmann</p>
<p>I have a proposal for targetted temporary spending which will have a huge immense disproportionate social benefit.  It is not, shall we say, very controversial as it comes under the NIH budget &#8212; the one the house and senate are competing to pump up most.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/news/2009/02/stimulus_bill_survives_senate_test_moves_ahead.php"><br />
<blockquote>On the other hand, the Senate bill calls for several billion more in spending for research at the National Institutes of Health, the result of an amendment backed last week by Specter.</p></blockquote>
<p></a></p>
<p>Oh and it might save Senator Specter&#8217;s life (not that I am accusing him of conflict of interest).</p>
<p>The aim is to find one off spending which sure doesn&#8217;t involve hiring more civil servants which is actually useful.  The proposal (not frankly my personal idea) is</p>
<p>$ 6 million (that&#8217;s million with an m) for GMP DOTA-biotin and biotinylated galactosylated albumin.</p>
<p>I think that strong evidence is available in the published literature that this will save the lives of people with lymphoma.   I mean evidence much stronger than any evidence in economics, although much too indirect to be called evidence in biology.</p>
<p>$ 6 million once.  Huge benefits. Explanation after the jump.  I promise you that I am absolutely serious.</p>
<p>The medical background.  A lymphoma is a solid tumor made of transformed white blood cells.  The most common kind of lymphoma is Hodgkin&#8217;s lymphoma which used to kill very quickly and now is usually cured by chemotherapy.  Hodgkin&#8217;s lymphoma is one of the few great successes of chemotherapy (which also works for leukemia in children and Wilm&#8217;s tumor and usefully complements surgery for many tumors).  However, sopme people still die of Hodgkin&#8217;s lymphoma.  Great success is not 100% success.  Another common kind of lymphoma is B-cell lymphoma &#8212; a cancer of the cells which produce antibodies.  In this case the odds are grim.  </p>
<p>A possible approach to treating cancer is to direct radioactive isotopes to the tumor using antibodies which stick to tumor specific antigens.  <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17530023?ordinalpos=2&#038;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum">Some success has been reported in the treatment of leukemia</a> (where the cancer is not a tumor but circulating cells in the blood).  However, getting antibodies into tumors is slow &#8212; we have evolved a system that means that antibodies stay in the blood and they are big and tumors are cramped.  <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11701553?ordinalpos=8&#038;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum">This means that radioactive isotopes are never well targeted to tumors much of the radiation remaining in the blood.</a></p>
<p>A possible solution is the Pre-targetting (TM) technology developed by Donald Axworthy and Louis Theodore (in alphabetical order) and patent pending and owned by Aletheon Inc (which last I heard basically consisted of Axworthy and Theodore).</p>
<p>The idea is to use the extremely tight affinity between a small molecule biotin (a vitamin) and streptavidin (a protein which binds biotin very avidly).  Lymphomas have known antigens (in fact proteins on their surfaces) which aren&#8217;t found on cells which we need.  A radioactive antibody which sticks to this antigen should, in principal, be a good therapy.  However, as noted above, a lot of the antibody stays in the blood.  The Aletheon approach is to make a hyrbrid protein which is basically the tumor specific antibody and streptavidin together.  This is injected into the patient.  Some slowly slowly sticks to the tumor.  Some stays in the blood.</p>
<p>Then they add a &#8220;clearing agent&#8221; biotinylated galactosylated albumin.  The biotin sticks to the hybrid antibodies.  Galactosylated proteins are removed from the blood by the liver (unless there is a molecule of sialic acid stuck to the galactose).  So the hybrid antibody-streptavidin is removed from the blod.</p>
<p>Then radioactive biotin is given IV.  It is a small molecule which quickly goes diffuses into among other places the tumour.  The radioactive biotin sticks to the streptavidin stuch to the tumor and stays there.  All of this is a description of experimental results with human tumors implanted into nude mice.</p>
<p>To make biotin radioactive they make a molecule which consists of biotin and a chelating agent DOTA (it&#8217;s still a small molecule and easy to synthesis).  a chelating agent is a molecule with two negatively charged bits sticking off like crab claws (chele in Italian and I guess Latin).  These bind ions charged +2 very tightly.  One such ion is disolved Ytrium90 which is radiactive.</p>
<p>At least 2 such antibodies are available.  I will discuss the simple antibodies (without the streptavidin part) which are both approved for sale as pharmaceuticals.</p>
<p>Anti-CD25 streptavidin and Anti-CD20-streptavidin.  Anti-CD25 (daclizumab, zenapax) does not stick to normal cells.  It does stick to activated T-cells (of which usually we have none) and, in some cases, to Hodgkin&#8217;s cells.  It can bind specifically to only lymphoma cells (in some cases of Hodgkins).  It basically always binds to cells in lymph nodes (that is where the tumor is).</p>
<p>Anti-CD20 (rituximab) is specific for B-cells (the cells which make antibodies).  A loss of B-cells is actually not a life threatening crisis as there are anti-sera (lots of antibodies) specific for most known pathogens which can be used in case a patient gets an infection and doesn&#8217;t have B-cells.  Also they come back after a while.  In contrast, B-cell lymphomas basically usually kill.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s the problem ?  Well see all the experiments are in mice, because there is no DOTA-biotin or biotinylated galactosylated albumin up to FDA standards for use in humans (that&#8217;s what GMP means it stands for good manufacturing practice).</p>
<p>There are firms which specialize in making things to FDA GMP standards.  They charge for this service.  It would cost around $ 6 million and take 6 months to have reagents in hand ready for desperate patients in a phase 1 study.</p>
<p>Absurdly, the NIH hasn&#8217;t been able to find $6 million in its huge budget, because they had forecast an even huger budget and basically committed the money.  Now everything is reversed.  There is a strong desire for one off spending, especially one off NIH spending, especially especially one off NIH spending which could save Senator Arlen Specter&#8217;s life. </p>
<p>So it&#8217;s bound to happen right ?</p>
<p>Hah. It might or might not and a blogswarm might save some lives right now.</p>
<p>I am absolutely totally serious.</p>

<blockquote>an international credit insurance and credit management services group, yesterday downgraded its ratings for 22 countries and territories, including Hong Kong and Taiwan, while putting the two biggest emerging markets — China and Russia — on its negative watch list for the first time.</p>
<p>To ensure sustained economic growth, which Coface said could reach 7 percent this year, China has unveiled a 4 trillion yuan (US$585 billion) fiscal stimulus package. Coface warned this could cause a significant upsurge in payment defaults.</p>
<p>“According to Coface’s records, payment performance in Hong Kong, Taiwan and China has been deteriorating and is likely to worsen this year as the economic slowdown tightens its grip,” Burton said. “Companies should be more careful than ever in tracking their buyers’ payment behavior.” </p></blockquote>

                                <p>by Bruce Webb</p>
<p>In a previous post I made a stab at explaining the differences in Republican and Democratic responses to the economics of stimulus by an appeal to differences in world view. With limited success due I think to my not developing my major premise. Here I want to back up a little and explore the very different ways right and left define &#8216;freedom&#8217;. I want to assert that the modern right draws their definition from Milton Friedman while the left fundamentally looks to FDR. Contrasting quotes and some commentary below the fold.<br />From the right we have their secular saint Milton Friedman <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Capitalism-Freedom-Phoenix-Milton-Friedman/dp/0226264017">Capitalism and Freedom</a> excerpted here <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/ipe/friedman.htm">Chapter I: The Relation between Economic Freedom and Political Freedom</a> (bolding mine)<br />
<blockquote>The citizen of the United States who is compelled by law to devote something like 10 per cent of his income to the purchase of a particular kind of retirement contract, administered by the government, is being deprived of a corresponding part of his personal freedom. How strongly this deprivation may be felt and its closeness to the deprivation of religious freedom, which all would regard as &#8220;civil&#8221; or &#8220;political&#8221; rather than &#8220;economic&#8221;, were dramatized by an episode involving a group of farmers of the Amish sect. On grounds of principle, this group regarded compulsory federal old age programs as an infringement of their personal individual freedom and refused to pay taxes or accept benefits. As a result, some of their livestock were sold by auction in order to satisfy claims for social security levies. True, the number of citizens who regard compulsory old age insurance as a deprivation of freedom may be few, but the believer in freedom has never counted noses.</p></blockquote>
<p>and here (note when Friedman uses &#8216;liberal&#8217; he means classical economic liberal, these days we would probably use something like &#8216;libertarian&#8217; or &#8216;economic conservative&#8217;)<br />
<blockquote>As liberals, we take freedom of the individual, or perhaps the family, as our ultimate goal in judging social arrangements. Freedom as a value in this sense has to do with the interrelations among people; it has no meaning whatsoever to a Robinson Crusoe on an isolated island (without his Man Friday). Robinson Crusoe on his island is subject to &#8220;constraint,&#8221; he has limited &#8220;power,&#8221; and he has only a limited number of alternatives, but there is no problem of freedom in the sense that is relevant to our discussion. Similarly, in a society freedom has nothing to say about what an individual does with his freedom; it is not an all-embracing ethic. Indeed, a major aim of the liberal is to leave the ethical problem for the individual to wrestle with. The &#8220;really&#8221; important ethical problems are those that face an individual in a free society &#8211; what he should do with his freedom. There are thus two sets of values that a liberal will emphasize &#8212; the values that are relevant to relations among people, which is the context in which he assigns first priority to freedom; and the values that are relevant to the individual in the exercise of his freedom, which is the realm of individual ethics and philosophy.</p></blockquote>
<p> So to Friedman while the free man was not autonomous, he is no Robinson Crusoe, on the other hand freedom is explicitly equated with individualism with possible (but interestingly not necessary) extension to the family. In this world view &#8216;Me First&#8217; becomes a first principle.</p>
<p>Now the modern liberal (which for Friedman equates roughly to &#8216;socialist&#8217;) takes a much different view of freedom. Instead we would appeal to Franklin Roosevelt&#8217;s State of the Union Speech from 1941.<br />
<blockquote>In the future days, which we seek to make secure, we look forward to a world founded upon four essential human freedoms.</p>
<p>The first is freedom of speech and expression &#8212; everywhere in the world.</p>
<p>The second is freedom of every person to worship God in his own way &#8212; everywhere in the world.</p>
<p>The third is freedom from want, which, translated into world terms, means economic understandings which will secure to every nation a healthy peacetime life for its inhabitants &#8212; everywhere in the world.</p>
<p>The fourth is freedom from fear, which, translated into world terms, means a world-wide reduction of armaments to such a point and in such a thorough fashion that no nation will be in a position to commit an act of physical aggression against any neighbor &#8212; anywhere in the world.</p></blockquote>
<p> I submit that there is no way to fundamentally reconcile these two world views. You can believe that freedom is ideally marked by an individual operating in the marketplace<br />
<blockquote>Fundamentally, there are only two ways of co-ordinating the economic activities of millions. One is central direction involving the use of coercion&#8211;the technique of the army and of the modern totalitarian state. The other is voluntary co-operation of individuals&#8211;the technique of the market place.</p></blockquote>
<p> or you can believe that freedom is a societal responsibility not realized until no one anywhere is lacking in healthy sustenance. Friedman is not a monster, indeed he considers the market the best mechanism to create the greatest good for greatest number outcome:<br />
<blockquote>So long as effective freedom of exchange is maintained, the central feature of the market organization of economic activity is that it prevents one person from interfering with another in respect of most of his activities. The consumer is protected from coercion by the seller because of the presence of other sellers with whom he can deal. The seller is protected from coercion by the consumer because of other consumers to whom he can sell. The employee is protected from coercion by the employer because of other employers for whom he can work, and so on. And the market does this impersonally and without centralized authority.</p>
<p>Indeed, a major source of objection to a free economy is precisely that it does this task so well. It gives people what they want instead of what a particular group thinks they ought to want. Underlying most arguments against the free market is a lack of belief in freedom itself.</p></blockquote>
<p> Well despite the popular stereotype of liberals as being mushyheaded kumbaya types we tend to be a lot more hard headed than this. We do not see a lot of historical evidence that markets prevent coercion, nor do we see that there really is totally free mobility of labor, in particular many of us see employer paid health insurance precisely as a device to prevent labor mobility and indirectly to suppress wages. Where Friedman sees individuals cooperating on an even playing field we see power relations of all types putting some people on the top of the rises preventing people in the dips from getting to the top. Where Friedman sees government intervention in the market as inherently distorting the playing field we liberals see it partially if not totally smoothing it.</p>
<p>Given this the difference between the Republican and Democratic views of the stimulative effects of government spending each are seen to be rational given the very, very large differences in their basic definitions of things like freedom itself. Liberals stamping our feet because there seems to be no real data to support the Treasury View or similar conclusions is pretty much a waste of time because such views pretty much flow right from the foundations of right thought as seen in Friedman&#8217;s work. You are not going to get a meeting of minds when one party singles out Social Security as the poster child of state coercion.<br />
<blockquote>On grounds of principle, this group regarded compulsory federal old age programs as an infringement of their personal individual freedom and refused to pay taxes or accept benefits.</p></blockquote>
<p> as opposed to<br />
<blockquote>The third is freedom from want, which, translated into world terms, means economic understandings which will secure to every nation a healthy peacetime life for its inhabitants &#8212; everywhere in the world.</p></blockquote>
<p>Not only are Friedman and FDR not looking eye to eye here, they are looking in totally different directions using very different lenses.</p>

                                <p>By Spencer</p>
<p>On the conservative/ libertarian blogs our friends keep telling us that increasing the minimum wage causes teenage unemployment to rise.  They base their argument on the basic economic principle that if the price of something goes up the demand will go down.  That is a basic principle of economics but as with all economic principles it has the unstated assumption that everything else is equal.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SZBc88cFoMI/AAAAAAAAAqc/LrDzLLsvGSs/s1600-h/Clipboard03.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SZBc88cFoMI/AAAAAAAAAqc/LrDzLLsvGSs/s320/Clipboard03.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a><br />I have never said that the principle is wrong, all I&#8217;ve ever said is that when I look at the data it does not support our friends&#8217; conclusions.  When I look at the data what I see is that the teenage unemployment rate seems to move in lockstep with the unemployment rate for other age groups.  Actually, if I run a regression of the teenage unemployment rate against the average unemployment rate for people over 35 I get very good results that says the teenage unemployment rate is some 3.8 times the unemployment rate for those over 35.</p>
<p>In economics we have this other great principle known as the omitted variable.  This suggests that those who are claiming that increases in the minimum wage cause teenage unemployment to go up are leaving something out of their analysis.</p>
<p>The evidence seems to strongly suggest that their omitted variable is the business cycle.</p>
<p>Since 1960 there have been 17 increases in the minimum wage and if you look at the data you find that about half of them have been associated with an increase in the teenage unemployment rate.  The half of the minimum wage increases that were associated with rising teen unemployment were also associated with a recession.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SZBc0h_L3oI/AAAAAAAAAqU/oTRfk9ay9ok/s1600-h/Clipboard01.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SZBc0h_L3oI/AAAAAAAAAqU/oTRfk9ay9ok/s320/Clipboard01.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a><br />Since 1960 every significant rise in teen unemployment except for the one in 1963 has been associated with a recession.  Clearly, the 1963 rise was not due to the minimum wage as the early 1960s minimum wage increases were too far before the wage hike or after it.</p>
<p>So you come up with a rule of thumb that seems to work without exception.<br />A minimum wage hike followed by a recession causes teenage unemployment to rise but<br />a minimum wage hike followed by an economic expansion has no impact.</p>
<p>So I ran a simple regression of the teenage unemployment rate as a function of two variables.<br />One was the adult (over 35) unemployment rate and the second was the minimum wage.<br />This is based on the premise that the adult unemployment rate captures the bulk of the business cycle impact on the teenage unemployment rate.</p>
<p>What I found was that the adult unemployment rate accounted for about 87.5% of the teenage unemployment rate and the minimum wage accounted for only 12.5%.</p>
<p>So maybe some of our conservative/libertarianism friends can explain why my work suggesting that the minimum wage has a negligible impact is wrong and their position that the minimum wage alone causes teen unemployment to soar is correct.</p>

No charge.<br />
<blockquote>
<p>Wikileaks has released nearly a billion dollars worth of quasi-secret reports commissioned by the United States Congress. </p>
<p>The 6,780 reports, current as of this month, comprise over 127,000 pages of material on some of the most contentious issues in the nation, from the U.S. relationship with Israel to the financial collapse. Nearly 2,300 of the reports were updated in the last 12 months, while the oldest report goes back to 1990. The release represents the total output of the Congressional Research Service (CRS) electronically available to Congressional offices. The CRS is Congress&#8217;s analytical agency and has a budget in excess of $100M per year. </p>
<p>Open government lawmakers such as Senators John McCain (R-Arizona) and Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vermont) have fought for years to make the reports public, with bills being introduced&#8211;and rejected&#8211;almost every year since 1998. The CRS, as a branch of Congress, is exempt from the Freedom of Information Act. </p>
<p>CRS reports are highly regarded as non-partisan, in-depth, and timely. The reports top the list of the &#8220;10 Most-Wanted Government Documents&#8221; compiled by the Washington based Center for Democracy and Technology. The Federation of American Scientists, in pushing for the reports to be made public, stated that the &#8220;CRS is Congress&#8217; Brain and it&#8217;s useful for the public to be plugged into it.&#8221; </p>
<p>Although all CRS reports are legally in the public domain, they are quasi-secret because the CRS, as a matter of policy, makes the reports available only to members of Congress, Congressional committees and select sister agencies such as the GAO.<br />Members of Congress are free to selectively release CRS reports to the public but are only motivated to do so when they feel the results would assist them politically. Universally embarrassing reports are kept quiet. </p>
<p>Each time the topic of opening up the reports comes up, it runs into walls erected by opposing lawmakers such as Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska), who &#8220;like many members of Congress, views CRS as an extension of his staff.&#8221;</p>
<p>However that hasn&#8217;t stopped a grey market forming around the documents. Opportunists smuggle out nearly all reports and sell them to cashed up special interests&#8211;lobbyists, law firms, multi-nationals, and presumably, foreign governments. Congress has turned a blind eye to special interest access, while continuing to vote down public access. </p>
<p>Opposition to public availability comes not only from members of Congress but, also, from within the CRS. </p>
<p>One might think that the CRS, as an agency of the Library of Congress, would institutionally support having a wider audience. But an internal memo reveals the CRS lobbying against bills (S. Res. 54 and H.R. 3630) which would have given the public access to its reports (Project on Government Secrecy, FAS, 2003)[5].<br />The primary line pushed by the CRS is the one that appeals most to Congressional members&#8211;open publication would prevent spin control. The memo states this in delicate terms, referring to such spin failures as &#8220;Impairment of Member Communication with Constituents&#8221;. </p>
<p>Of course the CRS doesn&#8217;t really care about politicians facing much needed voter discipline, but it does have reasons of its own to avoid public oversight. Institutionally, the CRS has established an advisory relationship with members of Congress similar to the oversight-free relationship established between intelligence agencies and the office of the President. </p>
<p>Free from meaningful public oversight of its work, the CRS, as &#8220;Congress&#8217;s brain&#8221;, is able to influence Congressional outcomes, even when its reports contain errors. Arguably, its institutional power over congress is second only to the parties themselves. Public oversight would reduce its ability to exercise that influence without criticism. That is why it opposes such oversight, and that is why such oversight must be established immediately. </p>
<p>In 1913 Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis, a forceful proponent for open government, stated &#8220;Sunlight is the best disinfectant; electric light the most efficient policeman&#8221;. Those wise words are still true today</p>
