<div>Romney didn&#8217;t apologize for [his] comments, instead he doubled down, saying that his opponent, President Barack Obama, believes in &#8220;redistributing wealth,&#8221; while &#8220;we believe in free people and free enterprise.&#8221;
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Democrats &#8220;believe you have to take from some and give to others. I don&#8217;t believe in that,&#8221; he said, repeating the same theme.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>&#8220;I believe America was built on the principle of government caring for those in need but getting out of the way and allowing free people to pursue their dreams,&#8221; Romney said. &#8220;Free people pursing free enterprises is the only way we&#8217;ll create a strong and growing middle class and the only way we&#8217;ll help people out of poverty.&#8221;
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>&#8212; Mitt Romney, speaking to Neil Cavuto <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2012/09/18/161364378/in-fox-interview-romney-doubles-down-on-47-percent-comments?ft=1&#038;f=1001">on Fox News today</a>
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Yup. That’s right. Dwight Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy, Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, and Bill Clinton didn’t believe in free people and free enterprise. All <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/16/opinion/sunday/do-tax-cuts-lead-to-economic-growth.html?gwh=5E06CD6CBDC4DD462E65D218F4B5A237">presided over</a> redistribution-of-wealth schemes of the sort that Romney warns against. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Which is why George Romney made so little money in the ‘50s and ‘60s and why America’s economy and American society were so awful all those decades after we abandoned freedom of people and free enterprise after 1929, until George W. Bush restored some of our freedom and our free-enterprise system—but not enough of it.  No wonder George Romney left the auto industry for government.  He wanted to make some money!
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>We need to end this redistribution-of-wealth thing completely!  Forever! I don’t see why we have to tax people like Mitt Romney <i>at all</i>. Why does Romney want to reduce their taxes just 20% further?  I demand an answer! Free people pursing free enterprises is the only way we&#8217;ll create a strong and growing middle class.  Which is why we weren’t able to do that between the 1920s and the 2000s!</div>
<div>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Poor Warren Buffett, Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, and others so hampered by our non-free-enterprise system during the decades preceding 2001, toiling under Communist rule and longing for freedom and a non-redistributive economic system.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>&#8212;-
</p>
</div>
<div>Seriously, folks.  If Obama doesn’t remove this straw man from this economic-history savant’s arsenal of parading apparitions by the end of the day tomorrow, I’ll be really frustrated.

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Following the release of the video of Romney denouncing (among other things) the fact that 47% of  US households don&#8217;t pay positive US Federal Income Taxes many normally reliable commentators have argued that this is a break from the long Republican tradition of advocating tax cuts for the working poor to make work pay.  I think this demonstrates incorrect recollection of the history of such tax cuts, although it is true of one important tax cut &#8212; the child tax credit which was part of the 2001 Bush tax cuts.</p>
<p>But there seems to be a widespread belief that the EITC was significantly expanded (or even created) by Republicans (OK Ford signed the bill).  It was introduced in 1975 at at time when Democrats had huge majorities in both houses of Congress.  It was massively expanded in 1993 by the Clinton tax bill which was supported by no (not one,zero,nessuno) Republican in Congress.  Reagan and Clngress (including the Democratic majority in the house) increased the payroll tax.  That is a tax which Romney tends to assert doesn&#8217;t exist, but a dollar of payroll taxes is as much of a disincentive to work as a dollar of income tax.</p>
<p>To try to understand the changes I turn to <a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w12404.pdf?new_window=1">Piketty and Saez (warning pdf) </a>and in particular Table A3 &#8220;Average Tax Rates by Income Groups 1960-2004.&#8221;  I will mainly look at the sum of the individual income tax and the payroll tax.  My claims</p>
<p>1)The sum of tax rates on low incomes increased under Reagan (the payroll tax increase outweighed income tax cuts)</p>
<p>2) That sum of rates was sharply cut from 1993 to 1995 (by the bill with no Republican support)</p>
<p>3) The average income tax rate on low incomes changed little from 1996 to 1998 &#8212; welfare reform did not include significant tax cuts for the poor.</p>
<p>4) the sum declined sharply from 2001 to 2004</p>
<p>The table is huge and I will try to cut out comprehensible parts after the jump</p>

<p>Romney <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/09/secret-video-romney-private-fundraiser">claims</a> that that the 47% of the people that don’t pay federal income tax are a lost cause. They are simply moochers and looters that “are dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims, who believe the government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you-name-it.” They’re part of the problem, in his mind, and there is nothing he can do to help them because they refuse to help themselves. </p>
<p>But as <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2012/09/nontaxpayers-are-overwhelmingly-the-eldery-and-students.html">Mark Thoma shows</a>, the vast majority of people that don’t pay federal income tax (which is only just a part of federal taxes) are either students or the elderly. The elderly, in particular, do not pay income or payroll taxes on the meager payout of Social Security. </p>
<p>This from <a href="http://www.hamiltonproject.org/papers/the_truth_about_taxes_just_about_everyone_pays_them/">the Hamilton Project</a>:</p>
<p><a href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/-j3ZC-zCWtDk/UFjA-aXt2iI/AAAAAAAABDI/DIRLukStMYk/s1600-h/clip_image001%25255B3%25255D.gif"><img alt="clip_image001" border="0" height="186" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/-Hk1-pCuIa4g/UFjA-3xiZxI/AAAAAAAABDQ/XNiNAYJy5n4/clip_image001_thumb.gif?imgmax=800" title="clip_image001" width="244"></a></p>

<p>The irony of this, though, is that older Americans are the group most likely to vote for Republicans! Here are <a href="http://sailerfraud.blogspot.com/2010/11/2010-election-analysis-race-sex-age.html">exit poll data</a> from the 2010 election cycle:</p>

<p>Will Romney’s attempt to characterize older folks as parasites turn them off of the GOP? I doubt it, but it’s a funny way to do outreach.</p>

<p>I have mentioned from time to time the repeated Gallup polls showing strong support for tax progressivity.  this is not a new phenomenon, Gallup started asking the questions in 1992.<br />I tend to give an almost worthless link to pollingreport.com but I have finally looked up a <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/117472/say-low-income-americans-paying-fair-share-taxes.aspx">decent link</a></p>
<p>There is little support for RomneyRage at lower income lucky duckies who don&#8217;t pay enough</p>

<p>In dramatic contrast, most US adults feel that upper income people are paying too little</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>
<div>This summer’s widespread drought has been extremely hard on Midwestern and plains-states crop farmers, and many of them are chafing at the thought of <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0912/81333.html?hp=f2">having to take responsibility for their own lives</a> if <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agricultural_subsidy">the Farm Bill </a>doesn’t make it through Congress before the upcoming recess.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>They had panicked earlier in the summer when Congress was dallying in passing an emergency relief bill, but were rescued from having to take responsibility for their own lives when the Republican-controlled House agreed at the last minute before Congress’s August recess to allow the farmers—including some who won’t be paying income tax for this year unless those federal subsidies increase their incomes enough—to mooch off the likes of Mitt Romney and his son Tagg, <a href="http://www.solameregroup.com/">whom Romney convinced to take responsibility for himself</a>. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Which Tagg did, by borrowing a reported (if I recall correctly) $10 million from his parents to start a (very) private equity firm whose investors apparently all, or almost all, were people who’d made their fortunes through investments with Bain Capital. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Tagg is a role model for young people just starting out today who want to take responsibility for themselves.  His father suggested last winter that other young people should emulate the son: “Start a business.  Borrow money from your parents, if you have to,” Romney told a group of them.  Or something like that.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>In that same speech, he advised young people to “get that education.”  Presumably, by having their parents pay their tuition and expenses.  Like Mitt Romney himself did.  And like all his kids did.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>No silver spoon for the Romneys, though.  No sir. Just personal responsibility. Unlike all those farmers in Kansas, Nebraska and Indiana who are part of Obama’s base.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Then, of course, there the Medicare recipients who refuse to take responsibility for their lives by paying their healthcare costs, or at least the part of their healthcare costs that exceed the amounts they’d paid into the fund over the years. People who think they’re entitled to healthcare.  And, probably, to you-name-it.
</p>
<p>
<div>&#8212;&#8211;
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>UPDATE: A commenter on another blog pointed out that Israelis, whose healthcare system Romney praised during his July overseas rollout, are similar to Obama supporters in that they think they’re entitled to healthcare. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>For that matter, so are Poles, who’s free-enterprise culture Romney praised during that same overseas trip.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>And, now that I think about it, so do the Australians, Austrians, Germans, Japanese, Dutch, Taiwanese, and the citizens of quite a few other countries that are known for their people’s feelings of victimhood and socialist freeloading. 
</p>
<p>
<div>SECOND UPDATE:I’m copying here the three comments posted to this post:

<div>I sure hope people like Boeing don&#8217;t catch wind of this, or any other massive company type people who do not pay taxes.

<div>This blog told me earlier that the Farm Bill was welfare for Agribusiness. Now it&#8217;s just for &#8220;regular&#8221; farmers in Kansas, Nebraska and Indiana? Hmmm.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>

</div>
<div>No, john, my post doesn&#8217;t say that the Farm Bill is just for regular farmers. It&#8217;s also for agribusinesses, who, as Elliot points out, are people too. And some of them may not pay taxes, and the rest pay taxes at, I guess, about the rate that Romney did for 2010.</p>
<p>Presumably, the ones who pay no taxes will vote for Obama in the hope of avoiding taking personal (they&#8217;re people, after all) responsibility for themselves.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>So sorry; I couldn’t resist.

                            <div class="content">
                                <div>I was forwarded an early look at a survey that was produced by George Washington University&#8217;s School of Political Management in conjunction with Thumbtack.com.  As some readers know, I am an honest to goodness small business owner.  Two business actually and they are as different as say a private practice physician and a florist.  So&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;I guess this is what has lead to a request of me to opine on this survey&#8217;s results.</div>
<div></div>
<div><a href="http://cdn-1.thumbtackstatic.com/media/_survey/politics-2012/v1/GWU-Thumbtack-Political-Sentiment-Survey.pdf" target="_blank">GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY –THUMBTACK.COM SMALL BUSINESS POLITICAL SENTIMENT SURVEY:</a></div>
<div><a href="http://cdn-1.thumbtackstatic.com/media/_survey/politics-2012/v1/GWU-Thumbtack-Political-Sentiment-Survey.pdf">METHODOLOGY &#038; ANALYSIS</a></div>
<div></div>
<div>I googled Thumbtack.com.  I had never heard of them.  There is some controversy out their regarding their business model.  Yet, Thumbtack.com claims 250K users.  The survey was of 6000 plus of their members.  They have taken some steps to assure their sampling represents the distribution of small business throughout the nation.  I&#8217;m going to trust that GW&#8217;s school knows how to do and produce a scientifically valid survey.  Thumbtack.com had teamed up with Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation early this year. <a href="http://cdn-1.thumbtackstatic.com/media/_survey/Thumbtack_Survey_Methodology.pdf" target="_blank">This work</a> attempted to come up with a ranking of business friendliness based on the experiences of small business within a given state.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The headline, take away finding is presented as follows:</div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><div>40% of all small business owners nationwide rate the economy and jobs as the most important factor in choosing a president. Ethics, honesty, and corruption in government is the second-most important factor for small businesses.  </div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>Considering ethics, honesty and corruption came in at 15% and the next item to be ranked the top issue was so ranked by 6% with the percentages becoming smaller to 2% for the issue of foreign policy I would say  40% ranking the economy and jobs the number one issue is kind of an intuitively expected finding because every other issue considered in the survey fell so far behind.  After all, we are talking business owners.</div>
<div></div>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<div>I&#8217;m not going to take issue with the findings or the methodology though, do feel free to comment on such as it can only help the discussion.  My issue is with the “issues” used as the subjects of the survey questions.  I am confident that this survey did find what it states it found.  I believe though that it could not find anything other than what it found in that the issues presented are presented in the language regularly heard over the last 12 years and in some cases 20 or 30 years.  You combine such presentation with the ability to answer with opinion and you get findings that for me simply confirm that political messaging has value.  We are talking the GWU&#8217;s School of Political Management.</div>
<div></div>
<div>For example, asking what is the most important sub issue regarding the economy you get to choose from:  </div>
<div>Federal budget deficit</div>
<div>Financial and banking system</div>
<div>Gas/fuel prices</div>
<div>Health care costs</div>
<div>Home values and the housing market</div>
<div>Inflation/rising prices</div>
<div>No opinion</div>
<div>Other</div>
<div>Personal debt</div>
<div></div>
<div>Social Security</div>
<div>Student Loans</div>
<div>Taxes</div>
<div>Unemployment and the job market</div>
<div></div>
<div>Is there anything you see on this list that is not discussed or presented by our MSM as something their viewers or readers or listeners should be concerned about? “Other” does not count.  I have never heard the MSM present an article suggesting that “Other” is something a small business person should be aware of.   </div>
<div></div>
<div>Do you know what is missing from this list?  How about:  Income inequality?  How about: Your area&#8217;s average income?  How about: Reduced Government Spending within your market area?  Let&#8217;s be blunt.  How about: No customers? </div>
<div></div>
<div>Unemployment and the job market did reach number one for 26.55% of the respondents.  I&#8217;m sure small business owners understand they can&#8217;t obtain their business goals in a high unemployment/low job development area as easily can be done in the opposite environment, but really, even low priced Walmart is loosing to even lower priced Dollar Stores.   There is only one reason for this: declining average income, yet there is nothing in this survey that got at this issue. For me, as an expert in small business do to my being a small business having to deal with no customers just seems to drive me to think a whole lot broader about my place within the social puzzle.  Did I mention I have small business owner friends?  Eighty three percent of the members of my band are small business owners.  The other 17% is a government employee. Customers, the idea, the concept of &#8220;customer&#8221; is the base concept for any business, never mind just small business.  It&#8217;s an actual MSM issue too.   Well, at least the customer aspect related to wages.     </div>
<div></div>
<div>Here is what lead me down this path such that my interpretation of this survey (and their prior survey) are nothing more than a confirmation, regurgitation of the MSM sound bite news: taxes.  Taxes are at the bottom of importance over all.  Just 2% ranked it as the number one issue.  One might say that such a ranking invalidates my opinion.  Except, 5.8% ranked it as the number one sub issue on the economy.  It is ranked higher than everything but: Unemployment/job market, Fed budget/debt, healthcare cost, finance/banking, , inflation/rising prices. (listed high to low)   </div>
<div></div>
<div>But, it was not the answer to the question of what subcategory of the economy was important that nailed it for me.  That just got my curiosity up.  Taxes are big with the MSM so why has society&#8217;s segment known as “small business” not ranked this higher?</p>
<p> I present to you page 22 of the linked report: How important are the following issues to the success of your business?” </p></div>
<div>Answered as “Very Important” are the following:</div>
<div>Tax rates and tax related regulation  52%</div>
<div>State Small Business Incentives: 49%</div>
<div>Federal Small Business Incentives: 45%</div>
<div></div>
<div>I now present to you page 23:  “How burdensome are the following costs to your business?”  </div>
<div>Answered as &#8220;Very Burdensome&#8221; <br />Self employment taxes  49%</div>
<div>Personal Income taxes 42%</div>
<div>Social Security tax  39%</div>
<div>Only one item beat these three: Gas/fuel costs 59%</div>
<div></div>
<div>Are you seeing a disconnect here?  I am.  Do you think the respondents are complaining about the burden of taxes while they keep in mind that they are concerned about government incentives?  Am I to believe that the concern about incentives for these members of society is that they are to much, especially when they are saying they are important to their business success?  Yet over all, “taxes” only ranked the number one issue for 2% of those 6000 plus members surveyed?  Now go read the survey that came out before this one.  Try to gel the best ranked states with the lack of concern in this election for taxes.</div>
<div></div>
<div>There is some hope here with this survey and it is as big a headline as the 40% that put the economy number 1.  Minimum Wage.  64% said it was NOT burdensome or  NOT SO burdensome.</p>
<p>Actually, it&#8217;s a bigger headline&#8230;isn&#8217;t it<span a="a" bigger="bigger" headline...isn="headline...isn" it="it" span="span" t="t">?</div>

<div></div>
<div>&#8220;[The] weirdest part of the anti-semitic tropes on the [Maureen] Dowd column is how lazy they are,&#8221; Max Fisher, an editor at The Atlantic who is leaving to launch a foreign policy blog at the Washington Post, <a href="https://twitter.com/Max_Fisher/status/247375581950402560">tweeted</a>.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Apparently, mimicking Mitt Romney’s pot-calling-the-kettle-black habit has become quite the thing this season among conservatives.  Or maybe Fisher <i>did </i>investigate and has learned that Williamson and Bolton really <i>have</i>converted to Judaism.

<div>Oh, and by the way: I’m Jewish.  Happy <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/celebrating-rosh-hashanah/2012/09/16/f3a8cb8c-0045-11e2-9367-4e1bafb958db_gallery.html#photo=1">new year</a>.

                                <p>I was hopeful that some of our better-known companions would be smart enough to ignore the attempt by McMegan (University of Pennsylvania, Bachelor&#8217;s in English Literature, mid-1990s) to argue, in a magazine that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tina_Brown">aspires to be <em>People</em></a>, that going to college—and most especially getting a degree in the Liberal Arts—is not cost-effective.  We can forgive Felix; getting to write a riff <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2012/09/10/the-necessity-of-a-college-education/">such as this one</a> is like fiddling with your guitar and coming up with &#8220;Sweet Emotion&#8221; or &#8220;Take Five&#8221; or &#8220;Pennsylvania 6-5000,&#8221; even with the occasional clunker conditional.  Sadly, though, Brad did <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2012/09/felix-salmon-on-the-benefits-of-a-college-education.html">his imitation of Mark-Thoma-when-pressed-for-time</a>, pulling greatest hits and writing a lede that is more analgesic than enlightening.  So let&#8217;s think about the Big Employment Picture.  What can you (1) study in college, (2) learn reasonably well in four years, and (3) still practice with a reasonable certainty that your job will not be outsourced in twenty years?  Let&#8217;s start with eliminating the easy things:  Technology.  Think of all the people who have been programmers for a couple of decades, starting with Fortran or C or even COBOL. (Remember the jokes about the COBOL programmer who works in preparation for the millennium, has himself cryogenically frozen, and is thawed out in 9998? Ask anyone who works IT for, say, an Insurance Company if they don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s realistic.)  Those people are already losing their jobs to Indians who aren&#8217;t paid the equivalent of US$40,000 a year who have IIT degrees.  Engineering:  Even less reliable employment than Technology and, again, already being outsourced.  Mathematics: Anyone really want to claim this is non-rival good?  Sure, if you&#8217;re <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2012/05/16/1206569109.abstract">Press and Dyson</a>, maybe. But we already know that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srinivasa_Ramanujan">poor Indians have been competing with the rest of the world for a century</a>. Anyone really believe that China, with twice as many secondary school graduates (as a percent of population, let alone overall) cannot produce chimera-Ramanujans, or even just multiple <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morris_Kline">Morris Klines</a>, in the next generation or two?  That&#8217;s three-quarters of the STEM model that is supposed to Save American Jobs: all will face (at best) downward pressure and declining domestic futures under current tenets.  What will be a stable career?  My ex-roommate points to <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/economy/the-world-according-to-tyler-cowen/article4534964/">Tyler Cowen in the Globe and Mail</a>:<br />
<blockquote>[Q:]Can advances in AI create great numbers of jobs?  [Cowen:]No. A lot of people will be hurt by it. <i>Owners of intellectual property</i>, and capital and manufacturing plants will do very well. Output will go up a lot. But in many areas, wages will fall and jobs will disappear. So the U.S. trend – falling labour force participating rates – will continue. But people who get quality education will be better off. [emphasis mine]</p></blockquote>
<p> Not everyone will be born as the son of a Governor or a Captain of Industry; most of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willard_Romney">those</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Romer">people</a> will have doors opened for them naturally, in the manner of <a href="http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/people/person.asp?personId=26536972&#038;ticker=BSC:PM">this classmate of Barack Obama&#8217;s</a> who has led <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/money/economy/housing/story/2012-05-14/ally-financial-rescap-bankruptcy/54950498/1">his current company</a> in the manner of <a href="http://www.teribuhl.com/tag/tom-marano/">his previous one</a>.  So the last two are out.  That leaves us with the italicized section above.  Who are the &#8220;owners of intellectual property.&#8221;  Well—initially—it&#8217;s the creator of art.  For all the films made in India, very few match the worldwide appeal and box office command of <a href="http://boxofficemojo.com/alltime/world/">the U.S. industry</a>.  Similarly, while <a href="http://www.groveatlantic.com/?title=John+Saturnall's+Feast">Lawrence Norfolk&#8217;s latest novel</a> means I stopped reading everything else (well, except for Press and Dyson, above) on this New Year, it&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/John-Saturnalls-Feast-Lawrence-Norfolk/dp/0802120512">Amazon rank</a> tells us that almost 23,000 other people are buying more copies of something else from them.  Even musicians are finding that controlling their catalog is more important—and lucrative—than signing with a label in this era of pump and dump. Or, as Chris O&#8217;Leary noted:<br />
<blockquote>Bowie had been built, in part, by RCA and EMI, by their worldwide sales channels, their sacks of promotional dollars. The labels had been irritated about putting out a Low or a Tin Machine, but they still bought trade ads and in-store promo material for them, they still made the records available for someone in Kankakee to buy, they still had pushed them on the radio, if indifferently. If clueless and occasionally corrupt, the dinosaur labels that had released the bulk of Bowie’s oeuvre had provided a level of patronage that’s inconceivable for a musician of Bowie’s bent today&#8230;he spent the Nineties as a free agent, jumping from label to label, sometimes going it alone, always on the hustle, and so offering a preview of the lot of the average pro musician in 2012.</p></blockquote>
<p>The model has changed, with most songwriters and performers knowing better than—or learning quickly not—to sell &#8220;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Plain-Simple-Guide-Music-Publishing/dp/0634090542">publishing rights</a>&#8221; to a label that will attempt to treat them &#8220;<a href="http://www.salon.com/2000/08/28/work_for_hire/">as work for hire</a>.&#8221;  What are the jobs least able to be outsourced?  Writer. Musician. Artist. Filmmaker. (It&#8217;s probably not coincident that Bowie&#8217;s son is <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1182345/">making</a> <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0945513/">movies</a>.) Exactly the jobs that McMegan is telling people to avoid.  Perhaps speaking autobiographically, she declares:<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;It’s very easy to spend four years majoring in English literature and beer pong and come out no more employable than you were before you went in,&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p> As Felix Salmon notes (also quoted by DeLong), &#8220;That’s only true if you somehow contrive to drop out of college at the very last possible minute.&#8221; Otherwise, to borrow a term from microeconomics, you have &#8220;signaled&#8221; that you can complete something you started, which makes employers who don&#8217;t want to sell half-finished products (that is, all of them) much happier than the alternative.  McArdle&#8217;s piece wasn&#8217;t just bad analysis; it&#8217;s bad economics. You would think that someone with an MBA (even if it is from the University of Chicago) would know better.</p>

Go on the web.&#8221;</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t indignantly reply that I am lazy not obtuse.  So the race was on &#8212; google codice postale (no need to go to google googling is the chrome default).  OK on the site.  What&#8217;s the problem.  Just type 1 word &#8220;volta&#8221; yes got it. </p>
<p>R: Hah Kathy the zip code is &#8230;&#8221;<br />K: 00153</p>
<p>A googling dead heat. </p>
<p>Right at this moment my daughter Kathy is surpassing me in google fu.</p>
<p>Reminds me of when her older sister Marina was 18 months old and surpassed me in speaking Italian.</p>
