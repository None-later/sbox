                                <p><a href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/thecrypt/0808/GOP_Oil_markets_responding_to_our_protest.html">The Crypt</a> reports:</p>
<blockquote><p>House Republicans issued the boldest claim yet in their three-day energy protest, insinuating on Tuesday morning that their demonstration may in fact have already begun to lower gas prices. “The market is responding to the fact that we are here talking,” said Republican Rep. John Shadegg. “I think the market realizes that this kind of pressure may in fact lead to a change in policy.” Speaking to reporters before entering the House chamber for a third day of speeches calling for votes on domestic oil drilling, GOP members said they had no plans to end the protest, which began when House Democrats adjourned for the summer last Friday.  Oil prices did fall $2.18 on Tuesday, however, analysts told the Associated Press that the fall was due expectations the economic downturn in the U.S. will erode consumer demand and the weakening of Tropical Storm Edouard in the Gulf of Mexico.</p></blockquote>
<p>Actually, I think Shadegg is onto something.  OK, recessions lower energy demand and <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2008/08/speculation-and.html">Mark Thoma</a> comments on the Tropical Storm Edouard effect:</p>
<blockquote><p>Suppose you think that a hurricane might disrupt oil flows in the future. What should you do today? Tropical storm Edouardo gives an example. As the storm approached, people believed there was a chance that oil flows would be disrupted in the future, and the current price began rising as a consequence. If you expect a higher price in the future due to reduced supply or any other reason, you should begin purchasing and storing oil now to take advantage of the higher price in the future, and the increased demand for oil drives today&#8217;s price up.</p></blockquote>
<p>Fortunately for those who wish to purchase gasoline – all that GOP hot air likely pushed back on the winds from Tropical storm Edouardo.  And I bet some key economic decision makers went into despair when they heard the stupidity emanating from Congress, which of course increased the likelihood of a deeper recession.  Well done Congress.  <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/08/05/deep-voodoo">Paul Krugman</a> takes this one step further:</p>
<blockquote><p>In other news, Republicans credited their speeches for the fact that the sun rose today.</p></blockquote>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>(Erroneously put up as XXXVII)<br />Prior to 2004 Social Security Crisis was explained with a simple narrative: Boomers retire placing enormous strain on system, Trust Funds go bankrupt in short order, checks stop. Result? Social Security won&#8217;t be there for me.</p>
<p>This storyline was always nonsense, as long as payroll tax is being collected benefits would be paid out at some level. And on examination of the numbers it was clear that the result would still be better in real terms than today. But these facts flew mostly under the radar, and given that no one was actually proposing anything concrete social security supporters by and large just kept their powder dry. Until Bush declared war in November 2004.</p>
<p>The result was the &#8216;There is No Crisis&#8217; battle of Spring &#038; Summer 2005 with the result being a near total rout of the crisismongers. They simply were not prepared with real numbers, instead they brought rhetorical rubber knives to an economic gunfight. Faced with the reality that Trust Fund depletion was not projected until 2041, well after the peak impact of Boomer retirement, and that depletion did not in fact equate to &#8216;bankrupt&#8217; or &#8216;flat broke&#8217; they retreated from Crisis at Depletion to Crisis at Shortfall.</p>
<p>Shortfall refers to that time when Social Security receipts from payroll tax and tax on benefit falls behind cost. We should note that this doesn&#8217;t mean that total Income falls behind Cost at shortfall, interest is still accrued on the Trust Fund balances, but shortfall does mark the point that cash transfers have to be made from the General Fund to pay a portion of Social Security benefits. Crisismongers generally present this as some massive fiscal shock requiring huge tax increases or massive benefit cuts leading commenters to ask questions like this:<br />
<blockquote>Movie Guy: &#8220;I&#8217;m interested in knowing, though, what we will say when it&#8217;s time for the U.S. Congress to pay back some of the borrowed monies during the next decade (based on current funding rates). Which discretionary programs will take the hit or will new taxes be applied to offset the Federal Budget shortfalls that may occur?&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Well the short answer is that it may not be necessary either to cut other discretionary programs or raise income taxes. To see why we have to start with the actual numbers in question. Which are to be found below the fold.</p>
<p>Social Security reports future numbers in two forms. Current dollars are the actual cash dollars needed in that future year. Constant dollars adjust that for inflation and so are the better measure for assessing relative impact. Crisismongers will always use current dollars because they are scarier, so I propose to use both.<br /><a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/VI_OASDHI_dollars.html#150920">Table VI.F8.—Operations of the Combined OASI and DI Trust Funds, in Current Dollars, Calendar Years 2008-85 [In billions]</a><br /><a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/VI_OASDHI_dollars.html#140103">Table VI.F7.—Operations of the Combined OASI and DI Trust Funds, in Constant 2008 Dollars, Calendar Years 2008-85 [In billions]</a><br />These tables give annual numbers for needed transfers to or from the General Fund for the first ten years and then in five year intervals after that. Coincidentally Shortfall is projected for year ten or 2017, meaning that all these numbers represent transfers from the General Fund. Numbers are in billions.</p>
<p>Year:::::Current:::::Constant<br />2017:::$24:::::::::::$19<br />2020:::$107:::::::::$77<br />2025:::$275:::::::::$172<br />2030:::$471:::::::::$257<br />2035:::$656:::::::::$313<br />2040:::$808:::::::::$335<br />2045:::$0::::::::::::$0</p>
<p>With war costs FY 2009 deficits are projected to be about $600 billion. So adjusted for inflation amounts of just over half of current year borrowing would be needed to pay for Social Security in the years after 2032. If we make serious attempts to control General Fund spending and most importantly get overall health care costs under control, the cost of Financing Shortfall is not some crippling blow requiring massive cuts in discretionary spending, it can be financed like we have been financing General Fund deficits all along-by borrowing. Now sure as shooting someone will jump up crying &#8216;Current account deficit!!&#8217;. Well that may or may not be a problem going forward, because we can listen to liberal Mr. Gore or ultraconservative Mr. Pickens and find agreement that we can cut the cost of imported oil drastically over the next ten years and so automatically improving the trade deficit at the same time.</p>
<p>In any event nothing in these numbers suggest that Social Security in and of itself is much of a fiscal challenge. Global warming, Peak Oil, Health Care: huge problems that need immediate attention. Social Security? Not so much.</p>
<p>Note too that these numbers use Intermediate Cost assumptions. Under Low Cost transfers don&#8217;t start until 2023 and are much smaller. If I get time will post those numbers in comments, but if we just take 2035 as a sample and use constant dollars we can see a needed transfer of $160 billion or just about half of IC&#8217;s $313 billion.</p>
<p>(But what is with those $0 figures for 2045? Well I&#8217;ll leave that as an exercise for the reader. My answer will come in comments.)</p>

                                <p>Aguanomic&#8217;s David Zetland is collecting great sources on the rights and economic of water. My time is restricted currently, but think it is worh passing on as it stands.</p>
<p><a href="http://aguanomics.com/2008/08/tp1-favoring-farmers.html">TP1: Favoring Farmers</a></p>
<p>This week, we have a few rants from an anonymous guest (The Teal <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scarlet_Pimpernel">Pimpernel</a>?). Here&#8217;s the first:</p>
<blockquote><p>There is a water conservation bill under consideration right now that your readers really need to understand because it contains some truly awful mathematics. AB2175 says all urban water use in California accounts for 9 million acre feet (one AF equals approximately 326,000 gallons) and demands that urban water users conserve 20% by 2020. It also says California’s huge agribusinesses account for 34 million AF and it requires farmers to take a 1.5% reduction in that amount.In other words, households will have to conserve 1.8 million AF while farmers only have to conserve one half a million AF.The math gets worse. Households pay $1,000 or more for an AF while farmers pay as little as $2. And how is this water used? In households, 45% of the water use is for flushing toilets, 19% for showers and 14% for laundry. Farmers use almost all of the water for irrigation, primarily by flooding fields or spraying it into the air. A full 60% of irrigation water never reaches the crops it was intended to irrigate! That means agriculture wastes 21 million AF every year. That is two and a half times more than all the water used in urban uses.Why do farmers waste so much water? Because it is so cheap. It is as simple as that. California’s entire water problem could be solved with one simple, fast, easy action. That is re-price water according to its real value. Nothing else will solve the water problem so completely. In addition, farmers will shift to higher value crops to recover the new water costs so the value of California agriculture will increase sharply. Everybody wins.</p></blockquote>
<p>David asks: Although I didn&#8217;t write this, I agree with its main points. Do you? (David asks)</p>
<p>Reader Francis replies:<br />
<blockquote>Farmers in Imperial Valley (due east of San Diego) pay about $12 per acre foot for ag. water. Why so cheap? Because it&#8217;s all downhill from Hoover Dam and the water&#8217;s not potable.</p>
<p>Households in San Diego pay about $1,000 per acre foot. Why so expensive? San Diego&#8217;s at the end of a very long pipeline that goes over mountains. (The energy cost of water delivered into LA and points south is enormous.) The water is potable. The system meets fire flow standards. San Diego&#8217;s an expensive place to live, so water department staff get paid accordingly. etc.</p>
<p>Put another way, even if San Diego could take the water currently flowing to Imperial Valley, the price wouldn&#8217;t drop any.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>PGL &#8220;I believe the point was how quickly McCain flipped AFTER receiving those contributions. A point both Sammy and FA chose to ignore in their replies.&#8221;  Actually PGL, he got the donations AFTER the donations</p></blockquote>
<p>I have already pointed out that the troll is criticizing something said by rand.  And it appears rand was correct and the troll was dead wrong as <a href="http://tpmelectioncentral.talkingpointsmemo.com/2008/08/report_hess_execs_ponied_up_hu.php">Greg Sargent</a> notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Los Angeles Times digs up some more detail on the Hess Corporation-McCain story, reporting that the big fundraiser where all the Hess execs chipped in huge sums took place just before McCain reversed his previous opposition to offshore drilling</p></blockquote>
<p>Greg goes onto to note that the timing is less of an issue than some would have it to be.  Big Oil knows that McCain will do their bidding – even if that means flip-flopping on positions McCain took earlier when McCain wanted to be seen as the moderate maverick.  Which is why their money is flowing into the coffers of Team McCain.  But the trolls will find some way to defend this – even if it means telling us a bunch of their usual lies. Or maybe they’ll find some way to blame Obama for McCain’s actions!</p>

                                <p>The always smart Kevin Drum <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2008_08/014222.php">writes </a></p>
<blockquote><p>The windfall profits tax is a dumb idea, and I wish Obama didn&#8217;t support it, but I guess politics is politics. It&#8217;s not the biggest deal in the world.</p></blockquote>
<p>I asked in comments what&#8217;s so dumb about a windfall profits tax.  I haven&#8217;t checked how many commenters responded to me, but some which I&#8217;ve found are after the jump.</p>
<p>My thoughts on a windfall profits tax on Oil companies (I consider an additional rebate a separate issue).</p>
<p>I start with the simplest assumptions so it is assumed that the tax won&#8217;t affect incentives, because it refers to the past and it is assumed to be a one off move (starting simple).  Also assume the very old theory of the firm which acts in shareholders interest and is not liquidity constrained.   In that case, the tax is a tax on oil company shareholders who are (including people with 401(k)&#8217;s) relatively rich.  So I like it. </p>
<p>It seems, see below, that oil companies are passing their profits to shareholders through share buybacks.  I think this helps support the old theory of the firm assumption.  However, if they insistend on reinvesting profits, I would consider that an additional reason for the windfall profits tax.  Last time they had a windfall (the second oil shock due to the Iranian revolution and the Iran-Iraq war) they decided to diversify and made some of the least productive investments in US history.  Have you ever heard of Exxon office systems ?  Big investment in smart typewriters which were like pc&#8217;s but dumber and ten times as expensive.  Oil companies handle oil.  They are not suited to act as investment bankers and, still less, as venture capitalists.  generally high profits are a sign of skillful management which maybe can improve firms they take over.  In this case, it was dumb luck.  I&#8217;d say stock buybacks are the lesser waste, but reducing the deficit would be much nicer.</p>
<p>Now what if they assume that this is the first in a series.  Often confiscation now and never again would be good policy if the promise were credible.  The belief that there will be more windfall profit taxes in the future seems to me to be desireable.  It means that Oil companies don&#8217;t gain as much when the price of oil goes up.  Since they are imperfectly competetive, it seems to me that this would drive their actions twoards the social optimum.  For example, if they aren&#8217;t helped with oil prices go up, they won&#8217;t oppose a carbon tax so fiercely.  Also actual investment in alternative fuels now has the cost that production of alternative fuels causes the price of oil to decline.  The threat (or promise) of further windfall profits taxes would increase their incentives to invest in alternative fuels.  If designed rationally (see below) it would also increase their incentive to look for oil (which isn&#8217;t so key if there really isn&#8217;t so much left to be found).</p>
<p>I&#8217;d propose making a forecast for Oil holdings (inventories including proven reserves underground, crude in tankers and tanks and unsold petroleum products) and tax alpha times the price times this quantity from oil companies (with alpha positive but less than one).  If the forecasts were exact, this would make the oil companies act as if they were perfectly competative.  They won&#8217;t be, but so long as they are not so optimistic as to drive a company bankrupt, the costs of forecast errors will be a transfer plus something second order in the forecast errors.  No such policy is like making a forecast of zero which is worse even than my forecasts.</p>
<p>OK at least one flame war from Drum&#8217;s site</p>
<p>The problem with a windfall profits tax is that it is the kind of ad hoc solution that Obama criticized when it took the form of a gas tax holiday. It may be a more effective gimmick, but it&#8217;s still a gimmick: pure pander.<br />Posted by: lampwick on August 4, 2008 at 12:21 PM | PERMALINK</p>
<p>Huh ? more like the opposite.  Given that Oil refining and pumping are close to capacity, a gas tax holiday is similar to a windfall profits subsidy not tax.  Both are ad hoc, but they have opposite effects.  I would consider an argument that there is something wrong with a windfall profits tax to be an argument that something bad will happen if one is imposed.</p>
<blockquote><p>[snip]<br />Big Oil&#8217;s profits by percentage are far less than Google&#8217;s, for example. Google&#8217;s profit is around 25%. Now there&#8217;s a windfall. Why aren&#8217;t we taxing them extra heavy? No way they should be making that much money when there are starving people out there.<br />[snip]</p></blockquote>

<p>This is interesting.  First many of my arguments apply to an increase in price and not to increase in production (searches for google I guess).  Second the windfall was a windfall (the behavior of inventories suggest that Oil company executives didn&#8217;t even see it coming as, say, Kevin Drum did).  The google guys have demonstrated an ability to create wealth.  I really like the idea of google venture capital.  They got money by being very smart.  I suspect that they will do smart things with it and won&#8217;t capture all of they wealth they create.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not sure I want oil companies working on renewables.  Why do we think they are better suited to manage that than other firms (I love what Shell is doing by the way) ?  I am more pro market than lampwick so I think incentives to invest in renewables should be those implied by a carbon tax and not directed at any particular firms.</p>
<p>Remember the last time we based tax policy on resentment (hint did a plurality of Americans tell a Clinton pollster that they supported increased taxes on the rich to fund waste fraud and abuse).  I&#8217;d say that the record of US tax policy based on resentment is, as a general rule, excellent.</p>

<blockquote>There already is a tax on that &#8220;windfall.&#8221; It&#8217;s called the corporate income tax, and Big Oil is currently paying Uncle Sam to the tune of billions as their profits skyrocket. The proposal to effectively increase the corporate tax rate on a specific industry is unwise because consumers will pay for the tax increase in the form of higher fuel bills (as energy companies reduce exploration and development budgets). They&#8217;ll also &#8220;pay&#8221; to the extent that energy stocks are found in their portfolios.</p></blockquote>

<p>a windfall profits tax isn&#8217;t just an increased tax on profits.  It depends on the price times inventories not production minus costs.  My proposal would, if anything, increase the incentives to oil companies to explore and develope oil fields.  Someone in a thred below pointed out that average != marginal.  I think Jasper really doesn&#8217;t understand that, but it could be that he assumes that the windfall part will be a fraud and will be perceived to be a fraud.</p>
<blockquote><p>Yes, the windfall tax is a bad idea, and the energy rebate is even worse. We&#8217;re at a sad state when we count on stipends from the government to help spur the economy. What we need are policy changes that will impact how people buy and use energy in the long-term, not a panacea fix.</p></blockquote>

<p>Yes we must make the best the enemy of the good.  Plus Keynesianism unbuilds character.</p>
<p>Someone notes that Becker and or Posner claim that the windfall profits tax was not good policy.  Support for their assertion is missing.  But the great part is this</p>
<p>.. &#8220;I was careful with my reference not to use a right wing source for the argument. Unless Becker-Posner is a right wing source.&#8221;</p>
<p>The scary thing is that I don&#8217;t think the commenter was joking.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not done with the thread but I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ve exhausted your patience. </p>

<blockquote><p>ExxonMobil bought back $29 billion of its own stock in 2006, $28 billion in 2007 and has already bought back $16 billion in the first half of 2008. Even so, it reports $39 billion in cash on hand and is all but certain to report more than $40billion in profit, along with $32 billion in stock buybacks, for all of 2008.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>For instance, Exxon refuses to help pay for a pipeline to transport plentiful Alaskan natural gas that goes unused, demanding a better tax deal from the state. It backed out of a deal with Qatar last year to turn natural gas into diesel fuel. It spends nothing on production or development of renewable energy.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>Unlike U.S.-based companies, Shell initially reports its profit percentage as return on capital. Its 24.5% figure shows how profitable the oil business actually is, said Consumer Watchdog. Exxon and others will initially spin their profit as a percentage of revenue, a smaller and grossly misleading figure. Last year, Exxon reported to major investors and the SEC that its return on capital was nearly 32%.</p>
<p>As a recent AP story based on Pew Center research noted, the five biggest international oil companies plowed about 55 percent of the cash they made from their businesses into stock buybacks and dividends last year, while investments in new oil have stayed in single digits.</p></blockquote>
<p>Obviously the debate heard in the offices of Exxon are different than the ones in the media or the campaign.</p>

                                <p>Hat tip to <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2008/08/obama-the-optim.html#more">Economist&#8217;s View</a> for this post from Vox EU:</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.voxeu.org/index.php?q=node/1501">Obama, the optimist on trade, by Susan Ariel Aaronson, Vox EU</a>: Around the world, the press has portrayed the 2008 US presidential election as a choice between freer trader John McCain and <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/">“protectionist” Barack Obama</a>. That traditional paradigm has helped the media simplify the differences between the two men. However, such these labels do not accurately describe either candidate. And it does not fully portray the candidate, Mr Obama, who has the more optimistic vision of trade.</p>
<p>The conventional wisdom labels Mr McCain as a freer trader because he supports three bilateral trade agreements negotiated by the Bush administration.[1] Mr Obama, in contrast, has come out forcefully against these agreements. Moreover, because Mr Obama states that he wants to review the effects of existing trade agreements, the press has found him to be unenthusiastic about trade liberalisation.[2] (It is important to note that the United States is already conducting a similar review of the World Trade Organisation.)</p>
<p>Finally, Mr Obama has support from many US unions, which traditionally have taken a protectionist stance.[3]</p>
<p>In fact, both men are pro-trade. They each support using trade agreements to open markets and create economic efficiencies. But the two have different perspectives regarding what trade agreements should do, what rules these agreements should include, and whom these agreements should directly benefit.</p></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>Mr McCain sees trade as a means to the end of economic growth and trade agreements as simply economic instruments. While he consistently expresses a more forceful commitment to using trade agreements to free trade, he has said very little about how he would use trade agreements to address negative side effects of globalisation, such as pollution. Nor has he articulated how the United States can ensure that the economic growth stimulated by trade is equitable.[4] Beyond suggesting tax breaks for business, he has not explained how the United States can ensure that companies remain in the United States and continue to hire US workers, rather than rely on technologies to remain productive. To bolster his freer trade bona fides, he has stated: “Only risks to the security of our vital interests or egregious offences to our most cherished political values should disqualify a nation from entering into a free trade agreement with us.” But Mr McCain’s support for freer trade has limits – especially when important constituents are adamant about trade bans. As an example, he supports continued trade sanctions against Cuba and Iran and enhanced targeted sanctions against human-rights-abusing nations Zimbabwe and Burma.</p>
<p>Mr Obama, in contrast, is a trade enthusiast as well as a trade agreements reformer. He sees trade as a means to the end of enhancing human welfare. Thus, he has stated: “From financiers to factory workers, we all have a stake in each other’s success.” He recognises that Americans cannot succeed unless globalisation promotes greater access to resources and opportunities for more of the world’s people (our future growth markets). Mr Obama also believes that trade agreements are essential tools of global governance.[5] He seems to understand that public concerns about trade are really concerns about inadequate governance – instances where our trade partners are unwilling or unable to adopt and enforce rules to protect workers, consumers, and the environment. Demanding such standards in bilateral agreements will not alter global market conditions or empower all workers. Nonetheless, trade agreements can, if properly written, improve both the supply and demand for good governance at the national and international level.</p>
<p>Mr Obama also has put forth a consistently positive vision of the potential of trade to promote human rights. Many human rights activists think trade with human-rights-abusing regimes is a form of complicity that can indirectly perpetuate wrongdoing in countries such as Sudan. But Mr Obama has openly questioned this view, asking whether the US has more or less leverage with less commerce. He has argued that cutting off trade may not be the best (or only) strategy to bring democracy to Cuba or Iran.</p>
<p>Like Mr McCain, Mr Obama’s vision of trade has some inconsistencies. He has yet to reconcile his internationalist and co-operative worldview with his promises to Democratic special interests. In addition, he has relied on jargon such as fair trade, without defining such terms in a global context.</p>
<p>Press coverage and public rhetoric about trade lags reality.[6], [7] Clearly when we talk about trade agreements today we are talking about regulations that can affect productivity, investment levels, prices, and other important economic factors. But trade agreements can also ensure that more people have access to more resources such as credit, education, safe food, and healthcare as well as greater opportunities. While Mr McCain sees trade agreements as a means of increasing the nation’s riches, Mr Obama sees trade agreements as tools that can both empower individuals and help our trade partners improve governance.</p>

                                <p>Did you notice.</p>
<p>Obama mentioned selling oil out of the strategic oil reserve and the price of oil fell<br />almost $5. That is a bigger drop than suspending the federal gasoline tax would produce.</p>
<p>Man, I wonder how the Republicans are going to give Bush credit for this drop.</p>
<p>Of course, It could not have happened if Bush had not been speculating in the oil market and putting oil back in the ground.</p>
<p>That is what the libertarians at GMU and some others were giving as the reason that Krugman was wrong in saying that speculation was not important in explaining the high oil prices. As far as I know Bush was the only one putting oil back in the ground.  Of course there is some chance I could be wrong on that&#8211; right FA?</p>
