<p>Medicare rates for physicians have been, supposedly, regulated by the SGR* formula since 1998, but the formula is so wretched and lobbyists so strong the formula has been repeatedly postponed.</p>
<p>The Obama administration has been determined to do a one time catch up, which was scheduled to make an average cut of about 24% on December 1, 2010.</p>
<p>Congress has felt the heat from many different constituencies, but has been unable or unwilling to develop a new system.</p>
<p>The latest is the &#8221; “Physician Payment and Therapy Relief Act of 2010.”  Impressive title, but it is simply a one month reshuffling of some funds, a kick the can down the road   strategy that just delays the inevitable.</p>
<p>This is no way to make policy.</p>

<p><strong>The Effect of Changing Top Marginal Tax Rates</strong> &#8211; an op ed free to a good home<br />Cross posted at the <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=253">Presimetrics blog</a>.</p>
<p>I wrote most of what follows in the anticipation of trying to get it accepted as an op ed at a newspaper, but I guess the deal cut the other night means a bit of it needs rewriting&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>On January 1, 2011, the “Bush tax cuts” will expire and individual marginal tax rates, the percentage of income individuals pay in taxes to the federal government, will return to Clinton-era levels.  The political consensus seems to be that the tax cuts should be kept for most taxpayers, but there is disagreement about whether to let the highest marginal tax rate expire.  That rate applies to the portion of a high-income earner’s revenues that are in excess of some large amount &#8211; $250,000 and $1 million have been recently floated as thresholds.  But, aside from rhetoric about fairness peddled by both sides in the debate, what difference does it make to the economy whether the top marginal rate goes up or not?  A little history can help make it easier to understand what is at stake.  </p>
<p>When Ronald Reagan was elected president in 1980, the top marginal tax rate was 70%.  By 1988, the top marginal tax rate had been reduced to 28%. More importantly, Reagan changed the longstanding political landscape when it comes to taxation.  While the top marginal rate was never below 70% between 1936 and 1980, it has not gone above 39.6% in the years since Reagan left office.  <br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>But if Reagan’s philosophy prevailed, it is fair to ask:  have his tax policies generated the promised results?  Lower taxes were supposed to usher in an era of faster economic growth and increased prosperity.  However, while the economy did better under Reagan than it did under the three presidents who preceded him, Reagan-era growth could hardly be called impressive.  Real GDP (i.e., GDP adjusted for inflation) grew more slowly under Ronald Reagan than during the eight years presided by JFK and LBJ, and slower even than during any consecutive eight year period in which Franklin Delano Roosevelt was president.  FDR, it should be noted, raised the top marginal tax rate four times, from 63% to 94%.  </p>
<p>But perhaps it is unfair to compare Reagan to big-government types like Lyndon Johnson or Roosevelt, as they served during very different eras.  Focusing instead on more recent periods, real GDP also grew faster under Bill Clinton, who raised taxes, than it did under Ronald Reagan.  In fact, from 1981 to the present, the period in which Reagan’s philosophies have reigned triumphant, the correlation between the top marginal tax rate and the annual growth in real GDP has been positive.  That is to say, higher top marginal tax rates have been associated with faster, not slower real economic growth.  Conversely, lower top marginal tax rates have coincided with less economic growth. </p>
<p>The positive relationship between the top marginal tax rate and the growth in real GDP is very nearly bullet-proof.  For instance, it extends all the way back to 1929, the first year for which the government computed GDP data.  Additionally, higher marginal tax rates are not only correlated with faster increases in real GDP from one year to the next, but also with increases in real GDP over the subsequent two, three, or four years.  This is as true going back to 1929 as it is for the period since Reagan became president.  In fact, since the Reagan Revolution took hold, similar relationships have existed between the top marginal rate and several other important variables, like real median income, real private investment, consumer sentiment, the value of the dollar relative to other major currencies, and the S&#038;P 500.  Lower tax rates in any given year are associated with slower growth rates for each of these variables, whether those growth rates are measured over periods of one, two, three or four years.  </p>
<p>On the flip-side, since 1981, unemployment rates have generally shrunk faster when tax rates were higher than when they were lower.  As with the other economic measures, this relationship holds whether one is measuring the change in unemployment over a single year, over two years, over three years or over four years.</p>
<p>None of this means that higher taxes cause better outcomes.  Still, it is clear that the supposed negative repercussions from higher taxes simply have not materialized, notwithstanding pronouncements from politicians, pundits and economists.  The reason is simple:  those who are both willing and able to engage in tax avoidance when subject to a 40% marginal rate are not likely to behave any differently when that rate changes to 50%, or 30% for that matter.  But at a slightly higher top marginal rate, the government does get more revenue, and in this way can finance more spending on things that benefit the economy, such as infrastructure, public health, scientific research, education, alleviating poverty and of course, IRS audits.  Thus, allowing the top marginal rate to rise from current rates (35%) to the level they were under Bill Clinton (39.6%) is unlikely to harm the economy, and may actually help.</p>

<p>As always, if anyone wants my spreadsheet, drop me a line at my first name (that would be &#8220;mike&#8221;) period my last name at gmail.com.  If anyone wants the op ed (changed to reflect whatever deal conditions are applicable at the time), ditto.  </p>
<p>And finally, one question &#8211; why didn&#8217;t I read any op eds like this in the newspapers in the last few weeks and months?</p>

<p>Well the answer is in the above figure, or actually answers because the post title actually hides multiple questions depending on your view of Social Security generally. This is going to get kind of long so I will take it below the fold right away.<a name="more"></a></p>
<p>There are actually three lines represented in the figure: scheduled benefits (top thin line), payable benefits (middle thick line), and income excluding interest (bottom thin line). A close examination shows that tax income exceeded scheduled benefits up until 2009, meaning Social Security was in surplus by anyone&#8217;s definition, that tax income dipped below scheduled benefits this year, but are projected to rise again to meet the schedule in 2012 only to go permanently below the schedule in 2017. But the figure also shows that payable benefits continue to be paid until 2037, the difference representing the draw down of first interest on and ultimately principal from the current Trust Fund.</p>
<p>Which is our first point of departure. Current critics of Social Security often maintain that Trust Fund assets are not &#8216;real&#8217; or where they concede they are in fact real, maintain that they are not affordable. Now they couch these arguments in different terms that sound reasonable enough to them but which come across to supporters of Social Security as a confession along the lines of &#8220;Yes we are thieves and congenital liars and you were fools to believe us all along. And what are you going to do about it?&#8221;. Needless to say arguments that start from these very different premises often don&#8217;t end well.</p>
<p>So laying aside the &#8216;thief and liar&#8217; element for the moment how do these opponents interpret &#8216;crisis&#8217; based on the above figure? Well for them the redemption of the Trust Fund interest and principal is a pure burden starting essentially immediately and extending to 2037. At which point if nothing is done they get a huge tax cut. In constant 2010 dollars one in excess of $300 billion a year. Forever. After that Social Security limps along paying what it can from current tax dollars or between 75% and 78% of the schedule. Which isn&#8217;t their problem, instead 2037 is a get out of jail free card.<br />http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/2010/VI_OASDHI_dollars.html#180555</p>
<p>But as almost the flip side of opportunity, in this case tax cut, is danger. The biggest danger for this group is that retirees demand that the schedule be maintained ANYWAY, and worse that the gap be largely or entirely financed by taxes on people earning over the current payroll gap. Under this scenario the wealthy not only pay enough in taxes to keep benefits flowing but also to keep the Trust Funds in actuarial balance (100% of next year cost) meaning that they will ALSO HAVE TO CONTINUE PAYING INTEREST. It&#8217;s like a double nightmare.</p>
<p>Now oddly the Northwest Plan for a Real Social Security fix we push here at Angry Bear numerically works out as a medium term break for this group. By putting the burden of extra FICA on workers it reduces the role of the General Fund to just enough debt service to stabilize the Trust Funds at their mandated level, instead of having to pay 20% plus of Social Security costs during the last phase of redeeming the Trust Fund (the 2030s) they ultimately settle out paying around 5% of those costs servicing the debt. But instead they are rolling the dice in hopes of a better deal.</p>
<p>If Trust Fund Depletion in 2037 represents a potential tax cut for income tax payers what does it mean for retirees? Well under current law an immediate cut in benefits of 22%. And no argument from that Bruce Webb based on Rosser&#8217;s Equation is going to make that sticker shock go away, people don&#8217;t think that way. (For example the lack of a COLA for 2009 and 2010 actually is the result of retirees getting that increase EARLY and under a system that doesn&#8217;t allow for clawback. In reality they are all dollars ahead on net. Trust me they don&#8217;t get this. At all.)</p>
<p>So in the face of this psychological sticker shock that certainly would spark demands for ACTION. DAMMIT. YESTERDAY. how do the wealthy preserve their long term tax cut? Simple get retirees to take those cuts gradually starting as soon as possible and hope they don&#8217;t recognize that their resulting 2038 check still ends up as small or smaller than a plan of &#8216;Nothing&#8217; would provide.</p>
<p>None of this is about long term deficit reduction, if it was the wealthy would just work to enforce &#8216;Nothing&#8217;. After all that 22% 2037 reset in benefits also has the effect of wiping out all those trillions in &#8216;Unfunded Liability&#8217; the PGP/AEI folk like to tout. Under current law there is no unfunded liability, it is instead a theoretical construct that assumes that future retirees will demand that some or all the current benefit schedule is maintained. Which in the end is a political argument and not an economic one at all.</p>
<p>Returning to the figure the solution for current critics of Social Security is to get the &#8216;Scheduled&#8217; line down to the &#8216;Income line&#8217; while supporters are focused on getting the &#8216;Payable&#8217; line up to &#8216;Scheduled&#8217;. Even within the confines of this simple figure we are using two different sets of lines (a fact obscured that for the 2012 to 2037 period that &#8216;Scheduled&#8217; and &#8216;Payable&#8217; overlap). No wonder consensus seems unreachable, we don&#8217;t even agree on the nature of the Crisis.</p>

<blockquote><p>An administration official said that in the emerging deal, the “Making Work Pay” credit would be replaced with a one-year reduction in payroll taxes for workers.</p>
<p>In addition to a <strong>two-year extension of the income tax rates </strong>enacted under President George W. Bush, the deal includes a <strong>one-year extension of jobless aid </strong>for the long-term unemployed. Officials said negotiators were also close to an agreement to <strong>restore the federal estate tax</strong>, which lapsed at the start of this year, with an exemption of up to $5 million per individual, and a maximum rate of 35 percent.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>The US Supreme Court is to decide whether the largest class action employment lawsuit in US history can proceed against Walmart, the discount retailer, in a case that is being closely watched by other large corporate employers.</p>
<p>Walmart appealed to the highest US court in the summer after a federal appeals court in California gave the go-ahead for a sex discrimination suit filed in 2001 that now covers an estimated 1.5m current and former women employees.</p></blockquote>
<p>Update: see the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/07/business/07bizcourt.html?_r=2&#038;scp=1&#038;sq=ikuta&#038;st=cse">NYT article</a> for Beverly&#8217;s note.  Correction to first paragraph (preventing).</p>
<p><strong>Beverly Mann</strong> sends a note on her thinking:</p>
<p>“In a second dissent, Judge Sandra S. Ikuta said that allowing the case to go forward as a class action would prevent Wal-Mart from presenting tailored defenses to individual claims,” the Times article says. If the Supreme Court agrees with this, it would eliminate virtually all class actions, on the basis that, by its very nature, the use of the class action procedure would violate the constitutional right to due process of law by preventing tailored defenses to individual claims.</p>
<p>One of the pro-business right’s obsessions is class actions; they’ve been out to end the availability of the class-action procedure for decades now. I think it’s highly likely that the Supreme Court will use this case to significantly limit the availability of the class-action procedure, but probably not by saying that class actions violate the constitutional right to due process of law by presenting tailored defenses to individual claims; they probably will have four but not five votes for that. More likely, they’ll say that classes of plaintiffs have to be more narrowly drawn, but not so narrowly that there can only be classes comprised of plaintiffs identically situated in all respects.</p>
<p>According to the article, Judge Kozinski complained that “Maybe there’d be no difference between 500 employees and 500,000 employees if they all had similar jobs, worked at the same half-billion square foot store and were supervised by the same managers. But the half-million members of the majority’s approved class held a multitude of jobs, at different levels of Wal-Mart’s hierarchy, for variable lengths of time, in 3,400 stores, sprinkled across 50 states, with a kaleidoscope of supervisors (male and female).”</p>
<p>But if the company itself had a de facto policy of discriminating against women in wages and promotions, or if large segments of the company did, then that should be sufficient to establish a class for purposes of a lawsuit. But here’s betting that when this case is decided, it won’t be.</p>

<p><strong>Health Care: Really, Really Bad Idea(?)<br /></strong><br />The Food and Drug Administration has approved a proposal to liberalize the guidelines for lap band weight loss surgery (much to the delight of the company making lap bans).</p>
<p>Previous guidelines required a very high level of severe obesity OR  severe obesity combined with hypertension or diabetes or etc.</p>
<p>New guidelines will likely double the number of persons qualifying for the surgery. (If i had high blood pressure I would qualify, and I&#8217;m not that fluffy).</p>
<p>POLITICAL INCORRECTNESS ALERT:</p>
<p>Physicians are supposed to screen such candidates after exercise and diet have failed, or proceed when collateral medical conditions are very serious, this will potentially cause of rush of surgeries by patients who would be better off with fork control and more exercise. Many health providers think so, but aren&#8217;t likely to say so loudly in public.</p>
<p>The surgery does have side effects, and every surgery has infections risks.</p>
<p>And there is a significant cost for each surgery. There is no cost in driving past Krispy Creme.</p>

<p><strong>Ireland &#8211; The Questions Nobody Seems to be Asking</strong><br />Cross-posted at the <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/">the Presimetrics</a> blog.</p>
<p>Talk about deja vu all over again.  Here&#8217;s <a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2010/12/a-simple-public-choice-theory-of-the-ireland-crisis.html">Tyler Cowen</a> talking about the Ireland bailout, and linking to <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2010/12/letter-from-ireland/67393/">Megan McArdle</a> discussing the same.  Its deja vu, for me, because it seems just about everyone commenting on the issue is ignoring what should be an obvious point, namely that a bail-out is at best a possible solution to the wrong problem.  Interestingly enough, this wrong problem has been around for a very long time, and the same cast of characters have been busily ignoring it (or even praising it) for a very long time.  </p>
<p>I said this is deja vu all over again for me, because the last time I gave much thought to the issue (back in 2006), I wrote a post that linked to both Tyler Cowen and Megan McArdle (then Jane Galt).  I&#8217;d like to quote myself extensively if I may:</p>
<blockquote><p>There seems to be <a href="http://www.janegalt.net/archives/009425.html">some</a> <a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2006/08/the_youth_depen.html">discussion</a> about why Ireland is growing as quickly as it is.</p>
<p>I am completely ignorant about this, and haven’t even been to Ireland. But I do have a question… Is it possible that part, even a large part, of the Irish boom, is fictional?</p>
<p>By fictional, I don’t mean lacking in physical manifestations such as massive improvements in infrastructure, etc. Consider the effects of something else I’m mostly ignorant about, namely the Menem-and-Cavallo-dollarize-privatize-and-steal plan (as I recall it had a different name, but to me this one captures its essence a little better) in Argentina. For a number of years after it was launched, it looked like Argentina was doing really well. There was all kinds of new investment in infrastructure, the mood in Argentina was upbeat, and many economists (especially the conservative ones) and financial publications such as the Wall Street Journal were breathlessly pointing to Argentina as a country that other developing nations should imitate.</p>
<p>The problem in Argentina was that much of the funding for the short-term but much-hyped prosperity that followed came from the proceeds of the sale of government-owned assets (airline, railroads, etc.), or rather, the portion of the proceeds of the sale of government-owned assets that wasn’t stolen outright. Instead of assuming the proceeds from those sales were a one-time windfall, the Argentine government, foreign economists and the Wall Street Journal acted as if they were recurring sources of funding, leading gullible foreign investors to come running with their money. With so many experts patting them on the back, eventually even the skeptical Argentine public came to believe Argentina had miraculously fixed all its problems. When the windfall ended, the dwindling foreign reserves were not enough to maintain the dollar peg for long, and the whole house of cards came down.</p>
<p>Now… some of the growth in Argentina was real, and both dollarization and privatization may well have created more amenable economic conditions. But not enough to justify all the enthusiasm, or to ignore the very real problems the plan also brought.<br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>So… where does that leave Ireland? Well, the worst year of my life was spent at a Big X (at the time, X was equal to 6) accounting firm, doing transfer pricing. Transfer pricing often amounts to little more than highballing the amount of a company’s activity taking place in low tax jurisdictions and lowballing the amount that takes place in a high tax jurisdiction in order to reduce one&#8217;s overall tax burden. It is often done creatively. Say company X transfers ownership of a logo to the subsidiary of company X in the Caymans. Then, every time company X sells a tennis shoe with that logo, it pays a royalty to its subsidiary in the Caymans. If taxes in the Caymans are lower in the US, X hires E&#038;Y or PWC or whoever to argue that most of the value in the shoe sits in the logo (and therefore is income received by the Cayman subsidiary and thus taxable in the Caymans), and not in the shoe itself (which is income received by the parent company and taxable in the US).</p>
<p>So back to Ireland…. Say you’re a pharmaceutical company. You have hundreds of highly paid researchers scattered throughout the globe – in places like the US, Switzerland, Germany, etc. Because taxes are lower in Ireland than in the rest of these locations, when a blockbuster drug is discovered, it is advantageous to play up the contribution of the researchers in Ireland and play down the part of the researchers made elsewhere.</p>
<p>This has at least two obvious effects. The first is the direct artificial boost to Irish GDP (and an artificial reduction elsewhere). Since Ireland is relatively small, if a crumb is taken from the US, another crumb is taken from Switzerland, etc., the effect can be very large in Ireland. The second effect is indirect – in order to pull this stunt off, it is necessary to have at least some facilities in Ireland, leading to more hiring and building in Ireland as more companies get more heavily invested in playing the game. But its in nobody’s interest to say this is being as a tax dodge, so a mythology springs up (as it did in Argentina), and part of that mythology, at least, is self-sustaining.</p>
<p>I would imagine the situation is not quite as artificial as in Argentina – Ireland does have a young, fairly educated population, and a convenient location, whereas the change from hyperinflation to rapid growth in Argentina truly looked like a miracle to those who didn’t look too closely (i.e., almost everyone). The Irish miracle has gone on for at least two decades, and there may well be enough of a solid underpinning for it to continue indefinitely. But, I have no idea how much of the Irish growth is due to these effects, nor a clue how to measure them. Any ideas? Any other thoughts as to why Ireland is growing so rapidly?</p></blockquote>
<p>(Note &#8211; transfer pricing was a favorite topic of the early posters on Angry Bear &#8211; Angry Bear, Kash, and PGL all had a number of excellent posts on Transfer Pricing that predated mine.)</p>
<p>About six months after that post, I noted some, er, <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2007/02/riedls-myth-8-part-b.html">corroborating evidence</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>According to the <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/69xx/doc6905/11-30-Cross-BorderInvestment.pdf">CBO</a> 20% of the returns on investment abroad by US companies from 1993 – 2003 came from Ireland and Bermuda. Ireland and Bermuda. If there’s some way to explain that 20% of the returns of all American companies abroad came from Ireland and Bermuda without invoking tax fraud on a massive scale, I’d love to hear it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now, none of this is intended to suggest that the Irish government wasn&#8217;t amazingly stupid in agreeing to take on the debts of private banks.  (Hey, the administrations of both GW and Obama did the same amazingly stupid thing, but they disguised it a bit better, and the ability to print dollars buys the US some leeway to deal with it.)  However, it does raise important issues:</p>
<p>1.  How much of the Irish growth was fictitious?</p>
<p>2.  What is the expected rate at which fictitious growth is transformed into real growth?  Presumably that rate exceeds zero (if companies set up so much as a pass-through in Ireland to reduce their tax rate, some of the money will stick to Ireland), but presumably it is well less than 100% (if you&#8217;re attributing a technology developed by 23 engineers in San Jose, CA and 14 in Frankfurt to a single technician in Dublin, you might reduce your tax rate but the knowledge base still won&#8217;t be in Dublin.)  I imagine that, paradoxically, the more the American and German tax authorities enforce compliance, the more they help the beggar-thy-neighbor types by essentially forcing their companies to do something real in those jurisdictions.  Eventually, some of the engineering work actually does move to Ireland.</p>
<p>3.  Are the beggar-thy-neighbor countries (or states, natch) more susceptible to downturns than other countries?  After all, when the doo-doo hits the fan, and profits are down, Siemens and Intel and the rest of &#8217;em have less of an incentive to minimize profits in high tax jurisdictions, and more of an incentive to show losses in those same high tax jurisdictions.  Activities of any sort in Ireland becomes an afterthought.  Additionally, I imagine that the Irelands of this world are disproportionately dependent on financial transactions.</p>
<p>4.  How much of a hit do places like the US and Germany (or New York and California) take as a result of beggar-thy-neighbor policies?  What should these countries (and states) owe to their citizens or corporations that take advantage of the schemes made possible by the beggar-thy-neighbor policies? </p>
<p>5.  Is the stupidity of the Irish government (in taking on the debts and obligations of private banks) something that will have a long term deleterious effect on Ireland&#8217;s ability to continue playing beggar-thy-neighbor?   The collapse of the housing bubble is a separate matter altogether from the transfer-pricing-milking-operation the Irish government was running, but might it affect Ireland&#8217;s ability to keep playing the game?  (I don&#8217;t know enough about the Irish economy to hazard a guess right now, especially given the baby on my lap has just starting screaming since I started writing this sentence&#8230;  which I guess is a signal to end this post.)</p>

                                <p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/robert-l-borosage/americas-confidence-defic_b_787987.html">Robert Borosage</a> writes a warning about when bipartisan elites come to a consensus on solving the &#8220;problem&#8221;.</p>
<blockquote><p>Today&#8217;s elite consensus &#8212; that deficits are at crisis levels, that budgets must be brought into balance immediately &#8212; is equally wrong-headed. It slights the real crisis we face, and is foreign to the spirit that made America great.</p>
<p>What is the crisis we face today? We have an economy scarred by mass unemployment, falling wages, and growing insecurity. In the downturn, a staggering 40 percent of American households have been afflicted by unemployment, negative home equity (&#8220;under water homes&#8221; worth less than their mortgages), mortgage payment arrears, or foreclosure. In November 2008, one quarter of Americans aged 50-59 reported that they&#8217;d lost more than 35 percent of their retirement savings.<br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>But this devastation caused by the collapse of the financial bubble and resulting recession is but the foul expression of an economy that has suffered long-term decline. We were hemorrhaging manufacturing jobs when the economy was growing before the bubble burst. Wages fell for most Americans over the course of the last decade, which suffered the worst job creation of any period since the end of World War II. The imbalances were obscene before the recession, with finance capturing 40 percent of corporate profits, the wealthiest 1 percent capturing half of the benefits of economic growth, the US running soaring trade deficits, even in high technology products, with China and the world. Our decaying infrastructure, broken health care system, declining educational performance in relation to the industrial world all preceded the fall.</p>
<p>So if we now turn to balancing our budget and succeed, what then? We will have had a brutal fight that will turn us one against another without addressing the fundamental challenges facing the country. </p>
<p>The right question we need to ask, I would argue, is what is the new strategy, the new foundation for an economy that offers hope for rebuilding America&#8217;s economic vitality in the competitive global market place? This requires a clear and bold strategy for revitalizing American manufacturing. It requires investments in areas vital to our future &#8212; in modern infrastructure, in education and training, in research and innovation. We need to capture a lead in the green industrial revolution that is sweeping the world. It requires new trade strategy, shackles on financial speculation, empowering workers to capture a fair share of the productivity and profits they help generate to help rebuild America&#8217;s middle class. We have to figure out how to afford this, financing what we can, changing priorities and raising revenues where needed. But this is a far different question than just how we get our books in order.</p></blockquote>

Sources said Orszag might take a job in Citi&#8217;s I-banking division and an announcement could come as soon as today. Citigroup, which is still recovering from its $45B bailout, would be only the latest in a long string of companies that have poached workers from the political sector, and of employees who have bounced back and forth between regulating (directly or indirectly) financial firms and then working for them.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/40447573">States to face tighter finances.</a> States may have to make additional spending cuts over the next couple of years or else face the possibility of deteriorating financial health as tax revenues recover at a slow pace and support from the federal government dwindles. A new report from the National Governors Association and the National Association of State Budget Officers warned of &#8220;extremely tight fiscal conditions for states,&#8221; and at least 23 states are already anticipating budget deficits totaling $40.5B in 2012.</p>

                                <p>Lifted from comments, by Cedric Regula, from the post on Stedwegg.</p>
<blockquote><p>I think I should add some historical context here since the econ news on the problem with the PIIGS is focusing only on &#8220;the problem is they can&#8217;t depreciate there own currency and make everything better&#8221;.  </p>
<p>Ten years ago the PIIGS and others were desperate to get into the EU and use the Euro because they had depreciated the hell out of their currencies for decades and were unable to borrow money at reasonable rates anymore, if at all.  </p>
<p>The EU architects weren&#8217;t as stupid as our brilliant economists make them out to be. They imposed limits on fiscal and trade deficits on EU members. It is a well known fact that a stable currency is good for business, and the idea was to create a larger regional market with a single currency and more common regulations and import duties between members.  <br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Where the problem came in is fiscal and trade deficits rules either weren&#8217;t enforced, or like Greece, some countries cooked the books and hid the problem. In the case of Iceland and Ireland, lack of banking regulation made them the safe haven for financial fraud, and this was exploited by some Euro and US banks as well as Irish banks.  </p>
<p>So the only good thing about having their own currency is the PIIGS would have gone bankrupt 10 years ago, and maybe would have partially recovered by now. But only maybe. (Some like to point to Argentina as a miracle economy, but really, how many are packing up to move there?)</p></blockquote>
