                                <p>Much has been written on the foundering and significance of the Doha rounds of talks, and how the agricultural policies of nations was the stumbling block.  However, notice Mode 4.</p>

<p>India proposed a policy of treating trade services as commodiities, not people, and the US team agreed.  Hence the normal procedures of a guest program for workers of many types we are accustomed to could have been challenged in closed WTO arbitrage proceedings.</p>
<p>This is one area that should not slip by.  The commoditization of people for guest workers needs careful consideration for intended results (perhaps unintended for most of us regular folk).  Anyway, it could have cut a swath across our immigration discussions with nary a peep.  Does anyone know more?</p>

When do you say innovation needs to be funded differently in the drug business, and when does advertising become propaganda, and the coercion of the government protecting copyrights and patents need amending.  It is worth a visit.</p>
<blockquote><p>There’s something uniquely unsettling about the fact that the pharmaceutical industry is ready, willing, and able to claim that its marketing is actually some perverse form of community service. It’s one thing to claim that a drug works when it doesn’t, but there’s something especially weird about insisting that advertising can—and should—effectively structure patient-physician interactions. This point is all the more perverse because the same organization that’s saying marketers should mold discussions is also claiming that DTC advertising doesn’t do so. There’s a disturbing undercurrent of social conditioning here that is played up or played down depending on what is most convenient for prescription drug companies.</p>
<p>This is all very audacious, even for Big Pharma. The lengths to which these marketers are willing to go to prove that their product is beneficial and desirable are stunning, and this drives home a point that health care reformers need to keep in mind: These are not the people we want involved in medical research. They have a deep interest in choosing spin over science and pursuing “research” in the service of marketing. These are not the priorities of a high quality health care system. The CommonHealth PR logic needs to be kept as far away from the proposed Comparative Effectiveness Institute—and health care in general—as possible.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>Guess who said the following back in April of 1977:</p>
<blockquote><p>The oil and natural gas we rely on for 75 percent of our energy are running out. In spite of increased effort, domestic production has been dropping steadily at about six percent a year. Imports have doubled in the last five years. Our nation&#8217;s independence of economic and political action is becoming increasingly constrained. Unless profound changes are made to lower oil consumption, we now believe that early in the 1980s the world will be demanding more oil that it can produce.  The world now uses about 60 million barrels of oil a day and demand increases each year about 5 percent. This means that just to stay even we need the production of a new Texas every year, an Alaskan North Slope every nine months, or a new Saudi Arabia every three years. Obviously, this cannot continue &#8230; We can&#8217;t substantially increase our domestic production, so we would need to import twice as much oil as we do now. Supplies will be uncertain. The cost will keep going up. Six years ago, we paid $3.7 billion for imported oil. Last year we spent $37 billion &#8212; nearly ten times as much &#8212; and this year we may spend over $45 billion.  Unless we act, we will spend more than $550 billion for imported oil by 1985 &#8212; more than $2,500 a year for every man, woman, and child in America. Along with that money we will continue losing American jobs and becoming increasingly vulnerable to supply interruptions &#8230; We will feel mounting pressure to plunder the environment. We will have a crash program to build more nuclear plants, strip-mine and burn more coal, and drill more offshore wells than we will need if we begin to conserve now. Inflation will soar, production will go down, people will lose their jobs. Intense competition will build up among nations and among the different regions within our own country.  If we fail to act soon, we will face an economic, social and political crisis that will threaten our free institutions.  But we still have another choice. We can begin to prepare right now. We can decide to act while there is time.</p></blockquote>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>In the course of the two posts on Backwards Transfers (XXXVI &#038; XXXVII) it became clear that even experts had a somewhat confused concept of the relation of past and future as it comes to Social Security finance. So this post will attempt to add some clarity.</p>
<p>Social Security is by design a Pay/Go system in which current premiums/taxes are used to pay out current benefits. Despite some hysterical hand-waving this is not a &#8216;pyramid scheme&#8217; or a &#8216;ponzi scheme&#8217;, it is an insurance plan functioning much like any other insurance plan. The major difference between the Social Security Administration and New York Life is that the United States government functions as its own re-insurer with Full Faith and Credit backed up by the inherent power to tax.</p>
<p>Like any insurance plan Social Security takes on future obligations, obligations that will have to be met using resources available in the year of benefit collection. These obligations create legal liabilities, the law requires that Social Security to the best of its ability payout future benefits per the current benefit schedule. Now under Pay/Go the assumption is that these future obligations will be met by a continuation of the taxation mechanism currently in place (FICA payroll plus tax on benefits) backed up by a reserve fund (the Trust Funds) which itself generates a moderate amount of income in the way of interest on the Special Treasuries.</p>
<p>Which leads me to pause for a moment and shout: SOCIAL SECURITY IS NOT THE TRUST FUND. The Trust Funds exist to smooth out short to medium term discrepancies between income from tax collected and cost from benefits paid out, they were not designed and do not serve as an investment fund a la CalPers.</p>
<p>Okay we have an insurance plan whose benefit payouts fundamentally depend on future tax collections. Are those payouts &#8216;liabilities&#8217;? Well yes. Are they &#8216;unfunded liabilities&#8217;? Well it depends on your definition of &#8216;unfunded&#8217;. When the Federal government enters into any contract whether for aircraft carriers or retirement security it rarely if ever actually has dollars tucked away to pay for the entire contract over its entire span, instead it relies on future income streams. In the case of Social Security that income stream primarily is a dedicated FICA tax. My argument or maybe just by bare assertion that those future benefits are funded liabilities for as long as we can project that total income and Trust Fund claims on the Treasury will meet cost. So what are &#8220;unfunded liabilities&#8217; in the context of a Pay/Go system? One answer (if not necessarilly THE answer) can be found under the fold.</p>
<p>My answer is that the term &#8216;unfunded liability&#8217; is limited to the gap between the scheduled benefit and projected income going forward. It has nothing to do with benefits paid to past beneficiaries, those obligations have been fully satisfied with ongoing Pay/Go collections. In this case the past is really the past and done is done. The notion that unfunded liability going forward is a result of extra payouts in the past is simply wrong, for one thing the current unfunded liability totals more than the totals of all benefits paid out to date (Infinite Future unfunded $13.6 trillion, past total benefits $12 trillion), for another those payments were funded. But lets go to the numbers:<br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SJndXD4mIXI/AAAAAAAAACY/Ct3ZiWV9HKE/s1600-h/IV.B6.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SJndXD4mIXI/AAAAAAAAACY/Ct3ZiWV9HKE/s320/IV.B6.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SJndXFkPGYI/AAAAAAAAACg/7Z8Frl0gneA/s1600-h/IV.B7.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SJndXFkPGYI/AAAAAAAAACg/7Z8Frl0gneA/s320/IV.B7.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />These may not be legible on your screen but the relevant links are: <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/IV_LRest.html#267528">IV.B6-Unfunded Obligations Through the Infinite Horizon</a> &#038; <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/IV_LRest.html#267012">IV.B7-Present Values of OASDI</a><br />The tables are laid out in different ways but what they deliver in toto is six values: total gap between future income and future cost for the 75 year, 100 year, and Infinite Future Horizon, and then those numbers discounted by the Trust Fund balance at year end 2007 ($2.2 trillion). So the following will lay out the gross and the net for all three periods:<br />75 year: $6.6 / $4.4 trillion<br />100 year: $17.1 / $15.2 trillion<br />Infinite: $15.8 / $13.6 trillion<br />What is the significance of these numbers? Well I think I will follow up in comments.</p>

<blockquote><p>Proving once again why the Wall Street Journal should be required reading for all good lefties, today the paper <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB121761989739205497.html?mod=hpp_us_whats_news">reports</a> on yet another way corporate America has found to screw the wage slaves among us. As the Journal explains, companies are using our pension funds to finance lavish executive perks:<br />At a time when scores of companies are freezing pensions for their workers, some are quietly converting their pension plans into resources to finance their executives&#8217; retirement benefits and pay.<br />In recent years, companies from <a href="http://online.wsj.com/quotes/main.html?type=djn&#038;symbol=INTC">Intel</a> Corp. to <a href="http://online.wsj.com/quotes/main.html?type=djn&#038;symbol=CTL">CenturyTel</a> Inc. collectively have moved hundreds of millions of dollars of obligations for executive benefits into rank-and-file pension plans. This lets companies capture tax breaks intended for pensions of regular workers and use them to pay for executives&#8217; supplemental benefits and compensation.<br />What&#8217;s the problem with this? Well, there are basically two of them: a) it&#8217;s illegal, and b) it causes serious harm to ordinary workers:<br />A close examination by The Wall Street Journal shows how it works and reveals that the maneuver, besides being a dubious use of tax law, risks harming regular workers. It can drain assets from pension plans and make them more likely to fail. Now, with the current bear market in stocks weakening many pension plans, this practice could put more in jeopardy.<br />Worse, your tax dollars, and mine, are subsidizing the perks for these already extravagantly compensated execs:</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>Normally, companies can deduct the cost of deferred comp only when they actually pay it, often many years after the obligation is incurred. But Intel&#8217;s contribution to the pension plan was deductible immediately. Its tax saving: $65 million in the first year. In other words, taxpayers helped finance Intel&#8217;s executive compensation.<br />[. . .]<br />. . . [A] majority of the tax-advantaged assets in Intel&#8217;s pension plan are dedicated not to providing pensions for the rank and file but to paying deferred compensation of the company&#8217;s most highly paid employees, roughly 4% of the work force.<br />On the Hook<br />And taxpayers are on the hook in other ways. When deferred executive salaries and bonuses are part of a pension plan, they can be rolled over into an Individual Retirement Account &#8212; another tax-advantaged vehicle.<a></a><br />Troublingly, this reverse Robin Hood strategy of raiding the pension funds of ordinary workers and handing over the loot to the most highly paid executives has for the most part been carried out in secrecy. Often, the ordinary employees potentially getting screwed out of their pensions have no idea what&#8217;s going on &#8212; and the bosses and their bottom-feeding consultant aparatchiks take great pains to keep it that way:<br />Generally, only the executives are aware this is being done. Benefits consultants have advised companies to keep quiet to avoid an employee backlash. In material prepared for employers, Robert Schmidt, a consulting actuary with <a href="http://online.wsj.com/quotes/main.html?type=djn&#038;symbol=HEW">Milliman</a> Inc., said that to &#8220;minimize this problem&#8221; of employee relations, companies should draw up a memo describing the transfer of supplemental executive benefits to the pension plan and give it &#8220;only to employees who are eligible.&#8221;<br />Ya gotta love the weasel words there &#8212; &#8220;minimize this problem&#8221; of &#8220;employee relations,&#8221; indeed!<br />Mucking with employee pensions in this way is of dubious legality, but usually the understaffed, overworked regulators have no idea it is even going on:<br />With too little staffing to check the dozens of pages of actuaries&#8217; calculations, the IRS generally accepts the companies&#8217; assurances that their pension plans pass the discrimination tests, the official said.<br />Of course, there is something our elected officials can do about it:<br />To halt the practice, Congress would have to end the flexibility that companies now have in meeting the IRS nondiscrimination tests.<br />Does Congress have the huevos do the right thing, and thoroughly investigate &#8212; and regulate! &#8212; this and many other dubious corporate practices and financing schemes that have taken hold over the past couple of decades? Would President Obama&#8217;s SEC and Justice Department have the backbone to enforce the law by going after the corporate crooks and meting out appropriately stiff punishments to the offenders?<br />I wish I could be more confident that the answer to those two questions is, &#8220;Hell to the yeah!&#8221;<br />*H/T: <a href="http://www.cogitamusblog.com/2008/08/the-war-on-the.html">Sir</a> <a href="http://www.cogitamusblog.com/2008/08/the-war-on-th-1.html">Charles</a></p></blockquote>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Sam Wang <a href="http://election.princeton.edu/2008/08/04/on-a-flaw-in-fivethirtyeightcom/#more-24">explains why he reports a 99% probability of an Obama win</a> and <a href="http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/">fivethirtyeight.com has only a 62.4% probability.</a></p>
<p>I learned a lot from his post due to my incredible ignorance.  I go to www.fivethirtyeigth.com often enough that Firefox proposes it first  when I type www, but I had never bothered to read the description of <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2008/2/26/183555/011/136/464643">the method used to calculate the probabilities.</a> </p>
<p>In case others are as lazy as me (unlikely) or have lives (likely) I will discribe my ignorance below after discussing issues of interest to the non pathetically ignorant.</p>
<blockquote><p>Today I’d like to outlline the basic contrasts between this calculation and a popular resource, FiveThirtyEight.com. That site, run by Nate Silver, a sabermetrician, is a good compendium of information and commentary. However, both our goals and methods differ on several key points. The biggest difference is that this site provides a current snapshot of where polls are today, while he attempts a prediction. His approach also has a conceptual problem…</p></blockquote>
<p>I think the conceptual problem is that Silver calculated probabilities from 10,000 simulations and Wang uses an analytic formula.  </p>
<blockquote><p>Silver’s approach is to carry out thousands of simulations, then tally the simulations. That method reflects the fantasy baseball tradition, in which individual outcomes are often of great interest. However, such an approach is intrinsically imprecise because it draws a finite number of times from the distribution of possible outcomes. The Meta-Analysis on this site calculates the probability distribution of all 2.3 quadrillion possible outcomes. This can be done rapidly by calculating the polynomial probability distribution, known to students as Pascal’s Triangle.</p></blockquote>
<p>Wang claims that Poblano (AKA Nate Silver) should have obtained a normal distribution for electoral college votes.  I don&#8217;t agree.  This is only true if there is no correlation between shifts in support for Obama and McCain in different states.  As usual, I argue using an extreme example.  Assume no sampling error (each poll is of the whole population) and perfect correlation of changes in support in different states.  If this were true then the ranking of states by Obama minus McCain would not change and there would be only 50 different possible outcomes in the electoral college.  That&#8217;s not a normal distribution.  I think that the argument is valid unless changes in support in different states are independent.  This is a very implausible assumption.  (note <a href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/ezraklein_archive?month=08&#038;year=2008&#038;base_name=the_most_blogged_about_graph_y#108043">young Ezra who is neither a statistician nor a political scientist made this argument before I did</a>).</p>
<p>Now Wang also argues that 10,000 simulations aren&#8217;t enough.  I agree.  I recently calculated something using 1,000,000 simulations for each of several different parameters (actually just 2 sample sizes).  This was a distribution which I think I derived analytically.  The millions of simulations were to check my reasoning, my algebra and, especially, my typing when writing the program which calculates the analytically exact distribution (the fact that I fail to reject the null that it is accurate with 1,000,000 simulations convinces me that I typed write for wunce).</p>
<p>The convention that simulations are repeated 10,000 times is a historical artifact of the slow pc age.  I would like to ask Silver how long his computer takes to simulate.  I would guess that his simulations are quicker than some of mine and waiting for 1,000,000 simulations was barely a nuissance.  </p>
<p>Just to go back to my other obsession.  I blame microsoft.  I don&#8217;t think people fully realise just how much faster cheap pc&#8217;s have become, because microsoftware is designed to run intollerably slowly on any but the latest generation computers so computers take as long as ever to boot up, open a word file, open excel or well all that stuff even though they also take as long to do 1,000,000 simulations as they used to take to do 10,000.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d guess that 1,000,000 simulations won&#8217;t change Poblano&#8217;s calculated probability much and I would bet that he does them and reports the result.</p>
<p>OK what I should have known already.</p>
<p>I knew that Poblano (AKA Nate Silver) used old polls as well as the latest polls.  His success during the primaries shows that true shifts in opinion were of limited importance.  <a href="http://docs.google.com/View?docid=dhn8hrb6_4c43866dz">I did not know that he used a weighted average with the weight decreasing exponentially so that they fall by half after 30 days (weight = 0.5^(age/30days)*(other stuff) and that in past elections this calculation predicts better than others he tried</a>.  I see that just as I finally read the old faq (the link above) Silver wrote a <a href="http://docs.google.com/View?docid=dhn8hrb6_6f2ppmdfn">new one </a>(still doing 10,000 simulations)</p>
<p>Worse I didn&#8217;t even know that he considers the correlation of future changes in support for different candidates in different states.</p>
<blockquote><p>It can reasonably be argued that I&#8217;m essentially double-counting the amount of variance by accounting for both state-specific and national movement.  That is, some of the error in state-by-state polls is because of national movement, rather than anything specific within that state.  However, I have chosen to account fully for both sources of error, because (i) this is the more conservative assumption, and (ii) I suspect that 2004, where voters divided into Bush and Kerry camps early, was inherently a more stable sort of election than 2008 is likely to be.</p></blockquote>
<p>I had assumed that he did something like what Wang did, so the 67% was a snapshot not a forecast.  I am pleased and reassured.</p>

<blockquote><p>I am delighted to announce that The Century Foundation has created a working group to look at Medicare Reform. I’ll be directing it. We’re going to do the work online, communicating with each other on a closed list-serve. In this way, we’ll be able to get a lot done without wasting time traveling to meetings. In the end, we’ll issue a report, and then we’ll get together and host a conference with keynote speakers and panels. (See our Press Release below for more information).</p>
<p>We’ll be looking at many of the issues I have been discussing on this blog: how physicians are paid; the secretive panel, dominated by specialists, that sets fees; the need to reward providers for quality, not volume; over-paying for Medicare Advantage; overpaying for drugs; unwarranted regional variations in how much Medicare spends in different parts of the country; the need to squeeze the hazardous waste out of the system; the need for a comparative effectiveness institute that is truly insulated from Congress and lobbyists; the need to co-ordinate care; and the need for health IT.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>As <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/08/pluralising-anecdotes.html">noted last week</a>, we are in Montreal, and Videotron was scheduled today to install telephone, television, and internet services.</p>
<p>They came through with flying colors.</p>
<p>Around 12:50, I called them, wondering when they were coming by.  The representative noted that they were scheduled to arrive &#8220;sometime during the day,&#8221; not specifically in the morning as I had thought.* He also noted that they did not have my (current) cell phone number, so they had no way to contact me.  And the apartment apparently doesn&#8217;t have buzzer service until and unless it has telephone service. So we established that there was no way for the tech to get to my apartment.</p>
<p>While we were talking, the tech (somehow) appeared at the door.</p>
<p>By 3:00p.m., everything was in and working, including installing new cables and working with some jerry-rigged electrical plugs from our side.**</p>
<p>The only problem was a &#8220;last mile&#8221; issue about the door buzzer itself. It took us an extra five or ten minutes because the (Bell Canada based) buzzer system uses a different entry code than the normal.</p>
<p>So I can safely say that the Canadian installation experience worked.  But it appears I missed <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/08/flip-flopping-for-big-oil.html">a</a> <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/08/hess-contributions-preceded-mccain.html">plethora</a> <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/08/oil.html">of</a> <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/08/behavior-revealsoil-company-priorities.html">really</a> <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/08/whats-dumb-about-windfall-profits-tax.html">solid</a> <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/08/oil-prices-vs-storms.html">posts</a> <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/08/hot-air-lowers-gasoline-prices.html">about</a> <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/08/biofuels-and-food-prices.html">fuels</a>.</p>
<p>*Which turned out to be a good thing, since we went to Costco in the morning to buy a television and telephones.</p>
<p>**It is not a good idea to plug a power strip into another power strip, but it does work in the short term.</p>

                                <p>By: Divorced one like Bush</p>
<p>Being that there is a lot of “authoritative” talking going on about the cause of the up&#8217;s and down&#8217;s of oil and one cause being suggested is the anticipation of storms, I thought looking at the history of storms and oil price would help toward answering the hypothesis of oil prices rising in anticipation of storm damage.</p>
<p>Using the daily price of <a href="http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/dnav/pet/hist/rwtcd.htm">WTI Cushing/Oklahoma oil </a>I charted the relationship of price to the storm dates.  I use 6 price points.  A. 2 Monday&#8217;s before, B. Friday before, C. Monday before, D. Day of Storm, E. Friday after, F. 1 week after day of storm.  Any number in parenthesize is the price for the next open trading day.  When the storm fell on a week end, I counted 1 week after and used the next Monday.</p>
<p>Chart after the fold.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_ea3-LcbrX8A/SJjiAC5fexI/AAAAAAAAAIQ/cz798iTWXl0/s1600-h/Oil+Price+vs+Storm+Dates.JPG"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_ea3-LcbrX8A/SJjiAC5fexI/AAAAAAAAAIQ/cz798iTWXl0/s400/Oil+Price+vs+Storm+Dates.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a><br />I do not do correlation calculations.  But, I think this chart shows that there is no significant speculation in pricing based on Gulf storms.  There are 4 times that the price 1 wk post storm is lower than 2 Monday&#8217;s prior to the storm.  They are in order: Dolly 7/23/08 down $22.95, Dennis 7/10/05 down $2.66, Rita down 2.58 9/24/05 and Opal 10/4/95 down $0.10.  Of these 4, Rita has the highest pre-storm climb of $3.92 or 6%.  Dolly only showed a 2% climb pre-storm but there has been a 16% drop since her high 2 weeks before she hit.</p>
<p>The interesting string is the 4 storms of 2005.   Katrina and Rita are the only storms that show some possibility of a storm pricing effect within this series.  Katrina with an almost $2.00 (3%) rise in 2 wks and then a decline of $4.50 until the price jumped $4.30 in 1 week before Rita.   However, the next trading day after Rita, the price was down $1.23  and 1 week later it was within $0.93 of the 2 weeks prior to tropical storm Cindy of 7/5/05 ( 2.5 months time between the two).  As to this year, the price is just plain going down since the peak 2 weeks before hurricane Dolly which is 1 month of downward trend before the republicans started filling hot air balloons.   </p>
<p>It appears that if there is a storm pricing effect, it is a recent phenomenon and of a rather small and short lived event.  Being a new event in oil pricing, I would suggest that what effect there is, is purely emotional and related to the emotional climate we are living in.  Gun shy?  We only have fear to fear?  Or, maybe it is an herd mentality learned that a storm is a good excuse to make a quick dollar. That would be herd mentality market manipulation.  Oh no, did I just ruin it for everyone?</p>
<p>Guess we are going to have to find someone talking with more authority than what we have had so far regarding the cause oil pricing.</p>
