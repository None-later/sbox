                                <p>Edward Leamer&#8217;s quarterly forecast was released today.  It was quite pessimistic regarding the housing market:<br />
<blockquote><a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/economic_forecast;_ylt=AuajSsWVUow8vgG9w9gHO4es0NUE;_ylu=X3oDMTA2Z2szazkxBHNlYwN0bQ--">LOS ANGELES</a> &#8211; A sustained decline will hit the U.S. housing market next year, costing the nation as many as 800,000 jobs, according to a new economic report released Wednesday.</p>
<p>The slowdown is likely to last several years, with as many as 500,000 construction jobs and 300,000 financial sector positions lost, the quarterly Anderson Forecast predicted.</p>
<p>&#8220;We expect housing to start slowing the economy this quarter or the next,&#8221; said Edward Leamer, director of the study done at the University of California, Los Angeles.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some jobs in manufacturing might well disappear as a result of weakness in housing, but this may be offset by jobs brought home or not lost to foreign competition,&#8221; he wrote.</p>
<p>The forecast said eight of the last 10 economic recessions were started by housing market slowdowns. Though the coming cooldown will cause a drag on the nation&#8217;s economy, it will fall short of triggering a recession, the forecast said.</p></blockquote>
<p>Personally, actually think that the chances are decent that a drop in housing-related activity as sharp as the one that Leamer forecasts will tip the economy into recession.  In addition to losing several hundred thousand jobs (in an economy that is creating less than 2 million per year), the effect of stagnant or falling house prices on consumer spending and bankruptcy rates (and the resulting <a href="http://calculatedrisk.blogspot.com/2005/12/housing-bubble-bursts-in-us-mortgage.html">repercussions on financial firms</a>) could be substantial.  And I suspect that others agree, which may explain why the yield curve continues to flirt with inversion&#8230;</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>I&#8217;d like to follow up on PGL&#8217;s <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/12/tax-policy-gdp-growth-and-deficit.html">post from yesterday</a> about tax cuts and GDP growth.  The argument from some supply-side tax-cut advocates (see, for example this WSJ op-ed: &#8220;<a href="http://www.opinionjournal.com/editorial/feature.html?id=110006973">The deficit is shrinking, thanks to the Bush tax cuts</a>&#8220;) is that the Bush tax cuts have increased economic growth dramatically.  So dramatically, in fact, that they are responsible for the surge in tax revenues in 2005, and the corresponding fall in the budget deficit.</p>
<p>Yesterday AB illustrated one way in which <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/12/rest-of-story.html">this claim is nonsense</a>: there is no discernable relationship between tax cuts and economic growth.  The 2003 tax cut was indeed followed by economic expansion, but the 2001 tax cut was followed by economic contraction.  How can we conclude from that evidence that tax cuts cause greater economic growth?  Growth seems to be determined by some other factors in the economy, not by tax cuts.</p>
<p>To address the question of whether the Bush tax cuts can be credited with the shrinking budget deficit in 2005, what we really need to do is therefore pose the counterfactual: what would economic growth and the budget deficit have been <em>without</em> the tax cuts?</p>
<p>The best estimate of the supply-side effects of the tax cuts that I&#8217;ve seen is from the <a href="http://www.house.gov/jct/">Joint Committee on Taxation</a>, which is the Congress&#8217;s group of tax experts that provide revenue estimates of all pending legislation.  In 2003 the Republican Congress directed the JCT to explicitly estimate the supply-side growth and revenue effects of their tax cuts &#8211; in other words, to use &#8220;dynamic scoring&#8221; to gauge the net impact of the tax cuts on revenue.  The JCT convened a blue-ribbon panel of macroeconomists (including Alan Auerbach, David Bradford, Martin Feldstein, and Greg Mankiw) to help them develop their estimates.</p>
<p>What were their results?  The JCT used several different macroeconomic models, and in <a href="http://www.house.gov/jct/x-105-03.pdf">December 2003</a> they published their conclusion that the supply-side effects of the tax cuts would increase real GDP by a total of <strong>0.2%-0.3% over five years</strong>.  Over ten years the effects on economic growth would be zero, or slightly negative.  Such an impact on the economy is so small as to be indistinguishable from statistical noise.</p>
<p>This supply-side &#8216;boost&#8217; to the economy would indeed increase government revenues somewhat, however, by about 5% to perhaps as high as 25% of the initial cost of the tax cuts.  But there&#8217;s no estimate that even approaches 100%, which is to say that there&#8217;s no possibility that tax revenues were higher in 2005 than they would have been without the tax cuts.</p>
<p>The following picture compares actual and forecast tax revenues given the Bush tax cuts with what revenues would have been without the tax cuts.  The heavy red line shows the true situation.  The other lines show different estimates what federal tax revenues would have been without the tax cuts. </p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/dynamic_scoring1.jpg"></p>
<p>Obviously, revenues did indeed grow strongly in 2005&#8230; but they would have been even higher if the tax cuts had not happened.  </p>
<p>The next picture shows what these estimates mean for the budget deficit.</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/dynamic_scoring2.jpg"></p>
<p>One may like tax cuts for personal reasons, or for ideological reasons.  But please let&#8217;s not pretend any longer that the economic recovery, or the improvement in the budget deficit in 2005 (which will almost certainly prove to be very temporary), are due to the Bush tax cuts.  There&#8217;s simply no evidence whatsoever to support those claims, and substantial evidence against them.</p>

<p>I’ve been looking for an excuse to post this diagram of real Federal tax revenues (excluding payroll contributions) and <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/12/budget-deficit-in-context.html">Kash’s post</a> “The Budget Deficit in Context” and a few other posts on this topic provide that excuse.  I guess the standard supply-side reply to Kash’s noting that revenues as a percent of GDP have fallen dramatically would run something along the lines of the latest from <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_buzzcharts/buzzcharts200512050910.asp">Jerry Bowyer</a>:<br />
<blockquote>The revision also raises the average for the last 10 quarters to 4.1 percent, which, as the chart above shows, bests the 3.6 percent mark set over President Clinton’s term.  Why do we begin counting 10 quarters ago? Because while Bush’s overall GDP average remains tempered by the anemic economy he inherited, it has grown by leaps and bounds since he signed his full tax cut (the so-called “tax cut for the rich”) into law.</p></blockquote>
<p>We have heard a <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/11/best-economy-in-six-years.html">lot</a> of this rhetoric lately.  AB, however, notes that the economy over the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/12/rest-of-story.html">past five years</a> has not faired all that well.  Simply put – some of the Bush supporters voted for the 2001 tax cut before they voted against it.  AB reader Tom put it well – the growth over the past 10 quarters is nothing more than a business cycle recovery from the very weak growth of the prior 9 quarters.  If real GDP grows by 1% (4% per annum) during the last quarter of 2005, the five-year increase over 2000QIV will have been only 14.5%.  So I was wondering how this compares to other five-year periods:</p>
<p>1971-1975: 17.0%<br />1976-1980: 18.3%<br />1981-1985: 18.2%<br />1986-1990: 15.1%<br />1991-1995: 14.6%<br />1996-2000: 21.9%<br />2001-2005: 14.5%</p>
<p>Once one adjusts for business cycle effects, the effect of neither the Bush43 nor the Reagan fiscal stimulus on long-term growth does not appear to be as rosy as the National Review or <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2005/12/when_excea_chai.html">Greg Mankiw</a> would have us believe.  <br />
<blockquote>In the past, I have been critical of supply siders who say that tax cuts generate so much growth as to increase tax revenue. That is different than being critical of tax cuts. I believe that tax cuts increase growth and, therefore, are partly self-financing. I think it is overoptimistic to say they are fully self-financing. That is why spending restraint must go hand in hand with tax cuts.</p></blockquote>
<p>To be fair to Dr. Mankiw, he does add the caveat that tax cuts must be accompanied by spending cuts if they are to have positive supply-side effects.  Otherwise, the fiscal stimulus will crowd out investment.  But returning to Kash’s post – note that neither the Reagan nor the Bush43 tax cuts were accompanied by spending cuts of any appreciable amount. </p>
<p>Finally, we should note that decade-by-decade increases in real Federal tax revenues:</p>
<p>1971-1980: 39.4%<br />1981-1990: 15.7%<br />1991-2000: 67.5%</p>
<p>(Here is where I should answer Ken&#8217;s question about my graph.  Blue line is actual data and pink line shows trend for each decade.  Note that this trend is quite steep for 1991 to 2000 &#8211; and I took the liberty of just letting this trend extend through 2005 to show how far current tax revenues are below the 1990&#8217;s trend.)</p>

                            </p>
                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>The <a href="http://www.newamerica.net/index.cfm?pg=home">New America Foundation</a> has just proposed a few ideas for fundamental tax reform.  Their <a href="http://www.newamerica.net/index.cfm?pg=article&#038;DocID=2738">tax reform plan</a> suggests five specific major changes to how taxes are collected in the US:
<ul>
<li>Replace the payroll tax with a progressive consumption tax, i.e. a tax only on the income that an individual does not save;</li>
<li>Eliminate corporate income taxes, but tax capital gains and dividends as regular income;</li>
<li>Simpify tax expenditures, by consolidating and eliminating a myriad of tax deductions, exemptions, and credits into a few consolidated tax credits;</li>
<li>Replace the estate tax with an inheritance tax;</li>
<li>Levy new environmental taxes, such as gas taxes or carbon taxes.</li>
</ul>
<p>I actually like most of these ideas quite a bit.  I particularly like the idea of getting rid of the highly regressive payroll tax and simplifying tax expenditures into a few tax credits.  Both of these ideas could add substantial progressivity to the tax code.  </p>
<p>The corporate income tax is inefficient and unwieldy, and the only reason that I&#8217;ve generally been in favor of it is because it is a good way of making effective taxes more progressive, since most corporations are owned primarily by the wealthy.  So if the rest of the tax code is made more progressive as part of the bargain (which raising the tax rates on capital gains and dividends would do), I could get behind eliminating the corporate income tax.  </p>
<p>Green taxes seem like an excellent idea to me, both from an environmental point of view and from an efficiency point of view, since energy demand is relatively inelastic.  They do tend to be slightly regressive, however, and so this should ideally be part of a package including other changes that make taxes more progressive.  </p>
<p>Finally, I think that it is a superb idea to completely drop the whole fight over estate taxes, and instead simply levy an inheritance tax.</p>
<p>The specific details and their redistributive effects would have to be worked out, obviously.  But assuming that this package of reforms would generally have the effect of making tax collection in the US more progressive (and I think that it probably would, perhaps substantially), this is a set of reforms that I would be happy to see.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Reader RN alerted me to a <a href="http://www.treas.gov/press/releases/js3033.htm">recent press release</a> by the Bush administration touting the fantastic job growth following the 2003 Bush tax cuts:<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;The American economy has created 4.4 million new jobs and the unemployment rate has fallen to 5.0% &#8212; well below the historical average &#8212; since the President signed the Jobs and Growth bill into law in May of 2003. It is vital that we keep taxes low on individuals and on capital gains and dividends and resist tax hikes that could undermine the path of economic growth.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>They even included this fancy graph:</p>
<p><a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/uploaded_images/november%20jobs%20graph-710265.jpg"><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/uploaded_images/november%20jobs%20graph-705172.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a><br />Wow! A compelling case that Bush&#8217;s tax cuts did work magic! Or so it would seem &#8212; if the first tax cuts were in 2003. In fact, the tax cuts started in 2001, though 2001-2003 data are strangely omitted from the graph.</p>
<p>Looking back on the 2001 tax cuts, the <a href="http://www.gpoaccess.gov/usbudget/fy03/pdf/2002_erp.pdf">2002 Economic Report of The President</a> (pdf, see page 44) claimed that<br />
<blockquote>The President laid a strong foundation for growth in 2001 with the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act. This package provides a powerful stimulus for future growth, with reductions in marginal tax rates that improve incentives &#8230;</p>
<p>The first reduction in marginal tax rates was effective for 2001 and was reflected in lower withholding during the second half of the year. In addition, the new 10 percent tax rate bracket, carved out of the beginning of the 15 percent rate bracket, was reflected in rebate checks totaling $36 billion, which were mailed to 85 million taxpayers during the second half. The timing of these reductions in withholding and rebates proved propitious: they added significant economic stimulus by boosting purchasing power in the hands of consumers during a period of sluggish economic activity. The 2001 tax rate reductions were just the first step in a series of income tax rate reductions to be phased in by 2006&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>How did that one work out? Let&#8217;s take a quick look at those omitted years:</p>
<p><a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/uploaded_images/employment-721230.gif"><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/uploaded_images/employment-719641.gif" alt="" border="0"></a><br />Only in late 2004 were we back to the 2001 levels of employment. Of course, the population had grown from 285.1 million to 294 million over that same period. In fact over the same period cited in the press release and featured in the administration&#8217;s chart, mid-2003 to November 2005, the population increased from <a href="http://www.census.gov/popest/states/NST-ann-est.html">290.8 million</a> to <a href="http://www.census.gov/main/www/popclock.html">about 297.8 million</a> (the working-age population grows at about 1.2% per year, so roughly 130k new jobs a month are needed just to stay in place).</p>
<p>The administration is trumpeting 4.4 million new jobs created from May 2003 to November 2005. That&#8217;s 4.4 million jobs in 29 months, or about 152,000 per month &#8212; modestly above the level of job creation required just to keep up with population growth. For comparison, see the chart in <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2004/02/weapons-of-math-destruction-part-iii.html">this old post</a> (or see below), which shows that the economy under Clinton rarely had job growth as low as 152,000 per month.</p>
<p>So, as it racks up massive deficits and sends the <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2005/12/the_bush_admini.html">federal debt over $8 trillion</a>, the Bush administration has managed to shift the economy from 2 years of negative job growth to 2.5 years of historically anemic (but positive nonetheless!)  job growth. Time for a self-congratulatory press release indeed.</p>
<p>AB</p>
<p>P.S. Here&#8217;s the chart of monthly job creation from the old post that I cited above:<br /><a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/jobsUS1.jpg"><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/jobsUS1.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a></p>

<blockquote>One popular explanation for the weak employment growth of the last five years is that mothers are increasingly opting out of the labor force. The argument is that in a post-9-11 world, people have come to recognize that family is what really matters. Therefore, women now want to be at home with their kids rather than pursuing a career. The evidence to support this view usually amounts to accounts of the experiences of a few friends or neighbors. </p></blockquote>
<p>Despite all the happy talk from the White House about economic growth and increasing employment, the employment-to-population ratio remains at only 62.8%.  While it had risen from 62.1% as of September 2003 to 62.8% as of July 2005, it has yet to reach 63%.  Some of us are hoping that it will reach the 64% level, which appeared to be the natural rate of the employment-to-population ratio during the late 1990’s.  On the other hand, some economists have argued that part of the reason the labor force participation rate declined from 67% to 66% was voluntary opting out of the labor force.  </p>

<p>Our graph shows the labor force participation rates of women ages 25 to 34 (in blue) and of women ages 35 to 44 (purple) from January 1991 to November 2005.  For the first ten years of this fifteen year span, we see a secular trend where labor force participation rates had been increasing but a general decline since then.  Dean kindly points us to the work of <a href="http://www.cepr.net/publications/opt_out_2005_11.pdf">Heather Boushey</a> who shows that this these that mothers are opting out of the labor force is not supported by the evidence:<br />
<blockquote>The recession of the early 2000s led to sustained job losses for all women–those with and without children at home–and by early 2005 the labor market had only just returned to its 2000 employment level, almost exactly four years after the recession began. During this recession, women experienced their largest employment losses in decades and once this is controlled for, the presence of children at home plays a smaller role in women’s labor force participation than it did in previous years, going back to 1984 &#8230; The paper will refer to this effect, which is the percentage point change in the probability of being in the labor force due specifically to having a child in each year, as the “child penalty” &#8230; Here, we see that the child penalty decreases from 1984 to 2000, from 18.2 percentage points down to 11.5 percentage points. Between 2000 and 2004, however, the child penalty rises back up to 13.5 percent. Column 3 shows that there is no such decline once the model includes a year effect, to control for the business cycle, as well as cultural and other changes affecting all women (not just mothers) that may have occurred over time. The year effects shown in Column 3 are the effects of the business cycle of women’s LFPR: in 2004, compared to 1984, women were 7.4 percentage points less likely to work because of the weak labor market. This dampening effect on women’s LFPRs is nearly as large as the 8.2 percentage point child penalty in 2004.</p></blockquote>
<p>Simply put – while one can always find examples of women who have recently given birth to children opting out, Heather Boushey suggests that a careful read of the evidence would indicate that this opt out effect has been declining.  Given that the ability to stay home with the kids and still provide for them depends on the ability of the other parent to earn income and given that real wages for many workers have declined, her findings are not that surprising.  If mothers opting out do not explain the decline in the labor force participation rate among women between 25 and 44, might the explanation be continuing weakness in the overall state of aggregate demand relative to potential output?</p>

                                <p>Bruce Bartlett, noted tax-cut advocate and columnist for (among others) the <em>Washington Times</em> and <em>National Review</em>, sent me an email this morning offering this explanation for why he is in favor of at least <em>talking</em> about increasing taxes:<br />
<blockquote>I could do nothing but write about why spending should be cut for the rest of my life and at the end of it spending won&#8217;t be one penny less.   But when the inevitable fiscal correction begins, I think I might be able to influence the way taxes are going to be raised.  Therefore, that is where I have channeled my energy.  At the end of the day, my [libertarian] friends are not going to have the choice of cutting spending or raising taxes, as they imagine.  Rather, their only choice will be raising taxes in ways that will be very debilitating to growth or raising taxes in ways that will minimize their economic burden.</p></blockquote>
<p>Though I&#8217;m sure that I disagree with Bartlett about many things, on this I agree with him.  This country seems to have reached an effective limit on spending cuts, despite the fervent wishes of <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2005/12/greenspan_socia.html">Alan Greenspan</a>.  Therefore, the only realistic way left to reduce <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/12/budget-deficit-in-context.html">the budget deficit</a> is to raise taxes.  The sooner policy-makers face this reality, the better.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Last week, White House economic advisor <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/government/hubbard-bio.html">Allan Hubbard</a> and Fed Chairman <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/bios/greenspan.htm">Alan Greenspan</a> both made incomplete or inaccurate comments regarding the fiscal challenges facing the United States. See <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/12/al-not-glenn-hubbard-addresses-press.html">pgl on Hubbard</a> and <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2005/12/greenspan_socia.html">Dr. Thoma on Greenspan</a>.</p>
<p>Both Hubbard&#8217;s and Greenspan&#8217;s comments are deserving of criticism, but instead of focusing on their respective errors and omissions, I&#8217;d like to focus on America&#8217;s long term fiscal challenges from a demographics perspective.</p>
<p>The age distribution of America&#8217;s population has been shifting dramatically. The following graph compares the 1900 census to projections for 2050. Due primarily to advances in medicine, and a lower birth rate, the population distribution is becoming flatter and has a longer tail.</p>
<p><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/hello/243/2888/640/census1900vs2050.jpg"><img src="http://photos1.blogger.com/hello/243/2888/320/census1900vs2050.jpg" border="0"></a><br />Figure 1: <i>Click on graph for larger image.</i><br />NOTE: All data and projections from <a href="http://www.census.gov/">Census Bureau</a>. For the 1900 Census, the 85 to 89 cohort is actually 85 or over.</p>
<p>People are living longer and fewer people are dying young. This is GREAT news, but it also probably means that America&#8217;s social programs for the elderly will have to be modified, probably by gradually increasing the retirement age over time.</p>
<p>But Figure 1 is only the general trend change. Starting in the late 1920s, America experienced a significant &#8220;Baby Bust&#8221; related to the Great Depression. Figure 2, from the 1940 Census, shows the extent of the Baby Bust on the age distribution.</p>
<p><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/hello/243/2888/640/census1940.jpg"><img src="http://photos1.blogger.com/hello/243/2888/320/census1940.jpg" border="0"></a><br />Figure 2: The Baby Bust. 1940 Census.</p>
<p>Following the Baby Bust came the Baby Boom. Figure 3 clearly show the Baby Bust and the Baby Boom that followed.</p>
<p><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/hello/243/2888/640/census1970.jpg"><img src="http://photos1.blogger.com/hello/243/2888/320/census1970.jpg" border="0"></a><br />Figure 3: The Baby Boom. 1970 Census.</p>
<p>In addition to the gradual policy changes required by the general shift in population distribution over a century or more (figure 1), policy also has to adapt to the Baby Bust and Boom.</p>
<p>The following is an animation of the changing population distribution from 1900 to 2050. Note the general trend, and the Baby Bust and Baby Boom. Prior to 2000, the 85 to 89 category included everyone over 85.  2010 to 2050 are projections from the Census Bureau</p>
<p><img border="0" src="http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b201/CDMbeachman/census3.gif"></p>
<p>As an example of adapting policy to demographic changes: In the early 1980s, the Baby Bust generation was in their peak earning years, but the Baby Boom cohorts were just entering the work force. This put a strain on elderly social programs and fiscal policy as the generation garnering peak earnings was smaller than expected due to the Baby Bust.</p>
<p>It was natural for the US economy to run a budget deficit during these years (not to excuse the size of the deficits) and also for policy makers to address the demographic issues for the elderly programs.</p>
<p>An example of a policy change was the work of the <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/history/reports/gspan.html">Greenspan Commission</a> on Social Security.  In 1983, Social Security was facing a short term deficit due to fewer Baby Bust workers.  The Greenspan Commission made some minor adjustments, and also devised a plan to have the Baby Boom generation prepay some of their Social Security benefits.</p>
<p><strong>The Best of Times</strong></p>
<p>Fast forwarding to today, the Baby Bust cohorts are now between 65 and 79 years of age. This is the peak years for receiving payments from Social Security and Medicare.  In the coming years, the number of Busters will fall significantly and the Boomers will start entering their retirement years.</p>
<p>But right now the Baby Boom cohorts are in their peak earning years. So from a demographic perspective, these are the <strong>best of times</strong>. America is seeing lower than normal expenditures for elderly social programs and higher than normal economic activity.</p>
<p>One would expect Social Security to be running a huge surplus. And it is. And one would expect the Federal government to be running a large surplus too. But it isn&#8217;t. Also nothing has been done to address the looming medical needs of the Baby Boom generation.</p>
<p><strong>But the news isn&#8217;t all bad.</strong></p>
<p>Social Security is in reasonably good shape. The GAO <a href="http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d05282sp.pdf">projects (pdf)</a> future liabilities of $3.7 Trillion over the next 75 years, but historically their projections have been too pessimistic. More likely Social Security will run close to break even, and by 2050 the discussion might be on how much to cut the payroll tax, especially if the retirement age is gradually increased.</p>
<p>Even though the GAO projects liabilities in excess of $20 Trillion for Medicare alone, there is hope for the health care system.  Currently the US has the most expensive health care system per capita in the World, and some of the worst outcomes for a first world nation. This offers an opportunity to reform the US healthcare system, and luckily there are several examples of systems that provide better outcomes for substantially lower costs. (See Angry Bear&#8217;s and Kash&#8217;s posts on the left under Topics: The U.S. Healthcare System)</p>
<p>And finally, the General Fund deficit needs to be addressed. Kash provided an excellent summary: <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/12/budget-deficit-in-context.html">The Budget Deficit in Context</a>. Clearly the experience of the &#8217;90s provides some guidance to fixing the budget mess. Contrary to Greenspan&#8217;s comments, this will require reversing some or most of the Bush tax shifts. And unfortunately, due to demographics and the age of the Baby Boom generation, the US doesn&#8217;t have a decade to fix the problem.</p>
<p>The message from Americans to their policy makers should be clear: the fiscal debate should be focused on these two areas, health care and the General Fund deficit.</p>

                                <p>While I fundamentally disagree with the premise of the following <a href="http://www.aei.org/publications/pubID.23508,filter.economic/pub_detail.asp">short piece from the AEI</a>, its title is just too funny to pass up:<br />
<blockquote><strong>Congressional Republicans Make French Socialists Look Like Ronald Reagan</strong></p>
<p>As was the case during the Reagan years, the culture of spending has prevailed over the Republican promises to control spending and become fiscally responsible. After too many years in power, Republicans have forgotten the principles and values they should be standing for and have joined hands with the Democrats in the big spending orgy. The drama surrounding a phony savings package presented as a spending cut is the latest example of that behavior&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>Apparently Republicans in Washington still have some way to go before they satisfy their small-government base&#8230;</p>
<p>Kash</p>
<p>UPDATE: Others on the right are now actually starting to talk about the need for higher taxes, as <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/12/04/business/outtax.php">this piece</a> from Sunday&#8217;s IHT reports.  Even Bruce Bartlett is quoted as saying &#8220;I do believe tax increases are absolutely inevitable.&#8221;</p>

His <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2005/12/20051202-2.html">overall performance</a> was much worse than that:<br />
<blockquote>Actually, again, I don&#8217;t know what numbers you&#8217;re using, but the current budget debt is not a problem, but we do not want it to grow as a percentage of the GDP. That&#8217;s the way you want to look at it, is the debt as a percentage of GDP.</p></blockquote>
<p>He does not want the debt to grow as a percentage of GDP?  Might I suggest he call the Council of Economic Advisors and request table B.79 of the Economic Report of the President?  The following chart shows the debt/GDP ratio from 1981 to 2006 (projected).  I started with 1981 to show the dramatic increase in this ratio that was the result of the last time we tried the free lunch philosophy of spend and borrow fiscal policy.  We did manage to reverse the prior escalation of debt during the 1990’s in part by spending restraint but mainly by increasing taxes.  Notice that Bush43’s fiscal fiasco has debt growing faster than GDP, which is not going to change until this Administration dramatically changes its fiscal stance.  <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/12/budget-deficit-in-context.html">Kash</a> provides a very nice historical context on spending and taxes that I suggest Mr. Hubbard review.</p>

<p>Mr. Hubbard was asked about the fact that wages are not keeping pace with inflation – and he replied with something that sounded like he was not prepared:<br />
<blockquote>Well, with respect to wage growth, obviously the problem there is compensation growth continues to &#8212; the compensation for the American worker continues to grow. Wages, particularly for lower-income people, have not grown, and the reason they haven&#8217;t grown is because a bigger and bigger portion of their compensation is going for benefits, especially health care. And that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s so important that this country tackle the escalating costs of health care. The other thing that&#8217;s so important to growing wages is productivity growth. And that&#8217;s one of the &#8212; if you guys are looking for something to talk about in the economic area that really is never talked about, I would encourage you to talk about productivity growth. </p></blockquote>
<p>The problem is there is compensation growth?  People are not talking about productivity growth?  I’ll give Mr. Hubbard partial credit for mentioning health care costs, which Kash has contributed several posts.  I know Mr. Hubbard is a busy person, but might I suggest he consult with the various economist blogs who have been discussing the fact that compensation growth has been less than productivity growth.</p>
