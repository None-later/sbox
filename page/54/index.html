<p>Tax Policy: You Can’t Handle the Truth</p>
<p><a href="http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2012/11/crs-withdraws-study-taxes-growth-mcconnell-hatch.php">Sahil Kapur</a> reports on something that does not surprise me on two levels: <br />
<blockquote>The author of a Congressional Research Service study, who found no evidence that tax cuts for high income earners lead to economic growth, is standing by his work, after the legislative branch’s nonpartisan research arm withdrew the report under pressure from Republican leaders. And Democratic principals are demanding to know why CRS caved to GOP pressure. CRS quietly and quickly pulled the six-week old report, despite the wishes of the research arm’s economic team, the New York Times reported Thursday &#8230; The study, which TPM and others reported on at the time, delved into the last 65 years of U.S. tax policy — specifically how marginal rates on high incomes and capital gains taxes impact decision-making. It concluded that reducing effective taxes on the rich does not generate economic growth, but that it does correlate with rising income inequality in the short term. The report’s conclusions aren’t terribly controversial in mainstream economics.</p></blockquote>
<p>What Thomas Hungerford wrote has indeed been the consensus view among economists who are not prostituting themselves for Mitt Romney&#8230; (More at <i>Econospeak</i>)</p>

<p>This was another mixed employment report.  The headline increase of 171,000 increase in payroll employment and 410,000 rise in employment reported in the household survey appeared strong.  But  other signs of weakness appeared within the report.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Wwjqya2WuEQ/UJPE4YJ4CgI/AAAAAAAACTo/UXi2OqvD67s/s1600/Clipboard01+CHANGE.bmp"><img border="0" height="217" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Wwjqya2WuEQ/UJPE4YJ4CgI/AAAAAAAACTo/UXi2OqvD67s/s320/Clipboard01+CHANGE.bmp" width="320"></a></p>
<p>The 184,000 increase in private payroll employment was the strongest since February.</p>

<div></div>
<div>The unemployment rate ticked up from 7.8 to 7.9.  But this may actually be a bullish development because it stemmed from a 578,000 jump in the labor force.  A large increase in the labor force may mean that people are more optimistic about employment prospects and are rejoining the labor force.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Moreover, the number of people working part time for economic reasons fell -304,000.</div>

<p>But the  work week fell from  33.7 to 33.6 and the index of aggregate hours works fell -0.1 from 103.8 to 103.7.  Relative to the trend establish early in this cycle, hours worked has been weak for several months..</p>

<p>Moreover average hourly earnings was essentially unchanged as it fell from $19.80 to $19.79..<br />The growth in average hourly earnings plunged to  1.2%, an all time record low.</p>

                                <p>(Dan here&#8230; This one is still relevant.  I let it hang in drafts by mistake.)</p>
<p>by Linda Beale</p>
<p>Romney shows he&#8217;s a &#8220;know-it-all&#8221; who has no real ideas at all.</p>
<p>I missed almost all of the first debate but watched most of this second one.  My quick sum-up of the action was the Obama was straightforward, prepared, and much more energetic than in the first debate.  While I don&#8217;t think he has been a great president, he has nonetheless acted on a number of matters in ways that move us away from the disastrous policies of the Bush years&#8211;fairer immigration actions, more interest in the middle class and jobs, wise action to save the auto industry when Romney would have allowed one of the midwest&#8217;s major industries to rot on the vine, attempting to move the corporate tax debate away from giveaways for the multinationals and towards more reasonable tax policies, movement on health care reform (though still not towards the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-payer_health_care">single-payer</a> option that we must eventually embrace), movement on financial institution reform through <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodd%E2%80%93Frank_Wall_Street_Reform_and_Consumer_Protection_Act">Dodd-Frank</a> (though still not sufficient control of the financialization of the economy).</p>
<p>Romney, quite frankly, came across as an arrogant shell who doesn&#8217;t have any substance underneath the expensive coif of hair and Armani suit.  He constantly blames Obama for the Great Recession that stemmed directly from the failed Bush economic policies favored by the Republican party&#8217;s right wing, the same policies that Romney and Ryan want to re-install if they take over the White House.  He consistently fails to acknowledge that the deficits under Obama were temporary ones caused by the trillions of dollars of unnecessary Bush individual and corporate tax cuts, the Bush preemptive wars, the class warfare of tax policies that favor the 1%, privatization of education and the militaryh, and the financialization of the economy egged on under Bush by the right&#8217;s misguided views of &#8220;free&#8221; trade (meaning business can run over the workers and the environment at will and pay less taxes even while causing more societal harm).  Romney (as Obama noted in the debate tonight) goes George W. Bush even further&#8211;he would ruin Medicare by turning it into &#8220;voucher-care&#8221; that was insufficient to meet vulnerable seniors&#8217; needs, and he would destroy Social Security by privatizing it so that seniors are at the whim of the stock market and Wall Street traders for their very livelihood.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Yet this guy born with a silver spoon in his mouth and with a family of connections to power really thinks that he got where he is on his own!  What a laugh.  And then he thinks that he can bamboozle the American people by saying &#8220;I know how to do that&#8221; about creating jobs, getting rid of the deficit, creating growth, solving immigration, making us &#8220;energy dependent in 8 or 5 years&#8221; and everything else he can promise us.  But he doesn&#8217;t think he has to bother to tell us anything about how he will do that.  Often when asked specific questions, he fell back on his &#8220;The last four years with Obama have been awful and I feel your pain&#8221; absurdity,  </p>
<p>His claim of empathy with the ordinary folks asking questions in the audience was absurd because one only has to harken back to that tape of his disdain for the 47%&#8211;and his arrogant view that anyone in that group was dependent on government and unwilling to take personal responsibility for themselves&#8211;to know that he doesn&#8217;t really give a damn about ordinary folk like those in the audience tonight.  He&#8217;d follow that with another claim that he would fix everything because &#8220;I know how to do that&#8221;, yet in every instance there was nary a specific word about  exactly what he would do.  </p>
<p>One thing is for sure&#8211;Romney&#8217;s view that cutting tax rates across the board by 20% will jump-start the economy is &#8220;nonsense&#8221;, as even conservative GOP economist Bruce Bartlett acknowledges.  See Bruce Bartlett, <a href="http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/16/romneys-tax-plan-and-economic-growth/">Romney&#8217;s Tax Plan and Economic Growth</a>, Economix Blog, New York Times (Oct. 16, 2012) (statng that &#8220;the idea that tax reform will jump-start an economy suffering from the after-effects of a cyclical downturn is nonsense&#8221; and concluding that &#8220;even if Mr. Romney’s plan is enacted as proposed the growth effect will be small to nonexistent&#8221;).</p>
<p>On taxes, Romney now claims that he will not cut the amount of taxes paid by the top 5% but will give everybody else a tax cut.  Note that isn&#8217;t the same that he has said for months on end, when he made clear that everybody would get the same 20% rate reduction (which would give the wealthy a huge dollar cut, and the middle class a piddling cut) and mocked Obama for wanting to hold the upper-crust more accountable for helping reduce the deficit.  He claims he&#8217;ll not increase the deficit, even though he wants to cut taxes and eliminate the estate tax and increase military spending.  He won&#8217;t say what deductions he&#8217;ll cut or what protections for the poor he&#8217;ll keep. </p>
<p>He claims the numbers add up but won&#8217;t tell us what the numbers are.   I think it&#8217;s perfectly clear:  he won&#8217;t say how he can do that in a revenue-neutral way because it can&#8217;t be done.  The New York Times editorial yesterday chimed into the growing list of reputable organizations asserting that his numbers simply don&#8217;t add up, noting &#8220;the many deceptions in the campaign’s blue-sky promises of low taxes and instant growth.&#8221;  See Editorial, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/16/opinion/mitt-romney-needs-a-working-calculator.html">Mitt Romney Needs a Working Calculator</a>, New York Times (Oct. 15, 2012). <br />
<blockquote>[The Joint Committee on Taxation] asked its staff what would happen if Congress repealed the biggest tax deductions and loopholes and used the new revenue to lower tax rates. The staff started adding it up: end all itemized deductions, tax capital gains and dividends as ordinary income, and tax the interest on state and local bonds, along with several other revenue-raisers.    <br /><a href="http://media.bloomberg.com/bb/avfile/r9DCbKWFmKdw">The answer came last week</a>: ending all those deductions would only produce enough revenue to <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-12/repealing-deductions-pays-for-4-tax-cuts-study-says.html">lower tax rates by 4 percent</a>. <br />Mitt Romney says he can lower tax rates by 20 percent and pay for it by ending deductions. The joint committee’s math makes it clear that that is impossible. Id.</p></blockquote>
<p>Note that Romney doesn&#8217;t intend to tax dividends and capital gains at the same ordinary income rate that us ordinary folks pay on our compensation income, so he wouldn&#8217;t even get to a 4% reduction in rates with his version of tax &#8220;simplification.&#8221;  He wants to keep allowing people like him to get a tax-advantaged &#8220;preferential rate&#8221; on carried interest that they get as their compensation in vulture capital &#8220;private equity&#8221; funds that buy up American businesses and load them with debt and offshore their jobs.  He wants to keep taxing capital gains and dividends at the ridiculously low rates achieved by the Bush tax cuts that were a major factor in driving us from surplus to deficit.  He even wants to cut capital gains and dividend and interest tax rates to zero for those making less than $200,000.  (<em>Of course, that group doesn&#8217;t have much of that kind of capital income&#8211;it is mostly the province of the very rich at the top.  One suspects the rate cut for the upper middle class that would apply to is just a prelude, like most of the Bush-era tax cuts, to a Republican push to eliminate taxes entirely on capital income, which Romney and Ryan have supported in the past.</em>)  He wants to cut taxes for the huge multinational corporations and encourage them to continue moving our jobs offshore.</p>
<p>There is no way that such a tax policy makes sense for America.  It will let the rich get richer, when we are already at a point where the middle class is shrinking because of the way big business has grabbed all the productivity gains for the managers and owners and left ordinary workers hanging out to dry.</p>
<p>Reaganomics&#8211;with its push for privatization, tax cuts, militarization, and deregulation&#8211;stabbed at the heart of the US economy.  The Bush tax cuts drove us from surplus to deficit in one fell swoop and set the stage for the Republican obstructionist games that have gone on during the four years of the Obama administration, in which the radical right GOP has cared more about pushing for extremist policies beneficial to the wealthy and the big corporations they run rather than considering what is good for the country.  Romneyomics would be even worse&#8211;right-wing market fundamentalism at its most extreme, with the rich making off like bandits and the rest of us left to scramble for crumbs. Surely the American folk aren&#8217;t going to buy this idea of rehashing the very ideas that got us into the Great Recession mess from the guy who says &#8220;I know how to run the country because I got rich as a vulture capitalist&#8221;.</p>

<p>If Democrats can bring Indiana, Virginia, North Carolina, and Florida (or even two or three of them) firmly into the Democratic camp, the game is over for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>Those states are clearly where Democrats’ long-term, big-picture political efforts need to be focused in the next two to four years.</p>

                                                                            <a href="./../category/steve-roth/index.html" class="post-category-41" title="Steve Roth"><div class="color-box"></div>Steve Roth</a>                                                                     </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>I’ve often commented on how childish, really <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/to-claim-objectivism-at-20-is-predictable-to-claim-objectivism-at-60-is-plain-idiocy.html">adolescent</a>, the views of libertarians are. But it’s rare that I see such a stunning example.</p>
<p>In a recent <em>NYT</em> “<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2012/10/30/do-we-really-need-fema/the-free-market-can-do-a-better-job-than-fema">Room for Debate</a>,” Russell Sobel of The Citadel gives us this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Fixing disaster relief is simple: greater use of decentralized markets, and focusing government on its proper role.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After all, “Economists from Adam Smith to Friedrich Hayek to Milton Friedman have stressed the inherent problems in central planning.”</p>
<p>So there you go. QED.</p>
<p>Here, Sobel explains, is the “simple” solution to solving any problems of disaster relief:</p>
<blockquote><p>By renting the [Chicago Board of Trade] trading floor and using the exchange, supplies and services would be better allocated to disaster victims than they are now by FEMA.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because:</p>
<blockquote><p>Such mechanisms simply work better</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s so simple! And obvious! Why didn’t anybody think of this before? Heck, <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/to-claim-objectivism-at-20-is-predictable-to-claim-objectivism-at-60-is-plain-idiocy.html">a thirteen-year-old could have come up with it</a>.</p>
<p>And all of this is before we ever ask the question: does our disaster relief system need fixing? It certainly did under W. And: what part of it needs fixing? If recent fiascos provide any answer, the missing piece was effective national leadership.</p>
<p>Given that effective leadership, America seems to have <em>far and away</em> the best disaster relief system in the world — private, state, local, and federal combined, all working together. Just look at our preparedness and response this week — awe-inspiring.</p>
<p>Conservatives: Am I wrong?</p>
<p>And: You want to <em>dismantle</em> it?</p>
<p>So much for American exceptionalism.</p>

                                <div>Update: David Rosnick of CEPR questions this analysis.  Update to come when I have Internet access again&#8211;which probably will be Saturday at the earliest.
<p>Brad DeLong got me thinking a few days ago, and <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2012/10/dudley-on-mortgage-market-impairment-ft-alphaville.html">not in a good way</a>, when he quoted the brilliantly (and brilliantly-named) Cardiff Garcia:</p>
<blockquote><p>Thus far the surging mortgage origination business at banks has been concentrated in refinancing rather than purchases. The refi boom is great but can only last so long, as Dudley writes, and from a macroeconomic perspective has less of an impact than a housing purchase and construction rebound&#8230;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m thinking that rather understates the case.</p>
<p>There are at least two of us on this blog who have benefitted from recent refis. (I won’t out the other one, save to say they got better terms than I did.)  In my case, the net savings in payments was about $700/month—not exactly chump change, unless you’re Tagg Romney.</p>
<p>But let’s follow the flows here, pretending that all transactions are with two banks for reasons that will be clear.  My refinancing means that Bank A receives a lump-sum payout of the balance of my mortgage. But then they have to put that money to work—and they are not going to receive my old interest rate on those replacement loans (if any).</p>
<p>Bank B is receiving current market rates on the refi. So it’s new lending to them. But that’s neutralized on the supply, replaced by Bank A having “freed up” my old loan.  </p>
<p>Similarly, on the demand side, my demand is satisfied—and my demand now is $700/month less than it was before.</p>
<p>So the S-D lines are stable for the assets—or even reduced due to the decline in demand.  Meanwhile, the flows into financial institutions (assets to them) are reduced.</p>
<p>So if A = L + E and A is reduced, what happens to Liabilities?</p>
<p>If you assume standard economic theory, I save that $700.  (Realistically, I spend it and someone else saves it, but the net savings in the economy still goes up $700.)  That savings is a Liability, let us say to the Bank A.</p>
<p>Bank A’s Balance Sheet is now:  Assets down $700/month, Liabilities up $700/months.  To balance that equation, Equity has to go down $1,400/month.</p>
<p>Bank B has Assets up $700/month, Liabilities unchanged, and therefore Equity up $700/month.</p>
<p>Net for the system is that Assets are unchanged, Liabilities are up $700/month and Equity is down $700/month.</p>
<p><em>Ceteris paribus,</em> refinancing reduces the inefficiencies in the banking system (the above-market asset valuation is replaced by an at-market asset). In doing so, it reduces Bank Equity and increases Bank Liabilities.</p>
<p>Unless lending to other sectors of the economy increases, refinancings that do not take cash (“equity”) out of the property appear to be contractionary.</p>

                                <p>It has been suggested that the rapid increase in the prices of <i>fish, fowl, meat and eggs</i> for about two years following October, 2009 was the result of QE causing inflation in these items.  From <a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-zoPsh48ZiKU/T-ybVwebLSI/AAAAAAAAN84/f-oGQvaBh9U/s1600/SP500QEJune2012.jpg">this Calculated Risk graph</a>,  we can get the QE date line.  QE was announced on Nov 25, 2008, and  expanded in April 2009.  It ended in May, 2010.  QE II was hinted at in  Sept, 2010, announced in Nov 2010, and ended in August 2011.</p>
<p>The  timing correspondence is less than stellar, since the YoY increase in  prices for those food items dropped like a rock from October, &#8217;08 though  Oct. &#8217;09.  It then shot up to a 7 1/2 year high in May of 2011.</p>
<p>This can be seen in the red line of Graph 1, which also shows the CPI for all items except food and energy (CPILFESL) in blue.</p>
<p>
<div><a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fredgraph.png?g=cjv"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fredgraph.png?g=cjv" width="400"></a></div>
<div> Graph 1 YoY Price increases for Selected Food Stuffs and All Items Less Food and Energy</div>
<p>To  assume a cause and effect relationship, you have to account for a time  lag of a year from the announcement and 6 months from the expansion of  QE to the turn around in those price increases from the Oct &#8217;09 bottom.   Remember, through the first 11 months of QE, the YoY change in those  prices dropped dramatically.  Between May and November, 2010, while no  QE program was in effect, these prices had the steepest part of their  rise.  After QE II ended in August, 2011, the YoY price increase  remained high for those items until the end of the year, and then fell  rapidly.</p>
<p>A longer view reveals that the increase in those food prices oscillates continuously around the <i>All Items Less Food and Energy</i> line.  The trough to trough period is irregular, averaging 3.52 years  with a standard deviation of 0.45 year (5 measurements).   The trough to  trough time from May, &#8217;06 to Oct., &#8217;09 was a very typical 3.4 years.   It is very hard to look at that graph and see anything unusual about the  2008-2012 region, other than the depth of the trough shortly after the  Great Recession.</p>
<p>It appeared to me that the blue line  of Graph 1 might be a crude approximation of a long average of the red  line.  This turns out not quite to be the case, since the two lines are  measuring different baskets of goods.  What we have is the YoY increase  for these food items oscillating around its own mean. That sounds like a  tautology, but let&#8217;s look a little deeper.</p>
<p>Graph 2  shows the same data, along with some long averages of the food stuffs  YoY price increase line.   These are the 5 Yr (light blue), 8 Yr  (yellow), and 13 Yr (purple) moving averages, and the average for the  whole data set, 2.9 (bright green).  I&#8217;ve also included an envelope one  standard deviation (3.06) above (5.96) and below (-0.17) the mean in  dark green.</p>
<div><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-fMhjpfDLaQ0/UJGOLZzqKkI/AAAAAAAACCs/yqKBh69hzPE/s1600/fishy+fowl+inflation.jpg"><img border="0" height="271" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-fMhjpfDLaQ0/UJGOLZzqKkI/AAAAAAAACCs/yqKBh69hzPE/s400/fishy+fowl+inflation.jpg" width="400"></a></div>
<div>Graph 2 YoY Price increases for Selected Food Stuffs with Avgs and All Items Less Food and Energy</div>
<p>This  (sort of) resembles a control chart.  The +/- Std. Dev. envelope isn&#8217;t a  hard barrier, but does tend to turn the data path back toward the mean,  unless something strange happens.  Frex, the big rise from late &#8217;02 to  early &#8217;04 followed the Iraq invasion and resulting disruption in  petroleum pricing.  The &#8217;09 trough was the result of the Great  Recession.  These are explainable variations.</p>
<p>Note also  that the moving average lines tended to run below the CPILFESL line  prior to late 2002, and have tended to run above it since.  This is to  be expected since these items are basically the top of the food chain  and have several layers of fuel dependent contributors in their cost  structure.  Recall that until 2002, fuel prices were low, and since then  (except for the Great Recession) <a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fredgraph.png?g=cjB">have increased steadily</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m  quite sympathetic to the idea that QE has done very little to help ease  the economic doldrums following the GR.  But I see no reason at all to  believe that it has contributed to the pain and suffering of ordinary  citizens at either the grocery store or the gas pump.</p>
<p>Maybe there have been real downsides to QE.  Any thoughts on what they might be and how to quantify them?</p>

                                <p>by David Zetland    <a href="http://www.blogger.com/profile/11677758798533719965">David Zetland</a> is a senior water economist at Wageningen University in the Netherlands and maintains a blog on water issues at <a href="http://www.aguanomics.com/2012/10/will-san-diego-make-desalination-mistake.html" title="http://www.aguanomics.com/2012/10/will-san-diego-make-desalination-mistake.html">Aguanomics</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.aguanomics.com/2012/10/its-not-as-simple-as-selling-books.html">It&#8217;s not as simple as selling books</a></p>
<p>Many people ask me to comment on statements made by journalists covering the water sector. Most of the time, I am happy to see journalists covering water issues, since they tend to promote awareness of the need to change our ways, but there are two big exceptions. The first is when a lazy journalist fails to see that water shortages are not caused by a failure to rain as much as a failure (of managers) to keep demand below supply. In those cases, I often leave comments or send emails to correct them, hoping that they look a little deeper in the future.   </p>
<p>The second problem is much more dangerous: a journalist posing as an expert.    </p>
<p>But what does it take to be an &#8220;expert&#8221;? Well, it doesn&#8217;t mean you need a PhD or need to spend years studying the topic. You need a decent framework that explains causes and effects within local institutions that also matches the knowledge and intuition of those who have lived with the situation for many years.     <br />Journalists can certainly explain the causes of a problem, how to resolve it, and why resolution may not be occurring. That&#8217;s why I admire the work of <a href="http://www.aguanomics.com/2012/06/when-rivers-run-dry-review.html">Fred Pearce</a> and <a href="http://www.aguanomics.com/2012/01/blue-revolution-review.html">Cynthia Barnett</a>, for example.    </p>
<p>But then we run into journalists who turn a few shallow anecdotes into a problem that can be &#8220;solved&#8221; in ways that won&#8217;t work. Although some of these journalists are sloppy (see above), others intentionally over-reach because <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2012/03/on-journalists-moonlighting-as-big-ticket-speakers-for-financial-firms.html">they are making money</a>.    </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to name two here (with specific examples) because I want to call attention to <i>their need</i> to do a better job in their jobs as &#8220;experts&#8221; (I&#8217;m not saying anything about their work as journalists) and <i>our need</i> to bring an appropriately critical perspective to their opinions. <br />
<hr>Why is this post important? People with limited attention rely on &#8220;prime time&#8221; outlets rather than study complex problems. That means that mistakes in those outlets can lead to an abundance of bad decisions.  <br />
<hr>So, that&#8217;s a preamble for why we need to care about journalists&#8217; accuracy, but let me also also clarify why I &#8212; as an academic &#8212; feel a need to correct their contributions to public discourse. It turns out to be more complicated than &#8220;that&#8217;s what academics do.&#8221;  </p>
<p>As you know, I&#8217;ve been giving my opinion on water policy for many years, writing on this blog, giving public talks, holding discussions with experts and stakeholders, and so on. In most circumstances, I combine my knowledge of economics, a familiarity with facts, and a sensitivity to other perspectives into an opinion on what I consider the &#8220;right&#8221; thing to do.  </p>
<p>Economists say that I do &#8220;normative economics,&#8221; i.e., the economics of what should be, but most economists practice what&#8217;s called &#8220;positive economics,&#8221; i.e., the economics of what is. These positive economists may carry out research describing the connection between water service and child mortality, or measuring the efficiency of water markets or the impact of new water tariffs on consumption behavior. I go further, using these results to advocate for policy changes.  </p>
<p>In that sense, I am not an academic concerned with the details of reality as much as a pundit* promising to deliver a future to those who follow my advice. I am not alone in that, and thus we arrive at the problem of identifying who&#8217;s right, a problem that is often ignored because people standing on high are more often believed than people standing on firm ground.  </p>
<p>It&#8217;s well-known, for example, that there are two ways to become a famous blogger: be famous or work hard.   <br />This definition will raise a warning signal to those interested in maximizing the quality of debate. There may be, for example, hundreds of people qualified to advise on improving urban water management, but these people may not get as much attention as a single tweet from Madonna (&#8220;OMG, I&#8217;m no virgin, but showering in recycled toilet water? Yuck. Gimme NATURAL water&#8221;).  </p>
<p>That tweet will be heard by many. Most will ignore it, but others will change their opinion about recycled water. In the resulting debate over indirect potable reuse, experts are buried under an onslaught of collective ignorance, the motion to recycle water is denied, and the utility continues to overpump a river full of wastewater into the drinking water system &#8212; to the future regret of everyone.  </p>
<p>The problem of short and clever vs 78 pages and precise is widespread. We see it in political debates, cocktail chatter, and the know-it-all friends with the same solution to every problem (some variation of education, regulation or markets).  </p>
<p>These opinions may be 50, 70 or even 90 percent right, but they tend to leave out caveats, qualifications and limitations that can render the opinion irrelevant or counterproductive. The trouble comes when readers and listeners assume the opinion is 100 percent right &#8212; perhaps more right than even the author would admit, given his attempt to present the essence of a complex idea while still understanding its limitations.   </p>
<p>That&#8217;s why academics can provide a useful service by recognizing the limits to what they know or can claim and explaining how complex systems are neither simple enough to understand nor manipulate. Academics, in short, are trained to be humble with their ideas.**  </p>
<p>So what can we learn from academics?   
<ol>
<li>Take the position of the other side, to understand and address their objections. This process means that you will need to either admit or correct your weaknesses. </li>
<li>Contextualize your idea within the conditions where it is appropriate while acknowledging that those conditions are not universal. </li>
<li>Think very carefully about how your idea will interact with existing policies, taking into account the ways that people have tried to deal with the problem &#8212; or not &#8212; in the past.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, after all that long introduction and context, let me get to the journalists whose opinions are not expert in a few recent pieces.  </p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.aguanomics.com/2011/07/big-thirst-review.html">my review</a> of Charles Fishman&#8217;s <i>Big Thirst</i>, I said &#8220;his journalistic style was too breezy.&#8221; Indeed, his op/eds at <a href="http://newswatch.nationalgeographic.com/2012/02/10/ireland-charge-for-water/">National Geographic</a> and the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/17/opinion/dont-waste-this-drought.html">New York Times</a> are oversimplified and misleading. In the former, he omits the facts that Ireland has charged residential users for water in the past and that non-residential users pay for metered water. Besides these omissions, which make his claims sound more significant than they are, he forgets (or does not know) that meters are not always cost-efficient to install and that customers always pay for meters, either up-front or in the long run.</p>
<p>In his NYT piece, Fishman&#8217;s &#8220;obvious&#8221; command and control &#8220;solutions&#8221; have been tried in many places. In some they work, in others they are inefficient from a cost or water perspective. He also omits the more fundamental discussion of why other, more effective actions are not taken (raising water prices in Las Vegas, for example) &#8212; an omission that makes me wonder if he&#8217;s looked any deeper than press releases and speeches by water managers and politicians. Journalists sometimes get a little over-used to dealing with the contents of the box they are given instead of looking outside the box &#8212; a job that academics (and activists) are accustomed to executing. His over-simplified perspective may sell books, but his solutions are more likely to be counterproductive than useful.</p>
<p>Frederick Kaufman expresses a fear of water markets in <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v490/n7421/full/490469a.html">Nature</a> and <a href="http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2012/10/water-derivatives/">Wired</a> magazines that is straight out of science fiction: global water markets in which derivatives allow traders to hedge shortage in Kazakstan with grain production in Australia by borrowing against wetlands in Canada. His working hypothesis is weak on many levels. I responded to his Nature piece and Wired interview with several comments, but these will do here:  
<ul>
<li>Water is NOT EVEN CLOSE to fungible. Are you kidding about &#8220;icebergs and aquifers&#8221; as interchangeable? Go get $1 of tap water (about one cubic meter) and then move it to the other side of the room. Hard to do? Sure, since 1,000 liters weighs one ton. Water systems — let alone markets — will NEVER be integrated like oil, gold or computer ship markets because the costs of transactions are so high. </li>
<li>The greatest distortions in the efficient use of water are caused by political interference. In this sense, bad water management is the same as bad financial management, but don&#8217;t blame markets for bailing out &#8220;too big to fail&#8221; fools or failing to get water to efficient farmers or taps in poor countries. Blame politicians. </li>
<li>Water markets have been VERY useful in reducing water waste and directing water from the powerful and rich to the poor and powerless &#8211; because the rich are getting water at a lower price than the poor are willing to pay&#8230; </li>
</ul>
<p>Go read these pieces and ask yourself: Do these guys know what they are talking about? Should politicians and citizens turn their views and ideas into policies for managing our water? More fundamentally, remember that some people put out uneven work (I know I do). These pieces may not represent the norm for these guys (I sure hope not), but they risk damaging reputations built on solid work that combines relevant facts into a plausible narrative to explain how a situation arose and how it might be improved.  <br />No matter your answer, please leave comments here (or there) to tell me and them what we got right or wrong.  </p>
<p>Bottom Line: Journalists can cause a lot of damage when they misdiagnose problems, offer the wrong solution and appeal to fear, uncertainty and dread. What they need to do &#8212; and what I try to do &#8212; is explain the facts and barriers to change before suggesting gradual reforms to improve our water management.   <br />
<hr>* &#8220;Pundit&#8221; comes from &#8220;pandit,&#8221; a Hindi word for a scholar or teacher who has mastered a topic (classically Sanskrit language, vedic scriptures, Hindu law, etc.) under a guru. This definition could be applied to any &#8220;doctor of philosophy,&#8221; since PhD programs are designed to impart mastery over a topic to a student under supervision. I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if pandits were also supposed to possess wisdom, a characteristic not required of PhDs.  <br />** I may be giving academics too much credit, as many of them disregard their training when it comes to arguing that their opinion is right &#8220;because I have a PhD.&#8221; Academics, OTOH, are routinely absent from debates in which they could make a useful contribution, due to a combination of shyness (PhDs are known for long hours of study not extroversion), professional incentives (professional publication is more important than social impact), and aversion to debate with non-academics who may neither respect their credentials nor engage in &#8220;structured fair play.&#8221;</p>

<p> Romney&#8217;s CRUT Tax Shelter\</p>
<p> The Bloomberg press has looked further at Romney&#8217;s use of trusts and other arrangements to avoid taxes, using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_information_legislation">Freedom of Information Act</a> requests to obtain more information than was released by Romney in his meager tax return release. Romney established a charitable trust in 1996 of a type that Congress cracked down on in 1997 (regrettably, a crackdown that grandfathered existing arrangements, which is the way so many rich people get to keep using abusive shelters). See Jesse Drucker, <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-29/romney-avoids-taxes-via-loophole-cutting-mormon-donations.html">Romney Avoids Taxeds via Loophole Cutting Mormon Donations</a>, Bloomberg.com (Oct. 29, 2012).</p>
<p>So what did Romney do.  He used a &#8220;charitable remainder unitrust&#8221; (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charitable_trust">CRUT</a>) in a way that alllowed him to use the tax-exempt status of the Mormon Church (his primary charitable beneficiary) to defer taxes for more than 15 years.  The trust benefits Romney considerably, by letting him benefit from the tax-free treatment that the charitable beneficiary has when they sell assets for a profit.and leaves the church less than current law requires for a trust.   And it favors Romney over the church, because he gets a guaranteed payout from the trust (which converted most of its assets to cash in 2007) and the church only gets what&#8217;s left at the end, if anything.  Current trends suggest there won&#8217;t be anything left for the charity at the end. </p>
<p>“The main benefit from a charitable remainder trust is the renting from your favorite charity of its exemption from taxation,” [Jonathan] Blattmachr [, a trusts and estates lawyer] said. Despite the name, giving a gift or getting a charitable deduction “is just a throwaway,” he said. “I used to structure them so the value dedicated to charity was as close to zero as possible without being zero.”</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>When individuals fund a charitable remainder unitrust, or “CRUT,” they defer capital gains taxes on any profit from the sale of the assets, and receive a small upfront charitable deduction and a stream of yearly cash payments. Like an individual retirement account, the trust allows money to grow tax deferred, while like an annuity it also pays Romney a steady income. After the funder’s death, the trust’s remaining assets go to a designated charity.</p>
<p>Romney’s CRUT, which is only a small part of the $250 million that Romney’s campaign cites as his net worth, has been paying him 8 percent of its assets each year. As the Romneys have received these payments, the money that will potentially be left for charity has declined from at least $750,000 in 2001 to $421,203 at the end of 2011. Id.</p>
<p>Under the 1997 change to the law, Congress required that the present value projected to be left for charity must equal at least 10% of the initial contribution. Romney&#8217;s CRUT doesn&#8217;t satisfy this requirement but was grandfathered in.  The principal of the CRUT has dwindled to about half what it was.  In the meantime, the Romney&#8217;s have enjoyed considerable tax savings due to the way the CRUT works.</p>
<p>This information is revealing for two reasons.  First, it demonstrates yet again that the Romney&#8217;s are eager to use whatever mechanisms they can to reduce taxes, even though their millions are due in no small part to the way taxpayers make business possible (from courts to roads to police to the military to &#8220;rule of law&#8221; to relatively low funding costs for borrowing in the United States, etc.).   One suspects that the reason Romney has stonewalled the public on his tax returns is that there is lots more of this nature shown therein, including possibly his participation in voluntary disclosure regarding offshore accounts (that otherwise might have resulted in criminal tax evasion charges).</p>
<p>Second, it shows that Congress recognized that CRUTs didn&#8217;t make sense.  So we have to ask why Congress didn&#8217;t eliminate CRUTs altogether, rather than continuing to allow the gambit, and why, if it were going to continue to allow the gambit, it didn&#8217;t terminate the favorable treatment of any existing CRUT that didn&#8217;t satisfy the minimal funding requirement the new law included (10% of the original contribution has to go to charity before the donor can enjoy the immense benefit of the capital gains deferral thereby).   Congress should allow the estate tax to lapse back to the pre-Bush levels, and it should then buttress the estate tax by legislating the end to the many different devices used by estate lawyers to get around the tax while still providing most of the benefits of the assets to the estate planners&#8211;CRUTs and similar estate-planning trusts are prime targets for action by Congress.</p>
