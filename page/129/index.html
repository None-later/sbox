                                <p><strong><em>Or:</em> Even a Stopped Clock is Right, Eventually</strong>
<p><strong></strong>For quite a while I’ve been explaining the rabid, frantic vehemence of tea partiers and Republicans in general with a single visualization:</p>
<p>They’ve got their backs against the seawall, and a massive, overwhelming demographic tidal wave is looming over them.</p>
<p>The terror that situation provokes among <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/tea-partiers-old-white-rich-educated-men.html">old, white, rich</a>, “<a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/republicans-more-education-less-reality.html">educated</a>” male types is enough to mobilize a hell of a lot of political activity and influence (especially when it’s coopted and channeled by tens of billions of dollars in corporate propaganda). This goes a long way toward explaining the backlash of the 2010 election.</p>
<p>But desperate maneuvering can’t <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cnut_the_Great">stop the tides</a>.</p>
<p>This demographic notion got its first major airing in Judis and Teixeira’s 2002 <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Emerging-Democratic-Majority-John-Judis/dp/0743254783/">The Emerging Democratic Majority</a>, </em>which seems to have been a little ahead of it’s time. But as Jonathan Chait suggests in ”<a href="http://nymag.com/print/?/news/features/gop-primary-chait-2012-3">2012 or Never</a>,” the demographic clock may finally be ticking up to high noon.</p>
<blockquote><p>The modern GOP—the party of Nixon, Reagan, and both Bushes—is staring down its own demographic extinction.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite assorted and sadly wishful pooh-poohing on the right (“the Republicans will just rebrand themselves”; “second-generation Latinos will be more conservative”), the demographic reality is displayed quite starkly in two graphs from a recent <a href="http://www.pewhispanic.org/files/2011/12/Deportations-and-Latinos.pdf">Pew report</a> (PDF; hat tip <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2012/03/04/is-the-republican-party-almost-over/can-obama-recapture-the-hispanic-vote">Ruy Teixeira</a>).</p>

<p>Say “buh bye.”</p>
<p>Nevertheless, as Robert Reich <a href="http://robertreich.org/post/18391045294">reminds</a> us: for the present, “the loony right” remains “a clear and present danger.”</p>

                                <p>Jon Hammond from <i>econographia</i> reseached the topic of contraceptive pills on the cost aspects involved with health insurance at my request.  Instead of losing real data in the comments sections on previous posts, I am posting his findings here:</p>
<p>  Here are some of the empirical findings dealing with the insurance costs and cost-savings of coverage for contraceptive services.     The direct costs of providing contraception as part of a health insurance plan are very low and do not add more than approximately 0.5% to the premium costs per adult enrollee (see Daroch, J. E.). In 1998, Buck Consultants estimated that the direct cost of providing contraceptive benefits averaged $21 per enrollee per year (see Daroch, J. E.). The most recent actuarial analysis, completed by the Actuarial Research Corporation in July 2011, using data from 2010, estimated a cost of about $26 per year per enrolled female (see Callahan, C.)</p>
<p>However, with respect to the effect on insurance premiums when medical costs associated with unintended pregnancies are taken into account … including costs of prenatal care, pregnancy complications, and deliveries … the net effect on premiums is close to zero (see Washington Business Group on Health, Sept 2000). And when time away from work and lost productivity are considered (<i>factors salient to employers</i>) . . the total costs to employers are reduced.</p>
<p>PriceWaterhouseCoopers issued a report in 2007 which found that providing contraceptive services yields a net cost-savings (see Campbell, K.P.).     </p>
<p>The cost-savings impact of contraceptive services has also been demonstrated via the Medicaid Section 1115 Family Planning Demonstrations conducted in six states in the 1990s.     Please refer to Tthe February 2012 U.S. DHHS brief on this subject .. it contains both the content and full citations noted in abbreviated form above .. see here:</p>

                                <p>Simon Johnson at <i>Baseline Scenario </i> writes in <a href="http://baselinescenario.com/2012/03/02/making-the-united-states-more-like-greece/">Making the United States More Like Greece</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>One of the big problems in Greece over the past decade or so is that the government was not honest with its data. Various people assisted in the matter – including Goldman Sachs with respect to some debt issues – but ultimately this was a political decision at the highest level. The people running the country decided to conceal the true nature of their budget and their debt. This deception ended up costing the country dearly – completely undermining its credibility under pressure and making it much harder to turn the fiscal and economic situation around.<br />…<br />In the modern United States, cutting taxes leads to lower revenue and larger budget deficits. There are no two ways about this – as Ronald Reagan discovered in the early 1980s. (In our new book, <em><a href="http://whitehouseburning.com/">White House Burning</a></em>, we go through the evidence on this point in detail, including important work by Greg Mankiw, former top economic adviser to George W. Bush and now working with Mitt Romney, which confirms that cutting taxes in the U.S. will lower revenue.)<br />But many Republicans feel that this is not true – in my conversations with them, for example in congressional hearings over the past year, the conviction seems to be that the research on this topic is bad science, even when done by Republicans. But convincing the CBO to abandon its proven and sensible approach to budget scoring has been difficult.<br />&#8230;<br />The solution currently under consideration is simple in its elegance – and downright frightening in its implications.</p></blockquote>

<p>Today’s real retail sales gave the ECB and EU heads of state another reason to keep their fingers crossed for stability of the Euro area economy (<a href="http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_PUBLIC/4-05032012-AP/EN/4-05032012-AP-EN.PDF">.pdf of release</a>). In January, volume adjusted retail sales increased 0.3% in the Euro area (EA) and broke a 4-month trend downward. On a 3-month annualized basis, though, real retail sales are falling at a 2.2% pace. Therefore, on a trended basis the second derivative may be stabilizing but the first derivative remains conspicuously negative.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/03/EA_retail_sales1.jpg"><img alt="" height="455" src="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/03/EA_retail_sales1.jpg" width="600"></a></p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />I suppose that the ECB and EU heads of state will take this month of reprieve to pat themselves on the back for policy well done. However, in looking at the cross section of the monthly gains, France was the primary driver of the regional improvement, +2.1% over the month. We’re not out of the woods yet.</p>

<p>Greece, Spain, and Italy haven’t reported for January, so we’ll have to wait on the over or under regarding revisions. I’ll take the under, however, given that Spanish and Italian service PMIs are in the low 40′s with the employment component a serious drag (<a href="http://www.markiteconomics.com/MarkitFiles/Pages/ViewPressRelease.aspx?ID=9241">.pdf of the Markit release</a>).</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <div>Seriously.  In the rambling press release that he self-styled an apology to Georgetown U. law student Sandra Fluke for calling her a slut and a prostitute, Limbaugh groused:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Amazingly, when there is the slightest bit of opposition to this new welfare entitlement being created, then all of a sudden we hate women. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>He then explained his position thusly:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>I personally do not agree that American citizens should pay for these social activities.  What happened to personal responsibility and accountability? Where do we draw the line? If this is accepted as the norm, what will follow? Will we be debating if taxpayers should pay for new sneakers for all students that are interested in running to keep fit?
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>So even as late as yesterday afternoon when he released the statement, he’s claiming that <i>taxpayers</i>would be paying the part of employee and student healthcare premiums that cover contraceptives.  And that taxpayers pay for running pants, shorts and tank tops for employees and students who jog, but don’t pay for the Nikes and Reeboks. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>He apparently doesn’t read Angry Bear (see “Will ‘We’ Really Be Paying Sandra Fluke’s Healthcare Insurance Premiums?”, below.)  He should, though.  Dana Loesch, though, clearly does.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>What? You’ve never heard of Dana Loesch?  Well, you’re in good company.  Mine.  I’d never heard of her until this morning, when I read<a href="http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/03/rush-limbaugh-apologizes-for-verbal-attack/"> the New York Times article</a>about Limbaugh’s statements.  The article says:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>At least one conservative commentator, Dana Loesch, appeared to back Mr. Limbaugh’s original sentiments, writing on Twitter on Saturday, “If you expect me to pay higher insurance premiums to cover your ‘free’ birth control, I can call you whatever I want.”
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>So, whatever the merits of her claim to a right to libel anyone whose medical insurance coverage and use raises “her” insurance premiums, Loesch at least does recognize the difference between private insurance premiums and coverage and taxpayer-funded welfare entitlements.  Limbaugh does not.   
</p>
</div>
<p>
<div>Happily, a mainstream media pundit understands this non-trivial distinction, too, and mentions it.  In her New York Times column today, Maureen Dowd <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/04/opinion/sunday/dowd-have-you-no-shame-rush.html">writes</a>:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>[Limbaugh] said insuring contraception would represent another “welfare entitlement,” which is wrong — tax dollars would not provide the benefit, employers and insurance companies would. And women would not be getting paid just “to have sex.” They’d be getting insurance coverage toward the roughly $1,000 annual expense of trying to avoid unwanted pregnancies and abortions, and to control other health conditions.
</p>
</div>

<div>So, AB readers, do you think Dowd reads AB?  Nah.  She probably figured it out all by herself. But Loesch probably reads AB.  Okay, or Forbes online. (<a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2012/03/03/rush-limbaugh-sandra-fluke-and-why-is-contraception-part-of-health-insurance-anyway/">Thanks for linking to it, Tim Worstall!)</a> For better or worse.  I mean, I’d hate to be, say, (as Bruce Webb points out in a comment to my earlier post) a skier or mountain climber who works for the same employer that Loesch does, or at least has the same insurance carrier that she has.

<div>Wouldn’t want Loesch to accuse them of having murdered their mother, or something.

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>In <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2012/03/03/rush-limbaugh-sandra-fluke-and-why-is-contraception-part-of-health-insurance-anyway/">this Forbes article</a>,  Tim Worstall says he agrees with generally available birth control, but  questions why health insurance should pay for it.    Specifically he  says:  &#8220;<i>But I really cannot see the point of trying to have health care  insurance which then covers a multitude of treatments that aren’t really  insurable matters, contraception being just one of these (regular  shots, ‘flu vaccines, general everyday low level treatments in fact).</i>&#8221;  This is after he points out that, per Wikipedia, &#8220;<i>Insurance is a form of risk management primarily used to hedge against the risk of a contingent, uncertain loss.</i>&#8220;</p>
<p>The  first question this prompts in my mind regarding insuring against  (unwanted) pregnancy is what loss does that pregnancy entail?  The  answer is large measures of personal freedom, hundreds of thousands of  dollars in unplanned child-rearing expenses, and quality of life for the  potential child resulting from the pregnancy.  These are significant  risks, with <a href="http://www.prochoiceforum.org.uk/psy_ocr2.php">ramifications for society at large</a>,  involving the employability and  productivity (in a purely economic  sense) of the involved woman, and her uses of discretionary income.   Furthermore, unwanted children, particularly if the mother is single,  are more liable to live in poverty and neglect, suffer from illness and  abuse, become delinquent, and develop into adults that are  psychologically disturbed, draw welfare, and commit crimes.</p>
<p>So, there are significant personal hardships and costly negative externalities that result form unwanted pregnancies.  </p>
<p>Is it ironic that in the past right-wingers have proposed the <a href="http://mississippiappendectomy.wordpress.com/2007/11/19/black-women-in-the-1960s-and-1970s/">forced sterilization of welfare mothers</a>?  </p>
<p>Also, the hormone therapy we call &#8220;birth control&#8221; has many other preventive medial uses, including controlling <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001913/">endometriosis</a>.  So a focus in the merely contraceptive attributes is misplaced.</p>
<p>Currently,  more than half the states mandate that hormonal birth control be  included in prescription coverage, and since 1998, this coverage has  been included for all federal employees.  There is ample precedent for  this coverage, and insurance companies are well equipped to handle it.</p>
<p>Worstall conducts this thought experiment.</p>
<blockquote><p> Just to make up some numbers, say that the preferred method costs $30 a  month. But that having the contraception covered by insurance will raise  the premium by $50 a month. The insurance company does, after all, have  certain costs associated with taking the premium then paying it  straight back out again to buy the pill. Why would anyone do this? Why  not purchase the pill for $30, stiff the insurance company bureaucrats  the $20 and spend it on a couple of cocktails at a place where you might  meet someone who thinks that your being a contraceptive user is a good  idea?</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, when you&#8217;re  just making up numbers, its easy to have them suit whatever fell purpose  you have in mind.  Suppose a much more realistic <a href="http://www.healthinsurancerates.com/56-birth-control-and-health-insurance.html">$16 per month</a>, and the whole make-believe argument  collapses.</p>
<p>Besides,  in terms of brute economics, the insurance company is better off paying  for decades of contraception in $30 increments than one avoidable  pregnancy at many thousands of dollars, if everything goes smoothly.    Let&#8217;s just say you can&#8217;t count on that.  </p>
<p>So far, this has been a basically economic argument.  Now let&#8217;s look at an issue of fairness and parity.  <a href="http://www.healthinsurancerates.com/56-birth-control-and-health-insurance.html">More than half of the prescription programs cover Viagra</a>.   Need I say more?</p>
<p>Worstall&#8217;s  argument has some logical consistency &#8211; he seems opposed to insurance  coverage of other types of preventive care.  But this is ignorant and  short-sighted.  A flu-shot is less than $25.  An office call is $90 and  up.  Prevention, in general,  is cheap, and treatment is expensive.  If  cost minimization is your goal, then the clear focus should be on  prevention.</p>
<p>Worstall&#8217;s problem, I think, is in relating  contraception to a free-market business model, though, as I have  indicated, he isn&#8217;t even understanding that properly.  The proper focus  also includes the high costs of the externalities that he conveniently  ignores.</p>
<p>The real root problem though, is in trying to  force-fit any health insurance system into a for-profit model.  There is  simply no way to reconcile the conflicting goals of profit maximization  and providing the needed services.  In fact, there are only three  avenues to profit maximization: raise premiums, deny coverage, or  emphasize prevention.</p>
<p>Whether this leads to the  conclusion that a single payer, government mandated program is the best  overall approach is left as an exercise for the interested reader.</p>
<p>UPDATE: I forgot the great positive externality of contraception &#8211; it prevents hundreds of thousands of abortions every year.</p>

You can down load it or the better way is to click on the PDF file which brings up the Intro and then click on any of the listings of the table of contents which takes you to that set of PDF data.  For this posting regarding income data I am using <a href="http://www2.census.gov/prod2/statcomp/documents/1937-13.pdf">this section</a>.   </div>
<div></div>
<div>The average weekly income for all manufacturing was $22.82 per week on 39.1 hours work.  The highest paid was printing/publishing newspapers/periodicals at $35.15 per week on 37 hours work.  The lowest was cotton goods at $13.80 per week on 37.5 hours of work.   </div>
<div></div>
<div>In the non-manufacturing sector the I calculated the average weekly income to be $23.76 on 40.28 hours of work.  The highest earnings were electric power/lights manufactured gas at $31.70 per week on 40.2 hours work.  The lowest was hotels at $13.97 per week on 48.3 hours of work.    For the Walmart greeter retail trade-general merchandising it was $17.51 per week on 40.8 hours work.</div>
<div></div>
<div>There were regional differences also.  The most glaring is the north/south difference.  The hourly wage ranges from 12.5 cents to 19 cents less if you worked in the south.  The greatest differences being between the East South Central and the Pacific North.  </div>
<div></div>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<div>The data uses an average of 1923 to 1925 to equal 100% for comparisons.  Thus, 1936 weekly earnings were 89.7 % of that standard however they were 109.9 % adjusted for cost of living.  Things were looking up having hit their lows in 1933.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Using my <a href="http://www.measuringworth.com/calculators/index.php">favorite money converter</a> and to not let the numbers become to many and thus cause one&#8217;s mind to go blank, I converted the average hourly wage for the four categories listed:</div>
<div></div>
<div><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-7FzQWjwM8C8/T1OHwyv0cpI/AAAAAAAAASI/T3BmhKZ1WQM/s1600/1936+Hourly+pay+Converted.JPG" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="197" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-7FzQWjwM8C8/T1OHwyv0cpI/AAAAAAAAASI/T3BmhKZ1WQM/s320/1936+Hourly+pay+Converted.JPG" width="320"></a></div>
<div>  </div>
<div>Thus we have an annual income ranging from a high of $1827.80 per year for the newspaper worker to $717.60 per year for the cotton goods worker.   These are the numbers you need to keep in mind as we look at the 1936 tax tables.  These are the numbers that let us start to understand what we used to  </div>
<div>consider rich.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The lowest tax rate in 1936 is 4% on incomes up to $4000.   This $4000 appears to capture  the income of the vast majority of workers in the nation in 1936.    Remember, this income that is taxed is already adjusted for any deductions.  Thus, if after all your deductions you had $4000 left over, you paid 4% of that in federal income tax.  You paid $160 in taxes.    Today, using the converted average income a person would be paying up to 15% of their adjusted income for federal income taxes.  They would be paying 25% if they were receiving the equivalent share of GDP/capita.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The highest rate in 1936 is 79% on income over $5,000,000.  OH MY GOD!  Don&#8217;t panic folks.  Converted as unskilled labor, this is $188,000,000 of adjusted gross income.  That is a freakn&#8217; pile of money after all deductions are taken.  Still, I&#8217;m sure some are thinking I must be a real soak the rich kind of guy to brush off 79%.  Here&#8217;s the thing.  It&#8217;s a very big thing.  VERY BIG THING.  This person is only paying that 79% on any money above the $5,000,000 after all deductions.   They spent all the money they believed their business (s) needed, they gave all they wanted to charity, they took the housing credits, subtracted any losses on capital gains, gave to their children and any other activity that would subtract money from their gross income.  When it was all done, that person still had $5,000,000 left over to be taxed at 79% and it is only that $1 (ONE DOLLAR) which put their income at $5,000,000 that will be taxed at 79%.  </div>
<div></div>
<div>What we have forgotten, or have failed to honestly accept is that the old way of producing a tax schedule did not tax at a constant rate from the first dollar.  Each time you broke into a new “tax bracket” only that money within that tax bracket was taxed at the brackets given rate.  Thus, the higher up the tax rate ladder one was, the smaller their actual percentage of income paid for taxes became relative to the indexes specified rate.  Frankly what this means is that the only person paying the full bracketed rate is the person at the bottom of the table.  If you were in the 4% bracket, you paid a full 4% of your ADJUSTED gross income to the federal government.   How convenient for those arguing to “simplify” the tax system that a huge portion of the tax paying public pays the full indexed rate and thus when you talk to them about a 79% tax rate they are prone to interpret that rate as being paid on all the money they earned. Ouch!  How to move a populous made simple. </div>
<div></div>
<div>There were 33  brackets in 1936.  When people talked about the “complexity” of the tax system they used to be talking about how many brackets there were.  After all, the goal of the complainers is to get the “system” down to the lowest single rate they can buy.  Interestingly enough, there is a flat rate in the 1936 table.  You just had to be willing to really work hard to earn an income large enough to receive such a rate.  It&#8217;s the top rate.  </div>
<div></div>
<div>The following chart shows how this works.  It is a chart of the percentages of the marginal rate verse the actual rate paid.  Notice how there is a bulge in the middle.  Those people got the biggest built in break from the marginal rate.  I don&#8217;t know how to figure out how many people were within the bracket range of number 7 to 23, but it would be interesting to see if this was what we would consider the middle class.</div>

<div></div>
<div>  </div>
<div>What all this comes down to is a chart that looks as follows:</div>
<div><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-t_FIS6h4jFE/T1OIZ4bE8bI/AAAAAAAAASY/3vWOhS8t9CY/s1600/1936+Tax+Table+Graph.JPG" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="235" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-t_FIS6h4jFE/T1OIZ4bE8bI/AAAAAAAAASY/3vWOhS8t9CY/s320/1936+Tax+Table+Graph.JPG" width="320"></a></div>
<div>Notice that once we get to the 25th bracket the individual is paying more than 50% of their income in taxes.  For shame people will say.  How dare We the People take so much from that person.  It&#8217;s stealing!  NOT!</div>

<div></div>
<div>First, at the 25<sup>th</sup> bracket the adjusted gross income in today&#8217;s unskilled labor value is $9,420,000 per year.  Remember, ADJUSTED GROSS INCOME.  All deductions have been taken.  There is nothing at this income that one could not have had at $7,540,000 (the converted income that taxes less than 50%) that is not just more of what they already have.</div>
<div></div>
<div> </div>
<div>Second, at this level of income no one is doing it solely on their own.  What we used to understand is that there is a point of income earning that stops being do to one&#8217;s labor and moves to being simply the capture of a greater share of the income earned off the commons.  Haven&#8217;t hear that term “commons”.  Ask a person <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_commons">from Massachusetts</a>.  In the case of income, it is the money earned as a results of all the investments We the<br />People have made.  In practice if you own a business and have employees, the road you used to get to your business  is used by all the employees and thus you have received a share of their share of the use of the road.  You have received a greater share of the road&#8217;s effect on economic activity without doing any extra work.  You only had to pay your taxes&#8230;just like all your employees in order to have that road in place for your use.  I believe this is why there was a point in the 1936 tax table at which your tax paid became greater than 50% and climbed steeply until you rang the income bell at which time your were rewarded with a flat rate on everything earned beyond the bell&#8217;s posted height.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Third, at this level of income the Constitution&#8217;s prime objective kicks in: equality of power.  We are living the effects of having been taught away from this effect of money.  I refer you back to my series looking at taxation from a justice perspective.  Starting <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2008/01/opus-1-discussion-on-taxation.html">here</a> going on <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2008/01/opus-1-second-movement-on-taxation.html">here</a> and<a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2008/02/opus-finale-discussion-on-taxation.html"> finishing here</a>.  I&#8217;ll just let what I ended that series with be my overall thoughts on why power and thus justice need to be part of the taxation discussion: </div>
<div> </div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><div>As a professional, I can understand the argument to separate the two issues via 2 professions. The concept of a profession is that it is specialized. As a thinking person and a citizen, the public discussion should not allow the issue of efficiency to dominate one profession&#8217;s focus while the issue of equity dominates another profession. We have to assure both equity and efficiency are discussed and decided upon in order to stay true to the preamble of the Constitution and minimize Thomas Jefferson&#8217;s observation of the citizens response.</div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>There is one major point to learn from the charts above.  If you want a progressive system, you need many tax brackets.  The more steps there are the more fair and specifically addressed is any particular level of income.   To compare the charts of 1936 to 2010, you can view the<a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-lX4293efG5Y/Tl_Efh3ab1I/AAAAAAAAARc/W7X0lIr0Ki0/s1600/2010+Tax+table+Define+Rich+3.JPG"> 2010 table here</a> and <a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-OCqtKMLzE3A/Tl_Ejt_NFtI/AAAAAAAAARg/bwU8IixjaGc/s1600/2010+Tax+rate+graph+Define+Rich+3.JPG">the graph here</a>.</div>

<p><a href="http://econospeak.blogspot.com/2012/02/wealth-and-antisocial-behavior-reverse.html">Wealth and Antisocial Behavior: Reverse Causality?</a></p>
<p>There is quite a bit of buzz about <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2012/02/21/1118373109.abstract">this just-prepublished article</a> in the <i>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</i>. Here is the abstract:<br />
<blockquote>Seven studies using experimental and naturalistic methods reveal that upper-class individuals behave more unethically than lower-class individuals. In studies 1 and 2, upper-class individuals were more likely to break the law while driving, relative to lower-class individuals. In follow-up laboratory studies, upper-class individuals were more likely to exhibit unethical decision-making tendencies (study 3), take valued goods from others (study 4), lie in a negotiation (study 5), cheat to increase their chances of winning a prize (study 6), and endorse unethical behavior at work (study 7) than were lower-class individuals. Mediator and moderator data demonstrated that upper-class individuals’ unethical tendencies are accounted for, in part, by their more favorable attitudes toward greed.</p></blockquote>
<p>The tone of the first wave of commentary, as far as I can tell, is that we knew it all along—rich people are nasty. I would like to put in a word, however, for the other direction of causality, that dishonesty and putting one’s own interests ahead of others are conducive to wealth. I certainly don’t mean this deterministically; there are lots of stone-broke cheats and chiselers out there. Nevertheless, at many key moments of life people face a choice, whether to shade a bit and advance their own career, or remain honest and end up back in the pack. Do you take credit for someone else’s work in order to get a promotion? Do you leave out some information that would reduce the likelihood of a sale that would make you a tidy profit? And if you find yourself in a zero-sum situation where your gain is someone else’s loss (or more gain for you means less gain for them), do you push your advantage as hard as you can?  </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>The reason I bring this up is because there is a constant background murmur in our society that says that greater wealth <i>has</i> to be a reward for more talent, more effort or more contribution to society. When Steve Jobs died, he was a poster child for this view. Yeah, he was something of a jerk, but he gave us all those great gadgets, and that’s why he was so rich. Could it be, however, that among all those whose intelligence, creativity and obsessive toil drives progress, what separates the Steve Jobs from the Unknown Nerd is the bundle of personal traits that add up to claiming for oneself alone the contribution of everyone else? There are a lot of people who could never imagine raking in billions while those who do the physical work in China are driven to, or past, the brink of suicide. They won’t get to be CEO. Nor would the people taking in the super-bonuses at Citi, G-S, BoA and the rest be where they are if they put as much energy into making sure mortgage borrowers were treated legally and fairly as they do into squeezing a little more profit into the kitty.<br />  <br />Maybe the reason a lot of people are vulnerable in this economy is that they’re too damned decent. Between, say, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/13/business/turning-the-dialogue-from-wealth-to-values.html?pagewanted=print">Tyler Cowen</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nice_guy">Leo Durocher</a>, who do you think has a better handle on how the world really works?  </p>

<p>It&#8217;s Almost April so Tax Tips Are Flowering</p>
<p>You can tell when it is getting close to the April filing deadline for individual calendar-year taxpayers. All of the major tax firms release their &#8220;handy tax tips&#8221; to entice new clients for this tax season.<br />The <a href="http://www.aicpa.org/Pages/Default.aspx">American Institute of CPA&#8217;s</a> handy tips (released Mar.1, 2012) include some helpful reminders that taxpayers should claim deductions they are entitled too but shouldn&#8217;t be piggy and claim deductions&#8211;like the home office deduction&#8211;that they aren&#8217;t entitled to.
<ol>
<li>Expenses. &#8220;Keep a daily diary.&#8221; </li>
<li>Deductions. Take advantage of all of the deductions to which you are legally entitled. &#8220;The most common deductions for small business owners include entertainment, travel, meals, capital assets, home office and health insurance. Travel miles, meals and entertainment deductions require that you maintain a diary with daily entries that tie into receipts and other records.&#8221; </li>
<li>Traps. &#8220;[C]laiming deductions that exceed your income for more than one year is a definite red flag. The home office deduction, which is allowable only under specific circumstances, may be another red flag.&#8221; </li>
<li>Retirement. &#8220;income each tax year to qualify for a tax-deductible retirement plan.&#8221; </li>
<p><a name="more"></a>
<li>Equipment. &#8220;For tax years beginning in 2011, a small business may deduct up to $500,000 in equipment purchases as long as the business spends $2 million or less for equipment for the year.&#8221; </li>
<li>Payroll. &#8220;One of the most common and costly tax-related problems for small business owners is that they use the payroll taxes withheld from employees to finance business operations. Not only does the IRS often go after a small business owner’s personal assets to collect the unpaid payroll taxes, but also it may attempt to assess significant penalties.&#8221; In other words, those taxes you&#8217;ve withheld aren&#8217;t your money to spend&#8211;you are collecting on behalf of the government and must turn them over.</li>
<li>Insurance. &#8220;If you have health insurance coverage for your employees, check to see if you are eligible for the small business health care tax credit. The <a href="http://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,id=223666,00.html">IRS website</a> has a page describing the credit, eligibility requirements and how to claim it. &#8221; </li>
<li>Veterans. There&#8217;s a credit for employers who hire veterans. The <a href="http://www.irs.gov/businesses/small/article/0,,id=253949,00.html">IRS website</a> has details. </li>
<li>Contributions. &#8220;Be sure to get a valuation for any non-cash items your business donates to charity&#8221; </li>
<li>Help. &#8220;If you are unsure about anything related to your tax obligations under the law, you should seek professional help &#8220;</li>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p><img title="laffer napkin" src="http://rationalwiki.org/w/images/5/50/Laffer_napkin.jpg" alt="" width="269" height="202"><br />Anti-taxers love to haul out the legendary napkin-inscribed Laffer curve to demonstrate that lower taxes would yield more government revenue. But this ploy only works because they <em>assume</em> that we’re at or past the high point — that higher taxes would move us down the right slope. (Note the cross-marks-the-spot in the image here?)
<p>But where are we really, relative to that high point? James Kwak <a href="http://baselinescenario.com/2012/02/27/how-much-do-taxes-matter/">gives us</a> an answer, based on a great recent <a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w17860">paper</a> by Christina and David Romer (emphasis, interjections, mine):</p>
<blockquote><p>…an [income] elasticity of 0.19 [from the Romer paper] implies that <strong>tax revenues would be maximized with a tax rate of 84 percent</strong>; that is, you could raise taxes up to 84 percent before people’s reduced incentives to make money would compensate for the higher tax rates.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is obviously not to say that we should be taxing at that level — only that Laffer-curve arguments are ridiculous because we’re nowhere near the high point.</p>
<p>Kwak adds another key insight about the paper:</p>
<blockquote><p>Second, remember that <strong>this is a study of the super-rich</strong>: not the top 1%, but the top 0.05%. These are the people whom one would expect to have the highest income elasticity, precisely because they don’t need the marginal dollar. <strong>Elasticities tend to be lower for ordinary people</strong> because they need to cover their expenses.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So we’re even father from the peak than suggested by the .19 elasticity.</p>
<p>Takeaway:</p>
<blockquote><p>…<strong>when you raise taxes on the rich, they don’t stop trying to make money</strong>: they just pay their lawyers and accountants more to avoid paying taxes.</p>
