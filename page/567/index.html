<blockquote><p>Four years later, however, Senator Obama enters the picture with, apparently, a different point of view. He has not been coy about wanting to use the tax code to redistribute income more aggressively. He has proposed modest tax cuts (about $1,000) for numerous middle-class Americans, cuts to be financed by much higher taxes on the richest few percent of the population. When all of Senator Obama’s proposed tax increases on the rich are added up, the top marginal rate on wage income would be nearly 50 percent.  But for dividend income, Senator Obama has proposed only a modest increase in the top tax rate, to 20 percent from 15 percent. That is, the personal income tax would continue to tax dividends at a far lower rate than ordinary income. This decision must surprise many of his Congressional supporters. But it should be making President Bush smile. In light of Senator Obama’s stand, the politics of dividend taxation may take some surprising twists. Senator John McCain wants to maintain the current tax rate of 15 percent on dividends (while cutting the corporate tax), but it is a good bet that if Senator McCain is elected president, while Congress remains Democratic, Congress won’t give the Republican president what he wants. They would instead let the Bush tax cuts expire, returning the dividend tax for high-income taxpayers to about 40 percent.  By contrast, if Mr. Obama is elected, Congressional Democrats will be less likely to balk at his proposed 20 percent dividend tax rate and thus embarrass the new president from their own party. This leads to one of the great ironies of the political season. On the issue of dividend taxation, Barack Obama may be the candidate with the best chance of preserving George Bush’s legacy.</p></blockquote>
<p>Earlier in this op-ed, he made the case why dividend taxation had distortive incentive effects and then stated this about the 2003 debate to reduce the dividend tax rate to 15 percent:</p>
<blockquote><p>Many Democrats pointed out, correctly, that the most immediate beneficiaries were rich. The poor don’t own much dividend-paying stock. Middle-class families hold more equities, but they often do so in retirement accounts, which are already tax-preferred. Wonkish arguments that a better allocation of resources would improve the overall economy were dismissed as “trickle-down economics.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The improvement in incentives might have had a small benefit to the overall economy but the fairness issue is still a critical one.  But maybe President Obama can achieve improvements in tax progressivity at lowers costs to efficiency.</p>

                                <p>At the cost of tens of billions to the American taxpayer, the U.S. government will bailout Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, both private companies created by Congress. Back in <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/06/business/06fannie.html?_r=3&#038;hp&#038;oref=slogin&#038;oref=slogin&#038;oref=slogin">March</a>,<br />
<blockquote>
<p>Because of the widespread perception that the government would intervene if either company failed, they can borrow money at lower interest rates than their competitors. As a result, they have earned enormous profits that have enriched shareholders and managers alike: from 1990 to 2000, each company’s stock grew more than 500 percent and top executives were paid tens of millions of dollars.<br />&#8230;In a March meeting, Freddie Mac’s chairman, Richard F. Syron, bolstered those fears by saying the company would put shareholders’ interests first. </p>
<p>What is the nature of the bailout, whose investment is protected and whose investment is not?</p>
<p>Update:  <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/">Market Watch</a> </p>
<p>Consider the description of the bailout from the: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/07/business/07fannie.html?_r=1&#038;hp&#038;oref=slogin">New York Times</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p>Investors who own the companies’ common and preferred stock will suffer. <em>Holders of debt, including many foreign central banks, are expected to receive government backing.</em> Top executives of both companies will be pushed out, according to those briefed on the plan. [italics mine]</p></blockquote>
<p>Now consider the following from <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/chinese-government-top-foreign-holder/story.aspx?guid=%7B347DF7BF-F0B7-48C9-A418-5A0B903D9F72%7D&#038;dist=hppr">MarketWatch</a>,<br />
<blockquote>The top five foreign holders of Freddie and Fannie long-term debt are China, Japan, the Cayman Islands, Luxembourg, and Belgium. In total foreign investors hold over $1.3 trillion in these agency bonds, according to the U.S. Treasury&#8217;s most recent &#8220;Report on Foreign Portfolio Holdings of U.S. Securities.&#8221; </p></blockquote>
<p>China alone holds $376 billion in bond holdings. </p>
<p>Unless I am misreading something, foreign central banks will be protected, including China&#8217;s&#8230;and the America taxpayer will foot that bill. </p>
<p><a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122072588739407007.html?mod=googlenews_wsj">Secretary Paulson</a> has been busy of late reassuring foreign central banks that they will be protected. </p>
<blockquote><p>In recent weeks, Treasury officials have been reaching out to foreign central banks and other overseas buyers of securities or debt sold by the two companies, to reassure them of the creditworthiness of these instruments.</p>
<p>In one such conversation, at the end of August, the Treasury sought to reassure the Bank of Mexico, according to a person familiar with the matter, of the soundness of agency securities held by the bank. Treasury officials have also had similar conversations with Japanese investors who are buyers and holders of agency debt.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The collapse of Fannie and Freddie is being heard around the world. Although both presidential candidates may not be giving it the real attention it deserves, both have heard the collapse.</p>
<blockquote><p>Sen. John McCain, the Republican nominee for president, has said his goal is to make the companies &#8220;go away&#8221; and to push for regulation that &#8220;limits their ability to borrow, shrinks their size until they are no longer a threat to our economy and privatizes and eliminates their links to the government.&#8221; Sen. McCain supported giving Treasury the authority to backstop the firms but has said any use of taxpayer funds should be combined with an ouster of management and a ban on lobbying by the companies.</p>
<p>Sen. Barack Obama, the Democratic nominee, has said the companies are a &#8220;weird blend&#8221; and that &#8220;if these are public entities, then they&#8217;ve got to get out of the profit-making business, and if they&#8217;re private entities, then we don&#8217;t bail them out.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The meaning and ramifications of this collapse cannot be unravelled in a single post&#8211;or a hundred posts. Mismanagement, corporate greed and excess need examining. </p>
<p>Once again, the U.S. taxpayer will be asked to shoulder another mountain of debt. Once again, the taxpayer has become the prop of last resort as poorly managed entities become too big to fail. How long this can continue is the question. </p>
<p>Everything seems broken. No one seems to be safely in charge. Instead, I imagine public officials&#8211;Bernanke and Paulson&#8211; racing frantically from meeting to meeting, making assurances, looking for the next band-aid. </p>
<p>John McCain wants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to shrink so that their size no longer is a threat. Would he say the same thing about Bear Stearns, albeit it is far smaller? Should Bear Stearns not have been allowed to grow so large? How do we shrink such a massive entities? Remember, they hold over $5 trillion in mortgages. Do we hold a fire sale? And would he apply the lobbying rule to other large companies? After all, they now have a heavy hand in writing the regulations that govern them. (The Medicare Part D fiasco is evidence of just how influential the pharmaceuticals were in deciding just what regulations were best for them.) Is it big government that is the problem&#8211;or big corporations that run the government? </p>
<p>Obama wants Fannie and Freddie out of the profit-making business. Is America ready for nationalizing such institutions? Is Obama? And could we have afforded a total collapse of Bear Stearns? Can the government simply allow such things to happen if the consequence for the nation is dire? </p>
<p>And how does the next president reassure our foreign creditors that the U.S. will pay its bills? </p>
<p>While we may be dismayed that foreign central banks will receive &#8220;government backing,&#8221; we do not have much choice.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601080&#038;sid=aslo2E01QVFI&#038;refer=asia">Yu Yongding</a>, former advisor to China&#8217;s central bank, put the matter bluntly:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;If the U.S. government allows Fannie and Freddie to fail and international investors are not compensated adequately, the consequences will be catastrophic,&#8221; Yu said in e-mailed answers to questions yesterday. &#8220;If it is not the end of the world, it is the end of the current international financial system.&#8221; </p></blockquote>
<p>Foreign central banks have been<a href="http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20050701faresponse84415/brad-setser/how-scary-is-the-deficit.html"> propping </a>up the U.S. economy:<br />
<blockquote>Foreign central banks have financed the United States to keep their export sectors &#8212; heavily dependent on U.S. consumer spending &#8212; humming. But they now must weigh the benefits of providing the United States with such &#8220;vendor financing&#8221; against the rising costs of keeping the current system going.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yu Yongding is not making a threat; he is stating a fact. </p>
<p>If foreign central banks stop financing U.S. debt (there are no free rides), then the U.S. is in a world of hurt. As <a href="http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20050701faresponse84415/brad-setser/how-scary-is-the-deficit.html">Brad Setser</a> notes: </p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;in fact, the economic and financial risks that arise from the U.S. current account deficit (and the resulting dependence on foreign financing) have not been exaggerated. If anything, they have received too little attention &#8212; and are set to grow in the coming years.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, &#8220;the coming years&#8221; may be sooner, not later. For the U.S., the consequences may be immediate inflation as Treasury attempts to makes its offerings more palatable. The dollar will plunge. And these are just for starters. </p>
<p>The party is over. Sorry that most of you working stiffs missed it. Oh, by the way, here&#8217;s the bill. </p>
<p>As <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/14/opinion/14krugman.html?_r=2&#038;hp&#038;oref=slogin&#038;oref=slogin">Paul Krugman </a>said: </p>
<blockquote><p>I used to think that the major issues facing the next president would be how to get out of Iraq and what to do about health care. At this point, however, I suspect that the biggest problem for the next administration will be figuring out which parts of the financial system to bail out, how to pay the cleanup bills and how to explain what it’s doing to an angry public. </p></blockquote>
<p>Although the American public is not exactly happy with the economy, it has no idea of the depth of the problems. Most people think the government&#8217;s check writing ability is infinite. </p>
<p>Well, the government is broke and broken. </p>
<p>As far as I can see, neither candidate is willing to tell us frankly just how dire our difficulties are&#8211;and to whom we owe money. We have off-shored much of our manufacturing sector in the name of efficiency and profits, ignored our energy needs, and allowed our financial institutions to rape and pillage the countryside. Some have grumbled and tightened their belts; others have smiled and fattened their wallets; yet others have just watched and written studies on entrepreneurial innovation.</p>
<p>Regardless of who wins the upcoming election, the next president will faced enormous problems and a lot of anger&#8230;and not much in the way of solutions. </p>
<p>Right now, there are no easy answers.</p>

                                <p>Via Drs. <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/09/bush-administra.html">DeLong</a> and <a href="http://www.eschatonblog.com/2008_08_31_archive.html#6248052711832110997">Black</a>, the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/05/AR2008090503351_pf.html">WaPo reports</a> that this version of the S&#038;L crisis will repeat the mistakes of the last one:<br />
<blockquote>Instead of giving each company a big capital infusion upfront, the government could make quarterly injections as the companies&#8217; losses warrant, the sources said. This would be an attempt to minimize the initial cost of the rescue. [emphasis mine]</p></blockquote>
<p>And why are they doing this?  Who gets protected while the hemorrhaging continues?<br />
<blockquote>The value of the companies&#8217; common stock would be diluted but not wiped out, while the holdings of other securities, including company debt and preferred shares might be protected by the government.</p></blockquote>
<p>So who are the <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q/mh?s=FNM">major individual holders of the stock</a>?  Why, the directors of the company, the five of whom listed hold over 2.1 million shares.</p>
<p>That is, the same people who were tasked with ensuring that the company was well run—and have failed miserably at it—are being saved by the form of the bailout, while the cost—again, judging by the lessons of the slow-motion S&#038;L meltdown—will be increasing for the taxpayers.</p>
<p>The next time someone asks me if I believe in &#8220;free-market capitalism,&#8221; I&#8217;m going to ask if they believe in the Easter Bunny.</p>

                                <p>I have seen lots of liberals making the case that she is not.  Some of these arguments get really tedious and confusing but perhaps the most succinct one comes from a fellow resident of Wasilla named <a href="http://mudflats.wordpress.com/2008/09/04/a-letter-about-sarah-palin-from-anne-kilkenny">Anne Kilkenny</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Sarah campaigned in Wasilla as a “fiscal conservative”. During her 6 years as Mayor, she increased general government expenditures by over 33%. During those same 6 years the amount of taxes collected by the City increased by 38%. This was during a period of low inflation (1996-2002). She reduced progressive property taxes and increased a regressive sales tax which taxed even food. The tax cuts that she promoted  benefited large corporate property owners way more than they benefited residents.</p>
<p>The huge increases in tax revenues during her mayoral administration weren’t enough to fund everything on her wish list though, borrowed money was needed, too. She inherited a city with zero debt, but left it with indebtedness of over $22 million. What did Mayor Palin encourage the voters to borrow money for? Was it the infrastructure that she said she supported? The sewage treatment plant that the city lacked? or a new library? No. $1m for a park. $15m-plus for construction of a multi-use sports complex which she rushed through to build on a piece of property that the City didn’t even have clear title to, that was still in litigation 7 yrs later–to the delight of the lawyers involved! The sports complex itself is a nice addition to the community but a huge money pit, not the profit-generator she claimed it would be. She also supported bonds for $5.5m for road projects that could have been done in 5-7 yrs without any borrowing. While Mayor, City Hall was extensively remodeled and her office redecorated more than once.  These are small numbers, but Wasilla is a very small city.</p>
<p>As an oil producer, the high price of oil has created a budget surplus in Alaska. Rather than invest this surplus in technology that will make us energy independent and increase efficiency, as Governor she proposed distribution of this surplus to every individual in the state.  In this time of record state revenues and budget surpluses, she recommended that the state borrow/bond for road projects, even while she proposed distribution of surplus state revenues: spend today’s surplus, borrow for needs.</p></blockquote>
<p>Spend and borrow – the fiscal conservatism of Ronald Reagan, George W. Bush, and now McCain and Palin.</p>
<p>Update: <a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/2008/09/obama_rebukes_palin_on_earmark.php">Barack Obama</a> blasts Palin on her earmark record:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be fooled,&#8221; Obama told the crowd surrounding him in a large barn. &#8220;John McCain&#8217;s party, with the help of John McCain, has been in charge&#8221; for nearly eight years.  &#8220;I know the governor of Alaska has been saying she&#8217;s change, and that&#8217;s great,&#8221; Obama said. &#8220;She&#8217;s a skillful politician. But, you know, when you&#8217;ve been taking all these earmarks when it&#8217;s convenient, and then suddenly you&#8217;re the champion anti-earmark person, that&#8217;s not change. Come on! I mean, words mean something, you can&#8217;t just make stuff up.&#8221;  McCain has vowed to wipe out earmarks, which are targeted funding for specific projects that lawmakers put into spending bills. As governor, Palin originally supported earmarks for a controversial $398 million Alaska project dubbed the &#8220;bridge to nowhere.&#8221; But she dropped her support after the state&#8217;s likely share of the cost rose. She hung onto $27 million to build the approach road to the bridge.  Under Palin&#8217;s leadership, Alaska this year asked for almost $300 per person in requests for pet projects from one of McCain&#8217;s top adversaries: indicted Sen. Ted Stevens. That&#8217;s more than any other state received, per person, from Congress for the current budget year. Other states got just $34 worth of local projects per person this year, on average, according to Citizens Against Government Waste, a Washington-based watchdog group.The state government&#8217;s earmark requests to Congress in her first year in office exceeded $550 million, more than $800 per resident.</p></blockquote>
<p>I guess to supporters of McCain-Palin, reality has a liberal bias and facts are sexist.</p>

<p>Dan, may I suggest an open thread that allow us to list the various policy issues and then discuss them.</p>
<p>I would start with:<br />1) Economic<br />2) Energy<br />3) Jobs [and I consider 1,2 &#038; 3 to be closely interlinked]<br />4) Fiscal<br />&#8212; Balanced Budget<br />&#8212; Taxes<br />5) National Security</p>
<p>It is hard to divorce any one policy or subpart from its economic impacts. Maybe that&#8217;s why we are all on this open discussion Econ blog.</p>
<p>Rdan replies:</p>
<p>Yes, I will try it as a way for right and left to stay on issues.  We have plenty of representation.  Is it possible when even people like Mary McArdle, others are assigning interns and other people are assigning TAs to monitor comments.  This is a ferocious assault for control by people self-absorbed or suspended values of honesty.</p>
<p>It is the kind of thing to test one&#8217;s beliefs in the honesty people can be capable of, and the kind of restraint that threatens even the staunchest self-control.</p>
<p>Possible?? I do not know.  Some of us are pretty touchy and loaded like tight springs.  For you, intrepid rightside of center, I will respect your request and try this as an experiment.  Someone will certainly bust in to disrupt the flow and others can claim injury&#8230;if so it will not work.</p>
<p>If people stay on topic I or others can delete obvious offenders and no one will miss the deletions if no one responds.  Any other ideas from readers? </p>
<p>Start with jobs, trade??  I realize this can be simply &#8220;asking for it&#8221;.</p>

It was the cover-up of Watergate that drove Richard Nixon from the White House.  John McCain has yet to be voted into the White House and this is just another reason why he never should be.</p>

<p>Auto sales are nearly 20% below trend as compared to 30% below trend at the 1981 bottom and  16% below trend at the 1991 bottom.</p>
<p>So, just maybe July was the bottom.</p>

                                <p>When George W. Bush brags about: (1) increasing Federal funding of drugs and increasing defense spending; (2) giving us or money back in the form of a tax “cut” (actually deferral); and (3) reducing the deficit all at the same time, my reply is that he must be practicing some advanced level of fuzzy math.  McCain’s 2008 campaign is also based on this fuzzy math but <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/05/AR2008090503722.html?nav=rss_politics">Anne Kornblut</a> notes that McCain’s fuzzy math extends to Palin’s sale of her jet:</p>
<blockquote><p>One of the most compelling anecdotes in Sarah Palin’s repertoire is that she auctioned off the Alaska governor&#8217;s jet on eBay after taking office &#8212; a swift move made by a reformer hoping to clean up the excesses of her predecessor. In fact, the jet did not sell on eBay. It was sold to a businessman from Valdez named Larry Reynolds, who paid $2.1 million for the plane &#8212; shy of the $2.7 million purchase price &#8212; according to news reports at the time. Reynolds contributed to Palin&#8217;s campaign in 2006. What happened? It appears that, as she promised during her bid for governor, Palin did try to sell the plane on eBay, but there was only one serious bid, in December of 2006, and it fell through. The Westwind II was sold about eight months later, achieving her goal of ridding the state of a luxury item. But that hasn&#8217;t stopped Palin, or John McCain, from implying &#8212; or asserting outright &#8212; that Palin sold the jet on the Internet. &#8220;You know what I enjoyed the most? She took the luxury jet that was acquired by her predecessor, and sold it on eBay &#8212; and made a profit!&#8221; McCain declared in Wisconsin at a campaign stop Friday.</p></blockquote>
<p>Kornblut suggests Palin had a loss equal to $0.6 million so how does McCain think she made a profit?  Oh wait a second – Reynolds also contributed money to Palin’s campaign.  Is McCain saying there was some side deal between the Governor of Alaska and this Valdez businessman?  I think Team McCain has some explaining to do here.</p>
<p>Hat tip to <a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/214198.php">Will Thomas</a> who also notes that whether this was sold on eBay is “nitpicking” but McCain should be more careful with what he says.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p><a href="http://www.econbrowser.com/archives/2008/09/rising_unemploy.html">James Hamilton</a> has a nice post noting why he would say we are in a recession and linking to a lot of very smart economists who are saying the same thing.  All of these economists pay tribute to the tough task faced by the NBER Business-Cycle Dating Committee which has not officially declared that we are in a recession – at least not yet.  But I suspect Teams McCain and Obama will both start talking about fiscal policy cures for the rise in the unemployment rate – or the drop in the employment-population ratio if you prefer.  </p>
<p>I haven’t seen anything recent from Lawrence Summers on this but let me speculate what he might say – as I think he often gets these things quite right.  Summers strikes me as a long-term deficit hawk for the same pro-growth reasons that I am.  Something to do with increasing national savings – which of course the Reagan-Bush43-McCain wing of the Republican Party seems to think has it all backwards.  We deficit hawks tend to favor countercyclical monetary policy that lowers interest rates to encourage investment (and yes net exports via dollar devaluation) when aggregate demand is weak.  But the Federal Reserve has played that lever and some of us are concerned that it alone will not be enough.  </p>
<p>So as the politicians want to pander to the public with promises of both more spending and tax cuts too, let’s try to figure out which set of fiscal policies can do the best job of giving timely, targeted, and effective short-term fiscal stimulus and at the same time tell Wall Street that we are serious about long-term fiscal responsibility.  This policy prescription used to be called Rubinomics and I submit that it worked well for the Clinton Administration.  But then Summers was one of his excellent economic advisors – to which President Clinton did listen to carefully.  </p>
<p>McCain wants tax cuts – lots of them.  Some of them are temporary tax cuts (gasoline tax rebates) which a lot of economists would argue have little bang for the back.  But McCain is also advocating making George W. Bush’s tax cuts permanent.  Whoops – that’s the complete opposite of what Rubinomics would call for.  It would reduce national savings and long-term economic growth and could even hurt forward looking investors types such as those folks on Wall Street.  The McCain recipe is a lot like the Reagan and Bush43 recipes and the evidence is that these recipes work poorly.</p>
<p>Obama is calling for an acceleration of public investment projects, which could give a large bang for the buck and perhaps more timely bang for the buck.  But I’m not ready to say President Obama would be a repeat of what President Clinton did back in 1993.  Candidate Obama wants to tell all but the very rich they get a tax cut.  Then again candidate Clinton made that promise back in 1992.  But at least candidate Obama is proposing less fiscal irresponsibility than candidate McCain and is willing to say some folks will have to pay more in taxes.  Candidate Obama is also surrounding himself with economic advisors who are actual economists.  McCain’s idea for economic advisors include Carly Fiorina and Phil Gramm.</p>
