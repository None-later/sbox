Let X be the probability that in five years he will make $100,000 a year, adjusted for inflation.  (i.e., X is the probability the person will increase his income by 5 times)</p>
<p>Take a 40 year old male who makes in the neighborhood of $100,000 a year, and, adjusted for inflation, has made more or less the same amount for the past few years.

<p>Take a 40 year old male who makes in the neighborhood of $1,000,000 a year, and, adjusted for inflation, has made more or less the same amount for the past few years.  Let Z be the probability that he will make $20,000,000 a year, adjusted for inflation.  (i.e., Z is the probability the person will increase his income by 20 times)</p>
<p>My guess&#8230; X <br />Is this guess accurate?  And if so, does it say anything about how progressive the income tax should be?</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p>Follow-up.</p>
<p>Now take three two year old boys, each of whose parents died in an accident, and each of whom is brought up by a foster family.  The first inherits a sum of $20,000 payable on his 25th birthday.  The second inherits a sum of $100,000 on his 25th birthday.  The third inherits $1,000,000 on his 25th birthday.</p>
<p>Which of these individuals is most likely to be making $20,000 a year fifteen years later?  Which is most likely to be making $100,000 a year?  And which is most likely to be making $1,000,000 a year fifteen years later?</p>

<blockquote><p>Norman Podhoretz believes that America needs to go to war soon with Iran. As far as he knows, Rudy Giuliani thinks the same thing. “I was asked to come in and give him a briefing on the war, World War IV,” said Mr. Podhoretz, a founding father of neoconservatism and leading foreign policy adviser to Mr. Giuliani. “As far as I can tell there is very little difference in how he sees the war and how I see it.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Greg has more on this neocon insanity.  But I must be missing something.  Last time I checked, we had World War I and World War II.  So what happened to World War III?  Or maybe Rudy knows that Dick Cheney still has another 15 months in office and there’s something else in the works.  How did we elect and then re-elect these idiots?</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.earthtalk.org/">Earth Talk</a> suggests a boring alternative to running headlong into &#8220;green&#8221; sales.</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear EarthTalk: Short of buying a new hybrid or other “green” car, are there ways I can make my existing vehicle more eco-friendly? I bought my car recently and am not quite ready to give it up. </p>
<p>Choice of vehicle may well be the biggest factor in determining the environmental impact of your automobile-based travels. But a considerable amount of energy is used—and pollutants emitted—in the production of any new vehicle, including hybrids and other more fuel-efficient options. As a result, many environmentalists believe that practicing good driving habits and performing adequate maintenance on an older car are probably better options for the environment than causing the production of a new vehicle. </p>
<p>According to the website GreenerCars.org, there are many ways to green up one’s driving habits. Obeying speed limits, utilizing cruise control and avoiding jackrabbit starts will maximize fuel economy and minimize tailpipe emissions while also preventing unnecessary wear-and-tear. Staying off roads during rush hours is also advisable, as stop-and-go driving burns excess gasoline and promotes smog. Opening vents and windows to cool off instead of using the air conditioner, an inherently inefficient appliance that consumes more fuel and leads to more emissions, is also good advice. </p>
<p>Drivers can also help minimize their environmental impact by keeping their cars well maintained. According to GreenerCars.org, getting regular tune-ups—where a qualified mechanic changes fluids and checks for and corrects problems such as worn spark plugs, under inflated tires, dragging brakes, misaligned wheels and clogged filters—can significantly improve fuel economy and minimize harmful emissions. GreenerCars.org also recommends seeking out low-rolling-resistance (LRR) replacement tires, which are specifically designed to improve a vehicle’s fuel economy, when the original ones wear out.</p></blockquote>
<p>How would an entrepreneur sell this idea and make it sexier?  And how would one make money from it?</p>

                                <p>This concept of Comparative Advantage hits a big wall if we accept the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/10/human-capital-is-where-its-at.html">World Bank&#8217;s study </a>on what generates wealth.</p>
<p>If comparative advantage is about what comes natural to a given nation, it has to include what the study referred to as natural capital. This is only 40% of the wealth generation for a poor nation but drops to 20% for a rich nation and is 5% overall world wide. Produced capital accounts for only 18% world wide.</p>
<p>77% of wealth creation is from “intangible capital”. Intangible capital is the results of societies efforts to improve it&#8217;s self as a society (making us better people). It is legal, it is education. It is civil rights, it is (or was here) free education to including college, it is management of our environment, it is (or was) the enlightenment, it is adaptation of knowledge for the betterment of living life. None of these things are the results of nature. They are the results of will and money. The money being spread for the benefit of all.</p>
<p>So, we look at China or India and see that they have taken steps to improve their society via education and legal. The comparative advantage however is still more in the natural capital. What is their “natural” capital? It is low relative wages as compared to the rich nations. Is there any naturally comparative advantage? I think not. It&#8217;s not like they are selling us natural resources. What they are selling are the results of moving the know how and productivity generating tools (using a hammer drill to drill a hole in concrete vs a star drill and hammer) to their countries. Their natural capital is in their labor.</p>
<p>This creates a dilemma for the free traders who think it is only a matter of stuff and things in exchange for currency. If 40% of poor nations wealth generation is natural capital, and produced capital is 18% of the wealth generation, then that leaves 42% of China&#8217;s wealth generation intangible. This is competing against us with numbers that most likely look closer to the world overall, 5% natural, 18% produced, 77% intangible. Being that our advantage is our society, and our society was created by creating a better distribution of wealth, then how are NAFTA, CAFTA etc. without emphasis on labor, rights, and environment promoting our comparative advantage?</p>
<p>This dilemma of promoting trade agreements on only the 2 tangible sectors of the 3 sectors that drive wealth creation ignoring that a rich country as moved vastly beyond the ratio of the 3 sectors to where investment in ones society is the dominating sector by far, is what is wrong with applying models that discuss comparative advantage as some kind of sliding scale based on only the tangibles. Wine vs wool was it?</p>
<p>We&#8217;re loosing the trade wars as a nation because we&#8217;re writing trading agreements to our partners advantage. That&#8217;s what comes of letting people who only think about business, do the trade agreements. They only think in terms of the natural capital and created capital. It is why the models are wrong when they say there will be or has to be “losers”. Bull crappy on that.</p>

Kevin focused on one aspect where the mayor overstepped his authority and just stiffed audits of how City Hall spent money.  Kevin summarizes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Choosing the best presidential candidate among the 2008 contenders is a tough job. Picking the worst is easy. Rudy Giuliani is the guy you&#8217;d get if you put George Bush and Dick Cheney into a wine press and squeezed out their pure combined essence: unbounded arrogance and self-righteousness, a chip on his shoulder the size of a redwood, a studied contempt for anybody&#8217;s opinion but his own, a vindictive streak a mile wide, and a devotion to secrecy and executive power unmatched in presidential history. He is a disaster waiting to happen.</p></blockquote>
<p>But this is an economist blog – right?  Well, this excerpt is about fiscal policy.  Isn’t Rudy also a member of the Cheney free lunch wing of the supply-side silly school?  If you think the Bush-Cheney fiscal policy is great – Rudy is your candidate.</p>

                                <p>Reader Howard Covitz sends a link to <a href="http://www.oculture.com/2007/10/our_ancestral_mind_in_the_modern_world_an_interview_with_satoshi_kanazawa.html">an interview with Satoshi Kanazawa</a>.  I&#8217;m not sure I agree with everything he says in the interview, but this is fascinating.  And in my opinion, worth pondering.</p>
<blockquote><p>DC: Evolutionary psychology portrays us as having impulses that took form long ago, in a very pre-modern context (say, 10,000 years ago), and now these impulses are sometimes rather ill-adapted to our contemporary world. For example, in a food-scarce environment, we became programmed to eat whenever we can; now, with food abounding in many parts of the world, this impulse creates the conditions for an obesity epidemic. Given that our world will likely continue changing at a rapid pace, are we doomed to have our impulses constantly playing catch up with our environment, and does that potentially doom us as a species?</p>
<p>SK: In fact, we’re not playing catch up; we’re stuck. For any evolutionary change to take place, the environment has to remain more or less constant for many generations, so that evolution can select the traits that are adaptive and eliminate those that are not. When the environment undergoes rapid change within the space of a generation or two, as it has been for the last couple of millennia, if not more, then evolution can’t happen because nature can’t determine which traits to select and which to eliminate. So they remain at a standstill. Our brain (and the rest of our body) are essentially frozen in time — stuck in the Stone Age.</p></blockquote>
<p>A few random thoughts:<br />1.  Perhaps evolution selects for ability to adapt, or even luck?<br />2.  Perhaps not everything is changing in unpredictable ways.  For example, the need for the ability to use tools, in battle and otherwise, has been a constant for several millenia now.  (The cost of this improvement, in terms of food that has to be consumed, may be high though.)  Similarly, I can&#8217;t think of a single environment in which humans have been in for which being able to see or resist disease better has not been an advantage.  (I presume that the &#8220;cost&#8221; to the body of such adaptations (i.e., the amount of food consumed to maintain such improvements) is minimal.)</p>
<p>Your thoughts.</p>

                                <p>This post looks at active duty military personnel.  Nothing in this post is a surprise to me, but for those who you have had a problem with some of the posts in this series, I warn you, if you keep reading this one, you’re gonna plotz.  If you’re averse to plotzing, you’re best skipping the rest of this post.</p>
<p>Next… data includes ational Guard, Reserve, and retired regular personnel who happen to be on active duty, which often happens in wartime conditions.  Data from 1960 to 2005 comes from the <a href="http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/tables/07s0500.xls">Statistical Abstract of the United States</a>.   I also have data going back ten more years which I pulled from a DoD site which appears to be no longer active.  (However, the years for which the two series overlap match up perfectly.)</p>
<p>Here’s a line graph of the series.</p>

<p>There are peaks and valleys corresponding to America’s various wars, and the subsequent end of those wars.  Here’s the same information, color coded by President:</p>

<p>The biggest annualized increase in the military came during the JFK/LBJ years, when the country geared up to fight Vietnam.  The next biggest came when Reagan outpostured the USSR, followed by GW’s rather small increases (look very closely!) to fight in Iraq.  However, the extensive use of contractors for jobs previously reserved for the military probably means GW’s figures are somewhat understated.  The smallest drop in military personnel came under Carter, then Clinton.  Yup, Clinton, the guy usually criticized for decimating the US military, is only in the middle of the bunch.  Much bigger drops came under GHW, and that notorious military-hating pansy, Ike.  The biggest reduction in the size of the active duty military came under Nixon/Ford, at the end of the Vietnam War.   </p>
<p>What do we learn from this?  Well, JFK/LBJ geared up to fight a war.  GW hasn&#8217;t.  Reagan also did, but he didn&#8217;t have a war to fight.  And the President who best understood the military&#8230;  he realized that without a war to fight, it didn&#8217;t make sense to maintain the, well, &#8220;military industrial complex.&#8221;</p>

                                <p>One AB reader should take a bow.  <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2007/10/ah-stanfords-da.html">Brad DeLong</a> notes something I first learned from an AB reader:</p>
<blockquote><p>Francis Walker did not say that belief in laissez-faire determined &#8220;whether a man were an economist at all.&#8221; What Francis Walker said in &#8220;The Recent Progress of Political Economy in the United States&#8221; was: (a) the better part of economists had never imposed such a test, (b) the worse part of economists in the United States who posed as &#8220;guardians of the true [laissez-faire] faith&#8221; had lost their influence, and (c) the subject was much the better for it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Brad also gave me the honor of including me in that <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2007/10/a-gathering-of-.html">Gathering of the Clans</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Economic historians, historians of economic thought, practitioners of political economy, and others are painting themselves blue with woad and practicing with staves after reading Stanford&#8217;s David Kennedy&#8217;s trashing of Paul Krugman.</p></blockquote>
<p>Alas, I forgot who our reader was so let me recheck <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/10/does-david-kennedy-consider-donald.html">my humble contribution</a>.  I see it was AB reader Rob who was checking out the comments at the contribution from <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2007/10/review-of-the-c.html">Mark Thoma</a>.  Caption Video asked the right question – and reader Dan provided the answer.   Rob, Captain Video, and Dan should all take a bow.  Well done guys!</p>

<blockquote><p>NEW YORK &#038; BEIJING&#8211;(BUSINESS WIRE)&#8212;-The Bear Stearns Companies Inc. (NYSE:BSC) and CITIC Securities Co., Limited (SSE:600030), with unanimous approval from their respective Boards of Directors, today announced an agreement in principle to establish a comprehensive strategic alliance. This alliance will include sharing management expertise and technology to develop new capital markets products and businesses in China, establishing an exclusive joint venture combining the existing businesses of both companies in the rest of Asia, and cross-investments of approximately $1 billion in each firm by the other. The alliance will bring together Bear Stearns&#8217; capital markets expertise globally and market leading analytics with CITIC Securities&#8217; vast resources and extensive business network to better serve clients worldwide.<br />&#8230;<br />The joint venture will provide a wide range of capital markets services, including cross-border mergers and acquisitions advisory, international equity and fixed income capital markets with a particular focus on international offerings of Chinese companies, venture capital and private equity, asset management, and equity and fixed income services. The joint venture will serve as a conduit for international companies seeking access to Asian capital markets and for Chinese entrepreneurs, corporations and state-owned enterprises looking to access capital or invest outside of the region.</p></blockquote>
<p>As you know I have picked on the stock price of Bear Stearns as a barometer of who gets punished in the derivative markets, fair or not.</p>
<p>Is this venture a successful rebound of the market, or something else?  Not knowing the specifics makes an answer purely conjectural, but I do wonder if Bear Strearns learned anything from the loss of two of its funds, or whether this merely lets them go global and sovereign?</p>

<blockquote><p>The <a title="More articles about the World Trade Organization." href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/w/world_trade_organization/index.html?inline=nyt-org">World Trade Organization</a> made a last-ditch effort on Tuesday to salvage stalled global trade talks by asking the United States and Europe to lower their barriers to farm imports in return for greater export access to <a title="More news and information about India." href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/india/index.html?inline=nyt-geo">India</a>, <a title="More news and information about Brazil." href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/brazil/index.html?inline=nyt-geo">Brazil</a> and other developing countries.</p>
<p>Pascal Lamy, director general of the World Trade Organization, said the group was trying to goad negotiators into making some compromises. <a name="secondParagraph"></a><br />A long proposal laying out possible compromises by 150 countries involved in the talks was issued at the World Trade Organization’s headquarters in Geneva. Officials said the draft was aimed at breaking a deadlock on issues that have eluded compromise since last summer.<br />Pascal Lamy, director general of the trade group, said the goal was to goad negotiators by laying out ambitious compromises they had been unwilling to make, in part because they did not see compromises by others. He said it would not be clear until September whether the new proposals would accomplish that goal.<br />The proposal was careful not to assign blame, but it also said time was running out on the possibility of a global trade deal. It was generally acknowledged to be a final attempt to save the talks, with the expectation that they would be declared a failure if it did not succeed.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/13/business/worldbusiness/13rupee.html?fta=y">NYT</a> reports on complaints issued by Brazil about US farm subsidies, especially commodities.</p>
<p>The stalled talks are emphasizing a deeper issue: In some ways, the balance of power between advanced and developing countries is shifting, politicians outside the West, including Mr. Nath, say. “The reality is that there is a new economic architecture,” Mr. Nath said in an interview this week in his New Delhi office. “This new economic architecture is going to have new windows and new doors. It can’t be wished away.”<br />India and Brazil are refusing to open their markets further to goods from Western countries without a substantial reduction in subsidies provided to Western farmers.<br /><em>On Thursday, Brazil filed a complaint with the W.T.O. about American farm subsidies. “This complaint attacks the entire U.S. farming policy,” Donizeti Beraldo, head of trade and international affairs at Brazil’s National Agriculture Confederation, was quoted by Bloomberg News as saying. Then, referring to the trade talks, Mr. Beraldo added, “If the U.S. fails to advance on talks, they will be at risk of more complaints.”<br /></em>W.T.O. members are preparing for what is expected to be a decisive round of negotiations at the group’s headquarters in Geneva. On Monday, the presiding officers will release draft agreements that could form the basis of a compromise or, depending on the view of countries like India, give a firm indication that the current round of trade talks begun in 2001 is on its last legs.<br />Mr. Nath, whose office includes a shelf of thick W.T.O.-related publications, was quick to brush off questions about his flexibility, but still left no room for compromise.<br />&#8230;<br />The issue is not flexibility, he said: “It is removal of subsidies, which are a distortion of global trade&#8230;&#8221;<br />&#8230;<br />India and Brazil are asking the United States to reduce the estimated $22 billion in subsidies that it allots to farmers, and the European Union to trim its farm aid from 55 billion euros ($75.8 billion), saying the subsidies keep food prices on world markets artificially low and make it difficult for farmers from developing countries to compete.<br />Advanced industrial nations would like to see a substantial reduction in the taxes on exports to countries like India and Brazil to give their manufacturers access to those fast-growing economies.<br />Mr. Nath said he is seeking some understanding from the United States. Despite the growth of outsourcing and high-technology jobs in India in recent years, agriculture still supports about two-thirds of the country’s citizens.<br />&#8230;<br />India is in the midst of an economic boom that has driven up stock market indexes, wages and real estate prices to near record highs. Still, Mr. Nath was quick to distance the country from developed- nation economies.<br />India “is so far away from the United States and the European Union,” he said.<br />“We have 300 million people that live on $1 a day&#8230;&#8221;<br />&#8230;<br />Mr. Nath’s hard line in the W.T.O. talks was in marked contrast to his three-year stretch as commerce minister. There, his tenure has been characterized by an increasing openness to foreign investment and partnership at home. He has sometimes faced criticism that he is too business-friendly.
