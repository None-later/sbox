                                <p>Thrilling, I know, but here&#8217;s the fact pattern that drove the discussion anyway:</p>
<p>1. The U.S. government, or organs thereof, commonly preaches free and open markets to the rest of the world.</p>
<p>2. The U.S. market for the delivery of &#8220;letter&#8221; mail (i.e. excluding packages) is subject to statutory monopolies both for delivery of certain types of mail and for access to consumer mailboxes, though there is considerable private provision of mailing services upstream of the delivery function.</p>
<p>3. U.S. postal regulation also until recently involved cost-of-service regulation that Some regarded as highly litigious.</p>
<p>4. The U.S. Postal Service provides its letter mail services at low cost and/or low price compared to nearly every other world postal administration.  (Possible exception regarding the latter, IIRC, the New Zealand post.)</p>
<p>Discuss?</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/05/27/AR2008052702555.html">Thomas Carothers</a> reminds us that:</p>
<blockquote><p>Proponents of a league only rarely mention the Community of Democracies, created by the United States in 2000, even though it closely parallels the proposed League of Democracies. They don&#8217;t speak of it because the community has been a serious disappointment, producing much talk but little action. Its weak record is not, as some suggest, due to the fact that a few autocratic governments are included. Rather, it reflects the reality that most democracies are unwilling to follow the United States in challenging national sovereignty when it comes to pushing for democracy.</p></blockquote>
<p>Carothers notes this in light of a larger problem with recent U.S. foreign policy:</p>
<blockquote><p>A punishing side effect of Bush&#8217;s policies abroad has been the despoilment of democracy promotion. Abuses of prisoners and detainees at U.S.-run facilities in Iraq, Afghanistan, Guantanamo Bay and elsewhere have undercut America&#8217;s standing as a defender of human rights. The constant identification of democracy promotion with the Iraq intervention and other regime-change policies has besmirched the very concept in the eyes of many people around the world. As a result, the last thing people in other countries are seeking from the next administration is a high-profile initiative tying democracy promotion to the global U.S. security agenda. The almost complete absence of any welcoming responses from outside the United States to the calls for a league underscores this fact. The idea of a league of democracies rests on the belief that democracies, by virtue of being democracies, have such common interests and perspectives that they will be able to act in unison on global problems. Yet most countries do not base their foreign policy primarily on the orientation of their political system. Instead, their actions reflect a constellation of diverse factors including regional identity, economic needs, historical traditions and religious outlook. Consequently, democracies can and do disagree seriously on basic matters. The United States does not, as Jackson Diehl suggested [op-ed, May 19], meet resistance at the United Nations to its policy initiatives only from nondemocratic states such as Russia and China. Most major developing-country democracies, such as Argentina, Brazil, India, Mexico and South Africa, differ deeply with United States, for example, on the question of interventionism as well as on trade policy, the war on terrorism and much else. Attempting to bind them together into a league with the United States would not change that. Yet excluding these countries from a league would render it a hollow, hypocritical institution. Also, if memory serves, wasn&#8217;t it some of Europe&#8217;s most established democracies that opposed the United States on Iraq? Would they, too, be left out in the interest of a league amenable to approving future U.S. interventions?</p></blockquote>
<p>McCain’s utterances on foreign policy strike me as too similar to the disastrous policies pursued by the current Administration.  His call for a League of Democracies should by itself disqualify him for serious consideration as the next President of the United States.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Social Security &#8216;crisis&#8217; is normally discussed in terms of Trust Fund Depletion. But given that this event has been pushed back to at least 2041 and boils down to a benefit in real terms 25% better than the one my Mom gets today (78% of 160% = 125%), and that some awareness of this leaked out during the &#8216;There is no crisis&#8217; campaign of 2005, opponents of Social Security had to retool and redefine crisis at Shortfall, which is to say the time that receipts from taxation fall behind Social Security cost and so require the General Fund to start paying back the money it borrowed. Since no serious argument can be made that the debt is not real, because after all they continue to borrow the current surplus presumedly in good faith, instead they pivot to &#8216;explain&#8217; that paying it back will put some intolerable strain on the overall budget and so require massive spending cuts or ruinous taxation increases. But as almost always they never actually put a price tag on this. So lets price Shortfall in inflation adjusted Constant Dollars. Source data here: <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/VI_OASDHI_dollars.html#140103">Table VI.F7.—Operations of the Combined OASI and DI Trust Funds, in Constant 2008 Dollars, Calendar Years 2008-85&#8243; [In billions]</a></p>
<p>Now generally when people talk about the Social Security surplus they include the accrued interest and talk about the General Fund borrowing $200 billion a year. And viewed from the standpoint of legacy debt this is fair enough, they are assuming future obligations for that amount. But that interest is not in fact financed, the only real cash extracted from the economy and so the only real dollars that can be used to pay for real current spending are the actual excess tax dollars over current costs.  Lots and lots of nummy numbers below the fold.</p>
<p>Between 2008 and 2017 the system is projected to run surpluses, but how much of that is actually cash? In this case the first column represents total surplus, the second cash flow (all under Intermediate Cost assumptions, dollars in billions)<br />2008 $196  $79 <br />2009 $208  $86<br />2010 $214  $84<br />2011 $216  $76<br />2012 $214  $66<br />2013 $209  $52<br />2014 $200  $35<br />2015 $190  $18<br />2016 $180  $2<br />2017 $164  -$19 {oops, had to edit from -$21, which is the net change from 2016 and not the actual transfer for 2017}<br />In light of this we can see how misplaced the hysteria really is. These are not particularly big dollars to start with and over the next ten years the General Fund will be gently weaned off what is in context a pretty meager flow, the idea that a transition from a $2 billion cash surplus in 2016 to a $19 billion dollar cash deficit in 2017 roiling the world credit markets or demanding huge slashes in spending or ruinous tax increase is in numeric context simple nonsense, particularly as here if you adjust the numbers for inflation. But doesn&#8217;t it just get worse going forwards? Well lets see. At this point the table shifts to five year periods meaning we have to interpolate for 2023, the date the total surplus is being tapped and principal has to be repaid. These figures represent total transfers from the General Fund, once again adjusted for inflation. {Oops had to edit, got 2017 and 2023 mixed up the first time around}.</p>
<p>2017    $19<br />2020    $77<br />2023  ~$150<br />2025    $172<br />2030    $258<br />2035    $313<br />2040    $335<br />2042    $0</p>
<p>In short financing Social Security through 2041 means deficits in real terms less than the typical ones run by this Bush Administration and in context much smaller than those run in Reagan/Bush I days. If we exercise even a little restraint on the General Fund side this gap is easily digestible, especially if we note that it is in principle temporary, there is no positive legal obligation for the General Fund to backfill any income/cost gap after 2041. Once you put the numbers in context any real content to &#8216;crisis&#8217; simply melts away. Which is why privatizers never put the numbers in context.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p><a href="http://www.rcosoftware.com/Articles/ManageGlobalization.pdf">Vladimir Masch</a> has offered some radical solutions to the problems of globalization. In terms of the U.S., here is how he describes the problem:</p>
<blockquote><p>The US is currently in a precarious position, one of the most dangerous in its history. In addition to geopolitical threats, we face a severe economic shock. The enormous wealth of this country is transferred abroad at a high and accelerating rate. To finance our voracious consumption, we borrow from potential adversaries. We lose important industries and millions of middle-class jobs. With the industrial base being destroyed, our security is compromised. The country has lost every important economic weapon that can be used in thorny geopolitical situations, which will prevail in this century.</p></blockquote>
<p>At the heart of the problem is the problem of trade, a problem that few economists have addressed. Instead, we have a &#8220;relentless propaganda&#8221; machine, headed by economists on both the right and on the left&#8211;Krugman and Mankiw are examples&#8211;that globalization as practiced will bring benefits to all. Free Trade is the mantra. And here are the results.</p>
<blockquote><p>In 2006, its current account deficit will probably reach about $900B, or almost 7% of GDP, with its rise accelerating. In just one year, the deficit exceeded more than twice our expense on the Iraq war for four years. The notorious &#8220;bridge to nowhere&#8221; costs $222 million; in foreign trade, we lose that amount every two and a half hours. In 6 to 8 years, just our return payments on foreign holdings on US securities may reach half a trillion dollars a year. A large part of that debt is borrowed from China, our potential adversary; it holds now more than one trillion dollars of currency reserves, predominantly in the US debt securities, and expects to double that amount in four years. This is an ever-growing mortgage on our country, and the situation is unsustainable. Even President Bush, a religious devotee of free trade, says so. </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>The just completed draft of the Horizon Project, which is intended to be a Marshall type Plan for America and has been authored by eleven eminent CEOs and policy<br />innovators, comes to basically the same conclusions. The Horizon Project talks about &#8220;a hollowing out of American productive and services capacity,&#8221; about &#8220;the US international trade position … being in free fall,&#8221; about &#8220;many U.S. multinational corporations which … seem tempted to off shore almost everything but consumption.&#8221; Consequently, &#8220;The traditional U.S. trade surplus in agricultural products is nearing zero, in high-technology products it has turned negative, and in trade services it is small and declining as a proportion of total trade.&#8221; Moreover, it considers emigration of such industries as chip manufacturing to China, Taiwan and South Korea as &#8220;very unwise,&#8221; as these areas are threatened by potential geopolitical disturbance in the region that might &#8220;greatly diminish U.S. armed forces operations and effectiveness.&#8221; </p></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>The present relatively low rates of inflation and unemployment and satisfactory rates of growth were bought at an enormous price of transferring our wealth and labor force abroad. </p></blockquote>
<p>Vladimir addresses the so-called law of &#8220;comparative advantage&#8221;, which assumes that every country will specialize in what it does best. While theoretically, the law seems elegant and incontrovertible, it ignores important externalities such as adjustment costs&#8211;re-training, etc.</p>
<p>Outsource everything&#8211;full speed ahead. Damn the costs. And, if the money has flowed abroad or into CEO and corporate coffers, who is to pick up the tab? How are we to adjust? How do we pay for re-training? And in what?</p>
<p>We are not talking here about a few people; we are talking about millions of people and uncountable industries. And then, of course, we have to wait&#8211;painfully&#8211;while wages equalize&#8230;if they ever do. And what has been the result: Enormous polarity in the distribution of wealth. So many problems; so little thought has been given to them.</p>
<p>No economist gave any thought to wage disparity; it simply became tucked into the law of comparative advantage.</p>
<p>No economist ever gave thought to labor rights as essential for sound trade. Again, labor rights became a mere externality&#8211;an uncomfortable side issue that deflates the bottom line.</p>
<p>Should the WTO have insisted that China protect labor rights prior to WTO entry? Of course it should have.</p>
<p>Right wingers love to tell us how much better off the poor peasant is in his sweat shop. Does the right winger care about sweatshop labor conditions? Of course not. Meanwhile, the rich get richer. And meanwhile, the U.S. is headed down the tubes.</p>
<p>And while we are at it, let me suggest another difficulty: Specialization has its own difficulties, as I pointed out in this piece: <a href="http://www2.blogger.com/angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/05/local-or-global.html"><i>Local or Global</i></a> .</p>
<p>Specialization puts any country at risk, especially in key commodities. And if big players with deep pockets can quickly shift money to exploit the problems, what then? According to one wag, 60% of the cost of oil is a result of one such shift. (While I do not agree with this figure, many here apparently do. And if they do, what say they then about free trade?)</p>
<p>Vladimir has described the problem, at least for the U.S. And what is his answer: Trade balances must be controlled. He suggests the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Congress sets annual limits (upper bounds) on the overall U.S. trade deficit in consumer goods and undesirable capital goods (oil and gas excluded)</li>
<li>The President of the U.S. allocates the allowed deficit for each of our trading counterparts—countries or groups of countries</li>
<li>A country may exceed the limit if its government pays the U.S. Treasury a stipulated percentage (up to the full amount) of the excess deficit, also approved for each country by the President of the U.S. These payments may be capped</li>
<li>To raise the money for excess deficit payments, our trading counterparts may either use export taxes and export certificate auctions or pay from their currency reserves</li>
</ol>
<p>Interesting, but I think unworkable.</p>
<p>Imagine telling China that it must compensate us for its trade surplus! And what do we say to poor Mexico? Or to Canada? Send us our monthly check, please.</p>
<p>My own solution is three-fold and it is based on the following&#8211;over 60% of China&#8217;s exports are from foreign companies inside of China. Unless we address that uncomfortable fact&#8211;almost 80% in IT&#8211;, our goose is cooked.</p>
<ol>
<li>Insist that all countries protect labor rights. No more fast track trade deals that are merely grease for our companies to find cheap labor.</p>
</li>
<li>Reform the WTO or withdraw from it. The WTO should immediately start a process whereby all WTO countries move towards an acceptable standard for the protection of labor. Better late then never.</li>
<li>Tax goods that U.S. companies make with cheap overseas labor. Put a price on outsourcing and offshoring. Hey, Intel and Apple, no more free rides. Hey, Walmart, your prices are going up. Time to compete fairly.</li>
</ol>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Yesterday afternoon, a trio of fellow <a href="http://crri.rutgers.edu/references/post/index.html">Conference on Postal and Delivery Economics</a> attendees and I were marveling at the emptiness of the A2 motorway connecting the southern exburbs of Lisbon and the Algarve region.  Certainly, there is not a whole lot of stuff en route, but you could say the same thing about a lot of points 250 km apart along the Interstate highway system west of the Mississippi River; those are not that lightly-traveled.</p>
<p>There are income and substitution effects to consider: Portugal&#8217;s per-capita GDP is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_European_Union#Economic_variation">75% of the EU average</a> (or less than 2/3ds that of Rich Europe), and fuel was dear at around €1.50/liter — though the preponderance of small diesel-powered cars implies a much smaller difference in per-km costs versus the U.S. than you&#8217;d get from the pump price.  But one of the bigger hits was the toll of almost €19.  A 150-km ride on the Pennsylvania Turnpike a couple weeks ago for another conference was $4; the Illinois Northwest Tollway, highly congested in the Chicago suburbs and exurbs, only hits you up for $2 between the Wisconsin state line and the toll-free city Chicago expressways if you use the system enough to shell out for an I-Pass transponder (they price-discriminate by charging twice the I-Pass toll for cash, which for all I know may be going on here, too).</p>
<p>This makes me think that the main concern for the privatization of tollways is less the outsourcing of toll-raising dirty work to the private sector so much as whether the states are adequately compensated for such right to raise the tolls as they sell. (*)</p>
<p>* To possibly forestall certain lines of comments, I don&#8217;t actually support government eating-of-capital as a politically expedient alternative to raising other taxes.</p>

                                <p>Lifted from comments cactus style, Reader FS fills in some of the info on the farm bill:</p>
<blockquote><p>Here are CBO figures on the new farm bill.</p>
<p>Total expenditures, 2008 through 2012: $301.382 Billion (B), or about $60 billion per year.</p>
<p>CBO computes changes in expenditures relative to its March 2008 budget baseline. The total changes over the 2008-2012 period are:</p>
<p>Commodity program -1.875 billion (B)</p>
<p>Conservation: 2.845 B</p>
<p>Trade: 0.161 B</p>
<p>Nutrition (i.e., Food Stamps) 3.111 B<br />(for the 10 year period of 2008-2017, this jumps to 9.669 B)</p>
<p>Credit program: -0.396 B</p>
<p>Rural development: 0.122 B</p>
<p>Research: 0.031 B</p>
<p>Forestry: 0.038 B</p>
<p>Energy: 0.615 B</p>
<p>Horticulture &#038; Organic Ag: 0.402 B</p>
<p>Livestock: 0.001 B</p>
<p>Crop Insurance: -4.517 B</p>
<p>Commodity futures: 0.000 B</p>
<p>Misc: 0.190 B</p>
<p>Trade &#038; Tax provisions: 4.930 B</p>
<p>Total change: 5.659 B</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know for certain, but I&#8217;d guess that the ACRE program is part of the 4.930 B.</p>
<p>&#8212;-</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a quick explanation of why these changes are taking place.</p>
<p>The ACRE program now being introduced is designed to be a permanent disaster assistance program. It&#8217;s intended to replace ad-hoc disaster assistance that Congress provides on a frequent basis &#8211; particularly in election years.</p>
<p>From a broad perspective, disaster assistance should be understood as being free crop insurance. Farmers recover their losses once under their crop insurance policies and then a second time via disaster aid. What could be sweeter? However, to reach an agreement on this bill, Congress was forced to take money out of the crop insurance program in order to fund the ACRE program. This was done by reducing the overlap in payments between the two programs.</p>
<p>Of course, major legislative changes like this don&#8217;t just happen by accident. The concept of a permanent disaster aid program (though not necessarily the ACRE program itself) was being pushed by a number of the farm commodity groups, which wanted greater assurance that money would be available on a timely basis. Also, certain commodity groups were due to lose a large portion of their government commodity program payments due to high crop prices. By proposing a new federal program, the commodity groups were able to establish a much higher price support guarantee than farmers would have received if the existing programs had simply been extended. Voila! The money will still be headed their way.</p>
<p>This doesn&#8217;t mean that the ACRE program is all bad. Considering how much money Congress has been providing in ad-hoc disaster aid recently, it&#8217;s possible that total expenditures may actually go down under the ACRE program. Of course, this assumes that Congress will finally stop passing ad-hoc disaster assistance legislation.</p>
<p>Let me just say that my experiences during the past several months remind me of the old saying that you never want to watch sausages or legislation being made.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>Via <a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2008/05/how-to-reduce-health-care-costs.html">Greg Mankiw</a>, <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB121184703435121427.html?mod=opinion_main_commentaries">Jagdish Bhagwati and Sandip Madan</a> propose free trade and greater competition among U.S. doctors:</p>
<blockquote><p>But the importation of doctors is even more critical in meeting supply needs than in providing lower costs. According to the 2005 Census, the U.S. had an estimated availability of 2.4 doctors per 1,000 population (the number was 3.3 in leading developed countries tracked by the OECD). Comprehensive coverage of the over 45 million uninsured today will require that they can access doctors and related medical personnel. An IOU that cannot be cashed in is worthless. Massachusetts ran into this problem: Few doctors wanted (or were able, given widespread shortages in many specialties) to treat many of the patients qualifying under the program. The solution lies in allowing imports of medical personnel tied into tending to the newly insured. This is what the Great Society program did in the 1960s, with imports of doctors whose visas tied them, for specific periods, to serving remote, rural areas. U.S.-trained physicians practicing for a specified period in an &#8220;underserved&#8221; area were not required to return home. It is time to expand such programs – for instance, by making physicians trained at accredited foreign institutions eligible for such entry into the U.S. But in order to do this, both Democratic candidates will first need to abandon their party&#8217;s antipathy to foreign trade.</p></blockquote>
<p>The late Milton Friedman would likely be impressed.  Not only was he a proponent of free trade, his diagnosis of the health care issue was often that we needed more competition among doctors.  This plea also reminds me of what Dean Baker has often argued.  </p>
<p>But I must protest the last line in this oped.  Some liberal Democrats (e.g., yours truly) do not have an antipathy to the free mobility of workers.  Bhagwati and Madan have an excellent proposal that I hope Barack Obama decides to adopt.</p>

<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.cdt.org/publications/policyposts/2008/6">In an effort to track down unreported small business income</a>, the U.S. Treasury is calling on Congress to create a sweeping new program that would require all credit card companies to report the income of all merchants to the Internal Revenue Service. </p>
<p>The proposal, raised in President Bush&#8217;s FY2009 budget, would require credit card companies to report the aggregate transactions of all of their merchants (that is, all the businesses that have merchant accounts with the card companies and to whom credit card payments are made). The reports to the IRS would have to be tied to the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) of the merchant. Many small businesses use their owners&#8217; Social Security Numbers as their TIN. A similar program aimed at Internet &#8220;brokers,&#8221; including eBay and Amazon, which raised privacy concerns last year, seems to have been dropped from this year&#8217;s budget proposal. </p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>The credit card reporting proposal is another example of efforts to require businesses to retain records of their customers for government purposes. Last year, the Treasury Department suggested data retention rules for Internet &#8220;brokers&#8221; such as Amazon and eBay, and the Justice Department has been calling for federal legislation that would require Internet service providers to retain information about their customers for months or even years at a time. </p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>In May 2007, the Office of Management and Budget called on government agencies to report on and cut down on the use of Social Security Numbers and to look into using alternatives to the numbers for internal identification. The reason for this policy is that widespread collection and storage of SSNs and TINs creates a risk of identity theft and fraud. </p>
<p>The OMB action followed the April 2007 Justice Department and FTC plan to combat identity theft, which called on government agencies to reduce unnecessary use of SSNs. The logic of reducing use of SSN use is obvious. SSNs are an essential element of many types of ID theft and often one of the main targets of serious data breaches. Until we can limit the frequency of data breaches, we can at least limit the negative exposure caused by breaches by limiting the number of places we store SSNs. </p>
<p>The underlying finding of the DOJ-FTC report — that SSNs are a prime target for identity thieves and that their use should be limited — is difficult to reconcile with a plan that calls for massive new collection and storage of TINs. </p>
<p>Although the DOJ-FTC report implies that the IRS is an appropriate agency to collect TINs, forcing credit card companies to maintain the data on all merchants creates a major new risk for those taxpayers who have done nothing wrong.</p></blockquote>
<p>Several things:<br />1. Income from small businesses is a great unknown to some and needs investigating, but the same are content with minimal enforcement of shelters and such of larger corporations and investors.  <br />2. Since when has paying a fair share been important to this adminisration? <br />3. This appears to be another extension of total awareness programing mentality.  &#8216;What&#8217;s in your wallet&#8217; becomes the business of someone somewhere for possible criminal proceedings, not just marketing.<br />4. Will &#8216;cash&#8217; become obsolete in the mainstream?</p>

                                <p>John McCain loves to say he has had more experience at war than Barack Obama when he explains his opposition to the legislation that would provide additional college financial aid to veterans, which passed overwhelmingly in the <a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/C/CAMPAIGN_RDP?SITE=KLIF&#038;SECTION=HOME&#038;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT">Senate</a>.  There’s a problem with this boosting – the author of the bill was James Webb who also served in Vietnam and also served as Secretary of the Navy under President Reagan.  But then McCain also made the following claim:</p>
<blockquote><p>McCain said he opposed Webb&#8217;s measure because it would give the same benefit to everyone regardless of how many times he or she has enlisted. He said he feared that would depress reenlistments by those wanting to attend college after only a few years in uniform. McCain said the bill he favored would have increased scholarships based on length of service.</p></blockquote>
<p>Originally, the story we linked to had the <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2008/05/mccain_responds_to_obama_on_ve.html">following claim</a> from McCain:</p>
<blockquote><p>The most important difference between our two approaches is that Senator Webb offers veterans who served one enlistment the same benefits as those offered veterans who have re-enlisted several times. Our bill has a sliding scale that offers generous benefits to all veterans, but increases those benefits according to the veteran&#8217;s length of service. I think it is important to do that because, otherwise, we will encourage more people to leave the military after they have completed one enlistment. At a time when the United States military is fighting in two wars, and as we finally are beginning the long overdue and very urgent necessity of increasing the size of the Army and Marine Corps, one study estimates that Senator Webb&#8217;s bill will reduce retention rates by 16%.</p></blockquote>
<p>One study?  What study?  Political hacks love to do this – claim some un-cited study supports their spin?  Rather than pull the quote from this press story, the press should insist that McCain provide us with his supposed evidence so we can review it for ourselves.</p>
<p>Update:  <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2008/05/09/cbo-webb-hagel">Faiz</a> had already pointed to a <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/92xx/doc9212/s22.pdf">CBO analysis</a> of the Webb-Hagel proposal.  Note what CBO really said about the recruitment and retention effects:</p>
<blockquote><p>Educational benefits have been shown to raise the number of military recruits. Based on an analysis of the existing literature, CBO estimates that a 10 percent increase in educational benefits would result in an increase of about 1 percent in high-quality recruits. On that basis, CBO calculates that raising the educational benefits as proposed in S. 22 would result in a 16 percent increase in recruits.  Literature on the effects of educational benefits on retention suggest that every $10,000 increase in educational benefits yields a reduction in retention of slightly more than 1 percentage point. CBO estimates that S. 22 (as modified) would more than double the present value of educational benefits for service members at the first reenlistment point — from about $40,000 to over $90,000 — implying a 16 percent decline in the reenlistment rate, from about 42 percent to about 36 percent.</p></blockquote>
<p>By looking at only retention and ignoring recruitment, McCain is effectively telling us another one of his great big fibs.  I guess the AP pulled McCain’s comment about one study – lest he be shown to be a liar again.  But isn’t pointing out when politicians lie to us the job of the press?</p>
<p>Update II: <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2008/05/the-gi-bill-and.html">Mark Thoma</a> offered a few sage thoughts on this retention and recruitment issue.  Mark – thanks for the comment reminding us!  Maybe McCain wants more retention and less recruitment as he thinks the army like the Presidency should have elder members.</p>
