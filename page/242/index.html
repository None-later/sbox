<p>Well, the repubs <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/news/House-GOP-Lists-25-Trillion-usnews-2718863982.html?x=0&#038;sec=topStories&#038;pos=main&#038;asset=&#038;ccode=">finally have put up</a>.  They have a $2.5 trillion, ten year savings plan.  No, don&#8217;t worry.  You will be kept safe as all national security is untouched.  However, you can expect to wake up the next day from passage in a nation with an completely different personality.  As in 180 degree different.</p>
<blockquote><p>Here is the overview provided by the Republican Study Committee:</p>
<p>FY 2011 CR Amendment: Replace the spending levels in the FY 2011 continuing resolution (NYSE: CR &#8211; News) with non-defense, non-homeland security, non-veterans spending at FY 2008 levels. The legislation will further prohibit any FY 2011 funding from being used to carry out any provision of the Democrat government takeover of health care, or to defend the health care law against any lawsuit challenging any provision of the act. $80 billion savings.</p>
<p>Discretionary Spending Limit, FY 2012-2021: Eliminate automatic increases for inflation from CBO baseline projections for future discretionary appropriations. Further, impose discretionary spending limits through 2021 at 2006 levels on the non-defense portion of the discretionary budget. $2.29 trillion savings over ten years.</p>
<p>Federal Workforce Reforms: Eliminate automatic pay increases for civilian federal workers for five years. Additionally, cut the civilian workforce by a total of 15 percent through attrition. Allow the hiring of only one new worker for every two workers who leave federal employment until the reduction target has been met. (Savings included in above discretionary savings figure).</p>
<p>&#8220;Stimulus&#8221; Repeal: Eliminate all remaining &#8220;stimulus&#8221; funding. $45 billion total savings.</p>
<p>Eliminate federal control of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. $30 billion total savings.</p>
<p>Repeal the Medicaid FMAP increase in the &#8220;State Bailout&#8221; (Senate amendments to S. 1586). $16.1 billion total savings.</p></blockquote>
<p>The 100 item list is below</p>
<p><a name="more"></a>Some of the items, cutting them, you just have to ask: How are they going to get the job done?  Like cutting by 20% the federal vehicle budget or cut in half the congressional printing and binding budget?  What, we&#8217;re going to suddenly seen legislation that is only 1/2 the size of pages?  I&#8217;m sorry folks, but this list is nothing but an ideological hit list.  There is not thought at all regarding intergration as it relates to investing in this country or even governing.  Can you say: New York snow storm clearing disaster?</p>

                                <p>Many years ago, I had a Cultural Anthropology professor who discussed the glories of the mechanical cherry-picker. The only catch was that (1) it had upfront and maintenance costs and (2) it performs less well than experienced cherry-pickers. In short, it would be useful if you have a shortage of labor and an excess of capital, but not—as is common in cherry-picking areas—the reverse.</p>
<p>Roy Mayall at The London Review of Books blog notes <a href="http://www.lrb.co.uk/blog/2011/01/19/roy-mayall/model-of-a-modern-royal-mail/">that the same type of conceit is being used by the Royal Mail</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Walk-sequencing machines sort the letters into the order that they are going to be delivered in. The old walk-sorting machines only organised the post into rounds: postal workers had to do the final sorting. Under the old system, all the post was in the delivery office by 7.15 and we were usually out on our rounds by 9.00. Under the new system, the last lorry arrives at 9.15 and sometimes we don’t get out until after 11.00. It’s quite normal for a postal worker to finish work at 3.30 these days, and for posties doing rural rounds still to be delivering letters as late as four in the afternoon. The machines also have a tendency to break down, as we&#8217;ve just discovered, so on some days no post is delivered at all. <em>But they are central to the Royal Mail’s &#8216;modernisation&#8217; programme.</em> [italics mine]</p></blockquote>
<p>And, as with newspaper deliveries in the United States, the emphasis on capital over labor has collateral costs to both:<br />
<blockquote>The Royal Mail have scrapped all the bikes in Milton Keynes and replaced them with vans. Vans are obviously much more modern than bikes. They are also more expensive. Not only do they cost several thousand pounds to buy, they cost several hundred pounds a year to tax and insure&#8230;.</p>
<p>Vans are also slower and less versatile than bikes. They are quicker along the road, but once on your round you have to get out and walk, pulling the post behind you on a trolley. It’s awkward. After a while it puts a strain on your back. And you can’t read the envelopes as you’re walking, which slows things down even more. Rounds that used to take three and a half hours to complete are now taking up to five. Whoever devised this method has obviously never delivered a letter in their life.</p></blockquote>
<p>There&#8217;s a possibility that the shift to cars allows you to downsize labor. (It also means you cannot deliver the post without a driver&#8217;s licence.) But the cost of labor is virtually never the primary cost in a service industry, and it is unlikely to be cost-saving when you go from spending nothing on petrol to <a href="http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/statistics/source/prices/prices.aspx">buying a commodity whose cost increased 9.9% in the past year</a>, and which <a href="http://www.decc.gov.uk/media/viewfile.ashx?filepath=statistics/source/prices/weeklyfuel.xls&#038;filetype=4&#038;minwidth=true">is currently running about 1.30 per litre</a>. When your Fixed Cost of &#8220;0&#8221; becomes a Variable Cost much larger than zero, those &#8220;savings&#8221; disappear rather quickly.</p>
<p>As Mr. Mayall summarizes:<br />
<blockquote>&#8216;Modernising&#8217; the Royal Mail means replacing a tried and tested method that’s been good for more than a hundred years with one that is more tiring, more polluting, slower and more expensive.</p></blockquote>
<p>If the goal were optimal processing, he would be correct. If, instead, the idea is to exploit a difference in net pricing between capital and labor and leave the consequences and externalities to the future, then the Royal Mail becomes just a contemporary example of bad economic policies leading to poor social outcomes.</p>
<p>In that context, it&#8217;s not even especially noteworthy. Just ask, say, <a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/01/14/jpmorgans-fourth-quarter-profits-rise-47-to-4-8-billion/">Jaime Dimon</a>.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/TTY0hkgsvaI/AAAAAAAADcA/66WykKjfwt0/s1600/CA_TIC_chart.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/TTY0hkgsvaI/AAAAAAAADcA/66WykKjfwt0/s320/CA_TIC_chart.jpg" border="0"></a>According to the <a href="http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/tic/Pages/index.aspx">Treasury International Capital System</a> (TIC) release, foreigners were net buyers of US securities in November, +$39 billion over the month. Of the $61.7 billion in long-term Treasuries net purchased (notes and bonds), private investors claimed $50.6, while official investors (central banks, sovereign wealth funds, etc.) accrued a smaller $11.1 billion. Over the last twelve months, foreign investors amassed $571 billion of the high-quality US securities: Treasury notes and bonds, agencies, and stocks, which includes the -$12 billion net sale of corporate bonds. Overall, it was a reasonably positive report, indicating that long-term asset sales are roughly in line with the current account deficit (chart to the upper left).</p>
<p>But the pundits follow <a href="http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/tic/Documents/mfh.txt">the table on</a> major foreign holders of US Treasuries. <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/article/november-tic-data-update-china-treasury-holdings-decline-112-billion">They note</a> that the number 1 holder, China, reduced its holdings of Treasuries in November from just over $900 billion to just under. For some reason, investors and critics of the deficit alike are worried that when China is no longer named the US&#8217; biggest stockpiler of Treasury securities, Treasury rates will skyrocket. Oh, the bond vigilantes.</p>
<p>And this is when I really miss Brad Setser&#8217;s commentary (he is now at the National Economic Council). He noted time and time again, that the monthly TIC data tend to under-report the Chinese holdings, especially when they are shifting their portfolio holdings of US Treasuries up the curve. Well, that&#8217;s what the Chinese did in November: holdings of US Tbills dropped $21 billion, while longer-term note holdings increased a net $9.9 billion. (more after the jump)<br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.cfr.org/setser/2009/06/19/i-am-pretty-sure-china-didnt-sell-treasuries-in-april-or-may-for-that-matter/">According to Brad Setser</a>, only in the annual <a href="http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/tic/Pages/fpis.aspx">survey of US portfolio holdings</a> are China&#8217;s measured holdings of US Treasuries accurate:<br />
<blockquote>This is actually a well established pattern. The past five surveys of foreign portfolio investment in the US have all revised China’s long-term Treasury holdings up (in some cases quite significantly) even as they revised the UK’s holdings down. The following graph shows the gap between Chinese long-term Treasury purchases in the TIC data and China’s actual purchases of long-term Treasuries– as revealed in the survey.</p></blockquote>
<p>Brad Setser&#8217;s quote was from 2009, but the story hasn&#8217;t changed since. In the 2010 report for 2009 foreign holdings, the level of Chinese Treasury holdings was revised up from the TIC-implied level by near $140 billion, while that of the UK was revised down (by over 100 billion, I might add). Clockwork.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s apply Brad&#8217;s test, <strong>I&#8217;ll call it the Setser Test</strong>, to see if China actually reduced US Treasury holdings in November, as the November TIC release suggests. (I highlighted Brad&#8217;s test in bold italics, RW is me). <a href="http://blogs.cfr.org/setser/2009/06/19/i-am-pretty-sure-china-didnt-sell-treasuries-in-april-or-may-for-that-matter/">The test is listed in the middle of this post.<br /></a><br /><strong>Brad: First, the TIC data should show a fall in China’s holdings, i.e. net sales of Treasuries.</strong></p>
<p>RW: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Second, the TIC data should also show limited purchases of Treasuries through the UK.</p>
<p></strong><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/TTc4p5bSryI/AAAAAAAADcQ/ylPhU_-gc6I/s1600/treasury_country.JPG"><strong><img alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/TTc4p5bSryI/AAAAAAAADcQ/ylPhU_-gc6I/s320/treasury_country.JPG" border="0"></strong></a>RW: No. The UK bought near $25 billion in Treasury notes and bonds, which more than offset the drop in Chinese Treasury buying. In fact, if the TIC data is accurate, the UK is amassing a rather large stockpile of US Treasuries. This would be in sharp contrast with the average $48 billion balance of Treasury holdings since 2006 (<a href="http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/tic/Pages/ticsec.aspx">Table 4 or 5 depending on the year</a>)!</p>
<p><strong>Third, the Fed’s custodial holdings should not be rising at a strong clip — as, given China’s size, it is hard to see how China doesn’t make up a large fraction of all custodial holdings.</p>
<p></strong>RW: <a href="http://federalreserve.gov/releases/h41/Current/">The Fed&#8217;s custodial holdings</a> increased by a sizable $39 billion. More likely than not, this was due in part to Chinese activity.</p>
<p>So according to the Setser Test, it&#8217;s very unlikely that China reduced its Treasury holdings in November. In fact they probably increased their Treasury holdings, given the magnitude of the Fed&#8217;s custodial balance.</p>

<p>There are several thoughts that occur to me regarding this list,<br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>but the first is that readers and those who comment make a difference&#8230;people bring information and insights that go far beyond slogans of the moment or passions of the day, although those are are part of the deal. This is true for each blog but also from my experience readers usually have at least several blogs on their lists, and often are not organized simply by political economic approach as the first criterion. One can read NC or Economist&#8217;s View as well as Mish.</p>
<p>These blogs are data driven in various ways and often contain many links that allow easy access to data, original materials, or documents so people may check accuracy of the post. In looking for new writers for AB this is one criterion that is mandatory overall, and even decent writers of blogs with strong opinions often omit links to such data or docs, which is unsatisfactory but average for writing. The extra care for targeted audiences pays off.</p>
<p>Most are dominated or driven by a person with a strong presentation style and implied forceful personality who spends a lot of time gathering information and is part of the industry. Angry Bear is a multi-authored blog that has more of a magazine format than most.</p>
<p><a href="http://ibankcoin.com/chessnwine/2011/01/15/ibcs-top-finance-blogs-of-the-internet-2/" target="_blank">Another recent list</a> ranked 20 top financial blogs includes AB and is based on pageviews, but the notion they added appears to have a definition of finance that includes advice to investors.</p>
<p>Anyway, our readers and commenters deserve the credit in addition to the contributors. Thanks all. Dan </p>

                                <blockquote><p>ddrew2u <br />Beginner&#8217;s question:  <br />I was reading Krugman&#8217;s long article on how the Euro allowed weak countries to borrow on the same easy terms as strong countries &#8212; leading to the usual (e.g., Irish) bankers lending excess monies to people who can&#8217;t pay back.  The usual cure &#8212; if a country has its own currency &#8212; is to devalue in order to pay back in cheaper currency and encourage export growth (I think).  Somehow the equivalent of this &#8212; if you don&#8217;t have your own currency &#8212; is supposed to be to cut wages.  </p>
<p>How does cutting wages help pay back your country&#8217;s debts?  </p>
<p>This is a big hangup to me as a big prolabor guy.  I&#8217;m thinking America (not Europe) can get going again by paying people more &#8212; 15% of income having shifted from the bottom 90% who would definintely spend it to the top 3%, mostly top 1%, who wont spend it and have nothing healthy to invest it in given lack of demand in a recession (not to mention lack of demand from people who should have gotten the income in the first place!).  I don&#8217;t like the idea of cutting European wages either</p></blockquote>
<p>My answer after the jump.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s do America.  One way in which we could pay our debts is if the dollar declined in value.  That should cause increased exports and reduced imports so we would run a trade surplus. If that surplus was greater than the amount we have to pay our foreign creditors minus the income on our foreign assets, we would have a current account surplus so our debt would shrink (we would have a capital account deficit).</p>
<p>Strange but true, the US current account deficit is simiilar to our trade deficit.  Even though on paper we are huge debtors (biggest evar) our foreign assets pay a much higher rate of return than our debts to foreigners.</p>
<p>But if Ireland uses Euros so it can&#8217;t devalue. Or can it.  What if all wages, prices and rents in ireland were cut in half ? The effect would be the same as if they still had Irish Punts which devalued 50% against the Euro &#8212; foreign goods and services would suddenly cost twice as much compared to Irish goods and services.</p>
<p>The balanced decline in wages and prices (including rents) is called an internal devaluation.  In the real world, it is  very slow and painful process.</p>
<p>Part of the trick was that, in the case of devaluation of the dollar (or punt) I assumed that both the prices of domestically made goods and nominal wages stayed the same.  In the real world, firms by foreign made materials, so their costs (in dollars) increase.  When discussing devaluation, I assumed that firms produce using only capital and labor so if wages, the price of the capital and the interest rate don&#8217;t change, then costs don&#8217;t change.  Trade was modelled only as trade in finished goods. </p>
<p>So it is hard to say how prices should change in order to mimic the effects of a devaluation.  Also economists often assume that prices automatically adjust to equal marginal cost (perfect competition &#8212; a clearly false assumption made for convenience) or a multiple of marginal costs (fixed markups again a clearly false assumptino made for convenience and often made by Krugman).</p>
<p>Given either of these comforting fantasies, the instruction &#8220;cut wages and prices to make everything change just as it would with a devaluation and no I don&#8217;t know how much the price of that banana should be cut&#8221; becomes &#8220;cut wages and prices will take care of themeselves.&#8221;</p>

                                <p>We try to pretend we&#8217;re not actually human sometimes. And sometimes we have to decide not to pretend.</p>
<p>Many of the Life Cycle Theory models for economics assume limited borrowing constraints: you can&#8217;t borrow more than you will make (present valued), but you can borrow on future earnings.</p>
<p>You can only do that for so long until the projections start shifting and you hit a constraint even in a perfect <s>model</s>world.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t a perfect world. Four people who have recently hit constraints:  <a href="http://cabdrollery.blogspot.com/">Diane</a>, <a href="http://alicublog.blogspot.com/">Roy</a>, <a href="http://amygdalagf.blogspot.com/">Gary</a>, and <a href="http://lancemannion.typepad.com/">Lance</a>.  That&#8217;s probably in reverse order of need at the moment: people came through well for Diane over the weekend, and Roy has a wide audience.</p>
<p>So <a href="http://lancemannion.typepad.com/">hit Lance&#8217;s tip jar</a> if you can only hit one.</p>
<p>But remember: one of the things that happened in NYC after 11 September 2001 is that people started giving blood.  People who didn&#8217;t normally give were donating; the place I usually give at was suddenly booked.</p>
<p>You know what happened next.  Blood, unlike money, isn&#8217;t fungible or transferable. Six months later, there were shortages again.</p>
<p>If you can&#8217;t hit the tip jars now, but have a windfall later and are thinking about paying it forward: go read their blogs, and be ready for the next time. They don&#8217;t do what we do, but life isn&#8217;t only economics.</p>
<p>In the midst of the recovery, we need to <a href="http://www.changeeverything.ca/blog/catherine_ludgate/it-makes-difference-one-starfish">give chances to as many starfish as we can</a>.</p>
<p>And if, by chance, you are one of those starfish who needs help right now, Gary&#8217;s post <a href="http://amygdalagf.blogspot.com/2011/01/help-blogger-who-isnt-me-out.html">here</a> may be useful.</p>
<p>Or if you know of someone else who is in dire straights, mention it in comments (or send me an e-mail) so it can be added to this post.<br />

<p>My aging Subaru had a problem a while back. Leak of transmission fluid; a seal or another failing, leading to steady dripping out. And with little need to open the hood, no gauge—or even an &#8220;idiot light&#8221;—on the dashboard, it dripped for quite a while. And then some.</p>
<p>The first repair—call it Quizzical Effort 1—refilled the fluid, but didn&#8217;t find the leak. So we started driving it again, but were a bit more alert for signs that it was doing things such as slipping out of gear or having trouble accelerating from a stop.</p>
<p>We took it to another, better shop for Quizzical Effort 2 (QE2). There they found the leak itself. We spent a bit more money, but the leak is gone and the transmission fluid stays where it belongs.</p>
<p>But it was without fluid for quite a while, and fluids go into other parts of the system, &#8220;priming the pump,&#8221; as it were, for better operation.</p>
<p>Can we say that my car has made a &#8220;recovery&#8221;? </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>The question keeps rearing its &#8220;ugly&#8221; head as the Jobless Recovery moves forward. Even the Optimists (<a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2011/01/recovery.html">Mark Thoma</a>, <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2011/01/the-end-of-procyclical-labor-productivity.html">Brad DeLong</a>) are hesitating in the face of the evidence*; Thoma&#8217;s graphic at the link just previous notes that the current reovery is not just Jobless, it&#8217;s <em>still</em> Job-Reducing, while DeLong tries to dance a line between &#8220;this time is different, just like the last one&#8221; and &#8220;we&#8217;re going to turn this into Structural Unemployment Any Day Now&#8221; while still thinking of rainbows and kittens.</p>
<p>The strongest evidence that the Recovery has begun is the fiat that NBER declared the recovery to have begun. The second-strongest evidence is that there is noticeable growth in the economy** since the date chosen by NBER.</p>
<p>The following graph appears to support NBER&#8217;s declaration. But note the yellow area.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/TTW80m-1xXI/AAAAAAAAAeA/q8eJmjv9pUk/s1600/peaktroughCapUtil.PNG"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/TTW80m-1xXI/AAAAAAAAAeA/q8eJmjv9pUk/s320/peaktroughCapUtil.PNG" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>If you want to speak of Business Cycles—I don&#8217;t; I consider RBC Theory as its proponents describe it to be the silliness idea this side of phlogiston, but there are those who do, and it&#8217;s a convenient fiction for purposes here—then surely you should speak of a full Cycle. </p>
<p>The return to the level of Capacity Utilization at the end of the previous recession comes not as the recession ends, but four quarters later, a year into the &#8220;recovery.&#8221;***</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s just the Capital side of the equation. Labor is rather more complicated.</p>
<p>It is as if the machine is running again, but has not received a proper tune-up, or any other (&#8220;structural&#8221;) work that needs to return it to peak performance. As John Maudlin <a href="http://www.investorsinsight.com/blogs/thoughts_from_the_frontline/archive/2010/05/22/the-case-for-a-fed-rate-hike.aspx">noted last May</a>, employment rises with income, and income tax receipts were not rising with the &#8220;head-fake&#8221; recovery—&#8221;grass shoots—of that time.</p>
<p>My Subaru used to get around 17-18 mpg (city). Now it&#8217;s closer to 15-16. It would require an investment of capital and labor to get it completely repaired. Being liquidity-constrained, I&#8217;m not going to make that investment until a couple of other things are cleared up—including, but not limited to, the possibility of upgrading to a model built in this century.</p>
<p>Similarly, capital recovery is a slow process, and incremental labor tends to follow that in productive industries. The gap in capacity at the beginning of the &#8220;recovery&#8221; took 12-13 months to be filled. Given that <a href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/149542-jobless-recovery-fasten-your-seatbelts">it took 55 months for the Employment/Population Ratio to recover after the 2001 recession</a> (or <a href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/149542-jobless-recovery-fasten-your-seatbelts">here</a>), it seems not at all unreasonable to expect the current recovery to take 67 or 68 months.</p>
<p>Which would be around January or February of 2015, just after the midterm elections and therefore nearing the end of the first Palin Administration.</p>
<p>It would be rude of me to note that <a href="http://www.nber.org/cycles/cyclesmain.html">the first &#8220;non-recession&#8221; period of the Great Depression lasted only fifty (50) months</a>.  Or that there hasn&#8217;t been a period of growth so long without tax increases since the Vietnam War.</p>
<p>As with my Subaru, some major investment is needed. Whether there will be the liquidity for that to happen in time is left as an exercise.</p>
<p>*Both, in fairness, have declared the current &#8220;recovery&#8221; &#8220;<a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2010/12/economy-still-fragile.html">fragile</a>&#8221; (Thoma) or filled with &#8220;<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22unforced+errors%22+site:delong.typepad.com&#038;hl=en&#038;lr=&#038;tbs=qdr:y&#038;prmd=ivns&#038;filter=0">unforced errors</a>,&#8221; but persist in calling it a recovery.</p>
<p>**Let us sidebar that much of that growth is in the FI part of FIRE. If you have assumed that the lion&#8217;s share of the profits generated by an economy should go to those who are supposed to intermediate, you have to deal with the structure you&#8217;ve got, not one that would produce better, or even optimal, growth.</p>
<p>***The monthly series (MCUMFN; not graphed) reaches and passes the start of the previous recovery in July of 2010. NBER <a href="http://www.nber.org/">official dates the end of the recession to June of 2009</a>, where Capacity Utilization reached its nadir of 65.2. It is perfectly reasonable to say &#8220;a recovery&#8221; began then, but a &#8220;Business Cycle&#8221; that ends with nearly 7% of usable capital (a 9.6% decline in capital terms) sitting vestigial is a poor &#8220;Cycle&#8221; indeed.</p>

We have a better press corps.  It&#8217;s just that they all work for McClatchy.  <a href="http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2011/01/17/v-print/106950/is-health-care-law-really-a-job.html">David Lightman </a>shows how to report that someone is lying without using the word</p>
<blockquote><p>The report says that a study by the National Federation of Independent Business, &#8220;the nation&#8217;s largest small business association, found that an <strong>employer</strong> mandate alone could lead to the elimination of 1.6 million jobs between 2009 and 2014, with 66 percent of those coming from small businesses.&#8221;</p>
<p>[skip]</p>
<p>Michael Steel, a spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said: &#8220;The (NFIB) report analyzes the effect of an <strong>individual</strong> mandate. Obama care includes an <strong>individual</strong> mandate. We make that clear in the report.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>(emphaisis mine)</p>
<p>So Mr Steel asserts that &#8220;employer mandate&#8221; means &#8220;individual mandate.&#8221;  He is lying.  </p>
<p>The whole article is worth reading (and discussed at length after the jump).  Lightman proves at great length that the &#8220;19-page Jan. 6 report, &#8220;ObamaCare: A Budget-Busting, Job-Killing Health Care Law.&#8221;&#8221; is fundamentally fraudulent.</p>
<p>But what of the rest of the US press corps.  If it is true, as I believe, that McClatchy has this reporting business under control, what are the rest of them to do ?  I think they could usefully teach primary school &#8212; certainly they treat their readers and viewwers as children.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>The subject of Steel&#8217;s blatant lie was this absurd assertion in the 19 page report</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8212; The report says that a study by the National Federation of Independent Business, &#8220;the nation&#8217;s largest small business association, found that an employer mandate alone could lead to the elimination of 1.6 million jobs between 2009 and 2014, with 66 percent of those coming from small businesses.&#8221;</p>
<p>But that study was released on Jan. 28, 2009, well before the law was written. It studied a model, not the law that was enacted eventually, and it was based on a different set of assumptions.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s old. We don&#8217;t use it anymore because it was based on a hypothetical mandate,&#8221; NFIB spokeswoman Stephanie Cathcart said. While her group still thinks that the law will hurt business job growth, it cites no firm number.</p></blockquote>
<p>Oh my.</p>
<p>And</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8212; The GOP report says: &#8220;Economic theory suggests the penalty should ultimately be passed through (as) lower wages (to an employee),&#8221; quoting a Congressional Research Service report.</p>
<p>But Republicans chop that sentence short; the CRS version goes on to say that the penalty for not offering coverage &#8220;would not be a burden on small business owners.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Rather an important omission wouldn&#8217;t you say ?</p>
