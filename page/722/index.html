                                <p><a href="http://www6.comcast.net/news/articles/general/2008/01/19/Homeless.on.the.Homefront/">This article</a> found on comcast.net from AP describes a growing problem.</p>
<blockquote><p>For as long as the United States has sent its young men &#8211; and later its young women &#8211; off to war, it has watched as a segment of them come home and lose the battle with their own memories, their own scars, and wind up without homes.<br />The Civil War produced thousands of wandering veterans. Frequently addicted to morphine, they were known as &#8220;tramps,&#8221; searching for jobs and, in many cases, literally still tending their wounds.<br />More than a decade after the end of World War I, the &#8220;Bonus Army&#8221; descended on Washington &#8211; demanding immediate payment on benefits that had been promised to them, but payable years later &#8211; and were routed by the U.S. military.<br />And, most publicly and perhaps most painfully, there was Vietnam: Tens of thousands of war-weary veterans, infamously rejected or forgotten by many of their own fellow citizens.<br />Now it is happening again, in small but growing numbers.<br />For now, about 1,500 veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan have been identified by the Department of Veterans Affairs. About 400 of them have taken part in VA programs designed to target homelessness.<br />The 1,500 are a small, young segment of an estimated 336,000 veterans in the United States who were homeless at some point in 2006, the most recent year for which statistics are available, according to the National Alliance to End Homelessness.<br />Still, advocates for homeless veterans use words like &#8220;surge&#8221; and &#8220;onslaught&#8221; and even &#8220;tsunami&#8221; to describe what could happen in the coming years, as both wars continue and thousands of veterans struggle with post-traumatic stress.<br />People who have studied postwar trauma say there is always a lengthy gap between coming home &#8211; the time of parades and backslaps and &#8220;The Boys Are Back in Town&#8221; on the local FM station &#8211; and the moments of utter darkness that leave some of them homeless.<br />In that time, usually a period of years, some veterans focus on the horrors they saw on the battlefield, or the friends they lost, or why on earth they themselves deserved to come home at all. They self-medicate, develop addictions, spiral down.<br />How &#8211; or perhaps the better question is why &#8211; is this happening again?<br />&#8220;I really wish I could answer that question,&#8221; says Anthony Belcher, an outreach supervisor at New Directions, which conducts monthly sweeps of Skid Row in Los Angeles, identifying homeless veterans and trying to help them get over addictions.<br />&#8220;It&#8217;s the same question I&#8217;ve been asking myself and everyone around me. I&#8217;m like, wait, wait, hold it, we did this before. I don&#8217;t know how our society can allow this to happen again.&#8221;<br />___<br />Mental illness, financial troubles and difficulty in finding affordable housing are generally accepted as the three primary causes of homelessness among veterans, and in the case of Iraq and Afghanistan, the first has raised particular concern.<br />Iraq veterans are less likely to have substance abuse problems but more likely to suffer mental illness, particularly post-traumatic stress, according to the Veterans Administration. And that stress by itself can trigger substance abuse.<br />Some advocates say there are also some factors particular to the Iraq war, like multiple deployments and the proliferation of improvised explosive devices, that could be pulling an early trigger on stress disorders that can lead to homelessness.<br />While many Vietnam veterans began showing manifestations of stress disorders roughly 10 years after returning from the front, Iraq and Afghanistan veterans have shown the signs much earlier.<br />That could also be because stress disorders are much better understood now than they were a generation ago, advocates say.<br />&#8220;There&#8217;s something about going back, and a third and a fourth time, that really aggravates that level of stress,&#8221; said Michael Blecker, executive director of Swords to Plowshares,&#8221; a San Francisco homeless-vet outreach program.<br />&#8220;And being in a situation where you have these IEDs, everywhere&#8217;s a combat zone. There&#8217;s no really safe zone there. I think that all is just a stew for post-traumatic stress disorder.&#8221;<br />Others point to something more difficult to define, something about American culture that &#8211; while celebrating and honoring troops in a very real way upon their homecoming &#8211; ultimately forgets them.<br />This is not necessarily due to deliberate negligence. Perhaps because of the lingering memory of Vietnam, when troops returned from an unpopular war to face open hostility, many Americans have taken care to express support for the troops even as they solidly disapprove of the war in Iraq.<br />But it remains easy for veterans home from Iraq for several years, and teetering on the edge of losing a job or home, to slip into the shadows. And as their troubles mount, they often feel increasingly alienated from friends and family members.<br />&#8220;War changes people,&#8221; says John Driscoll, vice president for operations and programs at the National Coalition for Homeless Veterans. &#8220;Your trust in people is strained. You&#8217;ve been separated from loved ones and friends. The camaraderie between troops is very extreme, and now you feel vulnerable.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/01/ptsd-meta-analysis.html">The meta-analysis on PTSD 2008</a> had one conclusion that there was a paucity of studies done with veterans. One could argue this to some degree, but let me say there have been few studies funded by NIH and the VA that had enough money to be thorough for combat ptsd. More had been done for children, but the false memory people are still being well paid despite losing court battles.</p>
<p>PTSD itself had no publication devoted to it until 1985, so of course the ins and outs of what it is are in its infancy (concerning clinical studies). On the other hand, we know some very basic human needs are involved from a long historical experiment.</p>

                                <p>George Will being <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/01/18/AR2008011802743.html">George Will</a></p>
<blockquote><p>In ABC&#8217;s New Hampshire debate, McCain said: &#8220;Why shouldn&#8217;t we be able to reimport drugs from Canada ?&#8221; A conservative&#8217;s answer is: That amounts to importing Canada&#8217;s price controls, a large step toward a system in which some medicines would be inexpensive but many others &#8212; new pain-relieving, life-extending pharmaceuticals &#8212; would be unavailable.</p></blockquote>
<p>Mr. Will prides himself on being a conservative, so I presume when he writes about a conservative&#8217;s answer, he means his own. </p>
<p>Which means, I guess, that Mr. Will would support preventing Americans from importing or reimporting food from Mexico.  There are price ceilings on a number of products, including tortillas, and the government has muscled the big corn flour producers into keeping prices low, and importing food from Mexico will, in effect, amount to importing Mexico&#8217;s price controls on food.</p>
<p>But Mexico is small potatoes, er, make that small corn.  Last year the Chinese government <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/09/19/business/yuan.php">froze prices</a> on a wide range of goods and services &#8220;including those for land, transport, utilities and fuel.&#8221;  These are all inputs into the stuff Americans buy from China, an in effect put an upper limit on the amount that suppliers of these inputs can charge in the US.  After all, American users of those inputs have to compete with Chinese users of those inputs.  Thus, by Mr. Will&#8217;s logic, allowing Americans to purchase goods from China is equivalent to importing the Chinese system of price controls for land, transport, utilities and fuel.  </p>
<p>Now, maybe you&#8217;re thinking to yourself&#8230; cactus is stretching a point pretty thin here.  We don&#8217;t import electricity from China directly so those price controls matter less than the price controls on something we import directly, like pharmaceuticals.</p>
<p>Which brings me to another post Mr. Will wrote a while back, one that a good liberal can agree with.  <a href="http://www.jewishworldreview.com/cols/will021204.asp">Here</a> Mr. Will rails against market distortions that keep the price of sugar in the US way above the world price.  As he points out&#8230;  this makes American users of sugar uncompetitive and costs jobs in the US.  Are we to assume that Chinese regulations that keep Chinese the price of Chinese inputs low don&#8217;t do the same thing?</p>
<p>Anyway, I personally am not so sure we should put limits (other than those related to health or safety) on the imports of Canadian pharmaceuticals, Mexican food products or Chinese imports in general.  But I don&#8217;t see how Mr. Will can make an argument that Americans shouldn&#8217;t be allowed to import pharmaceuticals from Canada without casting an equally grim eye toward stuff that comes from Mexico and China.</p>

                            </p>
                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Last year, FDI in China rose to $74.7, a marked increase from the $69.5 billion in 2006, so says a <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601080&#038;sid=ahp5vsgikDOE&#038;refer=asia">piece</a> in Bloomberg today.</p>
<p>Some highlights of the article:</p>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Foreign and domestic firms will now be taxed at the same rate (25%). Before this year, foreign firms enjoyed a 15% tax rate; domestic firms endured approximately a 30% tax rate.</li>
<li>The risk is that Vietnam will become more attractive that China: cheaper labor and lower taxes.</li>
<li>Chinese average urban income is a whopping $2875 a year.</li>
</ol>
<p>Tax and labor arbitrage stays healthy, very healthy indeed. A long time ago I said Vietnam may give China a run for its money. Vietnam better hurry up, though. Time&#8217;s a-ticking. And time is money.</p>
<p>And from the The Arizona Republic, of all places, we learn that America is <a href="http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/business/articles/0120biz-Wiles0120.html">for sale</a>.</p>
<p>
<blockquote>Last year, foreigners paid $294 billion for 615 American public companies, according to Standard &#038; Poor&#8217;s Capital IQ research service. That&#8217;s up from 283 deals worth just under $59 billion in 2004.</p></blockquote>
<p>This article is solidly in the conservative camp; after all, that so many are so interested in purchasing U.S. assets must mean that America is very healthy. Now that is an interesting twist.</p>
<p>If you want to have a handle on costs in China, from BigMacs to professorships, here&#8217;s a <a href="http://beijingman.blogspot.com/2008/01/wow-beijing-prices.html">nice site</a>.<br />When companies move elsewhere it usually means that costs are lower. This is a very simple observation, but it seems to elude many people. Those who do get it are of two stripes:</p>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Those who think the solution is to lower taxes here. &#8220;Taxes&#8221; to these people is a very, very nasty word. It&#8217;s a knee-jerk reaction. They can&#8217;t help themselves. </li>
<li>Those who think the solution lies somewhere in our trade policy. &#8220;Taxes&#8221; to these people is not necessarily a nasty word, but they are trying to understand what is happening.</li>
</ol>
<p>Unfortunately, the JGTRRA (Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Relief Act of 2003) did not save us. Look where we are: Selling off America, investing in China and other developing countries. Lowering capital gains again? Not going to work. Lowering other taxes to increase investment? Nope. Despite all we have done, the trade deficit grows. Our debt grows, private and public. One thing we are good at: Spending money.</p>
<p>The America consumer has been fleeced time and time again. But, like the village idiot, he returns if you promise him another candy bar.</p>
<p>What about insisting that currency manipulation is inherently an unfair trade practice? I think so. But what have our politicians done, Democrats and Republicans alike? Every now and then they make a noisey show and then are blissfully quiet.</p>
<p>Rest assured, our FDI investments in third world countries are pulling the strings. Profits. Profits&#8230;the name of the game.</p>
<p>And what has our pride and joy done, our great financial institutions?</p>
<p>Remember when they were touted as la creme de la creme, our savior? America was the financial capital of the world! Alas, they were caught selling a pig in a poke. Many pigs in that poke, as a matter of fact.</p>
<p>Paulson call it &#8220;Innovation,&#8221; very quaint of him, I think. &#8220;Let&#8217;s not over-regulate or insist on transparency,&#8221; our esteemed Secretary in effect said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Careful, boys. Let&#8217;s not get too hasty just because our banks are in trouble, just because they don&#8217;t trust each other.&#8221; Certainly our Secretary hit the nerve that makes the knee jump.</p>
<p>Government: Bad, bad&#8230;.Regulations&#8230;.bad, bad. Reminds me of that South Pacific ditty: &#8220;You&#8217;ve got to be taught&#8230;.&#8221; Well, Americans have been condition to hate taxes, hate regulations&#8230;any regulations, any taxes.  What can I say: It&#8217;s their thing.</p>
<p>Something is amiss and out of place when rats with wings can wear a human face. (Thank you, Roethke.)</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard getting people to see past their noses&#8211;to at least ask the questions about trade and debt.</p>
<p>Tell you what, let&#8217;s keep adding jobs in government, health care, and services even while we lose jobs in manufacturing&#8230;.and call it even. So what if we have nothing to trade.</p>

<blockquote>&#8220;Servers, labourers, and workmen of different kinds make up the far greater part of every great political society. But what improves the circumstances of the greater part can never be regarded as an inconveniency to the whole. No society can be flourishing and happy, of which the far greater part of the members are poor and miserable. It is but equity, besides, that they who feed cloath, and lodge the whole body of the people, should have such a share of the produce of their own labour as to be themselves tolerably well fed, cloathed, and lodged.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>I <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/01/opus-1-discussion-on-taxation.html">left off </a>with a statement which suggested taxation for a progressive purpose, for redistribution purposes is an issue of reason and not mechanics. That is not to say understanding the mechanics is not necessary. Such knowledge however can only be the means to achieve the goal but, not the reason for the goal. Mr. Avi-Yonah sets up his second phase of discussion by quoting Does Atlas Shrug editor Mr. Slemrod:<br />
<blockquote>“ [h]ow much and how to tax high-income individuals are questions at the core of many recent proposals for incremental as well as fundamental tax reform. The right answers depend in part on value judgments to which economic analysis has little to contribute.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let me give a little bit of my philosophy here. A long time ago I figured out that in the end, after all the pros and cons are lined up, the research is done, the discussion had, the reason anyone does anything is because they wanted to do it. Why did I do X? Because that is what I wanted to do &#8211; period.  Decisions are made based on values held at the time of decision not on changing values during the decision.  Secondly, I am only as free as I allow you to be. Before someone starts thinking “libertarian talking here”, I understand that if in my freedom I accumulate enough money such that you have to rent a toilet from me verses buying your own, I&#8217;m not free because now I have to make sure the toilet is always available at the time of your need.  If I don&#8217;t accommodate your timing, then I am at risk of retaliation by you (and maybe a few of your friends).</p>
<p>I have presented in the past that the goal of our economy is defined in the Constitution:<br />
<blockquote>We the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.</p></blockquote>
<p>Specifically but not exclusively “domestic tranquility”, “general welfare” and “posterity”.  An economy has been developed to serve our purpose.  In the crudest terms of economic purpose; to create capital, as in &#8220;a company exists to create profit&#8221;.  But for me, the crude answer begs the question: why create capital?  Because I want to&#8230; because of my values.  I see taxation as how money comes into play in meeting the goals as stated. </p>
<p>Mr Avi-Yonah starts the second part of his argument with a review of other lawyers&#8217; work concerning the question of progressive taxation:<br />
<blockquote>&#8230;Walter Blum and Harry Kalven published a classic article entitled The Uneasy Case for Progressive Taxation. [They] used most of the article to demolish systematically all previous arguments for progressivity made in the name of “ ability to pay” and “ equal sacrifice.” &#8230;they concluded that any remaining case for progressivity must be made in the name of redistribution, or an inherent objection to social inequality,&#8230;This is the same type of “ aesthetic” argument that motivated Henry Simons’s oft- quoted conclusion in Personal Income Taxation (published in 1938 at the height of New Deal progressivism) that sharply graduated rates are defensible only because there is something inherently “ unlovely” about inequality.</p></blockquote>
<p>Next up was the introduction in 1987 by Joseph Bankman and Thomas Griffith of optimal tax theory “developed by economist James Mirrlees”. Mr. Avi-Yonah describes the theory as:<br />
<blockquote>“Optimal tax theory seeks to answer the following question: Given that income taxes generate a disincentive effect on work, what is the ideal tax and transfer system if the ultimate goal is to maximize the sum of the utilities of individuals with identical preferences?</p></blockquote>
<p>As described here, considering the findings suggested in the first post, there is a problem with the assumption. At least as it relates to the tippy top of the earning pile. Googling “optimal taxation theory” will bring up lots of information so I leave more in-depth discussion to you. Surfice-it-to-say, there are issues with the theory when one like Mr. Avi-Yonah is looking for reasoning in support of progressive taxation. He quotes Larry Zelenak and Kemper Moreland:<br />
<blockquote>Regardless of the results of any simulation, optimal tax analysis can never prove that the income tax should have progressive marginal rates. Even if a simulation indicated gradual rates were optimal, and even if the simulation’s factual assumptions were unassailable, an opponent of progression could still dismiss the results by rejecting the philosophical basis of the simulation. If the premises of the simulation are utilitarian or Rawlsian, no amount of sophisticated mathematics will convince someone who objects to those premises.</p></blockquote>
<p>He continues:<br />
<blockquote>Fundamentally, the problem with optimal tax theory is that, like any welfarist theory, it focuses completely on the well-being of individuals.</p></blockquote>
<p>Before we go further, let me introduce you to this paper: <a href="http://www.law.uchicago.edu/Lawecon/WkngPprs_126-150/148.Weisbach-Coase.pdf">Taxes and Torts in the Redistribution </a>of Income by David A. Weisbach, THE LAW SCHOOL THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO</p>
<p>He puts the issue of law vs economics as a bases for redistribution discussion thusly:<br />
<blockquote>
<p>The thesis is that the presence or absence of the tax system completely changes how one thinks about basic subjects.</p>
<p>The reason why this is so is because the tax system plays a central role in the redistribution of income or wealth. In thinking about legal rules, we must ask whether they should be designed to redistribute or whether they should merely be efficient&#8230;Taking these arguments altogether, the double distortion argument and the problems with contracting around and haphazardness, I believe the case against using legal rules to redistribute to the poor becomes almost overwhelming. The tax system is a dedicated system designed to measure the variables relevant to redistribution and act only on those margins. It is hard to imagine that legal rules are likely to do a better job. One key point to note is that I have not argued that legal rules should be efficient. All the argument has shown so far is that legal rules should not be used to redistribute income.</p>
<p>But income is not the only source of inequality. Race, gender, disability, or health all mightbe sources of inequality in our society. If we value equality of all sorts not just income equality, we might want to redistribute based on other sources of inequality.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We are talking 2 different aspects of equality and redistribution as the morality applies to life. One concerns our relationships to each other as individuals exclusive of money. It is nature. It is the place for law. The other concerns our relationship inclusive of money. It is a human added event to nature. Money is based on value which is from our inherent concept of values, but I argue that there is no inherent concept of money. All else being equal, money is the only thing that can create an inequality not found in nature. There is nothing that can substitute for money when trying to equalize the effect of money. This is the place for taxation.  I believe the conflating of these two distinct relationships becomes the means to argue against redistribution/progressive policy related to income. The conflation is in denying that collectively we have agreed on, consequently assigned the properties of money within the scheme of life unlike an event of nature.</p>
<p>Mr. Avi-Yonah leads into his reasoning in support of progressive taxation with:<br />
<blockquote>A society is a community with a shared culture and shared interests that transcend the interests of its individual members and extend back to its historical roots and forward into its future. Thus, it is necessary to look for affirmative reasons for taxing the rich that are rooted in a broader social and historical understanding of the vital function of taxation in maintaining such a community over time.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sounds to me that Mr. Avi-Yonah is talking about the founding ideology manifest in our constitution: We the people&#8230;<br />To be continued&#8230;</p>

<blockquote><p>On one side, according to people familiar with the deliberations, is a powerful group of pragmatists, including <a title="More articles about Henry M. Paulson Jr." href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/p/henry_m_jr_paulson/index.html?inline=nyt-per">Henry M. Paulson Jr.</a>, the treasury secretary; <a title="More articles about Joshua B. Bolten." href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/b/joshua_b_bolten/index.html?inline=nyt-per">Joshua B. Bolten</a>, the White House chief of staff; and Ed Gillespie, counselor to Mr. Bush. They argue that the need for a stimulus is urgent, but have expressed concern that the administration may have to scale back its ambitions for permanent tax cuts to get a package through Congress.<br />On the other side, these people say, are staunch economic conservatives like Keith B. Hennessey, the new director of Mr. Bush’s National Economic Council. They have reservations about the need for an economic rescue package and maintain that if the White House proposes one, it should use the plan as leverage to press lawmakers into making the tax cuts permanent.<br />&#8230;<br />As a whole, the economics team has also drawn criticism for overly optimistic economic predictions. At the end of November, on the same day that <a title="More articles about Ben S. Bernanke" href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/b/ben_s_bernanke/index.html?inline=nyt-per">Ben S. Bernanke</a>, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, hinted strongly that the Fed would lower interest rates to stave off a downturn in the economy, Mr. Paulson and Mr. Lazear offered a rosier economic forecast for 2008.<br />Mr. Lazear predicted “solid growth,” and Mr. Paulson said the economy remained “broadly healthy,” while adding, “I expect the expansion to continue.”<br />On Tuesday, Mr. Lazear defended those predictions, saying they were in keeping with what most economists believed at the time. But he also said that the economic team had known since August, when the housing crisis grew especially acute, that it might have to consider an economic rescue package.</p></blockquote>
<p>Things seem to change really quickly. Too bad none knew what was coming in order to better plan a stimulus package. [sarcasm off]</p>

                                <p>Its been pointed out time and again that the real incomes of the middle class have not exactly done that well in the past few decades.  Among the counter-arguments provided by the right is the notion technology is improving and people can now buy stuff they couldn&#8217;t a bit more than a decade ago.  As <a href="http://meganmcardle.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/01/those_were_the_good_old_days.php">Megan McArdle puts it</a>, this improvement in the technology the middle class can buy provides &#8220;something of a challenge to the notion that middle class incomes have gone nowhere for the last ten years.&#8221;</p>
<p>Oh really?  Well, all of that reminds me of a little story.  In December of 1921, the Soviet Government approved the <a rhef="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GOELRO_plan">GOELRO plan</a>,  the prototype of Soviet Five Year plans.  The USSR was in shambles, but the plan was ambitious&#8230; to electrify large chunks of the country and catapult it out of 17th, or maybe 18th century where it was mired.  <a href="http://www.mosenergo.ru/eng/index.php?id=8">By the mid 1930s things had changed dramatically</a> and &#8220;the country ranked second in Europe and third globally in terms of electricity output.&#8221;</p>
<p>So&#8230; there&#8217;s a ten year period of explosive growth, at the end of which a huge number of people who ten years earlier probably had never even heard of electricity had it in their lives.  Does anyone think that&#8217;s a smaller change in technology than what the American middle class has seen in the past decade or so?  And are we to conclude this is a sign that life was good for most citizens of the USSR?  Because frankly, that&#8217;s not an assumption I&#8217;m willing to make.  But I don&#8217;t see how its any different than saying that because the average American today has a cellphone that is more compact, has better reception, and has more features than whatever Bill Gates was carrying around with him ten years ago, we have to conclude that the American middle class is rockin&#8217; and rollin&#8217; right about now.</p>

                                <p>Most stimulus packages&#8211;particularly those that are just handouts or temporary tax cuts&#8211;make even more private debt public. And, as we know, the government is already deep in hock, financed primarily by official inflows, i.e., foreign central banks. All pipers must, at some point, be paid. At some point, those foreign banks must be paid. Inflation is not a solution. At the core of all our problems lie the twin deficits.</p>
<p>As U.S. assets cheapen or experience trouble, buyers (often SWF&#8217;s) will be more than ready to snap up them up. After all is said and done, we are selling off America.</p>
<p>Now, I am not arguing against a temporary stimulus package, but we must think further than just giving the junkie one more&#8211;maybe his last&#8211;shot in the arm. In short, merely priming the consumer for one more run at the punch bowl is a bit short-sighted. We must think deeper than that. We must look at root causes. Here is my list:</p>
<h2>Nationally</h2>
<p>Preamble: I obviously am in favor of a larger government role in many areas. Privatization of everything has been a disaster. Deregulation and no forceful governmental oversight has failed. Financial &#8220;innovation&#8221; without transparency and no real governmental oversight has created this mess.
<ol type="1">
<li>Universal health care: Single payer, government run. Everyone pays. Insurance companies can deal with dental and optional surgery&#8230;stuff like that. Government sets the cost of procedures, plain and simple. Without universal health care, our businesses cannot compete; our citizenry is constantly at risk.</li>
<li>Education: Make it affordable. As Juan said in an earlier thread: Bust or knock down tuitions. The government can do this. Check out how Canada does it, if you need help.</li>
<li>Regulation: One of the first duties of government. Without proper regulation, there is no real commerce, no effective financial institutions. In our celebration of free markets, we have forgotten one of the duties of government: Protection from the unscrupulous and the short-sighted. Regulate financial institutions, commodity traders, hedge funds&#8230;etc. Right now there is absolutely no transparency in our financial institutions. Beef up the rules, beef up the number of examiners. Insist on public transparency. No more Enrons, no more Merril Lynches.</li>
<li>Taxes. Tax the rich. Roll back the so-called relief on &#8220;death taxes,&#8221; capital gains and the very, very wealthy. Time for the billionaires to pay a higher rate than a janitor or a teacher. Trickle down does not work. Investment in the in the U.S. has not been forthcoming. All we have done is to create an every more wealthy one percent. If Buffet and Gates can favor the estate tax, that should tell us something. The vast flow of monies to just the wealthy must be stopped.</li>
<li>Alternate energy sources. Treat the twin problems of energy independence and global warming and pollution like a Manhattan project. No more dilly dallying around.</li>
<li>Sovereign Wealth Funds: Start thinking about SWF&#8217;s and their growing power. Remember who has them, who really owns them. How are we going to deal with them. Big, big question. Some of the suggestions I mention below will begin to address that issue.</li>
<li>Lobbyists: Cut the umbilical cord between lobbyists and the government. Ex-elected officials or the ex-military cannot become lobbyists. Sorry, Bill, Kissinger, et al. Give the government back to the people. Elected office should be an honor and an act of patriotism, a self-less act of service to one&#8217;s country, not a way to feather one&#8217;s future nest. (I wonder if Brown with follow Blair&#8217;s lead and become a lobbyist? Seems to be the &#8220;thing to do&#8221; in many western democracies. Frankly, with the well-oiled revolving door, all we are creating is an over-class that merely serves itself. Father-son, husband-wife, general/father-son (fill in the names&#8230;isn&#8217;t there something sick about this? Nepotism, here we come. I want my leaders to die poor or middle class or at least with honor, not be a step-stone for the son to become president or the head of the FCC, or their wife to become president. Do we want a political aristocracy? Hail, Truman, damn good fellow.</li>
<li>Middle East policy: It needs a complete overhaul: The neoconservative plan to shake up the Middle East and create democracies has been an unmitigated failure. After a trillion dollars, all we are trying to do now is stabilize the mess we made in Iraq. Shock and Awe has turned into a whimper, revealing America&#8217;s inability to use military might as an extension of its policy goals. Meanwhile, neoconservatives are now eyeing Iran as the next target. Yet we lovingly hold the hands of our Islamic &#8220;friends&#8221; in the area, four or five families with unimaginable wealth, running brutal theocratic enterprises.
<ol type="a">
<li>Iraq: Get out of Iraq. Not worth a trillion bucks. Forget about Iran. The Arabs will take decades to sort it all out. Believe me, they will argue and bicker till the cows come home. Kurds, Islamists of all stripes&#8230;factions beyond counting. We forget how dynamic and changing countries can be if left to their own devices. Stop propping up dictators. All we do is anger the oppressed and create very dangerous adversaries.</li>
<li>Israel: Rethink our position vis-a-vis Israel. Insist that Israel talk to its enemies; no more &#8220;pre-conditions.&#8221; (As a side note, under Bill Clinton, Israel increased its occupation more than it did under Bush.) It is time we think through our real priorities in the Middle East; our priorities may not be those of Israel. Frankly, I am tired of the likes of Leiberman who thinks that Israel&#8217;s objectives should be ours.
<p>Our Middle East policy will shift if we begin a Manhattan-like project for energy independence. We can do it.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p></li>
<li>The Media: My complaints here are too numerous to mention. News? What news? For starters, we have to stop media consolidation. Without many voices, democracy is in fact dead. Right now the news is just freak side-show with the same talking heads. One liberal commentator had the stupidity of saying that Obama&#8217;s health care plan was no different from that of Edwards&#8217; plan. No one challenged him. Hell, no one in the room had any idea of how the two health care plans differed! Why not allow spokesmen for both plans give their pitch? The role of the newscaster is simply to tease out the specifics&#8211;without comment or preference. We have forgotten what news really is. Just a mess. As a side note: What would happen if we outlawed polls? More I think about it, the more I like it. Imagine: No more &#8220;which horse is ahead.&#8221; Maybe we would have to concentrate of the issues and the positions. For example, most candidates have positions on global warming. Have you ever, ever heard one of those positions discussed or laid bare on national t.v.? Gasp. Now, not everyone is as free as the group here is of actually looking for the position papers. Most people do not have the time or the energy. They are simply trying to survive. Imagine what would happen if the news actually covered these kinds of issues, dispassionately, objectively. The news now is just a joke, a &#8220;ratings&#8221; race, filled with trumpets and loud music.<br />
<h2>Globally</h2>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Currency manipulation: Immediately take the issue of the dollar peg (China, Saudi Arabia, etc) to the WTO. No more need be said.</li>
<li>Labor: Stop its Exploitation: Bring the issue of labor to the WTO. China&#8217;s sweat shops must stop. All WTO countries must allow collective bargaining&#8211;not state controlled bargaining as in China. All WTO countries must have and must enforce regulations protecting labor. If we do not forcefully address the issue of labor rights, then our labor force is toast. In short, the WTO has to change its rules. No easy task. But it is time to step up to the plate and say, do something.</li>
<li>Trade: Roll back NAFTA. It has been a disaster for the U.S. and Mexico. It is just a corporate give-away. No more fast-track trade deals. The only people who pay attention to the details are those who will make the bucks. Economists simply are simply starry-eyed children when they talk about trade deals. Insist on labor&#8217;s rights and environmental protection in all trade deals. In a country does not protect its labor force, i.e., does not allow collective bargaining and worker protection, then no trade deal.</li>
<li>WTO: Change it or end it. Globalization as practiced is a disaster, creating ever more serious disllocations. As an overseer of globalization, the WTO is a failure. In failing to insist on labor&#8217;s rights and on environmental regulations as a precondition for entry, the WTO is a poor global citizen, protecting only corporate profits. The fact that the latest round is stalled should tell us something.</li>
<li>Global Warming and pollution: America should take the lead in the fight against global warming and pollution. Take a stand. Clean up our own house; and insist that others do the same. Simple policy. Direct.
