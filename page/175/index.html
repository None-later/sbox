<blockquote>In the IBM PC era, Steve drove innovation forward with the Macintosh. This, like the Apple II, was squarely aimed at expanding the use of PCs to everyone, the &#8220;computer for the rest of us.&#8221; Everyone now knows that this was innovating too fast, and that cheaper, duller IBM machines running Microsoft’s dull clone of an earlier operating system would become the standard. But do you know how Steve changed when he realized that &#8220;the rest of us&#8221; were not going to buy the Mac? He learned that the most important early customers for Macs were corporate marketing departments (those graphics!) and worked hard to create, as he told me not long after, &#8220;the best computer company for those corporate marketers we can.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

                                <p>Your intrepid if somewhat tardy correspondent confirms <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/protesters-in-europe-march-against-corporate-greed-as-occupy-wall-street-protests-go-global/2011/10/15/gIQANP51lL_story.html?hpid=z1">the number one story at www.washingtonpost.com</a>.  The OWS demonstration in Rome provided cover for people who like to smash and burn things (the black block).  This is the line of Rome&#8217;s right wing mayor and the right wing minister of the interior.</p>
<p>Being late, as usual, I missed the demonstration and the violence, but I do have photos of the damage and a spent tear gas canister.</p>
<p>update: I went to Pzza San Giovanni to demonstrate but got there when more punctual demonstrators were already leaving. <br />Also typo corrected.</p>
<p>update II: In my post and in my comment I spoke ironically of the left&#8217;s standard line that the vandals were infiltrators and clearly separate from decent protesters like us (note I am a member of the left and was mocking myself).  However, the evidence is very strong that the smashers and burners were clearly a different group than the mass of ordinary protesters.  You should note I didn&#8217;t say &#8220;nonviolent protesters&#8221; as it seems that some ordinary protesters used violence, against the black block vandals </p>
<p><a href="http://www.repubblica.it/politica/2011/10/16/news/errori_polizia-23310861/?ref=HREA-1">&#8220;quella cinquantina di &#8220;neri&#8221; che, per altro, il corteo ha isolato e, in qualche caso, anche aggredito a bottigliate.&#8221; &#8212; Carlo Bonini</a>  that is &#8220;those 50 or so black clad hooligans who, by the way, the crowd isolated and, in a few cases, attacked with thrown bottles.&#8221;  As I reported last night, I missed the action (late as usual) but video shows the same all black costumes, covered faces and helmets as the gangs which did massive property damage in Genoa during a G-8 meeting some years ago.  It&#8217;s hard to figure out what these guys think they are doing, but their symbol is the A in a circle of punk/anarchy not the hammer and sickle which is still the symbol of the Italian far left.</p>
<p>Needless to say Carlo Bonini doesn&#8217;t claim that all the damage was done by 50 or so hooligans (they would have to be super hooligans).  His line is that not so hard core violent kids joined in the fun.  He is a very leading Italian investigative journalist.  He is also not so slightly left of center and clearly determined to blame the police/caribinieri &#8212; in this case for being soft on anarcho-hooliganism.  But his claims of fact are reliable and confirmed by video.</p>

With Wall Street at the center of the 2008 economic collapse, the committee should look to a pair of revenue options that would fulfill the dual roles of addressing risks to the economy posed by Wall Street and raising much needed revenue: a financial speculation tax and a financial crisis responsibility fee on large financial institutions. </p>

                                <p>The Italian prime minister just won a vote of confidence in Parliament.  It surprises almost no one who lives in Italy that investors weren&#8217;t pleased.  <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/markets/italys-berlusconi-faces-confidence-vote-that-could-end-his-2-decade-long-political-run/2011/10/14/gIQAxWOOjL_story.html?hpid=z1">The associated Press has a great quote </a></p>
<blockquote><p>The best signal that Italy could have sent to the markets would have been to boot Mr. Berlusconi out, but it has failed to do so, said Sony Kapoor, managing director of Re-Define an Economic Think Tank. </p></blockquote>
<p>I promise you that this is a widespread although not universal view.</p>
<p>But the associated Press reporter just can&#8217;t face the fact that Berlusconi is &#8220;worse than you imagine possible even taking into account the fact that [he] is worse than you imagine possible&#8221; &#8212; Brad DeLong. That reporter describes his actions using the standard forms of political reporting (more rigid than a sonnet).  This causes the reporter(s) to make a plainly false claim </p>
<p>&#8220;Italy is under pressure to come up with growth-promoting measures to avert being dragged into the widening European sovereign debt crisis.&#8221;</p>
<p>The opposite is true.  Italy is under pressure to come up with deficit cutting measures which will slow growth but might allow Italy to escape from the widening European sovereign debt crisis.</p>
<p>The European policy debate is austerity vs stimulus.  Berlusconi is on both sides.  He has recently had parliament pass ruthless ruthless austerity measures which are, it pains me to say this, necessary* with investors demanding a risk premium of roughly 4%.  But he also wants a stimulus bill.  Because he has no understanding of limits or of the distinction between words and facts.  His logic is if he wants growth then he wants a growth bill, that is &#8220;svilupo&#8221; which literally means development, but in practice means huge public construction contracts.</p>
<p>You will note that I didn&#8217;t quote Brad DeLong word for word.  The reason is that he wrote about the Bush administration and it makes no sense to write about the Berlusconi government, because the second most important member of the cabinet &#8212; economy minister Giulio Tremonti &#8212; absolutely opposes Berlusconi&#8217;s policy proposals.<br />A crisis in the cabinet just doesn&#8217;t fit the normal forms of political reporting (which is unsuited to Italy and Israel and &#8230; other countries with names beginning with I).</p>
<p>It is also important that while both austerity and stimulus are on the agenda, they tie for second place after the perenial number one priority of changing laws so that Berlusconi isn&#8217;t sent to jail.  I do mean this quite literally and am subject to criminal liability if I can&#8217;t prove my claim (it would be calumny and those of you who really have freedom of speech shouldn&#8217;t imagine that it really is protected here).</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>* It especially pains me to agree with Giulio Tremonti who makes Andrew Mellon look like a pinko softy (and also &#8212; relatively speaking &#8212; a stud muffin).  His odd title minister for the economy is based on the obsolete Italian tradition of inflating the cabinet as well as the currency.  Back when there were 5 coalition parties, it was necessary to divide up the position which would be held by the treasury minister in a normal country into three slices.  The minister of the Treasury who controlled spending, minister of finance who collected revenues and the minister of the balance who kept watch on the two dangerous intellectuals (and carried the kidney from table to table).  At least that nonsense is over.  Tremonti has all three offices (in the same building where no cocaine pushers have entered for oh years now).</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Reuters posted (and has since updated) an article on alleged financial connections between George Soros and Occupy Wall Street (OWS).  The article illustrates much of what is wrong with English language journalism.</p>
<p>Felix Salmon wrote a devastating critique <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2011/10/13/on-george-soros-occupy-wall-street-and-reuters/#comment-31832">(just click the link and read it)</a></p>
<p>Felix Salmon works for Reuters.  To me the news is that someone somewhere is willing to publicly criticize his employer without flinching or trying to find excuses.  </p>
<p>I even suspect that Salmon&#8217;s post had an effect on the News division of Thomson/Reuters, since the headline of the article has been changed</p>
<blockquote><p>Update: After a rather confusing series of events, the old version of the story is still online, while a recast version is here. Both of them now carry the headline “Soros: not a funder of Wall Street protests”. Which is an improvement.</p></blockquote>
<p>My boring commentary after the jump.  Up here I just want to conclude that I think the world would be a much better place if more people were like Felix Salmon </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Also Ken Houghton but uh the point is willingness to criticize other members of the same organisation so I can&#8217;t type that above the jump.</p>
<p>So what went wrong wrong wrong in the Reuters article ?  The first thing is that they let Rush Limbaugh act as their assignment editor.  An article discussing whether Soros is financing OWS is damaging to OWS even if it reaches a firm conclusion. </p>
<p>The article clearly states the principle that loud hacks should be able to make Reuters write about their assertions &#8220;There has been much speculation over who is financing the disparate protest, which has spread to cities across America and lasted nearly four weeks. &#8221;  </p>
<p>Salmon wrote &#8220;Yes, there are people — led, it would seem, by Rush Limbaugh — who are loudly speculating that Soros is funding OWS.&#8221;  He is guessing about the role of Limbaugh (a very safe guess but a guess).  In any case it is clear that the right wing noise machine can get reporters as supposedly neutral journalistic enterprises to address their claims.  That&#8217;s enough.  &#8220;Opinions on Soros financing of OWS differ&#8221; is the message the busy public will get.</p>
<p>Then the article claims a connection because Soros gave money to the Tides foundation which gave money to some group in Canada which, years later, had a role in starting OWS.  The point is that questions of fact are never purely black or purely white.  There is always something (almost always more than this).  So once the question is raised it is never declared settled by reporters.  They aren&#8217;t supposed to draw conclusions on controversial issues.  So the main thing they do is decide on which controversial claims to report (along with denials and rebuttals and all that).  </p>
<p>This tiny battle seems to have been won by the believers that the facts should matter &#8212; that it isn&#8217;t enough to report both sides of a debate when one side has reckless disregard for the truth. </p>
<p>But it isn&#8217;t Reuters policy that one should investigate inflamatory claims and, if there is only the tiniest bit of evidence that there is arguably a shred of truth to the claims, not file an article.  I think the problem is that there is reporters are given a incentive not to conclude that there is nothing there and the best article is no article at all.  The bits on the internet are the same as they would be if the reporter had done no work.  But for editors to do their job, they should consider a brief report (to them only) that there is essentially nothing there to be better than an article which focuses on the trivial bit that is there.  But they don&#8217;t.  They have trees to kill.</p>
<p>Also the reporter(s) (not named by Salmon so I won&#8217;t either) seem to be Republican hacks.  But a good organization should not be vulnerable to a few bad apples.</p>

<p><strong>Barney Frank and the need for a risk-based bank fee </strong>
<p>That post about the McCain-Paul environmental devastation and revenue decimation bill (somehow mistakenly given the label of a &#8220;jobs bill&#8221; by the misguided pair ) suggests the unprecedented extent to which our Congressional reps now believe they can use and abuse national resources for the benefit of crony capitalism.</p>
<p>At least there still seem to be some who are interested in directing their firepower at those who have caused the recession and job losses and whose activities could well cause further harm.  Barney Frank has written a letter to the so-called &#8216;supercommittee&#8217; asking that they include  the risk-based bank fee assessible against &#8216;too big to fail&#8217; banks as part of the deficit reduction package.  See <a href="http://www.democraticleader.gov/pdf/FinancialServices101311.pdf">Letter</a>.  Given that the very existence of too big to fail banks implies that the government will again have to come to their aid, it seems entirely appropriate to have these banks pay into the Treasury to recognize the guarantee they are being provided.  Further, banks have made good profits since the crisis because of their ability to borrow money extraordinarily cheaply from the Fed, and they have nonetheless continued to demand fairly steep returns for their lending and other activities.  Having them return part of that largesse through a risk-based fee is a reasonable approach that should also help to discourage the excessive speculative risk-taking in which they engaged.</p>

<p>SOCIAL SECURITY:</p>
<p>IT’S JUST MATH</p>
<p>or how to lie with numbers</p>
<p>&#8220;Math doesn&#8217;t lie&#8221; seems to be the new focus group tested mantra  about Social Security that Congressmen and their journalists are so proud to repeat.  What it really means is &#8220;we put a lot of money into finding ways to make the numbers sound big enough to scare the children.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here is a recent example, which I found in  <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/intelligence_squared/2011/09/stop_obsessing_over_entitlement_reform.single.html">http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/intelligence_squared/2011/09/stop_obsessing_over_entitlement_reform.single.html</a></p>
<p>&#8220;Slate:Of course, old people today are no longer poor because of Social Security. But recently, GOP presidential contender and Texas Gov. Rick Perry called it a &#8220;Ponzi scheme.&#8221; And last month, the economist Laurence Kotlikoff said this in an interview with NPR: &#8220;We&#8217;ve got 78 million baby boomers who are poised to collect, in about 15 to 20 years, about $40,000 per person. Multiply 78 million by $40,000–you&#8217;re talking about more than $3 trillion a year just to give to a portion of the population. That&#8217;s an enormous bill overhanging our heads, and Congress isn&#8217;t focused on it.&#8221; But you&#8217;ve written that Social Security will be only a small contributor to the future budget gap. Are Kotlikoff&#8217;s worries unfounded?</p>

<p>A look at the 2011 Trustees Report Table IV.B2  shows that, sure enough, in 2025 there will be about 78 million beneficiaries to OASDI.    To find the &#8220;$40,000 per person&#8221; is not so easy.  Look at Table VI.F7, Cost of OASDI (“Social Security”) in 2025 will be $1213 Billion, not 3 Trillion, for a per person cost of about $15,551 in “constant 2011 dollars” , not  $40,000.  Hmmm, maybe he means “current dollars, that is inflated dollars.  Well, table VI.F8 gives  $1626 Billion for 2025, still not $ 3 Trillion, or $40,000 per person.  </p>
<p>Wait, maybe he is talking about Social Security PLUS Medicare (HI).  Getting closer. Table VI.F9 gives the combined cost for OASDI AND HI, in current (inflated) dollars as $ 2237 Billion.  Not 3 Trillion. Not $40,000 per person.</p>
<p>So where does Kotlikoff get his scary numbers?  Perhaps from the (Table VI.F9) “High Cost” estimate for 2025, in current dollars,for Social Security plus Medicare, of $ 2737 Billion. Close enough, if you don’t mind rounding up by 10%.</p>
<p>It is not honest to start out by talking about Social Security, then skip to talking about (mumble) “socialsecurityplusmedicare” without bothering to mention that you have done so, or pointing out that Medicare is a very different kind of problem than Social Security. And it is not honest to use a “high cost” estimate which even the Trustees regard as “unlikely,” without even mentioning that that’s what you are doing.  Nor is it honest to talk about inflated dollars without telling people that’s what you are doing and giving them a basis for understanding what the numbers mean in terms of the money they have in their wallet today.</p>
<p>Table VI.F4 gives GDP in current dollars for 2025 as $ 30 Trillion dollars. And the combined “high cost estimate” for the combined costs of Social Security and Medicare as 8.96% of that.  Table VI.F4 gives the intermediate (most likely) estimate of the combined cost of Social Security and Medicare to be 7.66% of GDP. </p>
<p>But even staying with Kotlikoff’s misleading estimate, a “high cost” estimate of feeding and housing, and basic medical care, for 78 million people, over a quarter of the adult population, may reach 10% of GDP.</p>
<p>Kotlikoff is pretty sure this is an “enormous bill overhanging our heads”&#8230;.”just to give to a portion of the population.”</p>
<p>But “we” are not giving it to them.  They will have paid for it.  </p>
<p>And every one of us will one day be in that “portion of the population.”  Kotlikoff appears to be suggesting we just ask old people to step out into the blizzard, so “we” don’t have to pay for “them.” </p>
<p>But “we” will be paying for ourselves&#8230;  just in case, you know, we don’t want to go into the blizzard. “We” are “them.”</p>
<p>With pay as you go financing “we” pay for our future benefits over a forty year period, an average of 30 years before we will need to collect. This is no different than “saving” the money.  Because of inflation people cannot afford to just put the money under the mattress.  Before Social Security they would take it to a bank and hope the bank would pay it back, with enough interest to stay ahead of inflation.  Or they would “invest” their money in hopes of getting back more than they paid in by taking advantage of the growth in the economy.  The  success of this would depend upon picking the right investment on the right day.</p>
<p>Social Security avoids both the risk of inflation, and the risks of investments that go bad at the worst possible time.  By using your money to pay back the people who paid for their Social Security before you, they are able to pay those people with money that is worth more than the money the older people paid in.  This is very simple:  Those older people paid a tax on an income that was a lot smaller than yours.  You pay the same tax on a larger income. This makes more money available to pay the benefits due to the older people.</p>
<p>This is effectively the same as “interest”, and because it comes from the growth of the whole economy it is not subject to the same risk as individual investments.  And because it is paid in “current” dollars, it always keeps up with inflation.</p>
<p>And when it’s your turn to retire, you will get the same advantage the older generation got.  And when your children retire, they will get the same advantage you got.  And so on, forever.</p>
<p>But please note, it is YOU paying for your own retirement.  It is NOT you paying for granny.  She already paid for her own retirement.  </p>
<p>Don’t be confused by the pay as you go feature.  It is really not different from what happens when you put your money in the bank or buy stocks and bonds.</p>
<p>Your money goes, the same day you deposited it, right out the door to pay for the current uses of some other person.  And when you are ready to cash out your savings, or stocks and bonds, the money would come in the door, that very day, from some other person, presumably someone looking for a safe place to save for his retirement.</p>
<p>To get a more honest picture than the one Kotlikoff is trying to scare you with,  look at Table VI.F7,  and see that the intermediate (best guess) cost of OASDI in 2025 is projected to be $ 1212.8 Billion in &#8220;constant 2011 dollars&#8221;&#8230; dollars worth as much as the dollars in your wallet today.   Divide $1212.8 Billion by 78 million and you get $15,549 per beneficiary.  </p>
<p>Table VI.F2 says this is 15.67% of “taxable income.  The same line gives the SS income rate  as 13.15%.  This is the amount of money available to pay the benefits. It comes from the current payroll tax rate of 12.4%  and additional income&#8230; mostly a part of the income tax that IRS collected on income from benefits and kicks back to SS. This means a tax increase of about 2.5% (15.7 &#8211; 13.2) would be needed to close the gap.  </p>
<p>The best way to increase the tax this much by the year 2025 would be to raise the payroll tax about one tenth of one percent per year for each the boss and the worker.</p>
<p>But it turns out the need for the raise has long been anticipated and the workers have been “saving up for it” by paying a tax rate higher than needed for the usual pay as you go.  This gives SS a savings account (the Trust Fund) to draw on to ease the transition to the higher tax rate. The Trust Fund will still have about  2.6 Trillion dollars in it by 2025, helping to pay the increased costs (Table VI.F7).  </p>
<p>We could just let the Trust Fund make up the difference between the tax rate and the cost rate, but this would not be prudent.  It turns out that a gradual increase in the tax rate of ONE FOURTH  of one tenth of one percent per year for each the boss and the worker will keep Social Security “solvent” forever. This is about 20 cents per week per year for each. </p>
<p>Actually no increase at all would be needed to  keep Social Security “solvent.”  The increase suggested here is what it would take to maintain the current “replacement rate”.. that is the percent of your pre-retirement earnings that you collect from Social Security on a monthly basis, AND retire at the same age as current retirees.   It’s pretty certain you would want to do both of those things, and as we have seen, the cost is not even high enough to notice.</p>
<p>While your tax is going up one quarter of one tenth of one percent per year, your income is projected to go up over one full percent per year.  That means, essentially, that each year your tax is twenty cents more per week (forty cents if you are your own boss) and your income is 8 dollars per week more than it was last year.  Leaving you with MORE money every week than you had before, PLUS having paid for a longer, richer, secure retirement.</p>
<p>So Kotlikoff’s 3 Trillion dollar “enormous bill hanging over our heads,” just to “give” to a “part” of the population (you) turns out to be a need to raise your own tax&#8230; really your own savings&#8230; less than a tenth of a percent per year over the time between now and then.</p>
<p>Remember this is your own money.  Not “the government’s.”  It’s not welfare.  You pay for your own retirement.  There is no deficit or debt.  Just a need to pay for what YOU will need. And it won’t cost enough to even notice.</p>
<p>It’s just math.</p>
<p>[note&#8230;</p>
<p>The numbers I give above are for OASDI, Social Security proper, not Medicare, because Medicare’s problems are best addressed by controlling medical costs (not by cutting benefits).</p>
<p>But even if costs can’t be controlled,  we may decide we want to pay for the medical care anyway.  The cost of this would be about a fourth of the cost of Social Security.  So the same logic applies. Instead of raising your tax 40 cents per week each year, you might have to raise it 50 cents per week each year.  You are still going to have more money after paying the tax than you have today.  And you will still be paying, in advance, for your own needs&#8230;  not some other “portion of the population.”]</p>

<p><strong>Senators Levin and Isakson: millionaire surtax vs corporate repatriation subsidy </strong>
<p>The PBS News Hour last night interviewed Senators Levin and Isakson on the jobs bill (video and transcript available <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/politics/july-dec11/jobsbill_10-11.html">here</a>).</p>
<p>Isakson was first off.  He sounded like a right wing sound bite machine: we&#8217;re overregulating businesses so we need a &#8220;time out&#8221; on regulation.  And we need to pass a repatriation tax holiday so businesses can get the money they need to invest and create jobs.</p>
<p>Levin was asked what he thought about that.  He didn&#8217;t even comment on the repatriation sound-bite&#8211;after all, he has a report just out that investigates the idea of repatriation and concludes it was a losing proposition.   See  <a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2011/10/at%20http://levin.senate.gov/download/repatriating-offshore-funds">Repatriating Offshore Funds: 2004 Tax Windfall for Select Multinationals</a>, Permanent Committee on Investigations Majority Staff Report, Senate (Oct. 11, 2011) (listing a series of findings showing that repatriation failed to accomplish its goals).**</p>
<p>But Levin did respond to the &#8220;it&#8217;s regulations and taxes that are killing job creation&#8221; GOP mantra.  A recent poll of small business owners showed that small business owners aren&#8217;t worried about regulations or taxes.  They just need customers.   So you can help things out by helping small businesses and helping people become customers. </p>
<p> <a name="more"></a>
<p>Makes sense, doesn&#8217;t it?  It&#8217;s certainly an argument made here on ataxingmatter many times: the way to create customers is to stop the collapse of the American middle class with programs like infrastructure projects.</p>
<p>Woodruff then asked Isakson what he had to say to that.  His response&#8211;yeah, well, the vote we have tonight is the pay-for&#8211;a surtax on millionaires.  And there are 392,000 small businesses that a surtax on millionaires is going to hurt.</p>
<p>So now Woodruff asks Levin what about this argument that the surtax is gonna hurt small businesses.</p>
<p>Levin set the facts straight on his colleague&#8217;s claim that a surtax on millionaires would hurt all those small businesses.  He said quite clearly that the facts show that only a very small percentage of small business owners earn the million that would put them in the group subject to the surtax.  So the issue is taxing millionaires, whose share of the income has skyrocketed in the last few years compared to the middle class, which has stagnated.  The surtax would mainly hit the overpaid CEOs of big corporations, etc.</p>
<p>Funny, Judy Woodruff (an undergraduate classmate of mine back at Duke, by the way) didn&#8217;t blink an eye.  You&#8217;d think the next question to Isakson would be&#8211;given the fact that only a tiny proportion of small businesses would be subject to the millionaire surtax, Senator, a fact that has been pointed out numerous times, why do you insist on claiming that it would hurt all small businesses.  But she didn&#8217;t.  The PBS station is worried about appearing &#8220;balanced&#8221; and that means you can&#8217;t call a fact a fact and point out that a presenter is stating something that isn&#8217;t supported in the facts.  You let an interviewee do it, if they can get it in, but you let the other side get by with continuing to repeat its fact-less sound bites. </p>
<p>So Senator Isakson&#8217;s response was:</p>
<p>[Senator Levin&#8217;s] response to that question just proves this is all about political messaging and really doesn&#8217;t have anything to do with purpose, because if they really cared about small business, they would exempt limited liability corporations, S-corporations and sole proprietorships from the application of this tax. Then they&#8217;d only be taxing millionaires. But they&#8217;re going after small business as well.\</p>
<p> Now, folks, that&#8217;s a ridiculous response.  (Woodruff didn&#8217;t say that, but I will.)  It&#8217;s ridiculous because Levin gave the facts&#8211;small businesses don&#8217;t complain about regulations, most small businesses don&#8217;t make millions and wouldn&#8217;t be subject to the surtax.  And Isakson had the gall to call that factual response &#8220;political messaging&#8221; , even while Isakson continued with his GOP soundbite political message campaign of implying that small businesses need to be protected from the millionaires surtax! </p>
<p>Note also that Isakson suggested that tif there had to be a surtax, it should exempt LLCs, S corporations and sole proprietorships.  He offered no justification whatsoever for that terribly broad exemption (other than the proffered &#8220;it&#8217;ll hurt small businesses that Levin already soundly defeated).  If you&#8217;re making millions from your business, you are successful enough to pay the tax.  If you are not, you won&#8217;t have to pay the tax.  If you exempt LLCs (mostly operated as partnerships) and S corporations and sole proprietorships, you are exempting a lot more than small businesses!  Those include hedge and private equity funds (some managers of which make hundreds of millions a year), real estate partnerships, huge businesses operating as sole proprietorships, and  people like John Edwards who make millions through their S corporations etc. etc. etc.  If you couple that with the zero taxation on capital gains that most on the right are pushing for, that&#8217;d likely mean that the CEOs of multinational corporations would be the ONLY millionaires and gazillionaires that the tax would hit! </p>
<p> But did Judy follow up along those lines?  Nope.  Instead she asked Isakson whether the country doesn&#8217;t need stimulus rather than cutting at this fragile time for the economy.</p>
<p>His response was to deliver the right wing political message yet again: </p>
<p>1.  <strong>the right&#8217;s response to the fact that the last stimulus made a huge difference&#8211;a claim that it didn&#8217;t solve tthe problem permanently </strong>(with the implication that we might as well not have done it).  Says Isakson (paraphrasing):  Last bill paid teachers, but once the bill is gone, there&#8217;s no money to pay them.  (Implication&#8211;the stimulus was useless.  I doubt that the teachers whose jobs were saved for a few years would agree or the students who were saved from overcrowded classrooms or the lack of a music program.)</p>
<p>2.  <strong>the right&#8217;s response to the need to enact a stimulus rather than cutting&#8211;we&#8217;ve got a debt problem and a debt crisis.   Isakson says &#8220;we&#8217;re at the breaking point on leverage&#8221; so he wants to &#8220;inspire the private sector to reinvest in our country and reinvest in businesses.&#8221;   </strong>(of course, this overlooks the fact that the &#8220;debt crisis&#8221; was caused by right-wing obstructionism. or that the US Treasury can borrow now at the cheapest rate we can expect to see forever once this crisis ends&#8211;we should borrow cheap while we can, spend it on infrastructure and job creation.  It also roundly ignores the historic pattern that businesses won&#8217;t invest in US business when (a) we allow them to expatriate assets to create businesses abroad without taxing them on the built in gains in those assets, (b) we allow them to fire workers with ease because we&#8217;ve so weakened our labor laws that workers find it almost impossible to form unions and have any negotiating power with their bosses and (c) we continue to give businesses tax breaks for mergers and consolidations that create multinational super businesses that have no loyalty to the country  (Jeff Immelt said as much in the previous night&#8217;s NewsHour broadcast).</p>

<p>Hi folks.  I have to go on a bit of a hiatus.  I have some work-related things that need taking care of that will require a lot of time for the foreseeable future.  But I thought I&#8217;d leave you with a link to a post by <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2011/10/why-dont-congressmen-have-better-financial-oversight/246485/">Megan McArdle</a> that I actually agree with 100% and recommend reading. I know!!!  </p>
<p>Well, off to the salt mines.  Toodle-oo.</p>
