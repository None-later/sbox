                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Via <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2008/02/self-employment-takes-biggest-hit-in-15.html">Yves Smith</a>, we learn that:</p>
<blockquote><p>Labor Department statistics&#8230; show that the hours worked by the self-employed fell at a 15.5% annualized rate in the third quarter of 207, the steepest drop in 15 years. The subprime crisis may be the big culprit, since construction workers and mortgage brokers are often in the ranks of the self-employed.</p>
<p>Note that the findings of the BLS Household Survey conflict with the oft-commented-upon monthly employment report, which in 2007 kept showing rising employment among small businesses via its &#8220;birth-death model&#8221;, which is basically a statistical plug.</p></blockquote>
<p>Regular readers may recall I&#8217;ve had comments about the birth-death model before.  My comments noted that according to the BLS website, there is an ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) model underlying the whole thing.  An ARIMA model has three components &#8211; (autoregressive (AR), integrated (I or &#8220;differenced&#8221;), and moving average(MA)).  If you pick these terms the right way (or unscrupulously &#8211; depending on how you interpret the world) you can literally produce any result you want.  Since the BLS&#8217; website doesn&#8217;t tell us what their AR, I, or MA terms are or the process by which they&#8217;re derived, and since this administration has a tendency to, ahem, lean on its experts, there&#8217;s no reason to trust anything that comes out of the birth-death model, especially if it doesn&#8217;t match what you&#8217;re observing in the real world.  As I&#8217;ve noted time and again, its clear that unemployment has been understated for a while.</p>
<p>Its anecdotal &#8211; I&#8217;m self-employed and my hours dropped in 2007 too.  For seven years, I&#8217;ve depended exclusively on repeat business and business that sought me out, doing no marketing whatsoever (I&#8217;ve never been comfortable marketing myself), but I&#8217;ve started looking for ways to expand my clientèle.  </p>
<p>But forget me&#8230; hours worked by the self-employed fell, huh?  I expect <a href="http://www.optimist123.com/optimist/">this guy</a> to tell us its a pleasant surprise that the self-employed are now secure enough to begin enjoying more leisure,  <a href="http://www.kudlowsmoneypolitics.blogspot.com/">this one</a> to blame Democrats taking over Congress, and <a href="http://www.clubforgrowth.org/index.php">these guys</a> to explain that our problems began when people started to realize that GW won&#8217;t be President for much longer and St. Ronald is still dead.</p>

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p><a href="http://www.tnr.com/politics/story.html?id=fda159ff-46c4-4d1b-9a4b-7b628d9fb8d0">Richard Thaler and Susan Woodward</a> paint her proposal as some massive interest rate ceiling:</p>
<blockquote><p>What would happen if scheduled rate increases were halted? Although it might make some borrowers happy, such a freeze could potentially poison the mortgage market and quickly exacerbate the slump in housing prices. If lenders and investors do not receive the interest payments they expected, they will be wary going forward. Should they avoid providing funds for adjustable rate mortgages, since the government would have just proven that the terms can be changed if difficulty arises? Should they avoid all mortgages, since the government now seems to prioritize short-term concerns for borrowers? Maybe they should avoid lending in the United States altogether? Such a policy would clearly send a dangerous message far beyond our borders. Two trillion dollars of U.S. national debt is held by foreign governments. Interest rates on this debt are low in part because foreigners trust the U.S. to pay back its loans as promised. The rates would surely be higher if its holders thought the U.S. could renege on its promises to pay. But this is precisely the expectation America would encourage by unilaterally changing the terms on $2 trillion in mortgages held by investors around the world.</p></blockquote>
<p>While that sounds awful, let’s back up a second:</p>
<blockquote><p>In an older posting on her Web site, Senator Clinton describes the policy as applying only to sub-prime mortgages. But most of her recent speeches do not include that qualifier, and since Hillary is nothing if not careful, one can only conclude she is either expanding her proposal to all adjustable rate mortgages, or at least would like voters to think so.</p></blockquote>
<p>Thaler and Woodward later concede:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Clinton proposal is a blunt tool applied too broadly to problems that are, in principle, contained and specific. Only 3.1 percent of prime (good credit) ARM loans are seriously (90 days or more) delinquent. The disconcerting delinquency rate of 16 percent is for the subprime sector&#8211;which is alarming, to be sure, but 84 percent are not seriously delinquent. Over the last three years there was an unusually large volume of aggressive lending activity with flaws at several levels. Some borrowers were led into loans they did not understand. These people deserve some concern. Other loans were made to speculators who do not live in the homes and were betting that house prices would continue to go up. The inhabitants of these homes deserve our concern, but the investors do not. It is now clear that there were too few checks and controls to assure reasonable loan underwriting practices (for example, no escrow accounts for taxes and insurance) or even good recordkeeping. An accurate assessment of the current mortgage problem would probably reveal no more than 700,000 loans with distressed borrowers. Why, then, would the U.S. government rewrite eleven million loans, or even all 3.4 million subprime mortgages? Any intervention should be targeted at the borrowers who are truly in trouble, especially those who were likely duped by unscrupulous mortgage lenders. The numbers suggest these victims are disproportionately poor, young, and African American. Looking forward, the government needs to take steps to make this market more transparent and make it easier for borrowers to make good choices. But it would be irresponsible to do this by ruling millions of legal contracts null and void.</p></blockquote>
<p>Could there be common ground here?  Thaler and Woodward argue for a targeted approach as opposed to some broad based “command-and-control approach”.  Their recommendation makes sense to me as seems to be what Senator Clinton may have been saying in that older posting.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Something tells me that this will be a hot topic at this year’s DNC.  <a href="http://www.detnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080129/METRO/801290450/1409/METRO">Gordon Trowbridge</a> provided some background a little over a week ago:  </p>
<blockquote><p>The Democratic presidential front-runners continued their sparring today over the role of Michigan and Florida in their nomination battle, with Sen. Hillary Clinton&#8217;s campaign saying the states&#8217; convention delegates should be seated at the national convention, and backers of Sen. Barack Obama calling that a political ploy. Obama campaign manager David Plouffe repeated the campaign&#8217;s position that the Michigan and Florida contests will have no role in choosing the nominee, though he left open the possibility that Obama would support seating the delegations if he enters this summer&#8217;s convention in Denver as the clear nominee. The back-and-forth came as Florida Democrats headed to the polls to vote in today&#8217;s contest that the Democratic National Committee has declared meaningless. Like Michigan, Florida is being punished by the national party for moving its contest into January. The party has said it will not seat the delegations of either state, though Democratic leaders from Michigan and Florida are nearly unanimous in their belief that the penalties ultimately won&#8217;t hold. Clinton, who won in Michigan and is expected to win in Florida as well, has said she will encourage her delegates from other states to vote to seat Michigan and Florida, a stance campaign manager Patty Solis Doyle repeated today.</p></blockquote>
<p>While the DNC’s current position is that these delegates should not be seated, it’s going to be a hard position to sustain since the Democrats will likely need Florida and its citizens are likely going to see the Democrats as being hypocritical if these delegates have no voice in the 2008 DNC.  After all, we Democrats have been signing the song about every vote should count ever since that 2000 fiasco. </p>
<p>Let’s not give Senator Clinton too much credit for taking a noble stand as she would be the beneficiary of the DNC reversing its position.  So the Obama camp’s charge of a political ploy might have some merit but their position also seems to be a political ploy as well.  Of course they’d allow these delegates to vote if Senator Obama had already gone over the top so that their votes really would not matter.  </p>
<p>But Reuters – via <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2008_02/013070.php">Kevin Drum</a> &#8211; is reporting:</p>
<blockquote><p>By the time the last primary is held June 7, Obama&#8217;s advisers project he will have 1,806 delegates to 1,789 for New York Senator Hillary Clinton, according to a document outlining the scenario that was inadvertently attached to a release on delegate counts from yesterday&#8217;s Super Tuesday primaries.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, this race will be extremely close.  Kevin continues:</p>
<blockquote><p>I guess this means that superdelegates can now expect the Obama folks to start recruiting them like high school football stars.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let’s suppose, however, that Clinton and Obama also pretty much split the superdelegate vote as well.  Whether the Florida and Michigan delegates get to vote on the first round can turn out to be quite important.  I expect this to be one of many fights during this year’s DNC.  The floor is open – should they be allowed to vote or not?  Discuss!</p>

Cleveland was not part of the stats. Most counties were in California, Florida, then GA, AZ, and CO. Interesting.</p>
<blockquote><p>The usual suspects top the list. Wayne County, Mich., home to Detroit, is first, with 10,622 homes in foreclosure with negative equity, 176 of which have more than $100,000 of negative equity. Clark County, Nev., where you&#8217;ll find Las Vegas, has 4,278 homes in foreclosure with negative equity and lands at No. 2.</p>
<p>Rounding out the top five are Maricopa County in Arizona, and Riverside and Los Angeles counties in California.</p>
<p>Of course, not all foreclosures in a given area fit the same profile. In Wayne County, for example, almost 40% of all current foreclosures are on properties with negative equity. By contrast, of foreclosures in Miami-Dade, another area hard hit by the subprime crisis, only 11.6% have negative equity.</p></blockquote>
<p>Florida had a problem of selling but with &#8220;positive&#8221; equity, perhaps from inflated appraisals.</p>
<p>Also note that there were a portion with $100,000 or more with negative equity. I cannot be as thorough as DolB, but worth following as well.</p>

<blockquote><p>Saturday, December 11, 2004Housing Bubble, Revisited<br />After reading <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2004/12/housing-market-optimism.html">Kash&#8217;s first housing post</a>, I read the paper he cited, &#8220;<a href="http://www.newyorkfed.org/research/epr/04v10n3/0412mcca.pdf">Are Home Prices the Next Bubble?</a>&#8221; (FRBNY Economic Policy Review, Dec 2004). While there is a lot to chew on, I share Kash&#8217;s skepticism. In particular, the authors rely heavily on quality adjusted housing prices to reach their conclusion that there is no housing bubble. For example, consider their Chart 6:</p>
<p>The numerator is the total payment, including interest, for a &#8220;quality adjusted&#8221; house, meaning that they use hedonic regressions to deflate the numerator to adjust for factors such as larger and newer homes, more appliances, lot size, and so forth. The denominator is just median income. As the graph clearly shows, after adjusting for quality, housing is clearly consuming less &#8212; not more! &#8212; of families&#8217; income. So there&#8217;s no bubble. Or, as the authors write at one point, &#8220;Perhaps we should be asking why home prices did not rise even more under the circumstances.&#8221; </p>
<p>But then I thought about my friends who own really nice, fancy, homes. For the most part, they all moved to the suburbs, often the outer suburbs, in order to afford their fancy homes. In the typical case, a new child created need for more space and a large home was simply not affordable in the close-in parts of the city. Hence the move to the suburbs. </p>
<p>If the authors are going to rely upon quality adjustment, they should also at least account for the corresponding increases in commute times. In fact, the value of an hour of commuting time is usually estimated to be about $15.00. If moving to the suburbs entails an extra 10 minutes of driving to work each way, for 250 days per year, that adds up to 5,000 minutes, or about 83 hours, which is valued at roughly $1200, per year. Depending on the discount rate, that dollar amount has a present discounted value of roughly $10,000 to $15,000, which should be subtracted from the quality-adjusted price. A change of that amount in the quality adjusted home prices used in the above figure would, I suspect, notably alter the above figure. In particular, it would offset much of the decrease. Without their income numbers, it&#8217;s impossible to tell exactly how large the effect would be, but I can ballpark it. Median income in 2003 was about $43,300; using that in the denominator implies a quality-adjusted monthly payment of $505 at the end of their sample, where the ratio is around .14 ($505 is not the actual payment, it&#8217;s the quality-adjusted payment; the actual payment is some larger amount). Adding $10,000 to the principal to incorporate the higher commuting time implies an increased monthly payment of about $62, for a commute-adjusted monthly payment of $567. Using that number increases their end of sample ratio to 15.7%. Even higher commute times, or accounting for two commuters, would increase the ratio even further. (Of course, not all home buyers move to the suburbs.) </p>
<p>Also, read the note below the figure: &#8220;Authors&#8217; calculations assume an 80 percent loan-to-value ratio.&#8221; I believe that putting 20% down on a house is now the exception, not the norm. With less than 20% down, the payments are higher due to both a larger loan size and mortgage insurance. In terms of Chart 6, to the extent that families are in fact putting less money down, the numerator used to construct the series will be larger, and the decline even less pronounced. Overall, I&#8217;m not convinced that the authors are wrong, but I&#8217;m even less convinced that they are right. In fact, the stage 3 of a bubble theory, described in a <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2004/12/more-on-house-prices.html">follow up post</a> by Kash yesterday, seems like the most compelling explanation for the evidence in the FRB study: </p>
<p>Third, highly intelligent economists, puzzled by the duration of the overvaluation, evolve theories of why things are different this time, and why this time the overvaluation is perhaps sustainable after all.AB P.S.

<p>You can obtain the graph from the link. Calculated Risk advised AB in 2005 that the bubble would not pop until later, about a year or so. There are a number of posts worth revisiting as we change to a new look.   I was advised recently by CR that where he lives the ROI of a million or two was also a part of the sub-prime delusions.  Just saying.</p>

                                <p>Hearing that democratic turnout has been stronger in the past primaries prior to Super Tuesday, I used C &#038; L&#8217;s <a href="http://www.crooksandliars.com/2008/02/05/spokesuper-tuesday-open-thread/">chart data </a>to total up the voter count.  I exclude the states that did not have duel party primaries. The turnout was 14,865,735 democratic to 8,929,123 republican. The republican turnout was 60% of the democratic turnout.</p>
<p>I then went to<a href="http://mwhodges.home.att.net/election2004.htm"> this map</a> to see the “red states” from 2004 and calculated the voter turnout. Super Tuesday had 11 red states voting. Of those, 8 had more democratic voters than republican voters for Super Tuesday. For those 8 states (AR, CO, GA, MO, ND, OK, TN, UT) it was 3,407,658 democratic voters, 2,963,340 republican voters. The republican turnout was 87% of the democratic.</p>
<p>For the 3 remaining states of the 11 &#8220;red&#8221; (AK, AL, AZ)  it was 1,001,540 republican voter turnout to 902,755 democratic voter turnout. The democratic turnout was 90% of the republican.</p>
<p>Interesting no?  Cha, cha, cha changes&#8230;</p>

                                <p>I came across this site: <a href="http://www.voiceofthemiddleclass.blogspot.com/">Voice of the Middle Class</a>. They have organized the candidates by issue and voting record. They have created comparison tables by issue listing the solutions on the side and candidates across the top with a check mark if they support. They have tables by candidate for each issue. You can also see their voting record based on bills related to each issue. Seems like a nice place to start in understanding the differences. There are links to each candidates&#8217; web page.</p>
<p>There is this article I thought would also be of interest:<a href="http://www.unitedprofessionals.org/blog/2008/02/04/aarp-position/"> AARP position on Universal Health Care</a>.<br />It is a collection of info via articles with links on AARP and their influence on the debate. It notes various other front organization they have teamed up with to keep the discussion moving toward private insurance.<strong> AARP and the Business Roundtable have joined with SEIU</strong> [Service Employees International Union] <strong>to form something called Divided We Fail. Divided We Fail is a corporate liberal answer to single payer.<br /></strong><br />We&#8217;re talking some big money here by AARP. <strong>Even AARP, which earned $379 million in royalties in 2005, mostly from health insurance sales, appears to favor universal public and private health care coverage&#8230;.</strong> AARP also said<strong> it would use $500 million of insurance sales revenue over the next decade to help people navigate the health care system, with a new counseling service.</strong><br /><strong></strong></p>
<p>One of their links is to an article in the Nation on the drive to privatize medicare.<br />
<blockquote>However, after 2003 the government began shoveling huge sums of money into the Medicare Advantage plans to entice seniors to leave the traditional program-in effect subsidizing privatization&#8230; This year the government will pay insurers on average 12 percent more than it costs to provide the same benefits to people who stay in the traditional program, according to the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC), an independent group that advises Congress. HMOs will get 10 percent more, but private fee-for-service plans will get a whopping 19 percent more, a subsidy that lets them offer rock-bottom premiums and lots of extras-at least for now.</p></blockquote>
<p>All I can say in such a climate where hiding one&#8217;s true intentions can be done so easily is THANK GOD FOR NET NEUTRALITY!</p>

                                <p>Maybe you recall the White House games back in the fall of 2001 when Senate moderates were trying to push through an effective stimulus package but were being blocked by the GOP Senate leadership at every turn.  This was part of a White House led game that started with the GOP dominated House passing a bill long on deficit creation but short on aggregate demand stimulus.  While the various ideas from the Senate moderates were superior to the House bill, the White House strategy was to have Senator majority leader Trent Lott engineering stalling tactics while White House spokesmen went out and bashed the Senate for not moving on the House bill.  </p>
<p>Well guess what?  It seems it’s happening this go round with BNA (a tax publisher) doing a good job of covering the details.  Last night there were a series of updates from BNA with the key parts summarized as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) said Feb. 5 he intends to file a new motion for a cloture vote in an attempt to move forward on a Finance Committee-derived stimulus package. While both Reid and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) agreed that they are still likely to reach agreement this week, the cloture motion is likely to delay a floor vote on final passage of the bill until Feb. 8, a Reid spokesman said … Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus (D-Mont.) told reporters Feb. 5 that the Senate will now hold only one vote on the economic stimulus package, and it will be on an expanded version of the Finance Committee-approved chairman&#8217;s mark … Repeatedly pressed Feb. 5 about why the administration will not accept language that would allow senior citizens and disabled veterans to receive tax rebate checks under the stimulus package, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson would only say that he supports the House package (H.R. 5140) and did not want to negotiate in a public forum. Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee used a hearing on the president&#8217;s fiscal year 2009 budget proposal to criticize the administration for rejecting their language to give rebates to 20 million senior citizens whose only income is from Social Security, and to 250,000 veterans who receive disability payments.  Paulson said he prefers the House package, which he said gives the “greatest bang for the buck,” and that he believes “we&#8217;ll work this out,” but he did not think “a public hearing is the forum to negotiate.” He said he supports Congress moving quickly and would like to see the larger Senate package “out there, on the floor, and voted for and worked through.” Sen. Blanche Lincoln (D-Ark.) said she the administration appears to be fighting the Senate changes, adding “you don&#8217;t like everything in our package, that&#8217;s obvious, and that&#8217;s life, you don&#8217;t get everything you want” but “I think disabled veterans and seniors are a very important improvement” to the House package.</p></blockquote>
<p>While Paulson is arguing that the House bill will give the greatest bang for the buck, we know that this is not the case as noted <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/01/why-this-bear-is-angry-about-stimulus.html">here</a>.  While Baucus is trying to move through a more sensible stimulus package, McConnell is helping this White House stall action.  And now the Treasury Secretary is not only saying our way or the highway, he is flat out lying about which bill gives the greatest bang for the buck.  Par for the course for this corrupt and dishonest Administration!</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>I recently critiqued <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/02/kudlow-on-how-to-pay-for-increased.html">Larry Kudlow</a>.  One thing I didn&#8217;t really make much of a note about was his citing Alan Reynolds of Cato.  Reynolds has since responded &#8211; his letter is posted <a href="http://www.cato-at-liberty.org/2008/02/05/larry-kudlow%E2%80%99s-question-%E2%80%9Cis-mccain-like-ike%E2%80%9D/">here</a>.  But the post Reynolds wrote covers other ground as well and I was interested in a few things he wrote. </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s one thing where I (and it seems to me the facts) would disagree with Reynolds<br />
<blockquote>The economy was in recession almost as often as not in those days – in 1953-54, 1957-58 and 1960. John F. Kennedy, Bower rightly noted, campaigned on slashing [Republican] tax rates to get the economy moving again. When tax rates were finally cut in 1964, it worked (as always).</p></blockquote>
<p>A <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/01/dynamic-scoring-two-simple-graphs-tell.html">recent post</a>  (to which I&#8217;ve since linked several times) shows the real GDP per capita growth rates and change in the rate of taxes as a percent of personal income for presidents beginning with Ike.  JFK&#8217;s administration (from  1960 to 1963) produced the second fastest growth rate since the end of WW2.  (Truman isn&#8217;t shown in that graph, but Truman didn&#8217;t exactly produce growth.)  Faster than Clinton (#2) or Reagan (very close #3), and some distance behind LBJ.  Now, perhaps one can argue that LBJ produced faster growth than JFK because of the cuts in marginal rates in 1964, but then why was growth so fast under JFK? Bear in mind, the top individual marginal rate was 91% at the time. </p>
<p>Another place I&#8217;m not sure Reynolds has the facts right is here:</p>
<blockquote><p>The two parties switched sides recently, with Republicans adopting JFK’s approach by cutting the most destructive tax rates in 1981-86, and Democrats sounding and acting more like Ike since 1993. </p></blockquote>
<p>The recent post of mine I referenced above has two graphs.  One shows economic growth, and but the second one, which is worth a look at this point, shows the share of income that gets paid in taxes.  As I keep stating, there are two ways to raise (or lower) taxes.  One is to raise (or lower) tax rates.  The other is to increase (or decrease) enforcement and how stringently the IRS interprets tax law.  Every single one of the Dem administrations in the sample raised the share of people&#8217;s income paid in taxes (LBJ included), and every single one of the Rep administrations in the sample (Ike included) reduced it. </p>
<p>Finally, I would note this paragraph by Reynolds as well:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Eisenhower-Nixon years defined the phrase “fiscal conservative.” If Democrats spent too much, a “fiscal conservative” would regard it as his duty to do the honorable thing and raise tax rates as much and as often as required, if only to protect the military budget.</p></blockquote>
<p>I would think, and perhaps I&#8217;m wrong but I suspect Ike and Nixon were defined as fiscal conservatives because <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/12/republican-party-and-national-debt.html">they paid down debt</a>, something no Republican president has done since Ford was in office, and something every Dem president has done since Truman took office. </p>
<p>I also note&#8230; does it make sense for one side to criticize the other for spending too much if the other side is paying down debt and producing faster economic growth rates?  The only way I can see that being OK is if one either doesn&#8217;t know the facts about economic growth and debt, or one doesn&#8217;t like the other things that were a part of the platform (and perhaps which helped achieve the results), such as the focus on the little guy.  </p>
<p>Also, Nixon may have raised capital gains rates, but he lowered the top marginal rate on individuals.  (LBJ left him with a 77% rate in 1969&#8230; by 1971 it was down to 70%.)   I also note&#8230; Ike didn&#8217;t touch cap gains rates, but he lowered individual income tax rates.  Not much, but he lowered them.  When he took office, the bottom marginal rate was 22.2% and the top marginal rate was 92%; a year later these rates were  20% and  91%, respectively.</p>
<p>Frankly, I think the Cato blog is one of the better ones on the right side of the blogosphere, and it will be on our new blogroll when we&#8217;ve gotten it up.  (Poor Dan has had all the work dumped on him.)  As an organization, Cato is often quite willing to accept what the data says, even if it shows that a formerly admired character has stepped off the reservation.  Now and then they (Cato) even dust off a few of the more obvious failings by St. Ronald the Reagan.  But it seems to me that they aren&#8217;t willing to accept that the data simply doesn&#8217;t show what they so badly want it show about tax rates and economic growth rates. And its a pity&#8230;  because there is some truth to what they say about tax rates.  But that truth, just like the one adhered to by the far left, seems to be a boundary condition.  They could do a lot of good if they noticed what happens, what really happens in the vast middle.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>Update&#8230; minor changes for clarity made to the last paragraph.</p>
