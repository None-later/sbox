                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>The economic policies proposed for states by the conservative  American Legislative Council Exchange (ALEC) not only don&#8217;t work, but  carry risks for states&#8217; economies, according to <a href="http://www.iowapolicyproject.org/2012docs/121128-snakeoiltothestates.pdf">new research</a> by the Iowa Policy Project and Good Jobs First.</p>
<p>As we have seen most recently with <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/chi-michigan-right-to-work-20121207,0,6331751.story">Michigan&#8217;s passage</a> of anti-union so-called &#8220;right to work&#8221; legislation (which lets people  free ride on union contracts and makes union organization and  representation more difficult), the legislative agenda of ALEC proclaims  that states should follow a low-tax, low-wage, non-union route to  economic prosperity. Now, you or I might wonder how creating low-wage  jobs is supposed to create prosperity, but luckily for us ALEC has  ranked the states by how &#8220;competitive&#8221; their economic policies were  beginning in 2007, giving us the chance to see how well their  recommended policies have done.</p>
<p>ALEC&#8217;s <a href="http://www.alec.org/docs/RSPS_4th_Edition.pdf">15 recommended factors</a> (p. 18) include taxes, debt service, public employees per 10,000  residents, &#8220;quality&#8221; of the legal system, &#8220;right to work,&#8221; minimum wage,  and workers&#8217; compensation costs. As pointed out by <a href="http://ctj.org/taxjusticedigest/archive/2012/04/arthur_laffers_rich_states_poo.php">earlier commentaries</a>,  it says nothing about education or infrastructure, which have clear  effects on a state&#8217;s economy. The new report by economist Peter Fisher  with Greg LeRoy and Phil Mattera undertakes a statistical analysis of  these policies, using the ALEC ranking of all 50 states as of 2007 to  see how well their economies have performed since then. Fisher et al.  also highlight the shoddy statistical work by Arthur Laffer in creating  the ALEC index and reporting results.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Whereas Laffer  frequently makes his points simply by comparing the top vs. bottom 8-10  states, Fisher et al. start with a full comparison of all 50 states via a  correlation analysis, then proceed to the necessary addition of holding  other potential causes constant in what is know as multiple regression  analysis. Beginning with the correlations, here is what the new report  finds. Correlation runs from -1 (perfect negative relationship) to +1  (perfect positive relationship); the closer to +1 below, the better the  ALEC competitiveness index predicted the following outcomes. All changes  are from 2007 to 2011.</p>
<p>ALEC Competitiveness Index ranking correlated with&#8211;</p>
<p>State gross domestic product:  .02 (not statistically significant)<br />Percent change in nonfarm employment: -.09 (not statistically significant)<br />Percent change in per capita income: -.27 (statistically significant)<br />Percent change in state and local government revenue: -.16 (not statistically significant)<br />Percent change in median family income: -.30 (statistically significant)<br />Change in poverty rate: .21 (&#8220;statistically significant&#8221; at the .1 level*)</p>
<p>What  this tells us is that the states which were following ALEC&#8217;s preferred  policies the most in 2007 saw worse performance in per capita income  growth and median family income as well as a worse performance n poverty  that we can almost be sure was not due to chance. The only thing ALEC&#8217;s  top states did see as predicted was an increase was in  population  (Fisher et al. did not report the correlation coefficient, but their  discussion makes it clear that it was statistically significant).  However, population growth per se is not an economic outcome, as the  report points out.</p>
<p>The concluding regression analysis  weakens the case for negative consequences, but provides no support for  positive effects of ALEC&#8217;s state policies. Fisher et al. show that the  most important determinants of 2007-11 GDP growth, employment growth,  and per capita income growth are the components of a state&#8217;s economy,  with the strongest determinants being the presence of extractive  industry (primarily due to the higher price of oil during this period)  and a large health care industry. Once these are controlled for, none of  the ALEC variables are statistically significant, though the closest is  that the top personal income tax rate is associated with higher, not  lower, per capita income growth.</p>
<p>If none of ALEC&#8217;s  policies work as advertised for job and income growth, what do they do?  They are, in fact, a prescription for economic inequality. So-called  &#8220;right to work&#8221; does not increase growth, but it reduces workers&#8217;  bargaining power. Reducing taxes on the wealthy increases post-tax  inequality. And so on, down the panoply of ALEC policies. Fisher et al.  (p. 11) put it well:<br />
<blockquote>The ALEC-Laffer  strategies are exclusively those that would lower taxes on corporations  and the wealthy, reduce public sector revenues (and hence public  investments in education, health and infrastructure), and lower wages by  eliminating minimum wages and weakening the bargaining power of  workers. Yet the book claims that all of these measures would make  states, and their populations, richer.</p></blockquote>
<p>The report is <i>Selling Snake Oil to the States</i>, and that is precisely what ALEC&#8217;s policies are.</p>
<p>*  Technical note: I&#8217;m old school on when we should consider something  probably not due to chance. For generations, the standard cutoff was  that you have to be 95% certain a result was *not* due to chance to call  it statistically significant. In economics, and now increasingly in  political science, researchers have sometimes called a result  statistically significant using a 90% cutoff instead. In my view, this  shift has been due to what is called &#8220;publication bias&#8221;: it is easier to  get your study published in an academic journal if you have some  statistically significant result. But this is a big problem in areas  like minimum wage research, where not finding a statistically  significant negative effect from increasing the minimum wage actually  tells you a great deal. The key analysis of publication bias in minimum  wage research can be found in David Card and Alan Krueger&#8217;s book <a href="http://books.google.com/books/about/Myth_and_Measurement.html?id=VDNI0Uy86J8C"><i>Myth and Measurement</i></a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>Independent political and economic analysts Bruce Bartlett and Yves Smith join Bill in a discussion that&#8217;s become as rare as it is necessary &#8212; why are Washington insiders talking about the deficit crisis and not the jobs crisis? Bartlett, former advisor to Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush, got into hot water with fellow conservatives when he aired concerns about the direction of their ideology and wrote critically of the second George Bush. His most recent book is The Benefit and The Burden: Tax Reform &#8212; Why We Need It, and What It Will Take. Yves Smith, who spent more than 25 years in the financial services industry, is the founder and editor of the popular blog Naked Capitalism, and runs a successful management consulting firm.

<p><a href="http://www.aguanomics.com/2012/12/all-in-auctions-is-published.html" target="_blank">The political-economy of water&#8230;all in auctions</a></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been working on this idea for 5-6 years, and I think it has great potential for reallocating water while respecting the rights of existing users. It just came out in the <i>Journal of Environmental Management</i>. </p>
<p>Abstract: This paper proposes a novel mechanism for reallocating temporary water flows or permanent water rights. The All-in-Auction (AiA) increases efficiency and social welfare by reallocating water without harming water rights holders. AiAs can be used to allocate variable or diminished flows among traditional or new uses. AiAs are appropriate for use within larger organizations that distribute water among members, e.g., irrigation districts or wholesale water agencies. Members would decide when and how to use AiAs, i.e., when transaction costs are high, environmental constraints are binding, or allocation to outsiders is desired. Experimental sessions show that an AiA reallocates more units with no less efficiency that traditional two-sided auctions.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8230;the bottom line is that Liptak&#8217;s spot-on, and that I think that the Supreme Court will use that Illinois case that Liptak discusses to make clear that the Second Amendment is not absolute. The Illinois statute bars carrying any weapons in public, even unconcealed ones. </p>
<p>I think that, 5-4, they&#8217;ll say that that is unconstitutional but that laws banning carrying concealed weapons in public are constitutional. I also think that, now, finally, Congress will pass laws against the sale of semi-automatic weapons and against the sale of ammunition clips of more than 10 bullets, and that once a constitutional challenge to those laws gets to the Supreme Court, the Court will uphold the laws.  </p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/19/us/gun-plans-dont-conflict-with-justices-08-ruling.html?emc=tnt&#038;tntemail1=y&#038;_r=0">Gun plans don&#8217;t conflict with Justices 08 ruling</a> by Adam Liptak reasons:</p>
<blockquote><p>Despite the sweeping language of a <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/07-290.ZO.html">2008 Supreme Court decision</a> that struck down parts of the District of Columbia’s strict gun-control law, the decision appears perfectly consistent with many of the policy options being discussed after the shootings in Newtown, Conn.</p>
<p>Legal experts say the decision in the case, District of Columbia v. Heller, has been of mainly symbolic importance so far. There have been more than 500 challenges to gun laws and gun prosecutions since Heller was decided, and vanishingly few of them have succeeded.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Of the 12 deadliest mass shootings in American history, six have occurred since 2007&#8221; also caught my attention.</p>

                                <p>There are a number of well thought out plans to handle the problems proposed by opponents of Social Security and also those concerned about its sustainability.  To have our political and media debate confined to one item like chained-cpi should make any reasonable voter pause and wonder &#8220;Is that all?  How dumb can we be?&#8221;  Take a breath and a half hour to review trhe fact that there a a lot of alternatives&#8230;don&#8217;t let your politician quote you a bumper sticker slogan.  There are plenty of alternatives that won&#8217;t cut benefits for a well functioning program that could deliver a decent result.</p>
<p>&#8220;Workers will have MORE money in their pockets AND will have paid for a longer retirement at a higher standard of living.&#8221;   <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/12/social-security-cuts-offeredwhy.html" title="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/12/social-security-cuts-offeredwhy.html">Social Security cuts offered&#8230;why?</a>  </p>
<blockquote><p>According to the 2010 CBO report Options for Social Security the chained CPI will &#8220;solve&#8221; about one third of the projected shortfall.<br />Since a tax raise of forty cents per week per year over the same time would solve the entire projected shortfall, it looks as though the chained CPI is going to save workers about 13 cents per week per year while their wages are going up eight dollars per week per year.<br />Of course the chained CPI is going to cost them a thousand dollars a year when they are too old to do anything about it.<br />Makes you wonder who the President&#8217;s financial advisor is.<br />&#8230;<br />The CBO report was from 2010. raising the cap to cover 90% of earnings would put the cap at about 150k, and their benefits would be increased.<br />This might be salable to them&#8230; if they figured the extra tax was a reasonable price to pay for the extra insurance&#8230; I am guessing their SS benefit would go from about 26k to about 35k. I don&#8217;t think they would be happy with that ratio.<br />In any case I would prefer to pay the extra 13 cents per week and keep Social Security &#8220;worker paid.&#8221;<br />You don&#8217;t want welfare. it&#8217;s ugly.</p>

<blockquote><p>Everyone interested in actual SS numbers <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/publication/21547">should read that CBO 2010 report &#8216;Social Security Policy Options&#8217;</a> or just refer to special figure 1. CBO scored 30 different policy options taken in isolation and although some would interact if enacted together for the most part you can treat the fixes as a cafeteria plan and mix and match to reach your 0.6 target. For example there is one fix that closes 0.9 of that 0.6 which makes room for proposals that shift benefits to the bottom in a way that still mets out at 0.6. Now in the event I agree with Dale that this particular combination adds up to &#8216;welfare&#8217; and moreover that that would be a bad thing. But your views may vary.<br />The point being that most obvious changes to SS have already been scored, all you need to do is Google the cited document.</p></blockquote>

<h4><a href="http://www.komonews.com/news/local/78088192.html">&#8216;Horror scene&#8217; as 4 Lakewood police officers shot, killed</a></h4>
<blockquote><p>LAKEWOOD, Wash. &#8211; Four uniformed police officers were shot and killed in a bloody Sunday morning attack at a Lakewood-area coffee shop, and investigators are seeking a person of interest in the killings, officials said.Pierce County Sheriff&#8217;s Office spokesman Ed Troyer said the person they are seeking is Maurice Clemmons, who is a fugitive from Arkansas with a lengthy criminal record.</p></blockquote>
<p>Not to be flip but is there a more hardened target in America than a fricking DONUT SHOP known as a pre-shift COP SHOP? Are we to imagine that everything would have been fine if four kindergarten and first grade teachers/armed monitors from the nearest elementary school had been having some pre-school coffee and going over their paperwork just as the cops were? Or maybe if the girl behind the counter had been packing?</p>
<p>And if we didn&#8217;t need more irony we have this:</p>
<h4><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/11/29/multiple-police-officers-_n_373119.html">Huckabee Granted Clemency To Maurice Clemmons, Person Of Interest, In Ambush That Killed 4 Cops</a></h4>
<blockquote><p>A man with an extensive criminal past &#8212; whose 95-year prison sentence was commuted in Arkansas nearly a decade ago by then-Gov. Mike Huckabee&#8211; was being sought Sunday as a &#8220;person of interest&#8221; in a deadly ambush on four police officers who were gunned down inside a coffee shop.</p></blockquote>
<p>Snip<br />
<blockquote>In 1989, Clemmons, then 17, was convicted in Little Rock for aggravated robbery. He was paroled in 2000 after then-Gov. Mike Huckabee commuted Clemmons&#8217; 95-year prison sentence. Huckabee, who was criticized during his run for the Republican presidential nomination in 2008 for the number of clemencies and commutations he granted, cited Clemmons&#8217; age at the time of the sentence.<br />After his release from prison, Clemmons violated his parole and was returned to prison in July 2001. He was released March 18, 2004, according to the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette newspaper .</p></blockquote>
<p>But even without the sickening hypocrisy of Huckabee blaming the Sandy Hook shooting on the failure of first graders to engage in state sponsored prayer, we have a case of four trained, armed police officers just minutes from going on patrol being caught mostly unaware by a shooter determined to kill. In light of that the suggestion that all would have been well if only that principal had a M-4 locked in a cabinet in her office ring pretty hollow.</p>

<p>There are many options to address issues for the program, which are not offered as part of Pres. Obama&#8217;s  insistence on keeping  Social Security on the table and front and center.  Perhaps the &#8216;chained cpi&#8217; is abstract enough to look harmless, and trying to &#8216;fix&#8217; a possible problem decades in advance doesn&#8217;t appear to be simply weird??   From comments comes this note from Dale Coberly.  There are several other plans  carefully thought out that fix things if needed&#8230;<br />
<blockquote>A reader suggested I check the results of the &#8220;one tenth of one percent tax increase&#8221; against the recent bad news from the Trustees.  </p>
<p>I looked at the result of increasing the tax one tenth of one percent for each the employee and the employer whenever the Trustees project short term actuarial insolvency. The results were the same as before the recession: an average increase of one half of one tenth of one percent increase on the combined employer-employee tax over the seventy five year actuarial window results in no insolvency whatsoever. </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>The effect of the Recession has been to move forward about six years the date of the first one tenth of one percent increase to about 2018.</p>
<p>By 2033 the tax would have been increased about one and a half percent for each, while wages will have gone up about 25%. Workers will have MORE money in their pockets AND will have paid for a longer retirement at a higher standard of living.</p>
<p>There is no crisis. Social Security is not going broke. Social Security adds NOTHING to the deficit. Social Security is not welfare. </p>
<p>Over the whole century and into the next, the SS tax would need to be raised another one percent, while wages will have gone up over one hundred percent.</p>
<p>What the bad guys have done is looked at the possible need for the tax raise, assumed that we will not be smart enough to raise the tax and called the difference &#8220;a huge debt.&#8221;</p>
<p>There will be no debt. But if people are not smart enough to realize that if they are going to live longer they are going to have to put aside a little more to pay for groceries after they can&#8217;t work any more, then they are going to have to learn to live on a little less .</p>
<p>They could even do that. It wouldn&#8217;t be wise, but at least it wouldn&#8217;t be as stupid as letting them &#8220;fix&#8221; Social Security in a way that destroys its value as insurance. And that&#8217;s all it is: a way to insure your own savings against inflation, market losses, and personal bad luck. Even against recessions.</p>
<p>But unless the people tell the president and the congress&#8230; that&#8217;s exactly what they will do&#8221; &#8220;Fix&#8221; it.. the way a two year old fixes his daddy&#8217;s watch.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>
<div>Since last Friday, our minds have been focused on children.  Those who lost their lives in the Newtown, Conn. tragedy on Friday.  Those at that school who survived.  Those at schools around the country, who now seem much more vulnerable to, of all things, an assault-rifle hit, even though they don’t live in a war zone.  Or even in a high-crime neighborhood.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Newtown is, I now know although I’d never heard of it before Friday, an upscale midsize town that serves largely as a so-called bedroom community for families like shooter Adam Lanza’s.  Lanza’s father Peter is an executive at General Electric in Stamford.  Lanza’s  24-year-old brother Ryan is an accountant at Ernst &#038; Young in Manhattan and now lives in gentrified Hoboken.  One of the six-year-old victims was an especially sweet-natured girl of apparent (based on her last name) British Isles ancestry whose articulate father was teaching her Portuguese in his spare time from a well-paying job.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>So <a href="http://fcd-us.org/sites/default/files/FINAL%202012%20CWI%20Report.pdf">a major new research report</a> released today detailing the breathtaking increase in child poverty and surprisingly broad-based decrease in several measurements of child welfare in the United States since 2000 is, or at least until Friday was, not really—or rather, not directly—about the children of idyllic Newton and upper-middle-class bedroom communities like it.  But it <i>is</i> quite directly about huge swaths of other American children.  And its revelations should play a central role in the outcome of what had been, until Friday, the major ongoing news story of the month: the “fiscal cliff” chess game.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The report, called the 2012 National Child and Youth Well-Being Index (CWI), is this year’s edition of an annual report produced by the Foundation for Child Development (FCD), a national, private philanthropic organization, and the Child and Youth Well-Being Index Project at Duke University. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The introduction explains that the FCD is dedicated to the principle that all families should have the social and material resources to raise their children to be healthy, educated, and productive members of their communities.  The annual report is a comprehensive measure of how children are faring in the United States, based on a composite of 28 key Indicators of well-being, grouped into seven Quality-of-Life/Well-Being Domains. These Domains are: Family Economic Well-Being, Safe/Risky Behavior, Social Relationships, Emotional/Spiritual Well-Being, Community Engagement, Educational Attainment, and Health.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The report explains that the CWI tracks changes in these Domains and Indicators, and in the value of the overall Index, compared to 1975 base year values.  But this year, for the first time, the report focuses on changes over the last decade, specifically the period from 2001 to 2011.  (It also includes some preliminary data from 2011.)
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The two bottom-line broad findings derived from several specific ones are striking, I think, not so much independently—neither one surprised me—but instead juxtaposed with each other.  After consistent improvements during the 1900s, family economic well-being has deteriorated significantly and consistently since 2001; the deterioration began at the beginning of the decade, not at the beginning of the 2008 economic collapse, which of course did accelerate it.  Median family income decreased.  Secure employment has decreased.  The percentage of children living in poverty has risen substantially.  Pre-kindergarten enrollment, which rose during the -90s, has stalled. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Yet that same period saw a fairly dramatic and consistent decline in what the report calls risky behaviors among teenagers and young adults as the decade progressed: “a dramatic reduction in the likelihood of teenagers being victims or perpetrators of violent crime, as well as substantial decreases in teenage childbearing, cigarette smoking, and binge drinking.”  (In discussing the crime rate, the report says it was down dramatically among teenagers even in 2011, but notes that that year’s teenagers were young when the major economic downturn began.) 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>In other words, the blame-the-victim canard cannot be employed convincingly this time around.
</p>
