                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/19/science/19watson.html?em&#038;ex=1193025600&#038;en=25a503b731871947&#038;ei=5087%0A">This story</a> has been going on for a few days:</p>
<blockquote><p>James D. Watson, who shared the 1962 Nobel prize for deciphering the double-helix of DNA, apologized “unreservedly” yesterday for comments reported this week suggesting that black people, over all, are not as intelligent as whites.</p>
<p>In an interview published Sunday in The Times of London, Dr. Watson is quoted as saying that while “there are many people of color who are very talented,” he is “inherently gloomy about the prospect of Africa.”</p>
<p>“All our social policies are based on the fact that their intelligence is the same as ours — whereas all the testing says not really,” the newspaper quoted him as saying.</p>
<p>In a statement given to The Associated Press yesterday, Dr. Watson said, “I cannot understand how I could have said what I am quoted as having said. There is no scientific basis for such a belief.”</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m not going to comment on my opinion about Watson&#8217;s original statement, except to say that I doubt there have testing that takes into account all the factors that matter in education, such as nourishment and culture.  I do note that being brilliant in one area doesn&#8217;t prevent one from being a complete ass in other fields, and that I can think of <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/quirks/archives/05-06/jun24.html">at least one Nobel laureate in physics</a> who was convinced Black people were inferior.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a data kinda guy.  Its what I do on a regular basis, its what puts cat food in the cats&#8217; bowls, and pays the rest of the bills.  Even as a hobby, I like data&#8230; posts in my Comparing Presidents series take a very long time to write relative to other posts, and I tend to manage to put them out at the rate of one a week, on average.  (Some weeks more, some weeks, like last week, none.)  </p>
<p>And yet&#8230;  I keep thinking back to something my father, who as a physics is himself a data kinda guy, once told me.  He was trying to explain to me how semi-conductors work&#8230; so <a href="http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1972/bardeen-bio.html">John Bardeen</a> eventually came up in the conversation, which led to William Shockley.</p>
<p>And then my father said:  &#8220;There are some things that its best for society not to measure and not to know.&#8221; </p>
<p>And I thought of that a few years back when there were the various studies purporting to show that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashkenazi_intelligence">Ashkenazi Jews score higher on IQ tests, on average, than other social groups</a>.  (Disclosure&#8230; I&#8217;m an Ashkenazi Jew, for what that&#8217;s worth.)   Obviously, there are idiots among Ashkenazi Jews &#8211;  I can introduce you to some of my relatives if you don&#8217;t believe it &#8211; but according to these studies, on average, Jews do better on these tests.</p>
<p>And here&#8217;s the problem&#8230;  if Jews do better &#8211; if that&#8217;s true, then&#8230; some groups do worse.  History shows it hasn&#8217;t taken a whole lot to justify, to allow, to encourage and even to demand the abhorrent treatment &#8211; from slavery to genocide &#8211; of certain groups.  Usually that&#8217;s been in the context of the group being perceived as inferior &#8211; using Black people as slaves was OK, you see, because everyone knew they weren&#8217;t entirely as human as White people.  The Holocaust in Germany was because Jews were bringing down the Aryan race &#8211; they may have been perceived as inferior in some ways, but superior in enough others to be thought of as a threat.  But these examples are everywhere&#8230;  racism is everywhere.  The Japanese haven&#8217;t thought much of non-Japanese, the Arabian peninsula has been cleansed (and kept that way) for over a thousand years, in Africa different tribes have been wiped out on a regular basis, etc.  </p>
<p>So it doesn&#8217;t take much.  And throughout history, charlatans and cranks have been enlisted to show whatever it is that had to be shown for the public to understand the need for the abhorrent treatment that was meted out.   Now, intelligence is a multi-faceted trait.  And there are all sorts of differences of all sorts of traits between various groups.   Which means that even if, on average all groups are &#8220;equally intelligent&#8221; &#8211; whatever that means &#8211; there&#8217;s plenty of room for those who will justify what they wish to justify.  And there are, of course, three added flies in the ointment&#8230;  The first is that evolution doesn&#8217;t seem to produce individuals or population groups that are identical, and the second, which grows out of that, is that individuals are not average &#8211; the world&#8217;s fastest sloth may not be able to keep up with the world&#8217;s slowest gazelle, but a faster than average German shepherd might be able to run with greyhounds.  The third&#8230; school children who are told they are inferior&#8230; perform worse.  Convince a whole generation of kids from group X that they are inferior, and the one outlier, and there are always outliers, who would have changed the world won&#8217;t.</p>
<p>So&#8230; in this context (I&#8217;d like to ignore other contexts for this post) &#8211; is this an area that it is in the best interest of society as a whole to pursue?  If not, could/should such a thing be discouraged?  On the other hand, can it even be something good for us to know, and how?</p>

<blockquote><p>The potential failure of the sixth Ministerial will actually throw the WTO into a deep crisis. After failing to launch the so-called Millennium Round in 1999 in Seattle, this current round of negotiations was launched in Doha, Qatar in 2001. A second ministerial collapsed amidst massive civil society protests in September 2003. Negotiations were supposed to have been wrapped up by January 2005, yet are still stalled on the basic framework.</p>
<p>If the framework (modalities, in WTO-speak) is not completed by March, it will be extremely difficult for negotiators to wrap up the technical negotiations in time to send the final agreements to the US Congress before the expiration of Fast Track negotiating authority in July 2007.</p>
<p>The sixth Ministerial of the WTO follows on the heels of another failed Ministerial, the Summit of the Americas in Mar del Plata, Argentina. The Bush administration attempted to use the meeting to jump-start the stalled FTAA talks, but the meeting ended without even a declaration&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>Is this a finale? Will the form of GATS continue in regional trade treaties? Will nation-states be players again as internal markets develop and give them more clout?</p>
<p>Will a world wide slow down affect responses?</p>

                                <p>Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is all over the news these days.</p>
<p>MRSA is a drug resistant form of a staph infection, and the deaths of young people have started a media stampede of spectacular stories. A few more bits of information (double checked with the world’s best nurse):</p>
<p>1. MRSA is not something new. &#8220;Best Nurse&#8221; dealt with it along time ago. It is infecting more young people. It can be deadly, or not.<br />2. My research indicates that MRSA does not kill more people than AIDS each year as reported (it is possible that the number of people who die with staph infections of all kinds is higher than AIDS deaths). I could be wrong.<br />3. Most people have some staph bacteria on their skin at some times.<br />4. Most MRSA infections still occur during hospitalization. Three reasons, compromised immune systems (lots of sick people), open wounds and failure of hygiene protocols.</p>
<p>So should you do anything about MRSA and staph in general?  Possibly.</p>
<p>A. If your child plays school sports or is on the Y swim team, call and ask about cleaning procedures in the locker rooms. Insist on thorough cleaning with disinfectants.<br />B. Check your child frequently for nicks and cuts, especially if they play contact sports. This will irritate your teens to no end. If you find a puffy spot with radiating red streaks, this could be a cellulitis infection – see the doctor. Otherwise be certain any wounds are clean and dab with triple antibiotic ointment – any questions, see a doctor. Lack of prompt healing – see a doctor. Any uncertainty – see a doctor. Persistent fever &#8211; see a doctor.<br />C. When you or a loved one are in a hospital, let it be known firmly that you expect all personnel, including physicians, to observe hand washing protocols. If they don’t, call the VP of Nursing and raise hell.<br />D. Teach everyone in the family that a fever is a message, and should be reported to parents.</p>

                                <p>I was dreaming about my lock on derricks and ports in Canada.  For the record, no one sold me Canada&#8217;s only main port on the Arctic Ocean. Mr. Broue bought it for $7 American. I bought the railroad that is the only link to the rest of the country(the Hudson Bay Railway)in my dream.</p>
<p>However, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/19/us/19arctic.html?th&#038;emc=th">the US Coast Guard</a> is setting up shop on the NW passage.</p>
<blockquote><p>For most of human history, the Arctic Ocean has been an ice-locked frontier. But now, in one of the most concrete signs of the effect of a warming climate on government operations, the Coast Guard is planning its first operating base there as a way of dealing with the cruise ships and the tankers that are already beginning to ply Arctic waters.<br />&#8230;<br />The pullback in summer ice has caused the Coast Guard, led by Adm. Thad W. Allen, to plan its first Arctic operating base, probably near Barrow. <br />VideoMore Video » With increasingly long seasons of open water in the region, the Coast Guard has also begun discussions with the Russians about controlling anticipated ship traffic through the Bering Strait, which until now has been crossed mainly by ice-breaking research vessels and native seal and walrus hunters.</p>
<p>The Coast Guard says its base, which would probably be near the United States’ northernmost town, Barrow, Alaska, on the North Slope coast, would be seasonal and would initially have just a helicopter equipped for cold-weather operations and several small boats.</p>
<p>But given continued warming, that small base, which could be in place by next spring, would be expanded later to help speed responses to oil spills from tankers that the Coast Guard believes could eventually carry shipments from Scandinavia to Asia through the Bering Strait. Such a long-hoped-for polar route would cut 5,000 miles or more from a journey that would otherwise entail passage through the Panama Canal or the Suez.</p>
<p>The Coast Guard is also concerned about being able to respond to emergencies involving cruise ships, which are already starting to operate in summers in parts of the Arctic Ocean. </p>
<p>And in yet a further kind of new activity abetted by warming seas, Royal Dutch Shell is preparing for exploratory oil drilling off Alaska’s Arctic coast beginning next year. </p>
<p>“I’m not sure I’m qualified to talk about the scientific issues related to global warming,” the Coast Guard commandant, Adm. Thad W. Allen, said in an interview. “All we know is we have an operating environment we’re responsible for, and it’s changing.”</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.arctic.noaa.gov/reportcard/land.html">NOAA</a> has extra credit reading and source material for the curious.  </p>
<p>Since the slope of the land indicates that oil reserves might be available for harvesting, my dream gets better as oil companies and soverign nations vie for position.</p>

<blockquote><p>THERE have been many proposals to deal with the problems in the mortgage market. But the best place to begin is by looking at the poor lending standards and weak consumer protections at the root of the problem — in particular, the troubling loans called 2/28 and 3/27 subprime hybrids. They have starter interest rates of 7 percent or more for the first two or three years, and “resets” that raise rates to as much as 12 percent, causing monthly payments to increase by at least 30 percent.<br />When housing prices were rising, borrowers could sell or refinance their homes to pay off the loans before reset and avoid crippling monthly payments. But this year, as prices have dropped, more than $150 billion in these loans have undergone reset, and an additional $300 billion will do so before the end of 2008.<br />Merrill Lynch estimates that if home prices decline by just 5 percent, a quarter of subprime loans may enter default, resulting in losses of almost $150 billion.<br />A government bailout is not the answer. Bailouts erode market discipline, raising the likelihood of repeat episodes. And efforts to expand refinancing options will help only those borrowers who have enough equity to refinance.<br />What happens to those who are unable to refinance and cannot afford the rate resets? Most of their loans are managed by firms called servicers. Typically, servicers sit back and wait for people to default, then foreclose and sell the properties. But in today’s troubled housing market widespread foreclosures will only maximize losses for servicers.<br />Renegotiating terms loan by loan is too costly and time consuming. Servicers have modified only one percent of these mortgages that reset in early 2007.<br />So subprime servicers should take a more standardized approach: restructure all 2/28 and 3/27 subprime hybrid loans for owner-occupied homes in cases where the borrower has been making timely payments but can’t afford the reset payments. Convert these to fixed-rate loans at the starter rate.<br />This would be no bailout. These borrowers would still be required to make their monthly payments — at rates higher than what prime is today. Billions in savings would be generated by avoiding the administrative, legal, marketing and other costs of foreclosure, which can run to half or more of the loan amount. And avoiding foreclosure would protect neighboring properties and hasten the recovery of markets burdened by an excess supply of houses.<br />The mortgage crisis is growing, and the mortgage industry has the ability to help solve much of it on its own. Subprime borrowers need a better deal — one that they can afford.<br />Sheila C. Bair is the chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.</p></blockquote>
<p>This advice sounds sensible, and would peg loans at 7-8% fixed.</p>
<p>She does not say how many mortgages fit the description as a % of the loans outstanding, so how that might solve the problem I have no idea. And with multiple owners of a mortgage that are bundled separately, how one accomplishes the process needs explanation from someone in the services. I wonder whether the market is so inflexible that it cannot deal with specifics, or the players are.</p>
<p>There is another article on Citicorp and other banks attempts at solving the problem from a high roller point of view.</p>

<blockquote><p>Can you tell me or post a blog on explaining why congress is wasting tax payer money and time and not to mention causing instability for the United States.  In my opinion this is why this country will not exist in its present form in the future because our congress, does not act as the voice of the people, they should be hung for treason, any senator that voted for this, this issue does not have any relevant meaning to the majority of this country!  here is the resolution:</p>
<p>In the last session of Congress, the Armenian Genocide Resolution (H.Res.316) had 160 bipartisan cosponsors and was overwhelmingly passed the House International Relations Committee.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m not going to answer the questions posed directly&#8230;  I&#8217;m merely going to note that this has become a cause celebre on the right.  Of course, the same level of indignation isn&#8217;t directed toward <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/10/noni-mausa-on-gw-and-dalia-lama.html">GW&#8217;s meeting with the Dalai Lama</a> which has caused similar rifts with China&#8230; but perhaps its thought we don&#8217;t need China&#8217;s support (and money) for dealing with the situation in Iraq and North Korea.  </p>
<p>That said, I would argue that the administration is already severely antagonizing Turkey, and acting in violation of our NATO treaty accord with them.  (Not incidentally, it also means that the administration is in violation of Article VI of the Constitution, for our right wing friends.)  </p>

<blockquote><p>The Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all and consequently they agree that, if such an armed attack occurs, each of them, in exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defence recognised by Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking forthwith, individually and in concert with the other Parties, such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area.</p>
<p>Any such armed attack and all measures taken as a result thereof shall immediately be reported to the Security Council. Such measures shall be terminated when the Security Council has taken the measures necessary to restore and maintain international peace and security.</p></blockquote>
<p>And here&#8217;s Article 6:</p>
<blockquote><p>For the purpose of Article 5, an armed attack on one or more of the Parties is deemed to include an armed attack:</p>
<blockquote><p>* on the territory of any of the Parties in Europe or North America, on the Algerian Departments of France (2), on the territory of or on the Islands under the jurisdiction of any of the Parties in the North Atlantic area north of the Tropic of Cancer;<br />    * on the forces, vessels, or aircraft of any of the Parties, when in or over these territories or any other area in Europe in which occupation forces of any of the Parties were stationed on the date when the Treaty entered into force or the Mediterranean Sea or the North Atlantic area north of the Tropic of Cancer.</p></blockquote>
<p></p></blockquote>
<p>So what does it mean that the administration has chosen to arm, train, support and promise to defend the very folks who are engaging in cross border raids against a fellow NATO country, that itself is living up to its NATO obligations?  I note that this has been going on for a while now&#8230; and predates the House&#8217;s Armenian Genocide Resolution.  And I repeat that by violating a treaty obligation, the administration is also directly violating the Constitution.   So why the dual standard?</p>

                                <p>From <a href="http://europe.theoildrum.com/node/3087">The Oil Drum</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>1) Crude oil &#8211; Latest available figures from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) show that crude oil production including lease condensates increased by 455,000 b/d from June to July. Total production in July was estimated at 73.28 million b/d, which is 1.01 million b/d lower than the all time high crude oil production of 74.30 million b/d reached in May 2005.</p>
<p>2) Total liquids &#8211; In September world production of total liquids increased by 450,000 barrels per day from August according to the latest figures of the International Energy Agency (IEA). Resulting in total world liquids production of 85.10 million b/d, which is 1.03 million b/d lower than the all time maximum liquids production of 86.13 million b/d reached in July 2006.</p>
<p>3) Status of the production plateau &#8211; Both the International Energy Agency (IEA) and Energy Information Administration (EIA) figures show that global liquids production has been on a plateau since 2005. The IEA figures result in an average global production in 2007 up to September of 85.03 million b/d, almost to the same as the average 2006 production of 85.00 million b/d and higher than the average 2005 production of 84.10 million b/d. The EIA puts the average global 2007 production up to July at 84.40 million b/d, slightly lower than the average 2006 production of 84.60 million b/d and the average 2005 production of 84.63 million b/d.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://one-salient-oversight.blogspot.com/2007/10/peak.html">One Salient Oversight</a> continues:</p>
<blockquote><p>The &#8220;market&#8221; is made up of people throwing billions upon billion of dollars around, yet they have no knowledge of these statistics. Peak Oil will be a classic example of &#8220;Market failure&#8221; in the economics textbooks of the future. Had oil been priced appropriately these past 5-10 years by an informed market, the negative effects of such a correction would have been easier to bear and alternatives would have been sought by the market to mitigate the coming peak. Why was the market blind to this? There are many reasons, but the major one is that markets do not always make decisions based upon rational thinking &#8211; even markets that have trillions of dollars at their disposal.</p>
<p>As Bill Paxton said in Aliens: &#8220;Game Over Man!&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>cactus here&#8230; I note one small mitigating factor&#8230; it may be with new refining technology, one gets more refined oil out of each barrel of crude, but I can&#8217;t see the, um, improvement being enough to compensate for that big drop either.</p>

President Bush takes it away:</p>
<blockquote><p>We found common ground on FISA. My only question is why change a good law? The way that law was written works for the security of the country. That&#8217;s what the American people want to know, by the way, are we passing laws that are beneficial to the American people. This law is beneficial because it enables our intelligence experts to &#8212; and professionals to find out the intentions of al Qaeda. Now, the law needs to be changed, enhanced, by providing the phone companies that allegedly helped us with liability protection. So we found common ground there.</p></blockquote>
<p>Emphasis mine.  </p>
<p>Phone companies allegedly helped the administration.  Allegedly?  The word alleged implies there&#8217;s a crime.  And if there is a crime, what is it?  Is that they, ahem, allegedly helped the administration?  How is that a crime&#8230; unless what the administration was doing was committing a crime?</p>
<p>And why doesn&#8217;t the President just go ahead and pardon the telecom companies anyway?</p>

<blockquote><p>I have decided to place a &#8220;hold&#8221; on the latest FISA bill that would have included amnesty for telecommunications companies that enabled the President&#8217;s assault on the Constitution by illegally providing personal information on their customers without judicial authorization. I said that I would do everything I could to stop this bill from passing, and I have.</p></blockquote>
<p>Something tells me that the rightwing water carriers for George Who Would Be King Bush will mount an attack on Senator Dodd’s patriotism.  It’s a shame that our current President does not believe in our Constitution.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Since AB reader Buffpilot is worried that the Senate will go along with what King George wants – let me turn the microphone over to <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2007/10/18/leahy-fisa-cave">Faiz</a> who notes that those opposing what King George wants even includes at least one Republican Senator.</p>

                                <p>This one is by Noni Mausa.  I found it interesting, given the recent brouhaha on the right about the Dems considering a bill dealing with the Armenian genocide. </p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>What is Bush doing with the Dalai Lama?</p>
<p>Okay, I know the Dalai Lama has been shaking hands with world leaders since he was thrown out of Tibet in the 1950s by the Chinese.  Or I should say, chased out &#8212; I gather he escaped through the mountains.</p>
<p>But what on earth is George Bush thinking or trying to accomplish in the honoring and hosting of the Dalai Lama at this particular point in time?</p>
<p>The more I puzzle over it, the more unlikely it all sounds.  Look at all the people that is bound to offend &#8212; first and foremost the government of China, who were reportedly furious, and who coincidently happen to hold an awful lot of US currency, which they could probably sell off cheap if they were mad enough.  Bye-bye USA, hello Great Depression number two.</p>
<p>And how about Bush&#8217;s fundamentalist base?  How will they feel about their president honoring the leader of the particularly unchristian religion?</p>
<p>Well, perhaps Bush is belatedly trying to impress other world leaders with how statesmanlike and tolerant he is.  I suppose it&#8217;s possible that that&#8217;s what he is trying to do, but I don&#8217;t think there is a hope in any of your choice of seven Tibetan Hells that it will impress any other world leaders who don&#8217;t happen to be Chinese.  or Tibetan. </p>
<p>Anyone have any idea what this is all about?  I sure don&#8217;t.</p>

<p>Correction&#8230;.  the post title originally referred to the Dalia Lama.  My bad.  I entered the title wrong.</p>
