                            </p>
                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Perhaps it&#8217;s too early to think about what the next recession will be like &#8211; it seems like just yesterday that we were in the last economic slowdown.  But while people may disagree about when the next recession will strike, the odds of another recession happening at some point are 100%.  (Personally, I&#8217;m guessing sooner rather than later.) </p>
<p><a href="http://www.thomaspalley.com/?p=41#more-41">Thomas Palley</a> ruminates on the likelihood that the next recession will be deeper than the last one:<br />
<blockquote>After having been wrong once, it’s either brave or foolish to make a second prediction that the next recession will be deep and difficult to escape. But the facts point to it being just that—despite the optimism of the Federal Reserve. This is because the economic factors that helped escape the last recession have been largely exhausted, and will not be available to fight the next recession.</p></blockquote>
<p>His argument rests primarily on two major contentions:
<ol>
<li>Fiscal policy will be of little help in getting the economy out of the next recession, since budget deficits are already very high.</li>
<li>Monetary policy will also be of little help, since the primary channels through which lower interest rates helped to sustain the economy the last time around &#8211; by giving consumers lots of extra cash to spend due to mortgage refinancing and rising home values &#8211; won&#8217;t be available in the next recession due to a slowing housing market and already-low interest rates on most mortgages.</li>
</ol>
<p>For the most part I agree with Palley&#8217;s assessment of the situation.  In fact, reason #1 is one of my biggest concerns about the fact that the Republican Congress and President seem to have no inkling of how to balance the budget, even when the economy is relatively strong as it is today.  Due to their fiscal mismanagement, the US economy will enter the next recession with little available fiscal ammunition.</p>
<p>There does still remain a possible channel for policy to help ameliorate the next recession, however: low interest rates could stimulate a boom in business spending.  Business investment never really enjoyed the strong post-recession surge that is typical of most economic recoveries &#8211; the present expansion has been unambiguously led by consumer spending, not businesses.  So one could argue that maybe after the next recession we&#8217;ll be due for a good boom in investment.</p>
<p>Regardless, I think it&#8217;s safe to conclude at least one thing: the next recovery, whenever it happens, will look very different from this one.</p>

                                <p>AB reader JC suggests that I reply to <a href="http://time.blogs.com/daily_dish/2006/03/what_id_cut.html">this post</a>.  <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2006_03/008464.php">Kevin Drum</a> already has:<br />
<blockquote>• Repeal Medicare prescription bill. (This is funded out of the general fund, so it counts.) This program only started this year and contributed nothing to the 2005 deficit. Total savings: $0.<br />• Abolish earmarks. Total savings: $25 billion, although I&#8217;m being generous here.<br />• Abolish agricultural subsidies. Total savings: $30 billion.<br />• End corporate welfare. This typically refers to special tax treatment, so abolishing it is a tax increase, not a spending cut. Total savings: $0.<br />• Legalize marijuana and tax it. This is so speculative that it seems faintly absurd to include it, and in any case it&#8217;s a tax increase. Total savings: $0.<br />• Eliminate all tax loopholes. This is a tax increase. Total savings: $0.<br />• Abolish the NEA: Total savings: $.1 billion.<br />• Abolish the Education Department: Total savings: $65 billion.</p></blockquote>
<p>For <a href="http://www.atrios.blogspot.com/">Duncan Black’s</a> reply, see his Wonking Sullivan: <br />
<blockquote>Let&#8217;s try to separate the things which are tax increases and those which are spending cuts.</p>
<p>Tax increases:<br />Repeal estate tax cut<br />A dollar a gallon gas tax increase<br />Eliminating all tax loopholes (?) and deductions except the charitable deduction.</p>
<p>Spending cuts:<br />Repealing Medicare drug plan.<br />Abolish agricultural subsidies.<br />Eliminate NEA and Department of Education.</p></blockquote>
<p>As Kevin pointed out, the Medicare drug plan was not responsible for those past deficits, which by General Fund accounting often exceeded $600 billion a year.  Also, cutting the Department of Education budget would either mean we reduce our investment in education or require shifting the tax burden for doing so back onto state and local governments.</p>
<p>But what about this from Sully:<br />
<blockquote>Means-test social security benefits, index them to prices rather than wages, extend the retirement age to 72 (and have it regularly extended as life-spans lengthen) </p></blockquote>
<p>Fine – if we decide to cut Social Security benefits in order to privative Social Security, wouldn’t that also imply that we would be reducing payroll contributions?If so, these joint reductions do nothing to reduce the General Fund deficit.  Of course, we could cut benefits and keep payroll contributions at their current levels, which should be seen as a backdoor employment tax increase.  </p>
<p><a href="http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/002086.html">Max Sawicky</a> notes that Sullivan’s recommended tax increases would go a long way to balancing the budget.  So, Sully is for tax increases on at least some of us.</p>

Kevin writes:<br />
<blockquote>Bush&#8217;s tax cuts haven&#8217;t touched Social Security or Medicare taxes (and both programs run surpluses anyway). They&#8217;ve been solely cuts in personal and corporate income taxes, dividend taxes, and capital gains taxes. These are the taxes that fund discretionary spending. Discretionary spending in 2005 was roughly $1 trillion. About half of that was for defense and national security, which Sullivan doesn&#8217;t want to cut. That leaves $500 billion, which funds the entire rest of the federal government. The federal deficit for 2005 was over $400 billion. So: if you support the tax cuts, and you don&#8217;t want to cut defense spending, and you want a balanced budget, you need to slice about $400 billion out of the $500 billion that&#8217;s left. These are round numbers, but you get the idea.</p></blockquote>
<p>If we are going to preserve Al Gore’s “lock box” with respect to the Social Security Trust Fund, the proper accounting of the Federal deficit is that General Fund deficit running near $600 billion a year.  So even if we eliminated all programs outside of defense and national security, we would need tax increases to balance the budget.</p>

                                <p>There has been a lot of recent discussion about how to measure savings. <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/the_thread/economicsunbound/archives/2006/03/rising_real_net.html#comments">Michael Mandel</a> defines the issue thusly:<br />
<blockquote>Real net worth per capita is household net worth, minus credit market liabilities of federal state and local governments, adjusted for inflation and population growth.</p></blockquote>
<p>Savings represents the increase over some time period in real net worth.</p>
<p><a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/03/record-net-wealth.html">Yesterday</a> I posed a question to him as to how he defines government debt with his answer in the comment section of his post as well as mine.  While my preferred definition of government debt would include the Federal government’s obligations to the Social Security Trust Fund, his does not and importantly should not because of how the <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/z1/Current">Flow of Funds</a> accounting defines household net worth.  </p>
<p>The error of my thinking as I formed the question goes something like the following intergenerational tale.  Let’s imagine some middle-aged liberal (like myself) who is hoping that the Bush Social Security deform efforts flop so that the Trust Fund reserves that I have been paying into for the last generation will be used to supplement my private retirement funds over the 2020 to 2040 period.  As such, I would consider my share of these reserve funds as an asset as I would consider the total amount of Federal debt – and not just the portion held by the public – as deferred tax liabilities for my generation and that generation of 20-somethings that include those young Republicans who for some odd reason support George Bush’s tax shift onto their backs.  But the Flow of Funds accounting does not include the Trust Fund reserves as part of household net worth and Michael is correct not to include the corresponding liability portion of the total amount of Federal debt.  As such the following makes sense:<br />
<blockquote>In 2005, real net worth per capita was $155.1 thousand, compared to $148.9 thousand in 2004 and $153.4 thousand in 1999 (all in 2005 dollars).</p></blockquote>
<p>Bottom line – the average (as in mean) American has saved a grand total of $1700 over the past six years.  That sounds about right to me.</p>

<blockquote>President George W. Bush on Monday signed into law a $781 billion increase in U.S. borrowing authority, making the Treasury Department&#8217;s new debt limit $8.965 trillion, White House spokesman Scott McClellan said.</p></blockquote>
<p>  We could have a morose contest; pick the date of the next debt limit increase.  Right now the US is adding about $600 Billion per year to the National Debt.  So it will take a little more than one year to add $781 Billion in debt.  </p>
<p>My guess is August 24, 2007.</p>
<p>I also believe the National Debt will be above $10 Trillion when George W. Bush&#8217;s 2nd term expires in January 2009.</p>

                                <p>Greg Ip of the Wall Street Journal interviewed Treasury Secretary Snow last week about the subject of income inequality.  From <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB114281167065802514.html?mod=home_whats_news_us">today&#8217;s article</a>:<br />
<blockquote><strong>Treasury Chief Says Many Benefit From Expansion; Some Data Show Otherwise</strong></p>
<p>WASHINGTON &#8212; Confronting criticism of the Bush administration&#8217;s economic record, Treasury Secretary John Snow said the widening gap between high-paid and low-paid Americans reflects a labor market efficiently rewarding more-productive people. But he insisted Americans are still broadly sharing in the economic expansion.</p>
<p>&#8230;Mr. Snow, a former CEO of CSX Corp. who holds a doctorate in economics, said the administration intends to publicly challenge perceptions that typical workers and families haven&#8217;t benefited much from the economic expansion.</p>
<p>Mr. Snow distributed a fact sheet that showed after-tax income per person, adjusted for inflation, rose 8.2% from January 2001, when George W. Bush took office as president, through January 2006. The sheet also showed that per-person net worth &#8212; total assets minus debt &#8212; rose 24%, unadjusted for inflation, from early 2001 to the end of 2005. &#8220;People have more money in their pocket&#8221; and in their bank accounts, he said.</p>
<p>&#8230;Other data suggest the typical family has seen little advance in income or net worth since Mr. Bush took office. Census Bureau data show median family income &#8212; half of families have income greater than the median, half have less &#8212; fell 3.6% from 2000 through 2004. Incomes for the poorest families fell even further. The only group to gain was the family at the 95th percentile &#8212; that is, richer than 95% of all families.</p>
<p>&#8230;As for net worth, a triennial Federal Reserve survey found that the net worth of the median family rose 1.5%, after inflation, from 2001 through 2004. That is far less than the 17% increase from 1995 to 1998 and the 10% increase from 1998 to 2001.</p></blockquote>
<p>Greg Ip deserves his usual kudos for providing some good context for Snow&#8217;s comments.  One additional thing that Ip could have mentioned regarding the rise in wealth is that it is not really true that Americans have &#8220;more money in their pockets and bank accounts&#8221;.  The level of real per capita financial wealth of US households is still lower than it was in 1999 or 2000.  All of the growth in household net worth since then is due to high house prices.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the administration seems to want to use the same approach to the problem of income inequality as they use with respect to Iraq: their goal is to change the American public&#8217;s perceptions of each issue, rather than to change what&#8217;s actually happening.   I suspect that their new PR offensive on the issue of income inequality will probably meet with the same success as their efforts to convince people that things are going well in Iraq.</p>

I have periodically looked at overall <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/10/kudlow-malpass-tamny-definition-of.html">household net worth</a> in real per capita terms noting that the NRO cheerleaders who periodically trumpet real wealth levels are ignoring the twin facts that both population and prices have risen over time. </p>
<p>I happy to point out that this cheerleading might finally be justified.  Well, not in terms of a record net wealth to GDP ratio as the first graph shows.  But then, let’s be fair – real GDP has grown since 1999 both in absolute terms and in per capita terms.  The second graph shows that real wealth was 7.9% higher at the end of 2005 than it was at the end or 1999.  And with population growth being 6.1%, the third graph shows that real wealth per capita was 1.7% higher at the end of 2005 than it was at the end or 1999.  </p>

<p>So is the average American wealthier today than he was six years ago?  Not quite for two reasons.  First of all,  average in terms of median is different than average in terms of mean.  Secondly, as <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/the_thread/economicsunbound/archives/2006/03/rising_real_net.html#comments">Michae Mandel</a> often does, we should consider the deferred tax liabilities from government debt:<br />
<blockquote>Real net worth per capita is household net worth, minus credit market liabilities of federal state and local governments, adjusted for inflation and population growth.</p></blockquote>
<p>But I’m not following Michael’s calculations.  Expressing real wealth in terms of 2000$, we had $153,311 per person in household wealth in 1999 and $155,965 in 2005 – an increase of $2655.  Federal debt per person rose from $20,404 in 1999 to $23,662.  So hasn’t our real wealth per capita fallen by approximately $600?</p>

                            </p>
                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Last week the Fed released its <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/z1/Current/">Flow of Funds</a> (FOF) data for all of 2005.  The FOF data keeps track of changes in various types of assets and liabilities for each sector (and many major industries) of the economy.</p>
<p>One piece of the FOF data that I find particularly interesting is the picture that it paints of household finances in 2005.  The following table displays the annual changes in the assets and liabilities of US households over the last several years.  </p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/household_balance_sheet.jpg"><br />Sources: FOF tables F.100 and B.100.  Note that this data is actually for households and nonprofit organizations.  Nonprofit assets are estimated to comprise about 6% of the total combined category.</p>
<p>A couple of aspects of this data strike me as interesting.  First of all, for the seventh year in a row, US households aquired more financial liabilities than they did financial assets.  Naturally, this is due to the fact that much of the debt taken on by households was taken on to buy real estate.  The escalating price of real estate meant that in 2005 the gap between the financial assets that households aquired and the financial liabilities they incurred was by far the largest ever.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also interesting to note that households (and their pension funds) were net sellers of equities during 2005.  Unlike in 2000, when the value of equities owned by households fell because of the fall in the stock market, in 2005 the stock market actually rose slightly, so the decline in the value of equities owned by households must be due to fact that households were net sellers of stocks during the year.  </p>
<p>Putting this point together with the previous point means that, over the past few years, US housholds have been shifting the composition of their assets substantially away from financial assets &#8211; especially equities &#8211; and toward real estate.  The following chart illustrates how households have altered their asset porfolio over the past 40 years.</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/household_portfolio2.jpg"></p>
<p>Some obvious features of this picture are the general trend toward holding more wealth in the form of equities (this includes mutual funds and pension account balances), and the large spike in equities as a fraction of household assets that happened in the second half of the 1990s as a result of the great stock market boom.  But over the past few years the dominant trend has been the rapid growth in real estate as a share of household wealth &#8211; to levels higher than at any time in recent history.  Households even have far more of their wealth tied up in their house than they did in the 1960s or 70s, when stock market investment was almost unheard of for most households.</p>
<p>Note that this picture vastly understates the role of real estate in the typical family&#8217;s assets, since the huge majority of equities are owned by only the very richest Americans; the typical household actually has just <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/03/state-of-american-household-finances.html">a few thousand dollars in equities</a>, so 90% or more of the their wealth is typically in the form of real estate.</p>
<p>An interesting question is why households have elected to put an increasing share of their wealth into houses in recent years.  I&#8217;m not sure I have a good answer to that question.  But put this all together, and it provides a reasonable explanation for the <a href="http://www.realtor.org/publicaffairsweb.nsf/Pages/HousingWealthHasGreaterEffectThanStocks?OpenDocument">evidence</a> that suggests that consumer spending is quite a bit more sensitive to changes in real estate wealth than it is to changes in stock market wealth.  The next few years may be an interesting test of this relationship.</p>

<blockquote>Protesters joined bagpipers, marching bands and thousands of flag-waving spectators at the St. Patrick&#8217;s Day parade Friday after the parade&#8217;s chairman compared gay Irish-American activists to neo-Nazis, the Ku Klux Klan and prostitutes. As huge, happy crowds lined the streets, the chairman, John Dunleavy, sidestepped questions about his remarks to The Irish Times. &#8220;Today is St. Patrick&#8217;s Day. We celebrate our faith and heritage, everything else is secondary,&#8221; he said before the start of the Fifth Avenue parade. Dunleavy set off a firestorm this week when he told the newspaper: &#8220;If an Israeli group wants to march in New York, do you allow Neo-Nazis into their parade? If African Americans are marching in Harlem, do they have to let the Ku Klux Klan into their parade?&#8221; Referring to the Irish Lesbian and Gay Organization, Dunleavy said, &#8220;People have rights. If we let the ILGO in, is it the Irish Prostitute Association next?&#8221; On Thursday, City Council Speaker Christine Quinn, who is gay, blasted Dunleavy for the comments. Quinn, who is Irish, declined to participate in the parade after organizers barred an Irish gay and lesbian group from marching under its own banner for a 16th straight year.</p></blockquote>
<p>Can we put this gay bashing aside for just one day?  </p>

<blockquote>So, every single Democrat voted against this. (Something to chew on for the &#8220;all the Democrats are worthless except for Feingold&#8221; crowd.) Here are the Republicans who voted &#8220;nay.&#8221;<br />Conrad Burns<br />Lincoln Chafee<br />Pete Domenici<br />Dick Lugar<br />Gordon Smith<br />Olympia Snowe<br />Jim Talent<br />Notice anything? Yep, three of them (Burns-Chafee-Talent) are in do-or-die re-election races. The other four are either not running this year or safe from challenge.<br />Here are some of the Republicans for voted for privatization that are on the ballot in 2006.<br />George Allen<br />Mike DeWine<br />John Ensign<br />Orrin Hatch<br />Kay Bailey Hutchison<br />John Kyl<br />Trent Lott<br />Rick Santorum<br />Hand it to Rick Santorum &#8211; he&#8217;s really not toning down his wingnuttery to save his job from Bob Casey. </p></blockquote>
