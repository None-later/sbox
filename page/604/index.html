<p>by Noni Mausa</p>
<p>From the online medical news resource <a href="http://www.medscape.com/home">Medscape</a>, a very rich source of breaking health news, comes this study from the World Health Organization on worldwide drug use. Once again, world leader America takes the Number One position!</p>
<p>****</p>
<p>U.S. Leads the World in Illegal Drug Use<br />Jennifer Warner</p>
<p>WebMD Health News 2008. © 2008 WebMD Inc.</p>
<p>July 3, 2008 — Despite tough anti-drug laws, a new survey shows the U.S. has the highest level of illegal drug use in the world.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization&#8217;s survey of legal and illegal drug use in 17 countries, including the Netherlands and other countries with less stringent drug laws, shows Americans report the highest level of cocaine and marijuana use.</p>
<p>For example, Americans were four times more likely to report using cocaine in their lifetime than the next closest country, New Zealand (16% vs. 4%),</p>
<p>Marijuana use was more widely reported worldwide, and the U.S. also had the highest rate of use at 42.4% compared with 41.9% of New Zealanders.</p>
<p>In contrast, in the Netherlands, which has more liberal drug policies than the U.S., only 1.9% of people reported cocaine use and 19.8% reported marijuana use.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>From the report: &#8220;Legal and illegal use of drugs was most strongly associated with age, sex, and income. Higher income was associated with a greater likelihood of drug use for all drug types examined, which is perhaps not surprising given that drug use requires disposable income&#8230;.The use of drugs seems to be a feature of more affluent countries. The US&#8230; stands out with higher levels of use of alcohol, cocaine, and cannabis, despite punitive illegal drug policies, as well as (in many US states), a higher minimum legal alcohol drinking age than many comparable developed countries.&#8221;</p>
<p>The entire Medscape article is <a href="http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/577082">here</a> and the actual report is <a request="'get-document&#038;doi=">here</a>.</p>
<p>****<br />Comment from Noni: For some time I have thought that the rush and anxiety and the &#8220;lean and mean&#8221; approach to business have acted to supercharge the US demand for various drugs, either to escape the anxiety (cannabis, alcohol) or compete more fiercely in a business environment where a successful, admired participant has many of the qualities usually associated with a person taking cocaine and other stimulants. (&#8220;He&#8217;s amazing! He gets by on four hours of sleep a night, and just LOOK at his energy! Let&#8217;s make him our CEO!&#8221;)</p>
<p>And now, with the air hissing out of the balloon of US disposable income, what will happen to the lucrative drug trade? I won&#8217;t even guess, it could go either way, and I suppose it will. Another blow to the GDP.<br />&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br />This one by reader noni mausa</p>

<p>(Lifted from comments cactus style)</p>
<p>I have reviewed the majority of American econ blogs during the past few days. Hit the supposed heavy ones again tonight. The econ blog subjects range from stupid to domestic but very few step beyond the borders of the USA. It&#8217;s as though the lights are turned off, except at home. A very narrow focus, indeed. Perhaps a selfish one. </p>
<p>There are exceptions, but damn few. This situation represents a ridiculous state of affairs in the so-called &#8220;thinking&#8221; of American economists, analysts, and others providing main posts on econ blogs. </p>
<p>I make this statement in light of the global crises and other issues facing the nations of the world. Not to be overlooked is the wording of the call for action that was issued directly to the G8 by the World Bank. </p>
<p>WASHINGTON, July 2, 2008 World Bank <a href="http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/NEWS/0,,contentMDK:21828803~pagePK:34370~piPK:34424~theSitePK:4607,00.html">World Bank President to G8: World Entering a Danger Zone</a></p>
<blockquote><p>For the first time since 1973, the world is being hit with a combination of record oil and food prices, threatening to drive over 100 million people into extreme poverty and reverse the gains made in overcoming poverty over the last seven years.</p>
<p>Some 41 countries have lost 3% to 10% of their GDP from rising food, fuel and commodity prices since January 2007. Over 30 countries have been hit by food riots, as the impact of the crisis reaches the household level.</p></blockquote>
<p>(quote added by rdan)</p>
<p>What part of that phrase and text communication is not understood by economists and others posting on econ blogs? Did they bother to read the article or listen to the news? </p>
<p>Will there be the usual phony or disingenuous blog posts and statements later on that &#8220;we&#8221; (&#8220;I&#8221;) didn&#8217;t see the impending disasters coming? &#8220;We&#8221; (&#8220;I&#8221;) didn&#8217;t know that the collective situation could lead to another World War over resources, let alone any war or spread of violence across struggling nations? </p>
<p>How many more phony excuses going forward do we need to hear from professionals and others who say that they understand or have a good grasp of global economic data and affairs? </p>
<p>If you can see it in the developing stages, warn your readership. That&#8217;s what adults and professionals are supposed to do &#8211; keep others informed. Get off your hands. Read. Think. Analyze. Inform. The American econ blog community needs to wake up and focus on the global crises and more serious issues than some of the tripe that is being posting across econ blogland. I say that with all seriousness. </p>
<p>The cartoons are over. Move to the main feature &#8211; the global economy which is in early stages of major crises that may result in significant social upheavel, economic collapse, and, ultimately, regional or global warfare. If it&#8217;s necessary to lean on the G8 leaders and call out the U.S. Presidential candidates, then let&#8217;s do it. And soon.</p>

<p>The next appears to say there is no such thing as a generational connection, and that the current surplus pays for tax cuts for services provided now.</p>

<p><strong>Update 5:</strong>  <a href="http://www.brookings.edu/~/%20media...scal_future.pdf">The Brookings Institute</a> has a well read paper on Social Security that confirms much of what we say.  Interpretation may vary on some particulars.</p>
<blockquote><p>MCCAIN: Thank you very much. I’d like to start out by giving you a little straight talk. Under the present set-up, because we&#8217;ve mortgaged our children&#8217;s futures, you will not have Social Security benefits that present-day retirees have unless we fix it. And Americans have got to understand that.</p>
<p>Americans have got to understand that we are paying present-day retirees with the taxes paid by young workers in America today. And that&#8217;s a disgrace. It&#8217;s an absolute disgrace, and it&#8217;s got to be fixed.</p>
<p>Now, how do you fix it? Now, how do you fix it? You fix it by reaching across the aisle, and you say to the Democrats, &#8220;Sit down with me at the table. Sit down with me, the way Ronald Reagan and Tip O&#8217;Neill did the last time that Social Security was in deep trouble, and that was way back in 1983.&#8221;<br />Ronald Reagan, a conservative president from California, Tip O&#8217;Neill, the liberal Democrat from Massachusetts, sat down together, and they walked out of the White House together, and they said, &#8220;We&#8217;re going to fix Social Security.&#8221; And they did, for about 20, 30 years. Right, Hank?</p>
<p>And Hank Brown and I were in the Congress at the time. And we were proud. We were proud to see the kind of bipartisanship that was exhibited for future generations.</p>
<p>Well, now it&#8217;s broken again. Now it&#8217;s broken again. Nothing is forever in America. I want to promise you that I&#8217;ll say to the Democrats and I&#8217;ll say to the American people: “Here&#8217;s a chart. Here&#8217;s how much is coming in. Here&#8217;s how much is going out. And here&#8217;s where there&#8217;s more money going out than coming in, and here&#8217;s where there&#8217;s no money left.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, are we going to hand it off to your generation to fix it? Or are we going to do the hard things? I want to be president to do the hard things. And I promise you that I&#8217;ll do everything in my power to make sure that not only Social Security but Medicare is addressed, and it has to be done in a bipartisan fashion. And Washington is broke, and we&#8217;re grid-locked by partisanship, and it&#8217;s going to change, and it&#8217;s got to change, and I will change it.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>T. Boone enters the fray big time. T. Boone Pickens has been talking about Peak Oil for some time. Now he is placing his chips on the table: <a href="http://cleantechnica.com/2008/06/08/t-boone-pickens-says-peak-oil-reached-plans-worlds-largest-wind-farm/">A Gigantic Wind Farm</a>, capable of powering over a million homes. The total cost for the oil billionaire: 10 billion dollars. He hopes the Feds will help with the tab. (Boone is worth only $3 billion.) While he expects a 15%-20% profit, I honestly do not think that at eighty years he is interested in the money. (I remember one reporter telling Boone that he was jealous of Boone&#8217;s wealth. Boone shot back: &#8220;I&#8217;d give it all for your youth.&#8221;)</p>
<p>Oil, he says, has peaked at 85 million barrels/year. That great sucking sound you hear is what Boone calls &#8220;the greatest transfer of wealth in history,&#8221; as over 700 billion dollars annually leave the U.S. for foreign producers of oil.</p>
<p>The moment is clearly right for his great move, with oil in $130 range. Furthermore, he is running a series of ads, talking about the entire problem. Maybe the public is ready to listen, instead of hiding its head in the sand.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>So 300 economists signed a <a href="http://johnmccain.com/Informing/News/PressReleases/Read.aspx?guid=c90681b9-5dfe-4de4-8057-ceedb30c228d">statement</a> that included:</p>
<blockquote><p>We enthusiastically support John McCain&#8217;s economic plan. It is a comprehensive, pro-growth, reform agenda. The reform focuses on the real economic problems Americans face today and will face in the future. And it builds on the core economic principles that have made America great.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’ve read the plan as has <a href="http://economistmom.com/2008/07/first-reactions-to-mccains-jobs-for-america-plan">EconomistMom</a> who asks:</p>
<blockquote><p>There’s now a list of economists who endorse the McCain economic plan up on the Jobs for America website–including at least a couple whom I greatly respect.  I would love for any of them to explain to me how they believe this plan realistically, and wisely, would eliminate the budget deficit in four years, and how any of them who might be less than thrilled with the Bush Administration’s record on fiscal policy can read between the lines (and fluff) of this McCain plan and see anything substantially different.</p></blockquote>
<p>McCain is proposing the standard GOP line that we can cut taxes a lot but not really reduce government spending.  When tried in the 1980’s and with the current Administration, we got the predictable result of lower national savings, which leads to less long-term growth.  Anyone who calls this pro-growth either does not understand economics or has not read the McCain plan very carefully.</p>
<p><a href="http://dyn.politico.com/printstory.cfm?uuid=06F63EAF-3048-5C12-004605D37EEB185E">Alexander Burns and Avi Zenilman</a> suggest the latter may be the preferred excuse:</p>
<blockquote><p>Upon closer inspection, it seems a good many of those economists don’t actually support the whole of McCain’s economic agenda. And at least one doesn’t even support McCain for president. In interviews with more than a dozen of the signatories, Politico found that, far from embracing McCain’s economic plan, many were unfamiliar with — or downright opposed to — key details. While most of those contacted by Politico had warm feelings about McCain, many did not want to associate themselves too closely with his campaign and its policy prescriptions &#8230; The McCain campaign’s economic team, led by adviser Douglas Holtz-Eakin and former eBay CEO Meg Whitman, began collecting signatures from economists several months ago, with the intention of showing support for McCain&#8217;s broad economic priorities, rather than the specific items in his Jobs for America proposal.</p></blockquote>
<p>Being asked to sign onto an economic plan before one has even had the chance to read it?  Pardon me – but I would never sign something under those conditions.</p>

<blockquote>while I&#8217;d ordinarily assume that economists signing on to &#8220;John McCain&#8217;s plan&#8221; were signing on to the actual document he had released, the fact that those 300 names were released within hours made me wonder whether all of them had had a chance to read the document itself.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>Food Shortages are real, dramatically <a href="http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/NEWS/0,,contentMDK:21828803~pagePK:34370~piPK:34424~theSitePK:4607,00.html">affecting poor nations</a> from Haiti, across the belt of Africa, through the Middle East, and on up to Afghanistan and Pakistan. Zoellick has asked the U.N. to exempt export restriction (i.e., hoarding) and taxation from the <a href="http://www.worldbank.org/html/extdr/foodprices/index.htm#slide">World Food Program</a> .</p>
<p>While the recent crisis in poor nations may well put over 100 million people into extreme poverty, the poor in all nations are at risk, from Indonesia to the those in the U.S. dependent on the food stamp program.</p>
<p>The causes are real; some are intractable; others, not: the high price of oil, weather, the shift to bio-fuels, and, I would claim, the patterns of trade agreements as globalization favors ever greater efficiency and larger and larger farms. As I noted in <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/05/local-or-global.html">Local or Global</a>, destruction of local food subsidies in poor nations has placed many of these nations at risk.</p>
<p>Zoellick asserts that the problem is man-made; therefore, it can be fixed. I take a more pessimistic view. Some of the problem is man-made; some is not.</p>
<p>High Price of Oil: Oil affects the price of fertilizer, the costs of transportation, and, surprisingly enough, the dependence on large machinery to make cultivation more &#8220;efficient.&#8221; This last is clearly debatable. But I would suggest that redirecting millions away from farms and to the cities may not be as wise as once thought. Clearly, it adds the cost of transportation to the food. Where once these workers were at the source of food production, now they are removed. If demand for oil is approaching available supplies, driving the price higher, then there is no short-term fix for this aspect of the food problem.</p>
<p>Shift to bio-fuels: Using crops and land&#8211;often subsidized&#8211;for the production of bio-fuels only exacerbates food shortages. In short, we need a crash program to develop alternate sources of power, especially clean and renewable sources, solar and wind and water&#8211;now, not some time in the future. Again, some will debate relative costs&#8211;oil vs solar or wind. I would argue that in the long run, we will have little option&#8211;even if results cannot be immediate enough to solve the present problem.</p>
<p>Weather: Think floods, i.e., our Midwest, and droughts&#8211;Africa. As global warming takes hold and extreme weather events become more prominent, then difficulties now will pale before difficulties later.</p>
<p>Meat: In some instances, using land to raise cattle may be inefficient, especially when feed requires crops that people can eat.</p>
<p>Patterns of Globalization: No country should ever surrender its food production to another. Local subsidies for food production should not be abandoned as part of trade agreements. (Think Mexico and NAFTA, as an example.) Nor should any country surrender all or part of its arable land to a large multinational that will seek only the highest price on the world market. (I was amused the other day at an argument over ANWR. Robert Kennedy Jr. pointedly asked an oil exec if ANWR oil would be for the U.S. alone. He could not answer directly.) Nor should any multinational control seed production, forcing farmers to buy its seeds. While globalization is important, how it is done is more important than just pandering to the to interests of powerful players whose only concern is their bottom line. Free markets that following only the path of greed will not work. All must benefit, not just the lucky few.</p>
<p>Collectively&#8211;and I mean all of us, rich and poor&#8211;must think clearly through all the issues.</p>
<p>Zoellick is right when he says the world is entering a danger zone.</p>
<p>Hoarding has already begun, as some countries place restrictions on food exports. Some countries are eyeing the arable land in other countries, hoping to use it as a source of food for their own people. Poor people are on the move everywhere.</p>
<p>Ironically, as we try to deal with this problem immediately, we may well drive up the cost of food, as food is re-directed to those most in need. But that is the price we must pay&#8230;you, I, and everyone else. Too feed those in desperate need, we will have to tighten our own belts.</p>
<p>Of all issues, food is central. If we fight over oil, imagine what we will do over food. Any and all of the successes of globalization (there are many) will vanish in the twinkling of an eye if we do not meet this problem directly and honestly.</p>

                                <p>I encountered the writings of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Klitgaard">Robert Klitgaard</a> twice.</p>
<p>I read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Tropical-Gangsters-Experience-Development-Decadence/dp/0465087604/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&#038;s=books&#038;qid=1214379949&#038;sr=8-1">&#8220;Tropical Gangsters&#8221;</a> an excellent book on his experience working for The World Bank in Ecuatorial Guinea which is not to be confused with the epymenus epyminus (oh hell I&#8217;ll never guess the spelling of that word ) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Tropical-Gangsters-Kid-Creole-Coconuts/dp/B0000647HY/ref=pd_bbs_sr_2?ie=UTF8&#038;s=music&#038;qid=1214379949&#038;sr=8-2">CD by King Creole and the Coconuts.</a></p>
<p>Years earlier, when I was a freshman I think, I saw students protesting &#8220;The Klitgaard Report&#8221; to the president of Harvard, in which he noted the fact (it&#8217;s a simple calculation) that African American students at Harvard had a lower GPA* than would be expected conditional on SAT scores. Brad DeLong, who actually read the report, says he detected no sign of racism in it.</p>
<p>Now obviously we all knew that average SAT scores of African Americans are lower than those of Euro-Americans so the SAT was presumably biased against African Americans (I mean if interpreted as a measure of smarts not assimilation in the dominant US cultural tradition). A justification for affirmative action which I personally liked a lot was that a reasonable prediction of performance would be standard measures (like the SAT) corrected for disadvantage. Thus I was most distressed by the Klitgaard report (not enough to go to the protest where Derek Bok talked to angry students as he often did because I mean he just did a simple calculation and the data ambushed him).</p>
<p>Now I understand. First lets assume that the cultural bias in Harvard grading is the same as the cultural bias in the SAT so race has the same effect on the expected value of the Harvard GPA as on the SAT score. Now note that an SAT score is the sum of the expected SAT score for that individual and a disturbance term which is specific to that test that day. The disturbance term includes did the student have a cold that day etc and also, if the student guessed on questions, did the student guess right. Fact is, if someone takes the SAT twice he or she will get different scores.</p>
<p>Given the fact that the distribution of SAT scores of African Americans is lower than that of Whites (first order stochastic dominance) if one has an African American and a White American with the same SAT score, one can rationally (and illegally) infer that the African American probably had a good day that day and the White American a bad day, that is that the expected value of the day specific disturbance is higher for the African American than for the White American.</p>
<p>Already this implies the Klitgaard effect even if the effect of race on expected SAT score and expected GPA is the same. The explanation of the Klitgaard effect is the same as Milton Friedman&#8217;s explanation of the fact that African Americans save more than White Americans with the same income (this is a fact). The same current income implies a lower expected value for permanent income just as the same success at demonstrating acculturation of whatever on a given day corresponds to lower expected level of acculturation to White America.</p>
<p>This is a general issue. There are many many empirical results which I found disturbing in which African Americans have outcomes like White Americans with lower incomes. All of this makes sense of important outcomes depend on permanent non current income. Of course they do. A huge amount of social science research on race and income was rendered obsolete by the permanent income hypothesis decades ago.</p>
<p>Of course that&#8217;s not the half of it. Even without colds and lucky guesses and such, the SAT is correlated with GPA but they are not measuring the same thing (whatever it is and whether or not either has anything to do with one&#8217;s real ability to contribute to the growth of human knowledge and the fullest flowering of humanity which they might because, hell, anything is possible). For example, in the SAT they gave us tiny little passages to read and it was wise to read every word. At Harvard professors don&#8217;t bother to winnow their reading lists so you have to quickly decide what to skip and what to actually read (unless you are Brad DeLong and read 1000 words a minute and never learned that skill and is <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/06/curses-foiled-a.html">suffering from that lack now)</a>. So for the same SAT score, one would guess that the African American student has more ability to read every word and understand compared to his or her ability to decide what to read when he or she doesn&#8217;t have time to read every word.</p>
<p>Ergo** Klitgaard effect.</p>
<p>Now even if the SAT has a particularly strong cultural bias so race has a bigger effect on expected SAT score than on expected GPA, the measurement error statistical discrimination bit can imply Klitgaard&#8217;s result if it outweighs the SAT is biased effect.</p>
<p>OK now sticking with GPA as our end point, I note that even if 11% of people who would get a harvard GPA over 3.9 (Harvard is different 4 is the max) are African American, this won&#8217;t be true of people admitted to Harvard if 11% of admitted students are African American. It&#8217;s that disadvantage and cultural difference and stuff makes the predictors of performance less accurate. Getting a student with an over 3.9 GPA requires that there be such a student and that one detects him or her and that you don&#8217;t have to choose between him or her and the son of a super rich alumnus who will give tons of money if you admit his son but it is neither gross class bias or bribery because Harvard is different and superior and you don&#8217;t understand and an institution struggling to get by with an endowment of only <a href="http://www.hmc.harvard.edu/">I don&#8217;t know how much more than $ 40 billion</a>*** has to make some compromises.</p>
<p>*Harvard called it something else like a &#8220;cube&#8221; because Harvard is superior and so it has a superior measure of grades)</p>
<p>** I never heard a Harvard student use that word except when denouncing &#8220;Ergo&#8221; a really dumb libertarian student magazine published by people who claimed some affiliation to MIT.</p>
<p>*** I note that the person who will <a href="http://www.hmc.harvard.edu/about_hmc/news.php">start managing all that money in one week, Jane Mendillo seems to be neither male nor anglo</a>. Another glass ceiling broken. Now she can decide whether to bail out a firm run into the ground by Jenna Bush like <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/headlines02/1010-08.htm">a predecessor of hers did for Harken energy</a> (high treason since Bush is a Yalie).</p>
<p>update: This post was more than usually incomprehensible. I try to explain in comments and here (same text cut and pasted)</p>
<p>Sorry my post was incomprehensible. The permanent income hypothesis is unusual in economics because it explains facts which seem very odd at first glance. It is not true (has been rejected by the data) but, in this case, the glass is half full (in others it is totally empty).</p>
<p>One fact which it explains is that, when one regresses log consumption on log current income, one gets a coefficient less than one, yet over time, aggregate consumption grows at the same rate as aggregate income. Another is that Blacks consume less compared to Whites than one would predict given their current income.</p>
<p>Both can be explained if consumption depends on income averaged over a long period (as it does according to the PIH) so current income is equal to this average plus a disturbance term.</p>
<p>Now the bit on SATs and GPAs has nothing to do with bias in the SAT. &#8220;Biased&#8221; is a statement about the expected value of a statistic.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s say there is something call it ESATGPA which causes high expected SATs and GPAs so SAT score is ESATGPA plus a mean zero disturbance and GPA s a function of ESATGPA plus another uncorrelated mean zero disturbance. Thus the SAT is, by assumption an unbiased measure of something to do with the GPA.</p>
<p>Now consider a group with lower than average ESATGPA. To avoid race, consider people whose first language is not English (hugely correlated with low SAT). Note I am assuming ENFL (English not first language) has the same effect on SAT and GPA so the SAT remains unbiased even if some people didn&#8217;t learn English as babies. However, given the disturbance to SAT, the best estimate of ESATGPA has a positive coefficient on SAT and a negative coefficient on ENFL (this follows mathematically from my assumptions). Thus people with ENFL will have lower expected GPAs than people with the same SAT scores and English as a first language.</p>
<p>Or forget GPA. Let&#8217;s say we are trying to use SAT scores from one day to predict SAT scores on a second sitting of the SAT. The SAT is certainly not a biased measurement of expected score on the SAT. However, Thus people with ENFL will have lower expected new SAT scores than people with the same SAT scores and English as a first language.</p>
<p>I assure the irritated reader that this is simple statistics. It also explains away a huge number of apparently interesting results in social science.</p>
