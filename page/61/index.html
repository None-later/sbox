                                <p>by <strong>Tom aka Rusty Rustbelt</strong><br /><strong><br /></strong><strong>The Unemployment Tax Dilemma</strong><br />When the economy is doing well employers pay both state and federal (backup system) unemployment taxes. The rates tend to be reasonable and are levied only on a portion of wages.</p>
<p>During recessions the employers who keep workers on are in effect penalized because all rates will likely go up somewhat. Many states also use an experience rate, so the businesses shedding jobs will be paying a higher rate in the future.</p>
<p>In the &#8220;great recession,&#8221; now dragging into a fifth year, the employers still in business are seeing accelerating rates, thus creating a penalty on employment (varies by state). </p>
<p>The system is designed for a &#8220;regular recession&#8221; and not for a &#8220;great recession.&#8221; How do we do this so we don&#8217;t penalize hiring? Ideas welcome.</p>

                                <p>As a many-times business owner, I <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/why-dont-shareholders-control-corporations.html">noted</a> a couple of years back that in the ecosystem of publicly traded companies, there is nobody who thinks, acts, has incentives like, or is really <em>anything like</em> a real business owner.</p>
<p>I’m pleased to find that Adam Smith agrees with me (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote><p>The trade of a joint stock company is always managed by a court of directors. This court, indeed, is frequently subject, in many respects, to the control of a general court of proprietors. But the greater part of those proprietors seldom pretend to understand anything of the business of the company, and when the spirit of faction happens not to prevail among them, give themselves no trouble about it, but receive contentedly such half-yearly or yearly dividend as the directors think proper to make to them. This total exemption from trouble and from risk, beyond a limited sum, encourages many people to become adventurers in joint stock companies, who would, upon no account, hazard their fortunes in any private copartnery. Such companies, therefore, commonly draw to themselves much greater stocks than any private copartnery can boast of. The trading stock of the South Sea Company, at one time, amounted to upwards of thirty-three millions eight hundred thousand pounds.*65 The divided capital of the Bank of England amounts, at present, to ten millions seven hundred and eighty thousand pounds.*66 The directors of such companies, however, being the managers rather of other people’s money than of their own, it cannot well be expected that they should watch over it with the same anxious vigilance with which the partners in a private copartnery frequently watch over their own. Like the stewards of a rich man, they are apt to consider attention to small matters as not for their master’s honour, and very easily give themselves a dispensation from having it. <strong>Negligence and profusion, therefore, must always prevail, more or less, in the management of the affairs of such a company.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This of course speaks to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent_principal_theory">principle-agent</a> conundrum that has been so widely studied and discussed, notably the pathological separation of ownership and control discussed in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Modern_Corporation_and_Private_Property_(book)#cite_note-24">Berle and Means</a>, <em>The Modern Corporation and Private Property</em>. (1932, revised edition 1967.)</p>
<p>But it’s nice to see Adam articulating it so nicely.</p>
<p>Modern corporatism is freakishly removed from, really bears no resemblance to, the fairy tale of “free-market” village butchers and bakers on which libertarians rest so much of their intellectual house of cards. (To quote my daughter’s high-school econ prof: “Econ schools should be teaching a lot more game theory and a lot less price theory.”)</p>
<p>It’s also worth noting that the Koch-brothers shop over at GMU and econlog, from whose “Library of Economics and Liberty” the above passage is copied, has never, in all those bloggers’ years of blogging, even mentioned this passage from their hero.</p>

<p>The Big C finally got rid of the inept hedge fund &#8220;manager&#8221; who finished destroying their franchise.</p>
<p>Of course, maybe this time they <i>will</i> replace him with Timmeh, instead of just pretending they will so he swallows more and harder.  Just in case Orszag isn&#8217;t enough.</p>
<p>Still not buying, but I would seriously consider closing a short position.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p><a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/10/the-1964-tax-cuts-and-economic-growth.html">Mike&#8217;s post here</a> got me thinking.  I&#8217;ll telegraph my conclusion.  He dramatically understated his case.</p>
<p>You  can see the long range view of nominal and inflation adjusted GPD  growth in Graph 1 of FRED quarterly YoY percent change data.</p>
<p>
<div><a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fredgraph.png?g=bPT"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fredgraph.png?g=bPT" width="400"></a></div>
<div>Graph 1 YoY growth Nominal and Inflation Adjusted GDP</div>
<p>Nominal  GDP Growth was in a secular up-trend from 1960 through 1980.  However,  inflation adjusted GDP growth quickly peaked after the Kennedy-Johnson  tax cut, reaching a maximum value of 8.5% in Q4 of &#8217;65 and Q1 of  &#8217;66.   It then dropped dramatically for the next four years.  This peak value  has been matched only once since: in 1984, during a sharp rebound from  the double dip recession of 1980-82.</p>
<p>Since then, in the  wake of numerous tax cuts, the rate of GDP growth has been anemic. To  get a look at the rate of growth, I took an 8 year average of the annual   percent change data presented above, and then plotted a 5 year rate of  change for that data.  This is essentially the 2nd derivative of GDP,  or GDP acceleration, as shown in Graph 2.</p>
<p>
<div><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-XajYJwVvVrY/UHx4117HgMI/AAAAAAAACBk/Wvu08AY0ENM/s1600/GDP+Acceleration.jpg"><img border="0" height="261" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-XajYJwVvVrY/UHx4117HgMI/AAAAAAAACBk/Wvu08AY0ENM/s400/GDP+Acceleration.jpg" width="400"></a></div>
<div> Graph 2  GDP Acceleration</div>
<p> Inflation  Adjusted GDP acceleration peaked in Q3, 1966.   Fueled by the inflation  of the 70&#8217;s, NGDP acceleration stayed high until Q1, 1980, then  plummeted for 9 years.  It has been relentlessly negative since.</p>
<p>Inflation  adjusted GDP acceleration has not done quite as badly in this  disinflationary era, but has been below zero more than half the time  since 1970.  This is a little bit worse than coasting.</p>
<p>This  all might seem a bit abstract, but the message is clear.  If tax cuts  were good for the economy, then GDP growth would be increasing.  In  other words, acceleration would be positive and most especially so after  a tax cut.  The data is not consistent with this notion.</p>
<p>Clinton&#8217;s  famous tax increase preceded increased GDP growth by either measure,  and an upturn in acceleration.  The Bush tax cuts preceded decreasing  GDP growth.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not going to get into a correlation vs  causation discussion.  I&#8217;ll simply say that tax cuts over 5+ decades  have been an utter failure at stimulating real economic growth in any  inflationary environment.  Since the real world data correlation is  counter to the received conservative wisdom, it might be worth trying an  anti-conservative approach. </p>
<p>It might also give the NGDP targeting enthusiasts something to ponder.</p>

                                <p>Richard Thaler asks exactly the right question. This from the latest <a href="http://www.igmchicago.org/igm-economic-experts-panel/poll-results?SurveyID=SV_6MzyqvYPzrjhYvb">IGM Forum</a> poll of big-name economists, on the effects of taxing income from “capital.”</p>
<p>I’ve been <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/i-was-wrong-there-is-a-substitute-for-investment-investment.html">over this</a> multiple times before, but it’s nice to see the thinking validated by a real economist. If you’ve got money, there is <em>no</em> (practicable) alternative to “investing” it. (Those are irony quotes: referring to “buying financial assets,” as opposed to “buying/creating real [fixed] assets,” which is the technical meaning of “investing” in national-account-speak.)</p>
<p>Or actually — there is one alternative to “investing” your money: spending it.</p>
<p>Are the neoclassicals really going to argue that if we tax returns on financial assets at a higher rate — so “investors” have <em>less</em> after-tax income — they’re going to spend <em>more</em>? I don’t think I have to cite sources to prove that they consistently argue exactly the opposite.</p>
<p>But just for grins, let’s say they will spend more. That would be great! They’d increase the volume of private money circulation (P*T, or M*V, your choice) — boosting demand for real goods and services, stimulating production, and goosing GDP.</p>
<p>And if we’re lucky, they’ll use it for investment spending instead of consumption spending. They get to write off those real investment expenditures against their taxes, after all. Not true with consumption expenditures, much less purchases of financial assets.</p>
<p>In which case — this seems kind of obvious when you think about it — taxing “investment” income will increase investment (while reducing the federal deficit). What’s not to like?</p>

<blockquote><p>I prefer not to think of all capital as the same.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In particular my pet peeve, the rampant confution of financial “capital” with real capital.</p>

                                <p>An acquaintance of mine who’s <em>very</em> statistically savvy (and quite conservative) posted the following link on Facebook today.</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2217286/Global-warming-stopped-16-years-ago-reveals-Met-Office-report-quietly-released--chart-prove-it.html"><img title="Screen shot 2012-10-15 at 12.04.13 PM" src="http://www.asymptosis.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Screen-shot-2012-10-15-at-12.04.13-PM.png" alt="" width="408" height="123"></a></p>

<p>I replied as follows (I’ve replaced a link here with a clickable image):</p>
<p>As a statistics guy, you know way better than most how important sample size is. There was a 30-year plateau in the HADCRUT data, mid-40s to mid-70s. But the longer-term trend is obvious and apparent:</p>
<p><a href="http://moyhu.blogspot.com/2012/03/interactive-js-climate-plotter.html"><img title="Screen shot 2012-10-15 at 12.08.37 PM" src="http://www.asymptosis.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Screen-shot-2012-10-15-at-12.08.37-PM-480x355.png" alt="" width="480" height="355"></a></p>
<p>(This is one just data set, but you can view and compare many others at this link. They’re remarkably similar. Try the rolling-average smoothing to get a less noisy picture.) For me the really big sample relates to arctic ice. We don’t really know when the summer arctic ice cap was last as small as it is now, but we do know that the last time it melted completely was approximately three million years ago. To me, if that’s just sort of happening due to random climate variation, over mere decades, it’s looking like a quite spectacular statistical anomaly.</p>
<p>I added: if he’s been saying this for years, he’s been basing those statements on even smaller sample sizes.</p>

</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Shortly after the Denver debate two weeks ago, I <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/10/a-kiss-from-used-car-salesmanand-why.html">wrote here</a> that I thought it was critically important for Obama to not only illustrate, using Romney’s own words and his campaign’s own acknowledgment right after the debate, that Romney’s plan regarding healthcare insurance for people with preexisting medical conditions was the status quo, but also to tie that in directly with Romney’s “47 percent” speech at fundraisers. (And, yes, that probably was his standard speech at fundraisers, not something he said just at <i>that </i>one.)
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>I said in that post that Romney’s misrepresentation on such an important issue—literally, one of life and death in some instances—demonstrates his utter disregard for anyone who’s not wealthy. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>I mean, <i>really; w</i>hat, in heaven’s name, kind of person has such little regard for others that he’s willing to play a semantics game—y’know, it depends on what the meaning of “plan” is—in order to mislead people about something of <i>that</i> sort?
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>As I said in my earlier post, many of Romney’s misrepresentations at that debate succeeded either because he was using common words in a misleading way or because he was making representations of fact that the public lacks the expertise to recognize as false.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>And two things the public does know is that you can’t get medical treatment for most illnesses, nor can you get standard diagnostic tests for most illnesses, at a hospital emergency room.  And that you do receive medical bills—sometimes ones that, for people who have no multimillion-dollar annual income from Bain Capital ties, may be prohibitive—from treatment in an emergency room or in, say, an operating room after arriving at an emergency room.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>And a third thing the public knows is that some people who have no healthcare insurance do die prematurely because they failed to get a timely medical examination and resulting treatments because they had no access to them at all, or because they feared, say, the loss of their home because of the resulting bills.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>So it’s terrific that since the Denver debate, Romney, as Paul Krugman <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/15/opinion/krugman-death-by-ideology.html?hp">details today</a>, has said otherwise. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>It’s one thing to try to fool people about what you mean when you say, for example, that as president you won’t decrease the “share” of taxes paid by the wealthy.  As the last two weeks has shown, you can get away with that as long as you don’t explain that, by “share,” you mean the percentage of income of the taxpayer relative to the percentage of income of other taxpayers, not the amount or the proportion of tax <i>revenues</i> that one income bracket’s taxes will comprise.  Twenty percent of $40,000 is $8,000.  Twenty percent of $1 million is $200,000.  As in, a 20% across-the-board reduction in tax rates.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>But it’s quite another thing to try to fool people about something that doesn’t depend upon what the meaning of “is” is, or on what the meaning of “plan” is, or on what the meaning of “share” is—and that <i>they themselves actually <u>know</u> is false</i>.  Just plain, flat-out false. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>But here’s betting that most of the public <i>doesn’t</i> know that Romney actually <i>made</i> the statements he’s made about the uninsureds&#8217; access to healthcare.  They need to be informed of this.  They need to be informed of this.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>And although most people will get it without an illustration, Obama should offer this illustration, nonetheless: Could Ann Romney really have learned of her breast cancer by showing up at an emergency room and requesting a mammogram?  Could she then have had the surgery and other, ongoing treatments?  And if so, would she not then have received a bill that, for her family, would amount to pocket change but to most families would amount to financial catastrophe?
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>And then he should offer this illustration: When Ann Romney began having the symptoms that lead to her diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, could she have just shown up at the emergency room for a diagnosis?  And for the intensive, ongoing treatments for it that have put her illness into sufficient remission to enable her to speak day after day about her husband’s kindness and caring nature, and about his ability to “fix” things?
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The importance of Romney’s recent healthcare-access claims goes well beyond the obvious.  Pointing just to those instances, Obama can illustrate this fundamental truth: Not only does Romney have a deep-seated disdain for ordinary people, but he views them as simply tools to be manipulated.  At an absolute minimum, this guy is the quintessential coward. </p>
<p>Yes, a <i>coward</i>.  His <i>modus</i><i>operandi</i> is that of a con artist.  And he’s doing this even about the most fundamental matters, such as preexisting medical-condition coverage. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>And, as Steven Rattner details in a New York Times <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/15/opinion/the-radical-is-romney-not-ryan.html?ref=opinion">op-ed piece today</a>, about a veritable <i>slew</i>of other critical matters.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>So I end with the quote with which I began, and with the reference to the person quoted: Joseph N. Welch:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div><i>Have you no sense of decency, sir? At long last, have you left no sense of decency?
</p>
<p></i></div>
<div></div>
<div>Obama could do worse tomorrow night than to use that quote.

                                <p>Comes to mind: the one about the two British ladies who meet at the Ascot races.</p>
<p>“My dear,” says the first. “What a lovely <em></em>hat. Where <em>did</em> you get it?”</p>
<p>“Oh darling,” says the second, looking somewhat pained, “don’t you know, we <em>have</em> our hats.”</p>
<p>It comes to mind as I ponder the rather grudging and tepid suggestions that you hear here and there these days — that <strong>excessive inequality might actually be a drag on economic growth and prosperity</strong>. There are some full-throated assertions of this belief out there, but in the mainstream economics community they are rare and in general quite decidedly <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21564556">mealy-mouthed</a>. (No names, just initials: <em>The Economist.</em>)</p>
<p>The general failure to question the “more inequality is good for growth” mantra has deep roots, even among progressive economists. <em>Viz</em>, <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/12/17/do-we-need-the-middle-class/">this</a> from Paul Krugman back in December, 2008, when the <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/robert-livingston-once-again-sheds-serious-light-on-our-current-situation-as-illuminated-by-the-great-depressioncondensed.html">highest inequality since The Great Depression</a> was was in the process of delivering the first (at least potential) depression since…The Great Depression (bold mine):</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>There’s no obvious reason why consumer demand can’t be sustained by the spending of the upper class</strong> — $200 dinners and luxury hotels create jobs, the same way that fast food dinners and Motel 6s do. In fact, the prosperity of New York City in the last decade — largely supported off of super-salaried Wall Street types — is a demonstration that <strong>you can have an economy sustained by the big spending of the few rather than the modest spending of large numbers of people</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This seems to completely ignore marginal propensity to consume (MPC) — that poorer people spend a larger percentage of their income than rich people, so a more equal income distribution would result in higher money velocity, hence higher GDP. (I have seen no indication that Krugman’s opinion on this subject has changed since then.)</p>
<p>But I’d like to suggest that the problem runs deeper. <strong>Almost all the thinking about MPC seems to obsess about income, and greatly downplay the role of wealth, or net worth.</strong> The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_propensity_to_consume">Wikipedia article on MPC</a>, for instance, includes only one passing mention of wealth.</p>
<p>This failure to consider wealth is important because <a href="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2011/03/29/business/economy/economix-29inequality/economix-29inequality-custom2.jpg">wealth</a> <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Screen-shot-2010-10-08-at-4.57.06-AM1.png">inequality</a> in this country (and worldwide) utterly <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/household-net-worth-by-quintile-62-09-be-prepared-to-scroll.html"><em>dwarfs</em></a> <a href="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2011/03/29/business/economy/economix-29inequality/economix-29inequality-custom1.jpg">income</a> <a href="http://motherjones.com/files/images/the-only-tax-graph-that-matters_0.preview.jpg">inequality</a>.</p>
<p>The Friedman/Modigliani rational-expectations lifecycle-hypothesis school does include wealth in their theories of marginal propensity to consume, but they assume that a great deal of people’s “wealth” actually consists of <em>expected</em> future income. This in turn assumes consumers’ excellent foresight decades into the future, and that people (at all income levels) are able or even likely to engage (accurately) in net-present-value calculations of their future incomes and expenditures.</p>
<p>There’s obviously a large literature on this subject that is ridiculously condensed above. But that aside: for thinking purposes I’d like to propose an admittedly simplified, opposite model that I have not seen discussed, in which <strong>current wealth (individual net worth) is the <em>only</em> determinant of (consumption) spending</strong> in a given period.</p>
<p>Imagine a world with eleven people in it, where we all <em>have</em> our wealth, and where net worth is broken out as follows.</p>
<p>Person 1: $1,000,000</p>
<p>Persons 2-11: $100,000 each</p>
<p>All spending comes from these stocks of wealth.</p>
<p>Now assume a very simple consumption function — a two-step “curve” — based on MPC (and marginal utility of consumption) thinking: propensity to consume for those holding more than $500,000 is 3% (because that satisfies their desires), while it’s 5% for those holding less than $500K.</p>
<p>Here’s how spending (Y, or GDP) plays out:</p>
<p>.05 x $100K x 10 = $50,000<br />+ .03 x $1 mil = $30,000<br /><strong>= $80,000</strong></p>
<p>Now change the initial wealth setting: Persons 2-11 have $50,000 each, and Person 1 has $1.5 million.</p>
<p>.05 x $50K x 10 = $25,000<br />+ .03 x $1.5 mil = $45,000<br /><strong>= $70,000</strong></p>
<p>By transferring half of the poorer people’s money to the richer person, we’ve cut GDP by $10,000, or 12.5%.</p>
<p>Then consider the <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/recessions-are-natures-way-of-keeping-the-little-guy-down.html">change in shares of wealth from 2007-2010</a>. Median net worth dropped by 40%, while the net worth of the top 10% went <em>up.</em></p>
<p>Even if you accept the notion that predicted income constitutes a large portion of people’s perceived “wealth,” the implications are the same. If more of the national income (the $80K or $70K in spending) goes to the poorer people, they will have more wealth in future periods, with the salutary effects on GDP and prosperity shown above. (If they expect that distribution to continue, it will even impact their estimates of their own wealth in <em>this</em> period, increasing their current propensity to spend/consume.)</p>
<p>And this doesn’t even consider declining marginal utility of consumption (or only includes it in a display of circular logic) — that somebody with a $25,000 consumption budget gets more utility from a given (percentage or absolute) budget increase than one with a $50,000 consumption budget. So a small percentage shift in shares of wealth from the rich to the poor, or vice versa, results in quite large shifts in shares of our aggregate utility.</p>
<p>A supporting argument from the personal-anecdote-as-the-singular-of-”data” school of rhetoric: all this holds true for me. I put away a very nice chunk some years back, and am playing the fairly typical “will I run out first or die first?” game. (It’s hard to say which is worse. How many people spend their last dollar on the day they die?) I’ve often joked with my financial advisor that I have one Key Economic Indicator: how much money do I have? That’s what I think about when deciding whether to spend. People nearing or in retirement start paying a lot more attention to wealth than income. (Related but tangential: not surprisingly, as the future gets closer and more predictable, as the kids get up on their own feet, for instance, “the <em>marginal propensity to consume</em> (MPC) out of wealth increases with the <em>age</em> of the consumer.” <a href="http://www.frbsf.org/publications/economics/papers/2007/wp07-01.pdf">PDF</a>.) And we have an increasing number of people in or near retirement these days.</p>
<p>If this thinking holds any water — that the distribution/concentration of (perceived) wealth has an important impact on aggregate marginal propensity to consume — there’s a very solid and rather straightforward theoretical basis for the otherwise largely limp-wristed assertions that we’re starting to hear more glimmers of these days in the mainstream media, and in the more influential sectors of the econoblogosphere.</p>
<p><em>Equity and economic efficiency are not in conflict. </em>Quite the contrary, in fact.</p>
<p>For those who prefer to look at pesky things like facts, the empirical data bears this out: at least in prosperous countries, <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/wealth-equality-and-prosperity.html">greater wealth equality correlates with greater long-term prosperity</a>.</p>

<p>The 1964 Tax Cuts and  Economic Growth &#8211; Paul Ryan Edition<br />   <br />During last week&#8217;s Vice Presidential debates, Paul Ryan stated: “Jack Kennedy lowered tax rates, increased growth.”<br />    <br />There was some commentary about Biden&#8217;s response (&#8220;Oh, now you&#8217;re Jack Kennedy.&#8221;) but just about everyone seems to miss what I think is the important point. Take a look at the graph below:</p>
<div><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-d6KUFM-_QCs/UHtoO9hI0wI/AAAAAAAABFM/zXa-uQe9MXE/s1600/Kennedy+Tax+Cuts,+Growth+20121014.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="192" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-d6KUFM-_QCs/UHtoO9hI0wI/AAAAAAAABFM/zXa-uQe9MXE/s320/Kennedy+Tax+Cuts,+Growth+20121014.jpg" width="320"></a></div>
