<p><a target="_blank" href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2009/05/tax-competition-why-it-is-not-a-good-thing.html">Linda Beale</a> has a take on tax competition and real costs hidden by gaming the system.  Who does pay for the US Naval protection of commerce in the world?</p>
<p><strong>Tax Competition: why it is not a good thing</strong>The Tax Foundation is one of those purported think tanks that preaches (I use the word calculatedly) a strong &#8220;free marketarian&#8221; ideology.  Most of the materials produced come out very anti-tax, anti-government, and pro-big business.  Most of the material makes one want more information about who is really paying the Tax Foundation&#8217;s bills.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, the Tax Foundation has now issued a &#8220;special report&#8221; challenging the Obama administration proposals on international taxation as &#8220;a step in the wrong direction&#8221; because they &#8220;would put U.S.-based companies at a competitive disadvantage in their competition with multinational firms based in other major trading nations.&#8221;  See Carroll, Bank Secrecy, Tax havens and international Tax Competition, Special Report No. 167, May 13, 2009.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s be clear.  When the Tax Foundation argues for tax competition among countries (i.e., lowering of tax rates and losses of revenues in order to attract MNEs from other countries to establish some kind of token presence, usually, in the low-tax country), as it does here, it is not arguing for a policy that benefits ordinary Americans.  It is arguing for a policy that would benefit major multinational enterprises located in the United States, ones that want the protection of the U.S. flag (and its flagships) but not the corresponding burden of helping to pay the price for the stability at home and the armed and diplomatic forces abroad that are so important to US MNEs when they do business offshore.</p>
<p>Similarly, when the Tax Foundation argues, as it does in the email message sending out the report, that the U.S. tax system is &#8220;out-of-line internationally&#8221; because it &#8220;has made no major change in its corporate tax in over 20 years&#8221;, it is just plain wrong.  When I began practice at Cleary Gottlieb in late 1995, there was a good bit of discussion in the Clinton administration and among congressional representatives about corporate tax shelters and the need to crack down.  Doggett began proposing his economic codification bill, but the corporate lobbyists were able to defeat it, time after time.  There was at the same time quite a long &#8220;wish list&#8221; of items that corporate lobbyists wanted to see passed in the tax code.  Many in that corporate wish list were  passed by the Bush Administration working with a Republican congress in the  2004 tax bills.  One heard there&#8217;d  even been an explicit tradeoff&#8211;the Republicans planned to pass their huge individual tax cuts in the 2003 bills (the one that gave the wealthiest Americans tens or hundreds of thousands in annual reductions of tax bills), and then the corporations will get what they want in the 2004 bill.  What kinds of things were passed to favor corporations?  How about the 2004 erroneously named &#8220;Jobs Act&#8221; provision permitting repatriation of long-held overseas profits at a pittance of the tax rate that should apply?  That was a meritless giveaway for no purpose other than lowering (even further) the already low tax liabilities of U.S. MNEs.  The US MNEs that had been &#8220;good&#8221; citizens, repatriating their profits regularly and paying at least some share of the appropriate burden, were stiffed by the competitive disadvantage created by this provision for the &#8220;bad&#8221; citizens.  Companies that had held out and lobbied for the repatriation provision were able to bring back billions with extraordinarily low taxation, and then plan to hold out on any further repatriation until they could get a similar bill passed again in the future.  The bill claimed it would create jobs.  But there was no job creation requirement for getting the low tax rate!  In fact, many of the companies that made a killing out of repatriating large sums at very low tax also laid off workers.  Similarly, the enormous expansion of the expensing provisions under section 179 and section 168 have provided a gigantic tax writeoff for U.S. MNEs&#8211;upfront expensing does not comport with the economic decline in value of property and operates as a huge tax cut.  The same is true of the R&#038;D credit and the &#8220;manufacturing&#8221; deduction. There have, in fact, been a series of provisions that are &#8220;tax expenditures&#8221; favoring corporations amounting to billions of dollars. All of these things the Tax Foundation glibly disregards.</p>
<p>The Tax Foundation argues too that the OECD harmful tax practices initiative is itself problematic, suggesting that the paltry amendments by various nations to their information exchange problems have addressed the issues.  Not so.  If it were true, we would not be in a battle with Swizterland to force disclosure of names, where the Swiss banks says they can&#8217;t provide information unless the request is made for specific accounts, but there can&#8217;t be requests for specific accounts if the swiss banks have served to hide the information from the U.S.  The information exchange provisions that the Tax Foundation suggests are sufficient, in other words, are merely window dressing.  They do not do the job that is needed to prevent wealthy taxpayers from hiding their assets offshore to avoid taxation.</p>
<p>Similarly, the Tax Foundation insists that low tax rates should not be considered a harmful tax practice because it &#8220;is a legitimate way to expand a nation&#8217;s tax base and increase the living standards of all residents.&#8221;  The latter, of course, is highly questionable in the case of tax havens like Bermuda or the Cayman Islands&#8211;those whose living standards are increased are generally the owners and managers of the MNEs taking advantage of the low tax rates to stiff their home country on the taxes due or the various parasitic law firms and others that make millions off of facilitating that stiffing.  Competition between countries for the business of MNEs who treat countries as fungible entities so that they can  pay labor the least and owners the most possible is not a public good.</p>
<p>The Tax Foundation also continues to compound the misrepresentation of the US comparative tax burden by emphasizing the  statutory corporate tax rate rather than the average effective tax rate or the overall tax burden in the US and other countries.  This is problematic for several reasons.  The US statutory rate provides a very misleading picture of the relative tax burden of the US compared to other countries, because of the large amount of subsidy provided to US corporations through tax expenditures.  Moreover, overly aggressive tax planning by large MNEs significantly reduces the corporate tax burden, since these sheltering transactions may not be found on audit or may not be adequately reviewed to find the aggressive position taken, resulting in companies paying taxes on a lesser amount of income than would be the case if the standards for reporting were stiffer and enforcement harsher. In fact, the average effective tax rate on large US corproations that do pay tax is substantially lower than the 39.25% combined national and subnational statutory rate that is cited in the Tax Foundation report.  Additionally, other countries typically have a significant VAT tax as well as the corporate income tax (and often many additional excise-type taxes).   Accordingly, the overall tax burden is very different from that portrayed solely by looking at corporate income tax rates.  The Tax Foundation claims that the same &#8220;trends&#8221; apply to overall tax systems, relying on its own study that looked at the effective marginal tax rates, and asserts that average tax rates is not adequate, since it disregards the non-corporate sector.  But this argument surely is a strawman&#8211;entities have a choice of form in the US.  There are advantages to operating in the corporate form, and a corporation that chooses those advantages should bear a fair share of the costs of providing them (from regulatory apparatus to general law enforcement to defense apparatus).</p>
<p>The Tax Foundation implies that US MNEs pay the high US corporate tax rate on their foreign source income.  However, that disregards the fact that US MNEs actually game the system to use foreign tax credits to reduce their US source income taxation&#8211;a reason for some of the rules proposed by the Obama administration.   </p>
<p>Tax competition is merely one more tool in the corporatist agenda toolbox.  It is not a public good, but a harmful result of globalization and the fungibility of money and, increasingly, labor.  Capital owners benefit, but everybody else loses when countries&#8217; ability to raise appropriate revenues from the business sector is undermined by tax competition.</p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2009/05/sachs-rethinking-the-global-money-supply.html">Mark Thoma</a> at Economist&#8217;s View offers a look at Jeff Sachs (in Scientific American) notions of the correctness of a &#8216;global&#8217; basket of currencies to be used as a substitute for the US dollar.</p>
<blockquote><p>China has now proposed that &#8230; nations peg their currencies to a representative basket of others rather than to the dollar alone. &#8230; U.S. monetary policy would accordingly lose its excessive global influence&#8230; </p>
<p>The U.S. response to the Chinese proposal was revealing. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner initially described himself as open to exploring the idea; his candor quickly caused the dollar to weaken in value—which it needs to do for the good of the U.S. economy. That weakening, however, led Geithner to reverse himself&#8230;</p>
<p>Geithner’s first reaction was right. The Chinese proposal requires study but seems consistent with the long-term shift to a more balanced world economy in which the U.S. plays a monetary role more coequal with Europe and Asia. No change of global monetary system will happen abruptly&#8230; We will probably move over time to a world of greater monetary cooperation within Asia, a rising role for the Chinese yuan, and greater symmetry in overall world monetary and financial relations.</p></blockquote>

<p>Michael Lind wrote an interesting article for Salon that was picked up by the New America Foundation under the snappy title <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newamerica.net/publications/articles/2009/lets_cut_social_security_pay_banker_bailouts_13489">Let&#8217;s Cut Social Security to Pay for Banker Bailouts!</a>. In it he outlines arguments that will be familiar to followers of Angry Bear&#8217;s Social Security coverage, notably pointing out the &#8216;message&#8217; campaign outlined by Stuart Butler and Peter Germanis in 1983 with the publication of &#8216;Social Security Reform: Achieving a &#8216;Leninist&#8217; Strategy&#8217;, something discussed here last May.<a target="_blank" href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/05/bw-on-soc-sec-v-what-does-lenin-have-to.html">What does Lenin have to do with it?</a> Well this caused Andrew Biggs to strike back at what Biggs calls &#8220;lefty claptrap&#8221; in his own article <a target="_blank" href="http://www.american.com/archive/2009/may-2009/the-straw-men-of-social-security">The Strawmen of Social Security</a>. In the course of this he refers us to this SSA Actuarial Note with its own snappy title <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/NOTES/ran5/an2008-5.pdf">INTERNAL REAL RATES OF RETURN UNDER THE OASDI PROGRAM FOR HYPOTHETICAL WORKERS</a> He summarizes it as follows:<br />
<blockquote>First, fairness: Social Security’s treatment of different generations of Americans is declining, such that those who retire in the near future will receive much higher benefits relative to their taxes than those who retire later. For instance, this study from the Social Security Administration shows that a typical couple retiring today will receive around a 2.3 percent rate of return from Social Security, while a typical couple retiring in 2050 will receive around a 1.7 percent return. Compounded over a full career of paying taxes, these differences amount to a lot. By acting today, we can lower returns a little for near-retirees so we do not need to hit future retirees as hard.</p></blockquote>
<p> Is that a fair summary of the Note? Well no, that is in fact a strawman so flimsy that you don&#8217;t know if it will burn up or simply blow away. For example what the hell does &#8216;typical&#8217; mean in context?</p>
<p>To answer that we need to look at the data tables. Reproduced below the fold.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/ShGfSSSJClI/AAAAAAAAAOE/LmTfWbL-oxg/s1600-h/Actuarial+Note+Table+4-5.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/ShGfSSSJClI/AAAAAAAAAOE/LmTfWbL-oxg/s400/Actuarial+Note+Table+4-5.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/ShGfSWuC1SI/AAAAAAAAAOM/cbrtwHBgViE/s1600-h/Actuarial+Note+Table+6.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/ShGfSWuC1SI/AAAAAAAAAOM/cbrtwHBgViE/s400/Actuarial+Note+Table+6.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />So where is our typical couple? Well you won&#8217;t find them, in fact the whole point of the study was to see how Social Security performs for all couples across generations. And it turns out that depends a lot on where that couple is situated. For example for our hypothetical couple retiring today if either husband or wife have incomes classified as &#8216;low&#8217; or &#8216;very&#8217; low their Internal Real Rate of return ranges from 3.0 to 4.6%. In order to get a return at Biggs&#8217; level you would have to have a combination of &#8216;medium&#8217; and &#8216;medium&#8217;. Now while it is possible that medium + medium = median = mean and so &#8216;typical&#8217; is how Biggs read the situation. But aan examination of Table A shows that &#8216;medium&#8217; is defined as $38,651 meaning a household wage income of $77 thousand which is significantly above median household income. For Biggs it seems that &#8216;typical&#8217; means comfortably middle class (and yes, yes, yes I know people say you can&#8217;t live in LA or NY on less than $300,000, that doesn&#8217;t make them &#8216;typical&#8217;).</p>
<p>So when I look at these tables I take away a very different lesson.  Social Security has been a really good deal for those making under the median and a great deal for those nearer the bottom. On the other hand if you or your spouse or both have &#8216;high&#8217; incomes defined as $62 thousand a year it is a only kinda good deal. If you restrict yourself to this narrow measure. But as the authors of the actual note tell us (bolding mine):<br />
<blockquote>Because the Social Security program has operated on a largely pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) basis, the level of contributions of each generation of workers is not directly related to the benefits they will receive. Under a PAYGO plan, benefits are not based on the accumulation of individual contributions, as in a defined contribution plan, nor are annual contributions determined based on scheduled future benefits of current workers and beneficiaries, as in an advance-funded defined benefit plan. <br />Rather, the combined amount of contributions from workers and employers needed to fund the system is largely determined by the total amount of benefits to be paid for any year. Thus, internal rates of return for a PAYGO-financed benefit program are only theoretical indicators of the apparent value for contributions on an individual or cohort basis. On this <br />basis, with administrative expenses of less than 1 percent of total program cost, the real value of OASDI benefits is extraordinarily high. <br />Internal rate of return does not reflect the full value of insurance in reducing the risk for extreme outcomes, such as death or disability at very young ages or survival to very old ages. In addition, calculations of the internal rate of return from Social Security benefits are not fully adequate for making comparisons with private-sector plans, since many features of Social Security benefits are not typically available in private-sector plans. Examples include guaranteed cost-of-living adjustments <br />based on the Consumer Price Index, and benefits for life in the event of disability. However, internal rates of return are of value for exploring the relative value of benefits provided across generations and types of workers. </p></blockquote>
<p> Oh and that future &#8216;typical&#8217; couple retiring in 2050 who are only getting 1.7% per Biggs? Turns out that includes only those couples whose incomes BOTH score as &#8216;high&#8217;. If you both score &#8216;very low&#8217;? The new retired couple of today? 4.61%. The trampled on retirees of 2050? 4.54%. Man the intergenerational inequity just screams out here. Not.</p>
<p>So that funny smell is some combination of freshly picked cherries and straw burning up.</p>

<blockquote>It’s not just reputations that are on the line. Board members, also known as directors, could be held personally liable for a bank’s demise.</p>
<p>Experts are expecting a wave of lawsuits against directors to be filed in Georgia over the next year or two as regulators and shareholders seek someone to blame — and someone to pay — for the state’s bank failures.</p>
<p>Eleven Georgia banks have failed in the past eight months, the most in the country, and experts say many more troubled institutions are in danger of being shut down.</p></blockquote>

<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2009/05/no-country-middle-aged-men">Middle aged men</a> and pensions in the industries. Much wealth has vanished&#8230;I notice a lot of apathy among employees such as teachers whose state plans have not declared losses yet except generally.  The MA plan declared a 29% &#8220;loss&#8221; in value, but I have yet to see a clear statement about what the &#8220;loss&#8221; implies, how much is perhaps permanent as in owning worthless paper, and how current revenue can handle the next few years of retirements of boomers.  Can anyone help out in this evaluation? </p>
<blockquote><p>All over the country, pensions guaranteed by union-negotiated contracts are vanishing into thin air, casualties of bankruptcy, economic upheaval, and flawed legislation. Pensions have turned to dust at airlines (United, Delta), steel companies (Bethlehem), textile makers, and even electronics companies like Polaroid. The Big Three and their suppliers may roll back pension plans that support hundreds of thousands of retirees and their families. Entire towns have seen their economic base disappear; in Kannapolis, North Carolina, home to the textile maker Pillowtex Corporation, 23,000 private pensions were wiped out overnight when the company went bankrupt in 2003.</p>
<p>For workers whose pensions vanish, the only safety net is the federal Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, an insurance fund financed by employer premiums. Today, 1.3 million workers rely on the federal government to pay pensions that their employers no longer can or will pay; the number has more than doubled in the past eight years, and it keeps rising. <strong>The pbgc, its investments battered by the stock market crash, is now deep in the red, with a deficit of more than $11 billion instead of the $9.7 billion surplus it had in 2000.</strong></p>
<p>But there is a growing population of workers whom the pbgc can&#8217;t fully compensate: those in heavy-labor industries, where bodies wear out long before the traditional retirement age, and where retirement typically starts in a worker&#8217;s mid-50s. When these companies bail on their pensions, the pbgc often offers significantly less. It also doesn&#8217;t cover health insurance, an essential benefit to workers who don&#8217;t qualify for Medicare and who often have children still at home.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a frightful societal development,&#8221; says Bill Brandt, a Chicago-based financial consultant who has served as a trustee during numerous bankruptcy proceedings. Between the disappearing pensions, slim prospects for new jobs, and vanished medical benefits, middle-aged workers like Hazel &#8220;will discover it&#8217;s the beginning of a very sordid story for the rest of their lives.&#8221;</p>
<p>In Longview, retirement promises were only the last to be broken. In 2000, the world&#8217;s largest aluminum producer, Alcoa, Inc. (then run by Paul O&#8217;Neill, whom George W. Bush would soon appoint as treasury secretary), had bought out the foundry&#8217;s owner, Reynolds Metals. But Alcoa quickly found itself embroiled in an antitrust battle, which required it to sell part of its stake in Reynolds; it also realized that the Longview plant used obsolete, polluting technology—&#8221;we were dinosaurs in the mud,&#8221; says one ex-worker bitterly—and that the plant was full of men whose pension and health ious were coming due.</p></blockquote>
