                                <p>There is a amazing piece in Forbes that Tim Worstall (also at Forbes) notes reporting on scary news that is misleading:</p>
<blockquote><p>I’m very confused by this piece from fellow Forbes contributor <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/rickungar/2011/12/02/the-bomb-buried-in-obamacare-explodes-today-halleluja/">Rick Ungar</a>. He tells us that there’s a bomb buried in Obamacare (or more formally, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act) and that it’s just gone off. Further, that it will mean the end of private, for profit, health care insurance on any large scale: whatever remains will be just a luxury item for those who like to beat the queues as such insurance is in the UK where we have the NHS.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/">Angry Bear&#8217;s Bruce Webb</a> noted the MLR in the legislation on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2009/07/hr3200-sec-116-golden-bullet-or-smoking.html%22">July 28, 2009</a> (and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/01/mlr-provisions-kick-in-today.html">here </a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2009/12/medical-loss-ratio-revisited-cost-and.html">here</a>), among the first to offer analysis, but hardly a surprise now.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />Tim [edited for clarity] quotes Ungar and then refutes:
</p>
<blockquote><blockquote>That would be the provision of the law, called the medical loss ratio, that requires health insurance companies to spend 80% of the consumers’ premium dollars they collect—85% for large group insurers—on actual medical care rather than overhead, marketing expenses and profit. Failure on the part of insurers to meet this requirement will result in the insurers having to send their customers a rebate check representing the amount in which they underspend on actual medical care.
<p>This is the true ‘bomb’ contained in Obamacare and the one item that will have more impact on the future of how medical care is paid for in this country than anything we’ve seen in quite some time. Indeed, it is this aspect of the law that represents the true ‘death panel’ found in Obamacare—but not one that is going to lead to the death of American consumers. Rather, the medical loss ratio will, ultimately, lead to the death of large parts of the private, for-profit health insurance industry.</p>
<p>Why? Because there is absolutely no way for-profit health insurers are going to be able to learn how to get by and still make a profit while being forced to spend at least 80 percent of their receipts providing their customers with the coverage for which they paid.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What confuses me here is that in a competitive market it’s entirely normal for an insurer to have a loss ratio higher than 80%. There are plenty of entirely profitable and growing insurance companies that have loss ratios over 100%. So I cannot really understand why the law insisting on an MLR of 80% (or 85% in the large group market) is going to cause all for profit insurance companies to fall over.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now of course one wonders what is important in addition to this scarey announcement of a medical cost bomb? Issues of accounting for expenses, a more recent mlr formula that is more permissive, enforcement issues.  And even why the ratios may be central as a part of the legislation. Another post of course.</p>

                                <p><a target="_blank" href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2011/12/demographic-shift.html">Via Mark Thoma</a> Tim Duy looks at reporting that misses the point even though information can be teased out of the piece.  The article can be found <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-12-06/drop-in-u-s-unemployment-rate-early-sign-of-coming-labor-shift-economy.html">here</a>.<br />
<blockquote>
<p>I think the article would have felt better if it began not with the impression that baby boomers are the driving force behind recent declines in the participation rate, but could be more of an influence in over time. This, I sense, is what Maki really wants to say:</p>
<blockquote><p>The effect of the baby-boomer exit from the labor force will become more evident in the coming decade, Maki said. The policy implications may be more pressing, as Fed officials keep interest rates near record low levels for longer than may be required given the likely drop in the jobless rate. That may fuel price pressures in the economy, he said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then again, maybe not:</p>
<p> <a name="more"></a><br />
<blockquote>
<p>“It means there is less slack in the economy than is commonly perceived, and the slack will diminish more quickly than people think,” Maki said. As a result, “there are more inflationary risks with the very accommodative monetary policy we have now than one might believe.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think the near-term reality is a little less dire. And the article eventually gets there:</p>
<blockquote><p>To be sure, the outlook for jobs may brighten as the economic expansion develops, drawing more people back into the workforce and limiting declines in unemployment. In addition, some economists argue that retiring baby boomers may not be the best explanation for the decrease already in train in the participation rate.</p>
<p>“Demographic trends are pushing down, over time, the normal labor force participation rate,” said Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan Chase &#038; Co. in New York. Nonetheless, he said, “the speed of the decline seen this year is in excess of what one would expect just given the demographic trend.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A much more measured analysis, one I think consistent with the data. <strong>Too bad it wasn&#8217;t the central point of the story. </strong>Yes, demographic shifts are likely to put downward pressure on labor force participation rates. But the tendency for those 65 and older to work longer than expected pushes in the other direction. Moreover, an improving economy would also increase labor force participation, especially among younger workers. Simply put, the aging of the baby boomers is just one of many factors currently influencing labor force participation rates and, by extension, the amount of slack in the labor markets. (bolding is mine)</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t want to make this a daily feature but <a target="_blank" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/european-leaders-gather-at-summit-to-save-the-euro/2011/12/07/gIQAzxrFdO_story_1.html">Anthony Faiola and Michael Birnbaum</a> made it hard for me to get past The Washington Post (my home page) without an angry blog post. In what is supposed to be a news article, they make a false claim of fact. They do not point to any supporting evidence (nor could they as their claim is plainly false) nor do they quote even a self appointed expert.   </p>
<p>Their claim that &#8220;Europe’s crisis now is as much political as economic. It stems from a legacy of overspending and overborrowing, but &#8230;&#8221; is false. Spain and Ireland were running budget surpluses and had a debt to GDP ratio lower than Germany&#8217;s. Italy had a primary surplus and declining debt to GDP ratio. Germany happens to be the one and only country allowed to adopt the Euro in spite of not meeting the Maastricht conditions (which shows how stupid those rules were).   </p>
<p>Now, I suppose that the claim is vague enough to be not proven false &#8212; they didn&#8217;t write public &#8220;overspending and over borrowing.&#8221; Indeed the root cause of most of the crisis, here in Europe as well as in the USA, ws a combination of banking deregulation and banker&#8217;s errors.  <br />Here I think the problem is that they consider the sentence which I truncated to be a claim that the problem isn&#8217;t just over public spending and under taxing by Greece and Portugal. They go on to criticize Germany &#8220;but &#8230; it also reflects a lack of investor faith in the will of financially solid nations such as Germany to unite behind their troubled neighbors to shore up the currency union.&#8221; so they can&#8217;t say that the German position is total nonsense. That would be unBallancelicht.   </p>
<p>But the German claims are false.</p>

<p>Actually, the Obama Administration has been making it Really Effing Easy for Its Base to Mobilize since around the time Tim Geithner was appointed.  That mobilization is just away from the voting booth and onto the streets.</p>
<p>Give You a Hint, Barry:  When even Scott Lemieux, who will forgive you any inaction, <a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2011/12/the-plan-b-disgrace">takes you to the woodshed</a>, you will deserve to lose.</p>
<p>That you&#8217;ll take the country down with you is <em>not</em> &#8220;collateral damage,&#8221; though.</p>

                                <p>Yves Smith spells out her strong opinion of our dilemma nationally for the elections of 2012. This particular arena of regulating banks and non banks and and accountability also takes on a wider symbolic meaning in this election cycle.  How this plays out in determining national budget spending priorities through the lens of an explosion of money spent on national and state elections makes for a need for voters to pay close attention to actual issues and to gain some knowledge underlying economic understanding&#8230;a complicated task for a potentially interested public.  We in Mass. have another election to follow closely through Elizabeth Warren, who has a different take on the issues.

<blockquote><p>&#8230;So let’s return to the rebranding of Obama. From the <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/64fd5abc-2042-11e1-8462-00144feabdc0.html#ixzz1fqUwRF2A">Financial Times</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Barack Obama outlined a plan to toughen penalties against banks that commit fraud in a speech on Tuesday that hardened his attacks on Republicans for “collective amnesia” in backing policies that caused the financial crisis and economic downturn.</p>
<p>Speaking in Osawatomie, Kansas, Mr Obama summoned the spirit of another president, Teddy Roosevelt, who spoke in the same city a century ago about his “new nationalism” and the need for a fairer system that supported the middle class..</p>
<p>Mr Obama was scathing about the banks’ opposition to new financial regulations, saying they were only feared by “financial institutions whose business model is built on breaking the law, cheating consumers or making risky bets that could damage the entire economy”.</p>
<p> <a name="more"></a>
<p>“I’ll be calling for legislation that makes [anti-fraud] penalties count – so that firms don’t see punishment for breaking the law as just the price of doing business.”</p>

<p>The misdirection is blindingly obvious. The claim is that the Administration needs new tools to get tough on banks. No, it has plenty of tools, starting with Sarbanes Oxley. As <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2011/03/a-straightforward-criminal-case-against-wall-street-ceos-and-senior-executives.html">we’ve discussed at length in earlier posts</a>, Sarbox was designed to eliminate the CEO and top brass “know nothing” excuse. And the language for civil and criminal charges is parallel, so a prosecutor could file civil charges, and if successful, could then open up a related criminal case. Sarbox required that top executives (which means at least the CEO and CFO) certify the adequacy of internal controls, and for a big financial firm, that has to include risk controls and position valuation. The fact that the Administration didn’t attempt to go after, for instance, AIG on Sarbox is inexcusable. The “investigation” done by Andrew Ross Sorkin in his Too Big To Fail (Willumstad not having a good handle on the cash bleed, the sudden discovery of a $20 billion hole in the securities lending portfolio, the mysterious “unofficial vault” with billions of dollars of securities in file cabinets) all are proof of an organization with seriously deficient controls.</p>
<p>But more broadly, it’s blindingly obvious this Administration has never had the slightest interest in doing anything more serious than posture. <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2010/03/the-empire-continues-to-strike-back-team-obama-propaganda-campaign-reaches-fever-pitch.html">As we wrote in early 2010</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Recall how we got here. Early in 2009, the banking industry was on the ropes. Both the stock and the credit default swaps markets said that many of the big players were at serious risk of failure. Commentators debated whether to nationalize Citibank, Bank of America, and other large, floundering institutions..</p>

                                <p>As the Senate election begins in earnest in Massachusetts, with a great deal of money already pledged and attack ads begun, the contest has the ability to capture the nation&#8217;s attention and imagination.  We will be following aspects of the election for our readers as the year progresses. Re posted is a statement she made on regulation and the role of non-banks in our system.  Of course the issues are ongoing today:
<p><a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2009/09/elizabeth-warren-exclusive.html">Angry Bear post 2009</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.newdeal20.org/?p=4454">Elizabeth Warren</a> of the Congressional Oversight Committee for TARP, and champion of an active voice for consumer protection regulation, offers her thoughts in <i>Real Change: Turning up the heat on non-bank lenders </i>with one of her latest essays at <a href="http://www.newdeal20.org/">New Deal 2.0</a>, part of the <a href="http://rooseveltinstitution.org/">Roosevelt Institution</a>.    <br />We have watched regulation slip away, which is of course not always bad, through terminating good rules, decreased funding to an agency to make enforcement less of an issue, and leadership in an agency to change the intent of regulatory function.</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><p>The big banks are storming Washington, determined to kill the Consumer Financial Protection Agency (CFPA). They understand that a regulator who actually cares about consumers would cause a seismic change in their business model: No more burying the terms of the agreement in the fine print, no more tricks and traps. If the big banks lose the protection of their friendly regulators, the business model that produces hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue — and monopoly-size profits that exist only in non-competitive markets — will be at risk. That’s a big change. <a name="more"></a>  <br />But there is an even bigger change in the wind: regulating the non-banks. Democrats and Republicans alike agree that the proliferation of unregulated, non-bank lenders contributed significantly to the financial crisis by feeding millions of dangerous financial products into the economic system. Non-bank institutions were active participants in the race to the bottom among lenders. From subprime mortgage loans to small dollar loans, they showed how to wring high fees and staggering interest rates out of consumer lending. Their fine-print contracts, and new tricks and traps, transformed the market.    <br />Despite widespread agreement about the problem, the U.S. has never made a sustained, systemic effort to regulate non-bank lenders&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;As lending abuses became more obvious, there was no effort to close regulatory gaps and loopholes or to devote federal resources toward the oversight of non-bank institutions. The reasons are many, but one of the most benign explanations is that policymakers for too long assumed that states could deal with the non-banks because the non-bank lenders are often small and often operate locally (although Countrywide showed that state-based organizations can metastasize rapidly). As it turns out, the states actually faced several limitations in reining in these lenders.   <br />States, just like the federal government, were subject to intense lobbying by creditors. In short order, many states changed their rules to undercut basic protections. For example, the consumer finance industry succeeded in rewriting state interest rate regulation to allow for massive increases in allowable effective rates — even when the advertised rate looks far lower and obscures the true cost of credit. In many states, making an end run around local usury laws is now as easy as running around a single fencepost. At the same time, state legislatures face the perpetual lag-behind problem. They are unable to adjust to a rapidly changing financial services market, too slow to identify problems and not capable of changing the laws quickly enough to head off serious problems.    <br />Moreover, resources are always constrained at the state level, and the enforcement of consumer credit laws competes with a wide variety of other state obligations. When consumer credit laws were violated, states often lacked the capacity to undertake serious investigations or to prosecute offenders. Some states made heroic efforts, but others left consumer financial issues far down their priority list.    <br />The problem of enforcement has been exacerbated by a serious structural problem. When an abuse surfaced-for example, a local paper ran a news story about an unfair practice or a consumer group assembled evidence of sharp practices-local officials often responded by jumping on small banks. The non-banks were often scattered and difficult to find, while the biggest financial institutions were typically protected from local prosecution through pre-emption. That left the small banks holding the bag. These small banks, often those with state charters, were the easiest institutions to locate and the cheapest to prosecute — even if they were only tangentially involved in deceptive practices. The result was that the worst offenders slipped away. Non-banks could shut down for a while, and then reappear when the heat was off. In effect, the state enforcement structure benefitted the big banks and the non-banks.    <br />The CFPA presents the first real opportunity to change that harmful structure.    <br />First, the CFPA will regulate consumer financial products across the board-using the same rules for all mortgages or for all small dollar loans, regardless of whether the mortgage or the loan is issued by a national bank, a state bank or a non-bank. The old practice of different sets of rules and different regulatory structures for the same products would disappear. Instead, the CFPA would create a coordinated set of baseline rules applicable across the board.    <br />Consolidated rule-making will also stop the practice of lenders shopping around for the regulator with the weakest rules. Bank holding companies have enjoyed an enormous advantage by having the freedom to structure their many business divisions to exploit regulatory weakness. They can operate a federally chartered bank when preemption is valuable to them. At the same time, they can purchase the products of non-banks in bulk, creating informal partnerships that exploit gaps in the state regulatory system. In fact, the Center for Public Integrity found that 21 of the 25 largest subprime issuers leading up to the crisis were financed by large banks. (Remember this the next time you hear a lobbyist blaming the crisis on non-banks and denying the role of the bank holding companies.) With consistent rules across the board, the CFPA would put an end to these practices.    <br />Consistent rules are important, but, as we now know, it isn’t enough to have good rules on the books. There must also be a serious effort to enforce those rules. With the right sources of funding and some smart strategic thinking about how to force non-banks to follow the same rules as other lenders, the entire landscape of consumer lending would change.    <br />From history, we have learned that an agency’s source of funding is critical to its success. By allowing the Agency to tax lenders directly — perhaps a dime for every open credit card account, a quarter for every open mortgage, etc. — Congress can make sure that the CFPA stays well-funded in the years ahead. The right funding structure will allow the Agency to develop the capacity to go after the non-banks and the dangerous products they originate, and it will insulate the Agency from political efforts to starve-the-regulators into inaction. Moreover, as we now know, the cost of even a well-funded agency is dwarfed by the cost to the government and the economy as a whole of bank failures. The cost of the failure of just one thrift – IndyMac — was almost ten times the annual budget of the Securities and Exchange Commission.    <br />New forms of strategic thinking will also be needed. By creating a system for mandatory lender registration, for example, CFPA will be able to keep track of the consumer lenders out there — something that no current regulators have the tools to do. To encourage compliance, the CFPA can work with other federal agencies — like the Treasury Department or the Internal Revenue Service — to identify unregistered lenders. In states that already register certain non-bank lenders, the CFPA can work off those registrations and collaborate with state officials. This is tough work, but a consumer agency with expertise and resources will rise to the challenge.    <br />The CFPA can also get smarter with enforcement by exploiting concentration points, places where small players are effectively grouped together. In the case of mortgage brokers, for example, without the large bank holding companies and their subsidiaries as customers for the loans they place, many would be out of business. Focusing regulatory attention on the buyers would create substantial leverage over the brokers as well. If the sponsors and funding mechanisms for the worst practices go away, so will the worst practices.    <br />There is more that we can do to deal with non-bank lenders, but only if Congress creates a strong CFPA. If we stick with the status quo — which treats loans differently depending on who issues them and places consumer protection in agencies that consider it an afterthought &#8211; we know what will happen because we have seen it happen before. Lenders will continue their tricks and traps business model, the mega-banks will exploit regulatory loopholes, and the non-banks will continue to sell deceptive products. In that world, small banks will need to choose between lowering standards or losing market share, and they will still get too much attention from regulators while the non-banks and big banks get too little. Dangerous loans will destabilize both families and the economy, and we’ll all remain at risk for the next trillion-dollar bailout.    <br />Regulating the non-banks hasn’t been tried in any serious way. The CFPA offers a real chance to level the playing field, to add balance to the system, and to change the consumer lending landscape forever.</p></blockquote>

<p>A Simple Question about NGDP Targeting</p>
<p>It seems that a big part of the econosphere these days talks about NGDP targeting.  Translating this into English, a number of economists believe the Fed should be adjusting monetary policy to achieve a desired level of nominal GDP in any given year.  To be very precise, both the economese and the English should be adjusted slightly to explain what is really meant:  the Fed should be adjusting monetary policy to achieve a given desired rate of nominal GDP in any given year</p>
<p>To me there are two very obvious problems with this.  The first should be evident to anyone who ever spent time in South America in the 1970s or 1980s, or has so much as heard of, say, Zimbabwe or the Weimar Republic:  why should the Fed or anyone else care about nominal growth rates?  Nominal figures are useful for <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2007/01/in-my-opinion-thomas-sowell-is-hack.html">Sowellizing</a>, which apparently can be very profitable, but in the end, only inflation adjusted figures tells us whether we&#8217;re better off or not.  </p>
<p>But there is a second problem, <a name="more"></a>  and the easiest way to state it is by analogy.  Think of the Fed as the quarterback on an American football team.  I don&#8217;t much like American football, but it is evident that the goal of a quarterback is not to throw a specific number of completed passes, or even to get certain score the board.  The goal is to do what it takes to win the game.  Getting 28 points doesn&#8217;t help you if the other team walks away with 35.  On the other hand, 28 to 21 achieves the quarterback&#8217;s goal nicely.  (And of course, whether 28 points looks impressive or not depends on a number things, including the condition of your teammates and the other team&#8217;s defense.)  For a good quarterback, winning the game sometimes means mostly staying out of the way, while at other times it means taking charge.  But specific measurable numbers mean nothing in the end. </p>
<p>Now, the Fed has a dual mandate (imposed by law):  set policy to maximize employment and keep prices stable.  Of course, the two goals conflict to some extent.  Stable prices means keeping inflation rates at about zero, which nobody advocates as it would generate slow economic growth (and thus low levels of employment).  Maximizing employment could be accomplishing economic growth rates, but the Fed often tries to slow down growth rates in order to prevent the onset of inflation.  </p>
<p>The Fed is left with something that loosely translates as this:  &#8220;try to get the economy to grow as quickly as possible without setting off too much inflation.&#8221;  It accomplishes that goal to a greater or lesser extent at different times.  </p>
<p>But given the number of moving parts out there, that seems to be a much easier, and much more logical approach than saying:  let&#8217;s shoot for a 3% increase in nominal GDP this year.  </p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>Lest this post be seen as a defense of the way the Fed does its job, I should note:  I personally think the Fed has been doing a very poor job for quite a while, and some of my earliest posts are criticisms of the Fed.  I&#8217;m especially horrified by the Fed&#8217;s approach to the economic mess we&#8217;re in &#8211; as I&#8217;ve been noting since 2008, ensuring that institutions with insane and harmful business models survive to engage in more spectacularly bad behavior is no way to help the economy, and that is true whether one has NGDP targets or not.</p>
