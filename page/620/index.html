                                <p>One of the hardest things in the world is to value that which is not otherwise measured. The old observation that a man who marries his housekeeper reduces GDP is both sexist and accurate.</p>
<p>Still (via <a href="http://erin-obrien.blogspot.com/2008/06/sure-ill-take-117000.html">Erin</a>), the salary.com estimate that being an at-home parent is <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2008/LIVING/worklife/05/09/mom.salary.ap/?imw=Y&#038;iref=mpstoryemail">worth $117,000 p.a.</a> seems a bit high. And we know why:<br />
<blockquote>The biggest driver of a mom&#8217;s theoretical salary is the amount of overtime pay she&#8217;d receive for working more than 40 hours a week. The 18,000 moms surveyed about their typical week reported working 94.4 hours &#8212; meaning they&#8217;d be spending more than half their working hours on overtime.</p>
<p>Working moms reported an average 54.6 hour &#8220;mom work week&#8221; besides the hours they spent at paying jobs.</p></blockquote>
<p>Still, as a proxy, you can hire an au pair (maximum 45 hours a week) for about $350/week. Add some incidental costs (car insurance, school costs required by the State Department, extra food) and you&#8217;re probably at $500/week.</p>
<p>So if you hire two, you&#8217;ve covered 90 hours for $1,000 a week, or $52,000 per year. Add in some gaps in the process (e.g., required vacation) and you might be around $70,000.</p>
<p>There seems to be an arbitrage opportunity here, unless the additional housing would cost about $50,000. But even that seems as if &#8220;women&#8217;s work&#8221; adds a lot of intangible value to the economy.</p>

                                <p>Just a brief shot before going out the door.</p>
<p>In both the Obama and McCain camps there are separate but related discussion of &#8216;privatization&#8217; and charges that in particular McCain is lying, or that the people who claim that Bush never supported &#8216;privatization&#8217; are lunatics. But I fear that a rhetorical trap is being laid that we need to watch out for. Because it all goes to the precise definition of &#8216;privatization&#8217;.</p>
<p>You can argue that even a system of personal accounts whose investment choices are totally controlled by the end beneficiary is not &#8216;privatization&#8217; as long as those accounts remain under governmental custodial control, and particularly if the government also limits your ability to withdraw your funds at will. That is you can design a plan that guts Social Security&#8217;s current intra-generational insurance model as well as eliminating all progressivity in the benefits schedule and with a straight face claim you have not &#8216;privatized&#8217; it, even though the net result is equivalent to simply abolishing the program outright.</p>
<p>I issue this warning because I see signs in both the MSM and the comment threads that this is the impending talking point and we don&#8217;t want another &#8216;withering on the vine&#8217; moment.</p>
<p>For those who don&#8217;t remember Gingrich proposed some Medicare changes that ultimately would have gutted it. He unwittingly revealed as much by using the phrase &#8216;withering on the vine&#8217; to describe the process. When called on this he made the ridiculous claim that he wasn&#8217;t talking about Medicare but just about HCFA, the agency that administers it. This doesn&#8217;t make sense, as long as you have Medicare, somebody will be having to pay the bills, if not HCFA who? But not only did he get away with it, he turned around and claimed that Democrats were deliberately distorting his position. And the MSM lapped it up.</p>
<p>The way the gutting worked was that Gingrich deliberately confused &#8216;nominal&#8217; and &#8216;real&#8217; and blurred the difference between &#8216;dollars&#8217; and &#8216;cost&#8217;. He claimed that because under his proposal nominal dollars going to Medicare would still be increasing, it was a deliberate lie to suggest that he was &#8216;cutting Medicare&#8217;. Now anyone who stopped to think about what this means in a context of an increased pool of eligible beneficiaries and a pace of medical inflation well in advance of core inflation would realize that nominal dollar increases could still result in service cuts per beneficiary and so a degraded system (which could then be depicted as proof of Big Government is the problem). Describing this plan as &#8216;cuts&#8217; was perfectly fair. But apparently nobody stopped to think and ultimately Newt was able to transform the whole thing into a campaign talking point on the lines of &#8216;Democrats are lying about my Medicare proposal&#8217;.</p>
<p>Well that is what happens when you allow the opposition to define what &#8216;privatization&#8217; means or what &#8216;cuts&#8217; mean. Don&#8217;t let them sell the message that in this context there is no overlap between &#8216;private&#8217; and &#8216;personal&#8217;. Because while the concepts are not in fact identical, in the context of Social Security it is a distinction without a difference.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://econ4obama.blogspot.com/2008/06/obama-economic-advisors-and-economic.html">Don Pedro</a> provides us lists of Obama’s economic advisors and other economists who support Obama – an impressive group.  He also provides us a list of <a href="http://econ4obama.blogspot.com/2008/06/other-list-mccains-economists.html">McCain’s economic advisors</a>, which is much shorter and has a serious problem.  The only name on that list that would impress me is that of Douglas Holtz-Eakin.  And (alas) Don notes how Holtz-Eakin has been making some really silly arguments of late trying to defend McCain’s fiscal proposals.</p>
<p>But what about McCain’s other economic advisors?  Well, there appears to be only one other economist on this list – that being Kevin “DOW 36000” Hassett.  Maybe Phil Graham received a degree in economics but his career has been that of a politician. Carly Fiorina’s claim to fame was being the CEO of HP but that is not exactly the same as being a Ph.D. in economics with tenure at Harvard.  And when one has to reach to the bottom of the barrel – as in calling Donald Luskin and Arthur Laffer one’s economic advisors – one really should not be running for President of this nation.  Someone please tell me that Don Pedro’s list is incomplete and inaccurate.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://electionstocks.com/2008/06/16/mccains-economic-team">Election Stocks</a> says I missed something from <a href="http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/014/751tryie.asp?pg=1">Andrew Ferguson</a> of the Weekly Standard.  I did and I should thank him for noting that the list used to include “Warren Rudman, Pete Peterson and the Concord group”.  But Election Stocks should have read further as Andrew made this important point:</p>
<blockquote><p>What makes it odd is that those people aren&#8217;t like each other at all, at least when it comes to their economic views. A couple of them, if you put them in the same room, would set off an intergalactic explosion like the collision of matter and antimatter. One adviser, Jack Kemp, is the man who talked Ronald Reagan into embracing supply side economics in the 1970s, which launched the Reagan boom of the 1980s. He&#8217;s the world&#8217;s bubbliest advocate of tax cuts, dismissing the traditional Republican fixation on balanced budgets as &#8220;root canal&#8221; economics. Another adviser, Peter Peterson, is root canal economics. He&#8217;s a dour Jeremiah who called the Reagan boom a &#8220;mad, drunken bash&#8221; and thinks steep tax increases on income, gasoline, tobacco, and alcohol, on top of a 5 percent consumption tax, are necessary to put the government&#8217;s finances in order. He and Rudman run the Concord Coalition, an advocacy group that regards the federal government&#8217;s budget deficit as the country&#8217;s foundational economic problem.</p></blockquote>
<p>The problem with McCain is that he is listening not to the sensible people at the Concord Coalition but to the hacks like Jack Kemp and Arthur Laffer.  A hat tip to Andrew Ferguson for pointing out that McCain is a serial flip-flopper!</p>

<p>The McCains, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/14/us/politics/14disclosure.html">poor little rich debtors</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Mr. McCain and his wife had at least $225,000 in credit card debt and&#8230; Mr. Obama and his wife had put more than $200,000 into college funds for their daughters.</p>
<p>The bulk of the McCains’ obligations stemmed from a pair of American Express credit cards that are held in Cindy McCain’s name. According to the disclosure reports, which present information on debts in a range rather than providing a precise figure, Mrs. McCain owed $100,000 to $250,000 on each card.</p>
<p>Another charge card, held by what was described as a “dependent child,” had also accumulated debts of $15,000 to $50,000. In addition, a credit card held jointly by the couple was carrying $10,000 to $15,000 in debt, the filing indicated, at a stiff 25.99 percent interest rate.</p></blockquote>
<p>Via <a href="http://feeds.boingboing.net/~r/boingboing/iBag/~3/311975516/john-mccain-creditca.html">BoingBoing</a>, where Cory Doctorow points to <a href="http://jtaplin.wordpress.com/2008/06/14/fiscally-responsible-john-mccain/">Jon Taplin</a> making the point that it might just pay the McCains to pay off those balances.  (See also <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/06/clever-math-clever-reasoning.html">Coberly</a> from last week.)</p>
<p>My own thoughts are pulled in two directions (angle of incidence indeterminate).</p>
<p>For one, a family member&#8217;s experience trying to divorce a full-service brokerage revealed that the business model there depends on having clients who are too rich to be bothered by having a few percent of their wealth siphoned off annually.  (Since some commenters don&#8217;t get the connection, remember McCain&#8217;s economic platform contends it would be bad for the economy if we increased the marginal rate of taxation on income the rich can evidently afford to waste.  Not to mention that there have already been efforts to frame the race as between Straight-Talking Man of the People John McCain and U. Chicago Elitist Barack H. Obama.)  Discussion point: Should we prefer having private firms soak the rich for profit over having the government soak the rich for public purposes?</p>
<p>For another, the report that the McCain&#8217;s are paying a penalty interest rate gives me some faith in soulless corporations.  This goes to another family member&#8217;s experience billing Delaware&#8217;s Old Money for children&#8217;s clothes in the relatively distant past (meaning before credit-card lending surpassed chemical manufacturing as the state&#8217;s dominant industry).  Those families graciously accepted the bills; it was just considered unseemly to expect them actually to pay the bills on any particular schedule.  Presumably, we&#8217;d need to know more about the McCains&#8217; pattern of delinquency to know whether 25.99% APR nevertheless reflects VIP treatment.</p>
<p>Update 6/17/08: Reader Jefff points to <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/06/13/ready-to-laugh-at-mccain_n_107008.html">this Huffington Post article</a> that points out that the interest rates on the main AmEx debts are 0%.  The disclosure lists the maximum amount owed over the reporting period, so the logical conclusion is that Cindy McCain sometimes runs up Very Large Charges in the course of a month and pays them off.  The Chase card with the 25.99% interest rate is a small head-scratcher; a couple grand in needlessly incurred interest may be chump change to the McCains, but <a href="http://www.johnmccain.com/About/Cindy.htm">JohnMcCain.com</a> tells me how much Cindy cares about the poor little people of the world, and any food bank anywhere would be glad to see the money.  Her main debts appear to be associated with the Hensley &#038; Co. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/27/us/politics/27plane.html">Citation Excel</a>.</p>
<p>While the details of the disclosure are complex (<a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/pfds/candlook.php?CID=N00006424">get it here</a>), it is clear enough that the McCains or their financial advisors basically haven&#8217;t heard of low-cost mutual funds.  (See thought #1, above.)  In particular, while the children are loaded, they&#8217;re also making an elective contribution to the overhead at JPMC.</p>

<p>Senate Votes To Privatize Its Failing Restaurants</p>
<p>From the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/06/08/AR2008060801765.html?nav=rss_email/components">Washington Post</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>The embarrassment of the Senate food service struggling like some neighborhood pizza joint has quietly sparked change previously unthinkable for Democrats. Last week, in a late-night voice vote, the Senate agreed to privatize the operation of its food service, a decision that would, for the first time, put it under the control of a contractor and all but guarantee lower wages and benefits for the outfit&#8217;s new hires.</p></blockquote>
<p>Why Privatize?</p>
<p>COST</p>
<blockquote><p>Year after year, decade upon decade, the U.S. Senate&#8217;s network of restaurants has lost staggering amounts of money &#8212; more than $18 million since 1993, according to one report, and an estimated $2 million this year alone, according to another. <br />The financial condition of the world&#8217;s most exclusive dining hall and its affiliated Capitol Hill restaurants, cafeterias and coffee shops has become so dire that, without a $250,000 subsidy from taxpayers, the Senate won&#8217;t make payroll next month.<br />In a letter to colleagues, (Diane) Feinstein said that the Government Accountability Office found that &#8220;financially breaking even has not been the objective of the current management due to an expectation that the restaurants will operate at a deficit annually.&#8221; </p></blockquote>
<p>QUALITY</p>
<blockquote><p>In a masterful bit of understatement, Feinstein blamed &#8220;noticeably subpar&#8221; food and service. Foot traffic bears that out. Come lunchtime, many Senate staffers trudge across the Capitol and down into the basement cafeteria on the House side. On Wednesdays, the lines can be 30 or 40 people long. <br />House staffers almost never cross the Capitol to eat in the Senate cafeterias&#8230;.In the past 10 years, only 20 new items have been added to the Senate menus.  <br />Even revenue in the once-profitable catering division has been decimated, as senators have increasingly sought waivers to bring in outside food for special events with constituents and private groups. </p></blockquote>
<p>Experience with privatized food service<br />
<blockquote>Operation of the House (of Representative) cafeterias was privatized in the 1980s by a Democratic-controlled Congress. Restaurant Associates of New York, the current House contractor, would take over the Senate facilities this fall. The company wins high praise from most staffers and lawmakers, who say they are pleased with the wide variety of new items offered every few months. <br />&#8220;Those who think the House and Senate don&#8217;t talk enough clearly haven&#8217;t been in the Longworth cafeteria on the House side at lunchtime recently. Senate staffers have been flocking there for better food, more options, and you get some exercise to boot,&#8221; said Brian Walsh, spokesman for Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.),who frequently dines on the other side of the Capitol<br />Most important to Feinstein, Restaurant Associates turns a substantial profit &#8212; paying $1.2 million in commissions to the House since 2003. Company officials did not return telephone calls seeking comment. <br />The rules committee began exploring its outsourcing options in 2005, when Republicans controlled the chamber. When Democrats took power last year, Feinstein ordered several studies, including hiring a consultant to examine management practices, before deciding privatization was the only possibility.</p></blockquote>
<p>As a microcosm:-  private vs. public sector, profit motive and performance, profit vs. labor costs, it should make you go &#8220;hmmmmmm.&#8221;<br />&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br />This one by sammy</p>

<blockquote><p>If you are ever under the delusion that modern conservatism means fiscal responsibility, or that the current president hasn&#8217;t been a fiscal catastrophe</p></blockquote>
<p>His graph is taken from <a href="http://perotcharts.com/category/challenges-charts/page/5">this post</a>, which notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>But wait a minute! All of the so-called “debt clocks” show that the national debt is now in excess of $9 trillion. Where is the $4 trillion discrepancy?</p></blockquote>
<p>Andrew’s graph shows the increase in the absolute value of the debt held by the public in part is growing because of rising prices and in part because the real economy is growing.  From 2001 to 2007, this debt relative to GDP grew from 33.0% to 36.8% &#8211; which is bad but doesn’t sound awful.  The $9 trillion figure is total Federal debt, which was 65.8% as of 2007 as compared to 57.4% as of 2001.  </p>
<p>The answer lies to that discrepancy question can be found <a href="http://perotcharts.com/2008/05/the-growing-national-debt-intragovernmental-holdings-1968-2007">here </a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Intragovernmental Holdings is the name given to a method that is used to keep track of money that the government has borrowed from several government agencies—the primary one of which is the Social Security Administration.</p></blockquote>
<p>Using the debt held by the public as one’s metric lets this Administration off the hook for their attempt to raid the Social Security Trust Fund.</p>

<blockquote><p>Obama has to strike a careful balance between his promises of hope and optimism, against the pitfall of allowing himself to become a political doormat.</p></blockquote>
<p>Eric was delighted with <a href="http://thepage.time.com/obama-pool-report-from-philadelphia-fundraiser">this</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>He warned that the general election campaign could get ugly. “They’re going to try to scare people. They’re going to try to say that ‘that Obama is a scary guy,’” he said. A donor yelled out a deep accented “Don’t give in!”  “I won’t but that sounded pretty scary. You’re a tough guy,” Obama said.  “If they bring a knife to the fight, we bring a gun,” Obama said. “Because from what I understand folks in Philly like a good brawl. I’ve seen Eagles fans.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Here is how <a href="http://thepage.time.com/mccain-response-to-obama">Team McCain</a> responded to the news that Team Obama would not just roll over to the usual GOP Swift Boating:</p>
<blockquote><p>Barack Obama’s call for ‘new politics’ is officially over.</p></blockquote>
<p>Such is the kind of hypocrisy one would expect from the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/06/gop-attack-ads-more-proof-that-mccain.html">weasels</a> who claim they want a clean campaign but will allow the GOP 527s to Swift Boat their opponent.</p>

                                <p>Well I want to get back to some of the basics. Much of the confusion around Social Security, and this is true as much for supporters as opponents, is a failure to understand what the Trust Fund actually is. This failure has led to such myths as &#8216;The Great Raids of Johnson/Reagan/etc&#8217;, the idea that something nefarious was going on, as well as the counterpart myth &#8216;Pre-funding&#8217;. This post aims to get people to see that Trust Fund in a new way and show that there really is nothing to see here, this accident scene turns out not to be an accident and in historical and numeric context not much of a scene to start with.</p>
<p>First and most important concept: the Trust Fund is not an investment fund, it is instead a reserve account maintained by the Treasury Department. In design and through much of its history it simply served as a buffer to protect retirees benefit checks from temporary fluctuations in revenue through such things as spikes in unemployment.</p>
<p>Second: while the Trust Fund balances are reported in total dollars ($2.2 trillion today) that is not really the best way to measure it, between inflation, changes in real wage, and increases in population it makes no sense to compare the balance today as opposed to fifteen years ago. Instead on a year to year basis the SSA examines the cost/income ratio and its trend. On a longer term basis it relies on the Trust Fund Ratio. The TF Ratio is the current balance expressed as a function of time where 100=1 year.</p>
<p>Third: before examine the numbers I want to introduce two concepts, that of Short Term Actuarial Balance and of Long Term Actuarial Balance. Short Term in Social Security terms means 10 years. If the projected Trust Fund Ratios are projected to be at or over 100 then Social Security is judged to be in Short Term Actuarial Balance, if not then the Trustees are supposed to urge Congress to do something about it, to that degree the ten year forecast is the official measure of &#8216;Crisis&#8217;. But the Trustees also keep an eye on Long Term Actuarial Balance which is the same test over 75 years. And now to the numbers:<br /><a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/VI_cyoper_history.html#159726">Table VI.A4.—Historical Operations of the Combined OASI and DI Trust Funds,Calendar Years 1957-2007 [Amounts in billions]</a><br />Discussion under the fold.</p>
<p>The three columns to pay attention to are the three far right ones under the heading assets. The first of the three measures cash flow to or from the bottom line in any given year, the second shows the resulting cumulative total, the third shows that total in terms of Trust Fund Ratio. If we examine the years from 1957 to 1965 we see a real Pay/Go system, with some years showing small surpluses while other years showing somewhat higher deficits with a result in cash terms of a roughly steady state balance. But if we examine the last column the picture darkens somewhat, we have a TF ratio that drops from a more than comfortable 298 in 1957 to 110 in 1965. Given that the official target is Short Term Actuarial Balance and a TF Ratio of 100, not a call for action but something to keep an eye on.</p>
<p>Now if we examine the period from 1966 to 1969 and so including the last months of the Johnson Administration we see a system in almost perfect balance, in all four years the system ran small but fairly consistent surpluses leading to a modest increase in total Trust Fund balance from $22-32 billion, but it is the last column that really tells the tale, the TF Ratio stays right around the level of Actuarial Balance with a low of 95 to a final of 103.</p>
<p>So time to bust Myth #1, that Johnson raided the Trust Fund to pay for Vietnam or the Great Society programs and created the Unified Budget to cover his tracks. Well sorry the actual numbers simply don&#8217;t support that, the $14 billion dollars added to the Trust Fund balance between the end of 1965 and the end of 1969 (with $5 billion of that coming in the last year and so mostly under Nixon&#8217;s first nine months) was much bigger money then than today, but it wasn&#8217;t enough to pay for the War nor for AFDC either. Instead Johnson and Congress did exactly what the law called for them to do, ensure that Social Security had a line of credit equal to around one year of expenses.</p>
<p>Line of Credit? What the hell, aren&#8217;t those assets Real as Real? If not why call them assets? Well the answer is to step back and think of the whole idea of dollar denominated assets. In the end the dollars you have in a bank account are in reality just a legal claim against the bank. If the dollars are in a savings account the bank will credit that account with a modest amount of interest, if the dollars are in a more volatile checking account (and so not as available in principle for the bank to lend) the bank may charge fees from small to extortionate, but really you don&#8217;t have any physical dollars in any of those accounts, just the right to exchange a portion of that balance for cash or services.</p>
<p>So in real world terms the Trust Fund balance is just a legal claim on the Treasury in exactly the same way as a savings account is a legal claim against the Bank, each in the end quaranteed by the Federal Government, in the case of the Trust Funds directly, in the case of the bank through various types of federal insurance. So why do we also track those balances in the form of Special Treasuries? Why not make the claim explicit and direct? Well I expect that the answer is partly Constitutional and partly just one of convenience. In Article 1 Section 9 (Limits on Congress) we are told: &#8220;No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law; and a regular Statement and Account of the Receipts and Expenditures of all public Money shall be published from time to time.&#8221; On the other hand the Treasury has the routine and regular authority to borrow money and issue debt instruments. Rather than entangle Social Security and Medicare in the Appropriations process, the Special Treasuries offer a convenient way to recast the whole thing as a series of borrowing and repayment.</p>
<p>Okay back to the numbers. Having introduced the concept that the Trust Fund is simply a reserve account to buffer short term variations in revenue, and that holding it in Special Treasuries is just a matter of convenience, what do the numbers show from 1970 to 1980, that is from Nixon to the election of Reagan? Well it sure as hell wasn&#8217;t a raid on the Trust Fund, instead surpluses dropped sharply and went to deficits in 1975, with the result that over this period the TF balance went from $38 billion to $27 billion even as annual cost went from $39 billion to $119 billion. And the arithmetic result in the TF ratio is stark, from 103 in 1970 to 25 in 1980. That is when Reagan took office the SSA had only three months of excess claims on Treasury in case of a revenue dip that sent Income below Cost. Now that is a system in crisis.</p>
<p>So time to bust myths 2 and 3. Because while you can indict Nixon, Ford, and Carter for letting the system decay, they did in fact honor the Trust Fund right down to the last, those Special Treasuries were paid off with General Fund transfers, they did in fact keep the checks flowing. So much for myth 2. As for myth 3, the Reagan raid on Social Security to pay for the Defense buildup. Nonsense. If fact laugh out loud nonsense. He was handed a lemonade and despite all entreaties from ideological opponents of Social Security did not let the system go to default, instead between him, the Commission, and Congress they implemented an interim patch designed to put the Trust Fund back on a path to Short Term Actuarial Balance, a task that was accomplished right in time to hand the system over to Clinton. Plus if you go back and actually look at the cash surpluses from 1982 to 1986 and so for most of Reagan&#8217;s remaining time in office you see a balance going only from $24 to $46 billion with half of that in the form of interest. Which left Reagan the opportunity to &#8216;loot&#8217; Social Security over that five year period of $11 billion or a $2.2 billion a year. Needless to say that was little more than a rounding error is then current defense budgets, the notion that Social Security funded a fleet of supercarriers vanishes into thin air.</p>
<p>If you look at the numbers.</p>
<p>One last myth, that of prefunding. When you think about Social Security in terms of a reserve fund whose measure of adequacy is a TF ratio of 100, you have to conclude that in any year that ratio remains below 100 you have not pre-funded anything, if anything your account is in arrears. So it is not true that Boomers started pre-paying for their retirement in 1984, instead they were simply maintaining Pay/Go while slowly building the Reserve, aka Trust Fund back to 100, a goal that was reached by 1993. It is true that a period of strong growth in the economy after that served to drastically improve actuarial balance, but even now the TF ratio is only at 341 and only projected to rise modestly over the next four years and then to decline after that. In real terms Boomers have only prefunded the next 3 years and 5 months, or more precisely 2 years and 5 months once you subtract out the mandated 1 year reserve,</p>
<p>Conclusion. The Trust Fund should not be seen as an investment fund because functionally that has not how it has operated historically and that is not how it is expected to operate projected forward. Under Intermediate Cost projections this period of strong surpluses is going to be temporary and talk about reallocating assets doesn&#8217;t make sense. (Different story under Low Cost but opponents of Social Security have to date not been willing to go there). In any event the history of Social Security from 1957 to at least 1993 can be summarized &#8220;Promises made, promises kept&#8221;. There simply was no dirty work done by anyone, not LBJ not Reagan not any of them. But the myths die hard on both the Left and the Right.</p>
