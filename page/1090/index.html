                                <p>Matt Y. <a href="http://yglesias.typepad.com/matthew/2005/01/still_no_crisis.html">explains the trust fund</a> simply enough that anyone can understand:<br />
<br />
<blockquote>Social Security, similarly, has been saving money for the past 20 years and will continue to do so for the next 14. At that point, it will slowly begin paying down its savings. This is not a Day of Reckoning for Social Security. At best, it&#8217;s a Day of Reckoning for the General Fund that owes Social Security the money.</p>
<p>Some people of my acquaintance believe that this is a distinction without a difference, since the General Fund is the government and the Social Security Trust Fund is just a different bit of the government. But the two notional entities have different revenue streams &#8212; the SSTF is mostly financed by payroll taxes on the middle class while the GF is mostly financed by income taxes on high earners. When the GF borrowed from the SSTF America&#8217;s middle class was lending money to America&#8217;s rich with an understanding that the money would be repaid with interest. Similarly, I lent money to the Riggs Bank with the assumption that my money would be repaid with a (very modest amount of) interest. If the Riggs Bank proposed to just not pay me back, they&#8217;d be in trouble. Today, the agents of America&#8217;s rich in the Republican Party are proposing that the wealthy default on their debt to the middle class. That this proposal exists is the only thing that Social Security must &#8220;reckon&#8221; with for the next several decades.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;d add that if you really believe the federal government will default on its debt obligations, whether held by the SSTF, the Chinese, or US citizens, then you might also want to consider stocking up on guns and gold.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gao.gov/cghome/dia20041209/img8.html"><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/Surplus.jpg"></a></p>
<p>&#8220;Off-budget&#8221; means social security &#8212; it&#8217;s currently running a surplus of around 1.5% of GDP or over $150 billion/year. Hardly a crisis, that. The general fund, however, is running a deficit in the neighborhood of 5% of GDP. That&#8217;s about $600b for 2004 (based on these <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/showdoc.cfm?index=1944&#038;sequence=0">somewhat dated numbers</a>.) Now that sounds a lot more like a crisis. Of course, fixing that will require spending cuts, tax hikes, or both, so don&#8217;t hold your breath.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.gao.gov/special.pubs/longterm/challenge.html"><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/budgetpicture.jpg"></a></p>
<p>By comparison to the malignancies in the general fund, Social Security looks quite benign indeed (this figure is based on the trustees&#8217; intermediate projections for economic performance). Social Security spending is barely projected to rise above 5% of GDP. Of course, that is a lot of money. But we would all be better served in the short to medium run by fixing the massive general fund deficit and Medicare. (And no, <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2003/12/medicare-drug-benefit-update-reading.html">this monstrosity</a> does not count as fixing Medicare; quite the opposite in fact.)</p>

                                <p>I have two New Year’s resolutions: (1) try even harder to find ways to elicit bipartisan support for fiscal responsibility; and (2) Brad Setser’s blog more often. For those grown-up Republicans who wish to support (1), read <a href="http://www.roubiniglobal.com/setser/archives/2004/12/beware_of_a_12.html">this from Brad</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Take out social security, which takes in more revenue than it spends, and the budget math is even worse: revenues of 11.4% v. spending of 16.3%, or a deficit of nearly 5% of GDP.</p></blockquote>
<p>Actually, the 16.3% or so counts only the interest in Federal debt held by the public (2% of GDP) and one we include the interest payments to the Social Security Trust fund (around 1% of GDP), the General Fund deficit is near 6% of GDP.   Now President Bush is convinced that tax increases are not needed as spending cuts will do the trick.  Before one tries to divide the 6% deficit by the circa 17.5% in non-Social Security spending to suggest a 35% cut in spending will do the trick, consider just three things: (a) not paying interest will be considered default – so take that 3% off the table; (b) the GOP is not about to reduce DoD spending – so take that 4% off the table; and (c) reducing Federal revenue sharing (about 3% of GDP) would mean that the states would have to raise taxes to pay for public education and public order (police and fire departments).  </p>
<p>So of the remaining Federal spending, which is about 7.5% of GDP – we would have to cut this by 80% to balance the budget.  With the vast majority of this remainder being for health care, which the Bush Administration has guaranteed will go up as the Rx bill is enacted, where does the GOP plan to cut spending enough to balance the budget or even cut it in half?  </p>
<p>Well, the answer simply cannot be found anyway in the General Fund.  Which is why they wish to slash Social Security benefits as they convert our payroll contributions into employment taxes.<br /></p>

<blockquote>&#8230; The United States has a bit over $7 trillion in accumulated national debt &#8230; After 1980 we started borrowing money big-time to finance our deficits &#8212; in large part because of tax cuts on high-income earners. However you want to slice it, we started spending substantially more than we were taking in in tax revenue.</p>
<p>So where&#8217;d we borrow the money?</p>
<p>&#8230; I believe about $4 trillion of that debt was borrowed on the open market &#8212; individual Americans have them in their investment portfolios, or pension funds hold them, or the Chinese, Japanese and the Saudis and others have them in bonds.</p>
<p>But about $3 trillion of those dollars we needed to fund the 1980s and 1990s deficits we managed to borrow closer to home. We borrowed it from the Social Security (and a few other government) trust fund(s).</p>
<p>Almost the entirety of President Bush&#8217;s Social Security phase-out plan comes down to a simple proposition: finding out how not to pay it back.</p>
<p>&#8230; Before discussing that aspect of the question, consider a hypothetical. Let&#8217;s say there&#8217;d not been a Social Security &#8212; President Bush&#8217;s dreamworld. We&#8217;d still have had the same deficits. The difference would be that we&#8217;d have had to borrow from private borrowers in the US and abroad.</p>
<p>Think we&#8217;d just be able to decide not to pay them back? Not likely. The Joneses and the Smiths with their 401ks probably wouldn&#8217;t like that. And the Japanese and Saudis probably wouldn&#8217;t like it much either. Of course, defaulting on our entire national debt would also certainly trigger a seismic international financial crisis&#8230; </p></blockquote>
<p>The next time you read an article claiming that Social Security is in a crisis, or will be insolvent in the next decade, read very carefully (see e.g., the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A41423-2005Jan1.html">Post&#8217;s Jonathan Weisman</a>; commentary <a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/week_2005_01_02.php#004324">here </a>and <a href="http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/movable_type/2005-3_archives/000089.html">here</a>). The author&#8217;s claims most likely rest on the idea &#8212; either implicity or in order to mislead &#8212; that the government will default on its debt obligation to future retirees, retirees who explictly <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2004/03/three-card-monte-following-up-on-kashs.html">paid more in payroll taxes</a> in order to partially pre-fund their retirements.</p>

<br />
<blockquote>WASHINGTON (Reuters) &#8211; A reported U.S. plan to keep some suspected terrorists imprisoned for a lifetime even if the government lacks evidence to charge them in courts was swiftly condemned on Sunday as a &#8220;bad idea&#8221; by a leading Republican senator.</p>
<p>The Pentagon and the CIA have asked the White House to decide on a more permanent approach for those it was unwilling to set free or turn over to U.S. or foreign courts, the Washington Post said in a report that cited intelligence, defense and diplomatic officials.</p>
<p>Some detentions could potentially last a lifetime, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>Influential senators denounced the idea as probably unconstitutional.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a bad idea. So we ought to get over it and we ought to have a very careful, constitutional look at this,&#8221; Republican Sen. Richard Lugar of Indiana, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee said on &#8220;Fox News Sunday.&#8221; </p></blockquote>
<p>Lugar is to be commended, though the idea that opposing lifetime detention in cases where there&#8217;s not enough evidence for a trial needs to be commended (as opposed to assumed) is itself disturbing. Digby&#8217;s got <a href="http://www.digbysblog.blogspot.com/2005_01_02_digbysblog_archive.html#110470108144988208">the right, and righteous, take</a> on this and related problems.</p>

                                <p>At first, the White House thought $15 million was all we could do.  Next, they reacted to terms like stingy or miserly as if Bush was running for reelection &#8211; but at least the $15 million became $35 million.  But the number of dead already is 40 times that of 9/11 and the number of people displaced is estimated to be 5 million.  One UN official suggests the long-run costs of getting these nations back to a more normal state of affairs will top $100 billion.</p>
<p>So CNN is now reporting the White House has changed $35 million to $350 million.  Maybe it should be $3500 million from the US government alone?  It&#8217;s not time for blame games and semantics.  It&#8217;s time for action, which will require massive aomounts of aid &#8211; NOW.</p>

Looks like some smart stuff, even if one of the writers <a href="http://www.deadparrots.net/archives/social_security/0412i_want_to_sell_the_angry_bear_some_insurance.html#more">takes exception</a> to the points in <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2004/12/social-security-part-i-insurance-and.html">my Social Security post</a>.</p>
<p>(By way of a quick rebuttal, Dead Parrot Victor writes<br />
<br />
<blockquote>Keep in mind that average workers who retire in 2012, of course, <a target="_blanK" href="http://www.ssa.gov/history/reports/adcouncil/report/bok1.htm">paid more into the system</a> than they expect to get out.<sup>1</sup> This illustration presents a major problem for Angry Bear, because what it suggests is that you could take the present value of your contributions and, when you turn age 65/67, buy an inflation-adjusted annuity worth more than your Social Security benefits.</p></blockquote>
<p>But this, I think, still misses the insurance point. Victor is talking about the average worker getting a bad deal under SSRI. That&#8217;s natural in any insurance context. The average person with car insurance gets a bad deal. Ditto for homeowner&#8217;s and renter&#8217;s insurance, and for health insurance. In fact, were that not true, then the insurance companies would quickly go bankrupt. Insurance is about improving the well being of those with bad outcomes; everyone else gets a bad deal, <u>ex-post, not ex-ante</u>, from buying insurance.)</p>

                                <p>George Bush should consider Edward Prescott as Greg Mankiw’s replacement at CEA.  Prescott has been defending Bush’s tax cuts even without Karl Rove standing over his shoulder and now this via <a href="http://www.willwilkinson.net/flybottle/archives/2004/12/prescott_on_reb.html">Will Willkinson</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Readers of this page will recall that I have made this proposal in a previous essay, but readers may also recall a letter that questioned an assumption I make about consumer behavior. In effect, the reader asked how, on the one hand, I consider people so irrational that they have to be forced to save, and, on the other hand, I consider people rational enough to manage their own retirement accounts. But this question reveals a misunderstanding of the time inconsistency problem. The reason we need to have mandatory retirement accounts is not because people are irrational, but precisely because they are perfectly rational&#8211;they know exactly what they are doing. If, for example, somebody knows that they will be cared for in old age&#8211;even if they don&#8217;t save a nickel&#8211;then what is their incentive to save that nickel? Wouldn&#8217;t it be rational to spend that nickel instead.</p></blockquote>
<p>As Will notes, Prescott is arguing for mandatory savings but allowing individuals the right to choose how they allocate their retirement portfolios.  Two comments on this thread – both drawing from my discussion of the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2004/12/demints-social-security-proposal.html">DeMint proposal</a>.  </p>
<p>Those of us who believe that individuals are “homo-economicacus rationalis” (to coin Fester’s phrase) do accept the premise that people are rational enough to “manage their own retirement accounts”.  But this premise undermines the DeMint-Bush-Lindsay Graham notion that their version privatization will lead to wealth creation or higher returns precisely because people are already optimally managing their retirement portfolios, which are a combination of their Social Security portfolios and their private portfolios.  I suspect Dr. Prescott is not arguing there is some free lunch even if the politicians in the Republican Party are making that false argument.  </p>
<p>But Prescott’s discussion of moral hazard raises more than the rate of savings argument, which he so ably makes.  Consider the one place where Andrew Biggs and I agree – that allowing households to take invest in the stock market to get the possibility of upside gains but a government protection against downside risk will induce households to take on more risk than is socially optimal as it would be the Treasury who would bear any investment losses.  Prescott’s argument can be extended to a situation where there is no formal guarantee but the implicit promise of the government to take care of any day traders who end up in poverty. </p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> <a href="http://baplegger.com/blog/?item=the-case-for-privatizing-social-security&#038;category=econpolicy">Baptists and Bootleggers</a> commented on Prescott’s original WSJ oped and provides this quote from Dr. Prescott:</p>
<blockquote><p>Some politicians have vilified the idea of giving investment freedom to citizens, arguing that those citizens will be exposed to risks inherent in the market. But this is political scaremongering. U.S. citizens already utilize IRAs, 401Ks, PCOs, Keoghs, SEPs and other investment options just fine, thank you. If some people are conservative investors or managing for the short term, they direct their funds accordingly; if others are more inclined to take risks or looking at the long run, they make appropriate decisions. Consumers already know how to invest their money &#8212; why does the government feel the need to patronize them when it comes to Social Security?</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, consumers are ALREADY investing their 401Ks in stocks and bonds fully aware that their Social Security funds are investing in bonds.  So might Dr. Prescott please explain how putting them their Social Security funds into a 401K will CHANGE their allocation?  Answer – it will not.  So there will be no increase in expected returns under his logic.  It seems I agree with Dr. Prescott’s logic but the Bush-DeMint-Lindsay Graham crowd does not.  So why is Prescott saying they are right?  </p>

                                <p>Much of the Social Security ground has already been covered. For example, one <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/qa.htm">well-established fact</a> is that <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2004_12/005316.php">there is no Social Security crisis</a> (the Daily Howler has also been <a href="http://www.google.com/custom?q=social+security&#038;sa=Google+Search&#038;cof=AH%3Acenter%3BAWFID%3Ac32a032061318778%3B&#038;domains=dailyhowler.com&#038;sitesearch=dailyhowler.com">very good on this point</a>.) If nothing is changed and economic growth turns out to be in the fair to middling range then the trust fund will be exhausted in about 50 years. Of course, in 50 years, we&#8217;ll all have personal flying devices and <a href="http://www.irobot.com/consumer/">robot vacuum cleaners</a>. In the meantime, there are real problems to worry about: <a href="http://www.economist.com/agenda/displayStory.cfm?story_id=2421254">nuclear proliferation</a>, <a href="http://www.state.gov/s/ct/rls/pgtrpt/2003/">global terrorism</a>, the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4127311.stm">declining dollar</a>, <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/story/business/national/2004/12/03/usjobless-041203.html">jobs</a>, and the <a href="http://www.federalbudget.com/">massive general fund deficits</a>.</p>
<p>As mentioned already, the basic <i>solvency </i>of Social Security (or solvency conditional on minor adjustments) is established, so I&#8217;d like to instead address the basic <i>merit </i>of the program. My argument centers on the fact that Social Security is really <i>insurance</i>. In fact, the phrase &#8220;Social Security&#8221; is typically used as shorthand for &#8220;<a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/handbook/handbook.03/handbook-0302.html">Social Security Retirement Insurance</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>What&#8217;s so special about insurance? As it turns out, the vast majority of the population dislikes risk, and will pay money (e.g., insurance premiums) to avoid the consequences of risk. I&#8217;ve surveyed my students and asked whether they would prefer a job that has equal odds of paying $75k or $125k (expected income = $100k) to a job that paid $90k with certainty. Almost all prefer the $90k, meaning they would pay up to $10k (by having an expected income of $90k instead of $100k) in order to not have to face income swings of +/-$25k; many would pay more.(*)</p>
<p>In such a situation, if people can pay <i>less </i>than $10,000 to avoid such risk then real economic value is created. And in fact, this happens in the real world all the time. Consider a group of 100 people, each of whom faces this hypothetical gain or loss of $25,000. Let&#8217;s see how they can benefit by pooling risk.</p>
<p>First, what is the social cost of the risk faced by this group of people? By hypothesis, it&#8217;s worth $10,000 to each of them to avoid the +/-$25,000 risk. So the mere presence of this risk creates a cost of 100 * $10,000 = $1,000,000. If we can figure out a way to reduce this risk, there&#8217;s the potential to create an additional $1m (100 people at $10,000 each) in value for this group.</p>
<p>How does a risk pool work? With just 100 people, there is near mathematical certainty (about .997, based on the sum of 100 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_process">Bernoulli draws</a>, which follows a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution">binomial distribution</a>) that a minimum of 35 people will &#8220;win,&#8221; gaining $25k. The vast majority of the time at least 40 will win and, on average, 50 will win and 50 will lose. Should only 35 people gain $25,000 while 65 lose $25,000, then the group will have lost (35 &#8211; 65)*$20k = $600,000. Thus the simplest form of insurance entails each member paying a premium of $6,000, creating a pool of 100 * $6,000 = $600,000 to cover the group&#8217;s potential losses.</p>
<p>That is, if each member pays $6,000 for insurance, they can create a pool large enough to cover the group’s losses even in the worst of states. (Should the worst of states not occur, the balance can be repaid to the group as dividends, pushed into the next year&#8217;s pooled funds, or retained by the insurer as profits.) Stated differently, without insurance each member of the group faces a risk of income as low as $75,000. By pooling risk, no member of the group faces a risk of income below $94,000.</p>
<p>Moreover, as more people join the risk pool, the law of large numbers tells us that the risk is reduced further and further. In fact, with 10,000 people in the risk pool, the premium required to cover the group’s maximum total losses (in all but about 3/1000 cases) is only $500, instead of $6,000. That is, with a reasonably large group of people sharing risk, each can pay $500 and the risk is entirely eliminated. How much economic value is created by this? As I explained earlier in this post, real people in the real world are <i>willing to pay </i>amounts in the $10,000 to $15,000 range to avoid income swings on the order of +/-$25,000. But in the presence of insurance, these 10,000 people only <i>have to pay </i>$500. So in this hypothetical example, insurance &#8212; risk-pooling over a large group of people &#8212; creates $9,500 in economic value per person. (**)</p>
<p>What does all of this have to do with Social Security? Those who are hard-working, fortunate, and not too profligate will have a large nest egg at retirement and Social Security will account for only a small portion of their retirement portfolio. This is tantamount to paying for insurance and then not needing it. This happens all the time &#8212; every year someone fails to get sick or injured and, while surely happy in their good health, would have been better off not buying insurance. That&#8217;s the nature of insurance: if you don&#8217;t need it, then you&#8217;ll always wish you hadn&#8217;t purchased it. Only in the context of retirement insurance is this considered a crisis.</p>
<p>On the other hand, those with bad luck or insufficient income will not have a nest egg at retirement. Because of Social Security, instead of facing the risk of zero income at retirement, they are guaranteed income sufficient to subsist.</p>
<p>This is precisely like the insurance example I worked through above: people with good outcomes will wish they hadn&#8217;t paid into the insurance fund; those with bad outcomes will be glad they did. <i>Ex-ante</i>, everyone benefits from the insurance. Overall, society is better off because risk is reduced; because people are risk-averse, the gains are quite large.</p>
<p>Now, the quick-witted or contrary will point out, <i>inter alia</i>, that other forms of insurance are successfully provided by the market. Why should the government step into this particular market and not others? This post is already too long, so I&#8217;ll save that for another time. But in case you can&#8217;t wait, Mark Kleiman explains <a href="http://www.markarkleiman.com/archives/social_insecurity_/2004/12/social_insecurity_the_annuity_problem.php">one such market failure</a>.</p>
<p>One final point: all of the privatization plans I&#8217;ve seen discussed would replace Social Security with a defined contribution style system in which the more a person makes, and the luckier that person is, the more that person will have at retirement, and vice-versa. The insurance function of pooling and attenuating risk is totally removed; or, more accurately, reversed. To see the effects of this, run through the numbers above, but add a minus sign throughout.</p>
<p>AB</p>
<p>(*) If you&#8217;re initially tempted by the job with uncertain income, imagine that you are offered a job that pays $100k, with the following condition: every Christmas, you and your boss flip a coin. If it&#8217;s heads, you get $25,000. If it&#8217;s tails, you pay $25,000. This scenario gives equal odds of yielding an income of $75k and $125k, but most people would choose a job that pays $90k with certainty over the coin-flipping job. Of course, that&#8217;s identical to paying $10,000 to avoid the +/-$25,000 risk.</p>
<p>(**) To convince yourself that the magnitudes are not way off, note that homeowners pay about $1,500 per year simply to avoid the very low (less than 1/1000) risk of fire destroying their house.

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Josh Marshall has been offering updates on the Democrat’s Fainthearted Faction including <a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/week_2004_12_19.php#004291">this suggestion</a> that Harold Ford has become the Dean (his 12/23 post).  These Democrats seem to be reviewing a Social Security deform proposal by James DeMint (R-South Carolina) since President Bush refuses to tell us what his plan would be.  In many ways, DeMint’s proposal reminds me of an old Archer-Shaw proposal that was strongly criticized by Andrew Biggs in <a href="http://www.cato.org/pubs/briefs/bp-055es.html">this Cato publication</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Archer-Shaw plan would let individuals make investment decisions, thereby reducing the likelihood of political influence, but the government would be required to protect workers against any losses. The plan&#8217;s proposal to privatize profit and socialize risk resembles the incentive structure that led to the 1980s savings and loan crisis, which cost taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars. That incentive structure creates what economists call &#8220;moral hazard&#8221; and could again lead to large taxpayer liabilities if allowed to take root in the Social Security system. </p></blockquote>
<p>First, the essential ingredient of the <a href="http://jimdemint.com/socialsecurity.pdf">DeMint proposal</a> is:</p>
<blockquote><p>Investment Choice: Workers participating in the new system could select either a standard account with no investment choice and no risk, or a flexible account with limited choice and limited risk. The standard account would be invested in one fund consisting of 65 percent indexed stock and 35 percent government bonds. Workers who chose this account would never see their benefits fall below what is currently promised.</p></blockquote>
<p>To suggest investing in stocks conveys no risk is simply misguided reasoning.  While the standard account might have only a small increment of risk relative to the overall Social Security retirement portfolio (SSRP), that would also mean that the extra expected return from one’s SSRP would also be quite small.  And a hat tip to Fester for his term “homo-economicacus rationalis”in his <a href="http://festersplace.blogspot.com/2004_12_01_festersplace_archive.html#110349634866845885">Potential Debt Requirements for 2004-2005</a> in reference to my argument that a rational investor has already optimally allocated his retirement funds, which are part SSRP and part his private retirement portfolio (PHP).  So to the degree our rational investor sees the SSRP holding more stocks with higher expected return and risks, he will offset the overall effect by allocating fewer stocks and more bonds to his PHP.  </p>
<p>But of course, DeMint is suggesting that the government would shield the SSRP from any downside risk by having the U.S. Treasury bear any stock market losses if they occur.  But then isn’t Mr. Bigg’s concern of moral hazard relevant.  What is to stop the private investor from essentially day-trading his SSRP with a “head I win” and “tails the Trust Fund loses” approach to investing in the stock market?  In other words, will households become the S&#038;Ls of the 1980’s?  If so, the DeMint plan is a sure-fired means of bankrupting the Social Security Trust Fund.  </p>
<p>On the other hand, DeMint seems to be suggesting that we treat households who opt for the standard account in the same manner that S&#038;Ls were treated before banking deregulation.  In other words, their investment choices for their SSRP would be limited.  While it would not be the “choice” that President Bush talks about, this narrow aspect of his proposal seems to be interesting if I understand it.  Then again, the gains from such a proposal are extremely modest at best.  Of course, any plan that seems to promise a free lunch is likely posited on some very shaky economic assumptions.  The Fainthearted Faction should stay clear of this proposal as well as what is likely to eventually come from the White House.</p>
