                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Dan Bartlett went on the morning talks shows to explain that Rove’s speech included this sentence:</p>
<blockquote><p>Conservatives saw the savagery of 9/11 and the attacks and prepared for war; <em><strong>a few</strong></em> liberals <em><strong>extremists</strong></em> saw the savagery of the 9/11 attacks and wanted to prepare indictments and offer therapy and understanding for our attackers.</p></blockquote>
<p>I put two key parts of this in italics because I received an email from John Kerry that repeats the version of this sentence that our liberal media puts out where the words I put in italics are not included.  As a liberal Democrat – I agreed with what Bob Kerrey said about wishing the DeLenda Plan had been executed in the spring of 2001 (that is as soon as President Bush knew bin Laden was responsible for the Cole bombing) rather than the fall of 2001.  If Bartlett’s version of what Karl really said is correct, then I’m relieved he was not attacking my philosophy.</p>
<p><em>Update</em>: Let’s turn the microphone over to Senator Kerry:</p>
<blockquote><p>Make America Safe, Not Divided (Excerpts of remarks by Senator John Kerry on the Senate floor on Thursday, June 23)</p>
<p>&#8220;None of us here will ever forget the hours after September 11&#8230; and the remarkable response of the American people as we came together as one to answer the attack on our homeland&#8230;. [I]t brought out the best of all of us in America. <br />That spirit of our country should never be reduced to a cheap, divisive political applause line from anyone who speaks for the President of the United States. <br />I am proud, as my colleagues on this side are, that after September 11, all of the people of this country rallied to President Bush&#8217;s call for unity to meet the danger. There were no Democrats, there were no Republicans, there were only Americans. That is why it is really hard to believe that last night in New York&#8230; the most senior adviser to the President of the United States [was] purposely twisting those days of unity in order to divide us for political gain. <br />Rather than focusing attention on Osama bin Laden and finding him or rather than focusing attention on just smashing al-Qaida and uniting our effort, as we have been, he is, instead, challenging the patriotism of every American who is every bit as committed to fighting terror as is he. <br />Just days after 9/11, the Senate voted 98 to nothing, and the House voted 420 to 1, to authorize President Bush to use all necessary and appropriate force against terror. And after the bipartisan vote, President Bush said: &#8220;I&#8217;m gratified that the Congress has united so powerfully by taking this action. It sends a clear message. Our people are together and we will prevail.&#8221; <br />That is not the message that was sent by Karl Rove in New York City last night. Last night, he said: &#8220;No more needs to be said about&#8221; their &#8220;motives.&#8221; <br />I think a lot more needs to be said about Karl Rove&#8217;s motives because they are not the people&#8217;s motives&#8230; They are not the motives of a nation that found unity in that critical moment&#8211;Democrat and Republican alike, all of us as Americans. <br />If the President really believes his own words, if those words have meaning, he should at the very least expect a public apology from Karl Rove. And frankly, he ought to fire him. If the President of the United States knows the meaning of those words, then he ought to listen to the plea of Kristen Breitweiser, who lost her husband when the Twin Towers came crashing down. She said: &#8220;If you are going to use 9/11, use it to make this nation safer than it was on 9/11.&#8221; <br />Karl Rove doesn&#8217;t owe me an apology and he doesn&#8217;t owe Democrats an apology. He owes the country an apology. He owes Kristen Breitweiser and a lot of people like her, those families, an apology. He owes an apology to every one of those families who paid the ultimate price on 9/11 and expect their government to be doing all possible to keep the unity of their country and to fight an effective war on terror. <br />The fact is, millions of Americans&#8230;are asking Washington for honesty, for results, and for leadership&#8211;not for political division. Before Karl Rove delivers another political assault, he ought to stop and think about those families and the unity of 9/11. </p></blockquote>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>This week&#8217;s bid by a Chinese oil company (CNOOC) to buy an American oil company (Unocal) has provoked some interesting reactions in Washington.  Despite the fact that 70% of Unocal&#8217;s oil reserves are in Asia, that it supplies just 1% of US oil needs, and that oil is highly fungible (meaning that oil from one source can and will be replaced by oil from another source at virtually the same price if necessary), it seems rather silly to worry about the US becoming more economically dependent on China if the deal goes through.  Which means, I suppose, that I find many on Capitol Hill to be rather silly right now&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/23/AR2005062302065.html">The Washington Post</a>: &#8220;House and Senate members demanded an administration review of the bid, required under the Defense Production Act, to determine potential economic and security risks.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/24/business/worldbusiness/24china.html?pagewanted=1&#038;ei=5094&#038;en=47904fac77c52d73&#038;hp&#038;ex=1119672000&#038;partner=homepage">The New York Times</a>: &#8220;Two Republican congressmen, Richard W. Pombo, chairman of the House Committee on Resources, and Duncan Hunter, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, wrote to President Bush last week, saying that &#8216;such an acquisition raises many concerns about U.S. jobs, energy production and energy security.'&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory?id=877682">A.P.</a>: &#8220;&#8216;It&#8217;s not a business transaction at all,&#8217; said C. Richard D&#8217;Amato, chairman of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, a congressional advisory panel. &#8216;This is not a free market deal. This is the Chinese government acquiring energy resources.'&#8221;</p>
<p>I suppose that most of the reason that this deal is provoking such reactions among US politicians (compared to what would be the case if it was, say, a Brazilian company offering to buy a US company) is the idea that this deal would make the US more economically dependent on a country that may someday be an &#8216;enemy&#8217; of the US in some sense.  </p>
<p>Whether it is indeed likely that China will someday be an &#8216;enemy&#8217; of the US is a subject for another day (personally, I&#8217;m skeptical).  But even if you take that assumption as true, the fact is that this deal has virtually no macroeconomic relevance, and that this revelation about US economic dependence on China is coming very, very late. </p>
<p>Given that China&#8217;s government already controls hundreds of billions of dollars of US Treasury bonds &#8211; easily enough to wreak substantial havoc in US financial markets whenever they want to &#8211; the US economy is already extremely vulnerable to decisions made by the Chinese government.  China&#8217;s acquisition of one billion barrels of oil reserves in Asia is nothing compared to the economic influence over the US that they already wield.  </p>
<p>That&#8217;s why what really worries me about the sentiments coming out of Capitol Hill right now is simply the astonishing economic naivety that they display&#8230; and that these misconceptions have a good chance of leading to bad policy-making. </p>

To be honest, I have stopped saying much about these free lunch fallacies as Mark has in general been doing a wonderful job explaining these issues.  </p>
<p>But let me add that <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_comment/hunter_kerpen200506230903.asp">Lawrence Hunter</a> makes a <em>little</em> more sense than Mr. Roth:</p>
<blockquote><p>The gradual phase-in of personal accounts funded by the surplus would force Congress to cut spending by the amount it currently takes from the surplus &#8211; about $85 billion a year, or roughly 3 percent of the total $2.5 trillion federal budget. This is easily done if Congress gets serious about spending restraint. Citizens Against Government Waste, the taxpayer watchdog group, recently issued a report identifying $27 billion in pure political pork added to this year’s budget that could easily be tossed over the side in future years.</p></blockquote>
<p>But Hunter has his math all wrong.  3% of $2500 billion is $75 billion – which is about 3 times the amount of pork he mentions.  And his statement about the Social Security surplus being only $85 billion per year seems to be at odds with the accounting provided by <a href="http://slate.msn.com/id/2093707">Daniel Gross</a> as he points to the last line of table 8 from <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2004/summarytables.html#table8">this document</a>.  Even if Congress had the will to eliminate all of this alleged pork, that pays for only ten cents on the dollar.</p>

                                <p>Greenspan made some reasonable points about US trade with China during his testimony before the Senate Finance Committee today.  First, he said that a yuan revaluation against the dollar probably will do next to nothing to rescue US manufacturing.  Second, he pointed out that tariffs on Chinese products will be <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/business/AP-Greenspan-China.html?">equally ineffective</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Greenspan, testifying before the Senate Finance Committee, said some &#8220;mistakenly believe&#8221; that a marked increase in the value of the Chinese currency, the yuan, relative to the U.S. dollar &#8220;would significantly increase manufacturing activity and jobs in the United States.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am aware of no credible evidence that supports such a conclusion,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8230;Some lawmakers in Congress want to impose hefty 27.5 percent tariffs on Chinese goods flowing into the United States if Beijing doesn&#8217;t move to a more flexible currency system.</p>
<p>Greenspan said such tariffs, if implemented, would lower imports from China but would also raise imports from other &#8220;low-cost&#8221; sources of supply in other countries.</p>
<p>&#8220;U.S. imports of textiles &#8230; assembled computers, toys and similar products would in part shift from China as the final assembler to other emerging-market economies in Asia and perhaps in Latin America, as well,&#8221; Greenspan said. &#8220;Few, if any, American jobs would be protected.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I actually have to agree with Greenspan on this one.  I find it hard to believe that even a large change in China&#8217;s exchange rate &#8211; say 30% to 50% &#8211; will suddenly enable US manufacturers of labor-intensive goods to compete with Chinese labor costs.  Likewise for a tariff of 27.5%.  Each of those events may shift the composition of US imports somewhat, away from China and toward other developing countries, and each would make US consumers a bit poorer in terms of purchasing power&#8230; but neither would do much to stop the ongoing transformation of the US economy away from manufacturing and toward other types of production.  </p>
<p>On the other hand, a little more attention to helping those who are losing out in this economic transformation would be most welcome&#8230; though I&#8217;m not going to hold my breath.  </p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p><a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_nugent/nugent200506230902.asp">Thomas Nugent</a> provides a very extended “question” that Republican Congressman Ron Paul asked Alan Greenspan and then notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Maybe these politicians simply improvise around the questions their interns write for them. But more than likely they have no clue what they’re talking about. Of course, there’s ample entertainment value to all this. Just look at the faces of the legislators after Greenspan has answered their questions: Their expressions of puzzlement are priceless. Then there are the politicians who use 80 percent of their allotted time to campaign for office, not asking one meaningful question of the chairman.</p></blockquote>
<p>While I agree with Nugent that politicians often have no clue about economics, let me tick off a summary of the various questions Congressman Paul asked – all of which seem to be important to me – even if I happen to disagree with some of the implied “economic principles” where the Congressman does seem clueless:</p>
<p>Q1: Do high interest rates come more from higher government spending as opposed to higher deficits (as in from tax cuts)?</p>
<p>Q2: Does our propensity to lend to foreign entities provide a benefit to us in the form of interest free loans and exporting inflation?</p>
<p>Q3: “when do you anticipate the next currency crisis in the Mexican peso?” – in reference to the premise that Mexico has not reduced its solvency problems even years after the loan we provided to them.</p>
<p>Q4: Why should we worry about higher wages and not worry about higher returns to owners of capital?</p>
<p>Since Nugent forgot to tell us which of these four implied questions he finds amusing, let me suggest I disagree with the premises in Q1 and Q2, but I have seen some of Nugent’s NRO colleagues utter the same misguided notions.  On Q3 and Q4, I think the Congressman has a point.  Rather than mocking the Congressman, maybe Nugent should provide his readers a “civic lesson” on his view of the economic issues relevant to these two questions.</p>

<blockquote><p>The real question is not whether there is a bubble the question is, What are the chances that housing prices will fall dramatically?  Contrary to popular belief, knowledge of whether prices are following fundamentals or a bubble tells us very little about this question.  An efficient market is not necessarily a stable market.  Indeed, an efficient market can be as or even more volatile than a market plagued by bubbles … Since r and g are small a small change in g can have a large effect on the P/E ratio &#8211; so much in fact that it is very difficult to reject a model of stock prices based solely on fundamentals</p></blockquote>
<p>Let’s return to this after we follow-up on a small detail related to the update to <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/06/housing-stocks-v-residential.html">yesterday’s post</a>.  AB reader Rich Berger rightfully insists on an apples-to-apples comparison as far as time periods and notes a 67% increase in the number of houses from the end of 1972 to the end of 2004.  The Census also reports that total population increased by 41% over this same time period whereas Kudlow claimed a 75% increase in the number of households over some vague statement of what the time period was supposed to be.  So while the number of housing units relative to the number of households may have roughly stayed the same – assuming Kudlow’s reporting is correct, it would appear that there are fewer people per household.  Unless houses today are smaller than they were 30 years ago, there is more housing space per person.  </p>
<p>Alex Tabarrok’s discussion related to Kudlow’s discussion in the following way.  AB reader Movie Guy notes that the increase in the relative price of housing has occurred only recently.  Alex is noting that the recent fall in interest rates would tend to push up the relative price of housing quite rapidly.  Conversely, a rise in interest rates would tend to lower the price of housing quite rapidly, which would have a dramatic impact on the demand for residential construction &#8211; even if the &#8220;bubbleheads&#8221; are wrong about housing being currently overvalued.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p><a href="http://calculatedrisk.blogspot.com/">CalculatedRisk</a> previewed the latest UCLA Anderson Forecast and Dr. Leamer is concerned that residential investment demand will decline – especially in California.  <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/kudlow/kudlow200506201040.asp">Lawrence Kudlow</a> suggests that Leamer and CalculatedRisk are “bubbleheads”.  Kudlow gives a couple of interesting reasons for questioning forecasts of weak residential investment, but he also provides the following strange logic:</p>
<blockquote><p>Although year-to-date housing starts have kicked up to 2 million, average new construction since the early 1970s has hovered around 1.5 million to 1.75 million new starts per year. During the same period, the number of American households has increased by 48 million, or 75 percent, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. It is plain to see that the family demand for homes has far outstripped the supply of newly built residences.  So it should not be shocking that home prices have tended to rise on a steady basis, averaging 6.5 percent price gains over the last 35 years.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’ll take Kudlow’s word for his assertion that the nominal price of houses is now nine times what we observed 35 years ago but since the general price-level in 2004 was 4.14 times what it was in 1969, this nominal appreciation amounts to a relative price increase over the past 35 years than less than 120%.  CalculatedRisk has provided lots of informative graphs and discussions on the real estate market with <a href="http://calculatedrisk.blogspot.com/2005/03/california-real-estate-prices-boom-and.html">this one</a> of particular interest.  The relative price of housing in California at least has risen substantially over the past few years but all that can be said about the 1976 to 1998 era was that real housing prices were volatile.  Kudlow, however, seems to be confused over the difference between flows of residential investment versus stocks of houses.  The following graph shows residential investment as a share of GDP and does indicate that the current investment to GDP ratio is not extraordinarily high even if it is above what we had seen in recent years.  The graph also shows residential investment demand is volatile.  But Kudlow’s observation that they are 75% more households today as compared to 35 years ago does not mean that the house to population ratio has necessarily declined for a simple reason – housing once built tend to last a long time.  President Bush was telling some Maryland audience today why we needed to have more pork barrel spending for the energy companies paid for by more tax cuts (ah let our kids pick up those massive deferred tax liabilities) and gave his usual sunny stump speech, which included reminds me of Kash’s post <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2004/03/bush-takes-credit-for-home-ownership.html">Bush Takes Credit for Home Ownership</a>.  If demand is outstripping supply as Kudlow suggests, then why has the ratio of houses owned to population increased?  I have not done the math necessarily to convert the average residential investment demand to GDP ratio into an annual percentage increase in the housing stock, but let’s suppose the housing stock has grown by about 2% per year for 35 years.  If there are 75% more households but twice the number of houses, then Kudlow’s numbers are not contrary to what Bush said after all.  </p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/ri.JPG"></p>
<p>Kudlow also notes that <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h15/data/m/cm.txt">mortgage rates</a> are still modest.  Bush’s insistence on continued long-term fiscal stimulus is certainly not the reason.  I would argue that the continued weakness in labor markets is part of the explanation even as Bush claims employment rose by 3.5 million during his first term (I guess no one ever told him about the BLS footnote in the tables reporting the Household Survey figures).  Kudlow seems to think that appropriately tight monetary policy is the reason why mortgage rates remain modest even though he had earlier <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/kudlow/kudlow200505110857.asp">criticized</a> tight money even as he claimed the labor market was strong.  </p>
<p>Kudlow also notes that the homebuilder stocks such as <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=TOL&#038;t=5y">Toll Brothers</a> have enjoyed significant price increases over the past few years as sales and profits have increased.  Since stock valuations reflect expect expected future cash flows, these high valuations do seem at odds with the forecasts from Dr. Leamer.  Perhaps, the premise that California’s real estate bubble is only regional and not national suggests to Wall Street investors that while those in LA might be wise to <a href="http://www.markarkleiman.com/archives/macroeconomic_policy_/2005/05/speculative_selling_in_the_la_housing_market.php">sell their house</a>, the fortunes of companies that have economic activities across the nation may differ.  While these stock valuations <a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/ts/050620/10228808.html?.v=3">declined</a> on Monday, their valuations remain quite high.  However, Richard Suttmeier’s Homebuilders&#8217; Charts Testing Hearts (RealMoney) suggests that they are overvalued.  I have just one question for Mr. Kudlow: are you purchasing or selling shares of companies in this sector?</p>
<p><em>Update</em>: Thanks to CalculatedRisk for pointing out that the <a href="http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/housing/hvs/historic/histtab7.html">Census Bureau</a> provides historical data on the total housing inventory.  All units in 1969 were 69.778 million and were 122.187 million in 2004, which represents a 75% increase.</p>

                                <p>This morning the US Secretary of Energy, Sam Bodman, offered his analysis of today&#8217;s high oil prices.  Short version: don&#8217;t expect anything to change soon.<br />
<blockquote> WASHINGTON (<a href="http://today.reuters.com/news/newsArticle.aspx?type=politicsNews&#038;storyID=2005-06-22T140240Z_01_N22679983_RTRIDST_0_POLITICS-ENERGY-OIL-BODMAN-DC.XML">Reuters</a>) &#8211; U.S. Energy Secretary Sam Bodman said Wednesday it will take years to close the gap between increasing world oil consumption and the ability of oil producers to meet that demand.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we&#8217;re going to be measuring this in years, not in months,&#8221; he said in a speech to the National Petroleum Council.</p>
<p>Bodman pointed out that before 2004, world oil demand grew annually at a rate of about 1 million barrels per day. But last year, it rose by about 2.7 million bpd.</p>
<p>&#8220;Worldwide, the supply of oil is having considerable difficulty keeping pace with growing demand,&#8221; the energy secretary said, adding that a large part of the increase in oil demand is due to strong economic growth in countries like China and India.</p></blockquote>
<p>I can&#8217;t say that I disagree with him, except in one crucial respect: his comments seem to imply that he thinks oil prices will fall in coming years as supply catches up with demand, while I think it much more likely that in five years oil prices will be higher than they are today.</p>

                                <p>Brooke Oberwetter’s <a href="http://www.reason.com/hod/bo061305.shtml">critique</a> of Wexler’s Social Security proposal wants us to believe that we can somehow avoid tax increases.  But then there is this:</p>
<blockquote><p>He has proposed the largest marginal tax increase this country has seen in decades: a 6 percent tax hike on all income over the current $90,000 payroll tax cap. Let us pass over the discussion of how ever-rising marginal tax rates lead to tighter labor markets, reductions in productivity, and declines in reported income. Let us forget in their entirety the issues of tax revenue and solvency and instead try to figure out why, exactly, Democratic lawmakers are so hell-bent on preserving the basic current structure of Social Security. </p></blockquote>
<p>I can see why Oberwetter wants “us pass over the discussion” of general fund <em>solvency</em>, but did Oberwetter mean to suggest an employment tax increase would reduce the current slack in the labor market?</p>

                            </p>
                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>The price of oil is at <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story.asp?column=Futures+Movers&#038;siteid=mktw&#038;dist=">around $60 per barrel</a> for the second day in a row today.  Note that this is this highest price for crude oil in real terms since the end of 1982.</p>
<p>Naturally, this means that the value of US oil imports will continue to grow from their already high levels.  As the chart below illustrates, the US now spends close to $20 bn per month on imported oil, roughly double the average of just two years ago.</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/oil_import0.jpg"></p>
<p>But it is worth noting that US oil imports are growing not just relative to what they were a couple of years ago, but also relative to the US economy in general. The following chart shows the real price of oil, and US oil imports as a % of GDP, from 1978 up through the first quarter of 2005.  </p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/oil_import1.jpg"></p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the portion of US GDP devoted to buying imported oil closely tracks the price of oil.  But the chart also shows that for a given price of oil, the US economy is more dependent on imported oil than at almost any time in history.  In early 2005 a larger share of US income was spent on imported oil than at any time other than the brief period 1979-1982.  And of course, since then, the price of oil has risen by several more dollars per barrel.</p>
<p>This has several implications.  One is simply that the US economy is more susceptible to developments in foreign oil-producing countries than ever before.  Another is that some economists (myself included) may need to recalibrate our mental maps of the world slightly; oil imports matter a LOT to the US economy today. This was not true during the 1990s, when energy imports were a relatively insignificant detail in the overall picture of the US economy.  But today US oil imports make up a giant component of international trade and financial flows (a point <a href="http://www.roubiniglobal.com/setser/archives/2005/06/oil_nuff_said_a.html">Brad Setser</a> has effectively made recently), and are crucial to understanding the US macroeconomy more generally.</p>
