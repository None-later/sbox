                                <p>Well, at least equalize the rates at a minimum.  But as you read from CNN, he seems to be suggesting something more at least for a certain means of income earning.</p>
<p>From the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/27/AR2007062700097.html">Washington Post</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Buffett cited himself, the third-richest person in the world, as an<br />example.  Last year, Buffett said, he was taxed at 17.7 percent on his<br />taxable income of more than $46 million. His receptionist was taxed at about 30 percent.<br />A populist tone permeated the 70-minute talk with the billionaire<br />investor and philanthropist in Manhattan  on Tuesday night. The<br />talk, given to about 600 Wall Street bankers and money managers, raised at least $1 million for Clinton&#8217;s presidential campaign,&#8230;<br />Buffett said that he and other privileged Americans must do more to help the less fortunate.<br />&#8220;We have the chance in 2008 to repair a lot of damage,&#8221; Buffett said.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://money.cnn.com/2007/06/26/news/newsmakers/clinton_buffett/index.htm">CNN</a> has this take on the speech:</p>
<blockquote><p>The &#8230; chairman touched on a variety of issues in a question and answer session<br />with Clinton, including his disdain for private equity firm power brokers.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The people that earn their living doing that should be subject to taxes that reflect their labors,&#8221; he said in the gathering at a hotel in midtown Manhattan.<br />Buffett said he makes $46 million a year in income and is only taxed at a 17.7 percent rate on his federal income taxes. By contrast, those who work for him, and make considerably less, pay on average about 32.9 percent in taxes &#8211; with the highest rate being 39.7 percent.<br />&#8220;I&#8217;m willing to bet anyone in this room $1 million that those rates are less than the secretary has to pay,&#8221; said Buffett.</p></blockquote>
<p>Does he really mean it? I think he does. Unfortunately, just raising the tax rates is not going to solve the problem when the problem is pay. Raising the rates is a start, it will help with the deficit issue but it will do little for those who are earning a majority of their income via wages (which is 95% of the citizens if you recall my posts of the past). It does nothing to reverse the shift in share of income. If people in Mr. Buffet&#8217;s income bracket are truly concerned about the people, they can start by paying their help more. Doing such would be a true expression of the founders concept of freedom, that is the economic freedom part of the concept.  Unfortunately I do not read anywhere of anyone suggesting that.  Instead they seem to be focusing on a paternal benevolent model of helping the less fortunate (those earning less than the Wall Street Bankers).</p>

                                <p>It seems that I was <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/06/dick-deficits-dont-matter-and-free.html">not the only one</a> who took interest in <a href="http://blog.washingtonpost.com/cheney/chapters/a_strong_push_from_back_stage/index.html">this</a> as <a href="http://time-blog.com/curious_capitalist/2007/06/the_washington_posts_take_on_c.html?xid=rss-curious">Justin Fox</a> continues the conversation:</p>
<blockquote><p>Today brings us the economic-policy chapter of the big Washington Post series on how Dick Cheney runs America &#8230; One big takeaway is that economic policy in the Bush administration is run not by the Treasury Secretary, as it was in the Clinton years (at least after Lloyd Bentsen retired), but by the Vice President. Which at least seems better than having it run by some junior political aide in a cubbyhole office in the West Wing, although from the Post account it looks like it was mostly political considerations, combined with a very facile supply-side view of how the economy works, that drove Cheney&#8217;s thinking on the subject &#8230; In any case, the legacy Cheney leaves behind on the economic front are persistent budget deficits &#8230;  an economy that&#8217;s still growing and dynamic but has clearly seen better days, and a bunch of huge, as-yet unresolved problems, from the U.S. trade relationship with China to the future funding of Social Security and especially Medicare. Apparently Cheney was against the expensive new Medicare drug benefit, but he was accommodating enough to let the President have his way on that.</p></blockquote>
<p>Cheney “runs America”?  Shouldn’t that be – is in the process of ruining America?  I really like the line “a very facile supply-side view of how the economy works” as most devotees of the Laffer free lunch version of supply-side economics have an incredibly facile view that denies the existence of a crowding-out effects.  After all – if “deficits don’t matter”, the Medicare drug benefit can’t be all that expensive as we got to cut taxes at the same time.</p>

<blockquote><p>I don&#8217;t mean to be harsh regarding Senator Lugar.  He is hardly a singular voice here.  Unlike the foreign policy establishment, however, I have spent many years dealing with real live jihadists.  Fact:  They really do think they can and will win.  They don&#8217;t need a lot of hope to carry on — people willing to kill themselves in order to kill you are already pretty motivated.  But they derive great hope from what they (rightly) see as our surrenders and our ambivalence — compared to their own great certainty and confidence.  </p>
<p>I am not a fan of how the war has been directed, and I believe expending our time and effort on the democracy project rather than on defeating our enemies in Iraq and elsewhere will go down as one of history&#8217;s great blunders.  But with all that said, I note with the heartache of one who has seen it all too many times before:  We will rue the day we leave Iraq without routing radical Islam.  What we have not killed, we have made stronger.</p></blockquote>
<p>The fact that the jihadists think they can win doesn&#8217;t mean they can win.  GW and the National Review crowd thought he could cut taxes, make the economy boom, and pay down the debt.  Mitt Romney apparently things he could cut taxes, make the economy boom, and pay down the debt, and some of the same folks who thought GW was going to be able to do it also think Romney will be able to do it.  &#8220;Thinking&#8221; of this sort is cheap.  </p>
<p>But that second paragraph of McCarthy&#8217;s&#8230; its little more than a statement that having Saddam Hussein in charge of Iraq was in our best interests.  I wonder if he realizes that&#8217;s his conclusion&#8230;</p>

                                <p>Law and order is typically something Republicans campaign on, so its clearly important to a large segment of the electorate.  This post looks at spending on spending on law and order issues, and how that has changed over time and by Presidential administration.  </p>
<p>The data used is from <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2008/sheets/hist03z1.xls">White House OMB Table 3.1:  Outlays by Superfunction and Function</a>.  In particular, we’ll look at administration of justice (which presumably includes not just the legal system, but various police functions) as a percentage of total federal outlays.  Here’s a graph:</p>

<p>(Snide aside…  I wonder how much Nixon regretted spending on law and order, and doesn’t it look like Ford clearly felt enough was enough?  FWIW, part of Carter&#8217;s decline in spending might be due to his thinking Nixon overdid it.)</p>
<p>Here’s a summary.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RoJPtzb6NqI/AAAAAAAAAVQ/apPs-Z7AkiI/s1600-h/Justice,+Table+1.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RoJPtzb6NqI/AAAAAAAAAVQ/apPs-Z7AkiI/s320/Justice,+Table+1.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>From this…  it really does seem like a Republican issue, given that JFK/LBJ and Carter take up the bottom of the pack.  But… Nixon at the top of the heap?  Irony of ironies.  And Clinton as second, beating out most Republicans on a Republican issue… well, I’ve grown accustomed to that in the course of this series.  And here’s one where GHW does well, better than Reagan.   </p>
<p>And now for the obligatory Bush Derangement Syndrome… notice that GW’s attitude toward Justice seems to have, well, um, evolved, (yeah, that’s the word I’m looking for) over time.  I expect it to evolve further.  If I were betting, I’d say in two years it will evolve him down to seventh place.  Considering the number of administration officials that have already been indicted (just <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/26/AR2007062601846.html">yesterday</a> a Deputy Secretary of the Interior was given ten months in jail), I can&#8217;t imagine GW has much of an interest in keeping the process flowing smoothly.</p>
<p>Next data related-post… Murder!</p>
<p>Question &#8211; Also&#8230; I could use some help.  As noted yesterday, if anyone knows where I could find time series data on white collar crime, it would be great.  Also, does anyone have a list of administration officials indicted and/or convicted going back a few administrations (ideally to Ike)?  Again, time series form would be easiest.</p>

All one has to do is to listen to Romney to know this is true as Romney wants more defense spending and lower tax rates.  To date &#8211; all he has said about cutting Federal spending is some unspecified magic formula, which will allegedly cut spending by $300 billion over the next decade.  Yes, boys and girls – that’s a mere $30 billion per year.  Might Glenn Hubbard and Greg Mankiw come out and tell the fellow that they are advising that this is just stupid?  Might they tell their candidate that the free lunch version of supply-side economics is flat out wrong?  They do know what is meant by crowding-out so aren’t they probably advising their client?</p>
<p>But that’s not the reason for this post.  AB reader Bakho provides the real reason for this post by pointing out that <a href="http://blog.washingtonpost.com/cheney/chapters/a_strong_push_from_back_stage/index.html">Dick Cheney</a> made the fiscal decisions over the past 6.5 years:</p>
<blockquote><p>The president had accepted Cheney&#8217;s diagnosis that the sluggish economy needed a jolt, overruling senior economic advisers who forecast dangerous budget deficits. But Bush rejected one of Cheney&#8217;s remedies: deep reductions in the capital gains tax on investments. The vice president &#8220;was just hot on that,&#8221; said Cesar Conda, then Cheney&#8217;s domestic policy adviser. &#8220;It goes to show you: He wins and he loses, and he lost on that one.&#8221; Not for long. As the Republican lawmakers debated in a closed-door session at the Greenbrier resort, the vice president revived the argument, touting his idea as a way to energize a stock market battered by scandals such as Enron. House allies inserted Cheney&#8217;s cut into their package. But that came at the expense of one of Bush&#8217;s priorities: abolishing the tax on stock dividends.</p></blockquote>
<p>We need to interrupt this take given the line ‘stock scandals such as Enron”.  We need to mention the bit of Andersen endorsed accounting fraud over at Halliburton when its CEO was Dick Cheney.  Sorry for the interruption:</p>
<blockquote><p>And it was Cheney who served as the guardian of conservative orthodoxy on budget and tax matters. He shaped and pushed through Bush&#8217;s tax cuts, blunting the influence of Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan , a longtime friend, and of Cabinet rivals he had played a principal role in selecting. He managed to overcome the president&#8217;s &#8220;compassionate conservative&#8221; resistance to multiple breaks for the wealthy &#8230; The vice president chairs a budget review board, a panel the Bush administration created to set spending priorities and serve as arbiter when Cabinet members appeal decisions by White House budget officials. The White House has portrayed the board as a device to keep Bush from wasting time on petty disagreements, but previous administrations have seldom seen Cabinet-level disputes in that light. Cheney&#8217;s leadership of the panel gives him direct and indirect power over the federal budget &#8211; and over those who must live within it &#8230; When Sen. James M. Jeffords (Vt.) threatened to bolt the GOP during negotiations over the president&#8217;s 2001 tax package, senior Bush advisers and Republican senators were deeply split over whether to buy him off. It was a momentous decision &#8211; a Jeffords defection would toss the Senate to Democratic control for the first time since 1994.  But in a contentious internal debate, the vice president forcefully argued that the administration should not capitulate by giving Jeffords the billions of dollars in special-education funding he sought, recalled O&#8217;Keefe, at the time deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget. O&#8217;Keefe said Cheney argued that the White House should not sacrifice conservative principle in the face of Jeffords&#8217;s threat by scaling back tax cuts dear to the GOP base in order to create an expensive new mandate. Gramm, who confirmed that account, said there would have been no end to such demands if the president had caved.  &#8220;The principle was &#8216;Hell, we can&#8217;t go around funding programs based on what some individual might do,'&#8221; said Gramm, who worked closely with Cheney during the negotiations. By the end of the critical meeting, O&#8217;Keefe said, the divided group presented Cheney&#8217;s view as the consensus recommendation to the president. Bush&#8217;s $1.35 trillion tax cut passed, and Jeffords defected as promised. Such stands by Cheney were not uncommon, said Bolten, the White House chief of staff. Cheney often stepped in if he sensed the administration was softening its commitment to Republican &#8220;first principles,&#8221; Bolten said, and he was &#8220;a pretty vigorous voice for holding the line on spending and for holding the line on tax cuts.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Sorry but I really need to interrupt again.  Lines like living within a budget or holding the line on spending just don’t apply to this Administration.  To even suggest that the Cheney Administration is fiscally conservative is at odds with the facts.  After all, Dick argues “deficits don’t matter”.</p>
<p>Apparently, Cheney did meet with economists, but &#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>The vice president regularly convenes a kitchen cabinet of diverse outside economic experts, often before the president is about to make a major decision. Members of the group describe a man who enjoys the nitty-gritty of economics, poring over charts of obscure data such as freight-car loadings and quizzing experts on the subtle ways the government can influence the economy. &#8220;With the president it was much shorter. It&#8217;s &#8216;Marty, what do you think of where we stand today?'&#8221; said Martin Feldstein, a Harvard economics professor and the president and chief executive of the National Bureau of Economic Research. &#8220;It&#8217;s also a less technical presentation.&#8221; R. Glenn Hubbard, Bush&#8217;s former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, said of Cheney: &#8220;I&#8217;d have conversations with him that were at a level of detail that those with the president were not.&#8221; In the weeks following the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, as the White House was putting together an economic recovery package, Cheney gathered his kitchen cabinet, frequently interrupting the experts as he furiously jotted notes on a stack of cards embossed with the vice presidential seal. What kind of tax cuts are needed? Cheney wanted to know. How big? A few days later, Cheney was &#8220;on fire&#8221; when he met with the president, Cheney&#8217;s chief of staff, I. Lewis &#8220;Scooter&#8221; Libby, later told Conda. Cheney had decided that the best way to shake business leaders out of their post-attack paralysis was to let them immediately write off the cost of new plants and equipment. After hearing him out, Bush made Cheney&#8217;s idea a centerpiece of his plan. In previous administrations, such initiatives typically have been generated by the Treasury Department or the White House economic team. But Cheney has made the vice president&#8217;s office a hub of tax policy, enabled by the fact that &#8220;this president appears to want to have Treasury take the orders from the White House,&#8221; said John H. Makin, an economist and an informal Cheney adviser. All this put Cheney in a position to outflank some of Bush&#8217;s top advisers, and even his old friend Greenspan, to shape the administration&#8217;s signature tax package: the 2003 cuts that Cheney sold at the Greenbrier resort in West Virginia. As far as Greenspan knew, the vice president agreed with him on the danger of the tax package Bush was contemplating. The Federal Reserve chairman worried that the sheer size of the cuts would drown the federal budget in red ink. Cheney and Greenspan met regularly, far more often than the Fed chief met with Bush, according to interviews and Greenspan&#8217;s calendar. And when the president did meet with Greenspan, Cheney was nearly always in the room. The vice president and the Fed chairman had formed a close bond when both served in the Ford administration. The Fed chief saw the vice president as a conduit to a president he did not know nearly as well, someone he could trust to fairly present his views to Bush. So Greenspan sent Cheney a study by one of the central bank&#8217;s senior economists showing that big deficits lead to higher long-term interest rates, according to a person with firsthand knowledge. Higher rates, Greenspan believed, would wipe out any short-term benefit from a tax cut. In subsequent meetings with the Fed chief, Cheney never took issue with the study. What Greenspan did not know was that, behind the scenes, the vice president took steps to undermine an argument that could threaten the big tax cut he favored. Conda, the vice president&#8217;s aide, said Cheney asked him to critique the study. Conda attached his own memo arguing that the Fed&#8217;s analytical model was flawed. He said &#8220;it wasn&#8217;t my job to know&#8221; what Cheney did with the paperwork, but noted that Greenspan&#8217;s study did not gain traction inside the White House. Aside from Greenspan, Cheney had faced down opposition from many of the administration&#8217;s senior economic voices, including Daniels, Treasury Secretary Paul H. O&#8217;Neill and Commerce Secretary Donald L. Evans. They believed that the economy was recovering and that a deep tax cut wasn&#8217;t needed. Daniels said he worried that it would undermine the GOP message of fiscal discipline. Cheney, however, pressed his argument that the economy needed a jump-start. He wanted not only to reduce the tax on dividends but also to cut the capital gains tax and accelerate income tax breaks for top earners, according to Daniels, Conda, Hubbard and others. Conda said Cheney subscribed to the view of supply-side economists that when government cuts taxes the economy grows, generating additional tax revenue that largely offsets the losses from lower tax rates.  The standoff came to a head in late November 2002, during a meeting in the Roosevelt Room. O&#8217;Neill continued to oppose the tax cut on grounds that the government was moving toward &#8220;fiscal crisis,&#8221; irritating Cheney. &#8220;The vice president really got a sense of where O&#8217;Neill was coming from and surmised it was a problem,&#8221; Conda said. The following month, Cheney would demand O&#8217;Neill&#8217;s resignation.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, Cheney treated economic advice in the same way he treated intelligence before the invasion of Iraq.  He had his mind made up and anything that supported the pre-ordained policy was listened to.  Anything else was ignored with the advisor at times being fired.</p>

                                <p>I heard Mitt Romney has been saying the country is headed in the wrong direction, so I ran a google search and found <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0607/4631.html">this</a>. Assuming its accurate, what&#8217;s the message?</p>
<p>Well, Romney has both Hubbard and Mankiw as advisors, not to mention at least one National Review type. Neither Hubbard nor Mankiw resigned in protest, so they both thought GW was following the right policies. Neither, as far as I know, has since made noise about GW doing things the wrong way. Put another way&#8230; Romney thinks that the country is headed in the wrong direction, and he&#8217;s hired two of the architects of that wrong direction to give him advice.</p>
<p>Which means&#8230; he thinks that he can make things better by continuing the same policies with the same people just by replacing GW.  Talk about Bush Derangement Syndrome.</p>

                                <p>This post looks at the <a href="http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/poverty/histpov/hstpov2.html"> percentage of people living below the poverty level</a> over time. Here’s a graph of what it looks like, for as far back as the Census keeps data.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RoECQZumksI/AAAAAAAAAVA/zvAk6tg7nM8/s1600-h/poverty,+graph.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RoECQZumksI/AAAAAAAAAVA/zvAk6tg7nM8/s320/poverty,+graph.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>From the graph its pretty clear… if there were two periods in which poverty declined, it was during the JFK/LBJ administrations, and during the Clinton administration. It seems to have meandered during the Nixon/Ford years, risen and the fallen (to end more or less unchanged) over the Reagan years, and risen during the Carter and two Bush administrations. (Editorial comment… There I go again with my Bush derangement syndrome… noticing that the Bush League Boys just didn’t perform. And the fact that I point out that Carter didn’t go anywhere either… its still BDS, because putting GW in there with history’s greatest monster is patently unfair.) </p>
<p>Here’s a summary…</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RoECK5umkrI/AAAAAAAAAU4/al3ukAJaTao/s1600-h/poverty,+table+1.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RoECK5umkrI/AAAAAAAAAU4/al3ukAJaTao/s320/poverty,+table+1.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>And what drives poverty? Some quick and dirty correlations between the percentage change in the poverty rate and two series: the percentage change in the <a href="http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/histinc/f04.html">Gini ratio</a> and <a href="http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/histinc/p07ar.html">real median income</a>. (Note&#8230; Gini ratio is for families, real median income and poverty is for individuals&#8230; I simply can&#8217;t find the Gini ratio for individuals. Sorry.)</p>

<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br />Update!!!!  The original Table 2 was incorrect.  Verbage rewritten &#8211; may affect some of the comments people left.  Apologies!!!<br />&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>So what do we learn… there does seem to be a positive correlation between the gini ratio and poverty… higher poverty rates are associated with more inequality.  Note&#8230; leaving out the jump in the Gini in 1993 (see yesterday&#8217;s post)&#8230; the correlation between poverty and Gini goes up to .41.  </p>
<p>But the relationship between real median income and the poverty rate is stronger. Much stronger. Faster increases in real median income (repeat, median) are associated with decreases in the poverty rate. And faster increases in real median income in any given year are even more strongly correlated with real median income in later years.</p>
<p>Nothing in this post seems like a surprise to me.</p>
<p>Coming soon…. Justice!</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>Update&#8230;  Figures in Table 2 were wrong when this post was first posted.  Thanks to Sebastian Holsclaw for pointing out a discrepancy and making me check the work again.</p>
<p>Wrong the second time too!!!! Apologies!!!</p>

<p>What does supporting the troops mean to you? If you ignore looking at these things, can you claim you are in the support category?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19187272">&#8220;Lead researcher Mark Kaplan of Portland State University in Oregon&#8221;</a> reports that</p>
<blockquote><p>male U.S. veterans are twice as likely to die by suicide than people with no military service, and are more likely to kill themselves with a gun than others who commit suicide….</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong><br />
<blockquote>The study tracked 320,890 U.S. men, about a third of whom served in the U.S. military between 1917 and 1994. The rest had no military background.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong><br />
<blockquote>Of the veterans, about 29 percent served in the Vietnam War, 28 percent in World War Two, 16 percent in the Korean War and the rest in other conflicts up through the 1991 Gulf War.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong><br />
<blockquote>Those who committed suicide were more likely to have been white, better educated and older than the other men, the researchers found. The most acute risk was among veterans with some sort of a health problem that made them unable to participate fully in home, work or leisure activities.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong><br />
<blockquote>The researchers said unlike some previous studies on suicides among U.S. military veterans, theirs did not focus on Vietnam War-era veterans or veterans who get health care through the Department of Veterans Affairs system. They said three-quarters of veterans do not receive health care through VA facilities.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18488585/">Both the VA and the Pentagon in recent weeks have acknowledged</a> a need to improve “mental health treatment”. Jan Kemp, a VA associate director for education who works on mental health, has estimated there are up to 1,000 suicides a year among veterans within the VA system, and as many as 5,000 a year among all living veterans.</p>
<p>A recent investigation by the Government Accountability Office found that just 22 percent of U.S. troops returning from Iraq and Afghanistan who showed signs of PTSD were being referred by Pentagon health care providers for mental health evaluation, citing inconsistent and subjective standards in determining when treatment was needed.</p>
<p>Penny Coleman is the widow of a Vietnam Veteran who took his own life after coming home. Her latest book, Flashback: Posttraumatic Stress Disorder, Suicide and the Lessons of War, was released on Memorial Day, 2006. In a moving and compassionate way she outlines how ignoring this cost as an externality reverberates for years. She includes in her book how new discussions of human costs of war re-trigger old wounds and, in my mind, might have something to do with the irritability that readers mention about people they know.</p>
<p>And off topic but another problem faces soldiers. <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18506417/page/2/">Military and family law experts don’t know how big the problem is</a>, but 5.4 percent of active duty members — more than 74,000 — are “single parents”, the Department of Defense reports. More than 68,000 Guard and reserve members are also single parents. Divorce among service personnel is rising.</p>
<p>Custody battles for male or female soldiers is a problem. Hence we have not looked at what conflicts might exist between reasonable laws of family, children, and supporting troops. Family court versus federal law. Why not?..it is a well known problem, and tangled.</p>
<p>To summarize posts to date:</p>
<p>The military admits to recognizing a real problem that warrants funding in addition to regular care.</p>
<p>To admit to symptoms means loss of career advancement for many. The actual hostility (soldier to soldier and superiors) to admitting symptoms is quite robust, but to date I have only anecdotal evidence.</p>
<p>To seek help is to run into major barriers in VA, Tricare, and private insurers, depending on how you access your insurance. This includes your family as well.</p>
<p>The costs in the short run, much less long run remains as an externality to the cost of war. On the other hand, as more is known, it is harder to ignore.</p>
<p>The system to date appears to prevent best practice and good research from taking the lead as the metric seems to be geared to demand reduction rather than treatment efficacy in this realm of the cognitive sciences. Both public and private funding sources appear to use this metric.</p>
<p>Research is headed in the direction that PTSD is brain based and body based, and has been around awhile, and could help most soldiers and ex-soldiers and families. It is clearly diagnosable and treatments are successful.</p>
