                                <div>From the <a href="http://articles.nydailynews.com/2012-08-22/news/33326609_1_brooklyn-residents-borough-president-marty-markowitz-fort-greene">NY Daily News</a> comes a <i>Tale of Two Cities </i>(and does not include rural poverty):</div>
<p>
<blockquote>We have more poor people in Brooklyn than the entire population of Detroit; we have more people on food stamps than the entire population of Washington, D.C.,” Gelber said. “Yet there are more wealthy people than in Greenwich, Conn.”</p>
<p>The Daily News scoured Brooklyn for telling statistics about the extremes of grimness and glamor gripping the split-personality borough, and found:</p>
<p>-Sixty-nine people have been shot this year in Brownsville. Four miles away, a mansion at 70 Willow St. in Brooklyn Heights sold for the borough’s highest-ever home price of $12.5 million. -Brooklyn sent five athletes to the Olympics but one in four borough residents is obese. -Brooklyn has 113 colleges and universities but only 29% of borough residents have college degrees.</p>
<p>“It’s absolutely a tale of two Brooklyns, right out of Dickens,” said Joel Berg, executive director of the New York City Coalition Against Hunger. “The divide is getting wider every year.”</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Waves of gentrification that started in the 1980s have brought an influx of mega-bucks and turned once-grimy neighborhoods like Williamsburg into magnets for the rich and trendy.</p>
<p>A big crime reduction in the 1990s was a main driver of moneyed people into Brooklyn, said Jonathan Bowles, director of the Center for an Urban Future. Several years ago, the well-heeled stopped seeing Brooklyn as a bargain-priced alternative to Manhattan — but kept coming anyway.</p>
<p>“It’s an increasingly difficult borough to be middle class,” said Bowles, citing Windsor Terrace and Kensington as neighborhoods where rising real estate prices are displacing moderate-income residents.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>Part III &#8211; How to think about time series data.</p>
<p>For reference:<br />Part II  <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/09/why-spendinggdp-is-terrible-horrible-no.html">Federal Spending as a Fraction of GDP</a></p>
<p>Part I  <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/09/a-quick-look-at-federal-spending.html">Federal Spending Growth</a></p>
<p>Some  commentors to the previous posts have rightly concluded that I consider  spending under Obama in the context of historical trends.  In fact, if  you don&#8217;t consider historical trends, you are ignoring the most  important element of context that is available.  I only mentioned trends  briefly in Part II, but the directional changes in the graphs of Parts I  and II implicitly suggest them.</p>
<p>Time series data that  relate to the size of the population, the government, or the economy  generally follow a quasi-exponential growth pattern.  I say <i>quasi-</i> because a perfect exponential growth pattern  results from a continuous  constant rate of growth, while real world growth rates vary from year.   Graph 3 of Part II shows how these variations have occurred over  several decades.  Usually this does not result in a large or permanent  deformation in the shape of a quasi-exponential curve, since the growth  rate typically oscillates irregularly around a mean value that only  changes slowly over time.</p>
<p>Graph 2 in Part II shows that  the spending and GDP growth curves stay close to exponential tracks  over long time spans.  It also illustrates that the recent recession was  one of those rare times when growth rates deviated substantially.</p>
<p>Human  eye-brain coordination doesn&#8217;t deal well with exponential curve  shapes.  Straight lines are much easier to comprehend and extrapolate.   Graphing quasi-exponential data on a log scale reduces the curve to a  quasi-straight line that is much easier to use and understand.</p>
<p>Graph  1 shows Federal Spending and GDP, since 1995, plotted on a log scale.   Constant growth results in a straight line segment, and a higher growth  rate causes a steeper slope.  Zero growth shows up as a horizontal  line.   I&#8217;ve again included a line for 5 times spending, to get a close  overlay with the GDP line.</p>

<p>There  is an upward bend in the spending line in 2000.  This is most easily  seen in the blue line.  During the 90&#8217;s, we can see that GDP grew faster  than spending.  In 2001-2, GDP growth flat-lined, as expected during a  recession. Then, from 20002 to 2008, the growth rates for GDP and  spending were close to identical.  Both lines twist during the most  recent recession.  Curiously, spending growth was flat for a large  portion of 2008.</p>
<p>Since the recession, the spending lines are very close to flat, and GDP growth has been anemic.  Here is a close up.</p>

<p>Graph 3 provides context, all the way back to 1947.  Ponder the inflection points and slope changes at your leisure.</p>

<p>Note  that there are only two flat-ish spots in the spending lines: now, and  during the Eisenhower administration. The current administration has, at  least temporarily, broken the decades-long trend in continuous spending  increases.  </p>
<p>To emphasize the obvious, spending growth  is now very close to zero.  In context, this is remarkable.  Saying  Obama is a profligate spender is a lie.  </p>
<p>In this post, I am not suggesting that the rate of spending growth under any president is good, bad, appropriate or inappropriate.  I am only pointing out what was and is.  </p>
<p>So, this is how you think about time series data.<br />0)  Forget your preconceived notions.    (Frex:I had no idea that spending  growth has essentially stopped until I looked at the data.)<br />1) Identify trends. The history of time series data provides meaningful context.<br />2) Identify break points and trend changes.  These are key data points.<br />3) Note the directions of these changes.<br />4) Think hard about what these observations are actually telling you, not what you want them to say.<br />5) Double down on 4) if you are looking at a ratio.  Ponder that denominator. <br />6) Don&#8217;t cherry pick.  It&#8217;s dishonest.</p>
<p>There  are a lot of ways to look at a data set: linear and log scales, rate of  change, etc.  Chose the one that gives the clearest picture of the data  you want to analyze, or simplifies the analysis, or makes it easier to  understand.  Studying different views can be informative, as can a  comparison of different data sets.  </p>
<p><a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?g=ara">Here is the working page at FRED for the graphs in this post</a>.  I encourage the interested reader to spend some time working with the capabilities of this very powerful tool.</p>
<p>Editorial Comment:<br />In  case it&#8217;s not obvious, I&#8217;ll tell you that I write these posts because  they interest me and I think they generate some knowledge, or at least  information, that is worth sharing.  I have virtually no interest in the  fool&#8217;s errand of convincing anybody that I am right &#8211; either the data  analysis convinces you or it doesn&#8217;t.  So unless you have better data,  or can point out some specific flaw in my reasoning [and then tell me  specifically and in detail how to get it right] don&#8217;t bother arguing  with me.</p>
<p>I appreciate rational discourse, and am always  willing to engage thoughtful readers. I&#8217;m also willing to be proven  wrong by a cogent argument.  That said, though, I don&#8217;t really care if  anyone comments.  At this point, I&#8217;d <i>almost</i> rather nobody  did.  But if you chose to, please do me the courtesy of having your  comment be somewhere in the general vicinity of on-topic.  And &#8211; fair  warning: naked assertions and unsubstantiated ideologically approved  talking points will be scoffed at, so please check that nonsense at the  door.</p>

                                <p>I overheard a conversation at a local restaurant on the impact of the US being dependent on China buying US bonds to finance federal debt.  Usullay missing from such conversations is the % of money involved, whether that is a lot, and what effect it has on federal debt and trade (and some kind of political or &#8216;war&#8217; value?)  Then via <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2012/09/fear-of-china-syndrome.html">Mark Thoma</a> came the Krugman piece on bonds and how the market works in Fear of China syndrome, so thought I would post the Krugman piece and some comment by Mark Sadowski from the post:</p>
<blockquote><p>Paul Krugman tries, once again, to explain why there&#8217;s no reason to fear that &#8220;terrible things will happen&#8221; if China stops purchasing our government bonds:</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/05/wicksell-goes-to-china/">Wicksell Goes To China, by Paul Krugman</a>: </p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><blockquote>The idea that we are at the mercy of the Chinese — that terrible things would happen if they stopped buying our bonds — is <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/05/opinion/its-mitts-world.html?_r=1&#038;hp">very influential</a>. Yet it’s <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/30/fear-of-china-syndrome/">just wrong</a>.<br />Think of it this way: the argument that interest rates would soar if the Chinese bought fewer bonds is the same as the argument that interest rates would soar when the U.S. government sold more bonds — which, as you may recall, was the subject of <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/05/02/liquidity-preference-loanable-funds-and-niall-ferguson-wonkish/">fierce debate</a> more than three years ago — and you know how that turned out. </p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><blockquote>Again, you can think of this in terms <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/04/natural-born-recovery-killers/">Wicksell</a>: we’re in a situation in which the incipient supply of savings — the amount that people would save at full employment — is greater than the incipient demand for investment. And this excess supply of savings leads to a depressed economy. </p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><blockquote>What China does by buying bonds is add to the excess savings — which makes our situation worse. (This is just another way of saying that the artificial trade surplus hurts our economy — just another way of stating the same thing). And we want them to do less of it; far from fearing that they will stop, we should welcome the prospect.</p>

<p>Mark A. Sadowski said in reply to Matt C&#8230;</p>
<p> This is old news. FYI QE2 ended in June of 2011.</p>
<p>On June 30, 2011 the Fed held $1,617 billion worth of Treasuries:<br />http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h41/20110630/</p>
<p>According to the most recent release (August 30) the Fed now holds $1,639 billion worth of Treasuries.<br />http://ftalphaville.ft.com/blog/2012/08/31/1140881/if-qe3-is-so-close-why-is-the-feds-balance-sheet-shrinking/</p>
<p>According to SIFMA:<br />http://www.sifma.org/research/statistics.aspx</p>
<p>$1,274 billion in Treasuries were issued between the end of June 2011 and the end of July 2012, meaning the Fed has bought less than 2% of all Treasuries issued in that time.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Fed&#8217;s balance sheet has actually been shrinking since December. That&#8217;s why there are tons of stories such as this if you bother to do the google:<br />http://ftalphaville.ft.com/blog/2012/08/31/1140881/if-qe3-is-so-close-why-is-the-feds-balance-sheet-shrinking/<br />..<br /><i>Correct current release lin</i>k:<br />http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h41/Current/</p>
<p>Matt C asked:<br />Even if QE2 is old news, what is the big change in the financial landscape since 2011?</p>
<p>Was it not bad in 2011 for China to be buying bonds then? If China was depressing the economy by buying bonds then, why wasn&#8217;t QE2 doing the same thing?</p>
<p>Mark A. Sadowski answers:<br />It makes a big difference who&#8217;s buying the bonds.</p>
<p>Krugman describes the situation as an excess of savings over desired investment. But another way of looking at it is as an excess demand for money over its supply.</p>
<p>When the Chinese buy US Treasury bonds they increase the demand for US dollars and drive up the dollar&#8217;s value (they were of course doing this intentionally to increase their net exports). When the Fed buys bonds they&#8217;re adding to the supply of dollars. This of course drives down the value of the dollar.</p>
<p>Increased demand for dollars is depressing. Increased supply of dollars is stimulative.</p>

<p> US wages trail 10 OECD countries, but with higher unemployment than 9 of them</p>
<p> Contra <a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/2012/09/new_labor.php">Eric Cantor</a>, Labor Day celebrates the importance of labor and the labor movement in American history. But the bluster of Cantor, where he celebrates the so-called job creators, does illustrate that organized labor has been in decline in this country for quite some time.    </p>
<p>One result of having a <a href="http://middleclasspoliticaleconomist.blogspot.com/2011/09/labor-day-us-has-fifth-lowest-union.html">weak labor movement</a> is that average wages in the United States have fallen behind those of 10 other industrialized democracies that are members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). What is most confounding, for Republicans at least, is that nine of these countries also have lower unemployment, which contradicts their view that high wages (and <a href="http://middleclasspoliticaleconomist.blogspot.com/2011/09/labor-day-of-nine-oecd-members-with.html">high minimum wages</a>) harm employment.     </p>
<p>The table below below is constructed from data at OECD StatExtracts, showing the average earnings of all wage and salary workers in each country, as well as its most recent unemployment rate (usually July 2012).<br />Source: <a href="http://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx#">OECD StatExtracts</a>.</p>

<p>For average wages, select data by theme, then labour, then earnings, then average annual wages, and use &#8220;2011 USD exchange rates and 2011 constant prices&#8221; for each country. For unemployment, select data by theme, then labour, then labour force statistics, then short-term statistics, then short-term labour market statistics, then harmonized unemployment rates.<br />    <br />This table does not make use of purchasing power parity (PPP) conversions to wages (and the U.S. in fact has the highest wages when adjusted for PPP), for a very important reason. Essentially, the PPP calculation adjusts actual exchange rates for differences in the cost of living between countries. In practice, this means downward adjustments for expensive countries like Norway (where I had a personal pan pizza for $25 on my honeymoon six years ago; the <i>New York Times</i> recently published <a href="http://frugaltraveler.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/24/scandinavia-on-125-a-day/?ref=travel">more examples</a>) and upward adjustments for developing countries and even Eastern European countries. As I note in <a href="http://us.macmillan.com/investmentincentivesandtheglobalcompetitionforcapital/KennethPThomas"><i>Investment Incentives and the Global Competition for Capital</i></a>, gross national income per capita for the Czech Republic in 2006 was $12,680 at actual exchange rates, but $21,470 at PPP (page 99).<br />    <br />The reason we should ignore PPP when dealing with wages and jobs is that a company deciding to invest in one place rather than another has to pay the wages using the actual exchange rate and is not affected by PPP. Thus, if there is an effect of wages on employment, that will be a response to what an employer actually has to pay to hire someone, not a hypothetical measure of how well off the worker is in terms of PPP-adjusted dollars. The data here does not show any negative effect of wages on unemployment.<br />    <br />Moreover, I would argue that living in a high-wage, high-cost location has distinct advantages over living in a low-wage, low cost location, even if after adjusting for cost of living (via PPP or within a single country) the lower wage location has &#8220;higher&#8221; pay. One important reason is that having extra cash gives you extra options. You will have a higher retirement benefit and will keep it if you move to a lower-cost area, whereas the reverse is not possible. You will have better quality services on average, particularly health care. It is far easier for you to vacation in a low-cost location than it will be for someone in a low-cost location to vacation to a high-cost location ($25 personal pan pizzas!).</p>
<p>Your high salary will be the benchmark if you take a job in a lower-cost location. If you economize from the standard basket of goods used to measure cost of living, your benefit will be higher in the high-cost area. Of course, a full treatment of this issue requires another post, but the big point is that high wages do not necessarily create unemployment and reducing wages is not the route to middle class prosperity.</p>

<p>New Report on Getting the Best Care</p>
<p>Both Matthew Yglesias at Slate and Sarah Kliff at WonkBlog and a host of other sites have posted some interesting results coming out of a recent study by the Institute of Medicine  <a href="http://iom.edu/~/media/Files/Report%20Files/2012/Best-Care/Best%20Care%20at%20Lower%20Cost_Recs.pdf">Best Care at Lower Cost: The Path to Continuously Learning Health Care in America</a>. </p>
<p>Unfortunately as a lowly and unpaid (99% of the time) blogger, I do not have access to the entire report. What I do have is a abstract of what the report is about and some of the charts placed on <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/09/07/we-spend-750-billion-on-unnecessary-health-care-two-charts-explain-why/">Wonkblog</a>.</p>
<p>We spend $750 billion on unnecessary health care. Two charts explain why. This report documents much of the whys to a much needed Healthcare Reform in the numeric of it. Phillip Longman in his book  <i>The Best Care Anywhere</i>  touches upon a similar transition in the VA administration and the experiences of his and Timothy Noah&#8217;s wives in being treated for cancer. Unfortunately, the best named hospitals and the best insurance does not guarantee the best care. Too much is spent inefficiently on the wrong type of care.</p>
<p><a href="http://lh6.ggpht.com/-nmEYytaUnt4/UEyU4-02oYI/AAAAAAAABAQ/NZ5WB2Ry20o/s1600-h/clip_image002%25255B3%25255D.jpg"><img alt="clip_image002" border="0" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/-gWO_1R8_LwQ/UEyU5MOIJII/AAAAAAAABAY/DhgNPBzveDo/clip_image002_thumb.jpg?imgmax=800" title="clip_image002"></a></p>
<p>The second series of chart is an accounting of how some of these expenditures are made within the system. Again, this is something which Phillip Longman touched upon with his book on the VA and how they overcame the inefficiencies. Sarah Kliff at Wonkblog calls it creating an environment in which it is easy to create waste. When healthcare and its associated industries were not the monsters in cost, no one paid attention to the cost, loss of efficiency, and the lack of quality outcome in treating patients. We spent for the services and not the outcome with the results being a higher cost.</p>
<p><a href="http://lh6.ggpht.com/-t6BCYKvXfgQ/UEyU5v2z9uI/AAAAAAAABAg/Ip6xXZHa_RM/s1600-h/clip_image004%25255B3%25255D.jpg"><img alt="clip_image004" border="0" height="150" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/-WVkHKxG-csU/UEyU5_8NAGI/AAAAAAAABAo/P2jJ3KfoqJw/clip_image004_thumb.jpg?imgmax=800" title="clip_image004" width="500"></a></p>
<p>Constantly targeted within today&#8217;s healthcare system is the cost of treating the elderly. While it is true as we grow older, the costs of treating us increase due to our aging and failure to care for ourselves. Within the system it is easy to have increased waste as treatments and records may not be logged to computer leading to duplicate treatments and a lack of coordination amongst way to many doctors in treating patients. It has happened where a group of consulting doctors can be describing treatments when the oncologist knows there is little more to be done.</p>
<p>What does the IOM recommend? I will leave you with Sarah Kliff&#8217;s post on Wonk Blog to find out. <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/09/07/we-spend-750-billion-on-unnecessary-health-care-two-charts-explain-why/"><i>What&#8217;s Possible for Healthcare</i></a></p>
<p>Getting back to today&#8217;s politics between Romney and Ryan vs Obama, would you want more of the same? More of today&#8217;s private market with its rising healthcare cost is precisely what is being advocated by Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan. More to come.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not just the ice in the arctic ocean that&#8217;s been melting&#8230;last week, <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/08/120815121318.htm">analysis of satellite photographs confirmed that greenland had already also exceeded it&#8217;s one season melt record on August 8th</a>, almost a full month before the normal end of the melt season on that large island&#8230;the record ice loss had been anticipated after <a href="http://phys.org/news262352789.html#nRlv">an unprecedented 4 day thaw over 97% of the ice sheet in mid-july</a>; also, a nearly obscure <a href="http://nsidc.org/arcticseaicenews/2012/07/">last item in the NSIDC&#8217;s first July Arctic Sea Ice News &#038; Analysis bulletin</a> noted that the<a href="http://climatechangepsychology.blogspot.com/2012/08/northern-hemisphere-land-snow-cover.html"> snow cover in the northern hemisphere in June had melted to such an extent that it beat the 45 year record low a month early</a>, breaking the 2010 record by 1 million square kilometers&#8230;<a href="http://thewe.cc/weplanet/news/glaciers_melting.htm">much of this snowpack loss is from higher elevations, where downstream cities depend on a continuous release of ice-melt for their water supply</a>&#8230;</p>
<p>Arguably, the loss of seasonal of snow &#038; ice on land masses is a more serious problem than over the arctic sea, because it adds to sea level rise, and most of the world&#8217;s major port cities are built at sea level; you might recall the illustration we used <a href="http://marketwatch666.blogspot.com/2011/02/notes-on-week-ended-jan-29th.html">when discussing greenland&#8217;s ice-loss in 2010:</a> if all the snow pack loss from greenland that year were to be dumped at once on low lying new jersey, <a href="http://www.climatecentral.org/gallery/maps/envisioning_ice_loss/#/NJ">it would cover new jersey with 257 feet of snow</a> &#8230; <a href="http://energybulletin.net/stories/2012-01-03/hansen-still-argues-5m-21st-c-sea-level-rise-possible">James Hansen, the head of NASA&#8217;s goddard institute, believes that a 5 meter sea level rise is possible this century</a> as the Greenland antarctic ice sheets rapidly melt&#8230;</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>I have been trying to write a post on what could be achieved by Fed purchases of agency issued MBS.  My only new point is that the MBS price that matters is the price paid to Fannie/Freddie/Ginnie not the price on the secondary market.  That is, the price that matters is the price of new MBS &#8212; the money sent in the direction of people who build houses now and of other people who refinance their mortgages now.  The price of outstanding MBS does not affect the housing market except through expectations.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/09/open-e-mail-to-joe-gagnon.html">Recall</a> Gagnon&#8217;s proposal to drive the prime mortgage rate to 3% by unlimited purchases of agency issued MBS for at least a year.  Here the point is that the only MBS purchases that would matter are purchases of new MBS.  T<a href="http://www.insidemortgagefinance.com/issues/imfpubs_igse/10_34/latest_data/GSE-MBS-Business-Surges-in-1Q-2012-Due-to-Refi-1000019555-1.html">he flow of Fannie + Freddie purchases of mortgages is around $300 Billion a quarter</a> (about the same as the flow of QEII purchases).  Sorry I don&#8217;t know abou Ginnie Mae the inventor of the MBS.  Also the flow would increase (which is the whole point of the operation).</p>
<p>If the Fed pays much more than anyone else is willing to pay for MBS, there is no way for private investors to undo the operation by speculating.  They would have to issue government agency issued MBS to do so.  They can make side bets and the price of assets which pay the same as agency issued MBS on that side bet market would be lower than the price paid to the agencies.  It also wouldn&#8217;t matter to the agencies or to home builders, home buyers, mortgage refinancers or mortgage initiators.</p>
<p>Oh and if definitely more than $ 300 billion a quarter (maybe twice that) sounds like a lot, recall that Joe Gagnon is the guy who used the quantity $ 5 Trillion in his initial proposal.</p>
<p>Update:  Mark Sadowski can navigate the SIFMA site better than I can.  My effort to extrapolate from one quarter was off by about $300 billion ($300 billion here $300 billion there and soon you&#8217;re talking real money).  Also they have data from Ginnie Mae (the inventors of the MBS). </p>
<p><a href="http://www.blogger.com/profile/08259309059705236763" rel="nofollow">Mark A. Sadowski</a> Sep 8, 2012 12:45:00 PM <a href="http://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=5048766&#038;postID=5650383320312468405" title="Delete Comment"> </a>
<div>Last year Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae issued $590,300,<br />$301,100 and $327,000 million in U.S. Agency MBS for a total of $1,218,400 million. I got this from SIFMA:</p>
<p>http://www.sifma.org/research/statistics.aspx</p>
<p>It&#8217;s still true that the Fed may have to call more than $1,218,400 from the vasty deep to follow Gagnon&#8217;s instructions &#8212; there must still be some private label issues and they will be crowded out and, more importantly, the whole point is to get more mortgages written (either for new purchases or refinancing).  But it sure is true that Mark Sadowski got the numbers I couldn&#8217;t find.</p></div>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>In August <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/08/polls-and-reporting.html">I discussed</a> the possibility that people were trying to use a bit of money to fiddle with the poll of polls.  My hypothesis was that now that averages of polls are getting more attention than the well known polls taken alone (a reasonable change in emphasis) it is possible to make the average poll for a candidate look better by setting up a polling organisation with no track record and credibility and issuing fiddled polls (so that it will never have any credibility).  Since political operatives all agree that a poll which would be good news if value is good for a candidate, the bogus polls would be designed to give the favored candidate high mis-measured support.</p>
<p>Since this requires no lack of money and a lack of scruples, I would guess that the new pollsters who only hope to get tossed into an average favor Republicans.</p>
<p>My August list started with Foster McCollum White Baydoun which for which <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/20/aug-20-when-the-polling-gets-weird/">Nate Silver (of fivethirtyeight)</a> estimated an 11% pro Republican house effect.  It also included &#8220;We Ask America&#8221; and &#8220;Purples Strategies.&#8221;  The CEO of Purple Strategies is Alex Castellanos who is not only a political operative but also notorious for the most recent (now blessedly decadesold) ad which directly appealed to white anger about race (the white hands ad).  Now he and a Dino who handled pr for BP are giving fair and balanced polling (fair and balanced being used in the Fox News sense).<br />Rasmussen is different.  I think their success in pulling perceptions towards Republicans in spite of their demonstrated statistical bias (3.8% in 2010) is the cause of the new strategy.</p>
<p>After that too long introduction, I have an addition to the list Gravis Marketing.  People much better informed than I about polls and pollsters haven&#8217;t heard of them.    <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/30/aug-29-so-much-depends-upon-ohio/">They have a Republican house effect.</a> according to Nate Silver  Importantly, Silver only partially removes house effects from his averages, and other aggregators don&#8217;t remove them at all.  Back to <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/20/aug-20-when-the-polling-gets-weird/">the first link</a> to Silver discussing Foster McCollum White Baydoun</p>
<p>We do not subtract out the entire 11-point house effect from the polling firm’s results — the model allows polling firms to retain <em>some</em> of their house effect — but the model does adjust the poll substantially, treating it as about a 7-point lead for Mr. Romney rather than a 15-point one</p>
<p> Aggregators <a href="http://polltracker.talkingpointsmemo.com/contests/states/OH">TPM</a> and <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/oh/ohio_romney_vs_obama-1860.html">Real Clear Politics</a> who (very very defensibly) use simpler easier to understand approaches have Ohio shifting from a small Obama lead to a tiny Obama lead.   Two of the 6 polls in the RCP average are from members of my list of suspect pollsters,, there is also a purple strategies poll) and one is from Rasmussen.  So I suspect that the average is half bogus.  IIRC the Gravis poll caused enough of a shift to change the TPM rating from leans Obama to Toss up with dramatic effects on their automatic race summary (no link as it updates continuously). </p>
<p>This, I think, is the whole purpose of the brand new Gravis marketing political polling operation.</p>
<p>Update:  But  I don&#8217;t know this.  I don&#8217;t have enough data from Gravis Marketing to make any firm inference.  I can&#8217;t tell much about any single pollster.  My view is that there is a brand new pollster group effect which is significantly Republican.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t tell anything with confidence about any single brand new pollster (except that Foster McCollum White Baydoun sure doesn&#8217;t seem to be doing a very good job).</p>

                                <p>A post like this really shouldn&#8217;t be necessary, but part of the right wing canard that <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/09/a-quick-look-at-federal-spending.html">Obama has been a profligate spender</a> is based on spending as a percentage of GDP.</p>
<p>It looks like this &#8211; Graph 1.</p>
<p>
<div><a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fredgraph.png?g=ajA"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fredgraph.png?g=ajA" width="400"></a></div>
<div>Graph 1.  Fed Expenditures/GDP</div>
<p>Sure  enough, by the end of Clinton&#8217;s term the ratio had fallen from Reagan&#8217;s  high of 24% to a modern low of 19%.  But note that the 19% value wasn&#8217;t  typical.  It was the end point of a decade-long decline.  And, yep,  there&#8217;s Obama with an all-time-high approaching 26%.</p>
<p>What  otherwise intelligent, and sometimes even famous people seem to ignore  though, is that every ratio has not only a numerator but also that <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/08/debt-recession-and-that-ol-devil.html">ol&#8217; devil denominator</a>.    Let&#8217;s have a look at both of them.  Graph 2 shows GDP and Expenditures  since 1980, expressed in $ Billions.  I&#8217;ve also added a line  representing 5* Expenditures, since 20% of GDP is a reasonable rough  estimate for the post WW II era.</p>
<p>
<div><a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fredgraph.png?g=ak0"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fredgraph.png?g=ak0" width="400"></a></div>
<div>Graph 2.  Expenditures and GDP Compared</div>
<p>Actually,  the 5x Expenditures line runs pretty consistently above the GDP line,  telling us two things that we should have already known from looking at  Graph 1.  First, Expenditures greater than 20% of GDP have been the norm  since before 1980, and 2) Clinton&#8217;s final number is not representative  of anything other than a single year.  Using it as a comparator is  cherry-picking and fundamentally dishonest.</p>
<p>The 5x line  also emphasizes that the majority of the spending increase under Obama  unavoidably occurred during the officially designated recession.  The  GDP line shows that, post recession, GDP growth has not recovered to the  pre-recession trend line.  In fact, growth has established a new trend  line with a lower slope.  This is unprecedented in the scope of FRED  historical data.  My guess is that insufficient Federal spending has  been a big drag on this recovery.  But it&#8217;s also true that GDP growth  has been in secular decline since the Reagan administration.  Note that skewing the denominator down will automatically skew the ratio up.  This is what Bill Clinton calls &#8220;arithmetic.&#8221;</p>
<p>Slicing  across this a different way, Graph 3 gives us year-over-year percentage  growth in Expenditures and GDP, dating back to the Eisenhower  administration.</p>
<p>
<div><a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fredgraph.png?g=akg"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fredgraph.png?g=akg" width="400"></a></div>
<div>Graph 3.  YoY % Change in Expenditures and GDP</div>
<p>A few simple observations:<br />&#8211; The spending increase during the recent recession was modest by any standard, and dwarfed by earlier surges.<br />&#8211; That increase, coupled with the most severe GDP decline since the <i>other</i> Great Depression gave our beloved ratio a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad double whammy.<br />&#8211; GDP growth during this recovery is only marginally better than it was during the 2001-2 low, and far below Clinton era levels.<br />&#8211; Clinton was the most consistently frugal president of the post WW II era &#8211; until now.<br />&#8211; Since the recession was declared over, B. Hoover Obama has been <i>miserly</i>.</p>
<p>One  can legitimately argue that Obama&#8217;s approach to the economy has been  excessively conservative.  Krugman has made this point repeatedly.  I  often say that Clinton governed to the right of Eisenhower &#8211; who was a  genuine deficit hawk &#8211; and that Obama is to the right of Clinton. That  is intended to be slightly hyperbolic, but using this data as the  benchmark, it&#8217;s dead on.</p>
<p>Any questions?</p>
