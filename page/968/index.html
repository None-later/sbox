                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Suppose your goal is to lose some weight.  No, I’m not saying you’re overweight; you look marvelous!  But use your imagination.</p>
<p>To lose weight, you might reduce your calorie intake, or increase your activity, or most likely some combination of both.  Your first step would probably be to weigh yourself.  Why?  Because you want to measure your progress, and weighing yourself on a regular basis provides feedback on the effectiveness of your weight loss program.</p>
<p>This is an example of choosing the proper metric to help achieve the desired goal.  </p>
<p>Now suppose you are the President of the United States and you are serious about reducing the budget deficit.  What do you do?  You need to cut spending, increase revenue, or some combination of both.  After you set your goal, say cutting the budget deficit in half over a certain period, then you have to pick the proper budget metric to measure your progress.</p>
<p>Is the Unified Budget deficit the proper measure?  The short answer is no.</p>
<p>First, what is the Unified Budget?   The Unified Budget is “a measure in which every function and activity of government [is] added together to assess the government&#8217;s fiscal position.”  (Definition from SSA: <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/history/BudgetTreatment.html">Budget Treatment</a>) </p>
<p>The Unified Budget deficit provides a good estimate of the amount of borrowing required from “individuals, corporations, state or local governments, foreign governments, and other entities outside of the United States Government” to fund the US Government.  (See Treasury for descriptions of <a href="http://www.publicdebt.treas.gov/opd/opdfaq.htm#opdfaq32">Debt Held by the Public</a> and <a href="http://www.publicdebt.treas.gov/opd/opdfaq.htm#opdfaq33">Intragovernmental Holdings</a>).  Economists use the Unified Budget deficit to estimate the “crowding out” impact of government borrowing.  Crowding out occurs when government borrowing leads to higher interest rates and induces a reduction in private sector investment expenditures.</p>
<p>But remember our goal: to reduce the budget deficit.  And the Unified Budget is a flawed tool to measure the effectiveness of the President in achieving this goal.  </p>
<p>Let’s reconsider your weight loss program.  On the first day of your program, before you weigh yourself, you put on all of your clothes.  On each succeeding day, you put on one pound less of clothes before your weigh-in.   If you are a real clotheshorse, this charade can continue for some time and obviously renders the metric useless for measuring your progress; you’ve only cheated yourself.  To be a useful measurement tool, at your regular weigh-in you should wear a similar amount of clothes, and probably weigh yourself at the same time.</p>
<p>The Unified Budget has a similar problem as the cheating clotheshorse above; in this case, it&#8217;s the impact of the Social Security Trust Fund.  But what about the other trust funds?  There are over 150 Trust Funds in the US Government budget. Most of these funds, like the Highway Trust Fund, Black Lung Disability Trust Fund, Civil Service Retirement, Military Retirement, etc., are credited with a stable or steadily increasing amount of assets.  So it doesn’t really matter if we include these funds in a measurement tool to evaluate the effectiveness of the President to achieve his goal.</p>
<p>When we weigh ourselves, we are interested in our relative weight, day to day.  So it doesn’t matter if we weigh ourselves fully clothed or naked, as long as we are consistent.  The same is true with most of these trust funds.  If we include them, we are fully dressed.  If we exclude the trust funds, we are naked.  It doesn’t matter as long as we are consistent.</p>
<p>But it does matter for Social Security since the SS trust fund behaves differently from the other funds.  The SS Trust Fund was specifically designed by Alan Greenspan and the Greenspan Commission to run ever increasing annual surpluses until the Baby Boomers start to retire.  Then the annual surpluses will start to decrease, and eventually the trust fund will start running annual deficits.  Since we know this behavior in advance, and this is a separate program outside the year to year purview of the President, we can exclude the SS Trust Fund from the metric used to evaluate the performance of the President in achieving his goal.</p>
<p>The good news is the Greenspan Commission recognized this issue.  As part of the 1983 law signed by President Reagan, the Government was required to report the General Fund deficit, not the Unified Budget Deficit, starting in 1993.  Originally the General Fund excluded the Social Security and Medicare Trust Funds, and the operation of the Post Office.  Medicare was subsequently moved back on-budget (another issue for another day).  The amounts for the Post Office are negligible.</p>
<p>So the best metric available today to measure the President’s progress in reducing the budget deficit is the General Fund deficit.  Not only is the General Fund the proper measurement tool to evaluate the performance of the President on deficit reduction, reporting the General Fund deficit is also the law!  </p>
<p>Unfortunately Mr. Bush has made no progress, and the General Fund deficit will be close to $600 Billion again in fiscal 2006.</p>
<p>As pgl <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/06/budget-deficit-forecasts-and-cold.html">noted</a>, some administration apologists are trying to mislead the American public by using the Unified Budget deficit.  I suppose, when these people try to lose weight, they bundle up the first day and weigh themselves – and then weigh themselves naked the following day – and declare victory.  </p>
<p>Like the cheating clotheshorse, these apologists are only cheating themselves and misleading their readers.  In reality, Bush has made no progress on the budget deficit.</p>
<p>UPDATE: Reader Steve points out that the most recent MTS data shows a small improvement in the General Fund deficit, whereas the annual increase in the National Debt shows no progress.  So the last sentence should read &#8220;Bush has made little or no progress on the budget deficit&#8221;.</p>

                                <p>The <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=ZTVmMDgzOGU5NWViZjdjNTIwMmNhMDhlYjM4MzEwNDk=">National Review</a> never ceases to disappoint:<br />
<blockquote>The country was facing the largest projected deficit in history when Bush promised to halve it as a percentage of GDP by 2009. Due to high wartime spending and the residual effects of the 2000–01 recession, the White House expected the 2004 deficit to reach $521 billion, or 4.5 percent of GDP. Bush’s goal was to reduce this to 2.25 percent by 2009. After all the beans were finally counted, the 2004 deficit came in at $413 billion—roughly 3.5 percent of GDP. The economy had begun expanding, partly in response to Bush’s tax cuts, creating jobs and boosting revenue. This trend continued into the next year, pushing the deficit down to $319 billion in 2005. This year, the projections look even better.</p></blockquote>
<p>I admit to being an odd bear as I don’t like hot weather and yet I live in Los Angeles.  It was so hot yesterday that I quipped the highs today will top 100 degrees.  I’m happy to report that the temperatures are in the 80’s.  But no – I’m not wearing a sweater.  </p>
<p>The National Review is talking about the unified deficit not the much larger General Fund deficit and maybe they did not get the memo – but that 4.5% forecast was seen as bogus at the time.  Table B-79 of the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/cea/erp06.pdf">2006 Economic Report of the President</a> shows that the unified deficit was 3.6% of GDP in 2004 – which was higher than any level observed since 1993.  Contrast that to the unified surplus equal to 2.4% of GDP observed in 2000. </p>
<p>We should also note that the forecast for 2006 is for the deficit to hit 3.2% of GDP.  Of course, this is also a bogus forecast which we will likely beat.  It is true that economic growth over the past couple of years has been better than the pathetic growth rates observed during 2001 and 2002, but then recessions come and go even without tax cuts.</p>
<p><em><strong>Update</strong></em>: Thanks to AB reader Howard for noting that the National Review thinks that the recession began in 2000.  The <a href="http://www.nber.org/cycles.html">NBER</a> begs to differ.</p>

<blockquote>&#8220;The entire country may disagree with me, but I don&#8217;t understand the necessity for patriotism,&#8221; Maines resumes, through gritted teeth. &#8220;Why do you have to be a patriot? About what? This land is our land? Why? You can like where you live and like your life, but as for loving the whole country… I don&#8217;t see why people care about patriotism.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Would it have been too hard to note what <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2006/06/15/bmdixie15.xml">the discussion</a> was about:<br />
<blockquote>The Chicks can&#8217;t hide their disgust at the lack of support they received from other country performers. &#8220;A lot of artists cashed in on being against what we said or what we stood for because that was promoting their career, which was a horrible thing to do,&#8221; says Robison. &#8220;A lot of pandering started going on, and you&#8217;d see soldiers and the American flag in every video. It became a sickening display of ultra-patriotism.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Even serial liar <a href="http://michellemalkin.com/archives/005399.htm">Michelle Malkin</a> bothered to include with this paragraph before she launched into her standard dishonest attack mode.  </p>
<p>Cherry picking quotes so as to distort what people have said seems to be the only talent the folks over at the National Review have these days.</p>

<blockquote>&#8220;I think ultimately, of course, there are going to be pardons,&#8221; said Joseph diGenova, a former prosecutor and an old Washington hand who shares that view with many pundits. &#8220;These are the kinds of cases in which historically presidents have given pardons,&#8221; said the veteran Republican attorney.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>He [Patrick Fitzgerald] has been investigating a very simple factual scenario</p></blockquote>
<p>It IS simple – the Office of the Vice President wanted to attack Joseph Wilson by telling the world his wife was a CIA agent.  And this does not bother Victoria Toensing?</p>

                                <p>CNN has been running Dead Wrong over and over &#8211; in fact, twice today.  OK, we get it – the White House lied repeatedly in 2002 and early 2003 in order to make their partisan case for war.  Notice <a href="http://archives.cnn.com/2002/ALLPOLITICS/09/08/iraq.debate">this CNN story</a> from September 8, 2002</p>
<blockquote><p>The tubes, Rice said, “are only really suited for nuclear weapons programs, centrifuge programs.”</p></blockquote>
<p>As Dead Wrong notes, the Administration knew at the time that our intelligence community was saying the tubes were most likely for some other purpose and were not the right types for “nuclear weapons programs, centrifuge programs”.  I’d be stating the obvious if I noted that Dr. Rice lies – a lot.  Incidentally, we hear Dick Cheney telling lots of lies on this show.  But then that’s his speciality.  </p>
<p>Of course, this CNN story back then in no way questioned Dr. Rice’s statement.  So thanks to CNN for repeating over and over AFTER we invaded Iraq &#8211; how your new organization did not do your job as the press when it might have mattered.</p>

We also received some rather dumb comments from Patrick R. Sullivan aka Patrick Roland whose <a href="http://flyunderthebridge.blogspot.com/2005/07/psst-ive-got-bridge-in-france-id-like.html">blog</a> did provide a nice picture of the Millau Viaduct (which has nothing to do with the point Max raised) as it blocks comments from anyone other than his rightwing team (which appears to have no members).  Patrick did question Max’s claim that the sale of the toll rights to private firms is dissaving – to which  we’ll spend a little time at the end explaining some basics to Patrick.  But let’s first turn to Patrick’s comment that this is nothing but a business deal  &#8211; which misses the point of whether the deal was a fair deal or some giveaway from the state to a private sector – by thanking Don <a href="http://signsofchaos.blogspot.com/2006/06/more-on-toll-road.html">Don Coffin</a> for his comments.</p>
<p><a href="http://signsofchaos.blogspot.com/2006/04/indiana-toll-road-once-again.html">Don</a> draws our attention to an earlier discussion from <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2138950/?nav=fo">Daniel Gross</a>: <br />
<blockquote>What&#8217;s in it for the foreign companies? Huge potential profits. Gigantic, steady profits. Toll roads are an incredible asset class. They&#8217;re often monopolies. They can support debt, since they provide a recurring guaranteed revenue stream that is likely to rise over time, as more people take to the roads and tolls increase. According to Cintra, the Indiana Toll Road generated $96 million in revenues in 2005, and Cintra expects a 12.5 percent internal rate of return on its investment. The heavy lifting has already been done: The state or federal governments have acquired the land and rights of way, built the roads and maintained them for years, and enacted toll increases. All the private companies have to do is deliver cash upfront, maintain the roads, and collect the windfall … What&#8217;s in it for the foreign companies? Huge potential profits.

The Japanese famously overpaid for Rockefeller Center, after all. It&#8217;s possible that Indiana just ripped off the Spaniards and Aussies. But I doubt it. </p></blockquote>
<p>Don is saying that only $90 million per year in revenues are being generated by tolls and that the private entity will incur $60 million per year in expenses with cash flows being a mere $30 million this year.  I’ll accept his premise that nominal cash flows will increase at only 2%, which reflects the expected inflation rate but note something Movie Guy hinted at when he asked us to focus on the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/09/AR2006060901775.html">Washington Post</a> discussion:<br />
<blockquote>In response, the administration persuaded Congress last summer to take steps to make it easier for the private sector to finance new roads &#8211; and take over existing ones. Lawmakers removed several legal barriers to charging tolls on interstates and gave private investors new access to tax-free bonds for transportation projects.</p></blockquote>
<p>Don even noted the possibility of toll increases in his <a href="http://signsofchaos.blogspot.com/2006/01/privatizing-indiana-toll-road.html">first post</a> with a hat tip to <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2006/01/privatization_o.html">Mark Thoma</a> (more on Mark’s January 25, 2006 at the end).  In other words, expected cash flows might be significantly more than Don’s $30 million per year guess.  The value of the deal depends also on the discount rate and Cintra’s claim that it expects a 12.5% internal rate of return is rather staggering.  But note this <a href="http://www.tollroadsnews.com/cgi-bin/a.cgi/qkcOBoxLEdqcEIJ61nsxIA">article</a> that Don provides:<br />
<blockquote>Allen said the estimated internal rate of return will be between 12.5% to 13.5% a year, providing a risk premium of between 8% to 9% per annum over US 10 year bond yield.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, Macquarie Infrastructure Group (Cintra’s partner in this and other ventures of this sort) is arguing that they receive a 4.5% nominal risk free rate (2.5% real risk free rate if expected inflation is 25%) plus a staggering 8% premium.  Gross, however, is suggesting that these firms face little systematic risk, which I’ll take to suggest that the appropriate discount rate for constant dollar cash flows should be 3.5% versus the Cintra-Macquarie projection of a 10.5% real internal rate of return.</p>
<p>But here is the puzzle.  If the discount rate is 3.5% in real terms and we are expecting constant real cash flows over 75 years, the value to cash flow multiplier is only 2.55, which implies that cash flows would have to be $150 million per year.  Don’s question as to the elasticity of demand for deriving on toll roads and how much will Cintra &#038; Macquarie have to incur in expenditures begs the question as to whether we would reasonably expect more than $150 million per year in cash flows.  If we assume as Cintra &#038; Macquarie do that the real internal rate of return is as high as 10.5%, then cash flows would have to be $440 million per year.  Now if Cintra &#038; Macquarie are correct, which would imply that cash flows will be this high and if we use a 3.5% real discount rate, the value of this deal jumps to almost $12.7 billion, which means the state is selling this deal at a 70% discount rate.  <br />So who is right?  Don Coffin is worried that Cintra &#038; Macquarie is guilty of the Andrew Fastow finance that wrecked Enron (see <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-59689876862079048">Brad DeLong</a> discuss Enron as his drinks from his large cup of coffee). </p>
<p>Gross shares the same concern that Max and I do – that in some ways, Mitch Daniels is doing for the state of Indiana what he did as OMB director for Federal finances.  Gross provided the state’s <a href="http://www.in.gov/gov/issues/MM_Fact_Sheets.pdf">Fact Sheet</a>, which has a very familiar ring:<br />
<blockquote>Indiana faces a $2.8 billion dollar shortfall in its transportation budget over the next ten years. Continuing the status quo would result in only half of Indiana’s critical transportation construction projects being built.</p></blockquote>
<p>Notice the fact that Governor Daniels has a 10-year focus when the deal is a 75-year deal.  Did I say Enron financing?  If Daniel Gross is correct, then Daniels is reducing long-term revenues by more than the $3.8 billion collects.  But even if this is a fair deal – something Roland Patrick suggests with no backup but Don Coffin has thought more seriously about – notice that the starve the beast theorists that permeate rightwing thinking should be worried that state governments have found a way around balanced budget restrictions.  So Max’s dissaving claim may have two distinct but complementary elements: (1) Gross’s bad deal claim; and (2) the Governor’s own words that he’ll spend these inflows of cash.  Actually, this kind of creative financing is what is wrong with the simpleminded starve the beast theorists who thought the 2001 and 2003 Federal tax cuts would reduce Federal spending.  It did not precisely because Bush’s first OMB director was so willing to engage in Enron financing games. </p>
<p>But let’s get back to Mark Thoma’s point.  Even if the Indiana Toll Road deal is not as bad as Gross claims and even if Governor Daniels will not use the funds to go on a spending spree, we are talking about increasing state revenues by a deal that will increase the cost of driving for the average Joe.  For more on this issue – see <a href="http://quote.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000039&#038;refer=columnist_mysak&#038;sid=a8V3debK0BYs#">Joe Mysak</a>. </p>
<p>Many thanks to Don Coffin and I would hope the Indiana legislature withhold passage of this proposal until they give very good economics such as yourself a chance to review its terms more closely.</p>
<p><strong>Footnote</strong>: Alas, we have some troll from the Minnesota GOP hack machine who does not have a clue what the issue is.  This troll says the State of Indiana had to go with this type of financing because of “scarcity of resources”.  Never mind financing decisions and scarcity of resources are two very different things, it seems Mitch Daniels does not think the State of Indiana has a scarcity of labor resources as he is trying to justify more construction on the grounds of jobs, jobs, jobs.  Checking the Bureau of Labor Statistics, it seems the state unemployment rate is 5%.  So if Patrick Sullivan wishes to disagree on this scarcity of resources issue, it strikes me that BLS data is on the Governor’s side on this one.  Now the Governor and Mr. Sullivan might worry about a scarcity of current tax revenues but borrowing can relax a financing constraint.  After all – construction is often put on the state’s capital account, not its current account.  And as Max Sawicky points out, having a capital account is no excuse for bad financing decisions and not paying attention to long-run budget constraints.  But now we have gone beyond the comprehension of the former OMB director and that GOP hack from Minnesota.</p>
<p>But the troll did provide us a link to an analysis from <a href="http://www.in.gov/ifa/TollRoadFinancialAnalysis.pdf">Crowe Chisek &#038; Company</a>.  Page 16 suggests the present value of toll revenues is $5.3 billion.  Now if Don Coffin can figure out what portion of the expenses will be borne by the state and what portion will be borne by the private entities &#8230;</p>

                                <p>Earlier I noted how <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/06/renaming-laffer-curve.html">Alan Reynolds</a> was whining about “what some nameless supply-siders like to claim”.  While we can name the free lunch supply-side crowd (Kudlow, Laffer) <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=Y2Y0ZDk0NzA5ZmI1OTI0YWEyN2RmMjc0NjY2MjYwMzI=">Jonah Goldberg</a> has forgotten who he misquoted:<br />
<blockquote>For a couple of years now Democrats have increasingly demanded that America get out of Iraq now, soon or by a date certain. The Murtha bug-out chorus says “it’s not our fight,” “let the Iraqis handle it,” “let’s stay out of a civil war,” and, “we can’t win.” I think I have that right.</p></blockquote>
<p>No Jonah – you left out the word <a href="http://yglesias.tpmcafe.com/node/30673">militarily</a> as we also <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/06/celebrating-demise-of-zarqawi-by.html">noted</a>. The entire point of the <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/06/16/us.iraq.ap/index.html">House vote</a> yesterday was to bash Democrats using the type of dishonesty that the National Review is well known for.  Of course, Mr. Goldberg either has no ability to remember what he wrote 8 days ago or no courage to face those he falsely accuses.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://www.firedoglake.com/2006/06/16/beggers-and-thieves">Jane Hamsher</a> might not be an economist but she has just provided the best explanation for why Goldberg, Byron York, Rich Lowry, et al. lie so much:<br />
<blockquote>Remember that the next time they want to lecture you on their &#8220;fiscal conservatism.&#8221;  They’re privileged, white upper middle-class twits who want the right to shovel shit nobody wants to read and then be paid for it quite handsomely. They’re unwilling to compete in the free market. Always asking for a handout, expecting someone to take care of them. The NRO quite proudly represents the party with their hands on the purse strings.  No wonder the country is swimming in red ink.</p></blockquote>
<p>I am truly humbled as I am an economist.  I’ve been trying to say the same thing for so long – so why do I have to wait for Jane to say it so clearly.  Well done!</p>
<p><strong>Update II</strong>: Given the propensity of my fellow liberal bloggers to do Friday cat blogging and the fact that I own dogs, I’ll turn it over the <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=ZGQ2NTRlYjRmMDVkMWE1NTkzY2RmYmE1YTc3YmY4NTE=">Cosmo</a> of the National Review to provide us with <a href="http://hitlercats.motime.com/">Hitler Cat</a> blogging.

Mark provides some nice graphs with the point being:<br />
<blockquote>Krugman is saying this is not how the Fed operates in the short-run. Instead, the Fed moves to stabilize output at Y* so that the LM curve shifts back, not out, and output remains at Y*. In this case, crowding out is 100%</p></blockquote>
<p>William Poole would be impressed that folks remember his 1970 point in <a href="http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0033-5533(197005)84%3A2%3C197%3AOCOMPI%3E2.0.CO%3B2-B">Optimal Choice of Monetary Policy Instruments in a Simple Stochastic Macro Model </a>.  Of course – once realizes the point that Poole was making – the case of Bush’s tax cuts as somehow being pro-growth disappears.  Simply put – less national savings means less investment.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.washtimes.com/commentary/areynolds.htm">Alan Reynolds</a> suggests:<br />
<blockquote>Aside from that odd remark about what some nameless supply-siders like to claim, Mr. Mankiw simply restated what real supply-siders did claim. He emphasized that higher (marginal) tax rates reduce work effort and cause other inefficient distortions. He added that higher tax rates also reduce the tax base: People respond to higher tax rates by taking it easy or figuring out ways to report less taxable income. This used to be called “the Laffer Curve” but now goes by the more respectable name of “taxable income elasticity.”</p></blockquote>
<p>I’d be fine with this suggestion – just so we are talking about fiscally neutral changes in fiscal policy.  I trust Mr. Reynolds also realizes what Greg Mankiw and I tend to agree on – there is indeed a crowding-out effect when certain politicians (say Ronald Reagan or George W. Bush) try to promise a free lunch where one can cut taxes without cutting government spending.  Mr. Reynolds continues with something that is simply not true:<br />
<blockquote>No economist ever claimed all taxes are so distortionary that increasing any tax rate would reduce revenue. Art Laffer never said that. Bob Mundell never said that. Larry Lindsey, Larry Kudlow, Paul Craig Roberts, Steve Entin and Bruce Bartlett never said that. I never said that.</p></blockquote>
<p>Maybe Mundell, Bartlett, or Reyonlds never said there was a free lunch.  I don’t know Steven Entin but I do know Lawrence Kudlow and Art Laffer have often implied a free lunch.  Reynolds may grow weary of people accusing him of practicing free lunch economics, but I grow weary of the Lafferites one day saying there is a free lunch and then the next day denying what they just said.</p>

                                <p>Is <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=MWUwZjZmNDVlNDg4ZGIxZDc4YTUzMjRmY2M5NzBkMjA">John Tamny</a> trying to discourage me from purchasing a copy of <a href="http://www.greenwood.com/books/printFlyer.aspx?sku=C2023">The Financial Analysts Guide to Monetary Policy</a> by Victor A. Canto, Charles W. Kadlec, and Arthur B. Laffer?  Well he has succeeded by blaming the following confusion on the authors:<br />
<blockquote>Is there a Laffer curve component to all this? Writing in the early 1980s, economists Arthur Laffer, Charles Kadlec, and Victor Canto alluded to such a possibility, noting that rate hikes “represent an increase in the effective tax rate on the activity levels of Federal Reserve member banks.” Rate increases back then “undermined the utility of the dollar as an intermediary currency,” meaning rate hikes “diminished demand for dollars,” which was itself inflationary.  Though yields on 3-month Treasury bills reached 16 percent in 1981, the rate of inflation rose substantially.</p></blockquote>
<p>For some reason – the National Review is opposing the recent tight monetary policy from the Federal Reserve on the fear that higher interest rates will actually increase inflation.  Now I’m hoping the Federal Reserve loosens its monetary policy as I fear it might lead to another recession – albeit I can understand the FED’s concern that fiscal stimulus is still out of control.   Yes, Laffer would tell you that tax cuts, which leads to less savings if people consume more, don’t crowd out investment, but he’s wrong.  </p>
<p>Let’s try to follow Tamny’s “logic”.  An inward shift of the money supply curve raises the price of credit (the interest rate) which lowers the quantity demand for money.  Now if one was drunk during the first lecture in Economics 101, one might have imagined that the money demand curve shifted inward.  And an inward shift of the money demand curve would increase aggregate demand etc.  But once one sobered up and re-read the textbook – one would realize how utterly stupid Tamny’s thesis really is.  Now if Canto, Kadlec, and Laffer are actually including the insane musings of a drunken fool in a Guide to Monetary Policy, I’m not wasting my time or money on it.  </p>
<p>Incidentally, the tight monetary policy during the early 1980&#8217;s did lower inflation despite the fiscal stimulus from the 1981 tax cut &#8211; which did lead to crowding-out of investment and slower long-term growth.  Something else a drunk might never realize as listens to Laffer&#8217;s BS and thinks it&#8217;s real economics.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Mr. Tamny’s most recent comment (1:30 PM) now says money demand rose whereas his op-ed talked about a decrease in money demand.  Before that – he notes that tight monetary policy does not lower inflation as it does not lead to dollar appreciation.  Let me assure Mr. Tamny that the tight monetary policies of the early 1980’s lead to a substantial appreciation of the dollar.  I’m sorry but Mr. Tamny is utterly confused as to the facts as well as what he wrote.</p>
<p><strong>Update II</strong>: Many thanks to David Altig for reminding us of the <a href="http://econ.ucsd.edu/papers/files/2000-08.pdf">Wright Patman effect</a>.  The particular paper that I’ve linked to has as part of its summary:<br />
<blockquote>This paper has presented an empirical test that provides evidence to support the contention that monetary policy has supply-side effects on real variables. The evidence given here shows that in key manufacturing industries, prices rise and output falls following an unanticipated monetary contraction, even after controlling for both the price puzzle and the cost effects of oil shocks. Further, the results call into question whether a price puzzle even exists. We find that the evidence for cost channel effects is much stronger during the period from 1959 to 1979 than from 1983 to 1996. </p></blockquote>
