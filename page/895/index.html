                                <p><a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2007/02/income_inequali.html">Mark Thoma</a> is providing us with thorough coverage of the good, the bad, and the ugly on this debate on whether income inequality is increasing.  I cannot do justice to all of what Mark links to, but I have a reason to focus on what <a href="http://www.cato-unbound.org/2007/02/16/dirk-krueger-fabrizio-perri/inequality-in-what">Dirk Krueger and Fabrizio Perri</a> said:<br />
<blockquote>Measuring inequality in lifetime consumption and leisure is an impossible task as it would require data on consumption for many households, each followed for a very long period of time. Such data unfortunately do not exist. What is then a feasible and appropriate way of measuring inequality in lifetime consumption? If people would earn constant income throughout their lives, current income would be a very good approximation of lifetime consumption. In the data, though, current income fluctuates substantially over the life cycle and thus it is a potentially poor indicator of lifetime resources. Fortunately, we can use simple theories of consumption decisions of households over time (pioneered by Nobel prize winners Milton Friedman and Franco Modigliani), which show that if households can borrow and lend on financial markets, then there is a strong link between the lifetime resources of a household (sometimes also called its permanent income) and its current consumption. Current income shocks that are not fully permanent (such as seasonal shocks, job losses, bonus payments) strongly affect current income (and thus have a strong impact on the distribution of current income), but only have a moderate impact on permanent income and thus consumption.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, I realize that measured consumption inequality has not increased as much as measured income inequality.  And I’m sort of <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/08/does-income-inequality-lead-to.html">on record</a> for suggesting lifetime income inequality has indeed increased.  AB readers will note that I did discuss a research paper by Dirk Krueger and Fabrizio Perri as well as a related paper by Matteo Iacoviello.  AB readers might also recall that that I often appeal to the logic of this Ando-Modigliani model.  So how do I reconcile my respect for this Ando-Modigliani model and my view that income inequality has indeed increased. First of all, Dirk Krueger and Fabrizio Perri note several caveats about using their proxy for lifetime income inequality.  Secondly, consider what I wrote way back then:<br />
<blockquote>Iacoviello’s model predicts that consumption inequality grows less than proportionally as income inequality grows, while wealth inequality grows more than proportionally. Examining the distribution of current consumption misses the point that living standards should be gauged across individual’s lifetimes. While the very wealthy have ample resources for old age retirement, the evidence suggests that the working poor may not – unless we retain the Social Security Trust Fund as a vehicle to supplement their retirement benefits. Rightwingers like John Hood, however, are advocating that the government substantially reduce Social Security benefits. Go figure.</p></blockquote>
<p>Simply put – the rise in wealth inequality over time is a statistic that is not consistent with this lifecycle model explanation of why income inequality has grown by much more than consumption inequality has grown.</p>

                                <p>It seems that any debate about the war in Iraq is treason in some quarters.  Via Steve Benen, a look at how <a href="http://www.thecarpetbaggerreport.com/archives/9985.html">Republicans looked at other wars</a>. </p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;What’s more, this phenomenon isn’t limited to 1995 and Bosnia.</p>
<p>When Republicans didn’t like the conflict in Somalia in 1993, the congressional GOP decided Congress had all kinds of authority to intervene, whether the president liked it or not. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), for example, on Oct. 19, 1993, argued that Congress had the power to force Clinton to begin an “immediate, orderly withdrawal from Somalia.” He added, “[I]f we do not do that and other Americans die, other Americans are wounded, other Americans are captured because we stay too long — longer than necessary — then I would say that the responsibilities for that lie with the Congress of the United States who did not exercise their authority under the Constitution of the United States.”</p>
<p>Strom Thurmond (R-S.C.) said Congress should “force the administration to find a way out of the quagmire.” Dirk Kempthorne (R-Idaho) said it was up to the Senate “to get the American troops home.” Slade Gorton (R-Wash.) said, “It is time to retreat now…. It is time to leave and for this body, it is time to debate this issue.” Alan Simpson (R-Wyo.) said, “I cannot continue to support … the continuing endangerment of Americans in the service of a policy that remains absolutely mysterious and totally muddled.”&#8221;</p></blockquote>

                                <p>Today the LA Times has a story on a recent court ruling that </p>
<p>In a victory for the White House, a U.S. appeals court Tuesday threw out the legal claims brought on behalf of the hundreds of prisoners held at Guantanamo Bay and ruled that they did not have a right to plead their innocence in an American court.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/la-na-gitmo21feb21,1,4762504.story">threw out legal claims of prisoners held at Guantanamo Bay</a>. The story notes: </p>
<blockquote><p>In a 2-1 decision, the judges said the Constitution did not extend the right of habeas corpus to noncitizens held outside the sovereign territory of this country. &#8220;Cuba — not the United States — has sovereignty over Guantanamo Bay,&#8221; Judge A. Raymond Randolph wrote.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let us say this goes to the Supreme Court, and the Supreme Court rules the same way based on the same reasoning. (I understand its not an unreasonable assumption.) Here are is a question for our readers who are attorneys or otherwise have a good understanding of the law:</p>
<p>What happens when Cuba decides to exercise this sovereignty given to them by the US Courts? I understand Guantanamo has been a thorn in the Cuban side since Castro overthrew Batista. (i.e., since one SOB overthrew another SOB)</p>
<p>As a follow-up, if Scalia and Thomas and Alito and Roberts and one more of the, um, towering legal minds on the Court decide that Cuban sovereignty only applies when it benefits the administration, and not when the Cubans decide to exercise it, what happens to the American concept of property rights?</p>

<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>In a past posting, I presented some graphs that suggested to me that we have changed the way we make money. Our focus has changed from the Adam Smith focus on labor to a focus on capital. I think it is important that we understand this change in order to make better choices at the polls. Even the data analysis Cactus has been producing, suggesting there is a party selective results to our overall economy, there has been the signs of the switch to a focus on money. <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/02/spencers-comment-on-relative.html"> Spencer&#8217;s chart of Real Non-residential Fixed Investment </a> further supports that a change was made. The best performing curve in his chart is pre 1980&#8217;s. The mighty Clinton years don&#8217;t come close to the pre 1980&#8217;s.</p>
<p>One could argue that things are different with the move to globalization and thus, we should not expect such growth as pre 1980&#8217;s. I disagree. I would interpret our poor performance since the Reagan revolution not to competition but to poor policy/management in the response to the competition. At least in business that is how it would be interpreted. If you are with or behind the rise, then you are not being successful in growing the business.</p>
<p>The first chart is GDP vs Income types. This is a stacked chart. From the top line to the bottom they are: GDP, Profits after tax, Disposable Income, Personal Dividend, Personal Interest, Wages and Salaries. Again, the greatest acceleration is happening after 1981. Note, that income in the form of wages and salary is rising the least. We know that wages and productivity split in 1973. The extra income from the rise in productivity, based on this chart must be in the form of corporate profits, dividend and interest. </p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RdxGWoVHjwI/AAAAAAAAAEk/M_Un7nhj_gI/s1600-h/DolB1.JPG"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RdxGWoVHjwI/AAAAAAAAAEk/M_Un7nhj_gI/s320/DolB1.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>The next chart is Distribution of Profits. The lines from top to bottom are: Profits after taxes, Personal Dividends, Personal Interest, Wages and Salaries, Depreciation, Net Non-residential investment. In my first post, I noted there were 3 distinct changes in tax policy based on the graph. The first was the greater increase in depreciation starting after 1981. However, based on this chart, the profit is not solely from that. The next was Net dividends. It&#8217;s rise started in 1987. The third was a near vertical rise in non-distributed corporate profit. One thing is certain in this chart, the income is not going into wages or investment by the companies (at least not in this country). The money is staying in money.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RdxGRYVHjvI/AAAAAAAAAEc/3O9Wtob-1tk/s1600-h/DolB2.JPG"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RdxGRYVHjvI/AAAAAAAAAEc/3O9Wtob-1tk/s320/DolB2.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>The third chart compares disposable income (income everyone has left over) to income from assets. The top line is asset income the bottom is disposable income. This supports that a greater share of income is from money and not labor.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RdxGN4VHjuI/AAAAAAAAAEU/EqFCfBoLF8Q/s1600-h/DolB3.JPG"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RdxGN4VHjuI/AAAAAAAAAEU/EqFCfBoLF8Q/s320/DolB3.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>The fourth chart of distribution of asset income shows dividends rising faster again supporting that we are making money from money.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RdxGIYVHjtI/AAAAAAAAAEM/qOqJVuaBiRg/s1600-h/Dolb4.JPG"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RdxGIYVHjtI/AAAAAAAAAEM/qOqJVuaBiRg/s320/Dolb4.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>The final chart is Wages vs Industry type. The lines from top to bottom are: Service Industries, Distributive Industries, Goods producing Industries, Wages and Salaries. The first thing to notice is that wages and salaries do not rise as fast as any of the industries. It is probably the most important finding to note if we are concerned about the worker. This chart shows that there is no sector of employment that will allow the employee to benefit from the rising economy.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RdxGD4VHjsI/AAAAAAAAAEE/WTmB2WqHzbM/s1600-h/DolB5.JPG"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RdxGD4VHjsI/AAAAAAAAAEE/WTmB2WqHzbM/s320/DolB5.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>When we look at these charts, is it any wonder that our auto industry (as the most exemplary of goods producing) is in trouble? Is it any wonder that labor (those earning money using their bodies or their minds via employment or self employment) is struggling? Is it any wonder that the market keeps going up even though consumer spending is down? The money that is being earned by companies is not going out side the company. They are not investing within this country, they are not paying the help and they are paying less in taxes. What money they are distributing is going to those who own the company or who have loaned the company money.</p>
<p>Finally, if we look at just 2006s income and use the top 1%&#8217;s share from 1976 of 8.86% there would have been $816.47 billion more for the rest of us. Even at 1948&#8217;s % share, there would have been $556.37 more for the rest of us. Imagine how much more federal revenue that would have generated just in income taxes alone. Or how about the stimulus to the economy in consumer spending? Or how about the local taxes that could be paid because the worker could afford it. But, imagine how much better off we would be if the share of income had stayed at 8.86% for the past 30 years.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>

                                <p>Hoisted from comments, Brad deLong-style.  This is a comment Spencer posted both here and at <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2007_02/010773.php">Washington Monthly&#8217;s Political Animal</a>.  (I note the Political Animal post on Democrat v. Republican differences is worth checking out&#8230; they&#8217;ve got a chart up showing differences in job growth rates by administration going back to 1921).</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>Under democrats the economy does significantly better than under republicans. That is pretty solid. So why? I do not buy the argument that it is long and variable lags. Rather, I think the difference is in the impact of Keynesian policies as compared to supply side policies. Generally, democrats implement Keynesian type policies. This is based on the premise that you use deficits to give consumers extra income and they will go out and spend it. This generates strong corporate profits and strong markets that in turn lead to strong capital spending. Supply side policy, in contrast is based on the premise that you use deficits to give tax cuts to the wealthy, or the investor class, and they will investment their extra income and this will generate capital spending that pulls the economy up.</p>
<p>So both are based on the premise that using deficits to give different groups extra income will lead to greater capital spending and a stronger economy. If you look at the record of what happens to capital spending you see that democratic or Keynesian stimulus is followed by very strong capital spending so this thesis seems to work. In contrast, supply side tax cuts are followed by weak capital spending so at best the supply side argument is unproven.</p>
<p>So why the difference? Look at the source of nonresidential capital spending. Some 82% stems from the corporate side of the economy while only 11% is accounted for by S corporations, partnerships, households, etc.. that are subject to the individual income tax code. The remaining 7% is from nonprofit organizations.</p>
<p>Second look at why people or corporations invest. It is because they think they can make a profit by selling the output of the new capacity when it comes on stream not because they have money burning a hole in their pocket. this is clearly what Keynesian type policies assume about human nature why supply side policies assume they invest because they have investable fund. So which one seems more realistic?</p>
<p>Third, look at what has happened to savings. For a quarter of a century we have implemented supply side type policies on the premise that it would lead to greater savings and investments &#8212; in a closed economy they are suppose to be equal. But again, look at the record. The major tax incentives we have implemented to encourage savings has been accompanied by a collapse in personal savings. It has to be the one of the greatest examples of a policy that completely failed that anyone can ever find.</p>
<p>So it seems pretty clear to me that the reason the economy does better under Democrats than under Republicans is that Keynesian policies clearly work while their is little or no evidence that supply side type policies have worked.</p>

                                <p>Jonah Goldberg <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=ZTYwZmFiZGNhY2I0YzMwMDJmOWExYjZiMTc3ZmMyZjA=">links approvingly</a> to &#8220;a pretty powerful op-ed by <a href="http://www.nysun.com/article/48926">Alicia Colon</a> in the NY Sun&#8221; and then goes on to provide this quote:</p>
<blockquote><p>The total military dead in the Iraq war between 2003 and this month stands at about 3,133. This is tragic, as are all deaths due to war, and we are facing a cowardly enemy unlike any other in our past that hides behind innocent citizens. Each death is blazoned in the headlines of newspapers and Internet sites. What is never compared is the number of military deaths during the Clinton administration: 1,245 in 1993; 1,109 in 1994; 1,055 in 1995; 1,008 in 1996. That&#8217;s 4,417 deaths in peacetime but, of course, who&#8217;s counting?</p></blockquote>
<p>But Goldberg expresses some doubt about the numbers.  And when even Goldberg doubts the numbers intended to cast Clinton in a poor light, some serious spinning is going on.  Long time readers might remember I looked <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/09/military-deaths-and-competence.html">at military deaths</a>.  </p>
<p>The raw data is <a href="http://siadapp.dior.whs.mil/personnel/CASUALTY/Death_Rates1.pdf">here</a>.  You can look at the data and see the trends for yourself, or you can look at something that was pulled out of Alicia&#8217;s colon.</p>

                                <p>I want to continue the look at the difference in the performance of Democrats and Republicans when measured by <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/02/god-punishes-us-when-we-collectively_19.html">real (GDP less increase in national debt) per capita</a> and the effect of the Fed on these differences.  But, I have to do some cleaning and there are some preliminary steps along the way.  One is a look at Fed Independence.</p>
<p>Sadly, I didn’t have the time to clean the data I wanted for today’s post, so consider this one first in a set of posts…</p>
<p>The table below looks at nominal changes in the 3 month supply of M2 in November of a Presidential election year, in November of the year before the Presidential election year, and in November of the year after a Presidential election year.  It shows this change both when an incumbent is running and when an incumbent is not running.  Not surprisingly, when an incumbent is running, the growth rate in M2 tends to be higher than in years for which there is no election, and it also tends to be higher than when there is no incumbent running.</p>

<p>The table also breaks out the growth rate when the Presidential incumbent and the Fed chief come from the same party…  Again, not surprisingly, when the Fed chief and the incumbent are from the same party, there is a bigger increase in M2 than when the Fed chief and the incumbent are from different parties.</p>
<p>I would caution readers that the data is nominal and does not account for population change.  Its possible that the years in which incumbents of the same party as the Fed chief were running just happen to have, on average, higher inflation rates, necessitating greater increases in M2.  I hope to get around to modifying the data for that tomorrow.  Still, very preliminary results seem to indicate the Fed is not exactly unbiased.  Anyone surprised?  Anyone?</p>

                                <p>The subtitle of the latest from <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=NTUzNmNkMjZhZTAzMjI4NzQxYWNhZWQ3ZTU2Nzc4Mjg">KLo</a> reads:<br />
<blockquote>Harry Reid’s Saturday vote was the Presidents&#8217; Day Weekend insult to U.S. troops, not John McCain’s decision to campaign as planned.</p></blockquote>
<p>She continues with:<br />
<blockquote>When Majority Leader Harry Reid announced late Thursday that there would be a Saturday Senate session to yet again debate a cowardly nonbinding Iraq resolution, Arizona senator John McCain didn’t change his weekend campaign plans. Good for Senator McCain.</p></blockquote>
<p>Fellow Republican Senators Chuck Hagel and John Warner call the Iraq debacle the most important issue before us today but KLo applauds AWOL John McCain as she also decides to label Senator Reid a coward.  </p>
<p>Meantime, let’s give some credit to <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2007/02/19/rice-troops-appreciated">Condi Rice</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Over the weekend, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice addressed military personnel stationed in Baghdad. She told the troops that everyone &#8211; including critics of the administration’s Iraq policy &#8211; believes that “the sacrifice and the labor of our men and women here has been honorable.” She called the debate over escalation a sign of a “great democracy.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Her speech can be found <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2007/feb/80645.htm">here</a>.  </p>
<p>I wonder if KLo would have the courage to take on Condi Rice in a best two out of three.  Given the fact that the Secretary of State actually works out, perhaps <a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/kathryn-jean-lopez">Kathryn Jean Lopez</a> would be well advised not to. </p>
<p>But seriously folks – haven’t we had enough of this childish pretty trash talk?  Thanks to <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2007_02/010774.php">Kevin Drum</a> for this plea:<br />
<blockquote>The debasement of our national security discourse has reached staggering proportions. Just consider the half-witted nonsense we&#8217;re deluged with these days: Can you support the troops if you don&#8217;t support the war? (Yes. Don&#8217;t be a moron.) Should Hillary apologize for her war vote? (Seriously, who cares?) Will the surge work? (No.) Is Iran &#8220;meddling&#8221; in Iraq? (Of course they are. What did you expect?) &#8230; I&#8217;ve pretty much given up hope that there are any Republicans left who understand anything serious about the exercise of American power, but there&#8217;s at least a chance that one or more of the Democrats do. So let&#8217;s hear it. Let&#8217;s argue about something real for a change.</p></blockquote>
