<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2008/07/28/energy_efficiency/?source=newsletter">Suppose I paid you for every pound of pollution</a> you generated and punished you for every pound you reduced. You would probably spend most of your time trying to figure out how to generate more pollution. And suppose that if you generated enough pollution, I had to pay you to build a new plant, no matter what the cost, and no matter how much cheaper it might be to not pollute in the first place. <br />Well, that&#8217;s pretty much how we have run the U.S. electric grid for nearly a century. The more electricity a utility sells, the more money it makes. If it&#8217;s able to boost electricity demand enough, the utility is allowed to build a new power plant with a guaranteed profit. The only way a typical utility can lose money is if demand drops. So the last thing most utilities want to do is seriously push strategies that save energy, strategies that do not pollute in the first place.</p></blockquote>
<p>A new study, <a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/clientservice/ccsi/greenhousegas.asp">McKinsey</a> proposes some projections on how an energy plan could reduce CO2 emissions significantly.  It has some neat graphs which I could not transfer to here.  It proposes that change might not be as expensive as some proclaim.</p>

<p>I have noticed the term &#8220;open trade&#8221; being used by several notables on their blogs.  What does it mean?</p>
<p>There is a great reluctance to simply use the term trade, or trade agreement.  I assume this is because a shorthand worked better for publication.  How is this different from &#8220;free trade&#8221; or &#8220;fair trade&#8221;, and what is the purpose?</p>

                                <p>An interesting compilation of how disgusting Team McCain has become can be found <a href="http://my.barackobama.com/page/content/mccainslowroadexpress">here</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>These days John McCain doesn’t seem to stand for anything but negative attacks and false charges against Barack Obama.</p></blockquote>
<p>And there is this <a href="http://theboard.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/07/31/say-what-john-mccain-barack-obama-and-the-race-card">race card</a> nonsense:</p>
<blockquote><p>The presumptive Republican nominee has embarked on a bare-knuckled barrage of negative advertising aimed at belittling Mr. Obama. The most recent ad compares the presumptive Democratic nominee for president to Britney Spears and Paris Hilton — suggesting to voters that he’s nothing more than a bubble-headed, publicity-seeking celebrity. The ad gave us an uneasy feeling that the McCain campaign was starting up the same sort of racially tinged attack on Mr. Obama that Republican operatives, some of whom work for Mr. McCain now, ran against Harold Ford, a black candidate for Senate in Tennessee in 2006. That assault, too, began with videos juxtaposing Mr. Ford with young, white women.  Mr. Obama called Mr. McCain on the ploy, saying, quite rightly, that the Republicans are trying to scare voters by pointing out that he “doesn’t look like all those other Presidents on those dollar bills.’’  But Rick Davis, Mr. McCain’s campaign manager, had a snappy answer. “Barack Obama has played the race card, and he played it from the bottom of the deck,” he said. “It’s divisive, negative, shameful and wrong.’’  The retort was, we must say, not only contemptible, but shrewd. It puts the sin for the racial attack not on those who made it, but on the victim of the attack.  It also — and we wish this were coincidence, but we doubt it — conjurs up another loaded racial image. The phrase dealing the race card “from the bottom of the deck” entered the national lexicon during the O.J. Simpson saga. Robert Shapiro, one of Mr. Simpson’s lawyers, famously declared of himself, Johnny Cochran and the rest of the Simpson defense team, “Not only did we play the race card, we dealt it from the bottom of the deck.” It’s ugly stuff. How about we leave Britney, Paris, and O.J. out of this — and have a presidential campaign?</p></blockquote>
<p>But, but, but – if Team McCain runs on the issues, they’ll lose.  They know it so they have to take this one to the gutter.</p>

<p>Whittle a Beak:  Return to Reagan Era Warfare Waste</p>
<p>A cronie still in the acquisition business related that the DoD has gone back to using fixed price development contracts.</p>
<p>In 1991, the Congress passed a law requiring DoD to use cost plus development contracts with its warfare welfare partners.  This was required because during the Reagan warfare state raid on the treasury DoD would contract for weapon system development using fixed price contracts.  An aberration occured in the fairly big Navy A-12 fighter program where a fixed price development by Mc Donald Douglass (now a subidiary of Beoing) was terminated for convenience when a defense department civilian  blew the whistle before the Navy could write a new contract to redo the profitable but shoddy work.</p>
<p>Here is a <a href="http://www.fcw.com/print/12_38/news/96457-1.html%20%3Cbr%20/%3E">link</a> to an article about the law passed before the congress went over to the democrats in 2007: <br />The following is misleading:<br />
<blockquote> “They’re trying to drive a lot more development into the fixed-price arena, and that’s problematical,” Heinemeier said. He said the measure shifts the risk of such projects disproportionately to the contractor, hurting its ability to take on development projects, especially when they involve leading-edge technologies.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>As exercised, management of development contracts in fixed price did not put the risks on the contractors.  In fact during the Reagan era huge profits were made on development contracts which similar profits could not be achieved in safer for industry cost plus contracts.</p>
<p>The way it worked:  The A-12 contractor received a fixed price contract to design the A-12,  too heavy, stealth fighter for unnneeded fleet aircraft carriers.  The contractor had planed to make a lot of money by delivering a bad performance and get a new contract to do the work over.  Fixed price means if the contractor don&#8217;t expend the costs they still get paid the agreed price and make a lot of margin.<br />But, some dedicated civil servant blew the whistle, Dick Cheney as Secretary of Defense terminated the effort and now the litigation continues as the DoD tries to get its money back.</p>
<p>In 1991 congress required development and engineering efforts be done under cost plus contracts.  As the quote above notes the government assumes all the risk in cost plus, but the contractors do not get much profit since for the contractor there is no risk.  So, unlike A-12, the contractors can redo the shoddy design in cost plus forever but not make any real money.</p>
<p>On the way out the door the republicans changed all this.  Now it is back to bad work being compensated with excellent margins, to be redone at good margin.</p>
<p>Back to very profitable whittling beaks like they enjoyed with Reagan&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;</p>

                                <p>It is almost impossible to figure out whether Social Security is tracking better or worse than projected using productivity or Real GDP, for one thing the data lags and moreover is subject to revision. But there is one measure that can be tracked with precision: Trust Fund cash balances which are reported to the penny by the Treasury Department with a one month lag. Which means that the June and hence mid-year Report is out. So how about some numbers?</p>
<p>The web page for all the Trust Fund Reports (including Medicare HI, Highways etc) is http://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/tfmp/tfmp.htm For my purposes I just want to look at OAS (Old Age Survivors) and DI (Disability) the Reports themselves are found at the links below.<br />OAS ftp://ftp.publicdebt.treas.gov/dfi/tfmb/dfifo0608.pdf<br />DI   ftp://ftp.publicdebt.treas.gov/dfi/tfmb/dfifd0608.pdf</p>
<p>Our starting point as always is the Report in this case <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/IV_SRest.html#248224">Table IV.A1.—Operations of the OASI Trust Fund, Calendar Years 2003-171 [Amounts in billions]</a> and <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/IV_SRest.html#251965">Table IV.A2.—Operations of the DI Trust Fund, Calendar Years 2003-171 [Amounts in billions]</a><br />Per IV.A1 the opening balance for OAS was $2.023 trillion, projected year end balance under Intermediate Cost $2.216, projected year end balance under Low Cost $2.221.<br />Per IV.A2 the opening balance for DI was $214 billion, projected year end under IC $218.7 billion, under LC $221.3 billion</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t even have to do the math, that same table shows that under IC the OAS balance was projected to increase by $192.4 billion, while under LC the number is $197.6. For DI the equivalent figures are IC $3.8 billion, LC $6.4 billion.</p>
<p>So what does Treasury tell us for a mid-year result?: OAS $2.140 trillion, DI $220 billion, for a total June 30 OASDI balance of $2.360 trillion.</p>
<p>Assuming for the moment that income generally comes in evenly between the first six months and the last six months (reasonable enough because it seems to divide seasonal effects pretty evenly (wage people, feel free to fill us in in comments)) how are we doing? Well OAS has gone up by $117 billion, DI up by $5 billion. Against a IC projection that would have OAS up by $96.2 billion and DI up by $1.9 billion against an LC projection that would have OAS up by $98.8 billion and DI up by $3.2 billion.</p>
<p>Well what does this mean? I am not sure, I was hoping you all could tell me. But it continues a pattern. Over the last decade DI has always lagged OAS in that its Trust Fund was projected to run out sooner, something that can be graphically in <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/IV_LRest.html#266183">Figure IV.B3.—Long-Range OASI and DI Trust Fund Ratios [Assets as a percentage of annual expenditures]</a>, in the 2008 Report its date of Trust Fund depletion is projected at 2025 under IC. On the other hand look at the result under LC (outcome I).</p>
<p>Conclusion one. DI is smashing through projections just as it did in 2007. While combined OASDI came in modestly ahead of projections that year, all of that was due to DI, the weak Q4 having burned OAS quite badly (it was on track to break projections right through Sept). Conclusion two. OAS delivered 59% of its projected increase by June 30th, DI 263% against IC projections. Under LC projections the numbers work out the same for OAS at 59% and DI at 142%.</p>
<p>Conclusion last. Social Security seems to be weathering the current storm pretty well. If like 2007 we have a really rocky Q4 then the outlook might darken somewhat but for now things are looking good. (Please place math corrections in comments, Because I don&#8217;t doubt the possibility. Which is why I give the original links.)</p>

The Washington Post&#8217;s Neil Irwin should have his license to write about economic news revoked.  His <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/31/AR2008073100669.html?hpid=topnews">lede</a>:<br />
<blockquote>The U.S. economy grew at a healthy pace in the second quarter, the government said today, despite being buffeted by a financial crisis, a deep housing slump, high fuel prices and a weak job market.</p>
<p>Gross domestic product rose at a 1.9 percent inflation-adjusted annual rate in the April through June period, far above what forecasters would have expected just a few months ago.</p></blockquote>
<p>Compare <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103&#038;sid=aAa5DTryVKLc&#038;refer=news">Bloomberg</a>:<br />
<blockquote>The U.S. economy shrank at the end of 2007 and grew less than forecast in this year&#8217;s second quarter, signaling that the country is in worse shape than many investors and analysts had thought&#8230;</p>
<p>The economy may weaken further as the temporary boost from tax rebates, which aided a pick-up in gross domestic product last quarter from the previous three months, fades.</p></blockquote>
<p>U.S. population growth is around <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2002.html">0.9%</a> p.a.   So real GDP growth of -0.2%, 0.9%, and 1.9% for the last three quarters implies growth per capita of roughly -1.1%, 0%, and 1%, respectively, with hopes for Q3 not exactly running high.   How on earth can a reporter with half a brain call that a &#8220;healthy pace,&#8221; and an editor let the claim into print?</p>
<p>Added: Here&#8217;s an <a href="http://www.econbrowser.com/archives/2008/07/not_quite_a_rec.html">optimistic but informed take from Prof. Hamilton</a>; my concern is that lots of mischief can be made with &#8220;apart from the things that were bad, things were pretty good!&#8221; arguments.</p>
<p>Update: The current version of the story (12:39 P.M.) replaces &#8220;healthy&#8221; with &#8220;solid,&#8221; and adds a &#8220;but&#8221; paragraph before the &#8220;above what forecasters would have expected&#8221; bit.</p>

<blockquote><p>Mortgage-backed assets with face value of $30.6B were just sold by Merrill for $6.7B…but, amazingly, this 80% loss on the securities only gives a kind of upper bound on their value: Merrill had to provide 75% of the financing to the buyer…..</p>
<p>Word on the street is that this financing arrangement isn’t atypical. Securitization warehousers are now paying to move the loans off of their books on to other balance sheets while keeping a large chunk of the risk. What this does is to chop up the write-downs into pieces spread over different entities and different accounting periods &#8211; some far enough in the future that the participants can hope the market will recover before they have to realize the loses. Of course the market may not and I doubt if the accounting reflects the contingent risk.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>Hat tip to Mark Thoma link to <a href="http://economistmom.com/2008/07/would-you-work-harder/">Economistmom</a> for this link to a <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/27/AR2008072701440.html">WaPO column</a> in the Human Behavior section by Shankar Vedantam.</p>
<blockquote><p>Psychologists have long been interested in what happens when people&#8217;s internal drives are replaced by external motivations. A host of experiments have shown that when threats and rewards enter the picture, they tend to destroy the inner drives. Paychecks and pink slips might be powerful reasons to get out of bed each day, but they turn out to be surprisingly ineffective &#8212; and even counterproductive &#8212; in getting people to perform at their best. </p>
<p>More than three decades ago, Edward Deci, a social and personality psychologist at the University of Rochester, found the first experimental evidence of a phenomenon with wide relevance to the way most Americans conduct their personal, professional and social lives. </p>
<p>Deci tracked a bunch of college students who were solving puzzles for fun. He divided them into two groups. One group was allowed to keep solving puzzles as before. People in the other were offered a small financial reward for each puzzle they solved. </p>
<p>The psychologist later evaluated the volunteers: He found that people given a financial incentive were now less interested in solving puzzles on their own time. Although these people had earlier been just as eager as those in the other group, offering an external incentive seemed to kill their internal drive. </p>
<p>&#8220;They thought of it as something they really enjoy and like to do, but now they do it in order to get money, and they think of the task as an instrument to get money and not an activity that has value in its own right,&#8221; Deci said. &#8220;Human beings both want to &#8212; and, in a deeper way, need to &#8212; feel a sense of being autonomous. When someone else begins to seduce you into behaving with an offer of a reward, it takes away your sense of being autonomous. Now you are doing it for someone else.&#8221; </p>
<p>Rewards and punishments guide the lives of most Americans. Young children are given stars for putting away their toys, kids earn a few bucks for mowing the lawn, and teens are told they will be grounded if they get in trouble. For adults, stock options, raises, demotions and firings become different kinds of carrots and sticks. </p>
<p>Beliefs about the utility of rewards and punishments in motivating human behavior are deeply ingrained, and most people don&#8217;t know that more than 100 research studies have shown that motivating people in this manner can have the unintentional effect of undermining their internal drives. </p>
<p>The striking thing about the research, said Roland Benabou, an economist at the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University, is that it is so starkly at odds with bedrock economic principles. </p>
<p>&#8220;A central tenet of economics is that individuals respond to incentives,&#8221; Benabou noted in one research study. &#8220;For psychologists and sociologists, in contrast, rewards and punishments are often counterproductive, because they undermine intrinsic motivation.&#8221; </p></blockquote>
<p>Many parts of psychology as practiced have abandoned Skinerian models of incentives, so perhaps it is time for economics to do so as well.  M&#038;Ms never really worked the way they were expected to anyway.</p>
<p>We have also previously touched on scarcity and found it is not what many expect it to be as well, and came up with some descriptors beyond physical scarcity, to scarcity of capital/profit ratio, to building surplus as soon as stored value begins (the old school heating system image, guaranteed to make an impression on teachers), and finally a caution:</p>
<blockquote><p>Teaching kids that what exists simply exists without asking them to consider why, or providing answers based in marginalist theory, its subjectivisms and imaginary equilibriums, is essentially no more than indoctrination meant to absolve rather than progress.</p></blockquote>

<p>How is that handled with undergrads and voters?  (Or even 12th graders).</p>

<p>Tribal Economy</p>
<p>There has been references on AngryBear to economic structures, workforce participation and economic justice among tribal/village residents in the past. Informed readers may know that Marx and Engels repeatedly cited Lewis Henry Morgan&#8217;s Ancient Societies; another of Morgan&#8217;s publications is League of the Haudenosaunee (Iroquois). My mother has previously published an article subtitled &#8220;A Native American Looks at Economics,&#8221; in PERSPECTIVES ON BUSINESS AND GLOBAL CHANGE;   World Business Academy Journal, vol. 10 no. 4, 1996. Here&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.ratical.org/ratville/future/economics.html">link</a> to her article.</p>
<p>I can contribute more information about this topic, based on our family&#8217;s Oneida (Iroquois) heritage. For hundreds of years prior to mass European immigration, the citizens of the Iroquois Confederacy enjoyed peace, leisure and material surplus. Extensive Western documentation of Iroquois prosperity, economic and social structure dates from the mid 17th century. [I like Dr. Barbara Mann&#8217;s Iroquoian Women for her summary and critique of these sources. She also has a feminist chapter on Iroquoian economies.]</p>
<p>Dr. Mann asserts the basis of the Iroquois economy can best be described as spiritual. Kinship was recognized, even across species. We all shared the same mother and all of our necessities were gifts from her. The social/political structure which also implemented our economic practices was clan based and our efforts were communal. The Oneida lived in clan-based longhouses, which were overseen by clan mothers-see for example, <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=gdZFeT6j7nsC&#038;pg=PA150&#038;lpg=PA150&#038;dq=underwood+clan+mothers&#038;source=web&#038;ots=9dTeNN2zOv&#038;sig=qo9yLtAtkkUXN-N9mYzJvnEqcwk&#038;hl=en&#038;sa=X&#038;oi=book_result&#038;resnum=1&#038;ct=result#PPA150,M1">beginning on p. 156</a>.  </p>
<p>The clan mother was responsible, among many tasks, for preserving harmony within the clan. Distribution of clan bounty was guided by the principle, &#8220;To each according to need, from each according to ability.&#8221; It was well-recognized that undeveloped ability is a source of disquiet. Tribal members were observed in order to gain information about their individual strengths and interests. The pedagogical system had an initial goal of helping each individual understand *themselves as a learner* and a further goal of helping all tribal members to be as open and acquisitive of new information as possible. Intellectual bias was considered to be almost suicidal. Think about that.</p>
<p>The men wove the longhouses and the villages together. Their voting rights (clan affiiation) remained at their mother&#8217;s long house. During a marriage, the man moved into his wife&#8217;s longhouse. When he hunted, however, it was to feed his sister&#8217;s children. The Oneida believed that a marriage benefitted from not having that economic dependency. The sister, in turn, sewed her brother&#8217;s clothes and mocassins.</p>
<p>Has this 100% labor force participation, 100% safety net changed? And what has been the force of any change? Well, the longhouse as a housing model has fallen to disuse. The Dawes General Allotment Act of 1887 was specifically targeted at Native communalism. Here&#8217;s the author, Senator Henry Dawes, in 1883: &#8220;They have got as far as they can go, because they own their land in common. &#8230; There is no selfishness, which is at the bottom of civilization.&#8221; Recent history included dwindling land base and forced acculturation through adoptions and boarding schools. Currently, though, Oneida fortunes, as those of numerous tribes, are on the rise. This results, again, in shared prosperity. The Oneida Wisconsin, for example, raise beef and crops which are available to tribal members at a discount.<br />&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;<br />This post by reader Laurie</p>

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p><a href="http://www.clingendael.nl/publications/2008/20080700_ciep_energy_jesse.pdf">Clingendael</a> has released an interesting report regarding the coming oil crisis. (No, we are not quite there yet.) The crisis or crunch is slated for 2010, around the beginning of the next decade, five years earlier than the IEA predicted in 2007 (cf <a href="http://www.worldenergyoutlook.org/2007.asp">World Energy Outlook 2007</a>).</p>
<p>That crunch will occur, despite some demand destruction and despite weak global economic growth. Perhaps only a severe and prolonged global recession will contain energy prices somewhat.</p>
<p>Compounding our difficulty is the fact that alternate energy sources are not mature enough to provide us the energy we need for continued growth. Indeed, they will not be plentiful soon enough for us to avoid real hardship.</p>
<p>All of the above strikes this writer as old hat, a familiar and depressing old hat at that. What is interesting is how the report deals with the recent spike&#8211;along with its subsequent fluctuations.</p>
<p>The writers see a struggle between two modes in establishing the price of oil.<br />
<blockquote>a) The cost of the marginal barrel of supply as determined by the most expensive barrel plus a margin for supply/demand fundamentals and geopolitical risks, driven by open markets in an OECD economic framework and</p></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>b) The real User Value of oil&#8211;determined by increasingly closed markets (for new reserve exploitation; for bilateral oil trade flows; for refined products), as supported by several of the major OPEC countries and Russia.</p></blockquote>
<p>The first is how oil has been traditionally priced. Given production, refinery, and transportation costs&#8211;each stage tacking on some reasonable profit&#8211;, we arrive at the final price, which the writers put at about $110.</p>
<p>However, with a crunch in the making and with growing global demand, a new way of pricing oil is coming into play.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ok, oil-lovers, what is it worth to you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Such a question is possible when oil markets are increasingly closed. Additionally and importantly, there are more buyers for that oil&#8211;and, of course, fewer sellers.</p>
<p>This new pricing regime will mean that oil producers can meet their &#8220;income requirements&#8221; through price, not volume. Additionally, oil that can be stored in the ground will only gain in value as we approach crunch time.</p>
<p>What we are watching, then, is a transition period between the two pricing structures: first one dominates; then the other. The recent high prices were, in effect, testing User Value; after all, &#8220;weak globalization&#8221; has doubled &#8220;the consumer base to 1.5. to 2 billion people in a period of less 15 years.&#8221; Yet, if globalization were to take deep hold, i.e., China and India&#8217;s billions start owning cars, then we would see an impossible strain on present oil production. Oil producers are fully aware of this fact. Another reason a new pricing structure can be tested.</p>
<p>According to the writers, the next IEA report will assert that for 2030, &#8220;a new supply/demand outlook&#8221; will be &#8220;around 100-105 million b/d,&#8221; in contrast to the 2007 production of &#8220;116 million b/d.&#8221; Demand destruction in the U.S. will, of necessity, be around 50-75%.</p>
<p>Despite the Arctic prospect or fields off Brazil&#8211;whatever&#8211;, present discoveries are not keeping pace with oil fields in decline. The writers go so far as saying there will be &#8220;demand rationing&#8221; in the U.S.</p>
<p>In newly emerging markets such as China, there is the problem of oil subsidies. Relaxing their subsidies too much&#8211;or even beginning to tax oil to contain demand&#8211;will obviously bring enormous inflation, smothering the effort &#8220;to catch up&#8221; industrially with the West.</p>
<p>(Clearly, as U.S. prices continue their bumpy road upward, the U.S. consumer is going to holler louder and louder about the taxes on oil, pointing out that other countries unfairly subsidize prices.)</p>
<p>The writers spend a good deal of the report discussing Sovereign Wealth Funds and the enormous sums of monies some SWE&#8217;s are gathering as a result of oil&#8211;think Middle East. Money is power; in the case of the Middle East, enormous money is enormous power in the hands of tiny countries ruled by a few families. He who owns the spice&#8230;. interesting that <i>Dune</i> is a desert planet. That oil is becoming a closed market makes possible not only a different pricing modality but also a radical shift in wealth. (Poor America, it will never know what hit it.)</p>
<p>In short, the future of oil in the not too distant future does not make easy or pleasant reading.</p>
<p>As I read these kinds of informative reports, I have to wonder where the economists have been&#8230;and those who celebrated the coming wonders of globalization. Did anyone bother to check the cupboards for supplies?</p>
