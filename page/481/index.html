<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/02/03/AR2009020304024.html?hpid=topnews">The Washington Post</a> had an article on the stimulus package, but this is the part that caught my eye.  A filibuster does not seem to be the real problem.</p>
<blockquote><p>The most ambitious effort to cut the bill is being led by  Sens. Ben Nelson (D-Neb.) and  Susan Collins (R-Maine), moderates in their parties who share a dislike of the current version. Collins is scheduled to visit Obama at the White House this afternoon. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to go to him with a list&#8221; of suggested deletions, she said.</p>
<p>Nelson said he and Collins have agreed to &#8220;tens of billions&#8221; in cuts, although he said he is skeptical that the effort will reach Collins&#8217;s target of $200 billion in reductions. The pair has counted up to 20 allies in their effort, with more Democrats than Republicans at this point. </p></blockquote>

<p>Bad Bank Bail-out and A Better Approach</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-banks4-2009feb04,0,5656617.story">E. Scott Reckard at the LA Times writes</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p>The federal government has invested $45 billion in Citigroup and guaranteed more than $300 billion of its troubled loans. Answering complaints that bailed-out banks aren&#8217;t lending, Citi said Tuesday that it had committed $36.5 billion &#8220;to support U.S. consumers, businesses and our communities during these challenging times.&#8221; The funds are mainly for home mortgages and purchases of mortgage-backed securities. </p>
<p>In normal times, $45 billion in bank capital might result in 10 times that amount in new loans. Citi described the $36.5 billion as the &#8220;first stage&#8221; of what it hoped to do.</p></blockquote>
<p>Put another way, that&#8217;s one awfully small money multiplier.  The reason its so small is that Citi is going to use the loot to support its past and present spending before it loans money out.</p>
<p>Back in September, I anticipated the problem and laid out what I thought was a <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/09/cactus-offers-another-immodest-proposal.html">better approach</a>.  I still think its better.  Here it goes again:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>Consider the role of banks. Banks essentially store money and act as payment agents for depositors, and they loan out money to borrowers. </p>
<p>Now, consider the role of the Fed. The Fed essentially stores money and acts as a payment agent for the banks, and it loans out money to the banks. Put another way &#8211; the banks are just an intermediary between the Fed and public. Put even more simply &#8211; the banks are a middle-man. Now, back in the day, it was necessary to have a middle-man, someone who knew the local market, who knew the depositors and knew the borrowers, and understood whether making a given load was a good idea. There&#8217;s no way the Fed, say, could do that from Washington.</p>
<p>But today, things are different. First, its clear that the banks have no idea who their depositors are, and much less whether the folks borrowing have any chance at all of paying back what they borrowed. That&#8217;s self-evident from the fact we&#8217;re even debating whether to bail out much of the industry. Second, in this day and age, what information they do have and use generally comes from third parties. They aren&#8217;t any better at buying FICO scores than anyone else would be. </p>
<p>So the question is &#8211; how exactly do we benefit from having the banks operating as a middle-man between the rest of us and the Fed? Why not let people deposit their money with the Fed, just like banks do, and let people borrow from the discount window, just like banks (and apparently some non-banks) do? I don&#8217;t see the benefits to giving banks rights that people don&#8217;t have, but I do see plenty of cost. I see a lot of duplication of services between various banks, and I see huge salaries going to the bank executives for that duplication and for acting as middle-men&#8230; and that doesn&#8217;t even count the cost of the current bail-out. Note also &#8211; salaries at the Fed are much lower. I believe Big Bad Ben Bernanke makes about $200K, a pittance compared to the salaries received by the CEOs of a number of banks recently driven into the ground. And there ain&#8217;t no stock options at the Fed either!</p>
<p>So I propose letting the public bank at the Fed, just the same way banks bank at the Fed. I&#8217;m not proposing banks be made illegal &#8211; if they can find a way to operate without having a getting privileged access to the Fed, wonderful. That&#8217;s free enterprise and it should be applauded. But the current system, where banks get privileged access to the Federal Reserve is rather unfair, and its been that way since long before this mess began.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>Robert Waldmann jumps into </p>
<p><a href="http://www.portfolio.com/views/blogs/market-movers/2009/02/04/banker-pay-salmon-vs-barnett">a conversation between Felix Salmon and Megan Barnett on limiting banker compensation.</a></p>
<p>after the jump my comment which is addressed to Salmon.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think that you&#8217;re surprised that I agree with you and disagree with Barnett.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d say a strong argument for the cap is the good old moral hazard in bailouts argument.  If the bailout doesn&#8217;t inflict pain on bankers, they will rationally conclude that they are playing heads I win tails the US treasury loses and will rationally act to increase future expected payments from the treasury.</p>
<p>This argument was absolutely standard during previous bailouts (e.g. Alan Greenspan proposed bailing out NYC on terms such that no other city would ever become insolvent again).  Oddly the people who raised the moral hazard argument most loudly in all other bailouts are silent now (I&#8217;m not talking about Barnett).  It can&#8217;t be that they have more sympathy for rich bankers than for Democratic politicians and third world countries can it ? But is there any other way of reconciling what they said and what they are saying ?</p>
<p>Will banks refuse to participate, because it is not in managers interests to do so ?  Look it is not in managers interests to visibly place their own interests above those of shareholders and then go bankrupt.  If management refuses bailout money and the bank goes under they will have shareholder lawsuits to worry about and that means their current wealth will not be safe.  But I&#8217;m sure they can count on a fair hearing from a jury of their peers (th 7th amendment says that plaintiffs have the right to demand a trial by jury if more than $25 is at stake).  I&#8217;d guess that bankers who won&#8217;t work for $500,000 but whose banks might go under will quit, and good riddance.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d say the argument that something must be done about Wall Street compensation is less compelling.  The cap is meant to be temporary.  Some sort of reform of compensation should be permanent.  Of course your argument that current incentives make crises more likely is, as yet, unrefuted, and you know lots of people would like to refute it.</p>

                                <p>Robert Waldmann responds to Arnold Kling&#8217;s response</p>
<p>Arnold Kling was generous enough with his time to respond <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2009/01/reply_to_robert.html">here</a> to a post of mine</p>
<p>Sorry I was AWOL.  Thank you Arnold Kling for responding to me.  I&#8217;m flattered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not quite. The more heterogeneous labor force does not necessarily raise the natural rate of unemployment. However, it makes it harder to recover from an adverse shock.&#8221;</p>
<p>On heterogeneity and the Beveridge curve, I don&#8217;t see how heterogeneity can make it harder to recover from a shock or reduce the beneficial impact of a stimulus and increase the costly impact without causing the Beveridge curve to shift out.  Shocks occur constantly, gross worker employer separations and hires occur at a huge rate compared to net changes in employment.   I can&#8217;t think of a model in which the task of matching workers with jobs has become much more difficult, yet the Beveridge curve is about where it was.  </p>
<p>I&#8217;d say the explanation is that people differ in dimensions other than educational qualifications, so total heterogeneity hasn&#8217;t increased that much, and that matching technology has improved (you know the internet and all that).</p>
<p>more on his response after the jump.</p>
<p>
<blockquote> Now, in order to get them back to work you need to add demand that specifically uses their skills. This is a much harder trick to pull off. My Hayekian point is that this sounds like a task better suited to the market, not for Washington&#8211;hence my remark about &#8220;central planning.&#8221;</p>
<p>I think that a stimulus that allows the private sector to figure out resource allocation (my preferred approach being a cut in the employer contribution for Social security) is more likely to be effective than a stimulus where the government tries to figure out the resource allocation (health care IT, &#8220;green jobs,&#8221; etc.).</p></blockquote>
<p>You seem to be assuming that workers can&#8217;t shift from sector to sector if there is surplus demand for labor in one sector (do to the stimulus) and not in another.  This is a rather pessimistic view of the magic of the market.</p>
<p>You think that an increase in demand for labor should therefore match the education, geographic, occupation, education, age gender etc of the excess supply (unemployment).  So you conclude that the right policy is an equal across the board shift in demand.  </p>
<p>It is not enough to believe that the market is better than the government in every way to conclude this.  You have to assume that any effort at targeting will be worse than no targeting, so, for example, there is no hint as to relative sudden employment in construction and in agriculture.  </p>
<p>Whether there is an accross the board stimulus (cut in payroll taxes) or a sector specific one, the market will figure out how to get people into jobs in roughly the same way.  Each intervention implies miss match and need for the market to match people.  Which creates a bigger problem is one of &#8220;payroll tax cuts vs the current stimulus&#8221; not &#8220;the market vs the current stimulus.&#8221;   </p>
<p>I think I can reproduce the logic that leads to the payroll tax proposal</p>
<p>1. Things that happen in the market are optimal, therefore the government should not tilt the playing field.<br />2. Something very bad has happened in the market as is shown by aggregates cliff diving.<br />3. Therefore we should assume that that which has clearly gone terribly wrong in the market has gone equally wrong in every sector so the government shouldn&#8217;t tilt the playing field.</p>
<p>I see a coherent position that everything is for the best in the best of all possible market economies.  I can&#8217;t see the logic of a position that the economy is messed up but there is no way for policy makers to estimate which sectors are more messed up than others.   </p>

                                <p>Well not really, they just repeat some talking points without giving numbers. (via Dean Baker) <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dispatch.com/live/content/editorials/stories/2009/02/03/badstim.ART_ART_02-03-09_A8_VPCP5R0.html?sid=101">Stimulus plan should focus on private-sector jobs, not increased social spending</a><br />
<blockquote>Also, the $300 billion targeted for social programs, many of them Democratic favorites, would not generate much immediate economic activity. Improving teacher quality, providing additional cash for Head Start and promoting wellness, for example, are standard government social-spending items that have little to do with stimulating instantaneous economic activity. Democrats are simply expanding spending on their traditional priorities under the cover of an economic emergency.</p>
<p>In fact, only about 5 percent of the plan&#8217;s spending is aimed at the immediate creation of jobs through infrastructure projects, such as repair and construction of roads and bridges. But if the goal is to blunt a wave of job losses as Obama has said, this is where the money should be spent. It also is the only kind of spending that represents a lasting investment, one that will benefit the future taxpayers who will be footing the bill for this borrowed spending.</p></blockquote>
<p> Well I got to call bullshit on this. Unless someone out there can actually present a list of spending that supports either number. 5% of the bill adds up to about $45 billion. Is that really all that is being spent on job creation? Maybe if you limit your definition to roads and bridges. But buildings have lasting utility and create jobs. And some services have lasting utilities and researchers and teachers fill jobs. But even absent that is there really $300 billion in social programs in this bill? Well lets see. Using real numbers.</p>
<p>Under the House Bill spending is divided into Division A which are basically contracts and Division B which is direct government spending. Looking from the top down how does that break out? In the following I will give the total for the category (plus obvious social spending).</p>
<p>Division A<br />Title 1 $248 million General Provisions <br />Title 2 $27 billion Agriculture, Nutrition, Rural Development ($20 billion Supplemental Nutrition Assistance)<br />Title 3 $14 billion Commerce, Science, Justice<br />Title 4 $4.8 billion Defense <br />Title 5 $49 billion Energy and Water<br />Title 6 $8.5 billion Financial Services and Federal Building<br />Title 7 $1.1 billion Homeland Security<br />Title 8 $14.5 billion Interior and Environment<br />Title 9 $91 billion Labor and Education ($71 billion excluding school construction)<br />Title 10 $7 billion Military Construction and Veterans Affairs<br />Title 11 $500 million State Department<br />Title 12 $59 billion Transportation and HUD ($11 billion Housing Assistance, $5 billion  Community Development)<br />Title 13 $39 billion State Fiscal Stabilization (???)<br />Total $358 billion.</p>
<p>First we are not really getting very far towards that $300 billion in social spending. And that figure of $45 billion for infrastructure is clearly bogus unless you simply limit your focus to Title 12 and ignore all spending on government buildings, schools, energy (including the smart grid), water projects (because levees and dams are infrastructure) and broadband build out.</p>
<p>Division B<br />Title 1 $79 billion Tax Provisions<br />Title 2 $45.6 billion Unemployment and Struggling families ($45.6 billion)<br />Title 3 $13 billion Health Insurance for the Unemployed ($13 billion)<br />Title 4 $20 billion Health Information Technology (???)<br />Title 5 $89 billion Medicaid ($89 billion)<br />Total $248 billion</p>
<p>So we can see at least $218 billion in what could immediately be labeled Social Programs. But that includes $20 billion in food stamps, $58 billion in spending on the unemployed, and $89 billion on medicare. Now maybe some of that can be pared back but I don&#8217;t know of anyone who seriously says we should let the jobless and working poor just starve or go without access to medical care. Plus a lot of the Title 12 spending on Housing Assistance and Community Development ends up funding infrastructure. Making the following kind of heartless &#8220;$300 billion targeted for social programs, many of them Democratic favorites, would not generate much immediate economic activity&#8221; as well as being economic nonsense. Huge percentages of that total (however derived) are directly injected into the economy in purchases of food, household essentials, utility payments and rent. The only pool of money that remotely meets the description of Democratic favored social programs (as opposed to not letting people starve, which ideally is not a partisan issue) is the money in Title 9 Labor and Education. Which I will break out under the fold.</p>
<blockquote><p>Improving teacher quality, providing additional cash for Head Start and promoting wellness, for example, are standard government social-spending items that have little to do with stimulating instantaneous economic activity. Democrats are simply expanding spending on their traditional priorities under the cover of an economic emergency.</p></blockquote>
<p> Quite apart from the ridiculous implication that these items even remotely start adding up to $300 billion, the premise is not very sound to start with. I believe it was Ken who linked to a study showing the direct economic benefits from Head Start. But in any event what are the dollars involved.</p>
<p>Title 9 breaks down into the following categories:<br />$20 billion Health and Human Services<br />$4.6 billion Employment and Training Administration<br />$20 billion School Modernization and Repair <br />$17 billion Student Aid<br />$30 billion Other Education<br />$600 million Other Title 9</p>
<p>Given that no one seriously is proposing eliminating student loans and that School Modernization is both infrastructure and would stimulate economic activity (if not instantaneously, someone is smoking tax cut weed) we seem to be left with some $50 billion that potentially fits the Dispatches description. So lets take it down a level.</p>
<p>Subtitle A Labor<br />$500 million State grants for training and employment programs<br />$1.2 billion State grants for youth job programs and other activities (youth defined as 24 or younger)<br />$1 billion State Grants for training dislocated workers<br />$500 million national dislocated worker reserve fund<br />$50 million YouthBuild program<br />$750 million Training and placement in high tech and emerging industry sectors<br />$120 million Community Service Employment for Older Americans<br />$500 million State unemployment administration<br />$80 million Administration<br />$300 million Job Corps</p>
<p>Subtitle B Health and Human Services<br />$500 million Grants to Health Centers<br />$1 billion Renovation and Repair of Health Centers<br />$88 million Equipping new headquarters of the Public Health Service<br />$600 million Training nurses, doctors and dentists<br />$462 million Center for Disease Control for equipment, construction and renovation<br />$1.5 billion National Center for Research Resources for renovation and repair of non-Federal Research facilities<br />$1.5 billion Office of the Director for research grants<br />$600 million NIH buildings and facilities<br />$700 million Comparative effectiveness research<br />$1 billion Low Income Home Energy Assistance (1981 Act)<br />$2 billion Child Care block grants to States<br />$1 billion Head Start<br />$1.1 billion expansion of Early Head Start<br />$1 billion Community Services Block Grants<br />$100 million Faith Based and Community Groups<br />$200 million Aging Services (1965 Act)<br />$2 billion Information Technology<br />$900 million Public Health and Social Services Emergencies Fund<br />$3 billion Prevention and Wellness Fund<br />But lets see how this breaks down: $2.35 billion to the Center for Disease Control including $954 million for immunization and $554 million for chronic disease, health promotion and genomics programs</p>
<p>Subtitle C Education<br />$13 billion Education for the Disadvantaged (pursuant to the ESEA Act of 1965)<br />$100 million Impact Aid (offsets the impact of local military bases not paying property tax)<br />$1 billion School Improvement (this relates to a Homeless act, how exactly I don&#8217;t know)<br />$225 million Innovation and Improvement<br />$13.6 billion Special Education<br />$700 million Rehabilitation and Disability Research (getting the disabled into the work force)<br />$16 billion Student Aid for College Students (Pell grants)<br />$50 million Student Aid Administration<br />$100 million Higher Education<br />$250 million Education Technical Assistance Act (statewide data systems)</p>
<p>Where the hell is the wishlist here? This is overwhelmingly continuing funding for existing programs. I don&#8217;t even see an obvious place for the Dispatch&#8217;s &#8220;improving teacher quality&#8221;, maybe it is somewhere in that rather mysterious $1 bn for &#8216;school improvement&#8217;. As for Head Start we are talking $2.1 billion or about .25% of the bill. And &#8220;wellness&#8221; seems to be just tucked in with the wider program to tackle chronic diseases.</p>
<p>Once again we can see that these anti-stimulus people are not even cherry-picking, instead they are digging deep into the bill to pick nits. The categories of spending the Dispatch editorial writer is point out as support for his advice to &#8220;Start over&#8221; represent less than 1% of the total package. (And BTW the guy swallows the Fama argument whole). Each and everytime some one expresses outrage over some line item &#8220;tax breaks for Hollywood!&#8221; or &#8220;teacher quality&#8221; to try to make people think the whole bill is just payback to campaign supporters. Instead the argument is just bogosity, bluster and bullshit meant as a stalking horse for tax cuts (which is what he means when he says &#8220;private-sector jobs&#8221;).</p>
<p>This is just not an economic argument. And sorry I still can&#8217;t taste the liverwurst.</p>

<p>The Case for No Stimulus</p>
<blockquote><p>For the last three months, Americans have been treated to a debate over what the government can do to ease the effects of the current recession and bring about a speedy recovery. Lawmakers of both parties are now considering a very large stimulus package.</p>
<p>But there is a catch. Every penny of such a package must be borrowed, because the government is already running a $1.2 trillion deficit this year and faces a $703 billion deficit for next year, according to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office. The question, then, is whether the government can help the economy by spending money if it can only do so by first sucking that money out of the economy.</p></blockquote>
<p>An <a target="_blank" href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=YWE0OGQyMzNiMjg4MGNkZDc1N2I1NzlkMzY2YTQ2NDE=">interview</a> with Heritage Foundation&#8217;s leading budget analyst Brian Riedl, can be summarized as follows:</p>
<p>1)  &#8220;Every dollar Congress injects into the economy must first be taxed or borrowed out of the economy&#8230;.Therefore, again, there is no net increase in aggregate demand. It just means that one group of people has $800 billion less to spend, and the government has $800 billion more to spend.&#8221;</p>
<p>2)  &#8221; There is this notion that the redistribution of money from savers to spenders creates new spending&#8230;&#8230;.people use their savings to pay down20debts or invest. Or they put it into the bank, who in turn lends it to others to spend. Therefore, savings circulate through the investment side of the economy, which counts just as much in the GDP as the consumption side of the economy..&#8221;</p>
<p>3)  &#8220;The government is going to have to raise interest rates in order to convince people to lend them the full amount they need. We’re already facing a deficit of $1.2 trillion this year, and 700 billion next year. We borrowed $700 billion for TARP, and now we’re going to borrow $800 billion for this stimulus package. Compare those numbers to the entire public debt, which was 5.8 trillion up until a few months ago. It’s going to be very difficult for a global economy, which is already in a recession, to supply the U.S. government with [$3 trillion] in new borrowing&#8230;..The government may have to raise interest rates higher and higher and higher in order to persuade people to lend their diminishing savings to the government.</p>
<p>4)  &#8220;So we’re actually going to pay to induce people not to invest in the economy, to hide their money in government bonds instead.  There’s only so much savings to go around in the private economy. Every dollar of savings that government snatches up through borrowing is one dollar of savings less to be invested in businesses that create jobs. It’s one dollar less to expand new technologies. And so there’s a real danger that the economy is going to suffer long-term be cause it’s not going to have the investment capital to create productivity and jobs, because Washington is gobbling up all the savings for their own spending.&#8221;</p>
<p>5)  &#8220;Economic growth depends on productivity growth, and that on whether we’re using some of our money to create jobs, capital and technology that allows the economy to grow in the future. If you believe that the private sector is better at spending money to create investment and productivity than government, then letting individuals keep more of the money they earn, in the long run, will increase the economy’s capacity to produce wealth&#8230;. That’s why the government policy right now—borrowing money out of savings and investment and putting it into consumption—will not only be zero sum in the short run, but it will actually reduce our long-run capacity for growth.&#8221;</p>
<p>6) &#8220;There are some things the government can provide that would actually improve the economy—say, if they build new and badly needed roads, or a new electrical grid that allows us to deliver electricity better and more cheaply. But the benefit of such investments would be years away, would they not? (and) the immediate act of having the government borrow money and hire people—does not necessarily create any jobs&#8230;&#8230;.In the long run, the existence of a strong infrastructure with highways that allow the transport of goods and services, can help the economy grow . . . But in the short run, the act of spending $1 bi llion on highways does not stimulate the economy. The 34,000 highway workers that receive that billion dollars are receiving a billion dollars that had to be borrowed out of the private economy, which in turn lost the same amount of money and thus is able to support fewer jobs for now . . . So when you borrow and spend that money, you’ve just shifted jobs from one part of the economy to the other.&#8221;</p>

<p>Both <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123317069332125243.html" target="_blank">Putin</a> and a Premier Wen&#8217;s <a href="http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/WenJiabao02182009.pdf" target="_blank">Jaibao&#8217;s</a> (China) speeches at Davos deserve real attention, for they indicate how two major world players are approaching the global economic slowdown. Each has a slightly different take on its causes; each approaches the solution a bit differently.</p>
<p>In this post, I will look only at some of Putin&#8217;s remarks. They are far more even-handed than Wen&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Russia is clearly positioning itself between the U.S. and China.</p>
<p><strong>Putin on the financial causes</strong>:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the last few months, virtually every speech on this subject started with criticism of the United States. But I will do nothing of the kind. </p>
<p>I just want to remind you that, just a year ago, American delegates speaking from this rostrum emphasised the US economy&#8217;s fundamental stability and its cloudless prospects. </p>
<p>Today, investment banks, the pride of Wall Street, have virtually ceased to exist. In just 12 months, they have posted losses exceeding the profits they made in the last 25 years. This example alone reflects the real situation better than any criticism.</p>
<p>The time for enlightenment has come. We must calmly, and without gloating, assess the root causes of this situation and try to peek into the future.</p>
<p>In our opinion, the crisis was brought about by a combination of several factors.<br />The existing financial system has failed. Substandard regulation has contributed to the crisis, failing to duly heed tremendous risks.</p>
<p>Add to this colossal disproportions that have accumulated over the last few years. This primarily concerns disproportions between the scale of financial operations and the fundamental value of assets, as well as those between the increased burden on international loans and the sources of their collateral.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><strong>Putin on the global causes</strong>:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>The entire economic growth system, where one regional centre prints money without respite and consumes material wealth, while another regional centre manufactures inexpensive goods and saves money printed by other governments, has suffered a major setback.</p>
<p>I would like to add that this system has left entire regions, including Europe, on the outskirts of global economic processes and has prevented them from adopting key economic and financial decisions.</p>
<p>Moreover, generated prosperity was distributed extremely unevenly among various population strata. This applies to differences between social strata in certain countries, including highly developed ones. And it equally applies to gaps between countries and regions.</p>
<p>A considerable share of the world&#8217;s population still cannot afford comfortable housing, education and quality health care. Even a global recovery posted in the last few years has failed to radically change this situation.</p>
<p>And, finally, this crisis was brought about by excessive expectations. Corporate appetites with regard to constantly growing demand swelled unjustifiably. The race between stock market indices and capitalisation began to overshadow rising labour productivity and real-life corporate effectiveness.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, excessive expectations were not only typical of the business community. They set the pace for rapidly growing personal consumption standards, primarily in the industrial world. We must openly admit that such growth was not backed by a real potential. This amounted to unearned wealth, a loan that will have to be repaid by future generations.</p>
<p>This pyramid of expectations would have collapsed sooner or later. In fact, this is happening right before our eyes.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Putin on global imbalances</strong>:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>The entire economic growth system, where one regional centre prints money without respite and consumes material wealth, while another regional centre manufactures inexpensive goods and saves money printed by other governments, has suffered a major setback.</p>

<p>Putin extends the global picture. Note the oblique references to China and the U.S.:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>We must not revert to isolationism and unrestrained economic egotism. The leaders of the world&#8217;s largest economies agreed during the November 2008 G20 summit not to create barriers hindering global trade and capital flows. Russia shares these principles.</p>
<p>Although additional protectionism will prove inevitable during the crisis, all of us must display a sense of proportion.</p>
<p>Excessive intervention in economic activity and blind faith in the state&#8217;s omnipotence is another possible mistake.</p>
<p>True, the state&#8217;s increased role in times of crisis is a natural reaction to market setbacks. Instead of streamlining market mechanisms, some are tempted to expand state economic intervention to the greatest possible extent.</p>
<p>The concentration of surplus assets in the hands of the state is a negative aspect of anti-crisis measures in virtually every nation.</p>
<p>In the 20th century, the Soviet Union made the state&#8217;s role absolute. In the long run, this made the Soviet economy totally uncompetitive. This lesson cost us dearly. I am sure nobody wants to see it repeated. Nor should we turn a blind eye to the fact that the spirit of free enterprise, including the principle of personal responsibility of businesspeople, investors and shareholders for their decisions, is being eroded in the last few months. There is no reason to believe that we can achieve better results by shifting responsibility onto the state.</p>
<p>And one more point: anti-crisis measures should not escalate into financial populism and a refusal to implement responsible macroeconomic policies. The unjustified swelling of the budgetary deficit and the accumulation of public debts are just as destructive as adventurous stock-jobbing.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Putin&#8217;s four step solution to the financial problem</strong>:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>We must assess the real situation and write off all hopeless debts and &#8220;bad&#8221; assets.<br />True, this will be an extremely painful and unpleasant process. Far from everyone can accept such measures, fearing for their capitalisation, bonuses or reputation. However, we would &#8220;conserve&#8221; and prolong the crisis, unless we clean up our balance sheets. I believe financial authorities must work out the required mechanism for writing off debts that corresponds to today&#8217;s needs. </li>
<li>It is high time we got rid of virtual money </li>
<li>Excessive dependence on a single reserve currency is dangerous for the global economy. Consequently, it would be sensible to encourage the objective process of creating several strong reserve currencies in the future. It is high time we launched a detailed discussion of methods to facilitate a smooth and irreversible switchover to the new model. </li>
<li>Most nations convert their international reserves into foreign currencies and must therefore be convinced that they are reliable. Those issuing reserve and accounting currencies are objectively interested in their use by other states.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>In short, Putin is calling for a real discussion of the global role of currency itself. (When asked how to avoid currency manipulation for trade advantage, Volcker replied simply, &#8220;Use a universal currency.&#8221; While Putin is not going that route, he is addressing the role of currency in the present crisis.)</p>
<p>
<blockquote>We must strengthen the system of global regulators based on international law and a system of multilateral agreements in order to prevent chaos and unpredictability in such a multipolar world. Consequently, it is very important that we reassess the role of leading international organisations and institutions.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Time permitting, I intend to do a post on Wen Jiabao&#8217;s remarks. (Those remarks are not easily excerpted; apparently they were photographed and then placed in pdf file.)</p>

                                <p>Robert Waldmann</p>
<p>People are talking about regulating credit default swaps (CDS) .</p>
<p>They include Collin Petersen D-Minn who <a href="http://www.thedeal.com/dealscape/2009/01/congress_moves_to_tamp_down_cr.php">proposes making it illegal to own a CDS without owning the underlying instrument </a>(this is absolutely standard for other kinds of insurance).</p>
<p>and <a href="http://www.thedeal.com/dealscape/2009/01/congress_moves_to_tamp_down_cr.php">George Soros who supports the proposal.</a><br />(via <a href="http://www.portfolio.com/views/blogs/market-movers/2009/01/30/extra-credit-friday-edition">Felix Salmon</a>)</p>
<p>A problem, I think, is that it is not clear how people can be forced to keep the underlying instrument, to use it to buy only one CDS etc.</p>
<p>I think there is a very simple regulation which will do the trick.  For all future CDSs, the writer of the CDS is required to make scheduled payments on the instrument to the owner of the CDS if and only if the instrument is in default, and the CDS holder hands over the CDS and the insured instrument.  This is called a physical settlement CDS.  The regulation says that all CDSs written from now on are phyisical settlement CDSs no matter what is said or written in any contract whatsoever or anywhere else.  </p>
<p>The time to check that someone really has suffered damage is when they file a claim.  Then the insurer and the insured have diametrically opposite incentives and won&#8217;t collude to evade the regulation.</p>
<p>Soros has interesting thoughts on the damage done by CDSs which I quote and discuss after the jump</p>
<p>Soros writes</p>
<blockquote><p>Going short on bonds by buying a CDS contract carries limited risk but unlimited profit potential; by contrast, selling credit default swaps offers limited profits but practically unlimited risks.</p>
<p>The asymmetry encourages speculating on the short side, which in turn exerts a downward pressure on the underlying bonds. When an adverse development is expected, the negative effect can become overwhelming because CDS tend to be priced as warrants, not as options: people buy them not because they expect an eventual default but because they expect the CDS to appreciate during the lifetime of the contract.</p>
<p>No arbitrage can correct the mispricing. That can be clearly seen in US and UK government bonds, whose actual price is much higher than that implied by CDS. These asymmetries are difficult to reconcile with the efficient market hypothesis, the notion that securities prices accurately reflect all known information.</p>
<p>The third step is to recognise reflexivity – that is to say, the mispricing of financial instruments can affect the fundamentals that market prices are supposed to reflect. Nowhere is this phenomenon more pronounced than in the case of financial institutions, whose ability to do business is dependent on confidence and trust. That means that “bear raids” to drive down the share prices of these institutions can be self-validating. That is in direct contradiction to the efficient market hypothesis.</p>
<p>Putting these three considerations together leads to the conclusion that Lehman, AIG and other financial institutions were destroyed by bear raids in which the shorting of stocks and buying of CDS amplified and reinforced each other. Unlimited shorting was made possible by the 2007 abolition of the uptick rule (which hindered bear raids by allowing short-selling only when prices were rising). The unlimited selling of bonds was facilitated by the CDS market. Together, the two made a lethal combination.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is a bit odd.  Doubts about AIGs solvency should have reduced the value of CDSs written by AIG.  The argument must work via an assumption that there was an attack on the world financial system or something, where fear meant demand for CDSs which brought down AIG which caused fear.  </p>
<p>The argument about asymmetric returns is hard to reconcile with the assumption (never ever made by Soros) that people rationally maximize the expected discounted present value of a stream of utility which is a concave function of consumption.  Obviously Soros thinks that there are compulsive gamblers out there messing up financial markets.  I agree.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t see the &#8220;No arbitrage can correct the mispricing. That can be clearly seen in US and UK government bonds, whose actual price is much higher than that implied by CDS.&#8221; argument.  It seems to me that writing CDSs on US and UK government bonds is about as close to riskless arbitrage as one ever gets.  Of course that&#8217;s what they thought at AIG too.  Given the requirement on posting collateral, one needs deep pockets to profit from the mispricing.  I think the US should insure UK debt and vice versa.  I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;d both make a profit.</p>

<blockquote><p>The climate is warm, there&#8217;s no shortage of exotic food, and the cost of living is rock bottom. That&#8217;s IBM (NYSE: IBM)&#8217;s pitch to the laid-off American workers it&#8217;s offering to place in India. The catch: Wages in the country are pennies-on-the-dollar compared to U.S. salaries.</p>
<p>Under a program called Project Match, IBM will help workers laid off from domestic sites obtain travel and visa assistance for countries in which Big Blue has openings. Mostly that&#8217;s developing markets like India, China, and Brazil.</p>
<p>&#8220;IBM has established Project Match to help you locate potential job opportunities in growth markets where your skills are in demand,&#8221; IBM says in an internal notice on the initiative. &#8220;Should you accept a position in one of these countries, IBM offers financial assistance to offset moving costs, provides immigration support, such as visa assistance, and other support to help ease the transition of an international move.&#8221;</p>
<p>The document states that the program is limited to &#8220;satisfactory performers who have been notified of separation from IBM U.S. or Canada and are willing to work on local terms and conditions.&#8221; The latter indicates that workers will be paid according to prevailing norms in the countries to which they relocate. In many cases, that could be substantially less than what they earned in North America.</p>
<p>IBM has laid off more than 4,000 workers in the United States since the beginning of January, according to an employee group. The company has confirmed layoffs but won&#8217;t comment on specific numbers.(bolding mine)</p></blockquote>
