<p>President Bush <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2006/07/20060711-1.html">Discussing Mid-Session Review</a> putting forth a host of myths including the propositions that: (1) the Laffer Curve is working; and (2) that his Administration is serious about cutting government spending.  Where to begin?<br />
<blockquote>One of the most important measures of our success in cutting the deficit is the size of the deficit in relation to the size of our economy. Think of it like a mortgage. When you take out a home loan, the most important measure is not how much you borrow, it is how much you borrow compared to how much you earn. If your income goes up, your mortgage takes up less of your family&#8217;s budget. Same is true of our national economy. When the economy expands, our nation&#8217;s income goes up and the burden of the deficit shrinks.</p></blockquote>
<p>Our graph shows the total Federal debt relative to GDP from 1996 to 2007 (projected).  The debt to GDP ratio had declined to 32.6% by 1981 but the type of fiscal irresponsibility we saw under St. Ronald Reagan led to a debt to GDP ratio equal to 67.3% before the fiscal sanity of the 1990’s finally took hold.  By 2001, the debt to GDP ratio had declined to 57.4%.  But the current fiscal irresponsibility has caused the debt to GDP ratio to rise to 64.3% as of the end of fiscal 2005.  Table B.79 of the Economic Report of the President suggests that it will rise to 67.5% by the end of fiscal 2007.  OK, this Administration does tend to high ball its short-term forecasts of deficits so the President can tout that his free lunch supply-side policies have led to more tax revenues than his bogus forecasts predicted.  But every forecasts of the future debt to GDP ratio based on current fiscal policy has this ratio rising quite substantially.  So when the President talks about the shrinking burden of the debt, he must be talking about what happened during the late 1990’s and not his own fiscal record. </p>
<p>President Bush also painted us Democrats as Marxists and the Republicans as Keynesians:<br />
<blockquote>When I came to Washington, taxes were too high, and the economy was headed into a recession. Some said the answer was to centralize power in Washington, and let the politicians make the decisions about what to do with the people&#8217;s money. That was one point of view. We had a different point of view. I believe that the economy prospers when we trust the American people to make their own decisions about how to save, spend and invest. So starting in 2001, my administration worked with the United States Congress and we delivered the largest tax relief since Ronald Reagan was in the White House. We cut rates for everyone who pays income taxes. We reduced the marriage penalty, we doubled the child tax credit, and we cut the death tax. We cut the tax paid by most small businesses because we understand that most new jobs are created by small businesses. And we encouraged economic expansion by cutting taxes on dividends and capital gains. Together, these tax cuts left nearly $1.1 trillion in the hands of American workers and families and small business owners, and they used this money to help fuel an economic resurgence that&#8217;s now in its 18th straight quarter of growth. The tax cuts we passed work … Since August 2003, the U.S. economy has added more than 5.4 million new jobs. Our unemployment rate is down to 4.6 percent… Our job in Washington is to keep this expansion growing &#8211; going, and to promote pro-growth policies that let Americans keep more of their hard-earned paychecks and aid us in reducing our fiscal deficit. In order to reduce the deficit, you got to set priorities. And in working with Congress, we&#8217;ve set clear priorities. And the number one priority of this administration and this Congress is to make sure men and women who are defending the security of the United States and helping to spread peace through the spread of liberty get all the help they need from our government. We will always fund the troops in harm&#8217;s way.</p></blockquote>
<p>Economies typically eventually recover from recessions even without the aid of aggregate demand policies.  And if the Republicans think that tax cuts are the only way to increase aggregate demand, let me suggest that his version of tax cuts may not have even been the best way to restore full employment.  But if we have reached full employment as the Republicans are suggesting – then the continued fiscal mismanagement of cutting taxes while having high government spending lowers national savings, which is what is behind the Federal Reserve’s decision to raise interest rates – which will crowd-out investment.  But never mind my sermon – go check out <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2006/07/has_the_budget_.html">Mark Thoma</a> and the <a href="http://www.cbpp.org/7-10-06bud.htm">CBPP</a>. </p>
<p>President Bush went on to imply that his Administration is cutting non-defense Federal spending but if one compared Federal spending as a share of GDP in 2005 versus what it was in 2000, spending has risen from 19% of GDP to 20.4% of GDP.  The increase in the defense spending to GDP ratio was only 0.9% with the increase in nondefense purchases as a share of GDP being 0.2%.  So even Federal transfers have risen faster than GDP.  President Bush also seems to think that cutting about $30 billion in waste will solve a $600 billion per year General Fund deficit problem.  Isn’t fuzzy math magical?</p>
<p>But it’s this part of his speech that really concerns me:<br />
<blockquote>The next test is whether or not we can get a line-item veto out of the United States Senate. A line-item veto is an important tool for controlling spending. See, it will allow the President to target unnecessary spending that sometimes lawmakers put into large bills. Today when a lawmaker loads up a good bill with wasteful spending, I don&#8217;t have any choices. I either sign the bill with the bad spending or veto the whole bill that&#8217;s got good spending in it. And I think it would be wise if we&#8217;re seriously &#8211; seriously concerned about wasteful spending to enable the executive branch to interface effectively with the legislative branch to eliminate that kind of wasteful spending. And so we&#8217;ve proposed a line-item veto that the House of Representatives passed. Under this proposal, the President can approve spending that&#8217;s necessary; redline spending that&#8217;s not; and send back the wasteful, unnecessary spending to the Congress for a prompt up or down vote.</p></blockquote>
<p>President Bush and his allies in Congress destroyed the paygo rules that served the Clinton Administration and Congress so well in the 1990’s.  He also introduced Senator Ted “bridge to nowhere” Stevens just before his speech on his allegedly fiscally responsible regime.  Look, I’m all for restoring fiscal discipline but I don’t trust either this President or the current GOP leadership in Congress.  Currently if Senator Stevens wants another bridge to nowhere he must get at least a couple of sleazy Democrats to go along with him in some giant log-rolling scam – none of which President Bush has bothered to veto.  President Bush and Karl Rove also treat the U.S. Treasury as some sort of giant partisan piggy bank.  Unfortunately, we have to deal with this partisan and fiscally irresponsible President for two more years – but we don’t have to allow Dennis Hastert to be the Speaker for two more year.  But imagine if we gave THIS President a line item veto and had a GOP dominated Congress at the same time.  The new motto would be “pork is for us but not for thee” as Karl Rove’s loyal soldiers would pass out partisan goodies only to those who supported his agenda since President Bush could line item veto anything else.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://www.econbrowser.com/archives/2006/07/is_the_surge_in.html">Menzie Chinn</a> has more on both the short-term volatility of tax revenues and the long-term deficit prospects.</p>
<p><strong>Update II</strong>:  For those in Pennsylvania, take note.  <a href="http://www.cato-at-liberty.org/2006/07/10/rick-santorum-left-right-and-wrong">David Boaz</a> of the Cato Institute describes Rick Santorum thusly:<br />
<blockquote>So . . . the third-ranking Republican leader in the Senate wants to be known as a porker, an earmarker, and Senator Pothole … He declared himself against individualism, against libertarianism, against “this whole idea of personal autonomy, &#8230; this idea that people should be left alone.” Now he’s also against the conservative idea that taxpayers matter, that the federal government has a limited role &#8230; At least Santorum is right about one thing: sometimes the left and the right meet in the center. In this case the big-spending, intrusive, mommy-AND-daddy-state center. But he’s wrong that we’ve never had a firmly individualist society where people are “left alone, able to do whatever they want to do.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Just another Bush Republican who keeps voting to increase taxes on our children!</p>

                                <p>I live close to my office in Los Angeles but on occasion have to drive down to Orange County, which is a task I truly abhor as it causes me to deal with some of the worst traffic and worst drivers in these two rather different parts of Southern California.  Yesterday, I had to do so but I did get to listen to some very good NPR discussions as to how Proposition 103 might lower my insurance rates.  The debate raised several questions in my mind and the good news is that <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2006/07/should_geograph.html">Mark Thoma</a> treats us to an article from the Los Angeles Times and his own thoughts:<br />
<blockquote>If the market is competitive and rates are already set to price risk efficiently, and geography plays a significant role in the risk assessment, then complying with Proposition 103 would move away from the efficient outcome unless it corrects a market failure &#8230; The part people find objectionable, I think, is that their rates are linked to factors outside of their immediate control. Where you live, not your individual skills as a driver determine your rates. In big cities, there is a congestion externality, and that extra congestion increases the chances of an accident. There are also other factors such as how often cars get stolen that play a role in pricing geographic locations as well. Again, assuming people take appropriate precautions, this is outside of their individual control.</p></blockquote>
<p>But I choose to live close to work, have a stellar driving record, and have not had my car stolen.  So why do I pay high insurance premiums?  Am I underestimating the expected cost to my insurance company or is there some form of asymmetric information problem where my insurance company does not understand what I low risk my driving habits represent?  Or could the NPR discussion that implied that there is an element of market power at play here be part of the story?</p>

<blockquote><p>DEFINITIONS: <i>The household debt service ratio (DSR) is an estimate of the ratio of debt payments to disposable personal income. Debt payments consist of the estimated required payments on outstanding mortgage and consumer debt. </p>
<p>The financial obligations ratio (FOR) adds automobile lease payments, rental payments on tenant-occupied property, homeowners&#8217; insurance, and property tax payments to the debt service ratio.</i></p></blockquote>
<p>  The extraordinary level of indebtedness (and debt service), compared to historical levels, might explain why Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) have grown faster than personal income (PI) in recent years. </p>
<p><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/hello/243/2888/640/PCEQ106.jpg"><img border="0" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/hello/243/2888/320/PCEQ106.jpg"></a></p>
<p>The chart above shows PCE as a percent of Personal Income for the last 50 years.  For the last few years, this ratio has been close to 85%; far above the normal range.  The result has been a negative savings rate for the last year.  (See: Savings Rate <a href="http://calculatedrisk.blogspot.com/2006/06/gdp-q1-personal-savings.html">Quarterly</a>, Savings Rate <a href="http://calculatedrisk.blogspot.com/2006/06/core-pce-and-savings-rate.html">monthly</a>)</p>
<p>It appears households have borrowed against their homes to maintain their lifestyles and consumption.  As the housing bubble continues to unwind, this might impact PCE in the future as some households struggle with their debt service.</p>
<p>On a related note, with the new bankruptcy law, homeowners cannot easily walk away from their mortgage debt like during the housing busts of the early &#8217;80s and &#8217;90s.

                                <p>The <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=NTVlZWE2NDQ3ZDkyMDA3ODhkNzIzOTNmOGRkMmYyYjM=">National Review</a> decided to run Kudlow’s thoroughly discredited nonsense about output growth, which included these claims:<br />
<blockquote>Well, the marquis employment report for June may have showed “only” 121,000 new nonfarm payroll jobs, below Wall Street expectations. But this leads to another factoid that the mainstream media largely ignores: The household survey of job creation has been booming at a much faster clip than headline corporate payrolls. This survey shows 387,000 new jobs in June, following 288,000 in May. When this last happened in 2003-04 (remember the “jobless recovery” election-year rant of Democrats?), it was corporate payrolls that caught up to the more entrepreneurial household survey &#8211; which more accurately records job creation by small-business owner/operators &#8230; Wages are rising today, so we know domestic labor markets must be tightening, not softening &#8230; The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics is recognizing the importance of the small-business-driven household survey, and has suggested averaging household jobs with the corporate payroll survey to get a clearer jobs picture.</p></blockquote>
<p>Since nominal wages grew by less than inflation – real wages fell.  Kudlow is still touting his bogus argument that the household survey is a more reliable measure of employment growth – but as to this last claim, check out <a href="http://www.blah3.com/article.php?story=20060710130150304">this rebuttal</a>: <br />
<blockquote>BLS has always maintained that both surveys are needed to provide a complete picture of the labor market [ed. note: This was not at issue], but BLS has not suggested that one should average the monthly household and payroll survey employment estimates, or the over-the-month changes of these figures. </p></blockquote>
<p>I wonder if Glenn Reynolds still considers Kudlow to be <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2006/07/i_dont_think_th.html">reliable</a>?</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: K Harris asked in a comment why the Household Survey increase has exceeded the Payroll Survey increase by almost 1 million.  Via <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2006/07/fed_watch_still.html">Mark Thoma</a> comes <a href="http://users2.wsj.com/lmda/do/checkLogin?mg=wsj-users2&#038;url=http%3A%2F%2Fonline.wsj.com%2Farticle%2FSB115231020168301049.html">Grep Ip</a> explaining the difference in the growth of the two measures of employment growth:<br />
<blockquote>The two surveys often send different signals, but the differences have been especially large lately. Since December, payroll jobs are up 854,000 while household employment is up 1,584,000. Since both surveys estimate total employment from a sample, neither is a perfect tally but economists generally prefer the payroll survey because its sample is far larger &#8211; about 400,000 establishments, compared to the household survey&#8217;s 60,000 households. In theory, the two could be completely accurate yet come up with widely different job counts, because they define employment differently. In June, these definitional differences accounted for more than the entire difference in the two results. </p>
<p>Of the many definitional differences, the largest, in terms of magnitude, are that the household survey counts the self-employed while the payroll survey does not; and that the payroll survey counts someone with two jobs twice, whereas the household survey counts that person once. Each month, the BLS comes up with a household estimate of employment as using the payroll survey&#8217;s definition of employment. In June, that total showed a decline in jobs of 92,000 from May. (You can see the estimates and a technical note on their web site here: http://www.bls.gov/web/ces_cps_trends.pdf1) </p>
<p>Is this positive or negative news for the job market? The answer depends on the reason for the divergence. If it&#8217;s because the ranks of the self-employed are growing, the job market is stronger than the payroll survey suggests. If it&#8217;s because the number of people with multiple jobs is shrinking, the market is weaker than the household survey shows &#8211; all else equal. In June, the message appears to be negative. The number of the self-employed rose 20,000. But the number of multiple job-holders fell 320,000, which means at least that many fewer paychecks from this group. (It may not mean less income: The worker may have gone from two part time jobs to one full time job.) But these two categories swing widely from month to month. In the last six months, the number of the self-employed has risen 346,000 while the number of multiple-job holders has fallen just 75,000. Even using the payroll definition, the household data are still highly volatile; it showed a huge gain of 606,000 jobs in May from April, far more than the payroll survey&#8217;s increase of 92,000. </p>
<p>Yet since last August, the two have told almost the same story: Jobs are up by 1.4 million according to the payroll survey, and 1.3 million using the household survey but the payroll definition. The household survey using the broader household definition is up by 1.9 million, which means about 600,000 extra jobs that can&#8217;t be explained by definitional differences. It may be a sign, albeit an inconclusive one, that job creation is stronger than the payroll survey suggests.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>Noumenon ask over at <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2006/07/advice_for_demo.html">Mark Thoma’s</a> blog:</p>
<blockquote><p>Excuse me, I can see from Google that you have criticized Lawrence Kudlow in the past. Can you explain how he can claim that &#8220;over the past 11 quarters &#8230; America has increased the size of its entire economy by 20 percent?&#8221; Because that seems to imply a 6% growth rate and it&#8217;s only been like 3.5%.</p></blockquote>
<p>Real GDP as of 2006QI was only 11.5% higher than it was as of 2005QII so Noumenon is correct.  Here is what <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2006/07/the_bigbang_story_of_us_privat.html">Lawrence Kudlow</a> wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Did you know that just over the past 11 quarters, dating back to the June 2003 Bush tax cuts, America has increased the size of its entire economy by 20 percent? In less than three years, the U.S. economic pie has expanded by $2.2 trillion, an output add-on that is roughly the same size as the total Chinese economy, and much larger than the total economic size of nations like India, Mexico, Ireland, and Belgium.</p></blockquote>
<p>Nominal GDP increased by 25% over this period but I guess Kudlow continues not to understand the difference between nominal v. real increases.  As far as the Chinese economy, the <a href="http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/rankorder/2001rank.html">CIA World Factbook</a> reports its GDP (purchasing power parity) was $8.859 trillion in 2005.  </p>
<p>Kudlow has been long guilty of trying to tell his readers that Bush’s fiscal fiasco actually promotes investment and long-term growth even though the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/07/borrowing-is-not-necessarily-pro.html">facts</a> say otherwise.  As Brad DeLong often wonders – is it stupidity or mendacity?  It appears to be both.</p>
<p>Update: Even <a href="http://instapundit.com/#031307">Glenn Reynolds</a> got the point eventually – with a little help:</p>
<blockquote><p>Reader Daniel Amerman says that Kudlow didn&#8217;t include inflation, and that if you include inflation, the U.S. economic expansion was &#8220;only&#8221; 11.4 %. As Amerman says, “11.4% over 11 quarters is quite respectable in real terms, there is no need for misrepresentation and hyperbole.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Is Kudlow less intelligent than Glenn Reynolds or is Amerman correct that Kudlow misrepresented this issue.  Being called out by the rightwingers should be a single to the National Review that it is time to fire Lawrence Kudlow.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>How many ways can the folks at the National Review try to argue that Bush’s fiscal fiasco increases long-term growth rather than decreases it? <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=YTNmM2YwM2UzYmRlMDZlMDE0MDkyYmFmMzFhZTYwYzE=">William Kucewicz</a> tries another one:</p>
<blockquote><p>Net lending in the first quarter totaled a record $4.50 trillion (seasonally adjusted annual rate), up $457 billion, or 11.3 percent, from the previous quarter and $1.46 trillion, or 47.9 percent, above year-earlier levels, according to the Federal Reserve’s latest “Flow of Funds Accounts of the United States.” As a consequence of the Bush tax cuts on income and capital, total net lending (i.e., all credit market instruments excluding corporate equities) has risen $2.57 trillion, or a resounding 132.8 percent, in the past five years.</p></blockquote>
<p>Kucewitz is referring to table F.1 from the Flow of Funds Accounts, which shows both net lending and net borrowing.  By definition, the totals are the same.  Now would it matter who is borrowing and for what purpose?  Since Kucewitz does really address this issue, let’s pose the following query.  Suppose that the government decided to increase its borrowing by $100 billion.  What would be the effect on savings and investment?  I can think of five possible answers here:</p>
<p>Answer 1.  A Ricardian Equivalence type might argue it does not affect national savings as households increase private savings by the increase in the government deficit as they recognize that the rising Federal debt represents future tax liabilities.  Of course, George W. Bush wanted to give people their money back so they can consume more as he pretends his tax cuts are permanent.</p>
<p>Answer 2. A closed economy classical would suggest that any rise in consumption (fall in national savings) would completely crowd-out investment.  </p>
<p>Answer 3. An open economy classical model would suggest that part of the crowding-out would be in the form of reduced net exports partially offsetting the crowding-out of investment so the reduction in national savings from massive government borrowing might take the form of more lending to the U.S. from the rest of the world.  </p>
<p>Answer 4: If the economy began from a state of high unemployment, a Keynesian might argue the fiscal stimulus would increase overall production back towards full employment with the prospect of the paradox of thrift suggesting that a downward shift in the national savings schedule would also induce a favorable movement along the savings schedule.  </p>
<p>Answer 5: The National Review crowd wants us to believe that national savings rose as if people are consuming less.  Not only does this premise contradict the rhetoric of the President they worship, it is also contrary to the facts.  When economists raise the concept of crowding-out, the National Review crowd seemingly says what crowding-out.  </p>
<p>The following graph shows investment as a share of GDP from 2000 to 2005 as well as imports net of exports (labeled TB for trade balance deficit) as a share of GDP, and gross savings (GS which is the sum of investment and net exports) as a share of GDP.  Answer 3 seems to capture the long-run picture with some Keynesian elements thrown in as the economy fell below full employment from 2001 to 2003 only to at least partially return to full employment by now.  We had a rather dramatic fall in the national savings rate, which mainly crowded out net exports but also crowded investment.  </p>

<p>Our second graph displays net lending (= net borrowing) as a percent of GDP, which did increase from 17% in 2000 to over 27% in 2005 as Kucewicz’s discussion notes (although expressing the numbers in terms of nominal figures and not relative to GDP sort of exaggerates things).  While Kucemicz fails to mention this fact, our graph shows about half of the increase represents an increase in government borrowing or put differently an increase in the amount of net lending from the rest of the world. </p>

<p>But you may ask – what about the rest of the increase in net lending?  Kucewicz charts the increase in the debt to equity ratio as he writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Finance is the sine qua non of economic growth. Without it, risk-taking is stymied, knowledge can’t be commercialized, and an economy stagnates &#8230; New corporate bond issues in the first quarter topped $965.8 billion (seasonally adjusted annual rate), up 3.9 percent, or $36.2 billion, from the prior quarter and a smashing 50.6 percent, or $324.7 billion, higher than a year before. Throughout much of the first half of the decade, corporations took advantage of low U.S. interest rates by switching from equity to bond financing. In the first quarter, in fact, equity financing totaled about $99 billion, down almost 73 percent, or $267 billion, from a year earlier.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, much of the increase in borrowing represents corporations paying out retained earnings to shareholders.  At this point, we have to mention the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modigliani-Miller_theorem">Modigliani-Miller propositions</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>the value of a firm is unaffected by how that firm is financed. It does not matter if the firm&#8217;s capital is raised by issuing stock or selling debt. It does not matter what the firm&#8217;s dividend policy is.</p></blockquote>
<p>A shift from equity to debt financing might indeed increase the amount of risk borne by equity owners but the Modigliani-Miller propositions would hold that this change in method of financing is only a risk transfer. </p>
<p>Kucewicz fails to mention who is doing the additional borrowing and lending and what is driving the decision to increase borrowing.  Certainly, we have not witnessed an outward shift of the national savings schedule – regardless of how many distortions of the data the National Review can concoct.</p>

<blockquote><p>Footnotes don’t prove that claims are accurate until the footnotes are actually checked! And, starting on page one of her book, Coulter’s citations frequently show that her claims have been simply made up. Indeed, by the time Malcolm penned his recent review, it was perfectly clear that Coulter’s book was packed with factual howlers &#8230; Counting footnotes! Who would believe that such PlaySkool procedures could drive the American public discourse?</p></blockquote>
<p>Ms. Coulter’s publisher answered the recent charges about alleged plagiarism with <a href="http://mediamatters.org/items/200607070011">this</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>We have reviewed the allegations of plagiarism surrounding Godless and found them to be as trivial and meritless as they are irresponsible. Any author is entitled to do what Ann Coulter has done in the three snippets cited: research and report facts. The number of words used by our author in these snippets is so minimal that there is no requirement for attribution. As an experienced author and attorney, Ms. Coulter knows when attribution is appropriate, as underscored by the nineteen pages of hundreds of endnotes contained in Godless.</p></blockquote>
<p>Nineteen pages with hundreds of endnotes! I just hope Crown Publishing has done a better job of insuring the author is reporting facts.</p>

<blockquote>In this column, I&#8217;m focusing on bad economics. In fact, I&#8217;m going to write about what I consider to be the two worst economic ideas &#8211; or at least ideas that pass as economics, though both have been thoroughly repudiated by nearly all credible thinkers &#8230; Neither the Reagan nor the George W. Bush tax cuts were &#8220;self-financing,&#8221; as the Laffer disciples like to argue. According to The Economist &#8211; my former employer and no bastion of left-wing thought &#8211; the current Bush Administration&#8217;s top economist, Gregory Mankiw, estimated that decreasing taxes on labor would generate enough growth to recoup only about 17 cents for each lost dollar; a tax cut on capital is better, paying for more than half of itself. Still, the bottom line from the Bush Administration itself is that tax cuts reduce Uncle Sam&#8217;s take. So why does Laffer&#8217;s sketch on Dick Cheney&#8217;s cocktail napkin rank near the top of my list of bad economic ideas? Because, when applied to the U.S., it&#8217;s intellectually dishonest. The Laffer Curve offers the false promise that we can cut taxes without making any sacrifice on the spending side, and that&#8217;s simply not true. It&#8217;s the economic equivalent of arguing that you can lose weight by eating more. Let me be perfectly clear: I&#8217;m not arguing that tax cuts are bad. I&#8217;m simply pointing out that we can&#8217;t pretend that tax cuts won&#8217;t require reductions on the spending side to balance the budget. In fact, you can disregard every other argument in this column and think about one thing: If Laffer were right, lower taxes would never require any spending sacrifice. We could pay a mere one percent of our income in taxes and still fund all of our government spending &#8212; and maybe more! Do you think that&#8217;s really possible? This column should give you a hint of why economics is called the dismal science &#8211; it&#8217;s all about tradeoffs. We&#8217;re the ones telling you that if you get more of something, you probably have to get less of something else. Whether it&#8217;s tax policy or dieting, you can&#8217;t have your cake and lose weight, too, which is why America currently has huge deficits and a lot of fat people.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>Via <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2006/07/paul_krugman_th.html">Mark Thoma</a> comes <a href="http://select.nytimes.com/2006/07/07/opinion/07krugman.html&#038;OQ=_rQ3D1&#038;OP=23b3bf9dQ2FBQ7BQ3EOBLpxQ22Q22LBCss8BsZBsZBQ224yQ26yQ22Q26BsZQ2BxqU3wQ26HTL37">Paul Krugman</a> on how often the Bush crowd plays the treason card.  In a somewhat similar vein, <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2006/07/reviving_the_generals_revolt.html">Jed Babbin</a> has a Karl Rove pre-approved discussion of &#8220;Fiasco: The American Adventure in Iraq&#8221; by Tom Risen:<br />
<blockquote>The Clintons &#8211; and the plural is more accurate than the singular &#8211; picked generals for their political fealty rather than military prowess. The worst public examples were Wesley Clark (a Friend of Bill from their Oxford Rhodes scholar days), and Anthony Zinni … The least public and most political general is former Army Chief of Staff Gen. Eric Shinseki.</p></blockquote>
<p>Wesley Clark used to be a Republican.  I think Anthony Zinni still is.  I have no clue whether Eric Shinseki is a Democrat, Republican, or independent and quite frankly I don’t care.  All three men served our nation with distinction for many years.  Babbin’s smear jobs of these three patriots stand in stark contrast to the facts regarding the careers of each. </p>
<p>It is not surprising that Babbin cites an op-ed by <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2006/04/seven_days_in_april_generals_p.html">Tony Blankley</a>: <br />
<blockquote>Consider two hypothetical situations. In the first, a United States Army general officer in a theater of war decides by himself that he strongly disagrees with the orders of the secretary of defense. He resigns his commission, returns to private life and speaks out vigorously against both the policy and the secretary of defense.  In example two, the top 100 generals in the Army military chain of command secretly agree amongst themselves to retire and speak out &#8211; each one day after the other.  In example one, above, unambiguously, the general has behaved lawfully. In example two, an arguable case could be made that something in the nature of a mutinous sedition has occurred in violation of Article 94 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice procedure. When does an expanded version of the simple honesty and legality of the first example cross over into grounds for a court martial?</p></blockquote>
<p>Blankley tries to smear these former generals as deserving a court martial but in every case, he has the facts wrong. Clark and Zinni both retired in 2000 and Shinseki did publicly air his differences with Secretary Rumsfeld.  It is now clear that Shinseki got it right about how many troops would be needed in Iraq and Rumsfeld was horribly mistaken.  This is clear to most people but not to Jed Babbin or to <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=OTI0ZmU0NWM3M2E1Mjc3OGZhNjMwZGZiYTdlZWMwMDA=">Cliff May</a> who seems to want to blame all of Bush’s numerous failures on Bill Clinton.</p>
<p>As Cliff May and Jeb Babbin try to defend Bush’s decision to invade Iraq without a real plan for the aftermath, might they try to blame <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20060706/wl_nm/iraq_maliki_dc_2">this</a> on Clinton as well:<br />
<blockquote>BAGHDAD (Reuters) – Iraq’s prime minister urged the U.S. military on Thursday to keep &#8220;reckless&#8221; troops from serving in Iraq in order to prevent abuses like the alleged rape and murder of a teenager and her family by U.S. soldiers in March. </p></blockquote>
<p>Congresman Murtha is correct – it’s time to bring our soldiers home.</p>

                                <p>The <a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> reports:</p>
<blockquote><p>Nonfarm payroll employment rose by 121,000 in June, and the unemployment rate was unchanged at 4.6 percent, the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the U.S. Department of Labor reported today.  Employment continued to trend upward in several service-providing industries and in mining.  Average hourly earnings rose by 8 cents in June.</p></blockquote>
<p>The unemployment rate was unchanged even though the employment to population ratio increased from 63% to 63.1% as the labor force participation rate increased from 66.1% to 66.2%.  It seems the reported employment increase for the Household Survey was 387 thousand.  </p>
<p>Employment for the construction and retail trade sectors actually declined as the other sectors reported modest increases in employment.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2006/07/07/news/economy/jobs_june/index.htm">Chris Isidore</a> reports on the reactions of a few economists who share the concern about an allegedly strong labor market coming from the Federal Reserve:<br />
<blockquote>The wage gain also represents a 3.9 percent year-over-year rise, the biggest gain in that measure since June 2001. That could be seen as being inflationary, and could prompt the Federal Reserve to keep raising interest rates in an effort to cool the economy and keep prices in check.</p></blockquote>
<p>I want to simply scream that this is absolutely absurd, but let me turn the microphone over to <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2006_07/009140.php">Kevin Drum</a>: <br />
<blockquote>inflation over the past 12 months has clocked in at about 4.1%, so a 3.9% rise in nominal wages is a decrease in real wages. This is the &#8220;wage spike&#8221; the Fed is supposed to be concerned about. Riddle me this: if the Fed tries to put the brakes on wages every time they creep up from negative to zero, what will hourly wages look like over the long term? Answer: consistently down. Which is exactly what they&#8217;ve looked like over the past several decades. The overall economy is doing fine. Growth is strong, productivity is strong, corporate profits are strong, CEO compensation is stratospheric. There&#8217;s plenty of new wealth being created. The problem is that financial markets and the Federal Reserve are bound and determined to make sure that none of this new wealth makes its way into the hands of the middle class. That&#8217;s why, in our looking-glass world, a real wage decline of -0.2% is described as an increase.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Well said!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Update II</strong>: <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=MzEzMzZlZDE4MjNmN2Q2MDFmZTk4YTllMjhkM2YzMmY=">KLo</a> over at The Corner (NRO) beat this West Coast bear to reporting the June employment news as she cited a summary from the JEC, which included as its last bullet point:<br />
<blockquote>Average hourly earnings increased by 8 cents in June and have risen over the past year by 3.9 percent.</p></blockquote>
<p>So as Kevin Drum noted, nominal wages rose by less than the increase in prices, which means real wages declined.  I guess it was too early for either the JEC or KLo to check this out.</p>
<p><strong>Update III</strong>: <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2006/07/07/bush-jobs-brag">ThinkProgress</a> puts its all in perspective:<br />
<blockquote>The White House issued a fact sheet today on President Bush’s economic record. The headline blares “5.4 Million Jobs Created Since August 2003”.  The sheet suggests recent job growth proves President Bush’s economic strategy is a smashing success. <br />Let’s set aside for a moment that the “fact sheet” conveniently ignores the 22 months of jobs losses that proceeded August 2003. Instead, let’s put Bush’s job record since August 2003 in perspective:</p>
<p>1. Monthly job growth since August 2003 is 50% lower than the average of President Clinton’s entire term. Since August 2003, job growth has averaged 160,000 per month. During Clinton’s eight years in office job growth averaged 236,000 per month.  </p>
<p>2. Real wages have fallen since August 2003. The average worker’s real wages were twenty cents lower in June 2006 than they were in August 2003.</p>
<p>Any way you slice it, Bush’s economic policy has resulted in slower job growth and lower wages. That’s nothing to brag about. </p></blockquote>
