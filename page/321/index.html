<p><a target="_blank" href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2010/05/swiss-banks.html"><strong>Swiss Banks; State tax subsidies to corporations</strong>&#8220;></a></p>
<p>Busy day today, so just a note to point out an interesting blog posting at Money.co.uk on Swiss banks and the impact of banking secrecy on tax evasion.  It&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.money.co.uk/article/1005322-demystifying-swiss-bank-accounts.htm">Demystifying Swiss Banks</a>, May 15, 2010, money.co.uk.</p>
<p>Just another reason that tax reform and bank reform go together.  Banks serve corporate and high wealth individuals by creating derivative products that arbitrage tax and regulatory requirements, and by permitting them to move resources to tax havens that serve no function other than offshoring profits.  Will Congress enact a strong enough reform bill?  Or will it spend more of its efforts on &#8220;extending&#8221; the costly Bush tax cuts yet again?</p>
<p>Another interesting piece in the New York Times on <a target="_blank" http:>Companies we keep, and pay for&#8221;</a>, Jim Dwyer, NY Times, May 14, 2010.  Since corporations have no loyalty to locale anymore&#8211;not even to the US, much less to a particular state or city&#8211;it is foolhardy for states and cities to mete out huge subsidies to keep a particular corporation in town in the hopes of creating new jobs (or keeping old ones).  It would likely be much more beneficial for the community to use that money to do something directly beneficial&#8211;like fixing bridges, funding computers in schools, hiring more police, teachers, gardeners, and greeters.  That money would create instant jobs, and those jobs would create instant demand for things people have to have to live, like food shelter, clothing, and other consumer products.  That would help fund local businesses, and that would be a much better use of state and local subsidies, since it would tend to help ordinary people instead of the Big Muckety-Mucks (as my Dad used to say) that get the main dough out of the deal from corporate tax subsidies.</p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2010/05/carried-interest-some-senators-want-venture-capitalists-to-get-a-cg-ride-on-their-compensation-incom.html">Carried Interest: some senators want venture capitalists to get a CG ride on their compensation income</a></p>
<p>Everybody knows by now that managers of partnerships who have &#8220;profit interests&#8221; have been claiming that they do not have compensation income but merely a return of capital on their &#8220;carried interests&#8221; (and that may be long-term capital, they claim, when they hold the profits interest for some time and there are long term gains in the partnership that are allocated to them).</p>
<p>Many tax experts, including myself, have argued that these profits should be taxed as compensation.  At ordinary rates, like the janitors and clerks and other employees of the firm.  Immediately and without deferral, like others who work for a living.  And subject to payroll taxes (FICA, FUTA), since wages are supposed to be subject to payroll taxation.</p>
<p>Managers of private equity, hedge, venture capital, real estate and other partnerships have been able to avoid such real world consequences of working for a living in most part.  They are generally paid a fee (usually about 2% of assets under management, in hedge and private equity firms) and a &#8220;carried interest&#8221; (usually about 20% of assets under management, each year, and sometimes amounting to 30% or 50%, for the really big-time managers).  They do treat the fee as compensation, but claim that the carried interest is not.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />Congress is finally quite likely to pass a bill that will treat carried interest as the compensation that it is.  So of course each type of partnership management is lobbying for an exception for itself&#8211;tax the others, but I&#8217;m so important that you ought not to tax me because continuing to give me this incredible tax break will keep me doing this really important stuff. </p>
<p>That line is garbage.  These managers generally make kaboodles of money.  They will still do the work and making kaboodles of money even if they have to pay taxes more like ordinary employees.  </p>
<p>But some senators seem to be falling for this crappy argument.  For example,Republican Scott Brown of Massachusetts and Senators Patty Murray of Washington, Mark Warner of Virginia, Bob Casey of Pennsylvania and Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire want to exempt venture capital firms from the change in the treatment of carried interest.  The claim boils down to saying that if you tax these managers on their compensation like you tax &#8220;regular&#8221; workers, it will hurt the work that these venture capital firms do in encouraging entrepreneurialism.  See Donmoyer, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-05-13/senators-seek-venture-capitalist-waiver-from-fund-tax-update1-.html">Senators Seek Venture Capitalist Waiver from Fund Tax Increase</a>, Bloomberg.com, May 13, 2010.  </p>
<p>Can these senators really think that taxing the worker will make the managers stop managing billions of dollars? </p>
<p>Lobbying is underway.  Listen, Congress, to your head and not your pocketbooks.  Managers of partnership perform services and get paid for those services.  All of that payment should be treated as compensation, be taxed at ordinary rates, and be subject to payroll taxation.  To do otherwise is to let very wealthy people off the hook for their share of the tax burden, and to impose a greater tax burden on everybody else&#8211;especially on the little people.</p>
<p>Can the voters put two and two together to realize that any senators who end up supporting an exemption for the real estate industry or the venture capital industry (or any other industry) are more worried about losing the support of big money than they are about ensuring that big money managers pay taxes fairly just like so many ordinary American workers do?</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8230;Kentucky Republicans struck the first blow by choosing political newcomer Rand Paul as their Senate nominee. Paul, an ophthalmologist and Tea Party favorite, defeated Secretary of State Trey Grayson, who had been championed by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.</p>
<p>In a Pennsylvania contest that both parties promoted as a precursor to the midterm elections this fall, Republicans suffered a blow to their plans for taking over Congress. Democrat Mark Critz, a top aide to the late Rep. John Murtha, defeated Republican businessman Tim Burns in a special election to finish Murtha&#8217;s term representing the working-class Johnstown-area district.</p>
<p>In Arkansas, moderate Democratic Sen. Blanche Lincoln was trying to hold off a netroots-fueled primary challenge from Lt. Gov. Bill Halter. Neither cleared 50 percent of the vote Tuesday night, sending the pair into a June 8 runoff election. The winner will face GOP Rep. John Boozman, a rancher and ophthalmologist whose late brother, Fay Boozman, lost to Lincoln in 1998.</p>
<p>Specter was the third incumbent to lose his job this season, following Utah Sen. Bob Bennett&#8217;s failure to get the GOP nomination in his state and Democratic Rep. Robert Mollohan&#8217;s primary loss in West Virginia&#8230;</p></blockquote>

                                <p>One of the nice things about going to the Kauffman Foundation this year was meeting up again with Peter Klein of <a href="http://organizationsandmarkets.com/">Organizations and Markets</a>, who was my first economics professor.*  (I liked him as soon as I found out one of his first publications <a href="http://web.missouri.edu/~kleinp/papers/dh.pdf">dealt with &#8220;moral hazard&#8221; and the Designated Hitter</a>.)</p>
<p>Peter has a book out from the Mises Institute, <em><a href="http://mises.org/store/Capitalist-the-Entrepreneur-P10373.aspx">The Capitalist &#038; The Entrepreneur</a></em>.  Subtitled Essays on Organizations and Markets and carrying blurs from Business and Law people as well as the obligatory G-Mu professor (Adam Smith Award winner Peter Boettke), the book, as with Klein himself, is likely well-conceived, sharply written, and worth arguing with and about.</p>
<p>Not to mention that, at $12 from Mises, it&#8217;s very reasonably priced.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m certain I&#8217;ll have more later, after I get a chance to read it.  But it seems exactly the type of book that should be getting more discussion here.</p>
<p>*On hearing this, <a href="http://capitalgainsandgames.com/samwick">Andrew Samwick</a> said, &#8220;But you two are at opposite ends of the spectrum.&#8221;  What I Should Have Said then I say now:  &#8220;I said he was a good teacher. I never said I was a good student.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;S&#038;P and Moody’s are clearly completely incompetent, and no one should base any investment decisions on the random series of letters they apply to bonds.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8230; But without rating agencies…… who other than big investment companies/funds that have their own in-house muscle to do due-diligence can buy these things?&#8221;</p>
<p>Posted by MarshalN </p>
<p>My thoughts after the jump.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>So what&#8217;s the alternative to the random series of letters they apply to bonds? I see two possibilities.</p>
<p>1) a public ratings agency (not a public option mandatory public rating required for all regulatory purposes). Have the SEC rate bonds.</p>
<p>2) Use the prices of CDSs. Now I don&#8217;t think regulations can refer to the market prices of CDSs, which shoot up in a panic causing banks to have to liquidate assets justifying the panic. However, if Goldman Sachs were willing to issue CDS on 10% of the securities at a price typical of CDS on AAA corporate bonds, I&#8217;d be willing to buy them (Provided Goldman Sachs promised not to buy CDS on 20% etc).  </p>
<p>The point is that as noted by MarshalN only a few big firms have the muscle to rate.  We have learned it is unwise to trust raters who don&#8217;t put their money where their mouths are.  Very few big firms have enough money to put where the major mouth investors respect from raters is.  </p>
<p>This will not be cheap.  If to issue a security that pension funds can buy, you have to find some entity willing to insure 10% of it (with guarantees that they don&#8217;t hedge that risk) then it will be very costly to issue a security.  </p>
<p>That&#8217;s life.  In the real world you don&#8217;t get something for nothing and rarely get something hugely valuable for almost nothing.  For decades we got immensely valuable ratings from Moody&#8217;s, S&#038;P and Fitch for almost nothing.  Our luck has run out and it&#8217;s time to face reality as it almost always is.</p>
<p>Public ratings would be cheaper, but 2008 taught us as much about regulatory capture as they taught us about trusting private firms which don’t put their money where their mouth is.  I’d say public ratings would work OK unless and until a Republican is elected President.</p>

<blockquote><p>Although a final vote is expected within days on the White House&#8217;s top domestic priority, lawmakers have yet to settle disputes on regulating over-the-counter derivatives; curbing risky trading by banks; and the power of state authorities.</p>
<p>There will need to be resolution on these topics before the Senate can approve a massive Democratic bill designed to make the financial system less prone to crises like that of 2007-2009.</p>
<p>Analysts say that could occur as soon as Wednesday or Thursday. Delays could postpone full approval to next week, however.</p>
<p>Major votes on amendments looked unlikely on Monday or Tuesday, due to primary elections involving senators Blanche Lincoln and Arlen Specter, both Democrats.

                                <p>No wonder Brad DeLong <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/04/chris-edley-on.html">has had no luck persuading Christopher Edley to get rid of the malfeasant John Yoo</a>.  As <a href="http://www.dailyhowler.com/dh051710.html">Bob Somersby observes</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Christopher Edley thinks he’s one of your “betters.” It’s hard to believe, but that’s the exceptionally low-IQ framework this self-proclaimed member of the elite enunciated in Sunday’s piece. According to Edley, rubes like us should want our “betters” in important posts, like the post in which Kagan will serve:<br />
<blockquote>EDLEY: The tension between elitism and populism is embedded in our national DNA because America rejected the model of a monarch ruling by divine right in favor of an iffy experiment in democratic self-governance. So now you are responsible for choosing your leader. Do you want someone like you or someone better than you?</p></blockquote>
<p>What an astonishing framework! But so it goes when people like Edley spends decades inside institutions like Harvard, convincing themselves that they and their peers are “better” than all the rest of us rubes. [formatting in original]</p></blockquote>
<p>Kagan, like Yoo, &#8220;has excelled in a meritocratic system, one that is selective yet far more open than in generations past.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bonus quote from Edley:<br />
<blockquote>The gatekeeper power of such institutions is why it was so important to desegregate them (using affirmative action, among other tools) and why virtually all leaders of great universities talk about diversity and access.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yep.  Elena Kagan is All About Diversity.</p>
<p>At least <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/04/scott-horton-on.html">Edley is consistent</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Dean Edley rolls embarrassingly off the tracks.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>The Effect of Tax Cuts and Tax Hikes on Economic Expansions</strong></p>
<p>Right about now, the U.S. economy appears to be recovering from a recession (and a nasty one at that). It’s not smooth sailing though; the recovery is still very fragile, and there are plenty of problems at home and abroad that can still derail the recovery.  Depending on which economist or politician or pundit you ask, there are a number of prescriptions for what to do in times like these, but there’s one thing that just about all these worthies agree on, namely that lowering marginal income tax rates (or at least not raising them) is vital.</p>
<p>But the fact that everybody believes something doesn’t make it true. So in this post, I’m going to show three graphs.  The first shows the length (in months) of every expansion since 1929.  The second looks at the annualized growth in real GDP per capita for each expansion period, and the third looks at the total growth rate in real GDP per capita over the length of the expansion period.  In each graph, recoveries are divided into three groups. <strong>Group 1</strong> is composed of expansions following recessions in which the top marginal tax rate was cut or for which the top marginal rate was cut within one year of the end of the recession.  <strong>Group 2</strong> is made up of recoveries for which the top marginal rate did not change during the recession or within a year of the end of the expansion.  <strong>Group 3</strong> has the expansions that suffered from tax hikes, during the recession itself and/or within a year of the end of recession.</p>
<p>A bit of housekeeping before I get started…  marginal tax rates are available from <a href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/histab23.xls">this fine table provided by the IRS&#8217; Statistics of Income</a>.  Data on the starting and ending dates for recessions comes from <a href="http://www.nber.org/cycles/cyclesmain.html">the NBER</a>, purveyors of recession and expansion dating for the U.S. economy. Real GDP per capita comes from <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/TableView.asp?SelectedTable=264&#038;Freq=Qtr&#038;FirstYear=2008&#038;LastYear=2010">the Bureau of Economic Analysis&#8217; National Income and Product Accounts Table 7.1</a>, updated on April of 2010.  Real GDP per capita is available annually from 1929 to 1946, and quarterly thereafter.</p>
<p>One more wee bit of housekeeping before we get to the good stuff…  for the sake of this post, I am going to assume that the real GDP per capita in any month is equal to the real GDP per capita for the quarter (or if prior to 1947, the year) in which it fits.  In other words, the real GDP per capita (in 2005 dollars) for the first quarter of 2008 is $43,997, and I am assuming that the real GDP per capita in any of the three months in that quarter (i.e., January, February, or March of 2008) is equal to $43,997.  That assumption shouldn’t cause any major changes in the results and it will keep me from having to go off on tangents about how the data was smoothed.</p>
<p>With that, here we go.  The first shows the length of each expansion, in months.</p>
<p>Notice… the expansions that follow tax cuts (either during the recession itself or at the start of the recovery) have tended to be the shortest ones in our sample.  And short expansions are definitely not a good thing; we’re all better off with expansions that go on for a while.  <br />What about the speed of the expansion?  The annualized growth (i.e., the speed per month) of real GDP per capita for each expansion since 1929 is shown below.  </p>
<p>This graph also does not appear to mesh with popular wisdom (not to mention accepted economic theory) in America today.  In general, when tax cuts occurred during or just after a recession, the resulting expansion has been slower than when the tax rates are kept unchanged.  Expansions associated with early tax hikes are the fastest of all.<br />Which leads us to the overall growth of the economy during the entire length of each expansion, which is shown in the next graph.</p>
<p>Once again, the theoretical benefits of a tax cut do not seem to match what the data shows, which is that least impressive expansions are those that follow decreases in marginal income tax rates (either during the recession itself or at the start of the recession). </p>
<p>So where does this leave us?  Well, simply put, the data and the theory/popular wisdom do not agree.  Going as far back as there is official data on economic growth, what we find is that expansions associated with reductions in the top marginal income tax rate have been shorter and slower than expansions that did not involve tax cuts.   Which means, simply put, that the theory is probably wrong, and we as a nation continue to buy into it at our detriment.  </p>

<p>From offshore accounts of individuals to transfer pricing scams of corporations<br />Michigan&#8217;s Levin says the next big thing for the government to focus on, now that the offshore accounting schemes of individual taxpayers have gotten its full attention, should be the corporate transfer pricing game.</p>
<p>What happens in transfer pricing?  Corporations in the US, for example, may develop a new drug and take out a patent on that drug.  If the patent is used in the US and the drug is manufactured here, the corporation will owe US income tax on its profits.  That tax is at a 35% statutory rate, but corporations don&#8217;t usually end up paying anything near the statutory rate on their economic profits&#8211;their effective rates are considerably lower, with many of the large US corporations paying no federal income tax whatsoever, from a combination of accelerated depreciation, loss deduction carryovers, and other &#8220;tax expenditures&#8221; that act to reduce their taxes (such as the many items in the Code that reduce taxes on Big Oil companies that extract natural resources&#8211;at great cost to our environment and coastal beauty, as it turns out).</p>
<p>One of the things multinational corporations do to lower their taxes even further is to shift income offshore.  Perhaps they have a reinsurance subsidiary, so they pay reinsurance premiums to that subsidiary and shift their actual insurance offshore.  Frequently, the companies that profits are shifted to have almost no employees.  They mail be just a mailbox conduit in the Netherlands or the Cayman Islands, where thousands of corporations are &#8220;located&#8221; in a single four-story building.  The tax code has a provision that is intended to empower the IRS to fight such manipulation of income.  It&#8217;s called the &#8220;transfer pricing&#8221; provision in section 482, which says that items of deduction, income, credit are supposed to &#8220;clearly reflect income&#8221;&#8211;meaning that taxable income should be related to economic income, except for provisions clearly intended to provide a special benefit (such as subsidies for corporations that Congress has built into the code, like accelerated depreciation and bonus depreciation).<br /><a name="more"></a><br />But policing transfer pricing is not easy.  It involves detailed facts and circumstances, takes inordinate time, and must ultimately be tried before courts that have been packed by GOP presidents with business-friendly judges, most of whom over the last thirty years have also enjoyed &#8220;educational&#8221; seminars in Chicago school-style economics funded by the Olin Foundation and sponsored by George Mason law school with the intent of influencing judges&#8217; decision-making in favor of the now-discredited &#8220;free market&#8221; thinking of Milton Friedman.</p>
<p>Accordingly, a number of tax and business experts have suggested that Congress should scrap the fact-intensive analysis required under current transfer pricing theory for a formulaic approach that would allot a percentage of a company&#8217;s profits to the US based on the number of employees, facilities and revenues in the US compared to elsewhere.  That sounds like a good idea to me&#8211;less audit time required, more objective, and less easily manipulated for the benefit of the corporate taxpayer.  As those who&#8217;ve read much of my scholarly work will recognize, I have long argued that the ability of a taxpayer to manipulate the income reported to the IRS Is problematic, raising questions of fairness and efficiency and administrability, all of which are important for tax policy considerations.</p>
<p>Bloomberg.com has an article today on the transfer pricing issue, written by a former Wall Street Journal reporter who knows the beat well.  I commend it to you for a view of the problem faced by the Congress and IRS as any attempt to crack down on transfer pricing scams gets underway.  It describes the &#8220;double Irish&#8221;.  And I have to admit, this was a ruse known widely to Wall Street law firms when I was there in the late 1990s and early 2000s.  Have a company in Ireland, have it paid by a company in the Netherlands (which is just a conduit&#8211;no real company) in order to get the inter -EU<br /> protection from withholding, have that Netherlands company paid by a company in one of the Island tax havens (Caymans, Bermuda).  Behold! Lots of income leaves the US tax rolls, and doesn&#8217;t get taxed anywhere else.
