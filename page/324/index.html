<p>Isaac Newton inspired many people to try to be the Newton of various fields.  Unfortunately many tried the shortcut of using the same words as Newton but changing their meanings.  This meant that those words had high status, because of Newton, but nothing to do with Newton&#8217;s success in fitting facts.  One such word is still doing damage.  It is &#8220;friction&#8221; and it is used as a general argument that empirical rejection is not a big problem for a theory.  My thoughts after the jump.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Isaac Newton presented four simple equations (three laws of motion plus his law of gravity) which made it possible to predict where the planets would be to well within a small fraction of measurement error. He seems to have believed that each equation was just plain true. Certainly after 2 centuries almost all physicists believed that.</p>
<p>To get from the 4 hypotheses of interest to testable predictions, two auxiliary hypotheses were needed &#8212; that no force but gravity affects the location of the planets and that the Sun and the planets are rigid spheres. These are good approximations and, as far as I know, they haven&#8217;t been disproven by observations of the locations of planets.</p>
<p>Newton hypothesized that the four equations were true natural laws. Clearly the two auxiliary hypotheses were not true statements about planet Earth. Newton hypothesized another force which he called friction. We would now consider friction one of the effects of the electromagnetic force. </p>
<p>Newton inspired many people to try to be the Newton of this that or the other field of inquiry. Unfortunately, they tended to try to do this by keeping the form of Newton&#8217;s work and changing the substance. Hence we have von Clausewitz advising that one strike at &#8220;the center of mass&#8221; of the adversary and Rousseau talking about &#8220;solidarity&#8221; and assuming that solidal polities act like solid bodies. The same words were used with different meanings based on trust in their magical powers. Sometimes, this was reckless but fruitful.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, one of the magical words was friction. In the Principia, the Latin word appears roughly in the context of a confession that what was written so far is clearly inconsistent with masses of easily available data. Newton wrote something along the lines of, that&#8217;s because I left out friction, nonetheless the chapters on motion without friction were useful. </p>
<p>Thus the magical power of &#8220;friction&#8221; was its ability to make refutation of hypotheses not matter at all, because models which were wildly inconsistent with the data might be like the earlier chapters of the Principia. Granting a word power over our minds is always a mistake and this was a very serious mistake whose damaging consequences still harm economic research (which is getting much better very quickly thank you (no thanks to me)). </p>
<p>However, note two things. Friction doesn&#8217;t appear in the laws of motion. The first law describes motion with no forces and hence neither friction nor gravity. The second and third describe motion with forces including gravity friction and presumably other forces. Newton&#8217;s law of gravity does not assert that there is no other force. In Newton&#8217;s work on the solar system, there was a clear distinction between the hypotheses of interest and the two auxiliary hypotheses added to get testable implications.</p>
<p>Also the testable implications were accurate to well within measurement error. <br />Better measurements have since been made and Newton&#8217;s law of gravity and f=ma are both known to be false. Newton merely asserted that, since we have excellent reason to believe the 4 equations apply out there (we now know they don&#8217;t) we should hypothesize that they apply down here too. </p>
<p>The Newton&#8217;s of this that and the other thing don&#8217;t have any example of their model without &#8220;friction&#8221; working. The magic word &#8220;friction&#8221; is invoked the instant the theory confronts any data at all.</p>
<p>Now I think the real lesson is that if one takes a true statement and changes the meanings of the words, one is likely to get a false statement, that words don&#8217;t have magical powers and that the forms of theoretical physics do not have value if it is separated from the substance. But the magic word &#8220;friction&#8221; has done more damage than the others and it&#8217;s past time to insist that people rephrase arguments without using it before they are taken seriously.</p>

<p><a href="http://europe.theoildrum.com/node/6418#more">The Oil Drum&#8217;s Jerome a Paris</a> writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Bloomberg has a somewhat <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601109&#038;sid=aGDZMpv5Y9Vo&#038;pos=13">confusing article</a> about the newest complaint about wind power, but the gist of it is that wind power is an issue for the industry because it brings their revenues down:</p>
<p><em>After years of getting government incentives to install windmills, operators in Europe may have become their own worst enemy, reducing the total price paid for electricity in Germany, Europe’s biggest power market, by as much as 5 billion euros some years, according to a study this week by Poeyry, a Helsinki-based industry consultant</em>.</p>
<p>Implicit in the article, and the headline (which focuses on lower revenues for RWE) is the worry that wind power will bring down the stock market value of the big utilities &#8211; which is what the readers of Bloomberg et al. care about.</p>
<p>But despite the generally negative tone of the article, it&#8217;s actually a useful one, because it brings out in the open a key bit of information: wind power actually brings electricity prices down!</p>
<p><em>windmills (&#8230;) operators in Europe may have become their own worst enemy, reducing the total price paid for electricity in Germany, Europe’s biggest power market, by as much as 5 billion euros some years </em><br />[snip]<br /><em>The wind-energy boom in Europe and parts of Texas has begun to reduce bills for consumers. </em><br />[snip]<br /><em>Spanish power prices fell an annual 26 percent in the first quarter because of the surge in supplies from wind and hydroelectric production </em></p>
<p>This tidbit of information, which will hopefully begin to contradict the usual lies about the need for hefty subsidies for the wind sector, has been publicised by EWEA, the European Wind Energy Association in a report on the merit order effect (PDF). This is the name for what happens when you inject a lot of capital-intensive, low-marginal-cost supply into a marginalist price-setting market mechanism with low short term demand elasticity &#8211; or, in simpler words: when you have more wind, there is less need to pay to burn more gas to provide the requisite additional power at a given moment.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve long argued that this was one of the strongest arguments for wind (see my article on The cost of wind, the price of wind, the value of wind from last year), and I&#8217;ve pushed the EWEA people to use it more &#8211; so this study (which I was not involved in) is most welcome.</p>
<p>The key thing here is that we are beginning to unveil what I&#8217;ve labelled the dirty secret of wind: utilities don&#8217;t like wind not because it&#8217;s not competitive, but because it brings prices down for their existing assets, thus lowering their revenues and their profits&#8230;</p>
<p>Ironically, wind provides &#8220;utility-like&#8221; returns to investors, that is low, stable single-digit returns, as befits a regulated strategic infrastructure activity required for the common good&#8230;</p></blockquote>

<p>Deficit Commmission working groups&#8211;tax group, but no practicing or academic tax lawyer</p>
<p>One of the strange results of treatment of economists as central policymakers over the last four decades or so of the &#8220;Washington Consensus&#8221; and the dominance of Chicago School freshwater economists has been the distortion of policy making on taxes to favor economic arguments over fairness and statutory construction that results in a coherent Code.  You&#8217;d think that people would want a range of perspectives from tax academics and practitioners.  Many tax academics are in the &#8220;economic efficiency is the only measuring stick that matters for tax policy&#8221; camp, but many aren&#8217;t. (moi, for example.)  Including those broader perspectives might bring us more quickly to good tax policies and save us the waste of time from focussing solely on efficiency and growth arguments.  (There&#8217;s a lot of talk, for example, among tax efficiency academics about &#8220;progressive consumption taxes&#8221;, yet we all realize that it is unlikely that an efficient consumption tax will be enacted (it requires taxing borrowings, for example) and even more improbable that any consumption tax enacted would be progressive at the rates necessary to achieve real progressivity.  We&#8217;d be better off discussing how to improve the income tax to make it fairer and raise more revenues.)</p>
<p>Obama&#8217;s deficit commission appears to be following the trend of treating economists and businessmen (CEOs) and even union leaders as more appropriate to have input on tax issues than tax experts.  The tax working group of the deficit commission includes, according to BNA Daily Tax Realtime (May 4,2010): &#8220;Sen. Max Baucus (D-Mont.), Rep. Dave Camp (R-Mich.), Sen. Kent Conrad (D-N.D.), Sen. Judd Gregg (R-N.H.), Rep. Xavier Becerra (D-Calif.), Dave Cote, Sen. Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Sen. Richard Durbin (D-Ill.), Ann Fudge, and Andy Stern. Cote is president and CEO of manufacturer Honeywell, Fudge is the former chairman and CEO of Young and Rubicam Brands, and Stern is president of the Service Employees International Union.&#8221; BNA   </p>
<p>Of course, some of those politicians, like Baucus, serve on the tax writing committees (Finance in the Senate, and Ways and Means in the House).  But still, it would be nice to see a progressive tax academic invited to serve on this group&#8230;..</p>

<p>[edited to add link 5/4/10 at 3:12 pm]</p>
<p>The Washington Post has an interesting story on the bank lobby&#8217;s thinking about financial reform.  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/05/03/AR2010050304254_2.html">Klein, Lobbyists fret over legislation to reshape financial system</a>, Wash. Post, May 4, 2010.</p>
<p>Basically, the story line is this (with some added interpretive flourishes of my own, in italics).  </p>
<blockquote><p>Bank lobbyists didn&#8217;t like the House bill.  Too tough.  They expected the Senate bill to be better.  Sure, Dodd had a couple of provisions they didn&#8217;t like, but with Republicans Shelby and Corker making lots of noise about the need for bipartisanship and Dodd trying hard to get a bipartisan bill, there was pretty strong expectation that the bill that came out of that negotiation would be much more favorable to the bankers&#8217; positions.  But then something happened.  Senators started worrying about upcoming elections.</p></blockquote>
<p>(My goodness, what might ORDINARY VOTERS think if the senators don&#8217;t vote for tough regulation of the banks that caused the Great Recession and the bankers who flew through it with hardly a scrape, while ordinary Americans are suffering high unemployment, stifled dreams, and long-term fears about their financial security, while still paying exorbitant fees for everything provided by banks and getting loans, if at all, only by paying interest at quite a spread over the almost zero rate the bank has to pay to borrow from depositors or from the overly generous FED window.) </p>
<p>The bill made it out of committee with no amendments.  None.  It was a party line vote (GOP against) but all those expected GOP amendments didn&#8217;t materialize.  It just took 20 minutes to vote it out of committee and make it possible that there would be real floor debate.</p>
<p>And the lobbyists&#8217; response is this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Instead of getting the provisions the banks don&#8217;t like loosened, the Senators&#8217; thinking about upcoming elections has them adding tougher provisions.  Those provisions are likely to actually impact the banks&#8217; profits (their big business in derivatives and proprietary trading, most of it risky, a lot of it used to help banks or others evade regulatory requirements or avoid taxation through some kind of arbitrage) and their &#8220;global competitiveness&#8221;  and benefit to the American economy</p></blockquote>
<p>(Beale here&#8230;read this as &#8211;their ability to do all the risky stuff that big banks in other countries may still be able to do, and if you can&#8217;t be as risky as the next bank, you won&#8217;t make as much mone and, after all, what&#8217;s good for the big banks should be understood to be good for the American economy). <br /><a name="more"></a><br />So what&#8217;s the solution?  Why, the usual deal that lobbyists have been comfortable with over the last few decades&#8211;getting inside access to the men who have power to shape the bill in a back room somewhere (and letting them know that working for the lobbyists is their job, not paying attention to the ordinary people who put them in office).  Says one lobbyist interviewed by the Post:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve got to get this thing off the [Senate] floor and into a reasonable, behind the scenes&#8221; discussion, said one lobbyist. &#8220;Let&#8217;s have a few wise fathers sit around the table in some quiet room&#8221; and work out the details.</p></blockquote>
<p>Maybe, the lobbyists say, they&#8217;ll even have to accept a banker-unfriendly bill from the Senate, but they can work the Conference Committee when a few players from the House and Senate get together to iron out the differences between the two versions of financial reform&#8211;maybe even Barney Frank, who has been pretty critical of big banks lately (they seem to think that he can be influenced to be their best friend forever).  </p>
<p>And if not, then they&#8217;ve got full employment for the next ten years, as they work to persuade Congress to weaken whatever bill is passed (just as they did with the Glass-Steagall Act, where they wheedled and bargained to get exemptions and waivers and eroded the law until the Great Recession was the result).</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s going to be job employment for me for the next decade, undoing some of this stuff,&#8221; said one lobbyist&#8230;..</p></blockquote>
<p>Beale here:  Now folks, it&#8217;s pretty revealing when lobbyists have become so accustomed to their privileged access and backroom dealings with politicians &#8211;as went on in regards to Cheney&#8217;s energy discussions, and each of the Bush tax cuts drawn up by a secretive group of GOP without any sunlight (or bipartisansip), for example, and too much with the health care bill as well&#8211;that they don&#8217;t even bother to hide their scorn for the public&#8217;s views and their hopes for getting that back room deal to go their way.   No wonder Wall Street honchos have been so brazenly arrogant about their &#8220;entitlement&#8221; to bonuses, their rights to continue proprietary trading and hedge funds and derivatives desks&#8211;&#8220;doing God&#8217;s work&#8221; says Goldman CEO Blankfein&#8211;when they are merely running a casino market to strip as much gold off suckers as possible with their &#8220;financial innovations&#8221; like synthetic CDOs that made the market many times more volatile than &#8220;real&#8221; securitizations (which themselves were too easily done for our own good).</p>
<p>This is why I have long been worried about the &#8220;safe harbor&#8221; for mark-to-market rules for tax purposes under section 475, which lets banks use various types of financial statements to determine their &#8220;mark&#8221; that sets their income for tax purposes.  It is far too subject to manipulation, and what we have seen is that there are simply no voluntary curbs that will constrain bankers from taking high risks to get the results they want to get to make their own pocketbooks even fatter.</p>
<p>Accordingly, I&#8217;m convinced that tough financial reform needs to break up the big banks so that we don&#8217;t have any that are &#8220;too big to fail.&#8221;  Trying to maintain them big and then monitor the systemic risks they cause is a losing proposition, since their hubris and engineering smarts means they will always try to be one step ahead of regulators so they can make more money.  See, e.g., The Fourteenth Banker, Huffington Post, Apr. 13, 2010 (management banker at one of our megabanks admits to ethical crisis at banks and need to move proprietary trading so that banks get back to supporting America&#8217;s entrepreneurs).  The Senate should enact a bill with the Lincoln curbs on derivatives and a ban on proprietary trading for investment banks as well as the Kaufman limits on size.  Let the accounting rules fall where they may, by the way, with more, not less, emphasis on taking losses from disrupted markets into account and less, not more, emphasis on mark-to-model accounting.  Make bank regulatory decisions independently based on whatever criteria are important to that. All the other measures&#8211;capital reserves, liability limits, consumer protection agency with independent enforcement powers, a systemic review council&#8211;are important, but without those real teeth they won&#8217;t be enough to curb the banks&#8217; appetite for outsize bonuses and the risk that they encourage.</p>

                                <p>By Daniel Becker (DOLB)</p>
<p>Following up on <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/05/progressives-views-on-supply.html">Robert&#8217;s post</a> which at it&#8217;s core is discussing the article: <a href="http://econjwatch.org/articles/economic-enlightenment-in-relation-to-college-going-ideology-and-other-variables-a-zogby-survey-of-americans">Economic Enlightenment in Relations to College-going&#8230;.</a></p>
<p>I find it interesting (not alarming at all, at least not regarding the data) that the following combination is the ultimate economically enlightened member of society if you are: </p>
<blockquote><p>very likely to vote next time, voted for McCain, libertarian, white, not Hispanic/Latino, a suburbanite, atheist/realist/humanist, born again, attend church multi times/ week, non union, married, consider America you residence, are military (or family in military), NASCAR fan, think your in the investor class, shop every week at Walmart, earn over $100K/yr, male.</p></blockquote>
<p>One more thing based on their figure 2 chart: high school education or less. That group of educated had the highest economic enlightenment score.  That group of educated had the highest economic enlightenment score. There is a bit of concern with this data piece considering two of their sited points:</p>
<blockquote><p>The caveat that we see as most significant as pertains to the education variable is that the survey procedure likely tended to discourage low-IQ individuals from participation, thus artificially raising the observed economic enlightenment scores of the less educated groups&#8230; </p></blockquote>
<p>And: <br />
<blockquote>Meanwhile, Caplan and Miller (2006)&#8230;find that “the estimated effect of education sharply falls after controlling for IQ. In fact, education is driven down to second place, and IQ replaces it at the top of the list of variables that make people ‘think like economists.’”</p></blockquote>
<p>Do I dare suggest that they are finding that the most economically enlightened are the smartest people who never finished high school? You know, when I asked 2 years ago if we could try a different school of economic&#8217;s I did not realize the one we needed was the non-schooled school. </p>
<p>Interestingly enough, you are most unenlightened if you are </p>
<blockquote><p>progressive and college educated along with being: not likely to vote, voted green party, identify Green, African American, Hispanic/Latino, large city dweller, no religious affiliation, not born again and never attend church, union, civil union/domestic partner, consider your home the planet earth (no other planet offered), not military, not a fan of NASCAR (should have asked about horse racing), not of the investor class, never shop at Walmart (guess the other big boxes don&#8217;t count), $25K or less/yr (and they don&#8217;t shop at Walmart?), female.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is an amazing study. It managed to show that there are two groups of people in this nation whose thinking regarding money is totally reflective of the common cliche&#8217;s heard during the political season (which is a season with no ends) and are often applied slanderously. They have proven that the cliche&#8217;s are true!  But, then why would I expect anything else from this considering the following commentary from their “scholarly” piece of work: </p>
<blockquote><p>At least since the days of Frédéric Bastiat, many have said that people of the left often trail behind in incorporating basic economic insight into their aesthetics, morals, and politics. We put much stock in Hayek’s theory (Hayek 1978, 1979, 1988) that the social-democratic ethos is an atavistic reassertion of the ethos and mentality of the primordial paleolithic band, a mentality resistant to ideas of spontaneous order and disjointed knowledge. Our findings support such a claim,</p></blockquote>
<p>Ok, this economic ignoramus needs to go to his flower shop now. God help me if it goes under. I should have never gone to college. It&#8217;s my mom&#8217;s fault too.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t agree with <a href="http://volokh.com/2010/05/06/the-further-left-you-are-the-less-you-know-about-economicsr/">the title of this post</a> and one sentence, but the rest of the post is reasonable, and the data it discusses are very alarming.</p>
<p>Todd Zywicki wrote</p>
<blockquote><p>Some of the results in this new article by Zeljka Buturovic and Dan Klein in Econ Journal Watch (a peer-reviewed journal of economics) are startling:</p>
<blockquote><p>67% of self-described Progressives believe that restrictions on housing development (i.e., regulations that reduce the supply of housing) do not make housing less affordable. </p>
<p>51% believe that mandatory licensing of professionals (i.e., reducing the supply of professionals) doesn’t increase the cost of professional services. </p>
<p>Perhaps most amazing, 79% of self-described Progressive believe that rent control (i.e., price controls) does not lead to housing shortages. <br />Note that the questions here are not whether the benefits of these policies might outweigh the costs, but the basic economic effects of these policies.</p></blockquote>
<p>Those identifying as “libertarian” and “very conservative” were the most knowledgeable about basic economics.  Those identifying as “Progressive” and “Liberal” were the worst.</p>
<p>It would be hard to find a set of propositions that would meet with such a degree of consensus among economists to rival these propositions–which boils down to supply restrictions raise prices and price controls create shortages. </p></blockquote>
<p>The sentence with which I disagree is the one that ends &#8220;basic economics.&#8221;  In that sentence and the title, it is assumed that it is only basic economics if almost all economists agree.  This gives the large group of reality denying free market fanatic economists a veto.  </p>
<p>More thoughts after the jump</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>I think these results are part of a pattern in which people refuse to concede anything anything at all to ideological opponents when polled.  People say a statement is false to express their opposition to arguments which begin with that statement.  That is, if the poll doesn&#8217;t allow people to answer &#8220;yes, but &#8230;&#8221; they answer &#8220;no&#8221;.  To put it a bit more harshly, people will often claim that a statement is false if they don&#8217;t agree with the conclusions of the policy makers who most enthusiastically make that statement.</p>
<p>Via <a href="http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/archives/2010/05/endgame-228.php">Matthew Yglesias</a> who wins an <a href="http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/awards.html">Yglesias award </a>for intellectual integrity.</p>
<p>Now the examples present me with a bit of a challenge.  I have claimed that I can get any result I want out of an economic model in which people are rational.  I will try in these cases, but first stress I am not criticizing Zywicki&#8217;s post.  The questions don&#8217;t include qualifiers as in &#8220;must in all imaginable worlds&#8221;  They refer to actual policies in the real world.  Zywicki does not rely on simple theory to argue that progressives are wrong.  He mentions extensive empirical evidence (I didn&#8217;t quote quite the whole post as that wouldn&#8217;t be fair use).</p>
<p>So lets see if I can make economic theory jump through those hoops.  The rest of this post is not at all serious and mostly for my amusement.</p>
<p>1) Restrictions on housing</p>
<p>The claim includes an editorial comment by Todd Zywicki.  I&#8217;m sure this wasn&#8217;t part of the question asked of progressives and others, still I accept it as part of the challenge.  So let&#8217;s see.  OK sure.  How about this restriction of housing construction &#8212; minimum density requirements.  Housing must be built so that there is *at least* N independent residences per acre.  There is a maximum normal number of rooms and normal number of square feet in a residence corresponding to minimum crowding requirements times 4 people per household.  The fraction of residences in any developement of N or more houses larger than this maximum normal size, must be no greater than twice the fraction of households with more than 5 members.  </p>
<p>I mean basically take the rules which make housing less affordable and turn them on their heads.  A good libertarian will know that only bad things can come from restrictions on building, but an open minded economist can see how preventing builders from building large houses for rich people tends to reduce the price of land and make housing cheaper for the non rich.</p>
<p>If I can&#8217;t do this one, Atrios sure can.</p>
<p>2) Mandatory licensing.  </p>
<p>OK first assume that people just won&#8217;t go to a professional who is not certified in some way &#8212; say the profession is brain surgery.  This means that the alternatives are a standardized licensing procedure or some other screen.  My claim will be that, in some cases, standard legally mandated procedures allow freer entry than the feasible alternative.  What would it be ?  One possibility is that people only go to a brain surgeon who has a long record of success (as attending surgeon) so long as there are any such brain surgeons.  The first brain surgeon in history can get started, but once the very first co-hort build up their record, no entry at all is possible until they simultaneously retire.  The result is extremely limited supply.</p>
<p>Alternatively, a credible mandatory test can be applied to all surgeons and people find that *some* newly trained surgeons are just as good as the old experts.  The old experts would never voluntarily take this test, since unless and until others prove they are as good, the old experts can exclude new entrants.  This means that there is no point in taking the test unless enough surgeons have taken the test that performance as a function of score can be estimated.  This means that if some new entrants deviate from the Nash equilibrium and take the test they have wasted their effort.  </p>
<p>The informal reputational equilibrium (in a world in which voluntary test participation is possible) is more restrictive than the system with mandatory testing, because people demand the best and have perfectly rational greater faith in a proven record than in a new test.   </p>
<p>To get even harder core about rational expectations and Nash equilibrium assume that there are a variety of potential tests (provided by nature in the model) and only by making brain surgeons with proven records take them can one tell which test is correlated with good results in actual surgical practice (this is I can make a model of rational learning a model of Nash equilibrium by saying something is stochastic and even people who know it&#8217;s distribution must learn its realization).</p>
<p>3. rent control.  This is easy.  There is imperfect competition in the supply of rental housing.  As a minimum wage law can cause increased employment with monopsony in the labor market, a maximum rent law can cause increased supply of rental housing.</p>
<p>I suspect a few years ago, the corresponding blog post would have noted that progressives don&#8217;t believe that minimum wage laws cause reduced employment and that almost all economists agree that it does.  That was true of almost all economists a while ago, but isn&#8217;t any more.</p>
<p>update:  really in the weeds here, but I was thinking about my argument that mandatory licensing can increase supply of professionals.  That argument was taken seriously once by John Stuart Mill in &#8220;On Liberty&#8221; which should be the libertarian bible.  OK so Mill was a progressive and a liberal, but he was a classical liberal and believed in free markets in the same way he believed in free speech.  </p>
<p>He also was wildly wildly enthusiastic about written exams.  He wanted access to all sorts of positions to depend on the score on written exams.  His aim was not to restrain entry and drive up the return to those positions.  It was the opposite.  He believed, based on massive empirical evidence, that the alternative to admission based on writen exams was admission based on belonging to the right social class.  </p>
<p>His aim was to make entry criteria objective and anonymous (I don&#8217;t think he came up with the idea of having the exams identified only by a number and graded double blind but he was getting there).  His advice was followed.  In the event, the mandatory exams were often pretty pointless in themselves (having a lot to do with Latin and such).  The point was that the mechanical admissions process was less closed than the alternative.  </p>
<p>I just add that if customers are not willing to go to Joe&#8217;s discount brain surgery, that the same reasoning applies to certification of self employed professionals.  </p>
<p>Recall, there is certification, because consumers prefer there to be certification.  The mandatory licensing procedure selects the competent, and is less exclusive than any available alternative.  I think this argument is actually not just economic theory but a reasonable description of a possible alternative world.  </p>
<p>I am also sure that really existing mandatory licensing requirements generally drive professional incomes up, but that&#8217;s because of the empirical evidence and not because &#8220;economic theory&#8221; implies that or anything.</p>

<blockquote><p>This is why the leak in the Gulf may make it less likely that Mr Obama will get the environmental legislation he desires. Any bill with the slightest austerity or self-sacrifice has an uphill climb, particularly in this economy. Voters will accept the “new” environmentalism (focused on climate change) only as long as it is free. The temptation has been to pay for the new environmentalism by gutting the old environmentalism (focused on visible pollution). </p>
<p>Here the energy industry in recent decades offers certain parallels to the finance industry. Structured finance on the one hand, a green economy on the other – both innovations involve trade-offs. But the modern voter, like the modern consumer and the modern investor, is unsatisfied with trade-offs. He wants windfalls.</p>
<p>So innovations are presented as pure gains. This is done by rounding risk down, by assuming that hitherto rare events – a housing crash on the one hand, a drilling leak on the other – are impossible. You pay for the new efficiencies by zeroing out protections from old-fashioned risks. The risk of a spill is taken off balance sheet. Until the inevitable screw-up, it looks like a bonanza attained through the brilliance of our leaders. </p>
<p>At a Senate hearing in November, Mary Landrieu, the Democratic senator from Louisiana, said we had to measure the dangers of oil spills against the gains from oil: victory in the second world war, the industrial revolution, the automobile. Ms Landrieu is the largest recipient in Congress of donations from BP and its employees (just as Mr Obama is the largest recipient among all US politicians), so one might take her views with a grain of salt. She has been mocked this week. But her larger point bears listening to. After so many forests have been felled and hillocks dynamited to serve the US addiction to oil and automobiles, it would be unwise to think that the contamination of a few salt marshes is going to alter energy policy in the long term.</p></blockquote>

<p>I found <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2010/05/on-the-fat-fingered-trade-and-market-freakout.html?utm_source=feedburner&#038;utm_medium=feed&#038;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+NakedCapitalism+%28naked+capitalism%29">this comment by Yves Smith</a> &#8211; which is not the main point of her post by the way &#8211; to be very good.</p>
<blockquote><p>But another side effect of today’s equity market gyrations is further distrust in the markets, particularly by retail buyers. I am told that various retail trading platforms were simply not operating during the acute downdraft and rebound. I couldn’t access hoi polloi Bloomberg news or data pages then either. The idea that the pros could trade (even if a lot of those trades are cancelled) while the little guy was shut out reinforces the perception that the markets are treacherous and the odds are stacked in favor of the big players (even though we all understand that, it isn’t supposed to be this blatant).</p></blockquote>
<p>Frankly, I&#8217;m just a little guy who saved a bit of money over the past few years, and I&#8217;ve been trying very hard to put those savings in places unrelated to the market because I do believe the market is gamed against ordinary people.  Not that I can avoid it completely &#8211; this is the era of the  401(k) after all.  Nevertheless, Thursday&#8217;s events are just going to lead me to redouble my efforts to find places away from the financial markets to put money.</p>

                                <p>It is nice to finally report that the employment report was encouraging as nonfarm payrolls rose some 290,000 in April.  Even if the 66,000 temporary government employment for the census are excluded the job gains were significant.<br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/S-QYNBZx5LI/AAAAAAAABIY/sSo26LDLWGs/s1600/Clipboard02.bmp"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/S-QYNBZx5LI/AAAAAAAABIY/sSo26LDLWGs/s320/Clipboard02.bmp" alt="" border="0"></a><br />Even the increase in the unemployment rate to 9.9% was actually a positive as it largely reflected individuals who had earlier dropped out of the labor market thinking things had improved enough that they resumed their job search.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/S-QYgfVqKeI/AAAAAAAABIo/MGgAVinuGu8/s1600/Clipboard04.bmp"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/S-QYgfVqKeI/AAAAAAAABIo/MGgAVinuGu8/s320/Clipboard04.bmp" alt="" border="0"></a><br />Moreover, the index of aggregate hours work rose significantly and is up 1.8% from its October bottom.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/S-QYXYzgQWI/AAAAAAAABIg/8Go25UhLAUg/s1600/Clipboard03.bmp"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/S-QYXYzgQWI/AAAAAAAABIg/8Go25UhLAUg/s320/Clipboard03.bmp" alt="" border="0"></a>Because of the rise in hours worked average weekly earnings are also rising nicely.  But the increase in weekly earnings is almost all due to the increase in hours worked as average hourly earnings growth is still slowing.  Of course this has positive implications for lower inflation and means that the Fed does not need to be in a hurry to tighten.  Inflation does not appear to be a significant threat and the situation in Greece and other European debtors has significant deflationary implications.</p>
