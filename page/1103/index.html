                                                                    </div>

                                <p>As the days have gone by since the election, I’m increasingly coming to the conclusion that a major handicap for the Democratic party in the past few elections has been that Republicans are seen to be &#8220;standing for something,&#8221; while Democrats are seen to either just be non-Republicans or to simply have a laundry list of specific policy proposals that may or may not have anything to do with each other.  Rightly or wrongly, Republicans are seen as having a coherent vision for how they want to shape policy; Democrats are immersed in policy details. Bush was perceived to be principled; Kerry was seen by most people (on both the left and the right) as simply &#8220;not Bush.&#8221;</p>
<p>Furthermore, I think that this election demonstrated conclusively (to me, anyway) that a large number of swing voters don’t make their decisions based on specific policies, but instead decide how to vote based on broader, more intangible themes.  When asked to identify their views on specific policies, large majorities of voters typically <a href="http://www.ospolitics.org/usa/archives/2003/10/13/the_true_v.php">agree with the Democratic position</a> rather than the Republican.  For example, the majority of voters thought that the <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2004/04/15/news/economy/election_moneypoll/">deficit should be reduced</a> before tax cuts were enacted; most voters wanted to see the <a href="http://www.starbanner.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20040724/NEWS/207240355/1008/OPINION">assault-weapons ban extended</a>; most voters want abortion to <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/01/20/health/main537243.shtml">remain safe and legal</a>; a recent survey showed that even self-identified Bush supporters generally preferred Kerry’s foreign policy positions to Bush’s position on most specific <a href="http://www.pipa.org/OnlineReports/Pres_Election_04/Report09_29_04.pdf">foreign-policy issues</a>; and even in last week&#8217;s &#8220;anti-gay&#8221; election, exit polls show that most voters believed that homosexual couples should be entitled to <a href="http://www.gay.com/news/article.html?2004/11/03/3">civil unions or marriage</a>.</p>
<p>Yet an enormous (and probably increasing) number of voters regularly choose to support Republicans in elections despite the fact that they disagree with them on most specific policies.  Why? Because voters’ general sense of what they think Republicans generally fight for trumps the details of what voters know or don&#8217;t know about their specific policies.  Think about it: the overwhelming perception is still that the Republican Party is the party of small government, respect for free markets, and strong national defense. The reality that current Republican policy has dramatically increased in the size and scope of government, repeatedly corrupted the functioning of free markets, and dangerously overstretched and weakened our military is irrelevant.</p>
<p>I would argue that this fundamental trust in underlying Republican principles has its roots in the fact that those principles have been ceaselessly and successfully sold as being &#8220;moral.&#8221;  Since they spring from inherently moral principles, voters assume that specific Republican policies will generally tend to be inherently good as well.  </p>
<p>For 25 years there has been a consistent stream of intellectual and media output from the right explaining that conservative principles are moral, and (more subtly) that liberal principles are immoral.  The result is that the number of individuals who identify themselves as conservative has steadily increased, while the number of people who identify themselves as liberal has steadily declined.  Many (most?) people now agree with conservatives that letting people pay less of their hard-earned income in taxes is not just better, but is <em>morally superior</em> to paying high taxes; that being strong and independent in foreign policy is <em>morally superior</em> to relying on allies for international assistance; and that letting individuals succeed or fail based on their own work and initiative is <em>morally superior</em> to allowing individuals to earn government assistance even if they do nothing to deserve it.</p>
<p>It is time for the left to counter.  Democrats must work on articulating and publicizing the coherent worldview that underlies liberalism.  And to really provide an effective counterweight to conservative intellectual thought, liberals must take this one step further: they must articulate the deeply principled, deeply moral underpinnings of their beliefs.</p>
<p>Put another way, Democrats need to explain what lies deep, deep down in their hearts: why do Democrats want to make the policy changes that they talk about in the first place?  What are the overarching principles that motivate people like Al Gore, John Kerry, or Barack Obama?  For Democrats, what is the whole point of government power?  Most voters have no idea.  Democrats need to make clear that they believe deeply in their policy positions for fundamental reasons of principle, and that those principles are morally good.</p>
<p>I don’t think that it’s a coincidence that Jimmy Carter is the only Democratic presidential candidate to receive 50% of the vote in the past ten elections.  He has always been recognized as being unusual in the depth of his convictions and principles, and even more unusual (especially for a Democrat) because he has never shied away from talking about the morality of those principles.  For some reason, ever since JFK most Democratic politicians have shied away from discussing morality and why the principles of liberalism are fundamentally good.  It’s time for that to change.</p>
<p>I’m convinced that Democrats will not fundamentally alter their inability to reach a majority of voters by tweaking policy positions on one or two key issues, or by finding just the right candidates that appeal to one or two additional demographic groups.  Bill Clinton was an example of both of these band-aid approaches, but he did not arrest (and arguably hastened) the steady rightward trend in elections.  Instead, the left needs to devote the coming years to publicly articulating the underlying morality of liberalism, and putting forward a moral world-view that can compete with the conservative one that Republicans have been incessantly advocating for a quarter century. </p>
<p>If the left is willing to make it, the moral case for being liberal is strong.  Being liberal means having compassion for all people – including and perhaps especially those who cannot fight for themselves.  It means recognizing that human society depends fundamentally on the willingness of people to cooperate, and work together, and help each other in times of difficulty.  It means having automatic and unwavering respect and tolerance for the opinions and beliefs of others.  It means being unflinchingly responsible about what we pass on to our children and to future generations, even if it makes things more difficult for us personally.  Most generally, it means putting the concern for the well-being of others on equal footing with the concern for oneself.  This is a good, and just, and morally strong belief, deeply grounded in both religious and secular morality, and should be trumpeted by the left instead of glossed over.</p>
<p>To my knowledge, in the past several years only one nationally prominent Democrat has successfully articulated some of these deep underlying principles: Barack Obama.  In fact, I think that’s exactly why so many Democrats found Obama’s speech at the DNC so inspiring and exciting – he dared to assert that the basic moral values that make a person liberal are fundamentally <em>right</em>.  And while I think that in the future Democratic candidates should be even more explicit in highlighting the fundamental morality of the liberal worldview, <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/politicselections/nation/president/2004-07-27-obama-speech-text_x.htm">Obama’s words</a> were exactly right:</p>
<blockquote><p>[I]t&#8217;s not enough for just some of us to prosper. For alongside our famous individualism, there&#8217;s another ingredient in the American saga. A belief that we are connected as one people. If there&#8217;s a child on the south side of Chicago who can&#8217;t read, that matters to me, even if it&#8217;s not my child. If there&#8217;s a senior citizen somewhere who can&#8217;t pay for her prescription and has to choose between medicine and the rent, that makes my life poorer, even if it&#8217;s not my grandmother. If there&#8217;s an Arab American family being rounded up without benefit of an attorney or due process, that threatens my civil liberties. It&#8217;s that fundamental belief — I am my brother&#8217;s keeper, I am my sister&#8217;s keeper — that makes this country work. It&#8217;s what allows us to pursue our individual dreams, yet still come together as a single American family. &#8220;E pluribus unum.&#8221; Out of many, one.</p></blockquote>
<p>These are the words, and this is the attitude of a Democrat who understands that there is a deeply moral case to be made for being liberal – a case that the left has not consistently made in nearly a half century.  And this is exactly what the left needs to articulate, high and low, far and wide, from millions of different voices, from now into the future.</p>

                            </p>
                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>I used to think CNN’s Lou Dobbs – the Bill O’Reilly of Mercantilism – was as awful as it gets as far as business or economics commentary.  His tirades against free trade have gotten so bad that I can no longer watch his show.  But I do wake up Saturday mornings to CNN’s <em>On The Story</em>, which is the all gals team with some of the reporters being rather good – especially when they invite Christiane Amanpour on their show.  However, Kathleen Hayes has yet to do a report that proves to that she learned any economics even if she supposedly got a masters degree from Stanford.  </p>
<p>Yesterday’s <a href="http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0411/06/tt.01.html">show</a> had two incredibly low points.  The first had to do with the Social Security debate:</p>
<blockquote><p>CROWLEY: But don&#8217;t even conservative investments beat what &#8212; the Social Security gain? I mean, isn&#8217;t &#8212; hasn&#8217;t that always been &#8212; the selling point was even if you invest conservatively&#8230;<br />
<br />HAYS: In government bonds, for example&#8230;But the other question is a big picture question. It&#8217;s going to cost money to do this, as you point out. Because if I am paying taxes to the government, my Social Security tax, and now I can take some of that tax and invest it, that&#8217;s money that&#8217;s not going into the general revenues, which is what all Social Security goes to and it gets paid out.</p></blockquote>
<p>Candy Crowley’s praise of the Bush plan is just silly for a simple reason.  The Trust Fund already puts the reserves into government bonds so if individuals do the same thing, how does Ms. Hays think the return on government bonds is higher than the return on government bonds?  Of course, what she did was to change the subject.  </p>
<p>Let me take one shot at this and then give a hat tip to privatization proponent and Ricardian Equivalence reviving Robert Barro who had <a href="http://post.economics.harvard.edu/faculty/barro/bw/bw00_07_03.pdf">this</a> rather honest refutation of the return argument.  Note to Ms. Hays, Social Security contributions go to the Trust Fund not to the General Fund, but let’s concede that the unified deficit will temporarily look larger if we move to partial privatization.  But would not Dr. Barro argue that reducing contributions and benefits by the same amounts in present value terms (assuming this is what Bush intends to do) would have no effect on the long-run solvency of either the Trust Fund or the General Fund?</p>
<p>But maybe I expect too much of Ms. Hays given an earlier discussion of the jobs report.  As the ladies were gushing how strong the economy was in light of the October increase in employment, I could only imagine that your internet savvy eight-year old was finding table B-1 <a href="http://www.bls.gov/webapps/legacy/cesbtab1.htm">here</a> and noticing employment in October (call this B) was 132.017 million versus employment in January 2001 was 132.388 million (call this A).  So Ms. Hays said:</p>
<blockquote><p>HAYS: Well, let me &#8211; yes, because I did the math yesterday. If you go from January 2001 to October 2004, he is still down 371,000 jobs. I worked through this with somebody at the Labor Department.</p></blockquote>
<p>She needed to bother some staff economist at BLS to help here do A minus B?  I’m sure your eight-year old did this without bothering anyone.  If she needs help with this, why does CNN have her opining on something complex like the Social Security issue?</p>
<p>I used to question why any sane person would bother with the hacks at FNC such as Neil Cavuto.  Given CNN’s business correspondents are Lou Dobbs and Kathleen Hays, I think I just answered my own question.<br /></p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Tim Russert invites Karl Rove on <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6430019">Meet The Press</a> and asks him about the uniter not a divider issue and Rove replies:</p>
<blockquote><p>I remember well after 9/11 sitting with the president and a leader of the Democratic Party talking about the economic stimulus package.  The president said, &#8220;Look, our economy&#8217;s been hit hard on 9/11.  We need to do something to jump start our economy.  You know, my advisors at the Council of Economic Advisors tell me the number one thing we can do to jump start the economy is A.&#8221;  And this Democrat leader said, &#8220;Well, Mr. President, I can&#8217;t get the votes for A, but I can get the votes for B.&#8221;  And the president said&#8211;listened to him and several days later laid out his package and included as one of the principle elements of it B.  And that Democrat leader immediately went out and criticized it. </p></blockquote>
<p>Even though Rove did not tell us what A or B were or who this leader allegedly was, I’m glad he reminded us of what I see as one of Bush’s most incredible failures during the first term.  Back in October 2001, there was a consensus among Senate moderates in both the Democratic Party and the GOP that we should tell Wall Street that we were serious about long-term fiscal responsibility also go for more high bang-for-the-buck short-term stimulus.  This general type of policy package was the reverse of the long-term fiscal recklessness cum little short-term demand impact policies of Lawrence Lindsey and Bill Thomas over at the House Ways and Means Committee. Many economists praised this general type of policy and hoped the efforts of Charles Rangel could get Bill Thomas to join with the bipartisan spirit among the Senate moderates.  </p>
<p>So what did the White House do?  They encouraged Thomas to ignore Rangel and they had Trent Lott undermine any real progress in the Senate so they could give Thomas the time to push through low-bang-for-the-buck tax giveaways to their corporate donors.  For three years, Mr. Rove and his minions have told us that the Bush-Thomas plan was an effective one even though the evidence said otherwise.  So after the 2004 elections, Karl Rove finally admits it was not effective but then he turns around and tries to pin the blame on some unnamed Democrat?  Same old Karl Rove – alas!<br /></p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>John Taylor, the Treasury Undersecretary of Treasury for International Affairs, delivered an address on <a href="http://www.aei.org/events/filter.economic,eventID.936/transcript.asp">Policy Challenges of Global Payment Imbalances</a> at the American Enterprise Institute yesterday.  I learned about this address from <a href="http://atrios.blogspot.com/">Atrios</a> and his post called “We’re All Keynesians Now”.  Atrios points to this <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A26581-2004Nov4?language=printer">Washington Post Story </a>, which included the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>The large influx of foreign money shows that &#8220;sound, growth enhancing economic policies are continuing to make the U.S. an attractive place to invest,&#8221; he said. Taylor said administration policies already in place will help shrink the trade deficit. One is President Bush&#8217;s pledge to cut the budget deficit in half.. Taylor pointed out that the Treasury is also prodding foreign governments to achieve faster economic growth, which should increase demand for U.S. exports&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>The premise that a rise in investment relative to national savings was the cause of an increase in the current account deficit reminded me as the excuses 20 years ago when the apologists for the Reagan deficits put forth this excuse.  I figured Dr. Taylor would never be so careless but when we read the transcript, we see:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m going to focus a lot on the savings-investment gap… When a country, like the United States, is investing more than is being saved domestically, the rest of the investment is financed and comes from abroad, and that&#8217;s the current account deficit… There was a $112 billion increase in the current account deficit in the four quarters ending and the second quarter of this year.  This is measured on national income accounts basis. Now, this corresponded to an increase in investment in the United States of $335 billion. That outstripped an increase in American saving of $224, and therefore the current account increase. Now, that increase in investment in the United States that occurred, the $335 billion, of course, was very important for the United States recovery this year.  Growth has been strong… Now, let me talk a little bit about some of the economic policies that have been taken and will continue to be taken and indeed enhanced on in the Bush Administration to &#8212; that are quite related to the phenomenon of the current account and to the way that I&#8217;ve characterized this. First of all, in terms of the difference between investment and savings, clearly one of the &#8212; a policy that would raise savings is a policy that is &#8212; would tend &#8212; other things equal to reduce the current account deficit… as the President said, by half over the next four years. I think it&#8217;s important to note that there is &#8212; we&#8217;ve already seen with the recovery we have had the changes in the deficit.  At the beginning of this year, both CBO and the Administration, forecast a larger deficit than has occurred thus far.  It focused just on fiscal year &#8217;04 which already closed. The Administration forecast a budget deficit for fiscal year &#8217;04 which was a $108 billion larger than actually took place.  In other words, because of the faster growth, largely because of the faster growth, the deficit came down relative to forecasts by $108 billion. </p></blockquote>
<p>I agree with the focus on the savings-investment gap, but if one looks at the ratio of investment to GDP now versus where it was four years ago, the nation is investing less.  The problem is that the Bush fiscal stimulus lowered national savings even more.  Yes, the investment slump has been partially reversed as we did have decent economic growth over the last year.  But this notion that the Federal deficit is falling simply is not true.  We would hope that Bush would pursue fiscal restraint, but we see no evidence of any plans to do so.  </p>
<p>Since my own posts on fiscal policy have played on the Mundell-Fleming model of how fiscal policy affects the current account under floating exchange rates, I just reached for my copy of Greg Mankiw’s 1992 edition of <em>Macroeconomics</em>.  Chapter 13 notes that fiscal stimulus crowds out net exports.  As I recall the discussion of this issue in <em>Macroeconomics</em> by Robert Hall and John Taylor is similar.  I hope Dr. Taylor is correct about the future course of fiscal policy, but I found his AEI speech rather disappointing.<br /></p>

                                <p>In recent weeks the dollar has been steadily weakening, but since Tuesday that decline has intensified.  Today the dollar hit <a href="http://cbs.marketwatch.com/news/story.asp?column=Currencies&#038;siteid=mktw&#038;dist=">all-time record lows</a> against the euro.</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/daily_xrates.jpg"></p>
<p>Note that in the past year or so, the Japanese CB has started intervening in the currency markets whenever the Yen has fallen below about 108, and they&#8217;ve intervened <em><strong>heavily</strong></em> whenever the Yen has fallen near or below 106.  In fact, they seem to have drawn a line in the sand at about 105 ¥/$, below which they absolutely refuse to let the exchange rate go.  It will be interesting to see if they are still just as committed to that minimum exchange rate this time around.</p>

                                <p>Nonfarm payroll employment increased by 337,000 in October per the latest <a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm">report</a> report from BLS.</p>
<p>The household survey showed a 289,000 increase in employment but also a 367,000 in the reported civilian labor force.  So despite the good news in employment, the recorded unemployment rate rose to 5.5%.  </p>
<p>Looking at employment over the past 12 months, it has increased by about 2 million.  Now if we can only sustain employment increases equal to 2 million new jobs per year for the next four years, we might eventually be closer to full employment.<br /></p>

<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;Tax Fairness Act of 2005.&#8221; This Act would mandate that, within some reasonable margin of error, your state should get as much back from the feds as is sent to them in taxes. It&#8217;s time to end this kind of geographic welfare!</p></blockquote>
<p>He also has a list, based on <a href="http://www.taxfoundation.org/taxingspending.html">taxfoundation.org data</a>, of the deadbeat states, itemized by Red/Blue status. In fairness, Atrios also writes that<br />
<br />
<blockquote>&#8230;Look folks, for the record this is a &#8220;stupid&#8221; idea and not one which either should or will pass.  The purpose of it is to:</p>
<p>*Get into the public dialogue the fact that the anti-guvmint Bush-voting states to a great degree prosper to whatever extent they do because of an infusion of money from Kerry-voting states.</p></blockquote>
<p>As I said, it&#8217;s something I&#8217;m still thinking about and I mostly find it appealing because I&#8217;ve only thought about the benefits, not the costs. Inter-state cooperation clearly has strong benefits, and reaping them almost by definition requires coordinated action by the federal government. In fact, I believe we first learned that lesson back when the founders did away with the Articles of Confederation and replaced them with the Constitution.</p>
<p>That said, one of the real costs of the transfer of money from Blue states to Red is that the residents of Red states are partly insulated from the consequences of really bad economic policy, freeing them to base their votes on other dimensions like &#8216;gay people are icky.&#8217; The reddest Red states are relatively poor now, but they are apparently not sufficiently relatively poor to vote with their pocketbooks &#8212; yet.</p>
<p>If this continues, I question whether we can ever return to a point where we have semi-rational policy formulation based on some sort of comparisons of costs and benefits. And I question whether we&#8217;ll be able to stop saddling our children with additional mounds of debt. So, it may be a bad idea, but it may nevertheless be the contrained optimum.</p>
<p>AB</p>
<p>UPDATE: Responding to the first comment asking how this could be done, the answer is clearly not to pass Atrios&#8217; jokingly proposed act. But there are lots of measures that could reduce the transfers at the margins. One is to expand the dividend tax cuts. Another is to cut the capital gains tax. A third is to replace non-federally deductible forms of taxation with deductible ones, like property taxes and state income taxes (though a previous commenter said the last tax bill made consumption taxes deductible, too). States can change their own tax codes without approval from the Republican controlled federal government.</p>
<p>The two common features of all these are that they are Republican ideas and that they are regressive. The Blue states would need to be clever in restoring progressivity via their internal tax systems. So to some extent, it is in fact feasible, at least until the Red staters&#8217; catch on. Were I still angry, I&#8217;d say that the Red states could be easily distracted by more gay marriage proposals and &#8220;under God&#8221; controversies while the Blue states push through such measures.</p>
<p>Of course, &#8220;could&#8221; does not imply &#8220;should&#8221; (see Iraq, Invasion of). </p>

                                <p>Chris Dodd has apparently pulled out of the running and Harry Reid may be the leading choice for now.  </p>
<p>Amy Sullivan and Kevin Drum explosives are having a great discussion on who should replace Tom Daschle over at <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/">Political Animal</a>.   Besides Dodd and Reid, Kevin’s list includes Senators Kerry, Clinton, and Durbin.  Amy makes two very good points:</p>
<blockquote><p>But it is clear that Senate Democrats simply cannot afford to have a leader who hails from a hardcore red state… Democrats can&#8217;t choose a leader so liberal that they simply feed into the &#8220;Ted-Kennedy-tax-and-spend&#8221; stereotype. </p></blockquote>
<p>If Kerry wishes to be his name forward, he’d be a great choice.  Maybe I have a California bias but another blue state moderate would be Dianne Feinstein.  In fact, she’d make a good choice for our nomination for the White House in 2008 IMO.<br /></p>

                                <p>This was fairly widely expected, but the possibility now <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&#038;e=3&#038;u=/ap/ashcroft_future">looks increasingly certain</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>WASHINGTON &#8211; Attorney General John Ashcroft  is likely to leave his post before the start of President Bush&#8217;s second term, senior aides said Thursday. </p>
<p>Ashcroft, 62, is described as exhausted from leading the Justice Department in fighting the domestic war on terrorism since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Stress was a factor in Ashcroft&#8217;s health problems earlier this year that resulted in removal of his gall bladder.</p></blockquote>
<p>I know lots of people think that Ashcroft is evil, but in my opinion, Ashcroft has demonstrated more incompetence than anything else.  This news feeds into my impression that he a man who is not very bright, with little imagination or critical capabilities, and who has been in over his head as Attorney General.  Parts of the 9/11 commission report suggest that <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2004/07/system-was-blinking-red-after-spending.html">Ashcroft may be incompetent</a>, and despite having the powerful tools of the Patriot Act at his disposal, Ashcroft has <a href="http://www.alternet.org/rights/19948/">failed to convict a single person of terrorism</a>.  A new AG would be a good place to start for Bush.</p>
