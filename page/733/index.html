<blockquote><p>Shown are 1,659 adult Schistosoma mansoni worms obtained by live surgical perfusion of an 18-year-old patient. In this issue of PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases, Daniel G. Colley and W. Evan Secor present an agenda for schistosomiasis research (see Colley et al., e32) and ask readers to add comments and discussions to their article, so that &#8220;the agenda will serve as one focal point for interactive interchange among the schistosomiasis community, and thus provide a foundation for true collaborations within and across the spectrum of research.&#8221;</p>

<blockquote><p>Dr. Hotez says &#8220;And yet we have a devastating parasitic disease burden among the American poor, right under our nose,&#8221; Hotez said.<br />He noted a recent study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, presented in November, found that almost 14 percent of the U.S. population is infected with Toxocara roundworms, which dogs and cats can pass to people.</p>
<p>&#8220;Urban playgrounds in the United States have recently been shown to be a particularly rich source of Toxocara eggs and inner-city children are at high risk of acquiring the infection,&#8221; Hotez wrote, adding that this might be partly behind the rise in asthma cases in the country. Up to 23 percent of urban black children may be infected, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because of its possible links to asthma, it would be important to determine whether covert toxocariasis is a basis for the rise of asthma among inner-city children in the northeastern United States,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cysticercosis is another very serious parasitic worm infection &#8230; caused by the tapeworm Taenia solium, that results in seizures and other neurological manifestations,&#8221; Hotez wrote.</p>
<p>He said up to 2,000 new cases of neurological disease caused by tapeworms are diagnosed every year in the United States. More than 2 percent of adult Latinos may be infected, and with 35 million Hispanics in the United States, this could add up to tens of thousands of cases, Hotez said.</p>

                                <p>The price of oil touched $100 today.</p>
<p>The new record is being accompanied by all kinds of analysis and comments relating this new record to developments in the US economy.</p>
<p>But, US real oil imports, including both crude and refined products have been flat to down since early in the decade.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/R3wKqca1zDI/AAAAAAAAAD8/gx8rB9srrps/s1600-h/Clipboard01.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/R3wKqca1zDI/AAAAAAAAAD8/gx8rB9srrps/s320/Clipboard01.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a><br />Looking at it from the OPEC and other international suppliers of oil, US imports represent US oil demand.  This chart clearly shows that the run up in oil prices to $100 had little or nothing to do with demand from the US.  The rise in oil prices is being driven by demand from the rest of the world like China and India.</p>

<blockquote><p>OTTAWA — By 10:33 a.m. Wednesday, Canada’s top 100 CEOs had already earned the same amount of money that will take the average full-time worker all year to make, according to a left-leaning think-tank.</p>
<p>The Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives (CCPA) said in a report that these corporate elites made $39,998 by mid-morning Wednesday, based on an assumption of nine hours and 33-minutes worth of pay based on an average annual salary of about $8.5 million. </p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>The report added that by 1:04 p.m. New Year’s Day, these CEOs had already earned what will take a minimum-wage earner all year to make. </p></blockquote>
<p>My guess is that American top 100 CEOs didn&#8217;t have to wait until Wednesday to bring in what the average American will make over the coming year.</p>

                                <p>I was reading <a href="http://atrios.blogspot.com/2007_12_30_archive.html#933287625907264078">this Atrios post</a> and I started to wonder&#8230;   why exactly does the Iraqi military need any training from the US at this point or going forward?  I can understand in 2003, 2004, and maybe in 2005 &#8211; when you dismiss much of the existing military, you essentially need to train replacements from scratch.  Its especially difficult, we&#8217;re told, to train NCOs and the lower echelon of the officer corps &#8211; lieutenants and captains. </p>
<p>But by now, the Iraqi military has been in some semblance of combat for almost five years.  If five years of actual combat isn&#8217;t enough time to produce a generation of capable NCOs and officers who could then train the next generation of Iraqi military, how exactly are American personnel supposed to be useful?</p>

                                <p>Yesterday I went to a cheese party (they had wine too, but its not a wine and cheese party to a guy who doesn&#8217;t drink) at the home a successful photographer for a few hours.  Him being a photographer, this being Los Angeles, it was an eclectic crowd.  Everything from button down manager types to folks with so many tattoos they could probably not wear shirts and get away with it.  </p>
<p>It seemed to me that the fraction of the people who have lost their job, are looking for another job, or are hurting for work among the free-lance types (and to some extent, I&#8217;m in that boat myself &#8211; work has been slow for a couple of months though I&#8217;m confident its about to pick up) is much higher than you&#8217;d expect with a 4.x% unemployment rate.  But then, I&#8217;ve made this observation before so I&#8217;m not going to belabor the point.  </p>
<p>Which led to this&#8230; last night there was some discussion about &#8220;career coaches&#8221; and whether or not they actually help a person get a job.  Opinions ranged.  So I was wondering:</p>
<p>1.  Do career coaches actually help a person get a job.  (And since apparently they charge unemployed people thousands of dollars, that&#8217;s the only relevant question?)<br />2.  How does one test that proposition?<br />3.  If career coaches can actually be useful, what are the objective ways to tell the difference between the useful ones and the useless ones?  (It strikes me that asymmetric might be a problem, except that the information might not be so asymmetric &#8211; perhaps professional career coaches might not have any idea about whether they&#8217;re helpful or not.)</p>

                                <p>Its being noted that Fox News plans to leave <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2008_01/012816.php">Ron Paul</a> off the upcoming Republican debate its televising.  This despite the fact that candidates that don&#8217;t poll as well in Iowa and New Hampshire, but who are more to the liking of the national Republican establishment, will be included, and the New Hampshire GOP wants him there.  </p>
<p>Now, I&#8217;m no Ron Paul supporter, but this really doesn&#8217;t seem right to me.  If he is excluded, it should be for failing to meet some objective criteria, and others who fail to meet that same objective criteria should be left out as well. </p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t long ago that many on the right were excoriating Dem candidates for not wanting to appear on a debate on Fox.  It looks like perhaps Rep candidates shouldn&#8217;t either.</p>

<p>His conclusion is no surprise:  corporate welfare.  His post is well worth a read.</p>
<p>As a by the way, regular readers know I&#8217;ve been saying all along the big banks were going to get a bail-out, but I figured it would come only through tax breaks.  Apparently I misunderestimated the ways that public money can be funneled to large financial institutions.  Can you think of others?</p>

<p>PONZI PREDICTIONS FOR 2008 &#038; BEYOND</p>
<p>-It begins to dawn on people that the idea that the US economy is &#8220;fundamentally sound&#8221; may be incorrect &#8212; as the financial economy tries to deal with the fact that asset prices cannot rise forever &#8212; and that increases in monetary aggregates will play out as inflation elsewhere. &#8220;Securitization&#8221; will be increasingly seen as the equivalent of a bad sausage &#8212; grinding a little e-coli into everyone’s meat.</p>
<p>-The Ponzi Scheme of Credit Expansion will BEGIN to unwind &#8212; as people realize that inflating assets and then borrowing against them, is not &#8220;an economy&#8221; &#8212; nor is borrowing money from other societies and spending it in their shop. We can say what we want about the size of our &#8220;GDP&#8221; &#8212; but the REAL ECONOMY &#8212; the one where somebody actually MAKES SOMETHING is a healthy but too-small part of our whole economic picture.</p>
<p>-While in the 1930s we were not in dire need of imported energy, commodities and finished goods &#8212; we are now &#8212; and so our economic decline will not pull down prices to levels that everyone can afford. So, even if we do not have a contraction the size of the one in the 1930s &#8212; it will be just as tough &#8212; as so many essentials will be hard to afford.</p>
<p>&#8211; We are at the top of virtually every trend &#8212; peak debt, peak asset values, peak oil, peak demographics – peak climate, PEAK EVERYTHING you name it &#8212; the Best Case Scenario is still the Perfect Storm.</p>
<p>-The Great Unraveling could be slow or fast &#8212; with any recovery having to lift the weight of retiring boomers and old debts that we can’t inflate away. Don’t compare Total Credit Market Debt with GDP – compare it to the size of the Real Economy – and the amount available to service debt. Someone with a $50,000 income and $500,000 in debt does not have all his income to service or repay debt – only what is left after essentials. Likewise Government debt combined with total private debt equals something north of 50 TRILLION. (NOT counting unfounded liabilities of future fiscal “gaps” between projected inflow-outflow. What percentage of the real economy is needed to pay that? </p>
<p>Oh – and about those economic growth predictions used to predict the fiscal gap….</p>
<p>-The amount of growth needed to manage the above debt-loads are not possible – therefore we will need to vaporize that debt – or it will vaporize us – with mass insolvency.</p>
<p>-In time, our current society will be seen as one that ate all the food in fridge, all the food in the pantry, sent out for pizza, maxed out the credit cards and then burned the furniture while proclaiming that we are really very warm and well-fed. Financial historians in the future will say, &#8220;what were they thinking?&#8221; about our era.</p>
<p>-“Economist” will become the lowest status profession.</p>
<p>-For a time people will understand that you cannot become wealthier by printing more little pieces of colored paper – or the electronic credit version thereof.</p>
<p>-The economy will be the main issue of the 2008 election and the Republicans will do very poorly. Having said that &#8212; the Democrats will have no constructive answers or responses. Short-term thinking and a low-pain threshold will prevent any really constructive actions.</p>
<p>-Baby-boomer paper assets will be decimated – and while they may return to older values in nominal dollars – that won’t mean much in purchasing power – as we are not the only ones in the world who want wheat, soy, corn, copper, oil, fish, etc.</p>
<p>-As the economy declines throughout 2008 and 2009 people will try stick it out until things &#8220;turn the corner&#8221; &#8212; but in a sense that will never happen &#8212; as Aggregate Americans live beyond their means there will be a PERMANENT reduction of our standard of living. Things may only improve substantially after most of the boomers are dead and we can get out from under the demographic problem.</p>
<p>-I am going to coin two new words here &#8212; 2008 will be INVERSIONARY &#8212; about asset deflation and monetary debasement – and instead of &#8220;inflationary&#8221; or &#8220;deflationary&#8221; &#8212; we will have a DISTORTIONARY economy &#8212; as monetary expansion tries to battle sinking asset prices.</p>
<p>-*IF* the economy limps along up until the election without a widely recognized recession – the price we will pay will be an environment with inflationary forces prevailing in an overwhelming fashion. Most likely: Inflationary Recession or “Stagflation”.</p>
<p>-The near future will be an interesting time to live – as our society collapses in many ways – we will have to re-invent ourselves and our systems – however all these mistake will be repeated in another 80 years.</p>
<p>Finally:</p>

<p>This one was by Edward Charles Ponzi Jr.</p>
<p>Cactus here&#8230;  I&#8217;ve stated before, I&#8217;ll state again&#8230;  I think the economy will be slower next year than it was during the first three quarters of this year.  I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if we have a recession some time next year.  The bill is coming due.  Of course, its always possible that the Fed will really goose the economy by making money really, really cheap to avoid that fate&#8230; but if it does it, it won&#8217;t be avoiding that fate, merely postponing it.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Via <a href="http://betsyspage.blogspot.com/2007/12/mistakes-in-war.html">Betsy&#8217;s Page</a>, an <a href="http://www.claremont.org/publications/crb/id.1500/article_detail.asp">essay by VD Hanson</a>.  VD-H argues that its no biggie that mistakes have been made in Iraq&#8230; after all, mistakes were made during the US Civil War, WW1, WW2  (European and Pacific theater), Korea, and Vietnam.  (He goes on to list a bunch of &#8217;em.)</p>
<p>This strikes me as illogical as&#8230; the sort of nonsense that VD-H usually writes. </p>
<p>In the US Civil War, the disparity between the Union and the Confederacy wasn&#8217;t all that big.  Either side, by itself, would probably have been considered one of the ten or so most powerful military entities in the world at the time.     In WW1, we entered against the Germans and Austro-Hungarians&#8230; who had managed up until then to fight the other major European powers plus the Russians to a standstill.  In WW2, the war was against the German and Japanese empires, which in a few short years had managed to take over much of the world.  In Korea, it was against China, the most populous nation on earth &#8211; with by far the biggest military.  In Vietnam, it was a proxy war against the USSR, the world&#8217;s other superpower at the time.</p>
<p>Clearly even VD-H should be able to see a difference in magnitude.  The Iraqi military, after more than a decade of sanctions, was a shadow of its former self &#8211; the same former self that had surrendered en masse to CNN cameramen.  Sure, the CNN cameramen had reams of spare of videotape, but still.  And the insurgents are even more pitiful examples of military prowess &#8211; when insurgents tried to take on Saddam&#8217;s defeated (by CNN) military after Gulf War 1, they were crushed. </p>
<p>One can only conclude that the mistakes in the current war are orders of magnitude beyond those described in VD-H&#8217;s essay.  Leaving every one of the enemy&#8217;s captured ammo dumps unguarded in our haste to protect the Oil Ministry in Iraq means a few thousand more American soldiers die over a period of five years.  On the other hand, a tiny miscalculation against the Germans in World War 2 could mean tens of thousands of casualties immediately.  Heck &#8211; ask the French what happened when they made of mistake of assuming that the Germans would respect the neutrality of the low countries.  Failure to translate an intercepted Japanese message almost wiped out the entire US Pacific fleet. It was only blind luck that US flat-tops were in the open ocean during Pearl Harbor or there wouldn&#8217;t have been a Battle of Midway &#8211; instead, there would have been a Battle of San Francisco.  Miscommunication with the USSR almost led to World War 3.  </p>
<p>The kind of mistakes that are prolonging the mess in Iraq are very different from the the kind of mistakes you can recover from when dealing with the Confederacy, the Third Reich, the Empire of Japan, the PLA, or the Soviet Union.    If VD-H can&#8217;t tell the difference, I guess he can always continue writing for the National Review and similar publications.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>So right after Benazir Bhutto is assassinated, her her husband and her 19 year old son become <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/30/world/asia/30cnd-pakistan.html?_r=1&#038;ref=world&#038;oref=slogin">co-leaders</a> of her party.   Of course, Bhutto herself got the job upon the death of her father.  I note&#8230; from what I can tell, this is pretty much the only Party that matters in Pakistan today, unless you count the crazy fanatics or the military.</p>
<p>At the same time, writing about another topic &#8211; the promotion of my <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/12/relatives.html">semi-sorta-kinda cuz</a>, the inimitable TBogg, no doubt taking a break from watching moss grow on his basset hounds,  <a href="http://tbogg.firedoglake.com/2007/12/30/a-family-affair/">writes</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Like Bill Kristol (and John Podhoretz, and Jonah Goldberg and Mark Halperin) Andrew Rosenthal is a legacy hire, so let&#8217;s not even pretend that we&#8217;re talking about a meritocracy here. Why work hard and be smart and when your last name is the Golden Ticket to Willy Wonka&#8217;s House of Media Aristocracy? So, of course Andy doesn&#8217;t understand why people might take offense at his hiring a man whose name might as well be Billkristolisfuckingwrongabouteverything. Sure it&#8217;s not like Kristol was being hired as a straight news reporter where facts are everything, unless you&#8217;re Judith Miller, but he might have considered hiring someone with a passing acquaintance with things like the real world where there are consequences for being wrong and being stupid and the idea that you can  smirk your way through the bloody consequences is not acceptable. But, no. Kristol and Rosenthal are mirror images of each other; both born on third and still wondering why the other kids never pick them first when choosing up sides.</p></blockquote>
<p>TBogg <a href="http://tbogg.firedoglake.com/2007/12/30/sure-we-lose-money-with-every-sale-but-we-make-it-up-in-volume/#more-9757">follows it up</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>It must be interesting to go through life knowing that the Wingnut Fairy will put money under your pillow every night no matter how many times the invisible hand of the free market gives you the finger. If it weren&#8217;t for wingnut welfare Lucianne, Irving, Gertrude, Norman, and Midge would have left their idiot children on a hill somewhere for the wolves to eat.</p></blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, an anecdote I&#8217;ve shared before&#8230;  for a while I worked for a Fortune 500 company.  The CEO was a young guy.  From what I could tell, his primary qualifications for running the company were that he was the son of the previous CEO, and the grandson of the previous CEO.  His second most important qualifications that I saw were the somewhat a incestuous relationship going between his family (one of two big shareholders of the company) and the folks who owned an investment bank (the other big shareholder of the company).   I believe the third most important qualification he brought to the table was the fact that the company was competing against other companies whose leaders came from similarly narrow pools of people who had only a superficial understanding of the workings of the company in which they inherited a large share, or who  had only a superficial understanding of the workings of the company they had bought a large share in using funds they had inherited.  The fourth key thing that made him CEO-worthy was his father&#8217;s membership at Augusta.  He  also seemed to pretty used to the trappings of power, and I&#8217;m sure that counts for something.  </p>
<p>OK.  So I&#8217;ve described three situations &#8211; Bhutto&#8217;s son, TBogg&#8217;s story about Kristol and Company, and a company where I worked.  In my opinion, three very similar stories.  But here&#8217;s how I imagine these three situations would play in Peoria&#8230;</p>
<p>Situation 1.  My guess is that even without being aware of her husband acquired his nickname &#8220;Mr. Ten Percent&#8221;, most Americans would probably not associate this chain of events as hewing all that closely to the Democratic ideals that Bhutto used to talk about and would disapprove of where this story is going.  (Key words:  talk about.)<br />Situation 2.  I imagine about half of all Americans would tsk tsk over my semi-sorta-cousin&#8217;s recent appointment if the situation had been to explained to them with TBogg&#8217;s eloquence<br />Situation 3.  I figure only a very small number of Americans would have a problem with the CEO story.</p>
<p>Am I right about this?  And if so, what&#8217;s the difference between these three situations?</p>
<p>&#8212;-</p>
<p>And a follow-up&#8230; reader dxc sends a link to <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-op-bacevich30dec30,0,952089.story">an essay in the LA Times</a> that touches on both Pakistan, and people inheriting their positions of power:</p>
<blockquote><p>At the beginning of his second term, Bush spoke confidently of the United States sponsoring a global democratic revolution &#8220;with the ultimate goal of ending tyranny in our world.&#8221; Ever since that hopeful moment, developments across the greater Middle East &#8212; above all, in Iraq, Afghanistan, Lebanon and on the West Bank &#8212; have exposed the very real limits of U.S. wisdom and power.</p>
<p>Now the virtual impotence of the U.S. in the face of the crisis enveloping Pakistan &#8212; along with its complicity in creating that crisis &#8212; ought to discredit once and for all any notions of America fixing the world&#8217;s ills.</p>
<p>Bush dreamed of managing history. It turns out that he cannot even manage Pakistan. Thus does the Author of Liberty mock the pretensions of those who presume to understand his intentions and to interpret his will.</p></blockquote>
