                                <div>Last Wednesday, the day after oral argument at the Supreme Court in a case called <i>Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum</i>, both Linda and I posted about the case.  Linda’s post I believe was written shortly before the argument although posted afterward.  Mine was written after the argument and discussed news reports about what occurred.  The title of Linda’s post was “<a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/02/supreme-court-corporate-monsters-if.html">The Supreme Court&#8217;s corporate monsters&#8211;if money buys them &#8220;free speech&#8221; rights, can it help them avoid giving others human rights?</a>” The title of mine was “<a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/02/international-law-as-established-at.html">International Law, As Established At Nuremberg*: The ACTUAL Grounds On Which the Supreme Court Will Rule For Shell Oil’s Parent Company In<i> Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum</i></a>.”  (I added the asterisk and the related footnote later that night, to make clear that the part of the title that preceded the colon was intended as a sarcastic reference to a statement made by the oil company’s counsel during oral argument, a statement I discussed in the post.)
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>To refresh your memory—it was barely more than a week ago, but in the intervening time, we’ve all been somewhat distracted by more important things, such as whether slightly-increased private healthcare premiums caused by the inclusion of contraceptives coverage really is public welfare paid by “taxpayers” and therefore women who receive the benefit are prostitutes—my post began by explaining the supposed issue in the case.  I wrote:<br /><a name="more"></a></div>
<div>In her post earlier today on <i>Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum</i>, the sort-of-<i>Citizens</i>&#8211;<i>United</i>-like case argued yesterday in the Supreme Court, Linda discusses the issue that was supposed to be the one that the Court would decide, because, well, that was the issue that the lower appellate court, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, decided.  The issue is whether under the Alien Tort Statute, which was enacted in 1789 and allows “aliens” to file civil lawsuits in the U.S. for violations of the “law of nations,” allows aliens to sue <i>corporations</i>, or instead only individuals, for violations of human rights as defined under clearly-established international law.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The Second Circuit court said it doesn’t, and, as the excerpt from that opinion that Linda posts shows, the appellate panel used as its justification the judges’ own moral judgment that since individuals (i.e., the corporation’s top executives) make the corporate decisions to leverage the corporation’s resources to accomplish these heinous acts, only those individuals, and not the ill-used corporation itself, should be suable.  And that therefore, only those individuals, and not the ill-used corporation itself, <i>will</i> be suable in U. S. federal courts under the ATS.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>This notwithstanding that the statute itself says nothing at all about <i>who</i> can be sued under it; it states only what acts the actor can be sued <i>for</i>.  And notwithstanding that the Second Circuit panel’s stated grounds for the ruling, if not necessarily the result (the dismissal of the lawsuit), conflict with the Supreme Court’s ruling two years ago in <i>Citizens United v. FEC</i>.  Which parlayed the First Amendment free-speech right of individuals into a right of corporate CEOs to leverage those rights of its individual human shareholders into a First Amendment speech right of the CEO to use corporate funds to advance his or her political preferences.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>I noted that Anthony Kennedy, author of the <i>Citizens United</i> opinion, reportedly indicated that he agreed with the oil company’s statement in its brief that international law does not recognize corporate liability.  Case closed, as far as he was concerned.  But several of the justices disagreed—most emphatically Stephen Breyer and Elena Kagan, but Alito seemed to, too. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>But I went on to say that I expected from what transpired that the Court wouldn’t decide that issue at all and would instead decide the case on entirely separate grounds asserted by Samuel Alito during the argument but not addressed earlier in the case.  Alito questioned whether the statute applies as against <i>anyone</i>, corporation or individual, when, as in that case, the acts alleged occurred outside the United States, by someone or some entity not based in the United States, against people who have no connection to the United States.  I predicted that a majority led by Alito would say it does not.</p>
<p>It now looks like I was right.</p></div>
</p>
<p>
<div>On Monday afternoon, the Court issued a surprise order in the case, asking that the parties brief the following issue:</div>
<div>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Whether and under what circumstances the Alien Tort Statute, 28 U.S.C. § 1350, allows courts to recognize a cause of action for violations of the law of nations occurring within the territory of a sovereign other than the United States.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The briefing won’t be completed until June 29, and so the Court will decide the case next term, not during the term that ends by July 1. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The defendant in <i>Kiobel</i> did not claim that the statute provides federal-court jurisdiction (the legal authority to hear the case) only for cases alleging violations of international law that occurred within the United States—probably because the words of the statute suggest otherwise, and because in a 2004 case filed under that statute, in which the acts at issue occurred outside the United States , the Supreme Court gave no indication that it does.  But as SCOTUSblog’s<a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/2012/03/kiobel-to-be-reargued/"> Lyle Denniston noted</a>, the defendant in another current ATS case does.  That defendant lost in the appellate court, and filed a petition asking the Supreme Court to consider the issue in that case.  The justices considered the petition last Friday and took no action on that petition.  Instead, they inserted the issue into <i>Kiobel</i>, in an order described variously by commenters as surprising, unusual, and <a href="http://newsandinsight.thomsonreuters.com/Legal/News/2012/03_-_March/SCOTUS__Should_U_S__courts_police_international_human_rights_/">stunning</a>. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The injection of this issue into <i>Kiobel</i> enables the justices to avoid ruling on whether the statute, enacted the same year that the Constitution was ratified, applies only to allow suits against individuals and not against violations corporations under whose auspices the human rights violations occurred. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The one-sentence statute says: “The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any civil action by an alien for a tort only, committed in violation of the law of nations or a treaty of the United States.”  The law of nations does not allow corporations to have atrocities committed under their auspices, whatever yoga-like linguistics contortions Justice Kennedy’s mind or law clerks performed that caused him to suggest otherwise at the argument.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>But neither do the statute’s words suggest that it does not apply to (as the Court put it in its briefing order) violations of the law of nations occurring within the territory of a sovereign other than the United States.  If the statute adopts international law only to identify what <i>torts</i>—what <i>actions</i>—can be the subject of a suit in the country, and not to identify who (or what) can be sued, then it shouldn’t matter that (according to Kennedy at oral argument, quoting from a brief supporting the oil company) this country appears to be the only one in the world to “exercise universal civil jurisdiction over alleged extraterritorial human rights abuses to which the nation has no connection.”  But it will, although possibly circuitously.</div>
<div>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>“What business does a case like this have in the courts of the United States?” Alito asked.  None, a majority of the Court is likely to say, and not because the defendant is a corporation but instead because the atrocities alleged occurred in Nigeria rather than in the United States.  But since the statute itself doesn’t say that, the majority of justices will have to either interpret it as implying that it does or say that the statute must be interpreted in that matter in order to avoid striking it down as unconstitutional, because (they’ll say) Congress lacks the authority to give the federal courts jurisdiction to hear cases about wrongs committed outside the territorial United States. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Which would be a novel ruling, but one that, as Denniston points out, Alito seemed to suggest by asking: “Is there an Article III source of jurisdiction for a lawsuit like this?…What’s the constitutional basis for a lawsuit like this, where an alien is suing an alien?” 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Article III is the section of the Constitution that created the judicial branch.  It’s also the part of the Constitution that says that Congress, which Article I created, has the authority to grant the federal courts jurisdiction (legal authority) to hear certain types of cases.*  In enacting the ATS, Congress granted the federal district courts the authority to hear “any civil action by an alien for a tort only, committed in violation of the law of nations or a treaty of the United States.”
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>But there are other parts of the Constitution—the Bill of Rights; the Fourteenth Amendment (due process, equal protection of the law); the prohibition against suspension of the right to habeas corpus and against <i>ex post facto</i> laws and bills of attainder (protections included in the original Constitution)—that appear to require access to federal court in order to challenge, whether or not Congress provides for it. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>There are other parts of the Constitution, such as Article II, which created the executive branch, that may limit Congress’s authority to create federal-court jurisdiction.  This is what Alito appears to have in mind.*
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>And conversely, there are other parts of the Constitution—the Bill of Rights; the Fourteenth Amendment (due process, equal protection of the law); the prohibition against suspension of the right to habeas corpus and against <i>ex post facto</i> laws and bills of attainder (protections included in the original Constitution)—that appear to require access to federal court in order to challenge, whether or not Congress provides for it. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Or at least it would seem so.  The political right is incessantly trying to remove federal-court jurisdiction to hear cases that they claim violate states’ rights to violate individuals’ rights—a tactic called “court-stripping.”  And one that, with the aggressive assistance of the current Supreme Court, has been phenomenally successful in effectively suspending (read: eliminating) the right of federal-court habeas corpus review by persons convicted of crimes in state court. “Phenomenally” is no overstatement, either.  It’s truly a phenomenon, and one that needs its own post.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Court-stripping and the reverse—I’ll call it court-mandating—are issues that the Supreme Court normally avoids like the plague, best as I can tell.  But if nothing else good comes from <i>Kiobel</i>—and it certainly looks like nothing else will—a Supreme Court acknowledgment that there are constitutional limits to Congress’s authority to determine federal-court jurisdiction might be the consolation prize.  But only if that limitation is viewed as a two-way street.

We as a whole can be educated to the hilt, but if we can&#8217;t trust that our efforts will be put to constructive use, we have problems. Think habeas corpus, FISA, election fraud, threatening of the press, intimidation of speech, extension of free speech to none human entities, the equating of one voice-one vote to spending of one&#8217;s money, K Street project, etc. Think of the use of fear. If only a few are educated to the hilt or have access to the governance, we can not build capital. </p></blockquote>

<div>It appears in this War on Terror, England is not the only nation learning from another regarding how to<a href="http://downingstreetmemo.com/memos.html">“fix” the war</a>.  We too have obviously learned from England regarding war management.

                                <p>In <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/02/is-america-losing-its-drive-pt-3.html">Part 3 of this series</a>, I wondered a couple of things.</p>
<p> &#8211; With the vehicle/1000 people number in the range of 825 to 845 since 2004, is the market near saturation?<br />&#8211;  Is the January sales number of 14.2 SAAR (seasonally adjusted at annual rate) enough to maintain the vehicle/1000 people number?</p>
<p>For the first question, I have to again credit R<a href="http://www.realitybase.org/">oger Chittum</a> for pointing me to <a href="http://www.econ.nyu.edu/dept/courses/gately/DGS_Vehicle%20Ownership_2007.pdf">this 2007 paper</a>, <i>Vehicle Ownership and Income Growth, Worldwide: 1960-2030</i>,  by Dargay, Gately and Sommer (32 page pdf, data through 2002.)  There&#8217;s  a lot to this paper, including projections into the future for vehicle  sales and fuel consumption, worldwide.   My immediate interest is in  their use of a Gompertz function to estimate vehicle market saturation  as a function of per-capita income.</p>
<p>Here is one of their graphs.</p>
<div><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-JqSHtuM4TIc/T1e8OSCQA2I/AAAAAAAABxI/m2RE7YuXlTs/s1600/Vehicle+Gomperz.JPG"><img border="0" height="277" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-JqSHtuM4TIc/T1e8OSCQA2I/AAAAAAAABxI/m2RE7YuXlTs/s400/Vehicle+Gomperz.JPG" width="400"></a></div>
<div> Graph 1  Vehicle/1000 Gompertz Function of Per-Capita Income</div>
<p>Their  model indicates flattening above about $30K per year, and leads to a  saturation point in the U.S. of about 852 vehicles per 1000 population.   Saturation points for various countries also depend on urbanization and  population density.  See the paper for details and background.</p>
<p>This indicates that the U.S market is about 97% saturated, give or take a point.</p>
<p>What does that suggest for vehicle sales going forward?   <a href="http://modeledbehavior.com/2012/03/01/halftime-in-america-car-sales-data-smash-my-personal-estimates/#comment-24557">Karl Smith</a> led off the month pointing to <a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-jbRyVm8-MYI/T0_e_f8ZZxI/AAAAAAAAMSQ/-je1Q8MqCbE/s1600/VehiclesSalesFeb2012.jpg">this graph</a> from <a href="http://www.calculatedriskblog.com/2012/03/us-light-vehicle-sales-at-151-million.html">Calculated Risk</a>, estimating light vehicle SAAR for February at 15.1 million.  With that, on to question 2. <br />  <br />I  already have the data in hand for vehicles/1000 population (see part  3.)  The data for the Calculated Risk SAAR graph comes from <a href="http://bea.gov/search/index.cfm">BEA</a>,  Table 7.2.5S.  Plotting a scattergram of YoY change in Vehicles/1000  population vs annual average SAAR for the years 1990 to 2009 gives us  this picture.  (See notes, below.)</p>
<p>
<div><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-BzEPrGYUMUA/T1fDeed2h0I/AAAAAAAABxQ/LHbZHOrA8yg/s1600/Vehicles+per+1000+and+SAAR.JPG"><img border="0" height="298" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-BzEPrGYUMUA/T1fDeed2h0I/AAAAAAAABxQ/LHbZHOrA8yg/s400/Vehicles+per+1000+and+SAAR.JPG" width="400"></a></div>
<div> Graph 2   SAAR and Change in Vehicles/1000 Population</div>
<p>This suggests that the break even point for vehicles per 1000 is right around 14.7 million annual average SAAR.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>The  official vehicle/1000 numbers are only available up to 2009.  But we  have the SAAR data for 2010 and 2011.  Annual average SAAR for 2010 is  11.77; for 2011, it&#8217;s 13.05.  You probably don&#8217;t want to take the values  suggested by Graph 2 too literally, but seeing the vehicle/1000 number  slip to around 815 for 2011 should be a reasonable expectation.  This is  still slightly above the 95% saturation level.</p>
<p>Average  light vehicle SAAR for the first two months of this year is 14.65 &#8211;  right at the break even point for vehicles/1000 population.   </p>
<p> Notes on Graph 2</p>
<p>The  red dots represent data for 2001 and 2002.  The SAAR values look  reasonable.  The changes in vehicles per 1000/population do not.  An  increase of 25 in one year, from 800 to 825, followed by a decrease of  10 in the following year with SAAR, nearly identical (17.46 and 17.15)  makes no sense.  An average of the two, plotted for both years as yellow  dots, by some odd coincidence, lies exactly on the best fit line.</p>
<p>The R^2 value of .43 is less than stellar, but not terrible.</p>
<p>Eliminating the two questionable points raises R^2 to a respectable .65.</p>

<p>Random Thoughts on the Cato Dispute</p>
<p>     Recently there&#8217;s a bit of a to-do about the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/06/us/cato-institute-and-koch-in-rift-over-independence.html?_r=1&#038;pagewanted=all?src=tp">battle for the soul of Cato</a>, one of the big Washington policy think-tanks.  I&#8217;m at best a disinterested observer &#8211; unlike most people weighing in, I have no conceivable stake in the outcome.  I can&#8217;t see any away in which I or any members of my family or friends are or have been in any way compensated by any of the parties involved, nor can I envision any way in which anyone I personally know would gain or lose from whatever happens.*   From that perspective, a few random thoughts&#8230;.   </p>
<p>1.  Both sides in the dispute have a philosophy that the best measure of an idea is the free market.  But it doesn&#8217;t seem like Cato, as an organization, is operating as if that is true.  They are in the business of giving away philosophical policy points, and providing analytic support (much of which is not in accordance with the data if you ask me) for free.  All of that is paid for as a charity, but the philosophy they are promoting is that the market knows best.  And yet, the market doesn&#8217;t seem willing to pay for that philosophy.  Note that the market is quite willing to pay for philosophy, including some similar philosophy:  whatever one thinks of Ayn Rand, people still buy Atlas Shrugs and the Fountainhead.  Ditto much of Heinlein&#8217;s oeuvre.   But how many of the Cato people would have kept body and soul together this far counting on the free market alone?  It seems odd that people would spend their careers to advance an idea when they have taken such extraordinary steps to minimize the effect of that idea on the way they earn their livelihood.    <br /><a name="more"></a>2.  Cato-leaning types of all stripes tend to be against government social programs.  They typically advance a number of arguments against such programs, but one that frequently comes up is dependence: the existence of these programs teach their recipients to be dependent on the government  rather than going out and making a living on the free market, and this process is self-perpetuating.  And yet, this seems to be exactly what the donors to Cato are doing.  They are encouraging those who work at Cato to continue engaging in behavior that is not self-supporting.  If they didn&#8217;t, the folks at Cato might hone their craft sufficiently to produce something which the market would actually buy, which their philosophy says would make everyone better off.</p>
<p>  3.  Whatever happens, I suspect just about everyone involved in any way with Cato, whether as a donor, employee, or reader of their material, will continue try their best to avoid anything that can remotely be construed as a free market outcome.   </p>
<p>* After writing this, I took a quick inventory around the house and realized that the toilet paper (&#8220;Quilted Northern&#8221; brand) we recently purchased was made by Georgia Pacific which is owned by Koch Industries.  Nevertheless, I still believe my association with any of the parties in the Cato flap is de minimus.</p>

<p>Euro Area GDP Report: Not Pretty</p>
<p>Today <a href="http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_PUBLIC/2-06032012-AP/EN/2-06032012-AP-EN.PDF">Eurostat released </a>the second estimate of Q4 2011 Gross Domestic Product. Real Euro area (EA) GDP declined 0.3% over the quarter (-1.3% on an annualized basis). In this release Eurostat provides a breakdown across region, spending categories, and industry, and is much more detailed than the preliminary flash estimate. It’s not pretty.<br />The expenditure side was very weak. Household and government consumption declined 0.4% and 0.2%, respectively, while gross capital formation tumbled 0.7%. Inventory depletion accounted for much of the reduction in investment and fixed investment deteriorated to a lesser degree. Exports fell 0.4%, while imports dropped a full 1.2%; therefore, net exports contributed +0.3% to overall GDP growth. The only positive contribution to GDP growth was imports – this type of technical growth is not sustainable.</p>
<p>As the chart below illustrates, exports has been a major driver of growth during this recovery. However, export demand is dropping off at the margin, and more weakness is expected. The level of new export orders (<a href="http://www.markiteconomics.com/MarkitFiles/Pages/ViewPressRelease.aspx?ID=9206">a component of the Markit PMI</a>) fell for eight consecutive months through February.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/03/GDP_components3.jpg"><img alt="" height="426" src="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/03/GDP_components3.jpg" width="610"></a></p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />So it it’s up to domestic demand to spur further recovery. I also have my doubts there, given that fiscal austerity pushed the unemployment rate to a historical high of 10.7% in January (rather vertically, I might add).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/03/unemployment_chart1.jpg"><img alt="" height="425" src="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/03/unemployment_chart1.jpg" width="635"></a></p>
<p>A second part of the EA GDP report was the disturbing minority of countries that posted positive growth: just three out of thirteen. French growth clearly added balance to the average, given its large weight in the index. However, there are plenty of things that can go wrong there with higher energy costs, the rising <a href="http://www.insee.fr/en/themes/info-rapide.asp?id=14">unemployment rate</a>, and minimal <a href="http://www.insee.fr/en/themes/info-rapide.asp?id=105">business confidence</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/03/Regional_growth1.jpg"><img alt="" height="433" src="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/03/Regional_growth1.jpg" width="610"></a></p>
<p>Going forward, it’s either up or down again for the EA. With the tight fiscal and now tightening monetary policy, the economy surely faces a lot of headwinds – down again would be my bet.</p>

<p>Greg Mankiw attempting to justify carried interest</p>
<p>  Greg Mankiw wrote an op-ed in the Sunday Times Money section: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/04/business/capital-gains-vs-ordinary-income-economic-view.html">Capital Gains, Ordinary Income and Shades of Gray</a>, New York Times (Mar. 4, 2012). </p>
<p>Mankiw notes the historical trend in the US to differentiate between capital gains and ordinary income regarding tax rates (though we have had notable experiements, both in the regular tax and in the AMT, to the contrary). He asserts that there are &#8220;good reasons&#8221; for the preference for capital gains income&#8211;offering only the standard idea of lack of indexation for inflation/deflation as an example.</p>
<p>The purpose of the piece is to justify the carried interest treatment of money managers&#8217; gains from dealing with other people&#8217;s money as equivalent to a carpenter who fixes up a dilapidated house and gets capital gains on the sale of the home, though the gains are really paying off the carpenter&#8217;s sweat equity. Since the carpenter gets capital gains under our system, he says, why shouldn&#8217;t the money manager who does an analogous activity (assuming&#8211;which may be a rather big jump&#8211; that hedge fund, private equity and other money managers are doing &#8220;sweat equity&#8221; that adds to the value of the assets under management, and should be viewed analogously to the carpenter).</p>
<p>The problem with making these analogies, especially in the area of capital gains, is that the idea of capital gains is problematic to start with. We&#8217;d be much better off with a code that made no such distinction, since there are certainly instances where the distinction is an arbitrary one. Since the line drawing isn&#8217;t easy (and it isn&#8217;t), then the distinction shouldn&#8217;t exist at all in the tax code. That would be the right solution overall.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the fact that a category is hard to apply generally doesn&#8217;t mean that there isn&#8217;t a right answer&#8211;or at least a better one&#8211; in particular circumstances. It is particularly inapt to compare money management with rehabilitation of dilapidated property. Rehabilitation of real property adds &#8220;real&#8221; value, in that the property is upgraded and will physically last longer than it would have without rehabilitation. Money managers don&#8217;t necessarily add any value&#8211;they may make money for themselves and others, but there is no real productivity gain in the economy in many (if not most) instances and certainly in any case where the gain is primarily speculative (often the case with hedge funds) or destructive of domestic businesses (often the case with private equity funds). </p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />Private equity fund managers, you will recall, invented the leveraged buyout (or maybe it would be more accurate to say that the idea of the leveraged buyout led to private equity funds). The idea behind leveraged buyouts was to take a stable, money-making company that wasn&#8217;t heavily debt-ridden, load it up with debt to cover the acquisition cost of the company, and use the cash flows from the company to pay off the acquisition debt. Private equity funds like Bain Capital could then leverage a minimal investment of their own with the purchased company&#8217;s debt to get huge profits, once the debt was paid off with good cash flows (already existing out of the company, with nothing due to the &#8220;management&#8221; of the money manager). The better the company taken over was, the more its cash flow could be counted on to pay off the debt, the more leverage would be added, the quicker the debt was paid off, and the better the ultimate profit. Sometimes this takeover was relatively harmless for the &#8220;good&#8221; company, but many times it was harmful&#8211;the takeover changes and debt resulted in focus solely on profits and not on long-term investment, and the company&#8217;s long-term stability was destroyed. The process was seldom positively beneficial for the company over the long term or for its community (though it may have been for particular shareholders and the managers themselves). The point here, of course, is that the LBO was targeted to (already)&#8221;good&#8221; companies with low leverage and high cash flow that could easily borrow in the market to cover the cost of the acquisition.</p>
<p>Later, of course, as the age of financial speculation got fully underway, private equity firms started taking over companies that could never expect to pay back the additional debt the LBO loaded them with. The private equity firms made their money in these cases by driving them into bankruptcy and laying off or firing the workers. Equity firms still got their profits out of the deal by selling off the components. But the companies (and especially their workers) were done for&#8211;if the companies survived at all, they were just parts of some conglomerate with very different functions.<br />Making money from managing other people&#8217;s money, in other words, is not per se productive for the economy as a whole and is not something we should reward with low taxation that acts as an incentive to the activity. We should recognize the money manager&#8217;s take as what it is&#8211;compensation for work done&#8211;and tax accordingly.</p>
<p>As an aside, I&#8217;ll note that it wouldn&#8217;t be unreasonable to have a handyman take ordinary income on his share of the profit that serves as reasonable compensation for his labor, but in most cases that&#8217;s a difficult facts and circumstances issue for the Service to sort out after the fact. One reason carried interest is such an obvious place to repair the problematic categorization of labor income as preferential capital gains is that there will be a partnership and there will be records of &#8220;management fees&#8221; and &#8220;carried interest allocations&#8221;. Given our sophistication about partnership allocations, identifying and classifying the carry as ordinary income is a relatively simple endeavor.</p>

                                <p>My last <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/03/business-roundtable-proposes-obamacare.html">post</a> prompted me to revisit <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/why-we-have-such-a-wacko-health-insurance-system.html">one</a> from last May that I thought Bears might appreciate. For your delectation:</p>
<p>Conservatives love to point out that our employer-based health insurance system is a result of wage controls under FDR. Since employers weren’t able to attract workers with higher wages, they started offering benefits instead — notably health insurance.</p>
<p>I recently read Frank Freidel’s <a href="http://isbn.nu/9780316292610">biography</a> of FDR, and the whole story became clear.</p>
<div>The post-Pearl Harbor economic surge was causing rapid inflation.</div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><p>By March, 1942, food cost almost 5 percent, and clothing 7.7 percent, more than on the day of Pearl Harbor; the cost of living had risen 15 percent since September 1939. [Leon] Henderson predicted prices might rise 23 percent more by the end of 1942. The nation, as Roosevelt well realized, was reaching  the critical point where, as a result of price increases, demands for wage increases could force spiraling inflation.</p></blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>Roosevelt was desperate to prevent that eventuality.</div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><div>Heavier taxes to drain excess buying power were imperative. [This is not complicated; see Abba Lerner on &#8220;Functional Finance.&#8221;]</div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>Conservatives in Congress (then as now) were rabidly anti-tax — gotta protect the monied class — but despite their supposed free-market ideology, they <em>were </em>willing to impose wage controls. (Big surprise.) Roosevelt was able to get this second- or third-best solution through Congress.</div>
<p>So the wage controls that resulted in our ridiculous employer-based health-insurance system were a direct result of conservatives’ hypocrisy.</p>
<p>And now, notwithstanding Ryan’s obviously-never-gonna-happen voucher feint, conservatives have demonstrated themselves to be dead-set on maintaining the status quo of employer-based private health insurance (they had their &#8220;blank piece of paper&#8221; for six years of unfettered control, did nothing about it…) — the very “historical accident” that they so bemoan, and that they are responsible for inflicting on the nation.</p>

<p>And what do they recommend?</p>
<blockquote><p>Creating greater consumer value in the health care marketplace by <strong>using health information technology and empowering consumers with more information about good quality health care</strong>.</p>
<p>Providing more affordable health insurance options for all Americans by <strong>creating an open, all-inclusive private market for health insurance</strong> and replacing today’s fragmented state-by-state market with multistate markets. To ensure that insurance plans are solvent and meet certain minimum requirements, the role of <strong>individual states as the primary regulator should continue</strong>. Broader, more competitive markets will create more choices for more health care consumers.</p>
<p>Engaging all Americans in taking an active role in their health care. First, this means <strong>placing an obligation on all Americans to obtain health insurance either through their employer or the private market</strong>. Second, we must encourage all Americans to participate in employer- or community-based prevention, wellness and chronic care programs.</p>
<p>Offering <strong>health coverage and assistance to low-income, uninsured Americans that create a stable and secure public safety net.</strong> This assistance would be financed from the cost savings and efficiencies generated by a more competitive and value-driven health care system.</p>

                                <p>Eminent New Keynesian Economist <a href="http://ideas.repec.org/f/pba274.html">Susanto Basu</a> commented on a post challenging people to come up with an empirically useful idea in macroeconomics not to be found in &#8220;The General Theory of Employment Interest and Money.&#8221;  Here I will just note again how incredibly polite New Keynesians tend to be. bold numbers added for future reference </p>
<blockquote><p>This is a great challenge. I am answering off the top of my head, and will probably think of things I want to add later. Empirical findings that seem hard to explain without forward-looking expectations: [1] Mankiw, Miron and Weil on interest rates and the founding of the Fed (AER, 198?), [2] Sargent on the quick remonetization of economies ending hyperinflation, and probably most importantly [3] the empirical work in Milton Friedman&#8217;s Theory of the Consumption Function. Apropos that last, since a lot of what you say is about consumption, the recent micro research on consumption is much more nuanced than your portrayal. One of the best recent papers is Hsieh (2003, AER), which shows that the PIH works very well for large, predictable income changes but *among the same people* quite badly for small and irregular changes. This finding points to the need for refinements of models based on forward-looking expectations (like costly information processing) rather than their wholesale removal. Cochrane (1989, AER) is insightful on this point. Apropos aggregate data and excess sensitivity, I would point to my paper with Miles Kimball (http://www.umich.edu/~mkimball/pdf/cee_oct02-3.pdf), which tries to challenge the interpretation of the famous Campbell-Mankiw papers. Shifting from data to models qua insightful stories, I think it&#8217;s pretty clear that Keynes makes sense only with substantial nominal rigidities. Now I stand foursquare for the importance of sluggish nominal wage and price adjustment in lots of circumstances and for long periods of time, but even I have a hard time saying that decade-long events like the Great Depression or Japan in the 1990s are due to price inflexibility over such long periods of time. (And yes, I know Tobin/DeLong-Summers on destabilizing price flexibility. But still.) For something on that scale, I find multiple-equilibrium models like Diamond (1982) or Benhabib-Farmer (1994) much more appealing intuitively. [4] But I don&#8217;t think one can tell those stories without rational expectations&#8211;at least not easily. Benhabib-Farmer show conditions under which the steady state becomes a sink rather than being saddlepoint-stable in the forward dynamics. But my guess is that if you put in backward-looking expectations, the sink would turn into a source, and the multiple equilibria would disappear. This is all about intuition and telling just-so stories with models rather than anything with clear empirical support, but I would say that&#8217;s also the appeal of Keynes. Thanks for making me come up with reasons why I think modern macro isn&#8217;t all a waste! I look forward to your thoughts. Susanto Basu</p></blockquote>
<p>I answer the answer to the challenge after the jump.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>[1] I haven&#8217;t read &#8220;Mankiw, Miron and Weil on interest rates and the founding of the Fed (AER, 198?)&#8221;.  I will just note that I aaked for a prediction and this paper was written after the founding of the Fed.  </p>
<p>[2]  &#8220;Sargent on the quick remonetization of economies ending hyperinflation.&#8221;  This time I won&#8217;t just note that it isn&#8217;t a prediction, because it is in &#8220;The General Theory &#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>2) Sargent (relying on the hard boring archival research of economic historians) noted that at the end of four hyperinflations the Phillips curve was vertical.  Keynes relying on casual empiricism said the same thing (not similar the same).  The following passage is incomprehensible without context (and uncharacteristically turgid in context) but it is Sargent&#8217;s observation.  </p>
<p>The General Theory &#8230; chapter 21 section 6</p>
<p><i>&#8220;e without suffix ( = Mdp/pdM) stands for the apex of this pyramid and measures the response of money-prices to changes in the quantity of money.</p>
<p>[skip] </p>
<p>&#8220;But in general e is not unity; and it is, perhaps, safe to make the generalisation that on plausible assumptions relating to the real world, and excluding the case of a “flight from the currency” in which ed and ew become large, e is, as a rule, less than unity.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>In English, the claim is that in the case of hyperinflation &#8220;flight from the currency&#8221; an increase in the money  causes a proportional increase in the price level so no effect on output or employmen (OK it is possible that he thought e would be greater than 1 in case of hyperinflation so increased prices would cause reduced real balances as claimed (with data) by Cagan).  Having been alive in 1923 Keynes had noted that the end of the German hyperinflation was not accompanied by a sharp decline in employment.  I think Sargent set up and knocked down a straw man.  He certainly didn&#8217;t cite Keynes or any old Keynesian claiming that there was a sloping Phillips curve in e.g. Germany in the 20s.</p>
<p>[4] Not in order.  Benhabib and Farmer have interesting models.  In fact it is much much easier to get models in which sunspots matter if one doesn&#8217;t assume rational expectations.  The hard part in these models is to find a way that an asset price (or shadow price) can be different from the steady state (or balanced growth &#8212; that is steady state for the properly scaled variables) without exploding.  This is hard if an asset value equation is imposed &#8212; that is hard exactly if one assumes rational expectations.  If one allows irrational exuberance and/or panics everything is much too easy &#8212; trivally easy in fact. That&#8217;s why the papers always impose rationality.  I think that Benhabib and Farmer are on to something, but that is a hope not a confirmed prediction.</p>
<p>As an aside, I note that there is a quite different way to get stability and indeterminacy.  Different enough to be published anyway.  See</p>
<p>Alessandra Pelloni and Robert Waldmann (1998) &#8220;Stability Properties of a growth Model,&#8221; Economics Letters, vol. 61 pp 55-60.</p>
<p>I can promise you that this model has exactly zero influence on my thoughts about the economy.  Mathematically it works just as well as the Benhabib Farmber models, but I am absolutely sure that it has nothing to do with reality.  Speculation about any possible conflict between co-authors due to this freequently stated certainty would not be appreciated.</p>
<p>[3] &#8220;the empirical work in Milton Friedman&#8217;s Theory of the Consumption Function. Apropos that last, since a lot of what you say is about consumption, the recent micro research on consumption &#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>The PIH.  Look I wasn&#8217;t always like this.  I used to be only 90% alienated from the mainstream.  I have said (in lectures) that the PIH is partly true, explains facts which seemed mysterious and is not in &#8220;The General Theory &#8230;&#8221;.  In fact the challenge used to include &#8220;except for the PIH&#8221;.  But then I had an alarming thought (see below).</p>
<p>Keynes considered the effect of expected future income on current consumption.  Relying as always on casual empiricism (it is hard to run regressions with almost no data and no computer) he guessed that expected future income must be considered to explain individual consumption but also that it is not useful in explaining aggregate consumption.</p>
<p>&#8220;The General Theory &#8230;&#8221; Chapter 8 section 2 point 6</p>
<p><i>(6) Changes in expectations of the relation between the present and the future level of income. — We must catalogue this factor for the sake of formal completeness. But, whilst it may affect considerably a particular individual’s propensity to consume, it is likely to average out for the community as a whole. Moreover, it is a matter about which there is, as a rule, too much uncertainty for it to exert much influence.</i></p>
<p>Much evidence that there is something to the PIH (glass half full&#8211; there must be at least some liquidity constrained consumers to fit the facts) is based on micro data.  This tends to confirm Keynes&#8217;s guess as usual.  I note that his mention of &#8220;uncertainty&#8221; seems to appeal to his &#8220;Treatise on Probability&#8221; which I haven&#8217;t read.  He does not assume that agents have a subjective probability distribution and maximize expected utility.  He considers the possibility that, if something is highly uncertain, people will just put it out of their minds.  I think he is right.  This is much much further from contemporary practice than  just assuming that people don&#8217;t have rational expectations so their subjective probability distribution does not correspond to the objective probability distribution conditional on information available to them.  It is an explanation (using the word very loosely) of why people might act myopic regarding aggregates even if the data should give them some ability to forecast GDP and the price level.</p>
<p>OK what about reality ? Is there any evidence that forecasting future aggregate income is a useful step in forecasting or fitting aggregate consumption ? Hmmm well first, as predicted by the PIH for some stochastic processes of aggregate income, the coefficient of variation of consumption is lower than that of income.  For other stochastic processes, this is a problem for the PIH (excess smoothness).  Given the state of the debate (when last I checked long ago) this is about 0 evidence for or against the PIH.  There are other explanations.  One (very important to old Keynesian models and I admit based in large part on what Keynes wrote) is that consumption is a constant &#8220;autonomous consumption&#8221; plus a constant times disposable income.  This silly model incorrectly implies that the ratio of consumption to income should decline as per capita income increases.  Also poor people violate their lifetime budget constraint somehow.  </p>
<p>I really don&#8217;t think Keynes was that silly.  In particular he presented another explanation for the smoothness of consumption ( which implies an interpretation of &#8220;autonomous consumption not as an exogenous constant but as a predetermined endogenous state variable) <br />chapter 8 section 3 paragraph 3</p>
<p>&#8220;This is especially the case where we have short periods in view, as in the case of the so-called cyclical fluctuations of employment during which habits, as distinct from more permanent psychological propensities, are not given time enough to adapt themselves to changed objective circumstances. For a man’s habitual standard of life usually has the first claim on his income, and he is apt to save the difference which discovers itself between his actual income and the expense of his habitual standard; or, if he does adjust his expenditure to changes in his income, he will over short periods do so imperfectly. Thus a rising income will often be accompanied by increased saving, and a falling income by decreased saving, on a greater scale at first than subsequently.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ah habit formation.  Is there really evidence which supports the PIH against the hypothesis of myopia combined with habit formation ?  The second is the Marglin model of consumption.  It is definitely anticipated by Keynes.  The alarming thought is that habit formation explains the cross sectional patterns which are also explained by the PIH (eg the fact that for the same current income African Americans have lower consumption than white Americans).  Consumption is not just a function of current income.  But does it work better to consider the discounted stream of future income or a geometric average of past income (as would be true in the model of myopia and habit formation).  Especially is there macro evidence which distinguishes the two ?</p>
<p>Well the PIH implies Ricardian equivalence and the myopic habit model doesn&#8217;t.  Uh the evidence is not kind to the PIH on this.  OK look across countries there are some countries with persistently rapid growth and others with slow growth.  Other things (especially r) equal, the PIH says rapid growth countries should have high C/Y.  The myopic habit models say they should have low C/Y.  They have low C/Y.  OK OK given the correlation of S and I, this could be just low C/Y causes high growth (it is two facts that the variance in savings rates is high compared to the variance of current account surpluses and that the correlation is not one).  But the evidence, such as it is, is again unkind to the PIH. </p>
<p>I&#8217;d say Keynes on consumption reads a whole lot like an informal summary of recent empirical research on consumption (note also the bit about precautionary savings which I haven&#8217;t mentioned yet). </p>
<p>Chapter 9 section 1 point 1</p>
<p><i>&#8220;There are, in general, eight main motives or objects of a subjective character which lead individuals to refrain from sepdning out of their incomes<br />(i) To build up a reserve against unforeseen contingencies&#8221;<br /></i></p>
<p>I note that Hsieh (2003 AER) tends to confirm Keynes&#8217; guess.</p>
