<blockquote>Nonfarm employment increased by 167,000 in December, and the unemployment rate was unchanged at 4.5 percent</p></blockquote>
<p>The Household Survey reports an increase in employment equal to 303,000, which was enough to increase the employment-population from 63.3% to 63.4%.  The unemployment rate did not decline, however, because the labor force participation rate increased from 66.3% to 66.4%.  </p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Lately there have been a number of stories about the US eventually having a foreign legion.  Foreign legions have been before&#8230; the French have one, and the Romans of course.  I don&#8217;t know about the French foreign legion, and all I know about the Roman legions comes from the little bit I read.  But I do have some questions&#8230;</p>
<p>1.  To whom will the legionairres have loyalty?  In theory, it would be to the US, but in practice, even regular soldiers in a battle situation generally see their loyalty as to the troops fighting beside them, not to God and Country.  In the Roman legions, loyalty generally was toward the commanding officer of the legion.  Every so often, one or another commanding officer took advantage of the situation and marched on Rome itself.  Rotating commanding officers around or having a bureaucracy might solve such a problem.   </p>
<p>2.  What happens when there is an excuse to reduce the size of the military.  Think the Peace Dividend with the fall of the Soviet Union.  Say every militant Islamist on earth becomes a Southern Baptist.  You can&#8217;t just cut the size of the military when the troops need to serve a certain amount of time (20 years?) in order to get their citizenship.  Well, you can, but then you piss off the guys with guns.  And if African dictators have learned anything, its that you keep the guys with guns happy at all costs.  Even if nobody else eats, they do.</p>
<p>3.  What happens if enough legionairres have a sufficiently different perspective than most Americans?  We might end up with most recruits coming from Africa and the Middle East.  </p>
<p>4.  The odds of a recruit fighting against a country toward which he has some loyalty go up.  Is that a good thing?</p>
<p>What else is there?  What are the pros and cons?  Your thoughts?</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>AB readers may or may not realize that I’m a big fan of Dean Baker’s <a href="http://www.prospect.org/deanbaker/2007/01/the_2004_deficit_was_not_a_rec.html#014985">Beat the Press</a> and that I differ from Dean’s wisdom only once in a Blue Moon.  But it’s a Blue Moon today:<br />
<blockquote>The Washington Post claims that the federal deficit hit a record $413 billion in 2004. While this is a record in nominal dollars, that is a meaningless number, as I trust the Post&#8217;s reporter knows. The deficit in 1983 was $207.8 billion. That was smaller in nominal dollars than the 2004 deficit, but so what? The U.S. economy was less than one-third as large in 1983.</p></blockquote>
<p>Dean is reporting the nominal increase in the Federal debt held by the public – for which I have a couple of quibbles.  Quibble one relates to the difference between nominal interest expenses v. real interest expenses, that is, the difference between the deficit in terms of the increase in nominal debt versus the increase in real debt.  Quibble 2 – which is one that I can hammering on – has to due with the fact that the main reason why the unified deficit has declined of late is that the Trust Fund surpluses have increased.  In other words, I’m a General Fund kind of Bear so pardon me while I report the real increase in total Federal debt.  Before I do so, let me be fair to Dean but noting the rest of his post:<br />
<blockquote>The 1983 deficit was equal to 6.0 percent of GDP.  The 2004 deficit was only 3.6 percent of GDP. Even adding in the money borrowed from Social Security only brings the 2004 deficit to 4.9 percent of GDP, still more than 1.0 percentage points below the post-war peak in 1983. The current deficits are larger than can be sustained, but there is no reason to try to mislead readers to make things sound more scary. Reality is bad enough.</p></blockquote>
<p>OK, my two cents.  Reporting all figures in terms of 2000$, total Federal debt rose by $280 billion during fiscal year 1983. During fiscal year 2004, the real debt rose by $368 billion.  The former represents 5.17% of real GDP for calendar year 1983, while the latter represents only 3.44% of real GDP for calendar year 2004.  So by my measure, Dean is still correct.  </p>
<p>But there is another consideration in this comparison.  I think most economists would agree that while 1983 was a recovery year, we were still far below full employment.  While we were below full employment in 2003, the GDP gap in 2003 was not anything close to the GDP gap in 1982.  The White House may have be wrong during the 2004 Presidential campaign when they boosted about the 2004 economy being just great – the GDP gap in 2004 was less than the GDP gap in 2003.  I’m not ready this evening to recast this comparison in terms of the standardized deficit – but something tells me that 1983 would look all that bad when compared to 2004.</p>

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>One of the big issues that drives voters in this country is abortion.  Of course, it often doesn’t drive voters to vote coherently, as those who claim to be the most concerned about reducing the number of abortions tend to <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/10/abortions-and-unwed-mothers-by-numbers.html">vote for candidates that aren’t particularly good at reducing that number</a>.</p>
<p>Anyway, I don’t want to start by talking about abortions, but rather, about homeless people.  The other day I was in downtown LA, and I happened by skid-row.  I started thinking about the homeless, and I was thinking about what would happen if a homeless guy showed up at the front door of one of the rest of us.  Let’s assume the homeless was guy was “deserving poor” as opposed to some wino or addict, and though he was down and out, he managed to keep himself clean and relatively presentable, and he’s quite personable with a cheerful attitude.  Of course, that whole last sentence is kind of irrelevant… presumably, we would just want the guy off the front porch and our property in general.</p>
<p>Sadly, we can’t just shoot the guy… and its not just because of the mess.  You may find it hard to believe, but even though he’s poor and on our property the law won’t allow us to just shoot the bastard.  (I checked.)  Still, the law does say we have the right to have him off our property, and if he can’t or won’t go, the cops will take him off.  </p>
<p>Now let’s add to the story.  Let’s say he was hungry… perhaps he hasn’t eaten in a few days.  And he doesn’t have money to buy food.  How does this change the story?  Well, it doesn’t.  The guy has the right to stagger off our property and starve on the street or to be dragged off by the cops, in which he case he can starve wherever they happen to take him – the second option is better since we won’t have to call anyone to have the carcass hauled away if he doesn’t drop dead in front of the house.</p>
<p>Does the story change if somehow we’re at fault for his predicament?  Perhaps if we had him fired from his job, or if we polluted the water he breathed at one point, causing him to have headaches that prevented him from working and led to the downward spiral?  Not just no, hell no, the story does not change.  What if its not a homeless man – what if it’s a homeless child?  What a stupid idea!  Of course that makes no difference either.  We still have the right to have the kid removed from our property.  Yes, the cops might take the kid to Child Services or whatever, but the key is that its not our damn problem, and if the kid wants to starve so be it, and we have the right to get him to do it somewhere else.  What if its your child?  I don’t know anything about adoption law, but I would imagine people are free to disown and otherwise give up their children should they choose.</p>
<p>You, the reader, of course know where I’m going with this.  The next step is to ask – so what is the difference between not having any obligation to keep a child alive in your home for longer than it takes the cops to show up and drag the kid away and not having any obligation to keep a child in your womb for nine months?  Also, why does it seem that the folks that are most concerned about a person’s right to defend their property from others are the most concerned that a woman might view her womb the same way?</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/03/AR2007010301619.html">George Will</a> wants to abolish the minimum wage:<br />
<blockquote>But the minimum wage should be the same everywhere: $0. Labor is a commodity; governments make messes when they decree commodities&#8217; prices. Washington, which has its hands full delivering the mail and defending the shores, should let the market do well what Washington does poorly.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you are offended by the suggestion that people are nothing more than commodities – so is <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2007_01/010514.php">Kevin Drum</a>:<br />
<blockquote>This, in a nutshell, is the core problem with conservative economics: it views workers as commodities. Naturally it follows from this that we should be free to treat workers like commodities, rather than as human beings.</p></blockquote>
<p>But Will is very wrong on the economics for several reasons.  For example, he writes:<br />
<blockquote>The problem is that demand for almost everything is elastic: When the price of something goes up, demand for it goes down.</p></blockquote>
<p>I guess Will has not reviewed the empirical evidence which seems to suggest that when the real value of the minimum wage is increased by x%, the decline in employment is less than x%.  Economists can debate what is driving this evidence – with one possibility being that the assumption that labor markets are perfectly competitive is simply always the case.  But there is also something quite amiss about Will assuming workers are nothing more than commodities.  In his own words, workers receive different wages from the market place: <br />
<blockquote>Most of the working poor earn more than the minimum wage, and most of the 0.6 percent (479,000 in 2005) of America&#8217;s wage workers earning the minimum wage are not poor.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, there are differences among people, which is evident when one looks at the wide variations in wages received.  Yet, Will claims the labor market is a commodity market?  Incidentally, Mr. Will should check with the <a href="http://www.bls.gov/cps/minwage2005.htm">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>: <br />
<blockquote>Of those paid by the hour, 479,000 were reported as earning exactly $5.15, the prevailing Federal minimum wage. Another 1.4 million were reported as earning wages below the minimum</p></blockquote>

                                <p>I find that economics is a useful way to approach most problems.  However, sometimes, economics cannot take you all the way to the end, and some amount of, well, something else – perhaps morality, perhaps something else, must be added to the mix.  As a result, when looking at the tough questions, often a bit of one’s owns unsupported opinions creep in.  This post is an attempt to look at such a question, and to keep the ratio of analysis to bias as high as possible.  Whether I succeed or not… well, that’s what the comment section is for.</p>
<p>In the end, an economist has only one tool – if done right, every problem can be reduced to motivations and constraints.  Usually, that means figuring out what each party considers its costs and its benefits.  Now, the problem is that one of the motivations that many people have is to impose their costs on other people.  As a result, in order for a market to produce the Invisible Hand socially optimal outcome (which is the point of capitalism, after all), property rights and rules must be set up in such a way to force each party to bear the costs of his/her decisions, as opposed to putting them on someone else.</p>
<p>And now for something completely different….  (I always wanted to segue Monty Python style.)  In principal, I am in favor of the death penalty.  In practice, it’s a bit harder – there are enough problems with the legal system, not the least of which are <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/01/declining-real-wages-for-supreme-court.html">overpaid</a> <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/09/rant-about-attorneys.html">elitists</a> like Roberts making decisions that you gotta worry about wrong convictions.  Still, there are some cases where its difficult to envision a mistake being made – Charles Manson, for instance, will never be executed, but I don’t think anyone has any doubts about his innocence.</p>
<p>Let’s consider one of those incontrovertible cases….  a Ted Bundy or a Richard Ramirez.  Now, the convict has already imposed massive externalities on others – those who have been brutally murdered have paid the ultimate price.  But there are others who have paid a very high price for decisions made by the convict as well, namely the families and the friends of the victims.  </p>
<p>It seems to me to be compounding the injustice to ask taxpayers that have already lost so much to the killer to pay, through their taxes, to keep the killer alive – I believe it costs about $25,000 a year to keep someone in jail.  Now, there are those who would argue that this is no argument for imposing the death penalty, since doing so is also expensive.  But, imposing the death penalty is expensive in large part because those who oppose it throw up barriers.  If the same barriers were thrown up in front of giving people life sentences, or even sentences of more than 20 years, the costs for such sentences would be almost equally high.</p>
<p>Not all costs, of course, are pecuniary.  Presumably, it is cheaper to send in some goons to beat some child killer to death than it is to strap him into a gas chamber or an electric chair.  However, the costs to civilization of doing so are large.  Even the act of killing someone can be accomplished with various degrees of barbarity or civilization.</p>
<p>Your thoughts?</p>
<p>(BTW… I intend to look at abortion using the same tools in an upcoming post.  Please leave that discussion for another day.)</p>

<p>The President decided to write an <a href="http://www.opinionjournal.com/editorial/feature.html?id=110009473">WSJ oped</a> that was incredibly dishonest on a host of topics but let’s stick to the economic issues – such as growth, employment, and our yes – paying down the Federal debt.  Conservative <a href="http://voxbaby.blogspot.com/2007/01/new-years-plea.html">Andrew Samwick</a> mocks the Laffer curve claim that lower tax rates lead to more revenues, while liberal <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2007/01/bush_what_the_c.html">Mark Thoma</a> goes after the general claim that the tax cuts were a cause for the alleged increased economic growth.  </p>
<p>But wait a second here.  Real GDP as of 2006QIII was only 16.34% higher than it was as of 2000QIII, which means the average annual growth rate has been a mere 2.55% over the past six years.  Payroll employment in November 2006 exceeded payroll employment in November 2000 by only 3.692 million, which translates into 51,000 new jobs per month on average over the past six years.  So when President Bush writes:<br />
<blockquote>America&#8217;s priorities also include keeping our economy strong. The elections have not reversed the laws of economics. It is a fact that economies do best when you reward hard work by allowing people to keep more of what they have earned. And we have seen that businesses can expand and hire more workers when they have more money to invest &#8211; and since August 2003, America&#8217;s employers have added more than seven million new jobs. It is also a fact that our tax cuts have fueled robust economic growth and record revenues.</p></blockquote>
<p>One has to wonder what he’s been smoking.  First of all – the premise that one cannot reverse “laws of economics” is just stupid as economists do not write laws.  OK, economists often tell their students about the “law of scarcity”, which is a basic principle of economics that these free lunch “supply-side” fools never understood.  These supply-siders are touting the fact that growth during the last three years has exceeded the paltry growth of the prior three years.  Whether one is a Keynesian or not – most economists recognize that aggregate demand driven deviations from full employment tend to reverse themselves.  The investment led recession motivated the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates for a while.  </p>
<p>Whether the Bush tax cuts and other forms of fiscal stimulus (yes, government purchases increased) helped or hurt the Federal Reserve efforts can be debated.  The standard Keynesian view is that reducing national savings via fiscal stimulus increases aggregate demand, but the Bush approach to maximizing the long-term aspect of fiscal stimulus while screwing up the short-term aspect of fiscal policy may be one reason why the current recovery took so long and has been so anemic.  After all, all schools of economics recognize that reducing national savings lowers investment by driving up interest rates.   But you say interest rates have been low.  But lately real interest rates have been drifting up as noted in another great discussion from <a href="http://www.econbrowser.com/archives/2007/01/low_real_rates.html">Menzie Chinn</a>. </p>
<p>The title of this post draws its inspiration as well as some of its evidence from my AB colleague <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/01/what-difference-gw-makes.html">cactus</a> who reminds us of the 2001 <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/usbudget/blueprint/bud01.html">Economic Blueprint</a> where President Bush had the gall to suggest that under his fiscal policies would allow the Federal debt held by the public would decline from 35.1% as of 2000 to only 6.5%.  Our graph shows the projection debt held by the public (DHP-p) versus what we have seen so far in terms of the actual debt held by the public (DHP-a).  Did you notice that through 2007, actual debt as a percent of GDP has increased not declined?  But you protest as the last two data points are the White House projections.  What did cactus say?<br />
<blockquote>But his goal of cutting the deficit in half &#8211; cutting an inflated projected deficit that never occurred, wasn&#8217;t the plan on which he ran for office back in 2000.</p></blockquote>
<p>That’s right, the Economic Report of the President has lately included bogus high marks for the projected unified deficit so the Liar-in-Chief can claim we cut the unified deficit in half.  But that’s not my main problem with the garbage accounting from the incredibly dishonest White House.  Take a look at the total Federal debt (TFD) to GDP ratio.  Its rate of increase – the General Fund deficit – has not decreased.  That’s correct boys and girls, any decrease in the unified deficit is attributable to an increase in those Trust Fund surpluses.  Never mind the Thief-in-Chief wishes to steal your retirement benefits. </p>
<p>Our graph starts in 1996 for a simple reason: the total Federal debt to GDP ratio rose from 32.6% in 1981 to 67.3% because we were stupid enough to listen to the free-lunch liars who advised President Reagan back in 1981.  No, his tax cuts did not raise economic growth.  Rather they reduced investment and long-term growth just like the Bush tax cuts have.  The reversal of this fiscal insanity during the 1990’s did not lead to a 1993 recession as many Republicans predicted.  No – the Clinton years were marked with strong economic growth and an eventual reversal of that mushrooming total Federal debt to GDP ratio.  And regardless of how many lies President Bush packed into that WSJ op-ed, this ratio is expected to hit 67.5% by the end of 2007.  And if fiscal policy is not changed – this ratio will continue to rise.</p>

                                <p>I’m no attorney, but my understanding is that political campaign donations are largely considered to be speech.  If I understand correctly, the idea is that the First Amendment not only gives me the right to speak, it also gives me the right to let someone else speak for me.  Since I can use my resources to publicize my own speech, I should be able to use my resources to publicize speech someone else makes in my stead.</p>
<p>There’s a problem with that…  There are costs to speech.  For example, I can say I think Greg Mankiw is a hack and there will likely be no consequences.  However, if I outright call Greg Mankiw a hack, I can be sued for libel.  </p>
<p>Similarly, if a PAC calls a Jack a hack, the Jack can whack the PAC with a suit.  But, I, as a donor, am not subject to the suit.  So if donating money to a PAC is free speech, it seems to be a very strange kind of free speech, one with no consequences.  I would think it makes sense to either put limits on money in politics, or to open up donations to the same sort of libel laws to which regular speech is subject.</p>

                                <p>&#8220;The elections have not reversed the laws of economics.&#8221;<br />          G W Bush, January 3, 2007</p>
<p>So there&#8217;s an <a href="http://www.opinionjournal.com/editorial/feature.html?id=110009473">op ed</a> &#8220;written&#8221; by George Bush in today&#8217;s Wall Street Journal.  I&#8217;m sure others will go through the piece and find discrepancies.  I gotta get to work, so I&#8217;ll just share my favorite. (Long time readers may know what&#8217;s coming&#8230;)</p>
<p>GW tells us:  &#8220;[W]e met our goal of cutting the deficit in half three years ahead of schedule. By continuing these policies, we can balance the federal budget by 2012 while funding our priorities and making the tax cuts permanent.&#8221;  </p>
<p>How fiscally responsible.  So he&#8217;s ahead of schedule.  But his goal of cutting the deficit in half &#8211; cutting an inflated projected deficit that never occurred, wasn&#8217;t the plan on which he ran for office back in 2000.  It also wasn&#8217;t in his <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/usbudget/blueprint/bud01.html">Economic Blueprint</a> rolled out with great fanfare in February 2001.   In fact, his economic plan wasn&#8217;t about cutting deficits &#8211; there were no deficits.  That plan said things like:</p>
<p>&#8220;The President&#8217;s plan will accelerate this trend to record rates by retiring an historic $2 trillion in debt over the next 10 years. Under the President&#8217;s budget, the national debt will be only seven percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2011, its lowest share in more than 80 years.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Contrast that with the current plan&#8230; to balance the budget by 2012.  What a difference a GW makes&#8230; </p>
<p>Indeed, when viewed from today, the Economic Blueprint reads like comedy gold, having such gems as:</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed, the President&#8217;s Budget pays down the debt so aggressively that it runs into an unusual problem—its annual surpluses begin to outstrip the amount of maturing debt starting in 2007. This means that the United States will be effectively unable to retire any more debt than what is assumed in the Administration&#8217;s Budget over the next 10 years—the President achieves &#8220;maximum possible debt retirement&#8221; in his budget.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another beaut:</p>
<p>&#8220;The Administration&#8217;s Budget does just what Chairman Greenspan recommends. It continues to pay down a historic amount of debt at a record rate as long as practicable. However, it also lays out an agenda for gradually reducing the on-budget surplus in order to minimize the risks of a build-up in excess cash and Government purchase of private assets in the future. Even with its tax cut, the Administration still projects that $1.3 trillion in excess cash will remain in 2011. This cash would be available for Social Security reform and other priorities.&#8221;</p>
<p>If a used car salesman pulled this kind of bait and switch, he wouldn&#8217;t survive in business very long.  Why anyone would take this man seriously about anything any more I have no idea.</p>

                            </p>
                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Every so often, the idea of simplifying the tax code comes around.  I&#8217;m no expert on taxes&#8230; I did work for (the most miserable year of my life) for one of the then Big 6 Accounting firms, but nobody will ever confuse me with an accountant or tax attorney, at least not one with anything remotely resembling competence.  </p>
<p>The impression I got is that a of the complication that exists is there because someone wants it to exist &#8211; one exemption or another for whatever.  Presumably, all those exemptions could be eliminated and tax rates lowered a bit.  It would be easy to do, at least for individual taxes.</p>
<p>Corporate taxes are a bit tougher.  What constitutes a legitimate expense in one industry doesn&#8217;t always constitute a legitimate expense in another.  The end result are a bunch of &#8220;businesspeople&#8221; who use their &#8220;company car&#8221; only for &#8220;legitimate business reasons&#8221;, namely their daily activities.  I really don&#8217;t have any solutions at the small business level.</p>
<p>But for large corporations&#8230;.  well, someone noted on one of the recent threads (sorry &#8211; my memory is just not dredging up details) at this blog that profits as declared to investors has been growing much more quickly than profits as declared to the IRS.  That makes sense &#8211; companies have an incentive to declare low profits to the IRS (to pay lower taxes) and high profits to investors (to attract dollars and boost stock price).</p>
<p>Why not use require both to be the same?  It might not solve transfer pricing issue, but perhaps it would go a some way toward reducing tax fraud or abuse.  Your thoughts?</p>
