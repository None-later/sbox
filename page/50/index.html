                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>We are a country not just divided, but fragmented along axes of race,  age, religion, economic status and geography.  There are now 15 States  where citizens have filed petitions <a href="http://m.now.msn.com/15-states-start-petitons-to-leave-the-usa">to secede from the Union</a>.  &#8220;<i>These  include Louisiana (which led the charge), the Republic of Texas,  Kentucky, Colorado, New Jersey, Montana, North Dakota, Indiana,  Mississippi, North Carolina, Alabama, Florida, Georgia and Oregon</i>.&#8221;  I don&#8217;t know which is number 15, but I&#8217;m gong to guess Oklahoma.  </p>
<p>I&#8217;m  not going to get flip about it.  While these petitions have virtually  no chance of achieving anything, it&#8217;s important to remember two things:</p>
<p>1)  You never hear anything like this when Republicans win.<br />2)  All but 4 of these states represent the (since 1965) <a href="http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/2012/results/">solid Republican South</a>.</p>
<p>Another  geographic dimension is urban vs rural.  When I do get flip, I say  Obama won everywhere that people outnumber cattle, deer, goats or  alligators.  This comes distressingly close to being the truth.  Look at  the electoral map of just about any State.  I like to consider Ohio,  since it is my home State and in many ways represents the U.S. in  miniature.  But pick a State at random [or Texas in particular] and  you&#8217;ll probably see the same scenario.   The <a href="http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/2012/results/ohio">Ohio electoral map</a> shows that Obama carried 16 of Ohio&#8217;s 88 counties.  Half of these are  strung along the Lake Erie shore, four more are contiguous in the  densely populated north-east corner, and the other four contain  Columbus, Dayton, Cincinnati and Athens.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not  ambitious enough to undertake the study, but I&#8217;ll hypothesize that  Obama&#8217;s vote percentage in each county is directly proportional to the  total population &#8211; and this in a State where the counties don&#8217;t vary  much in physical size.  Consider that Lucas Co. [essentially my home  town, Toledo] with 198,000 votes cast went for Obama by 64 to 34%, while  Mercer Co. along the IN border with 21,000 votes cast went for Romney  by 77 to 22%.  You can find these kinds of results all over the country.</p>
<p>Another divide is along <a href="http://forums.gardenweb.com/forums/load/hottopics/msg1209375230522.html">education level</a>.   Among the 15 States with the best public school systems, Obama carried  13, while among the 15 States with the worst public school systems,  Romney carried 12.  I see this as a big component in the recent  Republican war on education.  One thing you develop as a result of good  education is a set of critical thinking skills, which then give you the  ability to see through nonsense peddlers like Rush, Trump, and the whole  Fox roster.</p>
<p>All of this tends to make me pessimistic  about our nations future.  But I see rays of hope amidst the great  divide.  Even in Georgia, which went 53 to 45% for Romney, you find  Obama winning by huge margins in Atlanta, Macon, Augusta, Columbus,  Savannah, and Albany.</p>
<p>Plus, another thing is happening that you have to see a <a href="http://blu.stb.s-msn.com/i/9E/7C97D308B1C896D58FC9AAEEB71D_h231_w308_m4_cZXQyhRYy.jpg">country-wide county level electoral map</a> to notice.</p>
<div><a href="http://blu.stb.s-msn.com/i/9E/7C97D308B1C896D58FC9AAEEB71D_h231_w308_m4_cZXQyhRYy.jpg"><img border="0" height="300" src="http://blu.stb.s-msn.com/i/9E/7C97D308B1C896D58FC9AAEEB71D_h231_w308_m4_cZXQyhRYy.jpg" width="400"></a></div>
<p>There  is a blue streak that starts along the Mississippi river valley where  Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi converge and runs almost  continuously through Alabama, Georgia and the Carolinas to join with the  blue States along the coast.</p>
<p>I call it the band of  sanity running through the South, and it might just represent an  opportunity for progressives to build on going forward.</p>

<p>Is it a fiscal cliff or merely a bump in the road?</p>
<p>Sixty percent of American voters in exit polls indicated that they supported higher taxes for the wealthy, see <a href="http://democrats.senate.gov/2012/11/08/on-taxes-the-voters-have-spoken/">here</a>.  Even some arch conservatives are acknowledging that some tax increases won&#8217;t do terrible harm.  Id. (noting that the Wall Street Journal&#8217;s Stephen Moore acknowledged that Obama &#8220;can claim that he&#8217;s got a voter mandate to do that [raise taxes on the rich].&#8221; Even Conservative Weekly Standard Editor Bill Kristol counseled Republican leadership to get real.</p>
<p>You know what? It won&#8217;t kill the country if Republicans raise taxes a littlbe bit on millionaires.  It really won&#8217;t, I don&#8217;t think.  &#8230;  Really? The Republican party is gonna fall on its sword to defend a bunch of millionaires, half of whom voted Democratic, and half of whom live in Hollywood and are hostile to Republicans?  Nicole Flatow, <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2012/11/11/1176641/weekly-standard-editor-bill-kristol-raising-millionaires-taxes-wont-kill-the-country/?utm_source=PolicyMic+Newsletter&#038;utm_campaign=1172c11df5-New_Newsletter2_29_2012&#038;utm_medium=email&#038;mobile=nc">Weekly Standard Editor Bill Kristol: Raising Millionaires&#8217; Taxes &#8216;Won&#8217;t Kill the Country&#8217;</a>, ThinkProgress (Nov. 11, 2012).</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the House and Senate Republican leadership (Rep. Boehner and Sen. McConnell) are insisting that they will not allow tax rates to rise.   McConnell told Breitbart.com the following:<br />
<blockquote><strong>One issue I’ve never been conflicted about is taxes. I wasn’t sent to Washington to raise anybody’s taxes to pay for more wasteful spending and this election doesn’t change my principles.</strong> This election was a disappointment, without doubt, but let’s be clear about something: <strong>the House is still run by Republicans, and Republicans still maintain a robust minority in the Senate. </strong>I know some people out there think Tuesday’s results mean Republicans in Washington are now going to roll over and agree to Democrat demands that we hike tax rates before the end of the year.<strong> I’m here to tell them there is no truth to that notion whatsoever</strong>.  Annie-Rose Strasser, <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2012/11/09/1169451/mcconnell-no-taxes/">Senate Minority Leader: We Won&#8217;t Raise Taxes At All</a>, ThinkProgress (Nov. 9, 2012).</p></blockquote>
<p>President Obama Friday invited Congress to sign off on a tax cut for the middle class right away&#8211; noting that just extending the Bush tax cuts for those who make less than $250,000 would give a tax cut to 98 percent of Americans and 97 percent of small businesses. </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>“While there may be disagreements in Congress over whether to raise taxes on people making *over* $250,000 a year, nobody — not Republicans, not Democrats — want taxes to go up for folks making under $250,000 a year,” Obama said. “So let’s not wait.”  Adele M. Stan, <a href="http://www.salon.com/2012/11/10/obama_throws_down_gauntlet_on_fiscal_cliff/">Obama throws down gauntlet on fiscal cliff</a>, Salon.com (Nov. 10, 2012).</p>
<p>Robert Reich, now at the University of California at Berkeley, writes that the game of chicken is on.<br />So who blinks first? Democrats who don’t mind going over the cliff because they’ll get a better final deal – and the deal will be retroactive to January 1<sup>st</sup> so it’s not really a cliff at all but more like a little hill? Or Republicans who want to extend the Bush tax cuts beyond January 1<sup>st</sup>, until we get sufficiently close to the debt ceiling that they can once again threaten the full faith and credit of America?</p>
<p>As I said before, I had naively assumed the election would put an end to these games, but obviously not. Yet Obama and the Democrats are holding most of the cards now. Let’s hope they use them.  Robert Reich, <a href="http://www.salon.com/2012/11/09/get_ready_for_an_economic_game_of_chicken/?source=newsletter">Get ready for an economic game of chicken</a>, Salon.com (Nov. 9, 2012).</p>

                                <p>Apparently Angry Bear comments have been the subject of a spam bombardment, mostly  about buying prescription drugs but also sports equipment.  I have contacted the Blogger team by e-mail, and have asked other Bears to help keep current comment sections clear so readers can maintain their comments on posts.  Sorry for the annoyance.  I miss our Askimet filter!</p>
<p>Update:  9:36 AM&#8230;.maybe the algorithms have caught up to the sources.</p>

<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-0gLPufWlZ4c/UKJL-zIybKI/AAAAAAAABHs/QjEn8VruPaA/s1600/fiscal-cliff-debt-ceiling-chart.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="191" width="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-0gLPufWlZ4c/UKJL-zIybKI/AAAAAAAABHs/QjEn8VruPaA/s320/fiscal-cliff-debt-ceiling-chart.jpg"></a></p>
<p>I was going to list representative links but gave up&#8230;I leave it to readers to supply their own sources for this post.</p>
<p>The issue has been framed as mostly an ideological and partisan battle, with a life of its own separate from any technical, economic, or financial consequences from reasonably competent &#8220;analysts&#8221;.</p>
<p>The fear is so great that the public wants an answer regardless of the details.  (Notice that talking point sounds familiar).</p>
<p>There are are usually only two parts to the problem, </p>
<p>1. Unspecified tax changes, often lumped under loopholesandexemptions.</p>
<p>2. Sociasecuritymedicare are now the only drivers that matter to the cliff.</p>
<p>repeated and repeated and until it feels like simple cut and paste from the articles I have read&#8230;.and often buried in the middle somewhere of the text.</p>
<p>who are the people who want a cut and pasted solution?  </p>

<blockquote>What Uncle Sam has given to the earnings of companies like Citigroup, AIG, and Ford he soon might take away.
<p>President Barack Obama has said, most recently during last month&#8217;s presidential debates, that the 35% U.S. corporate tax rate should be cut. That would mean lower tax bills for many companies. But it also could prompt large write-downs by Citigroup, AIG, Ford and other companies that hold piles of &#8220;deferred tax assets,&#8221; or DTAs.<br />After posting big losses, these companies have tax credits and deductions they can use to defray future tax bills, thus providing a boost to earnings. But a tax-rate reduction means some of those credits and deductions, counted as assets on the balance sheet, would be worth less, since lower tax bills would mean fewer opportunities to use them before they expire. That would force the companies to write down their value, resulting in charges against earnings.</p>
<p>&#8230;<br />&#8230;the company believes tax change should &#8220;include transition measures that mitigate impacts and avoid negative unintended results&#8221; for companies that based their planning on the current tax system.</p>

<p> Posterity</p>
<p> I think you have to go back to Bob Dole in 1996 to find a Republican nominee for for President whose signature accomplishment wouldn&#8217;t be repudiated by most members of his own party in November 2012. The 2000 and 2004 nominee is best known for turning a surplus into a deficit (although most current Republicans approve of the way he did it, cutting tax rates, increasing military spending, and launching two wars) and was kept discretely away from the last Republican National Convention. The 2008 nominee is best known for the McCain-Feingold Act, and the 2012 nominee, of course, will forever be tied to Romneycare. As to Bob Dole in 1996, well, I couldn&#8217;t remember him having any signature issues so I googled him. Google took me <a href="http://www.ontheissues.org/Bob_Dole.htm">here</a> but I still didn&#8217;t find anything that really said &#8220;Bob Dole&#8221; to me.</p>
<p>Sure, he agreed or disagreed with all sorts of things, but he wasn&#8217;t the champion of any and there wasn&#8217;t anything he was really known for. The 1988 and 1992 nominee, George Herbert Walker Bush, these days is best remembered for ending the first war in Iraq without taking out Saddam Hussein or taking Baghdad and for &#8220;read my lips, no new taxes.&#8221; Breaking that promise got him excoriated by Republicans. Reagan seems to be the most recent Republican nominee for President of the US who has a signature issue that remains popular with Republicans today. </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>As the co-author of  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Presimetrics-Presidents-Measure-Issues-ebook/dp/B0041IXRWA/ref=tmm_kin_title_0?ie=UTF8&#038;m=AG56TWVU5XWC2&#038;qid=1337806400&#038;sr=1-1">Presimetrics</a>,  a book on Presidents, their policies, and the effect of those policies; I&#8217;ve talked to a lot of people of all stripes about Presidents, and Republicans today simply don&#8217;t seem to approve of most former Republican presidents, or at least their policies. Before Reagan was Ford, best remembered for pardoning Nixon and Whip Inflation Now. Nixon is best remembered for Watergate, going to China and meeting Mao, and price controls. Eisenhower for big government programs. Hoover, for being the hapless fellow who had recently become President when the Great Depression began.</p>
<p>At first I thought that says something about today&#8217;s Republican party. And perhaps it does. Perhaps it indicates the party&#8217;s values today are very different than they ever have been.</p>
<p>But it also may serve as a warning to Obama. I&#8217;ve pointed out before that except for one or two issues (Obamacare and Supreme Court justices he&#8217;s nominated), Obama&#8217;s first term has looked an awful lot like the third term of GW Bush would have looked. Tax rates remain low, the percentage of personal income going to taxes is down and the bail-out is basically an extension of Paulson&#8217;s bazooka. In four years, four long years, Obama hasn&#8217;t managed to figure out a single new approach to dealing with the economic mess that wasn&#8217;t pioneered by the guy who got us into the hole in the first place! The same is true of most other aspects of the Obama presidency. Policies on civil liberties are essentially the same as they were under GW. The &#8220;good war&#8221; in Afghanistan is still going on, and the war that was getting increasingly inconvenient (even the folks at the National Review had managed to figure out there was a problem by 2007 leading to the death of the &#8220;painted schoolhouse&#8221; anecdotes) was ended discretely, with everyone pretending that Iran wasn&#8217;t firmly in the driver&#8217;s seat. Foreigners, at least the non-Pakistani ones, seem to like Obama, but that&#8217;s more because there&#8217;s less bluster about &#8220;with us or against us&#8221; &#8211; actual policy remains very similar, complete with a down-to-the-bone inability to distinguish friend from foe.</p>
<p>Obama seems to have been re-elected not with enthusiasm among Democrats, but rather due to a sense that Romney was even worse. Part of that came from a feeling that Romney&#8217;s views on business weren&#8217;t really about business, they were just about profiting from loading companies up with debt, as if that approach to running the government hasn&#8217;t been championed by every President we&#8217;ve had since 1980 other than Bill Clinton. And truth to tell, a lot of the foreboding about Romney came not so much from Romney, who at some point stood for everything and anything, and thus stood for nothing at all, but rather from the particularly in-artful downticket comments (think Akin or Mourdock) on &#8220;legitimate rape&#8221; (???, !!!!!) and abortions. Most Democrats and many independents aren&#8217;t happy with Romneycare, er, Obamacare. They see it as a distant second or third best compared to the socialized medical systems of every industrialized country that produces better healthcare outcomes than we do, and at lower cost to boot. The one bit of actual enthusiasm for Obama might have come on the gay rights side, as a growing number of younger voters in much of the country don&#8217;t have the bias against openly gay people that remains strong among social conservatives, particularly the older generations. But even there, the camel&#8217;s nose entered the tent during the previous administration &#8211; most Republicans were smart enough not to piss off Dick Cheney by criticizing his daughter. </p>
<p>All of which is to say, Obama is potentially headed down the Republican presidency path in more ways than one. Despite his re-election, unless Democrats are infinitely more forgiving than Republicans, Obama might eventually become his party&#8217;s George Bush- the name nobody wants to mention, the face nobody wants to see at campaign stops, and the legacy nobody wants to remember. The longer he follows the same policies as his predecessor, the greater the likelihood he will be viewed the same way by his own party&#8217;s posterity. </p>
<p>A lot of Democrats seem to believe that now we&#8217;re going to see the &#8220;real Obama.&#8221; I hear Democrats say that Obama isn&#8217;t constrained by the need for re-election any more, and he has realized that rolling over and playing dead doesn&#8217;t make Republicans or Wall Street like him any better. Perhaps that&#8217;s true, perhaps the next four years will be different, but I wouldn&#8217;t bet on it. Its been my experience that in general, people don&#8217;t change that much. If he&#8217;s been behaving a certain way for four years, it is very likely we&#8217;ve seen the &#8220;real Obama.&#8221;</p>

                                <p>I’d like to interject a very concrete example into the large swirl of quite theoretical, thought-experiment discussion about whether “demand for money” means “demand for the medium of exchange” or “demand for the medium of account.” <a href="http://www.themoneyillusion.com/?p=17368">Scott Sumner</a> and <a href="http://worthwhile.typepad.com/worthwhile_canadian_initi/2012/10/medium-of-account-vs-medium-of-exchange.html">Nick Rowe</a> are, as so often, at the center of this discussion. But before I do, I need to work through some conceptual and terminology issues.<br />Nick — who so often cuts so clearly to the crux of things — injects what he seems to feel (rightly so, I think) is a necessary update and clarification into his sally on the subject:<br />
<blockquote>…in my model, gold is the medium of account; and (say) an ounce of gold is the unit of account.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m not clear whether or not the update was in reply to M.R.’s comment, which addresses exactly the point I want to make:<br />
<blockquote>I’m still not convinced that the concept of a “medium of account” is well enough specified. “Unit of account” is fairly straightforward; we measure everything in units (inches, kilograms, minutes, etc.) What is the “medium of account” in the current U.S. monetary system, analogous to the role that gold plays in your simple model? If your answer is “dollars” then I think you may have a very serious specification problem. This is very subtle and difficult.</p></blockquote>
<p>Nick does reply directly to that comment, and his reply’s uncertain nature fully supports my thinking:<br />
<blockquote>OK, but the unit of account (in my model) isn’t “ounces”, it is ounces of gold, as opposed to ounces of silver or ounces of hair.<br />Medium of account in the US? Hmm. Fed liabilities?</p></blockquote>
<p>Here we see Nick Rowe — who thinks as deeply and curiously (but I think misguidedly) about monetary economics as anyone out there — wondering what the U.S. medium of account <em>is</em>. This, after hundreds of years of very hard thinking by very smart people about the nature of money. It’s enough to make you question economists’ understanding of economics. They don’t even understand <em>money</em>?<br />The more I think about it, the more I think that “medium of account” is an incoherent concept (and even worse, “demand for the medium of account,” which seems doubly incoherent) — a will o’ the wisp that lures otherwise coherent thinkers into dangerous and bottomless conceptual b(l)ogs.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Think about “medium” and “media” in a very common usage — relative to information and entertainment. In this context media are vehicles for transmission — books, newspapers, TV, web pages.<br />This meaning kind of works for “medium of exchange” — dollar bills and bank interchanges are vehicles for transmitting something — value. Just like power lines and cans of gasoline are media for transmitting energy.<br />There are many media of monetary exchange (especially if you include purely financial transactions) — physical pieces of currency, credits in bank (and money-market) accounts, credit-card lines of credit, treasury bonds, bank reserves, etc. Dollar bills and bank-account credits have traditionally been the dominant media of exchange for exchanges involving real-world goods and services, but even that is far less true these days, given the quantity of credit-card sales. “Medium of exchange” at least makes conceptual sense. But “<em>the</em> medium of exchange” doesn’t. There are many. To steal M.R.’s words, it has “a very serious specification problem.”<br />“Money as the medium of account” is really far worse. What is being transmitted, and what is the vehicle? What does this term — in particular the word “medium” here – <em>mean</em>? It’s obviously about counting and measurement. But what is being measured, counted? I would say: value — just like a thermometer measures temperature, or a ruler measures length. But in those contexts, the media of account are <em>temperature</em> and <em>length. </em>(The units of account are degrees and inches, or whatever.) I’d like to suggest that in economic thinking the medium of account is <em>always</em> value — not “money” (however you choose to define that word), and never dollars or ounces of gold, which are <em>units</em> of account. If this is safe, “demand for the medium of account” would mean “demand for value” — which strikes me as obvious, or tautological, or just not very useful, conceptually. And “demand for the <em>unit</em> of account” obviously makes no sense at all; is there demand for inches or degrees?<br />This is where M.R. gets it right, and Nick in his update glances toward more useful thinking: we should be talking, thinking, about <em>units</em> of account, and how value is ascribed to those units.<br />In the normal course of things, a (physical or electronic) dollar has the same designated, ascribed, agreed-upon value as “the dollar.” But as Miles Kimball points out in what he describes as “<em><a href="http://blog.supplysideliberal.com/post/35123798395/how-subordinating-paper-money-to-electronic-money-can">the most important thing I have ever said about monetary policy</a>,” </em>this need not necessarily be true. A physical dollar can, conceptually at least, have a different value than an electronic dollar. (Once again I would say that each of these is a financial asset, an embodiment of money or exchange value, with particular properties and characteristics which may be in greater or lesser demand — and supply — at different times.) Different kinds of dollars could have different values, <em>as designated in dollars!</em> We really need different words for these things. (See: concrete example, below.)<br />Let me put it another way: I think Nick, Scott, and most economists don’t fully understand that “a dollar” is, conceptually, a completely different <em>type</em> of thing from “the dollar.” (At least they talk as if they don’t.) One is a unit (and vehicle) of exchange, the other is a unit of account, or measurement. And as Miles points out, even “a dollar” is not sufficiently specified.<br />I promised a concrete example, and here it is, courtesy of <em>This American Life</em>‘s typically brilliant “<a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/423/the-invention-of-money">The Invention of Money</a>” episode: how Brazil ended years of rampant hyperinflation. I’m rather astounded that, searching through my blog reader, I find that nobody has looked at this real-world example, even though it’s <em>exactly the situation</em> that Scott and Nick are talking about. (I’m sure there are others like it. Readers?)<br />Here’s the short story, but I recommend the whole thing; it’s short and very entertaining.<br />The cruzeiro had been plummeting in value (relative to real goods) for years. This was true both of the units of exchange (“cruzeiros” of all types — physical, electronic, etc.) and the unit of account (“the cruzeiro”) — necessarily so, because <em>they were uniformly conceived as the same thing</em>.<br />The solution was to introduce a new unit of account — rather cravenly titled the <em>real</em> in an effort to get people to ascribe real market-basket value to it — and to require its use in designating the <em>value</em> of everything, regardless of what units were exchanged. (Conceptually, they could have just revalued “the cruzeiro,” but nobody would have fallen for it because nobody trusted either the cruzeiro <em>or</em> cruzeiros. They would have continued to ascribe low — and ever-lower — value to it.)<br />By legislative fiat, all wages, taxes, and prices were to be designated in the new “real” unit of account.<br />
<blockquote>People had to be tricked into thinking money had value, when all signs told them that was absolutely not true. So Basha says, they wrote a plan for a new currency, one that was stable, dependable, trustworthy. The only catch was this currency would not be real. It would not be printed. There would never be coins. It was fake. They called it a virtual currency.<br /><strong>Edmar Basha</strong><br />We called the unit of real value, URV. Yeah, it was a virtue that didn’t exist in fact.<br /><strong>Chana Joffe</strong><br />People would still have cruzeiros, the local currency in their pockets. But when they got paid, their wages would be listed in URVs. Taxes were in URVs and all prices were listed in URVs. And URVs were stable. And so, for example, when you went to the store and bought some milk.<br /><strong>Edmar Basha</strong><br />How much does it cost? Say well, know we have it cost X. Let’s say one URV. Well, how much is that because I cannot pay with URV. Well, I have this little table here and today’s value of URV in cruzeiros is seven cruzeiros per URV. So it cost one URV, seven cruzeiros.<br />You go next week, well, it’s still one URV. But then you say, how many cruzeiros? You look, well, 14.<br /><strong>Chana Joffe</strong><br />Every night the central bank would put out a memo with the official conversion rate. And a table would get printed in the newspaper. The store clerk could look at the table in the newspaper and see, Monday, one URV is equal to seven cruzeiros. Tuesday, 12 cruzeiros. Wednesday, 14. Milk or whatever it was you were buying would stay the same price. There was no need for the sticker man.</p></blockquote>
<p>Eventually they phased out cruzeiros and issued physical reals. It worked:<br />
<blockquote>Brazil went from being an irrelevant, economic basket-case to one of the most important economies out there. The eighth largest in the world.</p></blockquote>
<p>Notice “unit” in the name. (Not “medium.”) The stability of the unit of account was what mattered — what value people ascribed to it. That ascription was anchored to real value because wages and taxes were designated in that unit, which also made “reals” into units of electronic exchange. (For the former: labor theory of value, anyone? For the latter: got chartalism?)<br />You’ll notice I never used the word “medium” to describe what happened here. At best it was unecessary, and at worst it would have sown all sorts of confusion and incoherence. We don’t need no stinking mediums.<br />Update: ﻿I should add that &#8220;unit&#8221; here is also used in two senses: 1. Exchange units of which there are many, that can be shuffled around physically or electronically, and 2. a more abstract and necessarily singular measurement or accounting unit. The value of the former are designated in the latter.<br /><em>Cross-posted at <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/?p=6296">Asymptosis</a>.</em></p>

                                <p>Andrew C. Thomas <a href="http://www.acthomas.ca/comment/2012/11/538s-uncertainty-estimates-are-as-good-as-they-get.html"> asks about Silver&#8217;s uncertainty estimates.</a>  (via <a href="https://twitter.com/nikete">@nikete</a>) My very confident guess was that Silver&#8217;s forecasts were too cautious &#8212; that his probability estimates were too close to 50 %, that he underestimated the precision of his point forecasts.</p>
<p> It is actually easy to check my hypothesis (not that I did) by looking at the p-values of outcomes.  For each state Silver had an estimate of the expected Obama minus Romney percent of vote (I will call this state_x below so Ohio_x was positive) and an estimate of the standard error of that estimate.  Given his approach of averaging lots of numbers, he was fairly confident that the forecast errors would be normally distributed.  This means that he could calculate the probability of Romney winning Ohio that is the proability that Ohio_x F_Ohio_NS (Ohio_x) is uniform from 0 to 1 that is U(0,1).  Thomas calculates 51 statistics of the form F_state_NS(state_x)  (where Washington DC gets temporary statehood for notational convenience).   I have gone through all this tiresome notation to define the Nate Silver calculated p-values of state outcomes.  If he is right not just about the mean but also about the spread around that mean, these 51 statistics should be distributed U(0,1)<!--0-->0></p>
<p>  Are they uniformly distributed ?  Damned if the distribution doesn&#8217;t look as much like a uniform distribution as any uniform distribution I&#8217;ve ever seen</p>
<p> &#8220;the 538 distribution is nearly uniform. The closer the points are to the diagonal, the better the fit to the uniform:&#8221;</p>

<p> This is much much much more impressive than just calculating that the probability of an Obama win was over 50% for each state Obama won and under 50% for each state he lost. </p>
<p> Wow. </p>
<p> Now this isn&#8217;t the whole story.  The overall probability of Obama victory does not just depend on the 51 univariate distributions.  The key question is how highly correlated across states are deviations outcome minus expected outcome.  Here there are three components <br />1) sampling error (which should be independent across polls and therefore over time and across states) <br />2) true change in population voting intentions from the time of the poll to the time.  This is complicated but all changes should be positively correlated across states. Silver had a monster estimate/guess of the correlation based on demographics some how.  I insist on reviewing subcases</p>
<p> a) true change in opinions about who should be president (very hard to understand but not a big deal on Nov 5)<br />b) undecided voters deciding (again tricky but there weren&#8217;t that many of them and there is a clear pattern of deciding pretty close to 50-50 in Presidentials and definitely more for the challenger in Congressional races)<br />c) moderately likely voters deciding whether to vote or not plus the effects of get out the vote efforts.  This is horribly complicated but can be considered a part of the real problem 3</p>
<p> 3) pollster bias.  Notably before the election Silver said that Romney&#8217;s simulated wins were almost all in simulations for which the computer guessed a large pro Obama average bias<br />a) from sampling (as in robo-pollers don&#8217;t sample cell phone only household) and weighting.<br />b) from a likely voter filter which doesn&#8217;t correctly find likely voters and the implicit rounding of probabilities of voting to 0 or 1.</p>
<p> Silver can&#8217;t know very much about this. In particular he has almost no information on the average pollster bias.<br /> He only gets information on the bias of a particular pollster when there is an actual election. Mid terms aren&#8217;t at all like Presidentials so really one observation every 4 years.  There are new pollsters which had no performance record at all.  It is easy to measure the difference in bias of two pollsters (that is the difference in the house effects).  It is very hard to calculate the average bias or the joint probability density that two pollsters are say biased 1% for Romney or something.  I think this must be a guess and that Thomas&#8217;s beautiful graph doesn&#8217;t show that Silver guessed right.</p>
<p> But it is a beautiful graph.  He did the same thing for Votamatic.  There he saw that too many p values were near &#8216;0 and near 1, that is too many outcomes were judged extreme by Drew Linzer. &#8220;the Votamatic predictions turned out to be too overly precise.&#8221;  That is Linzer had excessive confidence in his point estimates and underestimated the remaining uncertainty.  Here I stress that the graph for Votamatic is pretty damn good looking.  Performance not as good as Silver&#8217;s is perfectly consistent with amazingly good performance.</p>

                                <p>We are now mostly through Week 10 of the NFL season, which means most teams have played nine games. Unless Kansas City manages to beat Pittsburgh by more than 36 points on Monday*—not, to be gracious about it, the Way to Bet—there will be four teams in the NFL that have give up between 10 and 20 points more than the have scored.</p>
<p>You would naturally assume that those teams would have losing records, either 4-5 or even, the closer you get to –20, 3-6. But certainly it depends on the distribution of your wins and losses. But, just for fun, let’s look at the four teams:</p>

<p>This, not to put too fine a point on it, is why we apply statistical analysis. A couple of blowouts (both New Jersey teams lost today by three touchdowns, though the Jets—Jersey/B, as Gregg Easterbrook’s sole viable contribution to popular culture named them—gave up extra points as well) may skew the record—if every other game is close.  If I tell 100 people who know the rules of football but not the way the season has gone, “The Colts have given up 15 more points than they have scored through nine games,”  chances are that 80-90 of them would guess the team was 4-5 or even 3-6.  Some small number might guess 5-4, and an even smaller one will guess 6-3.</p>
<p>But then add information. For instance I say, “They <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=320909003">lost their first game of the season by 20 points</a>.”  At this point, those will at least moderate math skills realize that the Colts are +5 over 8 games; 5-3 is not out of the question, though 4-4 remains the Way to Bet—by a much smaller margin.</p>
<p>Now I add, “Coming into this week, they had only won one game by more than three points.”  Suddenly, that +5 looks strong; there is a shift of some set of the 4-5 people (who know the first week was a loss) to 5-4 (5-3 plus that loss).</p>
<p>The more information you get—“they were <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=321014020">blown out by Jersey/B</a> as well”—the more likely you are to guess that they might be 6-3.  But the odds still don’t favor that.  Indeed, the Dolphins have been blown out twice (-20, –34), but they have also won two blowouts (+22, +21). (The Bengals are 1-1 in blowouts; the Cowboys, like the Colts, are 1-2.)</p>
<p>So if we’re just looking at the raw data and the predictions of the people, we would see the Informed Voters hanging around 5-4 or even 6-3, the Paying Attention group splitting between 4-5 and 5-4, and some Randomly-Asked-Questions people guessing 3-6 or 4-5 (with a few clever enough to say 5-4 just because they know someone thought the question was interesting).</p>
<p>Any parallels to those complaining that Nate Silver was estimating percentages to four significant digits are left as an exercise to the reader.</p>
<p>*Or there is a blowout of epic proportion tonight between two teams that are both at least +100 through eight games.</p>
