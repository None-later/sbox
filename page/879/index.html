                                <p>Yesterday I helped out Jonah Goldberg by suggesting <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/03/jonah-goldberg-on-magic-tricks.html">a magic trick for his little daughter</a>.  I got another one.  Jonah can show her that if she and her friends stop relying on their parents to provide for them, and instead got their butts in gear and relied on the free market instead, they&#8217;ll be rich in no time.</p>
<p>Now, because people with connections don&#8217;t really believe in the free market, maybe that&#8217;s not a magic trick Goldberg is really willing to see his daughter try.  So I have another one for him that I like to call the Reagan.  Step 1:  take out a credit card and borrow humongous amounts of money.  Step 2:  force her harder working younger sibling to pay the bill.  So what&#8217;s magic about that?  Well, by this trick, the 4 year old is the one with fiscal discipline.  The other one is the fiscally profligate one.  Just ask Jonah and his buddies.</p>

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>

                                <p>After the WMD argument fell apart, the next one that GW&#8217;s apologists came up with was that it would create a lot of good will in the Middle East.  Perhaps you remember how it was going to lead to a flowering of democracy in the Middle East.  Of course, the whole &#8220;do it because its the right thing to do&#8221; argument never caught on, otherwise, the folks peddling it would have had to support going into places like Zimbabwe, where the suffering is actually worse but the overthrow of the SOB causing it is a lot easier. </p>
<p>But still, I was thinking that when I read this <a href="http://theroadtothehorizon.blogspot.com/2006/03/news-round-up-war-in-iraq-happy.html">post</a>.  The author notes that according Joe Stiglitz, one minute of war in Iraq costs $380,000.  He also notes that according to the UN&#8217;s World Food, Program, it costs as little as 19 cents a day to feed a child.  He does a bit of arithmetic, and concludes that &#8220;[o]ne day of war in Iraq would feed 8,000,000 children for a year.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, maybe the figures are wrong somewhere&#8230; say one day of war in Iraq would feed 1,000,000 children for a year.  Regular readers know I&#8217;m not the bleeding heart pie in the sky type, but let me try that role on this one time. How much goodwill toward Americans could be created if we concluded that GW is too incompetent to be trusted to do anything other than make it worse, we call it a day in Iraq and donated six month&#8217;s worth of the cost of keeping this mess going to a good cause?</p>

<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s not a question of probity but of competence. Gonzales has allowed a scandal to be created where there was none. That is quite an achievement. He had a two-foot putt and he muffed it.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>No scandal?</strong>  <a href="http://www.tnr.com/blog/theplank?pid=91839">Christopher Orr</a> dissects Krauthammer’s logic:</p>
<blockquote><p>In other words, Krauthammer thinks it is perfectly acceptable for a White House to fire attorneys because they are not following policy priorities that are explicitly intended to aid its own party at the polls. This is a truly extraordinary assertion: That the party in power is entitled to use law enforcement officers to punish the party out of power. Doubtless Krauthammer will defend this moral principle with equal vigor when a Democrat is in the White House.</p></blockquote>

<p>But let’s move away from the National Review nitwits and check out what <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2007_03/010998.php">Kevin Drum</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Is there, as Alberto Gonzales insists, a perfectly reasonable explanation for Purgegate? I guess there might be, but there are sure an awful lot of reasons to be skeptical. Here&#8217;s a list off the top of my head:</p>
<p>1. Prior to the purge, DOJ lawyers quietly inserted a clause in the Patriot Act that allowed them to appoint new U.S. Attorneys without Senate approval. Why did they do this when their own emails show that the existing system hadn&#8217;t caused them any problems?<br />2. They fired eight USAs at once. This is wildly unprecedented. Why did they feel the need for such an extensive sweep?<br />3. None of the eight were given a reason for being fired.<br />4. DOJ initially lied when asked why they were fired, chalking it up to &#8220;performance reasons&#8221; even though five of the eight had previously received reviews placing them in the top third of all USAs. Why lie if there&#8217;s an innocent explanation?<br />5. Five of the eight were either aggressively prosecuting Republicans or else failing to prosecute Democrats to the satisfaction of local politicians. Coincidence?<br />6. David Iglesias reported that he received case-related calls from from Heather Wilson and Pete Domenici shortly before the midterms. He believes the calls were intended to pressure him into indicting some local Democrats before election day. He didn&#8217;t, and a few weeks later he was fired.<br />On a similar note, the day after Carol Lam notified DOJ that she was planning to expand the Duke Cunningham investigation, Kyle Sampson emailed the White House and told William Kelly to call him so he could explain the &#8220;real reason&#8221; he wanted to get rid of Lam. What was the real reason that he didn&#8217;t want to put in email?<br />7. When DOJ released thousands of pages of emails last week, there was a mysterious 18-day gap from a period shortly before the firings were announced. This seems like precisely the period during which there would have been the greatest amount of email traffic. Where are the emails?<br />8. The email dump contained virtually nothing from before the firings discussing the reasons for targeting the eight USAs who were eventually fired. Surely there must have been such a discussion?<br />9. DOJ has now had weeks to come up with a plausible story for the firings and they still haven&#8217;t. This is truly remarkable. Why not just tell the truth? That doesn&#8217;t take weeks to concoct.</p>
<p>Except for #9, none of these things by themselves would generate much suspicion. Put them all together, though, and you have to be a real dead-end loyalist to believe there&#8217;s nothing fishy going on. Throw in #9 and even the dead-enders ought to be scratching their chins.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: The Krauthammer standard has been adopted by <a href="http://www.sltrib.com/news/ci_5517136">Senator Orrin Hatch and Congressman Chris Cannon</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Sen. Orrin Hatch and Rep. Chris Cannon of Utah defended U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales on Saturday after newly released documents showed Gonzales was in a meeting where he approved the firing of seven U.S. attorneys. The revelation appeared to contradict Gonzales&#8217; earlier statements that he was not aware of the details of a plan to fire the prosecutors, and to support what Kyle Sampson, a Utah native who was Gonzales&#8217; chief of staff, has stated through his attorney: that many senior Justice Department officials were aware of the U.S. attorney discussions. Hatch on Saturday defended Gonzales. &#8220;In my long experience with Attorney General Gonzales, he has always been straightforward and honest with me,&#8221; Hatch said. &#8220;So, unless there is clear evidence that the attorney general deliberately lied or misled Congress, I see no reason to call for his resignation.&#8221; Cannon also jumped to Gonzales&#8217; defense. &#8220;The attorney general hasn&#8217;t said he hasn&#8217;t touched this. He has said he wasn&#8217;t deeply involved,&#8221; Cannon said on Fox News. &#8220;This is highly consistent with what the attorney general has said in the past.&#8221; Cannon said that there is &#8220;nothing wrong with firing a U.S. attorney for the reason of politics,&#8221; and Democrats have been unable to prove there was any corruption involved.</p></blockquote>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>While I was as saddened by the news that breast cancer that Elizabeth Edwards learned about back in late 2004 has returned, I have not blogged about this as I don’t have a loved one who has suffered from breast cancer.  So I’m lucky but I’m also clueless about what couples go through.  So let’s hear from <a href="http://www.tpmcafe.com/blog/coffeehouse/2007/mar/24/the_personal_and_the_political_elizabeth_edwards_as_icon">Jo-Ann Mort</a> instead:</p>
<blockquote><p>I admit that my first reaction when hearing that Elizabeth Edwards&#8217; cancer had returned (aside from deep sadness for her and her family) and that her husband was nonetheless, going to continue with his campaign, was surprise. I found it difficult to see how the campaign could move forward with this new situation, but now, a few days later &#8211; and after reading reports of her prognosis, among other things, I have great admiration for their decision.  As a breast cancer survivor myself, it&#8217;s difficult to look at Elizabeth Edwards and not wish her well &#8211; but there is more. I hope that her public stature brings attention to the need for how cancer patients are treated in our society, and especially regarding the precarious nature of health coverage and health insurance for those of us with a history of cancer &#8230; Today, after two recent cancer scares, I live with the constant fear that I will be denied health coverage or find myself in a situation in need of expensive drugs or specialist care that I can&#8217;t afford. This fear never goes away &#8211; and it won&#8217;t until our country makes the steadfast decision not only to make health care accessible to all, but to equalize treatment so that no woman is making a decision regarding her health based on what she can afford or can&#8217;t afford regarding her work situation. As the candidates debate health care issues in Las Vegas today and throughout the campaign season, perhaps issues of access to care will come up. And we&#8217;ll have Elizabeth Edwards&#8217; heroic decision to thank.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well said!  Now for the view from the right from someone who is more clueless than I am.  <a href="http://mediamatters.org/items/200703230015">Media Matters</a> listens to Rush Limbaugh so we don’t have to:</p>
<blockquote><p>Rush Limbaugh told listeners that former Sen. John Edwards (D-NC) and his wife Elizabeth are &#8220;political people [who] are different than you and I.&#8221; Referring to the couple&#8217;s March 22 announcement that Elizabeth Edwards has Stage IV metastatic breast cancer, Limbaugh said: &#8220;[M]ost people, when told a family member&#8217;s been diagnosed with the kind of cancer Elizabeth Edwards has, they turn to God. The Edwards turned to the campaign. Their religion is politics and the quest for the White House.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Did I say clueless?  I meant pathetic.</p>

<p>&#8220;We need to keep the companies that build our stuff in business&#8221;.</p>
<p>No reason to. We should nationalize them, and recognize that the &#8220;common defense&#8221; is a governmental function and return to the arsenal system.</p>
<p>All businesses exist to survive and profits are the measure of survival. That is first motive, same for living things. However, to survive businesses must provide a good or service that is sold and has some value to the wanter or buyer. How do you decide the value of what the military industrial complex sells?</p>
<p>It seems to me you are saying it is &#8216;being ready to fight a war&#8217;. But what war? How do we know what the next enemy will do?</p>
<p>So we used to look to the Soviet Union and we found out later on that our estimates of their capabilities were greatly exaggerated. The Soviets were organized in about the same way we were; both lined up like in 1945. We had a pretty good arms race which we were ahead in nearly all counts.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our stuff&#8221;, meaning things produced by the military industrial complex are not needed for immediate threats. So, they keep making up things for these systems to do. There is no one out there who could challenge the US in the way we are preparing for war, even though we have a lot of defective systems running around we still can do a lot of damage in an industrial age conflict.</p>
<p>The problem is there are no longer industrial age adversaries. Our opponents will not line up tank divisions they will invite us to come and take over their country so their people can kill us. In the case of Taiwan, the PRC will not assault them; they know that industrial war is a mess. The best way to deal with Taiwan is to make it like Switzerland, an armed militia including most of the adult population. Then the PLA will never come over, they would face what they did to Chiang as well as the Japanese.</p>
<p>Another issue raised:</p>
<p>&#8220;Their workers productive so that we can produce the stuff we need when we need it.&#8221;</p>
<p>I promise a series of post on our not so &#8220;vibrant defense sector&#8221; in the very near future. Just a couple of recent troubled programs: the Marine&#8217;s Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle, Army&#8217;s Armed Reconn Helicopter, and around since 1993 the B-2 30% mission ready.</p>
<p>If you think you may ever need this stuff and the work of their developers you ought to demand better.</p>

                                <p>The Lancet recently had an article assessing the <a href="http://arstechnica.com/journals/science.ars/2007/03/23/assesing-the-harm-of-illegal-drugs">harm of illegal drugs</a>.  While they&#8217;re not directly comparable by virtue of being legal, tobacco and alcohol were on the list.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, pot and a host of other drugs (anabolic steroids, LSD, ecstasy, and khat) seem to be less harmful than alcohol or tobacco.  I don&#8217;t drink alcohol, smoke, or take drugs (I&#8217;m a very boring person in that regard), but I&#8217;ve always thought the choice of what is legal and what is illegal is very, very odd.</p>
<p>FWIW, in my opinion a lot of drugs should be legalized.</p>

                                <p>Over at the Corner, Jonah Goldberg <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=NzNjYTRlYzIzZDFjODJiNzJlMWZiYzNkYWNhNzYxMTE="> runs into some difficulty</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Okay, so my four year old daughter desperately wants me to do more magic tricks. All I can really do for her are variations of  &#8220;Hey, I found a quarter in your ear&#8221; stuff. And even then, the prestidigitation isn&#8217;t really up to snuff. If she were five, she&#8217;d be on to me. So, I need really simple, stupid in fact, magic tricks that can be done with little skill, that will impress a four year-old. Any suggestions? </p></blockquote>
<p>Given the crowd he runs with and the Kool Aid he drinks, I would imagine the best stupid magic trick for Jonah is obvious.  He can simply cut the kid&#8217;s allowance allowance and let the Laffer curve multiply her income.  </p>
<p>The benefits of this trick are many.  Some that come to mind:<br />1.  His daughter will soon be rich<br />2.  In order for her to realize that she is rich, she will have to learn to disregard things like &#8220;evidence&#8221; and &#8220;facts&#8221;  which will be particularly useful when he teaches her the Ledeen Doctrine in a couple of years<br />3.  Jonah can teach his daughter about the evil liberal fascists who refuse to believe and how insulting it is to him that the liberal fascists refuse to believe</p>
<p>Some people never stop believing in stupid magic tricks.</p>

<p>To me, this looks like classic price discrimination.  The two products are (for all practical purposes) priced the same.  One is a much better value than the other, and McDonald&#8217;s has reason to believe that its less price sensitive consumers won&#8217;t notice.  Or is there something else?</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t ever let my health insurance expire, or I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;ll ever be able to get it again.&#8221; That&#8217;s what a friend remarked to me last night, not in the midst of a conversation about health care policy, but just talking about life. </p></blockquote>
<p>three dots</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m not personally in that particular situation, but it&#8217;s a major, major drawback of the American system. It&#8217;s absurd to live in a country where people with some medical history feel they need to live without ever having a bigger-than-COBRA-sized gap in their employment history. It&#8217;s bad for the economy, and it&#8217;s bad for society.</p></blockquote>
<p>I suspect he&#8217;s right.  I wonder how one would test that.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>While <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2007/03/the_conspiracy_.html">Brad DeLong</a> and <a href="http://x/">Donald Luskin</a> truly hate each other (Brad’s contention that Luskin is stupid is exactly right, while Luskin’s attack that Brad is fat was so pointless that Luskin even had to retreat from it), they both agree that Jagadeesh Gokhale’s <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=920156">Wage Growth and the Measurement of Social Security&#8217;s Financial Condition</a> is a very good paper:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Social Security trustees&#8217; economic growth projections receive considerable attention because many people believe that higher growth would significantly improve the program&#8217;s actuarial balance (that is, reduce its actuarial deficit). This belief is validated by Social Security trustees&#8217; calculations that show larger 75-year actuarial balances under faster assumed real wage growth rates. Since 2003 the trustees have reported the program&#8217;s actuarial balance measured in perpetuity. But they do not provide sensitivity analysis that examines the impact of various assumptions on the infinite-term actuarial balance.  This paper shows analytically that faster wage growth may reduce Social Security&#8217;s infinite-term actuarial balance if the ratio of workers to retirees continues to decline rapidly beyond the 75th year. This result holds even if the decline in that ratio ceases after just two decades beyond the 75th year. The paper reports stylized calculations of the impact of real wage growth and demographic change &#8211; including time-varying rates of change based on official projections for the U.S. economy &#8211; on Social Security&#8217;s actuarial balance in a multi-period setting. Finally, the Social Security and Accounts Simulator (SSASIM) actuarial model of Social Security financing is used to estimate the degree to which increased wage growth could negatively affect the system&#8217;s infinite-term actuarial balance.  These results raise questions about the conventional wisdom that holds that improved wage growth would affect Social Security&#8217;s financing, and how a widely used measure of Social Security&#8217;s financing captures those effects.</p></blockquote>
<p>Luskin reads this and tries this summary:</p>
<blockquote><p>For future participants, the present value of taxes and scheduled benefits are roughly equal. Faster growth would increase both the future revenues and the future benefits in approximately equal measure. The revenues would arrive before the higher benefits must be paid, so there&#8217;s an illusory improvement if you use a flawed metric like 75-year actuarial balance which counts the inflow but overlooks the outflow, but the actual total deficit, which is on the books already, isn&#8217;t really affected. The idea that faster economic growth will eliminate unfunded liability is simply incorrect</p></blockquote>
<p>When Luskin starts with the premise that “the present value of taxes and scheduled benefits are roughly equal” for future participants – then one has to wonder why he claims there is a supposed shortfall.  Of course, the real issue is that retirement of the baby boomers who have paid enough to build a Social Security Trust Fund reserve.  Simple steady state propositions therefore don’t tell us that much.  Which is why one needs to more carefully read what Jagadeesh Gokhale actually wrote.  Brad’s take is as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>In a year-by-year pay-as-you-go-balance system, faster real wage growth makes the state of Social Security look better: because it raises each year&#8217;s wages relative to that year&#8217;s benefits, it means we need a lower tax rate in each future year less above their current levels in order to balance that year&#8217;s Social Security tax collections with that year&#8217;s Social Security benefits.  In a substantially prefunded full-intertemporal-balance system with a sufficiently rapidly declining ratio of workers-to-beneficiaries, faster real wage growth makes the state of Social Security look worse: the declining worker-to-beneficiary ratio means that a larger share of workers than beneficiaries are in the near future (when faster wage growth makes relative wages lower) and a larger share of beneficiaries than workers are in the far future (when faster wage growth makes relative benefits higher), thus faster real wage growth raises average benefits more than average wages.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, it depends on both your metrics (with Luskin being one of those pay-as-you-go-balance types – which means he’s hopelessly confused with his latest loony tune post) as well as one’s assumptions as to transition period before we return to some alleged steady state.  Brad continues by noting what Jagadeesh Gokhale really said, but I fear we have gone way past the comprehensive skills of the clown known as Donald Luskin.</p>
