                                <p>We&#8217;ve been having issues with blogger lately.  Don&#8217;t ask&#8230;  they&#8217;re pretty hard to describe.  Frank de Libero just sent me a post&#8230; he&#8217;s been trying and trying to log in to put it up himself but what can you do?  Anyway, this is his post.  Apologies if I messed it up&#8230;</p>

<p>In spite of repeated assertions by the administration, media and related that the jobs situation is strong, empirically the big picture is not confirmatory. The following uses working-age population trends to show there is currently between a 5 million and 12.3 million jobs shortfall.</p>
<p>But first I want to be clear about my motives for this and other posts. I believe government can make a difference, so I am more often aligned with Democrats than Republicans. However, my posts are not meant to be partisan. They are in opposition to deception, untruths, disinformation and propaganda, regardless of the source. My goal is to help promote clarity through numbers.</p>
<p>Others have also argued that there is a significant jobs deficit (e.g., CBPP referenced below). These are demonstrated by comparing job growth or time to job recovery in past business cycles with the 2001 recession. The following chart shows the 2001 recession&#8217;s unusually long lag till the jobs recovery.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Ri5BkKxyM0I/AAAAAAAAALY/WOwsD9Piw64/s1600-h/JobsRecovery.gif"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Ri5BkKxyM0I/AAAAAAAAALY/WOwsD9Piw64/s320/JobsRecovery.gif" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Monthly BLS payroll data goes back to January 1948. From then till now, there have been 10 recessions. The average time between the end of a recession and the jobs recovery for the first nine business cycles is one month, with a standard deviation of 1.12 months. The 2001 recession is almost 19 standard deviations away from that average. Unless there had been hugely dramatic job growth after its 21 month lag, we would not expect the present jobs situation to be salutary.</p>
<p>We can use the JPT <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/04/march-jobs-numbers-in-context.html">(see previous post)</a> to evaluate post-recovery job creation. The last jobs recession ended August 2003. The mean JPT since August 2003 is one, which is also the long-term average JPT. Thus job growth since recovery has not been dramatic at all, just average. Given this evidence, a jobs shortfall is expected. The question then is what is its magnitude?</p>
<p>From 1948 to the present we have had wars, recessions, major technological changes, increased immigration, more women and fewer men in the work force, social disruptions, increased foreign competition, deregulation, declining union membership, a shift from manufacturing to service industries, increased levels of education, and globalization. Through all of that and whatever was missed, the working age population correlates strongly (r>0.99) with non-farm civilian job growth. It is most likely the major driver of job growth. Taking advantage of available data and this tight relationship, we estimate the range of jobs lost relative to the nation’s potential for job creation.</p>
<p>To estimate the low end of the shortfall, we fit the entire monthly population data, ages 18-64, to the payroll data, from January 1948 through March 2007, and then look at the end-point difference. One reason this estimate is low is because not everybody stops work at age 65. Another is we have fitted all the data, including the extended downturn which is the focus of this post. From the following chart we see the shortfall is at least 5 million jobs.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Ri5ByKxyM2I/AAAAAAAAALo/uzzf8GlOE-0/s1600-h/Overlay18_64Jan48Apr24Post.gif"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Ri5ByKxyM2I/AAAAAAAAALo/uzzf8GlOE-0/s320/Overlay18_64Jan48Apr24Post.gif" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>To estimate a cap on the jobs shortfall, working-age is redefined as all ages from 16-years old and up. This is what the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) often refers to as working age. This alternate population trend is fitted to the 20-year employment interval, January 1981 &#8211; December 2000. As the next chart shows, the two trend lines track very closely in that interval.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Ri5BqaxyM1I/AAAAAAAAALg/CfKJFQ6gGKE/s1600-h/Overlay16_Apr24Post.gif"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Ri5BqaxyM1I/AAAAAAAAALg/CfKJFQ6gGKE/s320/Overlay16_Apr24Post.gif" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Following the population trend beyond the 20-year interval to March 2007, gives a jobs shortfall of 12.3 million, which is viewed as an upper estimate. Thus the range for the current shortfall is between 5 and 12.3 million jobs.</p>
<p>As confirmation and a comparison, the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities <a href="http://www.cbpp.org/10-6-06inc.pdf">(CBPP)</a> using different methodology estimated the shortfall at 10 million jobs. That is within the 5 to 12.3 million range above.</p>
<p>Current job levels fall short of historical employment-population trends. And that gap has consequences. Rounding numbers for easy top-of-the-head calculations, assume a 10 million jobs shortfall. For perspective, that is more than 5% of the ages 18-64 population. Further, assume average individual annual income to be $30,000. Totaled, that is a $300 billion potential loss to the economy. If the average effective federal tax rate is 10%, then that is a $30 billion loss in annual tax revenue. This does not take into account Social Security contributions, state and local tax revenues, multiplier effects, or the long-term consequences of changes to the dependency ratio, the ratio of non-workers to workers. Nor does it take into account the kinds of jobs created or the impact on 10 million people&#8217;s lives.</p>

                                <p>In comments, Bruce Webb tells us he has links to the<a href="http://bruceweb.blogspot.com/">Analysis of the SS Trustee&#8217;s report up</a>.</p>
<p>
<blockquote>First consider the Cost of Nothing.</p>
<p>The 2005 Report projected a payroll gap up from 2004, to 1.92% from 1.89%. Which is what you would expect, problem left unaddressed got worse. But if you quantified it you ended up with 1.89% of your income left in your pocket compared with an additional .03% obligation going forward. Well that means that anyone less than 63 years from retirement was dollars ahead by doing nothing. The math is even more stark if the payroll gap drops as it did in this Report.</p>
<p>The payroll gap was 2.23% in 1997 when I first started downloading the Report. Each and every year I looked at the numbers and implicitly calculated the Cost of Nothing. It always came out as a positive number.</p>
<p>If we had listened to the crisismongers in 1997 each and every one of us would have had an additional 2.23% out of our wage and 1.12% out of our paycheck. In effect Nothing was a decade long tax cut for workers.</p>
<p>Nothing is a Plan. A proven Plan. The 2007 Report simply validates that Plan.</p>
<p>There is a word for a problem that left unaddressed on balance gets a little bit better every year that passes. That word is not &#8216;Crisis&#8217;. Leave Social Security alone. Leave the cap alone. Social Security is healing itself.</p></blockquote>
<p>three dots</p>
<p>
<blockquote><strong>Well this will be a busy morning. I just moved my blog from old blogspot to new google which had the side effect of enabling comments.</strong> So we will see how that goes.</p>
<p>For now I put up a 2007 page that is limited to links through to the HTML version of the 2007 Report. So if I ever say cite Table V.B1 and don&#8217;t link to it you can simply click on List of Tables and check for yourself. Actually that is why I set up the blog in the first place, it was a convenient place to cut links from to paste in comments. </p>
<p>Now my favorite Figure is II.D7. It plots the Trust Fund Ratio by year in graphic form for all three alternatives. It allows you to visually see the important bend points. As an example Intermediate Cost (curve II on the graph) is a nice parabola peaking at 2017 at a 400% Trust Fund Ratio and then sinking to nothing in (now) 2041.  </p>
<p>More interesting to me though is the curve represented by &#8216;I&#8217;. That is Low Cost. It peaks at just under 500% in 2019, plateaus there until about 2023, drops to 400% in 2040, is relatively flat until 2070 when it actually starts trending up at a rate significantly steeper than the 2006 Report.</p>
<p>If we hit Low Cost numbers then Nothing will be a proven plan. Now taking the entirety of the data set some elements of Low Cost are fairly pessimistic, I think 2.0% ultimate Productivity is certainly reachable, and the Immigration numbers are nonsense. On the other hand I have to admit that 4.5% ultimate Unemployment is kind of optimistic. But on balance at worst the curve is going to come out somewhat farther out than &#8216;II&#8217;s 2041. Will it actually come out with &#8216;I&#8217;s fully funded with no change in benefits, retirement age, cap or tax rate? I don&#8217;t know. But there is almost zero risk to punting any decision down the road a year.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>Right now, China’s economy seems inextricably linked to the economy of the U.S. The argument we repeatedly hear is that China, indeed the world, depends on the U.S. consumer. The U.S. is, we are told, the consumer of last resort. Our consumption powers the world economy. As the U.S. goes, so goes the world. I think this is a questionable assumption.</p>
<p>It is not in China’s or the world&#8217;s interest to be forever wed to the U.S. consumer.</p>
<p>On this score, Keth Brasher has an interesting article: <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/04/17/business/trade.php">U.S. market is losing its appeal for China</a></p>
<p>
<blockquote>The strength of the euro propelled China’s exports to the European Union market past its exports to the United States for the first time in February.</p>
<p>China sent more than 31 per cent of its exports to the United States in 2000, but that dropped below 24 percent in November and hit 22.7 percent in February, according to tabulation by Goldman Sachs that includes Chinese goods transshipped through Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Frank Levin, the U.S. under secretary of commerce for international trade, said, “China has been making more of an effort in recent years to diversify its export markets.” He noted that China’s share of all American imports is still climbing but at a slowing rate.</p></blockquote>
<p>In short, the rest of the world is taking up the slack as the U.S. economy slows.</p>
<p>“Natural enough,” you say. &#8220;Furthermore,&#8221; you add, “The U.S. stock market continues to soar, certainly a clear sign that our economic health is fine.” I do not think it is. Nor do I see the stock market as a clear reflection of our economic strength.</p>
<p>Let’s step back for a moment and take a hard look at some factual data:
<ol>
<li>Of the Fortune 500, at least 450 are now in China.</li>
<li>Between 2000 and 2003, foreign firms built over <a href="http://www.ibm.com/ibm/governmentalprograms/samforeignaffairs.pdf">60,000</a> manufacturing plants in China. Some of these target the Chinese market; most target the world market. U.S. firms have been at the forefront of this development.</li>
<li>FDI in China accounts for 60% of its exports; 80% of its exports in IT.</li>
</ol>
<p>Yes, the stock market is doing well. U.S. corporations that have relocated factories and plants in China and other developing countries are doing very well, indeed. The stock market is more a reflection of their health and activity in China than of the health of the U.S. economy. Remember: Those firms are China&#8217;s export engine.</p>
<p>“But,” you say, “the U.S. is still an economic powerhouse.” My counter is simply: Year by year, that economic powerhouse is losing oomph. Consider the following:</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>From 1994-2001, <a href="http://www.mep.nist.gov/manufacturing-innovation-nam.pdf">U.S. share of world trade</a> was a relatively stable 13%. In 2003, its share declined to 10.7. In 2004, its share was 10.2. Not a good direction. . Furthermore, U.S. share of global trade in industries such as machinery and equipment is falling. The U.S. now runs a trade deficit in advanced technology products, 21st century goods, goods that leaders of the 21st century should be expected to produce.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now ask the question: What can we expect in the U.S. as our own rate of growth slows, as we experience a soft or hard landing, as China and other developing nations diversify their markets, and as the dollar softens. Below are some strong possibilities:
<ul>
<li>An increase in the cost of energy—and those products dependent on oil&#8211;, some raw materials, and imported goods.</li>
<li>A continued downward pressure on U.S. wages. China and the developing world will continue to be “wage-competitive.”</li>
<li>A continued flow of U.S. companies to China and other developing countries. U.S. corporations in China and elsewhere are not returning, despite a weakened dollar.</li>
<li>A strong U.S. stock market, reflective more of U.S. companies abroad than our own economic health.</li>
<li>An increasing temptation for well-heeled foreigners to buy American assets as the dollar weakens vis-à-vis their currencies. Maybe someone will buy I-95.</li>
<li>A growing possibility that other countries will not continue to finance our debt as the dollar weakens.</li>
<li>More and more talk of reducing or privatizing our social safety net.</li>
<li>An increase in the disparity of wealth in the U.S. and elsewhere.</li>
</ul>
<p>Not a rosy picture. One image comes repeatedly to mind: The U.S.—with its vast wealth and powerful technology—is “seeding” the world and may well expire in the effort.</p>
<p>China’s entry into the WTO, globalization itself, has set in motion forces that are rapidly moving beyond anything we can do.</p>
<p>In future posts, I will look at China’s long-range plans as China itself sees them, together with their implications for the U.S. and the world.</p>

                            </p>
                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>If Bush hadn&#8217;t decided to invade Iraq, what would things look like now?</p>
<p>1.  Would the situation in Afghanistan be stable?  Perhaps.  More US troops might have made a difference.  But NATO troops clearly are not enough to turn the tide, and their equipment is the same as ours.  Their leadership is essentially the same &#8211; the US in the end calls the shots.  </p>
<p>One big problem in Afghanistan today is that there still don&#8217;t seem to be any real disincentives to elements in Pakistan that want to help the Taliban or Al Qaeda, or to Saudis that want to send them money.  Why would things be any different if there had been no invasion of Iraq?</p>
<p>2.  Spending.  The cost of the war in Iraq would go away, or at least drop to the containment levels from before the invasion.  What about the rest of the Federal spending?  Probably no change.  Outlays increased from 18.4% of GDP in 2000 to 18.5% of GDP in 2001 and 19.4% of GDP in 2002.  Thereafter, they&#8217;ve been at about 20% or higher.  Tax cuts&#8230; no change.  Thus, Iraq probably hasn&#8217;t had a huge effect on the short term health of the economy. </p>
<p>3.  Islamic fundamentalism.  There weren&#8217;t many in Iraq before this mess.  Maybe some Iraqis have allied themselves with fundamentalists (the enemy of my enemy), and perhaps the US invasion has created a few.  Its hard to see how invading Iraq weakened the Islamofascists or whatever the term of art is these days on the right wing blogs.</p>
<p>4.  Other big enemies.  Remember how China used to be a strategic competitor or some such according to GW?  And remember what happened when GW tangled with them?  Basically, the Chinese military got a US spy plane for a month to take apart and rebuild, and GW got to apologize to them.  Imagine if GW had continued to focus on China all this time.  Imagine what the PLA could do to the military under that man&#8217;s leadership given what&#8217;s happened in Afghanistan and Iraq.  So perhaps its a good thing </p>
<p>5.  Corruption.  Would there be any fewer Karl Roves or Alberto Gonzalez or Claude Allens?  I don&#8217;t think so.</p>

<p>Reader Bill White writes (slightly edited):</p>
<blockquote><p>[T]he world&#8217;s most expensive military has lost wars in 6 years against one of the world&#8217;s poorest countries and a country that had already been weakened by years of sanctions and no-fly zones.  Something is wrong with the guiding philosophy of the people who were in charge.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is an excellent point.  These aren&#8217;t the Germans or the Japanese in the 1940s, that had conquered half of the world.  These aren&#8217;t the Cold War Soviets, or the People&#8217;s Liberation Army.  These aren&#8217;t proxies for any of the above, or supported by anything like any of the above.  </p>
<p>And yes, I&#8217;ve heard the argument that Afghanistan is where empires go to die.  But the British invasion was more than a century ago.  Before helicopters and transport planes.  Hiding in the hills actually qualified as hiding in those days.  But not in an era of satellites, spy planes, and night vision goggles.  And yes, they managed to stymie the Soviets&#8230; but with the help of another Superpower, the US.  Who is helping them now?  Some elements of Pakistani intelligence and some Pakistani tribesmen with some Saudis sending them money.  Come on&#8230;  a pick-up truck-ful of drunk Texans should be able to beat the Taliban and AQ together, provided their supply of beer and ammo holds out.  So what&#8217;s going on here?</p>
<p>My opinion&#8230; this is a sign of incompetence.  The Deciderer, the cheerleaders, and the rest simply have no ability to do things right.</p>

<p>Update.   As I noted in many previous posts, I don&#8217;t think that any of this reflects on the troops.  I think that they are doing the best they can be doing under the circumstances, the circumstances being those imposed on them by the administration.</p>

                                <p>Via <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2007/04/23/wilt-troops/">Think Progress</a>, an article by <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/wilt-article">Army Sgt. Jim Wilt</a>, a public affairs officer at Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan.  Wilt writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>BAGRAM AIRFIELD, Afghanistan &#8211; Following the deaths of 32 Virginia Tech students, the President of the United States ordered that all American flags be flown at half-staff for one week. </p>
<p>In accordance with the president’s order, the U.S. flag at Bagram Airfield was raised to half-staff.</p>
<p>The deaths of the 32 students are a tragedy that was felt throughout the world. Even Afghan President Hamid Karazi gave his condolences to the U.S. on the loss of so many young lives. The president of a country, which has seen more than its fair share of young deaths, tipped his proverbial hat to these young people. </p>
<p>But I find it ironic that the flags were flown at half-staff for the young men and women who were killed at VT yet it is never lowered for the death of a U.S. servicemember. </p>
<p>Is the life of Sgt. Alexander Van Aalten, a member of our very own task force, killed April 20 in Helmand province not valued the same as these 32 students? Surely his death was as violent as the students. </p>
<p>Aalten’s death lacked the shock factor of the Virginia massacre. It is a daily occurrence these days to see X number of U.S. troops killed in Iraq or Afghanistan scrolling across the ticker at the bottom of the TV screen. People have come to expect casualty counts in the nightly news; they don’t expect to see 32 students killed.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Department of Defense directives mandate we honor our fallen leaders from former presidents to the state governors, but there is no provision for the men and women who die preserving our way of life. </p></blockquote>
<p>three dots</p>
<blockquote><p>If the flags on our FOBs were lowered for just one day after the death of a servicemember, it would show the people who knew the person that society cared, the American people care.</p></blockquote>
<p>I think Wilt is right.  Sadly, I don&#8217;t think society or the American people care.  I&#8217;m pretty sure the folks responsible for sending them over there, and for cheerleader the decision makers, don&#8217;t care.</p>

                                <p>Frederick W. Kagan and Max Boot each have lengthy articles in Weekly Standard 30 Apr 2007.</p>
<p>Clear and hold is from Kagan&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Where is the hold strategy?  Where are the resources and how long do we hold, whatever Kagan means by that? </p>
<p>He later says:</p>
<p>&#8220;Today, victory is up for grabs, and the stakes for America are rising as the conflict between us and al Qaeda shifts to the fore. It is no hyperbole to recognize that a precipitous American withdrawal would undermine the current positive trends and increase the likelihood of mass killing and state collapse. Painful and uncertain as it is, the wisest course now is to support our commander and our soldiers and civilians, as they struggle to foster security in Iraq and to defeat the enemies who have sworn to destroy us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mass killings and state collapse exist now, hve for 4 years and only get worse.</p>
<p>There is no mention of the hold strategy in the surge.</p>
<p>Kagan is predicting failure, he knows it as well as I.</p>
<p>There is no action being done by our commanders to foster security in Iraq and nothing we are doing will defeat anyone.</p>

<p>When does Bush start the struggle?</p>

<blockquote><p>To a great extent, a lot of the credit goes to President Bush and his economic team. In 2001 and 2003, the Republican-led Congress worked with the president to pass the best-timed and most effective tax relief since Reagan’s tax overhaul in the early 1980s. However, much of that tax relief is now threatened with extinction. The Democrats in Congress have made no move to extend these tax cuts past the planned 2010 expiration date, adding considerable uncertainty to the economy. A Democrat in the White House would only make the tax cuts&#8217; expiration a near certainty. This potential tax increase threatens future economic growth and prosperity. In 2009, we need a president who understands that free-market capitalism is why America grows. We need a president who understands that conservative economic policies of low taxes, limited government and free trade work.</p></blockquote>
<p>Someone needs to remind Mr. Weber that the alleged recovery from the 2001 recession has been anemic.  Someone should also point out to him that Federal spending as a share of GDP has gone up.  To which – Milton Friedman’s adage that “To Spend is to Tax” certainly applies here.  Someone should also remind Mr. Weber that Bush’s record on trade issues has been awful.  But then maybe President Romney has some specifics on how to reduce the size of the Federal government.  Let’s see:</p>
<blockquote><p>The centerpiece of Governor Romney’s proposals to limit the size and scope of government is his pledge to veto any budget &#8211; Republican or Democrat &#8211; that does not cap non-defense discretionary spending at the rate of inflation minus one percent. This will save taxpayers $300 billion over ten years. Governor Romney will also seek line-item veto power and lead a review of each individual federal program to eliminate bureaucracy and waste.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sounds like the same old non-specific song and dance to me.  But even if Federal spending is cut by $30 per year – that’s peanuts compared to the size of the General Fund deficit.  This is from the policy chairman for Romney’s campaign.  Sorry to say this – but we’ve already had six years of this foolish nonsense on fiscal policy.</p>

                                <p>Readers JackNYC and Bruce Webb point out that the new Social Security Trustee&#8217;s Annual Report is out.  The summary is <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/pressoffice/pr/trustee07-pr.htm">Trustee&#8217;s here</a>, the full report is <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR07/trTOC.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not the best person to discuss it, so I&#8217;m waiting patiently.  I&#8217;m sure eventually Bruce and others will go through the numbers in detail and provide a report.  Meanwhile, some details from JackNYC: </p>
<blockquote><p>The projected point at which tax revenues will fall below program costs comes in 2017 &#8212; the same as the estimate in last year’s report. </p>
<p>The projected point at which the Trust Funds will be exhausted comes in 2041 &#8212; one year later than the projection in last year’s report. </p>
<p>The projected actuarial deficit over the 75-year long-range period is 1.95 percent of taxable payroll &#8212; .06 percentage point smaller than in last year’s report. </p>
<p>Over the 75-year period, the Trust Funds would require additional revenue equivalent to $4.7 trillion in today’s dollars to pay all scheduled benefits. This unfunded obligation is about $100 billion higher than the amount estimated last year.</p></blockquote>
<p>Bruce Webb adds:  &#8220;2007 productivity under Intermediate Cost 1.7%.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p>Update.  Reader coberly adds:</p>
<blockquote><p>by the way, that $4.7 Trillion over seventy five years and 100 million workers, is 627 dollars per year per worker, or 12 dollars per week.</p>
<p>this is not 12 bucks for lattes. or tweve bucks into some government black hole. this is twelve bucks to pay for living 6 years longer on average.</p></blockquote>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>B. Linsay Lowell and Johanna Avato of Georgetown University recently did a <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/316/5822/184a?maxtoshow=&#038;HITS=10&#038;hits=10&#038;RESULTFORMAT=&#038;andorexacttitleabs=and&#038;andorexactfulltext=and&#038;searchid=1&#038;FIRSTINDEX=0&#038;volume=316&#038;firstpage=184&#038;resourcetype=HWCIT">study</a> &#8220;that shows that science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workers holding an H-1B&#8230;earn 5% less than natives employed in similar positions.&#8221;</p>
<p>In February, pgl devoted a <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/02/bill-gates-advocates-immigration-reform.html">thread</a> to this topic. One of the posters, Dave from Battlefield, a long-time IT worker, had this to say about Gates&#8217; comment that Microsoft pays foreign workers the same as American workers:</p>
<p>&#8220;Except that it is untrue. A flat out lie, in fact. Period, end of paragraph.&#8221;</p>
<p>Looks like Dave was right.</p>
<p>Now there is a twist to the study, an important one to understand. Look at the following:</p>
<p>Overall H-1B Visas: -5% of American wage<br />Don&#8217;t Change Jobs: -11% of American wage<br />Entered as Students: -16% of American wage<br />Entered as Workers: +14% of American wage (45% of the total)</p>
<p>What&#8217;s going on here?</p>
<blockquote><p>Lowell speculates that foreign workers are paid less because they are often compelled to remain with the same employer to get permanent residency within the 6 years of stay allowed by their visas&#8230;One solution, Lowell says, is to grant permanent residency to foreign workers right off the bat.</p></blockquote>
<p>In short, they are akin to indentured servants, unable to enter fully the marketplace.</p>
<p>The rejoinder is:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Either these foreign temporary workers are not &#8216;the best and the brightest,&#8217; or companies are hiring them to hold down starting wages&#8211;or both,&#8221; says Jack Martin of the Federation for American Immigration Reform in Washington, D.C.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, I am very liberal, as many have, to their horror, recognized. But, when it comes to immigration abuses, I staunch my bleeding heart and say: Enough, already. If we want to encourage our own citizens to enter science, math, and technology, we should do just that: Create conditions where our best and brightest will choose those areas. Simply flooding the job market with foreign students is not the answer. More than once I have heard of gifted scientists throwing up their hands in despair, leaving science to make a needed buck in some bank or financial house.</p>
