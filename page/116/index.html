                                <p>by <strong>Mike Kimel</strong><br />Today is a travel day for me. I&#8217;m flying to Toronto to give a lecture on ensemble methods, a statistical approach which involves combining estimates produced by other methods. Its something I first worked on in 2001, and come to think about it, perhaps it deserves a post. But not today. </p>
<p>Today&#8217;s post, written a few days ago, isn&#8217;t about statistics or economics. In fact, I have no idea what it is is about, but I do want your opinion. What follows is absolutely true with any caveats being due to my poor memory.</p>
<p>In the late 1990s, I was living in Little Rock, AR, where, on weekends, I used to enjoy mountain biking. Once, while biking with a friend through the woods in the middle of nowhere (if memory serves, we weren&#8217;t even on a trail but rather biking down a dried up riverbed with no signs of civilization for miles around), we stumbled on a coffin. Said coffin was cheaply made of metal and showed clear signs of having spent quality time underground. But there were a couple other more notable things about the coffin. The first is that someone had clearly taken a sledgehammer to the front of the coffin and broken it open. I&#8217;m not sure why &#8211; I would have assumed that the coffin could have simply been opened by lifting the front cover. Another odd thing is that the coffin, which had spent some time underground, was empty. The interior lining was somewhat rotted, providing more evidence that it had spent time underground. </p>
<p>We looked at the coffin for a few moments, and then, wordlessly, got back on our bikes and went back the way we came. We never rode in that area again. The other night, I was thinking about this long ago episode and realized that though I pride myself as an individual who has a lot of imagination, I can construct no credible backstory for what I saw that day. Can you?</p>

                                <p>by Tom aka Rusty Rustbelt<br />  Health care thoughts:  Cross-conflicting regulations, employer confusion</p>
<p>  Most of you will be familiar with the medication drowsiness warnings to the effect of &#8220;don&#8217;t operate machinery or heavy equipment, etc. etc.&#8221;  This is from FDA regs.  (<a href="http://www.fda.gov/">www.FDA.gov</a>.)  </p>
<p>OSHA has extensive guidance about employee safety with manufacturing machinery, heavy equipment and driving and the impact of drowsiness. (<a href="http://www.osha.gov/">www.OSHA.gov</a>)  </p>
<p>So it seemed sensible for employers to ask for voluntary disclosure by employees taking pain medications in these work environments, because OSHA puts the safety burden on the employers.</p>
<p>  Not so fast!  The EEOC (www.EEOC.gov) is litigating cases claiming the request for medication information is a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act.  For a plain English summary of a recent case see   <a href="http://www.lawupdates.com/industry_news/entry/minn._company_settles_case_that_arose_from_firing_of_long-time_employee_for" target="_blank">The EEOC</a>.  </p>
<p>So pretend you are the employer.  Which regulation do you see as primary? Anyone have a workable solution?</p>

<p> Common Cause Claims ALEC Violated Tax Exempt Lobbying Restrictions</p>
<p> The Common Cause organization filed a complaint with the IRS under 26 USC 7623, the tax whistleblower act,  alleging that the American Legislative Exchange Council violated the lobbying restrictions applicable to tax exempt organizations through underreporting and operating in furtherance of private corporate interests.   The complaint argues that &#8220;ALEC&#8217;s primary purpose is to provide a vehicle for its corporate members to lobby state legislators and to deduct the costs of such efforts as charitable contributions. ALEC drafts “model” legislation provided by its corporate and legislative members, and lobbies for the adoption of that legislation. These goals are fundamentally inconsistent with ALEC&#8217;s claimed tax-exempt status as a charitable organization.&#8221;</p>
<p>The following paragraphs are from the introduction to the complaint.<br />
<blockquote>This matter concerns the massive underreporting of lobbying by the American Legislative Exchange Council (“ALEC”). While ostensibly a nonprofit organization under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, ALEC&#8217;s primary purpose is to provide a vehicle for its corporate members to lobby state legislators and to deduct the costs of such efforts as charitable contributions. ALEC drafts “model” legislation provided by its corporate and legislative members, and lobbies for the adoption of that legislation. These goals are fundamentally inconsistent with ALEC&#8217;s claimed tax-exempt status as a charitable organization under <a href="http://taxandaccounting.bna.com/btac/display/link_res.adp?fedfid=25904513&#038;fname=usc_26_501_c_3_&#038;vname=dtrnot">26 U.S.C. §501(c)(3)</a>, because (i) “no substantial part” of a charity&#8217;s activity can be “attempting to influence legislation,” and (ii) ALEC&#8217;s activities do not qualify under any of the enumerated purposes of Section 501(c)(3).</p></blockquote>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />
<blockquote>This scheme causes harm to taxpayers in two distinct ways. First, ALEC&#8217;s activities constitute an abuse of its 501(c)(3) tax exemption, which is reserved for organizations “operated exclusively ” for a limited number of purposes, such as “religious, charitable, scientific … or educational purposes ….” <a href="http://taxandaccounting.bna.com/btac/display/link_res.adp?fedfid=25904513&#038;fname=usc_26_501_c_3_&#038;vname=dtrnot">26 U.S.C. §501(c)(3)</a>. Second, ALEC&#8217;s corporate members improperly deduct from their taxable income the dues and other contributions made to ALEC; such expenditures are non-deductible lobbying expenses under Section 162(e). In fact, because ALEC solicits very few contributions from individuals, its false claims of tax-exempt status appear driven by the desire of ALEC corporate members to deduct lobbying expenses as charitable contributions.<br />ALEC&#8217;s primary, if not sole objective is to “influence legislation.” Its bylaws state that its purpose is to “formulate legislative action programs,” “disseminate model legislation and promote the introduction of companion bills in Congress and state legislatures,” and “[e]establish a clearinghouse for bills at the state level, and provide for a bill exchange program.” <a href="http://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=5048766" name="a0d1q0j3r2_ref"></a><a href="http://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=5048766" name="a0d1q0j3r2_reffirst_footref"></a><a href="http://taxandaccounting.bna.com/btac/T11100/doc_display.adp?fedfid=25904513&#038;vname=dtrnot&#038;jd=a0d1p9w8r8&#038;split=0#a0d1q0j3r2"><sup>1</sup></a> As recently as April 11, 2012, ALEC boasted that “for years, ALEC has partnered with legislators to research and develop better, more effective … legislation. <a href="http://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=5048766" name="a0d1q0j3r5_ref"></a><a href="http://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=5048766" name="a0d1q0j3r5_reffirst_footref"></a><a href="http://taxandaccounting.bna.com/btac/T11100/doc_display.adp?fedfid=25904513&#038;vname=dtrnot&#038;jd=a0d1p9w8r8&#038;split=0#a0d1q0j3r5"><sup>2</sup></a>Notwithstanding these claims, however, ALEC has reported ”for years“ to the IRS that it has not spent a single penny on lobbying or attempting to influence legislation. These tax returns are patently false.  (Complaint available <a href="http://taxandaccounting.bna.com/btac/T11100/split_display.adp?fedfid=25904513&#038;vname=dtrnot&#038;jd=a0d1p9w8r8&#038;split=0">here</a>, on BNA&#8217;s tax service)</p></blockquote>
<p>The complaint goes on to specify how ALEC develops legislation and works to get that model language enacted.  The following is an excerpt from this portion.</p>
<blockquote><p>ALEC boasts about how frequently its bills are introduced in state legislatures to show its influence over the legislative process, publishing “scorecards” to demonstrate the high numbers of ALEC bills enacted. [Exhibit 9] In its 1995 scorecard, then-ALEC Executive Director Samuel A. Brunelli explicitly stated that corporations join ALEC to drive a legislative agenda in a cost effective way: “’This was a landmark legislative year in ALEC&#8217;s history,’ said ALEC Executive Director Samuel A. Brunelli. ’With our success rate at more than 20 percent, I would say that ALEC is a good investment. Nowhere else can you get a return that high.’” [Exhibit 11] Similarly, in a brochure that ALEC distributed to recruit more corporations for its private sector membership, it claimed that “during each legislative cycle, ALEC legislators introduce more than 1,000 pieces of legislation based on these models, approximately 17 percent of which are enacted. ” [Exhibit 12] It is telling that ALEC expresses its success in corporate terms, as a good “return” on a corporation&#8217;s “investment” in tax-exempt lobbying.<br />Beyond quantifying its influence by measuring how often its lobbying efforts succeed, ALEC trumpets how its Task Forces and other programs provide corporations with direct access to state legislators. In a near textbook definition of lobbying, the recruitment brochure states “ALEC provides the private sector with an unparalleled opportunity to have its voice heard, and its perspective appreciated, by the legislative members.” !d. The brochure further explains that “[t]his partnership identifies issues and then responds with common-sense, result- oriented policies. The two groups work in unison to solve the challenges facing the nation, with results that will define the American political landscape in the 21st century.” Jd. In other words, ALEC provides a network to influence the legislative process and deliver “results” to its private 13 corporate membership &#8211; namely, legislation favorable to corporate members&#8217; interests. These statements by ALEC belie any claim that it is engaged in “education” rather than lobbying . The ALEC Task Forces provide a venue for corporations to lobby legislators while deducting the expenses as charitable donations.</p></blockquote>
<p>The complaint goes on to outline the way ALEC presses for legislation, including issue alerts and one-on-one contacts with key legislators, bill tracking documents, model press releases and talking points to assist legislators in getting its model legislation passed,  hearing testimony by staffers in support of the ALEC legislation, and even  luxury conferences three times annually to which legislators are encouraged to bring families for subsidized work/vacations.</p>
<blockquote><p>Legislator members on ALEC Task Forces are also eligible for “ALEC scholarships,” which reimburse a legislator&#8217;s accommodation, transportation and other expenses to attend the ALEC national conferences. Scholarships are also available for legislators to attend other events, including “ALEC Academies,” which are described as a “two-day intensive program on a specific issue;’ attended by invited members of both the public and private sector. Contributions to the ALEC scholarship fund are made by corporations who are solicited directly by legislators at the individual state level. See Exhibit 18 (a breakdown of payments to the ALEC in Ohio scholarship fund). According to the tax filings of PhRMA, the pharmaceutical lobbying group and ALEC private sector member, it provided $356,075 to the ALEC scholarship fund in 2010. <a href="http://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=5048766" name="a0d1q0j3v8_ref"></a><a href="http://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=5048766" name="a0d1q0j3v8_reffirst_footref"></a><a href="http://taxandaccounting.bna.com/btac/T11100/doc_display.adp?fedfid=25904513&#038;vname=dtrnot&#038;jd=a0d1p9w8r8&#038;split=0#a0d1q0j3v8"><sup>13</sup></a>Many of these expenses are likely deducted from corporate taxable income. The ALEC conferences are nothing more than a forum for tax-subsidized lobbying. ALEC provides logistical support in the form of travel, accommodations, entertainment, and family services, in order to facilitate lobbying by ALEC&#8217;s corporate members targeting ALEC&#8217;s legislative members.</p></blockquote>
<p>The complaint considers whether ALEC even qualifies as a 501(c)(3) organization.  Suggesting that the only possible qualifying purpose that might be claimed is educational, the complaint concludes that ALEC clearly fails to satisfy any concept of an educational non-profit.</p>
<blockquote><p>[E]ven if a tortured interpretation of the regulations led to the conclusion that ALEC is not engaged in lobbying, ALEC would fail to satisfy the most basic requirement for 501(c)(3) status &#8211; operations that are exclusively for charitable purposes . ALEC&#8217;s operations are neither charitable nor educational, much less exclusively so. They are pecuniary and political, and devoted to fostering the enactment of bills that will financially benefit and further the ideological goals of ALEC&#8217;s corporate membership.</p></blockquote>

<p>Why Tax Cuts for the 1% Are Self-Defeating  </p>
<p><img alt="Why Tax Cuts for the 1% Are Self-Defeating" height="205" src="http://www.policymic.com/articles/5705/photo.jpg" width="325"><br />Annual U.S. income share of the top 1%. </p>
<p>A new <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/house-gops-ryan-to-unveil-new-budget/2012/03/16/gIQA2dUULS_story.html?wpisrc=nl_wonk">GOP budget</a> released Tuesday brings renewed attention onto the issues of tax policy and the economy. Of course, there will be debate over what effects various policy options would have on the economy, something I have previously addressed in a previous <a href="http://www.policymic.com/articles/3429/tax-cuts-for-the-wealthy-will-not-stimulate-the-economy-government-spending-on-infrastructure-will">article</a>. But inevitably, there will also be arguments made by Republicans regarding the fairness of those policies as well.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>The problem with many of the GOP arguments made in regard to fairness is that they lead to a self-defeating paradox in either the logic of the argument, or in the outcomes of their recommended policy solutions. <br />For example, one common argument made is on the grounds that it is unfair for the wealthiest to pay higher taxes since they are already paying the most federal income tax while many people pay none at all. But this argument is flawed in multiple ways. </p>
<p>First of all, the logic of this argument is paradoxical. As the wealthy get wealthier while others <a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/nov/18/joe-biden/biden-says-middle-income-earners-lost-ground-reces/">fall behind</a> in comparison, the share of tax burden on the wealthy would continually increase. In other words, this logic would suggest that the closer the wealthiest come to earning 100% of total income, the more unfairly they are being treated since their share of income taxes edges closer to 100% as well. And by contrast, it would be considered more fair for the wealthy if their incomes fall while others&#8217; incomes rise, since taxes paid would be more equal. </p>
<p>Second, the big irony here is that the policies that would seem to make it more fair for the wealthy in the short-term (lowering their tax rates at the expense of other policy options) are policies that would tend to further increase income disparity in the long-term. This is due to these policies&#8217; lower effect on creating demand (lower <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keynesian_multiplier">economic multiplier</a>), which means less need for labor (a weaker labor market). <br />Let me explain. The wages that average working people can expect depends on the overall demand for labor. If unemployment is very low, businesses must compete harder for labor. People will find more opportunities available, more competing offers, and find it easier to change jobs. This pressures business to offer more competitive wages, among other things.</p>
<p>In other words, policies that facilitate strong demand and thus strong employment lead to higher incomes for labor, which narrows income disparity. This real income growth due to strong employment is something we can see happening in <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/caixin-china-survey-an-era-of-wage-growth-2011-08-18">China</a>, for example. </p>
<p>In addition, this type of stronger income growth will itself fuel stronger demand. We typical refer to this as a strong middle class. The stronger demand it generates in the economy supplants the need for demand-creating policies, which means those polices can be slowly rolled back. This can even happen automatically to an extent, as a larger, wealthier middle class pays more taxes, and that increased revenue can be used even for a tax cut for the wealthiest. </p>
<p>Achieving an ideal conservative vision of the economy and of government tax policy by enacting conservative-favored policies is a self-defeating paradox. Ironically, the path to this ideal conservative outcome can only be achieved by first enacting liberal policies</p>

<p><strong>They Also Serve Who Only Stand and Graph:  A Graphical Response to Paul Krugman on the Effect QE1 and QE2</strong>           </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve taken a lot of flak for critiquing two posts by Paul Krugman in two posts of my own (the second one is <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/04/what-is-question-responding-to-paul.html">here</a>).     </p>
<p>To summarize the point where people keep telling me I&#8217;m wrong, it has to do with quotes from Prof. Krugman&#8217;s pieces, and whether or not I&#8217;m misinterpreting those quotes.  So I&#8217;m going to try this again&#8230;  I&#8217;m going to put up the quotes and tell you how I&#8217;ve been told I should be interpreting those quotes.  Then I&#8217;m going to put up a graph.       </p>
<p>Before I get started, I want to be clear:  Prof. Krugman is often the only voice of reason, particularly on issues like austerity and taxes, among those allowed up onto the platform to speak.  What follows is not a polemic against Prof. Krugman.  All of us are wrong sometimes.  But I&#8217;m focusing on this issue precisely because it seems to be one of the factors leading one of the few voices of reason out there astray on an important issue.     Anyway, enough with the editorial comment.  First, a quote from Prof. Krugman&#8217;s <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/20/plutocrats-and-printing-presses/">first post</a>.     <br />
<blockquote>Furthermore, Fed efforts to do this probably tend on average to hurt, not help, bankers. Banks are largely in the business of borrowing short and lending long; anything that compresses the spread between short rates and long rates is likely to be bad for their profits.<strong> <bold>And the things the Fed is trying to do are in fact largely about compressing that spread</bold>,</strong> either by persuading investors that it will keep short rates at zero for a longer time or by going out and buying long-term assets. These are actions you would expect to make bankers angry, not happy — and that’s what has actually happened.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now, from Prof. Krugman&#8217;s <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/22/qe-or-not-qe-that-is-the-question/">second post</a> in which he responds directly to me    :</p>
<blockquote><p>Ordinary monetary policy involves cutting short-term rates to fight a slump; it’s not what we’re talking about here, since it’s hard up against the zero lower bound.  <bold>But the large-scale conventional expansion the Fed engaged in by getting to the zero bound has, of course, widened the spread between short and long term rates</bold>, <strong>since markets expect short rates to rise above zero eventually. So looking at the raw data on the short-long spread tells you nothing.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />The bolding, in both cases, is mine.       Now, I&#8217;ve had people writing to tell me I&#8217;ve interpreted these two paragraphs the wrong way.  The way to interpret them, I&#8217;m told (and now that it has been pointed out, I can see the logic) is this:</p>
<p>1.  The Fed engaged in conventional expansion at the beginning of the financial meltdown, and that widened the spread between the short term rate at which the banks borrow and the long term rates at which the banks lend.    </p>
<p>2.  During the nonconventional expansions (i.e., QE1 and QE2), the spread narrowed).    </p>
<p>3.  Banks prefer wider spreads, and thus, we have evidence that banks are actually unhappy with the things the Fed is (or was) trying to do.     </p>
<p>Point number 1 is partly consistent with the graph shown in <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/04/paul-krugman-is-very-very-wrong.html">my first post on the topic</a>, or at least kind of.  The graph shows the spread between the FF rate and the 30 year mortgage rate.  (i.e., the spread between the shortest rate at which banks borrow and the longest rate at which they regularly lend.)  As the graph shows, the spreads widened&#8230;  but best I can tell, they hit a local bottom in December of 2006.   That big process of widening of spreads began in early December 2006.       </p>
<p>If you think of monetary policy in terms of interest rates, which most people (and not to speak for Prof. Krugman, but based on reading his posts on a daily basis for many years, it is evident he does), there is nothing magical about early December 2006.  The Fed Funds rate was about 6.11% at the time.  It rose (not quite continuously) through mid June of 2007, but remained above 6.11%.  But from early Dec 2006 to mid June of 2007, the spread increased from 0.86 to  1.48, a jump of 72%.  Yes, as interest rates tightened, the spread continued rising, but the whole big rise got jumpstarted not with conventional monetary expansion, but rather with conventional monetary tightening, and this happened before anyone was thinking slump.        </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a second graph.  It shows the FF rate, the spread between the FF and the 30 year mortgage rate, QE1 and QE2.  The QEx periods are represented by the Gray bars.  I&#8217;ve also labeled the non-QEx periods as C1, C2 and C3 for &#8220;conventional 1,&#8221; &#8220;conventional 2,&#8221; and &#8220;conventional 3&#8221; &#8211; not that any of what we&#8217;ve seen in this time has been conventional.   </p>

<p>As I noted already, the C1 period is not entirely consistent with how I&#8217;ve been told I should be interpreting Prof. Krugman&#8217;s quotes, though it isn&#8217;t inconsistent with the quotes either.  Call it a wash.</p>
<p>What about QE1?  Well, the spread peaked the weak of Nov 6 2008 (spread of 5.96), and QE1 began on Nov 26 (spread of 5.41).   During QE1, the spread got as low as 4.59 in Dec 2009, and then widened out.  The spread was at 4.92 at the end of March 2010 when QE1 ended.       </p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know what to make of this.  Was QE1 telegraphed?  It sure doesn&#8217;t look like it if you at the FF, but I don&#8217;t know enough about that market.  I will only say that from where I&#8217;m standing, it sure likes the compression Prof. Krugman was talking about is due to something other than QE1.  I say this because the narrowing of the spread was actually about the same (actually, a smidge greater) over a three week period leading up to the start of QE1 as it was from the beginning of QE1 to the end of QE1.  Worse, it seems that the last four months of QE1 show a widening, not a compression of the spread.     </p>
<p>Where the story begins coming apart completely, though, comes in period C2. Somehow the spread begins to narrow precisely, and I do mean precisely, at the point where QE1 ends.  From March 31, 2010, to November, 2010, we see a narrowing of the spread that looks more like a straight line than anything else in the graph.     </p>
<p>And then&#8230;. the spreads begin to widen again beginning in early November 2010.  But QE2 began November 3, 2010, and, according to what people tell me, QE2 should have led to a narrowing of the spread, not the end of the narrowing of the spread.      </p>
<p>In sum, the evidence is neutral when it comes to what Prof. Krugman believes happened to the spread during QE1, and it contradicts his views on QE2.  None of this is to knock anyone, not Prof. Krugman, nor any of the folks who wrote me.  We&#8217;re living in unconventional times, and the old rules don&#8217;t apply.  I would merely suggest that in the light of this information, people re-evaluate whether unconventional monetary policy really is hurting the banks.  As I suggested in my previous two posts, I believe the evidence shows quite the opposite.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>I’m devastated that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Rudder">Christian Rudder</a> hasn’t posted to the <a href="http://blog.okcupid.com/">OKTrends</a> blog for more than a year.* He did statistical analysis of the monstrous database of <a href="http://www.okcupid.com/home">OK Cupid</a> — a dating site that asks participants hundreds of often odd and quirky questions about themselves — to draw out conclusions about various, sundry, and often fascinating topics.
<p>I also can’t believe that I never posted about a finding in one of his posts that really caught my eye — from <a href="http://blog.okcupid.com/index.php/the-best-questions-for-first-dates/">The Best Questions for a First Date</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>If you want to know…</strong></p>
<p>Do my date and I have the same politics?</p>
<p><strong>Ask him or her…</strong></p>
<p>Do you prefer the people in your life to be simple or complex?</p>
<p><strong>Because…</strong></p>
<p>We were very surprised to find that <strong>this one question very strongly predicts a person’s ideas on these divisive issues:</strong></p>
<p>Should burning your country’s flag be illegal?</p>
<p>Should the death penalty be abolished?</p>
<p>Should gay marriage be legal?</p>
<p>Should Evolution and Creationism be taught side-by-side in schools?</p>
<p>In each case, complexity-preferrers are 65-70% likely to give the Liberal answer. And those who prefer simplicity in others are 65-70% likely to give the Conservative one.</p>
<p>This correlation is for a nationwide dataset; it won’t be as useful in places where one ideology is much more prevalent than the other. For example, in New York City there are lots of people who like simplicity and yet have Liberal politics.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This jives perfectly with my own anecdotal observations: that conservatives tend to like simple answers to everything: “Just cut taxes!” or “<a href="http://www.themoneyillusion.com/?p=14001">It all boils down to X.</a>” (Scott Sumner deserves unlimited praise for acknowledging and battling that predilection in this link. That admission — along with the Rudder’s finding here — might also go a long way towards explaining why Steve Randy Waldmann <a href="http://www.interfluidity.com/v2/3087.html">thinks</a> that professedly right-ish Market Monetarists have more in common with generally lefty MMTers and Post-Keynesians than they or others might suspect, or than any of those groups have in common with simplistically delusional freshwater neoclassicals.)</p>
<p>And I would also add: people <em>aren’t </em>simple. Ever. Especially when there’s more than one of them. (Can you name a single family that you know well that doesn’t have all sorts of odd and complicated stuff going on?) So this portrays conservatives wishing for things that don’t exist — like, for instance, prosperous, modern, high-productivity countries that don’t have massive doses of redistribution.</p>
<p>I’ll leave you with that. But I can’t resist sharing another beauty from the same post:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Okay, if you want to know…</strong></p>
<p>Will my date have sex on the first date?</p>
<p><strong>Ask…</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Do you like the taste of beer?</p>
<p><strong>Because…</strong></p>
<p>Among all our casual topics, whether someone likes the taste of beer is the single best predictor of if he or she has sex on the first date.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This caused me some difficulty recently. I was out with a friend and his girlfriend. She took a big swallow from her glass, put it down firmly, and announced, “Damn I <em>love</em> the taste of beer.” I almost spewed mine across the room.</p>
<p>Finally, for those who’ve read this far: if you’re thinking that the title of this post is ironic…you’re right.</p>
<p>* Ah. He sold his shop to Match.com just over a year go — for $50 mil. Just six days ago a “rumored seven-figure” deal <a href="http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/international/london-book-fair/article/51546-london-book-fair-2012-crown-nabs-book-by-okcupid-co-founder-in-rumored-7-fig-deal.html">was announced</a> for the book on big data that he’s writing/has written, titled <em>Dataclysm. </em>I’ll be buying it.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/post/poll-most-believe-the-rich-arent-taxed-enough-but-their-ranks-are-shrinking/2012/04/20/gIQASZpbVT_blog.html">Suzy Khimm</a>, Kevin Drum and <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/post/happy-hour-roundup/2012/04/20/gIQA7BKUWT_blog.html">Greg Sargent</a> comment on the series of gallup polls dating back to 1992 in which a solid majority of US adults, ranging from 55% to 77%, say that they think the rich pay less than their fair share of taxes.  Please click <a href="http://motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2012/04/fighting-back-against-republican-message-machine">the link to Drum</a> then come back. I don&#8217;t want to excerpt.   Oddly the fact stressed by Drum (and the only fact noted by Sargent) is the modest decline in this fraction from 77% to 62%since 1992 not the fact that a major party is totally dedicated to reducing taxes which a solid majority think are too low already.  Khim is just describing the data.  Drum has a long history of warning liberals not to trust the polls which seem to show our countrypeople are liberal (search for &#8220;polling literalism&#8221;) and a long record of not knowing about, then downplaying the exact polls under discussion.</p>
<p>The change from 1992 to the present came in two or three phases.  The third possible phase (stressed by Drum) was an increase from 55% in 2010 to 62% in 2012.  I&#8217;m not convinced that anything really changed.  I think the 2010 sample just happened to be unusual, since other polls from around then show support of 60% or more for higher taxes on the rich.  I won&#8217;t discuss this further.  If we ignore the 2010 poll, we see a decline from 68% in 1994 to 62% in 2012.  The null that this decline is entirely due to sampling error is rejected at the 5% level,  the standard deviation of the difference due to sampling error is on the order of [root(2*(1/3)*(2/3)/1000)]100% or about 2.5%.  But a change (or difference) of 8% is not usually considered worthy of much discussion.   There was also a statistically significant change from 77% in 1992 to 68% in 1994.  In this case, I do not suspect the 1992 sample as the extreme number is confirmed by something Brad DeLong said in 1994 about internal Clinton Gore 1992 polling.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>I have three problems with Drum&#8217;s analysis.  First he keeps arguing that US public support for more progressive taxes is low or not high enough or not as high as it was.  This is of limited interest to readers.  Projecting, I think he is being stubborn.  Also, he seems to equate &#8220;not high enough to get the job done&#8221; with &#8220;not high&#8221; ignoring the huge gap between public and elite opinion on the issue (and the gap between public opinion and elite opinion about public opinion).  Among the elite, it is widely agreed that lower tax rates are better and rates much higher than Clinton era rates are unimaginable.    The fact which makes me lose my temper (which I am trying to keep now) is that the elite ascribes this view to the general public, asserting without evidence that Americans oppose taxation much more progressive than current taxation considering it class warfare.</p>
<p>Another more useful complaint is to note the tendency to look at trends and ignore levels.  62% support for something is lower, but it is not low.  This temptation is understandable as trends are easy to see without defining units.  But it isn&#8217;t optimal.</p>
<p>Finally, there is a tendency to assume that things were normal back at the beginning of the time series.  OK this is the second complaint re warmed, but in 1992 US public opinion about whether the rich were paying their fair share was not ordinary at all.  That level is not discussed by any of the three bloggers.  The discussion of the difference between the current level and that level is discussed only in terms of factors which increase the current level.  This is an aspect of the general tendency to tread trends as if they were levels, but 1992 opinion on the question was extraordinary.</p>
<p>Again I trust my memory of what Brad DeLong told me 18 years about about internal polls which were 2 years old at that time.  He claimed that Clinton&#8217;s pollster got so tired of solid majorities answering yes when asked if rich peoples&#8217; taxes should be raised in order to reduce the deficit, spend more on education, spend more on this that or the other thing that, finally, he asked if people thought rich peoples&#8217; taxes should be raised to finance more waste fraud and abuse – and a plurality answered yes.</p>
<p>Also I absolutely trust my memory of the discussion of focus group reaction to a debate between Bush and Clinton.  They had Bush supporters, Clinton supporters and undecided voters watching with those dial things which allow people to indicate agreement or disagreement.  When Clinton said something to the effect that &#8220;only the rich have gotten tax cuts&#8221; self identified Bush supporters (on average) dialed in agreement.  The TV commentators noted that this was very rare.  I&#8217;ve never heard of such a thing.</p>
<p>In 1992, a solid majority US public was very angry that the rich weren&#8217;t  paying what that majority considered considered to be a fair share of taxes.   A known Philanderer from Arkansas was elected President replacing the man who lead the US and more allies than the US had ever had before to victory.  That burning desire for some class war was very nice, but we can perfectly well make do with rather less.</p>
<p>I think the key thing is to deliver on the promise of tax cuts for the non rich as Obama did and Clinton didn&#8217;t.  Of course, the vast majority don&#8217;t know that Obama kept his promise, but anger over his failure to keep the promise is much diminished by the fact that he kept it.  Commentators couldn&#8217;t stop talking about how Clinton hadn&#8217;t kept his word.  They don&#8217;t want to display ignorance by claiming that Obama didn&#8217;t, so they avoid the topic.  This could be enough.</p>

<p>What is the Question?  Responding to Paul Krugman</p>
<p>Paul Krugman has been kind enough to respond to <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/04/paul-krugman-is-very-very-wrong.html">my post</a> which in turn was commenting on <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/20/plutocrats-and-printing-presses/">an earlier post he had written</a>.</p>
<p>As I noted in my previous post, I&#8217;m very leery about writing this, given Prof. Krugman is usually a very perceptive individual and I&#8217;ve noticed that Prof. Krugman is usually right when he is in a disagreement with someone.  My trepidation is increased quite a bit by the fact that we&#8217;re treading on ground that is so much closer to his area of expertise than the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Presimetrics-Presidents-Measure-Issues-ebook/dp/B0041IXRWA/ref=tmm_kin_title_0?ie=UTF8&#038;m=AG56TWVU5XWC2">two</a> <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/10/laffer-curve-and-kimel-curve.html">topics</a> I normally write about.   That said, I still believe he is wrong, and I will try to make my point a bit more explicit.</p>
<p>Prof. Krugman&#8217;s response comes in four paragraphs.  The first is merely an introduction. In the second paragraph, Prof. Krugman states:     </p>
<blockquote><p>Ordinary monetary policy involves cutting short-term rates to fight a slump; it’s not what we’re talking about here, since it’s hard up against the zero lower bound.  <bold>But the large-scale conventional expansion the Fed engaged in by getting to the zero bound has, of course, widened the spread between short and long term rates</bold>, since markets expect short rates to rise above zero eventually. So looking at the raw data on the short-long spread tells you nothing.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now note this from Krugman’s earlier piece (bolding also mine):      </p>
<blockquote><p>Furthermore, Fed efforts to do this probably tend on average to hurt, not help, bankers. Banks are largely in the business of borrowing short and lending long; anything that compresses the spread between short rates and long rates is likely to be bad for their profits. <bold>And the things the Fed is trying to do are in fact largely about compressing that spread</bold>, either by persuading investors that it will keep short rates at zero for a longer time or by going out and buying long-term assets. These are actions you would expect to make bankers angry, not happy — and that’s what has actually happened.</p></blockquote>
<p>Notice…  in Prof Krugman’s second post, the spread widened.  In his first, post, the one to which I objected (and in response to which I showed a graph of the spread), the spread compressed.  As I understand it, on that issue to which I objected, we are now on the same page – we both agree the spread widened.  But then what Krugman wrote in his first post about banks being made worse off is not correct, all else being equal.      </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>What I don’t understand in Prof. Krugman’s second post is the last sentence of the paragraph shown above – why does looking at the short long spread tell us nothing?  I could be wrong, but I am assuming Prof. Krugman is stating that it wasn’t the Fed’s intent to widen the spread.  the widening of the spread was not the intent of the Fed.  That may well be correct – Prof. Krugman knows the key players personally and I do not, so he enjoys both greater access to and greater insights into the behavior of the people involved.</p>
<p>In his next paragraph, Prof. Krugman writes:     </p>
<blockquote><p>QE is an attempt to get traction despite those zero short-term rates by buying long-term debt, hopefully narrowing the spread and thereby boosting the economy. I don’t think it’s had a large effect, but that’s the goal.</p></blockquote>
<p>Again, I don&#8217;t dispute what Krugman believes the Fed was trying to do with QE.  I also don’t dispute his opinion that it didn’t have much of an effect.  Personally, I suspect the positive effect on the economy of QE was very close to zero and I wrote about my expectation that the effect would be very close to zero at the time.</p>
<p>As I recall, Prof. Krugman was also stating the same thing in real time, albeit more rigorously.  In fact, I would say Prof. Krugman made the point better than anyone of whom I was aware.  He also was, to my knowledge, the first person with a big platform to make the point that the “bond vigilantes” were wrong as QE would not result in inflation.  All of which is to say, not only am I in agreement with him on this issue, I have been one of the small voices supporting him on the issue since 2008.</p>
<p>So let us move on to my other objection to Prof. Krugman’s post (the first being the non-existent compression of short and long term interest rates, and how that was negatively impacting banks).  My problem, and the one that I share with many others, is with this statement from Prof. Krugman&#8217;s earlier post:<br />      <br />
<blockquote>The naive (or deliberately misleading) version of Fed policy is the claim that Ben Bernanke is “giving money” to the banks. What it actually does, of course, is buy stuff, usually short-term government debt but nowadays sometimes other stuff. It’s not a gift. </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>To claim that it’s effectively a gift you have to claim that the prices the Fed is paying are artificially high, or equivalently that interest rates are being pushed artificially low. And you do in fact see assertions to that effect all the time. But if you think about it for even a minute, that claim is truly bizarre.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now let me be 100% clear.  I do claim it’s a gift.  And did so without mentioning interest rates at all (except in the context of checking whether interest rates compressed or not).   Regular readers know I virtually never mention interest rates as I don&#8217;t think they are particularly important when it comes to the outcomes of monetary policy.  (What is important?  Well, it is called <ital><i>monetary policy</i></ital> and not <ital><i>interest rate policy</i></ital> for a reason.)</p>
<p>My claim that the Fed gave a gift to a certain very specific subset of banks and similar entities is based on the following:</p>
<p>1.  the housing market was tanking, driving down home prices and driving up foreclosures</p>
<p>2.  the expectation was that the situation in the housing market was becoming worse and foreclosures were going up with no end in sight</p>
<p>3.  the perceptions described 1. and 2. was that derivatives based on mortgages would continue losing value and nobody knew where the process would end</p>
<p>4.  as a result of 1., 2., and 3., nobody wanted derivatives based on mortgages… those who had such derivatives on their books wanted them gone, and nobody else would buy them at any price</p>
<p>Whether the perception of the risk associated with holding those assets was correct or not, it was what everyone believed.  The Fed stepped in and paid a price that only made sense in a world where there were no such perceptions of risk.  And it wasn’t willing to help everyone that had been blindsided by these perceptions of risk, but rather just one group that had made some very poor decisions.</p>
<p>Put another way &#8211; the Fed was willing to relieve some (but not all entities) of assets they didn&#8217;t want at a price much higher than those entities could have received from anyone else.  That is a gift.</p>
<p>Prof Krugman closes his new piece with this:     </p>
<blockquote><p>And as for the other thing: Kimel apparently thinks the Fed is buying privately issued MBS, aka toxic waste; actually it’s only buying agency debt, which already has an implicit federal guarantee and is functionally not much different from long-term Treasuries.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is sort of correct, but not in a helpful way.  First, a quibble &#8211; leaving aside <a href="http://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/ambs/ambs_faq.html">principal reinvestment</a> the Fed no longer is buying agency debt.  Now, some substance – yes, the agency debt had an implicit federal guarantee.  But&#8230; let us be very precise about our definition.</p>
<p>Agency debt means debt issued by a US gov&#8217;t sponsored agency.  A US government sponsored agency is an agency created by the Federal government to engage in particular commercial activities.  Fannie Mae, for example, was created by the Federal government to securitize mortgages and thus help increase the size and scope of the secondary mortgage market, which in turn would make mortgages easier for most people to get.</p>
<p>But Fannie Mae became a publicly traded corporation in 1968.  It was no longer owned by the Federal government, and it started acting in the best interest of its shareholders.  The Federal government no longer backed the debt Fannie Mae issued, but it was in Fannie Mae&#8217;s interest to imply that its debt and its operations were, in fact, guaranteed by the Federal government as that allowed it to borrow for less.  If that sounds like the same reason why some charlatan goes around pretending be an heir to the Rockefeller fortune, well, it is, and it puts precisely the same obligation on the Rockefeller family as Fannie Mae put on the Federal government.</p>
<p>So, Fannie Mae&#8217;s &#8220;implicit guarantee&#8221; only began to have any real world value at the point where the Federal government took the company over and that really did happen before the Fed started picking up MBS.   But if the Treasury was willing to guarantee MBS debt, why had the market for the debt dried up?</p>
<p>The answer has to do with the size of the Treasury’s guarantee.  Remember, the size of the MBS problem was, at the time un-knowable, Hank Paulson&#8217;s bazooka had $700 billion in it, was rapidly being seen as inadequate to the task, and there was a big fight over increasing the debt ceiling going on.  There was no certainty over whether Congress was going to pony up money to keep the Federal government going, much less pay off some recently acquired private obligations run up by a group of companies suddenly being given the gimlet eye.</p>
<p>Even if you forget about the existence of that uncertainty, the mere fact that the Fed had to step in should remind you that uncertainty was there and was big.  If the markets believed the Federal government was providing a full and credible guarantee, the markets for the MBSs would have unfrozen.  There has been a lot of money sloshing around earning zero in the last few years – why wouldn’t investors on the sidelines take a positive return guaranteed by the Federal government…  unless they didn’t believe the guarantee.</p>
<p>All of which is to say, the gift came not just from the Fed.  The Federal government, in the form of the Treasury department, took the first crack, but what was sitting in that particular corner of the financial kitty litter box was too big for the Treasury’s scoop alone.  That just goes to show how big of a gift public entities gave to a small group of miscreants.</p>
<p>In closing, I&#8217;d like to address a final point&#8230; something from Paul Krugman&#8217;s post that I originally responded to, namely (and I&#8217;m paraphrasing) how are these policies are supposed to hurt the rest of us?</p>
<p>The answer is simple&#8230;  moral hazard.  Most of us were pretty sure that when push came to shove, certain entities would be saved from their folly.  Now, any doubts are gone.  We know with absolute certainty that it’s true.  We have seen the lengths to which our government has gone to save these favored few.  Those entities, going forward, have the magic guarantee.  So not only has competing against them gotten more costly, it has gotten more costly simply not to be them.  Because those entities know they can take bigger risks with no penalty, so they will.</p>
<p>There were other, better ways to proceed.  None of them are perfect, but I&#8217;ll mention three better options that I wrote about back in 2008.</p>
<p>One would be for the Treasury and the Fed to guarantee that during the crisis, a) any financial entities that couldn&#8217;t meet their obligations would be taken over the moment they failed to make a payment and b) the moment a financial entity was taken over by the Treasury + Fed, those two would guarantee that entity&#8217;s debts.  There would still be moral hazard but it wouldn&#8217;t be nearly as bad.  We wouldn&#8217;t be treated to quite the same spectacle of companies on taxpayer life-support giving themselves huge bonuses while mocking the hoi polloi with drivel about the importance of their place in society.  More importantly, we the people would be getting a lot more bang for our collective buck.</p>
<p>Another option would be to allow the public to bank with the Federal Reserve.  Things have changed in the past 100 years, after all. Financial intermediaries aren’t all that necessary these days, except to the intermediaries themselves.  Besides, the Fed can misread someone&#8217;s FICO scores just as easily as Bank of America can, and Ben B is paid orders of magnitude less than his counterpart at B of A.  If people could bank directly with the Fed, there wouldn&#8217;t be a need to save a bunch of entities whose bad decisions periodically &#8220;require&#8221; some sort of bail-out.</p>
<p>A third option (one I noted at the time was ludicrous, but was less ludicrous than what would eventually transpire) would be for the Fed &#038; Treasury to have simply recognized at the time that a process that relied on banks loaning money to the public to get the economy hopping had no hope of working because there wasn&#8217;t a mechanism to get banks to loan money to the public.  The Fed could simply have handed each American a menu and said:  &#8220;pick $X worth of stuff from this menu.&#8221;</p>
<p>This gets back to my statement that from where I&#8217;m standing, interest rates aren&#8217;t something on which monetary policy should focus.  Money, and where that money goes, should be the focus.  To quote <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/22/what-we-talk-about-when-we-talk-about-qe/?comments#permid=5">a comment</a> left by a reader called Mark at Professor Krugman&#8217;s blog the other day:     </p>
<blockquote><p>If the Fed printed one trillion in cash and gave each American $3000, I have a pretty good understand what the result would be. But purchasing one trillion in long term treasuries seems to just make an already large pile of unused, uncirculated money even larger.

<div>This link  SHOULD get you to the CURRENT summary. Which means 2011 until it means 2012. When it does.</div>
<div><a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TRSUM/index.html">Social Security and Medicare Summary Report</a> BTW from all evidence 99% of all Social Security reports found in the lamestream media (because on this one the Snow Queen is right) are cribbed from the Summary which also is much the same as the introduction to the full Report. But the real juice is in the Tables and Figures which among other things show alternate projections besides the standard &#8216;Intermediate Cost alternative&#8217; always cited.

                                <p>The first link is to the 2011 Report and is meant as a teaching tool. The Table shows projected income, cost, and balance projections over what the Trustees consider the &#8216;short term&#8217;, which is the same ten years used by OMB and CBO in their scoring. <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/2011/IV_A_SRest.html#317992">Table IV.A3.—Operations of the Combined OASI and DI Trust Funds, Calendar Years 2006-20 </a><br />Traditionally income came in three primary forms: contributions from payroll (FICA), tax on benefits, and interest on Trust Fund principal. In 2011 the loss of income due to the payroll tax holiday was projected to be replaced by General Fund transfers so adding a fourth (offsetting) category. Cost also comes in three forms with benefits constituting more than 99% (including Railroad Retirement Board interchange) and admin just under 1%. In any year when total income including accrued interest exceeds total cost the Table shows a surplus &#8216;Net increase during year&#8217; and a corresponding addition to the Trust Fund balance &#8216;Amount at end of year&#8217;. And taken ON ITS OWN TERMS, combined OASDI shows continuing surpluses through the ten year window to a total of something over $900 billion in surpluses. Which BTW score as such on the top line number CBO and subsequently the press report as THE Budget Surplus/Deficit. Okay then where is the crisis? What part of &#8216;near a trillion dollar surplus&#8217; don&#8217;t we understand? Well there are a couple of answers to that, which to start with will require some longer range outlook. New table below the fold. <br /><a name="more"></a><a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/2011/VI_F3_OASDHI_dollars.html#201773">Table VI.F8.—Operations of the Combined OASI and DI Trust Funds,  in Current Dollars, Calendar Years 2011-85</a> This table shows longer term projections under the three different economic and demographic models used by the Trustees of which &#8216;Intermediate Cost&#8217; is the standard one. Here we can see that under IC projections surpluses vanish soon after the ten year window of Table IV.A3 and that year end balances start shrinking ultimately to vanish in 2036. Now the end of surpluses and even depletion of Trust Fund balances doesn&#8217;t mean that there simply are no funds to pay any benefits, even in 2035 &#8216;Income excluding interest&#8217; STILL will exceed $2.2 trillion a year. On the other hand projected Cost under the scheduled benefit would be a little over $2.8 trillion, leaving a 22% or so gap. And since under current law Social Security has no ability to borrow would require an abrupt drop in benefits to 78% of the schedule.  So THAT is the agreed definition of &#8216;crisis&#8217;: &#8216;sudden immediate drop in benefits by 22% at the point of Trust Fund Depletion&#8217;. But that is also the point where agreement stops as a divide arises between what I will call Social Security &#8216;supporters&#8217;, &#8216;reformers&#8217; and &#8216;Rosserites&#8217; (a term I just invented). For &#8216;supporters&#8217;, that is for advocates of traditional Social Security crisis focuses on &#8216;drop&#8217;. As a result their range of policy responses mostly revolve around ways to avoid the cut altogether, which given a system where non-benefit costs (i.e. admin) represent 1% of total costs, requires boosts on the income side. Hence approaches ranging from &#8216;lift the cap&#8217; to Dale Coberly&#8217;s &#8216;good grief, it is just 40 cents a week to start if you gradually boost FICA&#8217;. On the other hand while some &#8216;reformers&#8217; pay at least lip service to &#8216;drop&#8217; their real concern is the &#8216;sudden immediate&#8217; part and what they anticipate will be the political reaction: which in their imagination means millions of screaming &#8216;Greedy Geezer&#8217; Boomers descending on Capitol Hill demanding that all scheduled benefits be paid in full no matter what. So their range of policy responses fall into two basic approaches plus a blend. One approach is to appeal to the Magical Fairy Dust of Equity Markets and claim that private accounts will simply make up the difference. Another approach is just to avoid the &#8216;sudden&#8217; part by simply phasing in the cut by such things as means testing, retirement age adjustments, changes in CPI whatever that end up with the same 22% (or more) cut but with less drama. And the more cynical ones combine both approaches by pretending (or believing) that Magical Fairy Dust will just offset those gradual cuts and everyone (but especially account managers of private accounts) will live happily ever after.  But either way this leaves &#8216;supporters&#8217; and &#8216;reformers&#8217; talking past each other with the former focused on avoiding cuts altogether while the latter concentrate on making them imperceptible. But which makes them just not hear solutions that would actually cost them anything, because &#8216;cuts&#8217; as such are not where they see the problem to start with.  Now somewhere between &#8216;supporters&#8217; and &#8216;reformers&#8217; are the distinct minority of &#8216;Rosserites&#8217;. And by &#8216;distinct minority&#8217; I mean Professor Barkley J Rosser and your (not-so) humble blogger. (Although such luminaries as Prof K and Dean Baker at least acknowledge that we exist and have a point). Now Rosserites are opposed by the non-Rosserites (which mostly means AB commenter Dale Coberly, we could have a joint meeting of both sides in a phone booth-if such existed anymore)who I think misjudge us. That is where Rosserites are making an observation, and drawing a theoretical conclusion, we are not in fact ADVOCATING that outcome, just pointing out that the 22% cut at Trust Fund Exhaustion is not in full context a &#8216;crisis&#8217; at all. And that understanding this allows us to modulate our responses to what all agree is a problem, whether that be defined as &#8216;cut&#8217; or &#8216;sudden&#8217;.  Rosserites, or at least this Rosserite, point to the following 2002 Congressional Budget Office Report: <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/publication/14580">The Future Growth of Social Security: It&#8217;s Not Just Society&#8217;s Aging</a> and particularly to Figure 2 on page 2. Now in what may be the least known aspect of Social Security it turns out that the scheduled benefit under current law actually results in increased REAL benefits over time. That is measured in terms of actual purchaseable basket of goods the average benefit was projected to rise from $14,000 in 2002 dollars to $26,000 in 2002 dollars between 2002 and the end of the 75 year projection period. Or close to a 85% REAL INCREASE for the retiree of 2077 as opposed to what my Mom got in 2002. Which Rosserites take as an argument to put the 22% cut in 2036 in the context of this upward sloping baseline. That is per CBO benefits at the point of Trust Fund Depletion (using 2002) projections were scheduled to be about 140-150% of then current benefits and a 25% cut to THAT still rendered what I cheekily call &#8216;Rosser&#8217;s Equation&#8217; (Barkley can&#8217;t decide whether to be &#8216;bemused&#8217; or &#8216;amused&#8217; by this), that is 75% of 150% = 115%. Meaning that the real world consequence of that &#8216;sudden&#8217; &#8216;cut&#8217; would still be a check 15% better than my Mom gets today. In real basket of goods terms. Which doesn&#8217;t mean we shouldn&#8217;t take steps to avoid or at least mitigate that cut, just to point out that it is hard to parse &#8216;15% better real benefit&#8217; into &#8216;Boomer Geezers giving Gen-X a bone job&#8217;. Or in less crude terms &#8216;what the heck kind of &#8216;intergenerational warfare&#8217; are we talking here?&#8217;  Well it is getting close to Report release time and I want to leave time for people to do some fact checking and link following. All I ask is that people keep the reality of the current baseline of the scheduled benefit in mind when assessing &#8216;crisis&#8217; if and when the Trust Fund actually goes to zero balances.</p>
