                                <p>The <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,11069-2205982,00.html#cid=OTC-RSS&#038;attr=World">UK Times</a> coverage of Haditha has this retraction:</p>
<blockquote><p>This story originally appeared with a picture whose caption erroneously described the scene as of the alleged incidents in al-Haditha. The image was in fact from a separate incident involving Iraqi insurgents</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://michellemalkin.com/archives/005321.htm">Michelle Malkin</a> alerted her readers of this error and wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you are left with the impression that the dead bodies on the ground were massacred by our Marines, that is exactly what the Times intends &#8230; This must not stand. And the Times must not be allowed to make a covert correction without a public acknowledgement. The editors must apologize for this blatant smear.</p></blockquote>
<p>Gerard Baker combines apology with a smack down of Malkin:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m sorry you have jumped to the conclusion that this was a deliberate misrepresentation and the result of slanted journalism and sorrier that you have shared that view with your readers without any attempt to verify it &#8230; I&#8217;m personally offended both by the error on the Times website and by your association of me with what you call the intentional slander of US marines.</p></blockquote>
<p>Malkin continues with her spin that the press is just making Haditha up including a link to <a href="http://www.proteinwisdom.com/index.php?/weblog/entry/battle_for_the_narrative_of_haditha">Jeff Goldstein</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Whether the historical referent becomes My Lai or Jenin (or something in between) will depend upon the outcome of the investigation, of course; but, if the early analogies are any indication, one does get the creepy sense that many in the US media are kind of hoping for the former … Or maybe they just have a lot of unused file footage of My Lai lying around and don’t want to see it go to waste.</p></blockquote>
<p>Jeff and Michelle are hoping we are stupid enough to believe that the press just made the whole Haditha massacre up.  Pathetic!</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p><a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=YTBjMGQ0MzQxOTI1Yzk5ZjE1ODhmNzU3OWIzOTc4MjE=">Byron York</a> found <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/imagepages/2006/06/03/business/20060603_CHARTS_GRAPHIC.html">this comparison</a> enlightening.  Of course, real GDP and employment growth under Snow’s tenure was as strong as it was under Rubin’s tenure.  Under Rubin’s tenure, the employment to population rose from 63% to 64.3%.  But then it dropped for the first 2.5 years of the Bush Administration and has now crawled back to 63%.  In terms of levels – rather than rates of change – Snow’s best period equals where Rubin’s worst.  </p>
<p>But let’s talk about the Federal debt/GDP ratio, which was 57.4% and declining when the Clinton Administration turned over the reigns to the Bush Administration.  When Rubin assumed the post of Treasury Secretary, it was 66.7% and is projected to reach that level again as a result of the fiscal fiasco that Snow bragged about.</p>
<p>Maybe Mr. York did not notice but Jimmy Carter’s first Treasury Secretary – Michael Blumental – presided over a period when growth averaged 4.8%.  Not listed was Henry Fowler who served as LBJ’s Treasury Secretary from 1965 to 1968 when real GDP growth averaged 5%.  And yet, York’s NRO colleagues think of Carter and LBJ as “economic morons”.</p>

<p>When <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/06/employment-update.html">Kash</a> delivered the disappointing news about how little employment growth we saw last month  &#8211; not to mention the weak increase in nominal hourly wages and the fall in the average workweek – I jokingly commented that the White House talking points would be about the 4.6% unemployment rate and the increase in the household survey figure.  And sure enough &#8211; <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=MWI1M2NhZWFjZDY4NjQyNGU3Y2YyNDczMDY4MDZhZDA=">Lawrence Kudlow</a> comes through:<br />
<blockquote>You can’t win with the economic pessimists. The cult of the bear still reigns supreme in most corners of Wall Street and the mainstream media, as those who want to tear down the economy continue to manufacture justifications for their declinist American views. If jobs reports come in above expectations, the naysayers predict inflation. When they come in below, the pessimists predict recession.  So it was with Friday’s 75,000 increase in non-farm payrolls for May. That number was greeted derisively, despite the fact that over the past 33 consecutive months, 5.3 million new jobs have been created. Through the year ending in May, 1.9 million new jobs have been created with the unemployment rate moving down to 4.6 percent &#8211; the lowest rate in nearly five years and below the average of the last forty-five years. But wait &#8211; there’s even more good news being clouded out by the pessimist frowns: The Labor Department’s household survey, which focuses on self-employed owner-operators of new entrepreneurial businesses, showed a booming May jobs increase of 288,000.</p></blockquote>
<p>Kudlow is still trying to tell us that this household survey figure is a more reliable indicator of the labor market than the payroll survey figure.  I’ll leave to others to remind Kudlow of all the problems with his spin on this one and simply remind everyone as to the time path of the employment to population ratio from 1998 to today – given the fact he remains unaware that part of the reason why the unemployment ratio is back down to 4.6% has to do with a decline the labor force participation rate. </p>
<p>The official version of the White House talking points can be found <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2006/06/20060602-1.html">here</a>: <br />
<blockquote>Today, The Government Released New Jobs Figures – 75,000 Jobs Created In May. The economy has created about 1.9 million jobs over the past 12 months &#8211; and more than 5.3 million since August 2003. The unemployment rate fell to 4.6 percent &#8211;  lower than the average of the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yep – you don’t need good news when you have the ability to simply spin anything.</p>
<p><em><strong>Update</strong></em>: I’m trying to figure out what Kudlow means by “The Labor Department’s household survey, which focuses on self-employed owner-operators of new entrepreneurial businesses”, which he seems to be saying represents the difference between the 288,000 increase in the household survey versus the 75,000 increase in the payroll survey – as if self employment rose by 213,000.  <a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t05.htm">Table A-5</a> indicates an increase of only 40,000 as far as self-employed workers in the non-agricultural sector and a 47,000 decrease as far as self-employed workers in the agricultural sector.  It would seem to me that the BLS measure of self-employed workers fell by 7000 last month.  What am I missing here? Is there some other category or has Kudlow just made another bogus claim?  After all, there can be other reasons why these two surveys show differences in the reported increase in employment beyond the change in self-employed workers.  I would hope Kudlow would have figured that out by now.</p>
<p>Update II: AB reader <a href="http://www.blah3.com/article.php?story=20060602185242920">Invictus</a> provides this from David Rosenberg:</p>
<blockquote><p>To be sure, the Pollyannas will point to the fact that the Household Survey showed a far different headline than the nonfarm report did – +288k for the former as opposed to +75k for the latter. But don&#8217;t be fooled – that Household Survey also flagged softness beneath the veneer because all the gains were in part-time; full-time jobs actually plunged by 292k in May, which was the steepest decline since Feb/05.</p></blockquote>
<p>Full-time jobs did fall by 292,000 according to the seasonally adjusted figures while part-time jobs rose by 486,000 so that the latter rose from 17% to 17.3% of total reported employment per the household survey.  To be fair – the percent of employment from part-time jobs was 17.2% as of December 2000.  To add to the confusion that the Pollyannas spinmeisters might used &#8211; Kudlow might consider reporting the unadjusted figures where reported employment rose by 636,000 including a 334,000 increase in full-time jobs.</p>

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>This morning the BLS released its estimate of <a href="http://stats.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm">employment in May</a>.  The headline figure indicates that 75,000 new jobs were created in May, which is well below the expectations of closer to 175,000.  Those who were employed actually worked fewer hours in May, and nominal earnings were stagnant after rising at a reasonable pace for the past several months (this means that real earnings fell, of course).  All in all, this is a pretty lousy jobs report.</p>
<p>Does this provide evidence of a slowing economy?  We&#8217;ll need a few more months of weak job readings to tell for sure, but it&#8217;s definitely starting to look like a real possibility.  Take a look at the picture below, which shows the three-month average of net job growth in the private sector.  Clearly the trend over the past few months is not a good one.</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/MyChart.jpg"></p>
<p>Manufacturing employment fell in May, and even hiring in the construction sector slowed substantially; over the last 3 month period only 18,000 new construction jobs were created, compared to 3-month totals that have typically been between 50 and 100 thousand since early 2003.  Chalk one up to the slowing housing market.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/31/AR2006053102043.html">Robert Nelson</a> argues that the AMT is like a flat tax and then argues this makes the AMT a good thing.  Since I’m late to this party, let me simply summarize a few good reactions starting with <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2006_05/008923.php">Kevin Drum</a>: <br />
<blockquote>As Nelson surely knows, there&#8217;s wide agreement among economists that a broadly-based tax that minimizes exemptions and loopholes would be economically efficient. However, there is no agreement at all that having a flat rate is a good thing. It&#8217;s wildly dishonest to say otherwise.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2006/06/flat_rate_rerun.html">Mark Thoma</a> notes that we Democrats might support getting rid of the subsidies that favor the rich and that any efficiency gains from a flat tax are being grossly exaggerated by Mr. Nelson.  </p>
<p>So all I might have hoped to add was to comment on Nelson’s spin about Social Security, but then <a href="http://beatthepress.blogspot.com/2006/06/libeling-social-security.html">DeanSpeaks</a> so we listen:<br />
<blockquote>One of the disadvantages of having a public Social Security system is that people are free to make all sorts of untrue statements about it without facing any consequences. For example, an oped in the Washington Post this morning described the Social Security trust fund as “largely an accounting fiction.” This statement is of course absurd. The trust fund consists of U.S. government bonds, which the government is obligated to repay under the law. There is no sense whatsoever in which it can accurately be described as fictional.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m reduced to go after the obvious – NRO’s <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=YjYyMzdiMjZlMjg3Mjc1OTNjMmE5NzRmMjI0Y2E1Mzc=">Jerry Bowyer</a> who does not know the difference between income flows and wealth creation (ah, Jerry – savings is the portion of income we don’t consume) and confounds nominal with real changes.  He also makes odd statements such as:<br />
<blockquote>Even when adjusted downward somewhat for inflation, this aggregate jump in GDP is extremely large. The only larger spikes in modern time came during the bubble years at the end of the Clinton administration and the 2002-05 time period.</p></blockquote>
<p>I guess he is referring to the 5.3% annualized growth rate for the first quarter of 2006, which was less than the 6.2% growth rate for 1997QII, the 6.7% growth rate for 1996QII, the 5.5% growth rate for 1993QIV, and the 5.4% growth rate for 1988QIV, etc.  But OK, Ronald Reagan’s term as President must have been during the feudal era.  </p>
<p>But the oddest oped I’ve seen today comes from an attack on Senator Schumer by <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=OTA5OTU1NGZjMDNmODJlOGJkY2I3ZjRiYzJjMzM2N2U=">Phil Kerpen</a>:<br />
<blockquote>For the sake of the American economy, and their own political fortunes, Democrats should disregard Schumer’s fiscal shortsightedness &#8230; According to the most recent data compiled by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the average wage earner in the U.S. in 2005 earned about $27,000 and paid a total effective tax rate, including federal, state, and local taxes, of 30 percent.  Americans are not under-taxed. Yet Democrats like Schumer would do nothing to stop the largest tax hike in American history, which is scheduled to occur over the next five years. They would prefer to hike taxes even sooner &#8230; It’s the American people, not the pro-tax Democrats, who have the facts on their side.</p></blockquote>
<p>The fact that Mr. Kerpen ignores is the elephant in the room – the massive Federal deficit which means Americans are already facing growing deferred tax liabilities.  Democrats like Senator Schumer simply want policymakers to convert deferred taxation into current taxation, that is, to stop the explosion in Federal debt.  We are not proposing to put this tax burden on the average wage earners – but many Republicans would.  The problem is that these Republican politicians and the hacks that support them – such as those who write for the National Review – simply don’t have the integrity to say so.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://www.outsidethebeltway.com/archives/2006/06/amt_as_a_stealth_flat_tax">James Joyner</a> adds to the debate over the AMT as a substitute for a flat tax:<br />
<blockquote>First, no Republican that I know of advocates a flat tax in the 26-28 percent range; most talk about one between 10 to 15 percent. For the federal government to take over a quarter of one’s income off the top, with no deductions, is confiscatory. Second, one can simultaneoulsy [simultaneously] think a policy a good idea and oppose doing it covertly. The AMT’s critics find it outrageous that we set up a system encouraging people to make certain economic decisions–buying a house, making charitable donations, investing in education, an so forth–and then have a backdoor trap wherein those benefits are stripped after the money has been spent &#8230; So, the lure isn’t so much a flat tax but a massive tax hike. And the worst kind, at that: One ena[c]ted by the vagaries of inflation rather than by the direct action of the elected representatives of the people.</p></blockquote>
<p>And yes – I left off Joyner’s feed the beast last sentence.  This Democrat wants to see a tax increase and restraint on Federal spending.</p>

                                <p>The Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (<a href="http://www.ofheo.gov/index.asp">OFHEO</a>) released its quarterly report on house prices in the US.  The national view is summed up thusly:<br />
<blockquote>U.S. home prices were 12.54 percent higher in the first quarter of 2006 than they were one year earlier. Appreciation for the most recent quarter was 2.03 percent, or an annualized rate of 8.12 percent. The quarterly rate is about one percentage point below the rate from the previous quarter and is the lowest rate since the first quarter of 2004. The figures were released today by OFHEO Acting Director James Lockhart, as part of the House Price Index (HPI), a quarterly report analyzing housing price appreciation trends.</p>
<p>“These data show average housing prices still growing stronger than some might have expected,” said Lockhart. “They do indicate, however, that price growth is moderating in some parts of the country, particularly in areas where prices have been rising the most.”</p>
<p>House prices continued to grow considerably faster over the past year than did prices of non-housing goods and services reflected in the Consumer Price Index. House prices rose 12.5 percent, while prices of other goods and services rose only 4.2 percent.</p></blockquote>
<p>Different housing markets in the US are behaving very, very differently, however, so discussion about the national average hides a lot of interesting detail.  In some places house prices started showing signs of unusual increases as far back as 2002, other places didn&#8217;t begin their upward sprint until 2005, and many parts of the US have completely missed out on the Great Appreciation of the 2000s.</p>
<p>The data tends to show that in those cities which saw the most rapid increases in house prices during the period 2003-05 (generally in the Northeast and California), house prices are starting to stabilize.  The following graph shows the annualized rate of growth in house prices from September 2005 through March 2006, as measured by OFHEO&#8217;s House Price Index.</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/hpi_06a.jpg"></p>
<p>Some of the recent decline in the rate of house price appreciation may be due to seasonal factors, but it seems quite clear that there&#8217;s also a gradual slowing of the rate of growth.  Note, however, that with the exception of perhaps Boston and San Diego, even the frothiest cities still registered quite respectable price appreciation during the end of 2005 and beginning of 2006.</p>
<p>One last question that I&#8217;ll throw out for readers familiar with the California real estate markets: does anyone have a good explanation for the recent striking divergence between the San Diego and Los Angeles real estate markets?  Typically those markets move very closely together (which is quite natural since they&#8217;re physically not very far apart), but over the past year the San Diego market has slowed dramatically while the Los Angeles market continues to appreciate at a rapid rate.  Any theories?</p>
<p>All in all, this data confirms what other data have suggested for the past several months: the housing market in many parts of the US is slowing, but only gradually.</p>

                                <p>My <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/05/californias-next-governor.html">comment</a> that either Steve Westley and Phil Angelides would be more fiscally responsible that Governor Girlie Man drew fire from AB reader Muckdog that Angelides would simply spend our “$7 billion surplus”.  Actually, I might just vote in the Republican primary (if they let me) for McClintock who is a bona fide fiscal conservative on the hope that we Californians would have a true choice between two fiscal responsible candidates: the low-tax budget cutting McClintock v. Angelides who wants to at least cover our current level of spending.</p>
<p>As I was searching our <a href="http://www.dof.ca.gov/Budget/BudgetDocuments.asp">Department of Finance State Budget</a> to show Muckdog that even the Governor’s Budget says we are still running deficits, I found some cool data on real personal income for both California and the U.S.  Muckdog thinks California is booming on Arnold’s leadership.  </p>
<p>Here are the facts in terms of real personal income relative to where we were in 2000.  For the nation as a whole, real income in 2003 was about the same as it was in 2000.  For California, however, we had experienced a 2.5% decline, which is not surprising as the recent recession was an investment-led recession, which hit California hard.  The good news is that both the nation and California has enjoyed a recovery from the recession.  Our 2005 real income per capita is now 2.5% higher than it was in 2000, whereas the nation’s real income per capita is now 4.1% higher than it was in 2000.</p>
<p>I know the Bush cheerleaders wish to credit his fiscal policy for the meager growth over the past five years, and I can see Arnold cheerleaders doing the same.  But recessions came and go without tax cuts and the economic growth over the past 5 years is disappointing both for the nation as a whole and for California in particular.</p>

<blockquote>So what do you do when your two gubernatorial aspirants, Steve Westley and Phil Angelides, let their primary battle degenerate into a disgusting, slimy pit of bullshit attack ads and surrogate whisper smear campaigns? I quit. I hate them both.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.samefacts.com/archives/cat_campaign_2006.html">Jonathan Zasloff</a> makes the case for Phil Angelides:<br />
<blockquote>Angelides was the only statewide figure taking him on, and arguing that borrow-and-spend is not the responsible way to run a government. He&#8217;s saying the same thing now, and, yes, that means raising some taxes. But that&#8217;s what it means to be responsible.</p></blockquote>
<p>The initial back and forth between Westley and Angelides involved which taxes the other one would increase.  Of course, Arnold does not want to raise anyone’s taxes preferring to put my state’s government deeper into debt.  It’s a pity when taking real responsibility is seen as a negative.  Fellows – chill for a moment as either one of you would be a vast improvement over the panderer currently acting as if he were my governor.</p>

<p>That’s a 406% nominal increase over a period when prices grew by 180% &#8211; so the real increase in premiums is closer to 80%.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2006_05/008913.php">Kevin Drum</a> debunks this National Review spin by citing the results from <a href="http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/press/releases/press05102006.html">this study</a>:</p>

<p>Mind you, I have praised Deroy Murdock for some of his NRO opeds and I had hoped he would replace Bruce Bartlett as the lone sensible voice on economics.  This attack on the trial lawyers is a real disappointment but then I noticed that <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=NDhmOTJlMDk2ZmUzMGNiMGMzMzFlMzVkOTg4NWVkODU=">Bruce Bartlett</a> has returned with a tribute to Lloyd Bentsen.  </p>
<p>Alas, I was very disappointed that Bruce choose to pay tribe to Lloyd Bentsen by praising the doctrine of supply-siders – especially since Bentsen helped reverse the fiscal insanity of the 1980’s by supporting Bush41’s decision to raise taxes in 1990 as well as pushing for the 1993 tax increase.  But the point of high comedy came here:</p>
<blockquote><p>Probably the high point for the committee came in 1963 when it provided much of the intellectual ammunition for the Kennedy tax cut. At that time, Rep. Wilbur Mills (D., Ark.) was a member of the JEC as well as chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. He relied heavily on JEC economists, especially Norman Ture, to provide him with analysis and research that helped get the tax cut through Congress.</p></blockquote>
<p>The rational for the 1964 tax cut was that we needed a boost to aggregate demand in order to return to full employment.  And let’s not forget that it was Norman Ture who told Wilbur Mills that we did not need to reverse this fiscal stimulus in 1966.  </p>
<p>Bruce also writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>In essence, the JEC’s 1980 report took supply-side economics from the fringe and made it part of the mainstream of economic and political thinking. It made it easier for establishment Republican economists like Alan Greenspan and Herb Stein to support Ronald Reagan’s proposed tax cuts, despite their qualms about the deficit. And it had a lasting impact even among Democrats. Long after Reagan’s victory, liberal congressman Henry Reuss (D., Wisc.), who succeeded Bentsen as JEC chairman, told the New York Times, “We have learned from our mistakes in the past. We’ve given up blind pursuit of Keynesian demand acceleration.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Has Bruce forgotten about the 1982 recession and the chain of events that led up to it?  The Federal Reserve viewed Reagan’s 1981 fiscal stimulus as excessive and renewed its monetary restraint to offset it.  The goal was to do what the Federal Reserve started to do back in 1966 – let tight money reduce investment demand to offset the increase in the sum of consumption and government purchases.  There was a difference, however.  In the late 1960’s, the Federal Reserve did not stick to its guns, while in 1982, the monetary restraint was carried out sort of like the Powell Doctrine – with overwhelming force.  </p>
<p>Supply-siders should learn from their mistakes – and refrain from trying to blame Keynesians for the poor advice that Norman Ture gave to Wilbur Mills.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Via Bush excuse maker extraordinaire <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=NDk2Mjg5ZGE5YWNlMjYyNzVkYjg2MzIzMDk5ODhiMTU=">Andrew McCarthy</a> comes a brief from the <a href="http://www.morgancunningham.net/downloads/article_29.pdf">Washington Legal Foundation</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Any interpretation of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), as applied to the precise facts and circumstances of the NSA Program (which cannot be determined on the present record), that would impair the President’s ability to carry out his constitutional responsibilities, would render FISA itself unconstitutional under the separation-of-powers doctrine. FISA could not, under such circumstances, constitutionally prevent the President from carrying out the NSA Program to collect foreign intelligence to prevent future terrorist attacks on our country.</p></blockquote>
<p>The ACLU is challenging the Administration’s end-run of FISA, while the Washington Legal Foundation wants to defend the Administration.  I don’t pretend to be a legal scholar but this argument (which we had to wade through almost four pages of puffery to get to) strikes me as self-defeating.  The reason goes to something this brief said earlier (OK – not all of the first 3 plus pages constituted puffery as some of appears to be just spin):<br />
<blockquote>Given the obvious and overriding concern about impending future attacks, and the ongoing threats by al Qaeda to strike at America and its citizens again, both here and abroad, the President authorized the National Security Agency (“NSA”) to “intercept international communications into and out of the United States of persons linked to al Qaeda or related terrorist organizations.” DOJ Memo, supra note 2, at 5 (emphasis added). Amicus henceforth will refer to this activity, further described below, as the “NSA Program.” In order to intercept international communications under the NSA Program, the government must have &#8220;a reasonable basis to conclude that one party to the communication is a member of al Qaeda, affiliated with al Qaeda, or a member of an organization affiliated with al Qaeda.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>So if the only thing the NSA wanted to do was to tap international calls that we had probable cause to believe were to or from a member of al Qaeda, the FISA Court would have granted a warrant in a New York minute.  In other words, FISA would not prevent the Administration from carrying out its constitutional responsibilities.  In a word – this brief strikes me as absurd on its face.  But I’m not a Constitutional scholar – so those of you who may be – feel free to comment.</p>
