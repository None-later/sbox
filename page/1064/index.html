                                <p>Via <a href="http://economistsview.blogspot.com/">Mark Thoma</a> comes the latest argument for Bush’s Social Security Deform put forward by the folks at the <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-oe-butler12apr12,0,4538466.story?coll=la-news-comment-opinions">Heritage Foundation</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Yes, because of a bigger crisis that has nothing to do with the program&#8217;s solvency. It&#8217;s a personal crisis affecting millions of American working families: The program designed for the 1930s is shortchanging them and eroding their ability to save &#8230; But the personal crisis in Social Security is even more worrisome &#8211; and it&#8217;s deeply unfair. As the Social Security system itself has aged, payroll taxes have grown relentlessly and the return on those taxes has fallen dramatically &#8230; That is a serious crisis holding back the economic improvement of lower-income neighborhoods. The system needs changing so that more money is saved and stays in these communities.</p></blockquote>
<p>Mark calls this argument misguided.  What the folks at the Heritage Foundation fail to admit is that the Bush plan would leave the 12.4% “contribution” rate in place but gut the benefits.  So in effect, the Heritage Foundation is supporting a plan that would be a backdoor employment tax increase on the people they pretend to care about.</p>

                                <p>That President Bush weaseled out on his promise to <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/04/13/farm.cuts.ap/index.html">cut farm pork</a> does not surprise me in the least.  But it does show that this White House was never serious about giving you your money back or protecting your Social Security benefits.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://plumer.blogspot.com/">Brad Plumer</a> notes that it might indeed be the time to be pro-farm subsidy.</p>
<p><strong>Update 2</strong>: The <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/04/13/socialsecurity.senate.ap/index.html">GOP leadership</a> says it wants to focus on the long-term solvency of the Social Security system.  I wish they’d also work on the long-term solvency of the General Fund.  Cutting taxes and keeping farm pork high is not a good start.</p>

                                <p>Here’s some of the data I promised you <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/04/real-crisis.html">the other day</a>, giving a more detailed look at the performance of the US health care system compared with those of other industrialized countries.</p>
<p>First let’s take a look at the very young.  How well does the US health care system take care of children and mothers, both before and after birth?  The following table gives a few indicators:</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/healthstats1.jpg"><br />Notes: Infant mortality rates from OECD, showing 2001 data; other data from the WHO, showing data for the year 2000.</p>
<p>The US does worst, or tied for worst, in every measure.  The US health care system simply does not do a very good job in caring for the very young.  </p>
<p>So how about the elderly? The following table gives details about the length and quality of life that senior citizens can receive in developed countries around the world. </p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/healthstats2.jpg"><br />Note: Data from year 2001.  Source: WHO.</p>
<p>Not only is the US’s life expectancy at or near the bottom of the industrialized world, but Americans spend more of their shorter lives in poor health (as defined by the WHO).</p>
<p>Now recall the data I showed you the other day describing how much the US spends on health care.  Americans spend nearly twice as much as people in other developed countries spend on health care.  Our closest competitor for health care costs is Switzerland, which still spends just 60% of what the US spends, per capita.  And yet all of these countries acheive better health outcomes: longer lives, fewer dead babies and children, and more quality of life for their elderly.</p>
<p>One last point: some have argued that the US’s poor showing on all of these measures is simply an artifact of demographic or other differences between the US and other developed nations, and not a function of the US’s health care system.  It turns out that this is something that is fairly straightforward to determine using some econometrics.  </p>
<p>One example is given in a 2003 OECD Working Paper titled “<a href="http://www.olis.oecd.org/olis/2003doc.nsf/linkto/eco-wkp(2003)4">The US Health System: An Assessment and Prospective Directions for Reform</a>,” by Elizabeth Docteur, Hannes Suppanz and Jaejoon Woo.  They test the influence that various demographic indicators (e.g. income per capita, fertility, education levels, and income distribution) have on infant mortality and life expectancy statistics in a panel of OECD countries.  Then they use those results to estimate how much of the US’s poor results simply reflect these demographic characteristics, and how much are unexplained.  </p>
<p>They find that such demographic factors do not explain any of the US&#8217;s bad health statistics.  (The US&#8217;s low level of publicly provided health care does explain about one-third of the US&#8217;s low life expectancy, however.)  The conclusion is that there is something idiosyncratic about the US health care system that results in poor outcomes despite its enormous costs.  The average American simply receives unambiguously worse health care while paying twice as much as citizens of the rest of the developed world.</p>

<p>Dustin Stamper published “Panelists Blame Growth in Offshore Tax Evasion on Inadequacy of U.S. Internal Revenue Service” in <em>Tax Analysts </em>on April 11, 2005:</p>
<blockquote><p>Headlining an April 7 briefing on offshore tax evasion sponsored by Sen. Carl Levin, D-Michigan, and Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas, former Senate investigator Jack Blum and director of Citizens for Tax Justice Bob McIntyre spared almost no one from blame for increasingly widespread tax evasion, least of all an &#8220;undernourished&#8221; U.S. Internal Revenue Service. Characterizing offshore evasion as &#8220;a national crisis&#8221; in a time when the country is &#8220;hammered by deficits,&#8221; Blum, now with the Washington law firm Nobel, Novins, and Lamont, said that while he worked as counsel for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he helped the IRS identify 2.2 million credit card transactions from offshore accounts in tax havens. &#8220;The IRS can&#8217;t handle a million tax evasion cases,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We have undernourished the IRS to the point where it&#8217;s a joke.&#8221; According to Blum, hiring freezes and the retirement of many employees with offshore expertise have gutted the agency. Worse, he said, &#8220;we&#8217;ve sent them on fools&#8217; errands,&#8221; like cracking down on tax credits for low-income individuals. &#8220;The mega-rich have basically walked away from the tax system,&#8221; he said. &#8220;One-third of the world&#8217;s wealth nominally is now held by shell companies.&#8221; McIntyre traced most of the IRS&#8217;s problems to low funding and the hearings on IRS abuses in the late 1990s. He also warned that things are unlikely to change anytime soon. &#8220;We have an unfavorable political climate with this Treasury and White House,&#8221; he said. <br />McIntyre accused Bush of selling tax shelters in his first job with the oil industry, and Treasury Secretary John Snow of frequently lobbying for loopholes while in the private sector. According to Blum, the first step to erasing the problem would be for the IRS to stop recognizing sham corporations in tax havens. </p></blockquote>
<p>Bob McIntyre and T.D. Coo Nguyen produced this <a href="http://www.ctj.org/corpfed04an.pdf">Citizens for Tax Justice</a> report on the declining level of Federal corporate profits taxes relative to pretax income. This ratio is less than the overall effective tax rate to the degree that companies pay foreign income taxes as well as to the degree that companies pay state income taxes.  In 1988, this ratio was above 25% but was just under 22% during the 1996-98.  In 2003, this ratio was only 17%.  They also note that Federal corporate income taxes represent less than 1.5% of GDP as compared a 4% of GDP in 1960.  They also discuss a variety of reasons why Federal corporate profits taxes are so low including:</p>
<blockquote><p>Offshore tax sheltering. Over the past decade, corporations and their accounting firms have become increasingly aggressive in seeking ways to shift their profits, on paper, into offshore tax havens, in order to avoid their tax obligations. Some companies have gone so far as to renounce their U.S. “citizenship” and reincorporate in Bermuda or other tax-haven countries to facilitate tax sheltering activity. Not surprisingly, corporations do not explicitly disclose their abusive tax sheltering in their annual reports. For example, Wachovia’s extensive schemes to shelter its U.S. profits from tax are cryptically described in the notes to its annual reports merely as “leasing.” It took extensive digging by PBS’s Frontline researchers to discover that Wachovia’s tax shelter involved pretending to own and lease back municipal assets in Germany, such as sewers and rail tracks, a practice heavily promoted by some accounting firms. Other tax shelter devices, such as abuses of “transfer pricing,” also go unspecified in corporate annual reports. Nevertheless, corporate offshore tax sheltering is estimated to cost the U.S. Treasury anywhere from $30 to $70 billion a year, and presumably the effects of these shelters are reflected in the bottom-line results of our study.</p></blockquote>
<p>Our graph shows that the ratio of corporate taxes relative to corporate profits dropped in the early 1990’s and then increased during the second half of the decade.  This effective tax rate combines the 35% Federal statutory rate and the state tax rate, but depends on a variety of factors including how much income is shifted to low-tax havens abroad and how much income gets sheltered in what is often referred to as Delaware Intangible Holding Companies (DIHC).  The fall in the effective tax rate for corporations is not only due to falling Federal corporate taxes relative to profits but also an erosion of state corporate tax rates – in part because of the use of DIHC structures.  </p>
<p>One of Bill Clinton’s themes during the 1992 campaign was to beef up the enforcement of section 482 of the U.S. tax code, which governs intercompany pricing.  The IRS is currently short on resources to enforce section 482, which is something President Bush wishes to address.  Rather than bash the Administration, let’s support his efforts to convince the House GOP leadership to provide more funding – especially now that <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2004/09/bush-v-delay-on-irs-funding.html">a particular member</a> is in <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2005_04/006063.php">hot water</a>.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/11/opinion/11krugman4.html?hp">Paul Krugman</a> deserves kudos today for trying to turn attention toward the true long-term domestic crisis facing the US today: its horrible health care system.  One of his central points is this:<br />
<blockquote>[T]he U.S. health care system is wildly inefficient. Americans tend to believe that we have the best health care system in the world. (I&#8217;ve encountered members of the journalistic elite who flatly refuse to believe that France ranks much better on most measures of health care quality than the United States.) But it isn&#8217;t true. We spend far more per person on health care than any other country &#8211; 75 percent more than Canada or France &#8211; yet rank near the bottom among industrial countries in indicators from life expectancy to infant mortality.</p></blockquote>
<p>I plan on presenting several different types of data this week about the quality of health care in the US, including different measures of care for the very young and the very old.  The data very consistently shows that the US does not have a very good health care system when measured in terms of the health of its people, or when measured in terms of how its citizens feel about the health care they get&#8230; and it has a <em>horrible</em> health care system when these mediocre outcomes are juxtaposed with its astronomical costs.  For those of you who can&#8217;t wait, here&#8217;s a brief taste of some of that data that Krugman was alluding to:</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/health_stats1.jpg"><br />Source: OECD.</p>
<p>But this is just a sample; there&#8217;s virtually no metric in which the US health care system provides better care than those of other countries, other than in care for the very rich.  The reality is that the average person in the US receives mediocre care that is extremely expensive.</p>

<blockquote><p>Finally, to put the Democratic obstructionists in an especially uncomfortable position, it would make sense to start proposing fallback positions that at least get personal accounts started. One idea would be to defuse the fatuous &#8220;risky stock market&#8221; argument by simply offering a plan where workers can have a private account, but are permitted to purchase only Treasury bills. Take the stock market out of the equation and there is not even the odor of risk with personal accounts.</p></blockquote>
<p>Max has some fun with this:</p>
<blockquote><p>But &#8230; but &#8230; I thought Government bonds were &#8220;just IOUs&#8221;?!?</p></blockquote>
<p>I guess it is no surprise that Stephen changed his tune when writing for the <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/moore/moore200504110952.asp">National Review</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>All that said, such a reform plan is the only way to solve the financial crisis of Social Security. Workers would get much better returns and benefits through personal accounts. And the large accounts in Ryan-Sununu would shift so much of the future benefit obligations of Social Security to the accounts that the Social Security program would be left in permanent surplus.</p></blockquote>
<p>If the plan is to have workers put their personal accounts into government bonds paying a real return of 2% rather than having the Trust Fund buy government bonds paying a real return of 2%, how is this a “better return”?</p>

                                <p>If you are looking to sell a <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2005/04/11/Autos/used_prius/index.htm">used Prius</a>, the rise in gasoline prices is good news:  </p>
<blockquote><p>NEW YORK (CNN/Money) &#8211; Demand for the gas-electric hybrid Prius is so great that some used Priuses are selling for more than the list price for a new one, a report said on Monday.  Buyers who want to avoid the typical two-month waiting period for the hot Toyota model are willing to pay the premium, according a study conducted by Kelly Blue Book and Harris Interactive. Waits at some dealerships can be considerably longer. The market for the used Prius is so strong that some owners are trying to sell them for more than they paid for them. The survey said that 8 percent of the consumers considered hybrid vehicles in March, twice as much as 4 percent in February. It also said if gas prices reach $3 per gallon 77 percent of car shoppers will seriously consider a more fuel efficient vehicle. </p></blockquote>
<p>The flip side of this story might be companies that purchased SUVs a few years ago to lease.  Jathon Sapsford and Norihiko Shirouzu’s <em>Wall Street Journal </em>article on July 25, 2001 was entitled &#8220;Car-Lease Losses Are Putting Banks&#8217; Earnings Into Reverse&#8221; and noted:</p>
<blockquote><p>Banks poured money into auto leases during the past decade, helping fuel the boom in sport-utility vehicles. Now, demand for this gas-guzzling symbol of 1990s excess is stalling, making a rugged stretch for banks all the more bumpy. Big banks are huge suppliers of car leases, each with multibillion-dollar lease portfolios. In this business, a given bank effectively buys a car, leases it to a customer at a profitable rate, has it returned when the lease expires, then liquidates the car in the used-car market &#8230; The question now is this: Have banks been doing enough to cover their exposure?</p></blockquote>
<p>That is a very good question.  Let’s hope the banks decided to purchase and lease the Prius model.</p>

                                <p>First, the good news: Oil futures (West Texas Intermediate:WTI) for May delivery are <em>only</em> $52.95 per barrel, off from the recent high of $58.28 per barrel.  And it appears gas prices may be peaking for the current driving season at around $2.30 per gallon.  Perhaps that will be the end of stories like the following for awhile: <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&#038;u=/nm/20050410/bs_nm/energy_gasoline_retail_dc_1">&#8220;Average Gas Price at Record $2.29/gal&#8221;</a>.</p>
<p>But oil prices are still substantially higher than a year ago.  WTI was selling for under $35 per barrel in April 2004.  Now it is 50% higher.  So the question is: What will be the impact of these higher prices on the US economy?</p>
<p>Graphs like the following, from the <a href="http://www.doe.gov/">DOE</a>, are being used to show that <i>real</i> gas prices are still lower than prices in the early &#8217;80s.  That is true, but current real gasoline prices are higher than after the &#8217;73 oil price shock.  Note that this graph was produced at the end of last year and the current price of $2.30 per gallon is substantially higher than the DOE&#8217;s projection of $2.00 per gallon.</p>

<p>Both the &#8217;73 and &#8217;79 oil price shocks preceded recessions in the US.  After the &#8217;79 oil crisis, unemployment peaked at 10.8% in 1982.  After the &#8217;73 price shock, unemployment <em>only</em> reached 9%.  It is not comforting that the real price for gasoline is above the peak of the &#8217;73 crisis.</p>
<p>Dr. Altig of <a href="http://macroblog.typepad.com/macroblog/2005/04/energy_prices_n.html">Macroblog</a> has a graph showing US energy usage / real GDP for the last 50 years.  Altig&#8217;s graph shows the US economy has become steadily more efficient in terms of GDP per unit of energy consumed.  But for this post, I will focus on the impact of the price of oil.  The following graph shows the US consumption of oil, in millions of barrels per day.  </p>
<p><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/img/243/2888/640/USOil.jpg"><img border="0" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/img/243/2888/320/USOil.jpg"></a></p>
<p>After peaking in the late &#8217;70s, US oil consumption declined for several years.  This was due to a combination of a US recession, more efficient automobiles, less oil in electricity generation and more efficient industry.  The following graph shows oil consumption by sector.  The industrial sector has never returned to the 1979 consumption levels (due to a combination of efficiencies and substitutes) and &#8220;other uses&#8221; has also declined significantly, primarily because electricity generation has moved away from oil. This leaves motor fuel and &#8220;other transportation&#8221; as the major growth sectors for oil consumption.  </p>
<p><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/img/243/2888/640/oilsector.jpg"><img border="0" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/img/243/2888/320/oilsector.jpg"></a> </p>
<p>This indicates that any reduction in oil consumption will have to come mainly from transportation.  To reduce oil consumption for transportation, people will have to drive less, buy more efficient vehicles, or substitutes, suitable for transportation, will have to be found.</p>
<p>The next graph shows total US oil consumption and imported oil consumption, in dollars, as a % of GDP.  US oil consumption was around 2% of GDP until the 1973 oil crisis when it jumped to 2.8% of GDP.  After the 1979 oil shock, oil consumption jumped to 6% of GDP.  For comparison, in 2004 oil consumption was 2.2% of GDP (imported oil was 1.27% of GDP).   </p>
<p><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/img/243/2888/640/USoilgdp.jpg"><img border="0" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/img/243/2888/320/USoilgdp.jpg"></a>     </p>
<p>On the above graph, I added the impact of $40 and $60 oil for 2005 (enlarge graph to see).  For $40 oil, consumption will be almost 2.5% of GDP.  For $60 oil, consumption will be 3.7% of GDP &#8211; substantially higher than during the 1973 oil crisis.  For this calculation, I assumed 6% nominal GDP growth for 2005.</p>
<p>NOTE: These prices for oil are the average contract price paid for various grades of oil.  This average is usually $5 to $10 below the spot price of WTI.</p>
<p>Note that I also plotted the percentage of GDP used to consume imported oil.  Although imported oil keeps US energy costs lower than otherwise (we would have to use expensive substitutes to replace the oil), it also removes money from the US economy.  At $60 per barrel, imported oil alone will be 2.1% of GDP in 2005.</p>
<p>The importance of imported oil is growing.  The following graph shows the quantities of domestic and imported oil for the last 50 years.  (<a href="http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/aer/txt/ptb0501.html">SOURCE: DOE</a>) This chart includes &#8220;Natural Gas Plant Liquids&#8221; and &#8220;Other Domestic Sources&#8221; as part of the domestic supply.</p>
<p><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/img/243/2888/640/oilsource.jpg"><img border="0" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/img/243/2888/320/oilsource.jpg"></a></p>
<p>In summary, both oil consumption as a % of GDP and real gas prices, will probably be higher in 2005 than after the 1973 gas crisis, but lower than after the 1979 oil shock.  Economist&#8217;s predictions on what price of crude would push the economy into recession have been moving higher.  (See Kash&#8217;s <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/04/oil-prices-and-recession.html">post</a> from Friday.  I think a sustained contract price of over $50 (or WTI price close to $60) would probably trigger a consumer recession in the US.</p>

                                <p>My imagination runs amok while wondering how <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/04/chinas-real-weapon.html">China&#8217;s New Weapon</a> could prove useful to China&#8230;<br />
<blockquote><strong>China to the US:</strong> &#8220;We regret to tell you that we have been disappointed about your decision regarding issue X.  (Selling new arms to Taiwan?  Supporting a Taiwanese declaration of independence?  Increasing pressure on N. Korea beyond what China wants?  Providing public support for a Chinese pro-democracy movement?  Supporting a move by the Philippines to begin drilling for oil in the Spratly Islands?  The possibilities are numerous.)  We find ourselves in the awkward position of pointing out to you that your decision poses great problems for us.  We would like to urge you to reconsider your decision.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>The US to China:</strong> &#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>China to the US:</strong> &#8220;Ah.  We understand, and if there is nothing that we can do to change your mind, we will respect your decision.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By the way, on an unrelated matter and in the spirit of friendship and international cooperation, we thought we should let you know that our central bank has recently told us that its economists recommend a reallocation of its rather large investment portfolio.  Unfortunately, the portfolio managers inside the PBOC tell us that this will involve selling very large quantities of our US Treasury securities.  Furthermore, they tell us that due to some internal bureaucratic restrictions, those sales will have to happen in several large blocks of roughly $50 billion at a time, over the course of just two or three days.  We in the Foreign Ministry hope to be able to change their mind about this, but I fear that our influence may be insufficient to prevent these actions by the central bank.  We hope that this will not cause you too much of an inconvenience.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>The US to China: </strong>&#8220;Hmm.&#8221; Pause. &#8220;Thank you for telling us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You know, we haven&#8217;t actually made any <em>final</em> decisions about issue X.  We&#8217;re still considering all sides of the issue.  Our guiding principle regarding issue X has always been flexibility.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>China to the US:</strong> &#8220;We are so glad to hear that, and we knew that you would agree with us that our mutually beneficial relationship is far too important to jeapordize over such a trivial matter as issue X.  We also agree with you that nothing is more important than flexibility in today&#8217;s modern world, with all of its complicated financial and political relationships.  We know you will be sensitive to the impact that your decisions about issue X will have on China.  And we will do everything in our power to urge our central bank to be just as sensitive to your needs as you are to ours. We should also note that it will apparently still be a little while before our central bank makes any final decisions about its portfolio allocations.  I&#8217;m certain that issue X will be resolved to our mutual satisfaction before that time.&#8221;  </p>
<p>&#8220;Please keep in touch, and have a nice day.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>The NYTimes ran a story yesterday about the potential dangers that the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/08/international/asia/08china.html?hp&#038;ex=1113019200&#038;en=fc61c1ca76990b51&#038;ei=5094&#038;partner=homepage">Chinese Navy&#8217;s rapid buildup</a> may pose to the US.  But China’s increasing military power may well be less important than another weapon that China has acquired over the past few years: substantial control over the fate of the US economy.</p>
<p>Consider that China’s central bank probably holds a few hundred billion dollars worth of US government securities – more than any other single investor in the world aside from the Bank of Japan.  Note that this compares to a total stock of marketable Treasury securities of about $3,000 bn (excluding those held by the Fed and S&#038;L governments), about $1,200 bn of which are held privately in the US and $1,800 of which are held by foreign individuals and institutions.</p>
<p>What would happen if China decided to dump, say, $100 bn of US government bonds on the market all at once?  In fact, what would happen if China simply <em>threatened</em> to do so?  I have no idea what the precise impact on prices and yields would be (though I would be interested to see the estimates of anyone knowledgeable), but I can confidently say that interest rates would end the day higher than they began it.  Probably a lot higher.</p>
<p>Just for the sake of argument, suppose that it turns out that China has enough clout in the bond market to make long-term US interest rates rise by a full percentage point whenever they want.  Just because China has such power doesn’t mean that it would ever do so.  After all, China also has very powerful weapons in the form of nuclear missiles… but in practice, those weapons are not really useful against the US in any conflict other than total war.  Is China’s influence over the US bond market similarly irrelevant, or is it actually a useful weapon?</p>
<p>To answer that question, we need to think about the impact that it would have on both the US and on China.  Possible effects on the US:
<ul>
<li>The effects on the US’s financial markets would be immediate, though possibly only short-term. The US stock market would tumble.  I would find it easy to believe that a one-day rise in long-term rates of 1% could easily trigger a stock market fall of 10%.  The dollar would also immediately fall, probably by a lot.  If these changes in asset prices persisted for a period of some weeks, we would then expect there to be noticeable effects on the real economy&#8230;</li>
<li>The sharp jump in US government bond yields would feed through to mortgage and consumer rates.  Prospective home buyers would immediately have to seriously reevaluate their purchasing plans, and I would expect real estate volume to dry up, very quickly.  The real estate bubble would be over.</li>
<li>The sharp fall in household wealth would probably cause households to curtail spending.  This would be exacerbated by any increase in import prices due to the fall in the dollar.</li>
<li>Business investment spending plans would be put on hold.  The tremendous uncertainty created by such a dramatic move in interest rates would cause a lot of businesses to stop in their tracks, if not directly because of the higher interest rates, then because of the doubts about their future course.</li>
<li>Put these effects together, and I can easily imagine US economic growth coming to an immediate halt.  If interest rates did not recover within a few weeks, a US recession seems entirely plausible to me.</li>
</ul>
<p>What about the effects on China?
<ul>
<li>The Chinese CB (the PBOC) would take enormous capital losses on its reserves.  Such a rise in interest rates would probably wipe out 5% of the value of their bonds (i.e. losses of $10 or $20 billion) even before exchange rate changes are taken into account.  With the possible exchange rate changes, total capital losses could easily total $50-$100 bn.  The real significance of capital losses on the PBOC&#8217;s balance sheet is the subject of some disagreement, but everyone would agree that it would represent some loss for China.</li>
<li>If the PBOC actually sold US bonds (rather than simply threatening to do so), it would probably have to buy back some of the sterilization bonds that they had previously issued in order to keep China’s money supply from shrinking.  This however, could be seen as a good thing for China’s financial system, not a bad.</li>
<li>China&#8217;s interest rates would rise along with the US&#8217;s.  However, since so much of China&#8217;s credit market seems to be allocated by mechanisms other than price, I would expect the real effects of this to be less disruptive than on the US.</li>
<li>If the financial market disturbances were long-lived enough to have real effects so that the US economy slowed, China’s exports would also probably slow.  This would tend to push the Chinese economy toward a recession of its own.</li>
</ul>
<p>To me, it seems that the costs to China are significantly smaller than the costs to the US.  Furthermore, one could argue that the US government is more sensitive to the political fallout of economic dislocation than the Chinese government, simply due to the nature of democracies and totalitarian regimes.</p>
<p>So is this a useful weapon for China?  I think that it probably is.  The tremendous financial volatility and sharp falls in asset prices that would follow financial saber-rattling by the Chinese would impose enormous costs on the US, while imposing moderate costs on China.  By making this calculus clear to the US government, I think that the Chinese government probably will be able to use its leverage over US financial markets as a real bargaining chip if a serious disagreement arises between China and the US in the future.  </p>
<p>Is there any defense against this weapon?  There might be a couple.  Perhaps the best defense would be to enlist the aid of allies (e.g. the Bank of Japan) to buy up as many bonds as the Chinese sell.  And naturally, the Fed would take center stage in the defense of the US, by also buying bonds and rapidly expanding the US&#8217;s monetary base to try to mitigate effects on the US&#8217;s financial markets.  Whether such defenses would be fully effective is anyone&#8217;s guess.</p>
<p>One last note: I think that China’s motives for its accumulation of dollar assets are purely economic – the BWII system has provided enough important benefits to the Chinese economy to justify its support thus far.  The geopolitical benefits to China that I’ve described are simply a side-effect.  Nevertheless, if I were one of China’s leaders, I would feel quite pleased with this addition to my arsenal.</p>
