<p><a href="http://calculatedrisk.blogspot.com/2008/07/us-energy-consumption-as-percent-of-gdp.html">Calculated Risk</a> discusses problems with certain reports concerning per centage of GDP being reported for energy costs as unrealistic, predicting real per centages to be as high as 14% of GDP if prices stay the same or rise.</p>
<p>There is a human side to the increase a few months from now that will possibly be of greater concern than high gas prices.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2008/06/28/northeast_braces_for_home_heating_oil_increases/">The Boston Globe</a> notes an upcoming problem for the Northeast home heating season. I have seen oil for $4.80 plus a gallon, up about $2.00 a gallon from last year. Assuming similar degree days from last season January (08) could mean an increase of 40% in the seasons heating bill.</p>
<p>Assuming the very warm winter of January 07, it would not be so bad when we had plants like forsythia blooming in January in the Boston area. Then again, a different winter such as January 06 saw 30 days of continuous 0 degree temperatures in January, so 40% would be a conservative estimate.</p>

<p>Hat tip to reader Henry Cobb.</p>
<p><a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20080706/bs_afp/germanychinagamesmanufacturingglobalisation">Yahoo news</a> has an article on new directions for globalization:</p>
<blockquote><p>In an effort to cut costs Steiff began outsourcing production to Chinese factories in 2004, and even sent 300 workers there to make sure the bears were up to scratch.</p>
<p>But this week Steiff called time on its Chinese adventure.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are withdrawing from China step by step. For toys of high quality, China is simply not a reliable source,&#8221; the Stuttgarter Nachrichten newspaper quoted chief executive Martin Frechen as saying.</p>
<p>But for this privately owned company, whose teddies sell for up to 120 euros (190 dollars) each and which is trying to win back market share for its trademark bear with a button sewn into its ear, quality is everything.</p>
<p>The multi-billion dollar toy industry has been at the forefront of the massive shift of manufacturing to China where it can pay workers a fraction of what it pays them in the West.</p>
<p>Four out of five toys sold in Europe were made in a Chinese factory, and China exported 22 billion of them of them in 2006.</p>
<p>But problems with quality and a series of scares about safety has made firms a lot more wary.</p>
<p>In the most high profile episode, US toy giant Mattel recalled 21 million toys like Barbie dolls and Batman action figures last year over concerns about toxic lead paint and small magnets that children could choke on.</p>
<p>Mattel admitted later its problems were down to design more than manufacturing flaws, and Chinese authorities have since tightened quality controls and have cracked down on factories producing dangerous toys.</p>
<p>But safety and quality problems remain, and stricter import laws are having the effect of reducing the cost advantage of going east, firms say.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are going to be new regulations in the European Union,&#8221; said Ulrich Brobeil from the German toymakers association DVSI, so it is set to be &#8220;easier and cheaper to manufacture in Germany or in nearby countries.&#8221;</p>
<p>The story is the same in other industries, as textile firms attest.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are feeling that there is a movement in this direction,&#8221; of &#8220;returning,&#8221; Silvia Jungbauer from the industry&#8217;s federation in Germany told AFP.</p>
<p>&#8220;Geographical proximity is playing a predominant role again, quality too,&#8221; Jungbauer said, and most importantly &#8220;cost in China have risen sharply in recent months.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wages for Chinese workers are going up and up, and oil prices above 140 dollars a barrel are also making it significantly pricier for container ships full of teddies and radio-controlled mini-helicopters to sail around the world.</p>
<p>In the past year alone, the cost of producing in China has risen 30 percent, estimates Reinhard Doepfer from the European Fashion and Textile Export Council.</p>
<p>Apart from Chine, &#8220;Albania, Macedonia and Serbia-Montenegro are the hot topics for German industry,&#8221; Doepfer said. &#8220;(But) I can&#8217;t see production coming back to Germany, no way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Indeed Steiff is not moving back to Germany, but to Portugal.</p></blockquote>

                                <p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/06/us/06employer.html?_r=1&#038;hp&#038;oref=slogin">Julia Preston</a> has a few anecdotes about employers who are supposedly having trouble attracting employees at market wages:</p>
<blockquote><p>Mike Gilsdorf, the owner of a 37-year-old landscaping nursery in Littleton, Colo., saw the need for action by businesses last winter when he advertised with the Labor Department, as he does every year, for 40 seasonal workers at market-rate wages to plant, prune and carry his shrubs in the summer heat. Only one local worker responded to the notice, he said, and then did not show up for the job. Mr. Gilsdorf was able to fill his labor force with legal immigrants from Mexico through a federal guest worker program. But that program has a tight annual cap, and Mr. Gilsdorf realized that he might not be so lucky next year. His business could fail, he said, and then even his American workers would lose their jobs.  “We’re not hiring illegals, we’re not paying under the table,” Mr. Gilsdorf said. “But if we don’t get in under the cap and nobody is answering our ads, we don’t have employees.” His group, Colorado Employers for Immigration Reform, is pressing Congress for a much larger and more flexible guest worker program … “I can’t replace those people,” the executive said. She said that despite offering competitive wages from $9 to $17 an hour, the company had failed over the years in repeated efforts to attract nonimmigrant workers because of the state’s tight technology labor market and because of the nature of the work, exacting and tedious. If the workers were fired or arrested, she said, she could fail to meet her contracts.</p></blockquote>
<p>This unnamed executive is reported to receive $20 million a year in compensation (late correction &#8211; no the article said it was $20 million company).  <a href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/beat_the_press_archive?month=07&#038;year=2008&#038;base_name=the_shortage_of_lowpaid_journa">Dean Baker</a> has a problem with this reporting:</p>
<blockquote><p>By contrast, the NYT tells us that many employers want to relax laws penalizing them for hiring undocumented workers because &#8220;they grappled, even in an economic downturn, with shortages of low-wage labor.&#8221; In a market economy, the response to shortages is higher prices, or in this case higher wages. While it is understandable that employers do not want to pay higher wages, just like most of us do not want to pay higher gas prices, that is the way a market works. If they cannot afford to pay higher wages, then in a market economy, they go out of business, just as tens of millions of inefficient businesses have gone out of business as the economy has grown over the last century. It would be helpful if the NYT would apply some basic economics to its discussion of this economic issue.</p></blockquote>
<p>I find it hard to sympathize with a CEO who receives $20 million a year (OK &#8211; we&#8217;re not sure what this CEO makes) but complains about not finding enough workers when her company is paying some workers less than $10 an hour.  Markets respond to labor shortages by increasing the compensation of workers.  Over the past 18 months, we have witnessed a fall in the employment to population ratio from 63.4% to 62.4%.  Over the same period, real wages for production and nonsupervisory workers has declined to the levels witnessed at the end of 2001.  Indeed we are facing another economic downturn at least from the perspective of the labor market.  I’m all for eventually relaxing immigration laws, but let’s not kid ourselves – more immigration during this period of labor market weakness is going to make the labor surplus more severe.</p>

                                <p>Over at the National Review – Mark Levin declares that the late Jesse Helms championed the causes of <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=MjQyN2RhZmEzNGFhYmJmYTY2M2MxMzA3MGFlZGMwMDk=">abused minorities</a>.  More praise came from <a href="http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/nation/5872614.html">President Bush</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Jesse Helms was a kind, decent, and humble man and a passionate defender of what he called the Miracle of America.”</p></blockquote>
<p>If I were a conservative, I would likely agree with <a href="http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2008/07/helms-and-the-b.html">Andrew Sullivan</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>There was nothing decent about the policy record of Jesse Helms.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://matthewyglesias.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/07/the_helms_legacy.php">Matthew Yglesias</a> sums up my thoughts:</p>
<blockquote><p>One fascinating thing about the death of Jesse Helms is the conservative reaction. One might expect that Helms&#8217; death would prompt from conservatives the sorts of things that I might say if, say, Al Sharpton died &#8212; that he and I had some overlapping beliefs and I don&#8217;t regard him as the world-historical villain that the right does, but that he&#8217;s a problematic guy and I regard him and his methods as pretty marginal to American liberalism. But instead conservatives are taking a line that I might have regarded as an unfair smear just a week ago, and saying that Helms is a brilliant exemplar of the American conservative movement.  And if that&#8217;s what the Heritage Foundation and National Review and the other key pillars of American conservatism want me to believe, then I&#8217;m happy to believe it. But it reflects just absolutely horribly on them and their movement that this is how they want to be seen &#8212; as best exemplified by bigotry, lunatic notions about foreign policy, and tobacco subsidies.</p></blockquote>
<p>If I were a conservative – I’d also be embarrassed by the serial nonsense published by the Heritage Foundation and National Review.</p>

<blockquote><p>A House panel voted last week to tie the hands of agency regulatory policy officers (RPOs). The move comes in response to continued concern about President Bush&#8217;s 2007 executive order that expanded the powers of RPOs.</p>
<p>President Bush&#8217;s E.O. 13422 — http://www.ombwatch.org/article/archive/477which amended E.O. 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review — dramatically expands the power of the RPO. E.O. 13422 states, &#8220;no rulemaking shall commence&#8221; without the RPO&#8217;s approval. Conveniently, E.O. 13422 does not define when a rulemaking commences, thus providing the RPO with wide latitude in exercising this new authority.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the RPO can act as a regulatory gatekeeper within the agency. OMB Watch has expressed concern that this power may be abused when the RPO&#8217;s interest align more closely with those of the White House Office of Management and Budget than with the RPO&#8217;s own agency or, more importantly, the public.</p>
<p>E.O. 13422 also requires the RPO be selected from among the presidentially appointed positions already existing within the agency.</p>
<p>While the provision does not technically remove any power from the RPOs, it would tie their hands by cutting off funding for their activities. The provision reads, &#8220;None of the funds made available by this or any other Act may be used&#8221; for Bush&#8217;s changes related to RPOs.</p>
<p>The provision is included in the House FY 2009 Financial Services and General Government Appropriations bill, which the House Appropriations Committee approved by voice vote June 25. That bill funds the Executive Office of the President and some other agencies. However, because the provision states, &#8220;by this or any other Act,&#8221; the bill would freeze funding for RPOs across the federal government.</p></blockquote>
<p>As an official position or designation with attendant priveleges, is an RPO in every agency a usefull function? If used to INCREASE regulatory power, would you agree, since it appears to be a move to promote administrative idealogies against bureaucratic tendencies?</p>
<p>Is greater compliance of some kind useful? Does civil service have a value separate from as well as part of political governing?</p>

<blockquote><p>Stories at <a>Grist</a> and <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/07/going-after-efficiencies.html">AngryBear</a> on the most recent demonic action of WalMart &#8212; high efficiency milk containers.*</p>
<p>Basically, they save heaps of water (for cleaning) and energy (for hauling) by cutting out most of the infrastructure necessary to support the current gallon jugs. The bad news is that the plastic containers do not appear to be more reusuable than the current ones (let alone glass). A deposit and reuse system for these suckers would reduce trash and virgin materials use.</p>
<p>Bottom Line: WalMart arrived at this &#8220;innovation&#8221; by applying cost accounting to every step in the milk production and distribution process. If there is a carbon tax, WalMart will probably be the first company to change its practices in response &#8212; and pass the savings to consumers.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>By: Divorced one like Bush<br /><em>No body knows, how dry I am.  I went home, I rang the bell, my wife came out and gave me hell.</em></p>
<p>Juan posted a link to this paper: <a href="http://www.oxfordenergy.org/pdfs/WPM31.pdf">OPEC Pricing Power</a>, The Need for a New Perspective</p>
<p>Besides the issue of how oil is priced, and the relationship of the futures market (yes, it is related to the real thingy) there are some numbers presented as to future expected oil production via IEA.  <br />
<blockquote>In an exercise which focuses on Middle East and North Africa (MENA) oil and gas resources, the IEA (2005) projects in the reference scenario a rise in MENA oil production from the 2004 level of 29 mbd to 33 mbd in 2010 and 50 mbd in 2030. In this scenario, Saudi Arabia will remain the largest supplier increasing its output from 10.4 mbd in 2004 to 11.9 mbd in 2010 and over 18 mbd in 2030.</p></blockquote>
<p>MENA was projected to pump 50,000,000 barrels per day in just 22 years from now.  </p>
<p>From this paper: <a href="http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/servicerpt/anwr/pdf/sroiaf(2008)03.pdf">Analysis of Crude Oil Production in the  Arctic National Wildlife Refuge </a>May 2008<br />
<blockquote>In the low and high ANWR oil resource cases, additional oil production resulting from the opening of ANWR peaks in 2028 at 510,000 and 1.45 million barrels per day, respectively. <br />Between 2018 and 2030, cumulative additional oil production is 2.6 billion barrels for the mean oil resource case, while the low and high resource cases project a cumulative additional oil production of 1.9 and 4.3 billion barrels, respectively.</p></blockquote>
<p>So, let us apply some Angry Bear thinking.  At the pumping rate in 2030 of MENA, under the best of realizations of ANWR (4.3 billion barrels of oil waiting for our binge), MENA could pump it dry in 86 days!  Three months.  A lousy 3 months.</p>
<p>But you say: <em>Hey bartender, Hey man, <a href="http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/aeo/otheranalysis/ongr.html">looka here</a>&#8230;</em><br />In 2003 they say we have 59,090,000,000 barrels of oil in the lower 48 and off shore.  With ANWR&#8217;s best reality, that gives us a total of 63,390,000,000 barrels of oil.  Billions and billions of barrels.</p>
<p><em>A draw one, draw two, draw three four glasses of beer&#8230;</em>  at 50,000,000 barrels a day we can drink for 1267.8 days.  That is 3.47 years.  That&#8217;s it. No more home brew.  At our rate of use, 20,687,000 barrels/day, we&#8217;re dry in 8.4 years.  That&#8217;s only about 2/3rds of the amount of time I keep a vehicle. I won&#8217;t be able to wear out my car! </p>
<p>Still not convinced that drilling is not much of an answer? Then consider that in 2005 <a href="http://www.beersoaksamerica.org/consumption.htm">the US drank </a>7,500,000,000 gallons of beer. There are 42 gallons in a barrel of oil.  That means the US drank in that year 1,785,471,428.6 OBB (oil barrels of beer).   Thus, at the rate we drink beer, we could hit the bottom of the barrel in 35.5 years.  If EIA&#8217;s highend is correct, we can drink ANWR beer for 2.4 year.  If not, then we&#8217;re going to be jonesing in just over 1 year.</p>

                                <p>Well more than you might think.</p>
<p>If you examine the economic and demographic assumptions that together generate the standard Intermediate Cost alternative of the Social Security Trustees you see a picture of a future America that is kind of bleak. I mean I lived through the period from 1968 to 1983 and economically it was not much fun. We had war and assasinations and oil crises and three recessions and a constitutional crisis over impeachment. It wasn&#8217;t all doom and gloom, over that same rough time period the world transtioned from the baseline assumption that nuclear armeggedon was pretty much ultimately unavoidable to a place where that prospect seemed inconceivable. And as a kid who grew up with school &#8220;duck and cover&#8221; drills that was an unalloyed good, but still there was a widespread sense that in particular these kind of economic outcomes were outside the norm, that times had been better before and that times would be better again. In part this was just nostalgia for an America that for a lot of people really never was, after all &#8216;Happy Days&#8217; and &#8216;Back to the Future&#8217; were not exactly documentaries, but Reagan&#8217;s &#8216;Morning in America&#8217; had a real resonance to people, there was a real sense that the future could be better than the immediate past and even the imagined past of the fifties as seen through the lens of &#8216;Father Knows Best&#8217;.</p>
<p>But none of that optimism shows up in the Tables and Figures of the Social Security Reports. Instead they and commenters thereon insist that the future is simply going to mirror the outcomes of 1968-1983, indeed just the other day I had a commenter that insisted that Low Cost outcomes were impossible because they were inconsistent with the last forty years. Well that is what happens when you pick a starting point that manages to take in all of the worst post-war years and ignores everything that happened before. I will be unpacking some numbers below the fold but want to leave these doomsayers with a hopefully provocative question.</p>
<p>Why the hell are you betting against America? While we maybe well and truly entering permanent Roubini-land why are you doubling down based on that?</p>
<p>As I say it all starts with the numbers, and in particular the numbers as seen in Table V.B1: Principal Economic Assumptions, Table V.B2: Additional Economic Factors, and Table V.A1: Principal Demographic assumptions, all of which (and many more) to be found in <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/trLOT.html">2008 Social Security Report: List of Tables</a>. The Economic tables show outcomes in five year periods since 1960 and annually since 1997 and then turn around and project annual results for the following ten years  and then for multi-year periods (V.B1) or intervals (V.B2) after that. The Demographic table reports both by interval back to 1940 and then annually from 1995. Going forward Table V.A1 projects results with 5 year intervals.</p>
<p>Generally speaking the various models of the Trustees&#8217; Report assume that under all three alternatives (Low Cost, Intermediate Cost, and High Cost) results will settle out in the relatively short term at ultimate levels. Which is just another way of defining long term sustainability of the US economy under projections that are presumed to range from optimistic (Low Cost) to pessimistic (High Cost) with Intermediate serving as a median. So lets take a look at some of those numbers and contrast them with 2004, a year of good economic performance but not one that most people would remember as exceptional.</p>
<p>Productivity: 2004  2.4%;  High Cost ultimate 1.4%;  Intermediate Cost 1.7%; Low Cost 2.0%<br />Real Wage: 2004  1.8%; High Cost .6%; Intermediate Cost  1.1%; Low Cost 1.6%<br />Unemployment: 2004  5.5%; High Cost 6.5%; Intermediate Cost 5.5%; Low Cost 4.5%<br />Real GDP: 2004 3.6%; High Cost 1.2%; Intermediate Cost 2.1%; Low Cost 2.9%<br />Immigration: 2004 1.25 million; High Cost .77 million; Intermediate Cost 1.025 million; Low Cost 1.305 million</p>
<p>Now I know some people will want to jump in and start the standard defense of &#8216;Boomers!&#8217; and &#8216;Covered worker ratio!!&#8217;. And yeah I get that but these ultimate numbers are all for period beyond 2050 when the impact of the Boomers on the economy should be pretty much a fading memory (we will be 86 to 104 in 2050). Why on earth should we assume that even optimistic numbers for the second half of the twenty-first century will trail the numbers of the second half of the twentieth century so badly? I understand that conditions approaching perma-recession could happen, I am the farthest thing from a global warming denier or from not recognizing the food/fuel crisis going forwards. On the other hand I am not just ready to simply write America&#8217;s economic future off as a lost cause either.</p>
<p>I am not happy with the status of America today. Which doesn&#8217;t mean I have lost faith in its possibilities tommorrow. Which know it or not is exactly what embracers of Social Security &#8216;crisis&#8217; have done. Dudes and dudettes what caused you to lose your faith here? Criminy its the Fourth of July.</p>

                                <p>So says <a href="http://www.rgemonitor.com/us-monitor/252884/unleash_fiscal_policy_now_or_more_severe_recession_ahead">Robert Reich</a>. And what he means is investment in infrastructure.</p>
<p>When Philip Swagel, the administration&#8217;s spokesman, was asked if the economy needs another stimulus package after having lost 62,000 jobs, all <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/03/AR2008070303317.html?hpid=topnews">he</a> could say was</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I-it seems, you know, it seems like that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s enough, uh, enough.&#8221;<br />What might trigger another round of economic stimulus?<br />&#8220;I don&#8217;t, I guess I don&#8217;t have an answer, I mean, you know, beyond saying we look at all the data and, um &#8212; so, my usual line.&#8221; </p></blockquote>
<p>Neither men will address the problem of trade. Both see fiscal policy as governing economic health, albeit in differences large enough to continue the irrelevant debate that has consumed both political parties since time began. Boiled down into sound bites, which seems the only way either party can function, the fiscal argument usually revolves around taxation and spending.<br />Meanwhile, the twin deficits continue to rise. Our last trade surplus was in 1975&#8211;mostly downhill from then. Strangely enough our account deficit has risen since then. Conclusion? We relied more and more on credit, both personal and governmental.</p>
<p>Clintonites will argue, of course, that under their watch, there were account surpluses. I would point out, however, that the trade balance began to rise sharply in the Clinton watch, moving from -70 billion in 1993 to -378 billion in 2000.</p>
<p>Clinton rode the dot.com wave&#8230;.lucky. He happened to govern while the U.S. led the world in a marvelous IT revolution. While jobs increased and government coffers filled, the trade deficit increased sharply, over 500%. In short, the central issue of trade was muffled. Have you ever heard a Clintonite brag about trade surpluses?</p>
<p>Since Clinton, of course, the trade deficit has doubled. The only bright spot in the trade deficit has been services, mostly financial. (Republicans like bankers. Unfortunately, financial services while a golden opportunity for a few, were not so good for the average American.) Various arguments have been used to soften this harsh reality; economists have gone to measure deficits in terms of percentage of GDP, hopefully to show us that it aint all that bad. Well, it is. Trade is important.</p>
<p>Some economists argue that the falling dollar will make our goods cheaper on the world market, thus dramatically improving our trade balance. Hmmmm. Aint happened yet. We keep shedding manufacturing jobs.</p>
<p>To keep ahead of the downward curve, businesses outsource or overseas everything, from teeth to sneakers. Of course, the fallling dollar will encourage foreign tourists&#8230;. but now there is the problem of oil. On this last and most dramatic of our headaches, I would suggest that it may be the straw that breaks the camel&#8217;s back or it may be ironically be our savior.</p>
<p>How our savior? If the present spike in oil is not primarily speculation&#8211;and I suggest that we will know this by year&#8217;s end&#8211; and if exporting countries stop subsidizing the cost of oil&#8211;, then we may have to become more local. Transportation costs of goods will rise, from ships and planes to trucks. Rail will be less expensive. (Now there&#8217;s an infrastructure worth talking about.)</p>
<p>Additionally, we will have either to find alternatives to oil in the manufacturing of some goods (plastics, for example) or find suitable alternatives that do do require oil. We also need cars with much, much better mileage. In other words, inventiveness will again count. Shortcuts&#8211;cheap labor and environmental degradation&#8211;will be throttled.</p>
<p>If the present spike is speculation&#8211;and I suspect it isn&#8217;t&#8211;, then we will be left with facing our old bugaboo: Trade. And no amount of pump priming fiscal policy a la tax cuts or infrastructure will do the complete job.</p>

<p>Strangely, the scuttlebutt in the market <a href="http://www.reuters.com/articlePrint?articleId=USN0148556720080702">yesterday</a> was that the valuation should be around $24 billion. Or at least that&#8217;s how I read this paragraph:<br />
<blockquote>If the portfolio&#8217;s value were to drop to below about $24 billion, that could indicate mortgage-backed securities have fared even worse in the second quarter than markets have already reflected, analysts said.</p></blockquote>
<p>So the Fed thinks the market for those securities is about 23% higher than market professionals were telling Reuters it was yesterday.</p>
<p>If I were a Fed policymaker, and I hadn&#8217;t been worying about <a href="http://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/tslf.html">the TSLF</a> before, I would be now.</p>
