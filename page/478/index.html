<blockquote><p>&#8220;&#8230;it is also possible that weather conditions were so severe and so<br />unique that no amount of preparation or skill in command and control or<br />communication could have saved the 107+ (rdan here&#8230;now 128) confirmed dead. In this case,the disaster is simply an uncontrollable act of nature that could not<br />have been avoided nor mitigated. Part of me hopes that this is the case,<br />yet the idea that bushfires &#8211; a natural Australian phenomenon &#8211; should<br />somehow become more unpredictable and severe than normal is<br />questionable. The human element &#8211; notably a failure in communication &#8211;<br />is likely to be a major factor in the deaths resulting in these fires.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>These statements caught my eye in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/">Mankiw&#8217;s article in the NYT on trade relations</a> between the US and China, cautioning against protectionism, whatever that actually means:</p>
<blockquote><p>Critics of China say it is keeping the yuan undervalued to gain an advantage in the international marketplace. A cheaper yuan makes Chinese goods less expensive in the United States and American goods more expensive in China. As a result, American producers find it harder to compete with Chinese imports in the United States and to sell their own exports in China.</p>
<p>There is, however, another side to the story. The loss to American producers comes with a gain to the many millions of American consumers who prefer to pay less for the goods they buy.</p></blockquote>
<p>and this:</p>
<blockquote><p>So when the Treasury secretary complains about the undervalued yuan, his message to the Chinese boils down to this: Stop lending us money.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here at Angry Bear we are trying to expand the issue into a more accurate picture rather than a dichotomy of code words&#8230;see the most recent series on <a target="_blank" href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/02/legal-protectionism-new-mercantilism.html">mercantilism</a>, China&#8217;s domestic problems, and the results of our &#8220;free trade&#8221; policies, which also were a particular set of rules for only capital through the World Trade Organization and trade agreements.  &#8220;Free trade&#8221; and less defined &#8220;fair trade&#8221; have become code words in the public conversation that relate to little in reality.</p>

<p>Again I apologize for simple links, but my time is being held hostage to circumstances.  No one in the hubbub of today linked to Guerby&#8217;s post, so I thought it worth a look, along with AB thought on the matter, from Kash and Angry Bear.  Maybe another Bear can add more.</p>

<blockquote><p>In an earlier post Kash gave some data on declining labor force participation, a decline that is particularly sharp among men and people with a high school degree or more education. We don&#8217;t really have an explanation for the pattern, though one theory is that people are going back to school &#8212; basically building up human capital while waiting out the bad times (Matt Y. and a number of CalPundit commenters second this theory.)</p>
<p>The economists over at Economists for Dean have what is likely another big part of the explanation: rising disability claims. When a worker claims disability, they are not counted as part of the labor force, and disability claims are up a lot. Economists for Dean cite a recent NYT Op/Ed by Austin Goolsbee that addresses this point:</p></blockquote>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>I hear from a friend that some of my posts have not been warmly welcomed by economists with PhDs from the economics department of the University of Minnesota.</p>
<p>I thought I would share more of my impressions of economic research that has been done over there after the jump </p>
<p>For one thing, there is this thesis defence tomorrow and I have to decide whether a dissertation written in part over at U Minnesota is a significant and original contribution to economic research.  I know I should keep an open mind, but I think it is.  </p>
<p>My objections to the Minnesota economics department are really two.  One I think they try to force students to learn more math than they should.  I understand that the workload is less extreme than it used to be, but I think the approach (or the old approach) has costs as well as benefits.</p>
<p>Second, I think that a <a href="http://woodrow.mpls.frb.fed.us/research/prescott/papers/timetobuild.pdf">27 year old paper (warning pdf)</a> had too much influence on the department and the profession.  Now the paper may have been reasonable when it was published.  A serious problem is that it was based on an estimate of the <a href="http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/260724">intertemporal elasticity of substitution in consumption</a> (warning you have to pay to read) which was based on miss-timed instruments.</p>
<p>However, this paper has little to do with the research from Minnesota which I have encountered recently.  I don&#8217;t look for it and so I will discuss a very small random sample of seminars which I happen to remember.</p>
<p>One problem with the original micro founded macro literature (the original fresh water macro then New Keynesian stochastic dynamic general equilibrium) is that a huge shortcut was made from micro to macro &#8212; the representative consumer assumption.  The idea was that aggregates can be interpreted as the choices of a single infinitely lived agent.  This assumption would be exact if we were immortal and exactly equal in wealth and ability and tastes.  It can also hold in special cases without perfect equality.  It&#8217;s a strong assumption made in many papers (many of them with my name on them).</p>
<p>OK so vivid memories of economics from Minnesota</p>
<p>A paper the effect of divorce on aggregate savings&#8221; Presented by Victor Rios Rull (written with a co-author). Oh my no representative agent here.  Within the family husband and wife bargain with the wife eager to save more as she will get the kids and poverty in case of divorce.  The question is did increased divorced rates cause lower savings rates in the USA.  The authors get an integrity prize, because after working out the model the final result was the opposite of the initial guess.  In the model increased divorce causes increased savings.</p>
<p>Vested Interests in a Positive Theory of Stagnation and Growth<br />P Krusell, JV Rios-Rull </p>
<p>on the political economy of economies in transition. Interest groups.  Reform blocked by vested interests.  No representative consumer there.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/498049">Polygyny, Fertility and Savings. <br />Michel Tertlit</a></p>
<p>In societies with polygyny (one husband many wives) there is great supply of potential husbands.  Therefore it is common for the groom to pay the father of the bride (opposite of a dowery). This is a fact. This increases the value of children as opposed to physical capital (or education of children) as an investment and might explain why polygynous societies haven&#8217;t gotten rich (unless there is Oil under them).  This is a fact.</p>
<p>Again  macroeconomic effects of economics of the family.  Redistribution among in laws is key.  Far as one can get from a representative agent.</p>
<p>Giordano Zevi</p>
<p>Primogeniture and urbanization.  In continental europe there are strict laws of inheritance which used to be much stricter.  In particular in some times and places only the eldest son inherited.  I just learned this is still true of inheritance of land in Alto Adige (SudTirole).  In France some provinces had primogeniture and others didn&#8217;t.  Napoleon changed all that ruling that all children (even girls) got equal shares.  Under neither rule could an heir be disinherited without cause.</p>
<p>The idea was to keep farms going (still is in Alto Adige).  Did the laws have an effect on the migration from the countryside to cities.  </p>
<p>Sure looks that way.</p>
<p>Here we have macro effects of distribution within the family again.  Also a natural experiment.</p>
<p>Look after 27 years the representative agent becomes not only implausible but also boring.  Economists look for new challenges.  Their work is reliably interesting and sometimes convincing (I really like the paper on Polygyny)</p>

                                <p>Via <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2009/02/executive-pay.html">Mark Thoma</a>, Uwe Reinhardt* hits one out of the park on <a href="http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/02/06/supply-demand-and-executive-pay/">economist&#8217;s research abilities</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Evidently, in the mind of economists, Lone Ranger C.E.O.’s can make truly astronomical contributions to a firm’s market capitalization, ceteris paribus, which justifies high bid prices for them. Why Lone Ranger C.E.O.’s who have trashed their firm’s market capitalization should be sent off to pasture with hundred-million-dollar golden parachutes — which occurs with remarkable frequency — seems to be not much analyzed by economists. Perhaps other things did not remain equal. [emphasis mine]</p></blockquote>
<p>Or, as Warren Buffett famously observed (roughly): &#8220;If a good manager goes to a bad company, it is generally the reputation of the manager that is changed.&#8221;**  And even Michael Porter, who never saw a manager he didn&#8217;t like, <a href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article.cfm?articleid=1594">recently changed his tune</a>:<br />
<blockquote>When Porter started out studying strategy, he believed most strategic errors were caused by external factors, such as consumer trends or technological change. &#8220;But I have come to the realization after 25 to 30 years that many, if not most, strategic errors come from within. The company does it to itself.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Those of us who know that economists use thr phrase &#8220;technological change&#8221; because &#8220;magic&#8221; would get them laughed out of meetings can only say, &#8220;Gee, Really?&#8221;</p>
<p>Reinhardt also notes that Robert Frank cites the Gabaix/Lander &#8220;study&#8221; of executive compensation. Reinhardt notes:<br />
<blockquote>Readers may wonder about the survival of this theory, even among economists, as stock prices have begun to tumble sharply, starting in 2007.</p></blockquote>
<p>Since I don&#8217;t feel like retreading, here are links to <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/05/why-has-ceo-pay-increased-so-much.html">PGL here in 2007</a> and Tom at the Legacy Blog in <a href="http://atbozzo.blogspot.com/2006/05/news-flash-ceos-are-overpaid.html">2006</a>, <a href="http://atbozzo.blogspot.com/2007/05/from-archives-on-gabaix-and-landier-on.html">2007</a>, and <a href="http://atbozzo.blogspot.com/2008/04/bad-penny.html">2008</a>.</p>
<p>Reinhardt continues:<br />
<blockquote>Readers may also wonder why, in the United States, the ratio of total executive compensation (including bonuses and deferred compensation, pensions and perks) to the comparable figure earned by non-management employees rose from 50 in 1980 to 301 by 2003 for the 300 to 400 largest corporations (and to 500 in very large corporations), while that ratio typically has remained so much lower in Europe and in Asia. Are corporate executives in Europe and Asia so vastly inferior to their American counterparts, or is the supply of potential C.E.O.’s so much larger there as to drive down the ratio in, say, Japan, to as low a 3?</p></blockquote>
<p>Reinhardt promises to talk about the cl*st*rf*ck that is GE (last discussed by me <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/01/ratings-stocks-and-credibility.html">here</a>) in his next post.</p>

<p>What do these three things have in common and what possible relevance do they have to the debate over the Stimulus Bill?</p>
<p>The short answer is belief systems. Over at Krugman&#8217;s blog there was a certain amount of baffled debate over issues connected with the Treasury View. From the outside in these views seem to be irrational and counter-factual, people simply don&#8217;t react in the real world in ways that would be necessary. Which leads some of us to wonder if they are lying, ignorant, or insane. And the answer is two-fold and paradoxical-none of the above and all of the above. It is a question of where you stand.</p>
<p>Those interested in some amateur philosophy can follow me below the fold. Warning plenty of pretentious pedantry ahead.<br />St. Anselm of Canterbury, a towering giant in the political, intellectual and theological worlds of the 11th century is known today, if known at all, as one of the earliest proponents of the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontological_argument">Ontological Argument for the Existence of God</a>. While the argument itself is interesting (and not so obviously right or obviously wrong as it appears at first glance) I am not so much focusing on it as on the circumstances under which it was formed. Anselm was not a Seeker, not a Doubter and neither was much of his intended audience. His personal belief in the existence of God was unshakeable and not really the product of logic at all and his argument was not intended to proof anything, instead it was a way to further justify belief. That is if you presented him with a line of argumentation to prove that God did not exist he would seek to find the flaw. Similarly if his own argument seemed to fail he would not have changed his belief, instead he would have started his argument over. Because accepting the conclusion would be unthinkable.</p>
<p>Generally most of us have learned to live with people whose religious belief systems are not from the outside totally explicable. Some of the more uncharitable of us mock people of faith, but only a few fanatics seriously try to directly convert them to pure secularism, because secularism is a belief system of its own with its own blind spots. But once we push beyond the realm of religious faith we tend to lose sight that there are all kinds of belief systems out there that bind us in one way or another. We just don&#8217;t see that any given &#8216;counterfactual conclusion&#8217; might really be that the conclusion is just incompatible with your particular belief system. Which doesn&#8217;t make you a liar necessarily, nor does it mean you are ignorant in the sense of unaware of the data in question, nor does it make you crazy in any sense that wouldn&#8217;t apply to any other Believer. But it might make you blind to the fact that your conclusion is ultimately faith based. St. Anselm was a great man in every sense of the word, and a brilliant intellect, but your chances of using any mode of argumentation to prove that God didn&#8217;t exist, or even to cast some doubt on the question to him would have been vanishingly small.</p>
<p>Thomas Kuhn argued in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.des.emory.edu/mfp/kuhnsyn.html">The Structure of Scientific Revolutions</a> that most of what we know as science is simply the product of working within a belief system. In fact he calls the work product of this &#8216;Normal Science&#8217;. The above link is to a synopsis of Kuhn by Prof. Frank Pajares who introduces the subject as follows:<br />
<blockquote>A scientific community cannot practice its trade without some set of received beliefs. These beliefs form the foundation of the &#8220;educational initiation that prepares and licenses the student for professional practice&#8221;. The nature of the &#8220;rigorous and rigid&#8221; preparation helps ensure that the received beliefs are firmly fixed in the student&#8217;s mind. Scientists take great pains to defend the assumption that scientists know what the world is like&#8230;To this end, &#8220;normal science&#8221; will often suppress novelties which undermine its foundations. Research is therefore not about discovering the unknown, but rather &#8220;a strenuous and devoted attempt to force nature into the conceptual boxes supplied by professional education&#8221;.</p>
<p>A shift in professional commitments to shared assumptions takes place when an anomaly undermines the basic tenets of the current scientific practice These shifts are what Kuhn describes as scientific revolutions &#8211; &#8220;the tradition-shattering complements to the tradition-bound activity of normal science&#8221; New assumptions –&#8221;paradigms&#8221; &#8211; require the reconstruction of prior assumptions and the re-evaluation of prior facts. This is difficult and time consuming. It is also strongly resisted by the established community.</p></blockquote>
<p> The much abused word &#8216;paradigm&#8217; is roughly equivalent to &#8216;belief system&#8217;. In particular practitioners of Normal Science first and natural reaction to anomalies that don&#8217;t fit into the paradigm is to assume error in data collection or analysis. Only grudgingly will they admit that the paradigm is itself faulty and even then the impulse is not to adandon it but to adjust it. To the outside observer this can end up with results that seem obsessive. Kuhn&#8217;s first major work and the inspiration of &#8216;Scientific Revolutions&#8217; was <a target="_blank" href="http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&#038;id=sWScX_aduGMC&#038;dq=kuhn+copernican+revolution&#038;printsec=frontcover&#038;source=web&#038;ots=WE4zwySwWw&#038;sig=HTrkTb90St-umiC9JuZglv7axWY&#038;ei=eiuPSffdApqWsAODhon3CA&#038;sa=X&#038;oi=book_result&#038;resnum=1&#038;ct=result">Copernican Revolution</a> (a book I have not actually read) was devoted in part to a defense of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.princeton.edu/~hos/mike/texts/ptolemy/ptolemy.html">Ptolemaic Astronomers</a>. These people were not simply in denial, they certainly were not ignorant, and not crazy. They were though embedded in a particular belief system in much the same way Anselm was. Heaven like God had to be perfect, Earth had to be at the center of the universe, and the most perfect of all shapes is the circle. That the resulting system was to the modern observer fantastically convoluted to the believer is a feature and not a bug. Medieval Astronomy like Medieval Theology like Talmudic Scholarship was extraordinarily complicated, but for believers that complexity was just a feature, nobody ever promised anybody that Truth comes in easy packages.</p>
<p>Which finally gets us back to Libertarianism and Classical Liberal Economics. To the extent you can distinguish between the two the practitioners tend to insist that they are just engaging in rational scientific practice. Some of them push this idea to the extreme, for people like Prof. Bryan Caplan rejecting his conclusions make you by definition irrational. For example take two short passages from his <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gmu.edu/departments/economics/bcaplan/autobio.htm">Intellectual Autobiography</a><br />
<blockquote>Matt read Atlas Shrugged.  One day he turned around in his chair and told me “Read this part.  You’ll like it.”  It was Francisco d’Anconia’s speech on money, and I rushed through it in fifteen exciting minutes.  But for unclear reasons, I didn’t begin reading Atlas until the last week of summer before my senior year.  If memory serves me, I raced through its thousand-plus pages in three largely sleepless days.</p>
<p>I would not call myself an instant convert.  But I did start what I call “trying on her ideas for size.”  When opportunity presented itself &#8211; or when I cornered my parents or friends or teachers or random fellow students &#8211; I played devil’s advocate for Rand’s Objectivism.   After a couple of months &#8211; a long time in the intellectual life of a teen-ager &#8211; I was not playing devil’s advocate any longer.  I was convinced that her philosophy was by and large correct.</p></blockquote>
<p>and<br />
<blockquote>As I digested the stock of libertarian insight, I noticed a phenomenon central to my mature research: Most people violently rejected even my most truistic arguments.  Yes, I was a shrill teen-ager, but it seems like anyone should have recognized the potential downside of drug regulation once I pointed it out.  Instead, they yelled louder about Thalidomide babies.  True, it was not a complete surprise &#8211; I had already experienced the futility of trying to convert my family and friends to atheism during the prior year.  But I was frustrated to find that human beings were almost as dogmatic about politics and economics as they were about religion and philosophy.</p></blockquote>
<p>There are words for people who believe that Faith precedes Reason, that using the latter to justify the former is just the normal course of logical and even scientific thinking. Some of those words are pretty unkind, when I read libertarians my first judgment is &#8216;crazy as a bedbug&#8217;. But I am willing to give St. Anselm and the Ptolemaic Astronomers a pass, they were simply engaged in the Normal Science of their day. </p>
<p>St. Anselm would have been happy to admit he was hemmed in by the limits of his belief systems. Certain things had been established by the Early Doctors of the Church at the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dailycatholic.org/history/councils.htm">eight Great Ecumenical Councils</a> and going outside those limits was heretical and at times and places subject to punishment by being burned alive. What fundamentally distinguishes people of openly religious faith and believers in Economics as Science is that most of the latter simply refuse to acknowledge that they have converted to a particular belief system and so are constrained by it. This is something they share with most Normal Scientists who tend still to reject Kuhn&#8217;s sociological analysis really on the basis that it challenges the very basis of their (to them) invisible belief system.</p>
<p>So yes Economics is scientific, just as Medieval Scholasticism was scientific, and as Ptolemaic Astronomy was scientific. None of which makes its conclusions true for all time. Einstein went to his death bed still struggling with the implications of Quantum Mechanics. He simply wouldn&#8217;t believe that in the end much of the Universe could only be explained by God Playing Dice.</p>
<p>I am not at all claiming that the Republican Senators and their enablers are Saints, or Scholars. And God knows none of them are Einstein. I am just saying that you have to understand that like the medieval scholars they are trapped within a fundamentally faith based model that insists that Markets are Perfect. If they have to insert a few epicycles into their theory (or in this case accept the Treasury View) to make it work well that is just the way it is. Nobody said Faith was supposed to be Easy.</p>

                                <p>by divorced one like Bush<br />Updated comment at end</p>
<p>So, now that the Democratic Party has the majority and the White House, why am I not hearing about the use of the Nuclear Option?  I mean, it occurred to me that if there was a way to end the partisan old ways, the Nuclear Option is it.  It sure worked well for the Bush administration.  You need 60 votes?  Bring in the non-executive executive senate menber: Biden.  Oh, you think there needs to be a tie to be broken before our hatchet man can be used?  Well I have news for you.  Being that everything comes down to breaking the 60 vote line to get anything done, by precedent of calling for a record number of filibusters the Republicans have set the new definition of a tie: 59/41.  Biden makes it 60/41.</p>
<p>This gets me to the trust issue and I&#8217;m going to toot my own horn here for those who think human capital is bunk regarding getting us out of this mess. (Did I mention the flower shop was off 13% for Christmas and 45% for January?  Yeah, I got skin in this game.)  </p>
<p>Seems on the same day I posted my message to the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/02/attention-republicansblue-dog.html">Republicans and the Blue Dogs</a>, a man officially of the economic science posted on the same subject (via C &#038; L via Naked Capitalism).<br /><a href="http://blogs.ft.com/maverecon/2009/02/fiscal-expansions-in-submerging-markets-the-case-of-the-usa-and-the-uk/#more-428">Willem Buiter</a>.</p>
<p>Here is what I said:<br />
<blockquote>The greatest harm that is coming from the republican&#8217;s drive to instill their minority will on the many out of selfish want, is to further the demise of the people&#8217;s trust. For the blue dogs it is their ignorance of their economic ideology that creates the mistrust. The republicans/blue dogs, and those helping them by lending their &#8220;professionalism&#8221;, think they are only effecting a political strategy. In truth, they are destroying the very basis for the wealth they desire. Their entire campaign for decades to discredit, to instill mistrust in the primary institution we have, the US (We the People) government, has been the primary cause to our economic decline. To increase the level of distrust is to decrease the available “intangible capital” which is 77% of our wealth generating power.</p></blockquote>
<p>  Here is Willem Buiter:<br />
<blockquote>As part of this widespread erosion of social capital, both citizens and markets lost faith in the ability of governments to commit themselves to any future course of action that was not validated, at each future point in time, as the most opportunistic course of action at that future point in time &#8211; what macroeconomists call time-consistent policies and game theorists call ’subgame-perfect’ strategies.</p>
<p>This morality tale has important consequences for a government’s ability to conduct effective countercyclical policy.  For a fiscal stimulus (current tax cut or public spending increase) to boost demand, it is necessary that the markets and the public at large believe that sooner or later, measures will be taken to reverse the tax cut or spending increase in present value terms.  If markets and the public at large no longer believe that the authorities will assure fiscal sustainability by raising future taxes or cutting future public expenditure by the necessary amounts, they will conclude that the government plans either to permanently monetize the increased amounts of public debt resulting from the fiscal stimulus, or that it will default on its debt obligations. </p></blockquote>
<p>Mr. Buiter is prescribing a different solution to the lack of trust than what I&#8217;m going to suggest.  He thinks more money to the banks is needed to promote lending.  Well, isn&#8217;t that kind of giving to those you know you can not trust, not to mention just adding to the debt that he notes no one seems to want to consider?  He did state the following as part of his “morality tale”: <br />
<blockquote>During the decade leading up to the crisis, current account deficits increased steadily and became unsustainable.  Strong domestic investment (much of it in unproductive residential construction) outstripped domestic saving. Government budget discipline dissipated; fiscal policy became pro-cyclical.  Financial regulation and supervision was weak to non-existent, <strong>encouraging credit</strong> and asset price booms and bubbles.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hope was the word.  Trust is the need.  I&#8217;ve seen and lived what the Republicans and Blue Dogs can do.  I&#8217;m willing to take a chance for the benefit of building future trust, thus building with the 77% of our power, thus nurturing hope, and let Obama send in Biden to the Senate.  Hell, maybe it&#8217;s time they come up with the unitary vice executive theory and take it for a spin in the Senate!   In-other-words, my solution is for Obama et al to just take god damn control and do what they want, then we&#8217;ll have something to compare to along with &#8220;Republican brand&#8221; bipartisanship. We can decide come November 2012 how the brands compare. (Catch that “bringing business to governance” lingo of how to speak civics?)  </p>
<p>We survived the last 4 years, we know where we&#8217;ll be if we keep going as we are (no thanks to our free press), so I say let the Dem&#8217;s pull a republican move: redefine what a tie is, have the Obama&#8217;s legal council write up the unitary vice executive theory and send in Biden to the Senate.</p>
<p>I trust that it will not be worse than what we have now.  And that, &#8220;my friends&#8221; is using our fullest economic power.<br />Almost forgot: Can we please <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/09/can-we-please-broaden-our-thinking-in.html">broaden the discussion now</a>?</p>
<p>Update: Two commentors noted that the tie break may not work as I suggested.  RonE notes there is no need for the 60, just change the rules to a simple majority.  TStockmann notes that we would not get all the Dem&#8217;s to go along.  I assumed the Dems would act tribal if they had someone to lead them, that is what is needed when you are fighting another tribe  You can&#8217;t beat the other tribe by acting all independent thinking virtuous as to the ideal bipartisanship.</p>
<p>But here is where my plan works.   We&#8217;re going to have the unitary vice executive who is president of the Senate just as soon as Obama has his attorney write it up.  Or, maybe Biden should just have his attorney write it up ala Cheney.   Then, he goes in and changes the rules (because he&#8217;s the Unitary Vice Executive President) to a simple majority, we&#8217;re golden.  </p>

                                <p>Brad DeLong has the breakdown of <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2009/02/cutbanks-in-the-fiscal-boost-program.html">things taken out of the no-longer-possible-to-defend-as-stimulating stimulus bill</a>.</p>
<p>Nice to see that no Republican, and precious few Democratic Senators, believe in following even Andrew Samwick&#8217;s <a href="http://capitalgainsandgames.com/blog/andrew-samwick/761/haste-makes-waste">tepid endorsement</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Congress and the Obama Administration should be very discriminating in what they will spend money on.  Bailout money for banks and large firms should go.  Every piece of pork in the stimulus bill should go.  Every additional tax cut should go.  What should remain are the highest value public infrastructure projects, many of which the government has been deferring for years or decades.</p></blockquote>
<p>which is a minor modification of <a href="http://capitalgainsandgames.com/blog/andrew-samwick/749/more-stimulus-silliness">his previous position</a>:<br />
<blockquote>[A]s I will continue to blog until I am blue in the fingers, the appropriate course of action when the economic downturn appears like it will be unusually severe is to bring planned capital projects forward in time.  Doing so allows them to be done more cheaply. </p></blockquote>
<p>This would be especially true of the non-&#8220;highest value&#8221; projects, as an Finance person can tell you. (At 2%, it might have a positive NPV; at 5% and full employment, it will, er, &#8220;crowd out.&#8221;)</p>
