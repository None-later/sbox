<blockquote><p>NEW ORLEANS &#8211; The Captains of the Port for Morgan City, La., New Orleans, La., and Mobile, Ala. , under the authority of the Ports and Waterways Safety Act, has established a 20- meter safety zone surrounding all Deepwater Horizon booming operations and <strong>oil response efforts taking place in Southeast Louisiana</strong>.</p>
<p>Vessels must not come within 20 meters of booming operations, boom, or oil spill response operations under penalty of law. </p>
<p>The safety zone has been put in place to protect members of the response effort, the installation and maintenance of oil containment boom, the operation of response equipment and protection of the environment by limiting access to and through deployed protective boom.</p>
<p>In areas where vessels operators cannot avoid the 20-meter rule, they are required to be cautious of boom and boom operations by transiting at a safe speed and distance.</p>
<p>Violation of a safety zone can result in up to a $40,000 civil penalty. Willful violations may result in a class D felony.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Tax Burdens and Economic Growth – Answering the Objections</strong></p>
<p>This piece is cross-posted with <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=92">the Presimetrics Blog</a>.</p>
<p>Consistent with findings in Presimetrics, the book I wrote with Michael Kanell which will be released in August, I’ve had some posts whose results contradict standard economic theory.  In some cases, readers have insisted that the results must be some sort of anomaly.    Perhaps the biggest offender is a graph which appeared in <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=50">this post</a>.  The graph shows growth rates in real GDP per capita by Presidency, where each President is color coded by whether he increased the tax burden (in this case defined as federal government revenues as a share of GDP) or decreased it:</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TDJ1axWNOnI/AAAAAAAAATQ/xhSkh-vMz9w/s1600/growth1.bmp"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TDJ1axWNOnI/AAAAAAAAATQ/xhSkh-vMz9w/s320/growth1.bmp" border="0" alt=""></a> Figure 1</p>
<p>The graph shows that Presidents who cut the tax burden produced slower growth, on average, than Presidents who increased the tax burden.  For many people, this doesn’t make sense at all.  (An explanation for why these results show up is provided <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=86">here</a>.  Now, I’ve already some of the objections that have been raised to this, mostly in private or in comments at the Angry Bear blog.   In fact, the graph above by itself answers one of the objections – I was told many times that FDR only produced faster growth because the economy accelerated during World War 2.  Thus, the graph only shows FDR’s results through 1938, which avoids the war, the build-up to the war, and even Lend Lease.   </p>
<p>Another criticism is that somehow the fact that I’m assuming that Presidents have an effect on the economy is the problem, and that a better way to do this is to look at the business cycle.  But I’ve had posts looking at the business cycle, and increasing tax burdens doesn’t look all that much better as an economic strategy across the business cycle either.  For instance, consider the following graph, one of several fairly damning graphs I posted <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=3">here</a> and  <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/%EF%BB%BF%EF%BB%BFhttp://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/05/effect-of-tax-cuts-and-tax-hikes-on.html">here</a>:</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TDJ1bZaEnnI/AAAAAAAAATY/kpF73XGTgEw/s1600/growth2.bmp"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TDJ1bZaEnnI/AAAAAAAAATY/kpF73XGTgEw/s320/growth2.bmp" border="0" alt=""></a> Figure 2<br /><a name="more"></a><br />If cutting the tax burdens is the right prescription during a recession, it isn’t evident from the above graph.  </p>
<p>I’ve also been accused of cherry-picking, though I’ve gone as far back as the data allows, and on most posts on this subject, I’ve actually chucked the WW2 years.  In addition, I’ve noted that throwing out outliers doesn’t change results materially.  But what if the last eight decades have all been an anomaly?  After all, shouldn’t we consider the “Roaring ‘20s,” a period which every textbook tells you was a period of rapid growth.  After all, such intellectuals as Glenn Beck, Thomas Woods, and Amity Shlaes are quick to assure that the prosperity of the 1920s was due to tax cuts.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the NIPA tables don’t go that far back, so we don’t have actual data on real GDP per capita (or the tax burden).  But I’ve done my best to examine that claim; the following graph, which first appeared <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/04/1920s-depression-glenn-beck-thomas.html">here</a>, shows the top marginal tax rates and the periods (shown in gray) when the economy was in recession.  </p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TDJ1b1038EI/AAAAAAAAATg/eAv_UNhbx9A/s1600/growth3.bmp"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TDJ1b1038EI/AAAAAAAAATg/eAv_UNhbx9A/s320/growth3.bmp" border="0" alt=""></a>Figure 3</p>
<p>While the 1920s was, indeed, a period when marginal tax rates were reduced, it was a period of recession followed by recession followed by recession followed by the Great Depression.   The longest consecutive months spent outside of recession during the 1920s was 27 months!  Two years and a quarter.   In fact, the economy was in recession (if not outright Depression) a full 44% of the time during the 1920s.  If these were roaring years, those roars were extremely short-lived.   </p>
<p>Which moves us to the next issue – I’ve been criticized for focusing on the tax burden rather than the marginal tax rate, the exception being in periods where the tax burden is not available.   Frankly, of all the criticisms, that one seems especially weak.  For those with enough income, the marginal tax rate is as much a fiction as the MSRP on a car; Warren Buffett’s offer of $1 million dollars to anyone on the Forbes 400 list who could prove they pay a higher share of their income in taxes than their secretary remains untaken.  </p>
<p>Moving on to the next criticism…   I’ve been told my interpretation of the above graph is wrong – it is not so much that higher tax burdens are correlated with faster economic growth, but rather that administrations that produced rapid economic growth tended to feel they could raise tax burdens, and that administrations suffering from poor growth kept tax burdens low to try to remedy a bad situation.</p>
<p>I dealt with that issue in recent posts by grouping the periods from 1929 to the present into eight year administrations, where possible.  Those administrations were made up of the eight year terms of Presidents who served two terms (or in FDR’s case, the first two terms only).  Added to those were eight year periods in which a Vice Presidents took over for a President who died or otherwise left office.  For each of those eight year terms, I created <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=60">the following graph </a>.  It shows the change in the tax burden in the first two years of each administration along one axis, and economic growth on the other axis:</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TDJ2MxHT8UI/AAAAAAAAATo/k03X9X7UJJ8/s1600/growth4.bmp"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TDJ2MxHT8UI/AAAAAAAAATo/k03X9X7UJJ8/s320/growth4.bmp" border="0" alt=""></a>Figure 4</p>
<p>Clearly, economic growth in years 3 through 8 cannot explain changes in the tax burden in earlier years unless one assumes time travel, clairvoyance, or one heck of a coincidence.</p>
<p>And speaking of coincidence, we arrive at another common complaint:  there simply are not enough observations to reach a conclusion of any sort.  Left unstated, of course, is that though the tax cutting Presidents had the lousiest economies, and that (as per graph 4) tax cutting led the economic growth, somehow a supposed lack observations validates the idea that lower taxes does produce faster economic growth.</p>
<p>Now, those who complain about the lack of observations generally insist that a) I don’t know the first thing about statistics and b) you need 30 or more observations to reach a conclusion.     Now that critique dates back at least three years, having been made by an anonymous blogger for the Economist who I understand is now known as Megan McArdle, and my answer (to point b.) back then is as good of an answer as any:</p>
<blockquote><p>Which is what degrees of freedom are for… Maybe there&#8217;s something wrong with the textbooks on my shelf, but the t distribution tables in the back of those textbooks have as few as 1 (one) degree of freedom. When the degrees of freedom are low, the t-statistics has to be really high in order in to reject H0. Or something like that – what do I know? </p></blockquote>
<p>Allow me to explain.  If there are a large enough number of observations to work with, it is possible to find a statistically significant difference between two things (events, peoples, outcomes, whatever) that at first glance or from a distance look very similar to the unaided eye.  However, if there are a very small number of observations, then differences have to be larger and more obvious for them to be statistically significant.   Consider three medications to extend the lives of patients with a specific type of cancer, where two have obtained FDA certification and the third was cooked up by the creepy guy who lives two houses down and uses cat puke as an active ingredient.  It might take hundreds of observations to tell which of the first two medications is more effective, but it shouldn’t take very many to tell how well the third one compares.  </p>
<p>And while in the past I sometimes decided to answer this question by running a t-test or some non-parametric test, it always seems to lead to questions about the assumptions by people who clearly never ran a hypothesis test in their lives but have one or another political point to defend to the death.  So let me try something else – an argument by analogy.  Consider the graph below.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TDJ2NM-TzLI/AAAAAAAAATw/W7PBSs8LLcM/s1600/growth5.bmp"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TDJ2NM-TzLI/AAAAAAAAATw/W7PBSs8LLcM/s320/growth5.bmp" border="0" alt=""></a>Figure 5</p>
<p>If such a graph came from a study comparing outcomes of medications, where patients were assigned a medication but otherwise told to go about their daily business, there’d be no argument that, at least as a first approximation, there’s no reason whatsoever to assume that Medication 2 was more efficacious than Medication 1.  And if the disease in question was a particularly rare one, and the graph above represented the testing performed on every known sufferer since 1929, most of us would be appalled if a doctor decided to treat the next sufferer with Medication 2.  At the very least, we would assume that the burden of proof going forward should lie not with the proponents of Medication 1 but rather with the supporters of Medication 2, whether we understood the mechanisms by which either of these pharmaceuticals worked (or purported to work) or not.</p>
<p>And yet, this graph is identical to Figure 1, except that I changed the title and some labeling.  </p>
<p>But there is another problem with the small sample objection.  See, there are many ways to test whether there has been a negative correlation between tax burdens and economic growth, and looking at the national economy is only one of those ways.  I’ve also had a number of posts at the Angry Bear blog looking at how states have fared over the years, and there are 50 of those.  In fact, that was the topic of <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2006/08/state-tax-burdens-and-growth-rates.html">the first post I ever wrote</a> four years ago next month.  In that post, a comparison of the states, using data from 1990 to 2005 yielded the following conclusion:</p>
<blockquote><p>Thus, the data doesn’t seem to support the idea that lower taxes are associated with faster growth rates. In fact, the opposite is true, especially for the fastest growing states. One way to interpret this is to conclude that taxes are actually below their optimal rates, and therefore, at the margin, the government is actually more efficient than individuals at converting its spending into growth. Society needs a certain amount of public goods (infrastructure, public health, confronting the Canadian menace, etc.) for businesses to thrive, and perhaps we currently have too little provision of public goods rather than too much. </p></blockquote>
<p>And the other posts I’ve had using similar state level data have all led to the same findings.</p>
<p>Another problem frequently brought up is that growth is too complicated to be explained by a single variable.  We agree, and in the book, we actually provide a model that uses several variables.  But be that as it may, it isn’t reasonable to state that while cutting tax burdens produces faster economic growth, that effect gets swamped by opposing forces when you look at the data systematically, whether you’re looking at the performance of Presidents, at the growth during business cycles, or the performance of states.  Clearly, if reducing the amount that people pay in taxes is so beneficial to the economy, somewhere that effect would show up.  It shouldn’t be overwhelmed by other variables pushing in the opposite direction every time one tried to test it systematically and consistently.</p>
<p>Moving on, we have another little gem – that the performance of the two regimes (tax cutters and tax hikers) is not independent.  The argument is this:  tax hikers do well because they follow tax cutters who laid the foundation for growth.  Tax cutters do poorly because they have the misfortune of following tax hikers who set up the economy for a fall.  </p>
<p>This one is particularly easy to hit out of the park.  First, note that there is only one tax hiker that is followed by another tax hiker:  LBJ followed JFK.  And LBJ produced the second fastest growth in our sample, which is to say that simply following a tax hiker is no guarantee of poor performance. </p>
<p>Now, look what happens when you consider only Presidents that followed their tax burden cutting peers:</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TDJ2NiTfaBI/AAAAAAAAAT4/v3rI9doNIdE/s1600/growth6.bmp"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TDJ2NiTfaBI/AAAAAAAAAT4/v3rI9doNIdE/s320/growth6.bmp" border="0" alt=""></a>Figure 6</p>
<p>Notice that following a tax cutting President doesn’t mean one will turn in a poor performance… unless one is also a tax cutting President.  In fact, tax cutting Presidents that followed other tax cutting Presidents did worse than tax cutting Presidents who followed tax hikers.  Imagine that.  It’s almost as if the longer tax burdens are cut, the worse the outcome.  </p>
<p>And yes, I included Hoover in the above graph though we don’t have the data to know with certainty that his predecessor, Calvin Coolidge cut the burden since Coolidge is renown as a small government guy.  But leave out Hoover, and leave out Obama’s first year, and you still aren’t left with anything other than:  In fact, tax cutting Presidents that followed other tax cutting Presidents did worse than tax cutting Presidents who followed tax hikers.</p>
<p>Which leads to the sorriest objection I’ve heard, namely that the American public, the constantly gulled American public, has the ability to reason out the outcome of economic policies on the macroeconomy to near-perfection, at least in 4 year increments.  And the way it manifests itself here is this:  when the economy is about to sour, we elect tax cutters, who, in turn, manage to limit the scale of the impending disaster.  </p>
<p>This, ahem, theory (gurgle, choke) is the efficient market hypothesis on LSD.  But it has the advantage of being able to explain pretty much anything.  The problem is that it does so by breaking everything down to utter nonsense.  For instance, it would indicate that the recent housing bubble and economic meltdown, rather than being a surprise, was actually anticipated on some unconscious level by the American public, and selected for as being much better than the alternative.  Ditto the Great Depression.  So what was this worse thing that was avoided?  Locusts?  Famine and pestilence?  Billions of furious yetis descending on us from their Himalayan stronghold?  </p>
<p>And yet, despite the fact that this story makes a virtue out of nonsense, it still isn’t internally consistent.  For instance, if the American public understood that only a series of tax cuts were going to save us from something worse than the Great Recession, then wouldn’t GW have managed to have won the popular vote in 2000 and achieved a landslide in 2004.  Conversely, does the fact GW received fewer votes than Al Gore indicate that perhaps the American public did not perceive that really big threat a few years in the future?  It’s easy to knock down a story that is built on nonsense.</p>
<p>All of which brings us back to the point of this post.  Michael Kanell and I have noted that lower tax burdens are not correlated with more rapid economic growth.  In fact, from 1929 to the present (and in the book, we focus on the period from 1952 to the present) administrations that have cut the tax burden have performed worse than administrations that raised the tax burden.</p>
<p>And I think we, together and separately, have answered every reasonable objection that has come up, and even quite a few unreasonable objections to boot.  And we’ve done so in a consistent and open manner.  In our book and in my posts, we’ve been open and clear about our methods and data sources, and we’ve made an effort to treat the data as consistently and systematically as we were able.  At some point, the burden of proof should no longer lie with us, but rather on those who cling to a story that simply is not consistent with the data we have observed in the U.S. over the past few decades.  Frankly, I think we’re well past that point.</p>

                                <p>and nobody notices, did it really disappear?</p>
<p>by Bruce Webb</p>
<p>I started reading the Annual Report of the Trustees of Social Security in 1997 and awaited its typical March 31st release date each year since with eager anticipation. To the point that last year I put up a post that morning called <a target="_blank" href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2009/03/bestest-day-of-year-ssrr-day.html">Bestest Day of the Year: SSRR Day</a> where &#8216;SSRR&#8217; stood for &#8216;Social Security Report Release&#8217;. Well people mocked, and rightfully so, because SSRR Day 2009 didn&#8217;t happen until May 1st. The delay, though not quite explained, was explicable, on typical SSRR Day only two of six Trustees was actually confirmed.</p>
<p>Well flash forward to 2010. A year older and perhaps a little wiser, and wary from being pwned the year before I put up the following post on Mar 21 heralding the impending release: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/03/upcoming-attractions-in-social-security.html">Upcoming Attractions in Social Security</a>, putting it in the context of the new Obama Deficits Commission while warning that the 2009 Report had been delayed. Well a helpful informant advised me that the word was that it would be delayed until April, and then on April 5th it was announced widely that Report Release would be June 30th. Oddly none of this was official, the news just got out in typical Beltway fashion.</p>
<p>Come mid June I started referencing the new, new updated release date only to be notified by three different knowledgeable sources that word was out that Report Release would be delayed yet again, perhaps until August. And just like with the 2009 Report the explanations advanced were not unreasonable. But none of them were official, to my knowledge no one has at any point officially announced even the fact that the Report would be delayed (and delayed and delayed) beyond its statutory release date, and still less given an official explanation.</p>
<p>I find this odd in the extreme, particularly since Social Security is front and center in the news with the ongoing meetings of the Catfood Commission with their strong suggestions that cuts to Social Security are definitely on the table. You would think that repeated delays in the release of this key Report would at least require SOME explanation and that someone in the media might be asking questions. But no like the proverbial tree falling in the forest no one was close enough to hear the sound. If any. Well the silence is deafening. The lead press item on the Social Security website is the news that Isabella is the number one name for baby girls this year. http://www.ssa.gov/ Which I guess is fascinating news for fans of the Twilight franchise but not quite satisfying for us data driven types.</p>
<p>When the Report does come out it will appear on the following page: http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/index.html (and interestingly the page was updated this weekend to include &#8216;2010&#8217; as a choice for &#8216;Publication Year&#8217;. As of this moment neither clicking on the Summary or total Report button gets you to anything, but the fact that the page was changed at all is fascinating Certainly I&#8217;ll be checking back regularly.) But the delay still remains inexplicable.</p>

<blockquote><p>I had suggested that if you can&#8217;t pay cash for your next car, you should make a down payment of at least 20%, finance the balance for four years or less and make sure the resulting payment is no more than 10% of your gross income.</p>
<p>[One]&#8230;reader did the math and sputtered, but that means the typical American family can&#8217;t afford the typical new car!</p>
<p>Someone who purchased a new car last year, when the average price was $28,966 according to the National Automobile Dealers Association, would have needed a household income of nearly $65,000 to swing a purchase under my formula. That assumes a 5.75% interest rate, which <em>Edmunds.com</em> says was the average paid by buyers who financed new cars in 2009. The latest statistics from the Census Bureau show median household income was about $50,000 in 2008. &#8220;Median&#8221; means half of all U.S. households earned less. </p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>Then Harvard bankruptcy professor Elizabeth Warren (now on loan to the Obama administration to lead the congressional oversight panel for the Troubled Asset Relief Program) and her daughter Amelia Warren Tyagi wrote a terrific book called <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mdmproofing.com/iym/reviews/review014.html">All Your Worth: The Ultimate Lifetime Money Plan</a></p></blockquote>
<p>You can play with your own numbers <a target="_blank" href="http://articles.moneycentral.msn.com/SavingandDebt/LearnToBudget/50-30-20-budget.aspx">here</a>.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.edmunds.com/apps/calc/CalculatorController?pmtcalAction=affordability&#038;tid=edmunds..calculators.afford_tab.afford.tab_link..*">Edmunds</a> has an &#8216;affordability&#8217; calculator that allows a buyer to work the numbers from a different angle&#8230;with similar results for a total price range affordability. Using &#8220;$4000 less $600 car insurance and $1000 maintenance = $3600/yr&#8221; is about $300/month at 4.1% (a quick call to Triple A) for 48 months equals a car from $13,600 to $16,300 tops.</p>
<p>Ouch.</p>

<p>On Conservatism.<br />Modern Conservatism = Protection of Property Rights.</p>
<p>The historical process in Northern Europe and Britain from the mid 17th through the 19th century was marked by a sometimes gradual, sometimes violent collapse in belief in the Divine Right of Kings, and for that matter Popes. Conservatism replaced its traditional appeal to Authority with a claim to absolute right to Property. Discuss.</p>
<p>On Classical Economics.<br /> Economics (which as a discipline developed in parallel in time and place with Modern Conservatism) foundationally assumes that Homo Oeconomicus is psychologically motivated by Accumulation and not Consumption/Display. Discuss.<br />____________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>I maintain that a lot of what is baffling in Conservatism to those of us whose thinking derives from Liberal Enlightenment&#8217;s elevation of The People to primacy, can be explained by a combination of these two arguments. How do you logically combine Liberty and Patriarchy? Why is debt as a result of war acceptable, while debt as a result of social spending not? Why assume that tax cuts will in all cases increase reinvestment? These questions which seem to come from all over the field all can be answered and made inter-consistent by appeal to the two stated arguments.</p>
<p>The results are almost by definition unacceptable to the liberal imagination, and those of a moral bent might use harsher terms than &#8216;unacceptable&#8217;, but that doesn&#8217;t mean they are irrational.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll advance some specific arguments and conclusions in comments. For now consider this an open thread on the historical and psychological foundations of conservatism, or if you like of liberalism.</p>

                                <p>We actually appeared to have forgotten we are a nation &#8220;at war&#8221; if news reporting is any indication from a personal search, except for the DC centered coverage of Gen. McChrystal.  Notice it was a music magazine that got the scoop, more power to them, not mainstream media.  </p>
<p>Here are some thoughts from <a target="blank" href="http://www.tomdispatch.com/archive/175269/">Tomdispatch</a> to remind us of the dark side of our history in the Middle East.  Follow the link for more.</p>
<blockquote><p>Doesn’t it seem, sometimes, that American history, the “people’s history,” is actually made by about 17 giant government and corporate entities, all hopelessly intertwined &#8212; and worse yet, that they never go away?  On Tuesday, TomDispatch posted Stephen Kinzer’s piece, “<a href="http://www.tomdispatch.com/archive/175267/stephan_kinzer_BP_in_the_Gulf" target="_blank">BP in the Gulf &#8212; The Persian Gulf</a>.”  It was a reminder that, more than half a century ago (when it was called the Anglo-Persian Oil Company), the giant oil corporation now despoiling the Gulf of Mexico had, in quite a different way, despoiled Iranian democracy to maintain its hold on that country’s oil.  It did so in conjunction with the Central Intelligence Agency, which, in 1953, overthrew a democratic Iranian government eager to nationalize that oil.</p>
<p>Well, neither of them has gone away.  That’s obvious enough.  Last week, the CIA popped up again, this time in conjunction with another of its favorite corporations, the infamous rent-a-gun company formerly known as Blackwater, now Xe Services.  The Agency has given that for-profit warrior outfit a new <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/06/23/AR2010062305255.html" target="_blank">$100 million contract</a> to guard its various outposts in Afghanistan “and elsewhere”&#8230;<br />&#8230;</p>
<p>Worse yet, the CIA wasn’t alone, as the State Department just agreed to shell out $120,123,293 in taxpayer dough to a unit of Xe to pay for guarding some of its facilities in Afghanistan.  (The awarding of this contract, reports CBS News which broke the story, comes barely &#8220;four months after the government of Iraq ordered hundreds of Blackwater-linked security guards to leave the country within seven days or face possible arrest.”)</p></blockquote>

<p>In response to my Pelosi Rule post of yesterday commenter Darms plays Devil&#8217;s Advocate in asking the following shrewd question.<br />
<blockquote>Bruce,    Since the commision may be looking for a mechanism to delay redemption of those SS trust fund bonds and I&#8217;ve read that some of these bonds are routinely redeemed &#038; renewed each year, would that not provide those on the commission with an excuse to cut SS funding now even though the actual problem is not until 2030 or beyond? In contrast to your thesis above? Possible quote come December &#8211; &#8220;Yes, we know the problem w/SS funding won&#8217;t be upon us for decades but we have to defund SS now as paying off this year&#8217;s (&#038; next thru 2015&#8217;s) maturing SS trust fund bonds is pushing this deficit to unmanageable levels!!! You lame ducks have to support this NNOOOWWWWW!!!!! Thanx Nancy!&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p> Well the answer is that &#8220;They will try, unfortunately budget scoring rules totally undercut their argument&#8221;.</p>
<p>To see why this should be we need to revisit the concepts of &#8216;debt&#8217; and &#8216;deficit&#8217; as they relate to Social Security reporting and CBO deficit scoring, the numbers just don&#8217;t move in the way you think they would. Discussion under the fold.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />We start with the Social Security Trust Funds (there are two, more on that later). Currently the combined OASDI Trust Fund holds $2.5 trillion in Special Treasuries. These make up the majority of the $4.5 trillion in &#8216;Intragovernmental Holdings&#8217; which in turn are scored as a portion of total &#8216;Public Debt&#8217;. The latter needs to be distinguished from &#8216;Debt Held by the Public&#8217; which is all Treasury debt held by entities other than the Treasury itself. The balances of Debt Held by the Public, Intragovernmental Holdings, and total Public Debt can be checked at the Treasury&#8217;s handy Debt to the Penny web application: http://www.treasurydirect.gov/NP/BPDLogin?application=np . As of close of business Thurs these were $8.6 tn, $4.5 tn for a total of $13.1 tn. So for this purpose the Trust Fund Balances for Treasury score as part of Public Debt.</p>
<p>But seen from the perspective of CBO and OMB those balances are simply the sum of a set of SURPLUSES since 1983, in each of those years the increase in Trust Fund assets, scoring as a debt to Treasury, scores for budget purposes as a REDUCTION to the deficit.</p>
<p>Back to the Trust Funds. Contrary to the belief of some the Special Treasuries in the Trust Funds have specific rates and maturities, if the funds they represent are not needed to meet cost they are rolled over. Since neither the maturing bond nor its replacement actually has to be financed out of the public market, principal redemption results in no  change to either debt or deficit. Interest is a little different. Interest accruing to the current TF balances that is not needed to meet current cost is credited to the TF in the form of new Special Treasuries. These add to Intragovernmental Holdings and so are scored as in increase in Public Debt to Treasury.</p>
<p>But the Treasury Secretary is also ex officio the Managing Trustee of Social Security, and while he is wearing that hat that same increase in debt scores as an increase in assets to Social Security, and in an odd twist score the same way at CBO, interest on the TF is added to any cash surpluses from taxation to make up total Social Security &#8216;surplus&#8217; which is then deducted from any General Fund deficits to generate the top level number we generally recognize as &#8216;the deficit&#8217; (as in Obama is on track for a $1.5 tn deficit in 2010).</p>
<p>Lets pause for a second, because this is totally counter-intuitive. How can interest transformed into Special Treasuries but not actually financed from public markets ever be considered an offset from real world cash deficits? What happens if Social Security goes cash flow negative as revenue from taxes dips below total costs and a portion of interest has to be paid from the General Fund in cash? Are you telling me that the remaining interest STILL counts as surplus for the top line deficit number!??</p>
<p>Yep. And we won&#8217;t even get into how it is treated by OMB for Budget purposes.</p>
<p>Which gets us most of the way towards answering Darms Devil&#8217;s Advocacy. First if Social Security is in overall surplus, meaning all income INCLUDING interest is in excess of costs, there is no effect on either debt or deficit to roll over TF principal, that is a wash. In this scenario any excess interest scores as new debt to the Bureau of Public Debt but as a surplus to both Social Security AND CBO, it serves to reduce deficits and not increase them.</p>
<p>Although combined Social Security projects to be in a state of &#8216;surplus/primary deficit&#8217; in 2010 and 2011 with receipts from taxation failing to meet cost and a portion of TF interest having to be paid in cash, it will still be showing up in CBO scoring as a surplus on the top line number. And it is actually projected to return to &#8216;surplus/primary surplus&#8217; from 2012 to 2017. Meaning that in 2015 Social Security will neither in accounting terms or in actual cash flow be contributing to the deficit at all, in fact it will still be offsetting it.</p>
<p>Now in theory the Commission could act to increase this offset by slashing current benefits between now and 2015, that would serve to boost TF balances and yearly surpluses, that is increasing debt while cutting deficits, but there are no proposals on the table to actually do so, even Alan Simpson, currently taking the hardest public line would exempt workers 60 and older from any near term benefit cuts, meaning no savings until at least 2017, and most other proposals out there would not effect at least initial benefits for workers 55 and older (viz Ryan Roadmap) meaning no top line savings until 2022.</p>
<p>The Commission can enact changes to Social Security benefit ratios that limit its share of GDP and also the dollar amount of its so-called &#8216;unfunded liability&#8217; over the 75 year window. What they can&#8217;t do is make changes that will help them achieve their mandate of reducing the deficit to 3% of GDP by 2015, at least under CBO scoring rules.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/TC96XnP3o4I/AAAAAAAABOs/9Dj35HmcKqQ/s1600/Clipboard01-cbo.bmp"><br /></a>CoRev  asks if anyone wants to discuss the justifications of the beneficiaries of the different parties policies.  So I though this gives me an opportunity to present some recently published<br />CBO data  on income and tax that could give people something to tie the discussion to.</p>
<p>Republican policy has been to favor the more affluent in our society and justifies it with the claim that increasing the wealth and/or income of the &#8220;investor class&#8221; will make everyone better off &#8212; a rising tide lifts all boats.  If this worked I would strongly support such policies.</p>
<p>But look at what this data shows has happened between 1979 and 2007.  This is a good set of dates for comparisons because it is essentially a peak to peak comparison from just prior to the 1980-1982 double recession and the current recession.  Moreover, it is an era dominated by the Republican policy of tax cutting and the investment boom of the 1990.</p>
<p>First, as everyone knows this has been an era of a great surge of income inequality driven both by natural economic forces &#8212; the winner take all economy &#8212;  and tax policy.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/TC93YRYaZmI/AAAAAAAABN8/my6qS56aZHY/s1600/Clipboard01.bmp"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/TC93YRYaZmI/AAAAAAAABN8/my6qS56aZHY/s320/Clipboard01.bmp" alt="" border="0"></a>The net product of this 30 year era was a shift of about ten percentage points of the economic pie from the bottom four quintiles to the top quintile.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/TC93oXmmIDI/AAAAAAAABOE/BYY7qqLu0SI/s1600/Clipboard02.bmp"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/TC93oXmmIDI/AAAAAAAABOE/BYY7qqLu0SI/s320/Clipboard02.bmp" alt="" border="0"></a><br />This shift in the share of income share by the top quintile has also generated a significant<br />increase in the share of taxes paid by the top quintile.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/TC94M1IAyyI/AAAAAAAABOU/y0M8zTLl_KM/s1600/Clipboard03.bmp"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/TC94M1IAyyI/AAAAAAAABOU/y0M8zTLl_KM/s320/Clipboard03.bmp" alt="" border="0"></a><br />But the shift in the distribution of the tax burden is due entirely to the growth in income<br />rather than a shift in tax policy as the average effective tax rate paid by each quintile has fallen. Actually, on a proportional basis the lowest quintile had the largest drop in its tax burden.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/TC94cs3hBzI/AAAAAAAABOc/6YjPhyeFkVw/s1600/Clipboard04.bmp"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/TC94cs3hBzI/AAAAAAAABOc/6YjPhyeFkVw/s320/Clipboard04.bmp" alt="" border="0"></a><br />The federal tax burden is quite progressive as the last chart shows.  But in general state and local taxes such as sales taxes and property taxes are much more regressive, so the total tax burden is much less progressive than this chart implies.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/TC96XnP3o4I/AAAAAAAABOs/9Dj35HmcKqQ/s1600/Clipboard01-cbo.bmp"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/TC96XnP3o4I/AAAAAAAABOs/9Dj35HmcKqQ/s320/Clipboard01-cbo.bmp" alt="" border="0"></a></p>
<p>If this shift in income to the top quintile had generated the increase in savings and investment and generated widely shared prosperity it would be a good thing, and the<br />greater income inequality would be a fair trade-off for greater growth.</p>
<p>But the actual results since the early 1980s has been a significant slowing of economic growth  and a drop in private savings&#8211; just the opposite of what republicans and economic theory says would happen.  Rather the results has been that since the early 1980s the US has increasingly lived beyond it means and ran up a major foreign debt to finance this consumption binge.  The two major drives behind this shift in the US has been the Reagan and Bush tax cuts.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;ll take on CoRev and argue that the reason I oppose Republican policies is that they have been a complete and utter failure to deliver the results they promise.  They have just ran up a massive foreign debt to finance our living beyond our means and now blame Obama because he has failed to reverse the adverse impact of the failed republican policies.</p>
<p>Supporting the republican &#8220;starve the beast&#8221; strategy reminds me of the comment I use to make back in the early 1970s that if Arthur Burns &#8212; the Fed Chairman &#8212; was a friend of business, business did not need any enemies.<br /><a name="more"></a></p>

                                <p>by Bruce Webb</p>
<p>There is a huge disturbance in the Force, at least as sensed by the Jedi of FireDogLake, Democratic Underground, AMERICAblog, and OpenLeft, which is to say among the Obama-skeptics of the Left. The substance is this, in a last minute move prior to adjournment Nancy Pelosi pushed through the rule for handling the recommendations of the Obama Deficit Commission, and on the surface they mirror that of Cooper-Wolff or its Senate counterpart Conrad-Gregg, that any recommendations coming out of the Deficit Commission has to be voted up or down without amendments. The actual language is here:<br />
<blockquote>“Commits the House to vote on any Senate-passed recommendations of the bipartisan Fiscal Commission and that net savings from any Commission recommendations will go to deficit reduction.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Meaning on the FDL reading that any Commission proposal focusing heavily on Social Security benefit cuts can simply sail through with Republican and Blue Dog support. Simple sell-out right? Well maybe. But whatever the intent of the players, including Pelosi, the effect might be much different. Because despite strong and deliberate similarities the Obama Deficit Commission is NOT the same as either Cooper-Wolff or Conrad-Gregg. Argument below the fold.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />The entire Peter G Peterson backed argument as manifested in both Cooper-Wolff and Conrad-Gregg is that the major threat to the economy going forward is long-term deficits, that the major cause of those deficits are projected to be entitlements, and that the only solution is major cuts to those benefits. In this vision the disease and the medicine are determined beforehand and the whole purpose of the Commissions is to give bi-partisan cover backed up by a requirement that any proposal coming out of such a Commission is subject to an non-amendable up or down vote. And if this vision was still controlling the entire debate then this would look like total surrender by Pelosi. But I argue that it isn&#8217;t, that the Obama Commission was formally given a much different mission, and one that in the end conflicts and subverts that of  PGP.</p>
<p>The main impetus for the Obama Commission was not the structural long-term deficits seen as the result of &#8216;unsustainable&#8217; entitlements, instead it was the very large, as in more than a trillion a year, deficits starting with FY 2009 as a result of the worldwide economic crisis, that is the crisis is not defined as intergenerational but instead in the here and now with the main expressed fear is that without action the Invisible Bond Vigilantes and the Chinese Central Bank will stop buying our debt. Well I&#8217;ll leave that bigger argument to Prof K, the result was that the Obama Commission was given a specific charter, that of getting the deficit down to 3% of GDP by 2015. And the problem in a nutshell is that you can&#8217;t get there via benefit cuts to Social Security, one because Social Security is not actually projected to contribute to the deficit over that time period and two because even the most draconian proposals don&#8217;t start operating by then.</p>
<p>It has been an accepted principle since the Leninist Strategy of 1983 that benefit cuts shouldn&#8217;t come at the expense of people in or nearing retirement, a principle that was also the first one listed by Bush&#8217;s CSSS (Commission to Strengthen Social Security) in 2001, and followed by the various proposals fronted by Alan Simpson, the Ryan Roadmap, and even Michelle Bachmann. Each would give varying periods of grace ranging from seven years (Simpson) to not effecting people over 55 (Ryan Roadmap) to as much as 20 years. But what all share in common is that none of them show any savings under CBO scoring prior to the mandated target of 2015, they simply CAN&#8217;T bend the short term deficit path.</p>
<p>It is not clear that any of PGP, the Obama Commission, or Speaker Pelosi quite get this because the whole argument has been framed in terms set by the Social Security and Medicare Trustees where the score is generally expressed over the 75 year actuarial window, or since 2003 over the Infinite Future Horizon. Under those long-term scoring windows new revenues or benefit cuts get scored in the current year even if the actual incidence of the tax increase or benefit cut doesn&#8217;t occur for years or even decades. Well all of that is fine in its own place but it doesn&#8217;t cut any ice when it comes to projected deficits in 2015, when CBO scores whatever recommendations come out of the Commission, 2015 won&#8217;t (or shouldn&#8217;t) get credit for savings that won&#8217;t be seen until 2030 and later. Now the argument can and will be made that future cuts add current confidence to those nervous (but as yet invisible) Bond Vigilantes, but at most the real effects in 2015 could only be seen in lower interest rates, and those rates are rock bottom now.</p>
<p>How does this play out in practice? Assume the worst, that the real intent of the Catfood Commission is to slash entitlements and particularly Social Security, the question is whether they can present a package that does that yet doesn&#8217;t do anything for 2015&#8217;s bottom line? Can they get away with putting forth a &#8216;deficit reduction&#8217; proposal that under CBO scoring doesn&#8217;t actually lower the deficit by 2015 or within the standard 10 year scoring window? Well I don&#8217;t see that they can, not without revealing their true colors. And this is where the Pelosi Rule might actually work to protect Social Security.</p>
<p>Cooper-Wolf and Conrad-Gregg were both to be established pretty much openly as &#8216;Entitlements Commissions&#8217; along the lines of the 1994 Kerrey-Danforth &#8216;Entitlement and Tax Reform Commission&#8217; http://www.ssa.gov/history/reports/KerreyDanforth/KerreyDanforth.htm , a package entirely focused on entitlements would not only not be surprising but expected giving the framing. But the Obama Commission has a different framing, that of near term deficits, requiring a different approach, the Commission has to at least present some measures that will actually address their charter of reducing the 2015 deficit. Which means revenue enhancements and spending restraint OUTSIDE of Social Security. (Or just biting the bullet and cutting current SS benefits, something most concede would be political suicide). Now the examples of the Stimulus and HCR Bills tells us how this could work, the Commission introduces a balanced proposal of short and long term revenue increases and cuts with a focus on both 2015 and 2083 and that proposal gets whittled down bit by bit ostensibly to gain the votes of Conservadems and Blue Dogs, but really just to eliminate any tax increases or defense cuts leaving only entitlement &#8216;reform&#8217; intact. The Pelosi Rule, by intent or not, prevents that whittling process.</p>
<p>Seen in this light Pelosi would be simply calling the Blue Dogs bluff, is it really about deficit reduction? or about slicing away at the social safety net?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t believe the Commission can get away with a package that only slashes future entitlement payments but does nothing about near term deficits, it would just be too raw in light of their mandate. Yet the more cover they add in the way of truly bi-partisan measures to increase revenue and cut discretionary spending, including military, the more support will bleed from Conservadems and Blue Dogs, to say nothing of Republicans, while Progressives are not going to jump on board an entitlements cut only program. Where they might have gotten away with a straight out Entitlements Commission whose focus was on 75 year and Infinite Future savings, they are handcuffed by a 2015 target and attendant CBO scoring.</p>
<p>My opinion anyway. For anyone else, well that is what comments are for.</p>
