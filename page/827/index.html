                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>So the President intervened and commuted Scooter Libby&#8217;s sentence. The official White House statement is <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2007/07/20070702-3.html">here</a> and includes these paragraphs:</p>
<blockquote><p>Mr. Libby was sentenced to thirty months of prison, two years of probation, and a $250,000 fine. In making the sentencing decision, the district court rejected the advice of the probation office, which recommended a lesser sentence and the consideration of factors that could have led to a sentence of home confinement or probation. </p>
<p>I respect the jury&#8217;s verdict. But I have concluded that the prison sentence given to Mr. Libby is excessive. Therefore, I am commuting the portion of Mr. Libby&#8217;s sentence that required him to spend thirty months in prison. </p>
<p>My decision to commute his prison sentence leaves in place a harsh punishment for Mr. Libby. The reputation he gained through his years of public service and professional work in the legal community is forever damaged. His wife and young children have also suffered immensely. He will remain on probation. The significant fines imposed by the judge will remain in effect. The consequences of his felony conviction on his former life as a lawyer, public servant, and private citizen will be long-lasting. </p></blockquote>
<p>Here&#8217;s what I think:<br />1. His reputation is not &#8220;forever damaged&#8221; &#8211; at least not among the folks on the Right. They don&#8217;t think he did anything wrong. Otherwise, they wouldn&#8217;t have been pushing so hard for a pardon. <br />2. As a result of 1., friendly Republicans will pay his fine. Not directly, of course&#8230; they&#8217;ll pay him a big speaking fee for a few engagements. <br />3. Nobody will pay any price for burning Plame, and everyone else associated with the same cover agency&#8230; regardless of the cost to the taxpayer. Well&#8230; I guess if the conviction holds, Scooter isn&#8217;t going to be able to open a bar that serves alcohol, at least until another Republican President sees fit to give him a full pardon. <br />4. And I wonder what message this gives to other administration folks thinking of perjuring themselves. </p>
<p>And then I have one more thought&#8230; isn&#8217;t this argument, in effect, saying that child molesters shouldn&#8217;t have to serve time in jail? After all&#8230; someone convicted of child molestation really, truly has their reputation shredded into tatters, and as we learned from Mr. Bush, a fine, probation, and a damaged reputation constitute &#8220;harsh punishment.&#8221;</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.tpmcafe.com/blog/coffeehouse/2007/jul/02/predicting_with_a_handicap_why_are_economists_predictions_so_often_wrong">Jared Bernstein</a> extends on the answer “to make the weatherman look good”:</p>
<blockquote><p>The piece in the Times got me thinking about this question of why members of my profession are competing with weathermen for accuracy kudos. So let me count the ways: here’s a list of reasons I think economists often get it wrong.</p></blockquote>
<p>Jared was referring to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/02/opinion/02schwartz.html?_r=2&#038;oref=slogin&#038;oref=slogin">this piece</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The assumption that underlies the project is simple: people respond to incentives. If you want people to do something, you have to make it worth their while. This assumption drives virtually all of economic theory. Sure, there are already many rewards in learning: gaining understanding (of yourself and others), having mysterious or unfamiliar aspects of the world opened up to you, demonstrating mastery, satisfying curiosity, inhabiting imaginary worlds created by others, and so on. Learning is also the route to more prosaic rewards, like getting into good colleges and getting good jobs. But these rewards are not doing the job. If they were, children would be doing better in school.  The logic of the plan reveals a second assumption that economists make: the more motives the better. Give people two reasons to do something, the thinking goes, and they will be more likely to do it, and they’ll do it better, than if they have only one. Providing some cash won’t disturb the other rewards of learning, rewards that are intrinsic to the process itself. They will only provide a little boost. Mr. Fryer’s reward scheme is intended to add incentives to the ones that already exist. Unfortunately, these assumptions that economists make about human motivation, though intuitive and straightforward, are false. In particular, the idea that adding motives always helps is false. There are circumstances in which adding an incentive competes with other motives and diminishes their impact. Psychologists have known this for more than 30 years.</p></blockquote>
<p>Jared adds four other pieces of baggage that we often carry around with us when we try to forecase the future:</p>
<blockquote><p>There are other things economists do well. Our empirical methods, in the right hands, can be highly informative and useful. But, like Yogi said, prediction is hard, especially when it comes to the future. When you’re carrying all this baggage along with you, it’s even harder.</p></blockquote>
<p>I don’t even try to forecast.  And if I did try forecasting something like the stock price of a company, most of my friends would likely short sell the stocks that I think will do well.  But the local weatherman is saying the Fourth in LA will be hot and sunny.  You think?</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: William Polley comes to the defense of traditional economics in a post entitled <a href="http://www.williampolley.com/blog/archives/2007/07/#000867">Does Tiger Woods ever play golf just for fun?</a>.  After a lot of reflection on the op-ed by Barry Schwartz, Bill answers his rhetorical question:</p>
<blockquote><p>Would Tiger Woods play more golf than he does now if he was only doing it for fun and there was no financial reward? Probably not. So Tiger Woods appears to be responding in a standard economic way to the incentives, but the children in the study are not.  What gives?</p></blockquote>
<p>Hmm.  Nursery school children don’t have to make choices as to the allocation of their scarce time which would fundamentally impact the economic well being of their families.  But adults do.  Hey, I would love to run more but my talents aren’t such that I could make a living doing so.  Alas, the talents that pay me involve sitting at a keyboard writing.  Then again – I’m not paid to blog so one does have to wonder why I’m doing so right day and not running down some Los Angeles trail.  Oh wait – it’s that weather thing again.  If only we had an air conditioned indoor mall with a track around it.</p>

<blockquote><p>A secret U.S. law enforcement report, prepared for the Department of Homeland Security, warns that al Qaeda is planning a terror “spectacular” this summer, according to a senior official with access to the document.” This is reminiscent of the warnings and intelligence we were getting in the summer of 2001,” the official told ABCNews.com.  U.S. officials have kept the information secret, and Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said today on ABC News’ “This Week with George Stephanopoulos” that the United States did not have “have any specific credible evidence that there’s an attack focused on the United States at this point.” As ABCNews.com reported, U.S. law enforcement officials received intelligence reports two weeks ago warning of terror attacks in Glasgow and Prague, the Czech Republic, against &#8220;airport infrastructure and aircraft.&#8221; The warnings apparently never reached officials in Scotland, who said this weekend they had received &#8220;no advance intelligence&#8221; that Glasgow might be a target. Homeland Security Secretary Chertoff declined to comment specifically on the report today, but said &#8220;everything that we get is shared virtually instantaneously with our counterparts in Britain and vice versa.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>It would be an outrage, indeed, if we had solid intelligence about an attack in the UK and didn’t get around to warning them.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>I was waiting for this. From Betsy&#8217;s Page, a blog on the right, a story about <a href="http://betsyspage.blogspot.com/2007/07/david-broder-sorta-gets-one-rightand.html">Ron Paul</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Which Representative from the Houston area would you bet has the most earmark requests? Well, the surprise is that the leader is the <a href="http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/headline/metro/4935311.html">libertarian Ron Paul</a> who supposedly disdains almost all federal spending.</p>
<blockquote><p>U.S. Rep. Ron Paul of Lake Jackson, the Libertarian-leaning contender for the Republican presidential nomination, long has waged war on the widespread federal spending he views as outside constitutional boundaries.</p>
<p>But the congressman, who often votes against spending bills, including funds for the Iraq war, leads the Houston-area delegation in the number of earmarks, or special funding requests, that he is seeking for his district. He is trying to nab public money for 65 projects, such as marketing wild shrimp and renovating the old movie theater in Edna that closed in 1977 — neither of which is envisioned in the Constitution as an essential government function.</p></blockquote>
<p>Oh, the irony.</p></blockquote>
<p>I guess that makes Ron Paul <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/06/comparing-presidents-size-of-government.html">similar to Ron Reagan</a>. But then, which Republican candidate isn&#8217;t?</p>

                                <p>As I’ve mentioned before, I’m thinking of collecting a lot of posts into a book form.  I figure the graphs produce a useful history, even if you don’t believe that the President could possibly have had anything to do with anything involving this country.  </p>
<p>So here’s the rough plan going forward for the next few whiles…  a few posts on things the President doesn’t control… demographics and maybe some Fed stuff.  Then a few on education.  Also… I’d like to have a few posts on the military… I’ve found that recently they’ve changed the location for a lot of military data and a lot of the links I have are now broken.  I think I can data for number of military personnel from the Statistical Abstract of the US.  But… I’m also interested in standards applied to new recruits (I keep hearing that standards have dropped in recent years – is this true?) and one on pay for military personnel… if possible, for enlisted personnel and for officers separately.  Anyone have any ideas?</p>
<p>Also… anyone know where I can get annual data on Veteran’s affairs?  The Statistical Abstract has assorted years, and the VA site is awful for that purpose.  I’ve also located a bit of data on education.  Any other topics y’all wanna see covered?  No guarantees of course, but I can do my best.  And of course, pointing to a data source is not unhelpful.  </p>
<p>Anyway, as a starting point… here’s population since 1980 <a href="http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/tables/07s0011.xls">population of the US since 1980</a>.  (I can only find detail on various age subgroups through 1980.) As always, I’ve broken it up by President, though I don’t think the President has much effect on population.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RojrZDb6N3I/AAAAAAAAAW4/o2s0oq7jQpo/s1600-h/Population,+Graph.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RojrZDb6N3I/AAAAAAAAAW4/o2s0oq7jQpo/s320/Population,+Graph.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Here’s a summary, by Presidency.</p>
<p>I’ll have some posts looking at some specific demographic issues soon.  For instance, readers have insisted that one of the explanations for the drop in the murder rate or the rapid increase in real income or some other thing that occurred in the Clinton administration were due in part to demographics (murder to the number of young men, real income to those in their prime earning years, etc.).   The data only goes back to 1980, but we can check some of these assertions.  I predict that at least some of these assertions are not true.</p>

                                <p>This post looks at spending on the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2008/sheets/hist04z1.xls"> Executive Office of the President as a share of the total Federal Budget </a> and how that has changed over time.  Presumably, a President that believes in limited government would be especially likely to shrink the footprint of his own office.  </p>
<p>I should note… the idea for this post came from a comment by <a href="http://www.haloscan.com/comments/angrybear/720236310471393129/#646553">k harris</a> to <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/06/white-house-hearts-earmarks.html">a post by PGL about GW’s earmarks</a>, and that PGL had a <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/06/spending-by-executive-office-of.html">follow-up post</a>.   I&#8217;m not sure how much new info I&#8217;m providing, except for those readers that don&#8217;t read the comments to the posts.</p>
<p>Moving right along, here’s a graph.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rojphjb6N1I/AAAAAAAAAWo/lKT8uTjxKbU/s1600-h/President%27s+Office,+Graph+1.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rojphjb6N1I/AAAAAAAAAWo/lKT8uTjxKbU/s320/President%27s+Office,+Graph+1.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Clearly, there’s a stupendomongolous jump in 2004, and then another big jump in 2005.  The scale of GW’s spending makes it hard to even see what is going on in the other administrations, so the graph below leaves out the last few years.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rojpcjb6N0I/AAAAAAAAAWg/8RTcUGHQWSQ/s1600-h/President%27s+Office,+Graph+2.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rojpcjb6N0I/AAAAAAAAAWg/8RTcUGHQWSQ/s320/President%27s+Office,+Graph+2.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Notable features…  huge increase (not relative to GW, of course) in the Nixon admin, a smidge of which was reversed by Ford.  There’s one big odd spike in the Clinton admin (what happened?  Anyone have any idea?  Was that Monica Lewinsky-related?).</p>
<p>Here’s the summary…</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RojpWTb6NzI/AAAAAAAAAWY/01bS0DPVCJ4/s1600-h/President%27s+Office,+Table+1.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RojpWTb6NzI/AAAAAAAAAWY/01bS0DPVCJ4/s320/President%27s+Office,+Table+1.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>The big spender is GW, followed by Nixon.  Then GHW.  Clinton spent half as much as GHW…  note that in the second half of his term, spending seems to have started up.  Bringing up the bottom is Reagan, but what is this?  Carter is the next most frugal, and followed by JFK/LBJ?  Not possible!  </p>
<p>So what is going on here?  Hard to say.  PGL&#8217;s <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/06/spending-by-executive-office-of.html">follow-up post</a> on which reader <a href="http://www.haloscan.com/comments/angrybear/9054984313951226809/#646652">sammy</a> points, in comments, to the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2005/pdf/appendix/eop.pdf">budget breakdown</a> and notes that it actually includes some funding for Iraq.  Why funding for Iraq should be put into the President’s budget I have no idea.  But it does raise the question about whether Nixon did the same thing during the Vietnam War (on a much lesser scale), hence explaining the blip in his term.  </p>
<p>I note that GW seems to have been increasing spending even before he began using this artifact to pay for parts of the Iraq War.</p>

                                <p>Dean Baker was invited to provide the economic section of <a href="http://www.harpers.org/archive/2007/06/0081545">Undoing Bush: how to repair eight years of sabotage, bungling, and neglect</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Two economic calamities have occurred on George W. Bush’s watch. The first has been a radically overvalued dollar, which, it should be noted, is a legacy of the Clinton years: by the date of Bush’s inauguration in January 2001, the real value of the dollar was already 27 percent higher than its low in July of 1995, the surge due in part to the stock bubble, in part to the financial crises in East Asia and elsewhere, and in part to high-dollar cheerleading by the Clinton Administration’s treasury secretaries. And yet despite these unsustainable highs, Bush did almost nothing to reverse the run-up; the value of the dollar actually increased in 2002. It has fallen since then, but it is still 12 percent above its 1995 low. The problem that a high dollar poses for manufacturing is straightforward: if the dollar is expensive relative to other currencies, then it is very cheap for Americans to buy imported goods and very expensive for foreigners to buy U.S. exports. In effect, an overvalued dollar provides a subsidy to imports and imposes a tariff on exports. Not surprisingly, this high dollar has led to a rapidly rising trade deficit, which in 2006 grew to more than $760 billion, or nearly 6 percent of GDP. This, in turn, has been the major factor contributing to the loss since 2001 of 3 million manufacturing jobs, or more than a sixth of the entire sector.</p></blockquote>
<p>As I found myself agreeing so far, I was awaiting for Dean to mention the other shoe aka the Federal budget deficit.  But that’s not what he lists as the second economic calamity:</p>
<blockquote><p>The other major economic disaster under Bush has been the unchecked growth of the housing bubble, and although this, too, was inherited from his predecessor, Bush in this case deserves an even greater share of the blame. By the start of the Bush Administration, housing prices (which over the prior forty years had just kept even with the overall rate of inflation) had on average, and after adjusting for inflation, risen approximately 23 percent over their mid-nineties levels &#8211; a substantial but still containable surge. In 2001, however, when the stock bubble collapsed, Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve Board chairman, seized on the expanding housing bubble as the best tool for boosting the economy out of the recession. He pushed the short-term interest rate down to 1.0 percent—the lowest level in almost fifty years &#8211; and, more important, assured investors of the safety of the housing market, telling Congress in the summer of 2002 that “recent sizable increases in home prices . . . reflect the effects on demand of low mortgage rates, immigration, and shortages of buildable land in some areas.” By 2006, prices were 73 percent higher than their pre-bubble values, for a total of more than $8 trillion in unsustainable wealth.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m confused.  Did Dean think that the Federal Reserve should have run a contractionary monetary policy when the economy was weak a few years ago?  Additionally, he is letting the fiscal irresponsibility of the Bush Administration off the hook when he does not mention that fiscal stimulus leads to less national savings – which is part of the explanation for the rise in the current account deficit.  Dean does get around to mentioning fiscal policy:</p>
<blockquote><p>One last point: although budget deficits are not as big a problem as is often claimed, it will be necessary to take back Bush’s tax cuts, which have reduced annual tax revenue by somewhere between $100 billion and $300 billion each year. Of course, the war, too, is a substantial drain, costing more than $100 billion a year at present, or nearly 1 percent of GDP. It should be noted that neither the tax cuts nor the war broke the bank: when President Bush leaves office, the country’s ratio of debt to GDP is projected to be 66 percent, still below the peak debt to GDP ratio of 67.3 percent that we hit in the mid-nineties.</p></blockquote>
<p>Dean has the accounting correct but the role that fiscal policy has on interest rates and exchange rates is missing from this commentary.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>The Senate  has decided on a new set of fuel economy standards for the auto industry, the House will likely pass it this year, and seems to in accord with President Bush, so I expect the legislation to be signed.</p>
<p>The Big 2 + 1 lobbied heavily against the changes. Toyota was opposed, Honda was somewhat opposed, and Nissan took no position (The private equity firm bidding on Chrysler says the bill will destroy the auto industry).</p>
<p>Based on extensive reporting in the Detroit media, apparently none of the auto (foreign or domestic) companies think we can hit the new standards without radical changes in American consumer and driving habits.</p>
<p>Physics is unforgiving, in order to move a vehicle of a certain weight a certain distance at a certain speed  &#8211; energy must be expended. Technology will likely provide a part of the answer, but not a full solution.</p>
<p>So be prepared for smaller cars and smaller trucks. Be prepared for a higher rate of highway deaths (semis will not be downsizing).</p>
<p>In our household we drive two small fuel efficient vehicles, but then I don’t have to load up tool boxes, cattle feed, or six kids and my commute is about 4 blocks. If the rustbelt weather is bad I can usually stay home, and my wife has retired from nursing so I no longer have to worry about her going to work in lousy weather.</p>
<p>Other people have different vehicle needs, for both work and family. Winter in the rustbelt can be very ugly.</p>
<p>So, how much change are US consumers willing to accept? Will consumers regret the actions of elected officials? Will Nancy Pelosi and Diane Feinstein get a backlash from California consumers when the real impact of this legislation becomes clear?  Will actors arrive on the red carpet in Chevy Cobalts? Will the titans of Wall Street travel NYC in  the Ford Focus? Are we prepared to gut even more of our manufacturing base? Your thoughts?</p>
<p>PS: It is likely the Delphi deal will become a model for much of the auto parts industry, which is interesting because those workers who do keep their jobs (most jobs are offshored) will no longer really be in the middle class. Is this the end of an era for US manufacturing? Will blue collar workers be dumped from the middle class? Is this progress?</p>

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p><a href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/beat_the_press_archive?month=06&#038;year=2007&#038;base_name=does_china_have_900_million_mi">Dean Baker</a> directs us to <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ch.html#People">this data on China</a>.  It seems China has about 1322 million people of which 79.6% are 15 and over.  An adult population around 1052 million is pretty large.  It also seems that those with jobs number 798 million or 75.8%.  </p>
<p>I raise this in light of how Dean is having fun with <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/29/AR2007062902270.html">Edward Cody</a> who wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Migrant workers &#8211; as many as to 900 million have left farms to find jobs &#8211; typically get dormitory-style housing and basic food as part of their benefits.</p></blockquote>
<p>Dean notes that 45 percent of China’s approximately 800 million workers are employed in agriculture.  Does Mr. Cody think China’s employment to population ratio exceeds 100%?  And did anyone at the Washington Post bother to proofread Cody’s article?</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: AB reader Henry Cobb directs us to the <a href="http://www.china-embassy.org/eng/gyzg/t281206.htm">official data</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>A survey by the Ministry of Agriculture shows China&#8217;s migrant worker population has grown to 114.9 million with an estimated 6.7 million new migrant workers this year.  China&#8217;s vast rural areas have provided cheap labor for the country&#8217;s industrialization drive since the 1990s with an average annual increase of 4.03 million migrant workers from 1998 to 2005.  The ministry estimated the migrant worker population would increase on average by four million annually in the next few years &#8230; According to the ministry, migrant workers have seen their average wage increase to 852 yuan (106 U.S. dollars) per month in 2006 from 803 yuan in 2005. Migrant workers mainly work in the service sector, with 24.2 percent in industry, 21.1 percent in construction and nearly half in the commercial and restaurant sectors.</p></blockquote>
<p>Henry suggests that the official statistics might understate the number of migrant workers but it is highly unlikely that China has 900 million workers who have migrated to the cities.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.thecarpetbaggerreport.com/archives/11270.html">The Carpetbagger</a> documents that Mitch McConnell is using every procedure in the Senate arsenal to shut down the Senate.  In the midst of the overwhelming evidence that Senator McConnell is a hypocrite, we get:</p>
<blockquote><p>For literally years, Republicans, with a 55-seat majority, cried like young children if Dems even considered a procedural hurdle. They said voters would punish obstructionists. They said it was borderline unconstitutional. They said to stand in the way of majority rule was to undermine a basic principle of our democratic system.  And wouldn’t you know it; the shameless hypocrites didn’t mean a word of it.  Why hasn’t the Democratic Congress had greater success passing legislation in its first six months? Because 239 separate pieces of legislation have passed the House, only to find Senate Republicans “objecting to just about every major piece of legislation” that Harry Reid has tried to bring to the floor. It’s not only shameless, it’s cynical. Republicans expect to get away with this nonsense because they assume most Americans don’t even know what a filibuster is. They figure, the more they obstruct, the worse Congress looks — and with a Democratic majority, that means the GOP will blame Dems for the Republicans’ delay tactics. Indeed, it’s quite a vicious cycle. Dems bring up a bill … Republicans block the bill &#8230; Dems tell voters to be patient &#8230; Republicans blame Dems for failing to deliver on their policy agenda. And if Americans aren’t paying attention, they fall for the con.</p></blockquote>
<p>This was posted the day before the immigration bill that President Bush wants to see passed couldn’t get past McConnell’s two-faced behavior.  McConnell claims he supports this bill, but another dies for a lack of cloture as even Republicans who helped author the bill joined in on the fun of stabbing the supports in the back.  But as <a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/014924.php">Steve Benen</a> notes, the press is going to blame Senator Reid and the Democrats.  But Steve fires back:  </p>
<blockquote><p>Republicans may be accusing Dems of coming up short, but NBC viewers might benefit if they knew whether those accusations are accurate … Indeed, Senate Republicans &#8211; the ones accusing Dems of being a &#8220;do-nothing Congress&#8221; &#8211; are proud of their efforts. Senate Minority Whip Trent Lott boasted, &#8220;The strategy of being obstructionist can work or fail. So far it&#8217;s working for us.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>So what is the next thing this President needs – besides that immigration bill, which of course his own party doomed?  Funding for the Iraq War?  Funding for anything else?  A judicial nomination to get through the Senate?  The Democrats should slow roll everything until Senator McConnell changes his tune.  If this is the game the GOP leadership wants to play, I say shut down all functions of the Senate except those investigations of this corrupt White House.  Full steam ahead with these – now that it’s clear that McConnell has decided to procedurely block everything that Reid is trying go get done.</p>
