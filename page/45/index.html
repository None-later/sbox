                                <p>by<strong> Dale Coberly</strong><br /><strong><br /></strong> <br />SOCIAL SECURITY<br />Sweet Reasonableness <br />and Fact Checkers</p>
<p>Apparently the Big Liars are getting worried about the fact that &#8220;Social Security has nothing to do with the deficit.&#8221; There have been a flurry of little Big Liars &#8220;proving&#8221; that in fact SS is a contributor to the Deficit. I am going to try to point out the hidden lie in a couple of these articles, beginning with the most dangerous.<br />Glenn Kessler ( <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/post/updating-a-ruling-social-security-and-its-role-in-the-nations-debt/2012/11/29/1cd3e8aa-3a68-11e2-8a97-363b0f9a0ab3_blog.html">Washington Post</a> ) sets himself up to be <i>The Fact Checker</i> for the Washington Post. The trouble is, of course, that in this world every liar begins by claiming himself to be the Fountain of Truth and offers to explain things to the little people who wouldn&#8217;t be expected to know without his kind guidance and protection. The Devil, they say, can appear in the guise of a Franciscan monk when it suits his purposes.<br />And Kessler adopts Sweet Reasonableness for his schtick today. Why not? It works for Lyndsay Graham.<br />&#8220;Senator Durbin,&#8221; he tells us, says &#8220;Social Security has added not one penny to the deficit.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kessler explains how he previously &#8220;evaluated&#8221; similar statements and &#8220;rated&#8221; them, &#8220;true but false.&#8221; Can&#8217;t get any more fair and balanced than that. But Kessler is worried that this &#8220;true but false&#8221; statement will lead readers to forget that &#8220;Social Security&#8217;s a long term issue that can&#8217;t be deferred.&#8221; I hope you notice how we are gently being led into the swamp. Most Washington Post readers will not notice. These are, after all, the people who took on mortgages they couldn&#8217;t afford because &#8220;house prices can only go up.&#8221; And of course were blamed for their foolishness later by the very people who sold them the mortgages.</p>
<p>Update:  Also see <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thestraddler.com/201310/piece2.php">Jamie Galbraith</a> <br />explains why the WaPo&#8217;s so called fact checkers is wrong as well, in addition criticizing &#8220;sensible liberal&#8221; takes on middle class and what works. </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>But Kessler doesn&#8217;t &#8220;mean to pick on Durbin since plenty of Democrats in recent days have made similar comments.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ah, see how fair we are being. Can&#8217;t blame Durbin, because all the Democrats are doing it.</p>
<p>But Kessler &#8220;remains troubled.. given the further decline in Social Security&#8217;s finances in the past year.&#8221; Note we get this &#8220;further decline&#8221; as an established fact that we don&#8217;t have to question. We will not even be given time to ask whether this &#8220;fact&#8221; bears on the question of SS contribution to the deficit. Remember, that&#8217;s where we started.</p>
<p>And of course, more sweet reasonableness: &#8220;we do not think this is a slamdunk falsehood as some people believe, but it is certainly worth revisiting&#8221;&#8230; in order to convince you dear reader that while it is not false, this &#8220;talking point&#8221; is not true. See, we are just saving you from being misled by that fast talker over there.<br />Then Kessler gives us a list of &#8220;facts,&#8221; which are true enough to establish his credibility as a fair truth checker. While he leads us ever so gently by the hand to his disturbing conclusion: You see, all that money coming into Social Security from interest on the Trust Funds &#8220;is simply paid with new Treasury Bonds.&#8221;<br />Leading to the inevitable conclusion that SS does indeed increase the deficit. You see, if you borrow money and you have to pay it back, that &#8220;increases your deficit.&#8221;</p>
<p>I hope&#8230; without hope&#8230; that what is wrong with this is obvious to the (my) reader. But just in case: paying back money you owe does not increase your debt. It decreases it. Even if you borrow money to pay back the money you owe someone else, you do NOT increase your deficit&#8230; you just exchange one debt for another. And in any case&#8230; the person you borrowed from did NOT increase your deficit. YOU did. And if you try telling him you are not going to pay him back because that would increase your debt&#8230; he may send the boys around to break your knees. And you would deserve it.</p>
<p>But Kessler regards this as &#8220;a matter of Theology.&#8221; I guess it is, some people regard paying their debts as something like Thou Shalt Not Steal. Others, like Kessler, regard not paying your debts&#8230; especially if they are owed to old ladies who can&#8217;t break your knees&#8230; as simply &#8220;good business practice.&#8221;<br />And of course, my debt is her fault because she lent me the money.</p>
<p>But, he says, some say &#8220;this is just paper shuffling among different parts of the U.S. government.&#8221; Those people who paid into the Trust Fund to pay in advance for their own retirement &#8220;benefits&#8221; don&#8217;t exist. The government is some kind of Monolithic &#8220;person&#8221; that only owes money to itself. The &#8220;government&#8221; has no relationship of trust whatsoever to the people it calls &#8220;citizens&#8221; or &#8220;taxpayers.&#8221; It&#8217;s theology: &#8220;the government giveth and the government taketh away.&#8221; or in this case, the &#8220;government borrows and the government stiffs the people it borrowed from.&#8221; We are not expected to notice that the government borrowed from workers to give tax breaks to the rich, and that not paying back the workers will save the poor hard working job creators from the indignity of paying back what they borrowed (through the government they paid for). Or, heaven forbid, that the money the United States of America borrowed had nothing to do with creating, or protecting, &#8220;our&#8221; ability to make more money in the (now present) future so we could afford to pay back what &#8220;we&#8221; borrowed. Nah, that would sound too much like the &#8220;government behaving like a business.&#8221;<br />Kessler says, oh so reasonably, &#8220;What matters is whether Social Security is generating enough money to pay for its bills on its own. The plain fact [we are, after all, fact checkers] is that it is not.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is a lie. It is in fact a damned lie. Social Security &#8220;generated&#8221; the money to pay for its bills on its own. It lent a temporary excess of that money, those taxes, to The United States of America. Kessler says that Social Security cannot cash its bonds to pay for its bills&#8230; because that would, you see, force the United States of America to find some money to pay its full faith and credit obligations with. And we all know the United States of America is broke, flat busted. Where would The United States of America find that kind of money?</p>
<p>See, &#8220;White House budget documents&#8230; show that &#8230; Social Security outlays exceed Social Security payroll taxes, thus boosting the bottom line federal deficit.&#8221; Well I would not want to accuse the White House of keeping two sets of books, but if you refuse to count the money Social Security already collected in payroll taxes and saved for just such a recession as we have today&#8230; and can say with a straight face that &#8220;outlays exceed taxes&#8221; while pretending the interest on previous taxes does not exist&#8230; you are a goddamn liar.<br />You want to watch out for damned liars who call themselves Fact Checkers and lead you with sweet reasonableness to your own destruction.</p>
<p>[Kessler hints at, but sweetly does not go into, the &#8220;fact&#8221; that the payroll tax holiday causes Social Security to contribute to the deficit. This is also a lie, but more subtle. It is not Social Security contributing to the deficit. It is the tax &#8220;holiday.&#8221; The tax holiday is NOT Social Security. It is the opposite of Social Security. In fact it might best be understood as what would happen if the Liars succeed in cutting Social Security. At some point people will not have enough SS benefits to live. At that point the Congress may have to pay &#8220;welfare&#8221; to those people out of the general fund (the deficit). Will they then blame Social Security for causing the deficit? Of course they will. Because the &#8220;fact checkers&#8221; will have taught them they can say any damn thing they please, and the people won&#8217;t be able to do anything about it.]</p>

<p>Links Worth Noting: Stealth (Class) Warfare<br />(Op-ed)</p>
<p>Paul Krugman, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/30/opinion/krugman-class-wars-of-2012.html">Class Wars of 2012</a>, New York Times (Nov. 30, 2012).</p>
<p>When Mitt Romney disparaged ordinary Americans, it was visible, obvious, and clearly an indication of the lack of esteem he held for ordinary Americans. The same arrogance is at work in the class warfare that the radical right is waging against the social programs that have been partof the great stabilization of the middle class and a singular pathway to a more sustainable lifestyle for those who are underprivileged in America&#8211;Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.</p>
<p>The drumbeat for &#8220;fiscal cliff&#8221; worries continues to build in the media. The right wants us to think that they are worried about future generations facing mountains of debt. They aren&#8217;t. The right wants us to think that they are worried that the only way to combat skyrocketing health care costs is by cutting back on benefits for ordinary Americans. They aren&#8217;t, and it isn&#8217;t. The right wants us to think that the wealthy have sacrificed already and are truly noble if they bear even minimal tax increases from the expiration of the Bush tax cuts. They haven&#8217;t and they aren&#8217;t. The right wants the progressives to roll over and play dead, so they can insist that they have the good of the country at heart when they demand cuts to infrastructure spending and cuts to &#8220;entitlements&#8221; as a condition for petty little increases in the taxes of the ultra rich who have greedily sucked up all the juice in the economy for forty years. We won&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Readers may think this blog has become a broken record of arguments for higher taxes&#8211;at least on the wealthy, at least through the removal of the preferential capital gains rate&#8211;and holding firm on protecting Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid. Maybe so. But we must continue to speak out until those we elected to lead the country act like they heard the prevailing sentiment of the election: we want more taxes on the upper class; we want an economy that is stimulated by government spending when private spending won&#8217;t do it; we want a sustainable economy that distributes resources more equitably and not a winner-take-all economy that allows those with monetary power to dictate the lifestyles of the rest of us.</p>
<p>Krugman is, as usual, correct. What they can&#8217;t get by buying an election the rich will try to get by lobbying and pretending to worry about the fiscal cliff. Let them try. Progressives in Congress should start talking, on any available outlet, about &#8220;going over the cliff&#8221; because it really isn&#8217;t so bad. It will free us once and for all of the ridiculous Bush tax cuts and allow us to undertake thinking about the tax code without that &#8220;status quo&#8221; hanging over our head like the sword of Damocles. And we can pass some really decent tax cuts for the lower income quintiles at the first of the year, without having to deal yet again with the &#8220;extenders&#8221; on the table. We can reform corporate tax&#8211;getting rid of loopholes; getting rid of the transfer pricing games&#8211;without lowering rates. And we can deal with the sequester in reasonable ways. What should we spend on and why. Let the rest go. We would finally begin the process of lowering the expectations of the military-industrial complex.</p>
<p>The following are excerpts from Krugman&#8217;s piece.</p>
<blockquote><p>The important thing to understand now is that while the election is over, the class war isn’t. The same people who bet big on Mr. Romney, and lost, are now trying to win by stealth — in the name of fiscal responsibility — the ground they failed to gain in an open election.<br />***<br />Consider, as a prime example, the push to raise the retirement age, the age of eligibility for Medicare, or both. This is only reasonable, we’re told — after all, life expectancy has risen, so shouldn’t we all retire later? In reality, however, it would be a hugely regressive policy change, imposing severe burdens on lower- and middle-income Americans while barely affecting the wealthy. Why? First of all, the increase in life expectancy is concentrated among the affluent; why should janitors have to retire later because lawyers are living longer? Second, both Social Security and Medicare are much more important, relative to income, to less-affluent Americans, so delaying their availability would be a far more severe hit to ordinary families than to the top 1 percent.<br />***<br />[A]ny proposal to avoid a rate increase is, whatever its proponents may say, a proposal that we let the 1 percent off the hook and shift the burden, one way or another, to the middle class or the poor.<br />***<br />The point is that the class war is still on, this time with an added dose of deception. And this, in turn, means that you need to look very closely at any proposals coming from the usual suspects, even — or rather especially — if the proposal is being represented as a bipartisan, common-sense solution. In particular, whenever some deficit-scold group talks about “shared sacrifice,” you need to ask, sacrifice relative to what?<br />***<br />America’s top-down class warriors lost big in the election, but now they’re trying to use the pretense of concern about the deficit to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat. Let’s not let them pull it off.</p></blockquote>

                                <p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/01/business/online-retailers-rush-to-adjust-prices-in-real-time.html">Today’s New York Times article on rapid online repricing by holiday retailers</a> depicts a retail world starting to approach the “flash-trading” status of financial markets:</p>
<blockquote><p>Amazon dropped its price on the game, Dance Central 3, to $24.99 on Thanksgiving Day, matching Best Buy’s “doorbuster” special, and went to $15 once Walmart stores offered the game at that lower price. Amazon then brought the price up, down, down again, up and up again — in all, seven price changes in seven days.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And:</p>
<blockquote><p>The parrying could be seen with a Nintendo game, Mario Kart DS.</p>
<p>A week before Thanksgiving, the retailers’ prices varied, with Amazon selling it at $29.17, Walmart at $40.88, and Target at $33.99, according to Dynamite Data. Through Thanksgiving, as Target kept the price stable, Walmart changed prices six times, and Amazon five. On Thanksgiving itself, Walmart marked down the price to its advertised $29.96, which Amazon matched.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This made me think about a <a href="http://www.multiplier-effect.org/?p=4798">Greg Hannsgen post</a> from last May on the Levy Economics Institute’s Multiplier Effect blog, a post I’ve been meaning to write about. It looks at the pricing mechanism based on how fast prices change/adjust.</p>
<p>The especially interesting thing about this post: It uses a dynamic simulation model to display the effects of slower and faster price adjustments, and lets you run the model yourself, right on the page, by moving a slider to change the speed of price adjustment and watch the results. (You need to install a browser plug-in from Wolfram, which only worked for me in Firefox under Mac OS X 10.6.8; it failed in Chrome.)</p>
<p>The gist:</p>
<blockquote><p>You wonder what will happen when markets finally start working. How about, for example, a market that changes prices and wages quickly in response to fluctuations in demand? …</p>
<p>The pathway shown in the figure just below is followed by public production, capacity utilization, and the markup.</p>
<p>As you move the lever to the right, you are increasing a parameter that controls the speed at which the markup changes in response to high or low levels of customer demand.</p>

<blockquote><p>What happens as the speed parameter is increased is that the economy’s pathway gradually changes until there is a relatively sudden vertical jump in the middle and much higher markup levels at the end—which means a bigger total rise in capital’s share.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then:</p>
<blockquote><p>The next pathway is the one followed by a second group of three variables during the same simulation. This second group includes: money, the government deficit (surpluses are negative numbers in this figure), and the employment rate (total work hours divided by total hours supplied).</p>

<blockquote><p>when the lever is all the way to the right, the pathway begins with an outward spiral, leading to a new inward spiral, and finally an employment “crash” of sorts that occurs as the center of the second spiral is reached. This occurs after the markup has reached very high levels, as seen in the earlier diagram.</p>

<p>That’s a pretty amazing set of conclusions that I don’t think could ever have emerged from mainstream economic modeling techniques. You’ll notice that equilibrium, in particular, is a decidedly problematic concept here. It only seems to emerge when things have gone off the rails and hit the edge of the known world — not in those comfortable middle grounds so fondly envisioned by mainstream models.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a>
<p>I am making no claims of validity for this model’s assumptions, techniques, or conclusions (though I find the conclusions fascinating and plausible) — that’s beyond me. What I want to talk about is the validity of this <em>class</em> or <em>type</em> of dynamic simulation model compared to those commonly employed in “textbook” economic analysis.</p>
<p>In particular it makes me think about some recent posts and comments by Nick Rowe that are (bless him) teaching posts at least partially in response to my constantly demonstrated inability to properly grasp those standard approaches. (No: I’m not being ironic.)</p>
<p>Nick laid out the textbook understanding of the pricing mechanism based on marginal cost of production with wonderful clarity and broad insight <a href="http://worthwhile.typepad.com/worthwhile_canadian_initi/2012/11/four-mc-curves-and-two-ppfs.html">here</a>. I want to suggest that the explanation’s key feature is its use of “short-term” and “long-term.” It’s all about time.</p>
<p>But looking at the figures above — which model time fluidly and continuously (realistically?) as opposed to depicting it in two vaguely defined “chunks” — I want to ask whether Nick’s explanation, and the models employed in that explanation, are sufficient (or even proper) to grasp the processes playing out in the marketplace. Could they predict the effects that we see above? Is that type of depiction and prediction even within their inherent realm of capability?</p>
<p>Yes, Hannsgen’s model employs some textbook constructs, but it deploys them in a model that is structurally, qualitatively different from “comparative static” textbook models. Maybe the modeling technique is the message. Or at least, the proper modeling technique is a necessary condition for imparting an accurate and useful message.</p>
<p>Reading Nick’s posts and those of other smart econobloggers and -commenters, I am constantly astounded at his (their) apparent ability to intuitively comprehend and mentally manipulate multidimensional (and multiconceptual) interplays that leave me flummoxed. But I still wonder: is that ability sufficient for Nick to representatively model, in his head — to intuitively <em>understand</em> — the complex interplay of factors at work? His frequent comments about holding one factor constant, and the importance and difficulty of simultanaeity in our thinking, suggest that the answer might be no.</p>
<p>When you add a minimum wage to a free-economy model, is he able to simulate, in his head, all the possibly resultant pathways through the multidimensional space of prices, labor inputs, capital inputs, and output quantities (not to mention redistribution feedback effects, or utility-related factors), all over time — a space where <em>no</em> factors are held constant?</p>
<p>Yes, I’m questioning Nick’s quantitative ability given the models employed to do this kind of simulation in his head. (Suggesting: it’s not just me!, though there is certainly a matter of degree.) But as a result, and also, I’m questioning the <em>qualitative </em>ability of those models as employed to enable such understanding in our limited minds (notably, mine).</p>
<p>As I <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/jim-manzi-correlation-causation-understanding-and-predicting.html">said recently</a>, science is about really understanding how things work — telling a convincing causative story — not (just) predicting what will (might) happen. (At the extreme, you could say that prediction is only useful for scientists as a test of understanding.) The textbook models seem to provide some predictive power, but you gotta wonder how much of that is false positives. And given that question, you have to ask how well they really “explain” how economies work — how much true understanding they provide.</p>
<p>In other words — back to my apparently congenital inability to really internalize and understand the textbook models — it’s not my fault! (Yes: now I am being ironic.)</p>
<p>All this raises one big question for me: why aren’t mainstream economists <em>all over</em> these kinds of dynamic simulation models? Why do we only see them at the fringes, in work by “heterodox” outsiders like Hannsgen and Keen, and in the ever-about-to-emerge work promised by the guys at the Santa Fe Institute? Why aren’t big, and (within limits) out-of-the-box thinkers like Nick, Scott Sumner, Tyler Cowen, etc. — people who show every indication of really wanting to understand — <em>fascinated</em> by the possibilities of this type of modeling? In the weather and climate business, textbook economic modeling techniques would be laughed out of the room. Are not economies of a similar complex, dynamic, emergent type with weather and climate systems — arguably even more so, and more complex, because economies include the game-theory grist of conscious intentions and expectations (about other people’s intentions and expectations)?</p>
<p>I recently corresponded with a econ Phd candidate who really wanted to work with and build such models for his thesis. He reported that everything about the institutional and intellectual structure of academic economics militated against his doing so. “Just grab a data set, build a model and pull some regressions, call it good and head for the tenure track.”</p>
<p>You don’t have to read Kuhn or Marx to wonder whether this isn’t the result of 1. the irresistible intellectual gravitational pull of institutionally sanctioned models however obviously flawed (<a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/the-miasma-school-of-economics.html">miasma</a>, phlogiston, epicycles, equilibrium), and 2. the undeniable (inherent?) effectiveness of existing textbook economic models and modeling techniques in perpetuating and amplifying the established power structures and (increasingly) unequal distribution of income and wealth — wealth that actively seeks to perpetuate and expand itself via institutional structures like universities. (No names, just initials: Mercatus Center.)</p>
<p>I’m <em>not</em> imputing moral corruption here (except perhaps institutional). I both prefer and tend to believe that most of us try to do right, “as God gives us to see the right.” Rather, I tend toward the quite plausible institutional explanation laid out so nicely by Chomsky in <em>Manufacturing Consent. </em>In my words: institutions that are dependent on, are part and parcel of, those larger structures of power and wealth, only hire and promote people who already — perhaps by their very nature — see “right” right. (Or right “right.”)</p>
<p>And who knows? They might be right. Maybe my personal incentive is just to show (myself?) how smart I am relative to the mainstream institutions. But based on the Aha! moments of intuitive understanding that I experience when I see and explore models like Hannsgen’s, I tend to doubt whether that’s the only thing at play.</p>

                                <p>Many have noted that under success hating kenyan islamosocialist Barack Obama nominal corporate profits just set a new record.  Uh so what.  A dollar isn&#8217;t worth what it used to be worth.  Graphing nominal quantities is silly.  The more interesting points is that the ratio of after tax corporate profits to GDP just set a new record (data only go back to 1947)</p>
<div><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-dyPEnmWv818/ULkJzTLPL_I/AAAAAAAAAVY/jrdiAzFXNEo/s1600/socialistObama.JPG" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="241" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-dyPEnmWv818/ULkJzTLPL_I/AAAAAAAAAVY/jrdiAzFXNEo/s400/socialistObama.JPG" width="400"></a></div>
<p>Notice also how corporate profits were almost as high under Truman as under Obama and then that socialist Eisenhower ruined eerything.  Also notice that even the Eisenthower through Carter and Clinton ratio was much higher than the extraordinarily low ratio under Reagan and Bush Sr.</p>
<p>Of course the new record in after tax corporate profits divided by the consumer price index for all urban consumers is even more impressive.</p>

<p>Angrybear readers know that GDP grows faster under Democrats and so should not be surprised at how much more horribly real corporate profits tend to do under Republicans. </p>

<p>There are no &#8220;per se&#8221; tax or spending caps: lame duck negotiations no place for Medicare/Medicaid cuts</p>
<p>When George W. Bush got reelected with a minority of the popular vote and contested state counts, the GOP claimed a mandate to keep going with the fiscally irresponsible program of high military spending combined with tax cuts particularly advantageous for their wealthy and corporate-owning supporters.<br />When Barack Obama got reelected with a clear majority of the popular vote and a resounding majority in the electoral college, the GOP says Obama has no mandate because the GOP managed to retain the House though Democrats in the House got more votes than Republicans in the House.<br />Anybody notice the partisan inconsistency there?</p>
<p>What we do know is that a majority of Americans&#8211;even lots of those Republicans who voted for Romney&#8211;want this Congress to preserve <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicaid">Medicaid</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicare_%28United_States%29">Medicare</a>.  There is a huge effort by some&#8211;like the Peterson Institute, the Simpson-Bowles comedy tour, and right-wing propaganda tanks&#8211;to cast Medicare as impossible to sustain because of the current trend in health care costs.  The argument goes this way:
<ul>
<li>health care costs in the US are rising </li>
<li>the population that is eligible for Medicare in the using is rising as baby boomers age </li>
<li>Medicare costs will therefore inevitably increase </li>
<li>even though Medicare costs are rising less rapidly than non-Medicare health care costs (because of the ability of the government to mandate certain cost controls), those increases will eventually require significantly higher government outlays </li>
<li>the US has unprecedented levels of debt and annual budget deficits </li>
<li>the US spends too much compared to its tax revenues (the tax take is several percentage points less of the GDP than the spending percentage) </li>
<li>therefore the US can&#8217;t afford to pay those increasing amounts for Medicare health care costs </li>
<li>therefore we should cut back on eligibilty for, and benefits from, Medicare.</li>
</ul>
<p>But this argument has several fatal flaws that include the following:</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<ul>
<li>debt is extraordinarily cheap right now
<ul>
<li>if you can borrow at very low rates, it is better to borrow now than later </li>
<li>if you can borrow at very low rates and there are important projects on which to spend the money, the borrowed money acts as a stimulant to the economy </li>
<li>if the economy is stimulated by the borrowed money, the GDP growth will likely support continued low interest rates and faster revenue growth that will repay the debt faster</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>deficit spending by the government is vital when there isn&#8217;t private spending
<ul>
<li>and if the economy grows, private spending will grow and deficit spending can pull back</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>spending priorities have to be determined: 
<ul>
<li>there is no per se rule that higher spending is necessarily bad (though the right-wing in this country presupposes that there is and based almost all policy prescriptions on that presupposition, because the right-wing ideologically wants to divert public spending to its private pocketbooks) </li>
<li>there is no arbitrary and fixed percentage of GDP that is the &#8220;right&#8221; amount to be spent by the government on government programs </li>
<li>we spend too little now on public infrastructure ( public transporation, national roadways, electrical grids, and sewage systems are badly deteriorated), basic research (we have cut back on funding for NIH and NSF, major drivers of advancements in scientific and medical knowledge), and major priorities like combatting global warming/ supporting renewable energy </li>
<li>we spend too much now on the military (the military-industrial complex constitutes about 60% of the federal government) </li>
<li>we should support continued spending on Medicaid and Medicare, because those programs fill a vital need and serve the population well&#8211;we should not reduce benefits but rather increase them, at least for those who rely on Medicare/Medicaid as their primary or only health care plan</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>     We&#8217;ve already built in various cuts to the spending for Medicare and Medicaid (possibly too much) and the question of what the costs will be ten years down the road depend in part on what else we do along those lines and how those things work out. See Editorial, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/29/opinion/health-care-entitlements.html">Health Care Entitlements</a>, New York Times (Nov. 29, 2012); Yves Smith, <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2012/11/fed-budgetary-experts-demolish-cbo-health-cost-model-the-lynchpin-of-budget-hysteria.html">Naked Capitalism</a>.</li>
<li>     tax policy should be based on fairness in the way we raise revenues and spending priroities in the amount of revenues we raise</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>An equation that says &#8220;X (health care costs) is increasing and Y (Medicare coverage of health care costs) is increasing (because the number of people needing the program that pays for health care costs is increasing) and Z (taxes for coverage of health care costs) is increasing&#8221; and then concludes &#8220;therefore we must reduce Y&#8221; is using false logic: 
<ul>
<li> to maintain a relative constant, there are more options than &#8220;reduce Y&#8221; since the country could:
<ul>
<li>reduce X (move to single payer, as every other advanced nation has done, and halve the cost of health care) </li>
<li>increase Z (increase the tax support for Medicare, because it is a high priority that a majority of the citizens of our democracy support)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>What we have to do is get away from the kind of thinking that seems to permeate so much of the discussion in Congress and in the media&#8211;that there are pre-set limits to how much we should borrow, how much we should spend, or how much we should raise in tax revenues. </p>
<p>The deficit hawks want us to think that the countnry will be just another Greece if we don&#8217;t rein in spending and debt and keep taxes low.  Traditionally our spending has ranged around 21% of GDP, but there is nothing magical about that number&#8211;it could rise to 24% or 26% without harm.  And we are not Greece, because we remain a powerful economy, one that can print our own money and one that commands interest from the global economy, so our debt (mostly caused by the Bush tax cuts combined with the Bush wars, and the Reaganomics deregulatory mania) is not an unbearable yoke around our necks.  We should be discussing the real needs of the country for infrastructure and provision of public goods and then figuring out how to pay for them with a combination of taxes and debt.</p>

<p>Gigantic journalistic investigation into tax havens</p>
<p>While Mitt Romney may be fading from view in the wake of his defeat on November 6, the issue of tax havens is definitely not following suit.</p>
<p>Via the Tax Justice Network, I&#8217;ve just learned of a massive, multi-national joint investigation into secrecy jurisdictions by three very heavy hitters, the Guardian, BBC Panorama, and the U.S.-based International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ). Though they are starting out with the United Kingdom and the seriously understudied situation in the British Virgin Islands, ICIJ has announced that this is just the start of a multi-year investigative project and that there are &#8220;many more countries to come in the next 12 months.&#8221; Further, according to ICIJ, the investigation involves literally &#8220;dozens of jurisdictions and in collaboration with dozens of media partners and freelance journalists around the world&#8221; (emphasis in original).</p>
<p>As I write this, the first and second articles (Nov. 25 and 26) in the Guardian&#8217;s series rank number two and number one in the &#8220;most viewed&#8221; articles in the last 24 hours. One of the most amazing articles discusses the use of &#8220;nominee&#8221; directors, people who pretend to be a company or foundation&#8217;s directors in order to hide the true ownership from authorities. Incredibly, these nominee directors frequently do not know the companies they are supposedly responsible for; they just know that they are getting paid for the use of their names. Be sure to check out the BBC undercover film linked from this Guardian article.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>The tremendous scope of the journalistic investigation begs the question: where is government on this? Part of the answer is that government is way behind the curve. In 1999, the British government claimed to have stamped out a nominee sham colorfully named the &#8220;Sark Lark,&#8221; for the tiny Channel Island of Sark where the nominees lived. However, it turns out that the perpetrators of the Sark Lark have simply moved all over the world to continue their scam; the BBC caught up with one former Sark resident in Mauritius.</p>
<p>The other part of the answer is that much of these activities are, in the immortal title of David Cay Johnston&#8217;s book, &#8220;perfectly legal.&#8221; It appears that in many cases governments do not make the effort to sift the illegal from the legal activities.</p>
<p>But let&#8217;s not forget: tax havens cost the middle class worldwide hundreds of billions of dollars in tax revenue that they have to make up. The evidence is mounting that they are a central piece of the world financial system. Fundamental reform is necessary and a massive journalistic effort like this one will help produce the outrage to make it possible. I&#8217;m looking forward to more fruits of this investigation.</p>

<p>Health Care Thoughts: EMR Cluster Mess</p>
<p>The 2009 stimulus bill kicked off the process to install <i>electronic medical records</i> (EMR) tied into <i>electronic health records</i> (EHR) networks. The stimulus bill included financial rewards for installing systems and meeting “meaningful use”standards.</p>
<p>Couple of problems, with unfair heat aimed at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.<br />First, it is difficult to really audit the “meaningful use” standards, even if the auditors were available, so we really don’t know if the stimulus money is being used properly. This was a problem baked into the cake.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/29/business/medicare-is-faulted-in-electronic-medical-records-conversion.html?hp&#038;pagewanted=print">http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/29/business/medicare-is-faulted-in-electronic-medical-records-conversion.html?hp&#038;pagewanted=print</a><br /><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/29/business/medicare-is-faulted-in-electronic-medical-records-conversion.html?hp&#038;pagewanted=print">     </a><br />Second problem , the physician office systems tend to direct docs through a check-a-box, drop-down-box, and standard language environment. The entered information (in many systems) then interacts with a coding program to send billing codes to the appropriate billing system. Now it seems some physicians using EMRs may be coding higher than physicians who are not. (see NYT archives, 9/24 and 9/25/2012)</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Is this higher coding fraud, lack of training, incompetence or could it be the docs were under-documenting and under-coding previously. We won’t know for a while, with billions at risk, and the docs at risk for civil and criminal actions.</p>
<p>Third, THE BIGGEST PROBLEM, EMRs just do not seem to work as neatly as the vendors promise and the bureaucrats imagine. Like many panacea remedies, the implementation is tougher than the dream.<br />And we haven’t even gotten to ICD-10 implementation yet. </p>
<p>Or the privacy and security nightmares sure to follow.</p>

<p>If employers are faced with higher wage rates, that gives them more incentive to invest in business capital that 1. makes workers more efficient and productive, and 2. reduces the number of workers they need.</p>
<p>Is this incentive effect figured into the analyses of minimum-wage effects that you’ve seen? I haven’t laid eyes on such a thing, but my knowledge of the literature is far from comprehensive.</p>

                                <p>I’ve pointed out before that in some areas (<a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/medicare-government-does-it-right.html">here, Medicare</a>), government programs are hugely more efficient and well-run than their private counterparts.</p>
<p>I don’t know if this qualifies as one of those, but it does make a very important point that I’ve also made before:</p>
<p>Government is not the problem.</p>
<p>Bad government is the problem.</p>
<p>Good government is the solution.</p>
<p><img title="declining errors" src="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/image/omb_ip_blog_graph-crop.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="430"></p>
<blockquote><p>…<strong>the government-wide [payment] error rate has decreased to 4.3 percent, having steadily declined from its high-water mark of 5.4 percent in Fiscal Year (FY) 2009.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That high-water mark would represent the culmination of eight years of Republican laissez-faire administration (boy you can say that again), coupled with six years of Republican control of both houses of Congress.</p>
