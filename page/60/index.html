<p>Romney&#8217;s &#8220;Binders full of women&#8221; comment<br /><em>editor&#8217;s note:  this is a political commentary and not a tax discussion</em>.</p>
<p>When Romney was asked what he could do about the inequity in women&#8217;s compensation, he didn&#8217;t answer the question.  He tried to turn it to his advantage by telling a story of how he ended up bringing a number of women into his cabinet back in the days when he was a more liberal politician serving as governor of Massachusetts.  He claimed that he wasn&#8217;t pleased that his staff hadn&#8217;t found qualified women for cabinet posts, and that he told them to go shake the trees and find some.  They came back with a binder full of women and he appointed a cabinet with record numbers of women.</p>
<p>So he didn&#8217;t answer what he would do about the pay inequities that exist.  He didn&#8217;t answer what he would do about the hiring inequities that exist, other than what seemed to be a personal claim that he personally ensured that there was an adequate search to establish a deep pool of women cabinet candidates.<br />But as a woman, I was jarred by the comment.  It was as though there really weren&#8217;t any &#8220;qualified&#8221; women but when pushed, he was able to come up with &#8220;binders&#8221; of women that could be appointed anyway and he did.  There was a hint that the women he appointed weren&#8217;t really &#8220;qualified&#8221;.  Or that because he had to push his staff to go out and find them, something else was wrong.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>It turns out that another organization&#8211;the Massachusetts Women&#8217;s Political Caucus&#8211; was thinking ahead and trying to ensure that whomever was elected governor would be aware of the many qualified women who could serve on a cabinet.  It created a Government Appointments Project (MassGAP) that developed an extensive process for candidate consultation on including women in high-level positions and got pre-election commitment from both the Democratic and Republican candidates to make efforts towards that goal. It was binders put together by MassGAP that the governor used to make his appointments.  (Perhaps if organizations in other states had prepared in that way, even more governors would have done better jobs of appointing females to their cabinets.)</p>
<p>Further, the meaty positions that were considered central to the functioning of the state (budget, trade, and similar matters) were indeed handed over to men.  The women were given more peripheral roles.<br />While Romney should receive some recognition for acknowledging that appointment of women was and is the right thing to do, his awkward phrasing nonetheless suggests that he doesn&#8217;t think women are at a par with men in this game of politics, and his avoidance of the heart of the equity question suggests he doesn&#8217;t get it.</p>

<p>Romney&#8217;s Tax (Mis)Calculations: if your two and two don&#8217;t add to four, pretend the Laffer curve gives you more</p>
<p>Anybody watching last night&#8217;s presidential debate surely became aware at some point that Romney&#8217;s so-called &#8220;plan&#8221; for economic growth is an empty shell based on <a href="http://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=5048766"></a>the idea that he&#8217;s made money for himself so he knows how to run a country. </p>
<p>Romney&#8217;s plan is pure <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_fundamentalism">market fundamentalism</a>&#8211;a mistaken view that the &#8220;market&#8221; will take care of all problems and vigorously grow to elevate everyone&#8217;s livelihood just so long as government regulators stay out of the business of regulating and allow business owners and managers (particularly huge multinational corporate owners and managers) to do whatever they want, including fire workers, outsource business assets, and engage in complex schemes to turn tax laws into tax avoidance bonanzas.  Oh, and the government should provide all kinds of subsidies to aid those businesses at minimal or no (tax) cost&#8211;from interstate roadways to easy rights to exploit national lands owned by the public; from localo fire protection to federally funded international security; from state-based contract protection to federal courts that provide handy forum choices to the wealthy and big corporations; from state and local property tax exemptions and waivers to federal intellectual property rights that provide monopoly power and stifle innovation (exactly the opposite of the Founders&#8217; dream).</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>And when Romney claims that he can &#8220;simplify&#8221; the tax system and lower everyone&#8217;s rates without increasing the deficit, reducing the taxes paid by the upper crust, or increasing the taxes paid by the middle class, while at the same time increasing the military budget and striking more threatening poses a la the Bush neo-cons on Iran?  That&#8217;s gibberish, as many respected studies have shown.</p>
<p>So to his rescue comes one of those propaganda tanks in the guise of an intellectual &#8220;institute&#8221;&#8211;the Institute for Policy Innovation (IPI).  The Institute puts out a &#8220;Tax Bytes&#8221; newsletter/blogpost supporting right-wing, market fundamentalist, Friedman-lite tax policies.  Not surprisingly, the Institute is sanguine about making a Reagan-style across-the-board rate reduction program work even in an economy that is still in transition back from the brink that the Bush market fundamentalist tax and fiscal policies put us in.  That is,  in spite of the fact that Romney-Ryan stand for things like making the Bush tax cuts permanent, eliminating the estate tax, maintaining the preferential rate structure for capital gains and carried interest, and even extending that very low rate preference to all other capital income (like interest) for those earning less than $200,000 (who don&#8217;t have much capital income to worry about though, since the vast majority of it goes to the people in the very top 5% who make millions, not thousands)&#8211;the Institute says &#8220;increased private sector growth&#8221; will make the plan work.  See &#8220;<a href="http://us2.campaign-archive1.com/?u=236713c0eb5508a7a8a8c680e&#038;id=8964e6a996&#038;e=1e32789ab4">Of Course It Can Work</a>&#8220;, IPI, TaxBytes 9.25 (October 17, 2012).  That&#8217;s just the Laffer Curve idea at its worst&#8211;the wacky concept that when you cut taxes, there will be more tax revenues because of all the wonderful things that a self-regulated market does for economies.<br />    <br />So IPI thinks you can cut government revenues even more than Bush did (when the Bush tax cuts of 2001-2003-2004 (and the rest) amounted to about one-third of the cause of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late-2000s_recession">Great Recession</a>).  It buys into the fairy tale that has been used by the far right to justify obstructionist, non-realistic policy positions and that has created the fiscal debacle we are still climbing out of.  That fairy tale is the market fundamentalist &#8220;pie in the sky&#8221; concept that broad economic growth can be magically generated just by letting the rich continue to get richer even if the middle class is falling into poverty and infrastructure is crumbling. </p>

<p>Yes, Amazon has a lower price to revenues ratio, by a 2:1 margin.</p>

<p>And presumably at some point Amazon can turn the prices-versus-market-share dial away from gaining market share/maximizing revenue and toward price and profits. Say they manage a 1% across-the-board price increase <em>with no decrease</em> in their roughly $50 billion in 2011 sales. That would add about $500 million to their $643 million in 2011 after-tax profits — a 77% increase.</p>
<p>That’s a pretty nice jump, but can they do it more than once?</p>
<p>And: assuming Amazon’s stock price remains unchanged, their profits have to grow by <em>1900%</em> to match Apple’s current PE ratio (which is also about what we’ve seen as a historical average ratio for U.S. equities in general).</p>
<p>Sure, we’ve been seeing 55-65% annual revenue growth from Amazon (excepting 2009), but at a steady 50% revenue growth rate it’s going to take them something like seven years to match Apple’s PE at the current Amazon share price, based on revenue growth alone. How confident does anyone feel in predicting that future?</p>
<p>Will Amazon have a trillion dollars in revenues seven years from now? Apple’s 2011 revenues were $108 billion…</p>
<p>Shortly after Amazon IPOed in the 90s I did the same kind of back-of-the-envelope calc, and realized that if they had $10 billion in sales — a 10x increase at the time — the stock price might be reasonable. It took them almost a decade get there — just to get to what <em>would have</em> been “reasonable” ten years earlier. This has been going on<em> for a very long time.</em></p>
<p>Is this time different?</p>
<p>Full disclosure: I’m long Apple. And I do most of my shopping on Amazon. Many thanks to all those Amazon share purchasers who have subsidized my lavish lifestyle.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>In June of 2008, Ron Paul made a <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2011/06/28/news/economy/ron_paul_bankruptcy/index.htm">radical proposal</a>: the Fed should simply burn all the U.S. Treasuries it’s currently holding, reducing the government (U.S. Treasury) debt by $1.6 trillion, or about 10%. (Yes: bonds held by the Fed are counted as part of “Debt Held by the Public,” even though the government basically “owns” the Fed.)</p>
<p>Paul called this “bankruptcy,” but it’s actually pure MMT thinking, acknowledging that 1. the Fed and the Treasury are most reasonably viewed as a single consolidated entity (“the government”), and 2. that government debt is something of a side issue in the big monetary picture (bonds are a vehicle for interest-rate management by the Fed), compared to the matter of central importance: how much newly created money the government puts into the economy by deficit spending, or takes out with a surplus (destroying more money by taxing than it creates by spending).</p>
<p>This is pretty radical talk, for sure. (I wonder if Paul and Kucinich ever eat lunch together.) But now Gavyn Davies <a href="http://blogs.ft.com/gavyndavies/2012/10/14/will-central-banks-cancel-government-debt/#axzz29I7ZFIiD">tells us</a> in the <em>Financial Times </em>that such notions are at least floating about in some decidedly traditional circles (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote><p>Two separate journalists (<a title="Robert Peston blog" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-19918332">Robert Peston of the BBC </a>and <a title="Simon Jenkins column" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/oct/09/iconoclast-for-bank-of-england">Simon Jenkins of The Guardian</a>) said that <strong>Lord Turner’s “private view” is that some part of the Bank’s gilts holdings might be cancelled in order to boost the economy.</strong> Lord Turner <a title="Reuters report of Turner remarks" href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/2012/10/13/britain-fsa-turner-idUKL5E8LD2QA20121013?feedType=RSS&#038;feedName=rbssFinancialServicesAndRealEstateNews">distanced himself</a> in public from this suggestion on Saturday. However, the notion will now be widely discussed. It is easy to see how the idea could appeal to a finance minister facing the need to tighten fiscal policy during a recession in order to bring down the public debt ratio. [that&#8217;s &#8220;Adair Turner, the Chairman of the UK Financial Services Agency, and reportedly a candidate to become the next Governor of the Bank of England.&#8221;]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Davies doesn’t like the idea (inflation worries), and apparently Lord Turner has his qualms as well. But the fact that these ideas are getting any consideration at all in the world of central banking is pretty radical in itself. Heck, the fact that Davies is even writing about it (and explaining it rather well, IMHO, with some caveats) speaks volumes. He has been, after all, a partner, Managing Director, Chief Economist, and Chairman of the Global Investment Research Department at Goldman, Sachs. Not your typical internet econocrank.</p>
<p>For those who follow these discussions, Davies’ two footnotes might be the most significant:</p>
<blockquote><p>[1] Similar proposals have however been widely debated by economists in the past. This goes back at least as far as the works of Abba Lerner in the 1940s on <a title="Lerner on functional finance" href="http://cas.umkc.edu/economics/people/facultyPages/wray/courses/Econ%20601/readings/lerner%20functional%20finance.pdf">“functional finance”</a> and the <a title="Lerner on money" href="http://esepuba.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/lerner.pdf">role of fiat money</a>. More recently, the Modern Monetary Theorists have reawakened Lerner’s ideas. See <a title="MMT explained in the WSJ" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/modern-monetary-theory-is-an-unconventional-take-on-economic-strategy/2012/02/15/gIQAR8uPMR_story.html">this explanation of MMT</a>, and <a title="Krugman on MMT" href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/25/deficits-and-the-printing-press-somewhat-wonkish/">Paul Krugman’s rejection of the approach</a> as being likely to lead to hyperinflation in the long run.</p>
<p>[2] Samuel Brittan makes the case that part of the budget deficit should be money financed in<a title="Samuel Brittan's column" href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/2ad55ea0-12e2-11e2-aa9c-00144feabdc0.html#axzz29GQeK8oI"> this column.</a> Martin Wolf makes a similar case in <a title="Martin Wolf column" href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/045aab84-e61c-11e0-960c-00144feabdc0.html#axzz29GQeK8oI">this column</a>. Both argue that money financing of deficits is preferable to “everlasting austerity and slump”.</p>

<p><strong>IBD/TIPP 2012 Presidential Election     <br />Daily Tracking Poll</strong><br /><strong>Day 4: Oct. 12, 2012</strong><br /><strong>Obama: +0.7</strong>Obama 46.4% | Romney 45.7%<br />Read More At IBD: <a href="http://news.investors.com/special-report/508415-ibdtipp-poll.aspx#ixzz2998NIqGc">http://news.investors.com/special-report/508415-ibdtipp-poll.aspx#ixzz2998NIqGc</a>    <br />The standard report rounds Obama&#8217;s lead down to 0%    <br />&#8220;NATIONAL (IBD/TIPP Tracking): Obama 46, Romney 46&#8221;<br />    <br />The two average Romney up 0.25% not 1%<br />    <br />I often read &#8220;percents don&#8217;t add to 100 because of rounding&#8221;.  But somehow this is not OK when subtracting rather than rounding. </p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />update: Singiser notes that (with the standard silly rounding) Romney&#8217;s national poll lead for the day declined from 1.3% to 1%.  He notes that this is totally statistically insignificant and not worth wasting thousands of pixels to criticize as I do below.<br />    <br />It matters to people silly enough to try to back out daily results from trackers.  To be maximally silly I will use the rounded numbers released yesterday (actually day before yesterday here in Rome).<br />    <br />Gallup 10/11 minus Gallup 10/5 (silly rounded) comes up as a shocking Romney up by 1.4% (shockng as 10/5 should have been a great day for Romney) not an even more shocking 7%.<br />    <br />IBD/TIPP 10/11 minus IBS/TIPP 10/6  (silly rounded) comes out as Obama up 10.2  not 6.<br />    <br />The estimate for a normal day vs the two dread days after the debate is 4.4%  with half silly rounding not -0.5% with all silly rounding.  With silly rounding (both days for both pollsters) it looks as if the debate effect was permanent not a bounce. With silly rounding for the second latest day and not the latest day, it looks as if the debate effect was temporary.  This is all silly, because it is torturing the poor numbers to try to make them say something they don&#8217;t know, but the point estimates are not small.</p>

<p>A look at tax havens by the Fortune 500</p>
<p>According to a <a href="http://ctj.org/ctjreports/2012/10/which_fortune_500_companies_are_sheltering_income_in_overseas_tax_havens.php">new report</a> today from Citizens for Tax Justice, the 285 members of the Fortune 500 that have parked money overseas would owe an estimated $433 billion in taxes if and when it is repatriated. No wonder these companies are working so hard to get a &#8220;<a href="http://idealab.talkingpointsmemo.com/2012/03/white-house-unmoved-by-apples-offshore-cash-problem.php?ref=fpnewsfeed">repatriation holiday</a>&#8221; even though the one given in 2004 did not yield any significant new investment, but lots of dividends and stock buybacks.    </p>
<p>The new report list 10 companies with $209 billion parked overseas that report the taxes they would owe on these profits (only 47 do so). These companies all report that they would owe 32-35% on their money, which indicates they have not paid any taxes abroad on it; in other words, the money is in tax havens.    </p>
<p><em><strong></strong></em><em><strong><img alt="" src="http://ctj.org/images/2012/offshorechart2.jpg"></strong></em>    </p>
<p>Note that some estimates place these figures even higher; in March, <a href="http://middleclasspoliticaleconomist.blogspot.com/2012/03/apple-whines-about-having-to-pay-taxes.html">I reported</a> that Apple&#8217;s overseas stash was estimated at $64 billion.    </p>
<p>Based on the entire 47 companies that report their estimated tax bill, CTJ came up with an average tax rate of just over 27%.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Multiplied by the $1.584 trillion in overseas cash held by the 285 corporations (up from about $1 trillion <a href="http://idealab.talkingpointsmemo.com/2012/03/white-house-unmoved-by-apples-offshore-cash-problem.php?ref=fpnewsfeed">estimated in March</a>) yields the figure of $433 billion in taxes that would be due if the income were repatriated or the deferral provision for overseas income ended.    </p>
<p>What does it all mean? As U.S. companies continue to enjoy record profits, they are declaring them to be foreign profits at a high rate, as we can see in the increase from the March to October estimates. Numerous tech and financial companies have stashed literally tens of billions of dollars, <i>each</i>, in <a href="http://middleclasspoliticaleconomist.blogspot.com/2011/11/tax-havens-cost-middle-class-untold.html">offshore tax havens</a>, which drain billions a year from tax coffers that must be made up with higher taxes on the middle class, larger budget deficits, or cuts in programs. And as we have seen from the two tax returns <a href="http://middleclasspoliticaleconomist.blogspot.com/2012/07/what-is-mitt-romney-hiding.html">Mitt Romney</a> has released, there is <a href="http://middleclasspoliticaleconomist.blogspot.com/2012/03/apple-whines-about-having-to-pay-taxes.html">one tax system for the 1%</a> and another one for the rest of us.</p>

<div>Okay, thus far it’s just one major pundit, the Washington Post’s E.J. Dionne, whose column posted at 1:58 p.m. <i>demolishes</i> the media’s Conventional Wisdom of last night and this morning, which focused mainly on Romney’s two gaffes, and concluded that Obama had won but only barely.  Binders-full-of-women is irresistible fun, but ultimately unimportant; Romney just misspoke, G.W. Bush-style.  And the clarity of Obama’s Rose Garden statement could be debated; it could depend on what the meaning of “is” is.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>But now the focus among the punditry will change.  Dionne <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/ej-dionne-romney-goes-from-etch-a-sketch-to-sketchy/2012/10/17/ad4edc2e-187a-11e2-9855-71f2b202721b_print.html">captures it</a>:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Any high school debate coach would tell a student that declaring, “Believe me because I said so,” is not an argument. Yet Romney confused biography with specificity and boasting with answering a straightforward inquiry. “Well, of course, they add up,” Romney insisted of his budget numbers. “I — I was — I was someone who ran businesses for 25 years, and balanced the budget. I ran the Olympics and balanced the budget.” Romney was saying: Trust me because I’m an important guy who has done important stuff. He gave his listeners no basis on which to verify the trust he demanded.

And neither should you, the American people, because the math doesn’t add up.” Obama sought to make that point in the last debate. This time he had a metaphor and a story to go with the arithmetic.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Romney also covertly disclosed that he, like George W. Bush before him, has every intention of cutting taxes on the rich. Like Bush, he used stealthy language to try to achieve a great fiscal coverup.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Here was Romney on Tuesday: “I will not, under any circumstances, reduce the share that’s being paid by the highest-income taxpayers.” Here was <a data-xslt="_http" href="http://www.debates.org/index.php?page=october-3-2000-transcript">Bush in 2000</a>: “After my plan is in place, the wealthiest Americans will pay a higher percentage of taxes [than] they do today.”
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>This really matters: Romney intends, as Bush did, to push for steep tax cuts for the wealthy. His only pledge is that he’ll keep the share of the total tax take paid by the wealthy unchanged, presumably by reducing other taxes too. And this is supposed to lead to lower deficits? How?
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The most instructive contrast between Debate I and Debate II was the extent to which Romney’s ideas crumbled at the slightest contact with challenge. Romney and Paul Ryan are <a data-xslt="_http" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/10/17/in-debate-romney-struggled-on-substance/">erecting a Potemkin village</a> designed to survive only until the polls close on Nov. 6. They cannot say directly that they really believe in slashing taxes on the rich and backing away from so much of what government does because they know that neither idea will sell. So they offer soothing language to the middle class, photo ops at homeless programs to convey compassion and a steady stream of attacks on Obama, aimed at shifting all the attention his way.…
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>In the first debate, Obama let Romney back into the race by failing to shake his opponent’s self-presentation. But Romney also put himself into contention by pretending to be a moderate, shelving his plutocratic side and hiding his party’s long-term objectives.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>In the second debate, the disguise fell. Romney revealed more of himself than he wanted to and asked voters to endorse a radical tax-cutting program without providing them the details that matter. Sketchy is one word for this. Deceptive is another.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Romney’s candidacy will not survive an ad by the Obama campaign that explains what the meaning of “reduce the share” is.  In actual math.  And that asks voters whether they think Romney intended that they think he meant … something else.

                                <p>
<div></div>
<div>The most revealing moment last night came as Ann Romney walked toward her husband onstage at the end.  That expression on her face.  I thought she looked like a woman in a binder.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>It is, I suppose, poetic justice for Romney that an obviously misspoken phrase of that sort is the catch phrase from last night.  But the phrase, while generating <a href="http://www.politico.com/politico44/sidecar/2012/10/nkingofdc-138734.html">hilarious witticisms</a>, is not the reason why Romney won’t recover.  Instead, it is the binders that Romney has placed <i>himself</i> in that surely became clear to many of his new-found fans of the last two weeks—the binders that underlie his entire campaign. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Most significantly, in my opinion, that his tax plan is, rather than the new math—as he’s been claiming—actually is <i>no</i> math. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>And that he takes contradictory positions at the same time—starkly, last night, for example, that he’s proud that because of him, virtually everyone in Massachusetts has healthcare insurance, yet Obamacare must be repealed because it’s keeping employers from hiring.  (There were others that surely became clear to a lot of people, but this one just bowled me over, because he said these two things within a few minutes of each other.)
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>And—yes; finally!—that he habitually plucks statistics out of their context and misrepresents their meaning, although the most clearly illustrative one was one that Obama wasn’t able to make fully clear last night because of time constraints on his reply to Romney’s allegation.  It will be easy for him to do so now, though.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>That statistic: Romney’s claim that Obama has reduced oil production from drilling on federal lands by 14% by denying drilling permits and leases.  Romney first claimed, falsely, that there has been a 14% reduction in oil production from drilling on federal lands <i>since Obama took office</i>.  After Obama repeatedly interjected that that was false and that the level of that oil production actually had <i>increased</i> during his administration, Romney finally qualified his claim; production had decreased by 14% <i>over the past year</i>.
</p>
</div>
<div><a name="more"></a></div>
<div>I loved it that Obama stepped forward—literally—and explained that the leases and permits that his administration had revoked were ones that the leaseholders and permit holders <i>had not been using</i>, and that <i>that was the reason</i> for the revocations; he wanted the leases and permits to be reissued to others, who would <i>use</i> them.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>That was a great moment, albeit one that probably won’t get much attention.  But even more important is that, as Andrea Mitchell explained during the NBC recap and analysis, the 14% reduction occurred (as Romney finally acknowledged) only in the last year—and that the <i>reason</i> for the drop was … a fire at, and consequent shutdown, of a major refinery in Texas!  And, even with that 14% drop in the last year, production from drilling on federal lands <i>has increased more than 10% since Obama took office. </i>
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>I think the Obama campaign should do an ad on this, saying that apparently Romney <i>thought it was Obama administration policy to have a fire at a major refinery</i>.  And that Romney’s so inept at math that he doesn’t know the difference between a 10% increase and a 14% decrease.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The public will get the point.  Romney is trying to game them. Not a particularly attractive trait in a presidential candidate.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>But one misuse of a statistic by Romney came earlier in the debate, and it downright <i>shouted</i> sophistry, thanks to Obama’s unmasking of it: Romney’s comparison of gas prices in January 2009 and gas prices now.  When Obama pointed out why gas prices were so low when he assumed office—and why they’ve doubled since then—I <i>knew</i> Obama would win the debate.  And when, later, during the discussion of the policy similarities between G.W. Bush’s policies and Romney’s proposed ones, Obama cleverly said Romney probably would send gas prices falling, by crashing the economy and thus lowering demand for oil, I thought then that Obama won the election last night.  </div>
<div></div>
<div>And in the light of today, I’m pretty sure of it.</div>
<div>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Binders.  Indeed.
</p>

<div></div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><div>QUESTION: The outsourcing of American jobs overseas has taken a toll on our economy. What plans do you have to put back and keep jobs here in the United States?</div>
<div></div>
<div><i>Romney:&#8230;which will allow me as president to be able to put in place, if necessary, tariffs where I believe that they are taking unfair advantage of our manufacturers.  </i></div>
</blockquote>
<div>So, who is it on Romney&#8217;s team that has decided this is a viable tool regarding the position labor is in?  Is this what would be expected of a Republican presidential candidate?  It just floored me to hear Romney speak the word &#8220;tariff&#8221; when presenting his solution to the question.  What would Uncle Milton think of his school&#8217;s chosen one?</div>

                                <p>Ashwin Parameswaran <a href="http://www.macroresilience.com/2012/10/17/monetary-and-fiscal-economics-for-a-near-credit-economy/">nails it</a> once again. If you want to understand how the modern financial/monetary system actually works, run don’t walk to read this post.</p>
<p>His key insight:</p>
<blockquote><p>Just as the East India Company could access cash on the back of their government bond holdings in the 18th century, any pension fund, insurer or bank can do the same today.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let me translate that into my words:</p>
<p>If the CB unwinds QE by trading bonds for “money,” “sopping up” “cash” (those are all “so-called” quotes) from the private sector, the private bond-holders can just use those bonds as collateral to get (new) cash loans. Commercial and shadow banks will create (“counterfeit”) the new money under (explicit or implicit) license from the central bank, and deposit the money into the bondholders’ accounts.</p>
<p>Result: roughly the same amount of “cash” in the system.</p>
<p>In other words:</p>
<blockquote><p>…the private sector can monetize the deficit as effectively as the central bank can.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hence:</p>
<blockquote><p>…the reversal of QE, if and when it happens, will have no impact on economy-wide access to cash/purchasing power.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Update, 08:30 PST: </strong>This also serves to explain why QE may not have had as much effect as one might hope. The Fed gave bondholders cash in return for their bonds, so bondholders ended up with more cash but less collaterizable/monetizable/convertible-to-cash bonds. A wash?</p>
<p>Discuss. (But not until you’ve read Ashwin’s whole piece [at least once].)</p>
