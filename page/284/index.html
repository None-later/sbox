<p>&#8220;<a target="_blank" href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2010/09/more-on-ubs-and-whistleblower-bradley-birkenfield.html"><strong>More On UBS and Whistleblower Bradley Birkenfeld</strong></a></p>
<p>The Washington correspondent for Feature Story News, Daniel Ryntjes, interviewed Bradley Birkenfeld in jail recently.  You can find the audio interview and other items on the UBS banking secrecy case, at this link.</p>
<p>Birkenfeld says that most of the US clients were &#8220;sophisticated investors&#8221; who traveled to Switzerland expressly to set up secret accounts and take advantage of the anonymity in a bank that had been operating this business for decades: they didn&#8217;t need to talk about that motive, because everyone knew that was what the service was all about.  He notes that the bankers didn&#8217;t provide the tax advice, but there were lawyers and trust officers who handled that part of the deals, including setting up Hong Kong or Singapore corporations and otherwise.</p>
<p>Birkenfeld, as a director at UBS with signatory power at the bank, had a base salary of about 160 thousand Swiss francs and bonuses that ultimately landed him just under a million dollars a year for his banking work.  Birkenfeld claims that he saw a document not provided to employees that raised questions about the legality and ethicality of the bank&#8217;s activity in having bankers travel to the US to meet with US clients.  While the activity may have been legal in Switzerland, he asked the bank to explain the issues in the US.  He claimed to see a pattern in which &#8220;the bank was trying to distance itself and have a corporate cover for itself, but not for its employees.&#8221;   Meanwhile, it was &#8220;compensating, training, encouraging&#8221; the employees to do those activities.  When the bank declined to answer his queries, he sought outside advice and was told to resign, which he did.  In his exit interview (with human resources and other officials), he argued that he should get an answer to those questions.</p>
<p>While on leave, he wrote the bank stating his concern about violations.  An investigation commenced, which he saw as a cover-up.  Based on this, he traveled to the US and met clandestinely with the DOJ, SEC, IRS and the Senate permanent subcommittee on investigations to testify about the bank&#8217;s activities, &#8220;out of pure principle&#8221;, he says.  So he took on the largest bank in the world about the &#8220;largest in US history&#8221; tax scandal, and now says he wonders why the DOJ had not acted on this issue beforehand.  He also thinks that he shouldn&#8217;t have gone to the DOJ, since he ultimately was prosecuted after sharing, he claims, information with them about the bank.  He says the DOJ is &#8220;incompetent&#8221;, and using the KPMG case as the example, in which the judge concluded that failure to provide financial support for expensive legal counsel was a violation of the tax evasion promoting defendants&#8217; constitutional rights to counsel.  (I find that conclusion highly dubious, but it is the result of the case.)<br /><a name="more"></a><br />Birkenfeld sees himself as the victim&#8211;the only person in prison after the exposure of UBS.  The interviewer notes that he was, in fact, breaking the law for the four years that he worked at UBS pursuing these criminal acts.  He notes that there are thousands of Americans who took advantage of the UBS practice who are NOT in jail, and he is not satisfied with the job done by DOJ with the information provided.  He notes that the &#8220;kingpin&#8221; knew all 25,000 clients, but the DOJ failed to extract all of those names because of the deal they made with UBS for a mere 4500.  They gave the &#8220;kingpin&#8221; immunity and he pled the Fifth at the Senate, then they released him in August 2008 while the Senate was on recess.  Birkenfeld had a long prison sentence, and no other person in the scandal, so Birkenfeld thinks this will discourage whistleblowers from exposing these kinds of criminal acts in the future.  They have prosecuted very few of the names they got early on, so he notes it will take them a long time to prosecute the additional 4500 names.</p>
<p>There is more to the interview, and more in the other links.  Enjoy.  [hat tip to Daniel Ryntjes]</p>

                                <p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/TIonU8nxFDI/AAAAAAAABWI/XGPK-oZns2c/s1600/Clipboard01.bmp"><br /></a>There is still a lot of talk about the bond bubble with so many people expressing their opinions about bond yields being too low. Maybe.</p>
<p>But I thought it might be informative to show that my bond valuation model says that bond<br />yields are almost exactly where this &#8220;objective&#8221; analysis says they should be.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/TIonU8nxFDI/AAAAAAAABWI/XGPK-oZns2c/s1600/Clipboard01.bmp"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/TIonU8nxFDI/AAAAAAAABWI/XGPK-oZns2c/s320/Clipboard01.bmp" alt="" border="0"></a><br />Yes, it is the product of a &#8220;model&#8221; that may or may not be right and even though I have been using this model almost exactly as it is for some 15 to 20 years there is always the possibility that it will blow up next month.</p>
<p>One interesting point is that the model goes along with the Wall Street Journal&#8217;s editorial page  quarter century campaign to point out that federal debt and interest rates have a negative correlation.  At least they push this idea when republicans are in the White House. They are right that cyclically as the government debt rises rates fall and as the debt contracts rates rise.  Of course this reflects that the cyclical federal deficit is inversely related to private credit demands.  So on a cyclical basis the large federal debt is largely a function of the collapse in private credit demands.</p>
<p>Note that the fitted value ticked up, suggesting that on a short run basis yields may be bottoming.  Interestingly corporate America is starting to issue a lot of long term debt.<br />For example,  IBM just floated a large long term bond.  Historically IBM has a good long term history of floating large debt issues around the cyclical bottom in rates.  There are some sharp people in the IBM treasury operations.</p>

<blockquote><p> In their book <strong><em>Presimetrics: What the Facts Tell Us About How the Presidents Measure Up on the Issues We Care About</em></strong>, Kimel, who has built statistical software used by the military and NASA, and Kanell, who covers economics for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, use hard data to quantify and assess presidential performance on a variety of issues. Focusing on the presidencies from Dwight Eisenhower to George W. Bush, and drawing on data from various government sources, they compare and rank presidential performance on issues such as taxes and healthcare. Kimel recently spoke to U.S. News about the merits of using data to assess presidents and why Ronald Reagan might not be as conservative as the public believes.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>This is from the Wall Street Journal.</p>
<p>The Obama administration has targeted small business with laser-like  focus, pushing a $30 billion small-business lending fund in Congress  and, later this week, <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704392104575475920686869934.html?mod=WSJ_hps_MIDDLEForthNews" target='_"blank"'>rolling out a tax break</a> allowing businesses to deduct 100% of qualified capital investments.</p>
<p>But the chief economist at the National Federation of Independent  Businesses said today that small business doesn’t need more tax relief.  Instead, he said, Washington should aim its firepower at consumers so  they begin spending money and creating demand for the products and  services small companies provide.</p>
<p>“If you give a small business guy $20,000 he’ll say, ‘I could buy a new delivery truck but I have nobody to deliver to,’” said <strong>William Dunkelberg</strong>, chief economist for NFIB.</p>
<p>Rather than aim more tax relief at business, Dunkelberg said  Washington should extend the Bush-era tax cuts for everyone – including  those making above $250,000.</p>
<p>“History shows that letting Washington have the money and spend it is very ineffective,” he said.</p>
<p>The administration’s latest idea, which would allow businesses to  temporarily deduct 100% of “qualified” capital investments, can help “on  the margin,” Dunkelberg said. With capital-spending by small business  at a 35-year low, some firms will naturally take advantage of a  temporary tax incentive to replace products. But Dunkelberg said he  thinks most small businesses will hold on to their cash until more  certain economic times </p>
<p>The best way to help, he said, is to “finally address the most important person in the economy – the consumer.”</p>

<p>Want to make the move from wanking to wonking on Social Security finance and policy? Consider the following list.</p>
<p>First read an Annual Report, you don&#8217;t need to understand every number but you do need some grounding in the terms and concepts. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/2010/trTOC.html">2010 Trustees Report</a></p>
<p>Then fill out your knowledge with this really excellent explanation from current SSA Chief Actuary Steve Goss <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/ssb/v70n3/v70n3p111.html">The Future Financial Status of the Social Security Program</a></p>
<p>Now for a little something from supporters of traditional Social Security <a target="_blank" href="http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/035468.html">Baker and Weisbrot (1999): Social Security: the Phony Crisis</a></p>
<p>Read the comprehensive case AGAINST traditional Social Security <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cato.org/pubs/journal/cj3n2/cj3n2.html">Cato Journal (Fall 1983): Social Security: Continuing Crisis or Real Reform</a> (pay particular attention to Butler and Germanis&#8217;s &#8220;Leninist Strategy&#8221;)</p>
<p>For some real heavy lifting advanced students can read through the following sections of the Analytical Perspectives on the Budget (OMBs official explanation of the President&#8217;s Budget). <a target="_blank" href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2011/assets/concepts.pdf">Ch. 11 Budget Concepts and Budget Process (pdf)</a> (note in particular the Glossary starting on pg. 131). The following will give a good guide to the rest <a target="_blank" href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2011/assets/list.pdf">Analytical Perspectives: List of Tables and Charts</a>. The LOT starts on page vii and gives you a guide to chapter titles including Ch. 5 Long Term Budget Outlook, Ch. 6 Federal Borrowing and Debt, and Ch 27 Trust Funds and Federal Funds.</p>
<p>Then you can cross check OMB with the latest versions of these two annual documents from CBO: <a target="_blank" href="http://cboblog.cbo.gov/?p=1263">Long Term Budget Outlook (via CBO  Director&#8217;s blog)</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/104xx/doc10457/08-07-SocialSecurity_Update.pdf">CBO’s Long-Term Projections for <br />Social Security: 2009 Update</a> (2010 version is late this year).</p>
<p>Then to pull all this together with the current policy debate you can read the long version of CBO&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cbo.gov/doc.cfm?index=11580">Social Security Policy Options</a>. If you are short on time you can just read the Summary version, but the long version gives a very comprehensive explanation of Social Security overall, and taken with the Goss article above really fills out the picture.</p>
<p>And I would be remiss if I didn&#8217;t add this link from SSA.gov. The real meat starts about half way through <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/history/briefhistory3.html">Historical Background and Development of Social Security</a></p>
<p>No not all of this is the most thrilling read ever. On the other hand not a word of any of it is filtered through me. Heck that should make it worth it right there! Call it &#8216;Social Security Sans Webb&#8217;. Snark aside, those who work their way through even most of this will be heads and shoulders above 99% of commenters out there. And everyone feel free to make additions to the list in comments.</p>

<p><a target href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2010/09/taxes-deficits-and-elections.html"><strong>Taxes, Deficits and Elections</strong></a></p>
<p>As we near the fall elections amid a &#8220;tea party&#8221; surge of anti-government (and hence anti-tax) sentiment, I cannot help but worry about my country.  The tea party activists are apparently primarily decently educated, middle-class citizens.  They have supported extremist candidates in a number of states, and they have evidenced some worrisome  tendencies that smack of racism or at least ad hominem attacks irrelevant to questions of good governance (questioning Obama&#8217;s faith, which should be irrelevant to national office; his birth certificate, which demonstrates their own credulity; his patriotism, which smacks of smug arrogance mingled with racism and greed; his economics, calling him a socialist for doing much less than we have traditionally deemed appropriate to help the vulnerable in this country).  It is that last thing&#8211;the tea partiers&#8217; entrenched distaste for community spiritedness, helping the vulnerable, and using socio-economic tools to ensure a more just and egalitarian society that is the most disturbing.  It is as though the decades of Reaganomics have inured many Americans to comprehension of their fellow Americans&#8217; suffering, and have created a wall of isolation based on greed and misunderstanding of how government benefits the wealthy that leads middle-class people to vote against their own interest in support of the continued hegemony of the rich.</p>
<p>Obama and the Democrats, of course, are not immune to suasion in the face of potential election losses.  So as the GOP party of &#8220;no&#8221; continues its push to provide tax cuts for the wealthy or bust, and the tea partiers continue their push to paint all of the effort that has been necessary to combat the terrible mess that the Bush regime left the country in as Obama&#8217;s problem rather than a predictable result of the lousy economic policies followed by the GOP &#8220;believers&#8221; in market fundamentalism and greed-is-good philosophy, it is not such a surprise that the Democrats are adopting GOP-favored tax policies that benefit big corporations and the wealthy to the detriment of the fisc. <br /><a name="more"></a><br />Case in point&#8211; Obama has come out for an expensing deduction for big corporations.  This is essentially a huge multi-billion tax write-off, even if temporary.   It would cost about $200 billion upfront, though after taking otherwise allowable depreciation into account, there&#8217;d be a net cost of $30 billion (plus the fact of acceleration of losses to the fisc).  See Jackie Calmes, <a target href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/07/us/politics/07tax.html?_r=1">Obama to Propose Tax Write-Off for Business</a>, NY Times, Sept 6, 2010.  </p>
<p>The problems with expensing are multiple.  Investments are made that would have been made anyway, but the government acts as a partner in the cost without getting any benefit from the partnership.  INvestments are made that are unnecessary and do nothing to increase hiring, since the investments are merely an acceleration of investments that would be made in the future.  And once a temporary provision is in place&#8211;even if the REAL intent was that it be a temporary stimulus&#8211;there will be inordinate lobbying and pressure to make it permanent.  That will be especially the case for an expensing program, since it has long been one of the goals of right-wing economic theorists arguing for low corporate taxes and for the notion that capital should be favored.  (Of course, it is especially the case that gimmicks like the GOP sunsetting provisions for the Bush-era tax laws create long-term problems, since in that case it was acknowledged by the creators of the provisions that they wanted them to be permanent but were enacting them with a sunset to limit the perception of deficit creation though not the reality of it.)</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Peter Orszag (former Obama White House Management and Budget Director) has an idea for compromise on the GOP &#8220;keep all the Bush tax cuts forever&#8221; and DEM &#8220;let the tax rates increase on the very wealthy but keep the cuts for everybody else&#8221; battle over whether or not to enact new tax cuts given the end of the temporary Bush provisions on December 31, 2010.  See Orszag, <a target href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/07/opinion/07orszag.html">One Nation, Two Deficits</a>, NY Times, Sept. 6, 2010.  Orszag&#8217;s idea is to pass a new temporary bill sunsetting the laws in 2012, and then don&#8217;t pass any more tax cuts&#8211;let them die altogether.  As a compromise, it has something going for it, in that the temporary enactment of new cuts would act (a little) as economic stimulus and the permanent end of all of the tax cuts wipes the slate clean of a messy set of tax changes that never made any sense in the first place.  As stimulus, it is not as good as spending federal money on needed public and human capital projects, but it is much better than giving more permanent tax breaks to big business and the wealthy.  </p>
<p>Of course, the problem with this is similar to the problem with the proposed temporary expensing rule&#8211;the GOP will always fight to make the temporary tax cut into a permanent one, and will always cast their side as against a tax increase in spite of the fact that the law ends the break at a specific time, and so they are actually arguing for deficit increases to pay for big tax cuts to the wealthy and big corporations.  If the Dems lose Congressional seats in the fall elections, the GOP would be even more likely to push through more deficit-increasing tax cuts, while still arguing against deficits to justify privatization or cutbacks in Social Security and Medicare.  Their hypocritical inconsistency on this hasn&#8217;t bothered them yet, so no reason to expect a change in the future.</p>

<p>Naomi Freundlich at Maggie Mahar’s Health Beat Blog discusses the passage of the $26 billion state aid package and why it does not go far enough in securing healthcare for those who qualify for Medicaid. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.healthbeatblog.com/2010/08/passage-of-26-billion-state-aid-package-is-merely-a-stopgap-measure-for-medicaid-woes.html">Passage of $26 billion State Aid Package Is Merely a Stop-Gap Measure For Medicaid Woes</a>.</p>
<p>To get this past the Senate, the bill was stripped of $12 billion Food Stamp Program and closed loopholes in incentives which encourage employers to move jobs overseas to make it revenue neutral. While it is good to see Congress start to close loop holes for companies and individuals who utilize them to their own benefit and not for what they were intended, you have to wonder what were they thinking when it came to the food stamp program. In the midst of a mediocre job creation economy with no end in the near term, the millionaire Senate balances the budget on the backs of the poor who depend upon Food Stamps . . .  41 million citizens in 2010 . . . to get Senator’s Snowe and Collin’s votes. The kicker here is the Senate playing Education off against healthcare and food stamps. Education, healthcare, or food ???</p>

Ohio did register its uninsured numbers at 13.9% of the population which many would probably qualify for Medicaid if unemployed long enough. Then there is Joe Barton of Texas complaining about the extension also. Yep that is Texas, the number 1 amongst all of the states with the highest number of uninsured at 26.9%. Hey at > than 1 in 4 residents without healthcare what could John really say other than: </p>
<p>“There is no emergency!”</p>
<p>Maybe there is no emergency for Rep. John Barton who is covered by the congressional healthcare plan and maybe we can blame the number of uninsured in Texas on illegal and legal Hispanic immigrants? Wonder what was he thinking? </p>
<blockquote><p>“80 percent of those the Gallup organization or the Census Bureau would count as uninsured are actually U.S. citizens. “If we took all the immigrants out of Texas—legal and illegal—we would still have the highest uninsured rate in the country,”</p></blockquote>
<p> says Eva DeLuna, a budget analyst at the Center for Public Policy Priorities (CPPP), an Austin-based think tank. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newsweek.com/blogs/the-human-condition/2009/08/19/texans-are-most-likely-to-be-uninsured-gallup-says-but-don-t-blame-immigrants.html">Texans are Mostly Likely</a></p>

<p>A curious feature of the battle over Social Security is that it is almost always a battle of adjectives and adverbs and not numbers, In particular almost everyone agrees that &#8216;Nothing&#8217; is not a plan, People are not always clear on the consequences of &#8216;Nothing&#8217; whether that be &#8216;massive&#8217; benefit cuts or &#8216;devastating&#8217; program cuts or just the Invisible Bond Vigilantes burning down our fiscal house but everyone just assumes its going to be bad. Real bad. Horribly really bad. Because only morons don&#8217;t understand that Something has to be done: benefit cuts or retirement age changes or cap increases or means testing but Something!!</p>
<p>Well call me Moron. Or maybe Guy That Has Read the Report and Wonders What the Shouting is About. Maybe that still adds up to Moron, but can we at least start with official numbers and methodology?</p>
<p>The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/2010/trTOC.html">2010 Report of the Trustees of Social Security </a>was released on August 5th, a little over four months late from the normal release date of Mar. 31. Is that late release important? Well no, there is probably a back story but in light of the actual reporting it is not of much significance, because the bottom line is as follows:<br />
<blockquote>For the short range (2010-2019), the Trustees measure financial adequacy by comparing projected assets at the beginning of each year to projected program cost for that year under the intermediate set of assumptions. A trust fund ratio of 100 percent or more — that is, assets at the beginning of each year at least equal to projected cost for the year — is a good indication of a trust fund’s ability to cover most short-term contingencies. The projected trust fund ratios for OASI alone, and for OASI and DI combined, under the intermediate assumptions exceed 100 percent throughout the short-range period and therefore OASI and OASDI satisfy the Trustees’ short-term test of financial adequacy. However</p></blockquote>
<p> We&#8217;ll get back to that &#8216;however&#8217; but the fact is that Social Security passes the ten year test for solvency, the same ten year test used by OMB and CBO and Congress to measure just about every other aspect of federal spending. So if the issue isn&#8217;t solvency of Social Security itself maybe it is the projected damage to the overall deficit. Well no, under the rules that govern Social Security any year in which Trust Fund balances are positive scores as equally positive for deficit calculations and if we examine the appropriate table <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/2010/IV_SRest.html#271967">Table IV.A3.—Operations of the Combined OASI and DI Trust Funds, Calendar Years 2005-19</a> we can see that the combined Trust Funds are scheduled to increase from $2.6 trillion to $3.3 trillion in 2015 (the target date for the Obama Deficit Commission) to $3.9 trillion in 2019 and the end of the projection period. Now opinions vary on whether we are in imminent risk of attack by the Invisible Bond Banshees, but offhand you wouldn&#8217;t think a ten year surplus of $1.3 trillion was actual banshee bait, so you can&#8217;t explain this away as deficit hysteria, using the standard window for judging these matters Social Security is doing just fine. So why are conservatives demanding that we impose cost controls NOW, NOW, NOW while progressives are countering with RAISE THE CAP. A LOT. YESTERDAY. Well unfortunately the answer is easy. The former crowed is studiously ignoring the numbers and most of the latter never actually looked at them to start with. Because once you engage with the numbers you too will see why &#8216;Nothing&#8217; is a perfectly fine plan for Social Security is the short run while our plan (natch) is perfect for the medium to long term. Which no doubt sounds like pure arrogance on our part. Well maybe, but it is informed arrogance, and I&#8217;ll try to share some of that information under the fold.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />So we have a situation where combined OASDI satisfies the Trustees test for &#8216;Short Term Actuarial Balance&#8217; and is projected to have a ten year surplus of $1.3 trillion so clearly we can exhale a little, the sky is not falling, not if you use official numbers, and whatever threat there may be is somewhere over that ten year horizon. Which brings us to our first important dividing point. Is a $3.9 trillion 2019 Trust Fund Balance in real terms an asset? Or a liability? Is it a fund we can draw on, or a debt we have to redeem? And the answer to all four questions is &#8220;Yes&#8221;. Which ones you would emphasize depends on where you sit.</p>
<p>(Okay first thing out of the box. The Special Treasuries that make up the Social Security Trust Funds are real as real, there is nothing phony about them, and if you think different YOU are the moron. Or a liar. Or worse. See you in comments because all the arguments to the contrary are just Cato and AEI bullshit. Full stop.)</p>
<p>Having settled that point for the moment, we can see that the projected $3.9 trillion in the 2019 Trust Fund is an asset from the prospective of current and future retirees, but a liability from the perspective of current workers and taxpayers (not the same thing), and that there is some substantial overlap. But not total overlap because the asset has been built up from one income stream, that of FICA payroll taxes while the payback has to come from another, that of income tax or borrowing from the public and the incidence of those taxes all inequally. For example returns on capital are not subject to FICA and so contributed nothing to the build up but are exposed to income tax and so are liable for some of the payback. Which fact frankly is the source of much of the tension here. And ultimately will raise the question of whether this whole kerfluffle is really about solvency? Or servicing costs? For the moment I want to keep the focus on solvency.</p>
<p>Okay so we have established that by official measures Social Security meets the ten year solvency test so problems on that front if any are somewhere over that horizon. To find out how large that problem might be we need to consult the following table from the 2010 Report. It shows the outlook for OASI (Old Age/Survivors) and DI (Disability) separately and combined into OASDI over a probability range from uniformly optimistic (Low Cost) to uniformly pessimistic (High Cost) economic and demographic projections. Since it is unlikely that all of the relevant variables would move in the same way there is a certain artificiality to Low Cost and High Cost but the Trustees have supplied reasonable tools to measure that uncertainty and we can be reliably certain that the probable outcome will be somewhere in the confidence interval. Those who want to check the analysis can be my guest: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/2010/trTOC.html">2010 Report: Sec VI.D and E</a>. In the meanwhile we will be looking at these numbers: <a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/TIJr4pc4c1I/AAAAAAAAAZo/hEd29JEtDn0/s1600/2010+IV.B4.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/TIJr4pc4c1I/AAAAAAAAAZo/hEd29JEtDn0/s400/2010+IV.B4.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />Having seen that the Trustees test for short term actuarial balance is measured over ten years,  we can see here that the test for long term balance is seventy five years, supplemented since 2003 with another test over the infinite horizon. And under Intermediate Cost (i.e. median) assumptions the actuarial deficit for combined OASDI is 1.92% of payroll. Meaning that an immediate boost in payroll tax of that amount would deliver us to 2084 having been able to pay 100% of scheduled benefits and with a full one year reserve in the Trust Fund. But there are a lot of &#8216;ifs&#8217; buried in that two decimal point precision, because the actual spread runs from +0.59% to -5.26% of payroll, meaning there is some chance that Social Security left alone would actually be OVER funded going forward with a larger chance of it being even more underfunded than that 1.92% suggests. Gosh darn it, who knew that the future was actually unknowable? So what if we reel it back a bit and look only 50 years out. Hmm a narrower range of +0.55% to -4.00% but still kind of wide. 25 years out? +1.12% to -1.86%.</p>
<p>So what does this blizzard of numbers tell us? Well a number of things. For one thing even under our most optimistic set of assumptions there is a dropoff after 25 years as Social Security drops from a 1.12% of payroll surplus down to 0.55%. That is Boomers do exist and will exert maximum impact on the system in the 2030s as trailing edge 1964&#8217;s hit 67 in 2031. Nothing short of product roll-out of Soylent Green is going to forestall that. On the other hand there is a measurable chance that Social Security left unchanged would STILL dodge that bullet and allow full payout of benefits with a small margin to spare, so there is no reason to over react and by the way no reason at all to pay attention to infinite future numbers. Already at 25 years we are look at a +/- 1.35%, subscribing to a package of benefit cuts/tax increases of 3.5% (the infinite future IC gap) being frankly nutty in light of the probability spread.</p>
<p>Adding all of this up is &#8216;Nothing&#8217; the perfect plan? Well no, there is a better than even chance that the demographic realities of the 2030s and early 2040s demand that &#8216;Something&#8217; be done. But what that &#8216;Something&#8217; is depends on how you frame that demand. If the real problem is an inability to deliver full benefits then the answer is to put in place plans to bolster the system if and when. On the other hand if the perceived problem is the DEMAND for full benefits to crowd out other spending priorities then the answer is to find some way to mitigate the shock of Trust Fund depletion and subsequent reset of benefits if and when.</p>
<p>Which brings us to the crux. It seems the main concern of the Catfood Commission is that greedy geezers will demand full benefits no matter what and that the answer is to start transitioning retirees from eating the occasional steak to  homemade Beef Stroganoff to Hamburger Helper to Fancy Feast to Kibble so that there is no trouble once the Trust Fund goes to exhaustion, the solution to being electrocuted on the Third Rail of American Politics is just to drain the juice out slowly. Because clearly their concern is not benefit cuts at Depletion as such, I don&#8217;t see any plans which aim to deliver some intermediate result BETTER than that you get from &#8216;Nothing&#8217;, all their &#8216;Somethings&#8217; require retiree give backs over the status quo. Which is why I say that &#8216;Nothing&#8217; is STILL a better plan than the choices we are being offered, and that is true even if we are thrown some scraps of &#8216;People Food&#8217; in the form of cap increases, in the end kibble with a little chum salmon on top is still dog and cat food (Alaskan natives keep the chinook/King and coho/Silver for themselves and unless pressed feed the chum/Dog to, well the dogs).</p>
<p>Many progressives out there believe that the answer to Social Security &#8216;crisis&#8217; is simple enough even a Moran (sic) like me should grasp it-just raise the cap. Which ignores a couple of realities. One there is ZERO chance that you will get any change in the cap that doesn&#8217;t come with giveaway&#8217;s on the benefit side. Zero, zip, nada. You need four Republican votes from the Deficit Commission for ANY deal and you can bet anything you like that they will extract something. If only because they have no real interest in fixing Social Security in any meaningful way, they don&#8217;t want it to be seen as a successful government program delivering real benefits to workers, that doesn&#8217;t serve their agenda even the tiniest bit, the right answer to any Social Security offer coming out of this Commission is 99.9% likely to be &#8220;No Deal!&#8221;, no matter how attractive the bait on the hook. Under the current environment the best plan on the policy table is the tried and true plan: &#8216;Nothing&#8217;.</p>
<p>Which leaves careful readers two objections. &#8220;Bruce you said &#8216;Nothing&#8217; was only the &#8216;2nd Best Plan&#8217; . And what about that &#8216;However&#8217; from the Trustees you said we would get back to&#8221;. Okay you got me. While &#8216;Nothing&#8217; is better than almost all the likely &#8216;Somethings&#8217; out there even the 25 year OASDI numbers suggest a bias towards some action to action even if it doesn&#8217;t have to be tomorrow. And if we break out OASI and DI we can see why the Trustees appended that &#8216;However&#8217;. Back to the 2010 Report.<br />
<blockquote>However, the DI Trust Fund fails the Trustees’ short-term test of financial adequacy. Its trust fund ratio is projected to fall below the 100 percent level by the beginning of 2013. After 2013, the DI trust fund ratio continues to decline until the trust fund is exhausted in 2018.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ouch. DI is currently bleeding and badly, in fact if we consult Table IV.B4 again we can see that its 25 year actuarial deficit is 0.30% and in fact accounts for ALL of the combined 25 year gap of 0.25% plus some. While &#8216;Nothing&#8217; is a perfectly defensible plan for Old Age/Survivors it just won&#8217;t do for Disability, there we need a &#8216;Something&#8217; and if anything we need it yesterday. Which brings us to a curious fact, there is a near perfect alignment betweeen the 25 year actuarial gap for combined OASDI and DI and the 75 year gap for DI in isolation: 0.25%, 0.30%, 0.30%. Meaning we can install a 75 year fix for DI which will also give us a 25 year fix for combined OASDI. Gosh if only someone had run some numbers and got us a &#8216;Something&#8217; we can believe in.
