                                                                    </div>

                                <p>AB readers likely realize that I’m not a Lou Dobbs Democrat.  So you might be surprised that there are a couple of points Lou makes in <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/US/11/14/Dobbs.Nov15/index.html">his latest</a> that I agree with:<br />
<blockquote>The political, business and media elites have called me a &#8220;table-thumping protectionist&#8221; because I want balanced and mutual trade, because I want this country to export as much as it imports.</p></blockquote>
<p>With exports being less than 10.5% of GDP and imports being more than 16.2% of GDP last year, how could one disagree with this sentiment?  This free trade advocate would hope that the trade imbalance would be closed by finding someway to increase exports rather than restrictions on imports.  <a href="http://www.econbrowser.com/archives/2006/11/current_account_2.html">Menzie Chinn</a> directs our attention to an interesting argument from <a href="http://www.imf.org/external/np/res/seminars/2006/arc/pdf/blan.pdf">Olivier Blanchard</a>: <br />
<blockquote>Yet, there appears a widely shared worry that these deficits are too large, and government intervention is required. My purpose, in this lecture, is to examine the logic of this argument. I ask the following question: Assume that deficits reflect private saving and investment decisions. Assume also that people and firms have rational expectations. Should the government intervene, and, if so, how?  To answer the question, I construct a simple benchmark. In the benchmark, the outcome is first best and there is no need nor justification for government intervention. I then introduce simple distortions in either goods, labor, or financial markets, and characterize the equilibrium in each case. I derive optimal policy and the implications for the current account. I show that optimal policy may or may not lead to smaller current account deficits.</p></blockquote>
<p>Blanchard is not only making the case for free trade in the absence of market distortions but is also pointing to the importance of thinking about the lack of national savings by the U.S. as we invest more than we save.    Menzie points to his favorite distortions, which include central bank intervention, that is, the tendency for the Chinese Central Bank to keep its currency from appreciating.  Reckless U.S. fiscal policy, as Menzie puts it, is likely why our national savings is so incredibly low.  </p>
<p>While I wish Lou Dobbs would focus more of his frustration towards these two distortions, I tend to agree with this:<br />
<blockquote>It seems nothing frightens our free trade and pro-illegal immigration orthodoxies more than putting the common good and the national interest above dominant special interests, corporate America and, of course, our darling elites in both political parties and the media.</p></blockquote>
<p>The reason for my willingness to listen to this populist concern comes from some beating of the press from <a href="http://www.prospect.org/deanbaker/2006/11/good_protection_bad_protection.html#014519">Dean Baker</a>: <br />
<blockquote>Educated people know that protectionism is bad &#8211; free trade is the way of the future, protectionism is the Neanderthal past. But, of course protecting intellectual property is good, and people who don&#8217;t support protecting intellectual property are bad. And, by the way, we never talk about the cost of protecting intellectual property. If anyone cared about consistency, we would have some problems here, but fortunately we have the NYT to guide us through this slippery terrain.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m suspect Lou Dobbs might pose the following question to the New York Times – why is protection for the elite good while protection for the middle class is bad?  If he has not yet, let me pose that question.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://www.democracyarsenal.org/2006/11/trade_policy_st.html">Heather Hurlburt</a> and <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2006_11/010239.php">Kevin Drum</a> cover the politics of the trade debate.  Kevin offers this wisdom as well:<br />
<blockquote>Protectionism would be a disaster for both the United States and for the world&#8217;s developing countries. Democrats should resist falling into that trap. At the same time, everyone knows that it&#8217;s the well-off who mostly get the benefits from these deals while the working schmoes mostly take the lumps &#8211; with the constantly promised help for the losers never seeming to arrive. With that in mind, I imagine trade is going to be a hotter topic of conversation over the next couple of years than it has been recently, and I hope that Democrats can figure out some way to embrace trade while also doing something concrete to force the winners to share the gains with the losers. (And not just the &#8220;retraining&#8221; mantra, please. I&#8217;ve got nothing against training and education, but it&#8217;s wholly inadequate as a complete solution. We need a lot more than just that.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Compensating the losers from trade!  Yes, I do remember telling students about this utopian idea – with the usual response being something like, “have you ever seen politicians actually doing that?”</p>

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>The Mankiw post (and I refuse to link to it – you all know where it is) continues to generate some controversy.  This is simplistic, but here’s an alternative look at the numbers.  All data from <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2007/sheets/hist01z3.xls"> OMB Table 1.3.</a> </p>
<p>In the year 2000, the surplus was 2.4% of GDP, in 2005 the deficit was 2.6% of GDP, for a swing of 5% of GDP.  In that time, revenues went from 20.9% of GDP to 17.5%, a change of 3.4% of GDP.  Outlays went up from 18.4% of GDP to 20.1% of GDP, or a change of 1.7%.</p>
<p>In other words&#8230;. was the bulk of the 5% swing due to a 3.4% change in taxes, or a 1.7% change in outlays?  Depends in whose world.  In Mankiw’s, only one fifth of the change in the surplus &#038; deficit position was due to cut in taxes, but “that amount is most likely an overestimate.”</p>
<p>Now, many defenders of tax cuts will say… but 2000 was the peak of the bubble.  Pick a different year and results are very different.  OK.  Let’s do that and look at the very different results.</p>
<p>Let’s try 2001.  From 2001 to 2005, the surplus to deficit change was 3.9% of GDP.  Meanwhile, there was a 2.3% decrease in taxes, and a 1.6% increase in spending. </p>
<p>Let’s try 2002.  From 2002 to 2005, the surplus to deficit position deteriorated by 1.1% of GDP.  Taxes fell by 0.4%, and revenues increased by 1.1% a year.  Outlays increased by &#8220;only&#8221; 0.7% of GDP.  Well… there we go.  Here’s a year that works in Mankiw’s favor.</p>
<p>How about 2003?  Well… the deficit actually has decreased by 0.9% from 2003 to 2005.  In that time, tax collections increased by 1% of GDP and spending increased by 0.1% of GDP. </p>
<p>What about in years before 2000?  From 1999 to 2005, the surplus to deficit change was 4% of GDP… taxes fell by 2.5% and spending increased by 1.4% in that period.  1998 was similar.  </p>
<p>So… if you pick 2002 as your starting point, Mankiw’s argument seems reasonable.   Pick a different year and the story makes little sense.  Personally, I think Mankiw either knows all this, or has gone out of his way not to know it.   And personally, I think it doesn’t matter…  I think Mankiw and other supporters of tax cuts will continue to repeat it their story.  And personally, I think we all are helping to encourage that kind of thing by not calling it what I think it is – dishonest hackery.</p>
<p>Update &#8211; I&#8217;m not sure what is goig on with all the question marks being added in. I&#8217;m away from home, and clearly I&#8217;m doing somethign different than usual.  Apologies.</p>
<p>Update 2 &#8211; Ken Houghton pointed out I was missing figures for outlays from 2002 to 2005.</p>

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Most of my posts have been data related.  I usually get in trouble when I shy away from data analysis.  Especially when I end up ranting.  But sometimes I rant none-the-less.  I could feel one coming on the other day… I read two very good posts – one by PGL and by Mark Thoma (no links because I think which posts I have in mind will become evident below).  And I had a rather frustrating bit of a debate with someone PGL has, on several occasions, referred to as a troll.  It all got me a little bit angry…  My thoughts:</p>
<p>We all have our biases.  Some of us believe X and some of us believe Y.  Now, most of us, even if we believe X, are capable of switching our beliefs to Y if presented with enough evidence that Y is more likely.  (What constitutes enough evidence may vary according to the situation, and sometimes contradictory evidence will appear later.) That is how we learn.</p>
<p>Now, some people are not capable of changing their beliefs.  They are deluded.  But, some people do not change their minds because they simply choose not to change their minds, or at least behave as if they do not. </p>
<p>Perhaps I am naïve, but until recently I didn’t realize this second group really existed.  For instance, if one’s life depended on believing the sky is green, most of us would be capable of saying, “Yes, I believe the sky is green” but few of us (I would assume) could truly will ourselves into believing it if we did not already do so.</p>
<p>We run into some such people in our everyday lives.  Perhaps more commonly, they troll at websites we visit.  Some of them have their own websites and magazines.  The most successful of them are highly compensated for maintaining the beliefs that they do.  The compensation takes the form of political power or influence, fame, prestige, and money.</p>
<p>Usually, not surprisingly, those policies go horribly, predictably wrong.  And then we get a round of easily refutable nonsense defending those policies and their results.  But the fact of the matter, these people either knew, or had the skills and the time and the information to know had they chosen, what the result would be ahead of time.  They chose not to know, and through their choice, caused a lot of damage to a lot of people. </p>
<p>Now, what about the rest of us?  Well, we pay the price.  But we are also partly to blame.  Because we treat the Harvard professor who advised the President with respect, even when we all know that he either knew what the results would be or he chose, willingly chose, not to know.  And we are partly to blame because we do not turn our collective backs on the dean of the prestigious Ivy League business school when he walks into a room.  And by the way we treat the rest of the ones who did everything they could in order not to know better.</p>
<p>When we treat them as honorable people, we are sending a message.  It is not a message that honest disagreement is OK.  (And honest disagreement is more than OK; it is vital.)  The message we are sending is that choosing to ignore the evidence is respectable.  In other words, we are reducing the costs associated with being a hack.  Together with the folks that make the benefits of being a hack so very high, we are making the Harvard professor and business school dean into role models.  We share the blame for creating the ones that follow.</p>

                                <p>AB reader Steve brings out attention to an article by <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/10/AR2006111001800.html">Lori Montgomery</a> who quotes some wisdom from Robert Rubin:<br />
<blockquote>You cannot solve this nation&#8217;s fiscal problems without increased revenue</p></blockquote>
<p>So why are some of the leaders of the Democratic Party shying away from this rather obvious statement?  Montgomery’s story starts with:<br />
<blockquote>Democratic leaders this week vowed to make the alternative minimum tax a centerpiece of next year&#8217;s budget debate, saying the levy threatens to unfairly increase tax bills for millions of middle-class families by the end of the decade. The complex and expensive tax was designed to prevent the super-rich from using deductions, credits and other shelters to avoid paying the Internal Revenue Service. But because of rising incomes, the tax is expected to expand to more than 30 million taxpayers in 2010 from 3.8 million mostly well-off households in 2006.</p></blockquote>
<p>Look – I’m not in favor of another sock to the middle class, but read further down:<br />
<blockquote>Getting rid of the tax altogether would be even more expensive: more than $1 trillion over the next decade, by various estimates. Budget experts doubt that Democrats can do it without reneging on their promise to reduce the budget deficit or winning an agreement from Republicans to raise taxes elsewhere.</p></blockquote>
<p>Someone in Washington has to lead on this issue – and for the past quarter of a century, it would appear that the GOP does little but pander with promises of free lunches.  Let’s end with some mumblings from a Democratic tax counsel named John Buckley:<br />
<blockquote>“The real story on the AMT is how it takes back the Bush tax cuts,&#8221; Buckley said. &#8220;For people who are married with children or live in states with income taxes, the tax cuts are temporary unless you fix the AMT.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>No!</strong>  The real story is that Federal spending has not declined so we never had tax cuts – just tax deferrals.  The real issue is whether we are going to have a tax shift away from the rich and towards the middle class and the working poor.</p>

<p><a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2006/11/what_happened_t.html">Mark Thoma</a> picks up on where <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/11/deficits-dont-blame-bush.html">we left off</a> regarding the latest excuse making for Bush’s budget fiasco from <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=ZGEzOWJhNTc2ZTg5MDEyYzA4N2YwM2MzOWIwZWI1ZmE">James Edward Carter</a>.  But Mark goes further in questioning some spin from <a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2006/11/what-happened-to-surplus.html">Greg Mankiw</a>.  Greg writes:<br />
<blockquote>The tax cuts amounted to $1.8 trillion of the $8.5 trillion &#8211; about a fifth. [Update: As several commenters point out, the added debt service is partly attributable to the tax cuts. The simplest correction would be to focus on the primary deficit by taking out the change in debt service. In this case, the budget swing is 7.2 trillion, of which the tax cuts represent a quarter.] Even that amount is an overestimate, because it most likely relies on static assumptions. A dynamic analysis that allows for a feedback of lower taxes to more rapid growth would reduce the share of the budget swing attributed to tax cuts.</p></blockquote>
<p>I guess it is inevitable in the aftermath of “big government conservative” George W. Bush that true fiscal conservatives would wish to blame these deficits on spending increases, but check out our first graph and tell me how anyone could think that it was a spending explosion and not a reduction in taxes as a share of GDP that was mainly responsible for the return to large deficits.  Now, I’ll admit that we could have lower taxes if we found some way to reduce government spending.  But conservatives should admit that President Reagan did not accomplish this during the 1980’s and that George W. Bush never even tried.  </p>
<p>So how did Mr. Carter come up with his spin statistics that Greg Mankiw fell for?  Well, let’s go back to the <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/showdoc.cfm?index=2727&#038;sequence=0">January 2001 CBO document</a> and look at projected Federal spending as a share of GDP, which assumed that it would fall to 15.4% by 2010.  I have no idea why the CBO was projecting such a massive reduction in spending as a share of GDP – but that’s the reason Mr. Carter and Dr. Mankiw would make their claims.</p>
<p>I have another problem with the Carter-Mankiw spin.  First, they tell us that it was weak real GDP growth that is partially responsible for weaker than expected revenues at the same time that they peddle the supply-side argument.  The CBO, however, projected 2.5% real GDP growth (not exactly a supply-side miracle) and that’s what we have seen since 2001.  So where is this alleged supply-side effect?  And why is Greg Mankiw trying to deny that lower national savings will crowd-out investment?  </p>
<p>In all fairness – I also have a problem with the Democratic spin that Clinton left George W. Bush with some massive surplus.  Not only does this spin rely on the unrealistic projection that Federal government spending would fall to 15.4% of GDP by 2010, it also counts those Trust Fund surpluses.  The General Fund situation really wasn’t that rosy in early 2001, and our pretending that it was may have been one reason why the voters trust George W. Bush phony promises back then.</p>

<p>Maybe we should revisit the post from <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2006/11/what_level_of_j.html">Mark Thoma</a> entitled <em>What Level of Job Creation will Sustain Full Employment?</em> where Mark noted:<br />
<blockquote>In addition, participation rates for workers over age 55 have been steadily increasing over the last ten to fifteen years offsetting some of the changes due to the changing demographic composition of the labor force toward older workers.</p></blockquote>
<p>Mark also reminds us of a related paper from the <a href="http://www.dallasfed.org/research/swe/2005/swe0506a.html">Dallas FED</a> on the decline in the labor force participation rate: <br />
<blockquote>the total change is decomposed into two parts: (1) the difference in labor force participation that is due to an increase or decrease in the group’s share of the adult population, and (2) the difference due to a change in the group’s propensity to participate in the labor force.</p></blockquote>
<p>When the Federal Reserve argues that we should simply expect a lower employment to population rate than was observed in 2000 as natural, they are focusing on the fact that the share of the adult population that is in the 55 plus age group has increased.  See our first graph.  The Dallas FED also picks up on another point, which is illustrated in our second graph:<br />
<blockquote>Another striking change in Chart 2 is the upturn in market participation among the 55 and over group. The increase followed almost a decade of flat participation rates among this group. What caused it? Research suggests that the rise in the labor force participation rate of older workers is due to a combination of factors. These include longer-term changes such as healthier and longer life spans, the decline in defined-benefit pension plans, changes to Social Security benefit rules, and the increased cost of health care.</p></blockquote>
<p>Higher cost of health care and a reduction in expected future defined benefits for retirement – is this what the Bush Administration is really up to?  Getting us old folks to work more by taking our Social Security benefits and handing them over to their base in the form of tax cuts for the rich and pork barrel spending?</p>
<p>Perhaps the aging of the population will eventually mean the natural rate of the employment to population ratio will decline over time, but the decline in the labor force participation rate seems to be from a decline for the kids as well as the 25 to 54 group.  But then we were told that Bush’s tax cuts would induce greater labor supply.</p>

                                <p>In a <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/10/real-tax-collections-per-capita-and.html">recent post, </a>I noted that the growth rate in real tax collections per capita is higher when a Democrat is President than when a Republican is President. I&#8217;ve had several other posts in which I noted that collections do not seem to be negative correlated with tax rates, but do seem to be correlated with proxies for enforcement. M. Jed, an Angry Bear reader and frequent poster in the comments section, believes that demographic changes may be what really drives changes in tax revenue growth. What follows is his analysis. (My response will appear in the comment section.)</p>
<p>My thanks to M. Jed for doing this work.</p>

<p>Using data from 1950 to 2005 from <a href="http://www.gpoaccess.gov/usbudget/fy07/sheets/hist01z3.xls">these </a><a href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/histaba.pdf">four </a><a href="http://www.bea.gov/bea/dn/nipaweb/SvrIsBusy.asp?ErrorNo=_999_What_Table#Mid">government </a><a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/categories/115">sources</a> , I ran a regression using ln(Real GDP) as the dependent variable. The explanatory variables were (a) ln(top marginal tax rate), (b) [ln(top marginal tax rate]^2, (c) ln(total people aged 45-54), and (d) ln(prior year’s Real GDP) – i.e., lagged dependent variable. GDP was chosen as the dependent variable to test whether reductions in tax rates, when controlled for demographics, induced higher output. I used natural logs on the time-series data because I would expect it to have an exponential shape to it (growing at a fairly steady percentage year after year, rather than at a linear rate). The independent variables were chosen to control for demographics and at the same time control for the time-series nature of Real GDP (over long period of times both population and GDP would be expected to rise) and to examine whether cutting tax rates had an impact on increased output. This demographic age cohort was selected because it is consistently the highest paid over the time frame examined, and I assume over large population samples pay correlates with output. The use of the squared term of the top marginal tax rates was chosen because Laffer hypothesized a curve (think Ax &#8211; Bx^2). Lagged terms are often added to time-series data because of the informational content in the prior period (think about what other information you would use to predict tomorrow&#8217;s temperature if you already know today&#8217;s temperature and could use that as one of your factors). The time period was selected based on data availability and to try to approximate the same time series of cactus&#8217; above-referenced post.</p>
<p>The regression fit was 99.7% as measured by the adj. R squared, though time series data typically has high fits because of the sequential nature of the data (as with daily temperature forecasts). The coefficients on (a) and (d) were positive and statistically significant, the coefficient on (b) was negative and statistically significant and the coefficient on (c) was positive but just barely missed the significance threshold.</p>
<p>So what does all this mean? Well, the regressions produce a formula to predict the dependent variable (in this case Real GDP). Because the regression formula is in the form of a quadratic (y= K + Ax + Bx^2), where x equals the top marginal tax rate, and because (a) and (b) have opposite signs, we can find the value of x for which GDP is maximized. This regression predicts that the GDP maximizing top marginal tax rate is 37.1%.</p>
<p>Additionally, and to verify my results, I also regressed total real tax receipts against the same independent variables. I also regressed the same dependent variables in one case using only (a) and (b) and in another using only (a) – (c). And for both dependent variables I also ran regressions using 5-year moving averages of the same data to smooth out the impacts of business cycles. In all of the regressions the signs on the coefficients remained the same. In using tax receipts, the marginal tax terms did not quite reach the significance threshold for the one-year data and four dependent variables, but did for the five-year data. For all of the other regressions the coefficients were significant. The fit was no less than 88% for all twelve regressions. The twelve predicted top marginal tax rates ranged from 33.7% &#8211; 39.6%, with an average and median of 36.2% with the GDP variable producing optimal tax rates about 0.5% lower than the average and Receipts variable producing optimal tax rates about 0.5% higher than the average.</p>
<p>So in conclusion, my analysis indicates that indeed a Laffer Curve seems to exist, that at today&#8217;s tax rates and demographics, we are probably just slightly above the optimum top marginal tax rate. Assuming the primary objective of tax policy is to maximize either GDP or tax receipts, we should probably not return the top marginal tax rate return to 39.6% and definitely not above that, but that said, there exists little statistical evidence for deeper cuts in the top marginal rate. And finally my analysis suggests that using single variable correlations, as cactus tends to prefer, can produce slightly misleading results.</p>

                                <p>While we had some <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/11/payroll-taxes-as-share-of-gdp-why.html">fun</a> with <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=YmY5MTI2MDA1OWRhYzljYjM2ZWEzNmE4Njg5ZWNhMWQ=">Kate O’Beirne</a>, <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/showdown06/archives/individual/2006_11/010188.php">Christina Larson</a> notes that Kate was referring to a poll run by <a href="http://www.clubforgrowth.org/index.php">Le Club for Rich People</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Meanwhile the Republican party faces its own, more painful, identity crisis. On the eve of the elections, Club for Growth polled 800 likely voters in 15 of the most competitive districts on the eve of the election (including 13 formerly GOP districts that went for Democrats). Two-thirds agreed with the notion that the GOP used to be the party of fiscal responsibility and limited government but was not today. By an 11-point margin, likely voters expressed greater confidence in Democrats to handle select fiscal matters responsibly. “We have lost our brand,” Toomey bemoaned.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2006_11/010190.php">Kevin Drum</a> writes:<br />
<blockquote>Get real, guys. The Club for Growth and its ilk have never cared a tenth as much about lower spending as they have about lower taxes. They know perfectly well that if a Republican administration actually cut spending to match its tax cuts it would get voted out of office for the next century.  And they&#8217;ve never cared. They just want low taxes (the easy part of fiscal responsibility) without the spending cuts (the part that gets you voted out of office). It&#8217;s similar to the GOP&#8217;s Iraq strategy: they want the glory of winning a war, but without the pain of making the hard choices it would take to actually do so. At the moment, the Republican Party is the Party of Magic. That&#8217;s the brand they need to fix.</p></blockquote>
<p>Le Club for Rich People pretend that fiscal responsibility and limited government are the same thing, but that’s just stupid.  OK, Phil Gramm might have been for both but St. Reagan never got around to cutting government spending.  So his 1981 tax cut was rightfully branded fiscal irresponsibility by conservative economists such as Thomas Sargent.  George W. Bush actually thinks one can cut taxes as he increases government spending.  Of course, Fred Barnes is goofy enough to approve of Bush’s big government conservatism – not understanding that “to spend is to tax” as Milton Friedman might say.  </p>
<p>The last two fiscally responsible Presidents happen to be our last two Democratic Presidents – Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter.  And better yet – both were more aligned to the Blue Dog coalition that would curb the growth of government spending.  And yet the Blue Dogs know we cannot make George W. Bush’s tax “cuts” (read deferrals) permanent as the GOP has no plan to cut government spending to any appreciable degree. Le Club knows this and yet they have promoted the free lunch BS of Art Laffer, which is the reason that the GOP abandoned fiscal responsibility some 25 years ago.  </p>
<p>Of course, my belief is that George W. Bush wanted to abuse Social Security deform to take away your retirement benefits, which is really a backdoor employment tax increase.  But <a href="http://www.prospect.org/deanbaker/2006/11/social_security_privatization.html#014444">Dean Baker</a> notes:<br />
<blockquote>One aspect of the election that the media have largely ignored thus far is the fact that Republicans who were prominently associated with Social Security privatization took a beating on Tuesday. At the top of this list is Rick Santorum, who actively embraced President Bush&#8217;s proposals. Last year, Santorum held town meetings around Pennsylvania touting the benefits of Social Security privatization. Last night, the people of Pennsylvania voted to send him out of town by a double-digit margin.  Clay Shaw, one of the leading proponents of Social Security privatization in the House, was also sent packing by his Florida constituents. Chris Chocola, an Indiana congressman who briefly flirted with Social Security privatization, was also soundly defeated in what had previously been a safe district. After Tuesday&#8217;s vote, the only politicians who are likely to be pushing Social Security privatization are those looking for a change of career.</p></blockquote>
<p>Thank goodness!  I guess Le Club for Rich People need to learn to deal with the fact that their plan to rip off middle class workers by handing over their Social Security benefits to the very well to do has been defeated at the polls.</p>

                                <p>As we were voting yesterday, <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=ZWFkMmQxMWQzYzE5ZGQyNjFhYjI4YmEzZTJiZDQ4Yzc=">Lawrence Kudlow</a> was writing:<br />
<blockquote>A series of late-October, early November surprises has turned the midterm elections into a real horse race. The bullish stock markets of recent months have been saying all along that a Democratic tsunami will not materialize, but now even a decent Dem wave seems a long shot.</p></blockquote>
<p>But as we argued <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/11/cheney-tells-kudlow-he-doesnt-trust.html">here</a>, the stock market is influenced by factors other than which party will win an election.   <a href="http://www.samefacts.com/archives/election_2006_/2006/11/money_talks_bullsht_walks.php">Mark Kleiman</a> was reporting on the Iowa Electronic Market yesterday:<br />
<blockquote>As of this writing, Republican loss of control of the House is 82 bid, 84 offered. That&#8217;s been trending up over the past week: the average daily prices since Wednesday have been 73, 73, 79,79, 80.</p></blockquote>
<p>But even as the Iowa Electronic Market was predicting that Nancy Pelosi would become Speaker of the House, the <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=%5EGSPC&#038;t=5d">S&#038;P 500</a> was doing quite well since the opening of business Monday morning.  Of course, <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3683270">the press</a> has this spin:<br />
<blockquote>The broad advance came as investors bought optimistically ahead of an election that could strip power from Republicans in the House of Representatives for the first time since 1994. Stocks often rally on elections as Wall Street bets change will lead to an environment more favorable to business; the theory on the Street is that a split in power in Washington will create legislative gridlock, slowing down regulatory change.</p></blockquote>
<p>Stock markets up – sign of a GOP upset?  Oh wait, the Democrats regained control of the House, never mind.  Then again, <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=NTk3MDJlNWMzZmNmNDczM2Y4NjgyNmZhYjYyYThkNDM=">Kudlow</a> comes back with:<br />
<blockquote>Look at blue dog conservative Dem victories, and look at Northeast liberal GOP defeats. The changeover in the House may well be a conservative victory, not a liberal one. Blue dogs are rabid budget balancers. At tomorrow&#8217;s news conference, President Bush should reach out to them, and to Republican base, with a spending limitation pay-as-you go proposal that gets to a balanced budget in a couple of years. Any spending increases (defense) must be offset with spending cuts (domestic pork). A spending limit paygo was used effectively by the Gingrich Congresses between 1995 and 1998, the high tide of their limited government period. And, this approach will head off a revenue paygo advocated by Pelosi, Spratt and Rangel that would lead to tax hikes.</p></blockquote>
<p>Good grief &#8211; I thought Kudlow was against paygo.  I guess if one is allowed to flip-flop like this from one day to the next &#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://www.danieldrezner.com/archives/002995.html">Dan Drezner</a> channels <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20061108/bs_afp/usvotemarketsstocksforexeuropeworld_061108113120">this tale</a> as the Pelosi effect:<br />
<blockquote>Global finance markets have wobbled on fears that a Democrat victory in the US Congressional elections could prompt less market-friendly policies in the world&#8217;s biggest economy.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2006_11/010176.php">Kevin Drum</a> objects and Dan replies:<br />
<blockquote>He might be right &#8211; but that conventional wisdom seems pretty widespread in the business press</p></blockquote>
<p>Funny – the S&#038;P 500 was up 0.21% today!</p>
