                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Reader Dan noticed <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/14/opinion/14mon3.html?th&#038;emc=th">this editorial</a> in the NYT:</p>
<blockquote><p>Consumer spending has been the powerful and dependable engine of the current economic expansion. Americans have continued to shop through boom-time borrowing, high oil prices, on-and-off job growth, uncontrolled medical costs, rampant trade deficits, hurricanes and war. </p></blockquote>
<p>Three dots</p>
<blockquote><p>Major American retailers reported April sales declines that were among the worst on record. The pain was widespread, including discounters, department stores and specialty shops. Wal-Mart, the nation’s largest retailer, had the steepest decline since it began reporting monthly figures 28 years ago. Government retail figures for April confirmed the slump, showing the first decline in seven months.</p></blockquote>
<p>Three dots<br />
<blockquote>When the initial reading on first-quarter economic growth clocked in last month at a weak 1.3 percent, there was a lot of talk about possible upward revisions in the months to come. Since then, news of a worse-than-expected trade imbalance has made a downward revision more likely. That would put economic activity well below the pace that’s needed for jobs and incomes to grow. </p>
<p>If consumers retrenched in earnest, a recession would be all but inevitable. The severity would be anybody’s guess, but two consequences would seem unavoidable. First, a consumer-led recession here could harm other economies as well, because spending by Americans accounts for a stunning 20 percent of the global economy. So far, as the American economy has slowed, the rest of the world has surged. But until last month, the slowdown in the United States was due mainly to the downturn in housing, not in consumer spending. </p></blockquote>
<p>three dots</p>
<blockquote><p>A recession would be most painful for people who have benefited the least from the current expansion.</p></blockquote>
<p>And then the NY Times goes nuts.  They follow up that last sentence and conclude with:<br />
<blockquote>That fact would force politicians to articulate an economic agenda that breaks with Bush-era policies — on health care, income inequality and social spending.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is way beyond the old &#8220;its a feature, not a bug.&#8221;  This is one of the key selling points for trickle down econ.  As long as you can keep things going for the folks at the top, eventually the folks on the bottom will get, um, trickled upon.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Regular readers know I’m not a rabid Democrat.  My own opinion, stated several times, is that the best that can be said about the Democrats is that they’re better than the Republicans.  Considering what the Republican party looks like in my opinion, we’re not talking much of an endorsement.  Still, I didn’t reach my conclusions blindly.  I looked at data.  Regular readers know that here at Angry Bear, we do that a lot.  </p>
<p>Now, one thing I’ve done on occasion is to look at performance by President.  Its simplistic, but when you look at enough series, it starts to tell a story, even if you don’t do it systematically.  And doing it systematically is hard &#8211; sometimes data goes back only to 1980, sometimes it goes back farther.  Sometimes I combined short administrations (JFK + LBJ and Nixon + Ford) and sometimes I didn’t.  Nevertheless, in every case, my sources are clearly stated, and almost every time, the data comes straight off a government website.  In many cases, I still have my spreadsheets lying around somewhere and you’re welcome to them.  Here’s what I’ve found so far:</p>
<p><strong>Economic Issues</strong></p>
<p>1.  <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/02/god-punishes-us-when-we-collectively.html">Real GDP less per capita</a>.  The fastest annualized growth in real GDP per capita occurred under JFK/LBJ.  It was followed by Reagan and Clinton, under whom real GDP per capita grew at about the same rate.  Then Carter.  Then Nixon/Ford, GW, Ike, and GHW.  Put another way… out of eight administrations, Democrats make up three of the four fastest growing administrations, and Republicans make up the four slowest growing administrations.</p>
<p>2.  <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/02/god-punishes-us-when-we-collectively_19.html">Real GDP less federal debt per capita</a>.  Because Federal Government spending is added to GDP, it makes sense to remove debt.  Going back to 1960, JFK/LBJ, Clinton, and Carter showed the fastest annual increase in real GDP less federal debt per capita.  The Republican under whom this measure of wealth grew the fastest was Reagan, and yet he achieved an increase of less than 60% as much per year as Carter.  (This was largely due to Reagan’s financing the growth through debt.)  I should note that in this same post, I showed that this happened despite the fact that the Federal Reserve generally had more expansionary monetary policy when Republicans were in office.  (Exception:  JFK/LBJ also benefited from very favorable monetary policy.)</p>
<p>(as an aside to 1. and 2. – I also looked at <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/02/god-punishes-us-when-we-collectively_16.html"> performance according to which party controls Congress</a>.  It turns out that growth is faster with Democratic majorities in Congress than with Republican majorities – regardless of the party affiliation of the President.)</p>
<p>3.  <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/11/national-debt-by-presidency.html">National Debt</a>.  Beginning with Ike’s term, the biggest annualized percentage increases in the debt per capita have occurred under Reagan, GHW, and GW.  (At one point, Republicans could have been described as fiscally conservative.  Clearly, that hasn’t been true at least since Reagan won the Republican nomination in 1980.)  </p>
<p>4.  <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/10/real-tax-collections-per-capita-and.html">Real tax collections</a>.  When debt is a concern, paying it off is important.  We’ve already seen that Republican administrations are less likely to grow their way out of debt.  So what about tax collections?  Going back to 1952, the administrations with the fastest annual growth in real tax collections per capita were JFK, Clinton, Carter, and LBJ, followed distantly by each of the Republican administration.  (The figure for Ike’s term – the fastest for any Republican, was just over one third the figure for the slowest Democrat – LBJ.)  </p>
<p>5.  <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/11/value-of-dollar-by-president.html">Value of the Dollar</a>.  The Federal Reserve maintains a price adjusted broad dollar index.  Data is available through Ford’s term.  Only under Clinton and Reagan did the dollar rise in value (and by more than twice as much under Clinton than under Reagan).  In November, when I did the analysis, GW came in third, ahead of Carter.  Given recent trends, I wonder how many people would bet on GW ending his term ahead of Carter in this measure.</p>
<p>6.  <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/10/healthcare-cost-increases-by-president.html">Health care costs</a>.  The face of healthcare changed a lot in the 1960s when JFK and LBJ created the “Great Society.”  Since LBJ left office, annualized real private healthcare expenditures per capita increased more slowly under both Clinton and Carter than under any Republican President.  (Even LBJ would have ranked third best among the Republicans, behind Ford and Nixon, but better than Reagan, GHW, and GW.)  And real total (public and private) healthcare costs per capita?  Once again, Clinton and Carter did better than any of the Republicans in the sample.</p>
<p><strong>Social Issues</strong></p>
<p>1.  <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/10/abortions-and-unwed-mothers-by-numbers.html">Abortions and unwed motherhood</a>.  Data for abortions and unwed motherhood is available going back to 1980.  In that time, Clinton is the only President in whose term there was a decrease in the number of births that occurred to unmarried mothers.  Clinton was also the President under whom the annual growth in births to unmarried women as a percentage of total births was the slowest – at less than one third rate under either Reagan or GHW, for comparison.  The yearly percentage decrease in the number of abortions was greatest (by far) under Clinton, as was the yearly percentage change in the rate of abortions per 1,000 live births.</p>
<p>2.  <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/05/looking-at-marriages-and-divorces-jonah.html">Marriages and divorces</a>.  With data going back to 1960, subtracting the divorce rate from the marriage rate, we find that the only President under whom net marriages increased since 1970 (when annual data is available) was Carter.  For the remaining Presidents, the rate of net marriages declined by less per year under Clinton than the rest of the Presidents – three times than under GHW, and nine times less than in the Nixon/Ford years.</p>
<p>3.  <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/12/sexually-transmitted-diseases-time.html">Sexually transmitted diseases</a>.  This one is more complicated – a lot of data, much of it patchy.  But rates of Syphillis, Chlamydia, and AIDS either decreased the most or increased by less under Clinton than other Presidents.  (Only for the former is data available going back before Reagan.)  Clinton also showed the second fastest decrease in gonorrhea rates, after GHW.  In fairness, the post also notes there might be a good reason for Republicans not to want to reduce the incidences of these diseases – as a general rule, GW did better in states where STD occurrence was highest.  It would be a lot to ask a political party to eliminate its own base.</p>
<p>4.  <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/12/family-values-and-young-peoples.html">Youth crime</a>.  Government data (childstats) goes back to 1980.  Clinton did (by far) the best job at cutting violent teen crimes.  (In fairness, it must be pointed out that only Clinton did cigarette, alcohol and drug use increase under Clinton.)</p>
<p>I’m pretty sure I looked at some other data sets… anyone remember anything I left off the list?</p>
<p><strong>Summary.</strong></p>
<p>For economic issues I’ve looked at, it seems to be a slam dunk.  Republicans simply performed worse.  On every measure.  Period.  End of story.  </p>
<p>For social issues… Republicans did better on teen cigarette, alcohol, and drug use.  GHW also managed to do well on containing gonorrhea, though not much else.  (And by “not much else”, I mean not only at not containing other STDs, but really, truly, not much else, whether in the social or economic sphere.)  Otherwise… whether reducing the incidence of abortion, decreasing teen motherhood, encouraging marriage, reducing the incidence of most STDs, or cutting teen violent crimes, Democrats did better.</p>
<p>I look at this list and a few thoughts come to mind:<br />1.  Its possible to explain any of these series as a coincidence or the fault of a business cycle or demographics or whatnot.  But all of them, or even most of them?  At some point, one has to conclude that either God punishes us for voting Republican, or Republican policies are simply more damaging than Democratic policies.<br />2.  This post is starting to look pretty long.  I’ll write up my explanation of what I think is  going on another post some time soon.  The short answer, as noted just above, is that I think Republican policies are harmful.<br />3.  This really looks like a book…  I gotta find the time to write it.  Or find someone who can do much of the writing.</p>
<p>Finally, two administrative notes.  One is to thank reader QrazyQat for asking that all my “President posts” be placed in one spot.  The other is to ask you all, the readers – what else should I be looking at.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;<br />Correction.  Reader John pointed out that several links went to the wrong place.  That&#8217;s fixed now.  Sorry.</p>

                                <p>Via <a href="http://blogreport.salon.com/default.aspx">the Blog Report</a>, this from <a href="http://www.correntewire.com/more_bizarre_behavior_from_bush_as_he_kisses_woman_orchestra_conductor_after_pretending_to_conduct_the_stars_and_stripes">Corrente Wire</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070513/ap_on_go_pr_wh/conductor_bush">Please don’t try to tell me this wasn’t staged</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>JoAnn Falletta was doing what a conductor should — concentrating on the orchestra in front of her. No wonder it took her a few seconds on Sunday to realize someone behind her was motioning for a try.</p>
<p>President Bush.</p>
<p>“Smiling at me kind of devilishly,” Falletta said.</p>
<p>She gave him her baton and stepped aside.</p>
<p>Gesturing exuberantly, the president led [yeah, right] the orchestra during part of its performance of “Stars and Stripes Forever.”</p>
<p>“We didn’t expect him to know the score so well,” Falletta said afterward. “<strong>He was not shy about conducting at all. He conducted with a great deal of panache.</strong>” </p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The article goes on:</p>
<blockquote><p>The musicians were impressed by how musical Bush was, Falletta said. &#8220;He was cueing the brass, he was cueing the percussion, he kept the tempo going,&#8221; she said.</p></blockquote>
<p>Until that last paragraph, I figured it was just another example of the free world acting like a seven year old.  But when others play along&#8230;  isn&#8217;t this how it works with Dear Leader of North Korea?</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/014117.php">Josh asks</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>When I hear Mitt Romney talk he sounds like a complete phony. Analyzing his record I think there&#8217;s a very strong case that he&#8217;s a serial flipflopper and a real opportunist. But that&#8217;s not what I&#8217;m talking about. His manner and voice and what he says &#8230; everything sounds extraordinarily canned and contrived.</p></blockquote>
<p>He is a flip-flopper and his words are canned and contrived.  Let’s take his promise to balance the budget without a tax increase aka a redo of that 1988 “Read My Lips, No New Taxes”.  His ad on this says he’ll cut $300 billion out of government spending.  Wow!  But that is $300 billion over a decade or a mere $30 billion per year.  Sorry Mitt – but the General Fund deficit is well in excess of $500 billion a year.  </p>
<p>But this is not what ticks me off.  What ticks me off is he does not say where he’d cut spending.  Certainly not in the defense department as he wants more defense spending.  So what does he say?  Nondefense discretionary spending should grow at the rate of inflation minus 1%.  A formula.  Never mind this represents a real per capita reduction equal to about 2% per year.  But no individual will lose any benefits from this as it’s just some magic formula.</p>
<p>Sort of reminds me of reading some of the worst nonsense from the most bizarre wingnuts out there.  And this guy wants to be our President?  He can’t bother to identify a single government program that he wants to cut or eliminate?  Just some bizarre formula with no meaning.  </p>
<p>I hope Greg Mankiw is reading this since Greg is supposed to be his economic advisor.  We know Greg is a small government conservative.  Greg – where would President Romney cut spending?  Isn’t it his responsibility to be more honest with the voters? Or are we going to have a repeat of Bush41 – promise not to raise taxes to win the election and then flip-flop on that promise.</p>

                                <p>For the past few days there&#8217;s been much breathlessing in the corner about Sarkozy. I don&#8217;t know enough about him to comment. But I found it interesting that this morning, K Lo asked whether <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=Mjg2OWIzMTIzNGNhOTRjODFlN2FiYjUyYjEwNmZkYTE=">the love affair is over</a>. She was referencing this article in <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article1784811.ece">The Times</a> of London:</p>
<blockquote><p>Nicolas Sarkozy, the right-wing reformer who becomes French President on Wednesday, upset both the United States and his opponents yesterday by offering the job of Foreign Minister to a Socialist veteran with anti-American credentials. </p>
<p>Hubert Védrine, 59 — a former senior aide to the late President Mitterrand — who served as Foreign Minister from 1997 to 2002, was considering the proposal yesterday. </p>
<p>The prospect of Mr Védrine running foreign policy has infuriated the beleaguered Socialists and amazed the diplomatic world because he is the architect of a doctrine for containing what he called the abusive “steamroller” of American power. His views on “the hyperpower” — the term that he coined in the 1990s — would appear to conflict with Mr Sarkozy’s pro-Atlantic views. </p>
<p>Mr Sarkozy approached Mr Védrine and other figures from the Left as part of his scheme to forge a slimmed-down government that will be politically inclusive and not limited to his Gaullist Union for a Popular Movement. </p></blockquote>
<p>As I see it, its way too early to tell exactly what Sarkozy has in mind. But I do remind the reader: our President said he was going to be a uniter, not a divider. Not too different from being &#8220;politically inclusive.&#8221; In addition, our President got a number of people who should have known better to little by little buy into his nonsense. (Big figures like Powell, smaller figures like Mankiw, and perhaps Védrine will do the same.) Finally, GW has shown no concern about pissing off friends and allies. </p>
<p>I submit that yes, the love affair is over. The Corner loves whoever GW loves, and GW can only love a poodle. But Sarkozy might yet turn out to be just like GW, in which case K Lo is not going to like him at all.</p>

                                <p>Apparently <a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/014108.php">Steve Benen</a> and I both made the mistake of watching <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18573163">Meet The Press</a> this morning.  Steve was particularly offended when John McCain said he would go back to the now infamous Baghdad market but this time with (edit suggested by K Harris &#8211; this should read without &#8211; or at least one won&#8217;t see the escort this time either) a massive military escort:</p>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s hard to believe anyone will be impressed by this misplaced bravado, but it&#8217;s worth remembering that the day after McCain took a heavily-protected stroll that market, 21 Shia market workers were ambushed, bound, and shot at the same location. Nevertheless, McCain thinks he can go for an unescorted walk in Baghdad? It&#8217;s as if he&#8217;s given up on being taken seriously altogether. When a once-proud man becomes a joke, it&#8217;s a sad thing to watch.</p></blockquote>
<p>While this was a low point in a rather pathetic interview, I found this remark to be even more despicable:</p>
<blockquote><p>And I saw it in Vietnam, the predictions, that everything would be a worker&#8217;s paradise in, in Vietnam if we left.</p></blockquote>
<p>I don’t think McCain’s five plus years as a POW of the North Vietnamese gives him the right to flat out lie.  I may have spent those five years in high school &#8211; but like many Americans my age, I grew to realize that the Vietnam War was a mistake.  Many of us thought about what we would do if we were drafted to serve in this mistake.  I never heard any opponent of the Vietnam War making such a claim.  But in case I missed something, I did a Google search on Vietnam War and Worker’s Paradise and came up with <a href="http://roborant.info/main.do;jsessionid=A6DBA057DA78CBD4D3B6C82EC702D753?entry=1261">this review of a 1983 history of Vietnam by Stanley Karnow</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The first thing that Karnow makes clear is that the whole thing started out as France&#8217;s fault. I had never realized just how brutal the French treatment of their colony was … It was only natural that Ho Chi Minh would use the distraction of WWII to start a movement to oust the French. I was also interested to read what a charismatic and patriotic man Ho Chi Minh was. He seems to have been a genuine hero of the people. Later, when he got involved with the communists, he was entangled in some pretty unsavory actions (totalitarian dictators have to murder to keep the people in line, it seems to be their only tool), but I think he always wanted the best for his people. He was never just a ruthless dictator for the power of it, as with Stalin or Saddam. The most interesting part of the entire Vietnam saga is that it didn&#8217;t have to happen at all. Ho Chi Minh was not a committed communist; he was a Vietnamese nationalist and patriot. He would have been just as happy to have America come in and help rid his country of the French as he would the Chinese or Russians. The US, however, was allied with the French and badly needed their help to stabilize Europe after WWII. So the US rebuffed his advances and he turned to the communists. Dean Acheson, Dean Rusk and many other figures from the Truman administration were clueless to this. They just didn&#8217;t see Vietnam as enough of a priority yet. The cold war was just getting underway and the battle lines weren&#8217;t yet clearly drawn. The French thoroughly bungled Vietnamese independence. They set up a puppet government in Bao Dai, but they only allowed a &#8220;thin veneer of independence&#8221; to his government. They continued to control the military and the economy. As the revolution developed, they would gradually lose their control of the country and as they did so, they would demand more and more American help (most money) to try to hang on. By 1952, ninety thousand Frenchmen had been either killed or wounded in Vietnam. France had spent more than twice the sum they received in US aid under the Marshall Plan on la sale guerre (the dirty war). After their horrible defeat at Dienbienphu in 1954, the French pulled out and left the US reluctantly holding the bag. Now that Ho Chi Minh was firmly allied with the communists, the only way to keep Vietnam from becoming communist was to support Vietnam&#8217;s sad excuse for a government. There&#8217;s no point in retelling the events here. The US would continue to try to prop up South Vietnam and try to keep Ho Chi Minh at bay for nearly twenty years, losing more than fifty thousand American lives in the process. The American military actually did pretty well, considering that the war was lost before it started. No amount of military prowess could have won, however, so they were doomed from the start. To me, the main reason the war in Vietnam could not be won was that the people of South Vietnam never really wanted to win it. Battered by decades of colonialism, then many more years of worthless puppet governments, they simply had nothing to fight for. They were friendly, in a sense, to communists because the communists promised to bring about the usual worker&#8217;s paradise. They would learn, after the US left, that the promised paradise was a disaster, but they couldn&#8217;t have known that in advance. The government of Vietnam and the US, on the other hand, never really offered them any hope.</p></blockquote>
<p>Maybe the North Vietnamese government made promises to the Vietnamese people that ultimately did not pan out but these were not the reasons why many Americans wanted to bring our troops home.  Of course, we were suckered into the Vietnam War by our fear of communism and the so-called <a href="http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9030881/domino-theory">Domino Theory</a>.  Even though the South Vietnamese government was a corrupt dictatorship, we had to expend tremendous resources propping it up lest all of Southeast Asia come under the rule of the Soviet Union.  Never mind that this fear did not materialize.  It was a stupid rational for war then – and yet McCain rationalizes staying in the disaster known as the Iraq War thusly:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think if we can show the American people some successes in Iraq and continue and expand on some of the successes we&#8217;ve already experienced in Anbar province and some neighborhoods in Baghdad, that I think Americans would &#8211; and if we do a better job, and that&#8217;s people like me, of explaining the consequences of failure. The consequences of failure, Tim, are that there would be chaos in the region. There&#8217;s three&#8211;two million Sunni in Baghdad.  The Iranians would continue to increase their influence, the Saudis would have to help the Sunni, the Kurds would want independence, the Turks will never stand for it.  Some people say partition.  You&#8217;d have to partition bedrooms in Baghdad because Sunni and Shia are, are married.  This, this is a very, very difficult situation, but the consequences of failure, in my view, are unlike the Vietnam war where we could leave and come home and it was over, that these people will try to follow us home and the region will erupt to a point where we may have to come back or we will be compating- &#8211; combating what is now, to a large degree, al-Qaeda, although certainly other &#8211; many other factors of sectarian violence, in the region.</p></blockquote>
<p>We can’t try alternative approaches because there might be Sunni-Shia couples?  McCain forgot about how that Domino Effect hysteria regarding withdrawing from Vietnam?  Al Qaeda is going to follow us here if we leave?  Never mind if we leave, Al Qaeda’s whole rational for stirring up trouble in Iraq evaporates and the civil war will likely turn on them first.  We have had a dishonest and incompetent President for the last six plus years.  We don’t need another, which is why John McCain should not be elected as President next year.</p>

                                <p>Hoisted from comments, just like Brad DeLong does.  Reader rollotomasi writes:</p>
<p>Let’s see &#8211; by virtue of having the right parents, I get to inherit a business that is reasonably expected to generate $10 million a year for me indefinitely to almost guarantee me a lifetime of wealth and privilege, plus provide me a ready-made management position if I’m so inclined, and for this I would have to pay the government $20 million total plus interest? The travesty!</p>
<p>I consider this among the right’s greatest propaganda achievements &#8211; to convince a significant segment of the population to feel sorry for those with 10 to 10 million times greater wealth &#8211; by using rhetorical devices similar to the terrorist with a ticking bomb argument for torture. It would seem there are about as many farmers and small business owners that have had to sell inherited assets to pay the estate taxes thereon as there are illegal voters for which Rove was using U.S. Attorneys and our tax dollars to prosecute.</p>
<p>At least Warren Buffet has his head screwed on straight about this. Here’s what he said about giving most of his fortune to charity and <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2006/06/26/buffett-estate-tax/">opposition to repealing the estate tax</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I love it when I’m around the country club, and I hear people talking about the debilitating effects of a welfare society,” he said. “At the same time, they leave their kids a lifetime and beyond of food stamps. Instead of having a welfare officer, they have a trust officer. And instead of food stamps, they have stocks and bonds.</p></blockquote>
<p>and:</p>
<blockquote><p>We have come closer to a true meritocracy than anywhere else around the world,” he said. “You have mobility so people with talents can be put to the best use. Without the estate tax, you in effect will have an aristocracy of wealth, which means you pass down the ability to command the resources of the nation based on heredity rather than merit.</p></blockquote>
<p>No better example of good money chasing bad or argument that financial resources would be better used by the government can be found than the right-wing, “old money” families and foundations from which the right-wing propaganda machine sprang. They have used their wealth to fund propaganda distribution outfits posing as think tanks and media outlets and to tilt academic study in order to foist their selfish, destructive agenda on the American public with eventually much higher costs to the taxpayer; the gift that keeps on giving, as it were. As far as any jobs being created, only the like-minded need apply.</p>

                                <p>I was reading <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/05/donald-luskin-discovers-that-aarp-does.html">PGL&#8217;s latest</a> and this quote by Donald Lusking caught my eye:</p>
<blockquote><p>According to the AARP, it is meaningless that federal tax revenues are already at an all-time high in dollar terms. The paper claims that revenues “are still below their long-run average, and substantially below where they need to be.” Actually, at an estimated 18.5 percent of GDP in 2007, revenues are above &#8211; not below &#8211; the 18 percent average of the last 50 years. They’ve only been higher than today in 6 of the last 20 years, and 9 of the last 50.</p></blockquote>
<p>I want to add something to PGL&#8217;s comments about this paragraph, especially because the 18.5% figure is a favorite of our resident troll (OK &#8211; he&#8217;s not our troll &#8211; we share him with other sites like Maxspeak), Patrick R. Sullivan. Since Sullivan and Luskin are always happy to use this figure to justify Republican tax policies, let me point out something very, very simplistic&#8230;</p>
<p>The table below shows the average revenue as a percentage of GDP for selected non-random blocks of years during Luskin&#8217;s last 50 year period. (Data from the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2008/sheets/hist01z3.xls">White House&#8217;s Office of Management and Budget Table 1.3</a>.) </p>
<p>It also shows the same figure for all 50 years, for years in which Republicans were in office, and for years in which Democrats were in office.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RkdS5BKmG1I/AAAAAAAAAMI/UHLD1hftOHU/s1600-h/receipts+as+a+pct+of+GDP.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RkdS5BKmG1I/AAAAAAAAAMI/UHLD1hftOHU/s320/receipts+as+a+pct+of+GDP.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;m not in the mood to do a <br /><a href="http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/prc/section3/prc31.htm">means test</a> right now, but Republicans do seem to collect less revenue. A few random oddities&#8230; the highest collections in the Nixon-Ford years occurred in 1969, the highest in the Reagan years occurred in 1981, the highest in the GHW years occured in 1989, and the highest in the GW years occurred in 2001. In other words&#8230; for Republicans, collections as a percentage of GDP generally dropped once they put their own tax policies in place.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the lowest tax collections as a percentage of GDP during the Carter era occur ed in 1977 and 1978, and the lowest in the Clinton years occurred in 1993. The highest collections occurred during their last year in office.</p>
<p>Put another way&#8230; if the goal is to maximize government revenue as a share of GDP, its best not to have a Republican President.</p>
<p>But in the end, who really cares about government revenue? What matters is whether people are getting better off or not. As (another) first approximation, we might look at real growth per capita, preferably after taking into account changes in the federal debt. And we already know <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/02/god-punishes-us-when-we-collectively_19.html">what that looks like</a>.</p>

<p>In his tirade against the AARP, <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=MjJhMDc4ZWE0NDQzOWI2NmIxZDc1OTY4MzNhM2NiMDc=">Donald Luskin</a> displays his incredible stupidity all over again.  But let me start where we might have common ground:</p>
<blockquote><p>In 2003, political support from the AARP was essential in the narrow passage of the vast and costly expansion of Medicare to include a prescription-drug benefit.</p></blockquote>
<p>Luskin’s main theme is that the AARP’s call for greater entitlement spending will raise your taxes.  He’s right.  But it’s odd that he forgot to add that George W. Bush pushed so hard for an overly bloated and inefficient (unless you are a Big Pharma lobbyist) prescription-drug benefit that he lied to Congress about its cost.  The President is also bragging about giving these benefits to seniors in the same speeches where he lies about cutting your taxes.  But here is where Mr. Luskin turns to either stupidity or mendacity.  He is claiming that the tax rate cuts increased tax revenues.  How does he make this claim?</p>
<blockquote><p>According to the AARP, it is meaningless that federal tax revenues are already at an all-time high in dollar terms. The paper claims that revenues “are still below their long-run average, and substantially below where they need to be.” Actually, at an estimated 18.5 percent of GDP in 2007, revenues are above &#8211; not below &#8211; the 18 percent average of the last 50 years. They’ve only been higher than today in 6 of the last 20 years, and 9 of the last 50.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, let’s graph the total Federal revenue to GDP ratio from 1957 to 2006.  Sure there were periods when this ratio was less than 18.5%.  After all, Luskin has included: (a) the second Eisenhower term where we did have a small government including a much smaller Social Security program; (b) the Reagan-Bush41 years where we ran massive deficits (aka taxes including deferred taxation where higher than current taxes); and (c) recession years.  Notice that in every year from 1994 to 2001, the ratio of total Federal revenue to GDP exceeded his 18.5%.  </p>
<p>Our graph goes onto to report Federal revenues not including payroll contributions (NIPC).  We do so because we have had a sizeable increase in payroll contributions to fund the increases in Social Security benefits enacted over the past half century.  When Luskin claims that the Federal deficit has declined since 2004, he fails to admit that the fall in the unified deficit came not from a fall in the General Fund deficit but from a rise in the Trust Fund surpluses.  If he wants to debate the AARP over the Social Security issue, this kind of rightwing mendacity undercuts any credibility he may have ever had (OK – Luskin never has had an ounce of credibility on anything).  But notice something about NIPC relative to GDP.  An 11% NIPC to GDP ratio is lower than almost any year outside of the Reagan-Bush41 years of rapidly rising deficits.  I wonder if Luskin actually knows this, but he’s just hoping those that read the National Review are too stupid to realize how dishonest his attack on the AARP really is.</p>

<blockquote><p>Last week, I sent e-mail messages to the 177 members of the National Bureau of Economic Research’s program on economic fluctuations and growth. The bureau is the nonpartisan, nonprofit institute whose macroeconomists conduct their own research and ascertain the timing of the nation’s booms and recessions.  The e-mail message had just one question: “Which factor was most important for the economy’s growth from mid-2003 through the end of 2006?” It offered the economists five possible responses:</p>
<p>a. The tax cuts signed by President George W. Bush</p>
<p>b. Pent-up demand following the recession, the corporate scandals and the invasion of Iraq.</p>
<p>c. Both (a) and (b) were important.</p>
<p>d. Neither (a) nor (b) was important; it was the regular business cycle.</p>
<p>e. There’s no way to tell now.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m shocked that any economist would answer this silly pop quiz.  While 49 responded, many responded by writing their own essay – that is, offering an answer not listed.  Good for them.  Alan Blinder and Robert J. Gordon noted the role of low interest rates.  But this was my favorite answer:</p>
<blockquote><p>Robert E. Hall of Stanford wrote that “the U.S. economy recovered from every single recession it ever had, so the growth in 2003-2006 was generally part of the normal cyclical recovery.”</p></blockquote>
<p>In case you are wondering, Altman lists the two economists who selected (a).</p>
