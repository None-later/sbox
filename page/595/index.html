<p>The federal Appeals Court in Richmond, Virginia, ruled 5-4 on July 15 that Bush had the right, while prosecuting the “war on terror,” to hold Qatari citizen (and Peoria, Illinois, resident) Ali al-Marri indefinitely as an “enemy combatant.”<br />&#8230;..</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;A citizen, no less than an alien, can be an enemy combatant,” administration lawyer David B. Salmons told the Appeals Court in oral arguments on Feb. 1, 2007, adding that the courts cannot interfere with the President’s wartime judgments on such matters.</p>
<p>Salmons insisted that Bush is not interested in using this power too broadly, but argued that the judgment on whom is deemed an “enemy combatant” must solely be at the discretion of President Bush. [NYT, Feb. 2, 2007]</p></blockquote>
<p>Did we miss something in the press and the election campaign?   What is your stance?</p>
<p>Update:<br /><a href="http://washtimes.com/news/2008/jul/18/maryland-troopers-spied-on-activist-groups/">WAPO</a> reports on another aspect and example of reporting suspected activities:</p>
<blockquote><p>Also included in the 46 pages of documents, obtained by the Maryland chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union through a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit, is an account of an activist&#8217;s name being entered into a federally funded database designed to share information among state, local and federal law-enforcement agencies on terrorist and drug trafficking suspects. </p>
<p>ACLU attorney David Rocah said state police violated federal laws prohibiting departments that receive federal funds from maintaining databases with information about political activities and affiliations. </p>
<p>The activist was identified as Max Obuszewski. His &#8220;primary crime&#8221; was entered into the database as &#8220;terrorism &#8211; anti govern(ment).&#8221; His &#8220;secondary crime&#8221; was listed as &#8220;terrorism &#8211; anti-war protestors.&#8221; The database is known as the Washington-Baltimore High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area, or HIDTA<br />&#8230;<br />Still, information about the protesters and their activities was sent to seven agencies, including the National Security Agency and an unnamed military intelligence official. </p>
<p>&#8220;Americans have the right to peaceably assemble with others of a like mind and speak out about what they believe in,&#8221; Mr. Rocah said. &#8220;For state agencies to spend hundreds of hours entering information about lawful and peaceful political activities into a criminal database is beyond unconscionable. </p></blockquote>
<p>As mentioned in comments, the issue is the quote of the government lawyer supporting the case, and reveals intent and expectation to me.  The decision was made on narrower ground but the supporting comment has not been removed.</p>
<p>Then we still have the expanding TLO training of first responders looking for terrorists and suspicious activity in training in Colorado as a beginning of new Homeland Security efforts.</p>

                                <p>The reason some of us note that Robert Samuelson is not a relative of Paul Samuelson has to do with his tendency to write <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/22/AR2008072202115.html?hpid=opinionsbox1">this kind of nonsense</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The specter of depression stalks America.</p></blockquote>
<p>I have heard lots of talk about whether we are in a recession but none of what I have seen says we are reliving the 1930’s.  This opening is akin to seeing a friend involved in a bad car accident and saying – “see you’re not dead, so cheer up”.  Samuelson continues:</p>
<blockquote><p>In June, unemployment was 5.5 percent, slightly below the average since 1960 of 5.8 percent … As yet, the present economic slowdown does not even approach the harshest post-World War II slump. The back-to-back recessions of 1980 and 1981-82 (as dated by the National Bureau of Economic Research) constituted, for most people, one prolonged downturn. Unemployment peaked at 10.8 percent in late 1982.</p></blockquote>
<p>Oh good grief.  At the risk of repeating myself, no one is saying that 2008 is as bad as 1982.  OK, my friend neither died in the car accident nor he was paralyzed for life &#8211; just several broken bones &#8211; so Samuelson would tell him to cheer up and walk it off.  And this average unemployment rate over the past 50 years or whatever is the standard GOP talking point whenever economists note that the employment to population ratio has declined.  It is nice to see that Samuelson would rather rehash discredited GOP spin than inform his readers.  Then again, Samuelson has to include this:</p>
<blockquote><p>The paradoxical thing about today&#8217;s economy is its strength. No kidding. Consider all the hand grenades lobbed at it. Higher oil prices. The housing implosion. Large layoffs in affected industries: autos, airlines, construction, mortgage banking. The &#8220;credit squeeze&#8221; triggered by losses on &#8220;subprime&#8221; mortgages. Despite all that, the economy hasn&#8217;t collapsed. It&#8217;s merely weakened. Output in the first quarter of 2008 was actually 2.5 percent higher than a year earlier.</p></blockquote>
<p>It is true that growth rates were decent for 2007QII and 2007QIII but that followed weak growth rates for the previous three quarters and was followed by weak growth rates for the next two quarters.  But hey – as long as Robert Samuelson can cherry pick some spin for the GOP, we should all be very happy.  So stop your whining!</p>

                                <p>By: Divorced one like Bush</p>
<p>Yes, you read that correctly.  The right is reporting there is money to be found in wind.  Sacrilege in their church of oil. In <a href="http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2008/05/17/wind_power/">an article</a>, May 17, 2008 we learn about a Bush administration report on wind.</p>
<p>A little back ground first:<br />
<blockquote>With major government investments in wind in the 1970s, the U.S. was poised to be a dominant player in what was clearly going to be one of the biggest job-creating industries of the next 100 years. As late as the mid 1980s, we had over 85 percent of the world&#8217;s global installed capacity, and U.S. companies possessed the most critical knowledge about how to develop wind farms cost-effectively. <br />President Reagan cut the renewable energy budget more than 80 percent after he took office, and eliminated the wind investment tax credit in 1986.</p>
<p>Since the turn of this century, wind has been growing explosively. From 2000 to 2007, the industry increased fivefold in size. Last year, $36 billion in wind investments were made around the world, with $9 billion invested in U.S.-based projects. In 10 years, it is expected to nearly quadruple in size. </p>
<p>In fact, because the new wind turbines are tall, and don&#8217;t interfere significantly with grazing or farming, they have become popular in the central U.S., where the wind resource is best in the country. Some ranchers make half a million dollars a year by leasing only a fraction of their land for turbines. </p>
<p>From 2004 to 2007, the company&#8217;s wind turbine production has grown 500 percent, and the division brought GE revenues exceeding $4 billion in 2007. </p>
<p>While the multi-decade drop in wind prices has stalled temporarily, prices for the competition have gone up the smokestack. New nuclear plants, for instance, have tripled in price. Analysis for the California Public Utility Commission puts the cost of power from new nuclear plants at 15 cents per kWh. It also puts the cost of coal (without carbon capture and storage) at more than 10 cents/kWh. That&#8217;s a major reason why, since 2000, Europe has added 47 GW of new wind energy, but only 9.6 GW of coal and a mere 1.2 GW of nuclear. </p></blockquote>
<p>The report: <br />
<blockquote>&#8230;the recent Department of Energy report, called &#8220;20% Wind Energy by 2030.&#8221; With improved efficiency and a decrease in capital cost, the report found that wind power should cost 6 to 8.5 cents/kWh, unsubsidized, even including the cost of transmission to access existing power lines. And the cost of integrating the power into the U.S. grid would be under 0.5 cents per kWh. This effort would only add about 50 cents per month per household, or under 2 cents a day. </p>
<p>The study notes that &#8220;few realize that electricity generation accounts for nearly half of all water withdrawals in the nation.&#8221; By 2030, wind would be cutting water consumption by 450 billion gallons a year, of which 150 billion gallons a year would be saved in the arid Western states, where water is relatively scarce &#8212; and poised to get even scarcer thanks to climate change. And on top of that, we get half a million jobs, of which nearly a third are high-wage workers directly employed in the industry.</p></blockquote>
<p>So, this is what could be.  Being that we are a “global economy”, our companies need to be able to compete, correct?  Here is the <a href="http://www.grinningplanet.com/2004/12-14/wind-power-wind-energy-article.htm">competition environment</a>:<br />
<blockquote>By 2020, many European wind farms will be generating electricity at 2¢ per kilowatt-hour, making it cheaper than all other sources of electricity.</p>
<p>Wind-generating capacity worldwide is growing at over 30% per year and has jumped from less than 5,000 megawatts in 1995 to 39,000 megawatts in 2003—an increase of nearly eight-fold. The fossil fuel with the highest growth rate—natural gas—grew at just over 2% annually during the same period. Oil grew at less than 2% annually, and coal at less than 1%. Nuclear generating capacity expanded by 2% annually.</p></blockquote>
<p>One would think that an industry growing at 30% would be far more inviting to the “free market” entrepreneur than one growing at 2%.   But, that is not where we are seeing money flow.  No, we felt it was wiser to spend it creating a democracy in an oil rich country.   Then again, in 8 years of neocon election policy and 50 plus 1 strategy, we have not seen any major news organization go after the 49% not being ideologically serviced.  Think that might have something to do with the policies we vote for?</p>
<p>But, back to the environment to be competing in:  <br />
<blockquote>With wind-generated electricity, the principal production cost is the capital outlay for initial construction. Since wind is a free fuel, the only ongoing cost is for maintenance.<br />Many countries in Europe are pushing hard to bring in more wind power. Here are a few examples.</p>
<p>The United Kingdom is requiring an investment of over $12 billion in off-shore wind farms that should satisfy the residential electricity needs of 10 million of the country&#8217;s 60 million people. <br />Tiny Denmark, which led Europe into the wind era with the development of its own wind resources, now gets an impressive 20 percent of its electricity from wind. <br />Germany overtook the United States in terms of wind-based generating capacity in 1997. Now Spain is close to overtaking the United States as well. </p></blockquote>
<p>As to investments being made, it is just as we are seeing in beer: <br />
<blockquote>Regulatory issues do not appear to have deterred energy companies from making US acquisitions. Energias de Portugal paid nearly $3 billion to acquire Horizon Wind Energy from the Goldman Sachs Group. The purchase doubled the amount of wind power operations in the Portuguese company&#8217;s portfolio. German utility E.On has agreed to acquire the North American assets of Irish wind power company Airtricity Inc. for $1.4 billion. Acciona Energia has acquired the wind farm development rights of EcoEnergy, a company based in Illinois. Spanish energy giant Iberdrola has acquired Oregon wind development company PPM Energy, as well as Community Energy of Pennsylvania, and more recently US wind farm companies Greenlight Energy and Orion Energy. </p></blockquote>
<p>But get this, Fox News titles their article: <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,203293,00.html">Denmark Points Way in Alternative Energy Sources</a><br />Fancy that.  Fox News says we can learn from the foreigners. <br />
<blockquote>&#8230;most of the Western world was subjected to an Arab-led oil embargo. The crisis forced Denmark, which was 99-percent dependent on foreign oil at the time, to develop an alternative-energy policy.<br />In the 30 years since, Denmark has worked tirelessly to develop new technology and new policies.<br />Twenty percent of Denmark&#8217;s energy needs are now met by electricity generated by wind turbines, and the proportion is steadily increasing. Thanks to advances in technology and turbine design, the cost ofwind power has been reduced by 75 percent since 1970, when the programs began.<br />The Danish attitude toward energy conservation means &#8220;people don&#8217;t have as many appliances, or gizmos,&#8221; said Griswold, a frequent visitor to Denmark. &#8220;Also, there are stringent requirements for insulation when building new homes. Every individual mandate like that means the nation uses less energy.&#8221;<br />A major part of that success is the Danish commitment to and attitude toward its energy policies, Griswold said.</p>
<p>&#8220;After the [1973-74 oil] embargo, Denmark had the attitude that they were going to become less dependent on the outside world and more self-sufficient,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And upon making this commitment, they&#8217;ve gained benefits, including lower national debt, cleaner air and less dependency on other countries.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Let me repeat the important part of that last sentence: <em><strong>&#8220;And upon making this commitment, they&#8217;ve gained benefits, including lower national debt, cleaner air and less dependency on other countries.&#8221;</strong></em></p>
<p>One final point Fox News wants us to learn: &#8220;Danes would say, &#8216;Thank goodness we have a government that plans so well that we are only minimally impacted.'&#8221; he said. &#8220;The average Dane isn&#8217;t terribly conscious of being in an energy-saving environment because it&#8217;s so natural to [him or her].&#8221;</p>
<p>Now there is a message I would have never expected Fox News to promote.  </p>

                                <p>Did I get the title wrong – isn’t this <a href="http://www.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/post-hoc.html">Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Post Hoc fallacy derives its name from the Latin phrase &#8220;Post hoc, ergo propter hoc.&#8221; This has been traditionally interpreted as &#8220;After this, therefore because of this.&#8221; This fallacy is committed when it is concluded that one event causes another simply because the proposed cause occurred before the proposed effect. More formally, the fallacy involves concluding that A causes or caused B because A occurs before B and there is not sufficient evidence to actually warrant such a claim. It is evident in many cases that the mere fact that A occurs before B in no way indicates a causal relationship.</p></blockquote>
<p>The good folks at <a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/2008/07/obama_campaign_mccain_flubs_on.php">Talking Points Memo</a> are having fun with this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Republican presidential candidate John McCain says Democrat Barack Obama is wrong about the Iraq war. But Obama&#8217;s campaign says McCain was wrong about the war&#8217;s timeline during a nationally televised interview Tuesday. Asked about Obama&#8217;s contention that a Sunni revolt against al-Qaida combined with the addition of thousands of U.S. combat troops that were sent to Iraq contributed to the improved security situation there, McCain scoffed.  &#8220;I don&#8217;t know how you respond to something that is such a false depiction of what actually happened,&#8221; McCain told &#8220;CBS Evening News,&#8221; adding that Col. Sean MacFarland was contacted by a major Sunni sheik.  &#8220;Because of the surge we were able to go out and protect that sheik and others. And it began the Anbar awakening,&#8221; McCain said, referring to the U.S.-backed revolt of Sunni sheiks against al-Qaida in Anbar province. &#8220;I mean, that&#8217;s just a matter of history.&#8221;  The problem with McCain&#8217;s statement — as Obama&#8217;s campaign quickly noted — was that the awakening got under way before President Bush announced in January 2007 his decision to flood Iraq with tens of thousands of additional U.S. troops to help combat violence.</p></blockquote>
<p>So what if the Anbar Awakening occurred before The Surge?  Couldn’t the subsequent surge still have been the cause of this Sunni revolt against Al Qaida under this Pre Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc fuzzy logic being employed by John McCain?  After all – under similar fuzzy logic, more defense spending and less tax revenues is the recipe to reduce the deficit!</p>

                                <p>I grew up in the South but I never remembered what <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/07/22/drive-70-and">Paul Krugman</a> noted with <a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,970938,00.html">this</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>DRIVE 70 AND FREEZE A YANKEE. That popular Texas bumper sticker epitomized the bitter regional rivalry of the 1970s, when rising energy prices impoverished the Snow Belt and enriched the Sunbelt.</p></blockquote>
<p>I recently sold my car and moved to NYC where I take the subway so I’m not as adversely affected by these high gasoline prices.  Paul also points us to <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20080722/us_nm/usa_gasoline_consumption_dc;_ylt=Ao5ZUscZPN01eEw3.TUAZiys0NUE">this</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Drivers in the South have been hit hardest by soaring U.S. gasoline costs and state governments there should take more steps to help cut fuel consumption, said a report released on Tuesday.  Average motorists in Mississippi spent nearly 8 percent of their incomes on gasoline in 2007 and drivers in South Carolina and Georgia spent more than 7 percent, according to the report released on Tuesday by environmental group the Natural Resources Defense Council.  Meanwhile, drivers in the Northeast spent the least amount of their incomes on fuel with Connecticut motorists paying just over 3 percent. Drivers in New York spent about 3.3 percent and motorists in Massachusetts spent about 3.5 percent &#8230; The report, called &#8220;Fighting Oil Addiction: Ranking States&#8217; Oil Vulnerability and Solutions for Change,&#8221; ranked the states for their setting of fuel conservation measures like incentives for buying fuel-efficient hybrid vehicles, slowing suburban sprawl, and targets for reducing driving &#8230; California, New York and Connecticut ranked highest in the report in the number of steps taken to fight consumption.</p></blockquote>
<p>California is leading the way in reducing gasoline prices?  If Los Angeles ever gets a real public transportation system – that would be great news!</p>
<p>The report can be found <a href="http://www.nrdc.org/energy/states/states.pdf">here</a> and it lists how some states have taken steps to reduce gasoline consumption.  Contrary to the comments from some of our rightwing friends, the Democrats have been pushing similar policy measures.  Alas, we are not seeing enough support for these measures from the Republican politicians.</p>

                                <p>King over at <a href="http://www.scsuscholars.com/2008/07/steins-law-anwr-and-oil-prices.html">SCSU Scholars</a> wants to tell <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/07/will-offshore-drilling-lower-gasoline.html">me</a> and the <a href="http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/servicerpt/anwr/pdf/sroiaf(2008)03.pdf">EIA</a> that our comparative statics analysis of the impact on world oil prices from the opening ANWR is flawed.  As I understand his argument, it has two components.  The main is as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>Stein&#8217;s Law, &#8220;If something cannot go on forever, it will stop,&#8221; came to mind to me today while reading a post on Angry Bear about ANWR &#8230; These very same people are the ones who contend peak oil will drive the price of oil ever higher &#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m not making any prediction as to the price of oil prices in 20 years so this appeal to Stein’s Law is just odd.  Future oil prices will depend on a host of factors other than whether ANWR is opened up so expecting EIA to be right about their forecast that the price of oil will be around $65 a barrel is not material as to their comparative static exercise that I have appealed to.  </p>
<p>King also seems to have a problem with EIA including a discussion that OPEC would likely reduce their supply if other supplies come on board.  He seems to argue that OPEC is less than effective cartel, which is true.  But even if the OPEC members follow the textbook competitive model, an increase in other forms of supply will tend to reduce their supply to the degree that the world price declines by even a small amount.  Would King have us believe there would be no OPEC supply response?  What kind of economics are they teaching in St. Cloud?  Oh wait – we get this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Something that adds 10-20% more to our own production and reduces imports of oil by 6% (both figures for 2025, again if you beleive EIA), certainly seems a reasonable first step, lest that economy be ours.</p></blockquote>
<p>Fine – we reduce imports but the topic of the day here was the world market price.  I see nothing in King’s post to lead me to question the EIA analysis.</p>

                                <p>Congresswoman <a href="">Michele Bachman</a> follows the tried and true method of getting published at the National Review – she lied to her readers (over and over):</p>
<blockquote><p>Like I knew it would, the American Energy Tour unveiled the truth about the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) — what Democrats in Washington don’t want the American people to know: This is a treasure trove of energy that will yield a lot with only minimal intrusion &#8230; The Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimates that there are 10.4 billion barrels of recoverable oil in ANWR &#8230; It gets better; the EIA has also stated that the production of this oil would create an estimated as many as 750,000 American jobs. At a time when our nation is hurting because of rising food and gas costs, more domestic energy and new jobs would give the economy a much needed boost.  The fact of the matter is that Congress is standing in the way of $2-a-gallon gas.</p></blockquote>
<p>Bachman failed to tell her readers that this same EIA noted the extra production would occur in about a generation – not today.  She also failed to note that this same EIA predicted that the effect on oil prices would be a mere $0.75 a barrel, which translates into about $0.02 per gallon.  Now I suspect most people know the difference between 2 cents and 2 dollars – but not the editors of the National Review.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://tpmelectioncentral.talkingpointsmemo.com/2008/07/another_oildrilling_myth_is_bo.php">Eric Kleefeld</a> has an excellent discussion of the National Review nonsense including a summary of the <a href="http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/servicerpt/anwr/pdf/sroiaf(2008)03.pdf">EIA analysis</a>.</p>

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>

                                <p>by cactus</p>
<p>So we&#8217;re moving into a new apartment and given its past 1994, we want/need internet access.  We called Time Warner.   They gave us an appointment for Saturday, from 8 to 10.  At 10:30, after sitting in the new and still empty apartment for 2.5 hours, I called.  They told me the appointment was actually for Friday from 8 to 10.  I noted politely that we wouldn&#8217;t have made the appointment for Friday from 8 to 10 for a number of reasons, not the least of which was that we hadn&#8217;t signed a lease then.  I also noted that nobody called us to ask us why we weren&#8217;t there, which presumably would have been done had the appointment been the day earlier.</p>
<p>So they gave me another appointment &#8211; from 2 to 4.  At 4:30 I called to ask if/when someone was coming.  I was told to stick around.  We finally left at five minutes to 6.  Put another way, I waited five minutes shy of six hours for no reason at all.  That&#8217;s six hours of my Saturday I&#8217;m not getting back.</p>
<p>Which got me to thinking about deregulation in the phone industry.  Its been twelve years since the 1996 Telecom Act.  I remember how it used to be when you wanted to get phone and internet service back in the day.  I called the local phone company, got a two hour window, and someone showed up during that two hour window.  Now, with deregulation, we have competition &#8211; now I can&#8217;t get phone and internet service not just from one but rather from two companies that won&#8217;t show up to provide me with that service.  One company that provides the service, even if its a monopoly, beats two that do not in my book.</p>
<p>Now, before someone points out that the service is better now &#8211; internet is faster &#8211; well, technology advances.  My guess is that the improvement in technology available to the consumer from 1984 to 1996 is more significant than the improvement from 1996 to 2008.  (Anyone remember using a BBS?)  And the improvements on the cell phone side of the business seem to come mostly on the manufactured hand-unit, which was never regulated because it isn&#8217;t a natural monopoly.  The rest comes from the switch, and that isn&#8217;t manufactured by the former natural monopoly either.</p>
<p>So I thought a bit about deregulation, and realized its not just in the phone industry that service has gone to heck.  How about them airlines?   And I understand that there were a whole bunch of people waiting out front of IndyMac the other day.  The fact is, in a lot of industries, deregulation has not lived up to expectations.  Not for consumers, but not for the companies either.  How many airlines went out of business in order to provide lousy service with a nickel-and-dime attitude today?  How many phone companies?  I&#8217;m sure its been a success story in some industries, but maybe it behooves us to think about how to do it so that it truly lives up to the many promises we heard. </p>
<p>And BTW, one more thing about Time Warner.  We called to find out when we could another appointment.  It seems the earliest they&#8217;ll be able to not show up again is July 27.  I bet this isn&#8217;t how the National Review, the Weekly Standard, or the Wall Street Journal describe deregulation in the telecom indutstry.</p>

<blockquote><p>The Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations will hold a hearing tomorrow on the way foreign banks have facilitated US taxpayers&#8217; tax avoidance through structuring accounts offshore to avoid IRS notice.  Senators Levin and Coleman released late today (Wednesday) a 109-page staff report that details their investigation into Swiss banking giant UBS and Liechtenstein bank LGT.   See Bradley Klapper, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2008/07/16/ap5223461.html">UBS, LGT aided US Tax Cheats, Forbes.com (July 16, 2008)</a>. The report estimates that approximately $100 billion a year has been lost in offshore tax abuses.
