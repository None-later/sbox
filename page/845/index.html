                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Any time you point out that real incomes are down over the past few decades, someone inevitably says: &#8220;But benefits are up.&#8221;  Presumably the big benefit is health insurance.  Below is a graph showing <a href="http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/hlthins/historic/hihistt1.html">percentage of Americans with employer provided health insurance</a> going back to 1987.  (That&#8217;s as far as back as the Census data goes &#8211; sorry.)</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RliEpSSzD7I/AAAAAAAAANA/cwNWG1sT3H0/s1600-h/percentage+of+americans+with+employer+provided+healthcare.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RliEpSSzD7I/AAAAAAAAANA/cwNWG1sT3H0/s320/percentage+of+americans+with+employer+provided+healthcare.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>What does this show?  Well, with the conspicuous exception of the Clinton administration, the tendency toward offering health insurance has fallen since 1987.  And probably, for most Americans with employer provided health insurance, co-pays and other employee costs have probably gone up.  (I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised, though, that for the C level officers of big companies, the it hasn&#8217;t.)  Sure, costs of health insurance have been going up very quickly.  So&#8230;  unless there&#8217;s some other very large benefit that employers are providing of which I, as a mostly independent contractor am unaware, when people say:  &#8220;Sure, real incomes are down, but benefits have increased&#8221; they are really saying: &#8220;Sure, real incomes are down, but providing health insurance to less people costs more.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aside&#8230;  Why the difference during the Clinton admin?  A few thoughts.  One is that under Clinton, <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/10/healthcare-cost-increases-by-president.html">health insurance costs rose by less than other Presidents</a> in the sample.  Probably related&#8230; Clinton&#8217;s healthcare initiative, while it failed, may have worried a lot of insurance companies, perhaps leading them to hold the line on costs.   I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if some tax benefits were thrown in as well.</p>

                                <p>Via <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2007_05/011380.php">Kevin Drum</a>&#8230; the Pew Charitable Trusts has something they call an Economic Mobility Project. They got together a few think tanks: those notorious lefties at AEI and Heritage, as well the Urban Institute and Brookings to look at &#8220;economic mobility and the American Dream.&#8221;</p>
<p>They just issued a <a href="http://www.economicmobility.org/assets/pdfs/EMP%20American%20Dream%20Report.pdf">report</a> well worth a read.</p>
<p>The good news&#8230; &#8220;economic mobility and the American Dream&#8221; are alive and well. The bad news&#8230; not in America. Using the ratio of parent&#8217;s income to children&#8217;s income, they find that economic mobility in the US is greater by a smidge than in the United Kingdom. Its less than in every other country in the sample. And we find its particularly strong in countries like Finland, Norway, and Denmark. </p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rlc6KSSzD5I/AAAAAAAAAMw/cJthB5YyiRc/s1600-h/Economic+Mobility+-+Pew+Study.gif"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rlc6KSSzD5I/AAAAAAAAAMw/cJthB5YyiRc/s320/Economic+Mobility+-+Pew+Study.gif" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>They also find that American men in their thirties today have less real income than men of their father&#8217;s generation.</p>
<p>Now what do all of those countries that are doing better than we are not have in common?  Oh yeah, Reaganomics and Supply Side economics.  Maybe these right wing policies just don&#8217;t work.  Which is what we&#8217;ve been saying (and backing up with data) here at Angry Bear for a very long time.</p>

<blockquote><p>This morning, U.S. Senator John McCain issued the following statement on Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton and Senator Barack Obama&#8217;s votes against emergency funding for our troops in harm&#8217;s way in Iraq and Afghanistan: &#8220;I was very disappointed to see Senator Obama and Senator Clinton embrace the policy of surrender by voting against funds to support our brave men and women fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan. &#8220;This vote may win favor with MoveOn and liberal primary voters, but it&#8217;s the equivalent of waving a white flag to al Qaeda.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2007/04/14/webb-mccain">Nico</a> reminds us of a conversation with Senator Webb who notes that McCain on the other hand pleas that we should not impugn the patriotism of the other side but then impugns the integrity those of us you think this war was a mistake on a routine basis.  </p>
<p>The good news is that <a href="http://electioncentral.tpmcafe.com/blog/electioncentral/2007/may/25/obama_rips_romney_and_mccain_mocks_mccains_baghdad_stroll">Senator Obama</a> fired back:</p>
<blockquote><p>This country is united in our support for our troops, but we also owe them a plan to relieve them of the burden of policing someone else&#8217;s civil war. Governor Romney and Senator McCain clearly believe the course we are on in Iraq is working, but I do not.  And if there ever was a reflection of that it&#8217;s the fact that Senator McCain required a flack jacket, ten armored Humvees, two Apache attack helicopters, and 100 soldiers with rifles by his side to stroll through a market in Baghdad just a few weeks ago. Governor Romney and Senator McCain are still supporting a war that has cost us thousands of lives, made us less safe in the world, and resulted in a resurgence of al-Qaeda. It is time to end this war so that we can redeploy our forces to focus on the terrorists who attacked us on 9/11 and all those who plan to do us harm.</p></blockquote>
<p>But it does appear that McCain can be even more <a href="http://www.johnmccain.com/Informing/News/PressReleases/b6b0b5fd-4e91-4219-95e8-6cec1be95074.htm">pathetic</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>U.S. Senator John McCain has issued the following in response to a statement by Sen. Barack Obama: &#8220;While Senator Obama&#8217;s two years in the U.S. Senate certainly entitle him to vote against funding our troops, my service and experience combined with conversations with military leaders on the ground in Iraq lead me to believe that we must give this new strategy a chance to succeed because the consequences of failure would be catastrophic to our nation&#8217;s security. &#8220;By the way, Senator Obama, it&#8217;s a &#8216;flak&#8217; jacket, not a &#8216;flack&#8217; jacket.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Yada, yada, yada.  Senator McCain is becoming increasingly irrelevant.</p>
<p>Update: <a href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/jonathanmartin/0507/McCain_responds_and_then_some.html">McCain aid</a> gets even more childish:</p>
<blockquote><p>And if you still don&#8217;t get it, a McCain aide blows away the anthill with, well, a rocket.  &#8220;Obama wouldn&#8217;t know the difference between an RPG and a bong.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/jonathanmartin/0507/Obamas_spokesman_doesnt_take_the_bait.html">Senator Obama</a> spokesperson replies taking the high road:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;America doesn’t need juvenile name-calling from Washington, we need a commitment to end this war and bring our brave troops home.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>So with all this back and forth, what did <a href="http://electioncentral.tpmcafe.com/blog/electioncentral/2007/may/25/drudge_makes_anonymous_mccain_aides_attack_on_obama_lead_story">Drudge report</a>.  The comments from the anonymous aide to John McCain – of course!</p>

<p>Martin Feldstein asks <a href="http://papers.nber.org/papers/w13114">Why is the Dollar So High</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The level of the dollar is part of a complex general equilibrium system. Nevertheless, it is helpful to recognize that the high level of the dollar is necessary to generate the current account deficit equal to the difference between national saving and investment. Understanding the high level of the dollar therefore requires understanding the reasons for the low level of national saving in the United States. Reducing the large current account deficit will require both a higher rate of national saving and a more competitive dollar. Although the necessary decline in the real value of the dollar can in theory occur without a decline in the dollar&#8217;s nominal value, the implied magnitude of the fall in the domestic price level is implausible. A decline of the real value of the dollar that is large enough to reduce the current account deficit significantly requires a significant decline in the nominal value of the dollar.</p></blockquote>
<p>In case some are wondering – hasn’t the dollar recently devalued – our graph shows the nominal exchange rate since 2001 and indeed it has.  Despite the fact that the dollar has devalued, we are still running massive current account deficits.  But with the current mix of fiscal irresponsibility and tight monetary policy, Feldstein’s analysis strikes me as spot on.  It is the low national savings rate that is preventing the real exchange rate from further devaluation.  Congress can pass all the trade barriers against China that the politicians can muster up – until we increase our national savings rate, significant progress in reducing the trade imbalances will not occur.  So my hope is that Congress stops playing the trade protection card and starts finding ways to reduce the fiscal fiasco created by the current Administration.  A change in the macroeconomic mix towards fiscal restraint and easier monetary policy would tend to devalue the dollar even more, but that seems to be a better way to increase net exports than trade protection.</p>

<blockquote><p>This paper develops a simple competitive model of CEO pay. A large part of the rise in CEO compensation in the US economy is explained without assuming managerial entrenchment, mishandling of options, or theft. CEOs have observable managerial talent and are matched to assets in a competitive assignment model. Under very general assumptions, using results from extreme value theory, the model determines the level of CEO pay across firms over time, and the pay-sensitivity relations. The model predicts a cross-sectional constant-elasticity relation between pay and firm size. It also predicts that the level of CEO compensation should increase one for one with the average market capitalization of large firms in the economy. Therefore, the six-fold increase of CEO pay between 1980 and 2003 can be fully attributed to the six-fold increase in market capitalization of large US companies. The model can also be used to study other large changes at the top of the income distribution, and offers a benchmark for calibratable corporate finance. We find a minuscule dispersion of CEO talent, which nonetheless justifies large pay levels and differences. The empirical evidence is broadly supportive of our model. The size of large firms explains many of the patterns in CEO pay, in the time series, across industries and across countries.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>As companies grow and expand globally, the value of the top executive can grow exponentially. In a study last year, two economists, Xavier Gabaix of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Augustin Landier of New York University, argued that the fast rise in pay of corporate C.E.O.’s mostly reflected the growing size of American corporations. Processing reams of data, the economists estimated that hiring the most effective chief executive in the country would, statistically, increase the stock value of a company by only 0.016 percent, compared with hiring the 250th chief executive. But at a company like General Electric, which is worth about $380 billion, that tiny difference would amount to $60 million. This, the economists argued, helps explain why that top chief executive earned five times as much as the 250th. “Substantial firm size leads to the economics of superstars, translating small differences in ability to very large deviations in pay,” the economists wrote.</p></blockquote>
<p>Relying on this summary, <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2007_05/011375.php">Kevin Drum</a> fires back:</p>
<blockquote><p>Needless to say, this is ridiculous. For starters, a microscopic number like 0.016% is probably just a statistical artifact. But let&#8217;s say it isn&#8217;t. Let&#8217;s say it&#8217;s real. It still doesn&#8217;t matter because it&#8217;s still plainly too small to be a predictable difference.</p></blockquote>
<p>When a reader suggested Kevin was being unfair to the authors of the paper, he later noted:</p>
<blockquote><p>Basically, I&#8217;m accepting Gabaix and Landier&#8217;s results here. If their research says 0.016%, then for now I&#8217;m willing to assume that&#8217;s correct. However, if that result is right, I think it&#8217;s ridiculous to interpret it as explaining skyrocketing CEO pay. If you could systematically predict who was going to deliver a benefit that small, that would be one thing. In that case, maybe the higher pay would be justified. (Maybe.) But the microscopic size of the difference in measured CEO performance makes that vanishingly unlikely. CEO pay has certainly skyrocketed over the past couple of decades, but minuscule and unpredictable differences in performance don&#8217;t seem likely to explain why.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’ve only skimmed the Gabaix and Landier paper, but it appears to me that the New York Times summary does not give their discussion justice.  Maybe the paper is worth a thorough read before we started attacking it.</p>

                                <p>The other night the Ex-GF took some time off and watched a documentary on the Tuskeegee Airmen produced by PBS which we got from Netflix. It was pretty good, and I would recommend it to anyone that wants to see it. </p>
<p>The Tuskeegee program was started in part to test whether it was true that &#8220;the Negro&#8221; simply didn&#8217;t have the aptitude, intelligence, courage, physical characteristics and who knows what else to become a combat pilot. Viewed from today, that&#8217;s a proposition that is beyond ludicrous. Because of all the racism they faced, those trainees the survived the program to become Tuskeegee Airmen were better than the average pilot, and their unit became highly regarded. </p>
<p>Now, consider a similar situation&#8230; throughout the 1940s (and beyond), there was a lot of discrimination against Jews as well. In higher education in the US, for instance, there were quotas limiting the numbers of Jews that could enter a university. As a result, in some fields, competition for those few slots became extremely fierce, and the end result was the extremely high proportion of Jews at the top ranks of many professions. I believe over 20% of all Nobel Prizes have been awarded to Jews, despite the fact that the even the Nobel committee itself discriminated against Jews (for a well-known example, see <a href="http://discovermagazine.com/2006/sep/einstein-nobel-prize/article_view?b_start:int=1&#038;-C=">here</a>) and Jews make up only about a quarter of a percent of the world population.</p>
<p>So one theory one might take from this is that one can identify groups by that are suffering discrimination simply by looking at which groups are outperforming. But that doesn&#8217;t work. Because &#8220;the Negro&#8221; was also being discriminated against when it came to education, but there weren&#8217;t a disproportionate number of Black people winning Nobel Prizes in physics or chemistry. In fact, one sign that Black people were being discriminated against in education might well be that a disproportionately small number of them were succeeding at the top levels of fields like physics and chemistry.</p>
<p>So&#8230; even for more or less the same ethnic group facing more or less the same challenges, disproportionate success (Tuskeegee airmen) and disproportionate lack of numbers (Black people at the top levels of fields like physics and chemistry) are both signs of discrimination. </p>
<p>Now, I like to test things empirically, and clearly, the paragraph above doesn&#8217;t lead to an easy testable hypothesis. So&#8230; what&#8217;s missing? How do we know when racism is evidenced by disproportionately large or disproportionately small numbers? When is one likely to happen, and when is the other?</p>

<p>Regular readers know I sometimes write posts on sensitive topics &#8211; religion, gender, etc.  Sometimes, despite my best efforts to treat such topics with the sensitivity they deserve, I fail to do so.  Please recognize that no offense was intended by anything written above, and I ask that readers in comment try to do the same.</p>

<blockquote><p>Q Thank you, Mr. President. You say you want nothing short of victory, that leaving Iraq would be catastrophic; you once again mentioned al Qaeda. Does that mean that you are willing to leave American troops there, no matter what the Iraqi government does? I know this is a question we&#8217;ve asked before, but you can begin it with a &#8220;yes&#8221; or &#8220;no.&#8221; </p>
<p>THE PRESIDENT: We are there at the invitation of the Iraqi government. This is a sovereign nation. Twelve million people went to the polls to approve a constitution. It&#8217;s their government&#8217;s choice. If they were to say, leave, we would leave. </p>
<p>Q &#8212; catastrophic, as you&#8217;ve said over and over again? </p>
<p>THE PRESIDENT: I would hope that they would recognize that the results would be catastrophic. This is a sovereign nation, Martha. We are there at their request. And hopefully the Iraqi government would be wise enough to recognize that without coalition troops, the U.S. troops, that they would endanger their very existence. And it&#8217;s why we work very closely with them, to make sure that the realities are such that they wouldn&#8217;t make that request &#8212; but if they were to make the request, we wouldn&#8217;t be there. </p></blockquote>
<p>As Atrios points out, there&#8217;s another thing catastrophic about us pulling out, at least according to the President and his remaining supporters. Namely, the oft-repeated narrative is that <em>we&#8217;re fighting them over there so we don&#8217;t have to fight them over here.</em> So if the the Iraqis ask us to leave, GW says he will pick up and leave, and then what? As Atrios points out, by GW&#8217;s &#8220;logic&#8221; that&#8217;s akin to sitting around and waiting for destruction.</p>

                                <p>I&#8217;ve been doing some work on satellites lately.  I&#8217;ve been meaning to make a comment about something for a while now, but I haven&#8217;t had anything except a snide remark come to mind.  For whatever reason, at this point I&#8217;ve given up trying to come up with something substantive, so I&#8217;ll go with the snide remark.</p>
<p>Kind of an odd fact&#8230; Al Gore once came up with the idea for a satellite called Triana.  It being Gore&#8217;s idea, there was enough political support to make it happen, and the thing got built.  It being Gore&#8217;s idea, there was enough political opposition to prvent it from being launched &#8211; the Republican Congress actually issued a stop-work order, claiming it was a boondoggle, but the Republican Congress was wrong.  The thing was finally completed, but they managed to prevent its launch &#8211; its sitting in a warehouse somewhere to this day.  (Storage costs are not insignificant for this kind of thing.) </p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triana_(satellite)">Here&#8217;s</a> the wikipedia entry, and <a href="http://www-pm.larc.nasa.gov/triana/NAS.Triana.report.12.99.pdf">here&#8217;s</a> something a bit more technical from NASA.</p>
<p>So now my snide remark&#8230;  I was thinking about what a satellite proposed by would GW be like.  My thought &#8211; it would have a built-in shovel.</p>

<blockquote><p>the House of Representatives passed a bill on a vote of 345-72 that would allow the federal government to sue OPEC for violations of America’s anti-trust laws &#8230; First, the obvious question arises &#8211; exactly how would the United States government enforce such a law? &#8230; Second, what exactly gives the Congress the right to impose its economic regulations on state-owned companies that, for the most part, aren’t doing business in the United States?</p></blockquote>
<p>Not being an attorney, I’ll grant these two critiques but when Taylor and Doren turn to economics, this gets stupid:</p>
<blockquote><p>Now, one might argue that the state can prohibit price fixing and collusion without prohibiting companies from having the final say over their own production schedules absent coordination between firms.</p></blockquote>
<p>The essence of exploiting monopoly power is to reduce production so as to drive up the market price.  When there are more than one firm supplying a good, the reason cartels are formed is that they coordinate their production to approximate the monopoly solution.  Only someone writing for the National Review could get an argument this wrong.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2007/05/23/news/economy/bc.usa.congress.gasoline.reut/index.htm?postversion=2007052316">Reuters</a> reports on the NOPEC bill as well as a second piece of legislation passed by the House – and the incredible lack of understanding of basic economics by our politicians just gets worse:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Democrat-led House approved legislation Wednesday that would give the Federal Trade Commission more authority to probe price profiteering from gasoline and other refined products &#8230; It was the second energy-related bill the House passed in as many days, after it voted Tuesday to give the FTC the authority to sue members of the OPEC producers group for price manipulation. The Bush administration has threatened to veto both bills, warning that they could pinch supplies.</p></blockquote>
<p>On the second piece of legislation, the President may be right assuming the U.S. refinery and distribution markets are competitive.  OK, I did have an earlier <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/05/record-gasoline-prices-and-refinery.html">query</a> on this issue but I don’t see the House Democrats making the case that price controls won’t create a shortage.  But if the first bill is supposed to go after a monopolistic cartel, then standard economic theory suggests the increase in production from ending the cartel behavior will lower prices.  So I can’t give President Bush a passing grade on this one either.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Regular readers know my opinion of the Democrats versus Republicans, if one can be monolithic. I think the former are often obnoxious and wrong, but they are marginally better than the latter. In recent decades, they have <br /><a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/05/comparing-presidents-comparing-parties.html">performed better</a> than Republicans, and the level of criminality seems to have been lower. (Compare, for instance, the Gulf of Tonkin and Monicagate to Whitewater, Iran Contra, and the scandal of the day in GW&#8217;s White House.) I could provide a few more reasons, but that&#8217;s not the point of this post.</p>
<p>What is the point is some disappointment setting in with the current Democrat Congress. Nothing unexpected, but still. I think corruption makes everything worse. Everything. And there is corruption in Congress. And by tolerating it, they allow it to get worse.</p>
<p>I recognize there are political realities. It may be political impossible to expel someone like William Jefferson, much less the various Republicans that are also being investigated by the FBI. But you can still shame and shun those that are corrupt.</p>
<p>If the Democrats want me to support them because they are Democrats, and not just because they are less bad than Republicans, then they have to do something to earn it. And its tough to do, because I would bet most of Congress has their hands in the till in some way. But we know who the worst of the worst are. The FBI is investigating a lot of people. I want to hear the leadership repeat those names, loudly, publicly, repeatedly. I want to hear Congressional Leaders talk about this, I want to see Congressional leaders stand before the entire body and point these people out. Weekly. </p>
<p>My father grew up in a very religious (Jewish) community. One individual in the community at some point had some connection with prostitution or white slavery. Nothing for which he could be legally punished, but there was a moral affront in the eyes of the community. My father was a kid and I don&#8217;t think he ever learned the details, so I, at thirdhand, can&#8217;t provide them. But my father tells me that the man was shunned. Nobody would talk to him. And when he walked down the street, people spit in his path and turned their backs on him. Not the sort of thing that inspired others to follow his example.</p>
<p>Maybe Pelosi and company can&#8217;t do anything legally about those corrupt individuals in Congress. But they can set an example for how such people could be treated. More&#8230; they should set an example for how such people could be treated. Of course, they could have done so while in the minority party, and the Republicans, as the minority party can also do it today. Spitting and turning one&#8217;s back isn&#8217;t necessary, but there are easy steps they could take to show us, the American public, they will have nothing to do with the corrupt. And nobody is doing it.</p>
