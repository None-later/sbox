<p>Lori Wallach&#8217;s <a href="http://www.internationalrelations.house.gov/111/wal031209.pdf" target="_blank">written testimony</a> before the Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation and Trade House Committee on Foreign Affairs on the subject of &#8220;U.S. Foreign Economic Policy in the Global Crisis&#8221; is worth noting.<br />
<blockquote>
<p>The devastation being caused by the global economic crisis to the lives and livelihoods of hundreds of millions of people around the world is not merely the result of bad practices by certain mega financial service firms, but the foreseeable outcome of one system of global economic governance – <i><u>or more accurately anti-governance</u></i> – that has been put into place and now must be replaced. </p>
<p>Over the last several decades, the U.S. foreign economic policy has been the implementation worldwide of a package of deregulation, liberalization, privatization, new property rights and new limits on government policy space, often dubbed the Washington Consensus or the neoliberal agenda. “Trade” agreements, such as those enforced by the World Trade Organization (WTO), and international agencies, such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, have been the delivery mechanism for this radical global experiment. </p>
<p>[Italics and underline mine.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anti-governance became the norm. As is customary, few blogs have actually looked at the latest round of Doha talks. Instead, we have had continued Pavlovian responses to anything that smattered of further liberalization. Here is Wallach&#8217;s characterization of those talks:<br />
<blockquote>Yet, even as national legislatures, the G-20 and other international configurations struggled to create new financial service regulation, many of the same people and governments are currently pushing for expansion of the current WTO financial services deregulatory agenda. For instance, President Bush’s November 15, 2008 G-20 Summit was supposedly convened to lay out a coordinated regulatory response to the crisis. Instead, the November G-20 summit’s communiqué called for completion of an on-going WTO Doha Round negotiation which has as one of its three main planks further financial service deregulation. </p></blockquote>
<p>It is refreshing to this reader to see such frank talk, talk that rarely enters the general media. Given trade representative nominee Ron Kirk&#8217;s recent statements, we can safely surmise that the Obama administration is listening. Paul Volcker, former Fed Chairman and now chairman of Obama&#8217;s &#8220;Economic Recovery Advisory Board&#8221; has also echoed deep concerns for the present account and trade deficits.</p>
<p>Wallach goes further:<br />
<blockquote>
<p>Few policymakers at home or abroad are aware of the myriad ways in which today’s “trade” pacts constrain their policy space on various non-trade matters. In part, this is because of the relative “newness” of this backdoor channel for domestic deregulation. Prior to the establishment of North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the WTO in 1994 and WTO in 1995, the scope of trade agreements was limited to setting the terms of exchange of goods across borders, namely cutting tariffs and lifting quotas. Proponents of the new expansive model of international commercial agreements branded WTO and NAFTA as “trade agreements” and attacked as protectionist all those criticizing these pacts’ overreach into non-trade matters. This rhetorical sleight of hand obscured the fact that these pacts were delivery mechanisms for a much broader economic package, of which trade liberalization per se is only one limited aspect. </p>
<p>And now we are living with the consequences of leaving our nation’s economic well being to be determined by private interests, who legally must focus on quarterly profit statements while operating under a system they helped devise that removes all obligations and responsibilities to the rest of us. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Remedying the current crisis, avoiding future such crises and achieving economic justice and stability at home and abroad will require a new system of global economic governance that harnesses the benefits of trade while removing the many non-trade policy constraints that are obstacles to ensuring markets operate in a stable and productive manner. </p>
<p>This is a practical matter, not an ideological assertion. </p>
<p>rules. For instance, firms operating in 39 countries, including all of Europe, that signed the highly controversial WTO procurement agreement and firms in the additional 13 countries who are signatories to U.S FTAs must be treated as if they were U.S. firms for certain aspects of even the covered spending. While there are some important exceptions listed in the U.S. schedule of commitments in these agreements that safeguard the right to use domestic preferences for some categories of goods, the United States altogether gave up its rights to provide preferences to U.S. firms regarding the construction and other service procurement contracts. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The United States has foolishly allowed a double standard&#8211;a higher bar for itself; a lower bar for other signatories to the procurement agreement:<br />
<blockquote>This sorry reality provides a different perspective on the hollering by Canada and the European Union (EU) against the stimulus bill’s Buy American provisions. Both the EU and Canada wisely excluded considerably broader swaths of their procurement activity from WTO rules and, in the case of Canada, also from NAFTA. Because of this, the EU and Canada have no obligation to provide U.S. firms with access to a wide array of their government contracts. For instance, while the United States safeguards its preferences (only) for domestic iron and steel used in federally funded state transportation projects, Canada carved out steel, motor vehicles and coal altogether (for all provinces, for all sectors), and also carved out all construction contracts issued by the Departments of Transport. The EU carved out of its WTO procurement obligations contracts awarded by federal governments and sub-federal governments in connection with activities in the areas of drinking water, energy, transport or telecommunications. </p></blockquote>
<p>Rarely are these details noted in many economic blogs or in the general media. Certainly, you will not hear Kudlow or Kramer discuss these issues.</p>
<p>And what is Wallach&#8217;s take on U.S. mainstream economists?<br />
<blockquote>For years, a brave few economists have reviewed the massive persistent U.S. trade deficits that have reached six percent of GDP, warned that such imbalances were not sustainable and called for an array of urgent policy actions before a foreseeably devastating “market correction” occurred. Over the past 15 years of WTO and NAFTA, as 4.3 million U.S. manufacturing jobs were lost – 1 in 4 of the entire sector – and U.S. real median wages sat at scarcely above 1973 levels, and income inequality rose to levels not seen since the Robber Baron era, a those same economists and a growing number of policymakers warned about the hollowing out of the U.S. economy and the need for new policies. As the United States became a net importer of food and saw its total agriculture trade surplus plummet and overall our major exports shifted to raw materials rather than value-added goods, a growing number have come to question the global economic system that could result in such outcomes. </p></blockquote>
<p>For a more complete discussion of GDP v net trade deficit, see my post <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/11/trade-and-gdp.html" target="_blank">here</a></p>
<p>How the world extricates itself from the liberalization model the U.S. itself blindly promoted is the question. Wallach&#8217;s entire testimony is worth consideration. I leave the reader with Wallach&#8217;s conclusion:<br />
<blockquote>Over the past century, U.S. financial regulation has shifted from strict financial controls over banking and capital markets following the Great Depression to periods of deregulation in the 1980s and 1990s. The WTO GATS locks in the U.S. status quo at a time of unprecedented financial liberalization, and exports this model worldwide. Whether this extreme deregulatory model is beneficial to most people – or sustainable – is no longer a contested question. Yet, absent changes to these international commercial agreements, governments worldwide could face daunting difficulties if they seek to reverse the trend toward financial service deregulation.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Regan revolution has run its predictable course. Ideology has been substituted for practicality and wisdom. They stumble who run fast. The fall now includes every country, including China.</p>
<p>Where the rules have been beneficial to some, do not expect them to surrender their advantage easily. In the long run, however, we all should reconsider how globalization has been fashioned. The means do determine the ends. Ends no matter how laudatory can never be achieved without proper regard to means.</p>

<p>The analysis of the crisis varies among the experts. I offer a precis of only two, offering more of my limited space to Professor Morici. Readers would do well to read all the testimony and sort out for themselves the root causes of the crisis in which the world now finds itself.</p>
<p>Simon Johnson sees the problem in terms of the weakness of balance sheets in the private sector.<br />
<blockquote>Households did not save much since the mid-1990s and reduced their savings further this decade, in part because of the increase in house prices; this was the counterpart of the large increase in the US current account deficit. Desired household saving is now increasing, at the same time that the corporate sector is cutting back on investments. The main dynamic is a fall in credit demand rather than constraints on credit supply in the US. Even entities with deep pockets, strong balance sheets and long investment horizons (e.g., universities, private equity) are cutting back on spending and trying to strengthen their balance sheets. This desire to save is creating the economic contraction we see all around us. </p></blockquote>
<p>He finds the February stimulus package he sees as far too small to do much.<br />
<blockquote>Besides politics, the main constraint on fiscal stimulus is the US balance sheet. The US balance sheet is strong relative to most other industrialized countries &#8211; private sector holdings of government debt are around 40% of GDP &#8211; and US government debt remains the ultimate safe haven. But with increasing Social Security and Medicare payments in the medium term, the national debt will only increase for the foreseeable future. The underlying problem is that fiscal policy was not sufficiently counter-cyclical during the boom.</p></blockquote>
<p>Peter Morici sees the problem as a result of confluence of issues, specifically the twin U.S. deficits:<br />
<blockquote>Most fundamentally, the recession, which may now become a depression without more effective policy responses, has origins in the interaction of changes in our banking and financial systems, energy policies and trade policies, and in the actions of foreign governments.</p></blockquote>
<p>The largest and most dangerous issue is that of trade imbalances:<br />
<blockquote>
<p>Some critics warned of the dangers of such large deficits, while others argued that the resulting inflows of capital represented investments in the United States and confidence in quality of economic policy and future growth of the U.S. economy.<br />The fact is most of the money was raised by borrowing or selling off fixed assets and was not new productive investments. Much was used to prop up consumption, and some was used to leverage investment schemes that proved more speculative than productive. Much was provided by sovereigns and near sovereigns who were merely looking for hard currency parking places for cash and safe political environments in the event political conditions changed elsewhere in the world. </p>
<p>The largest components of these deficits were net imports of oil, principally to fuel automobiles, and a growing trade deficit with China. In 2008, those components alone totaled 96 percent of the trade deficit. </p>
<p>The trade deficit on oil was the result of domestic policies that neglected domestic oil and gas development and that failed to fully exploit alternatives to conventional fuels and build out energy-conserving technologies. </p>
<p>Those policies maximized dependence on foreign sources of oil. Coupled with rapid growth and fuel subsidies in the developing countries of Asia, U.S. energy policies helped push up global crude oil prices and the U.S. petroleum trade deficit.</p>
<p>China controls foreign exchange transactions and manages the value of its currency. It set the yuan-dollar exchange rate at an artificially low value in 1994 and fixed that rate from 1995 to 2005. From mid-2005 to mid-2008, China permitted some modest revaluation of the yuan; however, this was not nearly enough, and the yuan remains significantly undervalued. </p>
<p>Since July 2008, the value of the yuan has not changed much. </p>
<p>The undervalued yuan provides Chinese manufacturers with a huge export subsidy and a hidden tariff on imports. </p>
<p>China is using its currency as a development tool, but this victimizes otherwise competitive businesses and their employees in the United States. In response to the recession, China has again frozen the level of the yuan and laid on additional export subsidies, seeking to export its recession in the worst tradition of Smoot-Hawley. In addition, China maintains high explicit import tariffs. Through these and other regulations, it essentially requires foreign manufacturers to locate in China to service its market and for their suppliers to relocate to China, further accelerating the decline in U.S.manufacturing. </p>
<p>This creates a pattern of international trade, specialization and production that confounds expectations for trade based on comparative advantage—the kind of trade that was expected to follow from China’s accession to the WTO in 2001. </p>

<p>In <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/03/pro-say-contra-delong.html">this post below</a> , I note that I find Brad DeLong&#8217;s analogy between the dot.com bubble, the housing bubble and the stimulus plan unconvincing.  The post is poorly written, but the point is that in fresh water models rapid technological progress is very different from a demand shock, and, so, if one added irrationality, the irrational perception of rapid technological progress is different from a demand shock.</p>
<p>In comments to that post, Jack worries that economists seem to be able to make equally plausible arguments for every conclusion (and so none must be very plausible).  I am not able to reassure him.  In particular I will now make an equally plausible argument for the position that we know for sure that demand shocks cause increased production.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure this argument has been made.  In any case the name to google (scholar) is Jeff Miron (whose name is on the Cato open letter against the stimulus).I can make the argument with one word </p>
<p>Christmas.</p>
<p>Exposition after the jump.</p>
<p>Every year there is a shift in consumer demand.  Demand is high during the dread Christmas shopping season.  In particular demand for big ticket consumer durables is very high in each and every 4th quarter compared to the other 3.  I argue that this is a predictable demand shift analogous to the stimulus.  </p>
<p>So what happens to production ?  Hmm somehow macroeconomists have managed to forget.  Macro economists generally use deseasonalized data.  Seasonal patterns are not explained in most models and so they are removed by a-theoretic methods.  <br />Thus the models aren&#8217;t taken seriously (that is this gets on Thomas Sargent&#8217;s nerves).  Worse, much worse, data are deseasonalized by government statistical agencies, so academic economists can avoid knowing what exactly was done.</p>
<p>I can try to guess what should happen during the Christmas shopping season and confront my guesses with reality.  I promise you, my guesses are reliably wrong. </p>
<p>First, I guessed that high consumption crowds out inventory investment.  In plain(er) English, firms make goods during the non rush seasons and store them for the Christmas rush.  I was *wrong*.  In fact inventories track sales.  As the Christmas season gets going sales and inventories increase.  Inventory investment implies that the variation of production is greater than the variation of sales (this is true of the business cycle as well as of the seasonal cycle).</p>
<p>Second, I&#8217;d guess that firms charge high prices (then very low prices in post Christmas sales).  This means that real wages would be low during the season and firms would be glad to hire more workers and increase output (this is a very New Keynesian type explanation).  This too is false.  Retail prices do not rise during the Christmas rush (in fact if anything they decline).</p>
<p>Hmm how about a labor supply shift ?  No people are desperately busy shopping.  If anything, willingness to do anything else (like work overtime) is reduced.</p>
<p>So what the hell is going on ?  </p>
<p>Flailing helplessly, I guess that there is typically excess supply of labor and goods and that prices are not marginal cost times a markup but rather average cost times a markup and that production is at a flat point of the average cost curve (this last should be true if there is monopolistic competition).</p>
<p>Imperfect competition in product markets is absolutely not enough to explain the pattern. Imperfect competition and small costs of changing prices certainly isn&#8217;t (they change prices just not in the direction that they should).</p>
<p>In any case, high consumer demand during the Christmas season doesn&#8217;t seem to crowd anything out.  I&#8217;d say that unless and until someone either shows it does crowd soemthing out or explains why the stimulus is different people should stop arguing that government spending crowds out private spending one for one.</p>

<p>Madoff is awaiting sentencing.</p>
<p>It is a reasonable trade-off, 30 to 40 years of life as a multi-billionaire  for spending the last 10-15 years of your life in a federal prison.</p>
<p>Maybe what the Judge should do is not  than sentence him to federal prison..</p>
<p>Rather what he should tell Madoff is that they have request to extradite him to Mexico or Saudi<br />Arabia or Yeman or Bostswana or Kazakistan and remind him that the local dictator in each of the last few  locations had their dollar dominated assets invested in his fund .</p>
<p>If Madoff does not want to cooperate with federal authorities and tell who helped him implement his Ponzi scheme maybe we should see if the authorities in these countries would get him to talk.</p>
<p>Sounds like a good trade-off to me.</p>

                                <p>By Spencer,</p>
<p>It is interesting how today&#8217;s report on nominal retail sales is being ignored almost across the board among the economic bloggers.</p>
<p>January and February retail sales are above the December low.  The three month moving average is still below the December moving average, but if the March report is decent the very low December report drops out of the three month moving average so the first quarter number is likely to be above the fourth quarter number.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/Sblp8LAMEqI/AAAAAAAAAsk/tcAagN4hYWs/s1600-h/Clipboard03.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/Sblp8LAMEqI/AAAAAAAAAsk/tcAagN4hYWs/s320/Clipboard03.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a>In January real personal consumption expenditures were 0.1% above the fourth quarter level<br />and this report implies that the January real PCE data will be revised up.  This and the good February report implies that in the first quarter real GDP,  real PCE could be higher than in the fourth quarter.  Since the plunge in real PCE contributed  some 3.0 percentage points of the 6.2% drop in fourth quarter real GDP this is a very good report.</p>
<p>Of course some of this gain will be offset by falling inventories, but this is the first solid sign of an economic bottom to show up in the data.</p>
<p>Part of the gain was a very strong pop in gas station sales, but even when you back that out,  the data is still showing signs of bottoming.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/Sblp0DlQbeI/AAAAAAAAAsc/Ot32bSiXiKg/s1600-h/Clipboard02.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/Sblp0DlQbeI/AAAAAAAAAsc/Ot32bSiXiKg/s320/Clipboard02.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a><br />Even if you back out gas station and food store sales you still get roughly the same results.<br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SblpuM2Am5I/AAAAAAAAAsU/55CdjniNz68/s1600-h/Clipboard01.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SblpuM2Am5I/AAAAAAAAAsU/55CdjniNz68/s320/Clipboard01.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a><br />This strength in retail sales probably stems largely from the impact of falling energy prices on<br />real incomes.  This together with the normal January increase in government pay, social security inflation adjustments and other transfer payments means that despite falling nominal private wage and salary payments in recent months real income still rose.</p>
<p>But it also means that the recent rebound in oil prices is especially dangerous.  If energy prices continue to climb it means that the recent pop in real incomes could reverse and this would make it extremely difficult to sustain this improvement in retail sales.</p>
<p>P.S. Technical note.  February sales fell -0.1%, but given the normal margin of error this means  <br />they could have been (+/- 0.5%). Since the first data is only a one-third sample often the most important information in the report is how last months data was revised. January sales were revised to show a 1.8% gain as compared to a 1.0% gain originally reported.</p>

                                                                    </div>

<p>In fact, I agree with DeLong and don&#8217;t even have a clear idea who Say was (don&#8217;t know his first name do know he wrote before Ricardo).  In standard economist speak <br />Say&#8217;s law states that output can&#8217;t be below the quantity that people want to supply given wages and prices, that aggregate demand must rise to equal aggregate supply.<br />This is frequently assumed in economic theory.  For decades there has been a heated debate among macroeconomists as to whether it is approximately true of actual economies.</p>
<p>DeLong argues <a href="http://braddelong.posterous.com/delong-opening-for-debate-with">(for example here)</a> that we know that Say&#8217;s law must be false because the demand increase due to dot.com mania and the housing bubble caused temporarily increased GNP.  The argument, basically, is that the governments money is as good as anyone elses and if government spending can&#8217;t drive up GNP neither can any spending.</p>
<p>I critique DeLong&#8217;s argument after the Jump.</p>
<p>Say&#8217;s law does not imply that government spending can&#8217;t drive up GNP (I&#8217;ve noted this repeatedly and it is a well known result in the literature).  Say&#8217;s law also doesn&#8217;t imply that all spending must have an equally low correlation with GNP.</p>
<p>First, government spending can make us richer, even if Say&#8217;s law holds, if public capital is more productive than private capital.  I will not discuss this possibility. Second government spending can make us poorer.  It will make us poorer if it is wasted or if government investment produces less valuable capital than private investment.  An increase in scheduled government spending is, thus bad news for people.  If leisure is a normal good, people respond to this bad news by offering more hours of labor.  If Say&#8217;s law holds, someone must take them up on the offer so hours worked and production increase.  </p>
<p>The many economists who predict 100% crowding out are not just asserting Say&#8217;s law.  They are also asserting that labor supply is inelastic.  It is very odd that they assert this.  However, assuming that labor supply is elastic matters little for the policy debate.  Under standard assumptions increased labor supply can cushion the blow due to increased public spending, but it is still a blow.  </p>
<p>DeLong&#8217;s interesting claim is that the same must be true of the dot.com bubble and the housing bubble.  This is just not true. </p>
<p>First it is possible to have GNP fluctuations even if Say&#8217;s law holds.  This is the original real business cycle (RBC) argument based on the idea that output is a function of labor, capital and technology and technological progress is stochastic and irregular.  </p>
<p>First assume workers have an instantaneous utility function which is the sum of a function of consumption and a function of leisure.  This means that exogenously  increased wealth (like winning the lottery) causes increased consumption and increased leisure (reduced labor supply) so leisure and consumption are both normal goods.  The rate of growth of consumption is a function of the real interest rate and the level of consumption (except in special cases where it depends only on the real interest rate).</p>
<p>Now assume that investment automatically equals saving minus the public deficit (Say&#8217;s law) and consider a growth model in which GNP is produced by a production function. Assume technological progress is  labor augmenting so output is a function of capital and effective labor (technology times labor).  </p>
<p>First consider steady technological progress.  In this case the ratio of capital to effective labor converges to a constant (call it k*) and the economy converges to a balanced growth path.  OK what happens if the economy is on the balanced growth path and  there is surprisingly rapid technological progress ?  The ratio of capital to effective labor is lower than k* so the interest rate is higher.  The salary per one unit of effective labor is lower than it was on the balanced growth path, but the salary per unit of plain labor is higher (it increases less than proportionally to the increase in labor augmenting technology).</p>
<p>The increased real wage causes increased consumption for given labor supply.  The increased real interest rate causes the rate of growth of consumption to increase.   For some utility functions, the high real interest rate causes capital accumulates quickly so the capital effective labor ratio is restored.  For one utility function (the pleasure due to consumption is logarithmic in consumption) per capita labor supply returns to the original level when the capital/(technology times population) ratio returns to trend.  This is not a new model.</p>
<p>Brad&#8217;s point is that there was an additional effect on GNP due to the bubbles.  First overestimates of the amount of technological progress due to the internet caused an additional increase in employment and output beyond that due to the true technological progress.  One could interpret the housing bubble as overestimats of the value of the services which houses would provide in the future (not the present as rents were observed) and therefore overestimates of the efficiency of housing services production via construction. </p>
<p>Brad&#8217;s claim must be that true technological progress can cause increased employment, but that the false illusion of technological progress can&#8217;t.  Huh ? Why not ?  </p>
<p>What matters for the model is what firms are paying in wages to workers and interest rates to savers.  For labor supply and output it doesn&#8217;t matter if the firms are living in a dream world and the bubble will burst.</p>
<p>Now the RBC models assume rational expectations, so the bursting of the bubbles would convince me that such models are terrible approximations to reality (except I always believed that) but the expansion in response to a perceived improvement in technology is totally exactly what the models predict.</p>
<p>I guess DeLong&#8217;s point is that the path of employment can&#8217;t be explained as the result of optimization of a function of consumption and leisure given actual data on hours worked, consumption, real wages and real interest rates (now observable with TIPS).  I agree, but that has nothing in particular to do with those episodes and has nothing to do with an analogy between private spending on investment and expansionary fiscal policy.</p>

<p>Who will lead the charge to install IT in physician offices?</p>
<p>Sam&#8217;s Club and Dell.</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>Sam&#8217;s Club will partner with Dell and eClinicWorks for software, hardware, training and maintenance. No joke.</p>
<p>The system will integrate patient appointments and billing (the billing modules are ultra-complex and carry significant risk of major problems).</p>
<p>Wal-Mart has some experience with health care IT, primarily in pharmacy and optometry. WM also has used the software in a limited number of redi-clinic settings (which are much different than a regular physician office).</p>
<p>Does Wal-Mart understand the complexities of physician office operation and the vagaries of dealing with physicians?</p>
<p>The $20B stimulus money had to attract a lot of vendors, this may be the surprise leader of the pack.</p>
<p>Tires, lettuce, underwear, health IT. Such a concept.</p>

<p>The following three Tables are copied from the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hks.harvard.edu/jeffreyliebman/lms_nonpartisan_plan_description.pdf">Liebman-MacGuineas-Samwick Non-Partisan Social Security Reform Plan</a> to make a couple of points. One is that the plan authors are just not that into you, that is if you are a wage worker seeking a more comfortable retirement. They see crisis from a much different standpoint. Discussion under the fold.<br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/Sbf30exknaI/AAAAAAAAAHA/uWUVvI1Y_w4/s1600-h/LMS_Table1.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/Sbf30exknaI/AAAAAAAAAHA/uWUVvI1Y_w4/s400/LMS_Table1.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/Sbf30DKSiII/AAAAAAAAAGw/IsCHZUWrKrE/s1600-h/LMS_Table2.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/Sbf30DKSiII/AAAAAAAAAGw/IsCHZUWrKrE/s400/LMS_Table2.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/Sbf30JpcGYI/AAAAAAAAAG4/P13L3Ec682I/s1600-h/LMS_Table+2.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/Sbf30JpcGYI/AAAAAAAAAG4/P13L3Ec682I/s400/LMS_Table+2.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />For workers &#8216;crisis&#8217; is normally defined as a cut in retirement benefits at some point in the future. In its more invidious form this translates into &#8216;Social Security will not be there for me&#8217;, i.e. &#8216;no check&#8217;. Well this can&#8217;t happen, as long as FICA payroll tax is being collected and dedicated to Social Security then checks at some level will still continue to go out. Still the Trustees tell us in the 2008 Report that benefits after 2041 will only be 78% of those payable in 2040. They further tell us that we could backfill that gap with a 1.7% immediate increase in payroll tax split between employer and employee or roughly double that if we wait until the last minute. LMS was published in Dec 2005 and the numbers were a little different, at that point the Trustees told us that benefits after 2041 would only be 76% of those payable in 2040 unless we raised payroll tax immediately by 1.92%. (The reason why the projected gap shrank and so the cost of the fix from 2005 to 2008 is a good question for another time.)</p>
<p>If we look at Table 1 we clearly see that the authors of LMS are not first and foremost concerned with a better check, not at least for the typical situation where the male earner predeceases the female earner. LMS freely accepts that lower earners will have to take a 4-15% cut relative to the schedule and that single earners at all levels will take a net 9-15% cut. At first glance it looks like only high income two earning couples make out. But even that is deceiving as we will see.</p>
<p>Now some might give the authors the benefit of the doubt and point out that 85% is better than (then) 76%. A look at Table 2 will disabuse you of that notion. Under 2005 projections we could provide a 100% result with a 1.92% increase or in other words an improvement of 24 points. Which suggests we could get about a 12 point jump with a 1.0% increase or an 88% result. Meaning for the low income one earner couple they could get a better result just by accepting the provision for a payroll cap increase (here called &#8216;raise taxable minimum&#8217;) which is scored at 1.0%. Or they could close even more of the gap by just accepting an increase in retirement age which is scored at .62%. Those two provisions alone reduced the projected gap down to 0.30% which for a low earning couple making $30,000 translates to $90 per year. That is raise the cap, increase retirement age, and pay less than $2 a week and &#8216;crisis&#8217; defined as &#8216;benefit cut compared to the schedule&#8217; just vanishes.</p>
<p>But is worse than that. What Table 2 doesn&#8217;t show is the provision that would directly raise payroll by 1.5% ANYWAY. Which itself would generate about 18 points of improvement meaning that everyone would get a (74+18=) 92% benefit just from the proposed tax increase. In fact lower and medium level workers would get a better deal just by cutting that tax increase by 33% to 1.0% and raising the cap for another 1.0%. Boom! that 1.92% payroll gap would be more than erased. And the point only gets sharper if you substitute the current 1.7% gap.</p>
<p>So what do lower income workers gain from LMS and its PRAs? Well nothing really, and even that assumes 6.5% real returns on equities. Instead they are promised 2.7% in combined benefit cuts plus 1.5% in tax increases so as maybe to backfill about a third of the benefit cut that &#8220;Nothing&#8221; promises them today. You don&#8217;t have to be a math genius to understand that throwing 4.2% of combined payroll equivalent at a problem scored at 1.92% and only closing 9 points of a 24 point gap is not really serving your interest. (And that is not considering the adverse effects resulting from raising the payroll cap.)</p>
<p>In fact the calculations don&#8217;t change much as you move up the income ladder. While the higher income double earning household ends up with a 127% result that comes at the price of paying an extra 1.5% on income up to the existing cap and then 12.4% on income up to the proposed cap.</p>
<p>So &#8216;cui bono&#8217;. Obviously the authors are not defining &#8216;crisis&#8217; in terms of actual wage worker retirement security, because those workers could get better results at much lower costs, clearly they really are not that into us. So for them what is the definition of &#8216;crisis&#8217;? Well a look at Table 3 gives you the needed hint. The table is a little confusing so lets allow the authors to explain it in their own words (with some bolding by me)<br />
<blockquote>Fiscally responsible plan – The plan puts great emphasis on fiscal responsibility – borrowing less from general revenues than any other plan that has been scored by the Social Security actuaries in recent years.  Table 3 compares the LMS plan with other recent Social Security reform plan.  The first column compares general fund transfers to the OASDI Trust Funds.  This is one measure of how much a plan relies upon unspecified resources from outside of Social Security to bring the system into balance.  The LMS plan does not rely at all on general fund transfers, and instead uses changes to benefits and revenues to bring Social Security into balance.  The second column shows the sum of all Social Security cash-flow deficits.  In years in which Social Security benefits exceed revenues, the shortfall must be made up by the general funds of the government either through reductions in other government spending, increases in taxes, or issuing additional debt.  Paying all currently scheduled benefits would require the rest of the government to come up with $6,372 billion in funds over the next 75 years.  Under the LMS plan this number is reduced to $1,456 billion.   None of the other 18 other plans scored by the Office of the Actuary in the past three years has lower cash-flow deficits than the LMS plan.</p></blockquote>
<p>Clearly for the authors of LMS the definition of &#8216;Social Security crisis&#8217; is simply the demands it MIGHT make on the General Fund going forward. (Because of course we could just proceed with a plan of &#8220;Nothing&#8221; and just take our lumps in 2041 (SSA IC) or 2049 (CBO IC) or never (SSA LC)).</p>
<p>Now defenders of LMS might jump into point out that PRAs allow a form if inheritable rights that current Social Security doesn&#8217;t. But the devil is in the details. The authors again:<br />
<blockquote>All payments from PRAs would be paid as annuities, which would initially be required to be fixed, inflation-indexed annuities provided by the Social Security Administration as part of a beneficiary’s regular Social Security benefit.  Full annuitization by age 68 is required, but beneficiaries can choose to spread annuitization between 62 and 68 if so desired.  Married beneficiaries would be required to purchase joint and two-thirds survivor annuities.  Annuities would be 10-year certain annuities to provide payouts to heirs of those who die soon after annuitization.  The total balances in the accounts of the two spouses in a married couple would be split equally in the case of divorce. </p>
<p>Investment options are restricted and full annuitization is required because Social Security is meant to provide a basic level of retirement income support.  For an average earner, the combination of the traditional benefit and PRA annuity will provide a replacement rate of about 35 percent.</p></blockquote>
<p> Hmm so the average working couple (who don&#8217;t happen to die within 10 years of retirement) will have a government issued, inflation adjusted check replacing around 35% of their pre-retirement income. With no inhertable property right. Which sounds a heck of a lot like traditional Social Security. But at least you would be able to control your investments, wouldn&#8217;t you? Well not really.<br />
<blockquote>In order to keep total expected retirement benefits at levels comparable to those specified in current law, the LMS plan establishes personal retirement accounts equal to 3 percent of taxable payroll (using the current-law maximum as the cap).    <br />The investment options for PRAs are designed to limit administrative costs and the risks to investors.  PRAs would be invested with one of 15 private fund companies certified by the government to be eligible to receive PRA deposits.  Each of these fund companies would be required to offer 5 broadly diversified investment options, patterned after the Federal Employee Thrift Savings Program.  A central clearing house would handle transactions.  Social Security actuaries estimate that administrative charges associated with PRAs would be approximately 30 basis points per year.</p></blockquote>
<p> Why not just open the Federal Thrift Savings Program to everyone? With the Social Security Administration acting as that &#8216;central clearing house&#8217;?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think that Liebman and MacGuineas at least were motivated by simple ideological hostility to the New Deal, Liebman after all taking posts in both the Clinton and Obama Administrations and <a href="http://www.crfb.org/html/aboutStaff.htm">Maya MacGuineas</a> just being a centrist deficit hawk. For that matter I don&#8217;t think even Samwick is driven by anything other than a commitment to traditional market economics that reflexively prefers private to public solutions, even as here where the &#8216;private&#8217; is more or less symbolic. But what is clear is that none of them are driven by some progressive impulse to improve the economic condition of wage workers now or in retirement.</p>
<p>Conclusion. When someone comes up to you and claims that Social Security is in &#8216;crisis&#8217; and needs &#8216;reform&#8217; you should be asking them three questions: how do they define &#8216;crisis&#8217;, what do I get out of their &#8216;reform&#8217;, and what is it going to cost me. And that is not class warfare or denial or anything else. It is instead just a market transaction, make  the cost/benefit case for why a societal problem scored at 1.92% or 1.7% of payroll needs to be paid for by a combined 5.2% package paid for exclusively by wage workers.</p>
<p>(And no, &#8216;retirement gift for President Bush&#8217; doesn&#8217;t make the cut&#8217;)</p>
