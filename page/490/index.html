<p>Tries to one-up <a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BradDelongsSemi-dailyJournal/~3/SqyG7nV2S-w/usury.html">Brad DeLong</a> (and by extension Dr. Black), with <a href="http://www.trafficworld.com/newssection/rail.asp?id=49045">this item</a> from the middle of last month:<br />
<blockquote>Kansas City Southern upped its new five-year debt offering to $190 million from an initially announced $175 million, and said it will pay 16.5 percent in yield on notes held to maturity.</p>
<p>The company plans to use the money along with some other borrowing to buy up $200 million in 7.5 percent senior notes due next March.</p>
<p>The new notes will be due in 2013. KCS said they will bear an annual interest rate of 13 percent but be sold at a discount to their par value&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>KCS is the smallest of the Class I (large by revenue) railroads.  My recollection is that KCS&#8217;s debt ratings are (or at least were) on the low end of investment grade.  It may be a matter of debate as to whether it&#8217;s worse in the present climate to be a big newspaper or a biggish railroad, but KCS may have a stronger claim to providing a useful service to its customers&#8230;</p>

<p>Update:  The links worked this morning.  They also do not work at economistmom this afternoon. Many links to the Whitehouse and .gov are not working.</p>
<p>Update 2:  President Obama has put up his own new website, so I guess we wait a few hours to obtain docs.  His people are fast.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.utdallas.edu/~liebowit/knowledge_goods/david1985aer.htm">Paul David</a> (*) famously identified the QWERTY keyboard as a technology which we use as a matter of historical accident and not because the market identified the optimal keyboard layout.  That the market outcomes don&#8217;t necessarily yield the best of all possible economies even in theory clearly may offend economists of Panglossian or maybe Que Sera Sera inclinations.  It may not be a coincidence that a co-author of one of the <a href="http://www.utdallas.edu/~liebowit/keys1.html">better ripostes</a> to David (**), <a href="http://www.utdallas.edu/~liebowit/">Stanley Liebowitz</a> of UT-Dallas, has gone on to burn some reputation to<a href="http://www.independent.org/publications/policy_reports/detail.asp?type=full&#038;id=30"> produce argumentation pinning the mortgage meltdown on the GSEs and  the Community Reinvestment Act</a>.</p>
<p>Fast forward to the present and <a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2009/01/do-people-get-stuck-on-qwerty.html">Tyler Cowen</a> points to a <a href="http://www.aeaweb.org/annual_mtg_papers/2009/retrieve.php?pdfid=17">technology adoption experiment</a> by Tanjim Hossain and John Morgan, presented at the recent AEA meetings, which purports to set up conditions such as claimed for QWERTY but does not find that the subjects get stuck in the bad outcome.   Cowen reads the result and calls David&#8217;s path dependence via increasing returns story a &#8220;theory which probably should be laid to rest.&#8221;</p>
<p>I read the paper and draw other conclusions.   Hossain and Morgan actually set up experimental conditions in which there aren&#8217;t really increasing returns in David&#8217;s sense, so there should be no surprise the subjects didn&#8217;t get stuck with inferior outcomes.  An experiment to investigate the selection among multiple equilibria under David-style path dependence conditions is feasible for the interested experimenter.  More discussion after the jump.</p>
<p>I had some youthful dalliances with the Santa Fe Institute and so like to turn to <a href="http://www.santafe.edu/arthur/Papers/Pdf_files/EJ.pdf">Brian Arthur&#8217;s technology lock-in model</a> for a simple quantification of the scenario (***).  In the Arthur model, the increasing returns part is that the payoff to a technology increases in cumulative adoptions.  The history part is a random arrival sequence of agents with distinct payoffs (so, basically, one group of agents prefers technology A and another technology B unless the increasing returns part tips the market entirely to A or B).  Arthur showed that there&#8217;s a family of payoffs that eventually tips  the &#8220;market&#8221; to A or B with probability 1 and to an inferior technology (if the payoffs define one) with positive probability.  While the equilibrium selection probabilities depend on the payoff parameters, the realized equilibrium depends on the history of agent arrivals.</p>
<p>Hossain and Morgan&#8217;s experiment actually leaves out both the increasing returns and history features a la Arthur/David.  Regarding the former, the payoffs to the experiment&#8217;s technologies are bounded, which essentially puts the experiment in a constant-returns world.  Indeed, Hossain and Morgan say that there is a unique equilibrium to their game — adoption of a superior technology constructed to be &#8220;Pareto dominant.&#8221;  I assert without proof (because it&#8217;s trivial for readers of Arthur&#8217;s paper) that existence of a &#8220;Pareto dominant&#8221; technology implies boring dynamics in the Arthur model.</p>
<p>In the interesting cases, no technology is Pareto dominant but nevertheless there may be ex post regret in the sense that all types of agents could prefer that the market have tipped to a different technology.  The possibly missing market is that by which future adopters might pay the early users to adopt the &#8220;efficient&#8221; technology.</p>
<p>Nor is there history in the sense of the Arthur model, since in every period of the experiment there are exactly two agents of each of two types in the market.  So whatever the experiment is telling us, it isn&#8217;t saying much about technology adoption dynamics under the sort of increasing returns multiple-equilibrium conditions that are supposedly being investigated.</p>
<p>As an additional oddity, the payoffs are specified such that the payoff from one agent of a type choosing technology in a round A is X (which is increasing in the number of agents of the other type choosing A in the same round, but not e.g. cumulative adoptions), and if the other agent of the same type also chooses A, then the payoff is Y≤X.  To get some flavor for what this might mean, let&#8217;s rename the experiment&#8217;s agent and technology types (&#8220;square&#8221; and &#8220;triangle,&#8221; and &#8220;%&#8221; and &#8220;#,&#8221; respectively).  Call the agents &#8220;Graphic Designer&#8221; and &#8220;Accountant&#8221; and the technologies &#8220;Mac&#8221; and &#8220;PC.&#8221;  If you&#8217;re a Graphic Designer, the payoff to choosing Mac is greater if more Accountants also choose Mac, but not if more Graphic Designers do so.  These payoffs are inconsistent with some types of increasing returns mechanisms, a la &#8220;learning by doing/using&#8221; and &#8220;ecosystem&#8221; effects.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m occasionally skeptical that things like scale effects between economic experiments and the economic phenomena being studied are totally irrelevant, but in this case it&#8217;s easy to tune Arthur-esque payout functions to lead to lock-in quickly with usefully high productivity.  So I think there&#8217;s a multiple-equilibrium selection experiment out there waiting to be done.  But this paper isn&#8217;t it.</p>

It&#8217;s also not necessarily accidental that this paper found a home at the University of Chicago-domiciled JLE.  Liebowitz and Margolis persuasively argued that the alternative Dvorak layout is not as good relative to QWERTY as Dvorak advocates have claimed, and that ergonomic studies further suggest that there are distinctly bad layouts of which QWERTY is not one.  However, the conclusion along the lines of &#8216;history just so happens to have given us a not-necessarily-optimal but not-necessarily-terrible technology so what, me worry?&#8217; does not refute path-dependence.</p>

                                <p>Willem Buiter, whose early posts at <a href="http://blogs.ft.com/maverecon/">Maverecon</a> were the epitome of restraint, <a href="http://blogs.ft.com/maverecon/2009/01/time-to-take-the-banks-into-full-public-ownership/">calls for nationalisation</a>:<br />
<blockquote>By throwing cheap money with little conditionality at the banks, the Fed and the US Treasury may get bank lending going again.  By subsidizing new capital injections, they reward bad porfolio choices by the existing shareholders.  By letting the executive leadership and the board stay on, they further increase moral hazard, by rewarding  failed managers and boards that have failed in their fiduciary duties.  All this strengthens the incentives for future excessive risk taking.</p>
<p>There is a better alternative. The alternative is to inject additional capital into the banks by taking all the banks into full public ownership.  With the state as sole owner, the existing top executives and the existing board members can be fired without any golden handshakes.  That takes care of one important form of moral hazard.  Although publicly owned, the banks would be mandated to operate on ordinary commercial principles.  Managers could be incentivised by linking remuneration to multi-year profitability. The incentives for excessive liquidity accumulation and for excessively cautious lending policies that exist for partially nationalised banks and for banks fearing nationalisation would, however, be eliminated.</p></blockquote>
<p>He also addresses the sticking point on the formation of the &#8220;bad bank&#8221;: if the government already owns the assets, the sale price becomes an accounting question.  Not that that is necessarily good, but at least it limits some of the profiteering.</p>

                                <p>In recent days there has been a lot of gnashing of teeth among Social Security supporters at the prospect of even having Social Security on the table during next month&#8217;s economic summit. I gave a few reasons a couple days ago why we don&#8217;t need to let &#8216;fear itself&#8217; rule us <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/" target="_match">Obama and Social Security: why NOT to worry</a>. Today I want to add some reasons why this could work in total favor of the progressive agenda. And rather than recreate the wheel I am just going to repost something from my own blog from August 2005, which post had the same title as this one. Given the passage of time and the new economic situation I would today have to update a couple points, these are indicated in italics. Otherwise it has I think held up well. Full text below<br />
<blockquote>Time for Politics.</p>
<p>Social Security offers the opportunity to reverse a whole generation of political defensivism on the part of Democrats. We have the unique chance of changing the entire narrative.</p>
<p>Because Social Security &#8220;crisis&#8221; is not a matter of numbers, not really, it is a story in support of an ideology which can be boiled down to &#8220;Markets Good, Government Bad&#8221;. This story has been carefully crafted for seventy years and finally got its opportunity to be put in play in 1980 with the election of Ronald &#8220;Government is not the solution, government is the problem&#8221; Reagan.</p>
<p>As it turns out Reagan was forced to compromise on Social Security in 1983 and accept an increase in payroll tax. The response of the Social Security haters was then laid out in the Fall 1983 issue of the Cato Journal <a href="http://www.cato.org/pubs/journal/cj3n2/cj3n2.html">Social Security: Continuing Crisis or Real Reform?</a> Particularly illuminating is the article by Butler and Germanis &#8220;Achieving Social Security Reform: A “Leninist” Strategy&#8221;. They laid out a careful, long term strategy that would allow them to kill Social Security at the next crisis point, which point was projected to coincide with the retirement of the first Boomers, which would start as early as 2008. According to the story the impact of Boomer Retirement would send the whole edifice crashing leaving Private Accounts standing triumphant.</p>
<p>But history and the economy did not play nice. They conspired to return economic numbers that started to push shortfall and depletion back. This trend accelerated in the nineties and can be inspected here <a href="http://www.epinet.org/content.cfm/issueguides_socialsecurity_changes">Economics Policy Institute: Changes in Trustees Projections over time</a>. A Trust Fund that was projected to run dry in 2023 was over a period of years adjusted to a Trust Fund projected to run out in 2041, and that date was being pushed back more than 1.3 years per year.</p>
<p>Privatizers panicked. Their carefully generated narrative began to lose its punch. In 2041 the youngest Boomer (born in 1964) will be seventy four, the oldest (born in 1946) ninety-six. It would be pretty hard to argue that they in fact had not fully paid for their Social Security themselves. So privatizers began to tweak the numbers and move the goalposts. In doing so they had to cast doubt on the very existence of the Trust Fund. Hence the talk of &#8220;worthless IOUs&#8221;. But even this new story is losing its impact.</p>
<p>Because amazingly enough we may not even need to tap the Trust Fund principal, we may need at worst to tap a fraction of the interest due. Because we are soundly beating the productivity numbers required by Low Cost.<a href="http://bruceweb.blogspot.com/2004/11/what-is-low-cost-alternative-what-does.html">What is the Low Cost Alternative: What does it mean</a> and Low Cost predicts just that: a minor shortfall in income less interest against cost in 2023 which is more than offset by interest earned. Absent some future government proving themselves to be Crooks and Liars in abrograting Trust Fund bonds issued with the Full Trust and Credit of the United States beating Low Cost means we are home free.</p>
<p>But it might well be better than that. <i>The economy is returning productivity numbers close to double what Low Cost requires</i>, and minor changes in productivity in the early years have outsized impacts on the Trust Fund in the outyears. As it sits we may have a Trust Fund that is actually overfunded going forward. And that is our opportunity.</p>
<p>Imagine a <i>March 2006</i> Report that announces that not only will Social Security not be going broke, it will be a net lender forever. That shows that privatizers pushing &#8220;Crisis&#8221; were not just alarmists but outright liars trying to sabotage the legacy of Roosevelt. Do you think we could run with that? Do you think we could run ON that? Well I do.</p></blockquote>
<p>Because this is what I have been working for. I am tired of continually playing defense on Social Security. I want to take it right to the other guy. And we are not going to get there by trying to keep the ball out of play. We just need to open a nice big can of FDR WhoopAss and show the other guys that we got the numbers on this.</p>
<p>So lets get out of our defensive crouch and stop letting the other side run all over us on this. We have two choices here. We can channel Bush I &#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t be prudent&#8221; or go right back to our original inspiration &#8220;The only thing we have to fear is Fear itself&#8221;. I know where my preference is.</p>

<p>Pieter Beinart serves up some conventional wisdom in the Washington Post.  Unfortunately he is totally wrong, because he hasn&#8217;t checked the facts in the past 7 years.</p>
<p>Beinart wrote</p>
<p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/01/16/AR2009011603719.html?sid=ST2009011604309&#038;s_pos=list">&#8220;Older liberals remember &#8230;. They also remember the welfare reform debate of the mid-1990s, when prominent liberals predicted disaster, and disaster didn&#8217;t happen.&#8221;<br /></a><br />Oh didn&#8217;t it ?  </p>
<p>Try telling it to the severely poor</p>
<p>Beinart is a lazy fool, as I argue after the jump.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m afraid Mr Beinart will be down to one example soon.  The welfare reform was promptly followed by an amazing boom which no one predicted.  Then he lost interest in the issue.  Beinart decided that, since poor people did OK in the late 90s, welfare reform was a good idea.  </p>
<p>What happened with welfare reform and without an extraordinary boom ?  The number of Americans in &#8220;severe poverty&#8221; grew 26% from 2000 to 2005, that&#8217;s what happened.   &#8220;Severe poverty&#8221; is severe, &#8220;A family of four with two children and an annual income of less than $9,903 &#8211; half the federal poverty line &#8211; was considered severely poor in 2005.&#8221;</p>
<p>So welfare reform worked great didn&#8217;t it ?  Now one might argue that the problem was that the economy was horribly bad from 2000 to 2005 (and the comparison is with 2000 not 1996) however the 2005 severe poverty rate was the highest in 32 years including the severe recession in 1982.  The immense severe poverty rate was achieved with moderate unemployment.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.commondreams.org/headlines07/0223-09.htm">All data from this McClatchy article<br /></a></p>
<p>update (link fixed thanks to kolohe)</p>
<p>Beinart only concludes that welfare reform wasn&#8217;t a disaster, because he only paid attention to what was happening to the poor for a few extraordinary years. </p>
<p>In 2000 one could argue whether the improvement in economic conditions of the US poor was due to the booming economy, due in part to the booming economy and due in part to welfare reform or more than 100% due to the booming economy which more than undid the damage of welfare reform.  Now, with more data, it might still be possible to avoid reaching the third conclusion, but I haven&#8217;t read the argument.  The fact, the plain simple fact, that severe poverty has increased since welfare was reformed is not mentioned in the discussion.</p>
<p>This is important, because the nonsensical clearly false claim made by Beinart is definitely the conventional wisdom.  Notice that Obama only promised to cut the taxes of 95% of US families.  The other 5% mostly weren&#8217;t those so rich that he proposed raising their taxes (that would be between 1% and 2%).  They were the poorest who could only be given more money by unreforming welfare.</p>
<p>It is well known that welfare reform was followed by an improvement in the economic conditions of the poorest Americans.  The minor fact that this is no longer true and hasn&#8217;t been true for years is not worthy of notice.  </p>

<p>Gary Becker <a href="http://www.becker-posner-blog.com/archives/2009/01/on_the_obama_st.html">writes</a> (via <a href="http://lanekenworthy.net/2009/01/18/why-the-conversion-to-keynes/">Lane Kenworthy</a> who is strangely polite in response)</p>
<blockquote><p>As Posner and others have indicated, there appears to have been a huge conversion of economists toward Keynesian deficit spenders, but the evidence that produced such a &#8220;conversion&#8221; is not apparent (although maybe most economists were closet Keynesians all along). This is a serious recession, but Romer and Bernstein project a peak unemployment rate without the stimulus of about 9%. The 1981-82 recession had a peak unemployment rate of about 10.5%, but there was no apparent major &#8220;conversion&#8221; of economists at that time. What is so different about the present recession compared to that one, and to other recessions since then, that would greatly raise the estimated stimulating effects of government spending on various types of goods and services?</p>
<p>It is relevant in answering this question that the origins of this recession were in the financial sector, and especially in the excessive mortgage credit to sub prime and other borrowers. The widespread collapse of the financial sector, and the wholesale retreat from risky assets, clearly has called for a highly pro-active Fed. But it is not obvious why this should lead to greater confidence in the power of government spending stimulus packages. Of course, perhaps the prior emphasis on crowding out, and skepticism toward the stimulating effects of government spending, were wrong, or that recessions were too short and mild after the 1981-82 recession to call for Keynesian-type stimulus packages.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is an excerpt from a longer essay, but, I think that relevant context is not removed.  I don&#8217;t think that anyone can read the whole post and doubt that Becker claims that it is mysterious that fiscal policy, as opposed to monetary policy, is back in fashion now compared to 1982.  </p>
<p>Evidently, he either doesn&#8217;t know that the target federal funds rate is <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/fomc/fundsrate.htm">&#8220;0 &#8211; 0.25&#8221;</a> or doesn&#8217;t think that this fact is relevant to the discussion.  </p>
<p>Is it really possible that a Nobel laureate in economics isn&#8217;t familiar with the argument that the effectiveness of monetary policy changes when a nominal interest rate reaches zero ?  Is there any other explanation for why he wrote what he wrote ?  Even if he were completely dishonest he can&#8217;t really hope to keep the current target federal funds rate a secret can he ?</p>
<p>The rest of his post is based on the argument that the market economy can&#8217;t get workers into vacant jobs in response to a shock.  I don&#8217;t mean that this happens slowly or is costly, he assumes that it doesn&#8217;t happen at all (the post contains no discussion of labor market dynamics at all and doesn&#8217;t acknowledge in any way that there is any such thing).</p>
<p>I honestly don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going on.  I think over at U Chicago they have decided that Keynes was wrong, that what he wrote was obvious nonsense and concluded that any argument that comes to their mind must be a valid refutation of Keynes.</p>
<p>update: <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/01/19/getting-fiscal/">Minds think alike.</a></p>
<p>update II: My further thoughts on <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/01/19/economists-ideology-and-stimulus/#respond">Krugman&#8217;s further thoughts</a> after the jump</p>
<p>Update III:  <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2009/01/will-gary-becker-please-return-from-the-gamma-quadrant.html">Minds think alike II</a>.  Now I understand.  Becker was irritated that Fama was getting all the attention and decided to see how many links he could get.  Looks like Fama is toast.</p>
<p>I think there is another contributing factor to the silliness in Chicago. The arguments for the stimulus are basically straight from Keynes. You and other supporters basically state that macroeconomics has made no progress in 70 years on how to address the current situation. Now aside from questions of left vs right, that is deeply offensive to economists in Chicago who are proud of that universities role in the rational expectations revolution.</p>
<p>I think that aside from hostility to public spending and to the idea that the government can improve on market outcomes there is also a deep deep hostility to Keynes, Hicks, Samuelson (the macro-economist) etc. I mean if you had a disease, and your trusted physician didn’t know what do do with it and someone argued that your 4 humors were out of balance and the solution was something that seems to have worked once in the past, how would you react ?</p>
<p>I think that a little voice screams “that’s nonsense” whenever they hear about “multipliers” and “fiscal stimulus.” The strangest contributions are those of Fama and Becker who aren’t macroeconomists and who are just sure that Keynes was totally wrong, don’t remember exactly why, but are sure it is something obvious.</p>
<p>A test case of my alternative explanation is Thomas Sargent. He is not ideologically right wing. He is definitely anti-Keynesian. IIRC his only contribution to the debate was to note that the back of the envelope calculations to be found, for example, here are based on a 71 year old model as if macroeconomists had learned nothing in the past 60 years (I don’t know where those 11 years went either). This claim is, of course, true. I don’t even know if he went on to argue against the stimulus. Your view is that Macroeconomists haven’t learned anything which is currently useful in the past 71 years, but you can see how many economists find that conclusion intolerable.</p>
