                                <p>by Tom Bozzo</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, reader Pete emailed a link to <a href="http://realclearpolitics.blogs.time.com/2009/06/27/busting-the-administrative-cost-benefit-myth/">Real Clear Politics</a>, where Tom Bevan cited <a href="http://www.heritage.org/Research/HealthCare/wm2505.cfm">an analysis by Robert Book of the Heritage Foundation</a> that purports to show that Medicare administrative costs, widely claimed (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/26/opinion/26krugman.html?_r=1&#038;ref=opinion">e.g.</a>) to be far lower than comparable private sector costs when expressed as a fraction of expenditures, actually are higher when expressed on a per-beneficiary basis.  This got its share of big-league attention at the time, with <a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2009/07/does-medicare-have-lower-administrative.html">Greg Mankiw</a> linking, <a href="http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~cook/movabletype/archives/2009/07/does_medicare_a.html">Andrew Gelman</a> reporting the result with some skepticism, and <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/06/administrative-costs/">Paul Krugman</a> offering the always worthwhile advice never to trust Heritage Foundation analysis.  More recently, <a href="http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~cook/movabletype/archives/2009/07/more_on_medicar.html">Gelman posted</a> to the effect that Heritage is shopping Book&#8217;s administrative cost claim (among others) as part of a broadside against government-run health care.</p>
<p>What seems to have gotten less attention is that even using Book&#8217;s preferred comparison (i.e. administrative expense per beneficiary instead of administrative expense as a fraction of outlays), the claim is bunk.  This is because Book, referencing an <a href="http://www.manhattan-institute.org/html/mpr_05.htm">analysis by Benjamin Zycher</a> of the (also right-wing) Manhattan Institute, takes a reasonable proposition — that the federal government incurs some Medicare-related costs not explicitly included in the Medicare budget — and proceeds to allocates billions of dollars with little or no causal nexus to the Medicare program as Medicare administration costs.  Book and Zycher call the resulting total of the budgeted and allocated costs the Medicare administrative costs and get the result that Medicare administration costs more than private-sector insurance per beneficiary.  Unfortunately for them, the result does not withstand a sane allocation of the federal expenditures they consider.</p>
<p>Details and a couple of ironies below the fold.</p>
<p>Directly measured Medicare administrative costs are 38 percent lower than private sector costs on the per-beneficiary measure Book prefers.  Thus one must find a lot of unmeasured Medicare cost to make Medicare look relatively costly in administration.  Indeed, Zycher and Book manage to come up with an allocation of indirect costs amounting to roughly 80 percent of the directly reported Medicare administration expenses.</p>
<p>The sign that something is seriously amiss is the large assignment of costs from the &#8220;administration of justice&#8221; function.  For Fiscal 2005, Zycher locates $42.1 billion in such costs in the federal budget and assigns $7.2 billion of that to Medicare, representing 75 percent of the indirect cost assignment.  That&#8217;s the share of Medicare costs in nondefense discretionary spending, an allocation method (which happens to assign a quite high share of costs to Medicare) that Zycher defends on the grounds that military justice is administered via the defense budget.</p>
<p>Neither Zycher nor Book seem to have given much consideration to what the &#8220;administration of justice&#8221; money is actually spent on, and particularly that much if not most of it might be spent administering justice (at least notionally) on behalf of society as a whole and not just other federal programs.  But there is such a thing as the <a href="http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/eande.htm#cjee">Expenditure and Employment Statistics</a> from the U.S. DOJ&#8217;s Bureau of Justice Statistics.  For FY2005, DOJ statistics indicate that $40 billion was spent in three main categories as follows: &#8220;police protection&#8221; ($22.5 billion), &#8220;judicial and legal&#8221; ($10.9 billion), and &#8220;corrections&#8221; ($6.6 billion).  Those figures include both spending on federal government programs and transfers to state and local government.</p>
<p>So if you were to think that even two or three billion dollars a year was being spent policing the Medicare program and locking up Medicare fraud perpetrators, then it would have to be that the federal courts are jammed with Medicare cases and not, say, civil litigation, drug prosecutions, etc.  There is, though, evidence of the actual scale of Medicare fraud prevention expenses.  The FY2010 budget includes <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/opa/pr/2009/May/09-ag-491.html">$311 million</a> for Medicare &#8220;program integrity&#8221; activities, which is a 50 percent increase over FY09.  The interagency Medicare Fraud Strike Force program <a href="http://www.stopmedicarefraud.gov/strikeforcesfactsheet.pdf">filed 125 criminal cases</a> [PDF] from March &#8217;07 to July &#8217;09, leading to prison sentences for 122 people averaging 49 months.  DOJ&#8217;s share of the increase is $19 million for FY2010, according to the <a href="http://www.cms.hhs.gov/PerformanceBudget/Downloads/CMSFY09CJ.pdf">CMS budget justification</a> [PDF].  So we&#8217;re looking at on the order of tens of millions of dollars in expenditures for other agencies policing the program, not billions.</p>
<p>So almost all of the $7.2 billion should be taken away from the allocated indirect Medicare expenses.  Being generous to Book and Zycher and taking away only $6 billion reduces the per-beneficiary expense for FY 2005 from Book&#8217;s $509 to $356.  That compares to $453 for private sector insurance.  So without addressing any of the other questionable expense allocations, Medicare administrative expense per beneficiary is at least 21 percent lower than that of private insurance.</p>
<p>Zycher also allocates an array of &#8220;general government&#8221; expenses in proportion to Medicare&#8217;s share of total federal expenditures.  Among the main contributors here is the cost of running the legislative branch and administering the tax system.  From an economist&#8217;s (versus an accountant&#8217;s) perspective, it is questionable whether much of these properly represent marginal or incremental costs of Medicare (something which Book, a PhD alum of the Chicago economics program, could be expected to consider in a perfect world).  For that matter, a program such as Medicare may well require less than it&#8217;s expense share of certain expenses as it&#8217;s funded largely through a simpler-to-administer tax and may not require the amount of legislative attention as much smaller discretionary programs.</p>
<p>But that doesn&#8217;t really matter, since the general government costs a la Zycher are not enough in themselves to make Medicare administration more costly per beneficiary than private insurance.</p>
<p>As for the ironies, here are a couple.  First, the &#8220;direct&#8221; Medicare administrative expenditures include a portion of the subsidies provided to private insurers under the Medicare Advantage program — a bit of Bush-era corporate welfare that subsidizes the private sector so that it can compete with traditional Medicare.  Second, much of Medicare administration, for instance claims processing, is contracted out.  So much of the comparison is of private sector entities operating under different incentive systems. </p>
<p>Finally, Zycher argues that even the inclusion of indirect costs understates the true cost of Medicare as it does not factor in the the economic burden of funding Medicare through distortionary taxes.  There&#8217;s less to this than meets the eye, regardless of how distortionary you think a payroll tax of a few percent might be.  The problem is that such Medicare tax distortion as there may be is not incurred against an alternative world of complete markets and perfect competition.  Real insurers charge at least average incremental costs (and thus exert some market power in the sense of being able to charge prices above marginal cost), and in the current private system many losses are uninsured or uninsurable.  Insofar as universal public health care provision can (or would) address a number of the private sector market imperfections, it&#8217;s at least a matter for careful analysis which system has the bigger economic losses.</p>

<blockquote><p>For JS-Kit’s part, and Echo specifically, the key is to ensure that a blog is a full and fruitful part of the full social media landscape. The goal is to make the blog post the first place to share a thought and the best place to see a complete and comprehensive view of the resulting conversation.</p>
<p>The conversation itself can and should happen on FriendFeed, Twitter, other Blogs, Facebook – you name it. These are natural, private conversations between friends. The blog author though, can enjoy the fruits of his work by watching the live reactions get re-assembled on his page.</p></blockquote>
<p>It takes a bit to figure out folks. I will be working on modifications.</p>

<p>I was going to do another piece on the OCC and performance as a regulating agency, but Baseline Scenario did a great job already:<a target="_blank" href="http://baselinescenario.com/2009/08/05/john-dugan-consumer-advocate-or-bank-defender/">John Dugan and the OCC</a>.  Does anyone know if a replacement is even being considered?</p>

<p>I have been informed by js-kit that Aug.6, 09 is the date of our automatic conversion to the Echo Commenting System. Be advised it interconnects comments to other sites with your open ID and other formats as a social networking opportunity when someone clicks your profile, compiling your trail of comments over the internets.</p>
<p>If interested js-kit has summaries of what this portends.  Avoid drinking and bars and commenting if you are famous.</p>

<p><a href="http://thegreatrecessionconspiracy.blogspot.com/2009/07/monday-morning-smile.html" target="_blank">David Zetland</a> carries this story that I assume is accurate. Archtypical anecdote comes to mind.</p>
<blockquote><p>(via JWT) Judy Wallman, a professional genealogy researcher in southern California, was doing some personal work on her own family tree. She discovered that Harry (senator (D) from Nevada ) Reid&#8217;s great-great uncle, Remus Reid, was hanged for horse stealing and train robbery in Montana in 1889. Both Judy and Harry Reid share this common ancestor.</p>
<p>The only known photograph of Remus shows him standing on the gallows in Montana territory.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_RPTAaOI4RN8/SnmSC68cpYI/AAAAAAAAAkY/hsdAImMjcbQ/s1600-h/reid.jpg"><img border="0" alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_RPTAaOI4RN8/SnmSC68cpYI/AAAAAAAAAkY/hsdAImMjcbQ/s400/reid.jpg"></a> On the back of the picture Judy obtained during her research is this inscription:<br />Remus Reid, horse thief, sent to Montana Territorial Prison 1885, escaped 1887, robbed the Montana Flyer six times. Caught by Pinkerton detectives, convicted and hanged in 1889.</p>
<p>So Judy recently e-mailed Senator Harry Reid for information about their mutual great-great uncle.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, Harry Reid&#8217;s staff sent back the following biographical sketch for her genealogy research:</p>
<p>&#8220;Remus Reid was a famous cowboy in the Montana Territory. His business empire grew to include acquisition of valuable equestrian assets and intimate dealings with the Montana railroad. Beginning in 1883, he devoted several years of his life to government service, finally taking leave to resume his dealings with the railroad. In 1887, he was a key player in a vital investigation run by the renowned Pinkerton Detective Agency. In 1889, Remus passed away during an important civic function held in his honor when the platform upon which he was standing collapsed.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I have one of those ancestors myself from Glasgow, Ayreshire Scotland.  Update:(His name was not <a href="http://urbanlegends.about.com/gi/dynamic/offsite.htm?site=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom%5FKetchum">Black Jack Ketcham</a>)</p>

<p>I read the Op-Ed in the Boston Globe and asked Doug to write a piece or pieces in a more detailed fashion.  There have been allusions to this issue as a cost factor, but no policy consideration here to date.</p>
<p><strong>Post by Doug Brown</strong></p>
<p>Due to the complexity of organizations today, there is commonly a “silo mentality” that develops where one department often doesn’t know what another is doing.  Employees are good at looking at the “trees” within their silo, but very few are seeing the forest.  We have all seen it.  The result is usually organizational dysfunction.  Nowhere is this more pronounced than at one of our largest government agencies – the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).  What’s worse, this dysfunction has enormous consequences for the cost and quality of health care that is delivered in this country.  And yet, as we embark on the most significant reform to our health care system in over forty years, no one is talking about this issue.  </p>
<p>In a July 20 Op Ed in the Boston Globe entitled <a target="_blank" href="http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2009/07/20/retooling_the_medicaremedicaid_model/">Retooling the Medicare/Medicaid Model</a>, I explored this issue.  Specifically, I highlighted a program in Massachusetts that successfully breaks down the silos between these two programs to do what’s best for patients.  </p>
<p>This care delivery model, called Senior Care Options, pools funding from Medicare and Medicaid to allow private organization to integrate care for dually eligible individuals (those eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid, and some of the most costly individuals on our public programs) to provide truly coordinated care that is patient centered and cost effective.  The model has been very successful in keeping seniors out of expensive nursing homes and making them happy and satisfied.  So the question is: in light of what seems to me to be such an obvious opportunity, why aren’t more states doing something about it and why aren’t more people talking about it?  </p>
<p>I received a number of interesting responses to my Op Ed, some of which speculate on this question.  One was from Renee Markus Hodin of Community Catalyst, a well respected consumer advocacy organization.  She reported that her organization has been trying to make headway on this issue for years.  They even got a provision inserted into the original House health reform bill to specially protect and encourage more SCO programs.  But the provision was eliminated, apparently due to a misunderstanding.  I am told it was opposed by some beneficiary groups “who were wary of the provision being abused by states that want to dump their duals into private plans and/or by plans that were not committed to providing the kind of care delivery system that we see under the SCO program.”  That has not been the experience of SCO at all.  But unfortunately, it seems that some of the new “Special Needs Plans” (SNPs) that were created recently by Congress to try to address dual eligibles are not working as intended and do not fully integrate care like SCO does.  </p>
<p>The beauty of the SCO program is that there is a three-way contract; between the state Medicaid agency, Medicare and the SCO.  This is critical to ensure full integration among both programs.   Renee tells me they are trying again and hoping to garner more support.   </p>
<p>I received another response from Jennifer Baron, a senior researcher at the Harvard Business School.  She too has been working on this issue for a number of years.  Here was her post to the online version of my Op Ed:  </p>
<blockquote><p>In April 2008, Harvard Business School Professor Michael Porter and I published a case study profiling Commonwealth Care Alliance (CCA), one of the three organizations offering a SCO plan. This case is one of the few examples we’ve found of a high-value approach to insurance coupled with an innovative care delivery model. Invariably when the case study is taught, students approach us after class to inquire how they can become involved with CCA or SCO. </p>
<p>We&#8217;ve found it particularly inspiring that under the pooled Medicare/Medicaid payment model, CCA managed to successfully serve one of the most complex and costly patient populations on the planet. In 2006-7, the only patient population for which CCA’s costs exceeded average premiums was the institutionalized population. Average premiums for the frail elderly patients who remained outside of institutional settings all exceeded costs. Talk about aligning financial and patient incentives!</p>
<p>My understanding is that once SCO graduated from a demonstration to a Special Needs Plan in 2009, the single three-way contract with Medicare and Medicaid &#8211; one of the most innovative aspects of the reimbursement model – disappeared. Though both Medicare and Medicaid continue to fund the plan as a SNP, I believe they must now contract separately with participating organizations.</p></blockquote>
<p>For additional information, the CCA case study abstract is posted on the Institute for <a target="_blank" href="websitehttp://www.hbs.edu/rhc/health_care_delivery_curriculum.html">Strategy &#038; Competitiveness website</a>. </p>
<p>My best judgment of why this is not getting better traction is twofold: first, Medicare and Medicaid are incredibly complex and few inside and outside of healthcare really understand either one, let alone the way they intersect (that is why I tried hard to make my Op Ed explain the issue as simply as possible; you can let me know whether I succeeded).  Second, we have lacked leadership and focus at the federal level.  CMS has become such a large bureaucracy that it is overwhelming to even think about how one might reorganize it so that it better serves patients.  But in my view it must be done.  I remain very hopeful that with a new administration and a new focus on health reform, we have a unique opportunity to finally address this issue.  I would love to hear your thoughts and ideas on the subject, including ways we might try to help make this happen.<br />_____________________________________<br />by Doug Brown</p>

<p>Steven Levitt <a href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/08/03/is-somebody-lying-about-cash-for-clunkers/">wonders aloud at the Freakonomics blog</a> whether it could possibly be true that the CARS a/k/a Cash for Clunkers is about to run out of money, given the level of new vehicle sales in the U.S.:<br />
<blockquote>The program went into place on July 24th. One week later, the program was said to be out of money.</p>
<p>In 2006, before the current ills of the automakers, the average number of new cars sold in a week in the United States was 125,000.</p>
<p>So if you believe the numbers, sales involving clunkers as trade-ins last week represented more than two times the weekly sales of new vehicles when the industry was healthy.</p></blockquote>
<p>You have to go well into the comments thread before someone points out that pre-crisis, the number of new automobiles sold in the U.S. was more like 300,000/week — say 16 million sales/year divided by 52 weeks.  As <a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/blogspot/Hzoh/~3/UoRR1CAs2vE/july-auto-sales.html">Spencer showed yesterday</a>, second quarter sales were running around 9.5 million at a seasonally adjusted annual rate; by advanced math, that&#8217;s about 182,500 weekly sales.  The difference in July vs. Q2 sales was about 1.7 million vehicles at SAAR, or 142,000/month.  That would be among the greener shoots were it attributable to general economic conditions.  So CARS actually could fund about two weeks&#8217; worth of the difference between the Q2 sales rate and the pre-crisis rate.  Though maybe given the recent track record of the Chicago school, being off by only a factor of 2.5 is not a bad performance.</p>
<p>A little more below the fold.</p>
<p>Consistent with reports that SUVs and pickups are getting traded in mainly on bread-and-butter cars and small crossovers, a number of high-volume models had very good months.  For instance, Toyota&#8217;s Big Three (Camry, Corolla, and Prius) sold 23,413 more units in <a href="http://pressroom.toyota.com/pr/tms/toyota-reports-july-sales-97581.aspx">July</a> than in <a href="http://pressroom.toyota.com/pr/tms/toyota-reports-june-and-first-95132.aspx">June</a>, a 39.4 percent increase.  Prof. Hamilton&#8217;s <a href="http://www.econbrowser.com/archives/2009/07/no_rebound_for.html">auto-sales graph</a> shows perhaps a modest June-July sales bump in the pre-crisis data.  Honda, Ford, and Hyundai among others also had relatively good months by recent standards.  While one of Levitt&#8217;s commenters boasts of trading a seldom-used pickup on a BMW Z4, lousy sales results from luxury makes suggest this is not a major problem (even though the $45,000 price ceiling is base price and hence relatively permissive); <a href="http://www.autospies.com/news/Mini-Sales-Dip-3-8-In-July-BMW-Fumbles-YTD-Sales-Lead-To-Lexus-After-Dropping-31-5-46600/">BMW&#8217;s sales report</a> affirmatively cited a lack of CARS activity. [1]</p>
<p>So picking over the sales reports, it doesn&#8217;t seem hard to come up with 100,000 sales or thereabouts that could have been juiced by CARS, and the bottom line is that if that&#8217;s the case (and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/04/business/04auto.html?hp">reported</a> fuel economy improvement statistics are based off of the first 80,000 applications), then it&#8217;s perfectly possible that the program could run out of money quickly, or very quickly given a sufficient backlog of unprocessed applications.</p>
<p>Obviously the ordering of the program start and promulgation of the regulations is not a high point in government, but a look at the results suggests that some of the tea-partying reaction is unwarranted.  Based on the reported fuel consumption difference of about 38 percent for the initial wave of applications, savings in fuel and avoided external costs from burning the fuel are on the order of $1200/year if the clunker was driven a typical amount (12,000 miles/year) with fuel at $2.50 and external costs of $1.50/gal.  This is not a bad return on a $4,000 investment.</p>
<p>[1] Moreover, the $45,750 base price of even a &#8220;stripper&#8221; Z4 3.0 renders the model ineligible for CARS.</p>

                                <p>Robert Waldmann</p>
<p>is very very late with this one.   Appears that long long ago (in blogtime) <a href="http://www.beautifulhorizons.net/weblog/2009/08/larry-katz-vs-larry-katz-alternative-title-michelle-malkin-is-a-moron.html">Michelle Malkin said that Larry Katz once wrote that unemployment insurance causes unemployment.<br /></a></p>
<p>I know Larry Katz, Larry Katz was my PhD co-supervisor, Larry Katz is a friend of mine and Ms Malkin, you&#8217;re no Larry Katz.</p>
<p>Malkin was referring to <a href="http://ideas.repec.org/p/nbr/nberwo/2741.html">&#8220;The Impact of the Potential Duration of Unemployment Benefits on the Duration of Unemployment&#8221; Katz and Meyer 1990</a> which did indeed show that a lot of people start working again exactly when their UI benefits run out.  It also showed something even more remarkable.  A lot of people start working again after exactly 6 months of unemployment even if, while they were unemployed, benefits were extended.  The paper is a spin off from his dissertation chapter on how, if one wants to understand unemployment duration one has to distinguish between temporary layoff unemployment and other unemployment.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not so true anymore.   The sad fact is that the fraction of the unemployed who are on temporary layoff is much lower now (about 10% I think).   This implies much slower employment expansion in a recovery.  It also means that unemployment spells are not designed in advance, and, in particular, not planned with UI rules in mind.  Katz&#8217;s story about the 6 month spike even when benefits had been extended was that firms scheduled a layoff of 6 months before benefits were extended.  It is true that in addition to the recall from temporary layoff spike Katz and Meyer found a smaller spike in the hazard of exiting unemployment to a new job when UI actually stopped.</p>
<p>The economy has changed and the effect described by Katz and Meyer is probably smaller now than it was in their data.</p>
