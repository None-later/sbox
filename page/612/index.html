                                <p>It is my understanding that the major byproduct of ethanol is distillers grains that are used as feed for cattle, hogs and chicken with essentially the same nutritional value as feed grains that have not had ethanol distilled out of them. All distilling ethanol does is remove the starch from the food grains and leaves the  protein, etc, that animals need to grow.</p>
<p>This means that the use of corn or other feed grains being used to produce ethanol does not divert feed grains out of the food chain.</p>
<p>A bushel of corn can be used to generate x pounds of beef or it can be used to generate z gallons of ethanol and almost the same x pounds of beef.</p>
<p>Doesn&#8217;t this imply the argument I see on economic blog after economic blog that ethanol production is playing a significant role in higher food prices is incorrect.</p>
<p>Rather the Department of Agriculture and/or Bush Administration argument that ethanol production plays an insignificant role in the current run up in food prices is correct.</p>
<p>Does somebody have reasonable evidence that this analysis is incorrect?</p>
<p>UPDATE !!!!</p>
<p>The beauty of the new world of the internet.</p>
<p>while I was looking into this question I ran across a very good article by Richard Perrin at the University of Nebraska on Ethanol and Food Prices
<p><a href="http://http//digitalcommons.unl.edu/ageconfacpub/49/">http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/ageconfacpub/49/</a></p>
<p><a href="http://http//digitalcommons.unl.edu/ageconfacpub/49/">  </a></p>
<p><strong>ABSTRACT:</strong><br />Food prices in the <place st="on"><country-region st="on">U.S.</country-region></place> rose dramatically in 2007 and early 2008. Given the integration of the world markets for foodstuffs, prices increased around the world as well, leading to riots in a number of countries in early 2008. The popular press has tended to attribute these food price increases to demand for corn by the ethanol industry. Grain prices are one determinant of food prices, but they constitute less than 5% of food costs in the <place st="on"><country-region st="on">U.S.</country-region></place>(a higher percentage elsewhere.) This paper focuses on the likely relationship between ethanol and food prices, ignoring the potential role of other important contributors. It finds that ethanol is responsible for no more than 30-40% of the grain price increases of the last 18 months. Food prices in the US increased about 16% over the last five years,7% over the past 18 months, but rising grain prices have contributed only about a 3% cost increase over these periods. It is reasonable to conclude that ethanol is responsible for increases in US food prices about 1% in the last two years – a relatively small proportion of actual of <country-region st="on"><place st="on">U.S.</place></country-region> food price increases. In food-insecure areas of the world,however, the impact of ethanol on food prices has been higher, perhaps as much as a 15% increase, simply because the typical food basket in those areas contains more direct grain consumption.</p>
</p>
<p>
<p>so I sent him an email with my question and he was nice enough to respond with this:</p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>You are right.  One-third of the corn processed for  ethanol is expelled as distillers grains and solubles (DGS.)  (One third is  ethanol, one-third CO2.)  DGS has slightly higher feed value than corn when it&#8217;s  fed to ruminants (I have a publication with an animal scientist on this issue,  if you become deeply interested, and could direct you to some others.)  Since  DGS can be directly substituted for corn, putting a ton of corn into an ethanol  plant really only extracts 2/3 ton from the animal feed supply, so it would have  been reasonable for me to assert that ethanol has accounted for only 30% of new  net withdrawals of the world&#8217;s coarse grains since 2000 (rather than 40%.)    China, Sub Saharan Africa, and South America are each responsible for about  15%.</p>
<p>
<p>So the standard treatment of ethanol in the press and blog is significantly misleading.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.house.gov/apps/list/press/agriculture_dem/pr_062608_hr6377.html">This</a> will teach them, right?<br />
<blockquote>H.R. 6377 directs CFTC to use all its authority, including its emergency powers, immediately to curb the role of excessive speculation in the energy and swaps futures markets and take other corrective actions as necessary to eliminate any market disturbance that prevents energy markets from accurately reflecting the forces of supply and demand.</p></blockquote>
<p>And what <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2193825/">long-term supply</a> (h/t <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2008/06/links-for-20-26.html">Mark Thoma</a>) is that?</p>
<p>As has been noted elsewhere, regulation at the CFTC isn&#8217;t in itself a bad idea. Indeed, it&#8217;s long overdue.  But I&#8217;ll go back to <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/06/24/hell-freezes-over/">Krugman</a> and <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/afe0e50c-4185-11dd-9661-0000779fd2ac.html">the FT</a>:<br />
<blockquote>The case for such a policy is based on a flawed concept of how these markets work. Those pushing for restrictions argue that an artificially high demand for essential commodities such as oil and corn has been created by the institutions&#8217; purchase of long positions in futures contracts&#8230;.</p>
<p>Now, if it were true that pension funds, insurance companies, evil hedge fund managers etc, were all buying large quantities of physical products such as silos of grain and storage tanks of oil, then the peasants with the torches, and their leaders, would have a point. But the investors aren&#8217;t buying physical product. [Nonsense about Lieberman being a Democrat omitted; italics mine]</p></blockquote>
<p>So, if this bill passes the Senate and is ultimately enacted, the CFTC either will prevent some people from buying futures (by some miracle, unless they&#8217;re going to do this <em>only</em> for crude contracts, which would mean Lieberman is even stupider than I think he is) or, more likely, change some requirements in the booking, reporting, and buying of such contracts which will make it more difficult for outright speculators.</p>
<p>Now, don&#8217;t get me wrong: I fully expect to be paying $1.50 for gasoline in a couple of months: but that will be C$1.50/litre.  The odds of those of you staying in the States being able to pay that per gallon—well, I wouldn&#8217;t take them.  Even if I were &#8220;speculating.&#8221;</p>

                                <p>Rick Newman of Useless News and World Report <a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/usnews/080627/27_6_myths_about_oil_speculators.html">busts some myths</a>.  And gets to the heart of the &#8220;speculators&#8221; issue:<br />
<blockquote>Many companies, for instance, want to lock in the price they&#8217;re going to pay down the road for petroleum products and other supplies they need to run their businesses. So they make agreements with suppliers on a price they&#8217;ll pay next year, or the year after, when they actually take possession of the oil. Buying and selling such &#8220;futures contracts&#8221; makes these companies speculators by definition, since they&#8217;re placing a bet on the future price of oil.</p>
<p>Companies doing this kind of hedging include gasoline refiners, airlines, shipping companies, and others that spend a lot on fuel or petroleum. Often they use investment banks or other intermediaries to arrange the deals. They might be gambling, but this kind of speculation actually helps companies run their businesses more smoothly, and if they guess right on future prices, it may give them a competitive advantage against other companies that don&#8217;t plan as prudently.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s not &#8220;gambling&#8221; that gave Southwest a competitive advantage, or nearly put Delta out of business yet again.  When your largest non-fixed expense is a known quantity (how much fuel you&#8217;ll need next year, given any expansin/contraction plans), hedging in the futures market isn&#8217;t just an adventure, it&#8217;s a job.</p>
<p>And note that the competitive advantage isn&#8217;t just against &#8220;other companies.&#8221;  A speculator who guesses wrong doesn&#8217;t stay in the market too long.  Nor, not to be blunt about it, does s/he ever take delivery of the asset: they sell the contract for a gain or loss.</p>
<p>This is why an increase in volume in the futures market (as noted in <a href="http://www.mcadforums.com/forums/files%20(PDF)/michael_masters_written_testimony.pdf">Mr. Master&#8217;s testimony</a>; h/t divorced one like Bush in comments <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/06/oil-prices-and-shopping-for-experts.html">here</a>) isn&#8217;t necessarily a sign in itself of speculation. It may be a sign of corporate risk management (finally) doing its job.  After all, it&#8217;s not as if the oil price trend isn&#8217;t clear.

                                                                    </div>

<p>Essentially it repeats the earlier retail sales report that consumers are spending their rebates.<br />Real personal consumption rose 0.4%.  this compares to these recent monthly growth rates:</p>
<p>Dec&#8230; -0.1<br />Jan&#8230; +0.2<br />Feb&#8230; -0.1<br />Mar&#8230; +0.2<br />Apr&#8230;. +0.2<br />May&#8230; +0.4</p>
<p>If you assume that real PCE in June is unchanged from May this will generate a quarterly growth rate for real PCE of 1.9%.  If you assume that consumers continue to spend their<br />rebates in June and we see a similar monthly gain in spending the quarterly growth rate would be 2.0%.   This compares to growth rates of 0.9%  and 1.4% in the last two quarters, respectively.</p>
<p>Given that real PCE accounts for over two-thirds of consumption in the real GDP accounts this<br />implies that third quarter growth is likely to be greater than the 1% rate of last quarter.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the deflator for PCE in May was 0.4% and excluding food and energy it was 0.1%.<br />So far this supports the Fed&#8217;s argument that core inflation and inflation expectations remain well anchored as the year over year change in the core PCE deflator remained at 2.1%.</p>

                                <p>I had thought the following had been published as part of this series, but in the course of comments on XXIV see that it wasn&#8217;t. Instead it was written in the month before I got privileges here.  But it dovetails neatly into discussion of the newly released <a href="http://www.treas.gov/press/releases/reports/ssissuebriefno.%205%20no%20cover.pdf">Issue Brief No. 5: Social Security Reform: Strategies for Progressive Benefit Adjustments</a>. The Issue Brief starts from Intermediate Cost assumptions and so assumes that a 100% payout of scheduled benefits is impossible. In response they propose a plan where lower income workers&#8217; initial benefit remains tied to real wages increases but that upper income workers have theirs tied to price indexing. Good friend Coberly looks at this and concludes (in my words) &#8220;Same shit, different bag&#8221;. I don&#8217;t disagree entirely, it all depends on your assumptions, but in this case it might well end up with us getting tossed into an apparent briar patch and coming out with a dozen roses. Warning serious wonkery ahead, since the piece was originally written for my blog (which has a typical readership of one, if I get around to it), it assumes a pretty good understanding of the concepts. But then again I will be happy to answer questions in comments.</p>
<p>100% of scheduled benefits plus sustainable solvency with a 100 Trust Fund Ratio.
<div></div>
<div>The current system of reporting Social Security solvency depends on a projection model. The Trustees ask the Office of the Chief Actuary to come up with a range of possible economic and demographic outcomes and score solvency under models that purport to represent the median (Intermediate Cost), the top (Low Cost), and the bottom (High Cost) of that range. This has led to a certain amount of controversy with one camp arguing that Intermediate Cost by coincidence or design has been too pessimistic, while another camp argues that it is in fact carefully constructed in light of best available information. Well that is not getting us anywhere, quarreling over which 75 year economic model is superior is kind of laughable considering that we don&#8217;t have consensus over what happened over the last 75 days. (Are we in recession yet?) I suggest a new approach.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Instead of projecting why don&#8217;t we try targeting? And a good starting point is the current schedule of benefits. To recap the situation. Social Security benefits are adjusted to capture the changes in real wages over a workers lifetime. What this means in practice is that historically Social Security has been a better deal for each generation, offset by some increases in payroll taxes along the way. Under the current schedule benefits in 2041 are set to be about 160% compared to the benefits a similarly situated retiree gets today. However under Intermediate Cost Assumptions the accumulated surplus in the Trust Funds is scheduled to run out in that year resulting in an immediate reset in benefits to 78% of the schedule. Now one way to look at this is to apply Rosser&#8217;s Equation (after Prof. Rosser of JMU who pointed me to these numbers) and see that 78% of 160% = 125% and call the deal done. Because a benefit 25% better than my Mom gets today guaranteed until I am 84 doesn&#8217;t exactly rise to the level of personal crisis. Then again the world doesn&#8217;t revolve around me.</div>
<div></div>
<div>So lets just assume that we want to target 100%. But what about the other 100? What is this Trust Fund Ratio you talk of?</div>
<div></div>
<div>The Trust Fund Ratio is simply a measure of the trust fund balances expressed as a function of time with 1 year = 100. If Social Security income from all sources continues to track total cost you end up with a stable Trust Fund Ratio. More income than cost ratio goes up, less income than cost ratio goes down. By law the Trustees are mandated to keep a minimum Trust Fund Ratio of 100. This allows for a certain degree of short term fluctuation in employment and hence payroll receipts to occur with creating financing gaps, keeping the TF ratio above 100 is a reasonable policy outcome. But there are limits, at some point a high TF ratio becomes actually a threat to the health of Social Security itself. Oddly enough you can really be too rich.</div>
<div></div>
<div>It works like this. Social Security surpluses are currently invested in Special Treasuries. Despite some hysteria these bonds perform just like any other Treasury, they carry specific interest rates and specific terms and are backed by the Full Faith and Credit of the United States. They are just as real as that dollar bill in your wallet. But is exactly because these bonds are real that they can become a problem. To see why you have to examine the past and present projection of the Low Cost Alternative.</div>
<div></div>
<div>From 1997 to 2007 Low Cost always returned the same outcome, a fully funded Social Security system with a flat TF ratio through the 75 year actuarial window meaning that total income tracked total costs putting the whole system in long term equilibrium. Now while this is a perfectly adequate outcome it would not in fact be an ideal outcome, the TF ratio settled out at high enough levels that the cost of paying the interest starts representing an appreciable burden on the General Fund. Not a big burden but enough of one to get noticed, under 2007 Low Cost the General Fund would be required to pay out about 10% of the interest owed in years after mid-century or about 2% of total system cost. Now there is nothing particularly unfair about a 98%/2% split between payroll tax and general fund, on the other hand the obligation never stops even while the original utility of the excess borrowing fades away. <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR07/VI_OASDHI_dollars.html#wp150920">Table VI.F8.-Operations of the Combined OASI and DI Trust Funds, in Current Dollars, Calendar Years 2007-85</a> </div>
<div></div>
<div>The 2008 Report tossed us an entirely different complication, under the newest Low Cost projection the system never settles into equilibrium, instead you get outcome I in the figure in this post <a href="http://bruceweb.blogspot.com/2008/04/shape-of-low-cost.html">Shape of Low Cost</a> the tail doesn&#8217;t flatten and the TF ratio rockets up to 650 in 2085 and rising from there. To see why this is a problem you have to take this process to its logical end. A TF ratio of 2000 at an interest rate of 5% would require General Fund transfers equal to 100% of overall system cost to restore equilibrium. Which is to say that Social Security would lose all semblance of being a worker financed insurance system and simply be transformed to welfare. In fact I would argue that any TF ratio above 1000 is a longterm danger, restoring the system to equilibrium requiring a transfer of more than 50% of total cost and so making SS into at least a partial welfare program. But by a really cruel mathematical irony the only way to drive the TF ratio down is by cutting the revenue from the payroll tax and so in the short term INCREASING the share borne by the General Fund. Instead you need to get this particular tiger&#8217;s tail under control before the acceleration sets in.
<div></div>
<p>Well that was part one. In a follow up I posted the mechanics under the title &#8220;100/100 in action&#8221;</p>
<p>In the post (above) this one I argue that high Trust Fund ratios present a threat to Social Security by transferring it from worker paid insurance to general fund paid welfare. This was specifically a political calculation, under our current situation the Economic Right has successfully been able to separate federal spending into two categories: one of spending that we can&#8217;t NOT afford which includes all things military, and the other of spending we CAN&#8217;T afford which includes most social spending. That the stuff that we can&#8217;t NOT afford comes with prices starting with &#8216;b&#8217;s and the stuff we CAN&#8217;T afford comes with prices typically starting with &#8216;m&#8217;s never seems to register. (The Administration practically wet itself announcing $200 million in world food aid yesterday {ed. last April}, which works out to 8 hours of the current costs of waging war in Iraq). It is important to keep Social Security from being lumped in with all those other programs, the Right hates it and always has. That is not hyperbole, if they can kill they will, Alf Landon explicitly ran against it in 1936 and the Republicans never really stopped.

<div>A Trust Fund Ratio of 100 is not only a reasonable target, it is in fact the legal test of Short Term Actuarial Balance for the Trustees. Now one way of getting there is to use the brute force method of simply not collecting FICA at all for the next two and a half years and so drive the TF ratio down from its current level of 360 to 100. But that would mean taking a combined $800 billion annual hit to the General Fund over that period. Not only is that not going to happen, it is not necessary. Instead we need to craft a new model that will deliver us to sustainable solvency after 2040.</div>
<div></div>
<div>We know what level of tax increase we would need under Intermediate Cost assumptions: 1.7% of payroll. We know the growth numbers that will return an overfunded system along the lines of Low Cost: 2.9% Real GDP in the years after 2013. So lets go target shooting.</div>
<div></div>
<div>For political reasons our first target point is 2011. We can start with Intermediate Cost assumptions and assume we will need to start phasing in that 1.7% with an initial increase of .4% of payroll. If between now and 2011 we beat IC numbers we simply shave that initial increase down to compensate. If we do enough better to make it unnecessary we can make an adjustment in the next target point of 2015 or whatever interval we choose but always with the goal of delivering 100% of benefits while keeping the TF tail from going long term significantly over a ratio of 100.</div>
<div></div>
<div>It is my personal opinion that subsequent adjustments in the targets will be more likely in the direction of cutting the rates rather than raising them, but in this case opinions don&#8217;t matter, economic performance does. Rather than quarrel about 75 year windows instead we can just settle on a policy outcome and adjust the FICA rate as needed to hit it.</div>
<div></div>
<div>This is not to say that the current schedule is perfect or that adjustments to benefits are totally off the table, we might agree to settle on a 95/100 solution. But the points are one, we need to be proactive and not reactive, and two there are significant dangers to allowing the Trust Fund ratio from getting out of hand, we are in fact called to thread the economic needle.

                                <p>The opening of the latest from <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/27/opinion/27krugman.html?ex=1372219200&#038;en=d91d69359ab6d5bf&#038;ei=5124&#038;partner=permalink&#038;exprod=permalink">Paul Krugman</a> reminds me of how some litigation attorneys treat “expert opinion”:</p>
<blockquote><p>Congress has always had a soft spot for “experts” who tell members what they want to hear, whether it’s supply-side economists declaring that tax cuts increase revenue or climate-change skeptics insisting that global warming is a myth.</p></blockquote>
<p>The problem of expert opinion for hire is just one issue discussed by William Simon in his <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1025984"> The Market for Bad Legal Advice: Academic Professional Responsibility Consulting as an Example</a>.  Paul notes the expert opinion of Michael Masters &#8211; a hedge fund manager.  Excuse me?  A hedge fund manager would not likely be qualified as an expert witness on oil prices by any competent judge.  Paul continues:</p>
<blockquote><p>Right now, the welcome mat is out for analysts who claim that out-of-control speculators are responsible for $4-a-gallon gas &#8230; Republicans have been at least as willing as Democrats to denounce evil speculators. But it turns out that conservative faith in free markets somehow evaporates when it comes to oil. For example, National Review has been publishing articles blaming speculators for high oil prices for years, ever since the price passed $50 a barrel.  And it was John McCain, not Barack Obama, who recently said this: “While a few reckless speculators are counting their paper profits, most Americans are coming up on the short end — using more and more of their hard-earned paychecks to buy gas.”  Why are politicians so eager to pin the blame for oil prices on speculators? Because it lets them believe that we don’t have to adapt to a world of expensive gas … This suggests that growing demand from emerging economies, not speculation, is the real story behind rising prices of raw materials, oil included.  In any case, one thing is clear: the hyperventilation over oil-market speculation is distracting us from the real issues.  Regulating futures markets more tightly isn’t a bad idea, but it won’t bring back the days of cheap oil. Nothing will. Oil prices will fluctuate in the coming years — I wouldn’t be surprised if they slip for a while as consumers drive less, switch to more fuel-efficient cars, and so on — but the long-term trend is surely up.  Most of the adjustment to higher oil prices will take place through private initiative, but the government can help the private sector in a variety of ways, such as helping develop alternative-energy technologies and new methods of conservation and expanding the availability of public transit.  But we won’t have even the beginnings of a rational energy policy if we listen to people who assure us that we can just wish high oil prices away.</p></blockquote>
<p>An outward shift of the demand curve as an explanation for rising prices?  Whoa – what a novel concept!</p>
