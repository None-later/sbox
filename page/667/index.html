                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Why do I feel uneasy about statements like the following, appearing in Paulson&#8217;s latest <a href="http://media.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/business/documents/executive_summary_032908.pdf?hpid=topnews">recommendations</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Treasury began this current study of regulatory structure after convening a conference on capital markets competitiveness in March 2007. Conference participants, including current and former policymakers and industry leaders, noted that while functioning well, the U.S. regulatory structure is not optimal for promoting a competitive financial services sector leading the world and supporting continued economic innovation at home and abroad. Following this conference, Treasury launched a major effort to collect views on how to improve the financial services regulatory structure. </p></blockquote>
<p>Foxes in the hen house? And where were the foxes before March 2008? Smiling?</p>
<p>Or try this one:<br />
<blockquote>Financial markets in the United States have developed into world class centers of capital and have led financial innovation. </p></blockquote>
<p>Paulson gives a nice pat on the back for our &#8220;centers of capital&#8221; that have &#8220;led financial innovation.&#8221; Wonder what members of the committee inserted that one? Yes, yes, the industry leaders we now have to rescue. But marvel, please, at all those financial innovations.</p>
<p>And I just cannot get my head around the next one:<br />
<blockquote>Now, however, maturing foreign financial markets and their ability to provide alternate sources of capital and financial innovation in a more efficient and modern regulatory system are pressuring the U.S. financial services industry and its regulatory structure. </p></blockquote>
<p>The Cause, the Prime Mover for our problems, are &#8220;maturing foreign financial markets.&#8221; May we have some examples of these &#8220;alternate&#8221; sources, please? Do we mean SWF&#8217;s? How have they contributed to our problems? In case you have not noticed, their wealth is a direct result of our poor trade policies.</p>
<p>And then, there is this one:<br />
<blockquote>Treasury believes it must ensure that the U.S. regulatory structure does not inhibit the continued growth and stability of the U.S. financial services industry and the economy as a whole.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I certainly cannot comment at this time on the specific proposals. They are wrapped in generalities and glossy overviews, difficult to penetrate. For us chickens, details are everything. Lots of deck chairs on the move. But I can make some observations:
<ol>
<li>We cannot rely on financial institutions to carry this economy, no matter how big the bonuses were, are&#8230;or will be.</li>
<li>Right now, the financial industry is in the hen house. They seem to be the ones &#8220;patching the leaks.&#8221;</li>
<li>Our manufacturing centers are vanishing; almost everything is being off-shored&#8230;from pharmaceuticals to computers, from dental bridges to accounting to electronic passports.</li>
<li>We are far too dependent on central banks to cover our rising debt.</li>
<li>Credit cannot substitute for trade.</li>
<li>Strong labor unions create vibrant middle classes. The Regan Revolution has been a rousing failure. Wages have been stagnant or declining.</li>
<li>Wealth is being concentrated into the hands of a few.</li>
<li>At the center of this mess lies the WTO and our trade deals. In not insisting that all of our trading partners respect labor, defending its rights to collectively bargain, we have encouraged companies to go elsewhere where labor has no rights and is dirt cheap. </li>
</ol>
<p>Yes, at the center of the mess is the WTO and our trade policies. For wealth to be more evenly distributed, labor must be protected, here and abroad. It really is time to look at how trade is being conducted. Credit and financial innovation alone create disaster.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/03/29/the-gramm-connection">Paul Krugman</a> picks up on the implications of McCain relying on Phil Gramm as an economic advisor.  I’d rather see Gramm – the fiscal hawk – advising McCain on spending and tax policy than the free lunch hack named Art Laffer even if Gramm would balance the budget with spending cuts than tax increases.  But it’s reform of the financial system that is at issue in Paul’s post.  As <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0308/9246.html">Politico</a> notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>The general co-chairman of John McCain’s presidential campaign, former Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Texas), led the charge in 1999 to repeal a Depression-era banking regulation law that Democrat Barack Obama claimed on Thursday contributed significantly to today’s economic turmoil. “A regulatory structure set up for banks in the 1930s needed to change because the nature of business had changed,” the Illinois senator running for president said in a New York economic speech. “But by the time [it] was repealed in 1999, the $300 million lobbying effort that drove deregulation was more about facilitating mergers than creating an efficient regulatory framework.” Gramm’s role in the swift and dramatic recent restructuring of the nation’s investment houses and practices didn’t stop there. A year after the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act repealed the old regulations, Swiss Bank UBS gobbled up brokerage house Paine Weber. Two years later, Gramm settled in as a vice chairman of UBS’s new investment banking arm. <br />Later, he became a major player in its government affairs operation. According to federal lobbying disclosure records, Gramm lobbied Congress, the Federal Reserve and Treasury Department about banking and mortgage issues in 2005 and 2006. During those years, the mortgage industry pressed Congress to roll back strong state rules that sought to stem the rise of predatory tactics used by lenders and brokers to place homeowners in high-cost mortgages.  For his work, Gramm and two other lobbyists collected $750,000 in fees from UBS’s American subsidiary. In the past year, UBS has written down more then $18 billion in exposure to subprime loans and other risky securities and is considering cutting as many as 8,000 jobs.</p></blockquote>
<p>Can you say crony capitalism?  As Paul notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Seriously, the Gramm connection tells you all you need to know about where a McCain administration would stand on financial issues: squarely against any significant reform.</p></blockquote>
<p>Then again – McCain seems to listen more to Art Laffer than Phil Gramm on fiscal policy.  Ahem!</p>

<p><strong>How bad things get</strong> at Harvard</p>
<blockquote><p>An e-mail from the assistant to an incredibly distinguished Harvard colleague (names deleted to protect the innocent):<br />X [very distinguished Harvard professor] asked me to see if he can get on your calendar to have a lunch with him and Y [another distinguished professor] in the near future. I say that of course, knowing that X&#8217;s calendar is incredibly complicated, but I am happy to try to offer times if you give me some of your calendar constraints.<br />Now wait a minute. Let me see if I get this straight. X would like to have lunch with me, but X, you see, is so-oo busy that it will be really tough to find room in his calendar for me, and even though maybe, just maybe, something will be possible, I shouldn&#8217;t get my hopes too high&#8230;?</p></blockquote>
<p>There are all sorts of interpretations, innocent or not, but I found the note incredibly funny.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20080325-ip-hypocrisy-us-likes-wto-rulings-only-when-it-wins.html">Arstechnica</a> had thoughts on WTO mediation and US indignation about IP rights.</p>
<blockquote><p>The second case concerns Antigua and Barbuda, a small Caribbean country home to all sorts of online vices, including gambling and DRM circumvention. Antigua took the US to the WTO years ago over charges that the US was unfairly criminalizing access to Antiguan gambling websites while still allowing US-based horse racing sites to function. The WTO ruled against the US on several occasions, including a 2007 ruling that found the US had not yet bothered to comply with previous rulings.</p>
<p>In retaliation, Antigua has announced a radical plan in an attempt to force its larger neighbor to play ball. The Antiguan government has recently stated that it will allow piracy of US intellectual property such as movies and movies unless the US changes its gambling policy (though this move has yet to be authorized by the WTO).</p>
<p>Apparently, it&#8217;s easy to get hot and bothered when it&#8217;s industries from your country that claim to be badly affected by rules elsewhere. When it comes to the claims of other countries, though, even claims that have been validated by the WTO, it&#8217;s much easier to see the complexity of the situation, to spend years arguing those complexities before judges, and to do nothing even when compelled by rulings.</p>
<p>This sort of behavior makes it that much harder to assert some kind of moral high ground when China, Russia, and others pick and choose which of their WTO obligations they are going to comply with.</p></blockquote>
<p>Certainly a David and Goliath situation, but moral symbols have a way of boomeranging when trying to make your case in another arena. Just in case you were wondering.</p>

<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>Diana Henriques at the New York TImes has a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/28/business/28commodities.html">fascinating article on Odd Crop Prices</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Economists note there should not be two prices for one thing at the same place and time. Could a drugstore sell two identical tubes of toothpaste, and charge 50 cents more for one of them? Of course not.</p>
<p>But, in effect, exactly that has been happening, repeatedly and mysteriously, in trading that sets prices for corn, soybeans and wheat — three of America’s biggest crops and, lately, popular targets for investors pouring into the volatile commodities market. Economists who have been studying this phenomenon say they are at a loss to explain it.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason, the price for a bushel of grain set in the derivatives markets has been substantially higher than the simultaneous price in the cash market.</p>
<p>When that happens, no one can be exactly sure which is the accurate price in these crucial commodity markets, an uncertainty that can influence food prices and production decisions around the world.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>A futures contract is an agreement to deliver a specific amount of a commodity — 5,000 bushels of wheat, say — on a certain date in the future. Such contracts are important hedging tools for farmers, grain elevators, commodity processors and anyone with a stake in future grain prices. A futures contract that calls for delivery of wheat in July may trade for more or less for each bushel than today’s cash market price. But as each day goes by, its price should move a bit closer to that day’s cash price. And on expiration day, when the bushels of wheat covered by that futures contract are due for delivery, their price should very nearly match the price in the cash market, allowing for a little market friction or major delivery disruptions like Hurricane Katrina.</p>
<p>But on dozens of occasions since early 2006, the futures contracts for corn, wheat and soybeans have expired at a price that was much higher than that day’s cash price for those grains.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>What is not happening in these markets is equally mysterious. Normally, price disparities like these are quickly exploited by arbitrage traders who buy goods in the cheap market and sell them in the expensive one. Their buying and selling quickly brings the prices back into balance — but that is not happening here.</p>
<p>“These are highly competitive markets with very experienced traders,” he said. “Yet they are leaving these profits alone? It just doesn’t make sense.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Someone is leaving money on the table. Farm product futures prices are much higher than farm product prices even as time goes to zero. We  have farmers up the gazoo around here, so I could actually buy and  deliver a freight car full of broccoli seeds and make some money off a broccoli seed speculator.</p>
<p>My informed friend tells me that this is another sign of too much  money, too few investment opportunities. The money has now sloshed into the commodities market and is distorting prices there. I am more  inclined to believe that this has something to do with investment  grade sardines and a decoupling of commodities and boxcars.</p>
<p>Does anyone else have any ideas?</p>

                                <p>This one is by ILSM.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>Here is a link to  some <a href="http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d08572t.pdf"> testimony from the GAO</a> (hat-tip to rdan):</p>
<blockquote><p>GAO has raised concerns about increasing [DoD] reliance on contractors to perform agency missions.</p></blockquote>
<p>GAO states that agencies have been challenged, meaning they fail, at determining what work should be retained and which should be contracted. The GAO also noted issues with oversight &#8220;including addressing risks, ethics concerns, and surveillance needs&#8221;. </p>
<p>I have seen the risks listed by GAO, both as a government employee and as one of the contractors. Here are some risks: level of effort and best effort services contracts where the government &#8220;ordered&#8221; labor categories and full time equivalents instead of services and then never measured the deliveries. Substantiated receiving reports with weekly records of meetings attended, conflate attending meetings with productivity as Scott Admas has noted. Government pays a very high salaried labor rate for &#8220;work&#8221;, not performance, done at much less difficulty [pay a rocket scientist&#8217;s rate to do power point charts] and at full time hours when there is no service provided worth the time or rate. Ethics issues abound: hire friends, recently retired, for made up work, at excellent rates to do best effort. Be good to the contractors so when you retire you get in on the gravy train.</p>
<p>The sole determinant of the value of services delivered was the front line employee benefitting with no regard for what the mission got from the &#8220;support&#8221;.</p>
<p>Surveillance is not done, the contracting officer does not understand requirements and there is no checking to see what labor hours went to what billing and what results could be seen for the billed effort or hours or labor rate.</p>
<p>Then do the service make any sense? Like making sure that contractors supposedly doing non personal services but interchangeable with employees, avoid compromising privacy act information on presidential candidates.</p>
<p>GAO met with commanders deploying in 2006 who said their &#8220;pre-deployment training did not provide them with sufficient information on the extent of contractor support that they would be relying on.&#8221;</p>
<p>In other words the soldiers have to provide &#8220;force protection&#8221; for contractors, if the contractors were soldiers they would carry rifles and not burden the soldiers they are supposed to support. A steep price for not having soldiers doing support.</p>
<p>Shifting gears the report talks about depot maintenance. They comment on how much work &#8220;needs&#8221; to be done in-house [congressional depot caucus passed laws which require certain repair work, called &#8220;core&#8221; be done in government arsenals] and how much is contracted out. They conclude that &#8220;core maintenance capability has not always been developed&#8221;. This means the acquiring activity, like the program manager buying the Airbus refueler uses the money that should have been invested in setting up core maintenance for overruns somewhere else.</p>
<p>Finally, they state that the reasons such as savings and effective repairs with quick repair &#8220;turns&#8221; for using contracted maintenance are not realized and &#8220;it is uncertain to what extent cost savings have occurred or will occur.&#8221; GAO does not correlate this finding with past audits where they concluded that DoD use of logistics contracts never yielded required performance at the cost contracted.</p>
<p>This report understates the problems and inefficiencies of contracting to perform services for the federal government. It would be politically difficult to cut back on the service contractors, with PACs supported by the financial power of the contractors which have more than doubled in cost since 9/11.</p>
<p>Contractors have infiltrated to the point they make work for each other, find new opportunities for their level of effort services and cannot be distinguished from government folks.</p>
<p>Level of effort is synonym with make work.</p>
<p>And I do not think GAO has scratched the surface on advisory and assistance services contractors, who do services which are not &#8220;commercial services&#8221;. Where they often double up to make life easy and comfortable for the government workers, painting rocks and starching fatigues.</p>
<p>In the not too distant past, I got in &#8220;trouble&#8221; as a government employee for not going to unnecessary, make work training developed conducted by a contractor.  Contractors more and more get involved in painting the rocks and helping with &#8220;breaking starch&#8221;.</p>
<p>National security has been a growth industry the past 7 years.</p>

<p>Its seeing an agency that represents the people of the United States take an ill-advised action at the request of corrupt nepotists who claim to be on our side but really aren&#8217;t by spending reams of money and failing to pull it off.  Its one thing to show extremely poor judgement .  Its another thing to show weakness.</p>

                                <p>What was that about the surge working again?  <a href="http://www.juancole.com/2008/03/police-mutiny-refuse-to-attack-sadrists.html">Juan Cole</a> reports on the fighting between Maliki’s v. Sadr’s forces:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Times of Baghdad reports in Arabic that clashes continued on Friday between Iraqi government forces and the Mahdi Army in Baghdad and the provinces of the middle Euphrates and the south, causing hundreds of casualties, including among women, children and the elderly. The fighting also did damage to Iraq&#8217;s infrastructure, as well as to oil facilities and pipelines, damage that might run into the billions of dollars. The US got drawn into the fighting on Friday. US planes bombed alleged Mahdi Army positions both in Basra and in Sadr City in Baghdad (as well as in Kadhimiya). Kadhimiya is a major Shiite shrine neighborhood in northwest Baghdad, and the spectacle of the US bombing it is very unlikely to win Washington any friends among Iraqi Shiites. Despite the US intervention, government troops were unable to pierce Mahdi Army defenses or over-run their positions. Al-Zaman says that the police force in Basra suffered numerous mutinies and instances of insubordination, with policemen refusing to fire on the Mahdi Army. The government response was to undertake a widespread purge of disloyal elements &#8230; In the meantime, Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki called for a decisive military victory and rejected calls by southern tribal sheikhs and a large number of Shiite ayatollahs for him to engage in dialogue and negotiation in order to reach a ceasefire and to save civilians who are threatened with a humanitarian catastrophe from shortages of water and food, as well as lack of medical care. At the same time, Al-Zaman maintains, the Sadrists stipulated that al-Maliki and his brother-in-law, who heads the emergency forces that have been sent down to Basra from Baghdad and Basra, must withdraw.  The Iraqi minister of defense, Abdul Qadir Jasim, admitted in a news conference in Basra that the militiamen had taken the Iraqi security forces off guard. He added that the Iraqi government had expected this operation to be routine, but was surprised at the level of resistance, and was forced to change its plans and tactics.</p></blockquote>
<p>While Maliki might have hoped to crush Sadr, things aren’t going so well.  Especially given the fact that some of his forces refuse to fire on their countrymen.  Well – at least Maliki can count on US soldiers to carry out his political goals.  But remind me again – why the hell do we remain in this middle of this quagmire?</p>

Anyone  know where I can find historical data (going back to 1964 or 1952, if possible) on the typical expenditures (housing, food, transportation, etc.) by the average person.  I&#8217;ve found some of that going back to 1980 in the NIPA tables, and some food prices going back about the same time at the BLS, but nothing on total average expenditures.</p>
