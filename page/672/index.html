                                <p><a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2008/03/grim-outlook-for-jp-morgan.html">Yves Smith</a> has a post about JPM&#8217;s buyout of Bear Stearns, that, coincidentally, says something that I was thinking when I woke up this morning.  If I hadn&#8217;t read his post, I might have written something like this myself after letting it simmer for a bit:</p>
<blockquote><p>A hedge fund correspondent pointed us to an article at Institutional Risk Analytics on the Bear-JP Morgan deal. While we don&#8217;t subscribe to its view that Bear was &#8220;raped&#8221; (please, the firm was going to file for bankruptcy a week ago Monday), it contains an intriguing analysis of JP Morgan.</p>
<p>Differing with popular opinion, IRA argues that JPM is far from a financially strong institution. It has the highest gearing of any of the three large US banks (and remember, that includes the CDO-laden, walking wounded Citigroup) and by their measures, also has the highest level of economic risk per their metrics. JPM&#8217;s chickens have not yet come home to roost because its book is heavily weighed toward consumer business, and those problems are coming to the fore later. (The cognoscenti may take issue with their use of RAROC as another measure, but I&#8217;m not troubled when making cross company comparisons if you have access only to published financials).</p>
<p>Although IRA does not say so explicitly, the reasoning appears to be that the Fed pushed Bear into JPM&#8217;s arms as a way to shore up JPM. If asking a firm to take on a $13 trillion derivatives book, of which only $2 trillion is exchange traded, is a favor, I&#8217;d hate to see what punishment looks like.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Fed is guaranteeing JPM it will cover any losses if JPM buys BS.  That started out as a $2 a share gift to BS shareholders (since the value of BS&#8217; assets without any assurances from the Fed are exceeded by its obligations) and now that gift seems about to get sweetened.</p>
<p>But&#8230;  I was wondering, why not give the gift directly?  Why do it in this convoluted way?  My first thought was &#8211; well, if you go through JPM, its somewhat more opaque (and hence less likely to raise the taxpayer&#8217;s ire).  But the Fed could be opaque in more direct ways too&#8230;  which leaves one thing&#8230;  for whatever reason, the Fed wants to provide a gift to JPM too.</p>
<p>And BTW, <a href="http://atbozzo.blogspot.com/2008/03/efficient-markets-and-stock-arbitrage.html">Ken Houghton</a> has another collection of follow-ups to this mess.</p>

                                <p>Reader ILSM has sent in a few posts in recent weeks about the military&#8217;s decision to replace its existing fleet of fuel tankers.  (See <a rhef="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/03/ilsm-on-why-airbus-tanker-won-usaf.html">here</a> and <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/03/ilsm-on-new-air-refueling-tanker.html">here</a>.)</p>
<p>Today, he sends in a follow-up&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>A little more on what is &#8220;superior&#8221;, and is it worth the extra money sent to Airbus?.</p>
<p>From a logistics standpoint there is a lot of baggage [Caesar called it impedimenta] to deploy an Army or Marine Corps brigade sized formation, 1000 C-17 sorties to deliver 5000 troops and 700 plus vehicles, 100 plus sorties per day to sustain the formation in a place where there is not enough fuel to fill the airlifters going out with medivacs and retrograde logistics. If you have to refuel in the air to get them in it is highly unlikely there will be any fuel at destination to get them out. Or run any mechanized infantry operations. The likelihood of this mission succeeding is remote. The costs to attempt it huge. Think the Khe Sanh seige with the support bases 5000 miles away.</p>
<p>Only priceless to the generals and their careers with Northrop or Boeing or Lockheed.</p>
<p>Remote southwest Asia places with no infrastructure pose no danger to the US. Unless we want to re-enact Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a quaote from a Seattle Post Intelligencer story on March 21st (Bloomberg News Tony Capaccio): </p>
<blockquote><p>The Air Force would require 22 fewer Northrop [Airbus 18 wheelers] tankers to meet classified homeland defense and combat scenarios [Do not know if it is brigade sized] covering the Pacific and Southwest Asia required in the competition, according to a document that outlined the service&#8217;s selection criteria.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, a key decision is based on classified scenario.  Many wasteful blunders are hidden behind the national security need to keep the public in the dark about how their money is wasted.</p>
<p>We do not know the feasibility of doing the classified mission at all given the huge amounts of fuel required in such remote regions.</p>
<p>The &#8220;saving&#8221; of 22 tankers [pick up truck sized] is at what costs [using 18 wheelers for the 99.97% of the tasks not needing an 18 wheeler]? The more airplanes represents redundancy [multiple server queuing model], but the classified scenario is for people buying in to the mistake.</p>
<p>Before McCain killed the KC 767 in 2003 the Air Force used footprint, and weight as deciding factors.  The KC 767 is lighter requires less &#8220;real estate&#8221; and will operate out of more airfields and have a significantly lower operating costs [24% less fuel, proportionately less supply and maintenance].</p>
<p>The A330 maximum gross take off weight: 507,000 pounds, wing span:  198 feet</p>
<p>The B767 maximum gross take off weight: 395,000 pounds, wing span: 156 feet</p>
<p>Unit prices of the two airplanes are similarly different but phony Airbus subsidized pricing was used by the selecting official.  Weight is a determining factor in both unit cost to deliver the airplane and operating costs.  The Air Force somehow derived the life cycle cost for the two very diverse airplanes to be the same.  This would only be possible if the A330 fleet were reduced to 139 airplanes.  I doubt that the number of airplanes was reduced.</p>
<p>A Boeing study with an independent analyst estimates the 767 to use 24% less fuel over the same outcomes as the A330. This is consistent with the weigh difference.</p>
<p>Loren Thompson has more detail on the Air Force scoring <a href="http://lexingtoninstitute.org/printer_1234.shtml">here</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p>The teams tied in most measures [of &#8220;capability&#8221;, an arcane Rumsfeldian term for desk flying strategist dreams of what&#8217;s good for the future structure of the DoD and industry where the good second careers are], but the Northrop offering was deemed to offer superior refueling and airlift capacity {Note capacity is not &#8220;capability&#8221;, capacity is the load, &#8220;capability&#8221; is the long term utility and revenue products of the system, larger loads on fewer flights means the system needs serious reliability and dependability, not to get wonky on what the Europeans don&#8217;t do well] at 1,000 nm. range and substantially superior refueling and airlift capability [dissembling here he means capacity, capability is not going to be proven until the USAF realizes it has another too expensive undependable system] at 2,000 nm. range. The superior airlift capacity of Northrop&#8217;s plane was deemed a &#8220;compelling&#8221; consideration in giving Northrop the edge for this factor.</p></blockquote>
<p>Air fields supporting refueling of heavy airlifters require either huge storage and time to fill it or dedicated pipeline delivery of enough fuel for the cargo planes.</p>
<p>The marginal utility of the 2000 nm offload is approximately zero.</p>
<p>The only use of this kind of mix of range and weight is subject to being classified as it is a ridiculous operation and national security demands citizens not know that the Air Force buys stuff to do the ridiculous at huge costs.</p>
<p>The acquisition officials will assure you the decisions were made on &#8220;best value&#8221;, but the definition of &#8220;best value&#8221; is arcane and has to be classified.</p>
<p>There are over 400 &#8216;missions areas&#8217; in the military industrial complex a few much larger, many about the same expense, all of which are bought at &#8220;best value&#8221; to deliver capabilities that not linked to any real threat.</p>
<p>So, bottom line, national security demands the waste of 4% of GDP so that the generals benefit and buy things to do what will never be done.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>

<blockquote><p>In reality, of course, the US does not have a dollar policy – other than letting the market determine its value. The US government does not intervene in the foreign exchange market to support the dollar, and the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy certainly is not directed toward such a goal. Nor is the Fed specifically aiming to lower the dollar’s value. Although cutting the Federal Funds interest rate from 5.25% in the summer of 2007 to 3% now contributes to dollar depreciation, this has been aimed at stimulating a weakening economy … the Treasury’s only explicit currency goal now is to press the Chinese to raise the value of the renminbi, thereby reducing the dollar’s global trade-weighted average. The pressure on China is, however, entirely consistent with the broader US policy of encouraging countries to allow the financial market to determine their currencies’ exchange rate. There is, of course, truth to the statement that a strong dollar benefits the American public, since it allows Americans to buy foreign products at a lower cost in dollars. But, while the declining dollar does reduce Americans’ purchasing power, the magnitude of this effect is not large, because imports account for only about 15% of US gross domestic product. A 20% dollar depreciation would therefore reduce Americans’ purchasing power by only 3%. At the same time, the lower dollar makes American products more competitive in global markets, leading to increased exports and reduced imports. The dollar has declined during the past two years against not only the euro but also against most other currencies, including the Japanese yen and the renminbi. On a real trade-weighted basis, the dollar is down about 13% relative to its value in March 2006. This improved competitiveness of American goods and services is needed to shrink the massive US trade deficit. Even with the dollar’s decline and the resulting 25% rise in US exports over the past two years, the US still had an annualized trade deficit at the end of fourth quarter of 2007 of about $700 billion (5% of GDP). Because US imports are nearly twice as large as US exports, it takes a 20% increase in exports to balance a 10% increase in imports. That means that the dollar must fall substantially further to shrink the trade deficit to a sustainable level.</p></blockquote>
<p>Indeed – the dollar devaluation enhances the potency of expansionary monetary policy as it tries to alleviate the impending recession.  While Feldstein concedes that European policy makers are concerned about the recent dollar devaluation, he notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Instead of simply wishing that the dollar would stop falling, European governments need to take steps to stimulate domestic demand to replace the loss of sales and jobs that will otherwise accompany the more competitive dollar. This is not an easy task, because the European Central Bank must remain vigilant about rising inflation, and because many EU countries maintain large fiscal deficits. While the ECB has limited room for maneuver, regulatory changes and revenue-neutral shifts in the tax structure (for example, a temporary investment tax credit financed by a temporary increase in the corporate tax rate) could provide the stimulus needed to offset declining net exports. It is therefore important that EU governments turn their attention to this challenge.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words – if there is a concern that European aggregate demand might also fall, let the European governments join the US in <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/03/bruce-bartlett-wants-more-effective.html">smart fiscal policy</a>.  Oh wait!</p>

                                <p>Regular readers know I&#8217;ve been working on a book with a co-author who will, for the moment, remain nameless.  We completed a first draft a month or so ago, and have attracted some interest from a good agent, who will also, for the moment, remain nameless.</p>
<p>The book looks at a range of topics, from economic growth to abortion to crime to wage growth, and ranks presidents on how they did.  It also provides a bit of explanation for why we see what we did.  Its an approach similar to one I&#8217;ve followed on many posts here, and so should look familiar to Angry Bear readers.</p>
<p>But&#8230;  the agent came back with some comments, and to be honest, I agree with them.  So I figured I&#8217;d ask for some suggestions on how to deal with the two main (related) problems:</p>
<p>1.  Our agent says he felt he was suffering from information overflow.  One chapter is fine, two is better, but after a few chapters, its almost too much information.<br />2.  The book reads like a series of unconnected essays, and doesn&#8217;t have some backbone that ties it all it together.</p>
<p>So, in effect, we need some sort of connective tissue and narrative that makes it all come together, plus a bit less information.  Anyone have any suggestions?</p>
<p>Thanks!!</p>

<blockquote><p>Progressives usually fight for the interests of those at the middle and bottom at the expense of those on top. However, during this period of unprecedented financial crisis, when the Wall Street rich are begging for the helping hand of the government, most progressives appear to be on the sidelines. Rather than taking advantage of this extraordinary opportunity to reduce inequality and educate the public about how the economy really works, progressive voices have been unusually quiet.<br />    While the basic story on the economic crisis should be well known, it is nonetheless worth repeating. The Federal Reserve Board allowed the growth of an $8 trillion housing bubble ($110,000 of housing bubble wealth for every homeowner) in the years from 1996 to 2006. While this bubble was easily recognizable to competent <a href="http://www.cepr.net/index.php/publications/reports/the-run-up-in-home-prices-is-it-real-or-is-it-another-bubble/" target="_blank">economists</a>, the entire political and financial establishments managed to ignore the housing bubble until it began to burst last year.<br /><strong>&#8230;<br /></strong><br />     As an alternative to bailing out the banks, we can temporarily change the rules on foreclosure to give homeowners the right to rent at the fair market <a href="http://www.cepr.net/index.php/op-eds-columns/op-eds-columns/the-subprime-borrower-protection-plan/" target="_blank">rate</a>. This would provide them with security in their home. More importantly, it would likely create a situation where most homeowners stay in their house as owners, since banks would rather renegotiate mortgage terms than end up as landlords.<br />    The Wall Street boys got themselves in a huge mess through their own greed and stupidity. Now is the time to make sure they enjoy the fruits of their labor. These are the same people who don&#8217;t think they should have to pay higher taxes so kids can get health care and childcare. There is no reason the rest of us should pay higher taxes so they can keep their mansions in the Hamptons, their private jets and retinue of personal services. Let&#8217;s leave this one to the market.</p></blockquote>

<p>Digging Out of the Recession<br />by Peter Morici</p>
<p>The U.S. economy is in recession with no end in sight. Falling housing prices are blamed, but the root causes are bad economic policies and lousy banking practices.</p>
<p>U.S. imports exceed exports by more than $700 billion, thanks mostly to expensive oil and lopsided commerce with China. To finance this gap, Americans sell bonds and other securities to foreigners, and Wall Street banks, like Citigroup and Merrill Lynch, recycle those funds to American consumers.</p>
<p>U.S. consumers borrow from mortgage companies, local banks and finance companies through mortgages, auto loans and credit cards. Those firms sell the loans to Wall Street banks, who bundle loans into bonds for sale to big fixed income investors. The Chinese government, Middle East royals and other foreign investors purchase huge sums of such U.S. interest bearing securities.</p>
<p>Last year, this scheme started coming unglued, because many homeowners borrowed more than their paychecks and home values could support. Loan officers encouraged home buyers to exaggerate incomes on mortgage applications and hired real estate appraisers that would inflate home values. Wall Street disguised bad loans in complex derivatives, instead of creating simple bonds, which fooled fixed income investors into believing they were buying securities backed by solid loans. Other rouses propagated like aggressive adjustable rate mortgages, and bogus credit default swaps alleged to make risks disappear.</p>
<p>When the worst bonds failed—those backed by subprime adjustable rate mortgages—the fixed income market closed to U.S. banks.</p>
<p>Banks don’t have enough deposits to make all the loans the U.S. economy needs, because Americans increasingly by-pass banks, investing directly in mutual funds, retirement accounts and the like. Hence, banks must turn about half of their loans into bonds.</p>
<p>Now investors, ranging from U.S. insurance companies to foreign investors, are not willing to buy bonds from U.S. banks, and banks cannot make enough loans to credit-worthy homebuyers, consumers and businesses. Housing prices plummet, car sales sink, businesses can’t invest, and the economy tanks into recession.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve has cut interest rates and temporarily loaned banks $600 billion dollars, but those steps help little because the bond market is closed to banks.</p>
<p>Moreover, foreign investors are getting nervous about all the money they have loaned Americans to finance huge trade deficits. They are fleeing the dollar by moving cash into euro denominated securities, gold, oil, and other investments.</p>
<p>Fixing the trade deficit will require Americans to use less gasoline and balance commerce with China. Americans must either let the price of gas double to force conservation or accept tougher mileage standards cars. Fifty miles a gallon by 2020, instead of the 35 required by current law, is achievable, but that means more hybrids and lighter vehicles.</p>
<p>China subsidizes exports by selling its currency, the yuan, for dollars at artificially low values in foreign exchange markets, making Chinese goods artificially cheap at Wal-Mart. The U.S. government should tax dollar-yuan conversions at a rate equal to China’s subsidy until China stops manipulating currency markets. That would reduce imports from, and increase exports to, China.</p>
<p>Finally, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke are working to clean up the practices of mortgage brokers, loan officers and real estate appraisers but Wall Street banks must be willing to create simple bonds from mortgages and other loans that investors can understand and whose risks can be reasonably accessed. This is less profitable than the complex bonds and derivatives that were sold prior to the subprime meltdown.</p>
<p>Paulson and Bernanke should bring together the largest banks and fixed income investors, among insurance companies and the like, to lay out the requirements for such bonds and require the banks to stick to them.</p>
<p>Banks may resist, because plain vanilla mortgage underwriting doesn’t pay outsized fees and bonuses they have been spoiled to expect from complex derivatives. However, Americans need the banks to make mortgages and other loans to get the economy back on track, and Bernanke and Paulson have the leverage to bring them to the table—the $600 billion the Federal Reserve is loaning banks to keep them afloat.</p>
<p>It’s time to get realistic about using less oil and tough with China and the banks.</p>

<p>One of my interests is Global Warming. While visiting the many global warming sites I noticed that many of the questions had to do with finding the latest data and comments. Googling I found that there appeared to be very few sites that consolidate this kind of information. So, in an effort to help solve this problem I am starting <a href="http://www.globalwarmingclearinghouse.blogspot.com/">Global Warming Clearinghouse</a>.</p>
<p>If you have any suggestions, recommendations or preferred sources leave a comment at corev@comcast.net or <a href="http://www.globalwarmingclearinghouse.blogspot.com/">GWC</a>.<br />&#8230;&#8230;..</p>
<p>rdan here &#8211; This is a daunting task both from the variety of sciences involved, old versus new data, hyperbole written to date, and deciding what is &#8220;balanced&#8221;. However, it appeared it could be a way to start on a site dedicated to the topic. I had thoughts but will leave them in comments.</p>

                                <p>It seems <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/24/opinion/24bartlett.html?ex=1364097600&#038;en=f788f747316575f5&#038;ei=5124&#038;partner=permalink&#038;exprod=permalink">Bruce</a> never liked the tax rebate proposal for similar reasons that several others include <a href="http://econospeak.blogspot.com/2008/01/fiscal-stimulus-little-bang-for-buck.html">me</a> expressed: </p>
<blockquote><p>Despite the bipartisan support for the rebate, few economists have supported the idea. They note that we have tried rebates in the past — most recently in 2001 — and there is no evidence that they have meaningfully stimulated either consumption or growth. By and large, people saved the money they received or paid bills (which is the same thing); very few used their rebates to increase spending.  The true reason why the current rebate has been so popular in Washington is that giving away free money in an election year is good for politicians of both parties</p></blockquote>
<p>.</p>
<p>Bruce updates that old discussion noting what has changed in terms of the economic picture and proposes an alternative means for using fiscal stimulus:</p>
<blockquote><p>But in the almost six weeks since the rebate legislation was signed into law, the economic situation has changed. The meltdown in financial markets is much more serious than it looked in February. At its root are bad mortgages and other debts that are like toxic waste spreading throughout the financial system. The solution, therefore, is not to drop $100 bills from helicopters — which is essentially what the rebate would do. Rather, what we need is a mortgage Superfund that can clean up the toxic waste. If we can cleanse the financial system of at least some of the bad debts, it will do far more to restore the economy to health than anything that could be accomplished by the rebate — even if the rebate were to work as it is supposed to.We all know that the government is eventually going to get stuck with a lot of the bad debts, just as it did in the early 1990s when a previous housing bubble burst and bankrupt savings and loans had to be rescued. That bailout cost taxpayers $160 billion. The next one will probably cost more because the problem is bigger and the economy is larger.  At the same time, there are increasing demands for targeted relief for homeowners facing foreclosure. It looks to many people as if Washington cares more about fat-cat bankers than working families in hard times. At some point, Congress is going to respond with additional aid for people caught in the mortgage mess, and this relief will come on top of the $117 billion cost of the rebate. We need to stop and ask whether we can afford to spend $117 billion that the Treasury Department does not have on a program of dubious effectiveness. It simply makes no sense to send out checks to people who have no need for it as some kind of election-year bribe to vote for incumbents of both parties. That money would go a long way toward cleaning up the mortgages that are poisoning the financial sector. Congress should immediately repeal the rebate and redirect the money that has been budgeted into a package of measures that would help the housing sector and those people who actually need assistance. The Treasury might use some of the money, for example, to enable Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored housing agencies, to buy up some of the bad mortgages, get them off bank balance sheets and help homeowners refinance them.</p></blockquote>

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>To follow up my post on this  <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/03/question-forabout-conservatives-and.html">recession</a>, I&#8217;d like to note something else that&#8217;s kind of odd about the recession.  Regular readers know I think the Fed is often at least partly at fault for recessions when we get them.  (I&#8217;ll be backing up this claim with data below, don&#8217;t worry.)   That doesn&#8217;t seem to be true here.  Sure, the Fed helped create conditions that led to the asset bubble&#8230;  but it wasn&#8217;t involved in the conditions that led to the end of that bubble at this time, nor did it excessively tighten money.</p>
<p>OK.  Let&#8217;s go to the data.  Take <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h6/hist/h6hist1.txt">Seasonally Adjusted M1</a> (which goes back to 1959), and adjust it for <a href="ftp://ftp.bls.gov/pub/special.requests/cpi/cpiai.txt">inflation</a>.  You&#8217;ll note that real M1 has been shrinking over time &#8211; cash has been getting less important over time.   No surprise &#8211; in the last few decades, we&#8217;ve had the evolution of plenty of new methods of paying for transactions or saving, from checks to credit cards to shares of stock and exotic derivatives&#8230;</p>
<p>Between 1959 and 2007, there were a total of 588 months.  94 of those were spent in recession, or 16% of the time.  If you consider recessions plus the twelve months before a recession, that&#8217;s 30.3% of the time.  (Of course, I&#8217;m using the recession dates provided by the <a href="http://www.nber.org/">NBER</a>.  Also, the data and analysis used in this post can be found <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=p_ax_fywYILjx7HMk-qBYKQ">here</a>.)</p>
<p>Now, there are 28 instances in which the Fed dropped real M1 by at least 3.5% from where it had been three months later.  (Interestingly, it often happens in March&#8230; presumably, its good to have a lot of money sloshing around at the end of the year during Christmas season.)</p>
<p>Now, here&#8217;s the cool thing&#8230;. 17 of the 28 months where we observed a decrease of 3.5% or more from the month 3 months prior, or 61% of them, occur either during a recession or within twelve months prior to a recession.  Another cool thing&#8230;  there are seven recessions during this period, and every single one of them begins no more than 12 months after a time we observe a 3.5% decrease in real M1.  Every single one.  Its hard to conclude a big drop in real M1 doesn&#8217;t have something to do with recessions, both getting us into them and keeping us in them.  Not all periods where we see such a drop are associated with recessions, but we&#8217;ll look at that in a moment.</p>
<p>Of these 28 instances in which the Fed drops real M1 by at least 3.5% in a 3 month period, Dems are in the Oval Office 15 of them, of about 54% of the time (Note that the President is a Republican 59% of the months in the sample as a whole&#8230; so we clearly aren&#8217;t seeing these big decreases in real M1 being randomly distributed.)</p>
<p>And here&#8217;s another interesting factette&#8230; what about those cases where we see this big cut in real M1 but don&#8217;t see a recession follow?   It turns out that happens eleven times&#8230;  and in eight cases there&#8217;s a Democrat in office. </p>
<p>So in terms of politics&#8230; what we see is that the Fed is much more likely to cut real M1 by a lot when there&#8217;s a Dem in office, and the economy has been much, much more likely to make it through such a cut in real M1 without suffering a recession when a Dem is in office.  The end result, of course, is that the percentage of time that the economy is in recession when the President is a Republican is much higher than the percentage of time that the economy is in recession when the President is a Democrat.</p>
<p>Now, back to the current mess&#8230;  since every single one of the seven previous recessions for which we can compute real M1 using data on the Fed&#8217;s website was preceded by a cut of 3.5% or more in the three month real M1, the natural question is&#8230;.  is that true this time too?  As with many things involving GW, the answer is&#8230; No.  If there&#8217;s one recession that wasn&#8217;t at last partly triggered by the Fed, this one is it.</p>
<p>Which leads to my question from yesterday&#8217;s post, yet again &#8211; why are we seeing a recession now, at this time, so soon after the last one.  The last time we see a recession so soon after the previous one, Reagan was in office.  The last time we saw a President with two recessions in his term, Nixon was in office.  Unless the last few decades have been a major aberration, an ordinary business cycle shouldn&#8217;t be bringing us to a recession so soon.  So to repeat:  why are we seeing a recession now, given that GW has gotten everything he&#8217;s wanted &#8211; tax cuts, help from the Fed, reduced regulation, even two wars (and remember &#8211; Conservatives and libertarians credit WW2 with ending the recession, not FDR)?  Could the conservative or libertarian model have predicted such a thing?  </p>
