<p><a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080507/ap_on_bi_go_ec_fi/economy">Martin Crutsinger</a> reports – and opines:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Labor Department reported Wednesday that productivity, the amount of output per hour of work, increased at an annual rate of 2.2 percent in the first quarter. That was slightly higher than the 1.5 percent increase which had been expected.  In a sign that inflation could be easing, labor cost pressures slowed a bit. Unit labor costs rose at an annual rate of 2.2 percent, down from a 2.8 percent rise in the final three months of last year. While rising wages and benefits are good for employees, those increases can lead to higher inflation if businesses are forced to boost the cost of their products to cover the higher payroll costs. However, if productivity is increasing it allows businesses to finance higher wages out of the increased output.</p></blockquote>
<p>He is assuming that the higher productivity is attributable to strong real GDP growth but real GDP growth has been quite weak for the past two quarters.  Could it be that the ratio of output to labor hours rose because fewer people have jobs?  Perhaps as his report later notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Private economists believe the weakening economy will dampen inflation pressures. However, the sharp economic slowdown is occurring at the same time that energy and food prices have continued to rise.  Many analysts think that the country has already toppled into a recession. But overall economic growth, as measured by the gross domestic product, eked out a tiny 0.6 percent rate of increase in the first three months of the year, the same anemic pace as the final three months of last year. The rise in productivity in the first three months of the year occurred as the number of hours worked declined at an annual rate of 1.8 percent.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let me also object to his concern that nominal wages were rising too quickly.  If nominal wages fail to keep pace with rising consumer prices, we see reduced real wages.  As our graph of the real wage for nonsupervisory workers show, real wages for some have not increased that much over the past five years.</p>

<div></div>
<div>Outcome II shows the standard narrative. A Trust Fund Ratio rising to a peak in 2017  then a more or less rapid falloff to zero as the first the interest is tapped and then the principal is redeemed with the result of total Trust Fund Depletion in 2041.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Outcome III or High Cost shows the same process only accelerated.</div>
<div></div>
<div>But Outcome I or Low Cost shows a much different picture. The Trust Fund ratio peaks at about 450 about 2020 then dips to 390 by around 2040 as a portion of the interest is tapped but after a period of plateau sharply increases through the remainder of the 75 year actuarial window. This is quite literally the picture of a potentially overfunded Social Security system. Is a Low Cost outcome guaranteed? Well no. Is it possible? Certainly the numbers are not at all outlandish and perfectly in line with economic performance over the last fifteen years.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Can we at least talk about the implications of this?</div>
<p>Well I just copied this over from the Bruce Web in response to a comment from Jim A on the previous post. Some explanation of terminology is in order here. First the three curves represent the three different alternatives supplied by the Trustees. The only one generally reported in outcome II or Intermediate Cost, with the other two (High Cost and Low Cost) supposedly representing the outward bounds. In point of fact for the years 1997 to 2004 the deviation from Intermediate Cost was always in the direction of Low Cost and often exceeded its numbers.</p>
<p>Social Security solvency is measured in two ways. One is by payroll gap which is to say the amount that the payroll tax would have to be raised immediately or contrawise at Trust Fund Depletion to fully fund the current schedule of benefits. Per the 2008 Report those figures are 1.7% and 3.54% respectively, numbers that have trended down significantly since the 1997 Report. The second measure is Trust Fund Ratio which is to say Trust Fund assets measured as a function of time with 1 year = 100. Under current law (or perhaps simply practice) Actuarial Balance is defined as having a Trust Fund Ratio of 100 for each of the next 10 years (Short Term Actuarial Balance) or the next 75 years (Long Term Actuarial Balance). In 2003 a new measure was added which would have us evaluate actuarial balance over the &#8216;Infinite Future Horizon&#8217;. This was in my opinion a simple gimmick to allow opponents of Social Security to use really scary numbers rather than focus on the traditional and reasonable 75 year planning window, a window that pretty much covers the interests of most peoples children and grandchildren.</p>
<p>Now in examining the graph we can see Low Cost (outcome I) we see a sharp acceleration of the TF Ratio after 2060 with it exiting the 75 year window at 650. This is dangerously high, that is if we consider the Trust Fund and more significantly the interest it earns as being a real asset. And we should because otherwise we would be arguing for what pgl calls a backdoor employment tax that called on one sub-set of Americans to subsidize General Fund spending. And theoretically there is an argument to be had there but it sure puts &#8216;paid&#8217; to the &#8216;poor people don&#8217;t pay taxes&#8217; narrative the Right is so fond of. But in point of fact flattening the tail down to where the Trust Fund is at its nominal target of 100 is difficult, the only way of doing that is to starve the beast by cutting payroll tax rates and using General Fund dollars now rather than later to pay down the Trust Fund. Because the longer you wait the higher the proportion of Cost has to be born by the General Fund as opposed to FICA to keep interest on interest from bloating the TF. This is incidentally why cutting benefits or increasing revenues by such measures as raising the cap are counterproductive, they simply increase the amount of accrued interest without actually benefitting anyone today.</p>
<p>Of course this whole discussion is moot if we actually get outcome II or Intermediate Cost. Our choice of policy going forward is entirely dependent on whether future outcomes are closer to II or I which in turn requires an examination of the assumptions underlying Intermediate Cost and Low Cost in light of the fact that most of the bias over the last 12 years has been strongly to the upside. Yet all of the policy discussion to date simply clings to Intermediate Cost assumptions and considers the problem to be one of deficit in 2041 when it is not clear that is at all the most likely outcome.</p>
<p>Next post or so we&#8217;ll stick in some actual projected growth numbers. In the meanwhile you can ponder the implications of a $117 trillion Trust Fund in 2085 (Low Cost projection) <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/VI_OASDHI_dollars.html#150920">Table VI.F8.—Operations of the Combined OASI and DI Trust Funds, in Current Dollars, Calendar Years 2008-85 [In billions]</a></p>

<p>So I just want start easy, and take a look at three easy-to-compare data points:<br />First, <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/fomc/fundsrate.htm">the Federal Funds target rate</a> since 2007 (I include the last change in 2006 since it was the rate for the first 8.5 months of 2007):

<p>If you make money easier to get, standard theory says that people will get it.  While this raises the &#8220;threat&#8221; of inflation, it makes credit easier to get as well.  So the theory goes.</p>
<p>Steven J. Balassi (h/t <a href="http://www.26econ.com/newly-added-econ-blogs/">Aaron Schiff</a> for bringing his blog to my attention) <a href="http://worldlyeconomicthoughts.blogspot.com/2008/05/tighter-lending.html">notes that this isn&#8217;t happening</a>. Pull quote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Friends in the mortgage industry are telling me you have to be &#8220;rich&#8221; just to get a home loan now.</p></blockquote>
<p>Even granting I have <a href="http://atbozzo.blogspot.com/2008/05/our-house.html">a vested interest right now</a> in peole being able to get mortgages, this is keeping the market from clearing and expanding the housing crisis.  Again, contrary to the theory that easier money means, well, easier to get money.</p>
<p>So we have easier money and tighter credit.  The implication is that the banks are keeping that money, no circulating it. No wonder they <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2008/05/another-tool-fo.html">want to be paid interest on reserve requirements</a>.*</p>
<p>But what about the inflation fears of easier money? Surely, if the money is not circulating, that shouldn&#8217;t be a fear?</p>
<p>Not so fast, says <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2008/05/06/kc-feds-hoenig-worries-about-inflation-psychology/">Kansas City Fed  President Thomas Hoenig</a> (h/t <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2008/05/links-for-200-6.html">Mark Thoma</a>):<br />
<blockquote>Hoenig said rising inflationary pressures are &#8220;troublesome&#8221; and a &#8220;serious&#8221; matter. &#8220;The bigger concern is that these increases are beginning to generate an inflation psychology to an extent that I have not seen since the 1970s and early 1980s,&#8221; he said. Hoenig added that &#8220;there is a significant risk that higher inflation will become embedded in the economy and require significant monetary policy tightening to reduce it.&#8221; He tied rising prices primarily to overseas factors, including a &#8220;sizable decline&#8221; in the U.S. dollar’s value.</p></blockquote>
<p>Welcome to the Global Economy.  But Hoenig is sanguine about the Fed Funds rate, even if he is willing to use the R word:<br />
<blockquote>Hoenig’s views on the economy were relatively upbeat, even as he described the nation as being &#8220;at the brink of a recession.&#8221; He suggested interest rates were close to where they needed to be.</p>
<p>&#8220;The current accommodative stance should be sufficient to cushion the economy<br />from a deeper slowdown and the risks that financial disruptions could spill over to the broader economy,&#8221; he said. As the economy and markets improve &#8220;it will be necessary for the Federal Reserve to remove the policy accommodation in a timely manner.&#8221;</p>
<p>Citing &#8220;room for optimism,&#8221; Hoenig said &#8220;financial markets appear to have stabilized somewhat, and the economy should pick up in the second half of the year as fiscal and monetary stimulus take hold.&#8221; The official said he believe markets’ role in the current turmoil has been overstated, and that higher energy prices and housing woes have exacted the greater toll. He also said he believes the &#8220;credit crunch&#8221; hasn’t proved as damaging as some had feared.</p></blockquote>
<p>So there we have it.  We have inflation, but cutting rates was the right thing.  And the credit crunch isn&#8217;t too bad, even if only the rich can buy a house.  And that 325 basis points of easing in the past eight months just hasn&#8217;t gotten into the economy yet; give the banks another six months or so.</p>
<p>I feel better; how about you?</p>
<p>*Meanwhile, I am reliably informed that Bank of America just cut the rates on their (currently in place) contracts with consultants by 5-15%, depending on length of service (greater for longer).</p>

<blockquote><p>BAGHDAD &#8211; Forget rocket attacks, concrete blast walls and no sewer system and try picturing luxury hotels, a shopping center and even condos in the heart of Baghdad.</p>
<p>It’s all part of an ambitious five-year development “dream list” to transform the U.S.-protected Green Zone from a walled fortress into a gleaming centerpiece for Baghdad’s future.</p>
<p>The $5 billion plan has Pentagon backing and apparently the interest of leading hotel developers, said Navy Capt. Thomas Karnowski, who led the team that created the development plan.</p>
<p>Washington wants to create a “zone of influence” around the new $700 million U.S. Embassy to serve as a high-end buffer for the compound, whose total price tag will reach about $1 billion after all the workers and offices are relocated over the next year.</p>
<p>“When you have $1 billion hanging out there and 1,000 employees lying around, you kind of want to know who your neighbors are. You want to influence what happens in your neighborhood over time,” said Karnowski.</p>
<p>Karnowski said a deal was already completed for Marriott International Inc. to build a hotel in the Green Zone.</p>
<p>He also said a possible $1 billion investment could come from MBI International, a conglomerate that&#8230;.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, there you go.  Are they planning on a drawing down of US troops?</p>

                                <blockquote><p>The church currently leases space in the steeple for the antennas of two wireless phone companies, AT&#038;T and T-Mobile. The rent from these leases currently provides almost $70,000 of annual income to the church. Up until last year, the church leased space to three wireless companies. Because of industry consolidation, we lost one of these leases and the rent that it provided in June 2007.</p>
<p>We have been approached over the past several years by firms interested in purchasing our remaining two cell leases. These inquiries have been getting more and more attractive and the Board decided to fully investigate the possibility of selling our remaining two cell leases. We decided to hire an independent consultant to review the current proposals and to assist us in determining whether selling the two leases would be in the best long term interest of the Church. That consultant has completed his report and has concluded that it is financially beneficial to accept one of these offers at this time. Their report indicates that our offers are at the very top of the range for similar cell lease buyouts, and that market valuations are currently at a peak. </p>
<p>We will be taking this to the Congregational Meeting on May 18 for a presentation and vote, but our thorough analysis has revealed that there are several compelling reasons for selling our cell leases at this time, including: (1) obtaining a substantial sum of money ($$$,000) that can be used to significantly increase our endowment. This will enhance the financial stewardship of the church well into the future, and it will also have the added benefit of substantially increasing the annual distribution that the church receives each year from the trust, thereby helping to support our growth; and (2) eliminating the risk of losing one or both of our remaining cell leases and the significant negative impact this would have on our operating budget since each lease currently provides $35,000, approximately 10% of our annual budget. We already lost one of the original three leases due to industry consolidation, resulting in a loss of annual income of approximately $32,000 this year, and the remaining two have a right to terminate at any time with 90 days notice.</p></blockquote>
<p>I received the following note today, and it reminded me of cactus&#8217;s thoughts on the tax free status of churches, charitable deductions, and how money is used to qualify for &#8216;tax free&#8217; status of one kind or another. Sammy also challenged who gave more, conservatives or liberals, based on income and percentage claimed. </p>
<p>He used basketball courts as an example, but I also thought of Hagee, Wright, and others in the spotlight. It was also a couple weeks ago that about 30 teens and chaperons from this church went to New Orleans to help re-build a church and a house in the ninth ward of New Orleans, now a twice a year event.</p>
<p>It is worth exploring again the rules of what is worth worshipping, and how.  Each kind of giving has its own worth, but how does one measure worth without the use of money on a blog like this?</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p><a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/EconomistsView/~3/284935127/tax-policy-and.html">Mark Thoma</a> points to Thomas Palley playing lightning rod with &#8220;<a href="http://www.thomaspalley.com/?p=107">Tax Policy and the House Price Bubble</a>.&#8221;  With a title like that, you might expect a prima facie case for a causal link between tax preferences for homeownership and the bubble, but Palley&#8217;s lede is deeply buried and there turns out not to be a lot of there there.  The central issue is that there&#8217;s no obvious variation in tax policy that is associated with the bubble.  More after the jump.</p>
<p>Plenty of Sensible Economists have sniped at the mortgage interest deduction among other favorable tax treatments for homeownership.  Reforming, though not eliminating, the mortgage interest deduction also was a recommendation of the <a href="http://www.taxreformpanel.gov/">Tax Reform Panel</a> whose report was broadly ignored after its 2005 publication gave some of us in the econoblogiverse plenty of material (for anyone interested, my contemporary blogging on the subject is <a href="http://atbozzo.blogspot.com/2005/11/tax-reform-greatest-hits.html">linked here</a>).  Palley recites the traditional indictment: the tax policies are expensive (*), pay the middle- to upper-middle classes to do something they&#8217;d do anyway (**), are unfair to low-income taxpayers who don&#8217;t itemize or otherwise get a smaller deduction (***), and by increasing house prices work somewhat at cross purposes to the notional intent of making housing more affordable.  Fair enough.</p>
<p>Thing is, as far as the housing bubble is concerned, none of this is new.  The deduction was distorting the housing market well into pre-bubble history.  Indeed, the reductions in marginal tax rates affecting most middle- and upper-income taxpayers ought, in principle, to have reduced the distortion on the margin.  Here, for instance, is the CPI-adjusted OFHEO house price index against the marginal tax rate applicable to a family with a constant-dollar income somewhat north of mine (****):</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/21392874@N00/2473571200/" title="Marginal Tax Rates and House Prices by atbozzo, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2379/2473571200_40e747b6f4.jpg" alt="Marginal Tax Rates and House Prices" height="340" width="500"></a></p>
<p>Correlation is not causality, of course, but the simple correlation here is negative (-0.55).  Moreover, there isn&#8217;t any clear connection between the major changes in tax policy over the period and bubbly prices, unless someone can account for the rather variable lag structures.  The 1986 tax reform eliminated the deductibility of non-mortgage interest, which in particular made home-equity credit relatively attractive; in 1997, the capital-gains treatment for owner-occupied housing changed.  In both cases, at least using the CPI adjustment, prices had started recovering from their local troughs before enactment of the changes.</p>
<p>The &#8217;97 change — which replaced a tax deferral for homeownership capital gains rolled into another residence with a flat exemption of $250,000 for an individual (twice that for joint filers) — is tricky.  It does favor owner-occupied housing as an asset class by making something of a Roth IRA out of one&#8217;s house.  However, the benefits relative to previous law only assert themselves upon exit of the owner-occupied housing market, and the complete tax deferral of rolled-over equity may have been worth more in the short run to movers up or down in areas with high nominal appreciation.  Also, this was enacted against the backdrop of a right-of-center program to reduce taxation of capital income; I tend to the view that there&#8217;s not a lot of distortion between a zero capital gains tax rate and the low rates that currently prevail for other long-term gains.</p>
<p>So Palley is left with a rather tenuous assertion connecting the bubble and tax policy:<br />
<blockquote>The tax system has helped create a cult of home ownership, and that cult appears to have been an ingredient in the recent house price bubble.</p></blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t think the tax preferences exactly hurt the cult&#8217;s marketing, but let&#8217;s face facts: to explain the bubble, it&#8217;s necessary to find factors associated more-or-less with the bubble era, and from that perspective it should be amply clear that the irrational exuberance came roaring out of the financial world. The cult part was all the spinning of tales for why houses were just like stocks in the late-90s except for the crashing back to earth part, combined with the deployment of financial technologies which, while not necessarily dangerous per se (*****), certainly bore risks of unintended consequences that were broadly ignored.  So now we have a socialized financial system (at least on the downside), woohoo!</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I&#8217;m skeptical to say the very least regarding claims that we&#8217;d be living in a paradise of economic dynamism if only we were all unencumbered by our illiquid and inconvenient owned housing.  Long-term wage stagnation is a huge problem, but one that can&#8217;t fairly be placed at homeownership above other causes.</p>
<p>So Palley has some reasonably sensible reform plans that someone might phase in, but I&#8217;m not going to tell anyone that a bit of political capital ought to be spent on them that might otherwise be spent extracting us from <a href="http://icasualties.org/oif/">George and Dick&#8217;s Excellent Adventure</a> or breaking our addictions to oil and/or GHG emissions — both of which are far more difficult and urgent.</p>
<p>(*) $80 billion is a lot of money, but at ~3% of the federal budget, not the biggest boondoggle in annual expenditures.</p>
<p>(**) Distastefully inefficient to the extent it&#8217;s true.</p>
<p>(***) Also true in large part, though non-itemizers do have the standard deduction.</p>

<blockquote><p>Repeal the gas tax for the summer, and pay for the repeal by cutting domestic discretionary spending so that the transportation infrastructure trust fund would not be hurt.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ok – stop laughing at this one as <a href="http://www.amconmag.com/larison/2008/05/06/the-nine-ineffectual-habits-of-republican-pandering">Daniel Larison</a> has so much more:</p>
<blockquote><p>Newt Gingrich is back to haunt us again, this time offering up nine panderific ideas that reek of the desperation of a party with no ideas–and he’s supposed to be one of the idea men of this gang!  My favourite has to be this one:<br />Introduce a “more energy at lower cost with less environmental damage and greater national security bill” as a replacement for the Warner-Lieberman “tax and trade” bill…</p>
<p>This will also be known as the No Trade-Offs/Free Lunch Act of 2008.  Gingrich forgot to mention introducing the bill to protect endangered unicorns.  Gingrich supplements this with such proposals as, I kid you not, an earmark moratorium (take on those tough issues, Newt!), a gas tax holiday that will allegedly be paid for by “cutting domestic discretionary spending,” using the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to manipulate oil prices (very slightly), tackling all of the outrageous waste at the Census Bureau (?), and, naturally, banging the drum about the judiciary.</p></blockquote>

                                <p><a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/193377.php">David Kurtz</a> catches this remark from Senator Menendez:<br />
<blockquote>Thank God that we don&#8217;t have economists making necessarily public policy</p></blockquote>
<p>Wow – Menendez must love how the Bush White House makes public policy!  But then let’s check out his <a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/193519.php">clarification</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>the point I was making was that the everyday pains that average Americans are feeling aren&#8217;t always taken into account by an economist sitting behind a desk looking at numbers.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m sorry but this is a really stupid statement.  We at the blog like most economists do take into account the impact of higher prices on individual households.  Maybe some conservatives think we spend too much time on distributional effects but to say we just look at the aggregate numbers is one of the dumbest things I’ve heard in a long time.</p>
<p>Update: Courtesy of AB reader Brooks, the comments by <a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2008/05/in-praise-of-gas-tax-hysterics.html">Greg Mankiw</a> are a must read.  Greg is arguing that when <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/05/06/gas-tax-hysterics">Paul Krugman</a> says this gas tax holiday is small potatoes, the following must be also said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Paul is right that the issue is, quantitatively, small potatoes, but I am nonetheless pleased to see it get so much attention. This issue is like the canary in the coal mine: No one really cares about the canary, but its condition tells us about deeper problems that lie below.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/05/oderint-dum-met.html">Brad DeLong</a> agrees with Greg:</p>
<blockquote><p>it is important that presidential candidates fear economists even in the campaign. If they don&#8217;t fear their economists, then we get campaign promises of really lousy economic policy, some of which will then make it into post-election real policy, and then we are in trouble. Republican politicians have not feared their economists since&#8230; the Eisenhower administration, I think, and so Republican economic policy is overwhelmingly lousy. Democratic politicians have in the past and still today fear the bad headlines that are generated if their own economic advisers say that they are full of it. And so their campaign rhetoric is less out-to-lunch. And their post-election policies are better. For Paul to take steps to diminish Democratic politicians&#8217; fear of economists&#8230; Well, it&#8217;s contrary to guild rules. Just saying&#8230;</p></blockquote>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Well Reader Dan invited me to submit some posts on Social Security and so here I am. Depending on reader interest this is the first in a series trying to get us to a deeper understanding of what Social Security actually is and where it is likely heading. And that may be a much different place than most people currently think.</p>
<p>Social Security finance is a really odd beast, it has a strong up is down quality that tends to baffle people. For example I will be making the case in a later post that cutting Social Security benefits actually harms the long range financial stability of the system. Why this seeming paradox holds requires us to examine some mechanical peculiarities of a PayGo system given the details of the current state of its financing. But before diving into the deep end I want to establish a conceptual framework, that is to show you Social Security through my eyes.</p>
<p>First it all starts, and mostly stops, with the Trustees&#8217; Reports, more formally known as the &#8216;ANNUAL REPORT OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF THE FEDERAL OLD-AGE AND SURVIVORS INSURANCE AND FEDERAL DISABILITY INSURANCE TRUST FUNDS&#8217;. Almost every fact, factoid and date cited in this debate comes directly or indirectly from this Report. (Certainly CBO has a slightly different interpretation but they don&#8217;t really challenge the fundamental assumptions of the Trustees). For the most part in this game all of the players are playing out of the same playbook and more importantly out of a particular subset of that book. More on that point later. The first lesson people need to learn is that &#8216;It is already built into the model&#8217;. This is particularly important in relation to the demographics, because the first response from those hearing that Social Security is not particularly in crisis is: &#8216;What about the Boomer Retirement?&#8217; &#8216;More retirees, less workers, what don&#8217;t you get about that?&#8217; or &#8216;People are living longer!&#8221; Well I know all those things mainly because the demographers working in the Office of the Chief Actuary know them full well and have already accounted for them in their models. Which are published in the Report. Which I read.</p>
<p>Second point. Social Security really and truly is Insurance. Endless efforts have been made to blur this fact, and I expect/hope to see some in comments, but they all fail in the face of the actual operation of the system. Social Security collects premiums from all wage workers up to a determined wage level and disperses benefits to qualified beneficiaries. Which is pretty much the same as what New York Life does, cash flows in one door and out the other. That varying things happen with excess cash in between are not really the concern of the buyer and future beneficiary of the policy, as long as they get the promised benefits when the time comes then all&#8217;s fair. That is there is no functional distinction between drawing a benefit dollar from the existing investment pool as opposed to simply paying it out of current premiums, PayGo does not equate to Ponzi. Banks and Insurance Companies don&#8217;t have current cash reserves equivalent to all of their obligations, instead that money is locked up in what may be long term investments, instead they rely on current cash flow to carry the load. Of course banks are required to hold some cash reserves with the Federal Reserve and Insurance companies themselves carry reinsurance, you can&#8217;t get too close to the edge. And this is where Social Security Insurance departs from New York Life, instead of reinsurance it has Trust Funds.</p>
<p>Which gets us to the third point. Social Security is not the Trust Funds anymore than New York Life is its reinsurance policy. The Trust Funds are simply the numeric measure of how much Social Security has in long term reserves. This amount can over any given year or series of years trend up or down without directly effecting benefit payments. In an up year Income Excluding Interest exceeds Cost and so surpluses flow to the Trust Fund, in a down year Income Excluding Interest lags Cost and the Trust Fund has to be drawn down, but typically not by much, current income is always carrying much of the load and would even if the Trust Fund went to zero.</p>
<p>Last points for today. Trust Fund &#8216;crisis&#8217; is normally set at two possible points. One is crisis at Shortfall, that point where Current Income is projected to fall behind Cost for an extended period. This would require a sustained drawdown on the Trust Fund as more and more interest is diverted to pay current benefits. Whether this really equates to &#8216;crisis&#8217; requires an analysis of the actual dollars in context. That rarely happens, instead people jump right to &#8216;Raise taxes to unendurable levels! or Slash benefits to the bone! We got to act now!!&#8217; Well this hysteria whether real or fake (and much of it is fake) is simply that. Absent an examination of the numbers it is simply as Shakespeare put it &#8216;A tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing&#8217;, In this particular case if you can&#8217;t say it in numbers you really shouldn&#8217;t be saying it at all.</p>
<p>The second &#8216;crisis&#8217; point, and the more traditional one, is crisis at Depletion, that point where the Trust Fund has been drawn down to nothing. Once again the temptation is to jump to &#8220;Oh My God we&#8217;ll have to raise taxes&#8217; or worse &#8216;Its bankrupt!! Dead broke!!! Checks will stop!!&#8217; Well that too is mostly nonsense, by law we need do nothing at Trust Fund Depletion, instead benefits would simply be reduced to whatever level was supported by current income. Whether that adds up to &#8216;crisis&#8217; is once again a matter of comparing the numbers to the actual schedule of benefits while comparing it to benefit levels today. In the event the relevent equation from the 2008 Report is 78% of 160% = 120%. More on that later.</p>
<p>So lessons attempted here?<br />1. Numbers matter and they are to be found in the Reports. Including all the relevant demographic ones.<br />2. Social Security is in fact a Pay as you Go Insurance plan with a certain level of reserves. It is not a Ponzi scheme.<br />3. That reserve is called the Trust Fund, but is not itself the whole of Social Security any more than your bank account is the whole of your finances.<br />4. No one likes to draw down their reserves as we would at Shortfall, but you have to put that in context of your entire financial position. Which means looking at the numbers, see point 1<br />5. You plan for your retirement and ideally meet 100% or more of your goal. Hitting 78% may or may not be some sort of crisis, it might just mean buying a smaller boat. We need to examine Depletion in the context of both absolute level of benefit cuts and probability that the current projection will come to be.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be glad to answer questions and meet challenges in comments. In future posts I will be explaining some of the odd terminology used: Low Cost alternative, Trust Fund Ratio, Covered Worker Ratio etc. For those who just can&#8217;t stand to wait you might want to browse the Nov. 2004 archives of the Bruce Web (bruceweb.blogspot.com).</p>

Is the spending of the money in some place other than a small business like my flower shop, or a yard sale just making the rebate another channel for  money to move out of the government (us) and into the hands of the few leaving us to also pay the taxes&#8230;some day?</p>
<p>If anything, buying used or at a yard sale will reduce the consumption of more resources.  I mean, I love Craigslist.</p>
