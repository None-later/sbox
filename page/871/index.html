                                <p>Via my friend <a href="http://www.thecarpetbaggerreport.com/archives/10445.html">Steve Benen</a>, a story <a href="http://burlingtonfreepress.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070406/NEWS01/704060311/1009">on the demise of the Republican Party’s UVM chapter</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>When the club invited Gingrich to speak at Ira Allen Chapel on Oct. 6, 2005, he settled for an undisclosed honorarium that was apparently higher than the College Republicans could afford. They took out a $7,000 loan from the Student Government Association to help pay the bill, but more than a year later, when the loan still wasn&#8217;t fully repaid after several ultimatums, the Student Government Association decertified them.</p></blockquote>
<p>Three dots</p>
<blockquote><p>In 2005-06, the College Republicans budgeted $25,000 for speakers, according to Maggie Doran, who works in the Student Government Association&#8217;s front office. Gingrich, who rose to national prominence in Congress during the 1990s, was the only speaker the club brought in during that academic year. The UVM President&#8217;s Office contributed $2,000 toward Gingrich&#8217;s fee, as did the Student Life Office. The sum of all those funds, plus the $7,000 from the loan, comes to $38,000.</p></blockquote>
<p>Three dots</p>
<blockquote><p>Gingrich was asked Monday, via e-mail, if he realized that his appearance in Burlington had effectively led to the decommissioning of the UVM Republican club. A reply came from Joe DeSantis, communications director of Gingrich Communications: &#8220;We have no comment.&#8221; </p>
<p>Heather Baldyga, the most recent president of the Republican club, recalled that for the Gingrich event, the admission fee was $5 for students and more for those who occupied reserved seats toward the front. Those receipts brought in less than anticipated, she said, although the event, as described in a Burlington Free Press article, was well-attended.</p></blockquote>
<p>Three dots</p>
<blockquote><p>UVM has more than 130 &#8220;recognized&#8221; clubs. They receive money from the pooled student activity fees: $71 per semester for each of about 8,800 undergraduates this year amounts to about $1.2 million.</p>
<p>Baldyga said the Republicans had about 200 names on their online list serve.”</p></blockquote>
<p>OK.  Now the story in abbreviated form…  They decided they wanted to give money to a prominent believer in their philosophy.  What money?  Well, the bulk of it was money they got from pooled student activities fees – fees all students on campus pay.  (Isn’t this something members of the club would usually refer to as socialism?)  They thought they could cover the rest, but their plan to raise revenue was completely unrealistic and thus failed miserably.  And when faced with their failure, instead of making good (a $7,000 loan divided by 200 members comes to $35 a piece), they decided to simply walking away, leaving everyone else to hold the bag.  I think every one of these 200 members has a bright and shining future ahead of them with the big boys.  </p>

                                <p><a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2007/04/what_did_you_kn.html">Mark Thoma</a> summarizes the follow-up to Bruce Bartlett’s continued insistence that those of us who learned economics during the 1970’s understood only vulgar Keynesianism.  Bruce seems to think we believed only fiscal policy mattered, which of course is such absurd.  He also seems to think graduate students were not aware of either the Real Business Cycle theory of the new classical challenge to the Phillips curve.  It is true that Finn Kyland and Edward Prescott published their <a href="http://ideas.repec.org/a/ecm/emetrp/v50y1982i6p1345-70.html">Time to Build and Aggregate Fluctuations</a> in 1982, but the challenge from the new classical school as to whether aggregate demand policies could lead to anything other than a very transitional blip away from full employment had economists wondering if there was some other reason why real GDP deviated from some trend line for sustained periods of time.  </p>
<p>Then again – most of us recognized back then that fiscal stimulus with tight money would <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/04/i-trust-bruce-bartlett-understands.html">crowd-out</a> investment and/or net exports.  And there are a few of us who think <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/04/jfk-explains-his-tax-cut-but-did-greg.html">President Kennedy</a> got it right when he talked about the aggregate demand effects of fiscal policy.  </p>
<p><a href="http://divisionoflabour.com/archives/003686.php">Lawrence White</a> suggests that not every class in economics was at the same level of quality as those attended by graduate students at MIT.  On the other hand, <a href="http://timworstall.typepad.com/timworstall/2007/04/bruce_bartlett_.html">Tim Worstall</a> reminds us that economists have been talking about all sorts of means of increasing efficiency for many years:</p>
<blockquote><p>Supply side reform to me means just that, reform of the supply side. Nationalizing or privatizing the railroads is supply side reform, deregulating the airlines is supply side reform, adding or subtracting to farm subsidies is supply side reform, as was welfare reform (as Richard Layard went on about for years, it was to bring the long term unemployed back into the reserve army of the unemployed and thus influence or shift the Phillips Curve). To claim, whether in support or in opposition, that it&#8217;s all about marginal tax rates is to me to miss the entire point. There are parts of the economy, at times, which need to reform so as to free them (and equally,  in other places and times, restrain them, like the break up of AT&#038;T) and thus reform the supply side. That, to me at least, is the point about such supply side economics and to lose that insight in a squabble over marginal tax rates is a pity, at the very least.</p></blockquote>
<p>Thanks Tim for elevating the debate!</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://laglux.blogspot.com/2007/04/rbc-and-nk-models.html">Lawrence Lux</a> makes a couple of more contributions to this debate including this on real business cycles:</p>
<blockquote><p>My problem resides with the exact definition of Supply shocks. Both Bruce and Mark imply that while Supply shocks are natural, they should somehow be reduced by Public policy. Supply shocks are a natural condition, the result of process of business development; a process of investment followed by a recoupment of financial reserves (a Period of Marketing distribution to make initiated Production profitable). Artificial supplement of these financial reserves through favorable tax rates dissipates Business energy from optimum organization of Production and Marketing to maximize Profitability, and directs Business interest into new Production modes before the ‘bugs’ of the older Production have been worked out. You can definitely place me outside the Supply-Side spectrum.</p></blockquote>
<p>He is exactly right.  Every time I hear some politician saying we should give tax breaks to stimulate small business investment, my mind starts pondering the general equilibrium effects of how the implied increase in interest rates (yes, I’m doing Solow style classical economics here) will crowd-out investment for larger businesses.  Now if the marginal productivity of capital for small business is not greater than the marginal productivity for larger business, this kind of reallocation of capital strikes me as promoting inefficiency.</p>

                                <p>So the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration issued a <a href="http://www.treas.gov/tigta/auditreports/2007reports/200720048fr.pdf">report</a> entitled <em>The Internal Revenue Service Is Not Adequately Protecting Taxpayer Data on Laptop Computers and Other Portable Electronic Media Devices</em>.  For those of you who haven’t read it yet, I won’t the ruin the suspense by blurting out the ending, but I do note that on page 8, Figure 1 shows known incidences of theft and of IRS computers and/or loss of taxpayer data.</p>
<p>The Table below shows that data.  Apropos of nothing, it also shows the IRS Operating Budget as a share of the Total Federal Budget going back to 2001.  (Note… the first column is for calendar years, the second for fiscal year.)</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RhfJ9jbEVaI/AAAAAAAAALA/GkSK2WJtsSM/s1600-h/irs+thefts+and+losses.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RhfJ9jbEVaI/AAAAAAAAALA/GkSK2WJtsSM/s320/irs+thefts+and+losses.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Its not much data.  Still, when you’re cutting costs at a department you despise, I wonder where you cut them first.  And I wonder why anyone would be surprised that things go horribly wrong (real tax collections fall, thefts and losses increases, etc.).  Lest you think this harms the American public, consider that the money is being better spent elsewhere.  On the plus side, we got Saddam so he&#8217;ll never plan, finance, or execute another September 11&#8230;. oh, wait.</p>

                                <p>Thanks to <a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2007/04/case-for-tax-cuts.html">Greg Mankiw</a> for <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEdXrfIMdiU">this</a>.  President Kennedy explains quite eloquently his reasoning in 1962 for a tax cut – good old Keynesian stimulus to get the economy back to full employment.  Which makes the fact that Greg has fallen for this <a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2007/04/we-are-all-supply-siders-now.html">free lunch supply-side</a> spin so puzzling!</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://www.clubforgrowth.org/2007/04/brilliant_video_on_jfks_tax_cu.php">Andrew Roth</a> provides the transcript:</p>
<blockquote><p>The worst deficit comes from a recession, and if we can take the proper action in the proper time, this can be the most important step we could take to prevent another recession. That is the right kind of a tax cut both for your family budget and the national budget resulting from a permanent basic reform and reduction in our rate structure, a creative tax cut creating more jobs and income and eventually more revenue. And the right time for that kind of bill, it now appears in the absence of an economic crisis today-and if the job is to be done in a responsible way&#8211;is January 1963. Such a bill will be presented to the Congress for action next year. It will include an across the board, top to bottom cut in both corporate and personal income taxes. It will include long-needed tax reform that logic and equity demand. And it will date that cut in taxes to take effect as of the start of next year, January 1963. The billions of dollars this bill will place in the hands of the consumer and our businessmen will have both immediate and permanent benefits to our economy. Every dollar released from taxation that is spent or invested will help create a new job and a new salary. And these new jobs and new salaries can create other jobs and other salaries and more customers and more growth for an expanding American economy. Instead of being permanently saddled with excess plant capacity and the budgetary deficit that is created by this means, our goal must be fuller capacity and full employment and the budgetary surpluses that that kind of employment and capacity can produce.</p></blockquote>
<p>As soon as the supply-side silly crowd read the word “recession” – maybe they should have paused and actually think about what President Kennedy was saying.  The President was clearly talking about aggregate demand events with a reference to the Keynesian multiplier.  At the time this speech was delivered, the unemployment rate was 5.5%.  In his post just before putting up this YouTube video, Andrew Roth noted that the unemployment rate for March 2007 was 4.4%.  These Bush cheerleaders want to argue that we are near full employment now, but they also want to claim that JFK would be making the case of a tax cut today.  I have to wonder if Andrew Roth was able to either read or listen to what JFK was saying.  Or is this crowd really this incredibly stupid as to the distinctions that <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2007/04/bruce_bartlett_.html">Mark Thoma</a> made.  President Kennedy understood the difference but the Le Club for Rich People apparently do not.</p>

<blockquote><p>TOWN OF ASHFORD — A long-time treasurer for the Town of Ashford was re-elected Tuesday despite the fact that he died March 20.</p>
<p>Don Grossen of Campbellsport — who served as town treasurer for 36 years — received 109 votes in the treasurer’s race. There were 12 votes cast for write-ins.</p>
<p>Grossen had a medical problem and his car traveled off Highway 41 near Highway 151 on March 20. He died at St. Agnes Hospital.</p>
<p>Town Clerk Tracy Flasch, who is assuming Grossen’s duties until a replacement is named, said the board has not decided how it will fill Grossen’s position.</p>
<p>“The chairman (Joe Koch) has said he’ll look at the election results and see what names were written in,” Flasch said. “Then we’ll do interviews with interested candidates. A few people have expressed an interest in the position.” </p></blockquote>
<p>Given that Ashcroft caused GW fewer problems than Gonzalez, look for whoever came in second in this race to be the new AG.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/06/opinion/06bartlett.html?_r=1&#038;oref=slogin">Bruce Bartlett</a> and <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2007/04/bruce_bartlett_.html">Mark Thoma</a> are having a debate over what New Keynesians and sensible supply-siders have to offer.  See the comments at Mark’s place as Paul Krugman has engaged in this debate.  While Mark does an excellent job, I have to add something about one of my pet peeves as Bruce writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Based on insights derived from the Nobel-winning economists Robert Mundell, Milton Friedman, James Buchanan and Friedrich Hayek, the supply-siders developed a new program based on tight money to stop inflation and cuts in marginal tax rates to stimulate growth.</p></blockquote>
<p>The usual argument about stimulating growth in the long-run runs along the Solow argument that increasing national savings promotes faster growth.  Granted certain changes in how we raise taxes might induce more savings, but the usual Reagan-Bush43 line is that we can lower taxes for everyone – which translates to more consumption.  And given the fact that neither President Reagan nor President George W. Bush ever figured out how to cut government purchases, the U.S. witnessed declines in the national savings rate following the 1981 and the 2001 tax cuts.</p>
<p>But since Bruce mentioned Robert Mundell, let’s go back to the 1980’s when the fiscal stimulus crowded out both investment and net exports.  The fall in net exports were due to a massive appreciation of the dollar, which had a temporary inflation benefit.  Our current account deficit was eventually reduced during the late 1980’s as the dollar devalued.  Now the inflation rate did not accelerate as the dollar devalued – but wasn’t that more due to the fact that it took a long for the economy to return to full employment.  </p>
<p>Bruce’s contention that a mix of tight money and easy fiscal policy is good for long-term growth is relevant today as the Federal Reserve increased interest rates as the economy got closer to full employment.  But this strikes me as absurd as it appears to be saying lower national savings and higher interest rates somehow encourages growth.  Bruce should go revisit the Solow growth model if he believes this.</p>

Conda is former assistant for domestic policy under Vice President Cheney and a longtime policy wonk around Washington, D.C.</p></blockquote>
<p>Conda’s idea of promoting growth is to reduce the corporate income tax rate, to increase contribution limits to IRAs and to allow for faster accounting depreciation of assets.  The hope is to increase savings according to Conda.  Of course, George W. Bush promoted these tax cuts ideas as a way of giving people their “money back” so they could consume more.  One day – one of these free lunchers is going to realize that consuming more means saving less.</p>

                                <p>Some good news from the <a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Nonfarm payroll employment rose by 180,000 in March, and the unemployment rate was essentially unchanged at 4.4 percent, the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the U.S. Department of Labor reported today.</p></blockquote>
<p>The decline in the unemployment rate – this time – came from a rise in the employment to population ratio from 63.2% to 63.3% as the civilian labor force participation rate held steady at 66.2%.  It seems the increase in employment per the household survey was 335,000.  Good news at least for most sectors.</p>

                                <p>Regular reader Susan Webber writes a <a href="http://www.conference-board.org/cgi-bin/MsmGo.exe?grab_id=78&#038;EXTRA_ARG=&#038;SCOPE=Public&#038;host_id=42&#038;page_id=4397568&#038;query=halo&#038;hiword=halo+">review</a> of <em>The Halo Effect. . . and the Eight Other Business Delusions That Deceive Managers</em> by Phil Rosenzweig in the Conference Board Review.</p>
<p>An exerpt:</p>
<blockquote><p>Rosenzweig tells us that our beliefs about business success are largely, perhaps entirely, wrong, distorted by the halo effect &#8212; in this case, the idea that once we consider a company successful, we tend to see it as doing everything right. Business gurus, he charges, chart a flat, comfortable world in which a handful of top firms are to be emulated, no questions asked.</p>
<p>Among the follow-the-leaders classics that the author condemns as fatally flawed: Tom Peters and Robert Waterman&#8217;s <em>In Search of Excellence</em>, John Kotter and James Heskett&#8217;s <em>Corporate Culture and Performance</em>, Bruce Robertson&#8217;s <em>What Really Works</em>, and Jim Collins&#8217; and <em>Good to Great</em>. Their glib assurances about the path to corporate success are satisfying, but the stories are not necessarily helpful or accurate. We have no way of knowing whether to believe their analyses of why their case-study champions achieved success: Rather than factual, objective metrics, the gurus rely on anecdotes, retrospective impressions, and press reports.</p>
<p>That irresponsible but supremely confident analysis &#8212; boiled down to a magic three (or is it eight? or fifteen?) secrets to making your company a winner &#8212; is what all too many people are looking for. By contrast, Rosenzweig leaves readers with little solace: The world is full of uncertainty, and the wise understand the limits of their knowledge.</p></blockquote>
<p>three dots</p>
<blockquote><p>Rosenzweig focuses on what he feels is the fundamental question in business: What leads to high performance? And he finds a disturbing pattern. Most research on both individuals and organizations has been hopelessly tainted by the halo effect.</p></blockquote>
<p>As a consultant myself, and having spent some time in middle management in a Fortune 500 company, I&#8217;ve long had the impression that companies don&#8217;t know what they&#8217;re doing, even if they&#8217;re succeeding.  When a company succeeds or fails, often nobody knows why.  And nobody wants to measure anything.</p>
<p>I remember once, in my corporate life, running some numbers and pointing out that while Marketing was the most powerful organization in the company, its activities didn&#8217;t contribute to revenues at all, and thus, marketing only contributed to profits by adding (a lot) to costs.  This should not have been a surprise to anyone  &#8211; as a phone company, we were a regulated monopoly.  If you wanted phone service, and you lived in our area, you came to us.  You didn&#8217;t have a choice between us and the bakery a few blocks down.  </p>
<p>Which led to a second lesson for me.  Pointing out something like that, especially when you can back it up, gets you in a heap of trouble.  I&#8217;ve seen this kind of thing time many times since.  Nobody realizes they&#8217;re wasting resources, and when its pointed out, vested interests prevent anyone from acting on it.</p>

                                <p>Hard to know what to make of this article in ASHI Weekly <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/">Asia-Foreign Firms Feel the Heat from Chinese Backlash</a>. Local Chinese governments are “now finding ways to ‘bash’ foreign firms for doing business in China. Famous brand names in particular, such as Louis Vuitton, Burberry and Starbucks, are finding themselves the target of this sudden backlash.”</p>
<p>Foreign imported shoes are considered too expensive and not up to snuff. The Chinese burned the shoes.  But shoes the Chinese exported to Spain were met with a similar fate: Burned as cheap imports.</p>
<blockquote><p>In 2006, Zhejiang provincial authorities said notebook computers manufactured by four foreign companies, including Toshiba Corp. and Hewlett-Packard, had failed to meet quality standards to deal with lightning and other problems, and ordered a suspension of their sale in the province.</p></blockquote>
<p>Apparently, the trade “fricition” has more sides than we thought.</p>
<blockquote><p>The industry and commerce bureau of the Shanghai city government ordered a number of stores to pull 25 kinds of apparel of foreign brands, including Chanel, Burberry and Armani, from their shelves in January, citing poor quality. Most of the clothing was imported, with some items priced as high as 60,000 yuan (930,000 yen).</p>
<p>The Shanghai government, some say, acted in order to &#8220;bash&#8221; wealthy Chinese who can afford to buy such luxury goods.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Shanghai government is criticizing people for their desire for foreign brands, and is urging them to place importance on a reasonable and simple lifestyle,&#8221; wrote the French newspaper Le Figaro.</p></blockquote>
<p>I am not sure where all this is going, but it might be interesting.</p>
