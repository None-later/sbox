                                <p>One of the current Republican talking point is that a major reason that firms are not hiring is regulatory uncertainty.</p>
<p>Of course there is little or no evidence to support this argument and virtually every poll of business and especially small business shows that fear of regulation is a very minor factor in current business decisions. The dominant factor in poll after poll is inadequate demand.</p>
<p>ON 11 June 2004 Milton Friedman published an interesting article in the Wall Street Journal Editorial Page called &#8220;Freedom&#8217;s Friend&#8221; [reprint available <a href="http://www.hoover.org/publications/hoover-digest/article/7293">here</a>], where he proposed that the number of pages in the Federal Register could be used as a measure of government&#8217;s interference in people lives and a measure of freedom.<br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve looked at this measure before, <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2008/08/president-bush-and-federal-registery.html">back in 2008</a>. Given this new Republican talking point it seems a good time to revisit it, so I&#8217;ve updated the data to include the first two years of the Obama administration. The chart compares the average number of pages published in the Federal Register each year. This measure allows you to compare the number of pages in four-year and eight-year administrations, as well as the number in the first two years of the Obama administration. If you tried to chart the total number of pages published over an administration, you could not make this type of comparison very well.</p>
<p>Milton Friedman wanted to use this approach to demonstrate that Reagan interfered in people freedom less than other presidents. He clearly made that point, and if you update the chart it shows that Bush II set the all time record for the number of pages in the Federal Register. Of course, the Republicans would deny that the record level of interference in people&#8217;s freedom by President Bush caused business to limit hiring.</p>
<p>But in the first two years of the Obama administration the number of pages in the Federal Register averaged 75,875 as compared to and average of 75,894 under Bush. So far Obama appears to have published -0.02% fewer regulations than Bush. Of course, he still has time to move ahead of Bush. But as of yet this measure implies that there is actually less regulatory uncertainty under Obama than there was under Bush when the Republicans obviously made no claims about regulatory uncertainty restraining employment.</p>

<p>I wonder if anyone in the press would pick up this point and actually question some Republican when they make this talking point.</p>
<p>I clearly miss [the late] Mark Haines of CNBC, who would regularly call politicians or other fools on such talking points. This would clearly give someone else at CNBC the chance to pick up where Mark Haines left off.</p>
<p>At least, I hope some other popular bloggers will spread this analysis.</p>

<p>Dan Becker:</p>
<blockquote><p>Mike Panzer at Financial Armageddon has been on the issue that the &#8220;street&#8221; is missing all that is going on around them. From his blog: http://panzner.typepad.com/</p>
<p>However, I wonder if a new paper, <a href="https://www2.blackrock.com/webcore/litService/search/getDocument.seam?venue=PUB_IND&#038;source=GLOBAL&#038;contentId=1111147677" target="_blank">From Keeping Up with the Joneses to Keeping Above Water: The Status of the US Consumer</a> from the BlackRock Investment Institute,</p>
<p>If long-term leverage sustainability is assumed to reside near 1990 levels, then the bulk of the deleveraging process remains ahead of the American consumer, regardless of the income measure used&#8230;</p>
<p>We think that these trends, coupled with stubbornly high unemployment, higher commodities prices, and slower growth in wages and salaries, will likely contribute to a lower level of personal consumption growth over the next few years. Moreover, since consumer spending is a key component of the GDP growth rate, this would argue for generalized economic growth levels that are, at best, modest for years to come, and may in fact appear anemic when compared to pre-crisis growth rates.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>I have believed for years that the US is following the Japanese model.</p>
<p>But note that while the general belief is that the Japanese government policy has not stimulated the economy, the alternative might very well (be the) belief that Japanese policy may be preventing a depression.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>I still think Obama is toast—a result of his own making, since he’s really the apotheosis of a government-hating Republican who never tries to do anything because he’s afraid it would succeed.  He’s basically Jon Huntsman, <a href="http://lancemannion.typepad.com/lance_mannion/2011/09/just-another-right-wing-corporatist-republican-elitist.html" target="_blank">economic policy and all</a>, with a slightly better social policy—or at least a willingness not to try to compete globally in the 21st century using employment policies that were outdated in the 19th. (Short version: you might be able, in general, to exclude 55% of your potential workforce—women and gay men—if you have the population of an India or a China. You can’t do it when you have 1/3 or less of their population; you need a market that is open to everyone, which means you need social policies to match.)
<p>But there are way in which he is a Bad Republican (traditional definition—think Gerald Ford’s Presidency), and those, as much as anything else,are what has destroyed his re-election chances.  Not to mention U.S. employment data.</p>
<p>I’d like to think I’m wrong, but let’s look at the data, comparing the last three recessions: the ones with so-called “jobless recoveries.”  In <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/09/07/mitt-romney-recession-recovery-chart_n_952872.html">the grand tradition of Mitt Romney</a>, let’s look at job growth over the following 24 months.*  First, the Private Sector:</p>
<p><a href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/-JgEAhR6Vh30/TmlKp-2zN9I/AAAAAAAAAiE/QtIwQnxIF2I/s1600-h/joblessrecoveries001Private%25255B3%25255D.png"><img title="joblessrecoveries001Private" border="0" alt="joblessrecoveries001Private" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/-VBK4S3hmFuc/TmlKqXxSoQI/AAAAAAAAAiI/Eef2vfTWcns/joblessrecoveries001Private_thumb%25255B1%25255D.png?imgmax=800" width="644" height="433"></a> </p>
<p>The first thing we notice is that The George W. Bush-Mankiw-Hubbard “Recovery” Really Massively Sucked for U.S. Private Sector Employment.** Two-thirds of those post-recession months were negative, and the negatives were more than 1/3 again worse than the gains.  Even the 24 months that follow the 1980 recession—<strong><em>half of which were the first 3/4 of the 1982 recession</em></strong>—show a net positive gain in Private Sector Employment.</p>
<p>But the second thing is that the Obama Administration really isn’t doing that poorly in Private Sector Employment. It’s rather similar to the George H. W. Bush Administration.***  The loss months are slightly more severe than the gain months (about 5%), but there are 2 gain-months for every loss-month.  It’s still a “jobless recovery”—as was the post-1991 era—in that producing slightly over 1,000,000 jobs in a 24 month period is falling behind the growth in available workers, but it’s not a disaster, <em>if the criterion is the recovery of private-sector hiring.</em></p>
<p>Sadly for BarryO—again, I consider this what the tennis-playing Brad DeLong calls an “unforced error,” a direct result of the errors of his priors—there is also employment in the non-private sector.  Which both Bushes knew that, the “small government Democrat” appears not to:</p>
<p><a href="http://lh6.ggpht.com/-TivClZGPVXk/TmlKqq9WxPI/AAAAAAAAAiM/ub16NriE2cg/s1600-h/joblessrecoveries002Public%25255B7%25255D.png"><img title="joblessrecoveries002Public" border="0" alt="joblessrecoveries002Public" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/-v6lJHxC-QEE/TmlKq7ZbigI/AAAAAAAAAiQ/SBSTCcdvL0k/joblessrecoveries002Public_thumb%25255B3%25255D.png?imgmax=800" width="644" height="388"></a> </p>
<p>On a proportionate basis, George H. W. Bush oversaw as large a post-recession <em>expansion</em> of Government workers as Barack H. Obama has overseen a <em>reduction</em> in those workers.  This is even before one considers that at least three of those <strong>six</strong> positive months—a figured dwarfed by W’s 15 months of public-sector worker increase, let alone his father’s 19 months—are due to <em>temporary </em>hiring of U.S. Census workers. March, April, and May of 2010 show net gains because of Federal hiring that is more than completely reversed by September.  Great “Recovery Summer,” that was!</p>
<p>But if we really want to be fair to Barack Obama, we would have to break this down further.  After all,while the data is national, the breakdowns are not always so:</p>
<p><a href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/-ixsFB81KutI/TmlKrJ1dXyI/AAAAAAAAAiU/ktKic7popBQ/s1600-h/joblessrecoveries003PublicBreakdown%25255B11%25255D.png"><img title="joblessrecoveries003PublicBreakdown" border="0" alt="joblessrecoveries003PublicBreakdown" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/-KsZOycEENCc/TmlKrnQy11I/AAAAAAAAAiY/CC_ht95AvIg/joblessrecoveries003PublicBreakdown_thumb%25255B5%25255D.png?imgmax=800" width="644" height="459"></a> </p>
<p>Federal government employment—now including the ever-expanding Department of Homeland Security, and with a military that continues to fight (at least) three wars—has been essentially flat during the “recovery”period.  The damage has been done extensively at the State and, especially, Local levels.</p>
<p>Part of this is simply that the 2007-2009 recession was longer and deeper than the other two (18 months long v. 8 for each of the previous two; more than 7.5 million private-sector jobs compared to just over 1 million in 1991 and just under 2 million in 2001).  That’s a lot more time and a lot less money flowing into taxes and budget-balancing requirements.</p>
<p>But if I were Barack H. Obama, and if I really wanted to be re-elected, the speech I would be giving tonight wouldn’t be about extending tax credits or capital amortization credits—with or without the idiocy of budgetary offsets—but direct state aid. Billions of dollars of it.  Without offsets. The speech would run something like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>The latest few years have been difficult for you.  Almost every state in the Union has to balance their budgets, and with record levels of unemployment and job losses, that’s not easy to do.  So they made decisions that affected you, your children, and your friends. They laid off police officers, firefighters, teachers, librarians, surveyors, road repair personnel, and trash collectors. They’ve cut back hours at the DMV, Social Security, and Employment Offices.  They’ve made it more difficult to get an appointment to get health insurance for your children, support to buy healthy food for you and your children.  Your classrooms are more crowded, your property taxes are higher, and you’re getting less for your money while you have to put in more effort.</p>
<p>The Federal Government doesn’t have to balance its budget, and the bond market has given us a rare opportunity to borrow money for less than it will cost us.  I plan to take full advantage of that now, so that your children will have food, your streets will be safer, your opportunities for education will be greater, and the services for which you pay will be more available.</p>
<p>The private sector is rebuilding and restaffing, but that will—as it has in the past, as it almost always does—take time.  But they cannot rebuild if there is no demand, and you cannot demand things if you cannot pay for them. So, along with $1T in infrastructure improvements to be made over the next 15 years, I will tomorrow send a bill to Congress to triple the total of the two previous grants-in-aid to the States that were made as part of the ARRA.</p>
<p>Now you have heard many people—and to my shame, I am one of them—who live in fear of deficits. They pretend that the government “has to be like a family”—a family that never takes out a mortgage, never borrows to buy a car, never needs a loan to pay for schooling or training, and never uses a credit card.  I’ve seen families like that. They live on the streets of Honolulu and New York City and Chicago and Washington, D.C., and Richmond, Virginia, and Cincinnati, Ohio, and Detroit, Michigan, and Paint Creek, Texas.  They’re impoverished.</p>
<p>The United States is not impoverished, and I will not allow it to become so. We will rebuild opportunity now and build our superhighways—information and otherwise—for life in the 21st and 22nd Centuries.  The bankers—grateful for the bailouts that have been heaped upon them by my predecessor and myself—are willing to loan us money for less than the cost of inflation. We would be foolish not to borrow.  Even as those of you who can are refinancing your houses, the U.S. government will—<em>as families do and should</em>—borrow now to make a better life for our children and their children.</p>
<p>We have a unique opportunity. We have massive unemployment because the states do not have the money to employ and hire workers—workers who help keep our streets and homes safe, who keep our roads in good condition, who educate our children, who find us opportunities for work and ways to keep us healthy so that we can do that work.  And the bankers are telling us, “We will give you that money for free!”  And some people are telling you that we should not take that money.</p>
<p>We have given the bankers enough.  Now, they are willing to Pay It Forward, to give some small portion of that money back to us for less than it will cost them to do it. I intend to take that money and use it to make a better present—and the chance for a better future—for the American family.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/standard_and_poors/index.html?inline=nyt-org">Standard &#038; Poor’s</a> downgrade of United States government debt last month has been much debated, but not enough attention has been devoted to the fact, <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-08-31/subprime-mortgage-bonds-getting-aaa-rating-s-p-denies-to-u-s-treasuries.html">reported last week</a> by Bloomberg News, that it continues to rate securities based on subprime mortgages as AAA.</p>
<p>In short, S.&#038;P. is suggesting that these mortgages are more creditworthy than the United States government — a striking proposition. Leave aside for a moment that S.&#038;P. made a big mistake in its analysis of the <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/f/federal_budget_us/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier">federal budget</a> (as <a href="http://baselinescenario.com/2011/08/16/how-big-is-the-deficit-anyway/">explained</a> by James Kwak in our blog). Just focus on all the things that can go wrong with subprime mortgages: housing prices can fall, people can lose jobs, the economy may fall into <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/r/recession_and_depression/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier">recession</a> and so on.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>With all of the problems I have been having with my internet connection I may have missed it,  but the revisions to second quarter productivity did not seem to have been covered very well.</p>
<p>But nonfarm productivity growth is slowing sharply.  It was actually negative in the first and second quarter &#8212;0.6% and -0.7% in the first and second quarters, respectively &#8212; and the year over year change is now only 0.7%</p>
<p>Moreover, productivity lagged two quarters is a great leading-concurrent indicator of real GDP growth.  Productivity  growth now implies that the second half will be weak.  This is in sharp contrast to the still consensus expectations of a stronger second half.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-bXQYxJcxJHk/Tmi7dUxvV_I/AAAAAAAABt8/CCjwkLSjG8o/s1600/Clipboard01.bmp"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-bXQYxJcxJHk/Tmi7dUxvV_I/AAAAAAAABt8/CCjwkLSjG8o/s320/Clipboard01.bmp" alt="" border="0"></a><br />With weak productivity growth, unit labor costs is moving up sharply.  Moreover, the increase is due almost exclusively to the weak productivity, not rising compensation.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/--U_qKGog4_Y/Tmi7qI-1VAI/AAAAAAAABuE/L0gKOg_Plr0/s1600/Clipboard03.bmp"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/--U_qKGog4_Y/Tmi7qI-1VAI/AAAAAAAABuE/L0gKOg_Plr0/s320/Clipboard03.bmp" alt="" border="0"></a><br />Unit labor cost is now rising more faster than the nonfarm deflator.  The spread between unit labor cost growth and price growth is a primary determinate of profits growth and it is saying<br />that profits expectations are still too high&#8211; Standards and Poors,  for example, is still carrying<br />a bottoms  up forecast of some 20% EPS growth for 2011.   The recent stock market volatility<br />&#8212; it&#8217;s interesting that stock market is only volatile when it is declining, not rising &#8212; appears to stem largely from investors  revising their earnings expectation down.   Moreover, the productivity data implies that this downward revision is not over.</p>

<p>Senator Patty Murray: (202) 224-2621   <br />Representative Jeb Hensarling: (202) 225-3484</p>
<blockquote><p>Sample Script:</p>
<p>Hello, my name is ________ and I am calling to ask that [SENATOR MURRAY / REP. HENSARLING] work to ensure the public will continue to have access to the Super Congress&#8217; meetings.</p>
<p>I was pleased to hear that the first two meetings of the Super Congress would be broadcast live, but am concerned about what will happen when actual negotiations begin. It is very important that, as co-chair of the Super Congress, [SENATOR MURRAY / REP. HENSARLING] do everything in her/his power to provide public access to these hearings.</p>
<p>CSPAN broadcasts committee hearings all the time, and it would not be difficult to make these deliberations public as well. I urge [SENATOR MURRAY / REP. HENSARLING] to keep the Super Congress open to the public.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time.</p>

<p><strong>The Effect of Individual Income Tax Rates on the Economy, Part 5: 1968 &#8211; 1988</strong><br />This post is the fourth in a series that looks at the relationship between real economic growth and the top individual marginal tax rate.  The first looked at the period from 1901 to 1928, the second from 1929 to 1940, the third from 1940 to 1950, and the fifth looked at 1950 &#8211; 1968.</p>
<p>Before I begin, a quick recap&#8230;  both the <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/08/effect-of-individual-income-tax-rates.html">1901 &#8211; 1928 period</a> and the <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/08/effect-of-individual-income-tax-rates_22.html">1929 &#8211; 1940</a> failed to show the textbook relationship between taxes and growth.  In fact, it seems that for both those periods, there was at least a bit of support for the notion that growth was faster in periods of rising tax rates than in periods when tax rates were coming down.  In the <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/08/effect-of-individual-income-tax-rates_29.html">1940 &#8211; 1950</a> period, we did observe slower economic growth following a tax hike and faster economic growth followed a tax reduction.  However, that happened when the top marginal tax rate was boosted above 90%.  Interestingly enough, though the so-called &#8220;Kennedy Tax Cuts&#8221; are often used as one of the prime exhibits on the benefits of cutting taxes, a look at the <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/09/effect-of-individual-income-tax-rates.html">1950 &#8211; 1968</a> period yields no such conclusion.  Growth rates were already rising before the tax cuts occurred in 1964 and 1965, reached a peak when the tax cuts took place, and started shrinking immediately afterwards. </p>
<p>Real GDP figures used in this post come from <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/xls/gdplev.xls">Bureau of Economic Analysis.</a>  Top individual marginal tax rate figures used in this post come from the <a href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/histab23.xls">IRS</a>.  As in previous posts, I’m using growth rate from one year to the next (e.g., the 1980 figure shows growth from 1980 to 1981) to avoid “what leads what” questions. If there is a causal relationship between the tax rate and the growth rate, the growth rate from 1980 to 1981 cannot be causing the 1980 tax rate.  Let me stress this point again as I&#8217;ve been getting people e-mailing me to tell me I&#8217;ve got the growth rates shifted a year.  That is correct, and is being done on purpose (and is shown on the graph labels).  To avoid questions of causality, the growth rate in year X used in this post is the growth rate from year X to year X+1.  And when I say &#8220;to avoid questions of causality&#8221; &#8211; you&#8217;d be amazed at how many people write me when I don&#8217;t do this and insist that sure, higher tax rates seem to be correlated with faster growth, but that&#8217;s because when growth is faster governments feel more willing to charge higher tax rates.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s get started below the fold:<br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s put up a diagram showing growth rates and tax rates for the period from 1968 to 1988.  But we almost don&#8217;t have to do it. We all know what happened.  We&#8217;ve been told so many times.  Tax rates were very high in the late 60s and 70s.  And then came <strikethrough>the Lone Ranger</strikethrough> Reagan, and, and lo, Reagan cut taxes.  The result is that the economy began to grow like never before.  Sure, the story is strikingly similar to the one about the tax cuts in the 1960s, and we know from the last post how that turned out.  But still, the Reagan story is even more widely accepted, so here&#8217;s the graph that accompanies the story:</p>
<div><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-B_fasxOfbAc/TmgQ48iMK8I/AAAAAAAAAsw/X7jXyVFVtFc/s1600/partfive1.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="198" width="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-B_fasxOfbAc/TmgQ48iMK8I/AAAAAAAAAsw/X7jXyVFVtFc/s320/partfive1.jpg"></a></div>
<p>Figure 1.</p>
<p>Wait.  That can&#8217;t be right.  Something is wrong with the data because it doesn&#8217;t match the narrative!!!  Yes, there was a tax cut and the economy started growing.  But the only growth that was unusually strong for the time period occurred in one single year, from 1983 to 1984.  And immediately afterwards it dropped and kept dropping.  </p>
<p>In 1987, there was a small pickup in growth which accompanied a further tax cut (50% to 38.5%), but the year after, when the top marginal tax rate dropped further (to 28%), growth fell again. </p>
<p>Strip away the rhetoric, and it would seem the &#8220;evidence&#8221; for the benefits of Reaganomics, for the most part, are that following the small tax cut in 1981 (70% to 69.25%) and the bigger one in 1982 (69.25% to 50%), there was one seemingly extraordinary year of growth from 1983 to 1984.   I could swear the narrative usually isn&#8217;t stated in this way.    </p>
<p>But let&#8217;s take a close-up of the Reagan years and put them (and the one extraordinary year) in perspective.  In the next graph we have the 1980 -1988, but for comparison, I&#8217;ve included the growth rate from 1938 to 1939.  That happens to be the third slowest year of the pre-WW2 New Deal era.  Here&#8217;s what it looks like:</p>
<div><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-PG8gOI6EnLo/TmgRWfL_kfI/AAAAAAAAAs4/npXDBW1GAUs/s1600/partfive2.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="198" width="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-PG8gOI6EnLo/TmgRWfL_kfI/AAAAAAAAAs4/npXDBW1GAUs/s320/partfive2.jpg"></a></div>
<p>Figure 2</p>
<p>Now, you may be able to noodle out why I picked the third slowest year of FDR&#8217;s first 8 years from the graph &#8211; see, it turns out that Reagan&#8217;s best year was faster than FDR&#8217;s worst, and FDR&#8217;s second worst pre-WW2 years, but that&#8217;s about it.</p>
<p>Redoing Figure 2 and adding in FDR&#8217;s best pre-WW2 New Deal year:  1940 to 1941, produces this graph:</p>
<div><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-gm2TX1GQY7U/TmgRho3OV7I/AAAAAAAAAtA/jPQ9NhAdB9Y/s1600/partfive3.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="198" width="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-gm2TX1GQY7U/TmgRho3OV7I/AAAAAAAAAtA/jPQ9NhAdB9Y/s320/partfive3.jpg"></a></div>
<p>Figure 3.</p>
<p>Doesn&#8217;t look at all like what you learn in school, eh?  How about what you hear on Fox?  Or from El Rushbo?  What about from Rick Perry?  Heck, you don&#8217;t even hear about this from liberals.  </p>
<p>What you will hear is denial, and on the rare occasions where someone is willing to accept the data, excuses.   Now, I&#8217;m sympathetic to the idea that FDR and Reagan were Presidents at very different times, that perhaps FDR had higher potential growth due to a bounceback effect  (I don&#8217;t buy it, but I&#8217;m sympathetic to the idea).  I also don&#8217;t find it offensive if someone states that times and laws were different, and even if Reagan had FDR&#8217;s approach to government in mind, he could never have enacted the same policies that FDR applied.  What I am not sympathetic to are people who tell us about how well Reagan&#8217;s policies worked and who also insist that FDR ruined the economy or made it worse.  People who make such claims  can only fall into two categories, the &#8220;good&#8221; one being the misinformed.  </p>
<p>So to sum up&#8230; so far in this series&#8230;  it seems the evidence has been at least weakly against the idea that tax cuts lead to faster economic growth in the 1901 &#8211; 1928, 1929 &#8211; 1940, and 1950 &#8211; 1968 periods.  The 1940 &#8211; 1950 period does seem to behave consistently with that notion, though it is worth noting that it happened when tax rates were above 90%.  The period from 1950 &#8211; 1968, despite the frequent obfuscatory comments from certain sectors, also completely fails to support the notion that lower tax rates are followed by faster economic growth.  And frankly, the 1970s and 1980s don&#8217;t help the cause either.</p>
<p>Because the Reagan years play such an important role in the way we do economic policy in this country, we&#8217;ll revisit them in the next post in the series.  </p>

<p></p>
<blockquote><p>30/08/2011 &#8211; Due to the recent financial and economic crisis, global corporate losses have increased significantly. Numbers at stake are vast, with loss carry-forwards as high as 25% of GDP in some countries. Though most of these claims are justified, some corporations find loop-holes and use ‘aggressive tax planning’ to avoid taxes in ways that are not within the spirit of the law.</p>
<p>This aggressive tax planning is a source of increasing concern for many countries and they have developed various strategies to deal with it. Working cooperatively, countries can deter, detect and respond to aggressive tax planning while at the same time ensuring certainty and predictability for compliant taxpayers. <br /><a name="more"></a><br /><a href="http://www.oecd.org/document/61/0,3746,en_2649_33767_48570813_1_1_1_1,00.html"><em>Corporate Loss Utilisation through Aggressive Tax Planning</em></a> [report is gated], which builds on <a href="http://www.oecd.org/document/48/0,3746,en_21571361_44315115_45944752_1_1_1_1,00.html"><em>Addressing Tax Risks Involving Bank Losses</em></a> (2010), looks at a number of commonly used schemes and identifies three key risk areas: corporate reorganisations, financial instruments and non-arm’s length transfer pricing.</p></blockquote>
<p>
<p>David Cay Johnson <a target="_blank" href="https://research.tdwaterhouse.ca/research/public/Markets/NewsArticle/1314-N1E78021O-1">presents his interpretation of the data</a>:</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote><p>The latest evidence of this tax after-the-factism comes from an eye-popping global tax avoidance study by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development.</p>
<p>What makes the study by tax authorities in 17 major countries so astonishing is not just the size of the losses, but when they were booked.</p>
<p>Country after country showed corporate losses equal to a 10th or more of an entire country&#8217;s economic output.</p>
<p>In Germany, corporations list 576.3 billion euros of tax losses on their books one year, equal to one quarter of German economic output that same year. What matters there is not just the stunning size of these losses, but also that they were booked before the global meltdown. The German data are from 2006.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>I don&#8217;t understand my fellow US citizens.  Many commenters will note that they told me that I didn&#8217;t since I don&#8217;t live in the USA, but I didn&#8217;t when I lived there.</p>
<p>After the jump I try and fail to make sense of the latest <a href="http://msnbcmedia.msn.com/i/MSNBC/Sections/NEWS/A_Politics/_Today_Stories_Teases/Correct_NBCWSJ_poll.pdf">NBC/WSJ poll</a>.</p>
<p>The nickel summary is that I thought that Obama should propose stimulus based on tax cuts not spending increases, because spending won&#8217;t be increased, high spending is unpopular, and there is no point paying a political price for a proposal which congress will reject anyway.  Then the people say they want more spending (and lower deficits).</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>OK so look at Q34 what should the jobs proposal include.</p>
<p>The second most popular option (after the Georgia like program of subsidize hiring of long term unemployed for 8 weeks) is infrastructure spending with a 47% saying its a good idea and only 26% saying its a bad idea.  Continuing to cut the payroll tax rate gets 40 vs 20.   Yes only 40 % of US adults think it is a good idea to cut their taxes !?! </p>
<p>Strange. But what is much stranger is comparing Q34 in which a huge majority support hiring subsidies and a plurality support all the other deficit increasing proposals and responses to Q28</p>
<p>Which of the following two statements comes closer to your point of view? (ROTATE STATEMENTS) </p>
<p>Statement A: The president and the Congress should worry more about boosting the economy even though it may mean larger budget deficits now and in the future.  <br />38%<br />Statement B: The president and the Congress should worry more about keeping the budget deficit down, even though it may mean it will take longer for the economy to recover. <br />56%</p>
<p>Now the question does suggest that stimulus increases budget deficits &#8212; this is only true if the balanced budget multiplier is zero which no one but Robert Lucas asserts (one of the few ways to fail my intro macro course is to assert that one can stimulate with spending increases or tax cuts but not with spending increases financed by tax increases).  It also adds &#8220;in the future,&#8221; which is true only if one assumes that spending is increased not just pulled forward (accelerating maintanance which will be needed sooner or later) or that there is no long lasting effect of unemployment on the unemployed (hysteresis).  That&#8217;s an &#8220;or&#8221;  but the first is a simple point and everyone believes in hysteresis (even if very few know what the word means).  But on the other hand, the question asserts (correctly but controversially) that austerity will slow recovery.  </p>
<p>Why do people hate deficits so much ?  They do even if they are told that deficits are good for the economy (which they are only during the rare periods when the economy is in a liquidity trap).  Why do they advocate focusing on the deficit and policies designed to increase the deficit ?</p>
<p>Before going on, there is no majority American.  Most people gave consistent answers but enough flipped to change a solid majority for austerity into a plurality for every kind of stimulus under consideration.  What might they be thinking ?</p>
<p>I think part of what is going on is that Government spending is unpopular in the abstract but popular in the concrete (and asphalt) .  One way to reconcile the answers of those who flipped is that they want to cut foreign aid by 20% of the Federal budget and increase infrastructure spending by 5% of the Federal budget.  It is hard to understand the policy proposals of people who don&#8217;t know what current policy is (foreign aid is about 0.7% of the budget).</p>
<p>Another is that they really really want to soak the rich &#8212; to stimulate without adding to the deficit by paying for it with higher taxes on the rich.  Then if told this won&#8217;t happen (it won&#8217;t) they don&#8217;t want stimulus at all.  I think the best policy would be to stimulate a lot and soak the rich, so I hope I have company (although I think that deficit financed stimulus is almost as good).  But I doubt it.</p>
<p>Also the voters blame Republicans yet generic Republican is ahead of Obama and the Republicans are ahead on the generic congressional ballot.  It is just weird.</p>
<p>But again, the penny summary is that I was totally wrong about the most politically effective jobs speech.  Obama should call for infrastructure spending.  He was right and I was wrong (he has more pollsters than I do).</p>
