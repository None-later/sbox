                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Three themes here starting with a well discussed one – <a href="http://matthewyglesias.theatlantic.com/archives/2007/11/giulianis_character.php">Matthew Yglesias</a> questions not only Rudy Giuliani&#8217;s honesty but also his character.  Speaking of dishonesty, it seems that the makers of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/03/business/03generic.html?em&#038;ex=1194235200&#038;en=485df91d458027e1&#038;ei=5087%0A">Lipitor</a> is trying to extend its monopoly power by lying about the side effects of drugs made by its competitors:</p>
<blockquote><p>The generic version of Zocor, simvastatin, is now much cheaper than Lipitor, leading insurers to press doctors and patients to switch. But Pfizer is not letting its flagship drug go down without a fight. The company has mounted a campaign that includes advertisements, lobbying efforts and a paid speaking tour by a former secretary of the federal Department of Health and Human Services.  Pfizer is also promoting a study — whose findings many experts are questioning — that concluded that British patients who switched to simvastatin had more heart attacks and deaths than those who remained on Lipitor.</p></blockquote>
<p>The third theme starts with an NYTimes oped written by <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/04/business/04view.html?ex=1351828800&#038;en=7ebf86b6773f35bd&#038;ei=5090&#038;partner=rssuserland&#038;emc=rss">Greg Mankiw</a> who says three popular statements about the poor state of our health care system may be true but are misleading.  <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2007/11/mankiw-beyond-t.html">Mark Thoma</a> says Greg does his best to belittle the health care problem and sweep it under the rug adding:</p>
<blockquote><p>He should also know that life expectancy from birth, which he is using in his arguments about different death rates for infants and the young, is not the only or even the best way to make life expectancy comparisons (as opposed, to say, the life expectancy at age 30, age 40, etc., i.e. given that you&#8217;ve already made it through the infant and young adult years). On obesity, it&#8217;s correlated with being poor. Why might that be the case? Yeah, I know, they just don&#8217;t have Greg&#8217;s self-control. If they did, they&#8217;d be skinny and rich, just like him! I was surprised, too, at Greg&#8217;s implication that Canadians are too backward to be able to &#8220;supply high-calorie foods inexpensively&#8221; like we can which is why they have less of a problem with obesity. And some of the arguments like blaming infant mortality on lack of morals rather than lack of access to health care &#8211; a key problem for the group he is targeting with his Malthusian moralizing &#8211; is a bit, um, surprising. Anyway, you get the picture, it&#8217;s bad morals (guns, births, eating too much, etc.), illegal aliens, people who make bad choices and don&#8217;t buy insurance (more moralizing). Our people just aren&#8217;t as moral as Canadians &#8211; we have too many people in certain groups so we look bad in comparison. It&#8217;s not the failure of the system to deliver health care to these groups, nope, it&#8217;s all those immoral people in the groups.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m a little confused as I thought Greg was supporting Mitt Romney who does have a health care plan that is not bat-shit insane.  The bat-shit insane plan belongs to Rudy Giuliani who seems to think that the poor have too much insurance, which is why they eat poorly and generally do not take care of themselves.  Some of the comments are Mark’s place note that the poor do not have the choices the rest of us have – as in shopping at Whole Foods rather than Albertson’s and eating sushi rather than Big Macs.  But aren’t rice cakes generally inexpensive?  Yes, I have the GOP health care theme for 2008: <strong>Let Them Eat Rice Cakes!</strong></p>

<p>Over at <a href="http://econospeak.blogspot.com/2007/11/mixed-labor-market-report.html">EconoSpeak</a>, I document that <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=ZmZmN2QyYTkzMTM1NTllYzliYjgwM2Y4N2Y4OGFiNjk=">Lawrence Kudlow</a> is guilty of:</p>
<blockquote><p>the Secretary Snow standard – the most reliable indicator of employment growth is the survey that gives the larger number for the month just reported. Kudlow can always be counted on if you’re looking for serial dishonesty.</p></blockquote>
<p>It is worse than that:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the October jobs report, average hourly wages for non-management workers increased 3.8 percent, well above inflation.</p></blockquote>
<p>It is true that nominal wages were 3.78% higher than they were as of October 2006 but we do not know the October CPI index yet.  We can note that from September 2006 to September 2007, real wages rose by 1.2%.  But as our chart shows, this real wage series has shown a lot of noise but little upward drift.  Why did I choose a four year period?  Read what Kudlow said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Looking back over four years, from the middle of 2003 when President Bush’s tax cuts took effect, the economy has created 8.6 million new jobs. Presently, non-farm payrolls in the U.S. stand at 138.5 million, a new record high. The unemployment rate today is a low 4.7 percent. And total civilian employment stands at 146 million, just shy of the record high. In fact, when you look at the October jobs report, it appears that employment is speeding up, not slowing down.</p></blockquote>
<p>Really?  I guess Larry has no clue as to what’s been happening to the employment to population ratio.  Or maybe he does but he does not mind lying to National Review readers as he considers them to be stupid little children who deserve to be lied to.</p>

                                <p>This is getting fun.  A couple of weeks ago, <a href="http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalradar/2007/10/giuliani-knows-.html">Senator Biden</a> had had enough of GOP tough talk with respect to Iran:</p>
<blockquote><p>ABC News&#8217; Mary Bruce Reports: Democratic Presidential candidate Sen. Joe Biden, D-Del., targeted a Republican rival this morning, accusing Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani of knowing &#8220;virtually nothing about foreign policy.&#8221; &#8220;I love these guys on the Republican side. They don&#8217;t &#8211; they know virtually &#8211; except for John McCain &#8211; virtually nothing about foreign policy,&#8221; Biden told ABC News&#8217; George Stephanopoulos in a This Week interview. While Giuliani has promised that, if elected, Iran would never develop nuclear weapons, Biden said he could not make the same guarantee. &#8220;I can&#8217;t make the promise, but I am much more likely to achieve the result than Giuliani,&#8221; Biden, the Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, asserted &#8230; Biden, who was first elected to the Senate at age 29, went on to attack Giuliani&#8217;s record. &#8220;He&#8217;s been the mayor of a city, a great city. How does that qualify him&#8230;what has he demonstrated he knows about even national security?&#8221; &#8220;His claim to fame was he settled [New York] city, in terms of its violence. He did that with a Clinton-Biden crime bill. He got another 3,000 cops. They wipe out the crime bill, what do you hear from Giuliani? Not a word. What do you hear from Giuliani about the fact that we have a situation where the 9/11 Commission has recommended $41 million -billion worth of changes in our national security, the president has blown it off? What&#8217;s Giuliani &#8211; do you hear him talking about that at all? Do you hear him talking about cargo containers, about his ports, about anything?&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>A few days ago, Biden said <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2007/10/30/biden-rudys-sentences-c_n_70509.html">this</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;And the irony is, Rudy Giuliani, probably the most underqualified man since George Bush to seek the presidency, is here talking about any of the people here. Rudy Giuliani&#8230; I mean, think about it! Rudy Giuliani. There&#8217;s only three things he mentions in a sentence &#8211; a noun, a verb, and 9/11. There&#8217;s nothing else! There&#8217;s nothing else! And I mean this sincerely. He&#8217;s genuinely not qualified to be president.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://tpmelectioncentral.com/2007/11/rudy_was_for_biden_not_having_foreign_policy_experience_before_he_was_against_it.php">Greg Sargent</a> reports that RUDY decided to fire back:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s one thing to speak about what you want or even pass laws about it. It&#8217;s another thing to actually do it. Foreign policy experience to me means being an ambassador, being in the state department.  Unless I&#8217;m missing something, Rudy explicitly used the words &#8220;foreign policy experience.&#8221; But then Rudy was later confronted about his contention that Biden Senate Foreign Relations Committee chair Biden lacks said experience. And he responded that he hadn&#8217;t attacked Biden this way at all. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t mention foreign policy.&#8221; Rudy said. Of course, Rudy did in fact &#8220;mention foreign policy.&#8221;  Wolf Blitzer did fact-check Rudy here, but he also kind of laughed off Rudy&#8217;s mendacity</p></blockquote>
<p>Greg also notes that Biden responded:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Today’s comments come from a guy &#8211; Rudy Giuliani &#8211; who said Dick Cheney, the architect of Bush’s failed policy in Iraq, was a great choice for vice president and who recommended the now discredited Bernie Kerik to be Secretary of Homeland Security. Once again, Rudy has demonstrated his complete lack of knowledge of U.S. foreign policy.”</p></blockquote>
<p>You can listen to RUDY <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1U14Jf-_MM">here</a>. More from Biden’s can be found <a href="http://www.joebiden.com/contribution/2?id=0015">here</a>.<br />Of course, RUDY can always send out his attack dog known as <a href="http://newsfeedresearcher.com/data/articles_n44/idn2007.10.31.14.15.08.html">Katie Levinson</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>That prompted Katie Levinson, Giuliani&#8217;s communications director, to dredge up accusations that Biden plagiarized speeches, which helped sink his 1988 presidential bid. In her statement, she followed that up with this zinger: &#8220;Senator Biden certainly falls in to the bucket of those on the stage tonight who have never had executive experience and have never run anything. Wait, I take that back, Senator Biden has never run anything but his mouth. Such a desperate attack from Senator Biden is to be expected considering I &#8211; Katie Levinson have a better chance of becoming President than he does.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Good grief!  Multiple choice time.  Is RUDY: (a) an egomaniac (as Josh Marshall suggests); (b) a village idiot; (c) a spoiled little child; or (d) all of the above?</p>

<blockquote><p>Wilson and colleagues compared patterns of healthcare utilization and direct costs of prostate cancer-related treatments over a 5.5-year period in 4553 newly diagnosed patients, stratified by age, risk group, and ethnic group</p>
<p>In the first 6 months after diagnosis, direct prostate-related costs per patient were high ($11,495) and highly variable ($2586 for watchful waiting to $24,204 for external-beam radiation therapy), the researchers report.</p>
<p>After the first 6 months, prostate-related costs were only $3044, ranging from $2418 for radical prostatectomy to $6019 for androgen deprivation therapy.</p>
<p>Cumulative costs for the entire period were highest for androgen deprivation therapy ($69,244) and external-beam radiation therapy ($59,455) and lowest for watchful waiting ($32,135) and brachytherapy ($35,143), the researchers note.</p>
<p>The most costly treatments were generally reserved for the highest risk groups, the report indicates, whereas the least costly treatments were primarily used by the lowest risk groups.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our data demonstrate that prostate-related costs per person are substantial and sustained over time, and that short-term treatment cost comparisons most commonly found in the literature do not truly reflect the cost of treatment choices over the long term,&#8221; the investigators conclude.</p>
<p>&#8220;It appears that current treatment is following clinical treatment guidelines from our data,&#8221; Dr. Wilson added. &#8220;Our paper also reminds us that it is important to examine the downstream costs (which indicate more care needs) of each of the different treatments.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Compare that to Rudy&#8217;s complaints and soundbite.  Which would you read?</p>

                                <p>There&#8217;s a story I read a long time ago.  I don&#8217;t remember any of the details, but I suspect its true.</p>
<p>Basically, in the early days of the British occupation of India, a British Viceroy outlawed the practice of burning a widow to death on her husband&#8217;s funeral pyre.  Shortly after that, a delegation of local worthies came to the Viceroy and said, &#8220;This is a long-standing Indian custom.&#8221;</p>
<p>The response from the Viceroy was, &#8220;Its a long-standing British custom to hang those who burn women to death.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, the British occupation of India had its positives and its negatives.  There were some horrific massacres along the way.  But they made India into something that can be said to be partly an English version of Southeast Asia.  And this little story, I think, indicates how its done.  Had they done the alternative &#8211; going along with local custom &#8211; burning a widow to death on her husband&#8217;s funeral pyre might still be done today.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p>Update&#8230;</p>
<p>Where the Brits simply signed off &#8211; say, on the caste system, whatever they signed off on is still there.  What the Brits were willing to hang even their allies in order to accomplish, whether such a change would have been for the good or for the good or bad, got changed.</p>
<p>Consider this a follow up to my post on Iraq earlier today.</p>

                                <p>We noted <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/11/october-employment-report.html">yesterday</a> that the employment-population ratio and the labor force participation rate fell again last month.  So what do the idiots on cable news tell us yesterday?  Of course, that unemployment remains low.  <a href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/beat_the_press_archive?month=11&#038;year=2007&#038;base_name=ben_bernanke_looks_at_employme">Dean Baker</a> gets it:</p>
<blockquote><p>But even if the picture in the establishment survey is still on net positive, the household data surely is not. The most striking item is the drop in the employment rate (EPOP), the percentage of the population that is employed. This fell by 0.2 percentage points in October. While the monthly numbers on the household side are always erratic, this decline is part of a longer trend. The 62.7 percent EPOP is 0.6 percentage points below the December 2006 level, corresponding to a drop in employment of 1.4 million people. One of the peculiarities of this cycle is that labor market weakness has expressed itself far more in declining labor force participation rather than measured unemployment.</p></blockquote>
<p>Dean also notes that <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/2004/20040104/default.htm">Ben Bernanke</a> also gets it:</p>
<blockquote><p>However, my sense is that, when one looks at the full range of information available, the labor market looks (if anything) weaker than a 6 percent unemployment rate suggests. For example, it appears that workers who have lost their jobs in the past couple of years have been more likely to withdraw from the labor force (rather than report themselves as unemployed) than were job losers in previous recessions. Indeed, the labor force participation rate fell sharply between 2000 and 2003, from a little over 67 percent to about 66-1/4 percent. Similarly, the ratio of employment to the working-age population, a statistic that reflects both those who become unemployed and those who leave the labor force, has fallen significantly, by 2.8 percentage points between its peak in April 2000 and its trough this past September. The tendency of recent job losers to leave the labor force likely masks some of the effects of job cuts on the unemployment rate, so that the current measured level of unemployment may understate the extent of job loss or the difficulty of finding new work. Of course, a labor market that is slack and improving only slowly is likely to produce continued slow growth in nominal wages, contributing to continued moderate growth in costs.</p></blockquote>
<p>This speech was delivered on January 4, 2004.  One would think someone in the press would have realized the wisdom of looking at the employment to population ratio by now.  Let me turn the microphone back to Dean:</p>
<blockquote><p>I was glad to see the vice-chair of the Fed focus on what I had considered to often be a better measure of labor market slack than the unemployment rate. Unfortunately, his comments seem to have been forgotten by those covering the employment data.</p></blockquote>

<p>Decisions on the Margins.</p>
<p>Rudy Guiliani&#8217;s use of sensational prostate cancer statistics is a time tested way for the demagogue to sway the crowd. Thinking about the cancer survival issue reminds me of Sputnik, yes I knew what it meant in 1957.</p>
<p>Then the Soviets revealed the fact that their Germans were ahead of our Germans in rocket science. The conclusion made was they were ahead of the US in science and technology in general. A conclusion made at the extreme margin which resulted in a huge and lengthy arms races, already on going, and extended cold war. The US reacted large at the margin.</p>
<p>In cancer survival rates, the opposite conclusion is made. The debate about extremes is used to say that &#8220;they&#8221; are not as good as the US and that we should not make any changes which might better the stance in health delivery for the 95% because we are better than &#8220;them&#8221; at the 5%.</p>
<p>The arguments over Rudy&#8217;s misuse of statistics missed the point. It is not false hypothesis testing, it is demagoguery.</p>
<p>Rudy would be 4 more years of deception and demagoguery. </p>

                                <p>I can&#8217;t speak for reasons anyone else might have for wanting US forces pulled out of Iraq immediately, but this is mine&#8230;</p>
<p>At the tail end of WW2, Germany&#8217;s second in command and head of the SS, Heinrich Himmler, decided to save his own tail.  He figured the war was lost, and while he was still afraid of Hitler, he thought he had two bargaining chips he could use with the major Western Allies.  The first bargaining chip was the expectation, both in Germany and among some of the top officers in the West, that sooner or later there would be war with the Soviet Union.  Considering that, as Churchill put it, the Red Army &#8220;tore the guts out of the Nazi war machine,&#8221; such a possibility was not to be taken lightly.  The thought among many was that the West would need the Nazi war machine if it was to prevail against the Red Army.  The second bargaining chip he had was the number of Jews that had survived until that point &#8211; in ghettoes and concentration camps.</p>
<p>There were several preliminary back channel negotiations between Himmler and the Western Allies in the last few weeks of the war, the best known through a Swedish diplomat, Folke Bernadotte.  At this point, let me remind the reader &#8211; Himmler was head of the SS, which means he in effect had his own military (the Waffen-SS), and he ran the concentration camps.  When Hitler found out about the negotiations, of course, he ordered Himmler&#8217;s arrest, no doubt to be followed by hanging from piano wire.  Himmler fled, was captured by the Western Allies, and committed suicide.  </p>
<p>Now, let&#8217;s assume things had gone slightly different.  Let us say that Himmler had knocked off Hitler, and had managed to prevail over rivals like Goering.  If the Western Powers had signed a separate peace with Germany &#8211; and turned a blind eye toward the continued operation of the concentration camps and the brutality of the SS (think <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malmedy_massacre">Malmedy</a>) &#8211; how would you feel looking back?  How would the country &#8211; our country &#8211; be different today as a result?  </p>
<p>Now, the situation in Iraq is not a precise parallel; history never offers precise parallels.  And we have, at times, made our accommodations with the likes of Himmler (since I grew up in Latin America, I can&#8217;t help but think of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rios_Montt">Rios Montt</a>), but in WW2 itself, we were allied with Stalin against, arguably, a greater evil.  </p>
<p>But still, aligning ourselves with thugs is something that, if we do, we have to do with care, because we do it at the peril of our soul.  Nietzsche tells us what happens when you look into the abyss for long enough; arming, training, financing, and allying yourself with the abyss is one way to look into it for a very, very long time.  </p>
<p>And make no mistake, we are aligned with thugs.  Those Sunni sheikhs that have turned against Al Qaeda &#8211; they were shooting at Americans not long ago, and would be today if they didn&#8217;t see us as the lesser of various other evils.  Ditto the Shia death squads.  And the government, such as it is, of Iraq, is also no prize.</p>
<p>All of which is to say&#8230; I don&#8217;t think we risk a situation where we are left with a series of sectarian cleansed enclaves populated exclusively by those who have been successful at performing the cleansing.  The evidence shows we&#8217;re already some way toward that outcome, and it has been achieved, successfully and absolutely, in some areas.  (That, incidentally, may well include Kurdistan. Its quiet, but only because the Kurdish cleansers got an earlier start &#8211; they had the entire 1990s to work unimpeded.)  And its not because I think we risk a situation where we have aided and abetted; I think we&#8217;ve been aiding and abetting for a long time now.  </p>
<p>No.  Where I think we are in Iraq, right now, as a nation, is in the position of a gang members of a particularly vicious gang.  A gang member who has been part of horrific crimes and violence which benefits the gang and nobody else.  That gang member can&#8217;t fix the past, and he can&#8217;t change the other members of the gang.  But he can, at least, get up and walk away.</p>

<blockquote><p>Looking for signs of progress in Iraq, the Bush administration has been quick to jump on reports of reduced violence in Iraq. The “<a title="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2007/10/20071018-2.html" href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2007/10/20071018-2.html">violence is thankfully coming down</a>,” said White House spokesperson Dana Perino. Violence is “<a title="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2007/10/20071022-8.html" href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2007/10/20071022-8.html">down significantly from last year</a>,” declared President Bush.<br />In a hearing before the House Appropriations Committee today, Joe Christoff of the Government Accountability Office stated that this recent reduction in violence should be taken with a grain of salt, as it coincides with increased sectarian cleansing and a massive refugee displacement:<br />I think that’s [ethnic cleansing] an important consideration in even assessing the overall security situation in Iraq. You know, we look at the attack data going down, but it’s not taking into consideration that there might be fewer attacks because you have ethnically cleansed neighborhoods, particularly in the Baghdad area. […]<br />It’s produced 2.2. million refugees that have left, it’s produced two million internally displaced persons within the countryas well.<br />Watch it:<br />Christoff’s conclusions echo that of ret. Gen. James Jones last month, who observed “<a title="http://thinkprogress.org/2007/09/06/sunni-shia-baghdad/" href="http://thinkprogress.org/2007/09/06/sunni-shia-baghdad/">progress</a>” in a Shi’a-led ethnic cleansing campaign.<br />Also in attendance at the hearing was Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction (SIGIR) Stuart Bowen. In his <a title="http://www.sigir.mil/reports/quarterlyreports/Oct07/pdf/Report_-_October_2007.pdf" href="http://www.sigir.mil/reports/quarterlyreports/Oct07/pdf/Report_-_October_2007.pdf">quarterly report to Congress</a> released today, Bowen acknowledged the reduction in violence but stated that it has not been accompanied by tangible political reconciliation, a finding that was <a title="http://www.washingtontimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=" href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071030/NATION/110300035/-1/RSS_NATION_POLITICS&#038;template=nextpage" template="nextpage">neglected by the traditional media</a> in its reporting today. In Baghdad, for example, Provincial Reconstruction Team officials <a title="http://www.sigir.mil/reports/quarterlyreports/Oct07/pdf/Report_-_October_2007.pdf" href="http://www.sigir.mil/reports/quarterlyreports/Oct07/pdf/Report_-_October_2007.pdf">note</a>:<br />Despite reduced violence, officials are pessimistic that lasting reconciliation is occurring. … In Diyala, there is a desire to work toward reconciliation, but it will take years to overcome ill-will between tribes.<br />Earlier this month, Gen. David Petraeus confidently declared, “<a title="http://www.abcnews.go.com/WN/Story?id=" href="http://www.abcnews.go.com/WN/Story?id=3717999&#038;page=2" page="2">There’s a local reconciliation</a>” in Diyala province.</p></blockquote>
<p>I was unable to obtain a transcript at this time to ascertain context.   Shorter term goals under 50 year timetables seem more reasonable to me.  What are our goals for sure this time?</p>
