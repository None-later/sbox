<p>1) Reasonable and reasonably honest conservative list update: Josh Barro is very reasonable and quite honest. But is he still a conservative?  <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-01-14/will-obama-ruin-the-economy-to-ruin-the-republicans-.html">He sure doesn&#8217;t always sound like one.</a></p>
<p>2) About  #1) see an example of the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=kleiman+ness+monster&#038;rlz=1C1FDUM_enIT485IT485&#038;oq=kleiman+ness+monster&#038;aqs=chrome.0.57j5j0l2j62l2.3635&#038;sourceid=chrome&#038;ie=UTF-8">ness monster</a>:    <br />&#8220;But the conservative worldview is robust because of its imperviousness to evidence.&#8221; which clearly means ”But the conservative worldview is robust because it&#8217;s impervious to evidence.&#8221;</p>
<p>3) What&#8217;s with the Bloomberg Headline person ? The article explains how Conservative&#8217;s are insane and might destroy the economy to make their prediction that it will be destroyed if Obama is re-elected true.   <br />&#8220;Conservatives are sure that the Obama presidency will lead to an economic calamity, and they will prove it, if necessary.&#8221; but the headline suggests that Obama might ruin the economy.</p>

<p>A Modest Proposal for Jacob Lew: Acknowledge Three Simple Facts about U.S. Fiscal Reality</p>
<p>January 15, 2013 by <a href="http://backtofullemployment.org/author/robert-pollin/">Robert Pollin</a></p>
<p><strong></strong>In a reasonable world, in which we recognized the culpability of big-time D.C. politicians and bureaucrats who allowed Wall Street hyper-speculation to run wild and eventually cause the 2008-09 crash and Great Recession, Jacob Lew would be understood as a terrible choice as President Obama’s second-term Treasury Secretary, replacing Timothy Geithner. The outstanding journalist Robert Sheer gives us the basic background in <a href="http://www.thenation.com/article/172154/inconvenient-truth-about-jack-lew">a recent <em>Nation</em> article.</a> Sheer writes:</p>
<p><em>I suppose that he can’t be much worse than Timothy Geithner, but that should be scant cause for cheer over the news that the president has nominated Jack Lew as Treasury secretary. Both championed the financial deregulation craze of the Clinton administration, and both are acolytes of Robert Rubin, the former Clinton Treasury secretary who unfettered Wall Street greed and then took his own considerable cut of the action.</em></p>
<p>But because we are not living in a reasonable world, at least in terms of D.C.-insider debates on economic policy, Lew’s nomination apparently faces opposition from Republicans because he appears insufficiently committed to an austerity budget that could push the economy back into recession while also devastating spending for Social Security, education, health care, family support, and unemployment insurance.<br />It is clear that debate over the fiscal deficit and austerity will dominate Lew’s confirmation hearings and at least his initial period in office, if he ends up getting confirmed. But without pursuing any deep explorations about who should be taxed more or less, or whether 47 percent of U.S. citizens are indeed freeloaders, I would just propose that Lew be willing to recognize three sets of very simple, irrefutable facts about the current U.S. fiscal condition. Here they are:</p>
<p><strong>Fact #1: The U.S. government is not facing a fiscal crisis.</strong><br />In any common sense meaning of the term “fiscal crisis,” we would be referring to the government’s inability to make its forthcoming payments to its creditors. By that common sense definition, the U.S. federal government is in just about the best shape it has ever been. Figure 1 below tells the story.</p>
<div><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-udqFD0n5QN0/UPgy013fBLI/AAAAAAAABYQ/9Rxqe2J-qtk/s1600/pollin.png" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-udqFD0n5QN0/UPgy013fBLI/AAAAAAAABYQ/9Rxqe2J-qtk/s320/pollin.png" width="320"></a></div>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>According to the most recent data from the third quarter of 2012 (which we term “2012.3”), the federal government spent 7.7 percent of its total expenditures on interest to its creditors. As the figure shows, that figure is less than half of the average figure under the full 12 years of Republican Presidents Reagan and Bush, when the government paid, on average, 16.8 percent of the total budget to cover interest payments. Right now, as we see, government interest payments are at near historic lows, not highs. As Treasury Secretary-designate, Lew needs to just state this obvious, and highly relevant point. To my knowledge, it has been heretofore completely left out of the insider-D.C. fiscal cliff debates, by Lew, Obama, and Geithner, to say nothing of the Republicans.</p>
<p><strong>Fact #2: Interest rates on government bonds are at historic lows.</strong><br />Figure 2 tells this story, which is well-known, but is not being given proper recognition in the deficit debates. As the figure shows, at the end of 2012, the U.S. government was borrowing at 0.7 percent on its 5-year Treasury Bonds.</p>
<div><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-rmFzLkU5JpA/UPgy0lhpUPI/AAAAAAAABYE/uDUBk5qh2So/s1600/pollin2.png" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="234" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-rmFzLkU5JpA/UPgy0lhpUPI/AAAAAAAABYE/uDUBk5qh2So/s320/pollin2.png" width="320"></a></div>
<p>It is precisely because the federal government can borrow so cheaply that our interest payments are corresponding low. Deficit hawks—economists and politicians alike—have been insisting for years that the rates are about to spike back up. Of course, interest rates will rise back up, at some point. We need to be vigilant about that. But this hasn’t happened over the full four year period since the onset of the Great Recession. This enables the U.S. government to maintain stimulus levels of spending, to get the economy onto a healthy growth trajectory. In other words, we have no reason to submit to an austerity agenda now. We should expect Jacob Lew to at least state the obvious here: that the deficit hawks have been wrong about an impending interest rate spike for four years running.</p>
<p><strong>Fact #3: Current large government deficits are due to the recession, not out-of-control spending.</strong><br />This is so obvious it should be barely worth mentioning. But simple facts are ignored repeatedly in the fiscal deficit debates. No doubt during the Lew hearings, there will be more discussion about the current crisis being due to the 47 percent freeloading population who, as Mitt Romney put it after his defeat, “want stuff” from the government. As we see in Figure 3, the government’s fiscal deficit spiked at 10.1 percent of GDP in 2009, immediately after the onset of the recession.</p>
<div><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-iuW0UJCVhYg/UPgy0Gmw1MI/AAAAAAAABX4/-rkxuf-CIW0/s1600/pollin3.png" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="266" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-iuW0UJCVhYg/UPgy0Gmw1MI/AAAAAAAABX4/-rkxuf-CIW0/s320/pollin3.png" width="320"></a></div>
<p>But does anybody want to seriously claim that the pattern of fiscal deficits that we see in Figure 3 is due to the fact that people didn’t want too much stuff as of 2007 or 2008, then all of the sudden, that demand for stuff soared in 2009, which was just coincidentally exactly when the Wall Street crash brought the economy to its knees?</p>
<p>The deficit has fallen modestly since 2009, to 8.5 percent of GDP in 2012. But the single most important thing we can do to lower the fiscal deficit further is to push unemployment down. This will generate increased government revenues with people paying more in income and sales taxes, and it will reduce government payments on unemployment insurance and supplemental aid for health care and family support. The U.S. has the capacity to pursue a stimulus agenda now quite easily, precisely because interest rates and interest payments to creditors remain historically low.</p>
<p>It shouldn’t be any stretch at all for Jacob Lew to acknowledge these three simple, irrefutable points. But will he do it? My guess is that he will not. If I am right in this guess, it will provide only further evidence as to the dismal state of the economic policy debate in official Washington, including Democrats like Lew here as well as Republicans.</p>

<p>Well, Greg Sargent tries to perpetuate <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2013/01/15/debt-ceiling-endgame-comes-into-view/">the Myth of Moderate (but of course Unnamed) Republican Senators</a>.  Stan Collender <a href="http://capitalgainsandgames.com/blog/stan-collender/2698/sequester-and-shutdown-could-be-more-likely-fight-over-debt-ceiling">gets punked</a>.  Nothing new on the first, but <a href="http://capitalgainsandgames.com/blog/stan-collender/2697/heres-why-republican-talk-about-default-and-shutdown-not-empty-threat">Collender’s previous piece</a> about the realities of the Ancestral Party gives the lie to Sargent’s delusion.  Economics version: the Republican Party is at a stable equilibrium. And has been there or near it for at least sixteen years, which is probably two-thirds of Greg S’s life.  You might think he would notice.</p>
<p>The NRA—most recently seen attacking the President for being President, and before that discussing decade-old video games—<a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2013/01/16/opinion/ferguson-nra-video-games/index.html">released a video game</a> so that four-year-olds can get practice using AR-15s to kill people.  I suspect McMegan and her literacy-impaired cohort, Jeffrey Goldberg, are lamenting that the kids are not being taught to be cannon fodder, but will wait for <a href="http://agonyin8fits.blogspot.com/">Susan of Texas</a> (whose current marvelous <a href="http://agonyin8fits.blogspot.com/2013/01/the-latest-moral-crusade-of-andrew.html">takedown of Publicity Whore Andrew Sullivan</a> is required reading for everyone <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2013/01/andrew-sullivan-and-his-daily-dish-go-the-full-utopian.html">fooled into paying money to support his ego</a>) to provide details.</p>
<p>And Brad DeLong’s Better Half put up <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2013/01/ann-marie-marciarille-up-in-smoke-obamacares-tobacco-surcharge.html">a post on tobacco surcharges</a> that keeps me from having to figure out the latest AAA insurance policy offering.  If I were a marketing executive at a Life Insurance firm right now, I would be heavily advertising 20-year Term Life policies to 25 to 30-year-old smokers.</p>
<p>Oh, and Notre Dame football has another scandal surrounding it. Scott Lemieux says <a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2013/01/the-real-notre-dame-scandal">what needs to be said</a>.  Apparently, “Catholics versus Convicts” is only a matter of who owned the police and the judges.</p>
<p>Probably a good two days not to have gotten out of bed.</p>

                                <p>Reader mmcosker sends this e-mail pointing to <i>Why Social Security Can’t go Bankrupt: Rerun</i> at Forbe&#8217;s Magazine:</p>
<p>John T. Harvey&#8217;s Pragmatic Economics column at Forbes is one of the best. He is a Professor of Economics at Texas Christian University, and has a knack for breaking down politically charged &#8220;third rail&#8221; economic topics into terms that most anyone can understand. Below is just such a topic that deals with the myth that Social Security is broke &#8211; or even broken. Not entirely sure how widely read John is, as this article has 910 views.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why Social Security Can’t go Bankrupt: Rerun&#8221;</p>
<p><i>It is a logical impossibility for Social Security to go bankrupt. We can voluntarily choose to suspend or eliminate the program, but it could never fail because it “ran out of money.” This belief is the result of a common error: conceptualizing Social Security from the micro (individual) rather than the macro (economy-wide) perspective. It’s not a pension fund into which you put your money when you are young and from which you draw when you are old. It’s an immediate transfer from workers today to retirees today. That’s what it has always been and that’s what it has to be–there is no other possible way for it to work.</i></p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know about you, but when I recently updated this chart I was pleasantly surprised by how much the deficit had improved.  In the third quarter of 2012 &#8211;the last quarter of the previous fiscal year &#8212; the deficit had already fallen to 7.0% of GDP as compared to the peak of 10.5% in the fourth quarter of 2009.  </p>
<p>Moreover, with the ending of the tax break on payroll taxes and higher taxes on the top incomes as well as  prospects for improved growth in 2013 we may be experiencing the best improvement in the deficit picture since the Clinton presidency.  Moreover, the large scale shifting of incomes back to 2012 to avoid higher taxes implies that the last quarter of 2012 could also show a big improvement. This chart clearly shows why all the deficit hawks are keeping quiet on what is actually happening to the deficit</p>

<p>The Federal Reserve keeps transcripts of its meetings to set monetary policy, and releases them with a five year delay. It does not announce in advance when they will be released, but if the past is a guide, any day now we will be getting full transcripts of the 2007 meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee. Transcripts of all eight regularly scheduled meetings, plus three special emergency sessions to respond to the earliest ripples of the financial crisis, will be posted to the <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/">Federal Reserve’s Web site</a>.  (The FOMC had a big year in 2007!

<blockquote><p>The U.S. trade deficit with China may be much smaller than thought according to new trade measurements that capture the flow of raw materials and intermediate goods as they work their way around the world into final products.</p>
<p>In a significant revision to economic record keeping the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and the World Trade Organization have patched together international databases that show not just the value of final goods trading hands between countries – the traditional method of measuring imports and exports.</p>
<p>Rather, they have tried to unpack each step that a good takes through what has become an increasingly fragmented global system – with raw materials from one country becoming steel in another, becoming a car part in a third, becoming a finished auto in a fourth that is then exported to a fifth.</p>
<p>[snip]</p>
<p>In releasing the study, the WTO and OECD highlighted how the data could influence the world trade agenda. They argue, for example, that the impact of tariffs around the world can’t be fully understood without looking at value chains, since a final product may include import duties from several different stops.</p>
<p>Officials from the WTO and OECD plan to discuss their findings at a press conference on Wednesday. </p></blockquote>

<p>Trillion Dollar Coins, Fourteenth Amendment Powers, Executive Duties versus the Zanies on the Right who Want to Send us to Economic Purgatory: Krugman on the dysfunctional politics of the US economy</p>
<p>Paul Krugman appeared on <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/bill_moyers">Bill Moyers</a> PBS program Sunday night, talking sanely and rationally about the economy and why jobs (should) come first&#8211;and along the way noting how politics now dominates what and how we can talk about economic policies.  See Moyers &#038; Company, <a href="http://billmoyers.com/episode/full-show-paul-krugman-on-why-jobs-come-first/">Paul Krugman on Why Jobs Come First</a> (Jan. 11, 2013).  </p>
<p>(While you are at the site, also watch Moyers&#8217; essay, <a href="http://billmoyers.com/segment/bill-moyers-essay-the-crony-capitalist-blowout/">The Crony Capitalist Blowout</a>, about the goodies that corporations got out of the fiscal cliff deal, which included everything from immediate expensing to the active financing exception and the R&#038;D credit&#8211;all subsidies for big corporations that spent lots of lobbying power ensuring they would get them).</p>
<p>We have all kinds of reasons to know that the US is not Greece and will not be like Greece&#8211;we are a powerful economy, we have our own currency, and our debt is widely respected.  Nonetheless, the right-wing radicals want to destroy the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Deal">New  Deal</a> programs&#8211;Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, and they are willing to take the entire economy hostage to try to get their way.  Just look at Pat Toomey in the clip Moyers shows on the show, threatening to put the US government into default unless the majority in Congress accedes to the will of the wacky minority.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>That wacky minority hopes to use brinksmanship games around the debt ceiling to force progressives to yield on their dream target&#8211;decimating the New Deal. </p>
<p>The radicals on the right don&#8217;t really care about the debt ceiling&#8211;look at the way they willingly raised it throughout the Bush administration, even while viciously cutting taxes for the wealthy and creating huge deficits out of the surplus existing when Bush took office!  They don&#8217;t really care about deficits.  Look at the way they viciously cut taxes for the wealthy and spent on military budgets and preemptive wars when Bush was in office! </p>
<p>What they want is a radical restructuring of the economy in a way that will maintain and further the new gilded age, where bankers and private equity titans get rich off the labor of ordinary folk and ordinary folk find themselves eeking out a living at more or less the same rate they were before the Bush decades.  The top 1%, as Moyers pointed out, have seen a 275% increase in incomes over the last decade (due in large part to the Bush tax cuts, but also to the misappropriation of productivity gains by the rich).  Meanwhile, average American workers have seen their wages barely increase by $1.23 an hour&#8230;..not even keeping up with inflation.</p>
<p>Obama has said he will not negotiate on the debt ceiling.  He must hold firm.  There are various ways he can combat their &#8220;leverage&#8221;.  The obvious one is that it is unconstitutional for Congress to pass laws that require spending, pass laws that raise too little revenue to pay for that spending, and then refuse to permit the government to borrow to make up the difference that they have legislated into being.  That is irresponsible, and can be viewed as a violation of their constitutional obligation to ensure that the nation can pay for the debts it has already incurred.  See Taylor, <a href="http://www.salon.com/2013/01/13/top_dems_urge_obama_to_weigh_unilateral_debt_hike_2/">Top Dems Urge Obama to Weigh Unilater Debt Hike</a>, Salon.com (Jan. 13, 2013).  Obama is correct when he highlights this.  And surely as President, his power reaches to borrowing to fund the government that he is obligated by Congress to run under the laws he is obligated to implement.  He should make it clear that he is willing to risk impeachment to test that power rather than be held hostage by their petty, selfish games.</p>
<p>What about the &#8220;trillion dollar platinum coin&#8221; idea?  This is the law that grants the executive the right to mint platinum coins of any denomination.  Why not mint a few that add up to a trillion, and then pay it to the Fed and draw cash from the Fed based on that coin, to pay our bills?  That is perfectly legal&#8211;Congress did not limit the use of the coins in the legislation authorizing them.  If Congress can play brinksmanship games by threatening to put the US in default and destroy our economy unless the majority enacts the pet legislation of the minority to destroy the Social Security, Medicaid, and Medicare safety net programs, then the Executive should be willing to use every tool at his disposal to prevent that.  Of course, Treasury today said it wouldn&#8217;t do that.  See Anne Lowrey, Treasury <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/13/us/politics/treasury-will-not-mint-1-trillion-coin-to-raise-debt-ceiling.html">Won&#8217;t Mint Coin to Defy Debt Ceiling</a>, New York Times (Jan. 12, 2013).   Stupid of them to do so, since it is clearly within the law.  Obama cannot &#8220;wimp out&#8221; on this debt ceiling issue (to use Krugman&#8217;s term):  if he lets the  zanies in the GOP use these tactics to force changes in the safety net programs, he will have destroyed the Democratic party and the recovery from the Grand Recession in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>Remember, the analogy of US government debt to household debt is a silly one, just as is the analogy to Greece.  The government is not a family; our income is not the fixed wages of a head of household; our debt may feel staggeringly large for ordinary people to comprehend, but it is not too large a share of our GDP and our cost-of-funds right now is incredibly low.  We should borrow while the borrowing is good, to pay for the vital infrastructure repairs that need to be made and to ensure that we do not default on a key obligation to our people&#8211;the provision of a decent standard of living through measures that encourage job creation (by creating demand) and provide security against job loss and the vulnerabilities of old age and sickness.</p>
<p>The <i>Peterson Institute</i> is spending half a billion dollars to distort the public&#8217;s understanding of debt and deficits, in order to convince Americans that we should run the government like they run their households, in terms of amount of debt.  But Peterson is a right-wing billionaire whose views are antiquated and wrong for the time.  Keynes is the only one who has had it right, and we should listen to Keynes, not Friedman&#8217;s brute capitalism theories of a &#8220;free&#8221; market in which the wealthy control the assets and confiscate the rewards, not Peterson&#8217;s cacophonous sounds about debt. </p>
<p>Look again at Moyers&#8217; program.  He runs a tape where Lloyd Blankfein&#8211;head of Goldman Sachs, filthy rich, and one of the culprits of the financialization of the economy and the speculation that threw us into the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late-2000s_recession">Great Recession</a>&#8211;talks about how ordinary people will have to give up on their expectations from Social Security and Medicare.  Entitlements, he says, just can&#8217;t deliver what people want&#8211;we can&#8217;t afford it.  This from a guy who has socked away millions garnered from the everyday lives of ordinary people.  This from a person who has ridden the easy street rail line of subsidized profits for his banking firm (cost-of-funds extraordinarily low due to the government bailout; and subsidies in the code both internationally (active financing exception) and at home (the tax treatment of derivatives has been extraordinarily kind to banks in terms of sourcing and therefore taxability), etc.  This from a person who has enjoyed a priviledged preferential rate of taxation on much of his income, lobbied for through the revolving door of Treasury officials and banksters and their attorneys.</p>
<p>No, Obama shouldn&#8217;t listen to the Blankfeins of the world, or the Norquists, or the Toomeys.  He should turn a deaf ear to Mitch McConnell and to Rand Paul and all of those who insist that we have to keep funding the military-industrial oligarchy but that we can&#8217;t afford to keep funding the earned benefit programs that have made the difference between an intolerable standard of living and a decent standard of living for millions of Americans.</p>

<div dir="ltr">Today, in another step forward, the National Review <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/337681/averting-default-achieving-restraint-editors?pg=1#">calls on Republicans to take the threat of default off the table</a>:</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">Republicans should recognize that the prospect of default is the Democrats’ chief weapon in their campaign of avoidance. That prospect is not a source of Republican leverage in the debt-ceiling fight; it is the primary source of the Democrats’ leverage. It is a way to distract the press and the public from the reality of our fiscal crisis.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">The Democrats’ strategy offers Republicans an opportunity. Since the Democrats insist that the prospect of default is the reason they will not negotiate about spending restraint, Republicans should begin the debt-ceiling fight by permanently eliminating that prospect, turning the debt-ceiling debate into an argument about future spending rather than past borrowing.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">The House should pass a bill to redefine the debt limit so that it constrains primary spending but not debt service. Under this reform, a Treasury that had hit the statutory borrowing limit could continue to borrow what it needed exclusively for paying interest on the national debt and to roll over existing debt obligations, but it could not borrow for any other government spending until the limit had been increased. This would take default entirely off the table.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">The policy suggestion here is a bit puzzling: As one Dem joked to me, is the idea that the GOP will only continue to threaten to prevent Congress from paying out things like Social Security and veterans’ benefits, but not interest payments? That aside, the core point here is that National Review is admitting that the threat of default gives the leverage not to Republicans, but to Democrats.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">&#8212; <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2013/01/15/the-morning-plum-conservatives-surrendering-in-debt-ceiling-fight/">The Morning Plum: Conservatives surrendering in debt ceiling fight?</a>, Greg Sargent, Washington Post, this morning</div>
<p>Ah. It’s official: The National Review’s editors do not depend on Social Security and Medicare to survive or keep them from bankruptcy.  Nor do they have an elderly parent in a nursing home who, since exhausting his or her financial reserves, remain cared for there by dint of Medicaid. Which is nice for them.</p>
<p>And most of them live in the Northeast, not in Arizona, California, New Mexico, or Texas, so, much as they hate illegal immigration from Mexico, it doesn’t really impact their lives.  Their homes, unlike the Arizona ranchers who elect the state legislators who enact harsh anti-illegal-immigrant laws, their own property, including their winter homes, are probably secured by private guards.</p>
<p>But they probably do fly.  Maybe in their employer’s or their friends’ corporate jets rather than in commercial airliners.  But fly, nonetheless.  They also probably eat produce, poultry, meat and dairy products inspected by&#8211;OMG&#8211;a federal agency; specifically, the Department of Agriculture.  </p>
<p>So it didn’t occur to them that, by publishing that editorial in which they acknowledge that the Republicans are losing the PR fight on the debt ceiling, and in which they advised the Republicans nonetheless to issue a revised ransom note removing only bond interest payments and already-incurred contractual debts as hostages and leaving the rest with guns to their heads&#8211;<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/dana-milbank-president-congeniality-talks-tough/2013/01/14/6f5b50a0-5e9d-11e2-90a0-73c8343c6d61_print.html">sorry, Dana Milbank</a>, but that analogy is appropriate even after Sandy Hook, and is utterly irrelevant to Sandy Hook (what a weird claim by Milbank in <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2013/01/what-dana-milbanks-stunningly-awful.html">a thoroughly off-kilter op-ed</a>)&#8211;they’re effectively urging the Repubs to commit political suicide.</p>
<p>I say, go for it, Repubs!  Go for it. </p>
