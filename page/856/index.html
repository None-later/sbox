                                                                    </div>

                                <p><a href="http://www.econbrowser.com/archives/2007/05/new_job_creatio.html">James Hamilton</a> wasn’t happy with the report that employment per the payroll survey showed weak job growth.  Dr. Hamilton notes the negative employment growth per the household survey plus another way of measuring employment growth:</p>
<blockquote><p>The ADP estimate is based on actual payroll data, not a survey, and covers twice as many individual businesses as the BLS. When you add in the public employees (64 + 25 = 89), ADP called the nonfarm payroll number essentially spot on this month two days before we heard from BLS.</p></blockquote>
<p>Earlier this year, he advocated <a href="http://www.econbrowser.com/archives/2007/01/combining_forec.html">combining forecasts</a> and yesterday he gives an example:</p>
<blockquote><p>For April that calculation comes to</p>
<p>(0.8) x (88) + (0.1) x (89) + (0.1) x (-468) = 32,500 new jobs.</p>
<p>With 25,000 of those jobs coming from the government, I&#8217;m thinking we could have had essentially zero net job creation from the private sector in April.</p></blockquote>
<p>If one changes the weight for the payroll survey to 60% with 20% weights for the other two series, overall employment growth would have been estimated to be negative 23,000.  Not that one would have any reason to prefer one weighting over another – but notice when the household survey and the other two series give such divergent signals, the weighting matters.  At least, we don’t have Treas. Sec. Snow’s method – report whichever series gives the highest employment growth figure and declare that series to be the most reliable for at least the current month.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>As reported in the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/04/AR2007050401214_2.html">WashingtonPost</a>, scientists have calculated the cost of stabilizing greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p>The price tag for this exogenous variable just went up: $100 for every ton of CO2 dumped into the atmosphere, not exactly chump change.</p>
<blockquote><p>The most ambitious option, aimed at stabilizing the level of greenhouse gases from fossil fuels by 2030, would require measures that would add $100 to the costs associated with each ton of carbon dioxide pumped into the atmosphere.</p></blockquote>
<p>And this is the price tag just to avoid the worst effects of global warming!</p>
<p>Of course, the U.S. and China, now #1 and #2—or is it #2 and #1—in emissions vehemently objected to the report.</p>
<p>China literally has bet the farm on its industrialization plans, as I pointed out in a prior thread: “China: Now to 2100”. And China is not about to call in its bets. Nor is the U.S. about to risk that kind of inflationary pressure. What would the Fed do? It is worried about wages being inflationary; now this?</p>
<p>You know, I have a hard time getting my head around what is going to happen. Clearly, we are quickly, more quickly than people would have guessed two years ago, approaching a crisis. We are going to have to make a choice, roll the dice, take a chance, hedge our bets…whatever.</p>
<p>Two years ago, everyone was fat and happy. Global warming was potentially a problem in 2100; even then, we would not see the seas rise that much. Plenty of time. Yet, every time we turn around, the situation seems worse.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is just that collectively we are beginning to grasp the full range of the effects of global warming: species extinction, droughts, storms, sea rise, glacial water sources disappearing, desertification…. Or maybe it’s that global warming is appearing sooner and faster than we thought, that indeed it is worse….</p>
<p>I keep thinking about Tyler Cowen’s remark at the at <a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2006/05/my_views_on_glo.html">the Marginal Revolution</a>:<br />
<blockquote>I have yet to see a real plan which recognizes three points: a) without continued economic growth the world will probably fall apart, b) the problem is real and significant, c) any good preventive solution would require an enormous amount of concerted action across both time and across nations.</p></blockquote>
<p>While Tyler was comforted with the thought that global warming was sufficiently distant as to not be a problem, I think, nonetheless, he has expressed our present dilemma perfectly: Will the world fall apart without continued growth? Certainly, a carbon tax of that dimension would put a serious crimp in growth. Even then, it might not be enough. Secondly, does the world have to will to act collectively, especially when the two largest offenders are dragging their feet. And finally, is there enough time?</p>
<p>Remember when you worried about 2100. Well, now you have to worry about 2035. We seem to be running out of time.</p>
<p><i>Suggestion for those who are interested in following global warming news</i>: Do a Google alert entitled: Effects Global Warming. In the past six months, country after country is starting to evaluate the future and present effects in its own backyard. Devastating future effects occur well before 2050. Present effects are already evident.</p>

                                <p>Is it true that U.S. companies in China receive a tax rebate if they export?</p>
<p>In the <a href="http://www.theconservativevoice.com/article/24792.html">Conservative Voice</a>, I came across this peculiar twist with the added consequence:<br />
<blockquote>It&#8217;s no wonder that DaimlerChrysler will soon start building cars in China to ship back and sell in the U.S. under Chrysler names such as Dodge and Jeep. This decision means that 11,000 manufacturing jobs and 2,000 white-collar jobs will be eliminated over the next 24 months.</p>
<p>The SUV assembly plant in Newark, Delaware will be closed. The Warren, Michigan truck plant and the St. Louis County, Missouri assembly plants will each lose one of two shifts.</p>
<p>The combination of avoiding U.S. corporate taxes and having Chinese taxes rebated (forgiven) will help DaimlerChrysler to sell new cars in the United States much cheaper than any it can manufacture in Detroit. </p></blockquote>
<p>The rebate tax in combination with VAT is dynamite.</p>
<p>After doing a little research, I found that apparently the rebate mechanism has been alive and well in China for some time as a way of driving their exports.</p>
<p>Damn. This beats transfer pricing anyday!</p>
<p>Ok, where is the WTO in all of this? Well, exactly neutral. As long as all companies within China have the same playing field, everything is hunky-dory. </p>
<p>For a more technical discussion of how the rebate works in conjunction with China&#8217;s VAT, see <a href="http://www.globalsources.com/TNTLIST/2005/0805/DZRA_TAXREBATEMAIN.HTM">here</a>.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Its Friday afternoon/early evening depending on where you are, which means the administration releases something embarrassing its been sitting in for most of the week. This week, its <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070504/ap_on_go_ca_st_pe/battlefield_ethics_12">this</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>WASHINGTON &#8211; In a survey of U.S. troops in combat in Iraq, less than half of Marines and a little more than half of Army soldiers said they would report a member of their unit for killing or wounding an innocent civilian. </p>
<p>More than 40 percent support the idea of torture in some cases, and 10 percent reported personally abusing Iraqi civilians, the Pentagon said Friday in what it called its first ethics study of troops at the war front. Units exposed to the most combat were chosen for the study, officials said.</p></blockquote>
<p>three dots</p>
<blockquote><p>Findings included:</p>
<p>_Sixty-two percent of soldiers and 66 percent of Marines said that they knew someone seriously injured or killed, or that a member of their team had become a casualty.</p>
<p>_The 2006 adjusted rate of suicides per 100,000 soldiers was 17.3 soldiers, lower than the 19.9 rate reported in 2005.</p>
<p>_Only 47 percent of the soldiers and 38 percent of Marines said noncombatants should be treated with dignity and respect.</p>
<p>_About a third of troops said they had insulted or cursed at civilians in their presence.</p>
<p>_About 10 percent of soldiers and Marines reported mistreating civilians or damaging property when it was not necessary. Mistreatment includes hitting or kicking a civilian.</p>
<p>_Forty-four percent of Marines and 41 percent of soldiers said torture should be allowed to save the life of a soldier or Marine.</p>
<p>_Thirty-nine percent of Marines and 36 percent of soldiers said torture should be allowed to gather important information from insurgents. </p></blockquote>
<p>Now, this is a Pentagon study, and it found that &#8220;10 percent reported personally abusing Iraqi civilians.&#8221; And &#8220;[o]nly 47 percent of the soldiers and 38 percent of Marines said noncombatants should be treated with dignity and respect.&#8221; I&#8217;ve mentioned in previous posts&#8230; you can&#8217;t win hearts and minds like this. You simply cannot. </p>
<p>And then there&#8217;s this:</p>
<blockquote><p>The study team said shorter deployments or longer intervals between deployments would give soldiers and Marines a better chance &#8220;to reset mentally&#8221; before returning to combat. The Pentagon last month announced a policy that extends tours of duty for all active duty Army troops from a year to 15 months. Pollock acknowledged that was &#8220;going to be a stress&#8221; on troops. </p>
<p>Marine tours are seven months, one likely reason that soldier morale was lower than Marine morale, she said.</p></blockquote>
<p>We keep getting told that morale is fine, and will remain so as long as the Democrats don&#8217;t persist in trying to get GW to surrender in Iraq.  Why does the Pentagon hate the military?</p>
<p>By Monday, this report will never have happened.</p>

<p>As <a href="http://rodrik.typepad.com/dani_rodriks_weblog/2007/04/can_the_wrong_a.html">Dani Rodrik</a> and I were going Heckscher-Ohlin on <a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2007/04/does-free-trade-lower-prices.html">Greg Mankiw</a>, we skipped over Keynesian aspects of his post:</p>
<blockquote><p>Defenders of free trade rarely are in a position of having to defend exports, because people think that exports create jobs. When people complain about trade, it usually about the alleged job-destroying effect of imports.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Heckscher-Ohlin theory presumes we stay at full employment.  I started thinking about the Keynesian aspects as I read <a href="http://www.econbrowser.com/archives/2007/04/consumption_smo.html">James Hamilton</a> respond to some concerns from <a href="http://streetlightblog.blogspot.com/2007/04/gdp-growth-update.html">Kash</a> with respect to the advanced estimate of GDP growth in 2007QI. Kash writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>The thing that worries me the most is how personal consumption is now virtually the only thing keeping this economy going. But this may not be sustainable, given continued weak income growth and the end of the real-estate ATM that millions of individuals had used to bolster their consumption in recent years. If consumption growth starts to follow income growth, the US economy could be in for some serious trouble.</p></blockquote>
<p>Dr. Hamilton replies with:</p>
<blockquote><p>I do not see the fact that strong consumption growth alone was holding things up as being in and of itself alarming. If income growth is temporarily low, standard consumer theory suggests that consumption spending would continue on something close to its original trajectory, as consumers borrow to get past the temporary problems. Strong consumer confidence suggests that is how consumers currently see things. So, if you thought the other new negative contributions to 2007:Q1 growth (specifically the inventory drawdown and weak exports) were strictly temporary, this pattern might be exactly what you&#8217;d want and expect to be seeing. My view is the same as Calculated Risk</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://calculatedrisk.blogspot.com/2007/04/q1-2007-gdp-investment-and-recessions.html">CalculatedRisk</a> saw the modest increase in business investment as good news.  Compare this to what <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/04/at-least-consumption-demand-is-still.html">I wrote</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>So the only silver lining is that consumption demand is still growing at a 3.8% per year – at least for now. Yep – a further decline in national savings is keeping us of a recession. Not exactly the best news from a long-term growth perspective.</p></blockquote>
<p>While being bearish on investment demand, I also was worrying about the long-term implications of low savings – rather than joining in on all the Keynesian concerns about aggregate demand.  But Dr. Hamilton has a point about consumption smoothing – one should not draw inferences about the long-run direction of national savings from one quarter’s data.  But more on this later as we turn to the Keynesian aspects of the trade debate.  </p>
<p>Greg Mankiw is reminding us of what macroeconomists refer to as expenditure switching.  When we open our markets up to free trade – import demand displaces domestic aggregate demand, but when foreign governments open up their markets to free trade, export demand rises.  Angrybear readers likely wonder why I tend to dismiss these expenditure-switching concerns given the fact that I am a Keynesian.  As I have noted, I tend to put a lot of stock into the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/12/exchange-rates-and-savings-rate.html">Mundellian</a> proposition that floating exchange rates make expenditure switching aggregate demand neutral.  While this is the implicit assumption behind trade models such as the Heckscher-Ohlin model, others have argued we are in some form of a Bretton Woods II exchange rate regime.  </p>
<p>Let’s plot the export/GDP and import/GDP shares since 2000 as I confess that about three or four years ago, I would have said imports weren’t worrying me as much as the decline in the export share was.  The good news is that export demand growth has exceeded overall GDP growth.  Whether it is stronger economies abroad, dollar devaluation, or trade liberalization abroad- we are seeing at least a little progress on the export side.  Alas, import demand growth has also been strong.  Now the Mundellian in me wonders why the dollar devaluation has not been greater.  After all, the broad exchange rate index has devalued by only 21.4% from late March 2002 to late March 2007.  And the dollar has devalued by only 6.5% with respect to the Chinese yuan since June 2005 when China allowed limited adjustments of its exchange rate.  We have also plotted the ratio of exports to China and imports from China relative to U.S. GDP.  In percentage terms, our exports to China have increased by more than our imports from China have increased.  But as a share of GDP, our imports from China have grown from 1% to 2.4% of our GDP as our exports have grown from only 0.16% to 0.42%.  Despite (limited) dollar devaluation and foreign aggregate demand growth, our net exports represent a net drag to our aggregate demand growth.</p>
<p>But let’s also look at the ratios of gross savings and investment to GDP from 2000 to today.  While investment as a share of GDP is higher than it was during the first half of 2003, this is not exactly the supply-side miracle we here about in some circles.  But with a gross savings running near 10.5% of GDP, it is no wonder that the Federal Reserve maintains moderately high interest rates – which does crowd-out investment.  However, the real crowding-out comes in the form of net exports.  So I remain very concern about the lack of national savings.  If we could find someway of increasing national savings (hint – reverse George W. Bush’s fiscal irresponsibility), we might be able to enjoy the fruits of both lower interest rates and a weaker dollar.  In other words, we could have more investment demand and rising net exports – even as we move closer to free trade.  Alas, we are neither hearing much either from this President nor all those who wish to become President in 2009 about how they would move us closer to fiscal responsibility.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>There seems to be a persistent belief among conservatives that medical malpractice litigation is the reason healthcare is so expensive in the US. Presumably, costly litigation leads to costly insurance, which in turn does two things. One is that it causes doctors to perform a lot of un-necessary mumbo-jumbo but which is intended for CYA purposes. The other is that drives doctors out of the profession.</p>
<p>The National Center for State Courts provides data on <a href="http://www.ncsconline.org/D_Research/csp/CSP_Main_Page.html">incoming medical malpractice per 100,000 population in 2005</a> for twelve states (plus Puerto Rico) which they considered to be comparable. (All data used in the post is in the table toward the end.)</p>
<p>The Statistical Abstract of the United States contains data on <br /><a href="http://www.census.gov/statab/ranks/rank18.html">number of doctors per 100,000 population in 2003</a> for the twelve states (but not Puerto Rico).</p>
<p>We find a correlation in the neighborhood of 50% for all twelve states, and similar correlations when the sample is broken up into unified courts and general jurisdiction courts. Regular readers know I have no love for the legal profession, and though this is limited data, it really doesn&#8217;t seem more litigation results in fewer doctors. In fact, (and its tough to impute causality on such data), the best story I can tell is that there is more litigation when there are more doctors, which may well be consistent with the notion that in general, the medical malpractice suits that are filed have merit despite some severe outliers.</p>
<p>What about costs? The closest thing I was able to find on a state basis were the cost of an average hospital stay for 2003- from Table 162 of the hardcopy (sorry &#8211; I can&#8217;t find it online without having to pay for it) of the Statistical Abstract of the United States for 2006. </p>
<p>So how do those costs correlate with malpractice cases? In the three states with a unified court system, about 48%. In the nine without, about -36%. Including all twelve&#8230; -6%. Put another way&#8230; it really doesn&#8217;t seem like hospital costs are higher in states where there are more malpractice cases. They seem to be marginally lower.</p>
<p>One final thing we can do with the data&#8230; how do costs correlate with number of doctors? Again&#8230; results differ for unified courts and general jurisdiction court states, but including all twelve states results in a 38% correlation between costs and doctors. So either doctors are attracted to states in which costs are high (perhaps because doctor salaries are part of the costs), or costs tend to be higher when there are more doctors (perhaps because more doctors means more specialists). </p>
<p>In any case, what the data doesn&#8217;t seem to show is any evidence supporting the conservative position that the cost of healthcare is high because of litigation. </p>

<p>The latest from the <a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Nonfarm payroll employment edged up (+88,000) in April, and the unemployment rate was essentially unchanged at 4.5 percent, the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the U.S. Department of Labor reported today.  Job gains continued in several service-providing industries, including health care and food services, while employment declined in retail trade and manufacturing.</p></blockquote>
<p>Edged up must be a euphemism for weak employment growth with respect to the payroll survey.  The news looks worse if one looks at the household survey:</p>
<blockquote><p>In April, total employment and the employment-population ratio fell to 145.8 million and 63.0 percent, respectively.  The civilian labor force also fell over the month, to 152.6 million, and the labor force participation rate declined to 66.0 percent.</p></blockquote>
<p>The fall in the household survey reporting of employment was 468,000.  The unemployment rate would have risen even more had it not been for the fall in the labor force participation rate (LFP).  The decline in the employment to population ratio (EP) was disappointing.  Maybe it’s time that the Federal Reserve lower interest rates.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: The <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/infocus/economy">White House</a> tries to paint this report as goods news but it has to lie to people to do so:</p>
<blockquote><p>Today, The Bureau Of Labor Statistics Released New Jobs Figures – 88,000 Jobs Created In April.  Since August 2003, more than 7.8 million jobs have been created &#8230; The Economy Has Now Experienced Over Five Years Of Uninterrupted Growth, Averaging 3.0 Percent A Year Since 2001.</p></blockquote>
<p>It is true that employment rose by more 7.8 million since August 2003 but remember it fell from early 2001 to August 2003.  Over the past five years, employment has increased by a mere 4.1% or 0.8% per year on average.  Now as far as real GDP, it was 115.4 percent of its 2001 level but that means average growth since 2001 has been only 2.9% per year and this is following a year where real GDP grew by only 0.75%.  Neither real GDP growth nor employment growth has been strong over the past six years.  The White House knows this – but they hope you are too stupid to see through their lies.</p>

                                <p>Angry Bear and other economic blogs have recently had some posts on free trade&#8230; and whether there should be limits to free trade.  The typical example &#8211; if the other side imposes tariffs or doesn&#8217;t &#8220;play fair&#8221; &#8211; should we?  I personally haven&#8217;t made up my mind on that particular issue.  But I am against &#8220;free trade&#8221; if its just a way to facilitate the imposition of externalities on third parties.  (E.g., if a company moves to Mexico for no other reason than that Mexico has more lax pollution standards.)  </p>
<p>To all of that, the folks at Naked Capitalism have a post that throws </p>
<p><a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2007/05/estimating-gains-and-losses-from-free.html">loss aversion</a> into the mix:</p>
<blockquote><p>Even in games involving small amounts of money, researchers have found that most participants exhibit loss aversion: they don&#8217;t like to participate in games where they might lose everything they have, or worse, wind up with a loss, even if the <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2007/05/costly-trade-with-china.html">odds are stacked in their favor</a>. While that might be irrational when small amounts are involved, it isn&#8217;t crazy at all if you are talking about sums that are significant relative to one&#8217;s financial health.</p>
<p>So in other words, the average American would not take a bet that would give him a $10,000 gain if he might lose his job. Indeed, the lab examples tell us he&#8217;d need an expected gain of several multiples of his wages and benefits to willingly take that bet.</p>
<p>But per above, that is the tradeoff that economists tell us that more open trade is creating. That&#8217;s why people who are exposed to the real possibility of job loss are so skeptical of free trade. And as outsourcing makes people who were heretofore protected, like lawyers and bankers, also vulnerable, expect the resistance to become more broad based.</p></blockquote>
<p>Throw in the fact that the winners and the losers are often different people, and regionally concentrated, and the whole fear factor becomes self-reinforcing and rational.</p>
<p>That said, I would note&#8230;  I think Americans were almost unanimously in favor of free trade from the end of WW2 to about the 1970s.  It probably had something to do with the fact that it was the US beating the pants off everyone else, and it was foreigners losing their jobs.</p>

                                <p>Hoisted from comments, Bruce Webb writes&#8230;</p>
<p>The Economic Right as represented by Sowell are getting desperate and as such are petulently lashing out.</p>
<p>The key to understanding their thinking is that they don&#8217;t see inequality as something to be resisted. In their ideology cream rises to the top while the markets allocate returns on productivity effeciently. It is not quite as brash as 19th Century Vulgar Darwinism but has the same result. There has always been a stream of thought that sees extreme inequality as validation that an unfettered economy will reward merit with riches. It is a self reinforcing system for those inside the walls.</p>
<p>However it is a difficult program to sell in a fully democratic system. People will vote in their own self-interest, or at least group interest, and nothing in Right thought supports the notion that in doing so voters are doing anything wrong.</p>
<p>The only way to implement the entire Economic Right agenda was some combination of Republican Unitary Executive and Republican Permanent Majority. Only then could you push through the Private Accounts, HSAs, Education Savings Accounts, Flat Tax, elimination of Corporate Taxs, elimination of the Estate Tax, elimination of capital gains taxes on investments, all of which share a common characteristic, they all benefit a minority of the population and overwhelmingly an overlapping minority.</p>
<p>Remember it was only a little over three years ago that the Republican Party was riding triumphant, they had bagged Saddam, gerrymandered Texas and had a whole series of vulnerable Senate seats to grab. All it would take to secure power maybe forever but certainly long enough to push through their entire tax program was victory in Iraq.</p>
<p>I think this is what explains their persistant state of denial on Bush, Iraq and Social Security. It is not that they don&#8217;t see, it is that all of their dreams are going down the toilet with them and they are facing an extended time out of power and who knows what they will be faced with when they come back.</p>
<p>Because if you had to identify the Rights worst nightmare? Socialized Medicine that works. Like Social Security, Single Payer is not the optimal solution for every participant, but it works very well for the 43 million uninsured and pretty well for most of insured workers.</p>
<p>The Right spent the 21 years from 1983 to 2004 successfully draining electricity from the Third Rail of American Politics, now if and when they ever get back into power they will be faced with an invulnerable Social Security System but likely a new Third Rail in the form of Single Payer. If I was Sowell I would be staying away from sharp objects.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Many commentators&#8211;Kash <a href="http://streetlightblog.blogspot.com/2007/05/personal-income-and-spending.html">(Personal Income and Spending )</a> and Nouriel <a href="http://www.rgemonitor.com/blog/roubini/192394">(U.S. Consumers at the Tipping Point? Retail Sales Down in April for the First Time Since 2003</a>), for example&#8211;are worried that the U.S. consumer might be tiring. We have heard all the reasons—savings rating negative, weak labor income, MEW slowing.</p>
<p>Counter to this slow down, the stock market has done remarkably well. If the stock market is any indicator of the future, then certainly it should have picked up the signals that Kash and Nouriel have so well documented. In fact, silly hecklers often foolishly greet Nouriel’s predictions. I, for one, agree with Nouriel’s assessment: The last shoe to drop will be the consumer running barefoot through the park.</p>
<p>However, I would like to pose a question: Is the stock market missing the signals here? Or does the stock market know something both Kash and Nouriel are missing?</p>
<p>I think it is possible. In fact, I think it is entirely possible for the stock market to remain sturdy, for corporate profits to remain robust, and yet for the U.S. economy to enter a mild recession. I offer two observations. The first I have discussed in an earlier thread (China: Diversifying its Markets). The second is based on a <a href="http://www.mof.go.jp/jouhou/kokkin/tyousa/0602usatyousa_7.pdf">study </a>by the Japan’s Ministry of Finance, a study Divorced One brought to my attention. (Caution: In accessing this study, you may have to download a Japanese font filter of some size.)</p>
<p>To recap the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007_04_01_angrybear_archive.html">China’s Diversifying its Markets</a>: U.S. share of Chinese exports dropped from 31% in 2000 to24% last November to 22.7% this February. This fact certainly does support the idea that the American consumer is slowing; after all, what don’t we buy from China? Additionally, China’s exports to the European Union have increased; the euro is stronger.</p>
<p>In that piece, I asserted the following:<br />
<blockquote>A strong U.S. stock market, is reflective more of U.S. companies abroad than our own economic health.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Japan study I found fascinating, particularly chapter 3, “Prospect of Rate of Return Gap between USDIA and FDIUS.” In discussing USDIA (U.S. Direct Investment Abroad) and FDIUS (Foreign Direct Investment in the U.S.), the study backed out an amazing statistic:<br />
<blockquote>Total sales of foreign affiliates of U.S. companies exceed by 2.4 times the U.S. total exports. <br />This indicates that U.S. companies tend to choose to deliver goods through foreign affiliates to international markets rather than to export them from the U.S.</p></blockquote>
<p>Clearly, U.S. firms are choosing to use foreign affiliates that are beneficial for a number of reasons, not the least of which is cheap labor and tax breaks, i.e., developing countries. And, yes, China is included here.</p>
<p>Consider for a moment an article in Forbes, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/markets/2007/04/27/stocks-gdp-closer-markets-econ-cx_er_af_0427markets16.html">The World Is Wall Street&#8217;s Oyster</a>:<br />
<blockquote>The whole world can be found at the intersection of Wall and Broad streets in New York. While the American economy sputters, big U.S. companies are doing just fine as their multinational reach allows them to profit from stronger growth elsewhere.</p></blockquote>
<p>Peter Moricci knows where the action is and will be. In an email, he writes the following:<br />
<blockquote>Also, the trade deficit shifts the production of new and innovative products offshore, reducing high-value employment immediately and increasing the likelihood that next generation products will be developed as well as made abroad.</p></blockquote>
<p>Peter Moricci, by the way, was the former Chief Economist at the U.S. International Trade Commission.</p>
<p>The stock market is not missing any signals. It is well aware that the U.S. consumer is tiring. But other markets remain strong and our companies are well positioned to take advantage of this fact.</p>
<p>In case Krugman has not noticed, our companies left on an overseas flight to China; next stop, India; then on to Vietnam when the WTO says “ok.”</p>
<p>Yup, our trade deficit has nothing to do with corporate profits.</p>
<p>Next flight out: R&#038;D. It is going to an interesting slide, America.</p>
