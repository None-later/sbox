                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>This is a first post for me as a member of Angry Bear contributors. I have several posts full of pretty charts, ground breaking medical news that I believe will impact health care and environmental issues together, and more of course on WTO GATS, but decided to keep this simple and everyday. Up to this point cactus has corrected my html errors with grace and patience, but now I am responsible for the look. Score one for ownership. This one has no html quirks.</p>
<p>Mrs. Dan and I had to shop for a new stove. We did have one with a glass top but it cracked a few years ago, and tops carry limited warranty anyway. We looked for one of the old-fashioned kind with electric coils, and discovered that no matter where we went, big or small stores carried only ONE stove that had electric coils out of extensive inventories of glass topped stoves. Our lonely choice was half to a third the price of comparable stoves, but did not have the automatic setting to 350 degree F. with the on switch, and had a couple manual knobs instead of digital mechanisms.</p>
<p>The price of the model we bought was the same at two stores who carried our choice, one a national chain and the other local. We bought at the national chain because installation was &#8216;free&#8217; (true for us as immediate consumers), taking away the old stove was $10, as part of the sales tax free day in MA it was offered that day with a 15% sale price reduction plus 10% off as part of an advertised regular special, and then the common 5% savings from the uncollected state sales tax for that day. If this sounds like the Fed budget discussions, do not go there.<br />With the $190 savings Mrs. Dan bought a couch day bed for the office (which somehow cost more than $190, but I am a child of the 21st century, so it is to be expected). I was struck by the preponderance of gadgets at twice to three times the cost in the Gilded Age of kitchens. Granite counter tops are the rage.</p>
<p>Over the last two years, for $40,000, we had a new shingled roof (hired), renovated the laundry room, re-painted the downstairs walls in a striking bold color scheme, new kitchen floor (hired), re-finished old oak flooring, new forced water boiler, more insulation, and re-painted the outside of the house with new fascia boards and new screens for the porch. I have two sons and a daughter who spent time from far parts of the US to provide paid labor and expertise, but I am still able to paint 35&#8242; up a peak.</p>
<p>It did not dawned on me that this accomplishment could be unique to a degree and old-fashioned. Hands on is quite valuable if you can try and creates value other than buying the work, and the money lost from &#8216;work&#8217; as vacation (self-employed) for me is outweighed by the value of doing and connection. Adventure vacations are fun, but I think this marks many things for family values that no adventure vacation can touch.</p>
<p>Score one for ownership of work, family, and values. This old progressive is glad to join the fray.</p>

                                <p>Cuba doesn&#8217;t work.  Period, end of story.  Similarly, the old USSR.  Why?  Well, the economic system is untenable.  Motivations and constraints produce predictable human behavior (even if many people refuse to predict that behavior and prefer to assume that the outcomes will be different from what common sense would dictate).  But the opposite is also true &#8211; a system with no controls doesn&#8217;t work either.  We&#8217;ve had a few examples of libertarian gun toting paradise &#8211; most recently Somalia &#8211; and things just don&#8217;t work there either.</p>
<p>And within the narrow range of experience of American politics, its clear that one party <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/05/this-post-looks-at-disposable-income-by.html">is better at producing sustainable growth in income for individuals</a> than the other.</p>
<p>Which leads to a post by <a href="http://atrios.blogspot.com/2007_08_12_archive.html#2705621061922715471">Atrios</a> who links to this story by <a href="http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L12364166.htm">Reuters</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Years of economic policy mistakes after the fall of Saddam Hussein left unemployed young Iraqis easy targets for recruitment by al Qaeda and other insurgents, a U.S. Defense Department official said on Sunday.</p>
<p>Paul Brinkley, deputy under-secretary of defense for business transformation in Iraq, said Iraq&#8217;s shattered industrial base had to be revitalised to bring down unemployment levels of about 60 percent and help reconciliation.</p>
<p>He said political, social and economic stability would be much easier if factories, many left idle since the 2003 invasion to topple Saddam, could win even a small fraction of the trade the United States conducts every year with economies like China, India, Indonesia and Thailand.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we could just get some of that factored into Iraq we&#8217;d uplift the lives of every Iraqi and al Qaeda wouldn&#8217;t have any people to recruit,&#8221; Brinkley told Reuters in an interview.</p>
<p>Brinkley said early economic planners had made the understandable mistake of assuming that a free market would rapidly emerge to replace what he described as Saddam&#8217;s &#8220;kleptocracy&#8221;, and create full employment.</p>
<p>This mistaken assumption led to a series of decisions which &#8220;sowed the seeds of economic malaise and fuelled insurgent sympathies&#8221; after industrial production collapsed and imports flooded in to replace locally made goods.</p>
<p>The Coalition Provisional Authority, headed by American Paul Bremer, was set up by the western allies after the fall of Saddam and largely ran Iraq until June 2004 when an interim Iraqi government took over.</p>
<p>Brinkley said unemployment and under-employment of the proportions in Iraq would create unrest in any country. In a recent Military Review article he said Iraq&#8217;s unrelenting violence &#8220;is in no small part a result of economic distress&#8221;.</p></blockquote>
<p>Some of us have been saying for a while&#8230; the pie in the sky economic plans of this administration have contributed to the current mess in Iraq.  I think back to the first time I posted about Iraq&#8230; it wasn&#8217;t long ago &#8211; November &#8211; but <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/11/obligatory-post-on-iraq.html">here</a> is what I wrote at the time.</p>

<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>Dukes of Moral Hazard:</p>
<p>The markets are currently having a problem swallowing and digesting some of the pre-packaged “asset backed” mortgage bundles Wall St. has been manufacturing. Currently the “sub-prime” and “Alt-A” mortgages are having their risks “re-priced”. </p>
<p>&#8220;Re-Pricing Risk&#8221; means more expensive mortgages &#8212; and even if the buyers of these securities feel OK about the prime borrowers ability to pay &#8212; there is still the sticky issue of asset-deflation. The underlying collateral is falling in price. What was a nice tail-wind for this asset class is now going the other way. The more RE declines in value &#8212; the harder it will be to securitize, package and re-sell mortgages. High rates will have to be offered to attract buyers of the mortgage debt. Meanwhile &#8212; back at the ranch &#8212; a whole bunch of ARMs are resetting to a new higher number (way higher?) &#8212; that will create more sellers and further tilt the buyer-seller imbalance.</p>
<p>I believe that more than half (two-thirds?) of all mortgages are ultimately securitized – (CDO/MBS) meaning investors must be lined-up or the loans cannot be made. </p>
<p>So what happens to the remaining “good risks” who wish to buy homes? How much will concerns about RE prices (underlying collateral) damage the housing market and create a spiral of falling prices and hesitant mortgage issuers. At its peak residential RE was about 2x the 100-year average price (CPI adjusted [Schiller]). On top of that residential owners equity is way down (despite sharply rising prices) to about 50%. If RE corrects by half (essentially returning to “mean”) – aggregate owners equity might equal around zero. Equity withdrawals and re-fi loans may get quite scarce – with only bargain hunters with solid credit on the buy-side. </p>
<p>How will this play out? We already have a collapsing RE bubble – worse in some places than others – but compounding the asset bubble with mortgage difficulties may prevent markets from clearing. What happens when only “Prime” borrowers with nice down payments can get mortgages? What happens if ARMs ratchet up and people cannot re-fi? Ready for a Mortgage Strike in your town? How about Joe Consumer? What happens to our borrow-and-spend economy when people can’t do either?</p>
<p>Never mind the Stock Market.</p>

                                <p>When I listen to CNN discuss business and economics, I often realize that the Stupidest People on the Planet don’t all write for the National Review.   <a href="http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0708/11/cnnitm.01.html">Case in point</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>ROMANS: The American Society of Civil Engineers estimates $1.6 trillion to fix everything up, all our infrastructure problems, dams, roads, tunnels. We did a little bit of math, that&#8217;s about $5,000 for every man, woman and child in America. That is an awful lot of money. Politicians don&#8217;t win elections by saying; you&#8217;re not going to notice anything I&#8217;m going to do but it&#8217;s going to cost you a lot of money. </p>
<p>ASCHER: You know that estimate is a very big number, but it&#8217;s made up of lots of component pieces. I think if you look into it you&#8217;ll see some of the types of infrastructure that they&#8217;re gearing monies towards are really important to you and me every day. Other things are things that could be handled better by the private sector, they would be invested in better so I think you really want to get past the big number and start looking at the components. </p>
<p>VELSHI: That discussion, the private sector that has come up a few times, the idea of having private companies run roads and bridges and tunnels and things like that. How practical is that and where has it worked? </p>
<p>ASCHER: Well it has worked overseas, I mean if you look at places in Asia and Europe, I think in the UK about 15 percent of the roads and bridges have been privatized, they are toll brides, they are toll roads. I mean it certainly worked in Latin America. It&#8217;s worked in a number of places. It&#8217;s been the political environment that&#8217;s not here. The politics is so complicated nobody has been able to get it off the ground.</p></blockquote>
<p>While we often posted on this topic, it was <a href="http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/002282.html">Max Sawicky</a> who early on put it best:</p>
<blockquote><p>When a government takes a lump sum in exchange for permitting a private firm to manage a road and levy tolls, it is not only privatizing. It is borrowing, worsening its fiscal position. Most states are looking at growing budget shortfalls in the future, as Medicaid costs in particular continue to grow more rapidly than their revenues. The Gov could just as easily contract out operations and management, but keep the tolls for itself. The fact that the money is earmarked to new projects &#8211; investment &#8211; is irrelevant. It&#8217;s still borrowing. You could just as easily keep the roads and float a bond &#8211; also borrowing &#8211; for the new projects. The leasing is not necessary. The political onus against explicit borrowing can warp decisions.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let’s take a simple example.  Suppose a state government needs $2 billion in funds to fix its bridges.  Let’s suppose this state owns toll roads that generate $150 million in income per year.  The stupid people at CNN think the only way to raise the $2 billion is to sell the rights to the toll roads to a private firm.  Well, let’s assume that a private firm does purchase these rights for the next 75 years for $2 billion.  Not a bad deal given the fact that the internal rate of return is 7.5 percent.  If the cost of capital were only 5 percent, then the present value of these rights exceeds $2.9 billion.  So our private firm has made $900 million in present value by snookering the taxpayers of this state.  </p>
<p>But we need to fix the bridges now – right?  Yea – and the state could borrow the $2 billion paying $100 million in interest to the bank.  The state still keeps the income from the toll roads and end up better off than it would by selling the rights to the toll roads at a price below their present value.  </p>
<p>When we discussed the privatization of the Indiana toll roads, we had to endure the infestation of our comment box by a troll who seems to be Donald Luskin’s Mini-Me.  But even this troll recognized that the present value comparison was the appropriate framework.  This troll even provided some analysis that claimed the present value of the expected future toll income was less than the price received by the Indiana state government.  Never mind the fact that the assumptions used in this supposed analysis were entirely bogus.  Our troll trusted the analysis anyway.  </p>
<p>But the fools at CNN cannot even get the right conceptual framework.  When the supposed business reporters of a network are dumber than a Luskin Mini-Me, the network needs to fire these business reporters.</p>

                                <p>Reader Noni Mausa sends a link to <a href="http://www.alternet.org/workplace/57180/">this story</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The commercial media is telling us two perfectly contradictory stories about the American economy. The first is how wonderfully rich we are in the United States. The stock market&#8217;s booming &#8212; some analysts predict the Dow will break the 15,000 this year &#8212; the economy is expanding at a healthy clip, productivity growth is up and unemployment and inflation are relatively low.</p>
<p>But, at the same time, we&#8217;re also told that we don&#8217;t have the money to pay for a robust social safety net. When it comes to paying for universal health coverage, affording retirement security for our elderly, investing in programs for the poor or educating our children, we need to pinch pennies. According to this story line, we face a looming &#8220;entitlement crisis&#8221; &#8212; we won&#8217;t be able to afford to keep the Baby Boomers in good health and out of poverty, we&#8217;re told, unless we slash their benefits and privatize the programs that their elderly parents enjoy today</p></blockquote>
<p>There&#8217;s more in the article &#8211; its worth a read.  But it got me thinking about two old posts&#8230; one on <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/06/comparing-presidents-real-gdp-per.html">Real GDP per capita</a> and one on <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/05/real-median-income-by-presidential.html">real median income</a>.  Using data from those posts, I put together the following graph&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rr9aYEPDINI/AAAAAAAAAkY/TIo7Ml51YjE/s1600-h/real+gdp+per+capita+and+real+median+income.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rr9aYEPDINI/AAAAAAAAAkY/TIo7Ml51YjE/s320/real+gdp+per+capita+and+real+median+income.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Now, neither of these tow series accounts for debt, but basically, the one thing that we can see is that wherever it is increased wealth and productivity is going, its not going to the median worker, which is to say, its not going to at least 50% of the population.  In four of eight administrations starting with Ike, the median real income actually dropped.  Even when the real median income rose, even under Clinton and JFK/LBJ and Reagan, real median income never grew by much as the real GDP per capita.  </p>
<p>Conclusion &#8211; Paris Hilton is becoming more efficient and productive relative to the rest of us.</p>

                                <p>Some thought experiments about freedom&#8230;</p>
<p>1. Say there are only two countries in the world, Canada and the US. Canada is somewhat socialist-ish, the US is capitalist-ish. Canada allows its citizens to emigrate if they choose, but the US does not allow immigration or even Canadian visitors. Some percentage of Canadians would choose to move to the US if it were allowed, and some percentage would not leave regardless of the opportunity. What percentage falls into either group is unknown. In this case, who restricts the freedom of Canadians &#8211; the Canadian government, or the US government?</p>
<p>2. Consider case 1 again, and say that the US government also doesn&#8217;t allow its citizens to even visit Canada or trade with Canada. Presumably, the percentage of Canadians who would gladly move to the US if given a chance would rise with exposure to Americans. Does this increase the amount by which United States restricts the freedom of Canadians? It certainly seems to increase the restrictions the US places on its own citizens.</p>
<p>3. Consider case 2 again, but this time assume the two countries in the world are the US and Cuba. Cuba does not allow its citizens to visit the US or to leave Cuba. It does allow US citizens to visit Cuba. The US (mostly) doesn&#8217;t allow its citizens to visit Cuba or do business with Cuba, nor does it allow Cuban visitors to the US much less Cubans to immigrate into the US. Obviously, nobody would say the US is more restrictive than Cuba, but it does seem relevant to ask two questions:</p>
<blockquote><p>3a. How restrictive is the US relative to Cuba<br />3b. Is there some amount of the lack of freedom of Cubans that can be blamed on US policy? Consider &#8211; to get to the US, Cubans must not only beat safeguards put in place by Cuba but also safeguards put in place by the US.</p></blockquote>
<p>4. How does case 3 change if there are many countries with policies similar to the US, but only one Cuba?</p>

                                <p>Should I thank or curse our friend Mark Thoma for emailing me the latest lunacy from <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB118671020180093887.html?mod=opinion_main_commentaries">Donald Luskin</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Don&#8217;t hike the capital gains tax rate. Don&#8217;t lower it, either. Eliminate the capital gains tax entirely.  How can tax revenues be increased by eliminating a tax? It&#8217;s simple, when the tax in question is on capital gains. Capital itself exerts a multiplier effect that benefits the entire economy. Investment in new plant, equipment, business processes and whole companies creates new and higher paying jobs, and higher levels of economic activity, all of which generate additional tax revenues far in excess of what government would lose by foregoing cap-gains taxes.  This idea has broad theoretical support. Former Clinton Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers has written, &#8220;the elimination of capital income taxation would have very substantial economic effects&#8221; which &#8220;might raise steady-state output by as much as 18%.&#8221; Economist Jack L. Treynor has shown that &#8220;the level of taxation on capital that is &#8216;fairest&#8217; &#8211; i.e., most beneficial &#8211; to labor is zero.&#8221; And Nobel Prize-winning economist Robert E. Lucas, Jr., has concluded, &#8220;neither capital gains nor any of the income from capital should be taxed at all.&#8221; These economists think in terms of very complex models. But the real-world intuition here is quite straightforward … The cost of eliminating the barrier is foregone revenues from that particular tax. But those revenues are small, usually deferred and non-recurring. In their place, government receives large and recurring revenues from corporate taxes, sales taxes, wage taxes and dividend taxes &#8211; all generated by new economic activity.</p></blockquote>
<p>OK, this is rather stupid but we often hear this babble so I should thank Mark for the opportunity to address the claim that if we eliminate taxation on capital income, the direct impact on tax revenues will be small while the supply-side benefits will be large.  Luskin is following an Ann Coulter trick by cherry picking things certain economists may have said and then twisting their meanings.  The first <a href="http://www.dailyhowler.com/dh072202.shtml">Daily Howler</a> that I ever read involved Ann Coulter’s tendency to do the same:  </p>
<blockquote><p>Maslin has some fun with this footnote, but gives too much credence to others. “A great deal of research supports Ms. Coulter’s wisecracks,” she writes—apparently not understanding how much of this “research” has simply been made up by Coulter. Do reviewers ever fact-check books? If Maslin had checked the “780 footnotes” she approvingly cites, she might have seen &#8211; and she might have told readers &#8211; how much of this book is just false. </p></blockquote>
<p>I knew exactly what Bob Somerby was saying having endured this sort of behavior from those “economists” that <a href="http://www.house.gov/jec/fiscal/tx-grwth/estattax/estattax.htm">Jim Saxton</a> hires using our taxpayer funding.  </p>
<p>Before I start in on Luskin’s misunderstandings, let me suggest folks take a look at <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=226006">Simulating U.S. Tax Reform</a> written by our friend David Altig along with Alan Auerbach, Laurence Kotlikoff, Kent Smetters, and Jan Walliser.  It is a long paper, but this part of their abstract is all I need for now.</p>
<blockquote><p>This paper uses a new large-scale dynamic simulation model to compare the equity, efficiency, and macroeconomic effects of five alternative to the current U.S. federal income tax &#8230; It predicts major macroeconomic gains (including an 11 percent increase in long-run output) from replacing the federal tax system with a proportional consumption tax. Future middle- and upper-income classes gain from this policy, but initial older generations are hurt by the policy’s implicit capital levy. Poor members of current and future generations also lose.</p></blockquote>
<p>Altig et al. posed a fiscal neutral switch from income taxes to consumption taxes.  While there are a few second order differences, eliminating taxation on capital income and raising employment taxes in a fiscally neutral way would have similar effects.  </p>
<p>Let’s be clear about a few basics.  Altig et al. are using a long-run growth model that assumes full employment, which is similar to the Solow model.  So when Luskin talks about a “multiplier effect” aka the Keynesian aggregate demand model – he is already way off base.  When Lawrence Summers noted an 18 percent steady state effect or Altig et al. noted “an 11 percent increase in long-run output”, the dynamics of the model suggest that the increase in output in the first few years is tiny.  Steady-state effects will be approximated much later in the century.  </p>
<p>But Luskin paints the picture as if output jumps by a double-digit amount very quickly.  This assertion of course is absurd.  But it is key to the free lunch fallacy of the Laffer-Luskin crowd.  They want you to believe we can cut taxes on capital income without raising taxes on employment income.  But if we “give people their money back”, they will consume more and hence save and invest less.  Unless of course we slash government spending.  Ah but the Laffer-Luskin crowd never get around to admitting the need to have fiscal neutrality.  </p>
<p>Folks like Greg Mankiw are not so incredibly stupid.  Greg would admit that the need for fiscal neutrality.  But as Altig et al. model, cuts in taxation for owners of capital must be offset by increases in taxes for the rest of us.  And the rest of us still pay more in taxes under this new regime even during the steady state.  Folks like Greg might be smart enough to realize these distributional consequences but seem to be not so interested. </p>
<p>In the meantime, folks like Luskin babble their free lunch fallacies as they surround themselves with their own incredible ignorance of even basic economics.  And the Wall Street Journal op-ed page is still dumb enough to print this stupidity.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: I should also note that Altig et al. considered the impact of a </p>
<blockquote><p>progressive variant of the flat tax called the ‘X tax’.</p></blockquote>
<p>AB reader Ian alters us to a recent discussion of a progressive consumption tax by <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=872721">Sabine Jokisch and Laurence J. Kotlikoff</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The FairTax offers a potential alternative to this dismal economic future. The FairTax proposes to replace the federal payroll tax, personal income tax, corporate income tax, and estate tax (not modeled here) with a progressive consumption tax delivered in the form of a federal retail sales tax plus a rebate. According to our simulation model, these policy changes would almost double the U.S. capital stock by the end of the century and raise long-run real wages by 19 percent compared to the base case alternative.</p></blockquote>
<p>Note that their model also has the output gains only slowly being realized over time.  The authors note that there will be winners and losers, but this FairTax has different distributional implications from the proposal favored by Luskin.</p>
<p><strong>Update II</strong>: AB reader 2slug offers up <a href="http://papers.nber.org/papers/w12880">Taxing Capital: Not a Bad Idea After All</a> by Juan C. Conesa, Sagiri Kitao, and Dirk Krueger: </p>
<blockquote><p>In this paper we quantitatively characterize the optimal capital and labor income tax in an overlapping generations model with idiosyncratic, uninsurable income shocks, where households also differ permanently with respect to their ability to generate income. The welfare criterion we employ is ex-ante (before ability is realized) expected (with respect to uninsurable productivity shocks) utility of a newborn in a stationary equilibrium. Embedded in this welfare criterion is a concern of the policy maker for insurance against idiosyncratic shocks and redistribution among agents of different abilities. Such insurance and redistribution can be achieved by progressive labor income taxes or taxation of capital income, or both. The policy maker has then to trade off these concerns against the standard distortions these taxes generate for the labor supply and capital accumulation decision. We find that in our model the optimal capital income tax rate is significantly positive. The optimal (marginal and average) tax rate on capital is 36%, in conjunction with a progressive labor income tax code that is, to a first approximation, a flat tax of 23% with a deduction that corresponds to about $6,000 (relative to an average income of households in the model of $35,000). We argue that the high optimal capital income tax is mainly driven by the life cycle structure of the model whereas the optimal progressivity of the labor income tax is due to the insurance and redistribution role of the income tax system.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>One Salient Oversight sends me a link to a piece he wrote <a href="http://one-salient-oversight.blogspot.com/2005/08/perfect-storm-approaches-america.html">two years ago</a>.  I took the liberty of simply stealing most of it:</p>
<blockquote><p>America is about to be hit by a perfect economic storm. It &#8211; and the rest of the world &#8211; will be changed forever by it. The fact that the storm will hit is easier to prove than trying to work out when, but chances are that the wind and the waves are beginning to be felt.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong><br />
<blockquote>The first problem is that there is an unsustainable housing price boom in the US. Analysts have been complaining about this for more than a year now. The fact is that the boom in house prices in the US is outstripping any growth in the average wage &#8211; which essentially means that, at some point, the prices will have to fall. The growth in house prices has led to many homeowners to borrow against their equity, and to spend this money either improving their houses or to purchase consumer goods. The growth of US consumer demand since 2001 has essentially been driven by this process. But what happens when housing prices fall? Consumer demand will go into reverse, with people no longer borrowing against their dwindling equity, no longer improving their devalued houses, and no longer spending much. We&#8217;ll see unemployment and maybe even a technical recession. Yet if this were the only problem, then recovery would be easy. But this is a perfect storm, with many different problems converging into one.</p>
<p>The second problem is that the US is running an unsustainable current account deficit. In layman&#8217;s terms, this means that America is spending more money than it earns, and is making up the difference by using a credit card. Essentially it is the goodwill of international investors in propping up the US currency that has allowed the nation to remain so prosperous. Many have criticised these international investors, especially the central banks of China and Japan who keep their own currencies low to allow a trade advantage. While there is a grain of truth in this complaint, the US dollar is nevertheless the ultimate responsibility of America itself. As it stands, the dollar is overvalued, and, apart from money printing to devalue the currency, the only other solution to restore the balance of trade would be for the Federal Reserve Bank to raise interest rates and choke off demand. Given the precarious state of the housing market, such a move would undoubtedly plunge America into recession &#8211; the only difference is that the after-effects of such a recession would be less severe if the Fed were to act now to force a recession, rather than letting the situation run its natural course. If that occurred, the market would eventually turn against the US dollar and harshly devalue it. No country, nor even individual for that matter, can continue to prosper by relying upon borrowed money. Eventually it will have to be paid back. Better sooner than later.</p>
<p>The third problem is that the US government is running an unsustainable budget deficit. It is supremely ironic that the political party that preaches most about about fiscal responsibility &#8211; the Republican party &#8211; is the same party that has presided over some of the most damaging fiscal deficits and overspending in US history. And this goes back to Reagan. Supply side economics, which relies upon the mistaken and never-proven-in-practice idea that lowering tax rates will actually raise the amount of tax revenue, is still popular in political circles, mainly because it relies upon that wonderful political tactic of promising tax cuts and painting their opponents as lovers of taxation. It is a very clever political tactic &#8211; a pity it results in economic hardship. In order to bring the government back into fiscal balance, the US must choose between raising taxes, cutting spending, or a combination of both. No matter what the choice is, the natural result will be economic hardship. Nevertheless, it is better for the pain to be felt now rather than later &#8211; if fiscal irresponsibility continues, the end result will be far worse.</p>
<p>The fourth problem is that the US economy relies heavily upon cheap oil imports to run its economy. The problem with this is not so much geo-political, but geological. A growing chorus of experts has been warning for some time now that there is a natural limit to how much oil can be pumped out of underground reservoirs. Known as Peak Oil, such a situation will not lead to the world running out of oil, but will result in an ever-decreasing supply of oil as the years go by. The result of this will be ever increasing petrol prices, with a commensurate growth in inflationary pressure on other goods and services. The US, more than any other country, relies upon roads, freeways and motor cars for its economy to continue. Europe and Asia, by contrast, have sophisticated and integrated public-transport systems that will become increasingly cost-effective the further oil prices rise. In this area, the US has further to fall than other industrialised nations. Peak Oil is probably already hitting us now &#8211; have you wondered why oil prices are so high? It is because supply cannot keep up with demand.</p>
<p>It is this last point that has got me most concerned &#8211; the first three points together are bad enough, but it is the peaking of oil production that will be the real killer over the long term. I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;re looking at a recession here &#8211; we&#8217;re looking at a long term economic downturn, maybe the equivalent of an economic depression if some oil experts are to be believed.</p>
<p>One thing is for sure &#8211; while this perfect storm will hit America hard, it will have knock on effects for the rest of the world. We won&#8217;t survive unscathed.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>Josh Marshall says this was the alternative headline for <a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/016464.php">this post</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think it&#8217;s a measure of how brain dead the Republicans have become on the &#8220;war on terror&#8221; that their big puffing or policy statements on the issue now most often amount to bizarre and sometimes incomprehensible grammatical reformulations or, failing that, reorderings of sentence structure. So for example, now you have Mitt Romney saying, &#8220;There&#8217;s not a global war on terror. There&#8217;s a global war being waged by the terrorists and if I am president, there will be a global war waged on the terrorists and we will win.&#8221; This comes after Rudy&#8217;s insistence on rebranding the War on Terror as the &#8220;Terrorists&#8217; War on Us.&#8221; &#8230; Their perplexity and paralysis in the face of reality is making them look like one of those alien computers or robots at the end of one of the old Star Trek episodes where Capt. Kirk hits them with too much kick-ass logic and smoke starts to come out of their ears and then they explode.</p></blockquote>
<p>The title of his post was Global War on Verbs.  I find it this not only really funny but also quite telling for a simple reason.  RUDY has adopted the habit of word searching Democratic speeches on Iraq-istan (my term for how insists that the nations of Afghanistand and Iraq are the same issue as if Saddam Hussein equals Osama bin Laden) so that he can point out that we Democrats don’t use exactly the same words the GOP does.  And since we don’t talk like RUDY, we don’t care about battling terrorism.  After all, RUDY thinks we are all “losers” – a term my son used too much when he was three years old but outgrew by this fourth birthday.  Such has become the juvenile campaign of RUDY &#8211; with all due apologies to real children who are generally much smarter than these brain dead Republicans.</p>
