                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Readers here will know more about the US federal government income statement than I. However, given the near ubiquitous deficit hysteria, I wanted to illustrate the truth about the budget deficit. The truth is, that deficit hysteria has been set in motion by A surge in government spending on items like unemployment compensation, food stamps, and other types of &#8216;support payments to persons for whom no current service is rendered&#8217; AND low tax receipts. Yes, long-term reform is needed; but my general conclusion is that the deficit hysteria is sorely misplaced.</p>
<p>First things first, the fiscal deficit &#8211; receipts minus net outlays as a % of GDP &#8211; is big. In June 2011, the 12-month rolling sum of net receipts (the budget deficit) was roughly 8.5% of a rolling average of GDP. This is down from its 10.6% peak in February 2010, but the level of deficit spending clearly makes some nervous.</p>
<p>Why should they be nervous about the &#8216;level&#8217; of the deficit? I don&#8217;t know, since recent &#8216;excess&#8217; deficits are cyclically endogenous. The chart below illustrates the spending and tax receipt components of the US Treasury&#8217;s net borrowing (see Table 9 of the <a href="http://www.fms.treas.gov/mts/index.html">Monthly Treasury Statement</a>). Weak tax receipts and big spending are driving the federal deficits (spending, as we will see below, has surged on items directly related to the business cycle).</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-vieS9T9mgKA/Tjh8m4EUA8I/AAAAAAAAD24/pV57iha5Ekw/s1600/deficit_breakdown.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-vieS9T9mgKA/Tjh8m4EUA8I/AAAAAAAAD24/pV57iha5Ekw/s400/deficit_breakdown.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />READ MORE AFTER THE JUMP!<br /><a name="more"></a><br />In June, the 12-month rolling sum of tax receipts &#8211; mostly corporate and individual income taxes and social insurance and retirement receipts &#8211; was 15.6%, which is up from its 14.5% cyclical low in January 2010. On the spending side, net outlays in June 2010 were a large 24.2% of GDP and down just slightly from the 25.3% peak in February 2010.</p>
<p>Deficit hysteria should be more appropriately placed as &#8220;lack of jobs and tax receipts hysteria&#8221;. At this point, the budget could just as easily worsen as it could improve, given the fragile state of the US economy (see <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2011/08/forecast-update.html">Tim Duy&#8217;s recent post at Economist&#8217;s View</a>).</p>
<p>Why the wrong hysteria?</p>
<p>Reason 1. Taxes. Some would love to increase taxes &#8211; but the fact of the matter is, that tax receipts remain well below their long-term average of 18% of GDP. Tax receipts will not improve without new jobs since individual income taxes account for near 50% of total receipts.</p>
<p>Reason 2. The spending has been on cyclical items. </p>
<p>The best time to &#8216;worry&#8217; about government spending is NOT when the economy is barely moving.</p>
<p>The chart below illustrates the big ticket items of the monthly outlays &#8211; roughly 87% of total outlays. The broad spending components are listed in Table 9 of the <a href="http://www.fms.treas.gov/mts/mts0611.txt">Monthly Treasury Statement</a>. The long-term average shares of total spending are indicated in the legend.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-mLbWzh6wWqs/Tjh_5-VFDsI/AAAAAAAAD3A/y4iHx9lNusI/s1600/spending_bigticket.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-mLbWzh6wWqs/Tjh_5-VFDsI/AAAAAAAAD3A/y4iHx9lNusI/s400/spending_bigticket.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />The items health, medicare, and income security (inc security) are all above their respective long-term averages. But spending on income security outlays is the only spending component to have broken its trend, i.e., surge. According to the GAO&#8217;s budget glossary (<a href="http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d05734sp.pdf">link here, .pdf</a>), this item includes the following cyclical spending:<br />
<blockquote>Support payments (including associated administrative expenses) to persons for whom no current service is rendered. Includes retirement, disability, unemployment, welfare, and similar programs, except for Social Security and income security for veterans, which are in other functions. Also includes the Food Stamp, Special Milk, and Child Nutrition programs (whether the benefits are in cash or in kind); both federal and trust fund unemployment compensation and workers’ compensation; public assistance cash payments; benefits to the elderly and to coal miners; and low- and moderate-income housing benefits.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s spending on unemployment and food stamps that&#8217;s driving spending at the margin.</p>
<p>The same deal exists with the &#8216;smaller ticket items&#8217;. Of these <br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-uf1PT7gZamI/Tjh_900F3BI/AAAAAAAAD3I/vh5Khf_3tCM/s1600/spendins_smallerticket.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-uf1PT7gZamI/Tjh_900F3BI/AAAAAAAAD3I/vh5Khf_3tCM/s400/spendins_smallerticket.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>OK &#8211; so deficit hysteria is about, but it&#8217;s misplaced. One could argue for more, not less, spending to get the jobs growth, hence tax receipts, up.</p>

<div>In the comments to my post <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/08/reminder-from-obamas-february-2009.html">&#8220;A reminder from Obama&#8217;s February 2009 speech&#8221;</a>, there is the following:</div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><div>&#8220;I guess it relates to the fake Obama they had made up in their heads,&#8230;&#8221; </div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>This sums up the early comments to the post suggesting that those who trusted Obama have only themselves to blame.</div>
<div></div>
<div>I addressed that concept in <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2008/11/obama-is-he-or-isnt-he-real.html">Obama, is he or isn&#8217;t he real&#8230;?</a>  In that post I presented transcripts of Obama&#8217;s speeches and responses to questions and then argued:   </div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><div>&#8220;Are those talking like Glen Greenwald correct in that people should not be surprised with Obama&#8217;s appointments? Maybe, but then based on the above Obama words, that would mean we (you and I) just plain have to approach our relationship with governing as suspect until proven otherwise. Unfortunately, that means we will always be a day late and a dollar short having never known at the time of the decision if we made the correct one because you can not go by what is said.&#8221;</div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>I recommend people go and not only read the posting, but the comments.  (History is always fun to review.)</div>
<div></div>
<div>I concluded that posting with:</div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><div> &#8220;Do you know what happens to a person when they can never get a straight, no hidden agenda answer from one they count on? They go nuts.&#8221;</div>

<div>This all speaks to the issue of growing our economy, because to promote distrust in a developed economy where 77% of our capital is intangible (via 2005 World Bank study) is to be destroying the prime driver of our growth. I wrote about the issue of were our true wealth comes from a few times.  For this posting I am drawing on<a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2009/02/attention-republicansblue-dog.html"> Attention Republicans/Blue Dog Democrates: Tax cuts as stimulus work against your goal.</a></div>
<div>February 5, 2009.  </div>
<div></div>
<div>From the World Bank study:  </div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><div>“An economy with a very efficient judicial system, clear and enforceable property rights, and an effective and uncorrupt government will produce higher total wealth.”</div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>I concluded:</div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><div> &#8220;The republicans/blue dogs, and those helping them by lending their &#8220;professionalism&#8221;, think they are only effecting a political strategy. In truth, they are destroying the very basis for the wealth they desire. Their entire campaign for decades to discredit, to instill mistrust in the primary institution we have, the US (We the People) government, has been the primary cause to our economic decline. To increase the level of distrust is to decrease the available “intangible capital” which is 77% of our wealth generating power. &#8220;</div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>Which brings us to what we just experienced with the debt ceiling issue.  It&#8217;s not just the resulting budget changes, it&#8217;s the overall cognitive change being made in the people regarding trust of our ability to access a candidate and make the choice that will produce the desired results.  Clinton, as for the Dems made the first blow to our trust with &#8220;triangulation&#8221;.  I can and have on my own gone back and read speeches and answers to questions by Clinton during his first run and it shows the same as I note regarding Obama in &#8220;is he or isn&#8217;t he real&#8221;.  Obama is (knowingly or not) bringing our trust close to death.   </div>
<div>Even the debt ceiling event is only the latest in a string of recent events that all drive an additional spike into the coffin of &#8220;trust&#8221;.   </div>
<div></div>
<div>Last night on Racheal Maddow&#8217;s show, Chris Hayes, noted that we are now in a phase of governance where &#8220;created&#8221; crisis is the vehicle for results.  Yes, Shock Doctrine governance level II..  It was presented from the perspective that the conservative mind set is the one employing such a tactic.</div>

<div>  In my opinion, what he missed, and what makes this a unique form to this nation&#8217;s version of Naomie Klein&#8217;s  Shock Doctrine is that there are enough economically conservative minded people in the opposing party (democratic party in this case) that the ruse can be played out with a more believable presentation than if just one side is playing along.  Yes, both side play it differently, but would that not be expected based on the supposed &#8220;base party&#8221; paradigms?  At no time during any of these &#8220;crisis&#8221; did the primary players on the democratic side resist the crisis by calling it out.  Instead, they used it to get what the conservative faction of the party (a smaller faction since the last election) wants. These &#8220;wants&#8221; being very much inline with the republican non Norquist/Tea Party faction&#8217;s wants.  Commonly referenced as  Wall Street.  In the end, no one to blame&#8230;It was the crisis.  </div>
<div></div>
<div>This pattern has held true through out Obama&#8217;s current term.  In the latest example, the proposed budget from the house progressive caucus, the largest of the democratic party caucuses never was mentioned by the president.  Recall the single payer health insurance issue? </div>
<div></div>
<div>The issue for this posting is not the &#8220;wants&#8221;.  It is not about the resulting policy from the latest ruse played on We the People.  The prime issue, the issue always suggested, implied, bandied about, but never out and out confronted: Public Trust.   </div>
<div></div>
<div>This latest Obama/conservative policy process has brought us closer than ever to the demise of our economy and thus our democracy not primarily by the furthering of the financial disequilibrium, but by the perpetuation and enlarging of the perimeters of social order that will now be distrusted.  I think we have approached, if not completely included the full boundaries of American culture in that which is to be distrusted with the completion of this debt crisis event. </div>
<div></div>
<div>Sadly, I do not think Obama and those referred to as the &#8220;adults in the room&#8221; know what they have done.  Instead. as I stated above, they believe they are just &#8220;effecting a political strategy&#8221;. </div>
<div></div>
<div> </div>
<div>There are 2 versions of distrust.  First is the distrust nurtured by those who have made it a political tool of their strategy for political dominance, power and fortune.  It is the &#8220;&#8230;most dangerous words in the English language: I am from the government and I am here to help you&#8221;.  These people do not know that in essence their distrust is part of the ruse.  The other distrust is those who see the ruse, have acted via those they trusted only to find they can no longer be trusted.  I don&#8217;t believe one is worse than the other, but I do know having both means the solution will be slower in materializing.  In both cases those in power can not be trusted and those who know it, presently have no one in power to represent their solutions.  It serves to make the what is the solution clear, it does not server to make it any easier or quicker in coming. </div>
<div></div>
<div> </div>
<div>I do not believe this mode of operation is forever simply because we are not naturally selfish, self serving for survival sake creatures. We are not naturally so shallow in our collective thinking.  It is only in our isolated, individual thought that we can and will be shallow.  Of course this assumes that the concepts and application of virtual reality throughout our daily lives does not mutate us way from our natural self.   A big assumption considering &#8220;reality&#8221; is in the phrase &#8220;virtual reality&#8221; and the character dynamic is trust.    </div>

                                <p>Today a host of global purchasing managers indices (PMIs) reiterated that the global economy is slowing&#8230;.quickly.</p>
<p>Within 24 hours, <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/china-official-pmi-slips-to-507-in-july-2011-07-31">China</a>, the <a href="http://www.ism.ws/ISMReport/MfgROB.cfm?navItemNumber=12942">US</a>, and the <a href="http://www.markiteconomics.com/MarkitFiles/Pages/ViewPressRelease.aspx?ID=8369">euro area</a> all reported July PMIs falling toward the feared 50 (below which the manufacturing industry is contracting) &#8211; 50.7, 50.9, and 50.4, respectively. The UK PMI fell below 50 to <a href="http://www.markiteconomics.com/MarkitFiles/Pages/ViewPressRelease.aspx?ID=8369">49.1 in July</a>.</p>
<p>I would posit (and I believe that others have, too, <a href="http://www.economonitor.com/edwardhugh/">like Edward Hugh</a>) that this is directly related to Fed policy, specifically that of quantitative easing (QE).</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-JNmHD3tiZuA/TjbZ29TmJTI/AAAAAAAAD2w/kqgH80cygTU/s1600/global_pmis_chart.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-JNmHD3tiZuA/TjbZ29TmJTI/AAAAAAAAD2w/kqgH80cygTU/s400/global_pmis_chart.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />READ MORE AFTER THE JUMP!<br /><a name="more"></a>The chart above illustrates the stated PMIs alongside the dates of a shift in the <a href="http://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/pomo/display/index.cfm">Federal Reserve&#8217;s QE policy</a>. The shorter bars indicate those dates when the Fed ended QE and announced that it would reinvest maturing proceeds. On the other hand, the full bars illustrate the outset of QE.</p>
<p>Falling PMIs correlate with the end of QE. New QE correlates with a rebound in global PMIs. Given this correlation and the <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/07/q2-us-gdp-report-just-terrible.html">latest GDP release</a>, I expect that talk of QE anew to surface.</p>

<p>In answer to the generic question regarding President Obama&#8217;s actions regarding the debt ceiling, I am re-posting this from 2/25/09.  In comments of the original I stated that cutting the deficit by 1/2 seemed to &#8220;optimistic&#8221; for me.<br />***************************</p>
<p>Ok, here are my basic issues with the substance of President Obama&#8217;s speech. First, may I remind everyone<br />that as of 11/08 I declared my divorce successful.  Has it become my mission accomplish moment?</p>
<p>I heard this:<br />
<blockquote>“And we will expand our commitment to charter schools. but as a father when I say that responsibility for our children&#8217;s education must begin at home.” </p></blockquote>
<p>And thought: 2 tier education system/vouchers, no thank you.  Education begins at home when home means one parent has the time to spend at home oppose to both working.</p>
<p>I heard this:<br />
<blockquote>“And we must also begin a conversation on how to do the same for Social Security, while creating tax-free universal savings accounts for all Americans.”</p></blockquote>
<p>And thought: Are you freak&#8217;n kidding me!  In this time of financial collapse we&#8217;re still going to talk about turning an insurance for the masses against the follies of finance into some form to include finance?  The entire reason we want to create jobs is because we have suddenly realized that the vast, vast majority do not earn their money from money.  Tax free?  Has he not heard of 401K, IRA and all it&#8217;s versions, HSA, higher education accounts?  Italy?</p>
<p>I heard this:<br />
<blockquote>“Yesterday, I held a fiscal summit where I pledged to cut the deficit in half by the end of my first term in office.”</p></blockquote>
<p>And thought: Yeah, how&#8217;d that work for the last administration who made such a declaration?  Did he have to say “in half”?  Has his advisors not taught him about the blip during the FDR recovery?  Only one way I can think of doing this: Raise taxes where the money is and whack the defense budget in half and I mean take a swipe at all moneys related to security.  Are we really $1 trillion dollars worth of paranoid?</p>

<p>UPDATE: I was correct about Mr. Papa&#8217;s likely reaction being more moderate, but he&#8217;s <a href="http://rudepundit.blogspot.com/2011/08/random-observations-regarding-debt-deal.html">more lucid that Ezra</a> (or <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/post/memo-to-congress-with-deficit-deal-done-time-for-that-pivot-to-jobs/2011/03/03/gIQA4HeanI_blog.html">Greg Sargent</a>) has been so far today.  Of course, &#8220;more lucid than people employed by the Washington Post who are not Michael Dirda&#8221; is not something that attracts readers, so I&#8217;ll just say: <a href="http://rudepundit.blogspot.com/2011/08/random-observations-regarding-debt-deal.html">go read</a>.  And then program &#8220;Bachmann-Perry Overdrive&#8221; into your Word Macros, since it will be Very Useful.</p>
<p>Barack Obama has a private talk with his daughters, in which he explains that Mitch McConnell made some demands, but he Nobly and Gloriously Reached a Compromise. He explains the deal to his daughters and how he Really Worked in Their Best Interests.</p>
<p>Those who have read their Bibles are referred to the first half of Genesis 19.  Those who don&#8217;t want to think about it are referred to Buce, who is (as with Mark Thoma and Brad DeLong) <a href="http://underbelly-buce.blogspot.com/2011/07/great-moments-in-history-of-political.html">nicer than I am</a>.</p>
<p>Side note: Anyone who thinks Ezra Klein is anything but a tool of Fred Hiatt is referred to his <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein">multiple cheerings</a> of a deal that cuts growth  (h/t lauren in comments at Mark Thoma&#8217;s place, who is apparently <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/07/29/aptiquant_iq_survey/">an Internet Explorer user</a>).</p>

                                <p>Mark Thoma, who supported (and probably voted for) the man during the primaries, is du<a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2011/07/sanctioning-blackmail.html">much more gracious than I am</a>:<br />
<blockquote>A vague promise from Democrats about the future is all but worthless right now, we&#8217;ve had too many promises broken already. Obama&#8217;s promises in particular mean nothing.</p></blockquote>
<p>The nicest thing I can do is describe this as BarryO&#8217;s &#8220;Only Nixon could go to China moment.&#8221;  But that&#8217;s because that slimy cocksucker was willing to sell out two countries—Formosa and Tibet—so he could discuss panda sex with Margaret Trudeau.</p>
<p>Obama&#8217;s version is selling out Democrats and Middle-Class and Aspiring Middle-Class Americans. When the best hope is that Stan Collender is right <a href="http://capitalgainsandgames.com/blog/stan-collender/2334/debt-ceiling-deal-may-be-serious-trouble-house">that bending over and sucking off isn&#8217;t going to be good enough for House Republicans</a>, it&#8217;s time for all you idiots who said no one should run against BarryO &#8220;from the left&#8221; to do the honorable thing and find your wakizashi and prepare four cups of sake. (I&#8217;m certain there will be plenty of kaishkunin volunteers to aid you in Doing the Right Thing.)</p>
<p>Democrats may still run someone against Obama from the left, though Timothy McVeigh is unavailable. But the attempt to destroy their political viability has been executed perfectly.  Glad BarryO &#8220;plays eleven-dimensional chess&#8221; now?

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Hey remember me? Just a quick driveby to start some discussion.</p>
<p>Classical, neo-classical, and neo-liberal economics all share a common mistaken psychological premise, one that is simple but deep, and in itself explains why they don&#8217;t understand the aims of Progressive Taxation.</p>
<p>Label it how you like, the academic discipline that emerged from England in the 18th and 19th century implicitly, hell I&#8217;ll make it stronger, explicitly assumed that the goal of capitalism is accumulation, i.e. getting more an more numbers on the right side of the ledger sheet. Which assumption seems blindingly obvious, which is why it is simple and goes so deep. In this model taxation on gains from capital serve to displace investment on the equally simple assumption that if you tax something people do less of it. Again perhaps blazingly obvious.</p>
<p>But it doesn&#8217;t hold up well against the historical record either narrowly considered in relation to 18th and 19th century England or more broadly across cultures and across history. Instead in most of those cultures and most definitely in Georgian and then Victorian England the evidence is strong that capitalists saw investment as the means to different ends, those of consumption and display that in turn would lead to societal status. You only have to look at the great Country Houses that were built during this period, with no expenses spared inside or out whether that be on landscape architects or silversmiths. And even a passing familiarity with say English literature of the time shows this on full display, the manufacturing classes rushing to build those country houses and buy their daughters way into society as soon as they could afford it, the facts on the ground clearly show that the driving goal of most investors was to finance consumption and display in the form of dress and habitations. Let us put it this way Scrooge was not then or now considered the hero, and throughout history the miser has been a despised and mocked figure.</p>
<p>Now this runs directly against the &#8220;blindingly obvious&#8221; assumption that the goal of investment is purely accumulation. So what happens when we substitute &#8216;consumption and display&#8217;? Well a couple of things. First we can recognize that under some circumstances accumulation IS display, rankings on the list of &#8216;the most wealthy X of Y&#8217;s&#8217; being just as important as more explicit displays of status on the British and European pattern. And since the U.S. doesn&#8217;t have patents of nobility, this aspect of accumulation as display has an outside importance. But in any case none of it seems to effect the other side of the equation, very few billionaires not named Warren Buffet actually resist the temptation to buy the multiple mansions, the penthouse apartments on Central Park, the yacht, the vacations in the South of France, the jewelry, the trophy or society wives (depending on whether they are new or old money). You just don&#8217;t have the MOTUs reinvesting every single penny, instead when given an opening they can and do spend and often in the most conspicuous ways possible, there not being much difference between an American billionaire of today and a 16th century British Duke or more to the point a 19th century Manchester industrialist in this regards. Instead re-investment is often seen as just the vehicle needed to climb to the next consumption level.</p>
<p>So what does this have to do with progressive taxation? Well once you accept the assumption that the fundamental goal of investment among the upper classes is consumption and display and further that in most cases that consumption doesn&#8217;t have the multiplicative effects on the wider economy that re-investment would then the goal of progressive taxation becomes obvious, and by the way a lot less socialist than the old shibboleth of redistribution. The goal of progressive taxation in the classical political liberal position dominate in this country from 1913-1980 was to penalize consumption and favor re-investment. After all at least under current law gains on capital are by and large not exposed to federal taxation until they are realized, if instead they are plowed back into productivity improvements they are at the corporate or individual level largely tax exempt. It is only when you take the equity out in the form of interest, dividends or simply cashing out equity that tax is encured.</p>
<p>The logical conclusion of this model is that if we accept the principle that to tax something is to induce people to do it less, if nothing else by increasing its marginal cost, then Supply Side becomes the Voodoo the Elder Bush always said it was. Lowering top marginal rates and taxing capital gains at half the rates of capital income would under my model have the effect of encouraging consumption and discouraging reinvestment. Whereas high rates would have the opposite effect. Which has the advantage of being testable, if we had to constrast the 50s and the 80s in terms of the consumption patterns of the near the top level of capitalists and managers we see a lot less conspicuous consumption among the former than we do in the post Reagan-era. In the 50s and 60s only Greek shipping magnates could afford the kind of consumption patterns that became common in before, during, and after the Enron era and certainly continuing today. From my perspective all Supply Side did was to lower the cost of consumption in pre-tax dollars, purchases that were inconceivable in the days of 90 and then 70% top rates have become routine in the days of 15%.</p>
<p>Which suggests that the current neo-liberal surrender to the idea that any increase in tax on capital inevitably will lead to disinvestment, almost as if it were an accounting identity, when history suggests the effects are the other way around, capitalists wanting to maintain the same level of consumption in a higher tax environment simply needing to intensify their re-investment rather than lazily take those gains out in the form of salaries, bonuses, and dividends.</p>
<p>You could sum up the whole argument by saying that Manchester and allied schools of economics assumes that everyone behaved like a Northern European Calvinist Burgher, or more narrowly that the triumph of capitalism was represented in the premises of Scrooge and Marley.</p>
<p>BTW this substitution of &#8216;consumption&#8217; for &#8216;accummulation&#8217; has explanatory powers far outside the narrow confines of capitalist taxation. A great deal about peasant economies that have historically baffled both branches of liberal economics, that which led to Chicago and that which gave us Marx, in my view stemmed from not getting that most peasants even in the strictest systems organized their economic life around consumption targets rather than growing net worth (say by acquiring more fields). You get a strong whiff of this with the modern bafflement that the French would substitute 35 hour weeks with seven weeks of vacation for longer hours that would lead to higher net worth. Do they not want to get rich? Well yes, but to what end? Adopt a consumption based model and lots about the European system and early retirement here starts making perfect sense.</p>

<p>Retail sales in Germany and Spain were reported last week for the month of June. On a working-day and not-seasonally adjusted basis, real retail sales fell <a href="http://www.ine.es/en/daco/daco42/daco4215/ccm0611_en.pdf">7.0% on the year in Spain</a>. In contrast, working-day and seasonally adjusted real retail sales <a href="http://www.destatis.de/jetspeed/portal/cms/Sites/destatis/Internet/EN/press/pr/2011/07/PE11__283__45212,templateId=renderPrint.psml">surged over the month in Germany</a>, 6.3%, and posted a 2.6% annual gain.<br />But the Spanish data is better than the non-seasonal numbers would suggest. In fact, accounting for seasonal factors as in the manner done by the Federal Statistical Office of Germany, Spanish real retail sales posted a monthly gain, 1.2% in June. Don&#8217;t get too giddy on me &#8211; the Spanish data looks awful in a small panel (time series and cross section).</p>

<p><strong>Observations From the Past 3.5 Years</strong></p>
<p>Being alive in the past 3.5 years provides the following lessons:</p>
<p>1.  Significant elements of the government, influenced to one or another degree by private sector lobbying and contributions, have done a poor job at leading the country.<br />2.  Significant elements of the financial industry, influenced to one or another degree by government rules and regulations, have done a poor job of investing assets.<br />3.  Significant elements of the home buying public, influenced to one degree or another by government policy and the financial sector, have done a poor job at buying houses.<br />4.  Significant elements of the economics profession, influenced to one degree or other by ideology and a mercenary mindset, have done a poor job of understanding the economy. </p>
<p>That raises a few questions:</p>
<p>a.  Is there any way to show that of the elements described above, the private sector or public sector is more or less inefficient at what they do?<br />b.  Of the elements described above, which of those that failed at what they did on average, have paid or will pay a price, and which of those that failed at what they did, on average, have or will &#8220;failed upwards?&#8221;<br />c.  Given b, which of the elements described above can be counted on to create a &#8220;next time around&#8221; or of making that next time around worse?</p>
