                                <p>I was talking to my father, who noted&#8230; people are saying:  &#8220;We&#8217;ll be in Iraq a long time.  But we&#8217;ve had bases in Germany for 60 years, and in South Korea for 50 years.  It will be no different.&#8221;</p>
<p>But why do we have bases in Germany?  And why do we have bases in South Korea?  Twenty years ago maybe it made sense, but now?  And what exactly will be the purpose of US forces in Iraq in 60 years?</p>

                                <p>Via (for the second time today!) the <a href="http://www.thecarpetbaggerreport.com/archives/13384.html">Carpetbagger Report</a>, an article in the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/26/AR2007102602417.html">Washington Post</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The State Department will order as many as 50 U.S. diplomats to take posts in Iraq next year because of expected shortfalls in filling openings there, the first such large-scale forced assignment since the Vietnam War.</p>
<p>On Monday, 200 to 300 employees will be notified of their selection as &#8220;prime candidates&#8221; for 50 open positions in Iraq, said Harry K. Thomas, director general of the Foreign Service. Some are expected to respond by volunteering, he said. However, if an insufficient number volunteers by Nov. 12, a department panel will determine which ones will be ordered to report to the Baghdad embassy next summer. </p>
<p>&#8220;If people say they want to go to Iraq, we will take them,&#8221; Thomas said in an interview. But &#8220;we have to move now, because we can&#8217;t hold up the process.&#8221; Those on the list were selected by factors including grade, specialty and language skill, as well as &#8220;people who have not had a recent hardship tour,&#8221; he said.</p></blockquote>
<p>Fools.  Don&#8217;t they know the Surge is working?  And now a reference that tells us, this ain&#8217;t no Vietnam:</p>
<blockquote><p>Although a few skilled individuals were ordered to &#8220;hard-to-fill&#8221; diplomatic posts in past decades, there have been no mass &#8220;directed assignments&#8221; in the Foreign Service since 1969, when an entire class of 15 to 20 entry-level officers was sent to Vietnam, Thomas said.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Those who are ordered to Baghdad as part of the new call-up will receive incentives, known as the Iraq Service Package, already offered to volunteers. It includes additional pay of about 70 percent for most mid-level officers, plus another 20 percent of basic salary to compensate for long hours. Officers are not allowed to take their families to Baghdad, but the package allows them to leave spouses and children in whatever post they transfer from for the length of their tour, or to send them back to Washington.</p>
<p>U.S. diplomats in Baghdad are given five &#8220;rest and relaxation&#8221; breaks during the year, including up to three of them in the United States, for a total of 60 days outside Iraq. Those completing a Baghdad tour are also given preference in choosing their next assignment. </p></blockquote>
<p>What&#8217;s wrong with the State Department?  Why aren&#8217;t spouses and children allowed?  Don&#8217;t they know the Surge is working?  And 60 days outside of the country out of 365?  One day in six?  You&#8217;d think the folks with information about what is actually going on think that things aren&#8217;t going so well in Iraq.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>A while back, I noted that the killings in Iraq would stop once the ethnic (or rather, sectarian) cleansing was complete.  </p>
<p>So how do you tell the difference between a strategy is working (i.e., right now, The Surge, but at this time next year, something else) and cleansing that has been completed?  Because right now, in some parts of Iraq, there is quiet.  Well, relative quiet.  And some attribute it to the Surge.</p>
<p>I think the answer is obvious.  You can tell a neighborhood has been pacified as a result of the policy du jour rather than cleansing if the folks who moved away (i.e., fled) move back.  I believe estimates are that well over a million people have fled the country, and about that many are internally displaced.  Whatever the precise number, in a country of under we&#8217;re talking about, at a minimum, a figure equal to 5% of the country&#8217;s current population (which the CIA factbook estimates at about 27.5 million).  Most of those who fled aren&#8217;t exactly living in luxury &#8211; a huge percentage are living illegally or on the fringes in Jordan or Syria.  All of which is to say, there are a lot of Iraqis who would be ready and willing to move back, if the country was pacified, and pacified by virtue of something other than their absence.</p>
<p>Which brings us to, via the <a href="http://www.thecarpetbaggerreport.com/archives/13379.html">Carpetbagger Report</a>, a story in <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/26/AR2007102602402.html">Washington Post</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;When we first got here, all the shops were open. There were women and children walking out on the street,&#8221; Alarcon said this week. &#8220;The women were in Western clothing. It was our favorite street to go down because of all the hot chicks.&#8221;</p>
<p>That was 14 long months ago, when the soldiers from the 1st Battalion, 18th Infantry Regiment, 1st Infantry Division, arrived in southwestern Baghdad. It was before their partners in the Iraqi National Police became their enemies and before Shiite militiamen, aligned with the police, attempted to exterminate a neighborhood of middle-class Sunni families. </p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>While top U.S. commanders say the statistics of violence have registered a steep drop in Baghdad and elsewhere, the soldiers&#8217; experience in Sadiyah shows that numbers alone do not describe the sense of aborted normalcy &#8212; the fear, the disrupted lives &#8212; that still hangs over the city.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>American soldiers estimate that since violence intensified this year, half of the families in Sadiyah have fled, leaving approximately 100,000 people.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just a slow, somewhat government-supported sectarian cleansing,&#8221; said Maj. Eric Timmerman, the battalion&#8217;s operations officer.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>The descent of Sadiyah followed a now-familiar pattern in Baghdad. In response to suicide bombings blamed on Sunni insurgent groups such as al-Qaeda in Iraq, the Shiite militias, particularly the Mahdi Army, went from house to house killing and intimidating Sunni families.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>The focus of the battalion’s efforts in Sadiyah was to develop the Iraqi security forces into an organized, fair and proficient force — but the American soldiers soon realized this goal was unattainable. The sectarian warfare in Sadiyah was helped along by the Wolf Brigade, a predominantly Shiite unit of the Iraqi National Police that tolerated, and at times encouraged, Mahdi Army attacks against Sunnis, according to U.S. soldiers and residents. The soldiers endured repeated bombings of their convoys within view of police checkpoints. During their time here, they have arrested 70 members of the national police for collaboration in such attacks and other crimes.</p>
<p>The Interior Ministry, which oversees the national police, has said that officials are working hard to root out militiamen from the force and denied that officers have any intention of participating in sectarian violence.</p>
<p>But in one instance about two months ago, the American soldiers heard that the Wolf Brigade planned to help resettle more than 100 Shiite families in abandoned houses in the neighborhood. When platoon leader Lt. Brian Bifulco arrived on the scene, he noticed that “abandoned houses to them meant houses that had Sunnis in them.”</p>
<p>“What we later found out is they weren’t really moving anyone in, it was a cover for the INP to go in and evict what Sunni families were left there,” recalled Bifulco, 23, a West Point graduate from Huntsville, Ala. “We showed up, and there were a bunch of Sunni families just wandering around the streets with their bags, taking up refuge in a couple Sunni mosques in the area.”</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We were so committed to them as a partner we couldn&#8217;t see it for what it was. In retrospect, I&#8217;ve got to think it was a coordinated effort,&#8221; Timmerman said. &#8220;To this day, I don&#8217;t think we truly understand how infiltrated or complicit the national police are&#8221; with the militias.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>The American people don&#8217;t fully realize what&#8217;s going on, said Staff Sgt. Richard McClary, 27, a section leader from Buffalo.</p>
<p>&#8220;They just know back there what the higher-ups here tell them. But the higher-ups don&#8217;t go anywhere, and actually they only go to the safe places, places with a little bit of gunfire,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They don&#8217;t ever [expletive] see what we see on the ground.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, the corollary to that last quote is the folks on the ground don&#8217;t see the big picture.   But in this case, the big picture is easy to see:  much of the country has been cleansed, and the populations have been separated.  And the folks who have fled are not coming back.</p>
<p>Why is American blood and treasure not going to help those who have had to flee, but rather those that have made them flee?  At what point do we conclude, or do we even care, that American blood and treasure is going toward helping those that have done the cleansing, and is, in fact, helping them keep the place cleansed?</p>

I thought I would post some information on the variety of approaches to these subjects about people and<br /><a href="http://www.personality-project.org/perproj/readings-theory.html">personality traits</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>The study of personality includes multiple approaches to the question of who we are and how and why we are similar and different to other indivduals. Some of the ways in which we study personality are developing <a href="http://www.personality-project.org/perproj/readings-taxonomies.html">descriptive taxonomies</a> of individual differences. These approaches use basic <a href="http://www.personality-project.org/perproj/readings-measurement.html">psychometric and assessment</a> techniques developed for the study of personality and <a href="http://www.personality-project.org/perproj/readings-iq.html">ability</a>. These approaches emphasize the &#8220;who&#8221; question of how people are similar to and yet differ from each other.<br />At least five different theoretical approaches address the &#8220;why&#8221; question. That is, why are there individual differences. <a href="http://www.personality-project.org/perproj/readings-theory.html#EvolPsych">Evolutionary Psychology</a> emphasizes universals of human behavior and attempts to explain individual variability in terms of alternative adaptive strategies. <a href="http://www.personality-project.org/perproj/readings-theory.html#Behavior">Behavior genetic</a> approaches analyze the variation in behavior in terms of the complex interplay between genetic and environmental influences. Systematic work in <a href="http://www.personality-project.org/perproj/readings-theory.html#Biological">biological theorizing</a> has emphasized the continuity of behavior across species and searches for the biological underpinnings of temperament and complex behavior. <a href="http://www.personality-project.org/perproj/readings-theory.html#social">Social cognitive</a> theories emphasize the importance of socialization and the effect of cognitive processes to create one&#8217;s unique patterning of behavior. Traditional <a href="http://www.personality-project.org/perproj/readings-theory.html#Psychoanalytic">psychoanalytic techniques</a>, although not a major area of current personality theory, did have an influence in the theories developed throughout much of the 20th century.<br />The following selections from each of these approaches are meant to lead the interested reader to some of the current literature. These are certainly not meant to be a complete selection, but are rather important readings that provide good overviews of the separate approaches. The interested reader is encouraged to first consult the <a href="http://www.personality-project.org/perproj/readings-overviews.html">overviews of personality</a> before delving into these more specialized readings.<br />Some of the most interesting results of the past decade have been the demonstrations of the moderate to strong heritability of personality and ability. Using techniques of quantititative behavior genetics, it has become commonplace to show that roughly 40-60% of the variation in most personality traits have a genetic base. The most exciting and counter-intuitive findings have been that the shared environment is much less important than previously thought but that the unique environment is very important.</p>

                                <p>David Shuster did a fine job last night guest hosting for <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21490510">Countdown</a>, while Keith Olbermann visited Fenway Park for Game 2 of the World Series.  Here is the part that interested me the most:</p>
<blockquote><p>SHUSTER:  In Greek myth, Cassandra was the prophet whose warnings were to be cursed never to be heeded until it was too late.  In presidential politics, Rudy Giuliani has become the prophet whose warnings he has cursed never to have issued until it was too late.  On the campaign trail he talks about his terrorism scholarship before 9/11 and says only he saw the real danger posed by al Qaeda.  But in our fourth story in the COUNTDOWN: A secret document which you were never meant to say until after November 2008 has now been leaked refuting Giuliani‘s claim with his own words.  Typical displaying a foresight was a presidential campaign speech to summer which he discussed in 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center.</p>
<p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)<br />RUDY GIULIANI, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  It was a big mistake to not recognize that it was a terrorist act and an act of war, and then we were attacked at Cobart Towers, Kenya, Tanzania, 17 of our sailors killed on the USS COLE and the United States government under then President Clinton, didn‘t respond.  Bin Laden declared war on us, we didn‘t hear it.  I thought it was pretty clear at the time, but a lot of people didn‘t see it, couldn‘t see it.<br />(END VIDEO CLIP)</p>
<p>SHUSTER:  Never mind that al Qaeda‘s culpability for the COLE was only established after Mr. Bush‘s election and Mr. Bush then did nothing about it.  Now, in New York, “The Village Voice Newspaper” reports that in the testimony before the 9/11 Commission on count after count, Giuliani revealed little knowledge of or positive dispositions influenced by the threat of al Qaeda.  According to one commission memo it was after 9/11 that quote &#8211; “We brought in people to brief us on al Qaeda.  We had nothing like this pre-9/11 which was a mistake.”  And Giuliani, on police commissioner told the commission &#8211; “I was not happy with NYPD‘s intelligence in general,” when he took the job at 2000, seven years after the first bombing.  Other items from the commission, Giuliani said Commissioner Ferric (ph) knows more than he does about software that might help in the war on terror and Giuliani had “No knowledge” of the amplifier system installed after the 1993 bombing to improve communications.  Let‘s bring in the reporter who broke the story, Wayne Barrett, of the “Village Voice,” author of “Grand Illusion: The Untold Story of Rudy Giuliani in 9/11” and probably the source of more Giuliani reporting than anyone else, Wayne, thanks for your time tonight.</p>
<p>WAYNE BARRETT, VILLAGE VOICE: David, glad to be here.</p>
<p>SHUSTER:  Wayne, give us the broad outline of the degree of terrorism expertise Giuliani claimed in his secret testimony to the 9/11 commission.</p>
<p>BARRETT:  Zero, David, it was a confession of ignorance.  He basically said, I knew nothing about al Qaeda.</p></blockquote>
<p>Barrett and Shuster continue but you get the idea.  When Rudy says the Clinton White House was not listening – that’s a flat out lie.  They were listening and acting on the information they had.  When Rudy says he was listening, it seems this also was a lie.  But hey – this kind of dishonest Democrat bashing is Rudy’s entire campaign.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Guess it’s no surprise that <a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/horsesmouth/2007/10/fox_news_tells.php">Faux News</a> supports Rudy!</p>

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Oil, Credit, Global Warming (with pollution)&#8211;all coming together for the perfect storm.</p>
<p>Oil hopefuls still dream of oil returning to $45/barrel. The $90/barrel (and rising) they say is nothing more than a geopolitical event: Turkey and the Kurds, Bush and Iran, Israel-Leiberman/Syria.</p>
<p>But supplies are growing tight. The spigot may soon not meet the demand. China, after all, has the pedal to the metal. Nothing will deter it from its goal of being a frontier nation. And then there is India. Actual world oil production—even with the increase in rigs—seems to have flattened. Of course Congress will blame it all on those greedy oil companies.</p>
<p>The credit crunch is starting to hit the U.S. consumer&#8211;, he whose spendthrift ways gave the “oomph “ to the party. Subprime carnage continues. We never know where the next head of this hydra will appear. And, of course, the dollar falls. Cheapening the dollar makes some debts easier to pay: All those countries that bought T-Bills, etc. For the U.S. consumer, though, it will be a nightmare. Cancel the trips abroad. Worry about the oil bill. And wait for the price of those cheap imports to rise.</p>
<p>Oh, and don’t expect our manufacturing plants, resource centers, and research facilities now happily sitting in developing countries to return home. Labor is still cheaper there; tax breaks are still better. At some point, of course, freight costs are going to be passed on. But in the interim, profit margins will lessen. At what point will freight costs outweigh labor costs and tax benefits? Many of our imported goods have very high profit margins: Lots of shrinkage possible, assuming the world supply of well-heeled buyers does not decline too much.</p>
<p>Global warming? Well, one interesting statistic is worth mentioning: The recent Arctic ice-melt is thirty years ahead of the IPCC schedule. The IPCC claimed that sometime in 2040 we would reach the present Arctic sea ice melt. Mother Nature has her own schedule, apparently. Meanwhile some areas predicted to experience more and more extreme drought conditions are starting to get a glimmer of what that might mean. CNN used the time it had assigned to its special “Planet in Peril” to cover the fires in California.</p>
<p>Those who claim that these fires—and the serious water shortages we are now experiencing—are because of poor planning and over-population—have a good point. We have not planned well. On the other hand, the ice-melt proceeds apace. I wonder if Greenland has some surprises for us. If the IPCC missed the ice-melt by thirty years, what else have they missed?</p>
<p>For me, global warming is never just about balmier days and sweaty nights—more sun tan oil and drilling in Arctic waters. There is the pollution that simply grows and grows. Every time I think of China, I just despair. Yes, we in the West have done poorly. We have nothing to brag about. But China is so much bigger. In following our footsteps, it will sink the entire planet. And China had the chance of doing it differently, of learning from out mistakes, of growing intelligently. Now it is a runaway machine…out of control of its own planners. When Wuxi decided that its pollution could not longer be tolerated, other Chinese cities stepped forward. “Send the factories here,” they said. We would rather be rich and polluted than poor and clean. The phrase “filthy rich” now has a new twist, I think. But maybe it always had that twist. We never stopped to notice.</p>
<p>We will certainly stumble on for another five or six years, but the stumbling will get worse. Movie Guy often told me, “2012, that’s my year for the shit hitting the fan.” He may be right.</p>
<p>It is hard to tell people now in their 30’s or 40’s what they have missed…or how our environment has dramatically worsened. They simply live with it, not knowing anything else. Water and air and land become increasingly polluted. It’s all they know. So it gets a bit worse each year; hey, that’s progress. But I remember laughing about bottled water. “You got to be kidding! Bottled water! &#8221;  I drank out of lakes and streams or pumped water out of a well.</p>
<p>All places are microcosms of what is happening. I have three or four about which I regularly think. Yes, I see the documentaries about the rest of the planet, but in the last analysis, my own experience is just as informative.</p>
<p>I grew up in the 1950’s on Cape Cod: Farms, small towns, lakes filled with fish always attracting a crowd of swimmers. And the lakes were potable. Now, few lakes are swimmable. Salt water coves and inlets were pollution free.. Now, the coves and inlets often are polluted. The farms are gone, replaced with wall-to-wall traffic. The houses are still beautiful, but the thirst for water is threatening the water table. As the aquifers disappear, the salt water encroaches. Red tide, rarely a problem when I was young, is now a serious problem. Areas once always opened for clamming and shell fishing are now more often than not closed. Progress? I guess. Sensible planning? No. Those that live there now think it a great place. I would never live there.</p>
<p>As a young man, I lived in Westchester, NY. In the 60’s and 70’s it was quite rural. Air was clean, plenty of walking space. Traffic, while at times difficult, was not the nightmare it has become. Smog and pollutants once reserved for New York City have now spread to northward. Clean air? I don’t think so. Power plants are alive and spewing throughout New York. Suck an exhaust pipe.</p>
<p>I used to swim in Long Island Sound, if you can believe it. But before I left, I had to stop. The filth was unbelievable.</p>
<p>My experience has to be multiplied a million times over. No place is as pristine as it was in the 1950’s. Occasionally we make inroads; but they are temporary.</p>
<p>The last place I lived before moving to Canada was the Eastern Shore of Maryland. The Chesapeake Bay within living memory was once clean. Billions of oysters filtered the water. You could see ten or fifteen feet down. Now, you might see a foot into its cloudy depths. Large areas are anaerobic; blue crabs struggle to the surface for air. Oysters are almost gone; the blue crab is on its way. Close friends of mine were waterman; they made a living crabbing and tonging. One by one they have left the bay; one by one they have moved off the shore. Crab picking houses now have to import crabs to keep busy. Talk about &#8220;Saving the Bay&#8221; is always present, always ineffectual. The pressures are too great; the ignorance too pervasive.</p>
<p>Once a waterman asked me to help him with his trotline. I happily obliged. When we took a break for a beer and refreshments, he blithely tossed the garbage overboard: beer cans, plastic…everything. “Oh,” he responded to my alarm, “don’t worry. Crabs eat everything.” Beer cans? Plastic holders? There was no arguing with him. Another waterman friend schemed as to how he could increase the number of his crab pots. Increase them he did. A few years later, he could no longer make a living crabbing or tonging. He left. Happily some rich dude from Washington bought his house: It had a great view of the Bay. The rich dude liked the idea of living among the watermen.</p>
<p>Conservation simply does not make sense to those who want more, from large corporations to single individuals. Each sees his livelihood in very short terms: today, tomorrow, may a few months or a year at most. We should not be surprised.</p>
<p>But the perfect storm is approaching. It is of our own creation: A monument to our success and creativity, to our science and ingenuity. We can scrape the ocean floors faster; drill deeper and better wells. Put air filters in our homes; buy bottled water. I don&#8217;t think the market is working. Slowly but surely we are being driven into a corner. Take the long view and you will see what I mean.</p>

                                <p>This is just a little visual fun. Think about that saying “a billion here, a billion there, soon you&#8217;re talking about<a href="http://www.xinjo.com/interesting/a-little-visual-perspective-on-the-87-billion-being-spent-on-iraq?eref=rss_full"> real money</a>”.</p>
<p>Personally, I think visuals like this need to be circulated more frequently so that people have a better understanding when the government or business speaks dollar amounts. It might help them pause about whether they think something such as a war is really getting them a better life.  Or just how much of a relative tax break they are getting.</p>
<p>But for the war, we&#8217;re talking trillions so:<br />Here is some perspective on TRILLION:<br />Trillion = 1,000,000,000,000.The country has not existed for a trillion seconds.Western civilization has not been around a trillion seconds.One trillion seconds ago – 31,688 years – Neanderthals stalked the plains of Europe.</p>
<p>Here is another one I like: <a href="http://www.lcurve.org/">The L Curve</a></p>
<p>Last but not least is this one that is actually a presentation being made to our legislators concerning our military budget.<br /><a href="http://www.truemajorityaction.org/oreos/">The Oreo Cookie </a></p>

                                <p>Via <a rhef="http://blogreport.salon.com/">the Blog Report</a>, we get to Curt at (shiver) <a href="http://www.floppingaces.net/2007/10/25/white-supremacists-love-them-s/">Flopping Aces</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>We&#8217;ll lookie lookie.  It appears some white supremacists love them some Ron Paul.</p></blockquote>
<p>Anyway, it seems the White Supremacist crowd has decided that Ron Paul is the lesser of various evils (from their perspective) and is willing to support him.  That, for Curt at Flopping Aces, is a good enough reason not to support Ron Paul.</p>
<p>Now, I think regular readers can figure out that the probability that I would vote for Ron Paul for anything approaches zero.  But I think Curt is holding a very inconsistent position&#8230; I wonder which of the two major candidates Curt thinks the White Supremacist crowd preferred in the last Presidential election, or the one before that, or the one before that, and so forth, at least going back to when FDR ran for the first time.  If he&#8217;s exercised that White Supremacists look at Ron Paul as the lesser of various evils running for the Republican nomination, will he be equally opposed to Giuliani or (in my opinion, more likely) Romney when it turns out the White Supremacists look at the Republican candidate as the lesser of two evils in the general election?</p>

                                <p>Earlier this week Econlog and Marginal Revolution had a good discussion about an article by<br /><a href="http://www.minneapolisfed.org/pubs/region/07-09/wages.cfm">Terry J. Fitzgerald</a> in the Minneapolis Fed Review.</p>
<p>The article goes into a great deal of detail about the weak performance of average hourly earnings in recent years.</p>
<p>One point in the discussion was the new experimental measure of average hourly earnings being developed by the BLS.  This measure has been getting a lot of attention lately with the widespread expectations that the new measure would show that the old measure of average hourly earnings has been significantly understating the rate of gain for average hourly earnings.</p>
<p>We now have some 16 months of results from the new experimental measure of average hourly earnings. it shows.</p>

<p>In the first year the new measure grew 3.3% while the old measure expanded 4.0% and over the first 16 months the old measure of average hourly earnings grew 5.4% as compared to a 4.3% increase for the new experimental measure.</p>
<p>So far it looks like the new experimental measure is demonstrating just the opposite results that what was expected by those who believe that average hourly earnings has been significantly understating the income growth of the about 80% of employment that punch a time clock rather than earn a salary or commission or are self employed.</p>
