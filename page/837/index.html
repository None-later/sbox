                                <p>This post looks at spending by the federal government, subtracting off Social Security and the defense spending.  And it does it two ways.  One is as a percentage of GDP.  The other is in real dollars per person.  </p>
<p>Before I begin, a few comments.  Regular readers know in the past few days I&#8217;ve been looking at federal spending, <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/06/comparing-presidents-size-of-government.html">here in terms of number of Federal employees</a>, and <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/06/comparing-presidents-federal-government.html">here in terms of number of Federal spending less social security as a percentage of GDP</a>.</p>
<p>Now, as a liberal who is fiscally conservative, I really don&#8217;t care about the size of government.  The question is &#8211; are we being made better off?  At times, smaller government is the way to do that.  At times, larger government is the way to do that.  (As noted on numerous other posts, the fastest annualized growth rates in the economy (whether one accounts for changes in debt or not) in the post WW2 era occured under JFK/LBJ and Clinton administrations.  One increased the size of government a lot, one decreased it by more than any other President by the two measures I&#8217;ve looked at so far.</p>
<p>But small government is an article of faith to our conservative and libertarian friends, not to mention our troll who has on occasion been acting almost like one of our friends as of late.  And the fact that Clinton outperforms all the Reps, including St. Ronald the Most High Reagan, doesn&#8217;t fit with that faith.   Fortunately, all is not lost&#8230; our friends feel the test is unfair.  Spending should not include defense spending.  Frankly, I&#8217;m not sure I agree&#8230;. it seems to me, for instance, that this is an argument that we should count GW&#8217;s spending on Afghanistan, as that is spending that was thrust upon him.  The corrolary, of course, is that this means counting the spending on Iraq, which was not thrust upon him and is being run poorly, and that had Afghanistan been managed well, that war might well be over as well.  Also, some spending gets spent no matter what&#8230; and could go into military or civilian pots.  Example might include shoring up levees (had it been done) in New Orleans, or various types of satellites.  But we aim to please here at Angry Bear, so I&#8217;ll do it.</p>
<p>The second problem our friends have identified &#8230;  dividing by GDP makes Presidents that produced better growth look better (in their eyes) when it comes to cutting spending as a percentage of GDP.   Since our friends don&#8217;t seem to accept the idea that that Democratic administrations growing faster in general was anything but a whimsical game of the gods, it is necessary to penalize those administrations that grew faster.  Well, OK, as I noted, we aim to please&#8230;  I&#8217;ll also take a look at things dividing through by population rather than GDP.</p>
<p>A final note before we begin&#8230; data on government outlays comes from <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2008/sheets/hist03z1.xls">OMB Table 3.1</a>, data on GDP comes from <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2008/sheets/hist01z2.xls">OMB Table 1.2</a>, and CPI for computing inflation comes from <a href="ftp://ftp.bls.gov/pub/special.requests/cpi/cpiai.txt">this table at the BLS</a>.  Additionally, to adjust for population, I used 2nd quarter population data for years until 1976, and 3rd quarter thereafter, to match the fiscal year ends.  Data on population came from the BEA&#8217;s <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/Index.asp">NIPA Table 7.1</a>.  But, as always, if you want my spreadsheet, drop me a line.</p>
<p>Anyway, assuming I didn&#8217;t screw up the data, here goes&#8230;  First up, a graph of Federal Outlays less SS less Defense, all as a percentage of GDP&#8230;</p>

<p>And now a summary&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rm8fN5umkGI/AAAAAAAAAQQ/YTrtjLn5FWI/s1600-h/Convoluted+Measure+to+make+Reps+look+good,+table+1.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rm8fN5umkGI/AAAAAAAAAQQ/YTrtjLn5FWI/s320/Convoluted+Measure+to+make+Reps+look+good,+table+1.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Clinton still beats Reagan.  Even with a Democratic Congress.  And what&#8217;s this?  Carter coming in third?  That can&#8217;t be right.  But it&#8217;s OK.  We still have another measure up our sleeves that will make Reagan kick some Clinton ass and put Carter in his rightful place &#8211; at the bottom.  And here it is&#8230;.  ladies and germans, the measure of what really matters to Republicans and Conservatives and Libertarians alike&#8230; (drumrolll)&#8230;.  real (2000 dollars) federal spending not counting social security or defense expenditures, per capita.  </p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rm8fG5umkFI/AAAAAAAAAQI/L2CK-vmR_Ss/s1600-h/Convoluted+Measure+to+make+Reps+look+good,+graph+2.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rm8fG5umkFI/AAAAAAAAAQI/L2CK-vmR_Ss/s320/Convoluted+Measure+to+make+Reps+look+good,+graph+2.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>And a summary&#8230;<br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rm8fAZumkEI/AAAAAAAAAQA/kpfuyYe72TY/s1600-h/Convoluted+Measure+to+make+Reps+look+good,+table+2.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rm8fAZumkEI/AAAAAAAAAQA/kpfuyYe72TY/s320/Convoluted+Measure+to+make+Reps+look+good,+table+2.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Wait.  No.  Not possible.  Every single President increased spending on non-Social Security and non-defense items per capita?  And Clinton did it by the least?  And he was actually cutting spending per capita before the Republican Congress took over?  And Reagan increased this type of spending by more than three times Clinton?  More than three times Clinton?  And Carter came in third, increasing spending per person at half, repeat, half the rate that GW did?</p>
<p>So we have two options.  One is that I made a serious mistake somewhere.  Regular readers know its happened before, and will probably happen again.  This isn&#8217;t my job, so perhaps I&#8217;m not as careful as I would be if there was a paycheck attached to the work.  You&#8217;re welcome to check my spreadsheets if you want, or to simply grab the data and do it yourself.  I&#8217;m confident if I made a mistake, someone will spot it.  I&#8217;ll have egg on my face, and try not to make another one for a long time.</p>
<p>The other option is that I didn&#8217;t make a mistake.   And if that&#8217;s the case, what&#8217;s the lesson here?  I don&#8217;t know, but it seems to me that even on the one thing that is supposed to really matter to Republicans, that is unaffected (for the most part) by outside events, when looked at in ways that are intended to make Republicans look good, and when ignoring those parts and pieces that would make Republicans look bad&#8230;  even on that carefully constructed measure, Republican Presidents don&#8217;t seem to perform better than Democratic Presidents for whom this isn&#8217;t a goal.  I don&#8217;t know how to interpret this in any way except that Republican Presidents tend to either not be competent, Republican, or both.   But then, I don&#8217;t vote for them.</p>

                                <p>Reader Dan finds this interview of <a href="http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?ItemID=11287">Michael Perlman</a>.</p>
<p>Michael Perlman offers another view on free market not staying free because of the nature of markets and maximization of profit.  He describes a glitch that needs addressing.  </p>
<blockquote><p>…Fixed costs are also related to but not the same thing as long-lived capital. Economists rarely pay much attention to long-lived capital, except to applaud the concept of capital accumulation. The reason for their inattention is that capital goods require considerations of time, which complicates the simple economic models with which they are enamored. Once a company has invested in such capital goods, it is stuck with them because it will not get much for its investment on secondhand markets. Companies become desperate to utilize these capital goods as efficiently as possible. </p>
<p>A large passenger airplane carrying only a couple people would be a disaster for the airline. They would have to do something to fill up their seats.</p>
<p>If all the airlines were in a similar situation, they would have no choice but to engage in the price war. This sort of competition occurred in the 19th century railroads. Bankruptcy became commonplace until J.P. Morgan began to organize them into large cartels to prevent competition.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Modern economics assumes away this tendency even though common sense shows that no really competitive industry today is very profitable. Profits are highest in industries protected by intellectual property or by the influence necessary to garner government contracts. But now, such debates have subsided. Instead, economists exude confidence that the market operates as a giant computer or even a super-brain, which allows it to ensure that business performs in the most efficient manner possible. So great is the divorce from reality that such theories persist even in the post-Enron era.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Competition affects finance in two different ways. As in the rest of the economy, competitive forces drive financial institutions to increase efficiency (in the narrow sense of improving things like the cost of handling transactions). As in the non-financial sector, the outcome tends to be consolidation, which strengthens finance.</p>
<p>At the same time, competition in the non-financial sector tends to lower the rate of profit. Investors, seeking substantial profits, lose interest in the non-financial sector and turn to purely financial operations. This particular consequence of competition helps to explain the rise of hedge funds and the relative absence of investment in productive sectors of the economy.</p></blockquote>
<p>Reader Dan asks&#8230;<br />Do markets have a developmental pattern inherent in the modern form?  If you are always looking for 15% return or more, does this distort the free part of the market to a particular kind of market if the excess capital simply sloshes around in financial instruments?</p>

                                <p>Some weeks ago I posted on the upcoming water crisis in the southwest US. It seems to have already arrived.</p>
<p>For those of you who want to pump water from the Great Lakes, the GL are on a down cycle that may last 50 years or so. Not a good idea.</p>
<p>And southern CA is know for heavy air pollution, which Governor Terminator is addressing with some major proposals.</p>
<p>Questions:</p>
<p>Is it rational to continuing moving people into southern California?</p>
<p>Would it be more rational to create policies causing people to move out of southern CA?</p>
<p>Who would do this and how would it work?</p>
<p>Should we wait until conditions are so bad people depopulate on their own?</p>
<p>If southern CA starts to depopulate and housing prices drop, will people then begin moving back?</p>
<p>Mark Thoma has a post up today on “smart growth” and sprawl,  forcing the depopulation of southern CA could be the ultimate smart growth move – or would it be too fascist?</p>
<p>Your thoughts?</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>This post looks at the size of the federal government by way of Federal Outlays less Social Security, all as a percentage of GDP, by administration beginning with Ike. Its a follow-up of yesterday&#8217;s post looking at the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/06/comparing-presidents-size-of-government.html">number of Federal Employees</a>.</p>
<p>Before we begin, I would hasten to add&#8230; unlike some of the other series I have looked at like growth and fiscal responsibility, on which Democrats tend to better, this is a measure of importance only to Republicans, but not to Democrats. Democrats, presumably, want the government to be of some &#8220;optimal&#8221; size &#8211; which presumably means they would make it bigger when they deem it too small to provide what they deem to be essential services, or they would make it smaller when they deem it too big and therefore too wasteful. In general, however, Republicans just want it smaller. </p>
<p>Let&#8217;s begin with a warning. Yesterday I warned our more sensitive readers to avert their eyes, for the data was not kind to the Holiest St. Ronald the Reagan, and in fact showed the Devil himself to be the President who went the furthest toward reducing the size of the Federal workforce. For those who were too careless to heed my admonition yesterday, I beseech you today. Avert your eyes or you imperil your soul. </p>
<p>Surgeon General&#8217;s requirements taken care of, we can begin. Several readers pointed out in comments yesterday that Clinton may have reduced the size of the Federal workforce through the use of contractors. One could remove employees from the payroll simply by privatizing them and hiring them as contractors. Thus, it would only be fair to look at spending. Which spending? Well, all of it, less items that the President cannot control. The big one over which the President has no control is Social Security. Its a transfer payment, its easy to break out, and it operates independently from the rest of the budget. (Data on Federal Outlays and SS spending comes from <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2008/sheets/hist03z1.xls">OMB Table 3.1</a> and data on GDP comes from <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2008/sheets/hist01z2.xls">OMB Table 1.2</a>.)</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s see the numbers. Here&#8217;s the picture&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rm6OJJumkDI/AAAAAAAAAP4/dPvUlp1QJRw/s1600-h/Federal+Outlays+less+SS+as+a+share+of+GDP.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rm6OJJumkDI/AAAAAAAAAP4/dPvUlp1QJRw/s320/Federal+Outlays+less+SS+as+a+share+of+GDP.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a summary&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rm6N_5umkCI/AAAAAAAAAPw/LTEzmmo2y-E/s1600-h/Federal+Outlays+less+SS+as+a+share+of+GDP,+summary.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rm6N_5umkCI/AAAAAAAAAPw/LTEzmmo2y-E/s320/Federal+Outlays+less+SS+as+a+share+of+GDP,+summary.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Before anything else, I should note&#8230; it never fails, someone comes around erroneously arguing that its due to the Republican revolution and I have to go back and put the numbers into comments. So let me cut that off at the knees&#8230;</p>
<p>The annualized shrinkage from 1992 to 1994 was 3.26%. From 1994 to 2000 it was 2.37%. For those who can&#8217;t subtract, that&#8217;s almost a percent a year. As I keep pointing out, if Gingrich hadn&#8217;t interfered, its likely that Clinton&#8217;s performance would have been much better.</p>
<p>Which raises a question, again. Why don&#8217;t Republicans love Clinton? He had the second best economic growth in the sample (after JFK/LBJ), he was fiscally responsible, he reduced the size of government. Aren&#8217;t all these things that Republicans claim they love?</p>
<p>How can a Republican justify having voted for GW given a) Gore&#8217;s role in making the government smaller during Clinton&#8217;s term and b) GW&#8217;s rapid expansion of government &#8211; at a faster pace than even JFK/LBJ, beating out every other President. And its not like he&#8217;s done well at anything else either.</p>
<p>For extra credit, what happened after 1984 Congressional elections? </p>
<p>Anyway, gotta run. Have at it.</p>

                                <p>I&#8217;m always reluctant to use a partisan source for information, even more when its just providing a translation from another source I simply cannot evaluate and which may be from (horror of horrors) France. But this one has some interesting info, and I don&#8217;t have any reason to think they&#8217;re wrong.</p>
<p>Reader Dan sends a link to <a href="http://www.truthout.org/docs_2006/061107G.shtml">this</a> article (which in turn was translated from <a href="http://rue89.com/2007/06/09/hausse-de-la-production-de-coca-en-colombie">this article</a>):</p>
<blockquote><p>The most interesting thing about the statistics the American administration provides on coca production in Colombia every year is the way they are presented. Or not. When the figures are down, as was more or less the case up until 2005, the American drug czar &#8211; all smiles and armed with supporting tables (see below) &#8211; convokes the cameras to explain that the five billion dollars spent by taxpayers to finance Plan Colombia (military aid to Bogota to fight against cocaine) since 1999 are bearing fruit. But when production climbs, move along reporters, there&#8217;s nothing there to see. That is the case this year.</p>
<p>&#8220;Statistically, there has been no change in the amount of coca under cultivation between 2005 and 2006,&#8221; did we thus learn on Monday, June 4 in a press release discreetly posted online by the offices of John Walters, the aforementioned czar. Yet, when one looks a few lines down, the data seems to tell a wholly different story: The area under coca cultivation grew nine percent to reach 157,200 hectares. Fear and trembling. How can this difference be explained? &#8220;The acreage evaluated in 2006 is 19 percent more than that evaluated in 2005, and almost all the observed increase in production was in this newly-evaluated area.&#8221; Thus, there was not more coca, but they simply did a better job of looking for it. For five billion dollars, it&#8217;s only fair&#8230;.</p>
<p>Yet, two details are striking. First of all, the Office of National Drug Control Policy&#8217;s (ONDCP) press release does not venture to compare the figures for equal acreages, although that had been done the year before to explain how, then too, in spite of the increase in figures, production was, in fact, continuing to decline. Which would therefore mean &#8211; another detail that stings &#8211; that the previous year&#8217;s figures were bogus. Yet, in 2004, Walters gloated even in his blog as he presented this same data, then supposed to explain, all by itself, the genius of American policy in Colombia. At that time, they omitted any mention that the acreage evaluated did not represent even half the country&#8217;s total acreage. This year, John Walters does not seem to have even deemed it useful to open the debate with Internet users.</p></blockquote>
<p>Does anyone not believe the administration is fudging the numbers?</p>

                                <p>&#8220;In this present crisis, government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem.&#8221;<br />Ronald Reagan&#8217;s Inaugural Address, January 20, 1981 </p>
<p>This post continues the comparison of Presidents by looking at the size of government, in this case specifically by looking at the number of gubmint employees (i.e., freeloading bureaucrats dragging down the economy). Before we go on, I would like to warn those few Angry Bears that worship at the Church of the Holiest St. Ronald the Reagan to avert your eyes for what follows must be the work of the Democrat, er, the Devil. </p>
<p>One quick disclaimer&#8230; of course, there are other ways of looking at the size of government, and no doubt we will get to some of &#8217;em. But here&#8217;s where we begin.</p>
<p>Alright. Let&#8217;s rock. All data in this post comes from the White House&#8217;s Office and Management Budget <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2008/sheets/hist17z5.xls">Table 17.5</a>. Note that the table only goes back to 1962. </p>
<p>We begin with Federal Civilian employees per thousand people&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rm06UJumkAI/AAAAAAAAAPg/m9R1M0WQW1E/s1600-h/gov%27t+employment+-+federal,+picture.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rm06UJumkAI/AAAAAAAAAPg/m9R1M0WQW1E/s320/gov%27t+employment+-+federal,+picture.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>And now a summary table&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rm06aJumkBI/AAAAAAAAAPo/dnby9zvxxrA/s1600-h/gov%27t+employment+-+federal,+table+1.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rm06aJumkBI/AAAAAAAAAPo/dnby9zvxxrA/s320/gov%27t+employment+-+federal,+table+1.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Wassup with St. Ronald? His is one of only two administrations to increase the number of federal civilian employees. (And please&#8230; I recognize that there are long term trends out there, but I don&#8217;t see how anyone can argue that the Preznit doesn&#8217;t have the ability to shrink the size of gubmint if he chooses.) If he really believed gubmint was the problem, why was he trying to afflict the rest of us with more gubmint? </p>
<p>Since someone is gonna jump in and say &#8211; &#8220;No. Blasphemy. You are looking at the data the wrong way&#8221; sooner or later, let me be the one to produce the best excuse I can for the Most Holy One: what matters is not just the size of the Federal Government, but all of government. One can shrink the size of the federal government by forcing state and local governments to pick up some tasks from the federal government. Unfunded mandates and all that jazz.&#8221; </p>
<p>Now, I personally suspect that the President&#8217;s ability to affect state and local government employment is fairly limited, but its the best excuse I could come up with for the Great Man. So let&#8217;s check that data too. The graph below shows all government employees per thousand population. Every last DMV worker and postal worker&#8230; </p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rm06GZumj-I/AAAAAAAAAPQ/Cbgi9jtC1uc/s1600-h/gov%27t+employment+-+all,+picture.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rm06GZumj-I/AAAAAAAAAPQ/Cbgi9jtC1uc/s320/gov%27t+employment+-+all,+picture.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>And a summary table&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rm06Lpumj_I/AAAAAAAAAPY/ELcXCDYUr-I/s1600-h/gov%27t+employment+-+all,+table+2.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/Rm06Lpumj_I/AAAAAAAAAPY/ELcXCDYUr-I/s320/gov%27t+employment+-+all,+table+2.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>So what do we see? Well, the Reagan looks much better when you give him credit for a lot of things he didn&#8217;t control. The size of government actually shrank under Reagan by 2% a year, enough to make him third best in Grover Norquist&#8217;s book, right after GHW and a long, long way behind the grand champeen of government shrinkers, Bill Clinton. (And before you go crediting the Republican Revolution, take another look at the graphs above and and ask yourself when Newt Gingrich came to power.) </p>
<p>All of which raises a question&#8230; why do folks like the Club for Growth and the Wall Street Journal and, well, heck, Republicans &#8211; why do they revere Reagan and hate Clinton? Let me rephrase that &#8211; why do folks who talk about smaller government, fiscal responsibility and growth revere the guy who gave us a relatively big government, big debt and slower growth (well, not slower growth relative to other Republicans, but relative to guys like Clinton and JFK/LBJ) and despise a guy who gave us relatively small government, managed to get debt to level off, and produced faster growth?</p>
<p>Personally, I think its because marketing beats product every time with a lot of people. And St. Ronnie the Reagan was all about marketing.</p>

                                <p>Reader Empiricman sends this quetion:</p>
<p>I have been following your Democrat-Republican threads at Angrybear and have an entirely different economic question I thought you might be able to clear up for me.</p>
<p>I understand offshoring and outsourcing are generally forces to increase US productivity but I am having trouble seeing the mechanism in high-skill occupations.</p>
<p>As I understand, most jobs offshored are generally replaced by 2 low income workers (isn&#8217;t this lower productivity?) at 1/3 the cost.  Then added technological costs only allow companies to recoup 1/2 of their wage differences (again, lowering productivity?).  The displaced worker usually takes a job at 2/3 the old wage (once more, lower productivity?).  Although the numbers may not be exact in every case, the trend seems to generally be true that low-income workers tend to be less productive, additional costs are introduced, and displaced workers find less productive jobs.</p>
<p>I can certainly understand how the company has an advantage with lower costs but this looks entirely like wealth redistribution (from the worker to the company &#038; customers) and almost no productivity gains.  I must admit, there is certainly a productivity gain from the low-income workers, who previously probably held even less productive jobs.  However, since most of those gains should be retianed by the foreign country, doesn&#8217;t the US bear all of the productivity losses?  Isn&#8217;t the only gain in the US simply redistribution?</p>
<p>Taken another way, there is a common instance of offshoring I have seen in IT.  An H1-B worker earning $80K is often fired and rehired in India for $20K (although he will be lucky to receive $15K).  Since there are certainly efficiency losses and infrastructure hindrances, the worker is generally less productive than before.  Since this is the simplest outsourcing example, how can there be any economic advantage to this situation?  All we have done is add waste and redistribute the worker&#8217;s wealth to the company.  I also use this example because it is quite common and I know many Indian workers who are rightfully very angry with such practices.</p>
<p>From the studies I can find, they seem to always say productivity is gained because the company produces just as much as before (with a little extra profit) and the fired worker can work at Walmart, adding a little more to the economy.  This seems to be ignoring the lost wages from the employee (and the foreign worker&#8217;s old job), as if those were not output in any sense.</p>
<p>Am I mistaken?</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p>cactus here.  I could be wrong&#8230; I think this is more of an accounting issue than anything else so I&#8217;m way ignorant here, but let me try to reason this out.  Say its the year 2000, and PWC or some other big accounting firm is able to provide $1,000 of output using 1 hour of partner labor and $400 worth of output from the folks below.</p>
<p>Now, say its the year 2007, and they can produce the same $1,000 of output using 1 hour of partner labor and $50 of output from the folks below, who happen to be in India.  </p>
<p>There&#8217;s $350 floating around in &#8220;productivity.&#8221;  Who gets it?  I would imagine the partners at PWC would tell you that it accrues to them for a few reasons:</p>
<p>1.  I imagine the $350 goes to the partners at PWC, not to the folks in India or whoever else<br />2.  The partners would argue that it was their innovation or leadership or mad leadership skillz in recognizing a way to save $350 that is the source of the productivity</p>

<p>Lt Gen Douglas Lute:</p>
<p>New York Times: 7 June 2007, General Tells Senate U.S. Must Prevail in Iraq.</p>
<blockquote><p>America&#8217;s at war and the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan represent what we in the military call the main effort in the long war.</p></blockquote>
<p>Main effort means major expenditure or cost centers in long profit campaign to bankrupt America. This guy is talking about costs and tells nothing of the value we should expect. In most decision scenarios the decision makers ask what are the benefits.</p>
<p>For this administration and congress the only benefits are for their contributors in the military industrial complex.</p>
<p>Then Lute says we have no idea that what we are doing will get to &#8220;must prevail&#8221;.</p>
<p>The next Lute quote is:</p>
<blockquote><p>Conditions on the ground are deeply complex and are likely to continue to evolve, meaning that we will need to constantly adapt.</p></blockquote>
<p>Which is a misleading way of saying: what we are doing today has no connection to any outcome, other than spending scarce resources, and avoiding the inevitable defeat. There is no strategy, so operations and tactics are meaningless as well.</p>
<p>Long war is only beneficial for war profiteers.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p><a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=ODZjNjI4ZTNjZmNiOGMxYjAwOTg1ZGI0NmFiOWFjZjI=">John Tamny</a> starts his attack with yet another episode of how stupid the writers at the National Review really are:</p>
<blockquote><p>Clinton seeks to expand the earned-income tax credit (EITC). Though the credit was brought into the policy mix by no less of a free-marketeer than the late Milton Friedman, it should be remembered that income subsidies will only serve to expand the supply of lower-skilled workers. While an expanded EITC would add to worker pocketbooks with one hand, it would potentially reduce wages with the other as a rising supply of labor would chase low paying jobs and drive down incomes.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let’s recast this in terms of the incidence of a subsidy.  It is true that employers will get a portion of this subsidy in the form of lower wages but Tamny is trying to say that more than 100% of the subsidy would accrue to employers.  He continues to confuse himself on other fronts:</p>
<blockquote><p>On the subject of outsourcing, Clinton contradicts herself in decrying the movement of jobs overseas. This outsourcing is, among other things, the result of rising wage pressures at home, such that companies seek lower-cost labor elsewhere. Were firms to underutilize the finite supply of stateside labor with low-value work, lower pay would be the result since investors would be unwilling to pay a high price for something that could be done more cheaply elsewhere. Clinton forgets that without capital, there are no wages, and no jobs. On the corporate-taxation front, Clinton contradicts her push for higher wages with her desire to make “corporations pay their fair share of taxes.” She forgets that without profit, there is no investment.</p></blockquote>
<p>If the first thing that a visitor from another planet had read on the U.S. economy was this passage, our visitor might have been led to believe that the U.S. under George W. Bush had undergone a rise in its national savings rate which drove up real wages.  But real wages have not been dramatically rising – which is not surprising as the fiscal irresponsibility of this Administration has reduced national savings.  If Senator Clinton wants to commit ourselves to the fiscal responsibility that we saw during her husband’s Administration, maybe we will see more savings and investment, which could restore real wage growth.  But the readers of the National Review are not allowed to think in terms of the Solow growth model.  Rather – they are asked to believe in the free lunch fantasies of Lawrence Kudlow and his ilk.</p>

                                <p>Its a beautiful day, but despite that, I have to work. I should be doing productive stuff right now, but by way of <a href="http://www.haloscan.com/comments/betsynewmark/6139918204353265188/#372762">this comment</a> at Betsy&#8217;s Page, a right wing blog, I became aware of <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2007/06/with_the_american_presidential.cfm">this piece</a> at the Economists&#8217; Free Exchange. </p>
<p>It seems that my look at Dems versus Rep Presidents has come under attack. I was going to write up a well reasoned reply, but, to quote John Candy in Canadian Bacon: &#8220;There&#8217;s a time to think, and a time to act. And this, gentlemen, is no time to think.&#8221; </p>
<p>So here goes&#8230;</p>
<p>
<blockquote>This sort of analysis is, of course, quite beloved of Democrats with a smattering of statistics; not so beloved of the Republicans who spit soda all over their new flatscreens when they see it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Funny. I started looking at data in response to stuff I saw on the Cato Institute, put out by the Club for Growth, or in articles by Thomas Sowell. These always seemed to me to be very carefully constructed so as to show the desired outcomes. </p>
<blockquote><p>The problem with most of these sorts of analyses are plentiful. They have too few sample points…</p></blockquote>
<p>Which is what degrees of freedom are for… Maybe there&#8217;s something wrong with the textbooks on my shelf, but the t distribution tables in the back of those textbooks have as few as 1 (one) degree of freedom. When the degrees of freedom are low, the t-statistics has to be really high in order in to reject H0. Or something like that – what do I know? I only have a smattering of statistics.</p>
<blockquote><p>and worse, they generally treat the points as if they were independent events, rather than (as they are) dependent on the points immediately preceding</p></blockquote>
<p>Let’s see. I did this several ways, with several data sets. Maybe you can argue that with quarterly data (in which case the few observation issue goes by the wayside, even for someone that is unacquainted with the t statistic). But I also did the study by administration (hence the argument about few points, I guess). If one wants to argue some sort of path dependence between Ike’s performance, JFK/LBJ’s, and Nixon, let&#8217;s hear it.</p>
<p>I have no doubt that the first year of JFK/LBJ’s term was heavily dependent on Ike’s administration – after all, the budget was Ike’s. But a few years later? I’d be more inclined to accept an argument from someone on the right that the “Great Society” had no effect on the economy if I hadn’t heard so many times that this massive expansion of the role of government in the economy was bad for the economy. One can have one’s cake or one can eat it. </p>
<blockquote><p>you are more likely to get very rapid growth if you have had very poor growth somewhat recently</p></blockquote>
<p>Ah yes. But I also put up figures leaving out periods of recessions, and also leaving out recessions plus two years. I note… Republican administrations seem to have more recessions and to spend more time in recession (shouldn&#8217;t this phase Republicans?), so this in effect means cherry-picking Republican performance. Despite that, Republicans still didn’t do as well as Dems. </p>
<p>And does this also apply to other series that I looked at, like the growth rate in real health care costs or youth crime? Why?</p>
<p>Also&#8230; is this a comment on lags? I note that I had an entire post <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/05/democrats-republicans-and-lags.html">on lags</a> and how they relate to this issue. For the lag argument to work, it has to vary in length. I&#8217;ve heard folks on the right attribute the growth rate in the Clinton administration to Reagan, but never the growth in the GHW administration that immediately follows Reagan&#8217;s. And I have yet to find a right winger willing to attribute Reagan&#8217;s growth to Nixon/Ford, or worse, Carter.</p>
<p>The next point in the piece was a graph… showing percent change real gdp per capita quarterly. The author decided it helped her back up her point of fast growth following slow growth… I have a bit of a headache right, so maybe I’m missing something here and I’m not seeing what she’s getting at. Whatever it is, it doesn’t apply to the administration as a whole analysis. And it’s also sure a lot of points…</p>
<blockquote><p>Since Ray Fair has argued that these variables are also likely to determine election results, this makes it a little tricky to attribute any sort of causation. The results are also pretty sensitive to choice of start year; for some reason, none of them ever starts with FDR.</p></blockquote>
<p>Why not start with FDR? Regular readers know I consistently try to start with Ike’s election (assuming the data goes back to that point). Too far back, and the world changes too much. The Republican and Democratic personnae that we know today are not hugely different from the ones that existed immediately after WW2. I could likewise ask why, if the Republicans are the Party of Lincoln, they aren’t the most liberal party out there when it comes to, say, rights for Black people?</p>
<p>But OK. Fine. Let&#8217;s look at FDR because it seems that the author of this piece feels his inclusion will change things. I wandered over to Bureau of Economic Analysis&#8217; <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/TableView.asp#Mid">National Income and Product Accounts Table 7.1</a> and pulled data on real GDP per capita. In 1932, the last year before he took office, real GDP per capita was $5,056. In 1945, when he died, it was $12,766. This translates to a growth rate of 6.84% per year. (Note… this is how I’ve been doing the analysis so far… last year before taking office to last year in office.) If we sum the annual growth rates of every Republican President starting with Nixon and running through 2006, it comes to 6.46%. I’m not sure this is a comparison the author had in mind. </p>
<p>But I can hear the response now… it was the war. It was the war that saved FDR. The US entered the war on December 7, 1941. So let’s go with 1941. Real GDP per capita in 1941 was $9,079. A growth rate of… 6.03%. Maybe 1940 is better? 4.98% annual. </p>
<p>Anyway, I could go on, but this is really silly. Going back to FDR is not going to hurt my hypothesis. </p>
<blockquote><p>This analysis gets around some of this first problem by using quarters, rather than years or (stupider still, and most common&#8211;presidential terms), and testing various lags, but the dependency problems remain.</p></blockquote>
<p>Why? Why is it stupider still? If Reagan’s performance was everything we hear, why shouldn’t I look at his annualized performance? Isn&#8217;t that a relevant metric? Or is opinion the only thing that matters?</p>
<p>And why did Reagan’s third best in sample performance follow Carter’s fourth best? I thought good performance followed bad ones. It certainly works when you look at each of the non-Reagan Republican administrations. </p>
<blockquote><p>no one ever really posits a good mechanism that would make it so.</p></blockquote>
<p>And then she mentioned a few mechanisms I suggested, including a few she said I dismiss out of hand are…</p>
<blockquote><p>Democratic policies aren&#8217;t any better for the economy than Republicans, actually, but people think they are, so it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy</p></blockquote>
<p>If this were true, wouldn’t it be a good reason to vote Democratic? What is leadership except making people believe enough that they act upon it? What Reagan sold was “morning in America” and by selling it, he made it true. On the other hand, GHW’s delivery of “a thousand points of light” or whatever never quite rang true.</p>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s a spurious correlation</p></blockquote>
<p>Well sure. But I looked at a bunch of series. These results don&#8217;t stand in isolation. And I ran the means test on a series that doesn’t include debt. Looking at Real GDP per capita less change in real debt per capita (after all – you can boost real GDP per capita simply by spending money, but eventually it has to be paid back so this is a more fair measure of performance), for example, the P-value of the the same test is 0.00764. Let me repeat&#8230; eight tenths of a percent.  The probability of a Type 1 error in the tests that I mentioned in the blog post is either 1% or 5% when you’re using quarterly or administration long data.  Sure, it may be spurious, but at this point I think those who feel it is have the onus on them.  </p>
<blockquote><p>There&#8217;s some third factor that produces both economic growth, and Democratic administrations</p></blockquote>
<p>If there is such a thing… why does GW&#8217;s performance fall in with other Reps rather than Dems? He did lose the popular vote in 2000. If something delivers both economic growth and Democratic administrations, and the something delivered the votes for a Democratic administration, where is the growth? And what happened in 1984? A landslide for Reagan, but Democrat-quality growth. This hypothesis doesn’t fit known facts.</p>
<blockquote><p>people might vote Democratic when they&#8217;re not worried about the economy, and Republican when they want someone to fix it, which would mean that Republicans would end up with a disproportionate number of awful quarters. I have no particular evidence that this is true, mind you, and there may be some disconfirming data on the wind. But I can&#8217;t rule it out.</p></blockquote>
<p>1992… “It’s the economy, stupid.” 1976? In two of the elections in the sample that produced Democratic administrations, the economy was an issue, and not because things were going well. Reagan also was elected partly on the basis of the economy. Was GW? She may not be able to rule it out. I think the rest of us can.</p>
<blockquote><p>The problem is this: which policies?</p>
<p>Which policies, as practiced by Bill Clinton, Jimmy Carter, Lyndon Johnson, John F. Kennedy, and Harry Truman, but not by the Georges Bush, Ronald Reagan, Richard Nixon, and Dwight Eisenhower, are good for the American economy? Economic policy has changed so much over the last fifty years that Nixon and Eisenhower have, economically, far more in common with their Democratic predecessors and successors than they do with Reagan or the Bushes.</p></blockquote>
<p>OK. If we focus on the post-WW2 era, it would seem the policies to emulate are those of JFK/LBJ, wouldn’t it? Almost 3.5% annual growth in real GDP per capita! Clinton, the second best performer, would also do in a pinch. Or, if we go with the eras beginning with FDR, it would seem the policies to emulate are those of FDR. 6.84% growth in real GDP per capita? That’s more than 2.5 times Reagan’s growth rate. Give me some of that, please! And seconds too. But I’m not sure this is where the author of the piece really wants to take things – my guess is she’d prefer something akin to Reagan’s term.</p>
<p>And then the author bring sup the Superbowl effect… Well, a few problems. First, I&#8217;m pretty sure the probability produced by the Superbowl effect is not as high as in the tests I ran. Second, there is no mechanism for the Superbowl effect. But is someone that works for the Economist really trying to argue that the President of the United States has no effect on the growth rate of the US Economy?</p>
