                                <p><a href="http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/002282.html">Max Sawicky</a> reads an interesting <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/09/AR2006060901775.html">article</a> but argues that it missed the most interesting point.  First, a summary of the article:<br />
<blockquote>Indiana is about to turn over its entire toll road for the next 75 years to two foreign companies, making it more expensive to drive.  The decision to hand the Indiana Toll Road to an Australian and Spanish team for $3.8 billion at the end of this month has blown up into one of the biggest brawls here in a generation. It has unsettled the state&#8217;s politics in the months before the November elections, pitting a governor who was President Bush&#8217;s first budget director against the people of northern Indiana, which the highway passes through &#8230; The decision also places Indiana at the leading edge of a nascent trend in which states and local governments are exploring the idea of privatizing parts of the United States&#8217; prized interstate highway system. The idea goes beyond projects, such as Northern Virginia&#8217;s Dulles Greenway, in which states have turned to private companies to build or widen toll roads. Now, they are considering selling or leasing some of the best-known and most-traveled routes across America.  The trend started 1 1/2 years ago, when Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley (D) pushed through a 99-year lease of the Chicago Skyway, nearly eight miles of elevated highway across the South Side, for $1.8 billion. Since then, a New Jersey lawmaker has proposed selling a 49 percent interest in the New Jersey Turnpike and the Garden State Parkway. New York Gov. George E. Pataki (R) is trying to persuade the legislature to let investors rebuild or replace the Hudson River&#8217;s Tappan Zee Bridge. In Houston, Harris County officials are studying leasing 57 miles of toll roads.</p></blockquote>
<p>Max argues:<br />
<blockquote>When a government takes a lump sum in exchange for permitting a private firm to manage a road and levy tolls, it is not only privatizing. It is borrowing, worsening its fiscal position. Most states are looking at growing budget shortfalls in the future, as Medicaid costs in particular continue to grow more rapidly than their revenues. The Gov could just as easily contract out operations and management, but keep the tolls for itself. The fact that the money is earmarked to new projects &#8211; investment &#8211; is irrelevant. It&#8217;s still borrowing. You could just as easily keep the roads and float a bond &#8211; also borrowing &#8211; for the new projects. The leasing is not necessary. The political onus against explicit borrowing can warp decisions.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let me play a bit of devil’s advocate for a moment.  Is it possible the $3.8 billion received by the state of Indiana covers the present value of the foregone toll revenues?  We are talking about the lease versus buy issue, which is analogous to switching from traditional IRAs to Roth IRAs (getting a early big bang of tax revenue but sacrificing taxes in the future).  </p>
<p>Max reader Rich goes one step further and argues that the Federal deduction allows the local government to have a reduced cost of capital.  Tax professionals have been pushing SILO or sale-in, lease-out transactions, which involve assets owned by municipal entities.  Lee Sheppard described these plays in a February 25, 2004 article for Tax Analysts:<br />
<blockquote>Most of the New York and Chicago subway cars and fare card machines have been sold to corporate tax shelter customers and leased back to public transit authorities in SILO deals. Customers include Altria Group (formerly Philip Morris) and Textron Inc. Thankfully, however, the New York subways are still being run by the Metropolitan Transit Authority, and not by America&#8217;s preeminent cigarette manufacturer. What&#8217;s wrong with a SILO if the transit authority gets financing? Defenders of SILO deals argue that they are a cheap way for a transit authority to get financing for its system. The Bush administration argues that the transit systems never get their hands on any funds because of defeasance. The transit authority&#8217;s fee for participating in the deal can be as little as 4 to 6 percent of the value placed on the property, which may be far in excess of its fair market value. Because the corporate shelter customer hopes to recover the entire value of the property in a short time in the form of depreciation deductions, it gets the lion&#8217;s share of the benefits. The SILO transaction features an outright sale coupled with a short 12-year to 20-year sublease. (A 99-year head lease could be used if local law does not permit a sale; when the term of the head lease exceeds the useful life of the property, it is considered a sale.) So the corporate tax shelter customer becomes the tax owner of the property and deducts depreciation on it, in addition to interest on any borrowing for the purchase. </p></blockquote>
<p>On November 26, 2003, Pamela Olson – Assistant Secretary of Treasury – wrote to Norman Mineta who was the Secretary of Transportation about these transactions arguing that the costs to the U.S. Treasury exceeded the benefits to local governments.  </p>
<p>Dean Thomas Riskas – representing the leasing industry – challenged Ms. Olson’s claim by discussing the economics of leasing in a Daily Tax Report article dated April 12, 2004 with the following logic:<br />
<blockquote>The lessee sells an asset to the lessor for a purchase price equal to 100 percent of the asset&#8217;s current fair market value &#8230; The lessor leases the asset back to the lessee, who pays rent to the lessor during the lease term. The rent is more than sufficient to repay the loan and, when combined with the asset&#8217;s residual value (the expected FMV of the asset at the expiration of the lease), always generates a profit for the lessor.  Importantly, the lease is profitable to the lessor without regard to tax benefits.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, the lessor (which in our discussion is one of these foreign firms) is presumably receiving a return on its investment in excess of the normal return to the assets that it purchased.  If that were the case, then Max’s claim that the local government worsened its long-run fiscal position is correct as the benefits to the private sector exceed the cost to the U.S. Treasury, which is an even more damning claim that Ms. Olson was making.  At other times, the representatives of the leasing industry claim that the local governments receive at least a portion of the benefits from ripping off the U.S. Treasury.  </p>
<p>But their claims have so many bait and switch games embedded in the financial analysis, it is hard to tell which version best approximates the real world deals.  From the point of view of local government financing, which is what Max is focusing one, it all comes down to whether the present value of tolls along the Indiana roads over the next 75 years will be greater than or less than the $3.8 billion upfront payment.  Max is suggesting that the present value of the tolls exceed the $3.8 billion, but why would a government make such a dumb deal?  As Max says, the political onus of borrowing can warp decisions.  This is sort of like the Enron financing that has permeated Congress and the White House for the past five years.  And his original OMB director is now Indiana’s governor.</p>
<p>But I don’t want to sound like I’m Bush bashing as I think Ms. Olson has exactly the right idea here – for several reasons.  I just hope her political bosses are supporting her efforts.</p>

In the meantime, <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2006/06/14/boehner-memo">ThinkProgress</a> exposes the confidential strategy memo from Boehner’s office:<br />
<blockquote>Here’s a quick summary:<br />1. Exploit 9/11. The two page memo mentions 9/11 seven times. It describes debating Iraq in the context of 9/11 as “imperative.”<br />2. Attack opponents ad hominem. The memo describes those who opposes President Bush’s policies in Iraq as “sheepish,” “weak,” and “prone to waver endlessly.”<br />3. Create a false choice. The memo says the decision is between supporting President Bush’s policies and hoping terrorist threats will “fade away on their own.” </p></blockquote>
<p>These dishonest demagogues never case.  Incidentally, even a sheep knows that Saddam Hussein is not Osama bin Laden and a few are smart enough to know that the decision on March 19, 2003 to invade Iraq helped revived Al Qaeda.  But I guess sheep are smarter than Congressman Boehner.</p>

<blockquote>Aided by surging tax receipts, President Bush may make good on his pledge to cut the deficit in half in 2006 &#8211; three years early. Tax revenues are running $176 billion, or 12.9%, over last year, the Treasury Department said Monday. The Congressional Budget Office said receipts have risen faster over the first eight months of fiscal &#8217;06 than in any other such period over the past 25 years &#8211; except for last year&#8217;s 15.5% jump &#8230; While gains are broad, those at higher-income levels are enjoying bigger salary hikes. Because they pay higher rates, federal tax revenues soar when they do well.  Those making over $200,000 now pay 46.6% of total income taxes, presidential adviser Karl Rove recently said. That&#8217;s up from 40.5% &#8211; despite Bush&#8217;s tax cuts.</p></blockquote>
<p>That the very rich pay a large share in taxes simply reflects they receive a large share of the nation’s income.  But it’s this comparison of nominal tax revenues for a portion of this fiscal year v. a portion of the previous fiscal year is misleading for several reasons – two related to variability and two related to long-term growth.</p>
<p>On the former – consider our graph of nominal tax revenues.  We have discussed several times the fact that the U.S. economy was bound to eventually recovery from the 2001 recession.  But also notice that there was a temporary dip in tax revenues during the middle part of 2005.  </p>

<p>One might be tempted to say that nominal tax revenues in 2006QI were 15% higher than they were in 2001QI.  But check out our second graph, which shows tax revenues fell relative to nominal GDP.  Part of the reason for this decline relates to the fact that the price-level was 12.8% higher in 2006QI than it was in 2001QI.  Alas, average real GDP growth has been rather anemic over the past 5 years. </p>

<p><em><strong>Update</strong></em>: <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2006/06/20060614.html">President Bush</a> answered a question about inflation thusly:<br />
<blockquote>On fiscal policy, though, I would strongly urge the Congress to recognize why we have grown the way we have grown, why we&#8217;re &#8212; have got strong economic growth in the first quarter of this year, why we&#8217;ve added over 5 million new jobs in a &#8211; in two-and-three-quarters years, and that&#8217;s because the tax cuts are working, and they need to make the tax cuts permanent. Pro-growth economic policies work. And that&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve been calling for permanence in the tax code. And so there will be monetary policy &#8211; we&#8217;ll pay attention very carefully to signs, inflationary signs. That&#8217;s Ben Bernanke&#8217;s job. Our job is to work with Congress to have wise fiscal policy. And wise fiscal policy means not only keeping revenues low, but it also means being wise about how we spend the people&#8217;s money.</p></blockquote>
<p>That’s right – the President’s stated goal is to not have tax revenue growth, which means high deficits forever.  And by telling Bernanke that fiscal policy will remain reckless, the path to low inflation requires higher interest rates, which of course reduces investment and long-term growth.  But if we have permanent deficits as the President just promised – Sargent &#038; Wallace’s Unpleasant Monetarist Arithmetic suggests that the FED will have a very difficult job in controlling inflation.</p>
<p>Maybe the President is simply following the advice of <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=NGU3OGM1YmUyOWQxM2JlOGYzYzM1YzhlYjdkMGUzYjI=">Peter Ferrara</a> who opposes the efforts of the Entitlements Commission to have a balanced reduction in government spending along with tax increases.  Sad.</p>
<p><em><strong>Update II</strong></em>: Judd at <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2006/06/14/will-bush-cut-the-deficit-in-half-this-year-only-in-fantasy-land">Thinkprogress</a> is tracking the rightwing bloggers who are crowing about the Investor’s Business Daily spin:<br />
<blockquote>It shows a lot about the state of fiscal discipline in the conservative movement that these kind of numbers are cause for celebration. </p></blockquote>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p><a href="http://www.senatemajority.com/node/381">Christy Setzer</a> is emailing the latest smear of certain veterans from Karl Rove (good thing as the website seems to be down):<br />
<blockquote>Never one to let the facts or delicious irony stand in the way of a vicious political smear, today Karl Rove took a swipe at war heros Sen. John Kerry and Rep. John Murtha, stating, &#8220;They may be with you for the first few bullets but they won&#8217;t be there for the last tough battles.&#8221; Rove, of course, never served in battle, dodging the draft for nearly three years of the Vietnam War. He&#8217;s in good company, though &#8211; the Vice President received five deferments from going into battle himself. &#8220;Unfortunately for the American military, Dick Cheney, Karl Rove and their merry band of draft-dodgers won&#8217;t be with you for the first few bullets, the last tough battles, or anywhere along the way,&#8221; said Christy Setzer, Communications Director, Senate Majority Project.</p></blockquote>
<p>I guess Karl is feeling his oats after reading <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/06/13/rove.cia/index.html">this story</a>:<br />
<blockquote>WASHINGTON (CNN) &#8211; White House senior adviser Karl Rove has been told by special counsel Patrick Fitzgerald that he will not be charged in the CIA leak case, according to Robert Luskin, Rove&#8217;s lawyer. &#8220;In deference to the pending case, we will not make any further public statements about the subject matter of the investigation,&#8221; Luskin said in a written statement Tuesday. &#8220;We believe that the special counsel&#8217;s decision should put an end to the baseless speculation about Mr. Rove&#8217;s conduct.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Notice CNN did not say whether Robert Luskin got a phone call or a letter from Patrick Fitzgerald and is basically refusing to give any real details.   And even though Mr. Luskin has been spinning ever since the inquiry began, the folks over at <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=NWM2ZjY3YzZkMTA1YzEyODBiZmE2ZGQ0MjhlM2RmNjc=">NRO’s Corner</a> has engaged in what appears to be premature celebration. </p>
<p>For some very good reasons why those supporting the traitors within the White House might wish to stop gloating, see <a href="http://www.firedoglake.com/2006/06/13/hey-bob-wheres-your-letter">Jane Hamsher</a>.</p>
<p><strong><em>Update</em></strong>: <a href="http://www.prospect.org/horsesmouth">Greg Sargent</a> discusses today’s news with Rove attorney Mark Corallo:<br />
<blockquote>Corallo said this: &#8220;There were no conditions attendant to the prosecutor&#8217;s actions. There never has been any discussion about cooperation or conditions or anything of the sort. This strictly reflects the prosecutor coming to the correct conclusion that Rove has told the truth from day one. He believed him.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=NTE5MzJhNWNlZWU1YTUxZjQ2M2JhNGExZmE3MzMyNDY=">Byron York</a> trusts every word out of Carallo’s mouth:<br />
<blockquote>I just talked to defense spokesman Mark Corallo, who told me, &#8220;There are no conditions to this action by the special prosecutor.  There has never been any talk of conditions, of cooperation, of anything that could even be construed as conditions.  This just simply reflects the fact that the special prosecutor found Mr. Rove to be a truthful and credible witness from the beginning.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Corallo is at least consistent in how he spins this.  But I seriously doubt that Patrick Fitzgerald believed what Karl Rove said during his early appearances before the Grand Jury – so excuse me for saying that it would appear that Corallo is full of it – again.</p>
<p>In the meantime, leave poor <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=ODI5YzRjZjQ0Njg2N2QzMmE2OWJkMzhhMmI2NGY5MmE=">Jonah Goldberg</a> alone on this issue – as he has enough <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=ZDk4NWRkZmRjYjQ2OGMzMWM3MTZiYzZiMjRkZWZlMDg=">trouble</a> with another <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=ZDQwNjQ4OWM5MjI1ZDExMWQ4MDNlZDFjYzJlYzIxYmQ=">NRO post</a> that called Mr. Goldberg for his smears on our <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=ZTEzOGQxMGU5NDhkMDVlZmZiMjg4M2ExYjA3ODZkNWI=">neighbors to the north</a>.</p>

Google 06 cr 128 and you get <a href="http://patrickjfitzgerald.blogspot.com/2006/05/sealed-v-sealed-may-17th-grand-jury.html">these</a> <a href="http://patrickjfitzgerald.blogspot.com/">two hits</a>.

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Via <a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2006/06/mccain-on-economic-challenges_13.html">Greg Mankiw</a> comes John McCain’s speech to the <a href="http://mccain.senate.gov/index.cfm?fuseaction=NewsCenter.ViewPressRelease&#038;Content_id=1750">Economic Club of New York</a>.  Greg really liked what Senator McCain said.  Maybe he’s hoping to be McCain’s economic advisor on the hope that a President McCain would be more willing to listen to his advice than George W. Bush did.</p>
<p>Let me start with where I also agree with Senator McCain:<br />
<blockquote>A global rising tide of protectionism and a retreat from market-based economic policy is threatening the entrepreneurs of developed and developing countries alike. Free trade is the key to global economic growth, and a key to U.S. economic success. We need stand up for free trade with no ifs, ands or buts about it. We let trade and globalization be politicized at our own peril.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, President Bush also preaches free trade as he uses trade protection for political purposes.  McCain is also rightfully worried about the long-term fiscal deficit created by the President that Greg used to work for:<br />
<blockquote>A tsunami of entitlement spending is threatening our economy, while providing no real security to retirees. We have made promises that we cannot keep &#8230; Our workers make their retirement plans based on promised benefits that cannot be paid even if we burden our children with crippling taxes. If we fix the system now, people will have time to plan accordingly, to ensure that they still have a comfortable retirement. If we wait, we make the problem worse and, in effect, lie to Americans who we encouraged to put their trust in a broken system. I have long supported supplementing the current Social Security system with personal accounts – but not as a substitute for addressing benefit promises that cannot be kept. People of good faith in both parties agree that we must make the hard decisions to restore solvency to these programs and that personal accounts can ease the impact of slower benefit growth &#8230; But the answer to these deficits is not to raise new taxes or repeal tax cuts but to restrain our spending habits. If the federal government can’t be funded with current revenues than we must reduce its size.</p></blockquote>
<p>The best that can be said about these claims is that Senator McCain is not arguing there is some magical free lunch.  But he is flat wrong that moving to personal accounts will solve the deficit problem.  He is also wrong that the Social Security system is broken.  Rather it’s the General Fund that is in massive deficit as Greg’s former boss promised massive tax cuts and a prescription drug benefit. Finally, the Senator is wrong about not being able to pay for the prescription drug benefit with tax increases.  But at least the Senator is not trying to sell us that we can have our cake and eat it too, which Greg’s former boss is still saying.</p>

<blockquote>On Meet the Press, Tim Russert noted that National Review White House correspondent Byron York is &#8220;a conservative writer,&#8221; but then added that York is &#8220;an interesting, objective observer of American politics,&#8221; without elaborating on the term &#8220;objective.&#8221; Media Matters for America has documented numerous instances of conservative misinformation from York.</p></blockquote>
<p>Even if one did not know anything about York’s past misstatements, following his attempt to smear Markos Moulitsas on <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/13189411">Sunday’s show</a> would have given one a clear indication of the garbage that York is infamous for:<br />
<blockquote>Now, the problem is, is that we don’t really know how representative they are of the entire Democratic coalition. For example, black voters are a huge part of the Democratic coalition, and Internet activists are overwhelmingly white &#8230; But, you know, as far as the, the strength of the so-called net roots, a writer a while back called Markos Moulitsas a king-maker, to which another blogger, Mickey Kaus, replied, “Yeah? Name the king.” The fact is, is that they &#8211; Markos and the Daily Kos has lent its support to more than a dozen candidates in the past couple of years and none of them have won &#8230; in Connecticut where they’re, they’re supporting Ned Lamont against Senator Joseph Lieberman. And if you were out here at the convention, you almost got the sense that they would rather defeat Lieberman in a primary than the Republican candidate in the fall.</p></blockquote>
<p>But the really interesting thing about this transcript is not the childish behavior of Byron York or the goofy comment from Tim Russert but rather it was the very professional and able manner in which Markos Moulitsas handled himself.  Which reminds me – I should pay more attention to <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/">his blog</a>.</p>

<blockquote>What was the relationship between Saddam Hussein&#8217;s inner circle and Islamic terrorists? A newly released document appears to provide evidence that in 1999 the Taliban welcomed &#8220;Islamic relations with Iraq&#8221; to mediate among the Taliban, the Northern Alliance and Russia, and that the Taliban invited Iraqi officials to Afghanistan.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Shocking!</strong>  The leaders of Afghanistan wanted to discuss matters with the leaders of Iraq.  After all – we should never allow two heads of state that shared the same religion to discuss anything.  </p>
<p>Of course, the Northern Alliance was the Afghan group that our military worked with to topple the Taliban.  Two days before 9/11, al Qaeda took out the leader of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmed_Shah_Massoud">Northern Alliance</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Massoud was the victim of a suicide attack which occurred at Khuaja Bahaodine on September 9, 2001, two days before the September 11, 2001 terrorist attack in the United States, a timing considered significant by some commentators who believe Osama bin Laden ordered the assassination to ensure he would have the Taliban&#8217;s protection and cooperation in Afghanistan. The attackers were two Arabs who claimed to be Belgians originally from Morocco or Tunisian. However their passports turned out to be stolen. According to some accounts they were posing as journalists, perhaps intending to attack several Northern Alliance council members simultaneously.</p></blockquote>
<p>I guess we have found yet another thing that <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=YmMwZTUwMzRmNDExMzAyMzVmYTRhYWI0ZjA5MTUxMGY=">Jonah Goldberg</a> does not understand.</p>

There’s not much substance in his latest rant, but I did manage to find this:</p>
<blockquote><p>We now tax their incomes as salary, corporate profits, dividends, capital gains, and at death. But we must do better.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hmm – income defined as labor income (salary) plus capital income (which includes both dividends and capital gains).  Now if actually did tax all capital income at the same rate as labor income and taxed at when it accrues, we would be doing better.  But Kudlow’s “investor class” cronies oppose such sensible tax reform as they prefer deferral gimmicks and favorable rates as to the taxation of capital income.  Take a deep breathe Larry before you propose a sensible tax reform that I might actually agree with.</p>

                                <p>While we <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/06/celebrating-demise-of-zarqawi-by.html">noted</a> how Jonah Goldberg smeared Congressman Murtha, we also join Duncan Black (who awarded Goldberg Wanker of the Day for his dishonesty) in tipping the hat to <a href="http://yglesias.tpmcafe.com/node/30673">Matthew Yglesias</a>: <br />
<blockquote>Jonah Goldberg misquotes John Murtha, truncating his statement in a manner that substantially alters the meaning. Following up, he justifies his action by noting that The New York Times did the same thing later. We&#8217;re not even in &#8220;two wrongs don&#8217;t make a right&#8221; territory here. I suppose this is the logic by which so many people feel comfortable misrepresenting what Al Gore said about the Internet. Since everyone&#8217;s misquoting him, it&#8217;s okay for everyone to misquote him. Something like that.</p></blockquote>
<p>Shorter Matt – Jonah is a serial liar but then that’s the job description when you write for the National Review.  Well it seems <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=ZTdiNjU1MGMwYjliNzllZDc1YTRhMGYxYTdiMWY5NmU=">Goldberg</a> is at it again:<br />
<blockquote>But my first reaction to the news that Murtha intends to run for Majority Leader if the Dems take back the Congress was that it&#8217;s a shrewd calculation to rev-up the base. Murtha is the leader of the bug-out of Iraq caucus. If Murtha makes it clear that a vote for a  Democratic Congress is a vote for a bug-out leadership, that might rally the Democratic shock troops and/or leftwing donors.  If they took back Congress, they could claim, openly or with some nuance, that the &#8217;06 election was a referendum on the war.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let me admit that I’ve been with Howard Dean all along on this issue, which put me on the opposite end of the spectrum from Murtha.  Dean realized in 2002 two thing that Jonah Goldberg is incapable of understanding: (1) President Bush and his team were lying to us about the imminent threat nonsense; and (2) our invading Iraq was a victory for Osama bin Laden.  But after this utterly stupid decision was made, it did seem prudent to follow the Joe Biden lead of finishing the task.</p>
<p>But Biden, Dean, and yours truly were making one rather stupid assumption – that this Administration might be capable of finishing the task.  Murtha has shown great courage – something else beyond Goldberg’s ability to comprehend – in admitting his 2002 position was wrong (yes- Howard Dean was right in 2002).  And I have changed my mind – the Bush Administration has so badly managed the post invasion process in Iraq, for us to stay allows for more victories for Osama bin Laden.  </p>
<p>I’ll admit that bugging out will also be seen as a victory for Osama bin Laden.  But some of us were saying back in 2002 that invading Iraq would be us precisely in the lose, lose situation that permeates the discussion today.  For our wisdom back then – the demagogues who support this White House called us traitors.  Stupidity as patriotism and foresight as treason.  Par for the course at the National Review.</p>
<p><strong>Footnote</strong>: In case you are wondering how the New York Times got dragged into the discussion of Goldberg’s dishonesty, look at <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=Nzk5NGE5NGUzNzQ4ZWY5ODU1M2RkYjMxYTM1YzQzNzc=">this</a>:<br />
<blockquote>So all day, I&#8217;ve been getting what I think is pretty baseless and silly grief from lefty readers ridiculing my lack of integrity &#8230; I guess that right wing New York Times is part of the problem, too. </p></blockquote>
<p>We accurately cite Goldberg’s own post and he calls this baseless?  The problem with blaming his dishonesty on the New York Times goes back to what Goldberg linked and it was not the New York Times inaccurate characterization of the interview but another source that did accurately capture what Murtha said.  Goldberg is either being dishonest about his dishonesty or is being incredibly stupid.</p>

Clarke</a> defend CEO compensation in part by claiming that the granting of employee stock options is like handing out free money.  He notes the compensation package of the retired chairman of Exxon Mobil, Lee Raymond:<br />
<blockquote>On this last point, options are typically granted from time to time at an exercise price equal to the market price of the stock on the date of the grant. At some point (often after 10 years), the options must be exercised, or they will be forfeited … But here’s what’s most important: In this example, the company paid the CEO a total of $12.5 million &#8211; not $69.7 million. The $57.2 million difference is a gain in the value of the shares earned by this CEO’s stewardship of the company. Importantly, the rest of the company’s shareholders (including, but not limited to, your pension plan and your mother’s trust fund) realized the same proportionate gain.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2006/06/free_lunch_for_.html">Mark Thoma</a> reads this sentence, watches his head explode, but manages to put himself back together to write something a lot more coherent:<br />
<blockquote>You are the CEO of a company but instead of paying you in cash, the company gives you an option to buy, say, 1,000 shares of stock any time during the next ten years at the current $100 price ($100,000 total). Over the next ten years, suppose the price of the stock increases to $250 so the 1,000 shares are worth $250,000 and the CEO exercises the option at the end of the ten year period. The easiest way to think about this is to imagine the company going out and buying the stock on the market at $250 per share at the end of the ten year period (if it purchased them in the past, the $250 is still the opportunity cost). Since the company receives $100 per share from the CEO, the option price, the company loses $150 per share, or $150,000. The argument is that &#8220;compensating [CEOs] &#8230; has not come at the expense of company profits.&#8221; Where do the writers of this commentary think the money comes from if it isn&#8217;t from the company&#8217;s bottom line?</p></blockquote>
<p>Given the fact that companies often avoid stock dilution by purchasing shares when employees exercise these options, there is indeed a cash outflow as Mark suggests.  While Mark follows Nugent &#038; Clarke in terms of looking at the ex post value of the options, let’s use this <a href="http://www.blobek.com/black-scholes.html">Black-Scholes calculator</a> to think in terms of the ex ante value of an option with a 10-year term.  If the strike price equals the initial market price of the shares, which is $100 in Mark’s example, and if we assume no dividends, an interest rate of 5%, and volatility  = 20 (ConocoPhillip’s 10-K was suggesting 22.5), the ex ante value of these options would be around $45.  Not exactly a free lunch – is it?  Now if you read carefully, the 10-K filing I was using, you might have noticed that the expected life of ConocoPhillip’s options were 7.18 not 10 so maybe we should assume an option price of only $37.  You might have also noticed that these types of companies pay out dividends to shareholders to the shareholders, so that the simple Black-Scholes equation overstates the true value of these options.  </p>
<p>But if Nugent &#038; Clarke think that issuing options to CEOs does not have a cost to the shareholders of the company, there are not qualified to write about executive compensation.  Which is of course why they get to write for the National Review.</p>
