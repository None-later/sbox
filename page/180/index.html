                                <p>by <strong><a href="http://presimetrics.com/">Mike Kimel</a></strong></p>
<p>I had a few posts noting that not long ago, I took a severance package from my most recent employer. Put another way, I&#8217;m now unemployed.  Since then I&#8217;ve been looking for a new job.</p>
<p>However, in recent weeks I&#8217;ve started taking consulting work, and I&#8217;m starting to lean more toward consulting.  I was a consultant for seven and a half years before taking my most recent job, and I function as easily as a consultant as I do in the corporate world.   Put another way &#8211; I am not uncomfortable with the feast or famine environment in consulting though, truth to tell, my wife would strongly prefer that I had a &#8220;real&#8221; job.  But I digress.  </p>
<p>A big part of the reason I&#8217;m starting to lean toward consulting is that while I haven&#8217;t cracked the job market, some consulting work has come my way without my having sought it out.  Unrequited love v. unsolicited love, or if you can&#8217;t be with the one you love, love the one you&#8217;re with, right?  And when I say I haven&#8217;t cracked the job market, I have to say, something about the job market seems very wrong to me.  I keep hearing that companies are having a hard time finding qualified candidates.  A random search of the news spits out <a href="http://www.superiortelegram.com/event/article/id/58340/group/News/">several</a> <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/breaking/chi-caterpillar-ceo-says-company-cant-find-enough-skilled-workers-20110912,0,7463843.story">such</a> <a href="http://blog.laptopmag.com/shortage-of-qualified-employees-poses-big-challenge">stories</a>.<br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>I would like to relate my experience in the matter.  This morning I went to indeed.com, which has rapidly become my favorite job search site.  I entered some appropriate job search parameters, and found a job that I&#8217;ve applied to twice in the past three months.  It looks a lot like the requirement bullet points come straight from my resume:  advanced degree, a fair amount of experience developing analytic tools (e.g., data mining), experience building and leading cross-functional teams, and experience with strategic planning.  I can&#8217;t find anything on the job req that I don&#8217;t have on my resume, except that in each case I have more experience at a higher level than the req specifies.   And as I said, I&#8217;ve applied for that position.  Twice.  And it seems it has appeared on the company&#8217;s website again.   That means the ad wasn&#8217;t written as ex post justification for hiring a specific person &#8211; the company at least believes it is genuinely looking to fill the spot without an internal candidate already penciled in.  </p>
<p>Now, I&#8217;m not saying that the company should hire me.  Perhaps there is something about the position that isn&#8217;t in the req that makes it clear I don&#8217;t fit in.  And perhaps there are many others that are far more qualified than I am (though I like to think I am very, very good at building statistical tools, and even better at management and strategy).  But either way, I would imagine that my resume would have tripped up some sort of a &#8220;call this guy and feel him out for five minutes&#8221; routine in their &#8220;applicant tracking software.&#8221;  There are other similar positions that I&#8217;ve seen crop up several times since I&#8217;ve applied, but two of them really bother me as they also include a phrase like &#8220;knowledge of Spanish, Portuguese preferred.&#8221;  Now, I grew up in Brazil and have family in Argentina so I have spent considerable time in South America.  I speak Spanish and Portuguese.  That&#8217;s on my resume, as is the fact that I have international work experience.  The companies advertising those positions didn&#8217;t call me back either.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I&#8217;ve had calls and e-mails from employers looking for someone to a) sell insurance, b) provide financial education to union members and/or Hispanics and/or other groups, c) for entry level positions, and d) for an executive chef.  What in my resume screams &#8220;executive chef&#8221; I have no idea.  None whatsoever.  Good for a laugh, but not really.  It&#8217;s a waste of my time, and there are people out there who are qualified to be an executive chef and are searching for that job and aren&#8217;t getting a call.  My guess is that someone seeking out an executive chef position may be getting calls about upper level management positions in Analytics at a Fortune 500 company.    </p>
<p>Which leads to a hypothesis.  It may be that there is not so much a mismatch between the skills that the unemployed have <em>vis à vis</em> the needs of companies as there is an inability of companies, and in particular, the Human Resources department of companies, to recognize the needed skills when they see them.  I&#8217;ve met many HR people over the years, and while many are competent, a frightening number of them are not.  I remember, as a hiring manager, learning that I had to bypass my company&#8217;s HR department altogether if I wanted to get resumes that had any bearing to my group&#8217;s needs.  But I could only do that because my boss was very sympathetic.  He had found me without using HR too.  </p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>I note <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/09/health-insurance-american-style.html">this recent post on Health Insurance</a> also says something about some of HR&#8217;s other functionalities.  </p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>PS &#8211; Need a consultant with expertise in analytics and forecasting, and who can explain what it means to your business in simple (and actionable) English (or Portuguese or Spanish)? Someone with a Ph.D. in economics and 15 years experience in pricing, risk, demand analysis, and corporate strategy?  Perhaps with strong knowledge of some of the big South American markets?  Someone with experience in litigation support?  Drop me a line at &#8220;mike&#8221; period &#8220;kimel&#8221; (one m only!!) at gmail.com.  Alternatively, &#8220;mike&#8221; at analyticecon.com will get to me too.  </p>
<p>Also, my wife started cleaning up my old consulting practice website:  www.analyticeconomics.com (or www.analyticecon.com).   Any suggestions about the website, or about generating new business, are welcome.</p>

                                <p>In <a href="http://crookedtimber.org/2011/09/24/the-poverty-of-rationality/#more-21757">this excellent post</a>, John Quiggin somewhat understates his claim</p>
<p>The key passage</p>
<p>&#8220;the same fundamental confusion I pointed out last time, trying to claim that rationality assumptions are both important and unfalsifiable.&#8221;</p>
<p>and later at greater length</p>
<p>&#8220;Williamson wants to have his cake and eat it. Most of the time he wants to help himself to the strong implications of rationality as represented in standard micro texts, and to demand that macro be built on this basis. But, when this model is challenged on empirical grounds, he retreats to a concept of rationality that is tautologically true. This is a classic example of John H’s “two-step of terrific triviality”.&#8221;</p>
<p>My problem is that, while the concept of rationality is tautologically true, Quiggin is reluctant to stick to that claim.  Instead he flirts with qualifications involving consistency or regularity. </p>
<p>&#8220;a brief, purely mathematical point. Any consistent pattern of choice among objects (of any kind) that we can observe, can be represented as optimization, that is, as the maximization of a function. &#8220;</p>
<p>So far the truth but not the whole truth, since the claim is true without the qualifier &#8220;consistent.&#8221;  The reason is simple.  If there is no limit on the class of functions to be maximized then calender time can be an argument of the function.  In other words if I have to assume that the function of X being maximized changes over time, I can just interpret it a one function of time and X.</p>

<p>Quiggin knows this. He writes &#8220;Even choices that are inconsistent in various ways can be represented by more general notions of optimization.&#8221;  I&#8217;d go a bit further.  This claim means that *some* apparently inconsistent choices can be represented as optimization, but, in fact, all choices can be represented as optimization.</p>
<p>The proof by contradiction is elementary.  Assume that there is a non-empty set S of series of actions which is inconsistent with maximizing any utility function at all.  Consider a hypothetical agent whose sole desire in life is to make things difficult for rational choice modelers.  The agent has a utility function which yields one util if the agent chooses an series of actions in S and 0 otherwise.  It is optimal for the agent to chose a series of actions in S.  But S was the set of series of actions which are not optimal for any utility function.  This is a contradiction.  Thus I have proven that S is empty.  </p>
<p>There is no series of actions which can not be reconciled with utility maximization.  </p>
<p>There can be no doubt that this claim is true.  You have just read a rigorous proof.</p>

                                <p>By <a href="http://www.economonitor.com/blog/author/rwilder3">Rebecca Wilder</a></p>
<p><strong>This ‘Competitiveness’ Thing Is a Scam</strong>
<p>What is ‘competitiveness’? It’s an important part of the euro area leaders’ negotiated terms in the <a href="http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/en/ec/123978.pdf">July 21st Summit announcement </a>by the European Heads of State. The first paragraph, #4, and #11 of the announcement all refer to this issue of ‘competitiveness’:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>We also reaffirm our determination to reinforce convergence, competitiveness and governance in the euro area.       <br />…        <br />create a Task Force which will work with the Greek authorities to target the structural funds on competitiveness and growth, job creation and training.        <br />…        <br />All euro area Member States will adhere strictly to the agreed fiscal targets, improve competitiveness and address macro-economic imbalances.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s not totally clear what they mean by ‘competitiveness.’ However, I note that they separate the term ‘competitiveness’ from ‘macro-economic imbalances’. Current account imbalances across the region should be included in addressing ’macro-economic imbalances’.      <a name="more"></a> <br />Therefore, it’s bigger than the OECD definition of <a href="http://stats.oecd.org/glossary/detail.asp?ID=399">international competitiveness </a>&#8211; <em>measure of a country’s advantage or disadvantage in selling its products in international markets</em>.</p>
<p>See, ‘competitiveness’ is an elusive concept that is often associated with relative price movements, real exchange rates, or openness to international trade. But if we look at a May 2011 speech given by German Finance Minister, Wolfgang Schäuble, what he (and by association, the Germans) thinks of ‘competitiveness becomes more clear (h/t <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2011/09/marshall-auerback-the-ecb-v-germany.html">Marshall Auerback</a> and bold by yours truly):</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“All Eurozone governments need not only convincingly demonstrate their commitment to fiscal consolidation but also to increasing competitiveness to restore confidence of markets as well as their citizens.</em>      <br /><em>…</em>      <br /><em>Besides, one does not resolve one’s own problems of competitiveness by asking others to become less competitive and one cannot permanently close the gap between expenditure and income by asking others for more money.</em>      <br /><em>…</em>      <br /><em>the Eurozone has to put additional emphasis on strengthening the competitiveness of </em><em>all its members. <strong>Consumption developments, bubbles in housing markets and the </strong></em><em><strong>accumulation of external and internal debt </strong>in some Member States deepened the impact of the </em><em>crisis and constrained the capacity to respond. This is why a new procedure for detecting </em><em>and correcting economic imbalances will be introduced. This procedure will concentrate on </em><em><strong>curing the root causes of macroeconomic deficits by forcing Member States to ensure a high </strong><strong>level of competitiveness</strong>.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Competitiveness is about strong macro-prudential policy, infrastructure, efficiency and income gains, saving, etc. Schäuble used the word ‘comopetitiveness’ 14 times in this speech – it’s an important part of his (and perhaps more broadly Germany’s) vision of the euro area’s structural construct. After reading the speech, you realize ‘competitiveness’ isn’t just about international trade and exports, it’s about the efficiency of an economy as a whole.</p>
<p>Now we’re on to something. The <a href="http://www.weforum.org/">World Economic Forum </a>measures competitiveness as a composite of various factors that describe institutions, infrastructure, macroeconomic environment, health and primary education, higher education and training, goods market efficiency, labor market efficiency, financial market development, technological readiness, market size, business sophistication, and innovation (.pdf <a href="http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GCR_Report_2011-12.pdf">link here</a>, and composite technicals listed on .pdf page 49). The chart below illustrates the rankings of the euro area 12 and the USA (for comparison) as measured by the percentage of countries that rank below it across 142 developing and developed economies (.pdf page 15).</p>
<p><em>(Click to enlarge chart)</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2011/09/competitiveness_chart.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2011/09/competitiveness_chart.jpg" width="585" height="435"></a></p>
<p>In 2011-2012, Germany ranks #6 out of 142 countries, where 95 of the 142 countries are less competitive than Germany. Also ranked below Germany is every euro area economy except Finland. So when a German finance minister says that he wants economies to increase competitiveness, he’s effectively saying that he wants economies to be more German. From the bottom up, countries should reform their education, financial markets, business sophistication, innovation, etc., all the while emulating those institutions in Germany.</p>
<p>Better put: being asked to increase competitiveness is really a scam to get these economies to become more ‘German’. If I were Italy or Spain or even Ireland (who by the way is very open but less ‘competitive’ according to this measure), I’d have a problem with that.</p>

<p>Free market mechanics and healthcare…</strong></p>
<p>Now, I hear something all the time in my work in the health policy realm, and that is that the “free market” could lower prices. </p>
<p>I even recently had someone approach me after I mentioned that the PPACA had resulted in an extra million people aged 18-25 having health coverage this year.  His statement? “That’s exactly the wrong direction, we need to have less people, far less people with health insurance.” I asked him his reasoning…of course, already knowing what his response would be. He reasoned that it would force people to compare prices, shop around, and would dramatically lower prices through the mythical, magical “free market”….</p>
<p>Of course, this ignores some rather real problems with this line of thinking.  For starters, healthcare does not behave like normal commodities for a variety of reasons. </p>
<p>To start with, healthcare does not lend itself to price comparisons, and comparison shopping. The high costs are often related to trauma and emergency care/hospitalizations. It is simply not practical to ask which hospital in the area offers the best rates on cardiac catheterizations while you are being rushed to the hospital in the midst of an MI.  <br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>This impracticality also lends itself to probably the biggest problem. That is irrational behavior.  Any of us who have taken even undergraduate economics remember the discussions of rational actors, and how prices were sensitive to rational behavior.  Much of health care involves emotionally charged, heated, and oftentimes difficult decisions. Most patients and families can hardly be expected to act in a rational fashion about receiving the news of a terrible diagnosis such as cancer.  Real world experience reveals this to be true. I wish I could count how many times I have presented various treatment options to patients, only to hear “Do whatever it takes”. </p>
<p>Hayek once wrote that spontaneous order was a result of market economies, and that it was “a more efficient allocation of societal resources than any design could achieve.” This of course, assumes rational behavior, and assumes that a market can be symmetric.</p>
<p>Because of this behavior, and because people view healthcare not as optional, but as a necessity, price elasticity scores generally trend around 0 or -1. This indicates an inelastic market. </p>
<p>Of course, the next time I have a 21 year old kid who comes in after a farm accident without insurance, and is badly injured, I’ll make sure to tell him that perhaps he should have shopped around.</p>

                                <p>The lead article in the current AER is <a href="http://www.aeaweb.org/articles.php?doi=10.1257/aer.101.5.1649">available here</a> (gated, apparently, though the link isn&#8217;t working; h/t Tom Bozzo [on FB] and <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2011/09/coal-fueled-power-as-a-value-subtracting-industry.html">Brad DeLong</a>; I was using the paper copy). The most interesting part so far: the authors only considered the documented costs of <em>air</em> pollution—<strong>not</strong> land, <strong>not</strong> water—in deriving the (embarrassingly negative) ROI figures for coal and oil.</p>
<p>As Cousin Lucia and Tom Zeller, Jr., note today, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/09/30/keystone-pipeline-meetings-nebraska_n_988203.html">the cost of water pollution makes oil power plants an even worse option</a>.</p>
<p>In such a context, Europe in general and Germany (the top maker of solar panels until China recently passed them) in particular <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-09-29/utilities-giving-away-power-as-wind-sun-flood-european-grid.html">rubs in our faces that they&#8217;re winning on the alternative-energy sources front</a> (h/t Barry Ritholtz):</p>
<blockquote><p>The 15 mile-per-hour winds that buffeted northern Germany on July 24 caused the nation’s 21,600 windmills to generate so much power that utilities such as EON AG and RWE AG (RWE) had to pay consumers to take it off the grid. </p>
<p>Rather than an anomaly, the event marked the 31st hour this year when power companies lost money on their electricity in the intraday market because of a torrent of supply from wind and solar parks. The phenomenon was unheard of five years ago.</p></blockquote>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />Meanwhile, back in the U.S., it is no secret that Brad and Robert Waldmann are on one (affirmative) side of the TARP-was-a-success argument, and I&#8217;m on the other.* But even the Success crowd may pause to wonder <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/2011/09/30/business-us-usa-bailout-banks-idUKTRE78T0GR20110930">if the short-term &#8220;profit&#8221; was a good long-term strategy</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Some large U.S. banks would have stronger capital bases to better deal with today&#8217;s market stresses had regulators not relaxed bailout repayment criteria in late 2009, a new government audit showed on Friday.</p>
<p>Bank of America (BAC.N) Citigroup (C.N), Wells Fargo (WFC.N) and PNC Financial (PNC.N) were allowed exit the Troubled Asset Relief Program without raising as much equity capital as initially prescribed by the Federal Reserve, the TARP Special Inspector General said in the report.</p>
<p>Following bank stress tests earlier in 2009, the Fed gave several banks guidance that they must raise $1 in common equity for every $2 in TARP bailout funds repaid &#8212; a formula meant to enable them to withstand future stresses.</p>
<p>But this standard &#8212; which was never previously made public &#8212; was quickly relaxed, allowing Bank of America, Citi and Wells Fargo to repay taxpayers nearly simultaneously in <strong>December 2009</strong>,** raising a combined $49.1 billion in equity capital.</p>
<p>Enforcement of the $1 in equity for every $2 repaid guidance would have required $57.5 billion in equity capital to be raised by the three institutions. PNC was later allowed to exit TARP under similar relaxed guidance. [emphasis mine]</p></blockquote>
<p>The most <a href="http://www.sigtarp.gov/reports.shtml">recent SIGTARP report</a> (28 July 2011), uses the word &#8220;Bailout&#8221; only once in its 304 pages—and that&#8217;s in the title of testimony by Sheila Bair, &#8220;“Statement of Sheila C. Bair, Chairman, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation on The Changing Role of the FDIC before the Subcommittee on TARP, Financial Services, and Bailouts of Public and Private Programs; Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, U.S. House Of Representatives.”</p>

Yet when the most visible and successful Management Consultancy in the United States thinks about growth, its <a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/en/Features/Growth/What_business_can_do_to_restart_growth.aspx">two primary points </a>are &#8220;take monies from the government&#8221; and &#8220;expand small businesses.&#8221; But give them credit for recognizing a point that is often obscured by <s>H1-B trolls</s> technology firm leaders such as Meg Whitman:<br />
<blockquote>[I]t’s not just the young who can help fill the skills gap; older, experienced workers can play a part, too. In the US aerospace sector, 60 percent of the workforce is over 45. A practical response would be for governments to remove barriers—<strong>particularly those related to the provision of health care and to benefits rules</strong>—that prevent older workers from staying in the workforce longer. Germany and the Netherlands raised the participation rate of the 55-to-64 age group by 21 and 24 percentage points, respectively, between 1990 and 2009. In the Netherlands, there were significant changes to pensions and welfare benefits to improve incentives to work longer, coupled with initiatives to change public perceptions, improve employability, and reduce discrimination against older workers.

<p>It&#8217;s nice to see McKinsey endorsing Medicare For All.</p>
<p>*As a general rule, the Econ-first analysts are affirmatives, the finance-grounded ones are negative. If you have to think about why that would be: one group makes its living finding $100 bills on the sidewalk that the other one swears cannot exist.  As the Mark Thomas of the world would note, the issue of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prior_probability">priors</a> might need to be addressed.</p>
<p>**The reason December 2009 is important is that it meant that monies that otherwise would have to have been used to shore up capital were instead paid out as bonuses by the now-uncontrolled banks, or, in Reuterspeak, &#8220;keen to escape executive compensation restrictions associated with the bailout funds.&#8221;</p>

                                <p>Brad DeLong points us to a post from The Nation on early Koch brothers and Hayek <a target="_blank" href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2011/09/the-road-to-serfdom.html">The Road to Serfdom!!</a></p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.thenation.com/article/163672/charles-koch-friedrich-hayek-use-social-security?utm_source=dlvr.it&#038;utm_medium=twitter&#038;page=full">Yasha Levine and Mark Ames</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Charles Koch to Friedrich Hayek: Use Social Security!: [I]n early June 1973, weeks after [Charles] Koch was appointed president of the Institute for Humane Studies. Along with his brothers, Koch inherited his father’s privately held oil company in 1967…. Koch invited Hayek to serve as the institute’s “distinguished senior scholar” in preparation for its first conference on Austrian economics, to be held in June 1974.</p>
<p>Hayek initially declined Koch’s offer. In a letter to IHS secretary Kenneth Templeton Jr., dated June 16, 1973, Hayek explains that he underwent gall bladder surgery in Austria earlier that year, which only heightened his fear of “the problems (and costs) of falling ill away from home.” (Thanks to waves of progressive reforms, postwar Austria had near universal healthcare and robust social insurance plans that Hayek would have been eligible for.)<br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>IHS vice president George Pearson (who later became a top Koch Industries executive) responded three weeks later, conceding that it was all but impossible to arrange affordable private medical insurance for Hayek in the United States. However, thanks to research by Yale Brozen, a libertarian economist at the University of Chicago, Pearson happily reported that “social security was passed at the University of Chicago while you [Hayek] were there in 1951. You had an option of being in the program. If you so elected at that time, you may be entitled to coverage now.”</p>
<p>A few weeks later, the institute reported the good news: Professor Hayek had indeed opted into Social Security while he was teaching at Chicago…. He was eligible…. On August 10, 1973, Koch wrote a letter appealing to Hayek to accept a shorter stay at the IHS, hard-selling Hayek on Social Security’s retirement benefits, which Koch encouraged Hayek to draw on even outside America. He also assured Hayek that Medicare, which had been created in 1965 by the Social Security amendments as part of Lyndon Johnson’s Great Society programs, would cover his medical needs…. [T]aking on the unlikely role of Social Security Administration customer service rep, Koch adds, “In order to be eligible for medical coverage you must apply during the registration period which is anytime from January 1 to March 31. For your further information, I am enclosing a pamphlet on Social Security.”</p></blockquote>

                                <p>by <strong><a href="http://presimetrics.com/">Mike Kimel</a></strong></p>
<p>It has been a very long time since I looked at the National Review. Apparently it is still there.</p>
<p>Jonah Goldberg (apparently also still there) had <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/277788/tyranny-typical-jonah-goldberg">a post</a> that begins like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>And now let us recall the “Fable of the Shoes.”</p>
<p>In his 1973 Libertarian Manifesto, the late Murray Rothbard argued that the biggest obstacle in the road out of serfdom was “status quo bias.” In society, we’re accustomed to rapid change. “New products, new life styles, new ideas are often embraced eagerly.” Not so with government. When it comes to police or firefighting or sanitation, government must do those things because that&#8217;s what government has (allegedly) always done.</p>
<p>“So identified has the State become in the public mind with the provision of these services,” Rothbard laments, “that an attack on State financing appears to many people as an attack on the service itself.” The libertarian who wants to get the government out of a certain business is “treated in the same way as he would be if the government had, for various reasons, been supplying shoes as a tax-financed monopoly from time immemorial.”</p>
<p>If everyone had always gotten their shoes from the government, writes Rothbard, the proponent of shoe privatization would be greeted as a kind of lunatic. “How could you?” defenders of the status quo would squeal. “You are opposed to the public, and to poor people, wearing shoes! And who would supply shoes . . . if the government got out of the business? Tell us that! Be constructive! It’s easy to be negative and smart-alecky about government; but tell us who would supply shoes? Which people? How many shoe stores would be available in each city and town? . . . What material would they use? . . . Suppose a poor person didn&#8217;t have the money to buy a pair?”</p></blockquote>
<p>All that is true. But what Rothbard apparently didn&#8217;t get, and no doubt Goldberg doesn&#8217;t either, is that it goes the other way too. If people always got their shoes from the private sector, it would never occur to anyone that the government might provide shoes. Now it might seem stupid for the government to be in the business of footwear distribution, and in general, outside of the military, my guess is that it is.</p>
<p>But sometimes a different approach is what works. Sometimes when the government is doing things, it is doing them inefficiently and the private sector can do better. But sometimes it goes the other way. Sometimes when the private sector is doing things, it is doing them inefficiently and the government can do better. And sometimes, sometimes its a good idea for things to be done worse, and in a way that only the government can.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll give you an example. I&#8217;ve noted a few times that you can stroll into most car dealerships in Brazil today and buy a tri-flex car. That is, the same car can run on any mix of gasoline, ethanol and natural gas. (There are two fuel tanks &#8211; one for ethanol and/or gasoline and one for natural gas.) You can then drive that vehicle into any number of fueling stations and fill up with whatever fuel is going to get you the most miles (er, kilometers) for your dollar (er, real). The technology to run cars on a number of different fuels, which you won&#8217;t see in the US for a very long time, is marketed under such exotic brand names as GM, Ford, Toyota, Honda, Volkswagen and Fiat to name a few. (Look &#8217;em up if you haven&#8217;t heard of &#8217;em.) </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve posted on how it came to be that <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2008/11/why-is-brazil-ahead-of-usfuel.html">Brazilians have choices that Americans do not</a>, namely to buy a tri-flex vehicle. The Brazilian government wanted to reduce the country&#8217;s dependence on gasoline, but it realized that nobody would buy a car that ran on a fuel other than gasoline if there was no place to buy that fuel, and hence no manufacturer would make such cars. The government also realized that Shell and Esso and Texaco (remember them?) weren&#8217;t going to start selling other types of fuel because there weren&#8217;t enough cars on the road that could use those fuels. But the Brazilian government owned an oil company that had a chain of gas stations. One fine day, that chain of gas stations started selling ethanol even though there was no market for it. It wasn&#8217;t profitable. It was insane. No private company would have done something that stupid. But the result, a few decades later, is that about <a href="http://www.anfavea.com.br/tabelas/autoveiculos/tabela10_producao.pdf">80% of cars sold in Brazil in 2010</a> were flex-fuel. Guess what percentage of cars sold in the US in 2010 were tri-flex?</p>
<p>Rothbard would never approve of what the Brazilian government did. Neither would Goldberg. Personally, I like having choices. I wish I could pick among three different fuels for my car and go with whichever is cheapest. I suspect that in a few decades, when that technology finally arrives in the US, Goldberg might like having those choices too.</p>

<p>Once again, Republicans intent on obstructing the normal operation of the federal government unless they can extract cuts to programs they don&#8217;t like (in the name of deficit reduction) applied the combination of House recalcitrance and Senate anti-majoritarian filibuster to threaten a government shutdown and siderail needed funding for emergency assistance to ordinary Americans until they could get at least some of their objectives. A compromise that will get money to FEMA and keep the government funded for a spell has been reached.</p>
