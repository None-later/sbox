<blockquote>It really makes one understand why the public often dismisses academics as out of touch in their ivory towers. One has to imagine that neither Mulligan nor Mankiw ever held a real summer job. Nor, apparently, have they looked at any other nonseasonally adjusted data. Nor do they appear to have much understanding of the basic ebb and flow of US economic activity over the course of the year&#8230;.</p>
<p>It seems to entirely escape them that aggregate demand has a very predictable season pattern &#8211; a seasonal pattern that exists in a recession or expansion.</p>
<p>These seasonal patterns in demand activity are not new. Indeed, I imagine that if the data existed, we would see the pattern has remained virtually unchanged since the dawn of human existence, as least in parts of the world where seasonal weather patterns govern economic life. Indeed, it is the reason we have an influx of teenage labor in the summer. It is a throwback to the days of America&#8217;s agricultural past, when the DEMAND for additional labor in the summer months necessitated closing schools for the summer.</p>
<p>As sure as the sun rises each day and winter turns to spring, sales spike at the end of the year as the holiday season approaches, collapse at the beginning of the year, rise in the summer, and then decline in the fall&#8230;</p>
<p>You can set your clock to this trend. Every retail analyst knows this trend. Every teenager who has ever held a summer job knows this trend. And a huge swath of data follows similar trends, albeit usually without the pronounced end of year impact. Building activity, waste disposal, tourism, you name it, it has a seasonal demand pattern. I only have to look out my ivory tower to see it &#8211; stuff grows faster in the summer, and the city hires crews of teenagers to cut it back. The pool down the road is open and staffed by teenage lifeguards only in the summer. Not because the lifeguards are available, but because there is no demand for an outdoor pool most of the year in Eugene.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>The Non-Relationship Between Interest Rates and the Money Supply, Part 2</strong><br />Cross-posted at the <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=138"><strong>Presimetrics Blog</strong></a>.</p>
<p>This post is a bit less about Presidents than usual, but its a follow-up to last week&#8217;s post on the non-relationship between the money supply and interest rates.  (That post appeared both at the <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=130">Presimetrics</a> and <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/08/non-relationship-between-interest-rates.html">Angry Bear</a> blogs.  In that post, I noted that the Federal Reserve tends to move the money supply monthly and seasonally with no corresponding change in the fed funds rate.  For example, the Fed will increase the money supply in December to make sure there&#8217;s adequate money in circulation for the Christmas shopping season, and yet interest rates don&#8217;t move at all.  </p>
<p>This week, I want to expand on that, and point out that I wasn&#8217;t entirely accurate.  There actually is a relationship between interest rates and the money supply, but its not the the one taught in textbooks.  The textbook relationship, as I noted last week, can be described like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Fed determines what the Federal Funds interest rate should be. If the Fed wants to reduce interest rates, it will create money out of thin air and use it to buy bonds. Because there is more money competing to buy bonds, the interest rate bonds have to pay falls. At the same time, the added money sloshing around becomes cheaper for anyone to borrow, whether they’re issuing bonds or not. On the flip side, if the Fed wants to raise interest rates, it sells bonds. That forces anyone else trying to sell bonds to raise interest rates to compete. Additionally, because the Fed retires the money it gets paid for the bonds it sells, that process reduces the amount of money available in the economy, making it harder to come by and hence more costly.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, the money supply and interest rates are negatively correlated.  An increase in money supply leads to a decrease in interest rates, and a decrease in the money supply leads to an increase in interest rates.  There is an alternative story, but it only applies to high inflation environments.  If you&#8217;re in Argentina in 1982, for example, the money supply is increasing so fast that any little bit of new money translates immediately into inflation and higher interest rates. </p>
<p>So there&#8217;s the theory, what everyone knows is true.  But what really happens?  For that, as always, we cut to the data.  The Federal Reserve&#8217;s Economic Database (FRED) reports the <a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/FEDFUNDS">federal funds rate going back to July of 1954</a>.  For the money supply, we used <a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/M1NS">M1</a> from 1959 to the present, and <a href="http://fraser.stlouisfed.org/publications/bms2/issue/60/download/102/section1.pdf">the money stock</a> for years before that.</p>
<p>The graph below shows the correlation between the 12 Month Percent Change in M1 and the Fed Funds rate in the same period, one month later, two months later, etc.:</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TGMQmkFnUUI/AAAAAAAAAWg/EKGUiQsz6CU/s1600/interest1.bmp"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TGMQmkFnUUI/AAAAAAAAAWg/EKGUiQsz6CU/s320/interest1.bmp" border="0" alt=""></a><br />Figure 1</p>
<p>The graph shows that the correlation between the percentage change in M1 over a year ending in a given month and the Fed Funds rate in the same month is about 14%.  The correlation between the annual percent change in M1 and the Fed Funds rate in the next month rises to 16%, and so forth.  The 1 year change in M1 has a higher correlation with the Fed Funds rate 36 months later than with any lag on the Fed Funds rate.  In plain English, increases in M1 lead to increases in the Fed Funds rate, and decreases in M1 lead to decreases in the Fed Funds rate.  That doesn&#8217;t sound at all the textbooks tell us we should expect in a world that isn&#8217;t suffering from hyperinflation.</p>
<p>Now, you may be thinking to yourself&#8230; maybe that relationship is a function of the fed trying to react to a slowing economy.  <br /><a name="more"></a><br />Strip out months in which the economy is in recession, plus the three months leading up to and the 3 months leading out of the recession, and the graph looks like this:</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TGMRHnjXOeI/AAAAAAAAAWo/IJWOsozeDo4/s1600/interest2.bmp"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TGMRHnjXOeI/AAAAAAAAAWo/IJWOsozeDo4/s320/interest2.bmp" border="0" alt=""></a><br />Figure 2.</p>
<p>Notice&#8230; the correlation drops a wee bit, but the shape of the curve is pretty much the same.  Once again, it is fairly evident that this does not conform in any way to the classic textbook story.  </p>
<p>So what is going on?  My guess is that in the U.S., for the period for which we have data, in general:</p>
<p>1.  changing the money supply has had no direct relationship on the Fed Funds rate<br />2.  changing the money supply has had a direct effect on the economy; increasing M1 (actually, real M1 per capita) causes the economy to grow more rapidly, and decreasing the real money supply causes the economy to grow more slowly or contract<br />3.  because increases in the (real) money supply cause the economy to grow more rapidly, eventually an increase in the money supply will lead the Fed to raise interest rates in an attempt to slow the economy (to avoid inflation).  On the other hand, because reductions in the (real) money supply lead to slower economic growth or economic contraction, these reductions will eventually lead the Fed to lower interest rates to try to get the economy to grow more quickly.  </p>
<p>Step 2 is something we cover in the book, but I hope to write another post showing that soon.</p>

<p>Calling high unemployment the “new normal” is a lazy way to cover up poor fiscal policy.</p>
<p>We are now starting to see the economic impact of the ‘new normal’ in practice, as Paul Krugman outlined the other day.   Having been bullied into adopting austerity measures apparently thinking they will help their economies grow, it is beginning to dawn on many “Austerian” governments that their embrace of hair shirt economics is beginning to undermine growth.</p>
<p>Exhibit A is the United Kingdom.  The NY Times gave an account of British towns “reeling” from the implementation of nationwide expenditure cuts of some $130 billion introduced in last June’s budget.   “A mass execution without appeal” is how the Times described it.</p>
<p>Along with this article comes a report from the Financial Times, “Economic Fears Rise as House Prices Dip”, documenting how UK house prices have began to fall for the first time in over a year this past July.  The article notes that this setback has come “after a year when the recovery in house prices surprised almost everyone and brought relief to Britain’s stretched banks, [so] the return of a buyers’ market threatens to increase jitters in a fragile economy.”</p>
<p>Well, to us neither today’s news about British municipalities reeling from the impact of the new Tory coalition government’s budget cuts, nor last year’s recovery in UK housing, was at all “surprising”.  Beset by the greatest financial crisis in the post World War II period, the last UK Labour Government  did what any sensible administration ought to do when there is not enough activity in the economy to maintain employment and labor force growth: they  increased public demand via increased net government spending.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />For all of the wailing about Britain’s “extraordinary” budget deficit, the policy response by the Brown Administration was in fact a good one.  By and large, it stabilized the economy and kept unemployment down to the 7% level.  In spite of the criticisms by the head of the Bank of England, the government made a very legitimate case that the rapid increase in government debt was an unavoidable consequence of the financial crisis (in itself the product of a private sector debt binge).  Yes, perhaps one could very well criticize the fact that a large number of the benefits accrued towards those experiencing the least disadvantage, but this does not invalidate the notion of deploying a government’s fiscal resources when confronted with a huge output gap and huge labor underutilization.</p>
<p>By the same token, attempts to mindlessly decrease alleged “government waste” (the new justification for the attack on the welfare state) in the context of ongoing high rates of unemployment is bound to lead to further economic weakness AND a higher public debt to GDP ratio, via a shrinking GDP.   Undoubtedly, some government expenditure is highly inefficient (although, in light of the plethora of private sector induced debt bubbles, it is hardly credible to argue that all spending from the private sector is invariably more efficient than government).</p>
<p>But the deficit as a whole is nothing more than an accounting expression of a gap between expenditures and receipts.  Complaining about this as “unsustainable” is analogous to blaming a football scoreboard, because it shows your team losing a game by 2 touchdowns, rather than focusing on the activity on the field which created the 2 touchdown gap in the first place.</p>
<p>In the UK (as in the USA), consumers are still trying to reduce their debt exposure and the saving ratio has been rising. So there is very little thirst for credit coming from that sector.  This is, then, a problem of aggregate demand deficiency, which can only be rectified via fiscal policy.  Unfortunately, for political reasons, that is impossible right now.  Neither the Federal Reserve, nor the Bank of England (two of the leading practitioners of “quantitative easing” in the past 18 months) can simply wave their magic “QE” wand and improve the economy via monetary policy.  Lower interest rates might lower the cost of borrowing (and help service a still large private sector debt overhang), but such a policy also steals income from savers, such as pensioners.  And in regard to overall aggregate demand, private businesses have to have positive expectations that they will be able to sell the output they produce. Those expectations remain subdued which is why the commercial banks in the US are still not lending very much, whilst prevailing high debt levels render further borrowing by consumers extremely problematic</p>
<p>Having publicly deprecated the impact of fiscal policy and warned of the long term deleterious effects of climbing public debt, of course, the Federal Reserve and/or the Bank of England cannot now reverse course and credibly back more fiscal stimulus.  To cover up the flaccid nature of their respective central banks’ ineffectual monetary policy response, a number of economists present the current high levels of unemployment as “structural”, implying that there is little that can be done about it. It is simply the “new normal”, which in reality represents the ultimate in political failure.  Our policy elites don’t dare concede the futility of fiscal austerity.  Hence,  they resort to invoking theories like the “equilibrium unemployment rate”, or “non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment “(NAIRU, for short), the implication being that attempts to reduce labor underutilization by expansionary fiscal policy would be inflationary in the absence of “structural reforms” , such as privatization, labor market deregulation, anti-union legislation and harsh welfare measures.   But these “supply side” measures in effect reflect the agenda preferences of the late 20th century, which have destroyed incomes and eviscerated the middle class. Our “new normal”, then, represents a collective shrug of our policymakers’ shoulders, ignoring a growing undercurrent of anger and despair.</p>

                                <p>Robert Reich lays out some figures for the military jobs programs both in manpower and hardware:</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://robertreich.org/post/938938180/americas-biggest-jobs-program-the-u-s-military">America’s biggest — and only major — jobs program</a> is the U.S. military.</p>
<blockquote><p>Over 1,400,000 Americans are now on active duty; another 833,000 are in the reserves, many full time. Another 1,600,000 Americans work in companies that supply the military with everything from weapons to utensils. (I’m not even including all the foreign contractors employing non-US citizens.)</p>
<p>If we didn’t have this giant military jobs program, the U.S. unemployment rate would be over 11.5 percent today instead of 9.5 percent.</p>
<p>And without our military jobs program personal incomes would be dropping faster. The Commerce Department reported Monday the only major metro areas where both net earnings and personal incomes rose last year were San Antonio, Texas, Virginia Beach, Virginia, and Washington, D.C. — because all three have high concentrations of military and federal jobs.</p>
<p>This isn’t an argument for more military spending. Just the opposite. Having a giant undercover military jobs program is an insane way to keep Americans employed. It creates jobs we don’t need but we keep anyway because there’s no honest alternative. We don’t have an overt jobs program based on what’s really needed.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>The Pentagon’s budget — and its giant undercover jobs program — keeps expanding. The President has asked Congress to hike total defense spending next year 2.2 percent, to $708 billion. That’s 6.1 percent higher than peak defense spending during the Bush administration.</p>
<p>This sum doesn’t even include Homeland Security, Veterans Affairs, nuclear weapons management, and intelligence. Add these, and next year’s national security budget totals about $950 billion.</p></blockquote>

                                <p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/11/business/economy/11leonhardt.html?_r=1&#038;partner=rss&#038;emc=rss">New York Times David Leonhardt argues</a> that real wages are rising, so those resilient workers that remain employed will benefit from the bounce-back in &#8220;effective pay&#8221;. The problem with this insight is twofold: first, the expansion phase of real hourly compensation, a broader measure of total earnings, is falling; and second, sitting atop a mountain of consumer and mortgage debt, the aggregate economy cannot afford a compensationless recovery.</p>
<p>From the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/11/business/economy/11leonhardt.html?_r=1&#038;partner=rss&#038;emc=rss">NY Times</a>:<br />
<blockquote>But since this recent recession began in December 2007, real average hourly pay has risen nearly 5 percent. Some employers, especially state and local governments, have cut wages. But many more employers have continued to increase pay.</p>
<p>Something similar happened during the Great Depression, notes Bruce Judson of the Yale School of Management. Falling prices meant that workers who held their jobs received a surprisingly strong effective pay raise.</p></blockquote>
<p>Rebecca: The referenced &#8220;real wages&#8221; are the <a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/realer.t02.htm">real average hourly earnings figures</a> for production and nonsupervisory workers, <a href="http://www.bls.gov/web/empsit/cestn1.htm">80% </a>of the total nonfarm payroll. The broader measure of total earnings is real hourly compensation (<a href="http://bls.gov/news.release/prod2.htm">see Table A</a> and get the data from the <a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/COMPRNFB?cid=2">Fred database</a>). Real hourly compensation measures compensation for all workers, including wages, 401k contributions, stock options, tips, and self-employed business owner compensation. (You can see a comparison of the earnings/compensation series in <a href="http://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2005/05/art1full.pdf">Exhibit 1 here.</a>)</p>
<p>Since December 2007, real hourly compensation has increased just 1.3%. Furthermore, the index declined four consecutive quarters through Q2 2010, a first since 1979-1980. If the <a href="http://www.nber.org/cycles/cyclesmain.html">NBER dates </a>the onset of the expansion at Q3 2009 (the first quarter of <a href="http://bea.gov/national/xls/gdplev.xls">po</a><a href="http://bea.gov/national/xls/gdplev.xls">sitive GDP growth</a> in 2009), real hourly compensation will have dropped .7% through Q2 2010! That&#8217;s pathetic compared to the average 2.5% gain during the first 4 quarters of expansion spanning the previous 10 recessions.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s how I see it: the problem is not that real hourly compensation is falling during the the recovery, per se, it&#8217;s that real hourly compensation is falling during the recovery of a  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Balance-Sheet-Recession-Uncharted-Implications/dp/0470821167">balance sheet recession.</a><a name="more"></a></p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/TGLatM1pgTI/AAAAAAAADMI/bqYqyVr36pQ/s1600/recovery_earnings_chart.PNG"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/TGLatM1pgTI/AAAAAAAADMI/bqYqyVr36pQ/s400/recovery_earnings_chart.PNG" alt="" border="0"></a>In the context of wage and compensation growth, the NY Times article was misleading in its comparison of the Great Depression to the &#8217;07-&#8217;09 Great Recession. Mass default during the Great Depression wiped private-sector balance sheets clean, no debt. But not this time around. <a href="http://www.newsneconomics.com/2010/04/reducing-household-financial-leverage.html">We&#8217;re going to need a lot of income growth</a> (the BLS measure of real hourly compensation includes measures of income at the BEA) to increase saving enough to deleverage the aggregate household balance sheet.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/08/consumer-confidence.html">I&#8217;ll say it again</a>: we can&#8217;t afford a jobless recovery. Specifically, we can&#8217;t afford a compensationless recovery.</p>

I have not done the calculation, but this will generate a significant downward revision of the second quarter real GDP report.  Remember, BEA does not have this data when they do the first GDP report.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/TGKhUsWxQAI/AAAAAAAABTA/FfITssfLHFU/s1600/Clipboard02.bmp"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/TGKhUsWxQAI/AAAAAAAABTA/FfITssfLHFU/s320/Clipboard02.bmp" alt="" border="0"></a>The plunge was driven by a 5.2% jump in real nonpetroleum imports although petroleum imports also rose 1.9%.  Since the May 2009 bottom, real nonpetroleum imports have risen some 31.9%.  Real petroleum imports are up 8.9% over the same period.  Real exports fell 1.6% and as the charts makes obvious they have been flat in recent months &#8212; they are actually down 1.5% from their March 2010 peak.  This should force forecasters to significantly revise their growth forecast down as what looked like a strong rebound in exports late last year now appears to be faltering.</p>

<p><a target="blank" href="http://www.defensenews.com/story.php?i=4734940&#038;c=AME&#038;s=TOP">“No, Again, To F-35 Alt-Engine: Schwartz”</a>,  John Reed, DefenseNews.com  August 4, 2010 </p>
<p>The U.S. Air Force&#8217;s top general reaffirmed his opposition to the GE-Rolls Royce&#8217;s alternative engine for the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter this week, saying that spending billions on the backup engine does not make sense in today&#8217;s fiscal environment.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t favor&#8221; the F136 engine, said Schwartz after an Aug. 4 meeting with the editorial staff of Defense News and Air Force Times. &#8220;I don&#8217;t debate the larger strategic question about the value of competition. This is a question of: if we&#8217;ve got a trillion-dollar deficit, if we&#8217;re not going to say no to that, what do we say no to?&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Ilsm here:<br />The general should have said, “the P&#038;W engine is reliable, the needed production rate can be achieved and we have test data to support those conclusions”, there is no proof the P&#038;W engine is producible and reliable, so the general relies on the DoD’s “concern” for the deficit.</p>
<p>The F-35 has one engine; if the single engine flames out and cannot be restarted the airplane becomes a lawn dart.  The P&#038;W engine installed in the F-16 in the late 1970’s was not reliable, even though it was an adaptation of the engine already flying on the F-15.  When the USAF, who had not insisted the engine be reliable during acquisition, required that P&#038;W fix the reliability the answer was “send more money” there is no warranty and no remedy when faulty designs are accepted.  As a result the USAF restarted the GE engine development and deployed it enduring the lost aircraft utilization and crashes that occurred because the P&#038;W engine was not well tested in the F-16 program.</p>
<p>The F-35 has quality issues, and cannot meet highly scripted test events because things break all the time. Say no to weapons which cannot be maintained because there is no money or time to design them properly.  If followed to its logical conclusion:  there is no room in the trillions in deficits for the F-35 which has not met test schedule much less passed anything.</p>
<p>General Schwatz should support high quality, and address why spending hundreds of billions to deliver up to 2000 F-35’s the DoD cannot get a quality engine.<br />Besides insuring against poor technical outcomes, there are enough engines for the F-35’s large numbers and long anticipated life to justify alternative engines with the better performing engine installed on a higher percent of the deployed aircraft.  This is what happened with the F-16, after years of lost performance.<br />If DOD cannot afford to acquire reliable propulsion sources they can afford the airplane and should kill the F-35.</p>

<blockquote>If you can&#8217;t base a gay-marriage ban in tradition or in a religious objection—because laws have to have a secular purpose—and you also can&#8217;t ground it in the claim that children raised by same-sex couples are worse off, because the research shows just the opposite, than what rational-basis argument can you make? The Proposition 8 proponents are taking heat for their crappy trial record. But what evidence could they have put on instead?</p></blockquote>
<p>— <a target="_blank" href="http://www.slate.com/id/2263347/">Emily Bazelon, in Slate</a></p>
<p>I was as dumbstruck by conservative New York Times columnist Ross Douthat’s piece in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/09/opinion/09douthat.html">yesterdays’ Times</a> as law professor and author Linda Hirshman makes clear in a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.slate.com/id/2263346/">Slate piece today</a> that she is. But not only because Douthat uses pseudo anthropology to conclude that it is in society’s interest to promote heterosexual marriage. Or even Douthat’s concession that heterosexuals now have the culturally accepted options of serial monogamy and procreation outside of marriage. <br /><a name="more"></a> <br />Instead, what really knocked me over was his conclusion that precisely because heterosexuals in such large numbers now choose these options, and therefore threaten to vanquish—his word—the older marital ideal, and because the older marital ideal is still worth striving to preserve because it is the most likely to be a foundation for happiness, the government must preserve it as the ideal to strive for by denying the option of marriage to one, but only one, category of couples who cannot attain it: homosexuals. </p>
<p>The claim is a bald <em>non sequitur</em>. The ideal is still worth honoring, and still worth striving to preserve, he says. Therefore, preserving it ultimately requires some public acknowledgment that heterosexual unions and gay relationships are different: similar in emotional commitment, but distinct both in their challenges and their potential fruit, he says. As if the latter concept logically follows the former. No need even to explain this. His next sentence: “But based on Judge Walker’s logic — which suggests that any such distinction is bigoted and un-American — I don’t think a society that declares gay marriage to be a fundamental right will be capable of even entertaining this idea.”</p>
<p>In other words, we should continue to deny homosexuals the right to marry because we want the government to encourage straights to strive for the ideal of a single decades-long marriage in which husband and wife remain faithful throughout, because this is the most likely to bring them and their children happiness. </p>
<p>All the evidence that is necessary for the higher federal courts to reverse Judge Vauhan Walker’s already-iconic opinion, which held that California’s Proposition 8 prohibition of gay marriage violates the Fourteenth Amendment’s due process and equal protection clauses precisely, is that heterosexuals are en masse undermining the older ideal of marriage. </p>
<p>No evidence upon which to overturn Walker’s opinion? Of course there is! And Ross Douthat provides it.</p>
<p>Makes sense if you’re Ross Douthat, I guess. But not if you’re not.</p>

<p>Kevin Drum <a href="http://motherjones.com/comment/reply/72731">writes</a><br />&#8220;The GOP leadership has released &#8220;Tread Boldly,&#8221; a guidebook for Republican members of congress during the summer recess, and it includes a whole section called &#8220;Spending Restraint Solutions for Discussion.&#8221; Finally, we&#8217;ll get some details! So here they are:</p>
<p>&#8216;Canceling unspent “stimulus” funds, saving up to $266 billion &#8230;&#8217;</p>
<p>Being hep and up to date with the interwebs, the Republicans <a href="http://www.gop.gov/resources/library/documents/recesskits/2010-August.pdf">posted a pdf.</a></p>
<p>My point is that they just declared their willingness to increase the taxes paid by over 95% of working US families.  There is no way they can get &#8220;up to $266 billion&#8221; by cancelling other parts of the stimulus and not cancelling the tax cuts.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Notably  <a href="http://tinyurl.com/383zezq">&#8220;of the $787 billion in the Recovery Act, about 94% is either in tax cuts, payments, or projects under contract. &#8220;</a>  Are the Republicans proposing that the Federal Government violate signed contracts ?  Wouldn&#8217;t that be a seizure ?  </p>
<p>The payments include extended unemployment insurance (I&#8217;m not sure that&#8217;s the only payment).  Total additional government consumption (the standard word for government investment too) was $ 265 billion, so one can&#8217;t save $266 billion by cutting the un-contracted funds (about $ 50 billion).<br />http://tinyurl.com/383zez</p>
<p>Of course the Republicans would like nothing less than to have to explain that the ARRA included tax cuts for over 95% of working families in the USA and to explain that they want to eliminate those cuts (as all currently Republican legislators not from Maine voted against those tax cuts).</p>
