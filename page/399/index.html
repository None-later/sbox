                                <p>rdan<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/15/business/15obamatext.html?_r=1">Text of President Obama&#8217;s speech to Wall Street</a> in the New York Times is in the link.  No pun intended&#8230;much.  Mark Thoma carries the video.  Few bloggers write extensive comments (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/sep/14/lehmans-one-year-after1">Stiglitz</a> an exception) except appear to be saying good bye to meaningful regulation.  Barney Frank says regulation can happen by the end of November.</p>
<p>Let me point people to this link from <a href="http://www.tradersmagazine.com/news/fsa-sec-compensation-financial-stability-board-104372-1.html?ET=tradersmagazine:e390:55932a:&#038;st=email">Tradersmagazine</a> on the European and British take on compensation aspect of financial stability reform <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fsa.gov.uk/pubs/policy/ps09_15.pdf">Final Rules</a> from the Financial Stability Reform program in Britain:</p>
<blockquote><p>In mid-August, the Financial Services Authority in London released its final rules regarding compensation practices by the financial services firms it regulates. The rules must be implemented by Jan. 1, 2010.</p>
<p>The final rules followed a &#8220;consultation&#8221; on earlier proposals, much like the SEC&#8217;s &#8220;notice and comment&#8221; procedures, which were discussed in our earlier article published on March 17, entitled &#8220;Compensation in the New Regulatory Environment.&#8221; As expected, the proposal received extensive comments, including some strident criticism from financial services firms. As a result, the final rules were watered down a bit. The rules now exempt smaller firms, and the compensation rules generally apply only to senior executives and managers who are important to the firm&#8217;s business.</p></blockquote>
<p>And the note from the Tradersmagazine&#8217;s author ends this way:</p>
<blockquote><p>Critics of these regulatory changes have correctly pointed out that the financial services industry will have difficulty attracting the same caliber of employee that it did in the past. But, they haven&#8217;t done a very good job of explaining why this is a bad thing. Whether or not this is good or bad for the country as a whole, or for that matter the global economy, depends on where all of this creative energy ends up being employed.</p></blockquote>
<p>Back to physics and math?  Pays less, but has the correct context.  Of course, now we should read the proposals from overseas&#8230;  </p>
<p>I suppose the big question is&#8230; for market people: how does pay day reflect the time frames of risks taken, and/or more basic who defines risk, riskier, riskiest anymore?  Is it still to be rating firms and sales pitches&#8230;will that remain as our basic source of information?</p>

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Robert Waldmann</p>
<p>I am trying to read John Cochrane&#8217;s comments on Paul Krugman&#8217;s article on why economists got it so wrong. I tend to get upset while reading. I have managed to get through the first paragraph in which Cochrane compares Krugman to someone who denies that HIV causes AIDS and compares developments in economics to progress in the natural sciences. Now in the natural sciences, there are counter intuitive models which are consistent with all available data and have withstood many tests. Also there are once mysterious facts which are explained by theories to the satisfaction of all people familiar with the theories. </p>
<p>So I wondered what puzzles have ceased to be puzzling due to work by macroeconomists in my lifetime (November 9 1960 &#8211; present). I especially wonder if any mysteries were explained by macroeconomists not named Milton Friedman. After the jump and some more throat clearing, I will get to examples.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m counting growth theory as another field. </p>
<p>I have often written about the fact that economists (especially but not only fresh water economists) are unperturbed by regection of their theories by data. They identify &#8220;theory&#8221; with &#8220;a set of models&#8221; and note that models are false by definition. This is not at all true of theories in the natural sciences. It is very likely that all existing theories are false, but they are not false by definition and the discovery that they are inconsistent with data shocks scientists when it occurs. It also causes them to, first try to modify the theory to fit the new data and second (and very often) to abandon the theory. This is not the approach taken by economists. Models of say labor markets or financial markets which are rejected by the data are, nonetheless, used in macro models, based on the argument that if it is false therefore it is a useful approximation.</p>
<p>But what about mysteries resolved. There was a mystery &#8212; why were so many gay men in New York dying following a collapse of their immune system. Almost all scientists familiar with the data agree that an explanation has been found. AIDS remains horrible, but it is not mysterious.</p>
<p>So what macroeconomic mysteries were resolved ? And were any resolved by anyone but Milton Friedman ? </p>
<p>1) in a cross section consumption increases less than proportionally with income. As a result, many brilliant and famous economists (yes one was named Keynes) expected that as average income rises, the ratio of consumption to GNP would fall. This didn&#8217;t happen. The two facts are no longer mysterious at all. They are both implications of the permanent income hypothesis (PIH) or of a model in which part of consumption is according the the PIH and part is by liquidity constrained consumers who live paycheck to paycheck. The PIH explained many strange facts in the cross section of consumption. Just for example African Americans consume less than White Americans with the same income. Why ? Seems an odd fact, but it follows since average African American income is lower so if you have Black and White with the same income it is probabally an unusually good year for the Black family and/or a bad year for the White family.</p>
<p>Mysteries resolved.</p>
<p>2) why the hell is there a Phillips curve which related unemployment and inflation in the USA and UK ? How could this happen ? Well it would happen if expected inflation were about constant because there had not been persistent shifts in inflation. So Friedman predicted that the relationship would disappear if there were persistent inflation. And so it did. Now this wasn&#8217;t exactly a new insight. Everyone knew there is no Phillips curve during hyperinflations. </p>
<p>As a matter of fact Keynes specifically warned that economists shouldn&#8217;t hope to find a simple stable relationship between increased nominal demand and nominal wages which would imply a relationship between inflation and unemployment. Discussing the hope of finding, well something like a robust valid Phillips curve he wrote &#8220;they do not readily lend themselves to theoretical generalisations.&#8221; (General Theory Chapter 21 section VII paragraph 2) and, after deriving a Phillips curve from implausible assumtions </p>
<blockquote><p>I do not myself attach much value to manipulations of this kind; and I would repeat the warning, which I have given above, that they involve just as much tacit assumption as to what variables are taken as independent (partial differentials being ignored throughout) as does ordinary discourse, whilst I doubt if they carry us any further than ordinary discourse can. Perhaps the best purpose served by writing them down is to exhibit the extreme complexity of the relationship between prices and the quantity of money,</p></blockquote>
<p>Oh in chapter 21, Keynes also noted that the Phillips curve is vertical during hyperinflations but I won&#8217;t look up the paragraph.</p>
<p>chapter 21 section VI third paragraph from last. Keynesian economists were warned and ignored the warning. </p>
<p>Friedman and Phelps didn&#8217;t really go fundamentally beyond Keynes on that one. </p>
<p>3) The Peso problem. Why are mexican peso interest rates higher than US dollar interest rates when the exchange rate is fixed ? Answer, people consider a peso devaluation more probable than a dollar devaluation. One only concludes that one can make useful predictions from a finite data set if one is willing to make assumptions about the distribution of random variables. To assume that all variables are normally distributed is to make a gross mistake. Some, like the Peso dollar exchange rate have distributions so that asymptotic results only tell us what will happen when we are all dead.</p>
<p>OK so 2.5 mysteries resolved before I graduated from junior high school (1973). And since then ? hmmm. </p>
<p>Maybe Hall on how Solow&#8217;s residual is positive when there is an increase in demand if price is greater than marginal cost (competition is imperfect).</p>
<p>Over near the great lakes there was, for a while, great interest in working out the implications of </p>
<p>&#8220;(1) For a time at least, rising prices may delude entrepreneurs into increasing employment beyond the level which maximises their individual profits measured in terms of the product.&#8221; </p>
<p>The General Theory &#8230; Chapter 20 section III paragraph 4. For some reason this is called the Lucas supply function.</p>
<p>Also they worked out at great length the implications of assuming perfect competition and perfect labor and capital markets and technological progress which is often negative and which is not persistent. Last I checked (which was long ago) the idea was that with great effort one could fit some summary statistics. I don&#8217;t think anything mysterious was explained. Actually, I think basically all noticible patterns other than those that fit the PIH (or thePIH with some liquidity constrained households) are anomalies which they will explain asymptotically.</p>
<p>Back near Oceans, there was work on putting some nominal rigidity in dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models. The aim was to show that the assumptions of rational expectations and perfect capital markets didn&#8217;t imply that the market outcome was optimal or that policy was irrelevant. When I was a graduate student in the very dead sea of saltiness, no one explained to me why this was the aim. It does seem to be a strikingly irrelevant project at the moment doesn&#8217;t it ?</p>
<p>The line isn&#8217;t &#8220;if you accept these assumptions, then this mystery is resolved&#8221; but rather &#8220;you must make these assumptions so this fact which seems totally unsurprising to you is a mystery.&#8221;</p>
<p>update:  Thanks to a suggestion by Rob in comments, another possible case of actual explanation</p>
<p>An idea which explains things might be the dynamic inconsistency of optimal monetary policy (Kydland and Prescott).  The strange facts that it explains include the moralistic, almost religious, tone of support for tight monetary policy.  I&#8217;m not really sure how new the idea was, but someone I know says he personally knows that K and P were surprised by the mathematical result.  Then a related idea is that it can be rational to delegate monetary policy making to an anti inflation zealot.  This helps explain why apparently  sane people appoint apparently insane people as central bankers (I think the argument is due to Runkle).</p>

                                <p>Via a former editor&#8217;s Twitter feed, the Simon Fraser Institute decides <a target="_blank" href="http://www.windsorstar.com/health/Dollar+cost+Medicare/1991517/story.html">to segment the costs of Canadian health care</a>.  For the good of the people, of course:<br />
<blockquote>It is critically important, however, that Canadians understand the true cost of Medicare. Armed with a more meaningful estimate, Canadians will be able to better assess whether or not they are receiving value for their health care dollars.</p></blockquote>
<p>And what do they calculate as the direct Canadian cost for <em>everything</em>—not just insurance, but insurance, treatment, drugs, etc.—on average?<br />
<blockquote>&#8211; $9,572 for the average 2 adult family</p>
<p>&#8211; $9,855 for the average 2 adult and 1 child family</p>
<p>&#8211; $10,191 for the average 2 adult and 2 child family</p></blockquote>
<p>The lowest quote I can find for <em>insurance alone</em> is $950/month, or $11,400/year. And that&#8217;s before any visits, or shots, or treatments.</p>
<p>Tell me again why we can&#8217;t afford a government option?  And why the Simon Fraser Institute is getting to shill fear in the Windsor Star?</p>
<p>There were reasons for moving back to the States, but health care certainly isn&#8217;t one of them.</p>

<p>Two points:
<ol>
<li>CR knows better, most of the time, than to believe that there was a &#8220;subprime situation&#8221; in any sense other than &#8220;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.calculatedriskblog.com/2008/02/were-all-subprime-now.html">We Are All Subprime Now</a>.&#8221; [edited for tone]</p>
</li>
<li>Possibly more importantly, Washington, D.C., is one of the few areas that has, relatively speaking, maintained employment levels during the current recession.</li>
</ol>
<p>If D.C. is having CRE problems, is it any wonder the rest of the country is in a jobless &#8220;recovery&#8221; at best?</p>

<p>agrees with <a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/blogspot/Hzoh/~3/mqnM_Q3z9Vw/coming-soon-from-major-economists-near.html">Ken</a> (but observes that even Garth Brazelton falls for the &#8216;Pareto fallacy&#8217; [*]), and sees Brazelton&#8217;s (so far) <a href="http://econrevival.blogspot.com/2009/09/in-support-of-chinese-tires-tarrif.html?showComment=1252917211271#c8182452702772350673">one anonymous comment</a>, which takes issue with Brazelton&#8217;s hypothesis that the Obama administration is giving us a backdoor safety-enhancing Pigovian tax:<br />
<blockquote>This is probably incorrect. Tires like many other things need to meet standards. Tiers [sic] for America must meet American standards etc.</p></blockquote>
<p>Indeed they do, but there&#8217;s the econoworld of frictionless international trade in widgets and then there&#8217;s the sausage making of actual trade in manufactured goods.  Let&#8217;s set the Way-Back Machine just two years ago to the case of Foreign Tire Sales below the jump.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the lede of the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/26/business/worldbusiness/26tire.html">NYT account</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Federal officials have told a small New Jersey importer to recall 450,000 radial tires for pickup trucks, sport utility vehicles and vans after the company disclosed that its Chinese manufacturer had stopped including a safety feature that prevented the tires from separating.</p>
<p>[snip]</p>
<p>[NHTSA&#8217;s] top officials were “outraged” that Foreign Tire Sales’ executives waited more than two years to pass on their suspicions about problems with the tires. The company first suspected problems in October 2005. Almost a year later, in September 2006, the Chinese manufacturer, Hangzhou Zhongce Rubber, a former state-owned company based in eastern China, acknowledged that a gum strip that prevents the tread from separating was left out of the manufacturing process.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now Foreign Tire Sales did not intend to import substandard tires:<br />
<blockquote>The tires were supposed to exceed federal safety standards, partly by including a gum strip between the plies to prevent separation, and ultimately passed a road test in which they were driven 40,000 miles&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>Nevertheless, a few years into the relationship with its factory, problems started to appear:<br />
<blockquote>In October 2005, the company said it became concerned because of a sharp increase in customer complaints about the Hangzhou Zhongce radial tires. In investigating the complaints, Foreign Tire Sales’ officials became suspicious that Hangzhou Zhongce was manufacturing the tires without the gum strips or with inadequate gum strips, but the Chinese company denied it.</p>
<p>Tests of tire segments conducted by an outside firm were not conclusive but “seemed to indicate that there were no gum strips or insufficient gum strips in the inspected tires,” Foreign Tire Sales wrote in its June 11 report to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.</p></blockquote>
<p>Foreign Tire Sales&#8217;s ability to monitor its contract manufacturer and get to the bottom of the quality problems was surely compromised by the fact that it was a seven-person office that never actually touched the tires it brought into the country.</p>
<p>For the money shot:<br />
<blockquote>Hangzhou Zhongce admitted in September 2006 that it had “unilaterally decided to omit the gum strips” in the tires, the report says. The Chinese company was “generally unresponsive” when asked how many tires were involved and what they were going to do to resolve the problem, the report says.</p></blockquote>
<p>With little or no monitoring and financial returns to cutting corners, amazingly corners are cut.  Lo, incentives matter!  But that&#8217;s not all!!  Foreign Tire Sales, being asset-light, lacked the wherewithal to actually shoulder its obligations in the event of a large-scale recall.  An <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/leo-w-gerard/stop-the-toxic-trade-prof_b_103630.html">account at the Huffington Post</a> says that they were spared bankruptcy by virtue of most of the recalled tires having stayed on the road, sparing F.T.S. the expense of actually replacing them with tires more-or-less known to be up to standard.</p>
<p>The anonymous commenter makes a follow-up point:<br />
<blockquote>There used to be a term Jap Crap for Japanese stuff. Now Japan sets the standard for manufactured items. China will do the same eventually.</p></blockquote>
<p>This post was written on a Chinese-assembled laptop computer which, at age 3, is still working pretty well, so it&#8217;s not that Chinese stuff necessarily is crap.  Of course, Apple&#8217;s handle on the product quality lead of its supply chain may be better than that on its contract workplace conditions.  Certainly Korean products have improved radically since, say, Hyundai&#8217;s entry into the U.S. auto market.</p>
<p>Perhaps if we could just trade with the Aspirational China with its fast trains, gleaming 500-meter skyscrapers, massive renewable energy investments, and middle class, some of the conditions might actually hold to justify the U.S. economist hand-wringing.  Meanwhile promotion of trade should not be a suicide pact.</p>
<p>[*] I.e., because a policy may be Pareto-improving after the losers are compensated, it is worth implementing from a social welfare perspective even if we all know that the losers won&#8217;t be compensated.</p>

<p><em>Gather all around the camp fire and enjoy your marsh mellow toasting as I tell you the fable of the “The Guitar Player who sold his gear”.  Long ago in a far away land of rock and roll there was a young man who played well.  Not great, wasn&#8217;t going to necessarily be a guitar hero, but who knows?  He had the gear, the amp to make your ears ring for days, the gold top Les Paul, couple pedals, cables&#8230;all he needed.  And he played.  Jammed, earned some money on the side.  Life was good.  But, along came another desire.  He needed some money and the playing was becoming less as life with the loved one became more.  So, he sold it.  All of it.  He had maybe $1 thousand in gear.  He got $500 for it.  It seemed good at the time.  He had gotten his use of it all, made some bucks but it really was just money sitting there it seemed.  </p>
<p>A few years pass, the kids grow up and the man has some spare time.  He has been dabbling on a folk guitar for years, so when he hears that a friend is jamming on Thursday nights, he gets an urge.  That potential just sitting there to be tapped, but&#8230;no gear.  No problem, he&#8217;ll just buy some.  The only problem is, when he first goes to practice and sees the friends  2 Les Pauls and a jazz box, 2 ear killing amps and bottoms, a full board of pedals worth what he sold his gear for, he wonders how the friend did it and thus how is he going to do it.  It was thousands in gear.  The friend answers: I never sell any of my music equipment because it is part of my life activities, it makes me who I am, it helps me think and you never know what will come up for an opportunity.</em></p>
<p>Such a fable is common among those who used to play music.</p>
<p>I have written at AB that my thoughts about when the flash point was for our change to a focus on making money from money was the first Reagan election.  I do believe this is the case however, having finished reading Richard J Elkus&#8217; book, <em><strong>Winner Take All</strong></em>, I now have learned of a perspective as to why it flashed and why we are bailing out finance with more money and fewer questions than bailing out the auto industry.  I also see just how back ass-ward this bailing out concern is.</p>
<p>You see, the thought that the purpose of business is to make money was not always the winner in the argument.  The argument has been back and forth for ages.  It is part of the class war.  In fact, there was a movie in 1954 with William Holden looking at this issue called <a href="http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=3001">Executive Suite</a>. <br />
<blockquote>&#8230;McDonald Walling, who oversees the company&#8217;s manufacturing plant and is preparing to test a new molding process&#8230; process did not go well in his absence. On the way home, he complains to his wife Mary that financial analyst Loren Phineas Shaw focuses on the bottom line at the expense of the company&#8217;s creativity&#8230;McDonald speaks passionately about the company, condemning Shaw&#8217;s short-sighted emphasis on quick profits as &#8220;a lack of faith in the future.&#8221; After McDonald outlines his vision for restoring the company to its former high standards, the board unanimously elects him president.</p></blockquote>
<p>We have not always thought that the purpose of business is just to make money.</p>
<p>Mr. Elkus&#8217; (MBA) thesis is that in the 60&#8217;s, two laws of economic process were formalized and presented that were the guiding thoughts influencing economic development.  Both lines of thinking came from viewing the same show: semiconductors.  One is by Mr. Bruce Henderson (engineer and MBA degrees) the other by Mr. Gordon Moore (PhD chemistry).  Both addressed the relationship of costs and production.  I note the degrees of each just as a curiosity.  </p>
<p>Mr. Henderson, watching Texas Instrument, came up with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experience_curve_effects">Experience Curve</a>.  In it&#8217;s simplest form it states that unit cost goes down over time as experience increases.</p>
<p>But, this was just the bases for a broader concept, a “strategy” for guiding business development: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth-share_matrix">Stars, Cash Cows and Dogs</a>.<br />
<blockquote>As a particular industry matures and its growth slows, all business units become either cash cows or dogs. The natural cycle for most business units is that they start as question marks, then turn into stars. Eventually the market stops growing thus the business unit becomes a cash cow. At the end of the cycle the cash cow turns into a dog.</p>
<p>The overall goal of this ranking was to help corporate analysts decide which of their business units to fund, and how much; and which units to sell.</p></blockquote>
<p>This was and appears to still be a very big concept.  Big as in influential.  Via Wiki:<br />
<blockquote>The Economist magazine stated that Henderson did more to change the way business is done in the United States than any other man in American business history. Well known to many now is the famous Growth Share Matrix (&#8216;cash cow&#8217;) and the &#8216;Experience curve&#8217;. His books were published in 27 languages.</p></blockquote>
<p>Huge influence.  Taught throughout our business schools according to Mr. Elkus and Wiki.  Came about in 1970.  </p>
<p>Mr. Moore, being a founder of semiconductor manufacturing businesses, namely Intel, came up with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore's_law">Moore&#8217;s Law</a>.  In it&#8217;s simplest form, it states that there would be <em>“a doubling  of computing power per given area of silicon every year at basically the same cost&#8230;”</em>  <br />Mr. Elkus&#8217;s thesis is that both describe models, ultimately truths regarding making money.  Both are used as strategies for basing an economy upon.  Only one is truly sustainable and makes all of America&#8217;s dreams possible.  Japan picked that one.   </p>
<p>He comes to this by way of his involvement with Ampex.  Ampex owned video recording <em>“&#8230;controlling nearly 100 percent of the world&#8217;s video recording patents and more than 70 % of the market”</em>.  Mr. Elkus literally introduced the first video recorder for home use, September 2, 1970 in NY.  In the next few days, Ampex stock climbed 50%.  Only one VP attended, no other top/senior management.  <em>“It was not a good sign.”</em>  His lesson from the event: <em>“The introduction of Instavideo set in motion a long chain of events, resulting not only in the explosion of consumer electronics into nearly every facet of daily life but in a global shift in economic power to Asia.”</em></p>
<p>In the same year, he saw a presentation of high definition video by Japan&#8217;s  “primary” broadcasting company, NHK.  It is at this point in the story Mr. Elkus relays the concept of convergence of technology.  The ability to record video on a consumer level scale represented the ability to store and process massive amounts of data.  This ability converging with digital video presentation meant that the entire information economy would be exponentially growing based on Moore&#8217;s Law.  Mr. Henderson&#8217;s potential Star.  Moore&#8217;s law also meant that as the ability to process ever larger amounts of data on ever smaller media, the cost would be ever greater.  Mr. Henderson&#8217;s potential Dog.  What to do?</p>
<p>Mr. Elkus knew Ampex needed a partner that could take the technology to the consumer.  Coming up with the technology, he recognized is only part of the expertise and cost, the other is the ability to manufacture it such that technology, in short, is dummy proof in the hands of the consumer.  It is an ability all of it&#8217;s own.  Mr. Elkus wanted Magnavox or Motorola as partners; keep it in the country.  The boss said no, feared competition so went with Toshiba.  This gets us to the next part of Mr. Elkus&#8217; thesis: Infrastructure.  Which gets to the final cog in the process: investment.</p>
<p>Using his experience with Ampex&#8217;s Instavideo, Mr. Elkus presents the counter to Mr. Henderson&#8217;s Stars, Cash Cow&#8217;s and Dogs:  Investment, Convergence and Infrastructure.  A relational model that follows the production law of Moore.  </p>
<p>What the thesis of Investment, Convergence and Infrastructure means to a nation is presented in the tracing of the loss of our manufacturing base to initially Japan and ultimately to all of Asia.  It is the counter to Mr. Henderson&#8217;s model which is basically just focusing on the money.  It is the movie Executive Suite for real only for us, the story ending is looking different.  </p>
<p>The relationship of Investment, Convergence and Infrastructure is presented early in the book via Zenith.  There was a fight for control of the board as reported by the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/24/business/company-news-zenith-criticizes-dissident-group.html">AP 11/1988</a>.  A couple Wall Streeters wanted Zenith to dump the <em>“money-losing television business”.  </em>The dog.  The article also noted: <em>“for an outsider, jumping into the TV business would be like trying to hop onto a speeding train&#8230;”</em> In the end, Zenith a company that <em>“helped establish the standards for high definition television in the US,&#8230; contributing significant technology for the potential development of the industry”</em> was gone by 1996 to LG of Korea <em>“for a fraction of what it now costs to build a single display manufacturing facility”.  </em>We lost our infrastructure and thus the advantage of economic growth based on convergence and all the knowledge that is the result there of because of our focus on cash flow as the bases for deciding on where to invest.  </p>
<p>Using a simpler example:<br />
<blockquote>In 1964, one year before Gordon Moore wrote his prophetic article, semiconductor sales reached $1 billion.  Today sales are in excess of $260 billion, it is projected that in a dozen years the number may reach $1 trillion.  And growth in revenue has occurred while prices have dropped at an average compound rate of 29 % annually&#8230;But that is really chump change when you realize that $260 billion of silicon makes possible a $2 trillion electronic systems industry today&#8230;So it is possible to imagine an electronic systems market  approaching $4 trillion to $5 trillion in the next twelve to fifteen years—an amount equal to the current GDP of Japan&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>The error of US having followed Henderson, which if I understand Elkus properly, I conclude has lead to NAFTA, outsourcing jobs and ultimately the fight over whether to save our auto industry (which I noted is the last “infrastructure” we have that uses “convergence” via “investment”) verses little questioning to save the banks is summarized thusly:<br />
<blockquote>The common denominator driving the world of information and its communications infrastructure was the need to store, process  and distribute extraordinary amounts of digital information.  [Store = Ampex.  Process = Intel.  Distribute = Zenith.]  If one understands HDTV as the result of learning how to process massive amounts of digital information, as both a convergence and catalyst in the digital revolution, then it should be easy to see that the need to process that information is not limited to the HDTV display and a pretty picture&#8230;. </p></blockquote>
<p>It now costs upward of $10 billion to build just one semiconductor manufacturing plant.  $3 billion to build a single display fabrication facility.  Zenith was sold for $350 million.  Based on <a href="http://www.measuringworth.com/calculators/compare/">Measuring Worth</a>, 1996 to 2008 these money minds following Henderson, sold Zenith for 1/6th the cost required to build just one display panel plant in 2008.  This number differential is the total fallacy in Henderson.  How do you know?  How do you know what really is the next big thing?  How can you be sure that nothing else will come of what you have?  It is the &#8220;The Guitar Player&#8221;.  But worst of all as shown in the example of selling Zenith, is just how short sighted Henderson&#8217;s thinking and thus American business thinking is in general.  If I may, Henderson&#8217;s thinking is analogous to watching your rear view mirror while driving forward as you decide whether to turn or drive straight.  Henderson&#8217;s thinking is the point of thought that began the money from money economy.  It is the thought that lead us to a purposeless existence of no substance because it leaves unanswered the question of why do we want to earn money or create wealth, for what purpose.  </p>
<p>Mr. Elkus gave a <a href="http://fora.tv/2008/09/03/Richard_Elkus_Competitiveness_Shapes_the_Fate_of_Nations">talk at The Commonwealth Club</a> in California on 9/3/08.  It covers a time line of what he is writes in his book.  It is one hour long, but well worth the time, especially <a href="http://fora.tv/2008/09/03/Richard_Elkus_Competitiveness_Shapes_the_Fate_of_Nations#chapter_15">the question at the end</a> regarding Apple&#8217;s business arrangement regarding it&#8217;s Iphone as the questioner brings up “competitive advantage” and money from royalties.  You know, that information/service economy model that has gotten us to the point that the biggest service sector (finance) took down the economy and the next largest is unaffordable(health care).</p>
<p>The most profound comment by Mr. Elkus during this lecture is: <strong><em>If you don&#8217;t have the infrastructure, then you don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s possible.</em></strong></p>
<p>How far reaching is this persepctive of Investment, Convergence and Infrastructure?  Mr. Elkus suggests that even our <a href="http://www.theglobalist.com/StoryId.aspx?StoryId=7285">education system</a> is influenced by it.<br />
<blockquote>When a nation’s politics and economics fall out of step with its education system, the cost of reengagement is extraordinarily high. </p>
<p>Therefore any attempt to explain the plight of education in America must look first at the country’s current political and economic attitudes. They are directly linked. </p>
<p>Eventually, because of the exponential acceleration in convergence, infrastructure, and investment, there’s a cascading effect, and the loss of one industry begins to threaten the stability of others. </p>
<p>These events are noticed by the educational community, which must provide a measure of career guidance for its student population and thus looks to political, economic, and business leaders for answers.</p></blockquote>
<p>We have Intel fortunately, but we don&#8217;t have the infrastructure of Zenith which would have been using Intels output to market Ampex&#8217;s technology which lead to the Iphone.</p>

<p>I am actually commenting on a snippet with a useless link <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2009/09/the-state-of-economics-one-of-these-things-is-not-like-the-other-ones.html#comments">here</a>.  </p>
<blockquote><p>Professor Krugman&#8217;s article, like much of his journalism, was hastily drafted and factually incorrect. [skip]   One of the most humorous aspects of the article was its view that the efficient markets hypothesis was at the heart of the inability to see the bubble coming. If Krugman had bothered to read any of the finance journals for the past two decades he would have noticed a remarkable transformation of the profession away from adherence to the efficient markets hypothesis. </p></blockquote>
<p>Meeeow.  Also irrelevant.  Krugman was talking about what academic economists tell policy makers, not what is published in academic journals.  It is quite different.  Also there is a difference between research in a field and the message from that field to economists in other fields.  Roughly, macroeconomists assumed that the efficient markets hypothesis was a useful approximation even though people who look at asset prices knew it was rejected by their data.  </p>
<p>The terrible power of elegant theories in economics is that they maintain their power even once it is agreed that they are rejected by the relevant data.  The response is that &#8220;all models are false&#8221; &#8212; (I am quoting Victor Rios Rull but I could be quoting thousands of economists) and that they can still be useful.  Roughly the logic is that just because a model is not exactly true doesn&#8217;t mean it isn&#8217;t useful.  This model is not exactly true, therefore it is useful.  </p>
<p>Reading Calomiris&#8217;s criticism of Krugman, I am reminded of something this guy named Brad DeLong said about Krugman some time ago.</p>
<p>Brad said that Krugman has spent his academic career finding cases in which a country can gain from protectionism and his career as a public intellectual arguing that protection hurts the protecting country.  </p>
<p>Yes that was a long long time ago (about 20 years).  Brad war right about Krugman the public intellectual (the first statementw as hyberbole as Krugman the academic had a broader range even lo those many years ago).  </p>
<p>Brad&#8217;s point was that, when economists give advice, they switch to economics 101 &#8212; to old mathematical results based on old models with assumptions made for tractability.  In contrast new research in economic theory has to be uhm new, and it&#8217;s best to get new results not the same old results with relaxed assumptions.</p>
<p>Thus old economic theory dominates economists contributions to the public debate even when economists know that it isn&#8217;t even valid as theory &#8212; that there are other models just as elegant and beautiful which give the opposite answer to the policy question.</p>
<p>I think this refutes Calomiris&#8217;s critique of Krugman.  Yes current research published in The Journal of Finance and the Journal of Financial Economics has moved beyond CAPM.  Wow big surprise, you can&#8217;t publish the same paper for over <strike> a decade </strike> two decades.  </p>
<p>However, when talking to policy makers, academic economists explain the old simple model, that is assume efficient markets, and don&#8217;t bother them with current research, that is, the fact that the efficient markets hypothesis has less empirical support than the phlogiston hypothesis.</p>
<p>This also reminds me of something that Robert Waldmann once Said about Greg Mankiw.  </p>
<p>The rules of theoretical debate among economists often require great deference to simplifying assumptions which no one has ever believed to be approximately correct. Roughly, the rule seems to be &#8220;according first neoclassical model&#8221; must be accepted as meaning &#8220;true to first order&#8221; which much be interpreted as &#8220;a useful approximation.&#8221; I really don&#8217;t know why.</p>
<p>This means that, at least until behavioral economists develop a theory as complete and elegant and simple as the efficient markets hypothesis, economists give policy makers advice which is sound only if it is true.</p>
