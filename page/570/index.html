                                <p>G.K.Chesterton  <em>The Paradoxes of Mr Pond</em></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The next man with whom Pond fell into any sort of conversation, in a  <br />cafe, was much more vigorous and vigilant, and belonged to a younger  <br />world.  But he also was very serious; a dark, strenuous young man who  <br />was a Government official actually believing in the Government; or at  <br />least in the principles of the Government; and he was the sort of man  <br />who thinks first about principles.  He denounced the strike and even  <br />the trade union; not because he was a snob, for he lived as simply as  <br />a workman; but because he really did believe in the old  <br />individualistic theory of what he called free contract. The type is  <br />almost unknown in England; the theory is more common in America.</p>
<p>[after many pages]&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I understand the horrid truth [Pond resumed] that you yourself are  <br />a perfectly honourable and high-minded person and that your own  <br />problem is extremely difficult to solve&#8230; It was to the Republic, to  <br />the idea of equality and justice that you swore loyalty; and to that  <br />you have been loyal.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;You had better say what you think,&#8217; said Marcus gloomily. &#8216;You mean  <br />that I am really only serving a gang of crooks, whom any blackguard  <br />can blackmail.&#8217;</p>
<p>[Pond] stood up before the astonished official, who had no apparent  <br />alternative but to follow him as he passed swiftly across the cate.   <br />Some vivacious and talkative young men were taking leave of M. Louis,  <br />who courteously invited the newcomers to the empty chairs, saying  <br />something about &#8216;my young friends often enliven my solitude with  <br />their rather Socialistic views.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;I should not agree with your young friends,&#8217; said Marcus curtly, &#8216;I  <br />am so old-fashioned as to believe in free contract.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;I, being older, perhaps believe in it even more.&#8217; answered M. Louis  <br />smiling. &#8216;But surely it is a very old principle of law that a leonine  <br />contract is not a free contract. And it is hypocrisy to pretend that  <br />a bargain between a starving man and a man with all the food is  <br />anything but a leonine contract.&#8217;  He glanced up at the fire-escape,  <br />a ladder leading up to the balcony of a very high attic above. &#8216;I  <br />live in that garret; or rather on that balcony. If I fell off the  <br />balcony and hung on a spike, so far from the steps that somebody with  <br />a ladder could offer to rescue me if I gave him a hundred million  <br />francs, I should be quite morally justified in using his ladder and  <br />then telling him to go to hell for his hundred million.  Hell,  <br />indeed, is not out of the picture; for it is a sin of injustice to  <br />force an advantage against the desperate. Well, all those poor men  <br />are desperate; they all hang starving on spikes.  If they must not  <br />bargain collectively, they cannot bargain at all.  You are not  <br />supporting contract; you are opposing all contract; for yours cannot  <br />be a real contract at all.'&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I wont&#8217; spoil the rest of the story for those intrigued enough to  <br />look it up [it is &#8220;The Unmentionable Man&#8221; in the above title]</p>
<p>but i thought i&#8217;d offer it as an example of real writing, and real  <br />thinking, for our friends who know all the answers in a few clumsy  <br />words&#8230;  and remind them that it is an old, old story.</p>

<p> Hmmm.  $13 per hour minimum wage?  I am CERTAIN that those dollars wouldn&#8217;t go into savings &#8212; instead they would go into paying bills and buying stuff, probably more pricey stuff than dollar store gimcrackery.</p>
<p>Certainly it appears to be hard on employers.  But I wonder how much of this is a problem built up over the past 30 years, with unsustainable wages now structured into business models.  Suppose John Doe Jr. never left home, but lived comfortably in the basement with his wife and family (it&#8217;s a big basement), then his &#8220;business model&#8221; would not include rent.  When the widow Doe died and the will left the estate to her cats, John would be in for a shock.</p>
<p>My minimum wage job in 1972 in Minneapolis paid $2.65 per hour.  The Federal Reserve site provides a handy calculator for CPI over time (here http://www.minneapolisfed.org/Research/data/us/calc/)</p>
<p>I plugged in the numbers, and this is what I got:</p>
<p>If in (year)1972 <br />I bought goods or services for $2.65,</p>
<p>then in (year) 2008<br />the same goods or services would cost $ 13.67</p>
<p>So minimum wage today is less than half of what it was in the early 70s, in terms of dollar value.</p>
<p>This might mean that in 1974 I was wildly overpaid.  That is not my recollection.  But apparently many others had it worse.</p>
<p>Here are Federal statutory minimum wage rates since 1955 (http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0774473.html)</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a few data points from that chart:</p>
<p>Year     stat MW     Constant $2008</p>
<p>1972 $1.60 $6.01<br />1977  $2.30 $5.95<br />1982    $3.35   $5.78<br />1987    $3.35*  $4.63<br />1992    $4.25   $4.75<br />1997    $5.15   $5.03<br />2002    $5.15*  $4.49<br />2007    $5.85   $4.41</p>
<p>(*) I find it interesting to note that there were two very long stretches of time, from 1981 to 1989, and then from 1997 to 2006, where minimum-wage wages remained flat, first at $3.35 (falling in value from $5.78 to $4.24 over that time) and then at $5.15 (falling in value from $5.03 to $4.04 over that time).</p>
<p>I charted the federal figures this morning and it presents an interesting picture.  The minimum wage was put in place in 1955.  It rose in a very jagged manner from 1955 to 1968, reaching a peak in $1996 of $7.01 per hour. then it fell to about six dollars an hour, remaining there through most of the 70s.  From 1980 to about 1990 the statutory rate was held steady, and inflation pushed the minimum wage into the $4-$5 an hour range, where it has remained ever since.</p>
<p>comparing this line of minimum wage buying power to the other line showing the statutory rate shows something else &#8212; around 1980, the pattern of statutory changes changed dramatically.  From 1955 to 1980, minimum wages were raised every couple of years, yielding a gradual rising line, with one plateau corresponding to the fall which followed the $7.01 peak &#8212; a peak which has never been remotely approached since then.</p>
<p>But beginning in 1980, the statutory minimum wage adjustments assumed a pattern of plateaus, each one lasting five to 10 years.  After about 1985, the buying value of the minimum wage  zigzags between four and five dollars an hour &#8212; strangely, the five dollar mark after about 1985 looks exactly like a ceiling, and a four dollar mark like a floor.</p>
<p>One more point &#8212; the buying value of the US statutory minimum wage hit its absolute lowest point in 2006.<br />&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>

<blockquote><p>If you&#8217;re sitting here today, you&#8217;re not economically illiterate and you&#8217;re not a whiner, so I&#8217;m not worried about who you&#8217;re going to vote for,&#8221; the former Texas senator told attendees at a Financial Services Roundtable event in Minneapolis on the sidelines of the Republican National Convention.</p></blockquote>
<p>Team Obama responds:</p>
<blockquote><p>The man who wrote John McCain&#8217;s economic plan further insulted struggling Americans by suggesting that if they are not attending the Republican Convention, they are not only whiners, but economically illiterate.</p></blockquote>
<p>Guess what else Gramm helped John McCain with:</p>
<blockquote><p>At today&#8217;s event, Gramm also defended McCain&#8217;s selection of Alaska Governor Sarah Palin to be his vice presidential running mate. &#8220;We went through a process of vetting all possible candidates,&#8221; narrowing it down to three before choosing Palin, he said.</p></blockquote>
<p>There was a vetting process?  Really?  The word is out – this vetting process was about as sloppy as anything I’ve ever seen. The issue for many of us is not how unqualified Sarah Palin is to be Vice President.  The issue is the lack of judgment of John McCain – as exemplified by his selection of a running mate he knew very little about.  But let me turn the microphone over to <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/09/the-unfitness-1.html">Brad DeLong</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>There has been a lot of chatter about how the Palin decision shows the unfitness of John McCain. It equally shows the unfitness of McCain&#8217;s staff. When you have a rash and impulsive boss, you compensate by staff work. You examine the leaves of the strategy tree in advance, knowing that nine times out of ten the work will be unnecessary&#8211;but the tenth time it will be very necessary indeed.  John McCain&#8217;s staff did not do that.</p></blockquote>
<p>Update: Joshua Green describes the <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200809u/palin-eagleton">Eagleton Scenario</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Barring a dramatic reversal, Sarah Palin will formally become the Republican vice presidential nominee Wednesday night. Since Friday, when the pick was announced, news surrounding Palin has been almost uniformly negative: the initial focus on her lack of experience quickly gave way to reports of her involvement in the Troopergate scandal, the “Bridge to Nowhere” earmark, an Alaskan separatist party, a 527 group organized by recently indicted Alaska Senator Ted Stevens, and, on Labor Day, her teenage daughter’s pregnancy … With reporters and opposition researchers crawling through Alaska, and with the McCain campaign having dispatched its own team of lawyers to re-vet Palin, Republicans are wondering what shoe might drop next. If further revelations prove damaging enough, McCain could decide to replace Palin or she could choose to withdraw. While such an event seems unlikely given her popularity in some quarters of the party—Jacob Heilbrunn has suggested that social conservatives would view her ouster as “political infidelity”—her rocky reception makes the “Eagleton scenario,” and how it might unfold, a subject of more than academic interest. Interviews with Republicans and legal experts today shed light on how the process could play out. At any point before tomorrow night, McCain could simply replace Palin. But once she formally accepts her nomination, he’ll no longer have the power to do so unilaterally. According to Ben Ginsberg, the former general council at the Republican National Committee, Republican rules stipulate that the 168 members of the national committee would need to ratify any replacement to make it official.</p></blockquote>
<p>Maybe McCain will keep Palin.  After all, the damage to his campaign has already been done.  Dumping her will cause even more damage.  This is sort of like that stupid decision on March 19, 2003.  Once we invaded Iraq, we were stuck with the quagmire.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>I thought <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122031215585888783.html?mod=googlenews_wsj">Martin Feldstein and John Taylor</a> understood the role of fiscal policy in a Solow growth model:</p>
<blockquote><p>Here&#8217;s how the three components of Sen. McCain&#8217;s tax plan will work in practice.  To create jobs, Mr. McCain will reduce the corporate tax rate &#8212; now at 35% the second highest among all industrial countries &#8212; to one that doesn&#8217;t penalize firms for doing business here. To encourage small businesses to expand, he will fight against higher tax rates on their income.  To increase wages, Mr. McCain will provide incentives to raise productivity, which leads to higher wages. To increase productivity, he will provide incentives for developing and applying new technologies by expanding the tax credit for research and development, and by making that credit permanent.  More savings and investment in businesses also raise productivity. Mr. McCain will stimulate saving by keeping tax rates low on the returns to saving in the form of dividends and capital gains. He will also allow faster depreciation of assets, which encourages investment. And he will strengthen the incentive to save by reducing the maximum estate tax rate, with a substantial, untaxed exemption.</p></blockquote>
<p>They contrast McCain’s tax proposals to those of Barack Obama.  The <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/wonkroom/2008/09/02/wsj-all-americans">Wonk Room</a> attempts a rebuttal in three parts with the first two focusing on the distributional impacts of the McCain v. Obama plans.  But this will not do as Feldstein and Taylor are mainly arguing supposed supply-side effects.  It isn’t until the last part of the attempt at the rebuttal that we get to the real fallacy of this political spin from two eminent economists:</p>
<blockquote><p>CLAIM: Mr. McCain will bring the budget into balance.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, this is a silly claim.  The McCain fiscal proposals amount to continued fiscal irresponsibility which will lower national savings leading to less investment and long-term growth.  I’m shocked that these two gentlemen would lend their name to such free lunch supply-side silliness.</p>
<p>Update: <a href="http://econ4obama.blogspot.com/2008/09/obama-vs-mccain-on-taxes-feldstein-and.html">Lerxst</a> sees more misleading arguments in this op-ed with respect to the Feldstein-Taylor claim that McCain’s health care proposals work as a tax cut for everyone.</p>

                                <p>Women&#8217;s lib is a capitalist plot to exploit the last great source of cheap, high quality labor.</p>
<p>OK, now that I&#8217;ve made a statement designed to be extreme and arouse controversy it is time to look at the data a little differently.</p>
<p>In the recently released Census report on income and insurance one of the most interesting series was the one comparing male and female incomes.  The part that gets attention is the report that female income for a full time, year round job is now 78% of what a male earns, up from 58% some 30 years ago.  The press reports this as a good thing and I really do not disagree with that point</p>
<p>But the part that is generally ignored is the history of what has happened to wages over the last 30 years.  If you look at this chart you see two patterns.  One is that male real wages essentially quit rising in the mid-19790s and despite year to year fluctuations have been flat since then.  In contrast, female wages have been on an uptrend.   So the convergence between male and female wages is a balance of two trends: one is rising real female wages and the other is flat real male wages.<a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SL19lsutnqI/AAAAAAAAAYo/5kGvc4CAemY/s1600-h/Clipboard03.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SL19lsutnqI/AAAAAAAAAYo/5kGvc4CAemY/s320/Clipboard03.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a>The second chart that goes with the income data is the employment data.  Since 1967 female trend employment growth has been 3.1% while male employment growth was only 1.5%.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SL2GigDgI_I/AAAAAAAAAYw/9WWduYCMZSc/s1600-h/Clipboard02.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SL2GigDgI_I/AAAAAAAAAYw/9WWduYCMZSc/s320/Clipboard02.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a>The growth in male employment has been weaker than the growth in the male population so that the male employment population ratio has fallen.  In contrast female employment growth has been faster than female population growth so that the female employment population ratio has been rising.  Basically, this is looking at the growth in demand vs the growth in supply.<br />For males supply growth has outpaced demand growth and the consequence has been flat real incomes.  For females demand or employment growth was greater that supply growth so real incomes  rose. It is not shown in this chart, but one of the ways the male employment-population ratio has been falling is trough older males dropping out of the labor force.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SL19Bu2k3sI/AAAAAAAAAYY/oGiY30ySFgI/s1600-h/Clipboard01.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SL19Bu2k3sI/AAAAAAAAAYY/oGiY30ySFgI/s320/Clipboard01.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a></p>
<p>But for the economy as a whole, at least at the margin, what we have been doing is replacing high paying male jobs with low paying female jobs.  This has been a core problem in the US economy over the last 30 years.  There are many ways to look at this, but the comparison of the growth in male-female employment and incomes clearly demonstrates these trends better than any other comparison I know of.  For example another comparison is replacing manufacturing jobs with retail jobs and there are others.  But they just do not demonstrate the point as well as the male-female comparison does.</p>
<p>If you go back to the first chart you see that the weighted average of male and female income has been flat.  This is in line with many other series that show the same trend and has been difficult for many people to accept.  But this changing composition of employment has been a driving force behind flat real income growth that should be easy for those doubting the overall trend to understand.</p>
<p>Ss after looking at this data how many agree with me that women&#8217;s  lib is a capitalist plot to exploit the last big supply of cheap, high quality labor?</p>

                                <p>About McCain&#8217;s choice of Palin as a &#8220;bold move,&#8221; Movie Guy said, &#8220;You can&#8217;t make this stuff up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Two pieces in the New York Times today had me laughing: &#8220;Palin&#8217;s Daughter Interrupts Script&#8221; and &#8220;Disclosures on Palin Raised on Vetting Process.&#8221;</p>
<p>Already, Palin has turned into a soap opera&#8230;and god knows, <i>I</i> couldn&#8217;t make this stuff up! </p>
<p>Now the ball is flipping to McCain&#8217;s side of the court: How careful is he in making important decisions? Does he shoot from the hip? </p>
<p>What was the vetting process? What role did McCain play? &#8220;We&#8217;ll pick a woman! Who we got? Palin&#8230;great name&#8230;and a beauty queen. Let&#8217;s go with her!&#8221;</p>
<p>Image is everything in U.S. politics&#8211;unfortunately. The centerfold in McCain&#8217;s script has been a real show stopper. Maybe McCain is shooting three-pointers for Obama&#8230;just to give Obama a chance.</p>
<p>The spin meisters will be working overtime.</p>
<p>Addendum: It is not going to stop, folks.  The Washington Post ran the following articles:</p>
<p>&#8220;Palin&#8217;s Small Alaska Town Secured Big Federal Funds&#8221;&#8211;something McCain has railed against.<br />&#8220;Palin Roils Convention Start&#8221;</p>
<p>And the response will be? Kill the messengers, i.e., The Post and the Times.</p>

<blockquote><p>While Toyota and General Motors continue to duke it out for first place among the world&#8217;s largest automakers, the lower rungs have been equally hotly contested. It came as a shock to many that Hyundai-Kia had surpassed Honda to take the Number 5 spot, but if you think the battle is being waged purely between the Far East and North America, don&#8217;t discount Europe for long. The continent&#8217;s largest auto group, Volkswagen, has claimed its place on the podium as the world&#8217;s third largest automaker, beating out Ford in the first half of this fiscal year. </p>
<p>The numbers, of course, are based on sales worldwide, and they could very well change by the end of the year. Although Ford&#8217;s own namesake brand surely accounts for the bulk of its sales, the FoMoCo multi-brand conglomerate that once included the Premier Auto Group has dissipated of late, while VW&#8217;s numerous subsidiaries – including Volkswagen, Audi, Skoda, Seat, Lamborghini, Bentley and Bugatti – continue to thrive. All the more impressive, then, that a tiny company like Porsche is on the verge of seizing it all.</p></blockquote>

<p>Dear Mr. Pickens,</p>
<p>Just recently you stated to the media that you expected oil prices to<br />return to record levels by the end of 2008.</p>
<p>Sir, you are a man who sticks by his word, so I would like to make a<br />wager with you if that is at all possible. Why? Because I think your<br />prediction will be dead wrong.</p>
<p>Mr Pickens, you are a man who has spent decades making billions of<br />dollars out of the oil industry. I, on the other hand, am a 39 year old<br />self-taught economist who works as a substitute high school teacher.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I believe that you are dead wrong on this, and I would<br />like to challenge you to a wager.</p>
<p>I have stated on this blog recently my belief that oil prices will drop<br />below $100 within the next 12 months. I stand by this prediction, even<br />though it disagrees with yours.</p>
<p>As a result, I would like to make a bet with you on this matter. The bet<br />will go as follows:</p>
<p>    * In order for T. Boone Pickins to win the bet, the price of West<br />Texas Intermediate must equal or exceed $147.28 per barrel on or before<br />December 31st, 2008.</p>
<p>    * In order for One Salient Oversight to win the bet, the price of<br />West Texas Intermediate must be below $100 at any point on or before<br />December 31st, 2008, and must never equal or exceed $147.28 during that<br />period either.</p>
<p>    * If West Texas Intermediate prices neither drop below $100 nor<br />equal or exceed $147.28 on or before December 31st, 2008, then neither<br />individual will win the bet.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m trying to work out an appropriate amount. I&#8217;m willing to place<br />US$100 on the line. I will leave it up to you to determine your own amount.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,</p>
<p>Neil Cameron<br />aka &#8220;One Salient Oversight&#8221;<br />Newcastle, NSW, Australia</p>

                                <p>The essence of &#8220;market-based&#8221; health care &#8220;reforms&#8221; is that patients are exposed to the prices of the services that they receive (or are offered) and choose not to consume those with low perceived net benefits.  With high-deductible health plans favored by conservative reformers, this means paying out of pocket for routine services. [*] This is a centerpiece of <a href="http://www.johnmccain.com/Informing/Issues/19ba2f1c-c03f-4ac2-8cd5-5cf2edb527cf.htm">health care reform a la McCain</a>, in the mild camouflage of &#8220;innovative insurance&#8221; and &#8220;expand[ed] benefits of health savings accounts.&#8221;  [**] These plans already have been growing rapidly with a push from Bush and congressional Republican policies.</p>
<p>So how are they working out?  <a href="http://www.startribune.com/business/27701694.html?elr=KArksUUUU">In the S&#8217;trib&#8217;</a>, Chen May Yee finds that market magic does not always include putting enough dollars in those pockets:
</p>
<blockquote><p>Once a month, doctors and staff at Edina [Minnesota] Sports Health &#038; Wellness stay late to talk business&#8230;. Then there&#8217;s the topic nobody likes: which patients to drop because they aren&#8217;t paying their bills.</p>
<p>The clinic has been terminating an average of 16 patients a month. Most have high-deductible health plans and haven&#8217;t paid their bills for more than nine months&#8230;</p>
<p>Break-up letters from doctors are just one unintended consequence in the roll-out of high-deductible plans, the fastest-growing segment of the medical insurance market as traditional plans become ever more unaffordable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yee reports that the breakups happen in relatively special cases (e.g. small clinics that can&#8217;t afford to provide much uncompensated care) and information on the extent of the phenomenon is anecdotal.  However, larger organizations are seeing increases in uncompensated care provided to the theoretically-insured:
</p>
<blockquote><p>Last year, [Hennepin County Medical Center] gave away $86 million in uncompensated care &#8212; $4 million, or 4.7 percent, to insured patients. This year, HCMC expects $90 million in uncompensated care, with 8.4 percent, or $7.5 million, from insured patients&#8230;</p>
<p>Fairview Health Services, Regions Hospital and HealthEast Care System also are seeing more unpaid bills from insured patients. Like HCMC, they&#8217;re nonprofit, with policies not to turn patients away.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I might suggest that a system is only so market-based when it relies on the public or (publicly-subsidized) nonprofit sectors to cover its failures.  And for an added bonus, the system is not necessarily cheaper to administer:
</p>
<blockquote><p>Medical billing offices are working harder than ever. What used to be paid by insurance in a couple of weeks is now being stretched out to two- to six-month payment plans for patients, said Randi Tapio, chief executive of Medical Billing Professionals in St. Cloud, a firm that works with independent physician offices.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re sending statements every month, calling them,&#8221; Tapio said. &#8220;Our costs go up.&#8221;</p>
<p>If a patient is uninsured, a clinic can ask for payment upfront or devise an early payment plan. But with insured patients, health plans require that clinics wait until after the service and the health plan determines who owes what. By then, the patient is out the door.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But never fear, improved bill-collection technology is here!</p>
</p>
<blockquote><p>Recently, [a] clinic began asking patients having costly procedures such as surgeries to swipe a credit card upfront. An estimated amount is authorized but not charged until the health plan sends a letter saying what the patient owes&#8230;</p>
<p>HealthEast clinics are looking into check-in kiosks, like those at airports, where patients insert a credit card and are asked if they want to pay their co-pay.</p>
<p>&#8220;The thing is to be more intentional about collecting,&#8221; said Keith Rahn, who oversees HealthEast clinic billing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=U.S._Chamber_of_Commerce">U.S. Chamber of Commerce</a> has been running &#8216;issue ads&#8217; telling Minnesotans that Sen. Norm Coleman has been working to keep government out of health care decisions.  The credit-card companies, not so much.</p>
<p></p>
<p>[*] Which is to say, the premise of the system is that its biggest problem is overconsumption of routine care.  In this regard, it runs against the current of some traditional health plans which have been reducing out-of-pocket shares for some expenditures (e.g. related to chronic conditions like diabetes) because their members are perceived as not being good at picking and paying for the higher-return care.</p>
<p>[**] Amusingly, while Obama issues pages generally link to more detailed <a href="http://www.barackobama.com/pdf/issues/HealthCareFullPlan.pdf">briefing documents</a> [PDF], a &#8220;Learn More About the McCain Health Care Reform Plan&#8221; link takes visitors to <a href="http://www.johnmccain.com/healthcare/">this page</a> with a few bullet points and an auto-playing video ad, which in turn links back to the issues page for &#8220;the facts.&#8221;</p>

<blockquote><p>The problem is too many airplanes sharing too little space in the sky, giving New York the worst air congestion nationwide … To manage the congestion, Bush administration officials have grudgingly maintained caps on the number of flights per hour at the three airports &#8212; Kennedy, La Guardia and Newark Liberty &#8212; and have even added new caps, though such measures run counter to the White House&#8217;s pro-competition principles. Capping the number, officials complain, hinders competition by preventing new, upstart airlines from entering the market, and existing airlines from expanding operations. To mitigate the impact of the caps, the administration is now proposing to auction off some takeoff and landing slots to the highest bidder.  The proposal has the support of New York Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg (I), but it has sparked an ideological battle over how far market controls should extend in the skies, attracting fierce opposition from figures such as Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) and from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which runs the three major area airports &#8230; The larger auction plan would compel major airlines to give up 10 percent to 20 percent of their takeoff and landing slots over time so that they could be put up for auction. &#8220;The resource is scarce and the best way to allocate it is a price mechanism,&#8221; said Tyler D. Duvall, the Transportation Department&#8217;s acting undersecretary for policy. &#8220;It&#8217;s part of a larger picture: We&#8217;ve got congestion on the roads, in our ports, in our airports,&#8221; Duvall added, outlining the wider policy of the current administration. In each of these cases, he said, the market can best clear the way. But others say auctions will do nothing to resolve the capacity problem, and could cause more confusion and incur more costs for customers than they relieve.</p></blockquote>
<p>Greg supports the Bush-Bloomberg proposal and got an email from Hal Varian:</p>
<blockquote><p>In your blog you cite a Washington Post article that says &#8220;But others say auctions will do nothing to resolve the capacity problem&#8230;&#8221; This isn&#8217;t quite right. In certain circumstances, the optimal congestion prices send the right signals for marginal capacity expansion. Hence expanding capacity by using the present value of the optimal congestion fees will result in thesocially optimal level of capacity. This is sometimes know as the Strotz-Mohring theorem</p></blockquote>
<p>Varian co-authored a paper on Pricing Congestible Network Resources with <a href="http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~hal/Papers/pricing-congestible.pdf">Jeffrey K. MacKie-Mason</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Despite the simplicity of rationing and quotas, economists tend to favor pricing mechanisms as a way of alleviating congestion. One important feature of congestion prices is that they not only discourage usage when congestion is present, but they also generate revenue for capacity expansion. Indeed, it has long been recognized that under certain conditions the optimal congestion prices for a fixed amount of capacity will automatically generate the appropriate amount of revenue to finance capacity expansion.</p></blockquote>
<p>The authors are careful to note that this conclusion assumes perfect competition with free entry as in Varian’s “certain conditions”.  But do those conditions hold in this case?</p>
