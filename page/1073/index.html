<blockquote><p>WASHINGTON (Reuters) &#8211; Rising real estate prices and a resurgent U.S. stock market pushed the net wealth of American households to a record high in the fourth quarter of 2004, the Federal Reserve said Thursday. In its quarterly &#8220;Flow of Funds&#8221; report, the central bank said household balance sheet values rose to $48.53 trillion in the fourth quarter, up from $46.59 trillion in the third quarter. The third quarter net worth was originally reported at $46.68 trillion, which had also been a record. </p></blockquote>
<p>Household wealth at the end of 1999 was $42.44 trillion so this represents a 14.3% increase in the nominal value of wealth.  Prices over the same period have risen by about 10.6% so it is even true that real wealth is higher than it was five years ago.  Since population has increased by about 5.2% over the last five years, real household wealth per capita is not at record levels.</p>

                                <p>is the title of <a href="http://irm.wharton.upenn.edu/WP-security-smetters.pdf">this paper</a> by Kent Smetters, which is my way of saying thank you to <a href="http://www.williampolley.com/blog/archives/2005/03/index.html#000223">William Polley</a> for refereeing the debate between a Dead Parrot (Victor) and the Baby Angrybear (that’d be me).  Kent’s paper puts the 2018 v. 2042 debate into a nice context both theortetically and historically.  Kent also presents evidence for what I’d call the “Squander the Surplus” hypothesis.  </p>
<p>The Squander the Surplus, however, is not the same as the Starve the Beast hypothesis.  Yes, Reagan fiscal policy, which has been revived by Bush43, is indeed racking up huge increases in the General Fund’s debt.  But what led to these General Fund deficits.  While some on the right wish to say it was an increase in Federal spending, Lawrence Kudlow often writes about how Reagan cut spending.  They are both wrong.  Sure, Bush43 has increased Federal spending relative to GDP but the main reason for his General Fund deficit is his insistence on large and permanent income tax cuts.  </p>
<p>Victor makes some interesting points including noting the Federal spending fell in the 1990’s, but note this was due entirely to the peace dividend.  And no one would suggest that the Evil Empire fell because of the 1981 tax cut – no one except Mr. Kudlow, that is.  Victor also brought up Barro’s tax smoothing argument, which is an interesting one – but cutting taxes in 1981 or in 2001 was anything but smoothing unless you believe there was some magic wand to erase Federal spending.  Finally, Victor’s point about state&#038;local spending rising during the 1990’s is relevant to the degree that some conservatives might rightfully point to Federal revenue sharing as being a fair chunk of change.  NRO’s econopundits have made a big deal about this one, but I wish they would just once admit that these increases were in the big three ticket items: education, public order, and health care.  Why?  Because unless the 2006 GOP campaign is going to be about slashing education and health care budgets and taking cops off the street, eliminating Federal revenue sharing is nothing more than a backdoor state&#038;local tax increase.  Similarly, the Bush plan to raid the lockbox but still maintain the 12.4% payroll contribution is nothing more than a backdoor employment tax on young people.  </p>
<p>But back to Dr. Smetters.  As George W. Bush had the opportunity to discuss the Al Qaeda threat with Richard Clarke during the summer of terror (2001), he also could have seriously discussed Soc. Sec. reform with Dr. Smettters.  He did neither.  So to steal a line from <a href="http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/001204.html">Max Sawicky</a> (as I often do):</p>
<blockquote><p>no deals with dipsticks</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, I do not trust this White House to do Social Security reform.</p>

                                <p>The nation&#8217;s major lenders (esp. the big credit card issuers and auto finance companies) will reap significant returns on the investments that they have made in the form of <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/industries/indus.asp?Ind=F06">campaign contributions</a> to members of Congress (particularly Republicans).  In return for a few million dollars in contributions, lenders are being rewarded with <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/09/business/09bankruptcy.html?hp&#038;ex=1110430800&#038;en=0fe9010b66c74656&#038;ei=5094&#038;partner=homepage">passage of the bankruptcy bill</a>:<br />
<blockquote>WASHINGTON, March 8 &#8211; The Senate assured final passage of the first major overhaul of the nation&#8217;s bankruptcy laws in 27 years on Tuesday, when it took two votes that cleared the remaining political obstacles to a measure that the nation&#8217;s credit and retail industries have sought for years.</p>
<p>The bill would disqualify many families from taking advantage of the more generous provisions of the current bankruptcy code that permit them to extinguish their debts for a &#8220;fresh start.&#8221; It would also impose significant new costs on those seeking bankruptcy protection and give lenders and businesses new legal tools for recovering debts.</p></blockquote>
<p>The finance industry is not in particular trouble, and personal bankruptcies are not threatening the profitability of lenders.  Capital One Financial earned about $1.5 bn in profits in 2004, MBNA will earn over $2 bn in profits in 2004, and American Express earned about $3.5 bn in profits in 2004, to give just a few examples of the major beneficiaries of the bankruptcy reform bill.  </p>
<p>The bankruptcy system does get abused from time to time, particularly by wealthy individuals who are able to shield their assets from bankruptcy court; but as Krugman pointed out in his column <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/08/opinion/08krugman.html?n=Top%2FOpinion%2FEditorials%20and%20Op-Ed%2FOp-Ed%2FColumnists%2FPaul%20Krugman">yesterday</a>, the Senate specifically rejected efforts to address the problem of high-income bankruptcy abusers.  Instead, <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/03/whats-wrong-with-bankruptcy-reform.html">as I&#8217;ve described earlier</a>, the new law will just make it easier for creditors to squeeze more money from low-income debtors.  </p>
<p>There&#8217;s no economic justification for this new law, no social justification for this new law, no major existing problem that this new law will solve.  The law is simply the result of lobbying efforts by one particular industry to enact legislative changes that will increase their profits.  That fits my definition of rent-seeking behavior.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>The <a href="http://www.deadparrots.net/archives/social_security/0503national_savings_and_social_security_part_deux.html#more">Dead Parrot</a> responds to my contention that the 1983 Soc. Sec. reforms prefunded the baby boomers retirements:</p>
<blockquote><p>Ok, I&#8217;ll say it. The 1983 reform and Trust Fund didn&#8217;t work. The payroll tax led to increased government spending (although the excess tax revenue under Reagan wasn&#8217;t terribly large).  But more critically, the IOUs in the Trust Fund were not freely sold on the market; the interest rate on those IOUs is formulaically determined.</p></blockquote>
<p>This in a long line of rather weak replies to his critics may have been the weakest of all.  Government spending as a share of GDP did NOT go up during the 1980’s and actually fell as a result of the peace dividend.  Yes, total Federal debt rose AS A RESULT OF THE TAX CUTS.  As far as the interest rate being “formulaically determined”, my understanding is that these rates track market rates.  If I am wrong and if the formula is below market rates, then the Trust Fund is subsidizing the General Fund.  Odd – we have covered this already noting that one of Bush’s plans to steal our retirement funds is exactly that.  </p>
<p>To be fair, he concedes we will need to raise taxes to fix the General Fund deficit.  He then writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Social Security represents the one place where future spending reductions can be committed to well in advance &#8211; indeed they have to be.</p></blockquote>
<p>How does this reduce Federal government purchases or the rising spending on health care?  Or are you suggesting we have to cut Soc. Sec. retirement benefits?  Conservatives love to say cut spending but they are loath to be specific on the specifics.  Of course, my ire is not directed at the honest conservatives who do admit there is no free lunch, but rather at the political hacks in the Bush Administration who continue to tell us there is.  </p>
<p>The Dead Parrot also seems to be hung-up on the notion there is no expected return benefit from privatization:</p>
<blockquote><p>In sum, Waldmann&#8217;s argument is that the interest rate is the inverse of the price of tomorrow&#8217;s consumption; as with any price change, there is the possibility that there will be offsetting income and substitution effects. Therefore, if privatization boosts the rate of return on your wealth, tomorrow&#8217;s consumption is now cheaper. The important thing to note here is that in his analysis and in virtually all cases, tomorrow&#8217;s consumption will go up; this, of course, is the entire goal of an increased flow of saving. If increased consumption can be achieved instead because of an increased stock of wealth, well, then that&#8217;s fine with me.</p></blockquote>
<p>What did <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/03/privatization-becker-v-snow-dead.html">Gary Becker</a> say about this?</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Has <a href="http://www.humaneventsonline.com/article.php?id=6775">Jack Kemp</a> told us how government spending will magically fall in 2018 as he writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>The raid on Social Security revenues will end in 2018, when there won&#8217;t even be enough of your FICA contributions coming into Washington to cover the entire cost of current Social Security benefits because there will be so few workers contributing to support all the current retirees.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course not – but Kemp is assuming like the Dead Parrot the starve the beast theory (along with its converse feed the beast = more government spending).  But the last 35 years of U.S. fiscal policy history suggests starving the beast does not work – whereas the Clinton tax increases were correlated with a drop in Federal spending.  </p>
<p>Kemp also misrepresented Sen. Durbin’s Meet the Press interview.  Durbin is opposed to carve-outs but he is not opposed to add-ons.  Yep – Senator McConnell insisted we stop campaigning as they continue to campaign with brazen lies.  </p>
<p>And AB reader Drew noted that I meant to say we had a peace dividend in the 1990&#8217;s.  Thanks!</p>
<p><strong>Update 2</strong>: <em>The Dead Parrot Contradicts Himself </em>&#8211; First, <a href="http://www.deadparrots.net/archives/social_security/0503savings_and_social_security_the_pgl_post.html">he writes</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I am presenting to the blogosphere the radical proposition that extra government revenue tends to lead &#8211; at least in part &#8211; to extra government spending. PGL disagrees…In my original post I pointed out that the excess payroll tax revenue in the 1980s wasn&#8217;t that great, so there wouldn&#8217;t have been a large effect in that decade.</p></blockquote>
<p>As if payroll taxes had some special effect by themselves – sort of like Bruce Bartlett worried about VAT taxes.  Then he writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>My sole point here is that this structure for the Trust Fund assets is consistent with the view that payroll tax revenue is a substitute for other revenue (even if you don&#8217;t believe *less* revenue encourages less spending, surely the reverse is true and more revenue will encourage more spending).</p></blockquote>
<p>Now here I agree – and my simple point was that starve the beast did not lower government spending.  The REAL debate here is who will pay for future government spending as in an explicit income tax increase versus the Bush Social Security deform aka a back door employment tax increase.  Can you just admit as much?  </p>
<p>I always suggested to the Dead Parrot that Robert Waldman never endorsed, the Cato premise that privatization induces individuals to hold more stocks noting Becker’s WSJ op-ed piece.  He notes with approval the piece but does not realize it undermines his substitution argument.</p>
<p>Victor – I love a good debate, but your contradictions are almost as tiresome as your misrepresentations of other people’s positions.  And I don’t oppose a rational and honest means of insuring against the Bush proposal to steal our retirement funds.  I just don’t trust the GOP to implement what you are suggesting.</p>

But on reading the explosion of comments since Brad challenged Mankiw’s contention that Bush’s privatization will not lower national savings, I may have been less than clear <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/03/privatizing-social-security-and.html">here</a> on at least a couple of points – both related to why I raised Ricardian Equivalence, which is a starting point and not the end point for this discussion.  </p>
<p>#1: I was not trying to add to the reasons why privatization might lower national savings.  In fact, the reason I raised the Sargent-Wallace game of chicken was to suggest a move to fiscal integrity could raise national savings.  Yes, the L in PGL stands for liberal, but notice that I often bring up the wisdom of conservatives as in my last commenting noting how Becker disagrees with the free lunch idea.  And if a Bushie want the best explanation of why Becker and I may be shortchanging the benefits of investing Trust Fund assets in the stock market, read the writings of “liberal” Brad DeLong on this issue.</p>
<p>#2: I only stated without emphasis that Brad had noted a Mankiw-esque reason why national savings might fall so let me note the few line:</p>
<p><strong><br />
<blockquote>If holders of defined-contribution private accounts regard them as close substitutes for their other assets in a way that promised defined-benefit standard Social Security was not, then the Bush plan will be yet another budget-busting shift of the tax burden that will slow economic growth.</p></blockquote>
<p></strong><br />Now let me link to <a href="http://post.economics.harvard.edu/faculty/mankiw/papers/aea1.pdf">Mankiw’s</a> <em>The Savers-Spenders Theory of Fiscal Policy</em>.  Mankiw claims some households are liquidity constrained.  Now I’m not sure if the Bush plan would relax those liquidity constraints precisely because Bush refuses to give specifics.  But if it does and if one believes liquidity constraints are important as Mankiw does, then how can one appeal to Ricardian logic.</p>
<p>Incidentally, the fellow who said Brad declared that Trust Fund assets are not real has got to be kidding me.  All he said was that the Bush plan might make them more liquid.  I wish our friend David Altig had pointed this out.</p>

                                <p>Jck the Hack Snow appeared on ABC’s <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000087&#038;sid=ar15ghYFz13M&#038;refer=top_world_news">This Week</a> and made it clear that the Bush White House is interested in the carve-out version of privatization and not the add-on version of personal accounts.  He claimed that this plan, which takes away some of your retirement funds, can make you better off because of the magic of compounding.  Never mind the fact that the bonds in the Trust Fund earn interest.  And in case, the Cato crowd wishes to claim that returns on private accounts are higher than returns in government accounts, let’s check out what conservative economist <a href="http://www.opinionjournal.com/extra/?id=110006321">Gary Becker</a> recently wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Contrary to the Bush position, however, I do not believe that the main advantage of a private-account system is that individuals can get a higher return on their old-age savings by investing in stocks. There are no freebies from such investments since the higher return on stocks is related to their greater risk and other trade-offs between stocks and different assets.. Retirees for whom Social Security income is not a major part of their retired assets will invest much of their own savings in stocks. Studies indicate that this is precisely what they generally do with their IRAs in order to have a balanced portfolio between stocks and the implicit Social Security assets guaranteed them. Since lower-income persons accumulate few assets other than their Social Security assets, a fully funded system through personal savings would enable them to have more balanced portfolios between stocks and bonds.</p></blockquote>
<p>Becker’s position is in line with Robert Barro’s: no free lunch so their call for privatization is a political one – not an economic one.  A <a href="http://www.deadparrots.net/archives/social_security/0503savings_and_social_security.html">Dead Parrot</a> tries to argue that privatization would raise national savings:</p>
<blockquote><p>Overall, conservatives hope that national savings will increase in the long-run, however, because (a) this will encourage everyone to become an investor and (b) this is the first step toward moving from a mostly pay-as-you-go system to a fully funded system. If there is one thing that economists seem to agree on, it is that a fully-funded system likely helps fuel growth.</p></blockquote>
<p>In their shooting down of the Parrot’s argument (a), <a href="http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/movable_type/2005-3_archives/000480.html">Brad DeLong</a> and <a href="http://rjwaldmann.blogspot.com/2005/03/brad-delong-and-dead-parrot-debate.html">Robert Waldman</a> argue the offsetting income effect:</p>
<blockquote><p>Now conservatives like to go on and on about how offering a better return on savings will cause increased savings due to the substitution effect. They have noticed that no one has noticed that there is also an income effect so the sign of the total effect is ambiguous.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words – if there is this free lunch benefit, households might consume more.  Becker and Barro, however, argue there is no such free lunch benefit.  Alas, Becker does spend a lot of time with the pay as you go argument as does the Dead Parrot.  Has the Parrot been asleep since 1982?  What was that Social Security reform in 1983, which Sen. Kennedy praised on This Week, supposed to do if not prefund the retirement benefits of the Baby Boom generation?  Maybe the argument is that Reagan and Bush has squandered it to subsidize the massive General Fund deficits, but I wish conservatives would just say that.  Besides, why not fix the General Fund by reversing the income tax cuts rather than stealing from our retirement accounts?</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_luskin/luskin200503070953.asp">Donald Luskin</a> wants you to believe that Al Gore supports George Bush’s privatization proposal:</p>
<blockquote><p>There’s a way that the advocates of reform could easily make this case. All they have to do is borrow a famous buzzword from none other than Al Gore. No, I’m not kidding. The fact is that personal accounts are nothing less than a Social Security lockbox.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you follow his link to the October 3, 2000 debate, you will see what Gore really said:</p>
<blockquote><p>I will balance the budget every year. I will pay down the national debt. I will put Medicare and Social Security in a lockbox and protect them…I think we need to put Medicare and Social Security in a lockbox. The governor will not put Medicare in a lockbox. I don&#8217;t think it should be used as a piggy bank for other programs. I think it needs to be moved out of the budget and protected. I&#8217;ll veto anything that takes money out of Social Security or Medicare for anything other than Social Security or Medicare.</p></blockquote>
<p>What does this mean?  It appears to mean the same thing that Bill Clinton was implying when he said let’s save Social Security first – to which fiscally responsible Speaker Gingrich wildy applauded.  No, neither Clinton nor Gore was endorsing the Bush carve-outs even if the Luskinites tell you otherwise.   </p>
<p>And Luskin cannot pretend that Bush and Speaker Hastert have not blown the efforts of Clinton, Gingrich, and Gore to avoid massive General Funds, which may require stealing from the Trust Funds as Luskin writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>That means, effectively, that the Trust Funds get an IOU from the general fund of the government and the government gets to spend the money.</p></blockquote>
<p>The “government” that Luskin refers to is the Bush Administration that Luskin supports.  Let’s do something that the Luskinites never do – be honest about other things Gore siad in the 2004 campaign, such as “do more for you” and a tax cut, too.  Senator Kerry had the same msessage confusion during the 2004 campaign.  But the Bush Administration aided by Speaker Hastert has delivered on making sure that the General Fund must be subsidized by raiding the lock box big time.  </p>
<p>I could say that the Luskinite campaign for the Bush Social Security deform is based on a parade of lies as I could say the earth is round.  But both statements are obvious.</p>

One of the interesting statistics contained in it is the fraction of foreign currency assets owned by international banks that is held in dollars.  This fraction seems to have fallen during 2003 and 2004:<br />
<blockquote>March 7 (<a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000080&#038;sid=aQZ4mO8F8SHY&#038;refer=asia">Bloomberg</a>) &#8212; Asian banks, including central banks, reduced the share of their deposits held in dollars in favor of the euro, yen and other currencies in the third quarter of last year, the Bank for International Settlements said. The share of deposits denominated in the U.S. currency fell to 67 percent, from 81 percent in the same period in 2001, the Basel-based BIS said in its quarterly review published today. Total dollar deposits increased, it said.</p>
<p>&#8230;Indian and Chinese banks showed the biggest drop. The share of deposits in dollars was reduced to 43 percent of the total from 68 percent in the third quarter of 2001. Chinese lenders cut the share to 68 percent from 83 percent, the BIS said.</p></blockquote>
<p>I had a couple of immediate reactions to this.  First, the obvious question is whether this trend away from dollar assets will continue.  Without a doubt, much of it (at least for private sector banks) is because of fears that the dollar is headed for a significant decline in value, particularly against Asian currencies.  That probably explains why Indian and Chinese banks showed the biggest drops in dollar asset shares.  Once the dollar falls against those Asian currencies, it seems plausible that the diversification away from dollar assets might stop.</p>
<p>My second reaction was to wonder about the following.  Suppose that the big fall in the dollar happens, so that the exchange rate risk of holding dollars is perceived to be largely gone.  Isn&#8217;t it possible that international banks will have become used to holding euro assets instead, and be relatively uninclined to shift back into dollar assets simply because they&#8217;re <em>dollars</em>?  In other words, I wonder if there might not be some hysteresis inherent to this phenomenon, so that the more that international banks hold non-dollar foreign currency assets, the less interested in holding dollar assets they become.  </p>
<p>If so, then the continued propping up of the value of the dollar by Asian central banks (which is what is forestalling the hypothetical future big fall in the dollar) could well have the unintended consequence of hastening the end of the dollar&#8217;s dominant status as the world&#8217;s reserve currency.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://cbs.marketwatch.com/news/story.asp?guid=%7B622EE2E0-AE4D-4746-B0AB-616CD98BCE07%7D&#038;siteid=mktw&#038;dist=">This story</a> by Rex Nutting of <em>MarketWatch</em> warmed the cockles of my heart, for two reasons.  First, because at least one member of the regular business press seems to be catching on to Greenspan:<br />
<blockquote>Greenspan did President Bush two big favors this past week, endorsing the president&#8217;s calls for fundamental reforms in Social Security and tax policy. Greenspan said the U.S. economy could &#8220;stagnate&#8221; if Congress raised taxes or borrowed more money to pay for all the promises Washington has made to the elderly and those soon to be. Like it or not, Greenspan said, government spending must be slashed.  Reid, the combative Nevada Democrat, said Greenspan was acting like a partisan &#8220;hack.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve may consider itself above politics, but its chairman definitely isn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>&#8230;What really got Reid&#8217;s hackles up was Greenspan&#8217;s denial of his own role in fostering the fiscal problems he was decrying. Greenspan endorsed the Bush tax cut of 2001 because, without them he said, the surplus could become dangerously large.</p>
<p>How wrong that forecast was! Instead, the projected surplus is now become an endless deficit, and Greenspan&#8217;s logic has undergone a similar U-turn.  Now, he says, it would be folly to roll back the tax cuts that led to the deficits, because higher taxes would cripple the economy. And yet the U.S. economy enjoyed one of its greatest growth periods ever under those higher tax rates.</p></blockquote>
<p>The second reason I enjoyed reading this story was because it notes that Reid&#8217;s reaction was vigorous, entirely appropriate, and out of character for Democrats in Washington:<br />
<blockquote>Reid&#8217;s rude assessment of Greenspan was a bit of a shock, mostly because Washington is used to having Greenspan walk all over Congress, especially the Democrats. A Democratic leader with a spine is something we&#8217;ll have to get used to.</p>
<p>By calling Greenspan on his partisan testimony this week, Reid also sent a message to Bush that the Democrats won&#8217;t roll over if he nominates a full-time partisan hack as Fed chairman when Greenspan&#8217;s term is up next January. </p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s refreshing to see the Democratic leadership in Washington treat Greenspan the way he deserves&#8230; and to see that at least some of the press agrees.</p>
