<p>In case you hadn&#8217;t heard about it, Gingrich would offer taxpayers a choice to pay tax under current policy or at a 15% rate, with zero taxation of capital gains, dividends and interest that accrues mostly to the rich and uberrich, while corporate tax rate would be reduced to a mere 12.5%.  For the rich, the 15% rate on their ordinary income and the 0% rate on their predominant form of income (capital gains and income from capital) would be a windfall.  For corporations, it would practically amount to the elimination of the corporate tax.  It should be no surprise that tax revenues would decline substantially: the <a href="http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/numbers/displayatab.cfm?Docid=3252&#038;DocTypeID=2">Tax Policy Center study of Gingrich&#8217;s plan</a>estimates by $1.3 trillion over a decade.  While the lower two quintiles would get an average tax cut of about $440, the top 1% (starting at incomes of about $629,000) would get an average $344,000 cut and the top 0.1% (starting at incomes of about 2.868 million) an average $1.9 million cut.  Id. </p>

<p>Gingrich&#8217;s rationale is one that the right-wing American Enterprise Institute strongly supports&#8211;the tired old reaganomics rationale that eliminating taxes on capital will create new investments.  See, e.g., <a href="http://blog.american.com/2011/12/why-romney-is-wrong-and-gingrich-is-right-on-capital-gains-taxes/">Why Romney is Wrong and Gingrich is Right on Capital Gains Taxes</a>, AEI ( Dec. 12, 2011).  This theory is hogwash&#8211;lowering the return on investment by the piddling tax (whether 15% or 20%) will not keep folks from investing.  Folks will still make profits and they will still invest those profits, even if they have to pay taxes.  Paying no tax on dividends and capital gains won&#8217;t make the rich suddenly invest in entreprenuerial activities, my friends.  (Simply trading corporate stocks on the secondary market is not, by the way, entrepreneurial.)</p>
<p>The Gingrich website also objects that this plan is really good for everybody.</p>
<blockquote><p>An optional flat tax reform will be simple: Tax returns can be done on one sheet of paper,” the website says. “Subtract from income a standard deduction and deductions for charity and home ownership, multiply the result by the fixed, single rate of taxation of at most 15 percent, and the process is over.”  Wash. Post, above (quoting the website).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Folks, the hardest part of the income tax is figuring out whether you have income and how it is characterized (capital or ordinary).  Neither of those two difficulties disappears under Gingrich&#8217;s system.  Furthermore, ordinary fold really don&#8217;t have a very difficult time with their tax returns&#8211;they have wage income (withheld against), report the standard deduction and personal exemptions, and get a refund of part of the amount withheld.  The appeal to simplicity is a cover for the real purpose&#8211;to provide an unprecedented tax break to the wealthiest Americans at a time when the right is targeting Medicare and Social Security for cuts.  This is just one more example of class warfare from the right wing.</p>

                                <p>By <a href="http://www.economonitor.com/blog/author/rwilder3">Rebecca Wilder</a>  </p>
<p>EA Spreads: Why Should the Trend Change?
<p>They <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/10/world/europe/euro-zone-agrees-to-reinforce-maastricht-rules.html">changed the title</a>; but originally the NY Times reported “<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/10/world/europe/euro-zone-agrees-to-reinforce-maastricht-rules.html">Euro Zone Agrees to Reinforce Maastricht Rules</a>“.  That’s exactly what EA policy makers agreed to last week – not much to bring home.</p>
<p>The real shift in policy came from the ECB. <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financialcrisis/8949723/Merkels-Teutonic-summit-enshrines-Hooverism-in-EU-treaty-law.html">Ambrose Evans-Pritchard </a>highlights the ECB’s actions as ensuring some sort of bank profitability, while at the same time defining the buyer of EA sovereign bonds. The banks will access funding from the ECB for up to 3 years at a very low and variable rate &#8211; currently the policy rate is 1% – and earn a higher return on their holdings of government debt (This morning, Italian 2-yr debt is trading at 6.05% – not bad). The banks will be ‘encouraged’ to buy government debt, thereby ensuring a funding source for the sovereigns. But this is not a business model, neither for the banks nor for the sovereigns.</p>
<p>Europe is headed toward recession – in fact, it’s probably already contracting – and EU policy makers agreed to explicitly enforce contractionary policy. Kevin O’Rourke calls it a <a href="http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/orourke1/English">Summit of Death</a>, while Paul Krugman argues the impossibility of the grand <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/10/lessons-from-europe/">internal devaluation</a> experiment. I call it economic oppression coupled with zombie bank deleveraging – it is absolutely not in Spain’s best interest to be pushing sharp fiscal contraction while the private sector is itself deleveraging.</p>
<p>But alas, they’ve decided to put off the only credible solution, fiscal union, for another time. I suspect that global investors are going to see right through this simple fact. External investors will grow tired of the zombie deleveraging and recession, of which more selling will cheapen bonds further. Regarding bond spreads, why should this Summit lead to any different outcome than the ones before it? It shouldn’t.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a>
<p>Until EA policy makers make a concerted step toward fiscal union, the bond crisis will continue to evolve just as it has at each crossroad in the past. The european sovereign crisis will deteriorate further.</p>

<p>The chart above illustrates the average 10yr spread of the 9 bond markets listed over a like German bund alongside each major announcement date (see table below) through December 9. The trend has been up while volatile. Furthermore, no announcement to date has successfully stemmed the upward bias in bond spreads. EA policy makers consistently avoid the only truly credible answer: fiscal union.</p>

<p>American v. Brazilian Healthcare, a Continuing Series</p>
<p>I spoke to my sister on Skype last night.  She&#8217;s been in Natal, in Northeastern Brazil, for the past few months.   Last week, she noticed a couple small warts growing on her leg.  So she wandered down to a government run hospital and and had them removed.  The hospital was low on supplies, and the doctor asked her to contribute a box of Q-tips (since Q-tips would be needed in the procedure).  The total cost of the whole thing:  12 reais, or about $6.60 American, plus a box of Q-tips.  </p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t the first time I&#8217;ve had a post that dealt with my sister and the Brazilian health care system.  A few years ago I wrote about the time she had <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2007/12/american-medical-system-one-persons.html">emergency open heart surgery</a> in Brazil, and how it compared very favorably with her experience with (planned) open heart surgery in the US.  <br /><a name="more"></a><br />Now, on the subject of the US, my wife also has an interesting healthcare story to relate.  She got a letter from Aetna, her insurance provider, indicating they didn&#8217;t know why they were being asked to pay for services when she doesn&#8217;t have health insurance through them.  Interestingly enough, money is withdrawn from our bank account each month to pay for her health insurance, and a call to Aetna indicated that she did, in fact, have health insurance.  A number of phone calls back and forth between my wife, Aetna, and her doctor resolved the issue (I think) &#8211; the doctor is being paid, etc.  But it isn&#8217;t the first time this has happened, and it serves to follow up our family&#8217;s <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/09/health-insurance-american-style.html">earlier experience with health insurance</a>.  All told, I would estimate my wife and I have spent about 40 hours &#8211; that would be a workweek &#8211; dealing with health insurance since July.  </p>
<p>Brazil is a poor country, and I don&#8217;t think anyone has ever suggested that the Brazilian health system is the best in the world.  On the other hand, we often hear precisely that about the American system from certain circles, despite the astounding cost (which doesn&#8217;t seem to include the waste of time dealing with the paperwork or fighting with health insurance companies) and ho-hum outcomes.  I&#8217;m starting to think a lot of Americans are absolutely insane.  Lord knows it would explain a lot.</p>

<p>UPDATE: <a href="http://blog.nj.com/njv_paul_mulshine/2011/12/hey_mitt_stop_explaining_and_s.html">Paul Mulshine</a> (h/t <a href="http://www.bluejersey.com/diary/19988/news-roundup-open-thread-for-wednesday-dec-14-2011">Blue Jersey</a>) claims that had Perry taken the bet—that is, had the courage of his convictions—he would &#8220;have awarded him the 10 grand.&#8221;*****  Instead, Perry claimed he&#8217;s &#8220;not a betting man,&#8221; all evidence contrariwise (e.g., his continuing this campaign) notwithstanding. Instead, the multimillionaire <a href="http://www.theblaze.com/blog/2011/12/12/perry-i-dont-have-10k-to-bet/">lied</a>.  Good thing he&#8217;s not running on character.</p>

<blockquote><p>@<a href="https://twitter.com/klhoughton">klhoughton</a> Dinner says he&#8217;s re-elected.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>which lead to a discussion of betting on Presidential elections, which I admitted <a href="https://twitter.com/klhoughton/status/98417826490097667" target="_blank">I only did once before</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>K: I did bet $10K that WJC would win. But that was the day of the election. Now, my biggest risk is that Romney beats Bachmann.</p>
<p>L: You bet HOW MUCH?????</p>
<p>K: $10,000. (Trade was vetoed by my boss. Long story. Still bitter.) Other side was someone who is prominent [and from what I can tell a major source] in [William D. Cohan’s] <em>House of Cards</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The bitter story below the fold.</p>
<p>It’s Election Day, 1992.  I am (somewhat) young, single, paying about $600/month in rent, and making Real Money for the first time in a year or so. (Ask your grandfather about the recession of 1990-1991.) In short, I am not liquidity-constrained.</p>
<p>Alan “Ace” Greenberg—the last CEO of Bear Stearns who was worth paying—had endorsed William Jefferson Clinton several months previously. He was the first head of a Wall Street firm to do so, but not the last.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, George H. W. Bush has been going around the country for the past week, campaigning as if he doesn’t want to win.  Or at least that’s the way it sounded to me, and I suspect the majority of the American people. It’s long after the Supermarket Scanner incident,** but he has spent the past two days yelling—calling Al Gore “Ozone Man” in Detroit—and generally Not Being Serious. For a candidate whose major strength is that he is Serious, it was clear that he was expecting to lose.</p>
<p>When the candidate expects to lose, it’s not a bad idea to bet against him. His information is likely better than yours, and his “tell” is showing.</p>
<p>So when one of the salespeople, who had a rather short temper, was pontificating at the end of the day about how GHWB was going to win that evening, I offered a friendly wager. At least, it started out that way.  But this is Wall Street.</p>
<blockquote><p>Ken: “Bet you $10 Clinton wins.” As I said, trying to keep it a friendly wager. We would spend more than $10 on lunch (which was a company expense anyway).</p>
<p>Salesman (irritated at being challenged): “Make it $100.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, when the mark says, “Take my money!” it’s at least a venial sin not to do so.  But if we’re going to talk about real money…</p>
<blockquote><p>Ken:  “Make it $1,000.”</p>
<p>Salesman (getting angrier): “If you’re that certain, make it $10,000.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At this point I hesitate. Not for effect, but just to do the calculations.  I know I have about $20,000 in liquid assets*** at the time, so another order of magnitude is out of the question.****  Can I afford to lose A Sure Thing?  Absolutely.</p>
<blockquote><p>Ken: “Done.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At this point, my boss—who had met the soon-to-be-former President and still thought fondly of him—intervened. (It is left as an exercise whether he made it up to me in bonus.)</p>
<p>So when millionaire Willard “Mitt” Romney offers to bet $10,000 with <a href="http://www.salon.com/2011/08/30/rick_perry_rich/" target="_blank">millionaire Rick Perry</a> or <a href="http://wonkette.com/457137/newt-gingrich-a-mega-millionaire-sam-brownback-still-cant-get-any-respect-from-teen-twitterer" target="_blank">millionaire Newt Gingrich</a>, he’s basically fitting the minimum criterion for “this should get your attention.”  It’s hardly an “all-in”bet; as Hendrik Hertzberg notes, it’s more a <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/hendrikhertzberg/2011/12/gingrich-romney-debate.html" target="_blank">casual wager</a>.</p>
<p>As Francis Scott Key’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F._Scott_Fitzgerald" target="_blank">descendant</a> once noted, “The rich are different.” And Papa’s rejoinder, “Yes, they have more money” is especially relevant when judging how sincerely the person believes their position to be correct.</p>
<p>Mitt’s offer to his fellow multimillionaires isn’t notable for its size; what is notable is that—as with me nineteen years ago—neither Gingrich nor Perry was willing to call and raise him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>*Those who have read my last two posts will realize that I say this without the slightest hint of irony, and that your mileage may vary.</p>
<p>**I’m sympathetic to GHWB on that one, by the way.  I lived and shopped in Washington Heights at the time, so we didn’t have scanners in any of our supermarkets either.  No one managing those stores would even think about making that type of capital investment.  And I shopped in stores a lot more often than the President—or even the Vice President—of the United States ever would. Those being the two jobs GHWB had had since 1981, the odds of him having encountered a supermarket scanner are about the same as [pick famous actress not related to my neighbor’s husband or filming one of her novels] showing up on my front door.</p>
<p>***I may have been counting Lines of Credit as part of liquid assets.</p>
<p>****I’m certain, in retrospect, that he would have said “done” on $100K. And given that I would have estimated the probability of losing at less than 10%, economic theory says that I should have offered the higher amount, even knowing I couldn’t cover it.  I believe this is the theory recently used by MF Global, who were dealing on direct-from-Mario-Draghi information.</p>
<p>*****The AP <a href="http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2011/12/ap_factcheck_misstatements_abo.html">disagrees</a>, but I find myself agreeing with Mulshine—a strange feeling in itself.</p>

<blockquote><p>In its top of the hour news segment NPR reported that President Obama hoped that voters would give him credit for avoiding a second Great Depression. If this is an accurate representation of what President Obama said then it should have devoted a segment to economists&#8230;for trying to set an unbelievably low bar for measuring the success of his economic policy.</p></blockquote>
<p>The post has no elaboration itself, but readers are knowledgeable.  This is more like a topical thread&#8230;and of course relates to message and campaigns of the candidates.  But the Republican candidates have their own set of rhetorics.</p>

                                <p>By Jeff McCord of <a com_="http://www.the-investor-advocate.com/?p=2147484165">The Investor Advocate</a></p>
<p>Impending SEC Recommendation on Anti-Investor Supreme Court Decision a Bellwether on Regulator’s View of “Public Interest”</p>
<p>In one of its filings prior to U.S. Judge Jed Rakoff’s celebrated November 28th refusal to rubber stamp an SEC-Citicorp deal allowing the bank – a “recidivist offender” &#8212; to escape significant damages and an admission of wrongdoing for what may have been egregious, knowing fraud in Citi’s sale of bad mortgage-related assets to unwitting investors, the SEC incredibly asserted that “the public interest . . . is not part of [the] applicable standard of judicial review [of the proposed Citicorp settlement.]”   To that, Manhattan federal Judge Rakoff simply responded: “This is erroneous.”  [see Rakoff ruling <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/cases/show.php?db=special&#038;id=138">here</a> ]</p>
<p>Just a few years’ ago, the idea that a federal judge would need to remind a federal regulatory agency that the judicial and executive branches work on behalf of the public interest would have seemed ludicrous.  Now, it is long over-due.</p>
<p>An impending SEC recommendation to Congress (due in January) on whether an anti-US investor Supreme Court decision (Morrison, discussed below) should be overridden will help answer a timely question:  has the Commission heard and understood Judge Rakoff’s admonition?</p>
<p>“Prosecuting Bus Boys and Nannies rather than Wall Street Bandits”</p>
<p>When it comes to the need to hold Wall Street fraud perpetrators accountable in the public interest, the Justice Department itself received a wake-up call from one long-time Member of the House Judiciary Committee, Zoe Lofgren (D-CA,16th District), who in May <a target="_blank" com="" news="">said</a> prosecutors were more focused on immigration offenses than the on-going financial crisis:  <a name="more"></a><br />
<blockquote>The Department [of Justice] is spending its resources prosecuting nannies and bus boys who are trying to get back to their families.  And, yet we have not brought any prosecutions of the bandits on Wall Street who brought the nation and the world to the brink of financial disaster.  (Bloomberg) </p></blockquote>
<p>   Led by Lofgren, the California delegation of Democratic Members of Congress on October 10 called for Administration officials and the Federal Reserve to conduct an investigation into “systemic wrongdoing by financial institutions” in the mortgage markets.</p>
<p>Regulators Must Believe in Regulation to Prosecute White Collars, Professor Says</p>
<p>In a story on Judge Rakoff’s ruling, even the reliably establishment <a target="_blank" href="http://management.fortune.cnn.com/2011/12/01/will-the-sec-citi-settlement-rejection-make-a-difference/?section=magazines_fortune">FORTUNE magazine</a> opined:<br />
<blockquote>For decades, financial wrongdoers have been able to skip public accountability, and slide out from under the consequences by paying out a sometimes substantial sum and moving on to the next deal.</p></blockquote>
<p>Like Judge Rakoff’s obvious conclusion that the SEC should work on behalf of the public interest, University of California professor of criminology and law Henry N. Pontell made this “goes without saying” observation in a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/14/business/14prosecute.html?_r=1&#038;ref=business">New York Times</a> interview:<br />
<blockquote>When regulators don’t believe in regulation and don’t get what’s going on, there can be no major white-collar crime prosecutions.</p></blockquote>
<p>Denying US Investors’ Recourse When Foreign Stock Issuers Defraud Them</p>
<p>In what may be a bellwether on the SEC’s understanding of “what’s going on” in  relation to its mission of protecting investors in the public interest, in January the Commission must recommend to Congress whether or not it should override one of the most notorious anti-US investor Supreme Court decisions to come out of a Court not known for acting in the interests of investors, consumers or the public.  Specifically, the Dodd-Frank Act directs the SEC to review and make recommendations on Morrison v. National Australia Bank Ltd, a 2010 decision that denies U.S. investors the legal right to hold accountable any foreign listed company (such as Toyota, BP, Sony, DaimlerChrysler or Deutsche Bank) that defrauds them in a securities transaction &#8212; even if the wrongdoing takes place on U.S. soil.  The decision has caused many meritorious investor lawsuits to be tossed from U.S. courts, denying Americans recourse.</p>
<p>Many pension funds, retirement plans, investor and public interest groups have written letters asking the SEC to recommend Congress override Morrison. Fourteen public pension funds managing more than $700 million in retirement funds for teachers, policemen, firemen, and other public servants in California, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, North Carolina, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and other states made a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sec.gov/comments/4-617/4617-13.pdf">common sense argument</a>:<br />
<blockquote>[Morrison should be reversed because under that decision, foreign companies] can market their shares to American investors, can obtain a significant portion of their market capitalization from American investors, can file their financial statements with the [SEC], and can even engage in fraudulent conduct on U.S. soil, yet cannot be held liable under U.S. law to the victims of their fraud.</p></blockquote>
<p>And, the pension funds (like Judge Rakoff and more than one professor) reminded the SEC that its mission as stated on its own website is “to protect investors and maintain fair and orderly markets.”  The Exchange Act that established the SEC actually says protecting “the public interest and the interest of investors” are the objectives of the law.</p>
<p>Prudent Fund Management Practices “Turned Upside Down” by Supremes</p>
<p>For decades, to discharge their fiduciary responsibility, public pension funds have invested only in securities, including foreign stocks and bonds, protected under United States securities laws.   And, prior to Morrison for more than twenty years, modern portfolio management practices dictated that pension funds reduce risk through investment diversity – both by country and industry.<br />
<blockquote>For pension funds, investing in foreign based companies such as Toyota, Nokia, BP and others had been common and considered prudent,” explains Salvatore J. Graziano, a partner at the law firm of Bernstein Litowitz Berger and Grossman, LLP and president of the National Association of Shareholder and Consumer Attorneys.  “Fund managers knew that if a foreign company they invested in committed fraud, corporate governance abuses, or other wrongdoing within the United States or harmed U.S. investors, they could hold such a company and its managers accountable and seek recovery of their investment losses in U.S. District Courts.  These fund management practices and investor protections were turned upside down in 2010 by Morrison.</p></blockquote>
<p>Watch SEC on Morrison</p>
<p>Has the Administration heard and absorbed the messages sent to it by Judge Rakoff, many of America’s largest pension funds, professors and millions of polled individuals  that its’ Wall Street policies may have strayed from the public interest?  In coming weeks, watch what the SEC recommends to Congress regarding Morrison.<br /># # #</p>

<p>My problem isn&#8217;t Newt claiming credit for everything good which happened before he resigned in disgrace, it&#8217;s the numbers.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jobs_created_during_U.S._presidential_terms">Employment increased by less than 17 million jobs during the Reagan Presidency. </a> I call that pants on fire.  </p>
<p>The number for Clinton is net employment increase during the overlap of Clinton and Gingrich&#8217;s terms of office in Washington (so the Reagan number isn&#8217;t some fraction of the gross flow).  My guess is that he calculated starting at the trough of the recession (Republicans do that when the President in question isn&#8217;t named Obama).</p>

<p>Holiday Gift Guide Advice</p>
<p>Megan McArdle just put out what she calls the <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/life/archive/2011/12/holiday-gift-guide-2011-kitchen-edition/249434/">&#8220;Holiday Gift Guide 2011: Kitchen Edition</a>.  Not surprisingly, it doesn&#8217;t contain the sort of things that I (or I think, most Americans) would likely buy.  A Chinois, a KitchenAid KICA0WH Ice Cream Maker Attachment (which apparently is only useful if you know the giftee already has a KitchenAid stand mixer), and of course, a $1,500 Thermomix.  To be honest, I had no idea what most of the stuff on the list actually is.  We have a fairly large kitchen in our house, but I imagine if we owned half the stuff on McArdle&#8217;s list we&#8217;d need to get rid of the microwave, the fridge, and the oven to get around.  </p>
<p>As an economist, I would suggest seeking out <a href="http://patriotboy.blogspot.com/2011/11/amazon-review-kids-ghillie-suit-set.html">more practical advice</a>.</p>
