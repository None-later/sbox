<p>China wants foreign companies to disclose computer technology that keep e-mail and data secure. The Chinese term for &#8220;disclose&#8221; is &#8220;certify.&#8221; Beginning May 1, 2009, foreign companies will be required to certify their security technology. Hardware, firewalls, encryption schemes&#8230;all are up <a href="http://www.thestate.com/technology/story/614680.html?RSS=business">certification</a> or disclosure.<br />
<blockquote>The computer security rules cover 13 types of hardware and software, including database and network security systems, secure routers, data backup and recovery systems and anti-spam and anti-hacking software. Such technology is enmeshed in products sold by Microsoft Corp., Cisco Systems Inc. and other industry giants.</p></blockquote>
<p>A number of ducks are being shot with this latest China salvo:
<ol>
<li>Better Big Brother control over the Internet </li>
<li>Better positioning of their own standards and IT security companies.<br />
<blockquote>Giving regulators the power to reject foreign technologies could help to promote sales of Chinese alternatives.</p></blockquote>
</li>
<li>Better spying on your corporate competitors. Always nice to know what techniques they are using. &#8220;The better to eat you with, my dear.&#8221;</li>
<li>Better way of officially stealing IT technology.</li>
</ol>
<p>China says it is really a matter of national security.<br />
<blockquote>The agency that will enforce the rules, the China Certification and Accreditation Administration, said in a written statement they are meant to protect national security and &#8220;advance industry development.&#8221; But it did not respond to questions about what information companies must disclose and how foreign technology will be judged.</p></blockquote>
<p>In the name of national security, many corporations in America are willing to cooperate with U.S. governmental spying.</p>
<p>Our government simply wants the data&#8211;not necessarily the details of how it was obtained. China has gone one better, I guess. But then it has always been a quick study.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>by: Divorced one like Bush</p>
<p>Ok, the auto CEO&#8217;s are all lined up.  They get asked the populist setup question: Are you going to sell your jets?  And they just sat there, as dumb looking as could be.  They didn&#8217;t say a word.  Not a word!  To me, that proved they were the wrong people for the current job because either they did not know to answer or did not know what to answer with.</p>
<p>If the CEO&#8217;s not knowing to answer a basic setup question that should have been anticipated (read they should have gotten coached better if they did at all) is not enough to question their management ability (it also suggests the boards have not been asking any unexpected questions either over the term of their positions) well, consider <a href="http://www.truthdig.com/report/item/20081205_a_toyota_takeover_could_save_gm/">the following</a>: <br />
<blockquote>Last year General Motors ranked as the fifth-largest company in the world, with sales of $207 billion and a loss of around $2 billion. Toyota, meanwhile, ranked in 2007 as the sixth-largest company in the world, with sales approaching $205 billion and a profit of $14 billion. </p>
<p>Those numbers changed dramatically in 2008, with GM falling from fifth to ninth with sales of $182 billion and a loss of nearly $39 billion, while Toyota moved up to fifth place with sales of $230 billion and a profit of $15 billion.</p></blockquote>
<p>But, here is what really got me as I watched GM&#8217;s CFO, Ray Young (Mr. Young was instrumental in putting together GM&#8217;s long-term restructuring plan after Congress demanded that the Big Three present such plans&#8230;) on <a href="http://www.c-spanarchives.org/library/index.php?main_page=product_video_info&#038;products_id=282718-5">Washington Journal on 12/5/08</a><br />
<blockquote>&#8230;and that&#8217;s the reason why we support the concept yesterday, of this oversight committee to supervise the restructuring of our industry.<br />I think from our perspective, we&#8217;re very open.  There&#8217;s talk about having an automotive Czar designated by the government to look at the entire industry.<br />&#8230;the advantage of having this oversight committee and having an industry czar is the fact that they can look at the American automobile industry on a wholistic basis and determine how we can restructure the industry to be globally competitive.  </p></blockquote>
<p>In all this time of GM&#8217;s existence they have not been able to assess the market as a whole including globally to determine what was needed in order for them to be “globally competitive”?  What the hell have they been looking at?  Isn&#8217;t this suppose to be part of basic business management skill? Now they want government help to figure this out?  Is this not asking for central market control light, as in China and Russia American style? I don&#8217;t know whether to laugh at them or cry for us.</p>
<p>Remind me, what freakin&#8217; side of the fuel mileage standard argument were they on back in the 80&#8217;s <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/academic/political-science/speeches/bush.dir/b48.txtp">and 90&#8217;s</a>?<br />
<blockquote>July 21, 1992<br />                THE CLINTON-GORE CAFE PROPOSALS:<br />                   LOSS OF JOBS, LOSS OF LIVES<br />CLINTON: &#8220;In my administration, we&#8217;ll&#8230;seek to raise the average<br />goal for automakers to 40 mpg by the year 2000, 45 mpg by the<br />year 2020.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>And which industry took the positive concept of <a href="http://laramie.willshireltd.com/DynamicObsolescence.html">dynamic obsolescence </a>(continuous improvement to promote sales, excluding the wastefulness issue, that&#8217;s a different post) and turned it into the negative of <a href="http://repairny.com/our-world/86-planned-obsolescence-planned-junk.html">planned obsolescence</a>(early demise of the item to promote accelerated sales)?</p>
<p>Maybe I&#8217;m reading this response by Mr. Young wrong, and it is not that they are admitting that they don&#8217;t know what they have been doing, that they don&#8217;t know how to assess the market local or otherwise, in a way that leads them to be sustainably competitive.  </p>
<p>Maybe they are playing congress.  Sort of a: Hey, sure we&#8217;ll agree to some government oversight (is that all we have to say to get the money?).  But, if that is true, then they are being dishonest in their genuineness.  They are acting as frauds which means we would be fools to give them the money without expecting some management personnel changes.  We will have been played.</p>
<p>Personally I think it is both that they don&#8217;t know how to manage by virtue of the market profitability numbers presented above and by their very own CFO&#8217;s admission to wanting a communism economics inspired concept put in place for their market.  Though Mr. Young mostly noted Japan&#8217;s automotive market approach, so I guess he wants more of a socialistic form of central market control.  Imagine that, GM wants some form of socialism with a dash of communism.  They even use the Russian term for a central planner.  So, what say you of the <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2008/11/20/conservatives-blame-cafe/">republican persuasion</a>?  </p>

<blockquote><p>Chrysler is the smallest of the Big Three automakers, but it stands apart from its peers in another crucial respect. While General Motors and the Ford Motor Company are public corporations, Chrysler is controlled by one of the world’s richest and most secretive private investment companies.</p>
<p>That investment company is Mr. Snow’s employer, Cerberus Capital Management, which has used its wealth and deep connections in Washington to shape the debate over the foundering automakers to its advantage.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, Mr. Snow has personally lobbied Mr. Paulson and others for a federal rescue that would salvage Cerberus’s investments in Detroit. Cerberus has also deployed a corps of lobbyists and former government officials to secure a bailout and protect its interests.</p>
<p>Whether its efforts will work is unclear. But if they fail Cerberus and its partners could lose their daring bets on Detroit. Without a bailout Cerberus could lose about $2 billion and suffer a stinging blow to its reputation. With one it might eventually profit from its troubled deals.</p>
<p>Last year, Cerberus and about 100 co-investors bought 80.1 percent of Chrysler for $7.4 billion from the German carmaker Daimler. It also bought a controlling stake in GMAC, the finance arm of General Motors. Since then Chrysler has eliminated more than 30,000 jobs and struggled to keep itself afloat while its sales have plummeted. Cerberus is pressing to have Chrysler merge with G.M., but G.M. has said a tie-up is off the table. Chrysler is asking the government for $7 billion to get through the next few months.</p>
<p>Cerberus, named after the mythical three-headed dog that guards the gates of Hades, has a fierce reputation on Wall Street. Many bankers and investors are reluctant to talk openly about the company, which is renowned, even feared, for its hard-nosed deal-making.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/18/business/18citi.html">NYT</a> reports:</p>
<blockquote><p>With its losses mounting, Wall Street is cutting jobs faster — and deeper — than even pessimists had feared&#8230;</p>
<p>In one the largest single rounds of layoffs on record, not just for the financial industry but for any industry, Citigroup said on Monday that it planned to eliminate a staggering 52,000 jobs, or 14 percent of its global work force.</p>
<p>While Citigroup had announced its intention to do away with about half those jobs already, news of the additional cutbacks — and the sheer size of the total — underscored the flagging fortunes of the entire financial industry. Not since the early 1990s has an American company announced such a sharp reduction in one swoop.</p>
<p>But few think the pain will end there for Citigroup or its industry rivals. After years of breakneck growth during which the financial industry, its profits and its pay assumed outsize roles in the nation’s economic life, Wall Street is in the grips of its sharpest contraction in modern times. The industry has shed more than 120,000 workers since the beginning of 2007, and many predict at least 240,000 more will go this year and next.</p></blockquote>
<p>Robert Rubin maintains his pay as far as I can tell&#8230;millions since 1999 from Citigroup. I am glad Volcker was chosen.</p>

<p>Right Wingnuttia is ablaze. Time for some cold water.</p>
<p>There are a couple of lawsuits floating around concerning Obama&#8217;s alleged non-citizenship. One is <a href="http://news.justia.com/cases/featured/pennsylvania/paedce/2:2008cv04083/281573/">Berg v. Obama</a> which was dismissed due to lack of standing on October 24. Berg has appealed that to the Supreme Court which has not to my knowledge taken it up at all. The other case is <a href="http://origin.www.supremecourtus.gov/docket/08a407.htm">Donofrio v. Wells</a> which was thrown out at the NJ State Supreme Court. Donofrio applied for a stay to the US Supreme Court, which application was denied by Justice Souter and then for whatever reason referred to the full court by Justice Thomas. These two court cases seem to have been blended together in the fever swamps of the Right and it is time to sort them out a little.</p>
<p>Summary version: they got nothing. Nothing on the substance and nothing on the law. Those with a taste for bizaare conspiracy theories and debunking of same can follow me below the fold. Or you can do something more productive like grab a beer and watch football. Your choice.</p>
<p>Although Donofrio v. Wells is in some sense actually before the Supreme Court it almost certainly isn&#8217;t going anywhere. First there is no longer any serious question about where Obama was born, his office has a certified and sealed official copy of his birth certificate. FactCheck.org has clear photos (~2 meg jpgs) showing this in much better detail than the scanned version normally circulating the web. <a href="http://www.factcheck.org/elections-2008/born_in_the_usa.html">Born in the USA</a>. Second it would appear that even if Donofrio v. Wells was somehow upheld it would only apply to New Jersey. And third the NJ Attorney General seems to have throughly thrashed the legal reasoning. So much so that even the wingnuts have mostly moved on to Berg v. Obama.</p>
<p>Now while Berg v. Obama was dismissed in October due to lack of standing, the judge didn&#8217;t rule on the substance. Berg v. Obama asserts that Obama&#8217;s mother and hence Obama lost citizenship when she married Soetoro and moved to Indonesia. Now there is a lot more stuff revolving around this, claims of adoption, that Obama went by the name Barack Soetoro while in Indonesia, talk about Obama travelling to Pakistan on an Indonesian passport at age 20. But due to a lot of hard work by an Obama supporter running a reality constrained website called  <a href="http://tesibria.typepad.com/whats_your_evidence/2008/10/did-obama-becom.html">What&#8217;s your evidence</a>  we can see that the whole case falls apart both on substance and by mis-citing the statutes. Berg cited the 1940 Act, but it simply doesn&#8217;t support his claim to start with.<br />
<blockquote>From and after the effective date of this Act, a woman, who was a citizen of the United States at birth, and who has or is believed to have lost her United States citizenship <i>solely by reason of her marriage <u>prior to September 22, 1922</u></i>, to an alien, and whose marital status with such alien has or shall have terminated, if no other nationality was acquired by affirmative act other than such marriage,shall, from and after the taking of the oath of allegiance prescribed by subsection (b) of section 335 of this Act, be deemed to be a citizen of the United States to the same extent as though her marriage to said alien had taken place on or after September 22, 1922.</p></blockquote>
<p> <a href="http://tesibria.typepad.com/whats_your_evidence/1940_Nationality_Act_54_Stat_Ch3_s301-322.pdf">Sec 317(b) Nationality Act of 1940 (pdf)</a><br />Okay it would appear from this that women who married a foreign citizen before Sept 1922 by that act lost citizenship. This act provides an easy way to regain it. But Obama&#8217;s mother didn&#8217;t marry anyone prior to that date, she was not even born, meaning this part of the act doesn&#8217;t even pertain. Not that it would matter.<br />
<blockquote>Sec 401: A person who is a national of the United States, whether by birth or naturalization, shall lose his nationality by: (a) Obtaining naturalization in a foreign state, either upon his own application or through the naturalization of a parent having legal custody of such person: Provided, however, That nationality not be lost as the result of the naturalization of a parent unless and until the child shall have attained the age of twenty-three years without acquiring permanent residence in the United States:</p></blockquote>
<p>Even if Obama&#8217;s mother had somehow naturalized as an Indonesian (by effect of law or application) and so equally naturalized her minor son, that son could still regain U.S. citizenship by acquiring permanent residence by the age of 23. Which Obama of course did. But even that only matters a little. Because the Nationality Act of 1940 cited by Berg is not even the right one to apply in this case. Instead you would want to look at the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952<br />
<blockquote>From and after the effective date of this Act a person who is a national of the United States whether by birth or naturalization, shall lose his nationality by &#8212; (1) obtaining naturalization in a foreign state upon his own application, upon an application filed in his behalf by a parent, or duly authorized agent, or through the naturalization of a parent having legal custody of such person: Provided, That nationality shall not be lost by any person under this section as the result of the naturalization of a parent or parents while such person is under the age of twenty-one years, or as the result of naturalization obtained on behalf of a person under twenty-one years of age by a parent, guardian, or duly authorized agent, unless such person shall fail to enter the United States to establish a permanent residence prior to his twenty-fifth birthday:</p></blockquote>
<p>Which not only adds two years to the window shows that Mr. Berg isn&#8217;t even citing the right statute.</p>
<p>People who wish can explore the questions of whether Obama&#8217;s step-father adopted him, whether or not he attended school under the name Barack Soetoro, or whether his identification card described him as &#8216;Indonesian&#8217;. Or further you could examine the claims that he travelled to Pakistan at age 20 under an Indonesian passport. Some of the evidence of these matters is pretty sketchy and the rest apparently non-existent but none of that matters. As a minor under the age of 21 it doesn&#8217;t appear that any act by Obama&#8217;s parents could have caused him to permanently lose his citizenship as long as he relocated in the United States by age 25.</p>
<p>Meaning a whole bunch of frothing happening as we speak over on the other side of the blogosphere is kind of a waste. The Acts of 1940 and 1952 effectively acted as reset buttons.</p>

<p>Reader Josh asks:</p>
<blockquote><p>I always find it interesting that those who scream for lower corporate taxes always claim that they are necessary for America to compete in the global economy. Is this not using tax policy to attempt to undercut other competing nations? Is the use of a tariff not the same thing? I know tariffs are the handiwork of satan, but how is undercutting other nations (ignoring the other negative aspects of underfunded government) any less inflammatory than slapping a tariff on their exports?</p></blockquote>

<p>A Very Good Question</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t even have to get past the headline and byline to read an <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-lazarus7-2008dec07,0,6958487,print.column">excellent question posed by David Lazarus in the LA Times</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Why were Wall Street workers not asked for concessions?</p></blockquote>
<p>He goes on:</p>
<blockquote><p>Say what you will about the role of the union in exacerbating Detroit&#8217;s financial troubles, one thing stands out: Blue-collar workers are taking it in the shorts as part of their employers&#8217; efforts to secure some bailout bucks from Uncle Sam.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t recall white-collar workers on Wall Street stepping up with similar concessions in return for their companies&#8217; receiving billions of dollars in taxpayer cash. </p>
<p>&#8220;There is absolutely no excuse for a bailout without significant sacrifices by all stakeholders,&#8221; said Robert Reich, who served as Labor secretary under President Clinton and is now a professor of public policy at UC Berkeley.</p>
<p>&#8220;We should be making everyone on Wall Street jump through hoops, not just the automakers.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>He notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Of course, jobs are being cut and bonuses lost throughout the financial world, but that&#8217;s more a response to the crisis than an offer from workers to help. </p></blockquote>
<p>And the question, one more time for good measure:</p>
<blockquote><p>So why are we holding blue-collar workers to a different standard than their white-collar kin? </p></blockquote>

<p>The Folks Running GM&#8230;  And the Folks Running the Country</p>
<p>Say you were a congresscritter or a President or a President-elect asked to give taxpayer money to GM.  You might, at the very least, want to know that the folks running GM know what they&#8217;re doing and are capable of putting out a desirable product.</p>
<p> If you thought that way, you might want to know who is on their board of directors.  You&#8217;d find that information <a href="http://www.gm.com/corporate/investor_information/docs/fin_data/gm07ar/content/corporate/board.html">here</a>.</p>
<p> So let&#8217;s see… there&#8217;s a retired chairman of AstraZeneca, a retired chairman and CEO of Kodak, a retired chairman and CEO of Ernst &#038; Young, the President of the University of North Carolina, the former head of the Pfizer foundation, the CEO and Chairwoman of Ceridian Corporation, the retired chairman and CEO of Sara Lee Corporation, the retired CEO and President of Compaq, the President and CEO of the Flagler Group, the Chairman Emeritus (no former chairman he!) of Northrop Grumman, the current CEO of GM, the Chancellor of the U of Georgia, and an Executive VP at Du Pont.  I can appreciate the benefits of bringing in some outside expertise, but in this case, the only one on this group who on paper knows anything about making cars is the current head of GM.  And given that he&#8217;s been running the company for ten years, I think we can safely conclude nobody on that board really has much of a clue how to build cars people might actually want to buy.</p>
<p> Fortunately for GM, the decision of what to do is mostly in the hands of people similar to those on its board of directors and/or <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/09/rant-about-attorneys.html">attorneys</a>. <br />__________________________________<br />by cactus</p>

<p>Bush as a Great Man &#8211; The New Meme</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s say, hypothetically, GW had had a cause these past eight years:  reducing auto accident fatalities.  Let&#8217;s say he also set forth a plan that greatly increased the amount of funding to the state highway agency.  But there was a catch &#8211; states only got the money if they pledged to use it primarily for public service campaigns designed to get across the message that unmarried people should not drive.  At the same time, having noted that in many crashes, people often got killed despite having on a seat belt and traveling in a car with airbags, officials in the administration leaned quite heavily on car makers to remove seat belts and airbags from vehicles.  </p>
<p>My guess is that right about now, the folks at the National Review would be hailing GW&#8217;s commitment to highway safety and berating the rest of us for failing to give him his due.  And they&#8217;d be pretty desperate about it, given his dearth of accomplishments, at least positive ones, and their own continued support for him over the past eight years.  So it wasn&#8217;t a surprise to read <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/print/?q=YzRiMDA3MWJlZTE3ODljNjk5OTE0NmMwYWM0ZDA3MDk=">this</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I have much sympathy for our 43rd president. I think a good, maybe even a great man has been vilified.</p></blockquote>
<p>Nor was it a surprise that one of the pieces of evidence cited for GW&#8217;s goodness, maybe even greatness, was this<strikethrough>ness</strikethrough>:</p>
<blockquote><p>funding for AIDS treatment in Africa on a scale that dwarfed Bill Clinton&#8217;s efforts</p></blockquote>
<p>Another article at the National Review <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=M2Q0MTM4YjdiOWNkNWEzMDgwNmE0MjhkYzBlNTcyOWM=">tells us</a></p>
<blockquote><p>George W. Bush who has devoted so much time, energy, and money (well, our money, but it was legal) to fighting AIDS and other diseases in Africa.</p></blockquote>
<p>It goes on:</p>
<blockquote><p>It goes without saying that if Obama does even half of what Bush has done for AIDS sufferers in Africa, he will be — in the eyes of those same people — a candidate for canonization. </p>
<p>Of course the Left can say whatever they like about George Bush and the war in Iraq and the war on terror. But when he does something completely in line with their own stated principles and values, it is simply mean-spirited of them to deny him his due.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now, I&#8217;ll be honest, I haven&#8217;t looked at numbers when it comes to AIDS in Africa.  I know its a heart-breaking and horrific problem, but each of us has only limited bandwidth.  Still, there&#8217;s one thing about AIDS in Africa I&#8217;m pretty sure of, even without looking at the numbers:  GW did not make things better.  </p>
<p>Even people who are desperate and shameless enough to try to explain that GW is a great man because of his efforts to fight AIDS in Africa can&#8217;t point to much in the way of improvements.  (Not a surprise given the counter-productive approach he&#8217;s taken.)   Heck, even Thomas Sowell, <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/01/in-my-opinion-thomas-sowell-is-hack.html">who seems to have a certain je ne se quois with numbers</a> doesn&#8217;t appear to have dipped his toe in that one.  </p>
<p>When it comes to AIDS in Africa, the best that can be said about GW&#8217;s legacy is this:  let&#8217;s hope our next President does better.<br />___________________________________________<br />by cactus</p>
