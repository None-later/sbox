<blockquote><p>Given the recent rhetoric in Republican circles about immigration policy, I found <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2007/06/14/MNG3DQF4U11.DTL">this story</a> spectacularly amusing.</p>
<blockquote><p>The California Republican Party has decided no American is qualified to take one of its most crucial positions — state deputy political director — and has hired a Canadian for the job through a coveted H-1B visa, a program favored by Silicon Valley tech firms that is under fire for displacing skilled American workers. </p>
<p>Christopher Matthews, 35, a Canadian citizen, has worked for the state GOP as a campaign consultant since 2004. But he recently was hired as full-time deputy political director, with responsibility for handling campaign operations and information technology for the country’s largest state Republican Party operation, California Republican Party Chairman Ron Nehring confirmed in a telephone interview this week. </p>
<p>In the nation’s most populous state — which has produced a roster of nationally known veteran political consultants — “it’s insulting but also embarrassing … to bring people from the outside who don’t know the difference between Lodi and Lancaster … and who can’t even vote,” said Karen Hanretty, a political commentator and former state GOP party spokeswoman.</p></blockquote>
<p>Wait, it gets funnier. Matthews was hired by Michael Kamburowski, the state GOP’s chief operations officer, who is … wait for it … an Australian citizen.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Edwards&#8217; plan would remove long-term patents for companies that develop breakthrough drugs and then reap large profits because of the monopolies those patents provide, according to a statement by Edwards obtained Wednesday evening.</p></blockquote>
<p>This article discusses other aspects of the Edwards health care proposals.  But something tells me that the economist blogs will focus on this aspect.  Ending monopolies may sound good but we will surely that fans of the patent system asking about the incentives to do research on new drugs.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p><a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB118178643572134789.html?mod=home_whats_news_us">Jeffrey McCracken</a> begins his piece entitled <em>Detroit Pursues Sweeping Cuts In Union Talks</em> with:</p>
<blockquote><p>Detroit&#8217;s Big Three, facing their worst crisis in decades, are seeking unprecedented concessions from the United Auto Workers union in a bid to narrow what they say is a $30-an-hour labor-cost disadvantage against Asian rivals like Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co., auto executives say.</p></blockquote>
<p>$30 an hour labor cost disadvantage sounds serious but then <a href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/beat_the_press_archive?month=06&#038;year=2007&#038;base_name=inflating_auto_worker_pay">Dean Baker</a> does some fact checking:</p>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s contract time for the United Auto Workers and the Wall Street Journal is working hard to build the case for big pay cuts. The paper tells us that compensation for UAW members is in the range of $70-$75 an hour.   Well that&#8217;s serious money. At that rate, with overtime, an autoworker can earn as much in a year as an incompetent CEO gets in a day. Clearly things are out of line.   Seriously, $70-$75 an hour is pretty good pay, but it is also not really what UAW members earn. The base pay for these workers is around $25 an hour. To get to $75 an hour, you would have to believe that autoworkers get $100,000 a year in benefits. Is that plausible?  Assume that they get $15k for their pension and $25k for their health insurance, that gets you to $40k. Where is the rest of the $100k? Well, what the auto industry does to get this figure is they average in their health care and pension costs for their retirees. These are real expenses for the industry, but they have nothing to do with the compensation received by current workers.  News reporting on the UAW contracts should clearly distinguish between the compensation received by current workers and the legacy costs from retired workers. UAW members are well-paid, but averaging in the legacy costs hugely exaggerates their earnings in the mind of readers.</p></blockquote>
<p>So if McCracken comes up with a $30 per hour differential by inflating UAW compensation by $30 an hour, doesn’t it sound like we have very similar wages to those Japanese auto workers?  If so, the woes of GM and Ford lie elsewhere.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Every time I post something stating that the surge is not working, someone disputes it. Apparently I&#8217;m <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/13/AR2007061302357.html">not the only one who has doubts</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Three months into the new U.S. military strategy that has sent tens of thousands of additional troops into Iraq, overall levels of violence in the country have not decreased, as attacks have shifted away from Baghdad and Anbar, where American forces are concentrated, only to rise in most other provinces, according to a Pentagon report released yesterday.</p>
<p>The report &#8212; the first comprehensive statistical overview of the new U.S. military strategy in Iraq &#8212; coincided with renewed fears of sectarian violence after the bombing yesterday of the same Shiite shrine north of Baghdad that was attacked in February 2006, unleashing a spiral of retaliatory bloodshed. Iraq&#8217;s government imposed an immediate curfew in Baghdad yesterday to prevent an outbreak of revenge killings.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Iraq&#8217;s government, for its part, has proven &#8220;uneven&#8221; in delivering on its commitments under the strategy, the report said, stating that public pledges by Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki have in many cases produced no concrete results.</p>
<p>Iraqi leaders have made &#8220;little progress&#8221; on the overarching political goals that the stepped-up security operations are intended to help advance, the report said, calling reconciliation between Shiite, Kurdish and Sunni factions &#8220;a serious unfulfilled objective.&#8221; Indeed, &#8220;some analysts see a growing fragmentation of Iraq,&#8221; it said, noting that 36 percent of Iraqis believe &#8220;the Iraqi people would be better off if the country were divided into three or more separate countries.&#8221;</p>
<p>The 46-page report, mandated quarterly by Congress, tempers the early optimism about the new strategy voiced by senior U.S. officials. Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates, for instance, in March described progress in Iraq as &#8220;so far, so good.&#8221; Instead, it depicts limited gains and setbacks and states that it is too soon to judge whether the new approach is working.</p></blockquote>
<p>So&#8230; the best they can tell us is&#8230; &#8220;so far, so good.&#8221; How good?</p>
<blockquote><p>Violence fell in Baghdad and Anbar province, where the bulk of the 28,700 more U.S. troops are located, but escalated elsewhere as insurgents and militias regroup in eastern and northern Iraq. In Anbar, attacks dropped by about a third, compared with the previous three months, as Sunni tribes have organized against entrenched fighters from al-Qaeda in Iraq, the report said.</p>
<p>Overall, however, violence &#8220;has increased in most provinces, particularly in the outlying areas of Baghdad province and Diyala and Ninewa provinces,&#8221; the report said. In Diyala&#8217;s restive capital of Baqubah, U.S. and Iraq forces &#8220;have been unable to diminish rising sectarian violence contributing to the volatile security situation,&#8221; it said.</p></blockquote>
<p>But its limited, right?</p>
<blockquote><p>It cited &#8220;significant evidence&#8221; of attacks on Sunni Arabs by the predominantly Shiite government security forces, which have contributed to the displacement of an estimated 2 million Iraqis from their homes.</p></blockquote>
<p>And on the Shia front&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Shiite militias, which have engaged in the widespread killing and sectarian removal of Sunni residents in Baghdad, now enjoy wide support in the capital, the report said. &#8220;In Baghdad, a majority of residents report that militias act in the best interests of the Iraqi people,&#8221; it said, while only 20 percent of respondents polled nationwide shared that view. Maliki&#8217;s promises to disarm militias have not produced a concrete plan, the report said.</p></blockquote>
<p>And since we&#8217;re an econ blog&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Iraq&#8217;s economic progress is also mixed, with some success in controlling inflation, while oil production remains stagnant and demand for electricity outstrips lagging supply.</p></blockquote>
<p>My guess&#8230; like everything else the Pentagon has given us since this mess started, it probably plays up the positives and downplays the negatives. In other words, my guess is that this is the best possible spin. And the best possible is still awful. </p>
<p>I used to say that if things were going as well as the cheerleaders told us, you&#8217;d see some of them taking their families to Iraq for vacation. Now things have deteriorated to the point where even that isn&#8217;t true. Since they won&#8217;t listen to anyone else, its time to send all the cheerleaders and architects &#8211; the GWs and the Rummies and Freddie Kagans and Bill Kristols over to Iraq, and not let them leave until they solve the problem they created. Maybe if they had some skin in the game&#8230;</p>

<p>53% of them think its Fred Thompson. Rudy Giuliani comes in second (29%) and Mitt Romney comes in third (14%), McCain in fourth (4%) and everyone else is at 0. </p>
<p>Now, I&#8217;ll admit, I&#8217;m not following either the Dem or the Rep race as closely as these people, but I just don&#8217;t see it at all. I don&#8217;t see Thompson winning it. I don&#8217;t see Rudy or McCain. My bet&#8230; Romney gets it.</p>
<p>Your thoughts?</p>

<p>Privacy and civil liberties advocates say the list is growing uncontrollably, threatening its usefulness in the war on terror.</p>
<p>The bureau says the number of names on its terrorist watch list is classified. </p>
<p>A portion of the FBI&#8217;s unclassified 2008 budget request posted to the Department of Justice Web site, however, refers to &#8220;the entire watch list of 509,000 names,&#8221; which is utilized by its Foreign Terrorist Tracking Task Force.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the interagency National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC), which maintains the government&#8217;s list of all suspected terrorists with links to international organizations, said they had 465,000 names covering 350,000 individuals. Many names are different versions of the same identity &#8212; &#8220;Usama bin Laden&#8221; and &#8220;Osama bin Laden&#8221; for the al Qaeda chief, for example.</p></blockquote>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>This post looks at tax cuts by Presidential administration. Cutting taxes is one of the key stated platforms of the Republican Party, along with smaller government, faster economic growth, fiscal responsibility, and some social issues such as reducing the number of abortions, cutting the rate of unwed motherhood, maintaining a healthy dislike of homosexuals, and as of late, apparently teaching, um, &#8220;the controversy&#8221; over the Theory of Evolution. </p>
<p>Of course, words and deeds don&#8217;t always go hand in hand. Here at Angry Bear, we&#8217;ve shown that the Republicans do not produce smaller government (by most measures even St. Ronald can&#8217;t best Bill Clinton), they produced slower economic growth by any number of measures regardless of how one massages the data, they certainly have not been the party of lower debt, or fewer abortions, or less unwed motherhood. </p>
<p>I guess I can make a snide remark at this point about hoping that when I eventually find some data, I can at least show the Republicans are sincere about homophobia and ignorance, but I just don&#8217;t have it in me. I will state, even before we start, that cutting taxes is indeed something at which Republican administrations excel.</p>
<p>The approach I took was as follows. I looked at the sum of individual and corporate income taxes, plus excise taxes and other taxes; basically, everything except social security taxes from <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2008/sheets/hist02z1.xls">OMB Table 2.1</a>. Following Milton Friedman&#8217;s admonition that any debt must eventually be repaid, I then subtracted added the change in the national debt from the previous year &#8211; that data came from <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2008/sheets/hist07z1.xls">OMB Table 7.1</a>. </p>
<p>I then looked at this data&#8230; all non-social security taxes plus the change in national obligation two ways. In one case, I looked at it as a share of GDP. In the second case, I adjusted it for inflation (using the <a href="ftp://ftp.bls.gov/pub/special.requests/cpi/cpiai.txt">CPI</a>, and divided through by the population, obtained from the BEA&#8217;s <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/Index.asp">NIPA Table 7.1</a>. When selecting CPI and population, I took into account the fact that the end of the fiscal year changed from the second quarter of the calendar year to the third quarter of the calendar year in 1976.</p>
<p>OK. I think that&#8217;s enough blah blah blah. Here&#8217;s a picture of non-SS taxes plus changes in debt obligation as a percentage of GDP.</p>

<p>A few comments/observations. No doubt you&#8217;ll have some of your own.<br />1. Dems are at the bottom of each table. Even JFK/LBJ. But for them, growth in the first series was negative, and in the second it was positive&#8230; in other words&#8230; they did cut taxes, and it raised a lot more money afterwards&#8230;. basically, the Laffer curve and a situation where the taxes were too high to start with.<br />2. Following up the Laffer curve&#8230; check out the pattern after JFK/LBJ, especially beginning with Reagan. It seems pretty clear that cutting the tax rate (as a percentage of income) leads to less real taxes being collected, and raising tax rates leads to more real taxes being collected&#8230; after JFK/LBJ had their tax cuts, we&#8217;ve been on the left side of the Laffer curve. Gee&#8230; where have I read that before? Oh yeah&#8230; both PGL and I have had posts about that right here at Angry Bear.<br />3. Yes, GHW raised some tax rates, but he cut others. And there are many ways to cut taxes&#8230; cut enforcement for one thing. <br />4. Gingrich&#8217;s Republican revolution seems to have allowed Clinton to up tax rates&#8230;<br />5. St. Ronald the Reagan was not the big tax cutter that Republicans believe he was. As a percentage of GDP, he came in third, after GW and Nixon/Ford. In terms of revenues collected, he came in 5th, and GHW came in third. My guess&#8230; St. Ronnie&#8217;s spending habits&#8230; Why hasn&#8217;t GW, who has similar spending habits suffered as much? I think it may have something to do with interest on the debt&#8230; St. Ronnie had to borrow at a much higher rate of interest. Alan Greenspan literally bent over backward for GW.</p>
<p>For grins, and I do mean grins, I did a means test on the two series. (I only looked at it by administration.) For the test, H0: mean of growth rate in taxes for Dems = mean of growth rate in taxes for Reps</p>
<p>Table 1a for the first series&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RnCbv5umkJI/AAAAAAAAAQo/hvyyt_M1TbI/s1600-h/Taxes,+Table+1a.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RnCbv5umkJI/AAAAAAAAAQo/hvyyt_M1TbI/s320/Taxes,+Table+1a.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Table 2a for the second series&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RnCbopumkII/AAAAAAAAAQg/P-PCIAWrVxA/s1600-h/Taxes,+Table+2a.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/RnCbopumkII/AAAAAAAAAQg/P-PCIAWrVxA/s320/Taxes,+Table+2a.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Conclusion of the tests&#8230; we should reject the hypothesis that Dems and Reps have similar policies on taxes with a probability of just under 95% and a probability of just under 98%, respectively. (I don&#8217;t expect most of the folks who objected to slightly stronger results showing that Dems and Reps produce different real economic growth rates to object to the results of this test.) </p>
<p>Conclusion of the post&#8230; after much searching, we finally stumble on a series where Republican Presidents perform as advertised. They cut taxes. I wonder if that&#8217;s enough, in the minds of most Republicans. I imagine for some it is. But ask yourself&#8230; if you could get lower taxes at the cost of lower growth rates in real GDP per capita and median income and the like, would you do it? What does your answer, yes or no, say about you?</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>The surge in Iraq has sputtered.  (Regular readers may recall I predicted it would do so before it began.)  Things seem to have hit the fan over there and nobody is pretending otherwise any more.  Of course, its still the fault of the naysayers &#8211; somehow, if we only clapped harder, things would be alright.  Ah well.</p>
<p>So I decided to revisit GW&#8217;s <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/infocus/iraq/iraq_strategy_nov2005.html">National Strategy for Victory in Iraq</a> from back in November of 2005 to see where we should be at this point&#8230;</p>
<p>First, a note&#8230; the document is chock full of quotes by GW.  Apparently he was viewed as some sort of seer or something.  For instance, there&#8217;s this from June 2003:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our mission in Iraq is clear. We&#8217;re hunting down the terrorists. We&#8217;re helping Iraqis build a free nation that is an ally in the war on terror. We&#8217;re advancing freedom in the broader Middle East. We are removing a source of violence and instability, and laying the foundation of peace for our children and grandchildren.</p></blockquote>
<p>And here&#8217;s the key part&#8230; how success is defined&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>As the central front in the global war on terror, success in Iraq is an essential element in the long war against the ideology that breeds international terrorism. Unlike past wars, however, victory in Iraq will not come in the form of an enemy&#8217;s surrender, or be signaled by a single particular event &#8212; there will be no Battleship Missouri, no Appomattox. The ultimate victory will be achieved in stages </p></blockquote>
<p>It then goes on to give some short, medium, and long term signs of progress.  Here&#8217;s the short term list:</p>
<blockquote><p>An Iraq that is making steady progress in fighting terrorists and neutralizing the insurgency, meeting political milestones; building democratic institutions; standing up robust security forces to gather intelligence, destroy terrorist networks, and maintain security; and tackling key economic reforms to lay the foundation for a sound economy.</p></blockquote>
<p>I guess the only question one can ask is &#8211; what the heck comes before the short term?</p>
<p>Among the consequences of failure is this:</p>
<blockquote><p>A failed state and source of instability for the entire Middle East, with all the attendant risks and incalculable costs for American security and prosperity.</p></blockquote>
<p>Can anyone say that hasn&#8217;t happened already?</p>
<p>The report does state:<br />
<blockquote>Iraq is likely to struggle with some level of violence for many years to come.</p></blockquote>
<p>  I wonder if this is the &#8220;some level&#8221; they had in mind when they wrote this nonsense.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.joinrudy2008.com/news/pr/286/index.php">Rudy</a> pledges the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>1. I will keep America on offense in the Terrorists’ War on Us.<br />2. I will end illegal immigration, secure our borders, and identify every non-citizen in our nation.<br />3. I will restore fiscal discipline and cut wasteful Washington spending.<br />4. I will cut taxes and reform the tax code.<br />5. I will impose accountability on Washington.<br />6. I will lead America towards energy independence.<br />7. I will give Americans more control over, and access to, healthcare with affordable and portable free-market solutions.<br />8. I will increase adoptions, decrease abortions, and protect the quality of life for our children.<br />9. I will reform the legal system and appoint strict constructionist judges.<br />10. I will ensure that every community in America is prepared for terrorist attacks and natural disasters.<br />11. I will provide access to a quality education to every child in America by giving real school choice to parents.<br />12. I will expand America’s involvement in the global economy and strengthen our reputation around the world.</p></blockquote>
<p>Conservative <a href="http://www.outsidethebeltway.com/archives/2007/06/rudy_giulianis_12_commitments_">James Joyner</a> has his doubts over each one – especially #12:</p>
<blockquote><p>How could we be more involved in the global economy? And how are you going to do this while shutting down our borders, chasing illegal aliens, and stopping the import of energy from abroad.</p></blockquote>
<p>To explain, let’s go back to #2:</p>
<blockquote><p>No, you won’t. And, frankly, I wouldn’t want to give you (or anyone else) enough power to “identify every non-citizen in our nation.” There are over 300 million people living here, stretched across a continental landmass. How on earth would you do that?</p></blockquote>
<p>Excellent!  I heard Rudy talking about #1 where he claimed we Democrats were for reducing our commitment to fighting the war on terrorism.  Way to go Rudy – just flat out lie to the American people!</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: I want to be fair and balanced so I should say something nice about Mitt Romney as well.  <a href="http://www.tpmcafe.com/blog/electioncentral/2007/jun/12/quote_of_the_day">Eric Kleefeld</a> notes Barney Franks has done this for me:</p>
<blockquote><p>The real Romney is clearly an extraordinarily ambitious man with no perceivable political principle whatsover. He is the most intellectually dishonest human being in the history of politics.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Update II</strong>: <a href="http://www.tpmcafe.com/blog/electioncentral/2007/jun/12/rudy_raising_money_off_lists_of_jewish_newspaper_readers">Greg Sargent</a> has some details on Rudy’s dishonest Dem bashing.</p>
<p><strong>Update III</strong>: AB reader Divorced one like Bush reminds us of the <a href="http://www.house.gov/house/Contract/CONTRACT.html">Contract On America</a>.  Compare Rudy’s commitments #3 and #4 to “the fiscal responsibility act”.  When a Republican says he can balance the budget and cut taxes simply by reducing “waste Washington spending”, that Republican has told a big flat lie.  Way to go Rudy!</p>

                                <p>CoRev posted <a href="http://pcrevolt.blogspot.com/2007/06/msm-at-its-best.html">this</a> at his blog and asked if it could be posted here too.  I&#8217;ll do it, but only because I have some comments at the end.</p>

<p>In the military there are shaped charges to maximize damage.  In the <br />Main Stream Media there are shaped articles to create the same results.  <br />Here&#8217;s the lede:<br />
<blockquote>Army Sees First Big Slip In Recruiting in <br />2 Years</p></blockquote>
<p> Big Slip?</p>
<p>Inside the article we find this:<br />
<blockquote>The Army fell short of its <br />recruiting goal for May, its first significant slip in two<br />years.</p></blockquote>
<p> Not only the first ?significant? slip in two years <br />we find that the other services met or exceeded their goal for the <br />month, (and the past two years?).  And what was that HUGE deficit? <br />
<blockquote>The Army signed up 5,101 recruits. That was short of its goal of <br />5,500,&#8230; </p></blockquote>
<p>  for those math challenged among us that is 399 <br />less than projected.  399 is &#8220;Big&#8221; or &#8220;significant&#8221;?  </p>
<p>I think not when we find this in the very same article.<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;May <br />is historically a difficult month to recruit,&#8221; said Maj. Anne Edgecomb, <br />an Army spokeswoman, citing high school graduation and other spring <br />events that tend to make it harder to attract recruits&#8230;.</p>
<p>The Marine Corps had a banner month in May, signing up 2,225 recruits, <br />many more than its goal of 1,665. The Navy hit exactly its target of <br />2,709, and the Air Force met its goal of 2,451.</p></blockquote>
<p>I think the Guard Units are still having some trouble recruiting.  the <br />article provided this piece of information that confirms that thought. <br />
<blockquote>The Army National Guard met 88 percent of its goal and the <br />Air National Guard met 77 percent of its goal.</p></blockquote>
<p>  All of <br />this from the WaPo <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/11/AR2007061102170.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>The problem with CoRev&#8217;s post is that he&#8217;s looking only at this year.   <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2133908/nav/tap1/">Standards have already dropped.</a>  I don&#8217;t have time to go look at a .mil site right now, but I think CoRev is ignoring a few details about military recruiting, namely that the military is ignoring a few details about a number of its recruits these days.</p>
