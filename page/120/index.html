                                <p>As far as I <strike>can</strike> could tell, Simon Wren-Lewis has been convinced by Paul Krugman.  He <a href="http://mainlymacro.blogspot.it/2012/04/microfoundations-and-evidence-1-street.html">now proposes </a>parallel reasearch projects one of which is to be focused on fitting the data.  This is exactly what Krugman advocated.</p>
<p>Update: clearly I couldn&#8217;t tell very far.  In fact, as he has repeatedly written, Wren-Lewis always agreed with Krugman about what is to be done.  I assume he still disagrees with Krugman about the fruits of the effort to micro found macro.  In any case, I missinterpreted his new parallel research program proposal.  It is the same as his original paralkel research program proposal.</p>
<p>Also he isn&#8217;t the one who caused the Bank of England model to have an ad hoc periphery around the consistent core.  That was the work of Bank of England employees.  Or something.  Just go to <a href="http://mainlymacro.blogspot.it/2012/04/some-notes-on-macro-modelling.html">his blog</a> for more reliably correct corrections.</p>
<blockquote><p>In the real world the incentive for most academics is to get publications, often within a limited time frame. When the focus of macroeconomic analysis is on internal consistency rather than external consistency, then it is unclear whether this incentive mechanism is socially optimal. If it is not, then one solution is for all macroeconomists to work for central banks! A more realistic alternative might be to reprise within academic macroeconomics a modelling tradition which placed more emphasis on external consistency and less on internal consistency, to work alongside the microfoundations approach.</p></blockquote>

<p>My reading is that Wren Lewis has ceased to present the empirical research as subordinate to micro founded modeling.  He seems to accept a research project which developes on its own and not just as an indication for what should be added to consistent models including agents with rational expectations.  Wren-Lewis seems to have only a verbal quibble with Krugman who says the fashion was for models which are beautiful not true.  Wren Lewis notes that many of the models are ugly.  I&#8217;d consider the debate resolved essentially with Wren Lewis saying he is convinced.  I note that he started arguing for some role for non-micro founded models.  My guess is that, when the debate started, he thought what he wrote this time, but was trying to appeal to the profession which considers the micro founded models to be the only research of scientific value.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t let go of the debate however.  In the post to which I link above, Wren Lewis links to <a href="http://mainlymacro.blogspot.co.uk/2012/03/microfoundations-and-central-bank.html">another post</a> in which he explains how he really modelled when advising the Bank of England. It turns out that he didn&#8217;t stick to micro founded models at all.  There was a &#8220;core model&#8221; which is logically consistent and features rational agents.  But the output of this model is just one input to ad hoc models used for actual forecasting.  </p>
<blockquote><p>If we take a microfounded model to the data, what we invariably find is that the errors for any particular aggregate relationship are not just serially correlated (if the equation overpredicts today, we know something about the error it will make tomorrow) but also systematically related to model variables. If the central bank ignores this, it will be throwing away important and useful information. Take forecasting. If I know, say, that the errors in a microfounded model’s equation for consumption are systematically related to unemployment, then the central bank could use this knowledge to better predict future consumption.<br />BEQM addressed this problem by splitting the model into two: a microfounded ‘core‘, and an ad-hoc ‘periphery’. The periphery equation for consumption would have the microfounded model’s prediction for consumption on the right hand side, but other variables like unemployment (and lags) could be added to get the best fit with the data. However this periphery equation for consumption would not feed back into the microfounded core. The microfounded core was entirely self-contained: to use a bit of jargon, the periphery was entirely recursive to the core.</p></blockquote>
<p>The hybrid model is not logically consistent (wealth evolves as if consumption were determined by the core model, but forecast consumption is different so budget constraints are not satisfied with equality in the hybrid model).</p>
<p>The interesting thing to me is that the example of core plus ad hoc was the model used to forecast consumption.  Some time ago when I challenged Wren Lewis to present a case in which micro founded models were useful in forecasting, he brought up consumption and noted that an old Keynesian model used by the Bank of England forecast lower than observed consumption.  Now he notes that the model which is currently used by the Bank of England for that very variable is an ad hoc internally inconsistent model.  This was the example he chose when defending micro founded models.  </p>
<p>Now he notes that the micro founded model might in the future be improved so that it gives useful forecasts (he mentions precautionary savings) but &#8220;might&#8221; makes right.  Such a claim can be made for any resarch program no matter how sterile. </p>
<p>I comment with my usual rudeness.  Just to be quick, the example shows that the Bank of England does not, in fact, use a micro founded model.  The model is written down, but it is over ridden when making forecasts.  In my comment I ask if there is any hint of any useful role of the &#8220;core model&#8221;.</p>
<p>I note that you provide neither evidence nor reasoning in support of the claim that Microfounded model building is a very important and useful thing to do.&#8221;. Notably the core-periphery hybrid model is vulnerable to the Lucas crtique. What does the core model add which is useful ? Having a model which is not confronted with the data written down adds what exactly ? Does the core-periphery model fit the data better than a model which is not based on adding inconsistent equations to a logically consistent core ?</p>
<p>You note someone&#8217;s (King&#8217;s I assume) determination to include a logically consistent core ( then add inconsistent equations before making predictions or guiding policy. As presented, this seems to be a matter of intellectual fashion. Evidence doesn&#8217;t appear in that stage of your story (as it does in the stage of adding ad hoc corrections to thecore model).</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know where to put this, but Mankiw&#8217;s use of the word &#8221; scientists&#8221; has no connection with practice in the natural sciences in which, historically, theories bow to facts. Can he explain why he did&#8217;t write &#8220;mathematicians&#8221; ?</p>
<p>Finally, what basis is there for the claim that the &#8220;better journals&#8221; are better than other journals ? They are presented as journals publishing social science, but empirical success is not required. You note correctly that they have huge status in the field, but do not address the question of whether this has anything to do with science, reality, understanding, insight or intellectual progress.</p>
<p>Oh I am getting rude as usual. So, before hitting publish, I want to thank you on behalf of at least UK residents for not sticking with an elegant model which does not fit the data. As I understand this post you et al rendered a false but fashionable model harmless. This made the UK a better place and I applaud your intellectual courage.</p>

<p><strong>DAMNED LIARS</strong></p>
<p><strong>AND SOCIAL SECURITY</strong></p>
<p>There are liars, damned liars, and “non partisan experts.” The non partisan experts are expert liars, “non partisan” because that’s the best lie of all. A damned liar need not be an expert, but he is usually pretty clever at mixing “true” facts, or at least “facts you can’t prove are not true,” with false implications that lead the people he wants to deceive into hurting themselves with false conclusions. Those false conclusions are ideally tied to other ideas that the mark really, really wants to believe, so he is never really able to let go of the lie he has been taught.</p>
<p>Robert J. Samuelson is not an expert, but he gets all his “facts” from them pre-twisted and designed to mislead. He published a pretty good example of the art of deception on Easter Sunday in the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/wouldroosevelt-recognize-todays-social-security/2012/04/08/gIQALChd4S_story.html" target="_blank">Washington Post</a>.</p>
<p>Good enough, in fact, that when I started to deconstruct the lies for this post, I soon saw that I was in for a long job.. one too long to expect readers to put up with. So I will have to content myself, and you, dear reader, with “pointing at” the truth and leave you to decide for yourself how far you want to go to understand it for yourself.</p>
<p>Samuelson begins by claiming that FDR would not approve of Social Security today because it has become &#8220;the dole&#8221; that Roosevelt tried to avoid. His argument is entirely fallacious. And, as it turns out, he is telling these lies in order to encourage us to change Social Security so that it BECOMES the dole. One can&#8217;t be sure that Samuelson recognizes this himself. A career of telling lies for money must do terrible things to a man&#8217;s brain.</p>
<p>Samuelson is very confused&#8230; or wants you to be confused&#8230; about the differences between &#8220;pay as you go&#8221; and “the dole” and &#8220;contributory&#8221; pension plans. </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>He gets the history of the development of the Social Security idea exactly backwards. For a clearer understanding of that history I recommend &#8220;The Battle to Save Social Security,&#8221; by Nancy Altman.</p>
<p>But rather than get lost in the mazes of Samuelson&#8217;s mind, I will attempt to describe the development of &#8220;pay as you go,&#8221; not as a &#8220;plan&#8221; but as a fact on the ground. Let us begin by examining one of Samuelson&#8217;s lies&#8230; a very familiar one:</p>
<p>But now, demographics are unfriendly. In 1960, there were five workers per recipient; today, there are three, and by 2025 the ratio will approach two. Roosevelt’s fear has materialized. Paying all benefits requires higher taxes, cuts in other programs or large deficits.<br />This is intended to deceive. The ratio of workers to retirees will not cause large deficits or cuts in other programs, or higher taxes. The reason the ratio has changed over the years is mostly due to the arithmetic of phasing in a pay as you go plan.</p>
<p>Suppose there is a great nation in which workers have been working and saving for their future retirement by putting some of their earnings into bank accounts or into stocks and bonds. Then suppose that a great catastrophe comes to that nation and wipes out the savings. The older workers have lost the most..they had the most savings to lose. But even younger workers can now understand that their own future savings will be at risk of being lost just as the older workers have lost theirs. <br />The workers come up with a way to &#8220;insure&#8221; their savings. They agree to join a retirement insurance pool with a &#8220;pay as you go&#8221; financing plan. Every worker will contribute a small part of his weekly pay to a fund that will pay for the &#8220;benefits&#8221; of those who retire.</p>
<p>Suppose there are forty million workers. A million aged 64, a million aged 63, and so on down to a million aged 26 and a million aged 25. The first year there are forty million workers and zero retirees. The ratio of workers to retirees is 40 to zero. The next year the million 64 year olds turn 65 and retire. The 25 year olds turn 26&#8230; and a million new workers turn 25 and begin paying the “tax.” Now there are forty million workers and one million retirees. The ratio of workers to retirees is now 40 to 1. The next year another million workers will retire, and a million new workers will come in at age 25. Now there will be forty million workers and two million retirees.. the ratio of workers to retirees is now 40 to 2. And so on. But not forever. Because eventually some of the retirees will die, and eventually the number of retirees who die will be equal to the number of people who retire each year, so the ratio of workers to retirees will stabilize according to the life expectancy of retirees. If that life expectancy is about 12 years, the ratio of workers to retirees will stabilize at about 3 to 1. Note here that the ratio of workers to retirees is the same as the ratio of working years to retirement years for each worker (on average).</p>
<p>The workers designing our retirement insurance plan know this. They know that the early retirees will collect more in benefits than they paid in. But they decide that this is fair; in fact it is exactly what is needed: Those who will retire soon are those who have lost the most savings in the recent disaster, and have the least time to recover by saving up enough under a &#8220;contributory&#8221; financing plan. The workers also know that those older workers contributed to the previous system: a combination of welfare and old fashioned “honor your father and your mother” care of their own parents. The workers also know the older workers cared for them when they were younger and built the infrastructure by which they are able to make money at all. They “paid for” their retirement, even though the money did not go into the current plan. The workers understand that by ‘grandfathering in” the older workers they are merely doing the fair and honorable thing of providing a transition from the previous, failed, plan to the new, better, plan.</p>
<p>The workers also know that the younger workers will not be hurt by “paying for” the older workers. The younger workers will eventually pay the full cost of their own retirement. They will not have to pay “more” because part of that money was used to pay for those who went before them. This is one of the beauties of “pay as you go” : As long as new workers will need the same insurance, they will join the pool and their contributions will pay directly for the retirement of the older workers. But the new workers won’t lose anything by that because their own retirement will be paid for by the newer workers coming into the system.</p>
<p>This is not a Ponzi scheme. The workers ALL get what they are paying for, and they will keep coming into the system as long as they need a way to insure their own retirement.<br />The current ratio is near 3 to 1 and is expected to go to near 2 to 1. But this is not a catastrophe. The current payroll tax is about 6%. If 3 workers paying 6% of their pay can &#8220;support&#8221; one retiree. Two workers would need to pay about 9% of their pay to support one retiree. Or, and this is a better way to think of it, each worker would need to pay 6% to pay for a life expectancy of 12 years. If he expects to live 20 years, he will need to pay about 9%. This may look expensive to you until you realize it is exactly the amount of money you would need to save for twenty years of retirement whether there was Social Security or not. While it’s true you “might” do better on the stock market, it is also true you might do a whole lot worse. And having less than you need is much, much more painful than having more than you need is pleasurable.</p>
<p>The numbers are actually a little better than this, and it will take a long time to reach that 2:1 ratio, if ever. And if you read the Trustees Report&#8230; if you read it very carefully&#8230; it shows that under their predictions&#8230; including the increase in life expectancy and the reduced ratio of workers to retirees&#8230;the payroll tax would only have to be raised to just over 8% for the worker. <br />Moreover the need for the raise will be so gradual that it can be met by raising the tax an average of one half of one tenth of one percent per year while wages are going up over a full percent per year. This means that a tax increase of about forty cents per week each year, while wages are going up about eight dollars per week each year, would enable workers to continue to pay for their own retirement, as they always have, and would have TWICE AS MUCH MONEY in their pockets AFTER paying for their longer retirement as they have today.</p>
<p>This preserves the INSURANCE nature of Social Security. It will add NOTHING to &#8220;the deficit,&#8221; and it means YOU will get to collect YOUR money when the time comes without welfare &#8220;means testing.” having to beg the rich man to pay for it, benefit cuts, or increase in the retirement age&#8230;which you will not like, whatever you think while you are young.</p>
<p>If you read the Samuelson editorial, it is important to keep in mind that what Samuelson means by “contributory” is you “invest” in stocks and hope for the best while you build up your savings&#8230; exactly the plan that failed and led to the need for Social Security in the first place. There is nothing wrong with investing, but Social Security provides you with insurance “in case” you don’t do as well as you hoped. As the ad says, “priceless.”</p>
<p>You also need to keep in mind that Social Security contributes NOTHING to the deficit. It is NOT welfare. It is paid for entirely by the workers who will get the benefits. Social Security has NOTHING to do with “why America’s budget problems are so intractable.” That problem is caused by deficit spending to pay for arms buildups, actual wars, and recessions caused by the big money gambling schemes&#8230; that Samuelson’s friends want you to play with them.</p>
<p>Samuelson seems confused about “pay as you go.” He does not understand money at all. He thinks that if “your money” is used to pay the benefits of someone already retired that you have “lost” your money. But this is no more true than you have lost your money because when you put it in the bank, the bank gives it to someone else to use while waiting for you to ask for it back.<br />Samuelson cites Sylvester Schieber. I have not read Schieber’s new book. But his “The Real Deal” was a collection of clever lies. Schieber qualifies as a “non partisan expert.”</p>
<p>Samuelson says “Americans believe (falsely) that their payroll taxes have been segregated to pay for their benefits&#8230;” This is a lie. There is nothing false about the segregation. It is the law. Your payroll taxes pay for your benefits. No other taxes pay for your benefits, and your taxes cannot be used for any other reason. They do not contribute to “the deficit” in any way.</p>
<p>Samuelson seems to think that the fact that you receive more in benefits than you paid for&#8230; “even assuming (again, fictitiously) that they had been invested” is an argument AGAINST Social Security. It looks to me like an argument FOR it. You get more in benefits than you paid in, because the benefits are paid for out of taxes on incomes that increase over time, even when the tax rate does not. This IS an investment. It is an investment in the growth of a “corporation” called The United States of America.</p>
<p>Samuelson is conflating Social Security with Medicare. The growth in medical costs predicted over the next century will require that the Medicare tax be increased, or that medical costs be brought down. But cutting Medicare will not lower medical costs, and it’s a pretty stupid idea to cut your insurance because you expect your medical costs to increase.</p>
<p>Finally, Samuelson, after saying that Roosevelt would hate Social Security today because it is “the dole,” a statement that is a lie, calls for us to ask “who among the elderly need benefits?” because he thinks we need to turn Social Security into a needs based welfare program&#8230; the “dole.”<br />As I said, when a man chooses to tell lies for a living, it must do terrible things to his brain.<br />Social Security is an “entitlement” because YOU HAVE PAID FOR IT. Don’t let the liars confuse you. It does not need to be “fixed.” All of the “fixes” on the table are stealth plans to destroy it. They want your money for their gambling games, and they hate the idea of workers having the security to EVER be able to say, “I have enough. Now I want to retire and do something with my remaining years better than working for the boss.”</p>

                                <div>“I’ve never seen a less optimistic time in my lifetime in this country and people wonder why,” the first-term Republican governor said at the Bush Institute Conference on Taxes and Economic Growth in New York City.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>“I think it’s really simple. It’s because government’s now telling them ‘stop dreaming, stop striving, we’ll take care of you.’ We’re turning into a paternalistic entitlement society,” he said.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>“That will not just bankrupt us financially, it will bankrupt us morally because when the American people no longer believe that this a place where only their willingness to work hard … determines their success in life then we’ll have a bunch of people sittin’ on a couch waiting for their next government check,” Christie said.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>&#8212; &#8220;<a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0412/74987.html">Christie: Nation of couch potatoes</a>,” Politico
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>That, pretty clearly, is the message that the Republicans, party-wide, have settled on for this election: People are depressed because of the existence of the social safety net and other government programs such as student-loan and job-retraining programs, and because the very wealthy haven’t had their tax rates cut enough, the gap between the very wealthy, and all those couch potatoes who work regular jobs isn’t large enough.  
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>I wish them all the best with that message.  And I hope they keep pushing it, all the way to November. </p>
<p>I think it’s simple, too. I&#8217;ll leave it at that.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Can’t wait to hear the <i>next</i> installment of Christie’s VP audition script.  Maybe something about all those auto-industry-worker couch potatoes who’ve stopped dreaming and striving now that Obama has handed GM and Chrysler to the UAW?
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>By the way, did Christie ever use the student-loan program, I wonder?  Or did he, like Romney and Romney’s kids, have no need for it?
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>Christie was speaking at the Bush Institute Conference on Taxes and Economic Growth. Tomorrow’s audition will be by Paul Ryan. It’s a follow-up audition, actually.</p>
<p>&#8212;-
</p>
</div>
<div>Apparently, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/05/nyregion/christie-gives-new-jersey-firms-tax-breaks-for-short-moves.html?pagewanted=all">not <i>all</i> government programs</a> cause mental depression.

                                <p>by <a href="http://presimetrics.com/">Mike Kimel</a></p>
<p>From <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/08/magazine/whats-the-easiest-way-to-cheat-on-your-taxes.html?_r=1&#038;ref=todayspaper&#038;pagewanted=all"> an article in the NY Times</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p> Politicians sometimes say that lower tax rates lead to higher economic growth, which in turn leads to higher overall tax revenue. This may have been true in the early 1960s, when the top tax rate was 91 percent, but the top tax rate today is 35 percent. For decades, lower tax rates have led to lower government revenues, says Alan Viard, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative policy group. &#8220;The Reagan tax cuts, on the whole, reduced revenue,&#8221; he explains. &#8220;The Bush tax cuts clearly reduced revenue. There is no dispute among economists about that.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I guess we can credit Viard with actually looking at data on taxes and revenues, and having at least enough honesty not to obfuscate results.</p>
<p>Sadly, there is a dispute among the folks who call themselves economists about that, and it seems particularly easy to find that category of economists among the type of folks who are willing to associate themselves with the American Enterprise Institute.  </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s <a href="http://aei.org/article/economics/fiscal-policy/taxes/laffer-curve-pays-billions-if-obama-just-asks/">Kevin &#8220;Dow 36,000&#8221; Hassett</a> of the AEI, not incidentally co-author of Viard with a paper currently highlighted on the AEI&#8217;s website:</p>
<blockquote><p>Republicans have asserted for years that just about all tax cuts pay for themselves. They&#8217;ve almost always been wrong about that. But with regard to corporate taxes, it&#8217;s true.</p></blockquote>
<p>As Hassett notes in his piece, the top US corporate rate in 2010 was 35 percent.  Note the Viard quote shown earlier.</p>
<p>Then there&#8217;s AEI visiting scholar R. Glenn Hubbard, previously the first Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers under GW Bush, and as we all remember, a huge advocate of tax cuts all around.  I found this old <a href="http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/movable_type/archives/001351.html">Brad DeLong post</a> from Hubbard&#8217;s White House days.  DeLong quoted, in its entirety, this letter by Hubbard that was printed in the Washington Post.</p>
<blockquote><p>Washington Post <br />Low Taxes and Growth for All <br />January 4, 2003; Page A15 </p>
<p>A Dec. 16 news story in your paper stating that a Republican economist does not care about the deficit and wants to raise the tax burden on the poor was too good for Michael Kinsley to check [&#8220;Republicans Go Positive on the Deficit,&#8221; op-ed, Dec. 23]. Had he checked the complete text of my Dec. 10 speech, it would have been clear that I believe the fiscal position does matter and that a pro-growth policy with lower taxes for everybody makes sense.</p>
<p>The president is committed to fiscal discipline, and he rightly believes it is important to balance the budget. The deficit we now face is caused by national emergency, war and recession. We must keep in mind that growth leads to surpluses, not vice versa. Promoting economic growth and job creation is the aim of the administration&#8211;and this will lead back to a balanced budget. At the same time, the peer-reviewed economics literature shows that long-term interest rates do not go up in lockstop with the budget deficit. This is apparent from recent history.</p>
<p>The Dec. 16 article and Kinsley suggest that by acknowledging the challenges inherent in fundamental tax reform, the administration favors increasing taxes for some individuals. But the record makes clear this is not the case: The president and this administration know that lowering taxes for everybody leads to growth. This continues to be the sound policy of the administration.</p>
<p>&#8212; R. Glenn Hubband, Chairman, Council of Economic Advisers</p></blockquote>
<p>Notice&#8230;  he talks about &#8220;fiscal discipline&#8221;  but he is very clear, &#8220;growth leads to surpluses.&#8221;  Fiscal discipline is important, but it isn&#8217;t what leads to surpluses.  The only way that is true is if the faster growth generated by tax cuts leads to increased tax collections.</p>
<p>Note that this was 2003&#8230; and Hubbard and his boss had already given us tax cuts in 2001 and 2002. </p>
<p>Anyway, I can go on, but it seems to me Viard&#8217;s comment is merely part of a concerted effort to scrub a large history of very, very bad economic forecasts down the memory hole.  Sorry, but unless and until Viard calls out some his big name colleagues by name, it is going to be just as hard to take him seriously as it is to pretend that folks like Hubbard and Hassett don&#8217;t have a long history of promoting very damaging policies, and doubling down when those policies blew up.</p>

                                <p>I see that his blog Mankiw shows a chart of the employment population ratio to make a comment about the &#8220;so called recovery&#8221;.</p>
<p>But he selected the start date of the chart so that you could not see that during the eight years of the Bush administration the employment-population fell from 63.0 to 60.3, a 2.7 drop.</p>
<p>Since Obama took office the employment-population  fell from 60.3 to 58.6, a 1.7 drop.</p>
<p>The ratio has done poorly under both administrations, but people who live in glass houses should be careful about throwing rocks.</p>

                                <p><strong></strong><br /><strong></strong>by <strong>Michael Halasy</strong></p>
<p><strong>Drug shortages and the mythical market</strong><br /><strong><br /></strong><br />I read an interesting article by Gehrett in the January issue of <a href="http://jama.ama-assn.org/content/307/2/153.full" target="_blank">JAMA</a>.</p>
<p>In response to the increased utilization of generic drugs (currently about 70% of drugs used in the US), a fact which should be applauded, we have seen a frightening increase in drug shortages. In Emergency Medicine, three of them have affected me directly as they are commonly used drugs. One, metoclopramide is useful for headaches, nausea, and gastric motility. Another, etomidate, is a useful sedative that is the staple drug in RSI (Rapid Sequence Intubation) kits across the country, and used on EMS ambulances extensively. There is a reason. Etomidate has lower cardiopulmonary depression than other sedatives like diprivan aka propofol. Another drug that is in shortage is Compazine, aka prochlorperazine, which is extensively used for migraines, as well as benign vertigo. In fact, it remains one of my favorite “staple” drugs. </p>
<p>Per the article, in 2005, the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research only noted 62 shortages through the year. 2009 saw 157 shortages, 2010, 178. 2011 had estimates of between 200 and 300. 75% in 2010 were sterile injectables. Ya know, The medications most frequently used in hospital settings. Many of these drugs are made at one site, by only one company, which limits supply and increases the chances of disruption.</p>
<p>While Gehrett does note that 80% of raw materials come from foreign countries, there does not seem to be any shortage of raw materials that have been documented or noted. </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>The only single, commonality, is that all of the medications we have seen in shortage status are off patent, generic medications, that are harder to formulate than some others, and have a definable shelf life. <br />President Obama has signed legislation that will give the FDA more latitude in heading off shortages, but this problem plainly reports to a market problem. Demand exists…supply is stable, but profits are not high on these medications. This would suggest that companies are simply avoiding injectable generics, and focusing on more profitable patented medications. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, cancer trials have been put on hold, while companies focus on profit margins. Headache patients suffer and receive other medications that may be suboptimal for them. This situation is only worsening with time, and should be cause of concern for all Americans.</p>

<p>More on Private Equity, Carried Interest, Wealth, and Romney</p>
<p>Those who&#8217;ve read much of this blog are aware of the various arguments against the notion that private equity firms are &#8220;do-gooders&#8221; that we should encourage and even subsidize (through the carried interest provision). On the whole, I believe they are part of a harmful trend towards consolidation of enterprises that weakens links to communities, makes caring for workers seem like too great a cost, and encourages over-leveraging and instability that ultimately is devastating to the economy. Add to that the egregiously inappropriate tax treatment of &#8220;carried interest&#8221; paid to managers, and you have a wealth-building machine for a small, elite group that does not pay its fair share of the tax burden and whose activities are likely a net social detriment.</p>
<p>Specifically, private equity firms historically have looked for good, stable businesses with decent cash flows, low leverage and decent but not high profits that they can take over, leverage highly (to pay for the acquisition and to provide quick funds to fuel their own ultra-high profit demands), with the cash flow from the ongoing business paying off the debt. The result in these leveraged buyout cases may be that a stable busienss with a profit of 5-6% that spent what was needed on maintenance and new investment, expanding gradually and paying its workers a decent wage and its owners a small but decent profit becomes an overleveraged company that is less stable and has to use more of its cash flow to pay off the debt. </p>
<p>One result of excessive debt is that expenditures for maintenance and investment in new equipment are deferred. and business stalls for the time it takes to pay off the debt. Sometimes that stall is merely a bad time for the business (and often its workers). Liquidity problems can result in proclaimed &#8220;efficiency&#8221; decisions to fire or lay off hundreds of workers and to reshape benefits like pensions and health care. That&#8217;s if the company stays in operation. Sometimes the debt service and resultant deferral of investments and change of focus of the business will be fatal. Costly leverage results in bankruptcy or in the business being broken up and sold in pieces, either way with many workers losing jobs (and benefits) and many communities suffering dire consequences. Whatever happens, the equity fund managers gets high fees and &#8220;carried interest&#8221; profits taxed at inappropriately low tax rates. Romney, for instance, continued to get a &#8220;carried interest&#8221; cut from Bain Capital&#8217;s activities in compensation for past work done, long after he retired from doing any work at the firm in 1999. See <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/romney-using-ethics-exception-to-limit-disclosure-of-bain-holdings/2012/04/05/gIQARcVmxS_story.html?wpisrc=nl_pmpolitics">Romney using ethics exception to limit disclosure of Bain holdings</a>, Washington Post (April 5, 2012).</p>
<p>And of course, private equity firms do not necessarily invest only in domestic companies. They may hold considerable assets offshore&#8211;possibly in some of those very companies that represent low-wage, low-benefits, and low-worker-rights havens for US multinationals that end US jobs here in order to hire more cheaply abroad&#8230;.. Romney, for instance, has holdings in &#8220;a high-tech sensor control firm that has moved U.S. manufacturing jobs to China.&#8221; Id. (noting that these holdings were revealed through SEC filings).</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>One wonders if those realities of equity funds is a reason that Romney has used an ethics exception to limit his disclosure of Bain holdings. See <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/romney-using-ethics-exception-to-limit-disclosure-of-bain-holdings/2012/04/05/gIQARcVmxS_story.html?wpisrc=nl_pmpolitics">Romney using ethics exception to limit disclosure of Bain holdings</a>, Washington Post (April 5, 2012). <br />
<blockquote>By offering a limited description of his assets, Romney has made it difficult to know precisely where his money is invested, whether it is offshore or in controversial companies, or whether those holdings could affect his policies or present any conflicts of interest.<br />In 48 accounts from <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/mitt-romney-bain-capital-and-the-gospel-of-creative-destruction/2012/01/09/gIQAfRKEsP_story.html">Bain Capital</a>, the private equity firm he founded in Boston, Romney declined on his financial disclosure forms to identify the underlying assets, including his holdings in a company that moved U.S. jobs to China and a California firm once owned by Bain that filed for bankruptcy years ago and laid off more than 1,000 workers.<br />***[M]ost of the underlying assets — the specific investments of Bain funds— are not known because Romney is covered by a confidentiality agreement with the company.<br />Several of Romney’s assets — including a large family trust valued at roughly $100 million, nine overseas holdings and 12 partnership interests— were not named initially on his disclosure forms, emerging months later when he agreed to release his tax returns.<br />***<br />Several outside experts across the political spectrum, however, say Romney’s disclosure is the most opaque they have encountered, with some suggesting the filing effectively defeats the spirit of disclosure requirements.<br />***<br />[Romney&#8217;s failure to disclose these assets, and the inapplicability of conflict-of-interest &#8220;must sell&#8221; requirements to a President, mean that we may never know and that Romney may continue to hold positions that would be inappropriate for a sitting president.] Although still subject to the disclosure requirements, a president cannot be compelled by OGE to sell undisclosed assets, according to an OGE official. Romney’s would be the first presidency to face this circumstance. Id.</p></blockquote>
<p>As the article notes, one reason Romney doesn&#8217;t disclose Bain&#8217;s underlying assets is that Bain (a fund he created) requires its participants to enter into confidentiality agreements. Handy for a politician with considerable wealth that the institution he created &#8220;requires&#8221; him to keep its investments secret. But not so handy for the people whom a president is supposed to serve. As Democratic Party lawyer Joe Sandler noted, “Romney’s approach frustrates the very purpose of the ethics and disclosure laws.” Id. The disclosure is intended to &#8220;allow the public to identify potential conflicts of interest and the personal economic priorities of candidates and elected officials.&#8221; Id. (quoting Fred Wertheimer, an advocate who worked on getting the law passed after Watergate). The right answer to a refusal to disclose is that the candidate should divest or else not run for office. Id. (noting that various Washington lawyers provide this advice to candidates who cannot disclose underlying assets).</p>
<p>As the campaign progresses with continuing claims by GOP advocates that Romney&#8217;s &#8220;entrepreneurial&#8221; activity at Bain demonstrates that he has the business sense we purportedly need in a president, more scrutiny will fall on his current holdings as well as Bain&#8217;s past and present activities and just how well such an organization does (or does not) support the country&#8217;s economy.</p>

                                <p>The employment report was a major disappointment.  Payroll employment rose some 120,000, significantly less than the over 200,000 anticipated.  Moreover, the household survey displayed a<br />-31,000 drop in employment.</p>

But that was largely because the labor force fell -164,000</p>

They are not showing the recent improvement that other employment data have been reporting  Recently, unit labor cost has been rising faster than prices, implying margin pressure and very weak profits.  To sustain profits growth, firms have to reestablish stronger productivity growth. The weakness in March employment is a strong indicator that business is trying to rebuild productivity growth and profits growth.</p>

The year over year gain is now only 1.7%, a new record low.  Moreorer, weekly earnings  growth slowed to only 2.2%.  The recent improvement in retail sales had been driven largely by a decline in consumer savings and their are  serious questions about how long this could be sustained.</p>
