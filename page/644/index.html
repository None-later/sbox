                                <p>In the next few weeks four excellent and dynamic writers will begin posting at Angry Bear on a soon to be determined but regular basis.  Many already know the quality of thought and expertise each offers, so it is with great pleasure that we welcome them into the fold of Angry Bear contributors.</p>
<p><a href="http://bruceweb.blogspot.com/">Bruce Webb</a> has offered his expertise on Social Security and other topics on many sites.  He has agreed to write on Social Security at levels that go beyond Soc Sec 101 to allow us deeper thinking on this important topic.  I am hoping he gives a few history lessons along the way.</p>
<p>Tom Bozzo, an economist, publishes at <a href="http://atbozzo.blogspot.com/">Marginal Utility</a> on a variety of issues.</p>
<p>Ken Houghton, an economist, also posts at Marginal Utility and <a href="http://economicsquestionoftheday.blogspot.com/">Economic Question of the Day</a> and has commented often at Angry Bear. </p>
<p><a href="http://afferentinput.blogspot.com/">Afferent input</a> is a newcomer who at the moment takes a chart and macro line of posting, and weaves a good narrative.</p>
<p>Angry Bear is an economic blog that includes professional economists, knowledgeable insiders in various positions of business and/or government, and interested amateurs to keep them honest, and as group contributors bring a wealth of expertise, knowledge, experience, and variety of interests to the postings.</p>
<p>While left of center in spirit, we provide at least three ideas somewhat unique to econoblogging in my experience:</p>
<p>First, guest posts are a common feature here, and are accepted from people of all walks of life if well thought out and honest in intent.</p>
<p>Second, some regular contributors have admitted to being Independent or even Republican, but posts are designed to be informative first and partisanship is made clear if they happen to be part of the post.  Partisanship is not the same as &#8216;strong point of view&#8217;.</p>
<p>Third, so far we have been able to maintain open comments, because commentors who might have started as &#8216;snarkers&#8217; have upgraded their comments to take a useful stand.  How cool is that!? </p>
<p>I am excited about the direction these new contributors can take us in addition to our excellent current team.</p>
<p>Welcome.</p>

<blockquote><p>When asked this morning by ABC News&#8217; George Stephanopoulos if she could name a single economist who backs her call for a gas tax holiday this summer, HRC said &#8220;I&#8217;m not going to put my lot in with economists.” I know several of the economists who have been advising Senator Clinton, so I phoned them right after I heard this. I reached two of them. One hadn’t heard her remark and said he couldn’t believe she’d say it. The other had heard it and shrugged it off as “politics as usual.” That’s the problem: Politics as usual &#8230; In case you’ve missed it, we now have a president who doesn’t care what most economists think. George W. Bush doesn’t even care what scientists think. He rejects all experts who disagree with his politics. This has led to some extraordinarily stupid policies. I’m not saying HRC is George Bush. And I&#8217;m not suggesting economists have all the answers. But when economists tell a president or a presidential candidate that his or her idea is dumb – and when all respectable economists around America agree that it’s a dumb idea – it’s probably wise for the president or presidential candidate to listen. When the president or candidate doesn’t, and proudly defends the policy by saying she&#8217;s &#8220;not going to put my lot in with economists,” we’ve got a problem, folks. Even though the summer gas tax holiday is pure hokum, it polls well, which is why HRC and John McCain are pushing it. That Barack Obama is not in favor of it despite its positive polling numbers speaks volumes about the kind of president he’ll be – and the kind of president we’d otherwise get from McCain and HRC. Haven’t we had enough of politicians who reject facts in favor of short-term poll-driven politics?</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://tpmelectioncentral.talkingpointsmemo.com/2008/05/hillary_its_me_and_ordinary_fo.php">Greg Sargent</a> saw the same ABC interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>Hillary Clinton has just started doing an Indiana town-hall meeting being broadcast on ABC, and George Stephanopoulos asked her a direct question: Could she name a single economist who agrees with her support for the gas tax holiday? Hillary sidestepped the question, and tried to use the complete dearth of expert support for the idea to her advantage, pointing to it as proof that she&#8217;s on the side of ordinary folks against &#8220;elite opinion&#8221; &#8212; a phrase she used twice. &#8220;I think we&#8217;ve been for the last seven years seeing a tremendous amount of government power and elite opinion behind policies that haven&#8217;t worked well for hard working Americans,&#8221; she said. A bit later she added: &#8220;It&#8217;s really odd to me that arguing to give relief to a vast majority of Americans creates this incredible pushback&#8230;Elite opinion is always on the side of doing things that don&#8217;t benefit&#8221; the vast majority of the American people. An ordinary voter begged to differ, however. Stephanopoulos turned the mike over to a woman who said she supported Obama and said she makes less than $25,000 a year. &#8220;I do feel pandered to when you talk about suspending the gas tax,&#8221; the woman said, adding: &#8220;Call me crazy but I actually listen to economists because I think they know what they&#8217;ve studied.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>So Senator Clinton thinks telling the voters the truth is elitist.  She’s become the perfect Republican!</p>

This post will focus on what Kudlow argues for the current economy:</p>
<blockquote><p>after the most recent jobs report — which produced a much-smaller-than-expected decline in corporate payrolls, a huge 362,000 increase in the more entrepreneurial household survey (the best gain in five months), and a historically low 5 percent unemployment rate (4.95 percent, to be precise) &#8230; First-quarter GDP growth came in at 0.6 percent. It wasn’t the widely predicted decline, and economists expect that number to be revised up. GDP growth for the fourth quarter of 2007 was also up slightly, while the prior two quarters averaged over 4 percent growth.  My pal Jimmy Pethokoukis quotes Stanford professor Robert Hall, who heads the recession-dating committee at the National Bureau of Economic Research: “It seems unlikely that we would ever declare a peak-date when real GDP continued to rise.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Didn’t I <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/05/news-from-employment-report-bls.html">predict</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I peaked over at the NRO’s The Corner to see if Lawrence Kudlow has once again flipped flopped and declared the household survey to be a more accurate reflection of the jobs market</p></blockquote>
<p>Kudlow, however, does not have the integrity to note that the employment-population was only 62.7% after this “huge” increase or that the payroll survey figure has declined by 260,000 over the past four months.  But to say that a 5% unemployment rate is “historically low” sort of cuts history off at last month.  The unemployment rate was 4.8% in February and was less than 4% for much of 2000.  </p>
<p>But for my money, this ambiguous writing really takes the cake:</p>
<blockquote><p>GDP growth for the fourth quarter of 2007 was also up slightly, while the prior two quarters averaged over 4 percent growth.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let’s be more precise – the annualized growth rates for 2008QI and 2007QIV were the same as for 2007QI: 0.6%.  So having a couple of decent quarters hardly makes up for the sluggish growth for the other three.  Especially given the fact that <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/04/30/about-that-gdp-report">final sales demand</a> fell last quarter.</p>
<p>Some have wondered if Kudlow is inflicted with massive stupidity or incredible mendacity.  I submit he’s inflicted with both.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Kudlow Looks at Energy</p>
<p>So I&#8217;m playing with some data from the Department of Energy&#8217;s Energy <br />Information Administration this morning. Their <a href="http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/aer/txt/stb0101.xls">Table 1.1</a> gives <br />you an energy overview &#8211; showing energy production, imports, and <br />exports. I halt for breakfast, at which point I read this piece by <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=NDM0OGU3Nzk0MTMyMGI3NTU1Y2JmYWVhOWU3OTU4ZGQ=">Kudlow</a> and almost choke:</p>
<blockquote><p>Democrats are now calling for a windfall profits tax. Last time we tried that — under Jimmy Carter — foreign energy imports rose 8 to 16 percent and domestic energy production fell 3 to 6 percent. (This according top a study by the Congressional Research Service.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Kudlow doesn&#8217;t link to the Congressional Research Service piece and I <br />don&#8217;t feel like looking for it, but I can tell you straight up that the <br />figures Kudlow provided are wrong. Completely wrong.</p>
<p>According to the DOE, energy production figures (billion BTU) look like <br />this:</p>
<p>1976: 61,601,809, <br />1977: 62,051,547 , <br />1978: 63,137,182, <br />1979: 65,947,815 <br />1980: 67,232,462</p>
<p>Can anyone spot the 3 to 6 percent drop? I note that the country&#8217;s <br />annualized increase in energy output was quite a bit faster under Carter <br />than under any of the presidents that followed him, and over 11 times <br />faster than under Reagan, who presumably Kudlow would never accuse of <br />raising taxes on energy.</p>
<p>What about imports? The DOE gives us these figures:</p>
<p>1976: 16,760,058  <br />1977: 19,948,129  <br />1978: 19,106,170  <br />1979: 19,459,809 <br />1980: 15,796,247</p>
<p>To Kudlow that&#8217;s an 8 to 16 percent hike. To me, it looks yes, there was <br />a spike, but it was followed by a rather unusual drop in energy imports. <br />After all, the data provided by the DOE runs from 1949 to 2006, and <br />Carter was the only President under whom imports were lower when he left <br />office than we arrived. I note also that energy exports also increased <br />while Carter was in office, leading to a decline in net energy imports &#8211; <br />something that didn&#8217;t happen under any other president in the sample <br />except Truman (for whom we only have data starting in &#8217;49).</p>
<p>I honestly don&#8217;t know what Carter did with taxes, and conditions during <br />an Oil Embargo may not be easily transferable, but I for one am having a <br />hard time being swayed by what Mr. Kudlow wrote.<br />_________________________</p>

                                <p>The rather symbolic arguments and passion demonstrated about the gas tax holiday illustrate the odd and quixotic nature of what catches our imagination.  The $30 I save over the summer has more relevance to my life than the lost $$$$$ (hundreds?) out of my pocket each year, and the notion of security dribbles away as the Pentagon cannot determine the reality of what makes me safe.  Great.  And the voices of concern are heard only faintly.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.portfolio.com/news-markets/national-news/portfolio/2008/04/14/">Pentagons-Accounting-Mess</a> <em>Portfolio</em> comments on accounting methods of the Pentagon.</p>
<blockquote><p>On a winter afternoon in Indianapolis, Jessica Hilligoss, a young Defense Department worker, types long strings of numbers and letters into a computer, helping the United States armed forces transfer the billions of dollars it draws each week from the Federal Reserve to contractors, vendors, and military and civilian personnel.</p>
<p>Her job is to review invoices for everything from construction projects to lawnmowing, and to approve payment. Within a few days, another computer system—behind locked doors in the building&#8217;s basement—deposits the money in the recipients&#8217; bank accounts.</p>
<p>The size of nearly 28 football fields, with a facade of alternating red stucco and white cement tiles, the three-story operations center is the federal government&#8217;s third-largest office building, after the Pentagon and the Ronald Reagan Building, and the place where a big chunk of the Iraq war&#8217;s soaring price is paid. The center doles out more than $104 billion annually, making it Defense&#8217;s largest disburser.</p>
<p>Theoretically, when Hilligoss authorizes a payment, the department should be able to instantly track where the money goes and which program it was spent on, in order to make sure the right amounts are paid to the right recipients at the right times. But it doesn&#8217;t work that way. </p>
<p>Since 2004, the Pentagon has spent roughly $16 billion annually to maintain and modernize the military&#8217;s business systems, but most are as unreliable as ever—even as the surge in defense spending is creating more room for error. The basic defense budget for 2007 was $439.3 billion, up 48 percent from 2001, excluding the vast additional sums appropriated for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. According to federal regulators and current and former Pentagon officials, the accounting process is so obsolete and error prone that it&#8217;s virtually impossible to tell where much of this money ends up. While the department&#8217;s brass has made a few patchwork improvements, billions are still unaccounted for. The problem is so deeply rooted that, 18 years after Congress required major federal agencies to be audited, the Pentagon still can&#8217;t be. (Read a chronology of efforts to modernize the military&#8217;s financial systems.)</p>
<p>For the first three quarters of 2007, $1.1 trillion in Army accounting entries hadn&#8217;t been properly reviewed and substantiated, according to the Department of Defense&#8217;s inspector general. In 2006, $258.2 billion of recorded withdrawals and payments from the Army&#8217;s main account were unsupported. It&#8217;s as if the Army had submitted multibillion-dollar expense reports without any receipts.</p>
<p>Preoccupied with protecting their turf, the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marines continue to maintain separate, increasingly outdated systems that can&#8217;t talk to each other, trace disbursements, or detect overbilling by contractors. At the Indianapolis facility, as at the Defense Department&#8217;s four other main U.S. centers for financial operations, accounting programs under the same roof can&#8217;t share information without extensive jury-rigging, as though contracts, payments, and accounting had nothing to do with one another.</p></blockquote>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Back on April 20th I presented <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/04/enlightenment-you-and-me-and-china-make.html">my introduction</a> to a book by Will Hutton: The Writing on the Wall. </p>
<p>First, the book is 334 pages.  The list of references 39 pages.  There is a lot I could cover.  But this is the Angry Bear which I view as being about US(of A).  It is this part of Mr. Hutton&#8217;s writing that caught my attention.  As much as I am interested in China&#8217;s life influencing ours, I am more interested in understanding what happened to us.  </p>
<p>I presented his concept of values coming out of the Enlightenment as being the basis for what the USA (as a stand-in for referencing Western processes) had achieved and what China has to move more toward.  It is not that China must model us exactly, but that it&#8217;s current structure is limited.  It needs to be more democratic based on values from the Enlightenment.  Mr. Hutton presents the democratic Enlightenment concepts as four: <em>“accountability; representativenesss; respect for the rule of law; and the capacity, through free speech, for debate, exchange, and interaction.”    </em></p>
<p>As much as the book looks at China and how it does not meet these concepts sufficiently to allow it to grow such that it will meet the needs of it&#8217;s people, I want to focus on his view of us.  In this case, the USA specifically.  I believe he points to the USA because it was the leader in the world, as he presents the case, for manifesting the democratic Enlightenment concepts.  I believe, his view of the Enlightenment is in agreement with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment">Wiki&#8217;s presentation</a>:<br /><em>The Enlightenment is held to be the source of critical ideas, such as the centrality of freedom, democracy and reason as primary values of society. This view argues that the establishment of a contractual basis of rights would lead to the market mechanism and capitalism, the scientific method, religious tolerance, and the organization of states into self-governing republics through democratic means. In this view, the tendency of the philosophes in particular to apply rationality to every problem is considered the essential change.</em></p>
<p>The discussion of Enlightenment begins with free trade and that the USA is <em>“not a natural candidate to support an open world trading and financial system&#8230;”</em>  We benefit, but we are “<em>ambivalent</em>”. “<em>An open trading system tempts every country to pursue strategic trade policies that are much more mercantilist in their rationale&#8230;All genuflect to the rules-based openness of the trading system as regulated by the World Trade Organization.  But they believe in it more because it is the means to secure their strategic, mercantilist aims than because of any desire to create gains in which everyone would share.”  </em></p>
<p>Mr Hutton is pro free trade.  He makes a case that America&#8217;s growth was less do to protectionist positions taken early on and more the result of a growing population with access to free land.  Space and ambition were the key.  As the coasts were joined, we moved to substitute foreign trade for the loss of our frontier.  <em>“The aim was not to create an overseas empire but to export the American idea&#8230;” </em>unlike the European expansionism.  And as expected, he flatly states that free-trade is not the cause of the condition we find ourself in currently.  Though he thinks both sides, one portrayed by Lou Dobbs and the other by Friedman need to be “<em>cooled down</em>”.  They are both “<em>vastly exaggerated</em>”. </p>
<p>The source of our mis-thinking is found in how we view liberty.  “<em>Liberty, in the American narrative, is the sun under which everything flourishes.  Liberty permits individuals&#8217; hard work, courage, and application to produce wealth and happiness.  Government should not get in the way&#8230;Liberty and the American dream are linked&#8230;The great conservative counterrevolution &#8230;has been grounded in its brilliant capacity to exploit these cultural icons to support its own cause.”</em></p>
<p>But this is an error of our self perception. It is more correct to view liberty as a goal within <em>“&#8230;a highly sophisticated Enlightenment political infrastructure.”  </em>“<em>Look at the United States&#8230;and you will see an economy and society characterized by pluralism, diversity, and investment in individual capabilities.”</em></p>
<p>He bolsters this view by presenting Alexis de Tocqueville&#8217;s work about America.  <em>“Public engagement and never-ending argument leavened what otherwise might have been a culture of egoism&#8230;and transmuted it into a culture in which egalitarianism and individualism enriched each other.  Self-interest was not only a matter of bettering oneself; it was also a mattter of ensureing that there would be a vigorous public life and opportunity for others&#8230;The same impulse&#8211;wanting the best for oneself and for others— prompts much of American civic activism.”   </em>Our liberty <em>“always included conceptual egalitarianism, which provided the tension between the ambition and appetites of the propertied rich and their accountability to society.” “This is not the egalitarianism of income or opportunity; rather, it is the equality of self-esteem, self worth and possibility&#8230;there is no obstacle of title, birth, accent or social rank&#8230;”  </em></p>
<p>It make you feel proud, does it not?  Unfortunately he notes we are losing it through <em>“neglect and willful disparagement of their importance, in particular by American conservatives.”</em>  We are losing the <em>“fecund interaction”</em> of markets and the price mechanism with the Enlightenment infrastructure and resultant culture.  Mr Hutton states it was our genius.</p>
<p>This is where I will go next.  What has changed.  I believe it was my very first post via an invite from Cactus (he posted it for me) that I made the statement that we had changed.  We no longer were making money as we had.  We no longer were focused on what we use to. It was more than just tax rates that changed in the Reagan years.</p>

                                <p>Part of the motivation behind the last from <a href="http://www.williampolley.com/blog/archives/2008/05/gas_tax_holiday.html">Bill Polley</a> seems to be comments from AB readers who are not buying the 100% of the incidence goes to suppliers argument:</p>
<blockquote><p>This is Econ 101&#8211;tax incidence theory. This is bread and butter for economists. But our pronouncements are only as good as what we really know about the relevant supply and demand elasticities. To make things even more interesting, the question of incidence (i.e. whose price will rise or fall) is not just a matter of absolute elasticities, but of the relative elasticities of demand and supply. Supply may be relatively fixed in the summer, but if short run demand is also inelastic, it is not a foregone conclusion that the suppliers will get all the benefit.</p></blockquote>
<p>Bill continues his excellent discussion noting that his read of the evidence suggests that the benefit will be split evenly.  Bill conclusion is also a must read:</p>
<blockquote><p>My conclusion: Maybe you would benefit 5 or 6 cents per gallon, give or take a couple pennies. Maybe a couple dollars a week. Better than nothing, I suppose, but only a tiny fraction of the &#8220;fiscal stimulus&#8221; check that I received this week. But then there&#8217;s the issue of how to replace the lost revenue (revenue that is used to maintain the crumbling roads and to create jobs in a seasonal industry that is going to need to take up some of the slack from the slowdown in construction and manufacturing). Clinton proposes a tax on oil company profits. That&#8217;s the part that Krugman calls not evil, but pointless. In one pocket and out the other. Maybe not totally pointless, but definitely in the neighborhood.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>Mayor Bloomberg tells us <a href="http://www.observer.com/2008/bloomberg-gas-tax-break-dumbest-thing">what he really thinks</a> of this proposal:</p>
<blockquote><p>Michael Bloomberg said giving drivers a break from the gas tax is “the dumbest thing I’ve heard in an awful long time.” I asked him about it right after he delivered his executive budget at City Hall just now. He said, “It’s the dumbest thing I’ve heard in an awful long time from an economic point of view. I don’t understand why you think there’s any merit to it whatsoever. We’re trying to discourage people from driving and we’re trying to end our energy dependence. We don’t do that—oh, and incidentally, we’re trying to have more money to build infrastructure. All three of those things go fly in the face of giving everybody $30 a year. The $30 bucks is not going to change anybody’s lifestyle. The billions of dollars that we would otherwise have in tax revenues can make a big difference as to what kind of a world we leave our children.” Bloomberg praised officials who opposed the “summer break on gasoline taxes which would help Chavez, Qaddafi and other people like that. I don’t know why anybody would want to do it.” He went on to say critics like Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver were right. &#8220;And,&#8221; he added, &#8220;[Barack] Obama was right on this one, and that [John] McCain and [Hillary] Clinton were wrong. The last thing we need to do is encourage people to drive more and to take away the monies we need for infrastructure in this country.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>It turns out that certain local NY politicians want to suspend the local taxes on gasoline too.  Let’s here from one of these panderers – just to be fair and balanced:</p>
<blockquote><p>Joe Bruno&#8217;s spokesman, Mark Hansen, responds: &#8220;The vast majority of New Yorkers, especially upstate, must rely on their cars to get to work and school and do not have any mass transit. The rising price of gas is costing them $10 to $20 more every time they fill up their tanks. The Senate, like John McCain and Hillary Clinton, support cutting gas taxes because it is the right thing to do to give New Yorkers relief.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.senatorbruno.com/43/default.aspx">Joseph Bruno</a> is a Republican state senator representing the 43rd State Senate District (Rensselaer County and most of Saratoga County).  His statement on this issue can be found <a href="http://www.senatorbruno.com/43/news.aspx?nid=17921">here</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>With gasoline prices now approaching $4 per gallon and putting a strain on New York’s hardworking families and small businesses, Senator Bruno announced the Senate will act on legislation to provide much needed relief at the gas pump by suspending New York State’s gasoline taxes during the summer travel season. The bill will eliminate the New York State taxes on gasoline from Memorial Day weekend through Labor Day. If the federal, State and local governments all temporarily suspended their taxes, New Yorkers would save 65 cents per gallon at the pump.If the State enacts this tax relief plan, New Yorkers would save approximately 32 cents per gallon in state gasoline taxes under the plan, including 16 cents from the State’s Petroleum Business Tax, 8 cents from the State sales tax, and 8 cents from the State’s Motor Fuel Excise Tax &#8230; Under the Senate plan, the average price of a gallon of diesel fuel would be reduced from $4.58 to $3.93.</p></blockquote>
<p>Bruno is assuming 100% of the incidence of fuel taxes accrues to consumers, but many economics argue that most of the incidence accrues to suppliers.  I look forward to Mayor Bloomberg pointing out how dumb Senator Bruno is with respect to this issue.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Alison Fitzgerald of <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=washingtonstory&#038;sid=aQgAcP5he5WA">Bloomberg.com</a> writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Economists have a different take: They say the oil companies may end up the biggest beneficiaries, while the aid to families wouldn&#8217;t be enough to buy a $35 backpack. The trouble with the plan, they say, is that oil prices are rising because of low supplies, and companies will continue to charge the average $3.60 a gallon and just pocket the money that would have gone to federal taxes. &#8220;That&#8217;s $10 billion, and it&#8217;s going into the pockets of oil refiners,&#8221; said Leonard Burman of the Tax Policy Center in Washington. &#8220;The last time I checked, they didn&#8217;t need it.&#8221; Supplies are &#8220;being cleared at the current price,&#8221; said Donald Parsons, an economics professor at George Washington University in Washington. &#8220;If you take away the tax, you&#8217;ll have the same number of consumers willing to buy the gas at the same total price.&#8221; </p></blockquote>

                                <p><a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm">BLS</a> released its Employment Situation Summary for April this morning:</p>
<blockquote><p>Nonfarm payroll employment was little changed in April (-20,000), following job losses that totaled 240,000 in the first 3 months of the year, the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the U.S. Department of Labor reported today.  The unemployment rate, at 5.0 percent, also was little changed in April.  Employment continued to decline in construction, manufacturing, and retail trade, while jobs were added in health care and in professional and technical services.</p></blockquote>
<p>Actually, the unemployment rate fell from 5.1% as the employment to population ratio rose from 62.6% to 62.7%.  The household survey is reporting 362 thousand news jobs even though the payroll survey reports job losses.</p>
<p><a href="http://money.cnn.com/2008/05/02/news/economy/jobs_april/index.htm?cnn=yes">CNNMoney</a> had an odd way of spinning the payroll survey number:</p>
<blockquote><p>Jobs: &#8216;Not as bad as we thought&#8217; &#8230; Employers trim payroll for fourth straight month, although decline is less than forecasts … There was a net loss of 20,000 jobs in the month, according to the Labor Department report, compared to the revised loss of 81,000 jobs in the March reading. Economists surveyed by Briefing.com had forecast a loss of 75,000 jobs in April.  The unemployment rate slipped to 5% from the 5.1% reading in March. Economists had been forecasting unemployment would rise to 5.2% in the latest report. &#8220;It&#8217;s not good news, but it&#8217;s not as bad as we thought it would be,&#8221; said David Wyss, chief economist for Standard &#038; Poor&#8217;s.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: I peaked over at the NRO’s The Corner to see if Lawrence Kudlow has once again flipped flopped and declared the household survey to be a more accurate reflection of the jobs market, but not yet.  I did see <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=MGQ2Nzk3OGNiM2RjZmFjOTNkYjkxNGY2MzJkZWUzOTQ=">Ramesh Ponnuru</a> proving once again that no one at the National Review knows how to read what the BLS wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Jobs Numbers and the Unemployment Rate  &#8211; It is not unheard of for the two numbers to move in different directions. If, for example, the number of jobs falls while the number of people looking for work also falls, the unemployment rate can drop. </p></blockquote>
<p>There have been months when the employment to population ratio fell but the labor force participation rate fell by even more, which leads to a lower reported unemployment rate.  But had Ramesh bothered to review the data, he would have seen an unchanged labor force participation rate and a higher employment to population ratio.  Can these clowns be more stupid?</p>
