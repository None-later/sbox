                                <p><a href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/beat_the_press_archive?month=04&#038;year=2008&#038;base_name=disability_insurers_flood_soci">Dean Baker</a> praises an article by <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/01/business/01disabled.html?hp">Mary Williams Walsh</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The NYT has an article on two whistleblower lawsuits directed against insurers for requiring beneficiaries to apply for Social Security disability, even when they would not qualify, as a condition of being paid benefits. This can both mean unnecessary harassment for beneficiaries and also excessive paperwork demands on Social Security. This is the sort of reporting that newspapers are supposed to do.</p></blockquote>
<p>A few excerpts from Mary’s article:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Social Security system is choking on paperwork and spending millions of dollars a year screening dubious applications for disability benefits, according to lawsuits filed by whistle-blowers.  Insurance companies are the source of the problem, the lawsuits say. The insurers are forcing many people who file disability claims with them to also apply to Social Security — even people who clearly do not qualify for the government program.  The Social Security Administration defines “disabled” much more stringently than the insurers generally do, so it rejects most of the applications, at least initially. Often, the insurers then tell their claimants to appeal, the lawsuits say, raising the cost.  The insurers say that requiring a Social Security assessment is a standard practice and that there is nothing wrong with it.  The policies they sell allow them to coordinate their benefit payments with others to make sure no one is paid twice. Thus, if a disabled person can get benefits from somewhere else — like workers’ compensation, a disability pension or Social Security — the insurance company can reduce the benefit check by that amount. The flood of referrals, however, is making it hard for Social Security to respond to people who are truly disabled, said Kenneth D. Nibali, the former top administrator of the Social Security disability program.  “Anybody who is forced to come into this system, and who doesn’t need to be there, is affecting someone else,” said Mr. Nibali, who retired in 2002 and is serving as an expert witness for the plaintiffs. “They’re holding up cases for the people who have been waiting for months and years, who in many cases are much worse off.”  Already, the disability program is in much worse shape financially than the old-age portion of Social Security. It is projected to run out of money in 2026, 16 years ahead of the old-age trust fund.</p></blockquote>
<p>I find it interesting that the administrative law judges who hear these cases see an attorney who is allegedly representing the individual but who is really being paid by the private insurance company.  Take for example the case of Jessica Ortiz:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Social Security Administration is not an active participant in the lawsuits and declined to comment on them. A spokesman, Mark Lassiter, said Social Security does not keep track of how many of its roughly 2.5 million annual applicants for disability are referred by insurance companies. But he cited academic research showing that 18 percent acknowledged privately that they were unqualified, because they could still work. “It is probable that many of these claimants were required to apply,” Mr. Lassiter said. Jessica Ortiz, a 27-year-old gas station attendant in San Diego, said that was what happened to her. Her disability insurer, the Unum Group, called more than 10 times after she was hurt in a car crash, insisting that she apply for Social Security and asking repeatedly where her application stood. Unum was paying her only $50 a month under her policy, she said, which seemed a small amount to merit so much attention. She did not need or want money from Social Security, and did not think she was entitled to it. Her doctors had told her she would recover, and Social Security is limited to people whose disabilities are total and permanent. But she applied because Unum insisted, she said.  Ten months after her accident, Ms. Ortiz returned to work. Social Security turned her down, as she had expected. People who can work are by definition unqualified for disability pay from the government. But when she told the Unum representative what had happened, he told her she could still appeal. “If I were the government, I’d be pretty upset,” she said. “No wonder the pot could run out of money.”When the circumstances of Ms. Ortiz’s case were described, a spokesman for Unum said he could not comment without reviewing her case file. The spokesman, Jim Sabourin, said the company believed that it always had valid reasons for telling people to apply for Social Security.</p></blockquote>
<p>One has to wonder whether the administrative law judge even knew that the attorney that was purportedly representing Ms. Ortiz was really working on behalf of the Unum Group.  This scam has been going on for years – and I’m glad that Mary Williams Walsh is beginning to bring it to light.</p>

                                <p>Ken Houghton calls attention to <a href="http://rodrik.typepad.com/dani_rodriks_weblog/2008/03/american-politi.html">this Dani Rodrik</a> post:</p>
<blockquote><p>When a Republican president is in power, people at the top of the income distribution experience much larger real income gains than those at the bottom&#8211;a difference of 1.5 percent per year going from the bottom to the top quintile in the income distribution. The situation is reversed when a Democrat is in power: those who benefit the most are the lower income groups. If you are in the bottom quintile, the difference between having a Democratic or a Republican president in office is an income gain (or loss) of more than 2 percent per year! Strikingly, compared to Republicans, Democratic presidents generate higher income gains for all income groups (although the difference is statistically significant only for lower income groups).</p></blockquote>
<p>None of this should come as a surprise to anyone who has been following my series of posts on Presidential Performance.</p>
<p>And to answer the point that comes up in comments over and over&#8230; yes, there&#8217;s a reason why Party matters.  Party affiliation is not some random event.  There&#8217;s a reason why most candidates who are affiliated with one Party aren&#8217;t affiliated with the other Party, and it has to do with Party values.  Democrats favor one set of principles, Republicans another.  Sometimes core values change, but most of the core values that affect economics do not.  Among the core differences that have remained more or less constant for a very long time are:  views on regulation, views on externalities, focus on big business versus the little guy, views on taxes.  Each of these things are issues that Republicans tell us affect economic growth.  Well, guess what &#8211; they&#8217;re right.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>Update&#8230; I left out a key detail.  The findings Rodrik quotes are from an upcoming book by <a rhef="http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8664.html">Larry Bartels</a>.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>Correction&#8230; the link I had to Dani Rodrik&#8217;s post was wrong, and has been corrected.  Apologies.</p>

<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>This post relates to <a href="http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d08467sp.pdf">GAO 08-467SP: Assessment of Selected Weapon Systems</a> (warning &#8211; its a PDF file about 6 meg in size)</p>
<p>Today I want to present some ideas on one of their corollaries for why the DoD Weapon Systems do not meet requirements. It is as if you graduate your F students all the time. Okay happens for certain fellas at Yale and Harvard Business but not okay if there were ever a need for the useless stuff.</p>
<p>The GAO concludes from a study of 52 programs that about 48% of the program staffs were contractors or other non government personnel. This is consistent with my observations with some services using more far contractors. In many instances the contractor employees do for the government people, but that is another story.</p>
<p>See table 6 of the report.</p>
<p>Corollary is not necessarily causation, and GAO does not do that type of study nor support any hypothesis testing to say that using contractors is a cause of programs overrunning, costing too much and giving less than contracted performance.</p>
<p>The contractors in question are Advisory and Assistance Services (A&#038;AS) which were not covered in last week&#8217;s two GAO posts. A&#038;AS are covered in FAR part 37. The first issue I have with GAO is why they do not comment, as green eyeshade auditors should, about how the program managers buy A&#038;AS as &#8216;staff&#8217;, when according to the FAR A&#038;AS are &#8220;non personal services&#8221; forms of contracts and even the appearance of an employee relationship is a violation of A&#038;AS contract scope?</p>
<p>Done all the time, excused as level of effort. Not right, but very common.</p>
<p>Note the citation from Table 6 that in the 52 offices reviewed the smallest percent of A&#038;AS personal servants was in &#8216;program management&#8217; (the non financial/accounting and non technical folks) who &#8216;paint the lipstick on the pigs&#8217;, they advocate rather than deliver a good product: 30% A&#038;AS contractors doing &#8220;program management&#8221; while in the area of engineering and technical skills 52% were contractors.</p>
<p>The government relies on contractors (to do the analysis for government engineers) for most of the technical determinations and reviews and that is one area where performance issues are glossed over failure ignored and deviations accepted with no analysis on impact on performance and cost. It is very easy to fire an already falsely &#8220;hired&#8221; A&#038;AS person when they point out that the program manager is wrong (emperor has no clothes) in waiving a performance requirement that will raise cost in the future.</p>
<p>Too much contractor employment, even though they are retired colonels passing through the revolving door, is not good for the effectiveness of our new gold plated, not so functioning weapons.</p>
<p>Failure is not an option, just do it over and pay them over and over. Good thing there is no need for the thing.</p>

                                <p>Angry Bear has been steadily increasing its readership, but in the last three months especially has seen a significant rise in visits. For the first time ever we had over 100,000 visits in March, which is a milestone given that around 60,000 was common. (Real figures can be evaluated on the sitemeter. January saw 90,000, February saw 80,000).</p>
<p>Of course our friend <a href="http://calculatedrisk.blogspot.com/">Calculated Risk</a> refers many to Angry Bear over several years, but I also want to especially give a hat-tip to <a href="http://realclearmarkets.com/">Real Clear Markets</a> for consistent reference to Angry Bear in their Off the Street section.</p>
<p><a href="http://blogreport.salon.com/default.aspx">Salon-The Blog Report</a> has carried Angry Bear posts consistently recently. Readers from<a href="http://nakedcapitalism.com/"> Naked Capitalism</a> have come by more often as well.  Mark Thoma at <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/">Economist&#8217;s View</a> carries posts from Angry Bear in the weekly links update, listed by author, but seems to be including more of our posts.  Thank you.</p>
<p>I want to take the time to thank Calculated Risk and Real Clear Markets readers for their vote of confidence.</p>

                                <p>If you look at the data on traffic deaths it is obvious that we are doing something right in the US.<br />As far back as the data goes traffic deaths have been falling at a -3.2% annual rate.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/R_FG5ymoYcI/AAAAAAAAAK8/G2ghLkkbgNI/s1600-h/01+deaths.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/R_FG5ymoYcI/AAAAAAAAAK8/G2ghLkkbgNI/s320/01+deaths.jpg" border="0"></a><br />But if your source of information was economics you would be hard pressed to know this. It has been long shown that driving/riding in a small car was dangerous and led to more deaths. But now we have a new study at http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1080911<br />where Michael Anderson found that driving a large SUV led to the same results &#8212; more deaths.</p>
<p>It is as if economists found that living was bad for your health.</p>
<p>The approach that I&#8217;ve long had troubles with is the Peltzman Effect that concludes that seat belts cause more deaths. Peltzman agrees that wearing a belt and having air bags sharply reduces the changes of death if you are in an accident. He does question the government estimate that these reduce your chance of death by 50%. Rather Peltzman argues that wearing a seatbelt makes you feel safer and so drive more dangerously and this causes more accidents<br />that offsets the gains from wearing seatbelts. They conclude that one should ignore the direct evidence that seatbelt use and traffic deaths have a -0.9 correlation.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/R_FJpimoYdI/AAAAAAAAALE/fih1xHoNO6I/s1600-h/01+coorel.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/R_FJpimoYdI/AAAAAAAAALE/fih1xHoNO6I/s320/01+coorel.jpg" border="0"></a></p>
<p>Rather they model traffic deaths as a function of real income, demographics, crime, race, congestion, and other similar developments and develop models where seat belt use has a positive rather then a negative sign.</p>
<p>Of course if you look at the -3.2% trend and regress it against almost any real economic variable it would show up as a powerful variable that is likely to swamp other variables. But I&#8217;m not going to get into that now.</p>
<p>However, there are studies that use the same approach and find a much weaker impact and even find no evidence for the Peltzman Effect. On is a study by Alma Cohen and Liran Einav,<br />THE EFFECTS OF MANDATORY SEAT BELT LAWS ON DRIVING BEHAVIOR AND TRAFFIC FATALITIES at http://www.stanford.edu/~leinav/pubs/RESTAT2003.pdf.<br />Cohen and Einav even suggest an alternative thesis that the act of putting on a seat belt makes a driver think about how dangerous it is on the road and leads to them driving more carefully&#8211;<br />just the opposite of the Peltzman Effect.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not going to go in to the econometric arguments behind these two opposing thesis. Rather I&#8217;m going to take a different approach.</p>
<p>The Peltzman Effect contents that sealtbelts cause more accidents. But when I look at the accident data I find that the data shows falling accident rates. The first data series is a very old series on the number of accidents from the National Safety Council &#8212; I found it in the Statistical Abstract. It shows that accidents have fallen since sealtbelts were first started to be widely used in the early 1960 and really fell sharply after laws were passed at the state level in the 1980s making sealtbelt use mandatory. That is when seatbelt use also jumped sharply.<br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/R_FNAymoYeI/AAAAAAAAALM/yEVgr51EB3w/s1600-h/01+accidents.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/R_FNAymoYeI/AAAAAAAAALM/yEVgr51EB3w/s320/01+accidents.jpg" border="0"></a></p>
<p>The second set of data is a new series from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration<br />that shows traffic crashes since 1989. It can be found at http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/people/injury/SafetyBelt/OPIPT_FinalRpt_07-17-03.pdf<br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/R_FOACmoYfI/AAAAAAAAALU/U6xeYNLKOwM/s1600-h/01+crashes.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/R_FOACmoYfI/AAAAAAAAALU/U6xeYNLKOwM/s320/01+crashes.jpg" border="0"></a><br />The people doing the Pelzman type studies think that the accident data is unreliable and do not use it in their studies. Maybe, but if it is biases, it probably has the same biases year after year. For example both data sources could easily under-report minor fender binders that are never reported to the police.</p>
<p>But I have now found two independent sources of data that clearly show that since 1964 when sealtbelts were first required to be installed in new cars or since the early 1980s when state laws requiring sealtbelt use became widespread that the traffic accident rate has been falling. This data or evidence directly contradicts the Peltzman Efeect thesis that depends on rising accident rates.</p>
<p>So, for all the people who believe in the Peltman Effect and are teaching their students that seatbelts cause more deaths then they save I have two questions. One, why should I ignore this evidence that traffic accidents have been falling? Two, where is your evidence of more accidents.</p>
<p>If Peltzman is right, it should not be hard to find evidence of a sharp rise in accidents that the thesis implies, right?</p>
<p>So where is it?</p>
<p>P.S. I failed to point  out that the accident data is based on data collected by the insurance industry while the crash data is based on police reports to the Transportation Department.<br />So they really are independent data.</p>
<p>PPS.. Several people have raised he issue of demographics.  this Chart shows that in the mid-1960s when seatbelts were required to be installed in cars their should have been a big jump in deaths  due to young drivers.  But it barely happened &#8212; the jump in the early 1960s precedes seatbelt installation and should have continued into the mid-1960s to the late 1960s.  this data implies that seat belts actually prevented higher deaths in the 1960s due to baby boomers starting to drive &#8212; again jus the opposite of the Peltzman Effect.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/26/business/26supply.html?partner=rssnyt&#038;emc=rss">Louis Uchitelle</a> has yet another article on how John McCain has adopted the religion known as the Laugher (excuse me – Laffer) curve.  Louis starts well:</p>
<blockquote><p>Since then, supply-side economics, as it was called — first with derision but then as a label embraced by its supporters — has become a central tenet of Republican political and economic thinking. That’s despite the fact that the big supply-side tax cuts of the 1980s and the 2000s did not work out as advertised, as even most supporters acknowledge.</p></blockquote>
<p>But then he allows Kevin Hassett to get away with this:</p>
<blockquote><p>But advocates see broader economic benefits from lowering tax rates, which is one of the reasons the concept has reappeared as a point of contention in this year’s election campaign, in an amended form.  What really happens is that the economy grows more vigorously when you lower tax rates,” said Kevin Hassett, an adviser to the presumptive Republican nominee, John McCain, and the director for economic policy studies at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. “It is beyond the reach of economic science to explain precisely why that happens, but it does.”  Even with a growing economy, however, the promised boon in tax revenue never materialized. Arthur B. Laffer, the renowned proponent of supply-side economics, still holds that tax revenues “rise dramatically” when tax rates are cut.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m not sure what Louis means by “broader economic benefits” since Kevin claimed – without citing the evidence – that real GDP grows faster with lower tax rates than it does without higher tax rates.  It is beyond the reach of economic science to explain WHAT happens &#8211; Kevin?  Let’s recap something we’ve written here many times and most students of economics know already.  Real GDP, which had grown at an average rate of 3.5% per year from the end of World War II to 1980, grew by only 3 percent under Reagan-Bush41 and has grown by an average rate of 2.5% under Bush43.  Yet during the higher tax rate Clinton years, it grew by 3.7% per year.  Assuming Kevin Hassett is not a complete idiot (he’s not), he’s being very disingenuous here.  Ah but Louis does present some data for us:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the 1980s, though, during the initial era of supply-side tax cuts, per capita revenue from personal income taxes, adjusted for inflation, rose an average of just 0.7 percent annually throughout the Reagan presidency, according to the White House Office of Management and Budget.  That was far below what turned out to be an average annual increase of 6.5 percent in the eight years of the Clinton administration, when tax rates at the high end of the income ladder were raised. Since 2001, the annual per capita revenue from income taxes fell 1 percent under President Bush even though tax collections picked up sharply starting in 2005. The budget surplus Mr. Bush inherited turned into a deficit.</p></blockquote>
<p>There’s two reasons why tax revenues grew faster during the Clinton years – higher tax rates AND faster real GDP growth.  Alas – Louis fails to mention this second reason.  And until the press learns to call the supply-side liars on their lies, what is the incentive for them to tell us the truth?</p>

                                <p>Bruce Webb looks at the Trustee&#8217;s Report&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>One of my very first posts at my Social Security website was <a href="http://bruceweb.blogspot.com/2004/11/what-is-low-cost-alternative-what-does.html">What is the Low Cost Alternative</a> which I put up on November 20th, 2004. In it I made the observation that since 1997 Low Cost, purportedly the upper end of a possible range of economic outcomes, in fact always gave the same result: fully funded Social Security through the 75 year actuarial window with a steady reserve. It consistently returned what I call Baby Bear results, the porridge never being too hot or too cold. I discussed the implications of this in my 2006 Post <a href="http://bruceweb.blogspot.com/2006/01/goldilocks-and-three-social-security.html">Goldilocks and the Three Social Security Bears.</a> Well this held up excellently through the 2005, 2006, and 2007 Reports each of which gave the same basic Baby Bear outcome. Which made 2008 kind of a shock. For the first time the Trustees present a Low Cost model that would officially have Social Security over funded after mid century. Low Cost is outcome I in the following figure <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/II_project.html#112699l">Figure II.D6.—Long-Range OASDI Trust Fund Ratios Under Alternative Assumptions [Assets as a percentage of annual cost]</a> A constantly rising Trust Fund is a long range menace to Social Security, there is a point when having too much in reserve becomes a bad thing, something I expand on some in <a href="http://bruceweb.blogspot.com/2006/01/interest-on-interest-threat.html">Interest on Interest: a Threat</a>. There is only one way to flatten the tail after 2041 to get Social Security back to long term Baby Bear status. And that is some combination of cutting revenues or increasing future benefits. Which is to say exactly 180 degrees reversed from pretty much universal policy positions. To say the least, not at all the kind of crisis people are envisioning.</p>
<p>The policy implications are quite interesting. While of course Low Cost outcomes are not guaranteed, outcomes better than the standard Intermediate Cost model are more likely than not. People who insist that sooner is better than later may well have a point. If you delay those revenue cuts through reduction in FICA or diversion of interest into other asset classes for too long things spiral out of hand.</p>

                                <p>In the final analysis, the price of oil has nowhere to go but up. The easiest, most profitable extractions of this precious commodity have already been done. Gone are the days when a little drilling would release a gusher. Take, for example, the tar sands, our latest and perhaps most costly extraction, as I pointed out in a recent post, <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/03/frankel-and-rapier-rising-cost-of-oil.html">Frankel and Rapier</a>*.</p>
<p>Extracting bitumen will not be easy. In fact, as elsewhere, the easiest extraction may already have occurred. Eighty per cent of all tar sands bitumen lies too deep in the ground for open mining. The cost for deeper extraction may well exceed anything we might have expected, in terms of retrieval, water usage, and, of course, pollution.</p>
<p>Bitumen is truly messy stuff. Think of something akin to heavy molasses or soft tar. When it lies on the surface, you can push a finger into it. Walking on it, you may well leave a footprint. Bitumen has to be separated from the sands themselves. For each cubic meter of bitumen rescued, we have five cubic meters of toxic tailings. Already the tailing ponds are so vast that they can be seen from outer space. In <a href="http://www.reportonbusiness.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20080327.wrob-0408-liquidasset/BNStory/specialROBmagazine/home/?&#038;pageRequested=all&#038;print=true#">fact</a>,<br />
<blockquote>The Syncrude Tailings Dam is deemed by the U.S. Department of the Interior to be the world&#8217;s largest dam by volume of construction material. The pond, built in 1973, covers 22 square kilometres and holds 540 million cubic metres of water, crud and sand. When China completes the Three Gorges Dam this year, Syncrude will surrender the record.</p></blockquote>
<p>Nixen has mining operations south of Fort McMurray, the Long Lake project. A <a href="http://sec.edgar-online.com/2006/02/23/0000950142-06-000366/Section8.asp">report</a> from Nexin itself should give us pause:<br />
<blockquote>Our estimates for performance and recoverable volumes for the Long Lake project are based primarily on our three well-pair SAGD pilot and industry performance from SAGD operations in like reservoirs in the McMurray formation in the Athabasca oil sands. Using this data, our assumptions included average well-pair productivity of 900 bbls/d of bitumen and a steam-to-oil ratio of 2.5. In order to test operating parameters, we built a three well-pair SAGD pilot, commenced steaming the reservoir in May 2003 and commenced production in September 2003. The pilot is currently producing at a rate of about 400 barrels of bitumen per day per producing well-pair and an average steam-to-oil ratio of about 4.2. Since September 2003, the pilot has recovered less than 3% of the original bitumen in place. While we expect actual performance to improve as we commence commercial operations where SAGD drilling has confirmed higher quality reservoir conditions, there can be no assurance that our SAGD operation will produce bitumen at the expected levels or steam-to-oil ratio. We have addressed this risk by drilling additional wells and adding steam generating capacity to allow for a steam-to-oil ratio of 3.3, however, if the assumed production rates or steam-to-oil ratio are not achieved, we might have to drill additional wells to maintain optimal production levels, construct additional steam generating capacity and/or purchase natural gas for additional steam generation. These could have a significant adverse impact on the future activities and economic return of the Long Lake project. </p></blockquote>
<p>Initially, the steam-to-oil rato was to be 2.5: Two and half barrels of steam for every barrel of oil. Now it is 3.3 barrels of steam&#8230;and possibly rising. Steam requires energy; energy is a quantifiable cost. But energy costs in turn have there own costs.</p>
<p>In 2008, the Kyoto Protocol will come into effect in Canada. The Long Lake project does emit green house gases, possibly adding as much as $0.40 to each barrel of oil extracted.</p>
<p>But the real cost has yet to be fully assessed&#8211;and it might be staggering: Already there is substantial risk that ground water will become polluted. And those giant tailing ponds are not &#8220;settling&#8221; out as expected. Initially, everyone hoped that the tailings would settle into hard clay at the bottom of the ponds. Sorry. It isn&#8217;t happening.<br />
<blockquote>As the team leader on the subject at Natural Resources Canada&#8217;s CANMET Energy Technology Centre in Devon, Alberta, Mikula calls the tailings waste problem a &#8220;frightening&#8221; and vexatious issue. Engineers originally thought that the tailings waste would quickly settle, leaving clear water on top. But that never happened, thanks to what Mikula calls &#8220;the bad behaviour of clays.&#8221; He suspects the waste won&#8217;t settle to solid form for thousands of years. &#8220;So something has to be done.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>One suggestion has been to use giant centrifuges to separate out the tailings.<br />
<blockquote>A better solution might be a sort of &#8220;brute force&#8221; centrifugal approach, says Mikula. It involves spinning the material to create something dry and stackable that could eventually be reclaimed—while recovering water at the same time. Both Syncrude and Suncor have begun pilot projects. &#8220;We could reduce water usage from four barrels to two [per barrel of oil] or maybe less, which means less water withdrawn from the Athabasca,&#8221; says Mikula.</p></blockquote>
<p>That certainly will not be cheap. The cost of tar sands oil keeps rising.</p>
<p>And I have yet to mention that water is not exactly an abundant commodity in the McHenry region. Even without peak oil, the cost of oil just keeps rising&#8230;.</p>
<p>Flight to commodities? You have to be kidding if you think guys in back room betting parlors determine the cost of everything. I bet not one of them has visited a tailing pond.</p>
<p>*As one commentator observed, I inverted the conventional EROIE ratio in that post. An acronym describing my ratio should have been ERIOE. Nonetheless, all subsequent explanations hold true based on my use of the ratio.</p>

                                <p>Thinking back on periods when there&#8217;s been a major financial problem in this country, I&#8217;ve noticed something odd &#8211; they tend to happen when there&#8217;s a Republican President, and in particular, when there&#8217;s been a Republican President for at least four years, if not more.</p>
<p>The Great Depression, which often gets blamed on FDR, began under Hoover, who in turn followed fellow Republican Calvin Coolidge in the White House.  (FDR, conversely, oversaw the fastest real growth rates of any administration during the period of time for which the BEA NIPA tables provide data.)  Stagflation, though it often gets blamed on Carter, began in 1973 or 1974.  (During the Carter administration, real growth was faster than for any Republican President since 1929 except Ronald Reagan.)  In 1987, after most of Reagan&#8217;s term had gone by, we saw the S&#038;L scandal.  Now, we have this.</p>
<p>This was off the top of my head, and maybe I&#8217;m missing a meltdown or two (the does the dotcom crash qualify?) but I would guess that most of the big meltdowns we&#8217;ve seen in the past 100 years or so in this country have occurred when the White House had been in Republican hands for a while.  My guess as to the reason &#8211; lax regulation.</p>

<blockquote><p>Iraqi lawmakers traveled to the Iranian holy city of Qom over the weekend to win the support of the commander of Iran&#8217;s Qods brigades in persuading Shiite cleric Muqtada al Sadr to order his followers to stop military operations, members of the Iraqi parliament said &#8230; The backdrop to Sadr&#8217;s dramatic statement was a secret trip Friday by Iraqi lawmakers to Qom, Iran&#8217;s holy city and headquarters for the Iranian clergy who run the country. There the Iraqi lawmakers held talks with Brig. Gen. Qassem Suleimani, commander of the Qods (Jerusalem) brigades of Iran&#8217;s Revolutionary Guard Corps and signed an agreement with Sadr, which formed the basis of his statement Sunday, members of parliament said.  Ali al Adeeb, a member of Prime Minister Nouri al Maliki&#8217;s Dawa party, and Hadi al Ameri, the head of the Badr Organization, the military wing of the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq, had two aims, lawmakers said: to ask Sadr to stand down his militia and to ask Iranian officials to stop supplying weapons to Shiite militants in Iraq.  &#8220;The statement issued today by (Muqtada al Sadr) is a result of the meetings,&#8221; said Jalal al-Din al Saghir, a leading member of the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq. &#8220;The government didn&#8217;t have any disagreement with the Sadrists when it went to the city of Basra. The Sadrist movement is the one that chose to face the government.&#8221;  &#8220;We asked Iranian officials to help us persuade him that we were not cracking down on the Sadr group,&#8221; said an Iraqi official, who asked for anonymity due to the sensitivity of the subject.  He described the talks as successful but said hard-line Sadrists could goad the government into over-reacting and convince Sadr that the true aim of the Iraqi Security Forces is to destroy the Sadrists.  &#8220;I will not be surprised if the whole thing collapses,&#8221; he said.</p></blockquote>
<p>I see three takeaways from this news.  First, it was the government that blinked and not Sadr.  Secondly, the Iraqi government turned to Iran and not the US when it needed diplomatic help.  Lastly, there is no guarantee that the battle between the government and the Sadr forces is not over.  So tell me again – why do we leave US forces in the middle of this mess?</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://www.juancole.com/2008/03/iran-brokers-call-for-ceasefire-bush.html">Juan Cole</a> makes several observations as to this recent news but his title really captures the essence:</p>
