<p>In Response to Bryan Caplan et. al., Part 1  &#8211; An Empirical Look at the US Economy From the Perspective of Economic Schools of Thought</p>
<p>One charge that often comes up from libertarian and conservative economists is that there is no data to support the positions typically adopted by those can be said to subscribe, at least in broad strokes, to the general outline of the economy as described by Keynes.   As an example, Bryan Caplan wrote <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2010/10/the_keynesian_a.html#comments">this</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Keynesians have been a smug bunch from their earliest days.  Here&#8217;s how Keynes once replied to Hayek:</p>
<blockquote><p>Thus those who are sufficiently steeped in the old point of view simply cannot bring themselves to believe that I am asking them to step into a new pair of trousers, and will insist on regarding it as nothing but an embroidered version of the old pair which they have been wearing for years.</p></blockquote>
<p>But what is the source of Keynesians&#8217; self-confidence?  Every Keynesian I&#8217;ve ever known has a stock answer: <ital>The empirics are on our side.</ital>  But when probed, they rarely deliver any details about these empirics.  It&#8217;s been three decades since Keynesians could merely point at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phillips_curve">Phillips Curve</a> and say, &#8220;See?  See?!&#8221;  And in terms of merely &#8220;fitting the data points,&#8221; Prescott infamously showed that a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_business_cycle_theory">simple RBC model works rather well.</a></p></blockquote>
<p>At risk of getting sidetracked, a couple notes about the Phillips Curve and the RBC model.  The Phillips Curve, purportedly showing a trade-off between the inflation rate (of wages, at least) and unemployment was an erroneous idea glommed onto by many Keynesians because it provided an easy-to-explain way for government actions to improve the economy (i.e., when unemployment rose too much, the government could spend some money to push it down, but not too much less it spur inflation). </p>
<p>While its been a long time since I read Keynes, I don&#8217;t think he mentioned anything of this sort, being familiar with the German post-World War I experience and all that.  To say that the Phillips curve was is integral to Keynesian views because some prominent Keynesians used it as an excuse is to say that invading Iraq and cutting taxes are a part of the Southern Baptist theology.  As to the RBC model working rather well &#8211; it may be adequate for spotting things in the rearview mirror as they go by, but if it isn&#8217;t too deus ex machina to actually serve some purpose (say, anticipating events), someone please tell me what that might be.  </p>
<p>Given so many people, many of them thoroughly incompetent, built (to use the term loosely, in many instances) on the work that Keynes did, criticizing Keynes for the opinions of some of his lesser disciples makes as much sense as criticizing Hayek because of something that Glenn Beck said in last night&#8217;s broadcast. <br /><a name="more"></a><br />The basic Keynesian insight, and about the only thing that all the various flavors of Keynesian &#8220;thought&#8221; agree on, is that when the economy is in a recession, government spending can be tremendously helpful.  (By contrast, most libertarians and conservative economists are against most government spending, even during periods of economic weakness.)  Now, if you look at every recession since 1929, the first year for which there&#8217;s data from the National Income and Product Accounts tables, there aren&#8217;t many instances where the government cut spending during or just after a recession, but those instances have led to shorter, slower expansions, which can be summarized in this graph:</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TKkCnnVNeRI/AAAAAAAAAbI/7GLgMs272dI/s1600/keynes1.bmp"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TKkCnnVNeRI/AAAAAAAAAbI/7GLgMs272dI/s320/keynes1.bmp" border="0" alt=""></a>Figure 1</p>
<p>Notice that when it comes to overall growth during an economic expansion (i.e., length of expansion * speed of expansion), cutting spending produced worse outcomes than small increases in government spending, and large increases in government spending produced better results still.  (More info and a link to data sources <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=15">here</a>.)  That fits very well with Keynesian theory of all stripes.  On the other hand, it doesn&#8217;t fit with libertarian, Austrian, or conservative economic theory.</p>
<p>Another thing about Figure 1&#8230;  had you shown that graph to Keynes in the early 30s, he&#8217;d have had no trouble believing it.  Had you showed it to Hayek, be it in the Road to Serfdom era, or decades later, he wouldn&#8217;t have.  My bet is that most folks on Caplan&#8217;s side of the fence don&#8217;t that&#8217;s what happened, and have been happily theorizing based on a reality a 180 degrees different from what Figure 1 shows for a long, long time.</p>
<p>Now, let&#8217;s flip things a bit, and look at the most basic tenet of libertarian/conservative economic thought, namely that because of the profit motive, the private sector is relatively efficient compared to the public sector.  Note that a number of people who call themselves Keynesians believe this as well, at least under certain circumstances that have been observed in the not unrecent past.  An implication of this belief is that, all else being equal, jurisdictions that tax less will produce faster economic growth over a relatively long period of time.</p>
<p>I tested that not long ago, using data on the growth of real per capita income and the tax burden (from libertarian favorite, the Tax Foundation) for the fifty states plus the District of Columbia.   At times, some states are raising tax burdens, and others are lowering them &#8211; conservatives/libertarians would expect the former states to grow slower than the latter.   At other times, almost all states are lowering tax burdens, and in this case, conservatives/libertarians would expect the states that lowered tax burdens the most to produce the fastest growth rates.  Finally, in those periods where most states are raising the tax burdens on their citizens, conservatives/libertarians would expect the most from those states that raised their tax burdens by the least.  </p>
<p>Now, for every two year increment between 1977 and 2002, states were broken up into three equal sized-groups:  relatively high tax burden states, relatively low tax burden states, and medium burden states.  Growth rates were measured for each state for the subsequent six years, thus creating a series of rolling 8 year windows made up of a tax decision in years 1 and 2 and a growth rate in years 3 through 8.  (The eight year window was selected because most successful governors seem to serve two four year terms.)  Here is what the data shows:</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TKkCnwWh3PI/AAAAAAAAAbQ/BaYhf3cfKf0/s1600/keynes2.bmp"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TKkCnwWh3PI/AAAAAAAAAbQ/BaYhf3cfKf0/s320/keynes2.bmp" border="0" alt=""></a>Figure 2.</p>
<p>As I noted at the time:</p>
<blockquote><p>The table is interpreted as follows: the smallest tax cutters (i.e., those who cut taxes the least or raised them the most in any given year) produced the fastest economic growth about 42% of the time, second about 29% of the time, and third 29% of the time. By contrast, the middle group came in first in one third of all occasions. The &#8220;tax cuttingest&#8221; group came in first place a mere quarter of the time; in half of all years, it came in last place.</p>
<p>Many conclusions are reasonable from this. However, concluding that states that cut taxes have produced the fastest growth rate in per capita income is not one of them. </p></blockquote>
<p>(The full post, including links to the data sources <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?s=state+and+local&#038;x=0&#038;y=0">here</a>.)</p>
<p>We find something similar at the Federal level.  The following graph shows the growth rate in real GDP per capita for each President from 1929 (again, the first year for which data is available from the NIPA tables) to the present, color coded according to whether they increased or decreased tax burdens.  </p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TKkCn5iO-OI/AAAAAAAAAbY/bSco3lIT2Lg/s1600/keynes3.bmp"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TKkCn5iO-OI/AAAAAAAAAbY/bSco3lIT2Lg/s320/keynes3.bmp" border="0" alt=""></a>Figure 3</p>
<p>Clearly this is not the truth that you&#8217;ll hear from many on the conservative/libertarian side of the aisle.  Note that FDR is only shown until 1938 to sidestep the usual arguments from folks on the right who seem to believe that he did nothing right until World War 2; 1938 is sufficiently ahead of WW2 (i.e., even before lend-lease) that his performance cannot be influenced by WW2.  </p>
<p>(More info on that graph, plus data sources <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=50">here</a>.  Note that I also have an entire book reaching similar conclusions.  More info and a free download of chapter one <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/">here</a>.)  </p>
<p>Now, I&#8217;m just warming up, but this post is getting long, so I&#8217;ll save my best material for Part 2.  But this is enough to say, for now, that the basic assumption that underlies Keynesian thought is supported by the available data.  The basic assumption that underlies both conservative and libertarian economics is completely contradicted by simple graphs of the data.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m having my first ever book signing on Sunday, October 10, at the Border&#8217;s bookstore in North Canton, Ohio for <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/">Presimetrics</a>, the book I wrote with Michael Kanell.  If it goes well, I&#8217;ll look into doing signings at bigger cities as well.  As to the selection of the store &#8211; simply put, they were the first to ask!  A very enthusiastic friend of mine (thanks Marie!!!) ordered a few copies of the book for herself and a few other people, and while she was there to pick them up, she proudly (did I say she was enthusiastic about the book?) mentioned she knew the author.  </p>
<p>The rest, as they say, is history, or at least next Sunday early afternoon.  </p>
<p>The store&#8217;s info:<br />6751 Strip Avenue NW<br />North Canton, OH 44720<br />Phone: 330.494.4776</p>

<p>Mark Thoma linked to <a href="http://rjwaldmann.blogspot.com/2010/10/scott-sumner-on-what-keynes-wrote-about.html">a post at my personal blog </a>about the history of economic thought 101, what did Keynes write in &#8220;The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money.&#8221;  So I guess my next effort at humiliatingly elementary history of thought should be here.  After the jump.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>When contemporary economists speak of &#8220;involuntary unemployment&#8221; we mean that there are three agents, a worker, an unemployed person and an employer, that the unemployed person would be glad to work for a wage lower (perhaps slightly lower) than the one paid to the worker and the employer would be glad to employ the unemployed person at that lower wage (perhaps laying of the worker).  With this definition, involuntary unemployment can occur because labor unions force employers to pay a high wage even if there are people who would accept a lower wage.  This case is an example of the &#8220;Insider/outsider&#8221; model of involuntary unemployment.</p>
<p>Keynes meant something else. He would have called that unemployment voluntary because &#8220;labour as a whole&#8221; or the workers or the working class were unwilling to supply labour at a lower wage.  Not being Scott Sumner and not being willing to accuse Paul Krugman of intellectual dishonesty under the assumption that the links he puts in his posts ar purely decorative, I shall click <a href="http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/k/keynes/john_maynard/k44g/chapter2.html">Krugman&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/k/keynes/john_maynard/k44g/chapter2.html">link</a>.</p>
<p>Here Keynes is explaining what he calls &#8220;the classical theory.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>the fact that the population generally is seldom doing as much work as it would like to do on the basis of the current wage? For, admittedly, more labour would, as a rule, be forthcoming at the existing money-wage if it were demanded. The classical school reconcile this phenomenon with their second postulate by arguing that, while the demand for labour at the existing money-wage may be satisfied before everyone willing to work at this wage is employed, this situation is due to an open or tacit agreement amongst workers not to work for less, and that if <strong>labour as a whole</strong> would agree to a reduction of money-wages more employment would be forthcoming. If this is the case, such unemployment, though apparently involuntary, is not strictly so, and ought to be included under the above category of &#8216;voluntary&#8217; unemployment due to the effects of collective bargaining, etc.</p></blockquote>
<p>So to Keynes unemployment due to nominal wage rigidity and unemployment due to collective bargaining were &#8216;voluntary&#8217; unemployment.  The quotes are not scare quotes.  He is quoting other economists (principally Pigou) and he uses the word with that sense throughout The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money.</p>
<p>This means that self declared &#8220;New Keynesians&#8221; would be called &#8220;classicals&#8221; by Keynes.  </p>
<p>Keynes argued that there can be cases in which &#8220;labour as a whole&#8221; can&#8217;t obtain more employment by agreeing to a reduction of money-wages (what we call nominal wages). Basically he argues (assumes really) that firms will cut prices if workers accept lower wages (he definitely assumed flexible prices and basically pretty much assumed perfect competition in product markets).  So the immediate effect of the lower nominal wage would be the same real wage and a lower price level. The effect of this is equivalent to the effect of an increase in the money supply.  The increase of the money supply won&#8217;t cause increased employment if the economy is in a liquidity trap.</p>
<p>So far Keynes has presented a general theory which really isn&#8217;t all that much more general.  He would just say that the arguments which he called classical require the qualifier &#8220;so long as the economy isn&#8217;t in a liquidity trap, that is so long as safe short term interest rates aren&#8217;t essentially zero&#8221; and then consider the other case.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t the end of the story.  For one thing, if a small open economy is on the gold standard, the money supply can automatically shrink when the price level falls so the real money supply stays the same (oddly exactly this point was very much stressed by Sumner once).  For another, even without a gold standard a central bank which targets nominal interest rates will respond to the reduction of the price level by reducing the money supply. This can imply that downward wage flexibility causes reduced employment as it causes deflation which means that the constant nominal interest rate corresponds to a higher real interest rate and lower investment for given GDP growth.</p>
<p>However, it shows reckless disregard for the truth to claim that what Keynes wrote about the classicals was dishonest, because those classicals were essentially New Keynesians.  It is equally reckless <a href="http://www.themoneyillusion.com/?p=7279">to say</a> that what Krugman wrote &#8220;the other side in this debate generally adheres, more or less, to something like what Keynes called the “<a href="http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/k/keynes/john_maynard/k44g/chapter2.html">classical theory</a>” of employment, in which employment and output are basically determined by the supply side. &#8221; is dishonest.  </p>
<p>He specified that he meant <strong>what Keynes called </strong>&#8220;the classical theory&#8221; making it clear to anyone with normal linguistic skills (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gricean_maxims">including Gricean maxims</a>) that other people use the phrase with another meaning.  And that  and gave a link which no one could be expected to actually click since Krugman has only occasionally stressed that the links are not decorative (indeed maybe only <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/09/click-the-links/">once</a>).</p>
<p>Now everyone is sloppy sometimes.  But Sumner was reckless and sloppy when accusing others of intellectual integrity and has earned some quiet time.</p>

<p>“This summer, executives from the New York-based private equity firm SK Capital traveled to Houston to celebrate the first anniversary of their acquisition of a nylon manufacturing business. Soon they will have a bigger reason to uncork the Champagne. The nylon manufacturer has announced plans to issue about $1 billion in debt, of which $922 million will be used to pay a dividend to SK. For SK, which paid $50 million in cash for the business, that is an astonishing almost 18-fold return in a little more than a year.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The entire blogsphere seems to be fascinated by the idea that maybe the IRS could mail tax payers a receipt showing where their taxes go.  Oddly the IRS just decided to stop mailing something &#8212; 1040 booklets.  Which, you guessed it, explain where your tax money goes. </p>
<p>This has been mailed to every household every year for decades.  So why are tax receipts a new idea ?</p>

<p>Now it&#8217;s not perfect.  The IRS doesn&#8217;t like tiny slices so they put medicaid and welfare together as &#8220;social programs&#8221; (welfare might mean tanf plus food stamps plus suplementary security income) and put foreign aid in with defence.  People would have to read the footnotes.  An actual policy is never as pleasing to people as one they can design but it can be as good as the one which will come out of the sausage factory.</p>
<p>I am old enough to have filled out tax forms on paper.  Nothing encourages casual skimming and looking at the illustrations more. I  have spent much time staring at these pie charts while trying to force myself to look through my &#8220;records.&#8221;</p>
<p>No one seems to know about the pie charts <a href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i1040.pdf">(which are still there in the 1040 instructions on page 101 (warning huge boring pdf)).</a></p>
<p>Like Tim Geithner (see page 170) I am tempted to blame turbotax.</p>
<p>A receipt in the mail will do no good.  The only solution is to require tax preparation programs to display the data and tax prepareration firms to show it to people before they sign the forms.  Of course forcing people to look at something really is illiberal.  Nothing less will force US taxpayers to learn where the money goes.  They don&#8217;t know, because they don&#8217;t want to know.</p>

                                <p>Despite the point that the first data reported in the monthly personal income report is nominal personal income, it does not get much attention in the press and by bloggers.  We<br />are starting to see a rebound in nominal personal income growth even though it is still quite low by historic norms. The current smoothed growth rate is 2.8% and the earlier signs that growth is accelerating have faded.  This is why it is important to monitor the growth in weekly average earnings in the employment report.</p>
<p>The way to look at nominal income growth is that it is a necessary condition but not a sufficient condition for economic growth to become self-sustaining.  Moreover, this cycle, for the first time in the post WW II era nominal growth must be sufficient to accommodate both inflation and rising personal savings before real income growth can strengthen.  In previous cycles rising personal savings was not a major factor dampening growth and/or creating a wedge between nominal income growth and real personal spending..</p>

As the chart below shows,  personal income growth is an important leading-concurrent indicator of fed policy.  Rising personal income growth implies that the fed would not need to continue pumping additional liquidity into the system<br />and call into question the need for QE 2 that the consensus now seems to be expecting and<br />the stock market appears to be discounting.</p>

It actually has a stronger correlation with the market PE than bond yields. Moreover, it is even better at forecasting the market PE three months into the future than it is at explaining the current PE.</p>

                                <p>by Dan Crawford</p>
<p>There has been a little ruckus from the WSJ reporting on <em><strong>McDonald&#8217;s health insurance plans and applications for waivers from the 80% medical loss ratio requirement</strong></em>.  Try to use that for a headline.</p>
<p>The medical loss ratio at 80% was one measure for evaluating whether enough % dollars of premium was actually going to medical expenses as opposed to salaries, advertising and marketing, and other non-medical expenses.  I believe mini-med policies are far removed from plans offered that people associate with the term &#8216;health plan&#8217;.  </p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idAFN2927184220100930?rpc=44">Reuters</a> reports:<br />
<blockquote>McDonald&#8217;s had about 14,000 U.S. restaurants in 2009. Most of the company&#8217;s franchisees offer a limited-benefit plan and nearly 30,000 employees have chosen to be covered by the &#8220;mini-med&#8221; policies, Russell said.</p>
<p>Employees pay around $14 per week for a plan capping annual benefits at $2,000 per year, or a similar plan in which they pay $32 per week and annual benefits are capped at $10,000, according to the Wall Street Journal report.</p>
<p>Restaurants and retailers are more likely to offer such bare-boned plans because they have a high percentage of part-time and temporary workers and higher employee turnover than private sector employers overall.</p>
<p>The total market for limited benefit plans is about 1.4 million people, with Aetna Inc (AET.N) and Cigna Corp (CI.N) among the health insurers with the biggest presence, Wells Fargo analyst Peter Costa said in a research note.</p>
<p>Aetna&#8217;s largest limited benefit customer is retailer Home Depot Inc (HD.N) with 24,000 of those members, said Costa, adding that limited benefit plans account for a small portion of the overall health insurance market.</p></blockquote>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />Another item that popped up is that <a target="_blank" href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/">Principlal Financial Group Inc.</a> is a coincidental withdrawing from the medical insurance business, claiming inablity to see enough profit in the coverage it provides due to a vague &#8216;less profitablility&#8217;.  However per their announcement:</p>
<blockquote><p>CHANGING COVERAGE: Principal Financial Group Inc. will stop selling health insurance, and customers, as policies come up for renewal, will transfer to UnitedHealthcare. The phase-out of all policies is expected to take about three years.</p>
<p>WHY LEAVE BUSINESS: Principal has seen its asset management and 401(k) retirement businesses grow and become more profitable while its health insurance segment has shrunk, requiring more investment to remain competitive.</p></blockquote>
<p>And per United Healthcare:</p>
<blockquote><p>UnitedHealthcare today announced it has entered into an agreement to renew medical insurance coverage for The Principal Financial Group’s (The Principal®) medical plan customers as The Principal completes its plans to exit the medical insurance business. The Principal will continue to offer life insurance, dental, disability, vision and wellness programs. </p>
<p>The Principal selected UnitedHealthcare to provide an easy and attractive transition option for its customers to renew their health plans. The Principal currently covers customers in 31 markets nationwide, predominantly throughout the Central United States, where UnitedHealthcare offers an extensive network of physicians, hospitals and other health care providers. </p></blockquote>
