                                <p>I haven&#8217;t gotten a response from Katherine Jean Lopez about why the NRO doesn&#8217;t mind printing erroneous economic information.  I doubt I will.  And if you haven&#8217;t checked out <a href="http://confederateyankee.mu.nu/archives/248661.php">the results of my asking the question</a> at a right-wing blog whose readers were indignant about the NRO getting details wrong about some Hezbullah doings in Lebanon &#8211; a rather trivial issue for most of us, I imagine &#8211; its worth a look.  But meanwhile, here&#8217;s a <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=YTZjMDc4N2E3YmUyZTdlNTJiZDA5YWQ1NDc0MDc4Y2M=">Kudlow</a> piece in at the NRO explaining why there might be a slowdown in the economy:</p>
<blockquote><p>Yes, economic growth may indeed pause to roughly 2 percent in the next couple of quarters, the result of two years of overly tight money from the Federal Reserve and the ensuing upturn in sub-prime defaults and foreclosures.</p></blockquote>
<p>Overly tight money from the Fed&#8230;  Let&#8217;s look at that for a moment.  We can get the <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h15/data/Annual/H15_FF_O.txt">annual Federal funds effective rate</a>, subtract off <a href="ftp://ftp.bls.gov/pub/special.requests/cpi/cpiai.txt">annual inflation rate</a> (i.e., the percentage change in the CPI &#8211; U) between that year and the next, and we get the real annual Federal funds effective rate.  (In other words&#8230;.  the real annual Federal funds effective rate for 1980 is equal to the nominal annual Federal funds effective rate less the inflation between 1980 and 1981.)  Since the CPI &#8211; U is not yet available for December of 2007, we can estimate the 2007 inflation using the percentage change between the average CPI &#8211; U for the first 11 months of 2006 and the first 11 months of 2007.  </p>
<p>The Fed data is available going back to 1955&#8230; here&#8217;s a graph of what it looks like:</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/R2UoHvy-qhI/AAAAAAAAA6A/RZ9-aoXAToI/s1600-h/real+fed+funds+effective+rate.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/R2UoHvy-qhI/AAAAAAAAA6A/RZ9-aoXAToI/s320/real+fed+funds+effective+rate.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Now, looking at that graph, you might already be thinking&#8230; the money supply in 2006 didn&#8217;t look all that tight, at least relative to non-recession and non-stagflation periods in the past 30 years.  But we can be more precise&#8230; here&#8217;s a table showing the real annual Federal funds effective rate for each year of the GW administration so far.  </p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/R2UqGfy-qiI/AAAAAAAAA6I/BUkGoGTQwFs/s1600-h/real+fed+funds+effective+rate+-+table.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/R2UqGfy-qiI/AAAAAAAAA6I/BUkGoGTQwFs/s320/real+fed+funds+effective+rate+-+table.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Obviously, we don&#8217;t know what the real annual Federal funds effective rate will be for 2007 &#8211; though perhaps Kudlow does.  But its easy to show that over 41% of all years between 1955 and 2000 have had tighter real money than 2006 &#8211; that may not be loose money, but it isn&#8217;t tight by any historical standards.  And besides, money is supposed to be &#8220;loose&#8221; or &#8220;tight&#8221; according to current economic conditions.  Aren&#8217;t guys like Kudlow always telling us that in the last few years, the economic has been booming?  </p>
<p>As an aside, we also know the rate was higher in five of eight years during the Clinton administration&#8230; would Kudlow would say the Fed was choking off growth then?</p>
<p>FWIW, I would characterize Kudlow&#8217;s statement as misleading.  Which presumably makes it a fine statement to Katherine Jean Lopez.  I was planning to look at the second half of Kudlow&#8217;s excuse &#8211; about how the the &#8220;upturn in sub-prime defaults and foreclosures&#8221; happens to be &#8220;ensuing&#8221; from this overly tight money &#8211; but I have things to do.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/16/weekinreview/16revkin.html?_r=1&#038;oref=slogin">As China Goes, So Goes Global Warming</a>, an article in today&#8217;s NYT, raises some important issues. China, as the article points out, is only following the tried and true method: Rapid industrialization at all costs, a path developed nations took in the 20th century:<br />
<blockquote>The established superpower arose riding a wave of fossil-fueled prosperity. The emerging one, [China] sitting on a wealth of coal, sees few reasons not to follow suit; after all, it has only just caught its wave with India and others in hot pursuit.</p></blockquote>
<p>At this point it is important to understand what &#8220;following suit&#8221; means. It is more than just &#8220;getting theirs.&#8221; It involves a path and mode of development. (I have no quarrel with the desire or the ends, just with the means and methods.)</p>
<p>Walter Rostow, a staunch anti-communist and economic advisor to Lyndon Johnson, provided the underpinning for China&#8217;s present theorists on the necessary stages of economic growth, of the movement from an agrarian to an industrial society. (For an overview of China and Rostow, see <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/04/china-now-to-2100.html">here.)</a></p>
<p>Olliver Mallick offers an interesting explanation of Rostow&#8217;s <i>The Five Stages of Economic Growth: A non-communist manifesto</i> in his <a href="http://www.basu-mallick.de/projekte/Oliver_Basu_Mallick_2005_Rostow_and_Globalization.pdf">A Development Theory Rostow&#8217;s Five Stage Model of Development and Ist [sic] Relevance in Globalization</a><br />
<blockquote>Therefore, western countries recommend modernization as the imitation of the western experience, which they believe, would produce successful societies in the current developing countries.</p></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>Globalization implies a process of intensification of worldwide economic as well as cultural and social relations. It is an integration of markets, business sectors and production systems which are the results of powerful protagonists. These participants are transnational companies and, in some cases, nation states.</p></blockquote>
<p>But, as Mallick points out, there is opposition to globalization at the &#8216;grassroots&#8217; level,<br />
<blockquote>paying attention to marginalized topics [that focus] on gender, nutrition, human rights and especially environment.</p></blockquote>
<p>Mallick&#8217;s idea of environmental protest is Green Peace, which, he ironically points out, makes use of tools modernization&#8211;and therefore globalization&#8211;made possible, i.e., mass communication.<br />
<blockquote>Apart from that, resistance is constructed as the opposite of &#8216;big is beautiful project and so against the establishment. In other words, these forms of resistance [such as Green Peace] are &#8216;non-capitalistic.&#8217;</p></blockquote>
<p>Now, while I find Mallick&#8217;s description interesting, think back to the NYT&#8217;s article.</p>
<p>In building one coal burning plant every week to feed its voracious energy needs China already has become the number emitter of CO2, surpassing the U.S. It is no accident that the U.S. and China have resisted efforts to address global warming. Both benefit locally for their power consummation. Morever, our multinationals are China&#8217;s export platform.</p>
<p>Like or not, the present cost of cheap goods and the present mode of globalization are intimately connected to global warming.</p>
<p>The question is: Will the West put the necessary funds into alternate energy and share that knowledge with developing nations? &#8220;Sharing&#8221; here means really sharing; not just making it expensive. No more games.<br />
<blockquote>BinBin Jiang, a research associate in energy and development at Stanford University sees similar opportunities in creating an efficient infrastructure for China’s exploding midsize cities. &#8220;That’s where you determine if you are going to leapfrog or go along the old Western path,&#8221; she said. </p></blockquote>
<p>China has to be persuaded to abandon the old Western path, the one praised by economists from the left and the right. The only way to do that may well be to set aside the old capitalistic and nationalistic notions of Darwinian competition, join forces against the rampant pollution and warming that threatens all of us.</p>

                                <p>If you read the comments to blog posts here at Angry Bear (and I have no problems admitting that many of the comments are better and more incisive than the posts I write) you know in the past few months we&#8217;ve been assigned (by who?) a particularly tenacious cheerleader who simply will not admit anything that makes GW or the Republican cause look bad, no matter what the evidence shows.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve had a range of excuses for the subpar economic performance of our current esteemed President, from &#8220;the data doesn&#8217;t show that&#8221; to &#8220;same point in the business cycle&#8221; but the latest excuse is particularly interesting:  one cannot evaluate a President&#8217;s policies until those policies have been &#8220;fully implemented.&#8221;</p>
<p>Which makes me wonder&#8230;</p>
<p>In 1988, Reagan&#8217;s last year in office, the highest marginal tax rate was cut from 38.5% to 28%.  It stayed there until 1990.  Should we evaluate the effect of Reagan&#8217;s tax policy simply by looking at the economic growth rate from 1988 to 1990?  (In 1988, real GDP per capita in 2000 dollars was $27,514, and in 1990 it was $28,429, giving us an annualized growth rate of 1.65% a year.)  </p>
<p>Which leads to the reason I use the approach I use when evaluating Presidents (i.e., except in rare cases where the data does not permit, go from the period before the President took office to the last full period the President left office).  Picking and choosing a methodology that makes one of one&#8217;s favorite Presidents look good invariably makes another of one&#8217;s favorite Presidents look bad.  And frankly, I don&#8217;t care about President X or Y or Z.  They&#8217;re not friends or family members of mine.  I&#8217;m not getting paid by them, and I don&#8217;t think its likely I will ever be offered a job by any past, present, or future President or aspirant nor do I expect to be hired (or not hired) by any other person who makes his/her decisions based largely on my support or non-support of one or another President or party.  It can happen, but its unlikely.  </p>
<p>So I want to know what works and what doesn&#8217;t. I used to consider myself a Republican.  After spending years going through data, I now believe Republican policies, in general, are more inane than Democratic policies.  So I don&#8217;t generally support Republican policies or those who will carry them out.  But the day their policies seem to me to be the least inane among the alternatives that have a chance of being carried out, I will turn around and support them. </p>
<p>But no President or Presidential aspirant cares about me personally, positively or negatively, and similarly, I don&#8217;t care about them personally, even if the TV and the internet and the newspaper bring them into my home on a daily basis.  If the rest of us are lucky, they care about all of their constituents and potential constituents.  If the rest of us are really lucky, they even have helpful policies.  And that is how we should evaluate our Presidents:  do they make things better, or do they make things worse.   Sure, each of them faces a unique series of events and conditions, but being President is a privilege.  We, the American people, should get something other than excuses in exchange for that privilege.  And maybe if we watch them carefully, if we don&#8217;t accept their excuses, or worse, make their excuses for them, we reduce the likelihood that in the future excuses will be all we get.</p>

<p>Update&#8230;  Last paragraph modified.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>Update 2&#8230; Why weren&#8217;t GW&#8217;s policies &#8220;fully implemented&#8221; in 2001 or 2002?  Was someone else President in 2001 or 2002 who either chose to backload the tax cuts or was unable to push the full tax cuts through a compliant Congress in 2001?  Does GW get a pass for things he either chose not to do or was unable to do?  Does this apply to other Presidents or in other situations?  If a marathon runner decides to run very slowly at times to conserve his strength or because he is tired, do we only evaluate him on his speed when he is running all out?  The more I think about it, the sillier this &#8220;fully implemented&#8221; excuse seems to me.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://time-blog.com/curious_capitalist/2007/12/continuing_with_the_shameless.html">Justin Fox</a> mocks one of his supply-side <a href="http://time-blog.com/curious_capitalist/2007/12/new_column_arthur_laffer_on_th_1.html#comments">trolls</a> before his turns on the ever stupid <a href="http://www.opinionjournal.com/extra/?id=110006842">Stephen Moore</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you take the very simple step of adjusting for inflation, you&#8217;ll find that real federal revenues were lower in 1984 than in 1982, and lower in 2004 than in 2002. So alex&#8217;s claim #3 is, on its face, false. But that&#8217;s not really the issue: Eventually, tax revenues did come to surpass their 1982 and 2002 levels in real terms. Which proves absolutely nothing about the efficacy of tax cuts. The U.S. economy has a tendency to grow, whether or not Congress is cutting taxes. And over time, that tendency will produce higher government revenues, whether or not Congress is cutting taxes.  Now I&#8217;d like to believe that well-designed tax cuts can make the economy grow faster. But would any non-charlatan want to argue that all of the economic growth post-1982 and post-2002 was tax-cut-induced?</p></blockquote>
<p>Justin provides a lot more wisdom but it’s time to visit <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2007/12/is-stephen-moor.html">Mark Thoma</a> who has been reviewing what Rudy Giuliani and Michael Boskin have been saying.  Mark turns to the coverage of <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1207/7257.html">Avi Zenilman</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Giuliani consistently echoes President Bush’s assertion in February 2006: “You cut taxes and the tax revenues increase.” But there’s a growing sentiment among many conservative economists &#8211; including those who generally support cutting taxes to spur economic growth and job creation &#8211; that Giuliani’s statements are simplistic and at worst misleading &#8230; Michael Boskin, a Giuliani economic adviser and Stanford professor who chaired the President’s Council of Economic Advisers under George H.W. Bush, said that the mayor’s claims about revenue and taxes need to be considered in a broader context. “The mayor has been very clear that he has an aggressive plan to work on both sides of the fiscal equation &#8211; both controlling spending and reducing and reforming taxes. All of the elements of the program are designed to reinforce each other and help the economy grow,” he said. </p></blockquote>
<p>Mark reacts:</p>
<blockquote><p>I need to break in &#8211; that&#8217;s trying to have it both ways. He&#8217;s not really lying because he really means you should cut programs too? Of course cutting programs increases revenues (though, like Laffer, I can think of counterexamples at the extremes where that isn&#8217;t true), but that&#8217;s not the issue and not what Giuliani is claiming.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here is what I don’t understand.  Michael Boskin is a very sensible fellow who has – like most sensible conservative economists – trashed the free lunch Laffer curve garbage.  So why is Michael Boskin working for the Giuliani campaign?  Then again – why is Greg Mankiw advising Mitt Romney who is also touting this Laffer dishonesty?</p>

                            </p>
                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>A few days ago I commented on an article about how Wal-Mart provides emergency supplies to disaster areas at their regular everyday low prices.  I pointed out that libertarians like those at Café Hayek should note these developments and see that some guy in the back of a pick-up truck selling supplies at high prices was not the only way to provide disaster victims additional supplies.</p>
</p>
<p>Russ Roberts took exception to what I said and we went though a long discussion of it over at his blog.  He started out claiming that Wal-Mart had to face higher costs because of the higher cost of carrying inventories.  He finally conceded that my explanation of how Wal-Mart had revolutionized inventory management and that when you looked at how the computer revolution had altered the way big-box retailers managed inventories that I was right in arguing that  the cost of inventory management did not mean that Wal-Mart had to charge higher prices.</p>
<p>http://cafehayek.typepad.com/hayek/</p>
<p>But he was still unwilling to concede that Wal-Mart did not have to raise prices, claiming that  this is what theory shows and we have a long history of the world working this way.</p>
</p>
<p>I think the difference stems from the way academic economist view supply curves. They look at supply – demand diagrams and see supply curves as continuous curves rising from the lower left  to the upper right of the diagram.  It is a beautiful theory and is a great tool for explaining to students how the system works in the long run, especially when suppliers have to create new capacity to increase supply.  Moreover, continuous curves are required to do the advance math modern academic economist do. So someone seeped in this methodology obviously and correctly believes that higher prices are needed to attract additional supply.  If this is always true the guy in his pick up truck charging storm victims very high prices is doing a good thing.</p>
</p>
<p>But in the real world in the short to intermediate run supply curve are not always continuous curves sloping from the lower left to the upper right – especially in the short run.   In the short run most industries do not operate a full capacity and do not have to bring new capacity on line to increase supply – they normally have excess capacity.</p>
<p>Because of this most businesses in the <country-region st="on"><place st="on">US</place></country-region> economy typically operate on some form of posted price approach.  For example if you want to buy a pizza you call the pizza shop and they tell you the price of a pizza is $10.  Moreover, the price will be $10 per pizza if you want to buy one pizza or ten pizzas or anything in between .  Over this portion of the supply curve it is flat,  it is not a continuous curve with an upward slope.  If you said to the pizza owner next Wednesday I am having a kids party and want 20 pizzas delivered at three in the afternoon, what kind of a discount would you give me.  The owner would think, at that time most of my ovens are sitting unused and my employees are idle.  So sure, I’ll give you a discount and sell you 20 pizzas at $8 each. Just don’t try this for the pizzas to be delivered at half-time of the Super Bowl.  Actually, if might even work then because Super Bowl Sunday is one of the worse days of the year for restaurants.  But anyway, what we have here is a supply curve that actually slopes downward over portions of the curve.</p>
</p>
<p>Think of the typical small retailer. They look at the catalog   or price list the vendor provides and finds that if they want one or two cases of something the price is set at one level.  But normally, if they buys 20 or thirty cases they will get a volume discount. So again, we typically have a supply curve that over certain portions of the curve actually slopes downward. It is not a continuous curve with a constant upward slope.</p>
</p>
<p>Imagine you are the regional manager for Wal-Mart and as you do your planning you estimate that next year you should sell 1,000 crates of six-ounce bottled water each week. So you go to the manufacturer and negotiate a contract. But you do not negotiate a contract to buy 1,000 bottles a week.  What you do is negotiate a contract with minimum and maximums. You commit to buying at least 800 bottles per week and up to potentially 1,200 bottles per week at the agreed on price.   The contract provides a great deal of detail about exact specifications and how the contract can be changed.  But it will also call on Wal-Mart to tell the bottler each Tuesday how many bottles from 800 to 1,200 they  want next week and calls for them to ship about 20% of the order each day from Monday to Friday. The manufacturer now has several days to arrange his supplies and production schedule.  Wal-Mart is not the vendors only customer and typically Wal-Mart will buy from multiple  vendors. So it is a good deal for both.  But it means that between a volume of 800 to 1,200 bottles a week Wal-Mart faces a flat supply curve.  It is not upward sloping.</p>
</p>
<p>If you are a academic economist and long accustomed to thinking about supply curves having a continuous upward slope and you see that a natural disaster creates a temporary surge in the demand for bottled water at some location it is perfectly natural to apply your theory and believe that it will take higher prices to attract the additional supply. The big retail chains like Wal-Mart, Home Depot, 7-11, CVS Drug, etc,  sell several hundred thousand bottles of water around the country every day and they each have contracts similar to the one Wal-Mart has with bottled water manufacturers .  Compared to this total national supply the few thousand bottles needed at a natural disaster site is insignificant.  And the amount the proverbial guy in the pick-up truck could supply is infinitesimal . It is very easy for big-box retailers  to redirect a small portion of their supply and remain well within their existing  contracts where they face a flat supply curve.</p>
</p>
<p>When you look at the world like this and realize that supply curves can be flat or actually downward sloping over certain portions of the curve it is very easy to understand why  and how modern retailers can quickly increase supplies to a disaster area at regular every day low prices. This does not mean there is anything wrong with the economic theory.  It is a good first approximation of how the world works.  In the next year if Wal-Mart wanted to sell 1,500 six ounce bottles of water rather then 1,000 bottles the theory based on an continuously upward sloping supply curves should work very well.  </p>
<p>Well, maybe not.  Ever year since 1992, retailers like Wal-Mart, Home Depot, etc, have actually experienced deflation. The deflator for GAO type products – think department store products or roughly what Wal-Mart sells – has been falling at a 2% to 3% annual rate every year since 1992 . So actually, there is a very good chance that the per bottle price for 1,500 bottles of water may be cheaper next year.  So even the long run supply curve may be downward sloping.</p>
</p>
<p>So what evidence do I have that this is the way the world works?  Experience is the best evidence I have.  But there is also a body of research that finds that most firms tend to change prices only once a year.  Firms  do work on a posted and/or contract price approach and find that in a low inflation world it does not pay to frequently change prices. Most firms have the flexibility built into their systems to moderately change their supplies in the short to intermediate run without changing prices. In the short run the overwhelming bulk of the items sold and the vast majority of  firms in the <country-region st="on"><place st="on">US</place></country-region> economy face a flat supply curve. This is not inconsistent with economic theory. Upward sloping supply curves are a long run phenomenon, not a short run phenomenon.</p>
</p>
<p>So I will stick with my argument that modern retail chains like Wal-Mart can and do quickly and easily provide extra supplies to disaster areas at regular every day low prices. Consequently, the proverbial guy in his pick-up truck charging the victims higher prices is not doing them a favor.  Academics teaching this to college undergraduates are teaching both bad economics and bad morality.</p></p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p><a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/12/whats-wrong-with-this-expansion.html">Cactus</a> rightfully mocks <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=ZDM4ZDUxYzQzODcyMjFjZWEyZWE0MzM2ZmY0OGI0YTU=">Greg Kaza</a>.  Kaza is all elated that real GDP growth has been positive for 24 quarters now and notes employment has been growing for 51 months.  You know – if you go to any marathon, you’ll notice that the elite runners typically run for less than three hours while some people keep on trucking for about twice that long  But all finishers travel the 26.2 mile distance and the winners are the ones who travel the course the fastest.  </p>
<p>As Joe Friday used to say: “just the facts, ma’am”.  Real GDP in 2007Q3 was 18.1% higher than it was in 2001Q3, which represents an incredibly anemic 2.8% per annum growth rate.  Employment over the past seven years has grown by 6.141 million according to the payroll survey – which translates into a 73 thousand per month increase.  Kaza touts last month’s 94 thousand increase as great news.  But of course, employment has been growing at a slower rate than the adult population.  </p>
<p>If such obvious matters were not enough to sit back and mock how incredibly stupid the latest rant from the National Review was, sample a couple of more sentences:</p>
<blockquote><p>According to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, this robustness was tied to accelerations in personal consumption and exports … The Bush tax cuts, it turns out, did not wreck the U.S. economy as the partisans predicted time and again.</p></blockquote>
<p>Excuse me – but Kaza forgot to name the “partisans” who supposedly predicted that the 2001 tax cut would wreck the U.S. economy and for good reason – no one was saying that back in 2001.  What the critics did say was that the tax cuts would lower national savings and crowd-out investment and/or net exports.  While the tax cuts did appear to increase the ratio of consumption to GDP from 69% as of 2000Q4 to 70% as of 2007Q3, government purchases increased from around 17.5% of GDP in 2000 to almost 19.5% of GDP as of 2007Q3.  And yet, Kaza has the audacity to approve of George W. Bush’s claim “The best way to get this economy growing is to let you have more of your own money”.  And yes, the drop in national savings from more private consumption and more government purchases has translated into a larger trade deficit as the share of GDP going to exports has not increased nearly as much as the share of GDP going to imports.  In the meantime, the share of GDP going to investment has declined from 17.5% as of 2000Q4 to 15.5% as of 2007Q3.  The tax cuts of George W. Bush – like the 1981 tax cuts – have led to less investment, which will translate into less long-term growth.  </p>
<p>I could ask whether Greg Kaza is really this incredibly stupid to write such pathetic nonsense.  I could ask whether Rich Lowry and Jonah Goldberg are also this incredibly stupid to publish such pathetic nonsense.  But we’ve seen this crap played out over and over again at the National Review and we’ve seen countless takedowns of their incessant stupidity.  No – these fellows are not that stupid.  But they assume their readers are.  After all – those who write for the National Review look upon their readers as stupid little children who deserve to be lied to.  One has to wonder who on earth would <em>anyone</em> bother to pay for this garbage?</p>
<p><strong><em>Follow-up</em></strong>: Why does these Bush cheerleaders refuse to debate with even the least bit of integrity?  We decided to present the facts within the 7-year time frame used by NRO’s Greg Kaza and just look at the absurd comments we got from the likes of Bush cheerleader Formerly Anonymous.  He seems to think the correct time frame was the period from mid-2003 to today on some absurd notion that the Bush tax cuts were not completed until 2003.  This sort of reminds me of the excuses the Reagan cheerleaders made back in the mid-1980’s.  We got a tax cut in 1981 on the heals of the (anemic) 1980-81 “recovery” that Reagan inherited from Carter – but of course after the Carter recession.  And then we got a whopper of a recession from the end of 1981 to the end of end of 1982.  The Reagan cheerleaders touted the post 1983 period as the Reagan miracle even though all this did was to reverse the Reagan recession.  But somehow the 1982 mess was not Reagan’s fault.  </p>
<p>OK, real GDP growth since mid-2003 has been just over 3% but that’s still pathetic given how far we were from full employment as of mid-2003.  We could have taken this back the full seven years that Kaza suggested in his title and noted that real GDP growth has averaged less than 2.5%.  Ah but you say – Bush43 sort of walked into the White House just as a recession was about to start whereas Bush41 left Clinton an economy that was growing.  Well – that’s the criteria some other rightwing Bush43 cheerleader uses.  So let’s see, the boom during the 1990’s lasted 10 years therefore and this “boom” has lasted only six.  But let’s not get too carried away as the Bush41 “boom” had anemic growth rates just as the Bush43 “boom” has witnessed.  </p>
<p>But never mind all of that as the mission of the Bush cheerleaders is to drum up as many stupid pieces of “analysis” they can without regard to the fact that their ever changing criteria often contradict each other.  After all – those of us who wish to put these issues into some meaningful context are nothing but a bunch of partisans at best and likely Marxists at worse.  Of course, it’s funny that the TV where I’m staying has no MSNBC channel and zero volume for CNN (optimal way to watch Lou Dobbs and Larry King!) so I’m stuck with Faux News.  Maybe soon I’ll become another Sean Hannity style patriotic American who is just as stupid as the rightwing hacks who have decided to infest our comment box!</p>

<div><strong>Who’s gambling with our markets now?</p>
<p></strong>In contrast to my own somewhat more gloomy views of our financial future, we have a different framing of the financial credit problem and the banking situation.</p>
<p>A new report by Stratfor’s George Friedman called <a href="http://www.blogger.com/%E2%80%9Dhttp://www.stratfor.com/products/premium/gir.php%E2%80%9D">”China and the Arabian Peninsula as Market Stabilizers”</a> takes a different slant on global finances and the US financial markets. In essence, he argues that the US has issued so many dollar debt instruments, and exporters have accepted so many of them over the years, that we are locked into our imbalances in trade.</p>
<p>He argues that with the dramatic rise in oil and commodity prices, and the implosion of the sub-prime mortgage market in the US, there should have been a collapse of financial markets before now. “The single most interesting thing about today&#8217;s global economy is what has not occurred.” Neither bond nor stock markets in the US have broken down, as would be expected under such stresses.</p>
<blockquote><p>“This is not an act of charity. Dubai and the rest of the Arabian Peninsula, as well as China, are holding huge dollar reserves, and the last thing they want to do is sell those dollars in sufficient quantity to drive the dollar&#8217;s price even lower. Nor do they want to see a financial crisis in the U.S. markets. Both the Chinese and the Arabs have far too much to lose to want such an outcome. So, in an infinite number of open market transactions, as well as occasionally public investments, they are moving to support the U.S. markets, albeit for their own reasons.”</p></blockquote>
<p>
<div>Mr. Friedman doesn’t see any other explanation for the relative stability of our financial markets till now, nor any likely moves being made to change that situation.</p>
<p>My thought is this: What if a worldwide credit freeze based on insolvency of individuals and institutions forces change anyway? What if the solution doesn’t involve the willing participation of the US, China, and the GCC? </p></div>

                                <p>I was reading this by <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=ZDM4ZDUxYzQzODcyMjFjZWEyZWE0MzM2ZmY0OGI0YTU=">Greg Kaza</a> at the National Review:  &#8220;An expansion that began in November 2001 is currently in its 73rd month&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>It led me to wonder how one squares this Republican/conservative circle:</p>
<p>1.  Lower tax rates are pro-growth<br />2.  Lower real interest rates are pro-growth<br />3.  Tax rates are lower under GW than under Clinton<br />4.  I&#8217;m traveling right now, and my supposed high speed internet access is very slow so I can&#8217;t provide links, but as I recall, interest rates, real and nominal, have been lower under GW than under Clinton.<br />5.  Real economic growth rates have been lower under GW than under Clinton.  </p>
<p>OK.  So there was the recession.  But as Kaza points out, we&#8217;ve been in expansion since November 2001.  How long will it take for the lower taxes and lower interest rates to do their magic?  At some point, shouldn&#8217;t the better athlete catch up with the worse athlete?  And shouldn&#8217;t the better athlete be able to outlast the worse athlete, without continuously needing help.  (Anyone remember the Fed being pressured to cut interest rates by quite a bit, again, at this point in the previous business cycle?)</p>

<p>    The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) just updated their invaluable <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/88xx/doc8885/Supplemental_tables.xls">data series</a> on income inequality.</p>
<p>In looking at them I came up with a couple of very interesting charts.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/R2GZZzDUSyI/AAAAAAAAADk/isrZvBdDYTs/s1600-h/Clipboard01.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/R2GZZzDUSyI/AAAAAAAAADk/isrZvBdDYTs/s320/Clipboard01.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a></p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/R2GZ0DDUSzI/AAAAAAAAADs/STcoOE7YJz4/s1600-h/Clipboard02.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/R2GZ0DDUSzI/AAAAAAAAADs/STcoOE7YJz4/s320/Clipboard02.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a><br />In recent years there has been one big factor in this redistribution of income that<br />has not been discussed much.  That is the massive increase in profits share of GDP<br />that happened this cycle.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/R2GaVDDUS0I/AAAAAAAAAD0/NArKB6zbQOg/s1600-h/Clipboard03.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/R2GaVDDUS0I/AAAAAAAAAD0/NArKB6zbQOg/s320/Clipboard03.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a>The primary factor behind this large increase in profits has been firms ability to<br />capture the large productivity gains this cycle in higher profit margins rather<br />than in labor compensation.</p>
<p>Standard economic theory says this large gain in profits should be reflected in higher<br />savings and/or higher capital spending.  But we have not seen either response.<br />However, the much higher income inequality and large cyclical increase in profits<br />have generated somewhat higher tax receipts than we had at the bottom of the cycle.<br />So through these mechanisms we do seem to be getting something of a supply side<br />impact on tax receipts, but given these other developments it is amazingly small.</p>

                                <p>We are currently experiencing our first snow, possibly to 10 inches. Usually this is taken in stride, but because it started about 1:00 PM and was to include ice conditions and to peak during rush hour, schools let out early, which is very unusual. For some reason the &#8216;Storm Watch Emergency&#8217; people suggested to businesses over the radio to let people out early.</p>
<p>Apparently they did. The roads are not yet bad (to me), but the traffic snarled on ALL major roads, Turnpike, and many of the side &#8216;escape&#8217; routes one has to avoid congestion. People will be expected to take twice the time normally to get home.</p>
<p>Not a very good sign for escaping or evacuating a metropolitan area.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>
<p>Worse than expected snarls, add triple time to get home, expect to make own dinner of cold meat loaf. Individual decision to apparently optimize behavior of cutting across intersection on a yellow light, and then stopping short when traffic stops to block the flow from the perpendicular, raises serious concerns how it adds any thing at all to optimizing the societal concern of better flow. No police in sight to enforce honesty. I believe maybe 5% cheating is all it takes to make cooperation less important. Boston area succumbing to lawless traffic jams.</p>
<p><strong>Update 2:</strong><br />Inability to pull off road to go shopping or eat a meal limits choices. No spots, no turns.</p>
<p><strong>Update3:</strong>  Normally I would be more sanguine about an <strong>unremarkable snowstorm </strong>over the course of the winter.  Roads are clear in the burbs. Snow is fluffy.  What caught my attention is the fact that it appeared businesses let people out at the same time per request and people left before the plows and sand trucks did their magic.  The heavy equipment became part of the traffic jam.  Hence not only Boston and towns close in but those further out over a very wide area experienced gridlock to the point of people simply parking and walking.  Very different and unusual in that aspect, and quite the extended period of 6=7 hours.</p>
<p>People who waited to the end of the day were still stuck until 7 or later, eventhough others had left earlier.  Yet today everything here looks normal except for parked cars filling parking lots.</p>
